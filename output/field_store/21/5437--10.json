Oh, that he had  some courage about him! That he would stand up and fight! That one could  force him to it! I should not be afraid of missing him!    CLARA.    I beg of you!    SECRETARY (_going_).    As soon as it grows dark!    [_He returns and grasps CLARA's hand._]    Girl, you stand before me--[_He turns away._]    Thousands of your sex would have kept it a secret with shrewd cunning,  and only in an hour of sweet forgetfulness would have confided it  coaxingly to the ear and soul of their husbands. I feel what I owe you!    CLARA (_alone_).    Oh, my heart, lock yourself up! Crush yourself together so that not  another drop of that blood may escape which would kindle again the  congealing life in my veins! For a moment a feeling akin to hope arose  in you again! Now for the first time I am conscious of it!    [_Laughs._]    No! No man can, overlook that! And if--could you yourself overlook it?  Would you have had the courage to grasp a hand that--No! no! Such evil  courage you would not have! You would with your own hands have to lock  yourself into your hell, if any one tried to open the door from the  outside. You are forever--Oh, alas, that the pain is intermittent, that  the piercing agony sometimes ceases! That is the reason why it lasts so  long! The tortured man imagines he is resting when the torturer merely  pauses to get his breath. It is like a drowning man's catching his  breath on the waves, when the current that has drawn him under spews him  forth again only to seize him once more and draw him down. He has  nothing but a double, futile fight for life!--    Well, Clara?--Yes, father, I am going! Your daughter will not drive you  to self-destruction! Soon I shall be the wife of that man, or--God! No!  I do not go begging for happiness--it is misery, the deepest misery that  I beg for! You will give me my misery!--Away! Where is the letter?    [_She takes it._]    Three wells you pass on your way to him! You must not halt at any of  them, Clara--you have not yet the right to do that!    [_Exit._]        ACT III        SCENE I    _LEONARD'S Room._    LEONARD (_at a table covered with documents, writing_).    That makes the sixth sheet since dinner! How good a man feels when he is  doing his duty! Now anybody that wanted to could come through the door,  even the king himself! I should rise, but I should not feel embarrassed!  I make just one exception--that is the old joiner! But, after all, he  cannot do much to me! Poor Clara! I am sorry for her. I cannot think of  her without uneasiness! If only it were not for that one cursed evening!  It was really more jealousy than love that made me so frantic, and she  must have yielded to me only to silence my reproaches--for she was as  cold as death toward me! She has some bad days ahead of her! Oh, well, I  too shall suffer considerable annoyance! Let everybody bear his own  burden! Above all things I must make the affair with the little humpback  secure, so that she cannot escape me when the storm breaks out! Then I  shall have the burgomaster on my side, and shall have nothing to fear!        SCENE II    _Enter, CLARA._    CLARA.    Good evening, Leonard!    LEONARD.    Clara! [_To himself._]    This is something I did not expect!    [_Aloud._]    Did you not receive my letter? Surely--Perhaps you are coming for your  father to pay the taxes! How much is it?    [_He fumbles in a ledger._]    I really ought to have it in my head!    CLARA.    I have come to give back your letter! Read it again!    LEONARD (_reads it with great seriousness_).    It is a perfectly sensible letter! How can a man who has public money in  trust marry into a family to which [_he swallows a word_]--to which your  brother belongs?    CLARA.    Leonard!    LEONARD.    But perhaps the whole town is mistaken! Your brother is not in prison?  He never was in prison? You are not the sister of a--of your brother?    CLARA.    Leonard, I am my father's daughter! Not as the sister of an accused,  innocent man, who has been set free--for my brother is at liberty--not  as a girl who trembles before undeserved disgrace, for [_in a low  voice_] I tremble still more before you, only as the daughter of the old  man who gave me life, do I stand here!    LEONARD.    And you wish?--    CLARA.    Can you ask? Oh, that I might go away! My father will cut his throat,  unless--Marry me!    LEONARD.    Your father--    CLARA.    He has sworn it! Marry me!    LEONARD.    Hand and neck are near cousins--they never do harm to each other! Don't  be anxious!    CLARA.    He has sworn it! Marry me! And, afterward, kill me! I will thank you  even more for the latter than for the former!    LEONARD.    Do you love me? Did your heart prompt you to come here? Am I the man  without whom you cannot live and die?    CLARA.    Answer that yourself!    LEONARD.    Can you swear that you love me? That you love me as a girl loves a man  to whom she is to bind herself forever?    CLARA.    No, that I cannot swear! But this I can swear Whether I love you or do  not love you, that you shall never know! I will wait on you, I will work  for you, you need give me nothing to eat, I will support myself, I will  do sewing and spinning for other people at night, I will go hungry when  I have nothing to do, I will rather bite a piece out of my own arm than  go to my father and let him suspect anything! When you beat me, because  your dog is not at hand, or because you have kicked him out, I will  rather swallow my own tongue than emit a cry which will betray to the  neighbors what is going on. I cannot promise that my skin will not show  the welts caused by your whip, for that is not in my power. But I will  lie about it, I will say that I fell head foremost against the cupboard,  or that I slipped on the floor because it was too smooth--that I will do  before anybody has time to ask me where the black and blue marks came  from!--Marry me! I shall not live long! And if it lasts too long for  you, if you do not care to meet the expenses of the divorce proceedings  necessary to get rid of me, them buy some poison of the apothecary and  put it somewhere as if it were for your rats. I will take it without  your even nodding to me, and tell the neighbors with my dying breath  that I took it for pulverized sugar!    LEANARD.    A man of whom you expect all this will certainly not surprise you if he  says no!    CLARA.    Then may God not frown too severely on me if I come before he calls me!  If I had myself alone to consider I would endure it patiently. If the  world kicked me in my misery, instead of standing by me, I would bear it  submissively and regard it as just punishment for I know not what! I  would love my child, even if it had your features, and I would cry so  much before the poor innocent thing that, when it grew older and wiser,  it would certainly not despise and curse its mother. But it is not  myself alone; and on Judgement Day I shall much more easily find an  answer to the Judge's question: why did you drive your father to it?    LEANARD.    You talk as if you were the first woman and the last to find herself in  your predicament! Thousands have gone through it before you and  submitted to their fate. Thousands after you will be confronted with the  same situation and accept their fate. Are all these others strumpets,  that you are so anxious to stand in the corner by yourself? They also  had fathers who invented a score of new oaths when they first heard of  it, and talked about murder and homicide! Afterward they were ashamed of  themselves and repented their oaths and blasphemies; they sat down and  rocked the child, or fanned the flies away!    CLARA.    I readily believe that you fail to understand why anybody in the world  should keep an oath.        SCENE III    _Enter a boy_    BOY.    Here are some flowers! I am not to say from whom they come!    LEANARD.    Oh, what pretty flowers!    [_He beats his brow._]    The devil! How stupid of me! I should have sent Some! How can I get out  of it? I do not understand such things, and the little girl will take it  to heart! She has nothing else to think about!    [_He takes the flowers._]    But I shall not keep all of them.    [_To_ Clara] How about it? These here signify repentance and shame,  don't they? Did you not say that to me once?    CLARA (_nods_.)    LEANARD (_To the boy_).    See here, boy, these are for me. I fasten them on me here, you  see--where my heart is. These, these dark red ones, which burn like a  dismal fire, you may take back. Do you understand? As soon as my apples  are ripe, you may come for some!    BOY.    That is a long time off!    [_Exit_.]        SCENE IV    LEANARD.    Yes, you see, Clara; you spoke about keeping one's word. Just because I  am a man of my word I must answer you again as I have already answered  once before. A week ago I wrote you a letter--you cannot deny it--there  it lies! [_He hands her the letter, which she takes mechanically_.] I  had reason--your brother--you say he is acquitted--I am glad of that!  But during these eight days I have entered into a new relation. I had a  right to do it, for you did not protest against my letter at the right  time! I was free in my own conscience, as well as before the law. Now  you come to me--but I have already given my promise and received  another's! [_To himself._] I would it were so!--The other girl is  already in the same predicament as you are! I am sorry for you, but [_He  strokes her hair, and she permits it, as if she were absolutely  unconscious of it_]--you understand?--One cannot trifle with the  burgomaster!    CLARA (_absent-mindedly_).    Trifle with him!    LEONARD.    See! You are getting sensible! And as far as your father is concerned,  you can say it boldly to his face that he alone is to blame. Do not  stare at me so; do not shake your head! It is so, girl, it is so!

This proved to be the rare A. quadrilateralis of De  Candolle.)    LEAVE THE LACHLAN TO TRAVEL WESTWARD.    April 20.    After proceeding some miles on this day's journey our Cudjallagong guide  pointed in a west-north-west direction as the way to Oolawambiloa.  Leaving therefore the Kalare or Lachlan, near a great bend in its general  course which below this (according to Mr. Oxley's map) was south-west, we  followed the route proposed by my native friend as it was precisely in  the direction by which I wished to approach the Darling. The universal  scarcity of water had however deprived me of every hope that any could be  found in that country, at a season when we often sought it in vain, even  in the bed of one of the large rivers of the country. Our guide however  knew the nature of our wants, and also that of the country, and I eagerly  followed him towards a hill, the most distant and most westerly on the  northern horizon.    NO WATER.    At sunset we halted full twenty miles short of that hill, beside the bed  of a small river, resembling in capacity and the nature of its banks that  of the Bogan; but to the manifest consternation of our guide we could  find no water in it, although some ponds had been only recently dried up.  This watercourse, he informed me, was the same which I had seen passing  by Murrangong, but he said it did not return its waters to the Lachlan, a  circumstance which I could not understand. Booraran was the name he gave  it. He went with some of our people in the dark and found a few quarts of  water two miles beyond it, but our cattle were obliged to pass the night  without any. The barometer had been falling for several days and the wind  arising suddenly at 9 P.M. brought a misty mass of cloud which began most  providentially to drop upon us, to the great relief of our thirsty  cattle. This day we found on the plains a new species of Sida with small  yellow flowers, very fragrant, and on a long stalk.* In the woods I  observed a eucalyptus of a graceful drooping character, apparently  related to E. pilularis and amygdalina.    (*Footnote. S. fibulifera, Lindley manuscripts; incano-tomentosa,  pusilla, diffusa, foliis ovato-oblongis obtusis dentatis basi cordatis,  stipulis longissimis setaceis, pedunculis axillaribus aggregatis  filiformibus petiolis longioribus, calycibus lanatis corolla parum  brevioribus, fructu disciformi convexo tomentoso, coccis monospermis.)    NATIVES FROM WARRANARY.    April 21.    A rainy morning. Some strange natives approached from the woods while I  was looking at the country beyond the dry channel, in the direction in  which our guide still wished us to proceed (about west-north-west). They  were grave and important-looking old men, and each carried a light. They  called out to me in a serious tone \"Weeri kally,\" words which I too well  understood, meaning simply no water. I took my guide to them, but he  still seemed in doubt about the scarcity.    COURSE DOWN THE LACHLAN RESUMED.    It was necessary not to depend on uncertainties on such a point, and I  therefore lost no time in shaping our course again towards the nearest  bend of the Lachlan, which we reached after travelling nine miles in the  rain, and we encamped beside a pond or quawy named Buree. I considered  this day's journey to be the first deviation from the most direct line of  route towards that part of the Darling where my last journey terminated.  It was evident that in common seasons the country I wished to traverse  was not without water, our guide having suggested it as the way to  Oolawambiloa (a name always referring to a great abundance of water). I  considered it necessary now to ascertain, if possible, and before the  heavy part of our equipment moved further, whether the Lachlan actually  joined the Murrumbidgee near the point where Mr. Oxley saw its waters  covering the country; or whether it pursued a course so much more to the  westward as to have been taken for the Darling by Captain Sturt. Near the  Lachlan at this place the Anthericum bulbosum occurred in abundance, and  the cattle seemed to eat it with avidity.    On the bank of the river a new species of rosella appeared amongst the  birds, and several were shot and preserved as specimens.    EXTENSIVE RIDE TO THE WESTWARD.    April 22.    I proceeded westward accompanied by five men and an aboriginal guide, all  mounted on horseback. My object was to obtain, if possible, some  knowledge of the final course of the Lachlan; and secondly to ascertain  how far the hills to the north-west of our camp ranged beyond that very  remarkable feature, resembling a cape or promontory and named Warranary,  which marked the extent of our sight and knowledge at that time. This  point was in a direct line between the camp we then occupied on the  Lachlan and the lowest part of the Darling attained during the former  journey, and we had just fallen back from want of water; a circumstance  likely to compel me to follow the Lachlan downwards, at least if it could  be ascertained thus early that this river could not possibly be the  supposed Darling of Sturt. In case it proved otherwise I thought it not  improbable that, at the end of two days' journey westward, I might fall  in with the Lachlan, and if I could find water in it at such a point  under any circumstances, I considered that a position so much advanced  would be equally favourable, either for reaching the junction of the  Murray or the upper Darling. Should I succeed in reaching the Lachlan at  about sixty miles west of my camp I might be satisfied that it was this  river which Captain Sturt took for the Darling, and then I might seek  that river by crossing the range on the north. Whereas, should I find  sufficient reason to believe that the Darling would join the Murray, I  might continue my journey down the Lachlan until I reduced the distance  across to the Darling as much as the scarcity of water might render  necessary.    We traversed fine plains of greater extent than I had ever seen before,  and in general of more tenacious surface. They were in many parts covered  with salsolaceous plants, but I found also a kind of grass which I had  not previously noticed; and a curious woolly plant with two-spined fruit,  belonging to the genus Sclerolaena of Brown.* I looked in vain however  for the continuation of the range to the northward. The cape  before-mentioned first rose to a considerable height over the horizon,  but as we proceeded it sunk so as to be just visible behind us, bearing  at the point where we lay down for the night 31 degrees East of North.  The continuation of the range, as we now saw, receded to the north-west;  so that the horizon of these plains continued unbroken save by the  cape-like point of Warranary.    (*Footnote. S. bicornis, Lindley manuscripts; caule lanato ramoso, foliis  linearibus succulentis glabris, calycibus solitariis bispinosis lana alba  involutis.)    A flight of the cockatoo of the interior, with scarlet and yellow  top-knot, passed over our heads from the north-west.    The intense interest of this day's ride into a region quite unknown urged  me forward at a good pace, having a horizon like that of the sea before  and around us, and being in constant expectation of seeing either some  distant summit or line of lofty river-trees; all the results of the  journey depending on whether it should be the one or the other. Neither  however, as already stated, appeared, and the sun went down on the  unbroken horizon; nor could the native discern from the top of the  highest tree any other objects besides the lofty yarra trees of the  Lachlan, at a vast distance to the south-west by south. During the ride  many a tree and bush rose on the horizon before us and sunk on that we  left behind. We saw five emus together which did not run so far from us  as usual but stood at a little distance to gaze on our advancing party.  In a strip of scrub consisting of Acacia longifolia and lanceolata and  some other graceful shrubs I found a new species of correa, remarkable  for its small, green, bell-shaped flowers, and the almost total absence  of hairiness from its leaves.*    (*Footnote. C. glabra, Lindley manuscripts; ramulis incanis, foliis  ovalibus obtusis in petiolum angustatis glabris subtus punctatis, corolla  brevi campanulata tomentosa 4-dentata calyce truncato cupulari triplo  longiore.)    NIGHT WITHOUT WATER.    Near this scrub we saw also many pigeons and parrots; which strengthened  our hopes of finding water, which hopes however were disappointed, and we  at length tied our horses' heads to the trees in a bit of scrub, and I  lay down on a few boughs for the night under the cover of a gunya or  bower which, on such occasions, was set up by Woods in a very short time.  (See Volume 1.)    April 23.    Dew had providentially fallen during the night and it proved in some  measure a substitute for the want of water to our horses. It was also  highly favourable to the object of our tour in affording a refraction  when the sun rose, so that Coccaparra (Macquarie's range) appeared above  the horizon and enabled me to determine our distance from it to be sixty  miles. Still even this refractive state of the air brought no hills in  view to the north or north-west, a circumstance which surprised me and  afforded additional reason for supposing that the Lachlan might not unite  so soon as had been imagined with the Murrumbidgee.    CONTINUE WESTWARD, AND SOUTH-WEST.    This may require explanation. The course of rivers is in general  conformable to the direction of ranges or the position of those hills  which bound the valley or basin, however extensive, in which they flow.  As this range fell off to the north-west, opposite to where the course of  the Murrumbidgee had continued south-west, it was less probable that the  Lachlan would unite with the main stream there than if the range had  approached, or had even "]]]
