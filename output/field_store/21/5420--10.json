In  this pursuit he was greatly assisted by Dr. Laidley, who had made  himself completely master of it. Next to the language, his great  object was to collect information concerning the countries he  intended to visit. On this occasion he was referred to certain  traders called slatees, who are black merchants of great  consideration in this part of Africa, who come from the interior  countries, chiefly with enslaved negroes for sale; but he discovered  that little dependence could be placed on the accounts they gave, as  they contradicted each other in the most important particulars, and  all seemed extremely unwilling he should prosecute his journey.    In researches of this kind, and in observing the manners and customs  of the natives, in a country so little known to the nations of  Europe, and furnished with so many striking objects of nature, Mr.  Park's time passed not unpleasantly, and he began to flatter himself  that he had escaped the fever, to which Europeans, on their first  arrival in hot climates, are generally subject. But on the 31st July,  he imprudently exposed himself to the night dew, in observing an  eclipse of the moon, with a view to determine the longitude of the  place; the next day he found himself attacked with fever and  delirium, and an illness followed, which confined him to the house  the greater part of August. His recovery was very slow, but he  embraced every short interval of convalescence to walk out and  examine the productions of the country. In one of these excursions,  having rambled farther than usual in a hot day, he brought on a  return of his fever, and was again confined to his bed. The fever,  however, was not so violent as before, and in the course of three  weeks, when the weather permitted, he was able to renew his botanical  excursions; and when it rained, he amused himself with drawing  plants, &c. in his chamber. The care and attention of Dr. Laidley  contributed greatly to alleviate his sufferings; his company beguiled  the tedious hours during that gloomy season, when the rain falls in  torrents, when suffocating heats oppress by day, and when the night  is spent in listening to the croaking of frogs, the shrill cry of the  jackal, and the deep howling of the hyena; a dismal concert,  interrupted only by the roar of tremendous thunder.    On the 6th of October the waters of the Gambia were at their greatest  height, being fifteen feet above the high water mark of the tide,  after which they began to subside; at first slowly, but afterwards  very rapidly, sometimes sinking more than a foot in twenty-four  hours: by the beginning of November the river had sunk to its former  level, and the tide ebbed and flowed as usual. When the river had  subsided, and the atmosphere grew dry, Mr. Park recovered apace, and  began to think of his departure; for this is reckoned the most proper  season for travelling: the natives had completed their harvest, and  provisions were everywhere cheap and plentiful.    On the 2nd December 1795, Mr. Park took his departure from the  hospitable mansion of Dr. Laidley, being fortunately provided with a  negro servant, who spoke both the English and Mandingo tongues; his  name was Johnson: he was a native of that part of Africa, and having  in his youth been conveyed to Jamaica as a slave, he had been made  free, and taken to England by his master, where he had resided many  years, and at length found his way back to his native country. He was  also provided with a negro boy, named Demba, a sprightly youth, who,  besides Mandingo, spoke the language of the Serawoollies, an inland  people; and to induce him to behave well, he was promised his freedom  on his return, in case the tourist should report favourably of his  fidelity and services. A free man, named Madiboo, travelling to the  kingdom of Bambara, and two slatees, going to Bondou, offered their  services, as did likewise a negro, named Tami, a native of Kasson,  who had been employed some years by Dr. Laidley as a blacksmith, and  was returning to his native country with the savings of his labours.  All these men travelled on foot, driving their asses before them.    Thus Mr. Park had no less than six attendants, all of whom had been  taught to regard him with great respect, and to consider that their  safe return hereafter to the countries on the Gambia, would depend on  his preservation.    Dr. Laidley and the Messrs. Ainsley accompanied Park the two first  days. They reached Jindy the same day, and rested at the house of a  black woman, who had formerly been the mistress of Mr. Hewett, a  white trader, and who, in consequence of that honour, was called  _Seniora_. In the evening they walked out, to see an adjoining  village, belonging to a slatee, named Jemaffoo Mamadoo, the richest  of all the Gambia traders. They found him at home, and he thought so  highly of the honour done him by this visit, that he presented them  with a fine bullock, part of which was dressed for their evening's  repast.    The negroes do not go to supper till late, and in order to amuse  themselves while the beef was preparing, a Mandingo was desired to  relate some diverting stories, in listening to which, and smoking  tobacco, they spent three hours. These stories bear some resemblance  to those in the Arabian Nights' Entertainments, but in general are of  a more ludicrous cast.    About one o'clock in the afternoon of the 3rd of December, Park took  his leave of Dr. Laidley and Messrs. Ainsley, and rode slowly into  the woods. He had now before him a boundless forest, and a country,  the inhabitants of which were strangers to civilized life. He  reflected that he had parted from the last European he might probably  behold, and perhaps quitted for ever the comforts of Christian  society. These thoughts necessarily cast a gloom over his mind, and  he rode musing along for about three miles, when he was awakened from  his reverie by a number of people, who, running up, stopped the  asses, giving him to understand, that he must either go with them to  Peckaba, to present himself to the king of Woolli, or pay customs to  them. He endeavoured to make them comprehend, that not travelling for  traffic, he ought not to be subjected to a tax like merchants, but  his reasoning was thrown away upon them. They said it was usual for  travellers of all descriptions to make a present to the king of  Woolli, and without doing so, none could be permitted to proceed. As  the party were numerous, he thought it prudent to comply with their  demand, and presented them with four bars of tobacco. At sunset he  reached a village near Kootacunda.    The next day entering Woolli, he stopped to pay customs to an officer  of the king. Passing the night at a village called Tabajang: at noon  the following day Park reached Medina, the capital of the king of  Woolli's dominions. It is a large place, and contains at least a  thousand houses. It is fortified in the common African manner by a  high mud wall, and an outward fence of pointed stakes and prickly  bushes, but the walls were neglected, and the outward fence had  suffered considerably by being plucked up for fire-wood. Mr. Park  obtained a lodging with one of the king's near relations, who warned  him, at his introduction to the king, not to shake hands with him,  that liberty not being allowed to strangers. With this salutary  warning, Park paid his respects to Jatta, the king, and asked his  permission to pass to Bondou. He was the same old man, of whom Major  Houghton speaks in such favourable terms. The sovereign was seated  before the door of his hovel, surrounded by a number of men and  women, who were singing and clapping their hands. Park, saluting him  respectfully, told him the object of his visit. The monarch not only  permitted him to proceed on his journey, but declared he would offer  prayers for his safe return. One of Mr. Park's attendants, to  manifest his sense of the king's courtesy, roared out an Arabic song,  at every pause of which the king himself, and all present, striking  their hands against their foreheads, exclaimed, with affecting  solemnity, _Amen, Amen._ The king further assured him, that a guide  should be ready on the following day, to conduct him to the frontier  of Bondou. Having taken leave, he sent the king an order upon Dr.  Laidley for three gallons of rum, and received in return a great  store of provisions.    December the 6th, early in the morning, on visiting Jatta, he found  his majesty sitting upon a bullock's hide, warming himself before a  large fire, for the Africans frequently feel cold when a European is  oppressed with heat. Jatta received his visitant very kindly, and  earnestly entreated him to advance no farther into the interior,  telling him that Major Houghton had been killed in his route. He said  that travellers must not judge of the people of the eastern country  by those of Woolli. The latter were acquainted with white men, and  respected them; whereas, in the east, the people had never seen one,  and would certainly destroy the first they beheld. Park, thanking the  king for his affectionate concern, told him he was determined,  notwithstanding all danger, to proceed. The king shook his head, but  desisted from further persuasion, and ordered the guide to hold  himself in readiness.    On the guide making his appearance, Park took his last farewell of  the good old king, and in three hours reached Konjour, a small  village, where he and his party rested for the night. Here he bought  a fine sheep for some beads, and his attendants killed it, with all  the ceremonies prescribed by their religion. Part of it was dressed  for supper, after which a dispute arose between one of the negroes  and Johnson, the"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/12668"],[0,"An Account of the English Colony in New South Wales, Volume 2 (#13)"],[1,"from India, the owners never  failed to make the rum of that country an essential part of every cargo  which they sent upon speculation. And, though every necessary measure was  adopted to prevent all that arrived from being landed, yet, such was the  avidity with which it was sought after, that, if not permitted, it was  generally got on shore clandestinely, and very few ships carried back any  of what they had brought down. To this source might be traced all the  crimes which disgraced, and all the diseases that injured the colony.    Toward the latter end of the month a party set off on an excursion to the  cow pasture plains. On reaching mount Taurus, a distinct herd of the wild  cattle, 67 in number, was seen. It was conjectured, that this valuable  collection of cattle had so considerably increased, as to find a  convenience in dividing into different herds, thereby preventing those  quarrels which might frequently happen among their males. This was  confirmed by their falling-in with, in another place, a herd, in which  there could not have been fewer than 170 of these animals. A couple of  days were pleasantly occupied in examining this part of the country,  which exhibited the beautiful appearance of a luxuriant and well-watered  pasturage. The latitude of mount Taurus was found to be 34 degrees 16  minutes S and the river Nepean was discovered to take its course close  round the south side of this hill. Two gentlemen who were of this party  having, at their setting out, proposed to walk from mount Taurus in as  direct a line as the country would admit, to the seacoast, a whale boat  was ordered to wait for them about five leagues to the southward of  Botany Bay. They expected to have reached the coast in one day, but they  did not reckon on having full 25 miles of a rugged and mountainous road  to cross. Making their course a little to the southward of east, they  fell in with the boat very conveniently, and Mr. Bass, one of the  gentlemen, described their route to have laid, the greatest part of the  way, over nothing but high and steep ridges of hills, the land becoming  more rocky and barren as they drew near the sea coast. In each of the  valleys formed by these hills they found a run of fresh water, in some  places of considerable depth and rapidity. The direction of these streams  or runs being to the northward, they were supposed to fall into a harbour  which lay about five or six miles to the southward of Port Solander, and  had obtained the name of Port Hacking, the pilot of that name having had  the honour of the discovery.*    [* See the chart prefixed to this volume, where the route from Mount Taurus  is laid down.]    A church clock having been brought to the settlement in the _Reliance_  when that ship arrived from England, and no building fit for its  reception having been since erected, preparations were now making  for constructing a tower fit for the purpose; to which might be added a  church, whenever at a future day the increase of labourers might enable  the governor to direct such an edifice to be built.    One mill not being sufficient to grind the flour required by the  inhabitants at Sydney, the stone masons were employed in breaking out and  preparing stone for another at that place.    The blacksmith's shop, begun in the last month, was nearly completed at  the end of this.    The weather was observed to be growing warm. Toward the middle of the  month strong southerly winds, with rainy and unsettled weather,  prevailed, particularly at the change of the moon.          CHAPTER VI        Another boat seized and carried off  Order in consequence  The criminal court thrice assembled  Particulars  Three men stand in the pillory  Perjury explained to the convicts  Natives very troublesome; seize a boat  Various works in hand  An attempt to seize another boat frustrated  Prospect of a fine harvest  Wilson gives himself up  Is made use of  Two mares stolen  The clergyman's servant attempts to rob him  Information sent to India respecting the boats  An amphibious animal discovered  Description  Accident  Works  Police  Weather      October.] The month of October opened with a repetition of the vexatious  circumstances that marked the opening of the preceding month. In the  night of the 2nd, a boat was taken from Parramatta by some people who got  unobserved out of the harbour. The three men who were put on shore from  the _Cumberland_ at the time she was seized upon, from an  unwillingness to accompany them, being in this party, it was supposed  they were connected in some way with those who were in that boat, and  whom they might know where to find. An armed boat from the _Supply_  was immediately dispatched after them; but in three days returned, as  unsuccessful as Lieutenant Shortland had unfortunately been in his  search.    From this circumstance there was reason to suppose that they had stood  off from the land; in which case, as the weather since their departure  had been unusually bad, the wind blowing a gale from the southward, with  much rain, and their boat being a very bad one, it was probable they had  perished.    In these two boats 15 convicts had made their escape from the settlement;  six of whom had been transported for life; six others were from Ireland,  of whose term of transportation no account had been sent out; and of the  remainder, one had to serve until the 23rd of May 1799, another until the  2nd of April 1801, and the third until the 15th of April 1804.    Whatever might be the fate of these people, the evil was of great extent;  since all that could be known of them to their fellow prisoners was, that  they had successfully effected their escape. Had Bryan and his party, who  went off with one of the King's boats in the year 1791, instead of  meeting with the compassion and lenity which were expressed in England  for their sufferings, been sent back and tried in New South Wales, for  taking away the boat, and other thefts which they had committed, it was  probable that others might have been deterred from following their  example.    On this occasion an order was published, stating that, as, for the  private convenience of various individuals, permission had been granted  for the building of boats under certain dimensions, yet those boats had  been frequently found so improperly secured in the night, and left by  their respective owners in situations so favourable to the views of those  ignorant beings who were perpetually looking out for means to escape from  the settlement, the governor therefore found it expedient positively to  prohibit the building of a boat of any kind without having previously  obtained his express permission; and to declare, that if any of the boats  then in use in the settlement should thenceforward be found improperly  secured at night, or left with oars, rudder, masts, or sails on board,  they would be laid on shore and burnt.    Such was the increase of crimes, that thrice in this month was the court  of criminal judicature assembled. The offences that came under their  cognisance were those of murder, perjury, forgery, and theft.    Two men were tried for having killed a native youth, well known in the  settlement*; but it appearing to the court that he had been accidentally  shot, they were acquitted. The natives certainly behaved ill, and often  provoked the death which they met with; but there was not any necessity  for wantonly destroying them, a circumstance which it was feared had but  too often occurred. On the acquittal of these prisoners, they were  assured by the governor, that he was determined to make an example of the  first person who should be convicted of having wantonly taken the life of  a native.    [* By the name of Tom Rowley (after one of the officers of the regiment).  He had accompanied Mr. Raven, in the _Britannia_, to Bengal, in the  year 1795.]    Another prisoner, John Morris, was tried for the murder of Charles  Martin, by violently kicking and beating him, so that he died the  following day. He was found guilty of manslaughter, and sentenced to be  burned in the hand and imprisoned for 12 months.    One man was found guilty of uttering a bill knowing it to be forged, and  adjudged to suffer death; and two others, for theft, were ordered to be  transported to Norfolk Island, one for the term of his life, and another  for seven years.    It appearing on one of these trials, that three of the witnesses had  manifestly and wilfully committed the crime of perjury, they were brought  to trial; and, being found guilty, were sentenced to stand in the  pillory; to which, as an additional punishment, their ears were to be  nailed. Their sentence was put in execution before the public provision  store, when the mob, either to display their aversion to the crime, or,  what might be more probable, to catch at any thing that wore the form of  amusement, pelted them with rotten eggs and dirt.    These people were three of the worst characters in the colony, Luke  Normington, John Colley, and William Osborne. It amounted nearly to a  mockery and profanation of religion to administer an oath to such  hardened and unprincipled wretches; yet their testimony could not be  refused when called for by a prisoner who was standing under the weight  of a capital charge; but of the credibility of such testimony it was  always in the breast of the court to judge.    On this occasion the governor deemed it advisable to explain, in public  orders, the nature of this dreadful offence, an offence so certainly  ruinous both to their temporal and eternal welfare. He pointed out to  them, that, as every man who stood convicted of this dangerous breach of  the law was thereby rendered infamous ever after, no one who had a  character to lose (alas! how few were there who would feel themselves  affected by this observation) would associate with such criminals, lest  he should endanger his own reputation, and be"]]]
