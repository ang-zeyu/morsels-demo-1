[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/9069"],[0,"Saint Augustin (#12)"],[1,"western Mediterranean. With its large new  streets, its villas, its temples, its palaces, its docks, its variously  dressed cosmopolitan population, it astonished and delighted the schoolboy  from Madaura. Whatever local marks were left about him, or signs of the  rustic simpleton, it brushed off. At first, Augustin must have felt himself  as good as lost there.    There he was, his own master, with nobody to counsel and direct him. He  does indeed mention his fellow-countryman, that Romanianus, the patron of  his father and of other people in Thagaste, as a high and generous friend  who invited him to his house when he, a poor youth, came to finish his  studies in a strange city, and helped him, not only with his purse, but  with his friendship. Unfortunately the allusion is not very clear. Still,  it does seem to shew that Augustin, in the first days after his arrival at  Carthage, stayed with Romanianus. It is not in the least improbable that  Romanianus had a house at Carthage and spent the winter there: during the  rest of the year he would be in his country houses round about Thagaste.  This opulent benefactor might not have been satisfied with giving Augustin  a good \"tip\" for his journey when he was leaving his native town, but may  also have put him up in his own house at Carthage. Such was the atonement  for those enormous fortunes of antiquity: the rich had to give freely and  constantly. With the parcelling out of wealth we have become much more  egoistical.    In any case, Romanianus, taken up with his pleasures and business, could  not have been much of a guide for Monnica's son. Augustin was therefore  without control, or very nearly. No doubt he came to Carthage with a strong  desire to increase his knowledge and get renown, but still more athirst  for love and the emotions of sentiment. The love-prelude was deliriously  prolonged for him. He was at that time so overwhelmed by it, that it is the  first thing he thinks of when he relates his years at Carthage. \"To love  and be loved\" seems to him, as to his dear Alexandrine poets, the single  object of life. Yet he was not in love, \"but he loved the idea of love.\"  _Nondum amabam, et amare amabam ... amare amans...._    Truly, never a pagan poet had hitherto found such language to speak  of love. These subtle phrases are not only the work of a marvellous  word-smith: through their almost imperceptible shades of meaning may be  descried an entirely new soul, the pleasure-loving soul of the old world  awakening to spiritual life. Modern people have repeated the words more  than enough, but by translating them too literally--\"I loved to love\"--they  have perhaps distorted the sense. They have made Augustin a kind of  Romantic like Alfred de Musset, a dilettante in love. Augustin is not so  modern, although he often seems one of ourselves. When he wrote those words  he was a bishop and a penitent. What strikes him above all in looking back  upon his uneasy and feverish life as a youth and young man, is the great  onrush of all his being which swept him towards love. Plainly, man is made  for love, since he loves without object and without cause, since in itself  alone the idea of love is already for him a beginning of love. Only he  falls into error in giving to creatures a heart that the Creator alone can  fill and satisfy. In this love for love's sake, Augustin discerned the sign  of the predestined soul whose tenderness will find no rest but in God. That  is why he repeats this word \"Love\" with a kind of intoxication. He knows  that those who love like him cannot love long with a human love. Nor does  he blush to acknowledge it:--he loved--he loved with all his soul--he  loved to the point of loving the coming of love. Happy intimation for the  Christian! A heart so afire is pledged to the eternal marriage.    With this heat of passion, this lively sensibility, Augustin was a prey for  Carthage. The voluptuous city took complete hold on him by its charm and  its beauty, by all the seductions of mind and sense, by its promises of  easy enjoyment.    First of all, it softened this young provincial, used to the harder country  life of his home; it relaxed the Numidian contracted by the roughness of  his climate; it cooled his eyes burned by the sun in the full-flowing of  its waters and the suavity of its horizons. It was a city of laziness, and  above all, of pleasure, as well for those plunged in business as for the  idlers. They called it _Carthago Veneris_--Carthage of Venus. And certainly  the old Phoenician Tanit always reigned there. Since the rebuilding of her  temple by the Romans, she had transformed herself into _Virgo Coelestis_.  This Virgin of Heaven was the great Our Lady of unchastity, towards whom  still mounted the adoration of the African land four hundred years after  the birth of Christ. \"Strange Virgin,\" Augustin was to say later, \"who can  only be honoured by the loss of virginity.\" Her dissolving influence seemed  to overcome the whole region. There is no more feminine country than this  Carthaginian peninsula, ravished on all sides by the caress of the waters.  Stretched out between her lakes on the edge of the sea, Carthage lounged in  the humid warmth of her mists, as if in the suffocating atmosphere of her  vapour-baths.    She stole away the energies, but she was an enchantment for the eyes.  From the top of the impressive flight of steps which led up to the temple  of AEsculapius on the summit of the Acropolis, Augustin could see at his  feet the huge, even-planned city, with its citadel walls which spread out  indefinitely, its gardens, blue waters, flaxen plains, and the mountains.  Did he pause on the steps at sunset, the two harbours, rounded cup-shape,  shone, rimmed by the quays, like lenses of ruby. To the left, the Lake of  Tunis, stirless, without a ripple, as rich in ethereal lights as a Venetian  lagoon, radiated in ever-altering sheens, delicate and splendid. In front,  across the bay, dotted with the sails of ships close-hauled to the wind,  beyond the wind-swept and shimmering intervals, the mountains of Rhodes  raised their aerial summit-lines against the sky. What an outlook on the  world for a young man dreaming of fame! And what more exhilarating spot  than this Mount Byrsa, where, in deep layers, so many heroic memories were  gathered and superimposed. The great dusty plains which bury themselves  far off in the sands of the desert, the mountains--yes, and isles and  headlands, all bowed before the Hill that Virgil sang and seemed to do  her reverence. She held in awe the innumerable tribes of the barbaric  continent; she was mistress of the sea. Rome herself, from the height of  her Palatine, surged less imperial.    More than any other of the young men seated with him on the benches of the  school of rhetoric, Augustin hearkened to the dumb appeals which came  from the ancient ruins and new palaces of Carthage. But the supple and  treacherous city knew the secret of enchaining the will. She tempted him by  the open display of her amusements. Under this sun which touches to beauty  the plaster of a hut, the grossest pleasures have an attraction which men  of the North cannot understand. The overflowing of lust surrounds you.  This prolific swarming, all these bodies, close-pressed and soft with  sweat, give forth as it were a breath of fornication which melts the will.  Augustin breathed in with delight the heavy burning air, loaded with human  odours, which filled the streets and squares of Carthage. To all the bold  soliciting, to all the hands stretched out to detain him as he walked, he  yielded.    But for a mind like his Carthage had more subtle allurements in reserve.  He was taken by her theatres, by the verses of her poets and the melodies  of her musicians. He shed tears at the plays of Menander and Terence;  he lamented upon the misfortunes of separated lovers; he shared their  quarrels, rejoiced and despaired with them. And still he awaited the  epiphany of Love--that Love which the performance of the actors shewed him  to be so touching and fine.    Such then was Augustin, given over to the irresponsibility of his eighteen  years--a heart spoiled by romantic literature, a mind impatient to try  every sort of intellectual adventure in the most corrupting and bewitching  city known to the pagan centuries, set amidst one of the most entrancing  landscapes in the world.          II    THE AFRICAN ROME      Carthage did not offer only pleasures to Augustin; it was besides an  extraordinary subject to think about for an understanding so alert and  all-embracing as his.    At Carthage he understood the Roman grandeur as he could not at Madaura  and the Numidian towns. Here, as elsewhere, the Romans made a point of  impressing the minds of conquered races by the display of their strength  and magnificence. Above all, they aimed at the immense. The towns built  by them offered the same decorative and monumental character of the  Greek cities of the Hellenistic period, which the Romans had further  exaggerated--a character not without emphasis and over-elaboration, but  which was bound to astonish, and that was the main thing in their view. In  short, their ideal was not perceptibly different from that of our modern  town councillors. To lay out streets which intersected at right angles; to  create towns cut into even blocks like chessboards; to multiply prospects  and huge architectural masses--all the Roman cities of this period revealed  such an aim, with an almost identical plan.    Erected after this type, the new Carthage caused the old to be forgotten.  Everybody agreed that it was second only to Rome. The African writers  squandered the most hyperbolical praises upon it. For them it is \"The  splendid, the august, the sublime Carthage.\" Although there may well be a  certain amount of triviality or of patriotic exaggeration in these praises,  it is certain that the Roman capital of the"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/9090"],[0,"Germania and Agricola (#12)"],[1,"foret.    XXVII. Cujus conscientia ac fama ferox exercitus nihil virtuti suae  invium: penetrandam Caledoniam, inveniendumque tandem Britanniae terminum  continuo proeliorum cursu, fremebant: atque illi modo cauti ac sapientes,  prompti post eventum ac magniloqui erant. Iniquissima haec bellorum  conditio est: prospera omnes sibi vindicant, adversa uni imputantur. At  Britanni non virtute, sed occasione et arte ducis rati, nihil ex  arrogantia remittere, quo minus juventutem armarent, conjuges ac liberos  in loca tuta transferrent, coetibus ac sacrificiis conspirationem  civitatum sancirent: atque ita irritatis utrimque animis discessum.    XXVIII. Eadem aestate cohors Usipiorum, per Germanias conscripta, in  Britanniam transmissa, magnum ac memorabile facinus ausa est. Occiso  centurione ac militibus, qui ad tradendam disciplinam immixti manipulis  exemplum et rectores habebantur, tres liburnicas, adactis per vim  gubernatoribus, ascendere: et uno remigante, suspectis duobus eoque  interfectis, nondum vulgato rumore ut miraculum praevehebantur: mox hac  atque illa rapti, et cum plerisque Britannorum, sua defensantium, proelio  congressi, ac saepe victores, aliquando pulsi, eo ad extremum inopiae  venere, ut infirmissimos suorum, mox sorte ductos, vescerentur. Atque  circumvecti Britanniam, amissis per inscitiam regendi navibus, pro  praedonibus habiti, primum a Suevis, mox a Frisiis intercepti sunt: ac  fuere, quos per commercia venumdatos et in nostram usque ripam mutatione  ementium adductos, indicium tanti casus illustravit.    XXIX. Initio aestatis Agricola, domestico vulnere ictus, anno ante natum  filum amisit. Quem casum neque, ut plerique fortium virorum, ambitiose,  neque per lamenta rursus ac moerorem muliebriter tulit: et in luctu  bellum inter remedia erat. Igitur praemissa classe, quae pluribus locis  praedata, magnum et incertum terrorem faceret, expedito exercitu, cui ex  Britannis fortissimos et longa pace exploratos addiderat, ad montem  Grampium pervenit, quem jam hostis insederat. Nam Britanni, nihil fracti  pugnae prioris eventu, et ultionem aut servitium exspectantes, tandemque  docti commune periculum concordia propulsandum, legationibus et  foederibus omnium civitatum vires exciverant. Jamque super triginta  millia armatorum aspiciebantur, et adhuc affluebat omnis juventus et  quibus cruda ac viridis senectus, clari bello et sua quisque decora  gestantes: cum inter plures duces virtute et genere praestans, nomine  Calgacus, apud contractam multitudinem proelium poscentem, in hunc modum  locutus fertur:    XXX. \"Quotiens causas belli et necessitatem nostram intueor, magnus mihi  animus est hodiernum diem consensumque vestrum initium libertatis totius  Britanniae fore. Nam et universi servitutis expertes, et nullae ultra  terrae, ac ne mare quidem securum, imminente nobis classe Romana: ita  proelium atque arma, quae fortibus honesta, eadem etiam ignavis tutissima  sunt. Priores pugnae, quibus adversus Romanos varia fortuna certatum est,  spem ac subsidium in nostris manibus habebant: quia nobilissimi totius  Britanniae eoque in ipsis penetralibus siti, nec servientium littora  aspicientes, oculos quoque a contactu dominationis inviolatos habebamus.  Nos terrarum ac libertatis extremos, recessus ipse ac sinus famae in  hunc diem defendit: nunc terminus Britanniae patet; atque omne ignotum  pro magnifico est. Sed nulla jam ultra gens, nihil nisi fluctus et saxa,  et infestiores Romani: quorum superbiam frustra per obsequium et  modestiam effugeris. Raptores orbis, postquam cuncta vastantibus defuere  terrae, et mare scrutantur: si locuples hostis est, avari; si pauper,  ambitiosi: quos non Oriens, non Occidens, satiaverit. Soli omnium opes  atque inopiam pari affectu concupiscunt. Auferre, trucidare, rapere,  falsis nominibus imperium; atque, ubi solitudinem faciunt, pacem  appellant.\"    XXXI. \"Liberos cuique ac propinquos suos natura carissimos esse voluit;  hi per delectus, alibi servituri, auferuntur conjuges sororesque, etsi  hostilem libidinem effugiant, nomine amicorum atque hospitum polluuntur.  Bona fortunasque in tributum egerunt, annos in frumentum: corpora ipsa ac  manus silvis ac paludibus emuniendis inter verbera ac contumelias  conterunt. Nata servituti mancipia semel veneunt, atque ultro a dominis  aluntur: Britannia servitutem suam quotidie emit, quotidie pascit. Ac,  sicut in familia recentissimus quisque servorum et conservis ludibrio  est, sic in hoc orbis terrarum vetere famulatu novi nos et viles in  excidium petimur. Neque enim arva nobis aut metalla aut portus sunt,  quibus exercendis reservemur. Virtus porro ac ferocia subjectorum ingrata  imperantibus: et longinquitas ac secretum ipsum quo tutius, eo  suspectius. Ita, sublata spe veniae, tandem sumite animum, tam quibus  salus, quam quibus gloria carissima est. Trinobantes, femina duce,  exurere coloniam, expugnare castra, ac, nisi felicitas in socordiam  vertisset, exuere jugum potuere: nos integri et indomiti et libertatem  non in poenitentiam laturi, primo statim congressu nonne ostendamus, quos  sibi Caledonia viros seposuerit? An eandem Romanis in bello virtutem,  quam in pace lasciviam adesse creditis?\"    XXXII. \"Nostris illi dissensionibus ac discordiis clari, vitia hostium in  gloriam exercitus sui vertunt: quem contractum ex diversissimis gentibus,  ut secundae res tenent, ita adversae dissolvent: nisi si Gallos et  Germanos et (pudet dictu) Britannorum plerosque, licet dominationi  alienae sanguinem commodent, diutius tamen hostes quam servos, fide et  affectu teneri putatis: metus et terror est, infirma vincula caritatis  quae ubi removeris, qui timere desierint, odisse incipient. Omnia  victoriae incitamenta pro nobis sunt: nullae Romanos conjuges accendunt;  nulli parentes fugam exprobraturi sunt; aut nulla plerisque patria, aut  alia est. Paucos numero, trepidos ignorantia, coelum ipsum ac mare et  silvas, ignota omnia circumspectantes, clausos quodammodo ac vinctos dii  nobis tradiderunt. Ne terreat vanus aspectus et auri fulgor atque  argenti, quod neque tegit neque vulnerat. In ipsa hostium acie inveniemus  nostras manus: agnoscent Britanni suam causam: recordabuntur Galli  priorem libertatem: deserent illos ceteri Germani, tanquam nuper Usipii  reliquerunt. Nec quidquam ultra formidinis: vacua castella, senum  coloniae, inter male parentes et injuste imperantes aegra municipia et  discordantia: hic dux, hic exercitus: ibi tributa et metalla et ceterae  servientium poenae: quas in aeternum perferre aut statim ulcisci in hoc  campo est. Proinde ituri in aciem et majores vestros et posteros  cogitate.\"    XXXIII. Excepere orationem alacres, ut barbaris moris, cantu et fremitu  clamoribusque dissonis. Jam que agmina, et armorum fulgores audentissimi  cujusque procursu: simul instruebantur acies: cum Agricola, quanquam  laetum et vix munimentis coercitum militem adhortatus, ita disseruit:  \"Octavus annus est, commilitones, ex quo virtute et auspiciis imperii  Romani fide atque opera vestra Britanniam vicistis: tot expeditionibus,  tot proeliis, seu fortitudine adversus hostes seu patientia ac labore  paene adversus ipsam rerum naturam opus fuit, neque me militum neque vos  ducis poenituit. Ergo egressi, ego veterum legatorum, vos priorum  exercituum terminos, finem Britanniae non fama nec rumore, sed castris et  armis tenemus. Inventa Britannia et subacta. Equidem saepe in agmine, cum  vos paludes montesve et flumina fatigarent, fortissimi cujusque voces  audiebam, Quando dabitur hostis, quando acies? Veniunt, e latebris suis  extrusi: et vota virtusque in aperto, omniaque prona victoribus, atque  eadem victis adversa. Nam, ut superasse tantum itineris, silvas evasisse,  transisse aestuaria pulchrum ac decorum in frontem; ita fugientibus  periculosissima, quae hodie prosperrima sunt. Neque enim nobis aut  locorum eadem notitia aut commeatuum eadem abundantia: sed manus et arma  et in his omnia. Quod ad me attinet, jam pridem mihi decretum est, neque  exercitus neque ducis terga tuta esse. Proinde et honesta mors turpi vita  potior; et incolumitas ac decus eodem loco sita sunt: nec inglorium  fuerit, in ipso terrarum ac naturae fine cecidisse.\"    XXXIV. \"Si novae gentes atque ignota acies constitisset, aliorum  exercituum exemplis vos hortarer: nunc vestra decora recensete, vestros  oculos interrogate. Ii sunt, quos proximo anno, unam legionem furto  noctis aggressos, clamore debellastis: ii ceterorum Britannorum  fugacissimi, ideoque tam diu superstites. Quomodo silvas saltusque  penetrantibus fortissimum quodque animal contra ruere, pavida et inertia  ipso agminis sono pelluntur, sic acerrimi Britannorum jam pridem  ceciderunt: reliquus est numerus ignavorum et metuentium, quos quod  tandem invenistis, non restiterunt, sed deprehensi sunt: novissimae res  et extremo metu corpora defixere aciem in his vestigiis, in quibus  pulchram et spectabilem victoriam ederetis. Transigite cum  expeditionibus: imponite quinquaginta annis magnum diem: approbate  reipublicae nunquam exercitui imputari potuisse aut moras belli aut  causas rebellandi.\"    XXXV. Et alloquente adhuc Agricola, militum ardor eminebat, et finem  orationis ingens alacritas consecuta est, statimque ad arma discursum.  Instinctos ruentesque ita disposuit, ut peditum auxilia, quae octo  millia erant, mediam aciem firmarent, equitum tria millia cornibus  affunderentur: legiones pro vallo stetere, ingens victoriae decus citra  Romanum sanguinem bellanti, et auxilium, si pellerentur. Britannorum  acies, in speciem simul ac terrorem, editioribus locis constiterat  ita, ut primum agmen aequo, ceteri per acclive jugum connexi velut  insurgerent: media campi covinarius et eques strepitu ac discursu  complebat. Tum Agricola superante hostium multitudine veritus, ne simul  in frontem, simul et latera suorum pugnaretur, diductis ordinibus,  quanquam porrectior acies futura erat et arcessendas plerique legiones  admonebant, promptior in spem et"]]]
