PENDANT HOISTED.    Having received his orders Cook proceeded to Deptford and hoisted his  pendant on H.M.S. Endeavour on 27th May, and at once started to prepare  for sea. A considerable quantity of coal was taken on board to use for  drying the ship, as it occupied so much less room than wood.    Captain Wallis returned from his voyage round the world about this time,  and in consequence of his report, the Island of Georgeland, afterwards  called by Cook Otaheite and now Tahiti, was fixed upon by the Royal  Society as the most desirable place for the observations, and the  Admiralty were requested to issue the proper orders, notifying at the  same time that Mr. Charles Green and Lieutenant James Cook had been  appointed observers. They also in the same letter write that:    \"Joseph Banks, Esquire, Fellow of this Society, a Gentleman of large  fortune, who is well versed in Natural History, being desirous of  undertaking the same voyage, the council very earnestly request their  Lordships that in regard to Mr. Banks' great personal merit and for the  advancement of useful knowledge, he also, together with his suite, being  seven persons more (that is eight persons in all) together with their  baggage, be received on board of the ship under command of Captain Cook.\"    They also requested that the expedition might be landed a month or six  weeks before the 3rd June in order that the instruments might be got into  proper working order, and for fear the ship might not be able to reach  Georgeland, a table of the limits within which the observations might be  taken, was enclosed. Full instructions were also given to the two  observers, and a list of the fixed stars to be observed was drawn up by  Mr. Maskelyne.    The order to receive Mr. Green and Mr. Banks and party was issued on 22nd  July, \"for victuals only\"--i.e., they were to be supplied with the same  as the rest of the ship's company whilst on board. The members of Banks's  party were: Dr. Solander, naturalist; H. Sporing, assistant naturalist;  A. Buchan, S. Parkinson, and Jno. Reynolds, artists; James Roberts and  Peter Briscoe, white servants; Thomas Richmond and J. Dorlton, coloured  servants.    It was owing to the personal friendship between them that Banks was  permitted by Lord Sandwich, the First Lord of the Admiralty, to accompany  Cook. He had taken up the study of Botany when at Eton, and at an early  age had been elected F.R.S. He seems quickly to have formed a just  estimate of Cook's worth; indeed, Sir John Barrow says he took a liking  to him at the first interview, and a firm friendship sprang up between  them which endured to the end. Many instances are to be found of his  interest in and his support to Cook after their return home; and this  friendship speaks volumes for Cook, for, though Banks was a most kindly  natured man, he had at times a very overbearing manner.    Sir Joseph Hooker, in his introduction, quotes a most interesting letter  from Mr. John Ellis, F.R.S., to Linnaeus, the great botanist, in which he  says that Mr. Banks, a gentleman of 6000 pounds a year, has persuaded Dr.  Solander to go out with him to the South Seas to collect \"all the natural  curiosities of the place,\" and after the observations are taken, they are  \"to proceed on further discoveries.\" He goes on to mention the library of  Natural History and splendid outfit Banks is taking, and says, \"in short,  Solander assured me this expedition would cost Mr. Banks 10,000 pounds.\"    The Endeavour left Deptford on 21st July, and, calling at Galleons Reach,  took in her guns and gunners' stores. Her armament was originally to have  been six carriage guns, four pounders, and eight swivels, but they were  increased to ten carriage guns and eight swivels, and at Plymouth four  more swivels were added for use in the boats. The complement of men was  also increased to 85, including 12 marines who were to join at Plymouth,  and a third Lieutenant had been appointed in July.    She had dropped down the river and anchored in the Downs on 3rd August,  Cook joining her on the 7th and, discharging his pilot, sailed the next  day. He had a very tedious passage down the Channel, and did not arrive a  Plymouth till the 14th, when he immediately sent word to Messrs. Banks  and Solander, who were still in London, that he was ready for sea, and  was only waiting for a fair wind to sail. They therefore started at once,  their baggage being already on board, and joined Cook on 20th August.    CREW WELL SATISFIED.    Having received his extra guns, marines, twelve barrels of powder, and  other stores, Cook mustered his men, paid them two months advance, and  explained to them that they were not to expect any additional pay for the  intended voyage. He says, \"they were well satisfied, and expressed great  cheerfulness and readiness to prosecute the voyage.\"    The orders under which he sailed were secret, and, unfortunately, are not  to be found. Admiral Wharton says the covering letter is in existence,  but the orders which should be on the next page are missing. Cook writes:    \"I was ordered, therefore, to proceed directly to Otaheite; and, after  the astronomical observations should be completed, to prosecute the  design of making discoveries in the South Pacific Ocean by proceeding to  the South as far as the latitude of 40 degrees: then, if I found no land,  to proceed to the west between 40 and 35 degrees till I fell in with New  Zealand, which I was to explore, and thence return to England by such  route as I should think proper.\"    His last letter to the Admiralty, before leaving England, was written on  the day of his arrival at Plymouth, informing them of that fact, and  announcing his intention of proceeding to sea with all possible despatch.      CHAPTER 7. 1768 TO 1769. PLYMOUTH TO OTAHEITE.    After waiting for some days for a fair wind, Cook eventually sailed at 2  P.M. on 26th August, having, as he says in his Journal, \"94 persons,  including officers, seamen, Gentlemen and their servants; near 18 months'  provisions, 10 carriage guns, 12 swivels, with good store of ammunition,  and stores of all kinds\" on board. On 1st September they had heavy gales  lasting for about four-and-twenty hours, and a small boat belonging to  the boatswain was washed away, and \"between three and four dozen of our  poultry, which was worst of all,\" were drowned. The ship was found to be  very leaky in her upper works, and the sails in the store got very wet.  Banks notes that they caught two birds in the rigging that had evidently  been blown off the coast of Spain. On 13th September they anchored in  Funchal Roads, and during the night \"the Bend of the Hawser of the stream  anchor slip'd owing to the carelessness of the person who made it fast.\"  The anchor was hauled up into a boat in the morning, and carried further  out, but, unfortunately, in heaving it into the water, a Master's mate,  named Weir, got entangled in the buoy rope, was carried overboard, and  drowned before any assistance could be rendered.    Whilst shifting her berth to a more convenient spot, the Endeavour was  fired on by one of the forts owing to some misunderstanding, but  satisfactory apologies and explanations were made, and it was thought so  little of that neither Cook nor Banks mention it in their Journals. This  incident is probably the origin of the story told by Forster in his  Journal of the Second Voyage. He says:    \"Captain Cook in the Endeavour battered the Loo Fort at Madeira in  conjunction with an English Frigate, thus resenting an affront which had  been offered to the British flag.\"    When the Endeavour arrived at Funchal, the only British man-of-war there  was H.M.S. Rose, which sailed the following day with her convoy, and  neither her Captain's Journal nor his ship's log make any reference  whatever to a dispute with the Portuguese. No other British man-of-war  came into the port whilst the Endeavour was there, and afterwards, at  Rio, Cook expressly informed the Viceroy that he had been well received  by the Portuguese at Madeira.    Fresh water, meat, vegetables, and wine were taken on board; wine, fruit,  and water being good and cheap, but the meat and poultry, obtained as a  favour, were dear. Two men, a marine and a sailor, received twelve lashes  for refusing to eat their allowance of fresh meat. This appears to be  harsh treatment, but it must be remembered that the lash was at that time  almost the only recognised method of punishment in the Navy, however  trivial the offence might be; and Cook knew from experience how important  it was to prevent the scurvy from getting foothold on board, and he  already had determined to fight, by every means in his power, this dread  scourge, almost his most dangerous foe. He did conquer it even on this  first voyage, and, considering his means, in a most marvellous manner. He  would have claimed the victory had it not been for an untoward event,  which will be told hereafter, leading him to postpone his claim till he  could give further proof. It is important to notice how on every possible  occasion he obtained, wherever he could, some change of diet and fresh  water.    EDEN BEFORE THE FALL.    Whilst they were at Funchal, Banks spent five days with the English  Consul, and he describes the place as very pretty, but the people as  primitive, idle, and uninformed; all their instruments of the rudest  make; and he thought that the appliances used in the manufacture of wine  must have been similar to those used by Noah, \"although it is not  impossible that he might have used better if he remembered the methods he  had seen before the flood.\" One of the Governors left it on record that,  so averse from change were the people, he thought it most fortunate the  island was not Eden before the fall, as in that case the"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/10843"],[0,"The Mental Life of Monkeys and Apes: A Study of Ideational Behavior (#13)"],[1," |   |   |   |   |    20    |

[Footnote *: Aided by experimenter.]              2. Sobke, _Pithecus rhesus_      _Problem 1. First at the Left End_    Sobke was somewhat afraid of the experimenter when the investigation was  undertaken, and instead of willingly coming out of his cage when the  door was raised, he often had to be coaxed out and lured into the  apparatus with food. Whereas Skirrl was frank and rather aggressive,  Sobke was stealthy in his movements, furtive, and evidently suspicious  of the experimenter as well as of the apparatus. He was perfectly safe  to approach, but would not permit anyone to touch him. After a few days,  he began to take food from the hands of the experimenter.    Preliminary work to acquaint this monkey with the routine of the  experiment was begun on April 13. As in the case of Skirrl, he was lured  into the apparatus and was taught the route through the boxes to the  starting point by being allowed to obtain food once each day in each of  the nine boxes. The procedure was simple. The entrance door and the exit  door of a particular box were raised and the animal admitted to the  reaction-compartment and permitted to pass through the box whose doors  stood open, take its food, and return to the starting point. Sobke very  quickly learned the route perfectly and came to work steadily and  rapidly. After five days of preliminary work of this sort, he was so  thoroughly accustomed to the apparatus that it was evidently desirable  to begin with regular training experiments.    The first series of trials was given on April 19. Both punishment and  reward were employed from the first. The punishment consisted of  confinement for thirty seconds in each wrong box, and the reward of a  small piece of banana, usually not more than a tenth of a medium sized  banana for each correct choice. The total time for the first series of  trials was fourteen minutes. This indicates that Sobke worked rapidly.  My notes record that he worked quickly though shyly, wasted almost no  time, made few errors of choice, and waited quietly during confinement  in the boxes. In this, also, he differed radically from Skirrl who was  restless and always tried to escape from confinement.    Throughout the work on problem 1, punishment and reward were kept  constant. Everything progressed smoothly; there were no such  irregularities of behavior as appeared in the case of Skirrl, and  consequently the description of results is a relatively simple matter.  Sobke invariably chose the end boxes. His performance was in every way  superior to that of Skirrl.    As previously, the detailed results are presented in tabular form (table  4). From this table it appears that, whereas the expected ratio of right  to wrong first choices for this problem is 1 to 2.5, the actual ratio  for Sobke's first series was 1 to .67. This surprisingly good showing is  unquestionably due to his marked tendency to choose the end box of a  group; and this tendency, in turn, may in part be the result of the  preliminary training, for during that only one box was open each time.  But, if the preliminary training were responsible for Sobke's tendency,  it should be noted that it had very different effect upon Skirrl, and,  as will be seen later, upon Julius.    The results for the ten different settings of the doors for problem 1 as  they appear in table 4 are of interest for a number of reasons. In the  first place, the setting 1. 2. 3 appearing twice,--at the beginning of  the series and again at the end--yielded markedly different results in  the two positions. For whereas no mistakes were made in the case of  setting 1, there were fifty per cent of incorrect first choices for  setting 10. Again, satisfactory explanation is impossible. It is  conceivable that fatigue or approaching satiety may have had something  to do with the failures at the end of the series, but as a rule, as is  indicated by settings 1, 2, and 6, if correct choices were made at the  beginning, they continued throughout the day's work.    In this problem, Sobke's"]]]
