She rose to her feet.    \"Does--this man--know of your intention?\" asked Miss Mary, suddenly.    \"No, nor cares. He has never even seen the child to know it.\"    \"Go to him at once--tonight--now! Tell him what you have done. Tell him  I have taken his child, and tell him--he must never see--see--the child  again. Wherever it may be, he must not come; wherever I may take it, he  must not follow! There, go now, please--I'm weary, and--have much yet to  do!\"    They walked together to the door. On the threshold the woman turned.    \"Good night.\"    She would have fallen at Miss Mary's feet. But at the same moment the  young girl reached out her arms, caught the sinful woman to her own pure  breast for one brief moment, and then closed and locked the door.      It was with a sudden sense of great responsibility that Profane Bill  took the reins of the Slumgullion Stage the next morning, for the  schoolmistress was one of his passengers. As he entered the highroad, in  obedience to a pleasant voice from the \"inside,\" he suddenly reined up  his horses and respectfully waited as Tommy hopped out at the command of  Miss Mary. \"Not that bush, Tommy--the next.\"    Tommy whipped out his new pocketknife, and, cutting a branch from a tall  azalea bush, returned with it to Miss Mary.    \"All right now?\"    \"All right.\"    And the stage door closed on the Idyl of Red Gulch.          BROWN OF CALAVERAS      A subdued tone of conversation, and the absence of cigar smoke and boot  heels at the windows of the Wingdam stagecoach, made it evident that  one of the inside passengers was a woman. A disposition on the part  of loungers at the stations to congregate before the window, and some  concern in regard to the appearance of coats, hats, and collars, further  indicated that she was lovely. All of which Mr. Jack Hamlin, on the  box seat, noted with the smile of cynical philosophy. Not that he  depreciated the sex, but that he recognized therein a deceitful element,  the pursuit of which sometimes drew mankind away from the equally  uncertain blandishments of poker--of which it may be remarked that Mr.  Hamlin was a professional exponent.    So that when he placed his narrow boot on the wheel and leaped down,  he did not even glance at the window from which a green veil was  fluttering, but lounged up and down with that listless and grave  indifference of his class, which was, perhaps, the next thing to good  breeding. With his closely buttoned figure and self-contained air he  was a marked contrast to the other passengers, with their feverish  restlessness and boisterous emotion; and even Bill Masters, a graduate  of Harvard, with his slovenly dress, his overflowing vitality, his  intense appreciation of lawlessness and barbarism, and his mouth filled  with crackers and cheese, I fear cut but an unromantic figure beside  this lonely calculator of chances, with his pale Greek face and Homeric  gravity.    The driver called \"All aboard!\" and Mr. Hamlin returned to the coach.  His foot was upon the wheel, and his face raised to the level of the  open window, when, at the same moment, what appeared to him to be the  finest eyes in the world suddenly met his. He quietly dropped down  again, addressed a few words to one of the inside passengers, effected  an exchange of seats, and as quietly took his place inside. Mr. Hamlin  never allowed his philosophy to interfere with decisive and prompt  action.    I fear that this irruption of Jack cast some restraint upon the other  passengers--particularly those who were making themselves most agreeable  to the lady. One of them leaned forward, and apparently conveyed to  her information regarding Mr. Hamlin's profession in a single epithet.  Whether Mr. Hamlin heard it, or whether he recognized in the informant  a distinguished jurist from whom, but a few evenings before, he had won  several thousand dollars, I cannot say. His colorless face betrayed no  sign; his black eyes, quietly observant, glanced indifferently past the  legal gentleman, and rested on the much more pleasing features of  his neighbor. An Indian stoicism--said to be an inheritance from his  maternal ancestor--stood him in good service, until the rolling wheels  rattled upon the river gravel at Scott's Ferry, and the stage drew up at  the International Hotel for dinner. The legal gentleman and a member of  Congress leaped out, and stood ready to assist the descending goddess,  while Colonel Starbottle, of Siskiyou, took charge of her parasol and  shawl. In this multiplicity of attention there was a momentary confusion  and delay. Jack Hamlin quietly opened the OPPOSITE door of the coach,  took the lady's hand--with that decision and positiveness which a  hesitating and undecided sex know how to admire--and in an instant had  dexterously and gracefully swung her to the ground, and again lifted her  to the platform. An audible chuckle on the box, I fear, came from  that other cynic, \"Yuba Bill,\" the driver. \"Look keerfully arter that  baggage, Kernel,\" said the expressman, with affected concern, as he  looked after Colonel Starbottle, gloomily bringing up the rear of the  triumphant procession to the waiting-room.    Mr. Hamlin did not stay for dinner. His horse was already saddled, and  awaiting him. He dashed over the ford, up the gravelly hill, and  out into the dusty perspective of the Wingdam road, like one leaving  pleasant fancy behind him. The inmates of dusty cabins by the roadside  shaded their eyes with their hands and looked after him, recognizing the  man by his horse, and speculating what \"was up with Comanche Jack.\" Yet  much of this interest centered in the horse, in a community where  the time made by \"French Pete's\" mare in his run from the Sheriff of  Calaveras eclipsed all concern in the ultimate fate of that worthy.    The sweating flanks of his gray at length recalled him to himself. He  checked his speed, and, turning into a by-road, sometimes used as a  cutoff, trotted leisurely along, the reins hanging listlessly from  his fingers. As he rode on, the character of the landscape changed and  became more pastoral. Openings in groves of pine and sycamore disclosed  some rude attempts at cultivation--a flowering vine trailed over the  porch of one cabin, and a woman rocked her cradled babe under the roses  of another. A little farther on Mr. Hamlin came upon some barelegged  children wading in the willowy creek, and so wrought upon them with a  badinage peculiar to himself that they were emboldened to climb up  his horse's legs and over his saddle, until he was fain to develop an  exaggerated ferocity of demeanor, and to escape, leaving behind some  kisses and coin. And then, advancing deeper into the woods, where all  signs of habitation failed, he began to sing--uplifting a tenor so  singularly sweet, and shaded by a pathos so subduing and tender, that I  wot the robins and linnets stopped to listen. Mr. Hamlin's voice was not  cultivated; the subject of his song was some sentimental lunacy borrowed  from the Negro minstrels; but there thrilled through all some occult  quality of tone and expression that was unspeakably touching. Indeed, it  was a wonderful sight to see this sentimental blackleg, with a pack of  cards in his pocket and a revolver at his back, sending his voice before  him through the dim woods with a plaint about his \"Nelly's grave\" in a  way that overflowed the eyes of the listener. A sparrow hawk, fresh from  his sixth victim, possibly recognizing in Mr. Hamlin a kindred spirit,  stared at him in surprise, and was fain to confess the superiority of  man. With a superior predatory capacity, HE couldn't sing.    But Mr. Hamlin presently found himself again on the highroad, and at his  former pace. Ditches and banks of gravel, denuded hillsides, stumps,  and decayed trunks of trees, took the place of woodland and ravine, and  indicated his approach to civilization. Then a church steeple came in  sight, and he knew that he had reached home. In a few moments he was  clattering down the single narrow street that lost itself in a chaotic  ruin of races, ditches, and tailings at the foot of the hill, and  dismounted before the gilded windows of the \"Magnolia\" saloon. Passing  through the long barroom, he pushed open a green-baize door, entered a  dark passage, opened another door with a passkey, and found himself in  a dimly lighted room whose furniture, though elegant and costly for the  locality, showed signs of abuse. The inlaid center table was overlaid  with stained disks that were not contemplated in the original design.  The embroidered armchairs were discolored, and the green velvet lounge,  on which Mr. Hamlin threw himself, was soiled at the foot with the red  soil of Wingdam.    Mr. Hamlin did not sing in his cage. He lay still, looking at a highly  colored painting above him representing a young creature of opulent  charms. It occurred to him then, for the first time, that he had never  seen exactly that kind of a woman, and that if he should, he would not,  probably, fall in love with her. Perhaps he was thinking of another  style of beauty. But just then someone knocked at the door. Without  rising, he pulled a cord that apparently shot back a bolt, for the door  swung open, and a man entered.    The newcomer was broad-shouldered and robust--a vigor not borne out in  the face, which, though handsome, was singularly weak, and disfigured by  dissipation. He appeared to be also under the influence of liquor, for  he started on seeing Mr. Hamlin, and said, \"I thought Kate was here,\"  stammered, and seemed confused and embarrassed.    Mr. Hamlin smiled the smile which he had before worn on the Wingdam  coach, and sat up, quite refreshed and ready for business.    \"You didn't come up on the stage,\" continued the newcomer, \"did you?\"    \"No,\" replied Hamlin; \"I left it at Scott's Ferry. It isn't due for half  an hour yet. But how's luck, Brown?\"    \"Damn bad,"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/13121"],[0,"A Voyage to Terra Australis — Volume 2 (#13)"],[1,"steered to pass within Aken's  Island, intending to anchor in the West Bight behind it; but the depth  not being sufficient for the ship at low water, we came to in 4 fathoms,  muddy bottom, one mile from the shore and two from Aken's Island, the  east end of which bore N. 27 deg. W.    Pine Mount is a single round hill with a high peaked top, standing about  two miles inland from the West Bight; and to obtain a set of bearings  from it which should cross those from Mount Westall, had induced me to  anchor here; but finding my health too much impaired by fatigue to  accomplish a laborious walk, I sent the launch next morning [FRIDAY 3  SEPTEMBER 1802] with the scientific gentlemen, and as an easier task,  landed upon Aken's Island and took angles from the little eminence at its  north-east end.    At every port or bay we entered, more especially after passing Cape  Capricorn, my first object on landing was to examine the refuse thrown up  by the sea. The French navigator, La Perouse, whose unfortunate  situation, if in existence, was always present to my mind, had been  wrecked, as it was thought, somewhere in the neighbourhood of New  Caledonia; and if so, the remnants of his ships were likely to be brought  upon this coast by the trade winds, and might indicate the situation of  the reef or island which had proved fatal to him. With such an  indication, I was led to believe in the possibility of finding the place;  and though the hope of restoring La Perouse or any of his companions to  their country and friends could not, after so many years, be rationally  entertained, yet to gain some certain knowledge of their fate would do  away the pain of suspense; and it might not be too late to retrieve some  documents of their discoveries.    Upon the south-east side of Aken's Island, there was thrown up a confused  mass of different substances; including a quantity of pumice stone,  several kinds of coral, five or six species of shells, skeletons of fish  and sea snakes, the fruit of the pandanus, and a piece of cocoa-nut shell  without bernacles or any thing to indicate that it had been long in the  water; but there were no marks of shipwreck. A seine was hauled upon the  small beaches at the south end of the island, and brought on shore a good  quantity of mullet, and of a fish resembling a cavally; also a kind of  horse mackerel, small fish of the herring kind, and once a sword fish of  between four and five feet long. The projection of the snout, or sword of  this animal, a foot and a half in length, was fringed with strong, sharp  teeth; and he threw it from side to side in such a furious way, that it  was difficult to manage him even on shore.    A boat was sent in the evening to the foot of Pine Mount, for the  naturalist and his party, but returned without any tidings of them; and  it was noon next day [SATURDAY 4 SEPTEMBER 1802] before they got on  board. They had reached the top of the mount, but were disappointed in  the view by the pines and underwood. In returning to the boat, a chase  after a kangaroo had led one of the gentlemen out of his reckoning; and  this, with the labour of bringing down their prize, had prevented them  from reaching the water side that night. Pine Mount is stony, but covered  with large trees of the kind denoted by its epithet; the country between  it and the water side is grassy, bears timber trees, and is of a  tolerably good soil, such as might be cultivated. There are small creeks  of salt water in the low land; and in one of them a fish was shot which  furnished the party with a dinner.    Pine Mount is composed of the _greenstone_ of the German mineralogists;  but in some other parts of the neighbourhood the stone seems to be  different, and contains small veins of quartz, pieces of which are also  scattered over the surface. At Aken's Island there was some variety. The  most common kind was a slate, containing in some places veins of quartz,  in a state nearly approaching to crystallization, and in others some  metallic substance, probably iron. The basis of most other parts of the  island was _greenstone_; but in the eastern cliffs there was a soft,  whitish earth; and on the north-west side of the island, a part of the  shore consisted of water-worn grains and small lumps of quartz, of coral,  pumice stone, and other substances jumbled together, and concreted into a  solid mass.    Speaking in general terms of Shoal-water Bay, I do not conceive it to  offer any advantages to ships which may not be had upon almost any other  part of the coast; except that the tides rise higher, and in the winter  season fish are more plentiful than further to the south. No fresh water  was found, unless at a distance from the shore, and then only in small  quantities. Pine trees are plentiful; but they grow upon the stony hills  at a distance from the water side, and cannot be procured with any thing  like the facility offered by Port Bowen. The chart contains the best  information I am able to give of the channels leading up the bay, and of  the shoals between them; but it may be added, that no alarm need be  excited by a ship getting aground, for these banks are too soft to do  injury. The shelving flats from the shores are also soft; and with the  mangroves, which spread themselves from high water at the neaps, up in  the country to the furthest reach of the spring tides, in some places for  miles, render landing impossible in the upper parts of the bay, except at  some few spots already noticed.    Were an English settlement to be made in Shoal-water Bay, the better soil  round Pine Mount and the less difficulty in landing there, would cause  that neighbourhood to be preferred. There is not a sufficient depth at  low water, for ships to go into the West Bight, by the south side of  Aken's Island, and the north side was no otherwise sounded than in  passing; but there is little doubt that the depth on the north side is  adequate to admit ships, and that some parts of the bight will afford  anchorage and good shelter.    The tides do not run strong in Shoal-water Bay, the rate seldom exceeding  one knot; but they stir up the soft mud at the bottom., and make the  water thick, as in Keppel Bay. I am not able to speak very accurately of  the rise in the tide; but it may be reckoned at twelve or fourteen feet  at the neaps, and from seventeen to eighteen at the springs. High water  takes place about _ten hours and a half after_ the moon's passage; but on  the east side of the bay, the flood runs up a full hour later.    The _latitude_ of the north-east end of Aken's Island, from an  observation in the artificial horizon, is 22 deg. 21' 35\" south.    _Longitude_ from twelve sets of distances of the sun and moon, taken by  lieutenant Flinders, and reduced to the same place, 150 deg. 18' 45\"; but  from the survey, and the position afterwards fixed in Broad Sound, it is  preferably 150 deg. 15' 0\" east.    _Variation_ from azimuths taken with a theodolite at the same place, 9 deg.  48'; but the bearings on the top of the eminence showed it to be 9 deg. 0'.  The variation on shore, on the _west_ side of the bay, may therefore be  taken at 9 deg. 24' east.    Upon Mount Westall on the east side, and at the south end of Leicester  Island, it was from the bearings 8 deg. 50'. Upon the small islet at the head  of the bay, 9 deg. 25'.    At our anchorage on the west side of the bay, Mr. Flinders took azimuths  when the ship's head was S. E. by E., which gave 6 deg. 31' by one compass;  before he had done, the ship swung to the flood tide with her head W. N.  W., and two other compasses then gave 11 deg. 27' and 11 deg. 4': the mean  corrected to the meridian, will be 8 deg. 46' east.    At an anchorage towards the east side of the bay, the same officer  observed the variation with two compasses, when the head was east, to be  4 deg. 49', or corrected, 7 deg. 21' east.    The difference in Strong-tide Passage, where the land was one mile to the  south-south-east on one side, and the same to the west on the other, was  still more remarkable; for when the head was N. E. by N., an amplitude  gave me 9 deg. 10', or corrected, 10 deg. 34' east.    There might have been an error in any of the ship observations of half a  degree; but I am persuaded that the attraction of the land, sometimes to  the east and sometimes west, as the ship was near one or the other side  of the bay, was the great cause of the difference in the corrected  results; and it will presently be seen, that the effect on a neighbouring  part of the coast was much more considerable.

THIRSTY SOUND.]    SATURDAY 4 SEPTEMBER 1802    At noon September 4, when the botanical gentlemen returned from their  excursion to Pine Mount, we made sail out of Shoal-water Bay with a  breeze from the eastward. In steering north-west amongst the small  islands, the soundings were between 9 and 14 fathoms; and nearly the same  afterwards, in keeping at three or four miles from the coast. I intended  to go into Thirsty Sound; but not reaching it before dark, the anchor was  dropped in 8 fathoms, sandy bottom, when the top of Pier Head bore west,  three miles. In the morning [SUNDAY 5 SEPTEMBER 1802] we ran into the  Sound, and anchored in 6 fathoms, with the points of entrance bearing N.  16 deg. and S. 67 deg. E., one mile.
