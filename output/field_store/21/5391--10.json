But, beyond doubt, all persons are potential  murderers, needing only time and circumstances, and a sufficiently  overwhelming emotion that will triumph over the weak restraints that  education and habit have built up, to control the powerful surging  instincts and feelings that Nature has laid at the foundation of life.          XI    SEX CRIMES      Most of the inmates of prisons convicted of sex crimes are the poor and  wretched and the plainly defective. Nature, in her determination to  preserve the species, has planted sex hunger very deep in the  constitution of man. The fact that it is necessary for the preservation  of life, and that Nature is always eliminating those whose sex hunger is  not strong enough to preserve the race, has overweighted man and perhaps  all animal life with this hunger. At least it has endowed many men with  instincts too powerful for the conventions and the laws that hedge him  about.    Rape is almost always the crime of the poor, the hardworking, the  uneducated and the abnormal. In the man of this type sex hunger is  strong; he has little money, generally no family; he is poorly fed and  clothed and possesses few if any attractions. He may be a sailor away  from women and their society for months, or in some other remote  occupation making his means of gratifying this hunger just as  impossible. There is no opportunity for him except the one he adopts. It  is a question of gratifying this deep and primal instinct as against  the weakness of his mentality and the few barriers that a meagre  education and picked-up habits can furnish; and when the instinct  overbalances he is lost.    Incest, which is peculiarly the crime of the weak, the wretched and the  poor, has a somewhat different origin. Westermarck in his \"_History of  Human Marriage_\" shows that in the early tribe there was no inhibition  against the marriage of blood relations; that the restriction then was  against the members of the tribe that used one tent; these might or  might not be blood relations. The traditions and folk-ways against the  marriage of close relations grew from the familiarity that came from the  living together of brother and sister, for instance, in one home. This  feeling gradually worked itself into custom and habit and from that into  folk-ways and laws. Sometimes we read accounts of the marriage of a man  and woman who found, after years had gone by, that they were brother and  sister who had been separated in infancy and grew up without knowledge  of their relation to each other. Whether Nature forbids the marriage of  relatives by preventing offspring or by producing imperfect offspring is  a doubtful question. Certain communities in Europe have lived together  so long that all are related and still they seem to thrive. Considering  the general custom and feeling on the subject, however, the man and  woman who know that they are closely related and who marry are different  and weaker than the others; and this may show in their offspring.  Although the subnormal may have no such feeling, they are judged by the  traditions and customs of the normal and on that judgment are sent to  prison.    Many sex crimes are charged to children in the adolescent age; children  who have no knowledge of sex and its development and are helpless in the  strength of their newly-discovered feelings. This class of offenders is  almost always the inferior and the poor who are moved by strong  instincts which they have not the natural feeling, the strength, the  education, nor the desire to withstand.    While most crimes against persons are not directly due to economic  causes, still the indirect effect of property is generally present in  these crimes as well as others. The fact that the poor and defective are  generally the subjects of prosecution and conviction in these offences  shows how closely economic conditions are related to all crimes.    Other criminal statutes are of more modern date, and as a rule involve  not much more than adultery, except in regard to the age of the girl  offender, which is generally placed below eighteen. Still the sex age of  neither boys nor girls can be fixed by a calendar. It depends really  upon development, which is not the same with all people or in all  environments. Many girls of sixteen are more mature and have more  experience of life than others of twenty. Most laws provide that below  sixteen one cannot give consent and that a sexual act is then rape. It  is doubtful if there should be any intermediate age between sixteen and  eighteen, where an act is not rape but still a minor offence.          XII    ROBBERY AND BURGLARY      Robbery and burglary are generally counted as crimes of violence, but  they should be properly classed under property crimes. Every motive that  leads to getting property in illegal ways applies to these crimes. There  is added to the regular causes of property crimes the element of danger  and adventure which makes a strong appeal to boys and men. I am inclined  to think that few mature men have committed one of these crimes, unless  they began criminal careers as boys. Such crimes especially appeal to  the activity and love of adventure which inhere in every boy. They are  committed for the most part by youths who have had almost no chance to  get the needed sport and physical experience incident to boyhood. The  foot-ball, base-ball, polo or golf player very seldom becomes a robber  or a burglar. Almost no rich man or rich man's son becomes a robber or a  burglar. Those who fall under this lure are mainly the denizens of the  streets, the railroad yards, the vacant lots, the casual workers who are  stimulated by a variety of conditions to get property unlawfully. Added  to this are almost invariably a defective heredity, vicious environment,  little education, and a total want of direction in the building up of  habits and inhibitions.    The robber or burglar who kills in the commission of crime is more  dangerous and harder to cure than the one who kills from passion or  malice. There is always the element of an occupation, for getting  property, and generally a love of adventure that is difficult to  overcome, except by a substantial change of social relations which makes  acquiring property easier for the class from which all these criminals  develop. The murder that comes from passion and feeling implies  situations and circumstances that are rarely strong enough to overcome  the restrictions against killing.          XIII    MAN AS A PREDATORY ANIMAL      Not less than eighty per cent of all crimes are property crimes, and it  seems probable that, of the rest, most arise from the same motives. If  we look at civilization as the result of that seesaw trend of the race  from \"Naturalism to Artificialism,\" we may get a flexible view of life  that will be in accordance with the facts, and will help us to get rid  of the arbitrary division of man's history into the three periods termed  Savagery, Barbarism and Civilization. However desirable this division  may be for historic purposes in general, it is only confusing in an  effort to study the nature of man.    In the life and origin of the race, the fact is always evidenced that  the Ego through its growth and persistence is always drawing to itself  from the current of environment all things which it feels desirable to  its life and growth. This must be a necessary condition of survival. In  the long journey from amoeba to man, any circumstance causing a complete  halt for even a brief period meant extinction, while even a persistent  interference produced a weakened organism, if not an arrest of  development.    This then is the origin of the \"Master Instinct,\" hunger. When we  consider the various emotions growing from the force of this vital urge,  as developed by adaptation to an ever-changing environment, we are able  to realize fully why it bulks so large in moulding and shaping the  destiny of the race.    All psychologists are agreed in classing under the nutritive instinct  such activities as acquisition, storing and hoarding. During a period  variously estimated as a quarter of a million to two million years, man  and his animal antecedents responded to the hunger instinct, in the  manner and by the same methods as did the various jungle animals. He  secured his prey by capture, or killed it wherever found, the one  condition being his power to get and to hold. Later tribal organization  arose, and food and shelter were held in common. But since the folk-ways  commended raiding and looting between alien tribes, here was presented  an alluring chance to secure both booty and glory to men trained in the  \"get and hold\" process of acquiring. For thousands of years life itself  depended upon this unerring exercise.    It was during the period outlined that man developed his big brain  (cerebrum) involving the central nervous system. Furthermore, it was  developed by, and trained to, these particular reactions. The  far-reaching control of the mind must be remembered, as upon this  through his racial heritage must be based his conflicting impulses.  These must be reckoned with in our conclusions with regard to  present-day behavior, economic or otherwise.    During the last thirty years, psychological laboratories, aided by  physiology, through oft-repeated experiments conducted with  newly-invented weighing and measuring instruments of marvelous accuracy,  have put us in possession of an array of facts unknown to students of  earlier periods, who sought the \"why and the how\" of man's erratic  actions as a social animal. It is constantly being demonstrated that  under given conditions, moved by appropriate stimuli, the human animal  inevitably and surely reacts the same as does inorganic matter. If we  understand \"intelligence\" to be the \"capacity to respond to new  conditions,\" we can measurably see and at least partly understand the "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/12058"],[0,"The Mahabharata of Krishna-Dwaipayana Vyasa Translated into English Prose (#13)"],[1,"  female elephant in the season of spring, or like that which happened in  days of yore between those lions among monkeys, the brothers Vali and  Sugriva. And both equally infuriate and both eager for victory, both  those combatants raised their arms resembling snakes furnished with five  hoods, and attacked each other with their nails and teeth, wrought up to  frenzy of wrath. Impetuously assailed by the powerful Kichaka in that  encounter, the resolute Bhima did not waver a single step. And locked in  each other's embraces and dragging each other, they fought on like two  mighty bulls. And having nails and teeth for their weapons, the  encounter between them was fierce and terrible like that of two furious  tigers. And felling each other in fury, they encountered each other like  a couple of elephants with rent temples. And the mighty Bhima then  seized Kichaka, and Kichaka, that foremost of strong persons threw Bhima  down with violence. And as those mighty combatants fought on, the crash  of their arms produced a loud noise that resembled the clatter of  splitting bamboos. Then Vrikodara throwing Kichaka down by main force  within the room, began to toss him about furiously even as a hurricane  tosseth a tree. And attacked thus in battle by the powerful Bhima,  Kichaka grew weak and began to tremble. For all that, however, he tugged  at the Pandava to the best of his power. And attacking Bhima, and making  him wave a little, the mighty Kichaka struck him with his knees and  brought him down to the ground. And overthrown by the powerful Kichaka,  Bhima quickly rose up like Yama himself with mace in hand. And thus that  powerful _Suta_ and the Pandava, intoxicated with strength and  challenging each other, grappled with each other at midnight in that  solitary place. And as they roared at each other in wrath, that  excellent and strong edifice began to shake every moment. And slapped on  the chest by the mighty Bhima, Kichaka fired with wrath moved not a  single pace. And bearing for a moment only that onslaught incapable of  being born on earth, the _Suta_, overpowered by Bhima's might, became  enfeebled. And seeing him waning weak, Bhima endued with great strength  forcibly drew Kichaka towards his breast, and began to press hard. And  breathing hard again and again in wrath, that best of victors,  Vrikodara, forcibly seized Kichaka by the hair. And having seized  Kichaka, the mighty Bhima began to roar like a hungry tiger that hath  killed a large animal. And finding him exceedingly exhausted, Vrikodara  bound him fast with his arms, as one binds a beast with a cord. And then  Bhima began for a long while, to whirl the senseless Kichaka, who began  to roar frightfully like a broken trumpet.[17] And in order to pacify  Krishna's wrath Vrikodara grasped Kichaka's throat with his arms and  began to squeeze it. And assailing with his knees the waist of that  worst of the Kichakas, all the limbs of whose body had been broken into  fragments and whose eye-lids were closed, Vrikodara slew him, as one  would slay a beast. And beholding Kichaka entirely motionless, the son  of Pandu began to roll him about on the ground. And Bhima then said,  'Slaying this wretch who intended to violate our wife,--this thorn in  the side of _Sairindhri_, I am freed from the debt I owed to my  brothers, and have attained perfect peace.' And having said this, that  foremost of men, with eyes red in wrath, relinquished his hold of  Kichaka, whose dress and ornaments had been thrown off his person, whose  eyes were rolling, and whose body was yet trembling. And that foremost  of mighty persons, squeezing his own hands, and biting his lips in rage,  again attacked his adversary and thrust his arms and legs and neck and  head into his body like the wielder of the _Pinaka_ reducing into  shapeless mass the deer, which form sacrifice had assumed in order to  escape his ire. And having crushed all his limbs, and reduced him into a  ball of flesh, the mighty Bhimasena showed him unto Krishna. And endued  with mighty energy that hero then addressed Draupadi, that foremost of  all women, saying, 'Come princess of Panchala, and see what hath become  of that lustful wretch!' And saying this, Bhima of terrible prowess  began to press with his feet the body of that wicked wight. And lighting  a torch then and showing Draupadi the body of Kichaka, that hero  addressed her, saying, 'O thou of tresses ending in beautiful curls,  those that solicit thee, endued as thou art with an excellent  disposition and every virtue, will be slain by me even as this Kichaka  hath been, O timid one.' And having accomplished that difficult task so  highly agreeable to Krishna--having indeed slain Kichaka and thereby  pacified his wrath, Bhima bade farewell to Krishna, the daughter of  Drupada, and quickly went back to the kitchen. And Draupadi also, that  best of women, having caused Kichaka to be slain had her grief removed  and experienced the greatest delight. And addressing the keepers of the  dancing-hall, she said, 'Come ye and behold Kichaka who had violated  after other people's wives lieth down here, slain by my Gandharva  husbands.' And hearing these words the guards of the dancing hall soon  came by thousands to that spot, torches in hand. And repairing to that  room, they beheld the lifeless Kichaka thrown on the ground, drenched  with blood. And beholding him without arms and legs, they were filled  with grief. And as they gazed at Kichaka, they were struck with  amazement. And seeing that superhuman act, viz., the overthrow of  Kichaka, they said, 'Where is his neck, and where are his legs?' And  beholding him in this plight they all concluded that he had been killed  by a Gandharva.\"        [17] _Weri_ means both a kettle-drum and a trumpet. The latter      however conveys a better meaning here.      SECTION XXII    Vaisampayana said, \"Then all the relatives of Kichaka, arriving at that  place, beheld him there and began to wail aloud, surrounding him on all  sides. And beholding Kichaka with every limb mangled, and lying like a  tortoise dragged to dry ground from the water, all of them were overcome  with exceeding fright, and the bristles of their bodies stood on end.  And seeing him crushed all over by Bhima, like a Danava by Indra, they  proceeded to take him outside, for performing his funeral obsequies. And  then those persons of the _Suta_ clan thus assembled together espied  Krishna of faultless limbs hard by, who stood reclining on a pillar. And  all the Kichakas assembled there, exclaimed, 'Let this unchaste woman be  slain for whom Kichaka hath himself lost his life. Or, without slaying  her here, let us cremate her with him that had lusted after her,--for it  behoveth us to accomplish in every way what is agreeable to that  deceased son of _Suta_.' And then they addressed Virata, saying, 'It is  for her sake that Kichaka hath lost his life. Let him, therefore, be  cremated along with her. It behoveth thee to grant this permission.'  Thus addressed by them, king Virata, O monarch, knowing fully well the  prowess of the _Suta_ gave his assent to _Sairindhri_ being burnt along  with the _Suta's_ son. And at this, the Kichakas approaching the  frightened and stupefied Krishna of lotus-like eyes, seized her with  violence. And binding that damsel of slender waist and placing her upon  the bier, they set out with great energy towards the cemetery. And, O  king, while thus forcibly carried towards the cemetery by those sons of  the _Suta_ tribe, the blameless and chaste Krishna living under the  protections of her lords, then wailed aloud for the help of her  husbands, saying, 'Oh, let Jaya, and Jayanta, and Vijaya and Jayatsena,  and Jayadvala listen to my words. The _Sutas_ are taking me away. Let  those illustrious Gandharvas endued with speed of hand, the clatter of  whose cars is loud and the twang of whose bowstrings in the midst of the  mighty conflict are heard like the roar of thunder, listen to my  words,--the _Sutas_ are taking me away!'\"    Vaisampayana continued, \"Hearing those sorrowful words and lamentations  of Krishna, Bhima, without a moment's reflection started up from his bed  and said, 'I have heard, O _Sairindhri_ the words thou hast spoken. Thou  hast, therefore, O timid lady, no more fear at the hands of the  _Sutas._'\"    Vaisampayana continued, \"Having said this, the mighty-armed Bhima  desirous of slaying the Kichakas, began to swell his body. And carefully  changing his attire, he went out of the palace by a wrong egress. And  climbing over a wall by the aid of a tree, he proceeded towards the  cemetery whither the Kichakas had gone. And having leapt over the wall,  and gone out of the excellent city, Bhima impetuously rushed to where  the _Sutas_ were. And, O monarch, proceeding towards the funeral pyre he  beheld a large tree, tall as palmyra-palm, with gigantic shoulders and  withered top. And that slayer of foes grasping with his arms that tree  measuring ten _Vyamas_, uprooted it, even like an elephant, and placed  it upon his shoulders. And taking up that tree with trunk and branches  and measuring ten _Vyamas_, that mighty hero rushed towards the _Sutas_,  like Yama himself, mace in hand. And by the impetus of his rush[18]  banians and peepals and _Kinsukas_ falling down on the earth lay in  clusters. And beholding that Gandharva approach them like a lion in  fury, all the _Sutas_ trembling with fear and greatly distressed, became  panic-struck. And they addressed each other, saying, 'Lo, the powerful  Gandharva cometh hither, filled with rage, and with an upraised tree in  hand. Let _Sairindhri_, therefore, from whom this danger of ours hath  arisen, be set free.' And beholding the tree that had been uprooted by  Bhimasena, they set Draupadi free and ran breathlessly towards the city.  And seeing them run away, Bhima, that mighty son of the Wind-god,  despatched, O foremost of kings, by means of that tree,"]]]
