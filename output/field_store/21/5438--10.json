He had been but a year in the post thus accepted, and amid      the pressure of other matters the contemplated arrangement      had never been completed. More than once in his last illness      did Pitt allude to his unfulfilled promise, and speak with      kindness of him to whom it had been made. Later on, when he      could no longer continuously articulate, he made the name      'Robert Ward' audible, and added signs for paper and ink.      His trembling hand having feebly traced a number of wandering      characters, and added what could be easily recognized as      his well-known signature, he sank back. The precious paper      (precious, whatever may have been its unknown import, as a      proof of remembrance at so solemn a moment) was afterward      handed over by the physician in attendance, Sir Walter      Farquhar, to Mr. Ward; and many a time did he declare, as he      displayed it to me, that he would give anything he valued most      in the world to be able to decipher its unformed characters.\"    Some posthumous compositions of Mr. Ward are appended to the Memoirs.  They consist of \"characters,\" similar to those of Chesterfield and  other writers, and of \"sketches\" and essays; these last being set in  a species of framework, intended to connect them into a series. They  are not the best specimens of the author's composition; and perhaps  were hardly worth publication. Allowance is to be made, as Mr. Phipps  remarks, for their unrevised state; and revision might have removed  crudities and imparted more closeness and strength. It would not,  however, have altered their main defects; which may be summed up  by saying that they belonged to another age, without reaching the  peculiar force and finish which alone can give interest to an obsolete  mode.

It was occasionally used in  churches before the introduction of the organ, which occurred early  in the fifteenth century. Written music came into use about the same  time, and both were loudly denounced by many of the old school-men as  unnecessary and vain innovations.           *       *       *       *       *    THE IVORY MINE:    A TALE OF THE FROZEN SEA.    I.--YAKOUTSK.    Yakoutsk is one of the principal cities of Siberia, a country the  name of which excites exaggerated ideas of sterility and desolation.  Watered by rivers, which in every direction do the work of railways,  with richly-wooded mountains and valleys, with green slopes,  cultivated fields, soft meadows, gardens, and grassy islands in  the great streams, with all the common vegetables in pretty fair  abundance, with an endless source of commerce in furs and ivory,  Siberia, except in its extreme northern provinces, presents, like  most other lands, a very considerable amount of compensation for  considerable rigor of climate. Yakoutsk is a completely northern town  on the great river Lena, with wide streets and miserable huts, all of  wood, in many of which ice is still used in winter for panes of glass.  A very eminent traveler tells us that on his visit there were 4000  people living in 500 houses; with three stone churches, two wooden  ones, and a convent. It had once an antiquity to show--the ancient  Ostrog or fortress built in 1647 by the Cossacks; but which menaced  ruin more and more every day, being not of stone, but of wood, and  at last disappeared. Even here progress is observable, and wretched  cabins give way gradually to houses, some of which are even elegantly  arranged in the interior. It is a great commercial center: from the  Anubra to Behring's Straits, from the banks of the Frozen Sea to Mount  Aldana, from Okhotsk and even Kamschatka, goods are brought hither,  consisting chiefly of furs, seals' teeth and mammoths' tusks, which  afford excellent ivory, all of which are sold in the summer to  itinerant traders, who give in return powerfully-flavored tobacco,  corn and flour, tea, sugar, strong drinks, Chinese silks and cottons,  cloth, iron and copper utensils, and glass.    The inhabitants of the town are chiefly traders, who buy of the  Yakouta hunters their furs at a cheap rate, and then sell them in  a mysterious kind of fashion to the agents who come from Russia in  search of them. During the annual fair they stow up their goods in  private rooms; and here the Irkoutsk men must come and find them.  These traders are the Russian inhabitants, the native Yakoutas being  the only artisans. In this distant colony of the human race, the  new-born child of a Russian is given to a Yakouta woman to nurse, and  when old enough, learns to read and write, after which he is brought  up to the fur trade, and his education is finished.    Ivan Ivanovitch was a young man born and bred at Yakoutsk. His parents  had given him the usual amount of tuition, and then allowed him for  a time to follow the bent of his inclination. Ivan took to the chase.  Passionately fond of this amusement, he had at an early age started  with the Yakouta trappers, and become learned in the search for  sables, ermines, and lynxes; could pursue the reindeer and elk on  skates; and had even gone to the north in quest of seals. He thus at  the age of twenty, knew the whole active part of his trade, and was  aware of all the good hunting-grounds on which the Siberians founded  their prosperity. But when he was called on to follow the more quiet  and sedentary part of his occupation, he was not one-half so quick.  His rough and rude life made town existence distasteful to him, and he  evinced all that superb contempt for shop-keeping which characterizes  the nomadic man, whether Red Indian, Arab, Tartar, or Siberian.    But Ivan was told he must make his way in the world. His parents who  died before he attained to manhood, left him a small fortune in rubles  and furs, which, if he chose to be industrious and persevering, might  pave the way to the highest position in his native town. Acting on the  pressing advice of his friends, he gave up his wanderings, and went  to reside in the house of his fathers, piled up his skins and ivory,  bought new ones, and prepared for the annual fair. The merchants from  Irkoutsk, the capital, came, and Ivan, who was sharp and clever,  did a good trade. But when his furs and teeth were changed into  tea, tobacco, brandy, cloth, &c., he did not feel a whit happier.  Ivan longed for the arid hills, and lofty mountains, and pellucid  lakes--for the exciting hunt and the night bivouac, when gray-headed  Yakoutas would, with their _ganzis_--the Irish duddeen--in their  mouths, tell terrible and wonderful stories of ancient days. When  eating town fare, his stomach yearned after frozen Yakouta butter,  cut up with axes, and for _strouganina_ or frozen fish, with reindeer  brains, and other northern delicacies. And then his kind friends told  him that he wanted a wife--a possession without which, they assured  him, life was dull, adding that in her society he would cease to long  for communion with bears and savages.    Ivan believed them, and, following their advice, launched into  society--that is, he went more than usual to the noisy festivities  of the town, which form the occupation of the dull season. The good  people of Yakoutsk--like all people approaching to a savage state,  especially in northern climes--consider eating the great business of  life. Fabulous legends are told of the enormous capacity for food,  approaching that of the Esquimaux; but however this may be, certain it  is that a Yakoutsk festival was always commenced by several hours of  laborious eating and drinking of fat and oily food and strong brandy.  When the utmost limits of repletion were reached, the patriarchs  usually took to pipes, cards, and punch, while the ladies prepared  tea, and ate roasted nuts, probably to facilitate digestion. The young  men conversed with them, or roasted their nuts for them, while perhaps  a dandy would perform a Siberian dance to the music of the violin  or _gousli_, a kind of guitar. Ivan joined heartily in all this  dissipation: he smoked with the old men; he drank their punch; he  roasted nuts for the ladies, and told them wonderful stories which  were always readily listened to, except when some new fashion, which  for several years before had been forgotten in Paris--found its way  via St. Petersburgh, Moscow, and Irkoutsk, to the deserts of Siberia.  Then he was silent; for the ladies had ample subject of discourse, not  forgetting the great tea-table topic--scandal; causing the old men  to shake their heads, and declare such things were not when they were  young. Ivan, however, had one unfailing subject of popularity with  the ladies. Like most Russians who have had occasion to travel much in  cold places, he relished a cup of tea even better than the punch, as  he had learned by experience that there was more genuine warmth in the  pot than in the bowl. Most Russian officers are known to share this  opinion.    Ivan had several times had his attention directed to Maria Vorotinska,  a young and rich widow, who was the admiration of all Yakoutsk. Her  husband had left her a fortune in knowledge of the"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/13056"],[0,"The German Classics of the Nineteenth and Twentieth Centuries, Volume 10 (#13)"],[1,"much-beloved heart. I am very anxious on your account, and often am  quite tearful about it. Best regards to the parents.    Your most faithful v.B.      Berlin, Monday. (Postmark, August 28, '49.)    _My Darling_,--I sit here in my corner room, two flights up, and  survey the sky, full of nothing but little sunset-tinted lambs, as it  appears, along the Taubenstrasse and over the tree-tops of Prinz  Carl's garden, while along Friedrichstrasse it is all golden and  cloudless; the air damp and mild, too. I thought of you and of Venice,  and this only I wanted to write to you. News has come today that  Venice has surrendered at discretion; so we can go there again, and  again see the tall white grenadiers. * * * I dined with Manteuffel  today, yesterday with Prince Albert, of course, day before yesterday  with Arnim, and then I took a ride with him of fourteen miles at a  gallop--which suited me well, save for some muscular pains. In the  Chamber we keep on doing nothing whatever; in the Upper House the  German question, happily, has been brought forward again in very good  speeches by Gerlach, Bethmann, and Stahl, and yet today the Camphausen  proposition was adopted with all the votes against nineteen. With us,  too, it is beginning to excite men's tempers. The proposition is bad  in its tendency, but its result insignificant even if it goes through  with us, as is to be expected. _Tant de bruit pour une omelette_. The  real decision will not be reached in our Chambers, but in diplomacy  and on the battlefield, and all that we prate and resolve about it has  no more value than the moonshine observations of a sentimental youth  who builds air-castles and thinks that some unexpected event will make  him a great man. _Je m'en moque!_--and the farce often bores me nearly  to death, because I see no sensible object in this straw-threshing.  Mother's little letter gave me great pleasure, because, in the first  place, I see that you are well, and then because she has her old joke  with me, which is much pleasanter at a distance, as it does not lead  to strife; and yet how I should like to quarrel with mammy once more!  I am genuinely homesick to be quietly with you all in Schoenhausen.  Have you received the ribbon for Aennchen?    _Tuesday_.--Hans is just breakfasting, and eating up, from sheer  stinginess, a quarter pound of butter that he bought three days ago,  because it begins to get old. Now he screams that my tea is there,  too. I close for today, as I have something to do afterwards. My love  to FatherMotherAnnaAdelheidMarie and all the rest. God's blessing be  with you and keep you well and merry.    Your most faithful v.B.      Berlin, September 11, '49. (Postmarked September 10.)    I wrote yesterday, my Nannie, but as it costs me nothing, not even for  paper, for this is the Chamber's, I do want to improve a wearisome  moment, during which I must listen to the reading of a confused report  on normal prices, to send you another little greeting; but again  without the ribbon, for I am going to buy that later on. This morning  I attended the cavalry manoeuvres, on a very pleasant horse of  Fritz's; rode sharply, swallowed much dust, but, nevertheless, had a  good time; it is really pretty, these brilliant, rapidly moving masses  interspersed with the clanking of iron and the bugle signals. The  Queen, my old flame, greeted me so cordially. Having driven past  without noticing me, she rose and turned backward over the bar of the  carriage, to nod to me thrice; that lady appreciates a Prussian heart.  Tomorrow I shall take a look at the grand parade, in which the  infantry also participates. I believe I have written you that the King  and Leopold Gerlach visited the Emperor of Austria at Teplitz, where  there was also a Russian plenipotentiary. The proletariats of the  Chamber are now gradually coming to see that on that occasion  something may have been concocted which will cast mildew on their  German hot-house flowers, and the fact that his Majesty has conversed  with the ruler of all the Croatians frightens them somewhat. _Qui  vivra verra_. These Frankfort cabbage-heads are incorrigible; they  and their phrases are like the old liars who in the end honestly  believe their own stories; and the impression produced on our Chamber  by such ridiculous things as they say, without any regard for the  matter in hand, or for common-sense, will be sure at last to convince  people generally that peasants and provincials are not fit to make  laws and conduct European politics. Now I must listen. Farewell, my  much-beloved heart. Love to my daughter and your parents.    Your most faithful v.B.      Berlin, Friday.    (Postmarked September 21, '49.)    I am well, my darling Nan, but I am cold, for in the morning the rooms  are already so chilly that I long very much for the Schoenhausen  fireplaces, and matters in the Chamber are so tedious that I often  have serious thoughts of resigning my commission. In the ministry  there is again a shameful measure preparing; they now want to submit a  real property tax bill, according to which those estates which are not  manors are to be indemnified, while manors must suffer, as the number  of nobles is not dangerous. Only if encumbered for more than  two-thirds of their value, they are to be assisted by loans. What good  will a loan do a bankrupt, who has it to repay! It is a mixture of  cowardice and shameless injustice such as I could not have expected.  Yesterday we had soft, warm autumn weather, and I took a long walk in  the Thiergarten, by the same solitary paths which we used to traverse  together; I sat, too, on our bench near the swan-pond; the young swans  which were then still in their eggs on the little island were now  swimming vivaciously about, fat, gray, and _blase_, among the dirty  ducks, and the old ones sleepily laid their heads on their backs. The  handsome large maple standing near the bridge has already leaves of a  dark-red color; I wished to send you one of them, but in my pocket it  has become so hard that it crumbles away; the gold-fish pond is  almost dried up; the lindens, the black alders, and other delicate  things bestrew the paths with their yellow, rustling foliage, and the  round chestnut-burrs exhibit a medley of all shades of sombre and  attractive fall coloring. The promenade, with its morning fogs among  the trees, reminded me vividly of Kniephof, the woodcock-hunt, the  line of springes, and how everything was so green and fresh when I  used to walk there with you, my darling. * * * On the 1st of October I  shall probably have to attend the celebration of the nine-hundredth  anniversary of the founding of the cathedral there, to which the King  is coming. For the 2d and the following days I have been invited to go  on a royal hunt to the Falkenstein. I should be very glad to shoot a  deer in those woods which we and Mary saw illuminated by the moon on  that evening; but even if matters in the Chamber should not prevent, I  am at a loss how to reconcile that with our journey, and I feel as  though I should steal my days from you by going. * * * I am now going  out to buy a waist, to call on Rauch, and then again to the  Thiergarten. All love to father and mother, and may God preserve you  in the future as hitherto, my dearest.    Your most faithful v.B.      Berlin, Friday.    (Postmarked September 28, '49.)    _My Dear,--_I have taken the apartment in the Behrenstrasse; that on  the Thiergarten is too uncomfortable for you in going in and out in  wet winter weather. * * * It is better that I should procure and  arrange everything for you in advance; then you need only alight here  and sink into my open arms and on a ready sofa; that would be so  pretty; only come soon, my beloved angel; today the weather is already  bitter cold, and write me exactly when I can come for you to Z. Do not  be offended, either, at my note of yesterday, and do not think that  you have offended me, but please come quickly. I am not going to the  Harz. Much love. In great haste.    Your most faithful v.B.      Over the blue mountain,    Over the white sea-foam,    Come, thou beloved one,    Come to thy lonely home.                        --_Old Song_.      Schoenhausen, October 2, '49.    _My Beloved Nan,--I am sitting in our quiet old Schoenhausen, where I  am quite comfortable, after the Berlin hubbub, and I should like to  stay here a week, if the old Chamber allowed. This morning Odin  awakened me, and then retreated as usual between the beds; then the  Bellins groaned very much about the bad qualities of the tenant, with  whom they lead a cat-and-dog life, and I discussed with her, pro and  con, all that is to be sent to Berlin. The garden is still quite green  for the fall season, but the paths are overgrown with grass, and our  little island is so dwarfed and wet that I could not get on to it; it  rains without let-up. The little alderman, of course, sat with me all  the afternoon, otherwise I should have written you sooner and more at  length. I want to leave again tomorrow morning, and I have still  several business letters to write. Yesterday, with the King, I  celebrated the nine-hundredth anniversary of the Brandenburg  Cathedral, after it had been thoroughly exorcised and the bad national  spirits driven out. The entire royal family was there, except the  Princess of Babelsberg, who is at Weimar; also Brandenburg,  Manteuffel, Wrangel, Voss, and many high dignitaries, among them  myself, quite courageously at the front in church, next to the  princesses. At dinner his Majesty said many pretty things about his  electoral and capital city of Brandenburg, and was also very friendly  to me. I introduced to the Queen a number of village mayors, who had  been of particular service in my election; they were so much moved by  it that afterwards they embraced me with tears in their eyes. Finally,  the King became very angry at Patow, who had made his"]]]
