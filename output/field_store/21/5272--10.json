The first few villages he came to were deserted, showing that news of  the coming of his pack had travelled rapidly; but toward evening he  came upon a distant cluster of thatched huts surrounded by a rude  palisade, within which were a couple of hundred natives.    The women were preparing the evening meal as Tarzan of the Apes poised  above them in the branches of a giant tree which overhung the palisade  at one point.    The ape-man was at a loss as to how he might enter into communication  with these people without either frightening them or arousing their  savage love of battle.  He had no desire to fight now, for he was upon  a much more important mission than that of battling with every chance  tribe that he should happen to meet with.    At last he hit upon a plan, and after seeing that he was concealed from  the view of those below, he gave a few hoarse grunts in imitation of a  panther.  All eyes immediately turned upward toward the foliage above.    It was growing dark, and they could not penetrate the leafy screen  which shielded the ape-man from their view.  The moment that he had won  their attention he raised his voice to the shriller and more hideous  scream of the beast he personated, and then, scarce stirring a leaf in  his descent, dropped to the ground once again outside the palisade,  and, with the speed of a deer, ran quickly round to the village gate.    Here he beat upon the fibre-bound saplings of which the barrier was  constructed, shouting to the natives in their own tongue that he was a  friend who wished food and shelter for the night.    Tarzan knew well the nature of the black man.  He was aware that the  grunting and screaming of Sheeta in the tree above them would set their  nerves on edge, and that his pounding upon their gate after dark would  still further add to their terror.    That they did not reply to his hail was no surprise, for natives are  fearful of any voice that comes out of the night from beyond their  palisades, attributing it always to some demon or other ghostly  visitor; but still he continued to call.    \"Let me in, my friends!\" he cried.  \"I am a white man pursuing the very  bad white man who passed this way a few days ago.  I follow to punish  him for the sins he has committed against you and me.    \"If you doubt my friendship, I will prove it to you by going into the  tree above your village and driving Sheeta back into the jungle before  he leaps among you.  If you will not promise to take me in and treat me  as a friend I shall let Sheeta stay and devour you.\"    For a moment there was silence.  Then the voice of an old man came out  of the quiet of the village street.    \"If you are indeed a white man and a friend, we will let you come in;  but first you must drive Sheeta away.\"    \"Very well,\" replied Tarzan.  \"Listen, and you shall hear Sheeta  fleeing before me.\"    The ape-man returned quickly to the tree, and this time he made a great  noise as he entered the branches, at the same time growling ominously  after the manner of the panther, so that those below would believe that  the great beast was still there.    When he reached a point well above the village street he made a great  commotion, shaking the tree violently, crying aloud to the panther to  flee or be killed, and punctuating his own voice with the screams and  mouthings of an angry beast.    Presently he raced toward the opposite side of the tree and off into  the jungle, pounding loudly against the boles of trees as he went, and  voicing the panther's diminishing growls as he drew farther and farther  away from the village.    A few minutes later he returned to the village gate, calling to the  natives within.    \"I have driven Sheeta away,\" he said.  \"Now come and admit me as you  promised.\"    For a time there was the sound of excited discussion within the  palisade, but at length a half-dozen warriors came and opened the  gates, peering anxiously out in evident trepidation as to the nature of  the creature which they should find waiting there.  They were not much  relieved at sight of an almost naked white man; but when Tarzan had  reassured them in quiet tones, protesting his friendship for them, they  opened the barrier a trifle farther and admitted him.    When the gates had been once more secured the self-confidence of the  savages returned, and as Tarzan walked up the village street toward the  chief's hut he was surrounded by a host of curious men, women, and  children.    From the chief he learned that Rokoff had passed up the river a week  previous, and that he had horns growing from his forehead, and was  accompanied by a thousand devils.   Later the chief said that the very  bad white man had remained a month in his village.    Though none of these statements agreed with Kaviri's, that the Russian  was but three days gone from the chieftain's village and that his  following was much smaller than now stated, Tarzan was in no manner  surprised at the discrepancies, for he was quite familiar with the  savage mind's strange manner of functioning.    What he was most interested in knowing was that he was upon the right  trail, and that it led toward the interior.  In this circumstance he  knew that Rokoff could never escape him.    After several hours of questioning and cross-questioning the ape-man  learned that another party had preceded the Russian by several  days--three whites--a man, a woman, and a little man-child, with  several Mosulas.    Tarzan explained to the chief that his people would follow him in a  canoe, probably the next day, and that though he might go on ahead of  them the chief was to receive them kindly and have no fear of them, for  Mugambi would see that they did not harm the chief's people, if they  were accorded a friendly reception.    \"And now,\" he concluded, \"I shall lie down beneath this tree and sleep.  I am very tired.  Permit no one to disturb me.\"    The chief offered him a hut, but Tarzan, from past experience of native  dwellings, preferred the open air, and, further, he had plans of his  own that could be better carried out if he remained beneath the tree.  He gave as his reason a desire to be close at hand should Sheeta  return, and after this explanation the chief was very glad to permit  him to sleep beneath the tree.    Tarzan had always found that it stood him in good stead to leave with  natives the impression that he was to some extent possessed of more or  less miraculous powers.  He might easily have entered their village  without recourse to the gates, but he believed that a sudden and  unaccountable disappearance when he was ready to leave them would  result in a more lasting impression upon their childlike minds, and so  as soon as the village was quiet in sleep he rose, and, leaping into  the branches of the tree above him, faded silently into the black  mystery of the jungle night.    All the balance of that night the ape-man swung rapidly through the  upper and middle terraces of the forest.  When the going was good there  he preferred the upper branches of the giant trees, for then his way  was better lighted by the moon; but so accustomed were all his senses  to the grim world of his birth that it was possible for him, even in  the dense, black shadows near the ground, to move with ease and  rapidity.   You or I walking beneath the arcs of Main Street, or  Broadway, or State Street, could not have moved more surely or with a  tenth the speed of the agile ape-man through the gloomy mazes that  would have baffled us entirely.    At dawn he stopped to feed, and then he slept for several hours, taking  up the pursuit again toward noon.    Twice he came upon natives, and, though he had considerable difficulty  in approaching them, he succeeded in each instance in quieting both  their fears and bellicose intentions toward him, and learned from them  that he was upon the trail of the Russian.    Two days later, still following up the Ugambi, he came upon a large  village.  The chief, a wicked-looking fellow with the sharp-filed teeth  that often denote the cannibal, received him with apparent friendliness.    The ape-man was now thoroughly fatigued, and had determined to rest for  eight or ten hours that he might be fresh and strong when he caught up  with Rokoff, as he was sure he must do within a very short time.    The chief told him that the bearded white man had left his village only  the morning before, and that doubtless he would be able to overtake him  in a short time.  The other party the chief had not seen or heard of,  so he said.    Tarzan did not like the appearance or manner of the fellow, who seemed,  though friendly enough, to harbour a certain contempt for this  half-naked white man who came with no followers and offered no  presents; but he needed the rest and food that the village would afford  him with less effort than the jungle, and so, as he knew no fear of  man, beast, or devil, he curled himself up in the shadow of a hut and  was soon asleep.    Scarcely had he left the chief than the latter called two of his  warriors, to whom he whispered a few instructions.   A moment later the  sleek, black bodies were racing along the river path, up-stream, toward  the east.    In the village the chief maintained perfect quiet.  He would permit no  one to approach the sleeping visitor, nor any singing, nor loud  talking.  He was remarkably solicitous lest his guest be disturbed.    Three hours later several canoes came silently into view from up the  Ugambi.  They were being pushed ahead rapidly by the brawny muscles of  their black crews.  Upon the bank before the river stood the chief, his  spear raised in a horizontal position above his head, as though in some  manner of predetermined signal to those within the boats."]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/8502"],[0,"Common Diseases of Farm Animals (#12)"],[1,"of the bladder in  ruminants. When this occurs, the symptoms of pain are less evident. Death  occurs from uraemic poisoning and peritonitis. The outcome is less  favorable in ruminants than in solipeds.    _Inflammation of the sheath_ can be readily recognized because of the local  swelling.    _The following lines of treatment_ are recommended: A ration or feed that  favors the formation of calculi should not be fed to animals; inflammation  of the sheath should receive prompt treatment--this consists in irrigating  the part with warm, soapy or alkaline water, followed by an antiseptic  wash; we may attempt to work the urethral calculi forward and out of the  S-curve in the urethra; if this is unsuccessful, urethrotomy for their  removal may be attempted.    The retention of the urine in horses, because of spasm or paralysis of  certain muscles, may be treated by passing the catheter. Sometimes  spreading litter under the horse and keeping it quiet may induce it to  urinate. Hot packs over the region of the back may be used. The treatment  for calculi is entirely surgical. The operation for the removal of cystic  calculi in the horse, although difficult, is followed by good results.      QUESTIONS    1. Describe the urinary apparatus.    2.

CHAPTER VII    DISEASES OF THE GENERATIVE ORGANS      GENERAL DISCUSSION.--The study of the organs concerned with the  reproduction of the species is essential in order to acquire a knowledge of  their several functions. It is only through an understanding of these  functions that we can prepare ourselves to correctly recognize, and  successfully treat, or prevent, such diseases as may involve the organs of  generation. A knowledge of the structure and function of the generative  organs of the female is of greater importance from the standpoint of  disease, than is a similar knowledge of the generative organs of the male.  The female is concerned with the complete reproductive process, which may  be divided into four stages. These are _copulation_, _fecundation_,  _gestation_ and _parturition_. The male is concerned only with _copulation_  and _fertilization_ of the ovum by the spermatozoa, while the female must  protect and nourish the embryo and foetus until it has become sufficiently  developed to live independently of the protection and nourishment afforded  it within the womb. When the final stage of gestation is reached, birth or  the act of parturition occurs.    GENITAL ORGANS OF THE FEMALE.--The female generative organs are the  ovaries, fallopian tubules, uterus, vagina, vulva and mammary glands.    _The ovaries_ are analogous to the testicles of the male. Their function is  to secrete ova. This pair of glands is suspended from the superior region  (sublumbar) of the abdominal cavity by folds of the lining membrane.  Leading from the ovaries, but connected with the surface of these glands  only during the period of oestrum or heat, are the fallopian tubules. Their  function is to carry the ovum from the ovaries to the uterus.    _The uterus or womb_ is a membranous sack situated in the sublumbar region  and at the inlet to the pelvic cavity. It is held in position by numerous  folds of the lining membrane of the abdominal cavity. We may divide the  womb into three divisions, cornua, body and cervix.    The cornua or horns are long and cylindrical in shape. This portion of the  womb is greatly developed in animals, like the sow and bitch, that give  birth to several young. In the impregnated animal the wall of the cornua  that contains one or several foetuses, and the body as well, becomes  greatly thickened and the lining membrane more vascular.    The body is short in all domestic animals and connects the horns with the  cervix or neck. The latter is represented by a narrow portion that projects  backward into the vagina. In the cow the cervix is less prominent than in  the mare and the tissue that forms it, quite firm. In the cow the opening  in the cervix, the os, is very small.    _The vagina_ is a musculo-membranous canal that leads from the womb. In the  mare and cow it is about one foot in length. Its function is to take part  in copulation and parturition.    _The vulva_ is the external opening of the maternal passages. It shows a  vertical slit enclosed by lips, and interiorly it forms a passage that is  continuous with the vagina. This passage is about six inches long in the  larger animals. The different features that should be noted are the  clitoris, a small erectile organ located at the inferior portion of the  opening, the meatus urinaris, the external opening of the urethra, situated  in a depression in the floor of the vulva, and the hymen, an incomplete  membranous partition that may be found separating the vulva from the  vagina.    _The mammary glands or udders_ secrete the milk that nourishes the young.  The glands vary in number. The mare has two, the cow four (Fig. 17), the  ewe two and animals that give birth to several young, eight or more. Each  gland is surmounted by a teat or nipple. The glandular tissue consists of  caecal vesicles that form grape-like clusters around the milk tubules. The  milk tubules from the different portions of the gland converge and form  larger tubules that finally empty into small sinuses or reservoirs at the  base of the teat. Leading from these sinuses are one or several milk ducts  that open at the summit of the teat.    GENITAL ORGANS OF THE MALE.--The genital organs of the male are the  testicles, the ducts or canals leading from the testicles, the seminal  vesicles, the glands lying along the urethra, and the penis.    [Illustration: FIG. 17.--Photograph of model of udder of cow: milk duct;  milk sinuses; and glandular tissue.]    _The testicles_ are the glandular organs that secrete the spermatozoa, the  essential elements of the seminal fluid. These glands are lodged in the  scrotal sack, situated between the two thighs.    Lying along the superior border of the testicle is a mass of ducts, the  _epididymis_. The _vas deferens_ is the canal or duct that passes  from the epididymis to the region of the bladder and terminates near its  neck by emptying into the seminal vesicles.    _The seminal vesicles_ are two membranous pouches situated just above the  bladder. They act as receptacles for the seminal fluid. Two short ducts,  the _ejaculatory_, carry the seminal fluid from the seminal vesicles to the  urethra.    _The prostate gland_ is situated near the origin of the urethra. _Cowper's  glands_ lie along the course of the urethra and near the origin of the  penis. These glands empty their secretions into the urethra and dilute the  seminal fluid.    _The penis_ is the male organ of copulation. It originates at the arch of  the ischium and extends forward between the thighs. It may be divided into  fixed and free portions. The free portion is lodged in the prepuce or  sheath, but at the time of erection protrudes from it.    STERILITY, IMPOTENCY.--Fecundation does not always follow intercourse of  the male and female. Impotency in the male and sterility in the female  frequently occur.    _The causes_ are quite varied. A normal copulation may be impossible  because of injuries to, and deformities of, the parts and tumor growths.  Deformed genital organs and obstructions of the os by growths and scar  tissue are causes of sterility in the female.    Failure to breed is commonly caused by faulty methods of feeding and care.  Over-feeding and insufficient exercise may result in the body tissues  becoming loaded with fat. This may cause a temporary sterility, but if  persisted in, as is frequently the case in show animals, the sterility  becomes permanent because of the genital glands failing to secrete ova and  spermatozoa, or the lack of vitality of the male and female elements. Old  age and debility from disease or poor care may induce loss of sexual desire  and an absence of, or weakened spermatozoa in, the seminal fluid. The  refusal of the male to serve certain females is sometimes noted.    Tuberculosis may affect the ovaries and cause permanent sterility. In  inflammation of the lining membrane of the womb and vagina, the secretions  are abnormal and may collect in the womb and the passages leading to it.  These secretions destroy the vitality of the spermatozoa, and this  condition may be considered a common cause of sterility in the larger  animals. Many vigorous young males are made impotent by excessive  copulation. The excessive use of the male at any time may result in failure  to impregnate a large percentage of the females that he serves.    Barren females do not become pregnant after frequent intercourse with the  male. Young sterile females may not come in heat. Sometimes unnatural  periods of heat are manifested, the animal coming in heat frequently or  remaining in heat for a longer period than usual. This sometimes occurs in  tuberculosis of the ovaries. In chronic inflammation of the maternal  passage there is more or less discharge from the vulva. Both sexes may be  overly fat or weakened and debilitated by disease. Deformity of the  generative organs and growths may be found on making an examination.  Absence of, or lack of vitality of the spermatozoa may be determined by  microscopic examination of the seminal fluid.    _The treatment_ is largely preventive. It is very important that breeding  animals be kept in proper physical condition by avoiding the feeding of too  heavy or too light a ration, and allowing"]]]
