Much dancing takes place among the      unmarried girls, who, also, are tattooed at this time over the      whole of the front of the body, special attention being paid to      the lower parts, as a girl who is not properly tattooed there      possesses no attraction in the eyes of young men. Married women      and widows and divorced women are not forbidden to take part in      these dances, but it would be considered ridiculous for them to      do so. (R.E. Guise, \"On the Tribes of the Wanigela River,\"      _Journal of the Anthropological Institute_, new series, vol. i,      1899, pp. 209, 214 et seq.)        In the island of Nias in the Malay Archipelago, Modigliani      (mainly on the excellent authority of Sundermann, the missionary)      states, at a wedding \"dancing and singing go on throughout the      day. The women, two or three at a time, a little apart from the      men, take part in the dancing, which is very well adapted to      emphasize the curves of the flanks and the breasts, though at the      same time the defects of their legs are exhibited in this series      of rhythmic contortions which constitute a Nias dance. The most      graceful movement they execute is a lascivious undulation of the      flanks while the face and breast are slowly wound round by the      _sarong_ [a sort of skirt] held in the hands, and then again      revealed. These movements are executed with jerks of the wrist      and contortions of the flanks, not always graceful, but which      excite the admiration of the spectators, even of the women, who      form in groups to sing in chorus a compliment, more or less      sincere, in which they say: 'They dance with the grace of birds      when they fly. They dance as the hawk flies; it is lovely to      see.' They sing and dance both at weddings and at other      festivals.\" (Elio Modigliani, _Un Viaggio a Nias_, 1890, p. 549.)        In Sumatra Marsden states that chastity prevails more, perhaps,      than among any other people: \"But little apparent courtship      precedes their marriages. Their manners do not admit of it, the      _boojong_ and _geddas_ (youths of each sex) being carefully kept      asunder and the latter seldom trusted from under the wings of      their mothers.... The opportunities which the young people have      of seeing and conversing with each other are at the _birnbangs_,      or public festivals. On these occasions the young people meet      together and dance and sing in company. The men, when determined      in their regard, generally employ an old woman as their agent, by      whom they make known their sentiments, and send presents to the      female of their choice. The parents then interfere, and the      preliminaries being settled, a _birnbang_ takes place. The young      women proceed in a body to the upper end of the _balli_ (hall),      where there is a part divided off for them by a curtain. They do      not always make their appearance before dinner, that time,      previous to a second or third meal, being appropriated to      cock-fighting or other diversions peculiar to men. In the evening      their other amusements take place, of which the dances are the      principal. These are performed either singly or by two women, two      men, or with both mixed. Their motions and attitudes are usually      slow, approaching often to the lascivious. They bend forward as      they dance, and usually carry a fan, which they close and strike      smartly against their elbows at particular cadences.... The      assembly seldom breaks up before daylight and these _birnbangs_      are often continued for several days together. The young men      frequent them in order to look out for wives, and the lasses of      course set themselves off to the best advantage. They wear their      best silken dresses, of their own weaving, as many ornaments of      filigree as they possess, silver rings upon their arms and legs,      and ear-rings of a particular construction. Their hair is      variously adorned with flowers, and perfumed with oil of      benjamin. Civet is also in repute, but more used by the men. To      render their skin fine, smooth, and soft they make use of a white      cosmetic called _poopoor_ [a mixture of ginger, patch-leaf,      maize, sandal-wood, fairy-cotton, and mush-seed with a basis of      fine rice].\" (W. Marsden, _History of Sumatra_, 1783, p. 230.)        The Alfurus of Seram in the Moluccas, who have not yet been      spoilt by foreign influences, are very fond of music and dancing.      Their _maku_ dances, which take place at night, have been      described by Joest: \"Great torches of dry bamboos and piles of      burning resinous leaves light up the giant trees to their very      summits and reveal in the distance the little huts which the      Alfuras have built in the virgin forests, as well as the skulls      of the slain. The women squat together by the fire, making a      deafening noise with the gongs and the drums, while the young      girls, richly adorned with pearls and fragrant flowers, await the      beginning of the dance. Then appear the men and youths without      weapons, but in full war-costume, the girdle freshly marked with      the number of slain enemies. [Among the Alfuras it is the man who      has the largest number of heads to show who has most chance of      winning the object of his love.] They hold each other's arms and      form a circle, which is not, however, completely closed. A song      is started, and with small, slow steps this ring of bodies, like      a winding snake, moves sideways, backward, closes, opens again,      the steps become heavier, the songs and drums louder, the girls      enter the circle and with closed eyes grasp the girdle of their      chosen youths, who clasp them by the hips and necks, the chain      becomes longer and longer, the dance and song more ardent, until      the dancers grow tired and disappear in the gloom of the forest.\"      (W. Joest, _Welt-Fahrten_, 1895, Bd. ii, p. 159.)        The women of the New Hebrides dance, or rather sway, to and fro      in the midst of a circle formed by the men, with whom they do not      directly mingle. They leap, show their genital parts to the men,      and imitate the movements of coitus. Meanwhile the men unfasten      the _manou_ (penis-wrap) from their girdles with one hand, with      the other imitating the action of seizing a woman, and, excited      by the women, also go through a mock copulation. Sometimes, it is      said, the dancers masturbate. This takes place amid plaintive      songs, interrupted from time to time by loud cries and howls.      (_Untrodden Fields of Anthropology_, by a French army-surgeon,      1898, vol. ii, p. 341.)        Among the hill tribes of the Central Indian Hills may be traced a      desire to secure communion with the spirit of fertility embodied      in vegetation. This appears, for instance, in a tree-dance, which      is carried out on a date associated not only with the growths of      the crops or with harvest, but also with the seasonal period for      marriage and the annual Saturnalia. (W. Crooke, \"The Hill      Tribes,\" _Journal of the Anthropological Institute_, new series,      vol. i, 1899, p. 243.) The association of dancing with seasonal      ritual festivals of a generative character--of which the above is      a fairly typical instance--leads us to another aspect of these      phenomena on which I have elsewhere touched in these _Studies_      (vol. i) when discussing the \"Phenomena of Periodicity.\"        The Tahitians, when first discovered by Europeans, appear to have      been highly civilized on the sexual side and very licentious. Yet      even at Tahiti, when visited by Cook, the strict primitive      relationship between dancing and courtship still remained      traceable. Cook found \"a dance called Timorodee, which is      performed by young girls, whenever eight or ten of them can be      collected together, consisting of motions and gestures beyond      imagination wanton, in the practice of which they are brought up      from their earliest childhood, accompanied by words which, if it      were possible, would more explicitly convey the same ideas. But      the practice which is allowed to the virgin is prohibited to the      woman from the moment that she has put these hopeful lessons in      practice and realized the symbols of the dance.\" He added,      however, that among the specially privileged class of the Areoi      these limitations were not observed, for he had heard that this      dance was sometimes performed by them as a preliminary to sexual      intercourse. (Hawkesworth, _An Account of the Voyages_, etc.,      1775, vol. ii, p. 54.)        Among the Marquesans at the marriage of a woman, even of high      rank, she lies with her head at the bridegroom's knees and all      the male guests come in single file, singing and dancing--those      of lower class first and the great chiefs last--and have      connection with the woman. There are often a very large number of      guests and the bride is sometimes so exhausted at the end that      she has to spend several days in bed. (Tautain, \"Etude sur le      Mariage chez les Polynesiens,\" _L'Anthropologie_,      November-December, 1895, p. 642.) The interesting point for us      here is that singing and dancing are still regarded as a      preliminary to a sexual act. It has been noted that in sexual      matters the Polynesians, when first discovered by Europeans, had      largely gone beyond the primitive stage, and that this applies      also to some of their dances. Thus the _hula-hula_ dance, while      primitive in origin, may probably be compared more to a civilized      than to a primitive dance, since it has become"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/13613"],[0,"Studies in the Psychology of Sex, Volume 4 (#13)"],[1,"it has become almost  rudimentary, giving place to the supremacy of vision.        Prof. G. Elliot Smith, a leading authority on the brain, has well      summarized the facts concerning the predominance of the olfactory      region in the mammal brain, and his conclusions may be quoted. It      should be premised that Elliot Smith divides the brain into      rhinencephalon and neopallium. Rhinencephalon designates the      regions which are pre-eminently olfactory in function: the      olfactory bulb, its peduncle, the tuberculum olfactorium and      locus perforatus, the pyriform lobe, the paraterminal body, and      the whole hippocampal formation. The neopallium is the dorsal cap      of the brain, with frontal, parietal, and occipital areas,      comprehending all that part of the brain which is the seat of the      higher associative activities, reaching its fullest development      in man.        \"In the early mammals the olfactory areas form by far the greater      part of the cerebral hemisphere, which is not surprising when it      is recalled that the forebrain is, in the primitive brain,      essentially an appendage, so to speak, of the smell apparatus.      When the cerebral hemisphere comes to occupy such a dominant      position in the brain it is perhaps not unnatural to find that      the sense of smell is the most influential and the chief source      of information to the animal; or, perhaps, it would be more      accurate to say that the olfactory sense, which conveys general      information to the animal such as no other sense can bring      concerning its prey (whether near or far, hidden or exposed), is      much the most serviceable of all the avenues of information to      the lowly mammal leading a terrestrial life, and therefore      becomes predominant; and its particular domain--the      forebrain--becomes the ruling portion of the nervous system.        \"This early predominance of the sense of smell persists in most      mammals (unless an aquatic mode of life interferes and deposes      it: compare the _Cetacea, Sirenia_, and _Pinnipedia_, for      example) even though a large neopallium develops to receive      visual, auditory, tactile, and other impressions pouring into the      forebrain. In the _Anthropoidea_ alone of nonaquatic mammals the      olfactory regions undergo an absolute (and not only relative, as      in the _Carnivora_ and _Ungulata_) dwindling, which is equally      shared by the human brain, in common with those of the other      _Simiidae_, the _Cercopithecidae_, and the _Cebidae_. But all the      parts of the rhinencephalon, which are so distinct in macrosmatic      mammals, can also be recognized in the human brain. The small      ellipsoidal olfactory bulb is moored, so to speak, on the      cribriform plate of the ethmoid bone by the olfactory nerves; so      that, as the place of attachment of the olfactory peduncle to the      expanding cerebral hemisphere becomes removed (as a result of the      forward extension of the hemisphere) progressively farther and      farther backward, the peduncle becomes greatly stretched and      elongated. And, as this stretching involves the gray matter      without lessening the number of nerve-fibres in the olfactory      tract, the peduncle becomes practically what it is usually      called--i.e., the olfactory 'tract.' The tuberculum olfactorium      becomes greatly reduced and at the same time flattened; so that      it is not easy to draw a line of demarcation between it and the      anterior perforated space. The anterior rhinal fissure, which is      present in the early human foetus, vanishes (almost, if not      altogether) in the adult. Part of the posterior rhinal fissure is      always present in the 'incisura temporalis,' and sometimes,      especially in some of the non-European races, the whole of the      posterior rhinal fissure is retained in that typical form which      we find in the anthropoid apes.\" (G. Elliot Smith, in      _Descriptive and Illustrated Catalogue of the Physiological      Series of Comparative Anatomy Contained in the Museum of the      Royal College of Surgeons of England_, second edition, vol. ii.)      A full statement of Elliot Smith's investigations, with diagrams,      is given by Bullen, _Journal of Mental Science_, July, 1899. It      may be added that the whole subject of the olfactory centres has      been thoroughly studied by Elliot Smith, as well as by Edinger,      Mayer, and C.L. Herrick. In the _Journal of Comparative      Neurology_, edited by the last named, numerous discussions and      summaries bearing on the subject will be found from 1896 onward.      Regarding the primitive sense-organs of smell in the various      invertebrate groups some information will be found in A.B.      Griffiths's _Physiology of the Invertebrata_, Chapter XI.    The predominance of the olfactory area in the nervous system of the  vertebrates generally has inevitably involved intimate psychic  associations between olfactory stimuli and the sexual impulse. For most  mammals not only are all sexual associations mainly olfactory, but the  impressions received by this sense suffice to dominate all others. An  animal not only receives adequate sexual excitement from olfactory  stimuli, but those stimuli often suffice to counterbalance all the  evidence of the other senses.        We may observe this very well in the case of the dog. Thus, a      young dog, well known to me, who had never had connection with a      bitch, but was always in the society of its father, once met the      latter directly after the elder dog had been with a bitch. He      immediately endeavored to behave toward the elder dog, in spite      of angry repulses, exactly as a dog behaves toward a bitch in      heat. The messages received by the sense of smell were      sufficiently urgent not only to set the sexual mechanism in      action, but to overcome the experiences of a lifetime. There is      an interesting chapter on the sense of smell in the mental life      of the dog in Giessler's _Psychologie des Geruches_, 1894,      Chapter XI, Passy (in the appendix to his memoir on olfaction,      _L'Annee Psychologique_, 1895) gives the result of some      interesting experiments as to the effects of perfume on dogs;      civet and castoreum were found to have the most powerfully      exciting effect.        The influences of smell are equally omnipotent in the sexual life      of many insects. Thus, Fere has found that in cockchafers sexual      coupling failed to take place when the antennae, which are the      organs of smell, were removed; he also found that males, after      they had coupled with females, proved sexually attractive to      other males (_Comptes Rendus de la Societe de Biologie_, May 21,      1898). Fere similarly found that, in a species of _Bombyx_, males      after contact with females sometimes proved attractive to other      males, although no abnormal relationships followed. (_Soc. de      Biol_, July 30, 1898.)    With the advent of the higher apes, and especially of man, all this has  been changed. The sense of smell, indeed, still persists universally and  it is still also exceedingly delicate, though often neglected.[25] It is,  moreover, a useful auxiliary in the exploration of the external world,  for, in contrast to the very few sensations furnished to us by touch and  by taste, we are acquainted with a vast number of smells, though the  information they give us is frequently vague. An experienced perfumer,  says Piesse, will have two hundred odors in his laboratory and can  distinguish them all. To a sensitive nose nearly everything smells. Passy  goes so far as to state that he has \"never met with any object that is  really inodorous when one pays attention to it, not even excepting glass,\"  and, though we can scarcely accept this statement absolutely,--especially  in view of the careful experiments of Ayrton, which show that, contrary  to a common belief, metals when perfectly clean and free from traces of  contact with the skin or with salt solutions have no smell,--odor is still  extremely widely diffused. This is especially the case in hot countries,  and the experiments of the Cambridge Anthropological Expedition on the  sense of smell of the Papuans were considerably impeded by the fact that  at Torres Straits everything, even water, seemed to have a smell. Savages  are often accused more or less justly of indifference to bad odors. They  are very often, however, keenly alive to the significance of smells and  their varieties, though it does not appear that the sense of smell is  notably more developed in savage than in civilized peoples. Odors also  continue to play a part in the emotional life of man, more especially in  hot countries. Nevertheless both in practical life and in emotional life,  in science and in art, smell is, at the best, under normal conditions,  merely an auxiliary. If the sense of smell were abolished altogether the  life of mankind would continue as before, with little or no sensible  modification, though the pleasures of life, and especially of eating and  drinking, would be to some extent diminished.        In New Ireland, Duffield remarks (_Journal of the Anthropological      Institute_, 1886, p. 118), the natives have a very keen sense of      smell; unusual odors are repulsive to them, and \"carbolic acid      drove them wild.\"        The New Caledonians, according to Foley (_Bulletin de la Societe      d'Anthropologie_, November 6, 1879), only like the smells of meat      and fish which are becoming \"high,\" like _popoya_, which smells      of fowl manure, and _kava_, of rotten eggs. Fruits and vegetables      which are beginning to go bad seem the best to them, while the      fresh and natural odors which we prefer seem merely to say to      them: \"We are not yet eatable.\" (A taste for putrefying food,      common among savages, by no"]]]
