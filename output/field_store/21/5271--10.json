It is a good plan, and rapidly becoming an established custom, to  have small cards with the names of the guests written upon them,  laid upon the plate at each seat. Each one thus taking the place  assigned prevents confusion, and gives the hostess the privilege  of placing near to each other the guests who will prove mutually  agreeable.    Gentlemen should stand behind their respective chairs until all  the ladies are seated, and then take their own seats, being  careful that their chairs do not stand upon the dresses of the  ladies beside them.    Seats having been apportioned to all, grace is said, by a  clergyman if there is one present, if not, by the host. The  clergyman should be invited to say grace by the host.    If the dinner is _a la Russe_, there will not be any carving done  on the table itself.    If the party is small, mere _en famille_, the hostess will have a  dish before her, the contents of which will have to be carved. The  gentleman on her right hand should in that case offer to carve for  her, but if she declines, should not press the offer. Many ladies  are excellent carvers, and like to appear so.    There is no space in our little volume for directions upon  carving, nor do they form any portion of the art of etiquette. All  that etiquette has to say on the subject is that you must not  stand up to carve; you must not pursue the bird, joint or whatever  the meat may be, all round the dish; nor should you comment upon  the age of the fowl, the toughness of the meat or your own  awkwardness in carving. If you really do not understand it, do not  attempt it; say so and let the waiter cut it up.    Never be helped twice to soup or fish, and indeed it appears low  bred to be twice served to any one dish. You may refuse either  soup or fish, but make no comment if you do, as to your liking or  dislike for the dish, nor is it incumbent upon you to state that  \"soup does not agree with you,\" or that \"fish always make you  ill;\" any such remarks are rude. Simply to say \"no, thank you,\" in  refusing a dish, is all the reply that strict etiquette will allow  upon the subject.    No remarks should be made by the host or hostess on the refusal of  a guest to partake of a proffered dish. Pressing the food upon a  guest with \"Oh, do take some,\" or \"You must, it was made by so-  and-so,\" or indeed any remark upon the repast, is not only  annoying to the guest, but a proof of low-breeding in the  entertainers. There is a sort of hospitality about it, but it is a  rough barbarism. Who does not remember the description of Bridget  Elias' hospitable _gaucherie_ in Charles Lamb's \"Poor Relation,\"  when urging the poor relation to eat with the speech: \"Do take  some more; remember you do not get pudding every day.\"    Never should a host or hostess apologize for the fare set before  their guest. Such apologies are generally a mere fishing for  compliment, untrue and in entirely bad taste. In inviting his  friends to dinner, the host binds himself to set before them the  best his house and purse can afford, and if the fare is good the  guest will soon find it out, if bad, no apologies will make it any  better.    It is in bad taste to apologize to the waiters for the trouble  given them, and betrays a lamentable ignorance of the customs of  society. They are hired to wait upon the guests, and it is no  affair of those guests how they feel, as long as they discharge  their duty. To reprove a waiter is the height of ill-breeding.    Do not, when a dish is brought to you, say you prefer to be helped  after some one else. Accept or refuse what is offered to you, and  let the waiter pass the dish on. A gentleman, however, will see  that the lady he has escorted to the table is helped as she  wishes, before he attends to his own dinner, but to interfere with  the lady on the other side of him is all insult to her escort. He  may ask the lady under his care if she will be helped from any  dish offered him, before he accepts or declines for himself, and  will issue her orders for her to the waiter when she selects her  dinner.    A gentleman or a lady will always say \"Thank you\" to a waiter,  but nothing more.    A guest must never find fault with any dish placed before him, and  to appear to question the quality or freshness of the viands by  smelling or fastidiously tasting them, is a positive insult to the  gentleman who has invited him to his table.    A host or hostess may never find fault before their guests,  neither with the dinner, with the servants, nor with each other.  Burnt soup, fish boiled to rags, underdone vegetables, heavy  pastry, must be endured with smiling equanimity. No scowl must  greet the crash that announces the fall of a tray of the finest  glass, no word of remonstrance greet the deluge of a plate of soup  over the tablecloth. If care has not been taken to secure first-  rate cooks and well-trained waiters, the faults of omission and  commission must be endured with placid serenity.    After the ladies have all been served, the guests to the right of  the hostess must be attended to, then the guest on her left, and  so on until all are served. Ten persons are all that one cook can  properly prepare a dinner for, and three waiters will be amply  employed in waiting upon that number. If more are invited the  attempt to make the conversation general had better not be made,  but the guests allowed to converse _tete-a-tete_.    Wine should be handed by the waiters after soup. To decline wine  by covering the mouth of the wine-glass with the hand is an ill-  bred gesture. Say simply \"Not any, thank you,\" and the waiter will  not fill your glass.    Fish follows next in order. A slice, neatly _cut_, not hashed up  by bad carving, should be placed upon each plate, with a slice of  egg, and fish sauce. If there be a silver knife, use it to cut the  fish. If  not, take your fork in your right hand and supply the  place of the knife by a small piece of bread, which you should cut  off, and when your fish is eaten, leave upon your plate.    Do not eat as if you had good fare for the first time in your  life--that is to say, do not eat ravenously, and do not eat in a  noticeable way.    Never smack the lips when eating.      Never take a long, deep breath after you finish eating, as if the  exercise had fatigued you.    Never make noises in your mouth or throat.    Never suck your teeth, or pass your tongue round the outside of  your gums.    Never, even with cheese, put your knife into your mouth.    Never pick your teeth, or put your finger into your mouth.    If you find you have a fish-bone in your mouth, cover your lips  with a napkin to remove it. It is better to be very careful to  remove all bones before putting fish into your mouth. On no  account spit the bones out upon your plate.    Never take the bones of fowl or birds up in your fingers to gnaw or  suck them. Remove the meat with your knife, and convey it to your  mouth with your fork, never being too eager to clean off every  particle of flesh.    Wipe your finger tips, if soiled, upon the table napkin, never  upon your tongue or the table-cloth. An elegant eater will never  have occasion to think of his fingers.    Never use the table-cloth to wipe your mouth, you might as well  use it in place of your pocket handkerchief.    Never remark upon what is placed before you, either in praise or  dispraise of it.    Neither drink nor speak when you have anything in your mouth.    When you are helped, begin to eat, without regard to those who  have already, or have not yet, been helped.    Never watch the dishes as they are uncovered, nor make any  exclamation when you see their contents.    Under no circumstances tuck your napkin, bib-fashion, into your  shirt collar. Unfold it partially and put it in your lap, covering  your knees. A lady may slip a corner under her belt if there is  danger of its slipping upon her dress, but a gentleman must be  awkward indeed if he lets his napkin fall upon the floor.    No gentleman will ever settle himself in his chair, pushing back  his cuffs, as if for a \"set-to,\" at the table.    If you make any general remark, do not look up at the waiters to  see what effect it has upon them. If they are well-trained they  will not move a muscle at hearing the most laughable story, nor  will they give any sign whatever that they have not closed their  ears like deaf adders to all that has been going on. In any case,  however, you must refrain from noticing them.    If you want anything, take the occasion of a waiter being near to  you, to ask for it in an undertone. To shout out \"Waiter!\" or  order one about, as if you were in a restaurant, is a certain mark  of ill-breeding.    Unless the party is a very small one, general conversation is  impossible. In such a case, you must converse with those on either  side of you, not confining your remarks exclusively to one.    Talk in a low, quiet tone, but never in a whisper.    To affect an air of mystery or secrecy at a dinner-table, is an  insult to your companion and company assembled.    It is in bad taste to force the attention of the company upon  yourself by loud talking or loud laughing.    Too many jokes or anecdotes are in bad taste, but the subjects for  conversation should not be too serious.    Any gentleman propounding a conundrum at the dinner-table deserves  to be taken away by the police.    To use one's own knife, spoon or fingers, instead of the  butterknife, sugar-tongs or salt-spoons, is to persuade the  company that you have never seen the latter articles before, and  are unacquainted with their use.    Never eat all that is on your plate, and above all never be guilty  of the _gaucherie_ of scraping your plate, or passing your bread  over it as if to clean it.    Never fill your mouth so full that you cannot converse; at the  same time avoid the appearance of merely playing with"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/8492"],[0,"The King in Yellow (#12)"],[1,"was  something being hunted. Up and down the pedals chased him, while the  manuals blared approval. Poor devil! whoever he was, there seemed small  hope of escape!    My nervous annoyance changed to anger. Who was doing this? How dare he  play like that in the midst of divine service? I glanced at the people  near me: not one appeared to be in the least disturbed. The placid brows  of the kneeling nuns, still turned towards the altar, lost none of their  devout abstraction under the pale shadow of their white head-dress. The  fashionable lady beside me was looking expectantly at Monseigneur C----.  For all her face betrayed, the organ might have been singing an Ave  Maria.    But now, at last, the preacher had made the sign of the cross, and  commanded silence. I turned to him gladly. Thus far I had not found the  rest I had counted on when I entered St. Barnabe that afternoon.    I was worn out by three nights of physical suffering and mental trouble:  the last had been the worst, and it was an exhausted body, and a mind  benumbed and yet acutely sensitive, which I had brought to my favourite  church for healing. For I had been reading _The King in Yellow_.    \"The sun ariseth; they gather themselves together and lay them down in  their dens.\" Monseigneur C---- delivered his text in a calm voice,  glancing quietly over the congregation. My eyes turned, I knew not why,  toward the lower end of the church. The organist was coming from behind  his pipes, and passing along the gallery on his way out, I saw him  disappear by a small door that leads to some stairs which descend  directly to the street. He was a slender man, and his face was as white  as his coat was black. \"Good riddance!\" I thought, \"with your wicked  music! I hope your assistant will play the closing voluntary.\"    With a feeling of relief--with a deep, calm feeling of relief, I turned  back to the mild face in the pulpit and settled myself to listen. Here,  at last, was the ease of mind I longed for.    \"My children,\" said the preacher, \"one truth the human soul finds hardest  of all to learn: that it has nothing to fear. It can never be made to see  that nothing can really harm it.\"    \"Curious doctrine!\" I thought, \"for a Catholic priest. Let us see how he  will reconcile that with the Fathers.\"    \"Nothing can really harm the soul,\" he went on, in, his coolest, clearest  tones, \"because----\"    But I never heard the rest; my eye left his face, I knew not for what  reason, and sought the lower end of the church. The same man was coming  out from behind the organ, and was passing along the gallery _the same  way_. But there had not been time for him to return, and if he had  returned, I must have seen him. I felt a faint chill, and my heart sank;  and yet, his going and coming were no affair of mine. I looked at him: I  could not look away from his black figure and his white face. When he was  exactly opposite to me, he turned and sent across the church straight  into my eyes, a look of hate, intense and deadly: I have never seen any  other like it; would to God I might never see it again! Then he  disappeared by the same door through which I had watched him depart less  than sixty seconds before.    I sat and tried to collect my thoughts. My first sensation was like that  of a very young child badly hurt, when it catches its breath before  crying out.    To suddenly find myself the object of such hatred was exquisitely  painful: and this man was an utter stranger. Why should he hate me  so?--me, whom he had never seen before? For the moment all other  sensation was merged in this one pang: even fear was subordinate to  grief, and for that moment I never doubted; but in the next I began to  reason, and a sense of the incongruous came to my aid.    As I have said, St. Barnabe is a modern church. It is small and well  lighted; one sees all over it almost at a glance. The organ gallery gets  a strong white light from a row of long windows in the clerestory, which  have not even coloured glass.    The pulpit being in the middle of the church, it followed that, when I  was turned toward it, whatever moved at the west end could not fail to  attract my eye. When the organist passed it was no wonder that I saw him:  I had simply miscalculated the interval between his first and his second  passing. He had come in that last time by the other side-door. As for the  look which had so upset me, there had been no such thing, and I was a  nervous fool.    I looked about. This was a likely place to harbour supernatural horrors!  That clear-cut, reasonable face of Monseigneur C----, his collected  manner and easy, graceful gestures, were they not just a little  discouraging to the notion of a gruesome mystery? I glanced above his  head, and almost laughed. That flyaway lady supporting one corner of the  pulpit canopy, which looked like a fringed damask table-cloth in a high  wind, at the first attempt of a basilisk to pose up there in the organ  loft, she would point her gold trumpet at him, and puff him out of  existence! I laughed to myself over this conceit, which, at the time, I  thought very amusing, and sat and chaffed myself and everything else,  from the old harpy outside the railing, who had made me pay ten centimes  for my chair, before she would let me in (she was more like a basilisk, I  told myself, than was my organist with the anaemic complexion): from that  grim old dame, to, yes, alas! Monseigneur C---- himself. For all  devoutness had fled. I had never yet done such a thing in my life, but  now I felt a desire to mock.    As for the sermon, I could not hear a word of it for the jingle in my  ears of     \"The skirts of St. Paul has reached.    Having preached us those six Lent lectures,    More unctuous than ever he preached,\"    keeping time to the most fantastic and irreverent thoughts.    It was no use to sit there any longer: I must get out of doors and shake  myself free from this hateful mood. I knew the rudeness I was committing,  but still I rose and left the church.    A spring sun was shining on the Rue St. Honore, as I ran down the church  steps. On one corner stood a barrow full of yellow jonquils, pale violets  from the Riviera, dark Russian violets, and white Roman hyacinths in a  golden cloud of mimosa. The street was full of Sunday pleasure-seekers. I  swung my cane and laughed with the rest. Some one overtook and passed me.  He never turned, but there was the same deadly malignity in his white  profile that there had been in his eyes. I watched him as long as I could  see him. His lithe back expressed the same menace; every step that  carried him away from me seemed to bear him on some errand connected with  my destruction.    I was creeping along, my feet almost refusing to move. There began to  dawn in me a sense of responsibility for something long forgotten. It  began to seem as if I deserved that which he threatened: it reached a  long way back--a long, long way back. It had lain dormant all these  years: it was there, though, and presently it would rise and confront me.  But I would try to escape; and I stumbled as best I could into the Rue de  Rivoli, across the Place de la Concorde and on to the Quai. I looked with  sick eyes upon the sun, shining through the white foam of the fountain,  pouring over the backs of the dusky bronze river-gods, on the far-away  Arc, a structure of amethyst mist, on the countless vistas of grey stems  and bare branches faintly green. Then I saw him again coming down one of  the chestnut alleys of the Cours la Reine.    I left the river-side, plunged blindly across to the Champs Elysees and  turned toward the Arc. The setting sun was sending its rays along the  green sward of the Rond-point: in the full glow he sat on a bench,  children and young mothers all about him. He was nothing but a Sunday  lounger, like the others, like myself. I said the words almost aloud, and  all the while I gazed on the malignant hatred of his face. But he was not  looking at me. I crept past and dragged my leaden feet up the Avenue. I  knew that every time I met him brought him nearer to the accomplishment  of his purpose and my fate. And still I tried to save myself.    The last rays of sunset were pouring through the great Arc. I passed  under it, and met him face to face. I had left him far down the Champs  Elysees, and yet he came in with a stream of people who were returning  from the Bois de Boulogne. He came so close that he brushed me. His  slender frame felt like iron inside its loose black covering. He showed  no signs of haste, nor of fatigue, nor of any human feeling. His whole  being expressed one thing: the will, and the power to work me evil.    In anguish I watched him where he went down the broad crowded Avenue,  that was all flashing with wheels and the trappings of horses and the  helmets of the Garde Republicaine.    He was soon lost to sight; then I turned and fled. Into the Bois, and far  out beyond it--I know not where I went, but after a long while as it  seemed to me, night had fallen, and I found myself sitting at a table  before a small cafe. I had wandered back into the Bois. It was hours now  since I had seen him. Physical fatigue and mental suffering had left me  no power to think or feel. I was tired, so tired! I longed to hide away  in my own den. I resolved to go home. But that was a long way off.    I live in the Court of the Dragon, a narrow passage that leads from the  Rue de Rennes to the Rue du Dragon.    It is an \"impasse\"; traversable only for foot passengers. Over the  entrance on the Rue de Rennes is a balcony, supported by an iron dragon.  Within the court tall old houses rise on either side, and close the ends  that give on the two streets. Huge gates, swung back during the day into  the walls of the deep archways, close this court, after midnight, and one  must enter then by ringing at certain small doors on the side. The sunken  pavement collects unsavoury pools."]]]
