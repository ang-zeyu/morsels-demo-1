The Knight of the Leopard then disarmed himself of his heavy panoply,  his Saracen companion kindly assisting him to undo his buckler and  clasps, until he remained in the close dress of chamois leather, which  knights and men-at-arms used to wear under their harness. The Saracen,  if he had admired the strength of his adversary when sheathed in steel,  was now no less struck with the accuracy of proportion displayed in his  nervous and well-compacted figure. The knight, on the other hand, as, in  exchange of courtesy, he assisted the Saracen to disrobe himself of his  upper garments, that he might sleep with more convenience, was, on his  side, at a loss to conceive how such slender proportions and slimness of  figure could be reconciled with the vigour he had displayed in personal  contest.    Each warrior prayed ere he addressed himself to his place of rest. The  Moslem turned towards his KEBLAH, the point to which the prayer of each  follower of the Prophet was to be addressed, and murmured his heathen  orisons; while the Christian, withdrawing from the contamination of the  infidel's neighbourhood, placed his huge cross-handled sword upright,  and kneeling before it as the sign of salvation, told his rosary with  a devotion which was enhanced by the recollection of the scenes through  which he had passed, and the dangers from which he had been rescued, in  the course of the day. Both warriors, worn by toil and travel, were soon  fast asleep, each on his separate pallet.        CHAPTER IV.    Kenneth the Scot was uncertain how long his senses had been lost in  profound repose, when he was roused to recollection by a sense of  oppression on his chest, which at first suggested a flirting dream of  struggling with a powerful opponent, and at length recalled him fully  to his senses. He was about to demand who was there, when, opening his  eyes, he beheld the figure of the anchorite, wild and savage-looking as  we have described him, standing by his bedside, and pressing his right  hand upon his breast, while he held a small silver lamp in the other.    \"Be silent,\" said the hermit, as the prostrate knight looked up in  surprise; \"I have that to say to you which yonder infidel must not  hear.\"    These words he spoke in the French language, and not in the lingua  franca, or compound of Eastern and European dialects, which had hitherto  been used amongst them.    \"Arise,\" he continued, \"put on thy mantle; speak not, but tread lightly,  and follow me.\"    Sir Kenneth arose, and took his sword.    \"It needs not,\" answered the anchorite, in a whisper; \"we are going  where spiritual arms avail much, and fleshly weapons are but as the reed  and the decayed gourd.\"    The knight deposited his sword by the bedside as before, and, armed only  with his dagger, from which in this perilous country he never parted,  prepared to attend his mysterious host.    The hermit then moved slowly forwards, and was followed by the knight,  still under some uncertainty whether the dark form which glided  on before to show him the path was not, in fact, the creation of a  disturbed dream. They passed, like shadows, into the outer apartment,  without disturbing the paynim Emir, who lay still buried in repose.  Before the cross and altar, in the outward room, a lamp was still  burning, a missal was displayed, and on the floor lay a discipline, or  penitential scourge of small cord and wire, the lashes of which were  recently stained with blood--a token, no doubt, of the severe penance of  the recluse. Here Theodorick kneeled down, and pointed to the knight to  take his place beside him upon the sharp flints, which seemed placed for  the purpose of rendering the posture of reverential devotion as uneasy  as possible. He read many prayers of the Catholic Church, and chanted,  in a low but earnest voice, three of the penitential psalms. These last  he intermixed with sighs, and tears, and convulsive throbs, which bore  witness how deeply he felt the divine poetry which he recited. The  Scottish knight assisted with profound sincerity at these acts of  devotion, his opinion of his host beginning, in the meantime, to be so  much changed, that he doubted whether, from the severity of his penance  and the ardour of his prayers, he ought not to regard him as a saint;  and when they arose from the ground, he stood with reverence before  him, as a pupil before an honoured master. The hermit was, on his side,  silent and abstracted for the space of a few minutes.    \"Look into yonder recess, my son,\" he said, pointing to the farther  corner of the cell; \"there thou wilt find a veil--bring it hither.\"    The knight obeyed, and in a small aperture cut out of the wall, and  secured with a door of wicker, he found the veil inquired for. When he  brought it to the light, he discovered that it was torn, and soiled in  some places with some dark substance. The anchorite looked at it with  a deep but smothered emotion, and ere he could speak to the Scottish  knight, was compelled to vent his feelings in a convulsive groan.    \"Thou art now about to look upon the richest treasure that the earth  possesses,\" he at length said; \"woe is me, that my eyes are unworthy to  be lifted towards it! Alas! I am but the vile and despised sign, which  points out to the wearied traveller a harbour of rest and security, but  must itself remain for ever without doors. In vain have I fled to the  very depths of the rocks, and the very bosom of the thirsty desert. Mine  enemy hath found me--even he whom I have denied has pursued me to my  fortresses.\"    He paused again for a moment, and turning to the Scottish knight, said,  in a firmer tone of voice, \"You bring me a greeting from Richard of  England?\"    \"I come from the Council of Christian Princes,\" said the knight;  \"but the King of England being indisposed, I am not honoured with his  Majesty's commands.\"    \"Your token?\" demanded the recluse.    Sir Kenneth hesitated. Former suspicions, and the marks of insanity  which the hermit had formerly exhibited, rushed suddenly on his  thoughts; but how suspect a man whose manners were so saintly? \"My  password,\" he said at length, \"is this--Kings begged of a beggar.\"    \"It is right,\" said the hermit, while he paused. \"I know you well; but  the sentinel upon his post--and mine is an important one--challenges  friend as well as foe.\"    He then moved forward with the lamp, leading the way into the room which  they had left. The Saracen lay on his couch, still fast asleep. The  hermit paused by his side, and looked down on him.    \"He sleeps,\" he said, \"in darkness, and must not be awakened.\"    The attitude of the Emir did indeed convey the idea of profound repose.  One arm, flung across his body, as he lay with his face half turned to  the wall, concealed, with its loose and long sleeve, the greater part  of his face; but the high forehead was yet visible. Its nerves, which  during his waking hours were so uncommonly active, were now motionless,  as if the face had been composed of dark marble, and his long silken  eyelashes closed over his piercing and hawklike eyes. The open and  relaxed hand, and the deep, regular, and soft breathing, all gave tokens  of the most profound repose. The slumberer formed a singular group along  with the tall forms of the hermit in his shaggy dress of goat-skins,  bearing the lamp, and the knight in his close leathern coat--the former  with an austere expression of ascetic gloom, the latter with anxious  curiosity deeply impressed on his manly features.    \"He sleeps soundly,\" said the hermit, in the same low tone as before;  and repeating the words, though he had changed the meaning from that  which is literal to a metaphorical sense--\"he sleeps in darkness, but  there shall be for him a dayspring.--O Ilderim, thy waking thoughts  are yet as vain and wild as those which are wheeling their giddy dance  through thy sleeping brain; but the trumpet shall be heard, and the  dream shall be dissolved.\"    So saying, and making the knight a sign to follow him, the hermit went  towards the altar, and passing behind it, pressed a spring, which,  opening without noise, showed a small iron door wrought in the side  of the cavern, so as to be almost imperceptible, unless upon the most  severe scrutiny. The hermit, ere he ventured fully to open the door,  dropped some oil on the hinges, which the lamp supplied. A small  staircase, hewn in the rock, was discovered, when the iron door was at  length completely opened.    \"Take the veil which I hold,\" said the hermit, in a melancholy tone,  \"and blind mine eyes; For I may not look on the treasure which thou art  presently to behold, without sin and presumption.\"    Without reply, the knight hastily muffled the recluse's head in the  veil, and the latter began to ascend the staircase as one too much  accustomed to the way to require the use of light, while at the same  time he held the lamp to the Scot, who followed him for many steps up  the narrow ascent. At length they rested in a small vault of irregular  form, in one nook of which the staircase terminated, while in another  corner a corresponding stair was seen to continue the ascent. In a  third angle was a Gothic door, very rudely ornamented with the usual  attributes of clustered columns and carving, and defended by a wicket,  strongly guarded with iron, and studded with large nails. To this  last point the hermit directed his steps, which seemed to falter as he"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/13775"],[0,"Every Step in Canning: The Cold-Pack Method (#13)"],[1,"cup of sugar.    Red raspberries and blackberries require three-fourths of a cup of  sugar to every cup of juice. All fruits which require much water in  the cooking take three-fourths of a cup of sugar to every cup of  juice. Crab apples and cranberries are examples.    It is harder to make jellies from the fruits to which a large amount  of water is added than from the juicy fruits.    I am frequently asked, \"When should you add the sugar to the fruit  juice in jelly making? Do you add it at the beginning of the boiling,  in the middle of the process, or at the end, and should the sugar be  hot when added to the juice?\" It is better to add the sugar in the  middle of the jelly-making process than at the beginning or the end.  Skim the juice well before adding the sugar, so as to lose as little  sugar as possible.    If the sugar is hot when added it will not cool the juice, and thus  the cooking time will be shortened. To heat the sugar put it in a  granite dish, place in the oven, leaving the oven door ajar, and stir  occasionally. Be careful not to scorch it.    After the juice is put on, the jelly making should be done as quickly  as possible. No simmering should be allowed and no violent boiling. A  steady boiling, for as few minutes as possible, will produce good  results.    Currant, blueberry and grape jelly usually can be made in from eight  to ten minutes. The hot sugar is added at the end of four or five  minutes.    Raspberry, blackberry and apple jelly take from twenty to thirty  minutes. The sugar is added at the end of ten or fifteen minutes.    The jellying point is hard to determine. If you have a cooking  thermometer or candy thermometer always use it when making jelly. It  is the one sure, reliable test.    The temperature for jellies is 221 degrees Fahrenheit. If you want a  very soft jelly, boil it 220 degrees. If you want to use it  immediately, then boil it to 222 degrees.    If you do not have a thermometer the next best test is to pour the  boiling sirup from the side of a clean, hot spoon, held horizontally.  If the sirup is done two drops will break simultaneously from the side  of the spoon.    Another test is to take a little jelly on a cold plate and draw a path  through it with the point of a spoon; if the path stays and the juice  does not run together, the jellying point has been reached.    When the jellying point has been reached, remove the kettle from the  fire, skim the jelly and pour immediately into hot, sterilized  glasses, which have been set on a cloth wrung out of hot water to  prevent breaking. Fill the glasses not quite full.    Never attempt to make more than six to eight glasses of jelly at one  time. If new at the game make only four, because there is danger of  the juice jellying in the kettle before it can be removed.    When the jellies are well set cover them with _hot_, not merely  melted, paraffin. The paraffin if hot will kill any germs that may  fall on the surface of the jelly. Then cover with the clean tin or  aluminum covers and store the jelly in a dry, cool place after proper  labeling.      STEPS IN JELLY MAKING    1. Select firm, slightly underripe fruit that is fairly acid and  contains a large amount of pectin.    2. Prepare fruit as usual by washing, stemming, and so forth.    3. Heat slowly in acid-proof kettle until fruit is tender. Mash  berries before beginning to cook them. A little water may be added if  necessary to keep from burning. Cut hard fruits into small pieces; add  half as much water as fruit.    4. Pour into dampened bag.    5. Drain through closely woven bag.    6. Make alcohol test for pectin to determine minimum amount of sugar  to use, also the character of the fruit. The amount of pectin, the  fundamental jelly-making property, varies in different fruits. To  make the pectin test add to one tablespoonful of cold cooked fruit  juice one tablespoonful of grain alcohol. Shake gently. Allow to stand  one-half hour. If three-fourths or more of the juice forms a lump add  three-fourths as much sugar as juice in making jelly. If the  precipitate--pectin--is not held together in a lump or is less than  three-fourths of the whole volume of juice, add less sugar in  proportion to juice. If less than one-half forms a lump, add pectin to  make the jelly, or can the juice for use as a beverage, flavoring, and  so forth.    7. If fruit juice meets jelly-making test put on to cook.    8. Add required amount of sugar after juice begins to boil or midway  in the process.    9. Stir until sugar is dissolved.    10. Cook rapidly, but not hard.    11. Test to determine when jelly stage is reached by dipping a clean  spoon into boiling juice. Remove and allow juice to drip from it. If  done, two drops will break simultaneously from side of spoon. Some  prefer to wait until mass sheets off from side of spoon. Better still,  use thermometer.    12. Remove from fire and skim.    13. Pour immediately into hot, sterilized glasses.    14. When cool add hot melted paraffin. Melt the paraffin in a little  coffeepot or pitcher with spout, so it will pour easily.    15. Cover, label and store.    No time can be given for jelly making, for several things enter into  consideration: The proportion of pectin in the juice, the amount of  water used in cooking the fruit and the proportion of sugar to juice;  the more sugar used, the less time needed.      JAMS AND BUTTERS    Jams and butters are not so difficult to make as jellies.    1. Carefully wash berries and fruits.    2. Weigh the fruit on standard scales or, if scales are not  convenient, use measuring cup.    3. Mash berries. Cut large fruits into several pieces.    4. Add enough water to prevent sticking.    5. Stir to keep from burning.    6. Cook gently until the mass begins to thicken.    7. Measure sugar, using three-fourths part of sugar to one part fruit.  That is, for every pound of fruit use three-fourths of a pound of  sugar, or to every cup of fruit use three-fourths of a cup of sugar.    8. Continue cooking, allowing the jam to simmer gently.    9. Cook the mixture until the desired consistency is reached. When a  little of the jam falls in heavy drops from the spoon, it is thick  enough.    10. A small amount of mixed ground spices, vinegar or crystallized  ginger can be added if desired.    11. Pour into hot, sterilized glasses to within one-half inch of the  top.    12. Allow to cool, seal with paraffin, cover, label and store.    Fruit butters are always softer than jam. Marmalades are made much as  are jams. The rind is usually used in lemon, orange and grapefruit  marmalades.    Conserves consist of a combination of several fruits. Nuts and raisins  are often added to conserves.    Preserves are thick mixtures containing sugar equal to at least  three-fourths of the weight of the fruit.    If you wish to eliminate the necessity of using paraffin or other wax  tops for jellies, jams and preserves, you can use the cold-pack method  of canning. You may have containers with screw or bail tops which you  wish to use in this way. The following is one recipe showing how to  proceed.    Cherry Preserves. Place one gallon of water in a kettle and add ten  pounds of pitted cherries. Boil slowly for eighteen minutes. Add  twelve pounds of granulated sugar and cook until product is boiling at  a temperature of 219 degrees. Cool quickly in shallow pans. Pack into  glass jars. Put rubber and cap in position, not tight. Cap and tip if  using enameled tin cans. If using a hot-water-bath outfit, sterilize  twenty minutes; if using a water-seal outfit, a five-pound  steam-pressure outfit or a pressure-cooker outfit, sterilize fifteen  minutes. Remove jars. Tighten covers. Invert to cool and test the  joints. Wrap jars with paper to prevent bleaching and store. When  using pressure-cooker outfits on preserves, keep the valve open during  period of sterilization.    Fruit Juices. Fruit juices furnish a healthful and delicious drink  and are readily canned at home. Grapes, raspberries and other small  fruits may be crushed in a fruit press or put in a cloth sack, heated  for thirty minutes, or until the juice runs freely, and allowed to  drip.    Strain through two thicknesses of cotton flannel to remove the  sediment, sweeten slightly, bottle, close by filling the neck of the  bottle with a thick pad of sterilized cotton, heat to 160 degrees, or  until air bubbles begin to form on the bottom of the cooker, and keep  at this temperature one hour and a half to two hours; or heat to 200  degrees, or until the bubbles begin to rise to the top of the water,  and hold at this temperature for thirty minutes. The hot water comes  up to the neck of the bottle. Cork without removing the cotton. If  canned in jars close the jar partly, and seal tight after cooking.    Fruit juices should never be heated above 200 degrees, as a higher  temperature injures the flavor.    Strawberry Preserves. 1. Add thirty-five ounces of sugar to one-half  pint of water; bring to a boil and skim.    With this amount of sirup the berries can be packed attractively  without floating and no sirup will be left over.    To this amount of sirup add exactly two and three-fourths pounds of  washed, capped and stemmed strawberries. Boil the fruit until it  registers 222 degrees Fahrenheit on a candy or chemical thermometer.  If no thermometer is available boil until the sirup is very  heavy--about as thick as molasses. Remove the scum.    Fill the sterilized jars full of hot berries. Pour in enough of the  hot sirup to fill the jar, leaving as little air space as possible.  Put sterilized rings and caps on at once, but do not fasten tightly.    Stand the sealed jars in tepid water up to their necks if possible.  Bring this water to a boil. Let pint jars stay in the boiling water  for at least fifteen minutes and quart jars at least twenty-five  minutes; then close caps tightly at once. At the conclusion of the  operation, stand each"]]]
