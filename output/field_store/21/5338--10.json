And thus the law itself becomes  the breeding ground of personal revenge, for Filangieri says aptly that  an innocent man grasps the dagger of the murderer, when the sword of  justice does not defend him.    Let us say at this point that the rigid application of compensation for  damages should never be displaced by imprisonment, because this would be  equivalent to sanctioning a real class distinction, for the rich can  laugh at damages, while the proletarian would have to make good a  sentence of 1000 lire by 100 days in prison, and in the meantime the  innocent family that tearfully waits for him outside, would be plunged  into desperate straits. Compensation for damages should never take  place in any other way than by means of the labor of the prisoner to an  extent satisfactory to the family of the injured. It has been attempted  to place this in an eclectic way on our law books, but this proposition  remains a dead letter and is not applied in Italy, because a stroke of  legislator's pen is not enough to change the fate of an entire nation.    These practical and efficient measures would be taken in the case of  lesser criminals. For the graver crimes committed by atavistic or  congenital criminals, of by persons inclining toward crime from acquired  habit or mental alienation, the positive school of criminology reserves  segregation for an indefinite time, for it is absurd to fix the time  beforehand in the case of a dangerous degenerate who has committed a  grave crime.    The question of indeterminate sentences has been recently discussed also  by Pessina, who combats it, of course, because the essence of the  classic school of criminology is retribution for a fault by means of  corresponding punishment. We might reply that no human judge can use any  other but the grossest scale by which to determine whether you are  responsible to the extent of the whole, one half, or one third. And  since there is no absolute or objective criterion by which the ratio of  crime to punishment can be determined, penal justice becomes a game of  chance. But we content ourselves by pointing out that segregation for an  indefinite time has so much truth in it, that even the most orthodox of  the classic school admit it, for instance in the case of criminals under  age. Now, if an indeterminate sentence is a violation of the principles  of the classic school, I cannot understand why it can be admitted in the  case of minors, but not in the case of adults. This is evidently an  expedient imposed by the exigencies of practical life, and only the  positive school of criminology can meet them by a logical  systematization. For the rest, indefinite segregation, such as we  propose for the most dangerous atavistic criminals, is a measure which  is already in use for ordinary lunatics as well us for criminal  lunatics. But it may be said that this is an administrative measure, not  a court sentence. Well, if any one is so fond of formulas as to make  this objection, he may get all the fun out of them that he likes. But it  is a fact that an insane person who has committed a crime is sent to a  building with iron bars on its gates such as a prison has. You may call  it an administrative building or a penal institute, the name is  unessential, for the substance alone counts. We maintain that congenital  or pathological criminals cannot be locked up for a definite term in any  institution, but should remain there until they are adapted for the  normal life of society.    This radical reform of principles carries with it a radical  transformation of details. Given an indeterminate segregation, there  should be organs of guardianship for persons so secluded, for instance  permanent committees for the periodical revision of sentences. In the  future, the criminal judge will always secure ample evidence to prove  whether a defendant is really guilty, for this is the fundamental point.  If it is certain that he has committed the crime, he should either be  excluded from social intercourse or sentenced to mate good the damage,  provided the criminal is not dangerous and the crime not grave. It is  absurd to sentence a man to five or six days imprisonment for some  insignificant misdemeanor. You lower him in the eyes of the public,  subject him to surveillance by the police, and send him to prison from  whence he will go out more corrupted than he was on entering it. It is  absurd to impose segregation in prison for small errors. Compensation  for injuries is enough. For the segregation of the graver criminals, the  management must be as scientific as it is now in insane asylums. It is  absurd to place an old pensioned soldier or a hardened bureaucrat at the  head of a penal institution. It is enough to visit one of those  compulsory human beehives and to see how a military discipline carries a  brutal hypocrisy into it. The management of such institutions must be  scientific, and the care of their inmates must be scientific, since a  grave crime is always a manifestation of the pathological condition of  the individual. In America there are already institutions, such as the  Elmira Reformatory, where the application of the methods of the positive  school of criminology has been solemnly promised. The director of the  institution is a psychologist, a physician. When a criminal under age is  brought in, he is studied from the point of view of physiology and  psychology. The treatment serves to regenerate the plants who, being  young, may still be straightened up. Scientific therapeutics can do  little for relapsed criminals. The present repression of crime robs the  prisoner of his personality and reduces him to a number, either in mass  imprisonment which corrupts him completely, or in solitary confinement,  which will turn him into a stupid or raving beast.    These methods are also gradually introduced in the insane asylums. I  must tell you a little story to illustrate this. When I was a professor  in Pisa, eight years ago, I took my students to the penitentiaries and  the asylum for the criminal insane in Montelupo, as I always used to do.  Dr. Algieri, the director of this asylum, showed us among others a very  interesting case. This was a man of about 45, whose history was shortly  the following: He was a bricklayer living in one of the cities of  Toscana. He had been a normal and honest man, a very good father, until  one unlucky day came, in which a brick falling from a factory broke a  part of his skull. He fell down unconscious, was picked up, carried to  the hospital, and cured of his external injury, but lost both his  physical and moral health. He became an epileptic.    And the lesion to which the loss of the normal function of his nervous  system was due transformed him from the docile and even-tempered man  that he had been into a quarrelsome and irritable individual, so that  he was less regular in his work, less moral and honest in his family  life, and was finally sentenced for a grave assault in a saloon brawl.  He was condemned as a common criminal to I don't know how many years of  imprisonment. But in prison, the exceptional conditions of seclusion  brought on a deterioration of his physical and moral health, his  epileptic fits became more frequent, his character grew worse. The  director of the prison sent him to the asylum for the insane criminals  at Montelupo, which shelters criminals suspected of insanity and insane  criminals.    Dr. Algieri studied the interesting case and came to the diagnosis that  there was splinter of bone in the man's brain which had not been noticed  in the treatment at the hospital, and that this was the cause of the  epilepsy and demoralization of the prisoner. He trepanned a portion of  the skull around the old wound and actually found a bone splinter lodged  in the man's brain. He removed the splinter, and put a platinum plate  over the trepanned place to protect the brain. The man improved, the  epileptic fits ceased, his moral condition became as normal as before,  and this bricklayer (how about the free will?) was dismissed from the  asylum, for he had given proofs of normal behavior for about five or six  months, thanks to the wisdom of the doctor who had relieved him of the  lesion which had made him epileptic and immoral. If this asylum for  insane criminals had not been in existence, he would have ended in a  padded cell, the same as another man whom I and my students saw a few  years ago in the Ancona penitentiary. The director, an old soldier, said  to me: \"Professor, I shall show you a type of human beast. He is a man  who passes four fifths of the year in a padded cell.\" After calling six  attendants, \"because we must be careful,\" we went to the cell, and I  said to that director: \"Please, leave this man to me. I have little  faith in the existence of human beasts. Keep the attendants at a  distance.\" \"No,\" replied the director, \"my responsibility does not  permit me to do that.\"    But I insisted. The cell was opened, and the man came out of it really  like a wild beast with bulging eyes and distorted face. But I met him  with a smile and said to him kindly: \"How are you?\" This change of  treatment immediately changed the attitude of the man. He first had a  nervous fit and then broke into tears and told me his story with the  eloquence of suffering. He said that he had some days in which he was  not master of himself, but he recognized that he was good whenever the  attacks of temper were over. Without saying so, he thus invoked the  wisdom of human psychology for better treatment. There is indeed a  physician in those prisons, but he treats generally only the ordinary  diseases and is not familiar with special psychological knowledge. There  may be exceptions, and in that case it is a lucky coincidence. But the  prison doctor has also his practice outside and hurries through his  prison work. \"They simulate"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/10586"],[0,"Mike and Psmith (#13)"],[1," absurd. You must declare your innings closed. The game has  become a farce.\"    \"Declare! Sir, we can't unless Barnes does. He might be awfully annoyed  if we did anything like that without consulting him.\"    \"Absurd.\"    \"He's very touchy, sir.\"    \"It is perfect foolery.\"    \"I think Jenkins is just going to bowl, sir.\"    Mr. Downing walked moodily to his place.    In a neat wooden frame in the senior day room at Outwood's, just above  the mantlepiece, there was on view, a week later, a slip of paper.    The writing on it was as follows:      OUTWOOD'S _v_. DOWNING'S      _Outwood's. First innings_.      J.P. Barnes, _c_. Hammond, _b_. Hassall      33    M. Jackson, not out                         277    W.J.

Mike, if he had cared to  take the part, could have been the Petted Hero. But a cordial invitation  from the senior day room to be the guest of the evening at about the  biggest rag of the century had been refused on the plea of fatigue. One  does not make two hundred and seventy-seven runs on a hot day without  feeling the effects, even if one has scored mainly by the medium of  boundaries; and Mike, as he lay back in Psmith's deck chair, felt that  all he wanted was to go to bed and stay there for a week. His hands and  arms burned as if they were red-hot, and his eyes were so tired that he  could not keep them open.    Psmith, leaning against the mantlepiece, discoursed in a desultory way  on the day's happenings--the score off Mr. Downing, the undeniable  annoyance of that battered bowler, and the probability of his venting  his annoyance on Mike next day.    \"In theory,\" said he, \"the manly what-d'you-call-it of cricket and all  that sort of thing ought to make him fall on your neck tomorrow and weep  over you as a foeman worthy of his steel. But I am prepared to bet a  reasonable sum that he will give no jujitsu exhibition of this kind. In  fact, from what I have seen of our bright little friend, I should say  that, in a small way, he will do his best to make it distinctly hot for  you, here and there.\"    \"I don't care,\" murmured Mike, shifting his aching limbs in the chair.    \"In an ordinary way, I suppose, a man can put up with having his bowling  hit a little. But your performance was cruelty to animals. Twenty-eight  off one over, not to mention three wides, would have made Job foam at  the mouth. You will probably get sacked. On the other hand, it's worth  it. You have lit a candle this day which can never be blown out. You  have shown the lads of the village how Comrade Downing's bowling ought  to be treated. I don't suppose he'll ever take another wicket.\"    \"He doesn't deserve to.\"    Psmith smoothed his hair at the glass and turned round again.    \"The only blot on this day of mirth and goodwill is,\" he said, \"the  singular conduct of our friend Jellicoe. When all the place was ringing  with song and merriment, Comrade Jellicoe crept to my side, and,  slipping his little hand in mine, touched me for three quid.\"    This interested Mike, tired as he was.    \"What! Three quid!\"    \"Three crisp, crackling quid. He wanted four.\"    \"But the man must be living at the rate of I don't know what. It was  only yesterday that he borrowed a quid from _me_!\"    \"He must be saving money fast. There appear to be the makings of a  financier about Comrade Jellicoe. Well, I hope, when he's collected  enough for his needs, he'll pay me back a bit. I'm pretty well  cleaned out.\"    \"I got some from my brother at Oxford.\"    \"Perhaps he's saving up to get married. We may be helping toward  furnishing the home. There was a Siamese prince fellow at my dame's at  Eton who had four wives when he arrived, and gathered in a fifth during  his first summer holidays. It was done on the correspondence system. His  Prime Minister fixed it up at the other end, and sent him the glad news  on a picture post card. I think an eye ought to be kept on Comrade  Jellicoe.\"           *       *       *       *       *    Mike tumbled into bed that night like a log, but he could not sleep. He  ached all over. Psmith chatted for a time on human affairs in general,  and then dropped gently off. Jellicoe, who appeared to be wrapped in  gloom, contributed nothing to the conversation.    After Psmith had gone to sleep, Mike lay for some time running over in  his mind, as the best substitute for sleep, the various points of his  innings that day. He felt very hot and uncomfortable.    Just as he was wondering whether it would not be a good idea to get up  and have a cold bath, a voice spoke from the darkness at his side.    \"Are you asleep, Jackson?\"    \"Who's that?\"    \"Me--Jellicoe. I can't get to sleep.\"    \"Nor can I. I'm stiff all over.\"    \"I'll come over and sit on your bed.\"    There was a creaking, and then a weight descended in the neighborhood of  Mike's toes.    Jellicoe was apparently not in conversational mood. He uttered no word  for quite three minutes. At the end of which time he gave a sound midway  between a snort and a sigh.    \"I say, Jackson!\" he said.    \"Yes?\"    \"Have you--oh, nothing.\"    Silence again.    \"Jackson.\"    \"Hello?\"    \"I say, what would your people say if you got sacked?\"    \"All sorts of things. Especially my father. Why?\"    \"Oh, I don't know. So would mine.\"    \"Everybody's would, I expect.\"    \"Yes.\"    The bed creaked, as Jellicoe digested these great thoughts. Then he  spoke again.    \"It would be a jolly beastly thing to get sacked.\"    Mike was too tired to give his mind to the subject. He was not really  listening. Jellicoe droned on in a depressed sort of way.    \"You'd get home in the middle of the afternoon, I suppose, and you'd  drive up to the house, and the servant would open the door, and you'd go  in. They might all be out, and then you'd have to hang about, and wait;  and presently you'd hear them come in, and you'd go out into the  passage, and they'd say 'Hello!'\"    Jellicoe, in order to give verisimilitude, as it were, to an otherwise  bald and unconvincing narrative, flung so much agitated surprise into  the last word that it woke Mike from a troubled doze into which he  had fallen.    \"Hello?\" he said. \"What's up?\"    \"Then you'd say, 'Hello!' And then they'd say, 'What are you doing  here?' And you'd say--\"    \"What on earth are you talking about?\"    \"About what would happen.\"    \"Happen when?\"    \"When you got home. After being sacked, you know.\"    \"Who's been sacked?\" Mike's mind was still under a cloud.    \"Nobody. But if you were, I meant. And then I suppose there'd be an  awful row and general sickness, and all that. And then you'd be sent  into a bank, or to Australia, or something.\"    Mike dozed off again.    \"My father would be frightfully sick. My mater would be sick. My sister  would be jolly sick, too. Have you got any sisters, Jackson? I  say, Jackson!\"    \"Hello! What's the matter? Who's that?\"    \"Me--Jellicoe.\"    \"What's up?\"    \"I asked you if you'd got any sisters.\"    \"Any _what?_\"    \"Sisters.\"    \"Whose sisters?\"    \"Yours. I asked if you'd got any.\"    \"Any what?\"    \"Sisters.\"    \"What about them?\"    The conversation was becoming too intricate for Jellicoe. He changed the  subject.    \"I say, Jackson!\"    \"Well?\"    \"I say, you don't know anyone who could lend me a pound, do you?\"    \"What!\" cried Mike, sitting up in bed and staring through the darkness  in the direction whence the numismatist's voice was proceeding.  \"Do _what?_\"    \"I say, look out. You'll wake Psmith.\"    \"Did you say you wanted someone to lend you a quid?\"    \"Yes,\" said Jellicoe eagerly. \"Do you know anyone?\"    Mike's head throbbed. This thing was too much. The human brain could not  be expected to cope with it. Here was a youth who had borrowed a pound  from one friend the day before, and three pounds from another friend  that very afternoon, already looking about him for further loans. Was it  a hobby, or was he saving up to buy an airplane?    \"What on earth do you want a pound for?\"    \"I don't want to tell anybody. But it's jolly serious. I shall get  sacked if I don't get it.\"    Mike pondered.    Those who have followed Mike's career as set forth by the present  historian will have realized by this time that he was a good long way  from being perfect. As the Blue-Eyed Hero he would have been a rank  failure. Except on the cricket field, where he was a natural genius, he  was just ordinary. He resembled ninety percent of other members of  English public schools. He had some virtues and a good many defects. He  was as obstinate as a mule, though people whom he liked could do as they  pleased with him. He was good-natured as a general thing, but on  occasion his temper could be of the worst, and had, in his childhood,  been the subject of much adverse comment among his aunts. He was rigidly  truthful, where the issue concerned only himself. Where it was a case of  saving a friend, he was prepared to act in a manner reminiscent of an  American expert witness.    He had, in addition, one good quality without any defect to balance it.  He was always ready to help people. And when he set himself to do this,  he was never put off by discomfort or risk. He went at the thing with a  singleness of purpose that asked no questions.    Bob's postal order which had arrived that evening, was reposing in the  breast pocket of his coat.    It was a wrench, but, if the situation was so serious with Jellicoe, it  had to be done.    Two minutes later the night was being made hideous by Jellicoe's almost  tearful protestations of gratitude, and the postal order had moved from  one side of the dormitory to the other.        13    JELLICOE GOES ON THE SICK LIST      Mike woke next morning with a confused memory of"]]]
