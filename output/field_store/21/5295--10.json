Andirons seen in a dream, denotes good will among friends,  if the irons support burning logs; if they are in an empty fireplace,  loss of property and death are signified.    _Anecdote_.    To dream of relating an anecdote, signifies that you will greatly prefer  gay companionship to that of intellect, and that your affairs will prove  as unstable as yourself.    For a young woman to hear anecdotes related, denotes that she  will be one of a merry party of pleasure-seekers.    _Angels_.    To dream of angels is prophetic of disturbing influences in the soul.  It brings a changed condition of the person's lot.  If the dream  is unusually pleasing, you will hear of the health of friends,  and receive a legacy from unknown relatives.    If the dream comes as a token of warning, the dreamer may  expect threats of scandal about love or money matters.  To wicked people, it is a demand to repent; to good people it  should be a consolation.    _Anger_.    To dream of anger, denotes that some awful trial awaits you.  Disappointments in loved ones, and broken ties, of enemies  may make new attacks upon your property or character.    To dreams that friends or relatives are angry with you, while you meet their  anger with composure, denotes you will mediate between opposing friends,  and gain their lasting favor and gratitude.    _Angling_.    To dream of catching fish is good.  If you fail to catch any,  it will be bad for you.    _Annoy_.    This dream denotes that you have enemies who are at work against you.  Annoyances experienced in dreams are apt to find speedy fulfilment  in the trifling incidents of the following day.    _Antelope_.    Seeing antelopes in a dream, foretells your ambitions will be high,  but may be realized by putting forth great energy.    For a young woman to see an antelope miss its footing and fall from a height,  denotes the love she aspires to will prove her undoing.    _Ants_.    The dreamer of ants should expect many petty annoyances during the day;  chasing little worries, and finding general dissatisfaction in all things.    _Anvil_.    To see hot iron with sparks flying, is significant of a pleasing work;  to the farmer, an abundant crop; favorable indeed to women.  Cold, or small, favors may be expected from those in power.  The means of success is in your power, but in order to obtain it  you will have to labor under difficulty.  If the anvil is broken,  it foretells that you have, through your own neglect, thrown away  promising opportunities that cannot be recalled.    _Anxiety_.    A dream of this kind is occasionally a good omen, denoting,  after threatening states, success and rejuvenation of mind;  but if the dreamer is anxious about some momentous affair,  it indicates a disastrous combination of business and social states.    _Apes_.    This dream brings humiliation and disease to some dear friend.    To see a small ape cling to a tree, warns the dreamer to beware; a false  person is close to you and will cause unpleasantness in your circle.  Deceit goes with this dream.    _Apparel_.[16]    Dreams of apparel, denote that enterprises will be successes or failures,  as the apparel seems to be whole and clean, or soiled and threadbare.    To see fine apparel, but out of date, foretells that you will have fortune,  but you will scorn progressive ideas.    If you reject out-of-date apparel, you will outgrow present environments  and enter into new relations, new enterprises and new loves, which will  transform you into a different person.    To see yourself or others appareled in white, denotes eventful changes,  and you will nearly always find the change bearing sadness.    To walk with a person wearing white, proclaims that person's  illness or distress, unless it be a young woman or child,  then you will have pleasing surroundings for a season at least.    To see yourself, or others, dressed in black, portends quarrels,  disappointments, and disagreeable companions; or, if it refers  to business, the business will fall short of expectations.    To see yellow apparel, foretells approaching gaieties and financial progress.  Seen as a flitting spectre, in an unnatural light, the reverse may  be expected.  You will be fortunate if you dream of yellow cloth.    To dream of blue apparel, signifies carrying forward to victory  your aspirations, through energetic, insistent efforts.  Friends will loyally support you.    To dream of crimson apparel, foretells that you will escape formidable  enemies by a timely change in your expressed intention.    To see green apparel, is a hopeful sign of prosperity and happiness.    To see many colored apparel, foretells swift changes, and intermingling  of good and bad influences in your future.    To dream of misfitting apparel, intimates crosses in your affections,  and that you are likely to make a mistake in some enterprise.    To see old or young in appropriate apparel, denotes that you  will undertake some engagement for which you will have no liking,  and which will give rise to many cares.    For a woman to dream that she is displeased with her apparel,  foretells that she will find many vexatious rivalries in her quest  for social distinction.    To admire the apparel of others, denotes that she will have jealous  fears of her friends.    To dream of the loss of any article of apparel, denotes disturbances  in your business and love affairs.    For a young woman to dream of being attired in a guazy black costume,  foretells she will undergo chastening sorrow and disappointment.    For a young woman to dream that she meets another attired in a crimson dress  with a crepe mourning veil over her face, foretells she will be outrivaled  by one she hardly considers her equal, and bitter disappointment will sour  her against women generally.    The dreamer interpreting the dream of apparel should be careful  to note whether the objects are looking natural.  If the faces are  distorted and the light unearthly, though the colors are bright,  beware; the miscarriage of some worthy plan will work you harm.  There are few dreams in which the element of evil is wanting,  as there are few enterprises in waking life from which the element  of chance is obviated.    [16] See Clothes and Coat.    _Apparition_.    Take unusual care of all depending upon you.  Calamity awaits you and yours.  Both property and life are in danger.  Young people should be  decidedly upright in their communications with the opposite sex.  Character is likely to be rated at a discount.    _Apples_.    This is a very good dream to the majority of people.    To see red apples on trees with green foliage is exceedingly propitious  to the dreamer.    To eat them is not as good, unless they be faultless.  A friend who interprets dreams says:  ``Ripe apples on a tree,  denotes that the time has arrived for you to realize your hopes;  think over what you intend to do, and go fearlessly ahead.  Ripe on the top of the tree, warns you not to aim too high.  Apples on the ground imply that false friends, and flatterers  are working you harm.  Decayed apples typify hopeless efforts.''    _Apprentice_.    To dream that you serve as an apprentice, foretells you will have a struggle  to win a place among your companions    _Apricot_.    Dreams of seeing apricots growing, denote that the future, though seemingly  rosy hued, holds masked bitterness and sorrow for you.    To eat them signifies the near approach of calamitous influences.  If others eat them, your surroundings will be unpleasant  and disagreeable to your fancies.  A friend says:  ``Apricots denote that you have been wasting time over trifles  or small things of no value.''    _April_.    To dream of the month of April, signifies that much pleasure  and profit will be your allotment.  If the weather is miserable,  it is a sign of passing ill luck.    _Apron_.    To dream of an apron, signifies a zigzag course, for a young woman.  For a school girl to dream that her apron is loosened, or torn,  implies bad lessons, and lectures in propriety from parents and teachers.    _Arch_.    An arch in a dream, denotes your rise to distinction and the gaining of wealth  by persistent effort.  To pass under one, foretells that many will seek you  who formerly ignored your position.    For a young woman to see a fallen arch, denotes the destruction of her hopes,  and she will be miserable in her new situation.    _Archbishop_.    To dream of seeing an archbishop, foretells you will have many obstacles  to resist in your attempt to master fortune or rise to public honor.  To see one in the every day dress of a common citizen, denotes you  will have aid and encouragement from those in prominent positions  and will succeed in your enterprises.    For a young woman to dream that an archbishop is kindly directing her,  foretells she will be fortunate in forming her friendships.    _Architect_.    Architects drawing plans in your dreams, denotes a change in your business,  which will be likely to result in loss to you.    For a young woman to see an architect, foretells she will meet rebuffs  in her aspirations and maneuvers to make a favorable marriage.    _Arm_.    To dream of seeing an arm amputated, means separation or divorce.  Mutual dissatisfaction will occur between husband and wife.  It is a dream of sinister import.  Beware of deceitfulness and fraud.    _Aroma_.    For a young woman to dream of a sweet aroma, denotes she will soon  be the recipient of some pleasure or present.    _Arrested_.[17]    To see respectable-looking strangers arrested, foretells that you desire  to make changes, and new speculations will be subordinated by the fear  of failure.  If they resist the officers, you will have great delight  in pushing to completion the new enterprise.    [17] See Prisoner.    _Arrow_.    Pleasure follows this dream.  Entertainments, festivals and pleasant  journeys "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/9368"],[0,"Welsh Fairy Tales (#12)"],[1," while keeping the Welsh meaning. They are also  Welsh in traits of character. Just as tens of thousands of Welsh  folks, among the first settlers of New England and the American  colonies are described in our histories as \"English\" people.    Now in early Cornwall there were many giants. Some were good but  others were bad. One of these, a right fine fellow, was named Tom, and  the other, a bad one, Blubb. This giant had had twenty wives, and was  awfully cruel. Nobody ever knew what became of the twenty maidens he  had married.    Sometimes people called the big fellow, that lived in a castle, Giant  Blunderbuss, but Blubb was his name for short. He was much taller than  the highest hop pole in Kent. He was made up mostly of head and  stomach, for his chief idea in living was to eat. His skull was as big  as a hogshead, or a push-ball, or a market wagon loaded with carrots.  Indeed, it was strongly suspected by most people that the big bone box  set on his shoulders was as hollow inside as a pumpkin, but that a  cocoanut would hold all the brains he had. At any rate, during one of  his fights with another giant, he had been given an awful thwack from  the other giant's club. Then the sound made, which was heard a long  distance away, was exactly like that when one pounds on an empty  barrel.    Now this Giant Blubb had built a mighty castle between a big hill and  a river. Under it were vaults of vast size, filled with treasures of  all sorts, gold, silver, jewels and gems. There were cells, in which  he kept his wives, after he had married them. It was the opinion of  his neighbors, that in every case, soon after the honeymoon was over,  he ate them up.    Yet, if even the devil ought to have his due; one should be fair to  this human monster, and we are bound to say that Giant Blubb denied  these stories as pure gossip. It is certain that such crimes as murder  and cannibalism never could be proved against him.    To guard his underground treasures, he had two huge and fierce dogs,  supposed to be named Catchem and Tearem. What they were really called  by their master was a secret. Yet anyone who had a piece of meat ready  to throw to them, and knew their names, which were pass words, could  first quiet them. Then he could walk by them and get the treasure.    Besides these dogs, the only living thing left in the castle when the  giant went out, was the latest Mrs. Blubb. Yet she was in constant  fear of her life, lest her big husband should sometime make a meal of  her. For even she had heard the story that Blubb was a cannibal and  looked at all plump women simply as delicacies, exactly as a boy peers  into the window of a candy shop.    What made all the country round hate this cruel giant was not wholly  on account of his awful appetite. It was because he had ruined the  King's High Road. Ever since the time of King Lud, whose name we read  in Ludgate Hill, in London, where His Cymric Majesty had lived, this  highway had been free to all. It ran all the way through Cornwall,  from Penzance, and thence eastward to London and beyond.    When Giant Blubb wished to enlarge his castle, he had the walls and  towers built down to the river's edge. This closed up the big road, so  that people had to go far around and up over the hill, or by boat  along the river. Such a roundabout way took much time and toil, and  was too much trouble for all.    Everybody had to submit to this extortion, until there came along  Giant Tom, of whom we shall now tell. His real name was Rolling Stone,  for he never stuck long in one place at a job, and cared not a  cucumber for money, or fine clothes.    This jolly fellow was very good-natured and popular, but often very  lazy. His mother talked with him many times, urging him to learn a  trade, or in some way make an honest living. She found it very hard to  keep anything in her larder, barn, pantry, or cellar, when he was at  home. He measured four feet across his shoulders and at every meal he  ate what would feed three big men. But as he could do six men's work,  when he had a mind to--as often he did--he was always welcome. In  fact, he was too popular for his own good.    One day, when ten common fellows were trying their utmost to lift a  big long log on a cart, and were unable to do it, Tom came along and  told them to stand back. Then he hoisted the tree on to the wain,  roped it into place, and told the cartman to drive on. Then they all  cheered him, and one of them lifted his Monmouth cap and cried out,  \"Hurrah for Giant Tom. He's the fellow to whip Giant Blubb.\"    \"He is! He is!\" they all cried in chorus.    \"Who is this Giant Blubb? Where does he live?\" asked Tom, rolling up  his sleeves, for he was just spoiling for a row with a fellow of his  size.    Then they told the story of how the big bully had ruined the King's  Highway, by building a great wall and tower across the road, to shut  it up, to the grief of many honest men.    \"Never mind, boys. I'll attend to his bacon,\" said Tom. \"Leave the  matter with me, and don't bother to tell the King about it.\"    Tom went the next day into town and hired himself out to a beer brewer  to drive the wagon. Perhaps he hoped, also, while in this occupation,  to keep down his thirst.    He asked the boss to give him the route that led past Giant Blubb's  castle, over the old King's Highway.    The master of the brewery saw through Tom's purpose. He winked, and  only said:    \"Go ahead, my boy. I'll pay you double wages, if you will open that  road again; but see that Giant Blubb does not get my load of kegs, or  that your carcass doesn't count with those of the twenty wives in his  vaults and make twenty-one.\"    Again he winked his eye knowingly to his workmen. Tom drove off. He  occupied all the room on the seat of the cart, which two men usually  filled and left plenty of room on either side.    Cracking his whip, the new driver kept the four horses on a galloping  pace, until very soon he called out \"whoa,\" before the frowning high  gateway of Giant Blubb.    Tom shouted from the depth of his lungs:    \"Open the gate and let me drive through. This is the King's Highway.\"    The only reply, for a minute, was the barking of the curs. Then a  rattling of bolts was heard, and the great gates swung wide open.    \"Who are you, you impudent fellow? Go round over the hill, or I'll  thrash you,\" blustered Giant Blubb, in a rage.    \"Better save your breath to cool your porridge, you big boaster, and  come out and fight,\" said Tom.    \"Fight? You pigmy. I'll just get a switch and whip you, as I would a  bad boy.\"    Thereupon Giant Blubb stepped aside into the grove nearby, keeping all  the while an eye on his gate, guarded by his two monstrous dogs. He  selected an elm tree twenty feet high, tore it up by the roots, pulled  off the branches, and peeled it for a whip. This he jerked up and down  to make ready for his task of thrashing \"the pigmy.\"    Meanwhile Giant Tom upset the wain, drew out the tongue and took off  one of the wheels. Then, as if armed with spear and shield, he  advanced to meet Giant Blubb. He whistled like a boy, as he went  forward.    In a passion of rage, Giant Blubb lifted his elm switch to strike, but  Tom warded off the blow with his wheel shield. Then he punched him in  the stomach, with the wagon tongue, so hard that the big fellow  slipped and rolled over in the mud:    Picking himself up, Giant Blubb, now half blind with rage, rushed  against Tom, who, this time, made a lunge which planted the cart  tongue inside Blubb's bowels, and knocked him over.    But Tom was not a cruel fellow, and had no desire to kill anyone. So  he threw down his war tools, and tearing up a yard or two of grassy  sod rolled it together, and made a plug of it, as big around as a milk  churn. With this, he stopped up the big hole in Giant Blubb's huge  body.    But instead of thanking Tom, Giant Blubb rushed at him again. He was  in too much of a rage to see anything clearly, while Tom, perfectly  cool, gave the angry monster such a kick, in the place where he kept  his dinner, that he rolled over, and Tom gave him another kick. Then  the plug of sod fell out of his wound.    As he was bleeding to death, Giant Blubb beckoned to Tom to come up  close, for he could only whisper.    \"You've beaten me on the square, and I like you. Don't think I killed  my twenty wives. They all died naturally. But call the dogs by name,  and they will let you pass. Then, in my vaults, you'll find gold,  silver, and copper. Make these your own and bury me decently. This is  all I ask.\"    Tom made himself owner of the castle and all its treasures. He opened  the King's Highway again. He took care of his aged mother, married the  twenty-first wife of Giant Blubb, now a widow, and was always kind to  the sick and poor.    To-day in Cornwall, they still tell stories of the big fellow who  abolished Giant Blubb's toll gate.    Centuries afterward, when Christ's gospel came into the land, they  restored Giant Tom's tomb and on it were chiseled these words:    THE RESTORER OF PATHS TO DWELL IN.          XIII      A BOY THAT VISITED FAIRYLAND      Many are the places in Wales where the ground is lumpy and humpy with  tumuli, or little artificial mounds. Among these the sheep graze, the  donkeys bray, and the cows chew the cud.    Here the ground is strewn with the ruins of cromlechs, or Cymric  strongholds, of old Roman camps, of chapels and monasteries, showing  that many different races of men have come and gone, while the birds  still fly and the flowers bloom.    Centuries ago, the good monks of St. David had a school where lads  were taught Latin and good manners. One of their pupils was a boy  named Elidyr. He was such a poor scholar and he so hated books and  loved play, that in his case spankings and whippings were almost of  daily occurrence. Still he made no improvement. He was in the habit  also of playing truant, or what one of the"]]]
