It appeared that they had both been  about the same age as Bob Evers, and I pointed this out to my companion.  It was a particularly obvious remark to make; but Mrs. Lascelles turned  her face quickly to mine, and the colour left it in the half-lit,  half-haunted little room, which we happened to have all to ourselves.    \"Don't let him go up, Captain Clephane; don't let him, please!\"    \"Do you mean Bob Evers?\" I asked, to gain time while I considered what  to say; for the intensity of her manner took me aback.    \"You know I do,\" said Mrs. Lascelles, impatiently; \"don't let him go up  the Matterhorn to-night, or to-morrow morning, or whenever it is that he  means to start.\"    \"But, my dear Mrs. Lascelles, who am I to prevent that young gentleman  from doing what he likes?\"    \"I thought you were more or less related?\"    \"Rather less than more.\"    \"But aren't you very intimate with his mother?\"    I had to meet a pretty penetrating look.    \"I was once.\"    \"Well, then, for his mother's sake you ought to do your best to keep him  out of danger, Captain Clephane.\"    It was my turn to repay the look which I had just received. No doubt I  did so with only too much interest; no doubt I was equally clumsy of  speech; but it was my opportunity, and something or other must be said.    \"Quite so, Mrs. Lascelles; and for his mother's sake,\" said I, \"I not  only will do, I have already done, my best to keep the lad out of harm's  way. He is the apple of her eye; they are simply all the world to one  another. It would break her heart if anything happened to  him--anything--if she were to lose him in any sense of the word.\"    I waited a moment, thinking she would speak, prepared on my side to be  as explicit as she pleased; but Mrs. Lascelles only looked at me with  her mouth tight shut and her eyes wide open; and I concluded--somewhat  uneasily, I will confess--that she saw for herself what I meant.    \"As for the Matterhorn,\" I went on, \"that, I believe, is not such a very  dangerous exploit in these days. There are permanent chains and things  where there used to be polished precipices. It makes the real  mountaineers rather scornful; anyone with legs and a head, they will  tell you, can climb the Matterhorn nowadays. If I had the legs I'd go  with him, like a shot.\"    \"To share the danger, I suppose?\"    \"And the sport.\"    \"Ah,\" said Mrs. Lascelles, \"and the sport, of course! I had forgotten  that!\"    Yet I did not perceive that I had been found out, for nothing was  further from my mind than to prolong the parable to which I had stooped  in passing a few moments before. It had served its purpose, I conceived.  I had given my veiled warning; it never occurred to me that Mrs.  Lascelles might be indulging in a veiled retort. I thought she was  annoyed at the hint that I had given her. I began to repent of that  myself. It had quite spoilt our day, and so many and long were the  silences, as we wandered from little shop to little shop, and finally  with relief to the train, that I had plenty of time to remember how much  we had found to talk about all the morning.    But matters were coming to a head in spite of me, for Bob Evers waylaid  us on our return, and, with hardly a word to Mrs. Lascelles, straightway  followed me to my room. He was pale with a suppressed anger which flared  up even as he closed my door behind him, but though his honest face was  now in flames, he still kept control of his tongue.    \"I want you to lend me one of those sticks of yours,\" he said, quietly;  \"the heaviest, for choice.\"    \"What the devil for?\" I demanded, thinking for the moment of no  shoulders but my own.    \"To give that bounder Quinby the licking he deserves!\" cried Bob: \"to  give it him now at once, when the post comes in, and there are plenty of  people about to see the fun. Do you know what he's been saying and  spreading all over the place?\"    \"No,\" I answered, my heart sinking within me. \"What has he been saying?\"    The colour altered on Bob's face, altered and softened to a veritable  blush, and his eyes avoided mine.    \"I'm ashamed to tell you, it makes me so sick,\" he said, disgustedly.  \"But the fact is that he's been spreading a report about Mrs. Lascelles;  it has nothing on earth to do with me. It appears he only heard it  himself this morning, by letter, but the brute has made good use of his  time! _I_ only got wind of it an hour or two ago, of course quite by  accident, and I haven't seen the fellow since; but he's particularly  keen on his letters, and either he explains himself to my satisfaction  or I make an example of him before the hotel. It's a thing I never  dreamt of doing in my life, and I'm sorry the poor beast is such a  scarecrow; but it's a duty to punish that sort of crime against a woman,  and now I'm sure you'll lend me one of your sticks. I am only sorry I  didn't bring one with me.\"    \"But wait a bit, my dear fellow,\" said I, for he was actually holding  out his hand: \"you have still to tell me what the report was.\"    \"Divorce!\" he answered in a tragic voice. \"Clephane, the fellow says she  was divorced in India, and that it was--that it was her fault!\"    He turned away his face. It was in a flame.    \"And you are going to thrash Quinby for saying that?\"    \"If he sticks to it, I most certainly am,\" said Bob, the fire settling  in his blue eyes.    \"I should think twice about it, Bob, if I were you.\"    \"My dear man, what else do you suppose I have been thinking of all the  afternoon?\"    \"It will make a fresh scandal, you see.\"    \"I can't help that.\"    And Bob shut his mouth with a self-willed snap.    \"But what good will it do?\"    \"A liar will be punished, that's all! It's no use talking, Clephane; my  mind is made up.\"    \"But are you so sure that it's a lie?\" I was obliged to say it at last,  reluctantly enough, yet with a wretched feeling that I might just as  well have said it in the beginning.    \"Sure?\" he echoed, his innocent eyes widening before mine. \"Why, of  course I'm sure! You don't know what pals we've been. Of course I never  asked questions, but she's told me heaps and heaps of things; it would  fit in with some of them, if it were true.\"    Then I told him that it was true, and how I knew that it was true, and  my reason for having kept all that knowledge to myself until now. \"I  could not give her away even to you, Bob, nor yet tell you that I had  known her before; for you would have been certain to ask when and how;  and it was in her first husband's time, and under his name.\"    It was a comfort to be quite honest for once with one of them, and it is  a relief even now to remember that I was absolutely honest with Bob  Evers about this. He said almost at once that he would have done the  same himself, and even as he spoke his whole manner changed toward me.  His face had darkened at my unexpected confirmation of the odious  rumour, but already it was beginning to lighten toward me, as though he  found my attitude the one redeeming feature in the new aspect of  affairs. He even thanked me for my late reserve, obviously from his  heart, and in a way that went to mine on more grounds than one. It was  as though a kindness to Mrs. Lascelles was already the greatest possible  kindness to him.    \"But I am glad you have told me now,\" he added, \"for it explains many  things. I was inclined to look upon you, Duncan--you won't mind my  telling you now--as a bit of a deliberate interloper! But all the time  you knew her first, and that alters everything. I hope to out you still,  but I sha'n't any longer bear you a grudge if you out me!\"    I was horrified.    \"My dear fellow,\" I cried, \"do you mean to say this makes no  difference?\"    \"It does to Quinby. I must keep my hands off him, I suppose, though to  my mind he deserves his licking all the more.\"    \"But does it make no difference to _you_? My good boy, can you at your  age seriously think of marrying a woman who has been married twice  already, and divorced once?\"    \"I didn't know that when I thought of it first,\" he answered, doggedly,  \"and I am not going to let it make a difference now. Do you suppose I  would stand away from her because of anything that's past and over? Do  they stand away from us for--that sort of thing?\"    Of course I said that was rather different, with as much conviction as  though the ancient dogma had been my own.    \"But, Duncan, you know it's the very last thing you're dreaming of doing  yourself!\"    And again I argued, as feebly as you please, that it was quite different  in my case--that I was a good ten years older than he, and not my  mother's only son.    Bob stiffened on the spot.    \"My mother must take care of herself,\" said he; \"and I,\" he added, \"I  must take care of myself, if you don't mind. And I hope you won't, for  you've been most awfully good to me, you know! I never thought so until  these last few minutes; but now I sha'n't forget it, no matter how it  all turns out!\"          CHAPTER IX    SUB JUDICE      Well, I made a belated attempt to earn my young friend's good opinion. I  kept out of his way after dinner, and went in search of Quinby instead.  I felt I had a crow of my own to pluck with this gentleman, who owed to  my timely intervention a far greater immunity than he deserved. It was  in the little billiard-room I found him, pachydermatously applauding the  creditable attempts of Sir John Sankey at the cannon game, and as  studiously ignoring the excellent shots of an undistinguished clergyman  who was beating the judge. Quinby made room for me beside him, with a  civility which might have caused me some compunction, but I repaid him  by coming promptly to my point.    \"What's this report about Mrs. Lascelles?\" I asked, not angrily at all,  for naturally my feeling in the matter was not so strong as Bob's, but  with a certain contemptuous interest, if a man can judge of his own  outward manner from his"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/11204"],[0,"Diseases of the Horse's Foot (#13)"],[1,"from below on its wedge-shaped  mass. The movement of the plantar cushion will now be _downwards_ as well  as backwards; and, seeing that it is attached to the inner aspect of each  lateral cartilage, we shall expect these latter, by the downward movement  of the plantar cushion, to be drawn _inwards_. This Lungwitz has shown to  occur.    The chief function of the lateral cartilages, therefore, is to _receive  the concussion engendered by locomotion_, which concussion is directed  backwards and outwards by the pad-like plantar cushion.    In addition to this, the lateral cartilages, together with the plantar and  coronary cushions, _play the part of a valve to the whole of the veins of  the foot_.    It is in this way: We have only to refer to the chapter on anatomy to see  that the whole of the foot is covered with a tissue of extreme vascularity.  Thus we find papillae--the over the coronary cushion; enlarged and modified  papillae sensitive laminae--covering the anterior face of the os pedis; and  numberless papillae again covering the sole. There can be no doubt that the  quantity of fluid brought by the bloodvessels of these papillae to the foot  acts largely as a means of hydraulic protection to the soft structures.[A]  In like manner as that delicate organ, the brain, is best protected by  being floated upon the cerebro-spinal fluid and bloodvessels (which fluids  transmit waves of concussion or pressure _through_ the organ without injury  to the delicate cells forming it), so, in like manner, does the extreme  vascularity of the foot protect the cells of its softer structures from the  effects of pressure and concussion.    [Footnote A: The _Veterinary Record_, vol. iii., p. 518.]    That this law of hydraulics may operate in the horse's foot to the best  advantage, the veins must be provided with valves, and valves of no  mean strength. These we know to be absent. It is here that the lateral  cartilages and the elastic substances of the coronary and plantar cushions  step in to supply the deficiency.    At the time when weight is placed upon the foot (with, of course, a  tendency to drive the blood upwards in the limb), and, therefore, the time  when a valvular apparatus is needed to retain the fluid in the foot, we  find the wanting conditions supplied by the pressure outwards of the  plantar cushion compressing the large plexuses of veins on each side of the  lateral cartilages, to which plexuses, it will be remembered, the bulk  of the venous blood from the foot was directed. A more perfect valvular  apparatus, automatic and powerful, it would be difficult to imagine.      E. GROWTH OF THE HOOF.    We will conclude this chapter with a few brief remarks on the growth of  the hoof. That the rate of growth is slow is a well-known fact to every  veterinarian, and it will serve for all practical purposes when we state  that, roughly, the growth of the wall is about 1/4 inch per month. This  rate is regular all round the coronet, from which it follows that the time  taken for horn to grow from the coronary edge to the inferior margin  will vary according as the toe, the quarters, or the heels are under  consideration.    As might naturally be expected, the rate of growth will depend on various  influences. Any stimulus to the secreting structures of the coronet, such  as a blister, the application of the hot iron, or any other irritant,  results in an increased growth. Growth is favoured by moisture and by  the animal going unshod, as witness the effects of turning out to grass.  Exercise, a state of good health, stimulating diets--in fact, anything  tending to an increased circulation of healthy blood--all lead to increased  production of horn. With the effects of bodily disease and of ill-formed  legs and feet on the wear of the hoof, and the growth of horn, we shall be  concerned in a future chapter.        CHAPTER IV    METHOD OF EXAMINING THE FOOT      As a general rule, it may be taken that most diseases of the foot are  comparatively easy of diagnosis. When, however, the condition is one which  commences simply with an initial lameness, the greatest care will have to  be exercised by the practitioner.    What remarks follow here should rightly be confined to a treatise on  lameness. This much, however, we may state: As compared with lameness  arising from abnormal conditions in other parts of the limb, that emanating  from abnormalities of the foot is easy of detection. With a case of  lameness before him, concerning which he is in doubt, the practitioner  remembers that a very large percentage may safely be referred to the foot,  and, if wise, subjects the foot to a rigorous examination.    Much may be gathered by first putting the animal through his paces. When  at a trot, notice the peculiarity of the 'drop,' whether any alteration in  going on hard or soft ground, and watch for any special characteristic in  gait. At the same time inquiry should be made as to the history of the  case; its duration; whether pain, as evidenced by lameness, is constant or  periodic; the effect of exercise on the lameness; and the length of time  elapsed since the last shoeing.    This failing to reveal adequate cause for the lameness in any higher part  of the limb, one is led, by a process of negative deduction, to suspect  the foot. If 'pointing' is a symptom, its manner is noticed. The foot is  compared with the other for any deviation from the normal. In some cases  the two fore or the two hind feet may differ in size. Though this may not  necessarily indicate disease, it may, nevertheless, be taken into account  if the lameness is not easily referable to any other member. Measurement  with calipers will then be of help, and a pronounced increase in size,  especially if marked in one position only, given due consideration. The  hand is used upon each foot alternately to look for change of temperature,  to detect the presence of growths small enough to escape the eye, and to  discover evidence of painful spots along the coronet.    At this stage the method of percussion recommends itself, and in many cases  no more useful diagnostic agent is to be found than the ordinary hammer. As  a preliminary, the foot of the sound limb should be always tapped first.  This precaution will serve to bring to light what is frequently met  with--the aversion nervous animals sometimes exhibit to this manner of  manipulation of the hoof. Unless this is done, the ordinary objection to  interference is apt to be read as evidence of pain. No aversion to the  method being shown, the suspected foot is gently tapped in various places  round the wall, a keen look-out being kept for any manifestation of  tenderness. This may vary from a slight resentment to each tap, indicated  by a sudden lifting and setting down again of the foot, to a complete  removal of the foot from the ground, and a characteristic pawing of the air  that points out clearly enough the seat of pain.    Evidence of pain once given, the tapping is persisted in until, in some  cases, the exact position of the tender spot is definitely located.    Failing evidence obtained from percussion, attention should next be given  to the shoeing. We may add here that, even when difficulties have to be  encountered in doing it, it is always a wise plan to have the shoe removed.    The nails should be removed one by one, the course they have taken, their  point of emergence on the wall, and the condition of their broken ends all  being carefully noted as they are withdrawn.    The removed shoe should next be examined as to the coarseness or fineness  of its punching and the 'pitch' of its nail-holes, and close attention  given to the shape of its bearing surface.    From that we may pass to a consideration of the underneath surface of  the foot. The drawing-knife should be run lightly over the whole of its  surface, the first thing to be noticed being the point of entrance of the  nails as compared with the coarseness or fineness of the punching, and the  staining or otherwise of the horn immediately around. We may thus be guided  towards mischief arising from tight nailing apart from actual prick of the  foot.    This done, more than usual care should be taken in following up any other  small prick or dark spot that may show itself upon the white surface of the  cleaned sole. In any case, a suspicious-looking speck should be followed up  with the searcher until it is either cut out or is traced to the sensitive  structures.    While this is done, we should also have noticed the condition of the horn  at the seat of corn; should have noticed the shape of the heels, contracted  or otherwise; and the appearance of the frog, clean or discharging.    A point to be remembered in making this exploratory paring of the foot is  the peculiar consistency of the horn of the frog, and its tendency to hide  the existence of punctures. In like manner, as a pin pierces a piece of  indiarubber, and leaves no clearly visible trace of the hole it has made,  so does a nail or other sharp object penetrate the frog, leaving but little  to show for the mischief that has been done.    After all, even though we may have fully decided the foot is at fault, our  case of lameness may remain obscure so far as a cause is concerned. Nothing  remains, then, but to acknowledge the inability to discover it, to advocate  poulticing, or some other expectant palliative measure, and to bring the  case up for further examination at no distant date. Where, though we  may have suspected the foot, we have not been able to definitely assure  ourselves that there the mischief is to be found, a further method of  examination presents itself--namely, subcutaneous injections of cocaine  along the course of the plantar nerves.    The salt of cocaine used is the hydrochlorate, 2-1/2 grains for a pony,  4 grains for a medium-sized animal, and 6 grains for a large horse. A  solution of this is made in boiled water (about "]]]
