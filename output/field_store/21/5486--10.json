And first of the Special Rule of Church Government, viz. the Holy  Scriptures._      Touching the special difference, whereby church government is in this  description distinguished from all other governments whatsoever, it  consists of many branches, which will require more large explication and  confirmation; and shall be handled, not according to that order, as they  are first named in the description, but according to the order of  nature, as they most conduce to the clearing of one another, every  branch being distinctly laid down, as followeth:    The rule or standard of church government is only the holy Scriptures.  Thus in the description, church government is styled a power or  authority revealed in the holy Scriptures. For clearing hereof, take  this proposition, viz:    Jesus Christ our Mediator hath laid down in his word a perfect and  sufficient rule for the government of his visible Church under the New  Testament, which all the members of his Church ought to observe and  submit unto until the end of the world. For clearing this, weigh these  considerations:    1. The government of the visible Church under the New Testament is as  needful as ever it was under the Old Testament. What necessity of  government could be pleaded then, which may not as strongly be pleaded  now? Is not the visible Church of Christ a mixed body of sound and  unsound members, of fruitful and barren branches, of tares and wheat, of  good and bad, of sincere believers and hypocrites, of sheep and goats,  &c., now as well as it was then? Is there not as great cause to separate  and distinguish by church power, between the precious and the vile, the  clean and the unclean, (who are apt to defile, infect, and leaven one  another,) now as well as then? Ought there not to be as great care over  the holy ordinances of God, to preserve and guard them from contempt and  pollution, by a hedge and fence of government, now as well as then? Is  it not as necessary that by government sin be suppressed, piety  promoted, and the Church edified, now as well as then? But under the Old  Testament the Church visible had a perfect rule of church government,  (as is granted on all sides:) and hath Jesus Christ left his Church now  under the New Testament in a worse condition?    2. The Lord Jesus Christ (upon whose shoulder God hath laid the  government, Isa. ix. 6, and unto whom _all power both in heaven and in  earth is given_ by the Father to that end, Matt. xxviii. 18) _is most  faithful in all his house_, the Church, fully to discharge all the trust  committed to him, and completely to supply his Church with all  necessaries both to her being, and well-being ecclesiastical. Moses was  faithful in the Old Testament; for, as God gave him a pattern of church  government in the ceremonial law, so he did all things according to the  pattern; and shall the Lord Jesus be less faithful as _a son over his  own house,_ than was Moses as a servant over another's house? \"Consider  the Apostle and High Priest of our profession, Christ Jesus, who was  faithful to him that appointed him, as also Moses was faithful in all  his house--and Moses verily was faithful in all his house as a  servant--but Christ as a son over his own house, whose house are we,\"  Heb. iii. 1, 2, 5, 6. Yea, \"Jesus Christ, the same yesterday, and  to-day, and forever,\" Heb. xiii. 8, giving a pattern of church  government to Moses, and the church officers of the Old Testament, (the  Church being then as a child in nonage and minority, Gal, iv. 1, &c.,)  can we imagine he hath not as carefully left a pattern of church  government to his apostles, and the church officers of the New  Testament, the Church being now as a man come to full age and maturity?    3. The holy Scriptures are now completely and unalterably perfect,  containing such exact rules for the churches of God in all states and  ages, both under the Old and New Testament, that not only the people of  God, of all sorts and degrees, but also the men of God, and officers of  the Church, of all sorts and ages, may thereby be made perfect,  thoroughly furnished unto all good works. \"The law of the Lord is  perfect,\" Psal. xix. 7. \"All Scripture is given by inspiration of God,  and is profitable for doctrine, for reproof, for correction, for  instruction in righteousness, that the man of God may be perfect,  thoroughly furnished to every good work,\" 2 Tim. iii. 16, 17. And in his  first epistle to Timothy, (which is the Church's directory for divine  worship, discipline, and government,) he saith, \"These things write I  unto thee--that thou mightest know how thou oughtest to behave thyself  in the house of God, which is the Church of the living God,\" (this is  spoken in reference to matters of church government peculiarly,) 1 Tim.  iii. 14, 15. And the apostle, having respect to the former matters in  his epistle, saith to Timothy, and to all Timothies after him, \"I give  thee charge in the sight of God--that thou keep this commandment without  spot, unrebukable, until the appearing of our Lord Jesus Christ,\"  (therefore, this charge is intended for all ministers after Timothy to  the world's end,) 1 Tim. vi. 13, 14, compared with 1 Tim. v. 21, observe  _these things_. And the perfection of the whole scripture canon is  sealed up with that testimony in the close of the last book, \"If any man  shall add unto these things, God shall add unto him the plagues that are  written in this book: and if any man shall take away from the words of  the book of this prophecy, God shall take away his part out of the book  of life, and out of the holy city, and from the things which are written  in this book,\" Rev. xxii. 18, 19. Now, if the Scriptures be thus  accurately perfect and complete, they must needs contain a sufficient  pattern, and rules of church government now under the New Testament;  which rules are scattered here and there in several books of the word,  (as flowers grow scattered in the field, as silver is mingled in the  mine, or as gold is mixed with the sand,) that so God may exercise his  Church, in sifting and searching them out.    4. All the substantials of church government under the New Testament are  laid down in the word in particular rules, whether they be touching  officers, ordinances, censures, assemblies, and the compass of their  power, as after will appear; and all the circumstantials are laid down  in the word, under general rules of order, decency, and edification, 1  Cor, xiv. 40, and ver. 5,12, 26.    Consequently, there is a perfect and sufficient rule for church  government laid down in the Scriptures, which is obligatory upon all.          CHAPTER V.    _Of the Proper Author or Fountain, whence Church Government and the  authority thereof is derived by Divine Right, viz. Jesus Christ our  Mediator._      As the Scripture is the rule of church government, so Christ is the sole  root and fountain whence it originally flows; therefore, it is said in  the description, church government is a power or authority, derived from  Jesus Christ our Mediator. Take it in this proposition, viz:    Jesus Christ our Mediator hath all authority and power in heaven and in  earth, for the government of his Church, committed unto him from God the  Father. This is clearly evident,    1. By plain testimonies of Scripture, declaring that the government of  the Church is laid upon his shoulder, to which end the Father hath  invested him with all authority and power. \"The government shall be upon  his shoulder,\" &c., Isa. ix. 6,7. \"All power is given me in heaven and in  earth: go, disciple ye all nations,\" &c., Matt, xxviii. 18, 19. \"He shall  be great, and shall be called the Son of the Highest, and the Lord God  shall give unto him the throne of his father David; and he shall reign  over the house of Jacob forever, and of his kingdom there shall be no  end,\" Luke i. 32, 33. \"The Father judgeth no man, but hath committed all  judgment to the Son; and hath given him authority to execute judgment  also, because he is the Son of man,\" John v. 22, 27. \"The Father loveth  the Son, and hath given all things into his hand,\" John iii. 35. \"It is  he that hath the key of David, that openeth and no man shutteth, and  shutteth and no man openeth,\" Rev. iii. 7. \"God raised him from the  dead, and set him at his own right hand in the heavenly places, far  above all principality, and power, and might, and dominion, and every  name that is named, not only in this world, but also in that which is to  come: and hath put all things under his feet, and gave him to be the  head over all things to the Church, which is his body,\" Eph. i. 20-23,    2. By eminent princely titles, attributed unto Jesus Christ our  Mediator, having such authority, power, rule, and government legibly  engraven upon their foreheads, in reference to his Church.    \"A Governor which shall feed\" (or rule) \"my people Israel,\" Matt. ii. 6.  \"That great Shepherd of the sheep,\" Heb. xiii. 20. \"That Shepherd and  Bishop of our souls,\" 1 Pet. ii. ult. \"One is your master, Christ,\"  Matt, xxiii. 8, 10. \"Christ as a son over his own house,\" Heb. iii. 6.  \"The Head of the body the Church,\" Col. i. 18; Eph. v. 23. \"Head over  all things to the Church,\" Eph. i. 22. \"To us but one Lord Jesus  Christ,\" 1 Cor. viii. 6. \"Made of God both Lord and Christ,\" Acts ii.  36. \"Lord of lords,\" Rev. xix. 16. \"He is Lord of all,\" Acts x. 36.  \"God's King set on his holy hill of Zion,\" Psal. ii. 6. \"David their  king,\" Jer. xxx. 9; Ezek. xxxiv. 23, and xxxvii. 24; Hos. iii. 5. \"King  of kings,\" Rev. xix. 16.    3. By those primitive, fundamental, imperial acts of power, and supreme  authority in the government of the Church, which are peculiarly ascribed  to Jesus Christ our Mediator, as appropriate to him alone, above all  creatures, e.g.    1. The giving of laws to his Church. \"The law of Christ,\" Gal. vi. 2."]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/13944"],[0,"After London; Or, Wild England (#13)"],[1," had rendered him contemptuous of it.    \"There's no risk,\" said he, \"that I can see. Who could attack us? The  Bushmen would never dream of it; the Romany would be seen coming days  beforehand; we are too far from the Lake for the pirates; and as we are  not great people, as we might have been, we need dread no private  enmity. Besides which, any assailants must pass the stockades first.\"    \"Quite true. Still I don't like it; it is a loose way of doing things.\"    Outside the gate they followed the waggon track, or South Road, for  about half a mile. It crossed meadows parted by low hedges, and they  remarked, as they went, on the shortness of the grass, which, for want  of rain, was not nearly fit for mowing. Last year there had been a bad  wheat crop; this year there was at present scarcely any grass. These  matters were of the highest importance; peace or war, famine or plenty,  might depend upon the weather of the next few months.    The meadows, besides being divided by the hedges, kept purposely cropped  low, were surrounded, like all the cultivated lands, by high and strong  stockades. Half a mile down the South Road they left the track, and  following a footpath some few hundred yards, came to the pool where  Oliver had bathed that morning. The river, which ran through the  enclosed grounds, was very shallow, for they were near its source in the  hills, but just there it widened, and filled a depression fifty or sixty  yards across, which was deep enough for swimming. Beyond the pool the  stream curved and left the enclosure; the stockade, or at least an open  work of poles, was continued across it. This work permitted the stream  to flow freely, but was sufficiently close to exclude any one who might  attempt to enter by creeping up the bed of the river.    They crossed the river just above the pool by some stepping-stones,  large blocks rolled in for the purpose, and approached the stockade. It  was formed of small but entire trees, young elms, firs, or very thick  ash-poles, driven in a double row into the earth, the first or inner row  side by side, the outer row filling the interstices, and the whole bound  together at the bottom by split willow woven in and out. This  interweaving extended only about three feet up, and was intended first  to bind the structure together, and secondly to exclude small animals  which might creep in between the stakes. The reason it was not carried  all up was that it should not afford a footing to human thieves desirous  of climbing over.    The smooth poles by themselves afforded no notch or foothold for a  Bushman's naked foot. They rose nine or ten feet above the willow, so  that the total height of the palisade was about twelve feet, and the  tops of the stakes were sharpened. The construction of such palisades  required great labour, and could be carried out only by those who could  command the services of numbers of men, so that a small proprietor was  impossible, unless within the walls of a town. This particular stockade  was by no means an extensive one, in comparison with the estates of more  prominent nobles.    The enclosure immediately surrounding the Old House was of an irregular  oval shape, perhaps a mile long, and not quite three-quarters of a mile  wide, the house being situated towards the northern and higher end of  the oval. The river crossed it, entering on the west and leaving on the  eastern side. The enclosure was for the greater part meadow and pasture,  for here the cattle were kept, which supplied the house with milk,  cheese, and butter, while others intended for slaughter were driven in  here for the last months of fattening.    The horses in actual use for riding, or for the waggons, were also  turned out here temporarily. There were two pens and rickyards within  it, one beside the river, one farther down. The South Road ran almost  down the centre, passing both rickyards, and leaving the stockade at the  southern end by a gate, called the barrier. At the northern extremity of  the oval the palisade passed within three hundred yards of the house,  and there was another barrier, to which the road led from the Maple  Gate, which has been mentioned. From thence it went across the hills to  the town of Ponze. Thus, anyone approaching the Old House had first to  pass the barrier and get inside the palisade.    At each barrier there was a cottage and a guard-room, though, as a  matter of fact, the watch was kept in peaceful times even more  carelessly than at the inner gates of the wall about the House itself.  Much the same plan, with local variations, was pursued on the other  estates of the province, though the stockade at the Old House was  remarkable for the care and skill with which it had been constructed.  Part of the duty of the watchman on the roof was to keep an eye on the  barriers, which he could see from his elevated position.    In case of an incursion of gipsies, or any danger, the guard at the  barrier was supposed to at once close the gate, blow a horn, and exhibit  a flag. Upon hearing the horn or observing the flag, the warder on the  roof raised the alarm, and assistance was sent. Such was the system, but  as no attack had taken place for some years the discipline had grown  lax.    After crossing on the stepping-stones Oliver and Felix were soon under  the stockade which ran high above them, and was apparently as difficult  to get out of as to get into. By the strict law of the estate, any  person who left the stockade except by the public barrier rendered  himself liable to the lash or imprisonment. Any person, even a retainer,  endeavouring to enter from without by pole, ladder, or rope, might be  killed with an arrow or dart, putting himself into the position of an  outlaw. In practice, of course, this law was frequently evaded. It did  not apply to the family of the owner.    Under some bushes by the palisade was a ladder of rope, the rungs,  however, of wood. Putting his fishing-tackle and boar spear down, Oliver  took the ladder and threw the end over the stockade. He then picked up a  pole with a fork at the end from the bushes, left there, of course, for  the purpose, and with the fork pushed the rungs over till the ladder was  adjusted, half within and half without the palisade. It hung by the  wooden rungs which caught the tops of the stakes. He then went up, and  when at the top, leant over and drew up the outer part of the ladder one  rung, which he put the inner side of the palisade, so that on  transferring his weight to the outer side it might uphold him. Otherwise  the ladder, when he got over the points of the stakes, must have slipped  the distance between one rung and a second.    Having adjusted this, he got over, and Felix carrying up the spears and  tackle handed them to him. Felix followed, and thus in three minutes  they were on the outer side of the stockade. Originally the ground for  twenty yards, all round outside the stockade, had been cleared of trees  and bushes that they might not harbour vermin, or thorn-hogs, or  facilitate the approach of human enemies. Part of the weekly work of the  bailiffs was to walk round the entire circumference of the stockade to  see that it was in order, and to have any bushes removed that began to  grow up. As with other matters, however, in the lapse of time the  bailiffs became remiss, and under the easy, and perhaps too merciful  rule of Sir Constans, were not recalled to their duties with sufficient  sharpness.    Brambles and thorns and other underwood had begun to cover the space  that should have been open, and young sapling oaks had risen from  dropped acorns. Felix pointed this out to Oliver, who seldom accompanied  him; he was indeed rather glad of the opportunity to do so, as Oliver  had more interest with Sir Constans than himself. Oliver admitted it  showed great negligence, but added that after all it really did not  matter. \"What I wish,\" said he, \"is that Sir Constans would go to Court,  and take his proper position.\"    Upon this they were well agreed; it was, in fact, almost the only point  upon which all three brothers did agree. They sometimes talked about it  till they separated in a furious temper, not with each other but with  him. There was a distinct track of footsteps through the narrow band of  low brambles and underwood between the stockade and the forest. This had  been made by Felix in his daily visits to his canoe.    The forest there consisted principally of hawthorn-trees and thorn  thickets, with some scattered oaks and ashes; the timber was sparse, but  the fern was now fast rising up so thick, that in the height of summer  it would be difficult to walk through it. The tips of the fronds  unrolling were now not up to the knee; then the brake would reach to the  shoulder. The path wound round the thickets (the blackthorn being quite  impenetrable except with the axe) and came again to the river some four  or five hundred yards from the stockade. The stream, which ran from west  to east through the enclosure, here turned and went due south.    On the bank Felix had found a fine black poplar, the largest and  straightest and best grown of that sort for some distance round, and  this he had selected for his canoe. Stones broke the current here into  eddies, below which there were deep holes and gullies where alders hung  over, and an ever-rustling aspen spread the shadow of its boughs across  the water. The light-coloured mud, formed of disintegrated chalk, on the  farther and shallower side was only partly hidden by flags and sedges,  which like a richer and more alluvial earth. Nor did the bushes grow  very densely on this soil over the chalk, so that there was more room  for casting the fly than is usually the case where a stream runs through  a forest. Oliver, after getting his tackle in order, at once began to  cast, while Felix, hanging his doublet on an oft-used branch, and  leaning his spear against a tree, took"]]]
