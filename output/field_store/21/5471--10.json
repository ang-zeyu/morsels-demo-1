NONSENSE BOTANY      ONE HUNDRED NONSENSE PICTURES AND RHYMES      TWENTY-SIX NONSENSE RHYMES AND PICTURES          [Illustration]    INTRODUCTION.    In offering this little book--the third of its kind--to the public, I am  glad to take the opportunity of recording the pleasure I have received at  the appreciation its predecessors have met with, as attested by their wide  circulation, and by the universally kind notices of them from the Press. To  have been the means of administering innocent mirth to thousands, may  surely be a just motive for satisfaction, and an excuse for grateful  expression.    At the same time, I am desirous of adding a few words as to the history of  the two previously published volumes, and more particularly of the first or  original \"Book of Nonsense,\" relating to which many absurd reports have  crept into circulation, such as that it was the composition of the late  Lord Brougham, the late Earl of Derby, etc.; that the rhymes and pictures  are by different persons; or that the whole have a symbolical meaning,  etc.; whereas, every one of the Rhymes was composed by myself, and every  one of the Illustrations drawn by my own hand at the time the verses were  made. Moreover, in no portion of these Nonsense drawings have I ever  allowed any caricature of private or public persons to appear, and  throughout, more care than might be supposed has been given to make the  subjects incapable of misinterpretation: \"Nonsense,\" pure and absolute,  having been my aim throughout.    As for the persistently absurd report of the late Earl of Derby being the  author of the \"First Book of Nonsense,\" I may relate an incident which  occurred to me four summers ago, the first that gave me any insight into  the origin of the rumor.    I was on my way from London to Guildford, in a railway carriage,  containing, besides myself, one passenger, an elderly gentleman: presently,  however, two ladies entered, accompanied by two little boys. These, who had  just had a copy of the \"Book of Nonsense\" given them, were loud in their  delight, and by degrees infected the whole party with their mirth.    \"How grateful,\" said the old gentleman to the two ladies, \"all children,  and parents too, ought to be to the statesman who has given his time to  composing that charming book!\"    (The ladies looked puzzled, as indeed was I, the author.)    \"Do you not know who is the writer of it?\" asked the gentleman.    \"The name is 'Edward Lear,'\" said one of the ladies.    \"Ah!\" said the first speaker, \"so it is printed; but that is only a whim of  the real author, the Earl of Derby. 'Edward' is his Christian name, and, as  you may see, LEAR is only EARL transposed.\"    \"But,\" said the lady, doubtingly, \"here is a dedication to the  great-grandchildren, grand-nephews, and grand-nieces of Edward, thirteenth  Earl of Derby, by the author, Edward Lear.\"    \"That,\" replied the other, \"is simply a piece of mystification; I am in a  position to know that the whole book was composed and illustrated by Lord  Derby himself. In fact, there is no such a person at all as Edward Lear.\"    \"Yet,\" said the other lady, \"some friends of mine tell me they know Mr.  Lear.\"    \"Quite a mistake! completely a mistake!\" said the old gentleman, becoming  rather angry at the contradiction; \"I am well aware of what I am saying: I  can inform you, no such a person as 'Edward Lear' exists!\"    Hitherto I had kept silence; but as my hat was, as well as my handkerchief  and stick, largely marked inside with my name, and as I happened to have in  my pocket several letters addressed to me, the temptation was too great to  resist; so, flashing all these articles at once on my would-be  extinguisher's attention, I speedily reduced him to silence.    The second volume of Nonsense, commencing with the verses, \"The Owl and the  Pussy-Cat,\" was written at different times, and for different sets of  children: the whole being collected in the course of last year, were then  illustrated, and published in a single volume, by Mr. R.J. Bush, of 32  Charing Cross.    The contents of the third or present volume were made also at different  intervals in the last two years.    Long years ago, in days when much of my time was passed in a country house,  where children and mirth abounded, the lines beginning, \"There was an old  man of Tobago,\" were"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/13656"],[0,"A Series of Lessons in Raja Yoga (#13)"],[1," of _Raja Yoga_.  And many of its first exercises are designed to acquaint the student with  that realization, and to develop the realization and control by habit and  practice.    The Yogi Philosophy teaches that instead of Mind being the \"I.\" it is  the thing through and by means of which the \"I\" _thinks_, at least so  far as is concerned the knowledge concerning the phenomenal or outward  Universe--that is the Universe of Name and Form. There is a higher  Knowledge locked up in the innermost part of the \"I,\" that far transcends  any information that it may receive about or from the outer world, but  that is not before us for consideration at this time, and we must concern  ourselves with the \"thinking\" about the world of things.    Mind-substance in Sanscrit is called \"_Chitta_,\" and a wave in the  _Chitta_ (which wave is the combination of Mind and Energy) is called  \"_Vritta_,\" which is akin to what we call a \"thought.\" In other words it  is \"mind in action,\" whereas _Chitta_ is \"mind in repose.\" _Vritta_, when  literally translated means \"a whirlpool or eddy in the mind,\" which is  exactly what a thought really is.    But we must call the attention of the student, at this point, to the fact  that the word \"Mind\" is used in two ways by the Yogis and other  occultists, and the student is directed to form a clear conception of  each meaning, in order to avoid confusion, and that he may more clearly  perceive the two aspects of the things which the word is intended to  express. In the first place the word \"Mind\" is used as synonymous  with _Chitta_, or Mind-substance, which is the Universal Mind Principle.  From this _Chitta_, Mind-substance, or Mind, all the material of the  millions of personal minds is obtained. The second meaning of the word  \"Mind\" is that which we mean when we speak of the \"mind\" of anyone,  thereby meaning the mental faculties of that particular person--that  which distinguishes his mental personality from that of another. We have  taught you that this \"mind\" in Man, functions on three planes, and have  called the respective manifestations (1) the Instinctive Mind; (2) the  Intellect; and (3) the Spiritual Mind. (_See \"Fourteen Lessons in Yogi  Philosophy,\" etc._) These three mental planes, taken together, make up  the \"mind\" of the person, or to be more exact they, clustered around the  \"I\" form the \"soul\" of the individual. The word \"soul\" is often used as  synonymous with \"spirit\" but those who have followed us will distinguish  the difference. The \"soul\" is the Ego surrounded by its mental  principles, while the Spirit is the \"soul of the soul\"--the \"I,\" or Real  Self.    The Science of _Raja Yoga_, to which this series of lessons is devoted,  teaches, as its basic principle, the Control of the Mind. It holds that  the first step toward Power consists in obtaining a control of one's  own mind. It holds that the internal world must be conquered before the  outer world is attacked. It holds that the \"I\" manifests itself in  Will, and that that Will may be used to manipulate, guide, govern and  direct the mind of its owner, as well as the physical world. It aims to  clear away all mental rubbish, and encumbrances--to conduct a \"mental  house-cleaning,\" as it were, and to secure a clear, clean, healthy mind.  Then it proceeds to control that mind intelligently, and with effect,  saving all waste-power, and by means of concentration bringing the Mind  in full harmony with the Will, that it may be brought to a focus and its  power greatly increased and its efficiency fully secured. Concentration  and Will-power are the means by which the Yogis obtain such wonderful  results, and by which they manage and direct their vigorous, healthy  minds, and master the material world, acting positively upon Energy and  Matter. This control extends to all planes of the Mind and the Yogis not  only control the Instinctive Mind, holding in subjection its lower  qualities and making use of its other parts, but they also develop and  enlarge the field of their Intellect and obtain from it wonderful  results. Even the Spiritual Mind is mastered, and aided in its  unfoldment, and urged to pass down into the field of consciousness some  of the wonderful secrets to be found within its area. By means of _Raja  Yoga_ many of the secrets of existence and Being--many of the Riddles of  the Universe--are answered and solved. And by it the latent powers  inherent in the constitution of Man are unfolded and brought into action.  Those highly advanced in the science are believed to have obtained such a  wonderful degree of power and control over the forces of the universe,  that they are as gods compared with the ordinary man.    _Raja Yoga_ teaches that not only may power of this kind be secured, but  that a wonderful field of Knowledge is opened out through its practice.  It holds that when the concentrated mind is focused upon thing or  subject, the true nature and inner meaning, of, and concerning, that  thing or subject will be brought to view. The concentrated mind passes  through the object or subject just as the X-Ray passes through a block of  wood, and the thing is seen by the \"I\" as it _is_--in truth--and not as  it had appeared before, imperfectly and erroneously. Not only may the  outside world be thus explored, but the mental ray may be turned inward,  and the secret places of the mind explored. When it is remembered that  the bit of mind that each man possesses, is like a drop of the ocean  which contains within its tiny compass all the elements that make up the  ocean, and that to know perfectly the drop is to know perfectly the  ocean, then we begin to see what such a power really means.    Many in the Western world who have attained great results in the  intellectual and scientific fields of endeavor, have developed these  powers more or less unconsciously. Many great inventors are practical  Yogis, although they do not realize the source of their power. Anyone who  is familiar with the personal mental characteristics of Edison, will see  that he follows some of the _Raja Yoga_ methods, and that Concentration  is one of his strongest weapons. And from all reports, Prof. Elmer Gates,  of Washington, D.C., whose mind has unfolded many wonderful discoveries  and inventions, is also a practical Yogi although he may repudiate the  assertion vigorously, and may not have familiarized himself with the  principles of this science, which he has \"dropped into\" unconsciously.  Those who have reported upon Prof. Gates' methods, say that he fairly  \"digs out\" the inventions and discoveries from his mind, after going  into seclusion and practicing concentration, and what is known as the  Mental Vision.    But we have given you enough of theory for one lesson, and must begin to  give you directions whereby you may aid yourself in developing these  latent powers and unfolding these dormant energies. You will notice that  in this series we first tell you something about the theory, and then  proceed to give you \"something to do.\" This is the true Yogi method as  followed and practiced by their best teachers. Too much theory is  tiresome, and sings the mind to sleep, while too much exercise tires one,  and does not give the inquiring part of his mind the necessary food. To  combine both in suitable proportions is the better plan, and one that we  aim to follow.      MENTAL DRILL AND EXERCISES.    Before we can get the mind to do good work for us, we must first \"tame\"  it, and bring it to obedience to the Will of the \"I.\" The mind, as a  rule, has been allowed to run wild, and follow its own sweet will and  desires, without regard to anything else. Like a spoiled child or badly  trained domestic animal, it gets into much trouble, and is of very little  pleasure, comfort or use. The minds of many of us are like menageries  of wild animals, each pursuing the bent of its own nature, and going its  own way. We have the whole menagerie within us--the tiger, the ape, the  peacock, the ass, the goose, the sheep the hyena, and all the rest. And  we have been letting these animals rule us. Even our Intellect is  erratic, unstable, and like the quicksilver to which the ancient  occultists compared it, shifting and uncertain. If you will look around  you you will see that those men and women in the world who have really  accomplished anything worth while have trained their minds to obedience.  They have asserted the Will over their own minds, and learned Mastery and  Power in that way. The average mind chafes at the restraint of the Will,  and is like a frisky monkey that will not be \"taught tricks.\" But taught  it must be, if it wants to do good work. And teach it you must if you  expect to get any use from it--if you expect to use it, instead of having  it use you.    And this is the first thing to be learned in _Raja Yoga_--this control of  the mind. Those who had hoped for some royal road to mastery, may be  disappointed, but there is only one way and that is to master and control  the mind by the Will. Otherwise it will run away when you most need it.  And so we shall give you some exercise designed to aid you in this  direction.    The first exercise in _Raja Yoga_ Is what is called _Pratyahara_ or the  art of making the mind introspective or turned inward upon itself. It is  the first step toward mental control. It aims to turn the mind from  going outward, and gradually turning it inward upon itself or inner  nature. The object is to gain control of it by the Will. The following  exercises will aid in that direction:      EXERCISE I.    (a) Place yourself in a comfortable position, and so far as possible free  from outside disturbing influences. Make no violent effort to control  the mind, but rather allow it to run along for a while and exhaust its  efforts. It will take advantage of the opportunity, and will jump around  like an unchained monkey at first, until it gradually slows down and  looks to you for orders. It "]]]
