This is a nearly allied species to our  native G. tinctoria, and is of dwarf growth with a rich abundance of  golden yellow flowers that are produced towards the end of summer.    G. CINEREA (_syn G. ramosissima_), from South Europe, is a very  beautiful and desirable species, a yard high, and bearing in July  slender twigs of the brightest yellow flowers.    G. EPHEDROIDES.--Corsica and Sardinia, 1832. With small and  abundantly-produced flowers, this resembles Ephedra, hence its name.    G. GERMANICA.--Germany, 1773. This is a handsome rock garden shrub, of  fully 18 inches in height, with arching stems and a plentiful supply of  bright flowers during the summer and autumn months.    G. HISPANICA.--South-western Europe, 1759. This species resembles our  common Broom, but the branches are not angular. The large, yellow,  fragrant flowers appear in July. There is a charming double-flowered  variety named G. hispanica flore-pleno.    G. LUSITANICA.--Portugal, 1771. This is remarkable for its opposite  branches, is of spiny growth, and one of the earliest to appear in  flower.    G. MONOSPERMA.--South Europe, 1690. This has white flowers, and is of  value as a seaside shrub, and grows well in almost pure sand. A native  of the Mediterranean coast.    G. PILOSA.--Greenweed. Europe (Britain). This is a dense prostrate  native species, with bright yellow blossoms produced freely during May  and June. A delightful rock shrub, and one that will succeed well almost  in pure gravel.    G. PROSTRATA.--Burgundy and Alps of Jura, 1775. A small-growing species  suitable for rock gardening, and of spreading bushy growth. Flowers  small, but ornamental, and produced in May and June.    G. RADIATA (_syn Spartium radiatum_).--South Europe, 1758. This is a  slender-growing shrub, about 18 inches high, with narrow leaflets, and  terminal heads of yellow flowers produced in summer.    G. SAGITTALIS.--South Europe, 1750. With its peculiarly winged and  jointed stems, which are of a deep green colour, this is one of the most  distinct forms. The flowers are few but pretty, and with the dwarf habit  render the plant an excellent subject for rockwork.    G. TINCTORIA.--Dyers' Greenweed. Europe (Britain), North and West Asia.  This is a spineless species, and bears a profusion of yellow flowers  from July onwards. The double-flowering variety, G. tinctoria  flore-pleno, is, in so far as ornamental qualities are concerned,  superior to the parent form.    G. TINCTORIA ELATIOR (_syn G. elatior_) grows to 12 feet in height, is  of free, spreading growth, and a very handsome plant. The flowers, which  are individually small and yellow, are so thickly produced that the  shrub, in late summer, has the appearance of a sheet of gold.    G. TRIANGULARIS (_syn G. triquetra_).--South Europe, 1815. This is a  decidedly good garden plant, and of neat, trailing habit. The stems are  three sided, and the flowers golden yellow and plentifully produced. A  native of South Europe, and perfectly hardy in almost any position.    The above include most of the hardy Genistas, though G. capitata and G.  daurica, both very ornamental kinds, might be added to the list. They  are all very hardy, free-flowering shrubs, of simple culture, and  succeeding well in any light and rather dry soil.      GLEDITSCHIA.    GLEDITSCHIA TRIACANTHOS.--Honey Locust. United States, 1700. As an  ornamental hardy tree this is well worthy the attention of planters, the  pinnate and bipinnate foliage being particularly elegant, while the  flowers, though individually small, are borne in such quantities of  fascicled racemes as to attract notice. The stem and branches are armed  with formidable prickles, but there is a form in which the prickles are  absent. A native of North America, and readily cultivated in any soil of  even fair quality. For town planting it is a valuable tree. There is a  good weeping variety named G. triacanthos pendula.    G. SINENSIS (_syn G. horrida_).--China, 1774. This nearly resembles the  latter, and is occasionally to be met with in cultivation in this  country.      GORDONIA.    GORDONIA LASIANTHUS.--Loblolly Bay. North America, 1739. A shrub of  great beauty, but one that, unfortunately, is rarely to be seen outside  the walls of a botanic garden. It is of Camellia-like growth, with  large, sweetly fragrant flowers and a good habit of growth.    G. PUBESCENS.--North America, 1774. This is of smaller growth than the  latter, rarely exceeding about 6 feet high, with large white flowers  that are rendered all the more conspicuous by the tuft of golden  stamens. Both species are somewhat tender, although hailing from the  coast, swampy grounds of the southern States of North America. Planted  in favoured sites, they usually grow freely in light, peaty soil, or  that containing a large admixture of decayed leaf soil.      GRABOWSKIA.    GRABOWSKIA BOERHAAVIAEFOLIA.--Peru, 1780. This is occasionally to be  seen in sheltered and favoured gardens, but it is not to be relied upon  in other than southern and seaside districts. The plant is of no  particular interest to the cultivator, the outline being ungainly, while  the pale blue flowers are both dull and uninteresting. It belongs to the  Solanum family, and is only worth cultivating as a curiosity. Light,  warm soil and a sunny position are necessities in the cultivation of  this shrub.      GRISELINIA.    GRISELINIA LITTORALIS.--New Zealand, 1872. This forms a compact bush of  moderate size, and is fairly hardy. The leaves are of a light, pleasing  green shade, coriaceous, and glossy, and remain on the plant during  winter. It is an excellent shrub for the seaside, and, moreover, will  succeed well in stiff soils where many other plants would refuse to  grow.      GYMNOCLADUS.    GYMNOCLADUS CANADENSIS.--Kentucky Coffee Tree. Canada, 1748. When in  full leafage this is a distinct and beautiful tree, the foliage hanging  in well-rounded masses, and presenting a pretty effect by reason of the  loose and tufted appearance of the masses of finely-divided leaves.  Leaves often 3 feet long, bipinnate, and composed of numerous  bluish-green leaflets. Flowers white, borne in loose spikes in the  beginning of summer, and succeeded by flat, somewhat curved brown pods.  It prefers a rich, strong soil or alluvial deposit.    G. CHINENSIS.--Soap Tree. China, 1889. Readily distinguished from the  American species by its much smaller and more numerous leaflets, and  thicker fruit pod. It is not very hardy in this country unless in the  milder sea-side districts. The leaves are used by the Chinese women to  wash their hair, hence the popular name of Soap Tree.      HALESIA.    HALESIA DIPTERA (_syn H. reticulata_).--North America, 1758. This is not  so suitable for our climate as H. tetraptera, though in southern parts  of the country it forms a neat, healthy bush, and flowers freely. It is  distinguished, as the name indicates, by having two wings to the seed  vessel, H. tetraptera having four.    H. HISPIDA (_syn Pterostyrax hispidum_).--Japan, 1875. This is a shrub  of perfect hardihood, free growth, and very floriferous. The flowers,  which are pure white, and in long racemes, resemble much those of the  Snowdrop Tree. Leaves broad and slightly dentated. It is a handsome  shrub, of free growth, in light, sandy loam, and quite hardy even when  fully exposed.    H. PARVIFLORA has smaller flowers than those of our commonly-cultivated  plant.    H. TETRAPTERA.--Snowdrop Tree. North America, 1756. This is a very  ornamental tall-growing shrub, of somewhat loose growth, and bearing  flowers which resemble, both in size and appearance, those of our common  Snowdrop. It is one of the most ornamental of all the small-growing  American trees, and richly deserves a place in every collection, on  account of the profusion with which the flowers are produced in April  and May. They are snow-white, drooping, and produced in lateral  fascicles of eight or ten together. It is a native of river banks in  North Carolina, and is well suited for cultivation in this country.  Light, peaty soil will grow it to perfection.      HALIMODENDRON.    HALIMODENDRON ARGENTEUM (_syn Robinia Halimodendron_).--Salt tree. A  native of Asiatic Russia (1779), having silvery foliage, and pink or  purplish-pink flowers, axillary or fascicled. It is a neat and pretty  shrub, that is rendered valuable as succeeding well in maritime  districts. Quite hardy and of free growth in sandy soil.      HAMAMELIS.    HAMAMELIS JAPONICA.--The Japanese Witch Hazel. Japan, 1862. This is a  small species with lemon-yellow flowers. H. japonica arborea is a taller  growing variety, with primrose-yellow petals, and a deep claret calyx.  The flowers are borne in clusters in early spring. Rarely in this  country do we find this species of greater height than about 8 feet, but  it is of bushy growth, though somewhat straggling in appearance. As  early as the beginning of January this Witch Hazel may be found in  bloom, the bare branches being studded here and there with the  curious-shaped flowers, these having bright yellow, twisted petals and  reddish calyces. H.j. Zuccarinianais a very desirable free-flowering  variety, with pale yellow petals and a greenish-brown calyx.    H. VIRGINICA.--Virginian Witch Hazel. North America, 1736. This has  smaller flowers than H.j. arborea, and they are plentifully produced in  autumn or early winter. In this country it assumes the shape of an open  bush of about 6 feet in height, but is usually of untidy appearance from  the branches being irregularly disposed.    They all delight in cool, rather moist soil, and are of value for their  early-flowering nature.      HEDYSARUM.    HEDYSARUM MULTIJUGUM.--South Mongolia. Hardly ten years have elapsed  since this pretty shrub was introduced into England, so that at present  it is rather rare in our gardens. It is a decided acquisition, if only  for the production of flowers at a time"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/10885"],[0,"Stories from the Italian Poets: with Lives of the Writers, Volume 1 (#13)"],[1,"gs. The crater he finds to be the abode of those who  have done neither good nor evil, caring for nothing but themselves.  In the first circle are the whole unbaptised world--heathens and  infants--melancholy, though not tormented. Here also is found the  Elysium of Virgil, whose Charon and other infernal beings are among the  agents of torment. In the second circle the torments commence with the  sin of incontinence; and the punishment goes deepening with the crime  from circle to circle, through gluttony, avarice, prodigality, wrath,  sullenness, or unwillingness to be pleased with the creation, disbelief  in God and the soul (with which the punishment by fire commences),  usury, murder, suicide, blasphemy, seduction and other carnal  enormities, adulation, simony, soothsaying, astrology, witchcraft,  trafficking with the public interest, hypocrisy, highway robbery (on  the great Italian scale), sacrilege, evil counsel, disturbance of the  Church, heresy, false apostleship, alchemy, forgery, coining (all these,  from seduction downwards, in one circle); then, in the frozen or lowest  circle of all, treachery; and at the bottom of this is Satan, stuck into  the centre of the earth.    With the centre of the globe commences the antipodean attraction of its  opposite side, together with a rocky ascent out of it, through a  huge ravine. The poet and his guide, on their arrival at this spot,  accordingly find their position reversed; and so conclude their  _downward_ journey _upwards_, till they issue forth to light on the  borders of the sea which contains the island of Purgatory.      THE JOURNEY THROUGH HELL.    Dante says, that when he was half-way on his pilgrimage through this  life, he one day found himself, towards nightfall, in a wood where he  could no longer discern the right path. It was a place so gloomy and  terrible, every thing in it growing in such a strange and savage manner,  that the horror he felt returned on him whenever he thought of it. The  pass of death could hardly be more bitter. Travelling through it all  night with a beating heart, he at length came to the foot of a hill, and  looking up, as he began to ascend it, he perceived the shoulders of the  hill clad in the beams of morning; a sight which gave him some little  comfort. He felt like a man who has buffeted his way to land out of a  shipwreck, and who, though still anxious to get farther from his peril,  cannot help turning round to gaze on the wide waters. So did he stand  looking back on the pass that contained that dreadful wood. After  resting a while, he again betook him up the hill; but had not gone far  when he beheld a leopard bounding in front of him, and hindering his  progress. After the leopard came a lion, with his head aloft, mad with  hunger, and seeming to frighten the very air;[1] and after the lion,  more eager still, a she-wolf, so lean that she appeared to be sharpened  with every wolfish want. The pilgrim fled back in terror to the wood,  where he again found himself in a darkness to which the light never  penetrated. In that place, he said, the sun never spoke word.[2] But the  wolf was still close upon him.[3]    While thus flying, he beheld coming towards him a man, who spoke  something, but he knew not what. The voice sounded strange and feeble,  as if from disuse. Dante loudly called out to him to save him, whether  he was a man or only a spirit. The apparition, at whose sight the wild  beasts disappeared, said that he was no longer man, though man he  had been in the time of the false gods, and sung the history of the  offspring of Anchises.    \"And art thou, then, that Virgil,\" said Dante, \"who has filled the world  with such floods of eloquence? O glory and light of all poets, thou art  my master, and thou mine _author_; thou alone the book from which I have  gathered beauties that have gained me praise. Behold the peril I am in,  and help me, for I tremble in every vein and pulse.\"    Virgil comforted Dante. He told him that he must quit the wood by  another road, and that he himself would be his guide, leading him first  to behold the regions of woe underground, and then the spirits that  lived content in fire because it purified them for heaven; and then that  he would consign him to other hands worthier than his own, which should  raise him to behold heaven itself; for as the Pagans, of whom he was  one, had been rebels to the law of him that reigns there, nobody could  arrive at Paradise by their means.[4]    So saying, Virgil moved on his way, and Dante closely followed. He  expressed a fear, however, as they went, lest being \"neither AEneas nor  St. Paul,\" his journey could not be worthily undertaken, nor end in  wisdom. But Virgil, after sharply rebuking him for his faintheartedness,  told him, that the spirit of her whom he loved, Beatrice, had come down  from heaven on purpose to commend her lover to his care; upon which the  drooping courage of the pilgrim was raised to an undaunted confidence;  as flowers that have been closed and bowed down by frosty nights, rise  all up on their stems in the morning sun.[5]     \"Non vuol che 'n sua citta per me si vegna.\"    The Pagans could not be rebels to a law they never heard of, any  more than Dante could be a rebel to Luther. But this is one of the  absurdities with which the impious effrontery or scarcely less  impious admissions of Dante's teachers avowedly set reason at  defiance,--retaining, meanwhile, their right of contempt for the  impieties of Mahometans and Brahmins; \"which is odd,\" as the poet says;  for being not less absurd, or, as the others argued, much more so, they  had at least an equal claim on the submission of the reason; since the  greater the irrationality, the higher the theological triumph.      \"Through me is the road to the dolorous city;    Through me is the road to the everlasting sorrows;    Through me is the road to the lost people.    Justice was the motive of my exalted maker;    I was made by divine power, by consummate wisdom, and by primal love;    Before me was no created thing, if not eternal; and eternal am I also.    Abandon hope, all ye who enter.\"    Such were the words which Dante beheld written in dark characters over a  portal. \"Master,\" said he to Virgil, \"I find their meaning hard.\"    \"A man,\" answered Virgil, \"must conduct himself at this door like one  prepared. Hither must he bring no mistrust. Hither can come and live no  cowardice. We have arrived at the place I told thee of. Here thou art to  behold the dolorous people who have lost all intellectual good.\" [6]    So saying, Virgil placed his hand on Dante's, looking on him with a  cheerful countenance; and the Florentine passed with him through the  dreadful gate.    They entered upon a sightless gulf, in which was a black air without  stars; and immediately heard a hubbub of groans; and wailings, and  terrible things said in many languages, words of wretchedness, outcries  of rage, voices loud and hoarse, and sounds of the smitings of hands one  against another. Dante began to weep. The sound was as if the sand in  a whirlwind were turned into noises, and filled the blind air with  incessant conflict.    Yet these were not the souls of the wicked. They were those only who had  lived without praise or blame, thinking of nothing but themselves. These  miserable creatures were mixed with the angels who stood neutral in the  war with Satan. Heaven would not dull its brightness with those angels,  nor would lower hell receive them, lest the bad ones should triumph in  their company.    \"And what is it,\" said Dante, \"which makes them so grievously suffer?\"    \"Hopelessness of death,\" said Virgil. \"Their blind existence here, and  immemorable former life, make them so wretched, that they envy every  other lot. Mercy and justice alike disdain them. Let us speak of them no  more. Look, and pass.\"    The companions went on till they came to a great river with a multitude  waiting on the banks. A hoary old man appeared crossing the river  towards them in a boat; and as he came, he said, \"Woe to the wicked.  Never expect to see heaven. I come to bear you across to the dark  regions of everlasting fire and ice.\" Then looking at Dante, he said,  \"Get thee away from the dead, thou who standest there, live spirit.\"    \"Torment thyself not, Charon,\" said Virgil. \"He has a passport beyond  thy power to question.\"    The shaggy cheeks of the boatman of the livid lake, who had wheels of  fire about his eyes, fell at these words; and he was silent. But the  naked multitude of souls whom he had spoken to changed colour, and  gnashed their teeth, blaspheming God, and their parents, and the human  species, and the place, and the hour, and the seed of the sowing of  their birth; and all the while they felt themselves driven onwards, by a  fear which became a desire, towards the cruel river-side, which awaits  every one destitute of the fear of God. The demon Charon, beckoning to  them with eyes like brasiers, collected them as they came, giving blows  to those that lingered, with his oar. One by one they dropped into the  boat like leaves from a bough in autumn, till the bough is left bare; or  as birds drop into the decoy at the sound of the bird-call.    There was then an earthquake, so terrible that the recollection of it  made the poet burst into a sweat at every pore. A whirlwind issued from  the lamenting ground, attended by vermilion flashes; and he lost his  senses, and fell like a man stupefied.    A crash of thunder through his brain woke up the pilgrim so hastily,  that he shook himself like a person roused by force. He found that he  was on the brink of a gulf, from which ascended a thunderous sound of  innumerable groanings. He could see nothing down it. It was too dark  with sooty clouds. Virgil himself turned pale, but said, \"We are to go  down here. I will lead the way.\"    \"O master,\" said Dante, \"if even thou fearest, what is to become of  myself?\" "]]]
