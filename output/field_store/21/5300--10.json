There is a population of over  150,000, and there are two steam railroads between Callao and Lima,  while there is one running into the interior for 130 miles, crossing  the Andes at an elevation of over three miles. It is a branch of that  road, together with a branch of the one running to Ancon, that I am to  connect with a tunnel.\"    Tom found some beautiful churches and cathedrals in Lima, and spent  some time visiting them. He and Mr. Damon also visited, in the  outskirts, the tobacco, cocoa and other factories.    Three days after reaching the capital, Mr. Titus having attended to  some necessary business while Mr. Damon set on foot matters connected  with his affairs, it was decided to strike inland to Rimac, and to try  the effect of Tom Swift's explosive on the tunnel.    The journey was to be made in part by rail, though the last stages of  it were over a rough mountain trail, with llamas for beasts of burden,  while our friends rode mules.    As Tom, Mr. Damon, Koku, and Mr. Titus were going to the railroad  station they saw Professor Bumper also leaving the hotel.    \"I believe our roads lie together for a time,\" said the bald-headed  scientist, \"and, if you have no objections, I will accompany you.\"    \"Come, and welcome!\" exclaimed Mr. Titus, all his suspicions now gone.    \"And it may be that you will be able to help me,\" the scientist went on.    \"Help you--how?\" asked Tom.    \"I will tell you when we reach the Andes,\" was the mysterious answer.    It was a day later when they left the train at a small station, and  struck off into the foothills of the great Andes Mountains, where the  tunnel was started, that the professor again mentioned his object.    \"Friends,\" he said, as he gazed up at the towering cliffs and crags, \"I  am searching for the lost city of Pelone, located somewhere in these  mountains. Will you help me to find it?\"          Chapter XII    The Tunnel      Mr. Damon, of the three who heard Professor Bumper make this statement,  showed the least sign of astonishment. It would have been more correct  to say that he showed none at all. But Tom could not restrain himself.    \"The lost city of Pelone!\" he exclaimed.    \"Is it here--in these mountains?\" asked Mr. Titus.    \"I have reason to hope that it is,\" went on the professor.  \"The golden  tablets are very vague, but I have tried many locations, and now I am  about to try here. I hope I shall succeed. At any rate, I shall have  agreeable company, which has not always been my luck on my previous  expeditions seeking to find the lost city.\"    \"Oh, Professor, are you still on that quest?\" asked Mr. Damon, in a  matter-of-fact tone.    \"Yes, Mr. Damon, I am. And now that I look about me, and see the shape  of these mountains, I feel that they conform more to the description on  the golden plates than any location I have yet tried. Somehow I feel  that I shall be successful here.\"    \"Did you know Professor Bumper was searching for a lost city of the  Andes?\" asked Tom, of his eccentric friend.    \"Why yes,\" answered Mr. Damon. \"He has been searching for years to  locate it.\"    \"Why didn't you tell us?\" inquired Mr. Titus.    \"Why, I never thought of it. Bless my memorandum book! it never  occurred to me. I did not think you would be interested.  Tell them  your story, Professor Bumper.\"    \"I will soon. Just now I must see to my equipment. The story will keep.\"    And though Tom and Mr. Titus were both anxious to hear about the lost  city, they, too, had much to do to get ready for the trip into the  interior.    The beginning of the tunnel under one of the smaller of the ranges of  the Andes lay two days journey from the end of the railroad line. And  the trip must be made on mules, with llamas as beasts of burden,  transporting the powder and other supplies.    \"We'll only need to take enough food with us for the two days,\" said  Mr. Titus. \"We have a regular camp at the tunnel mouth, and my brother  has supplies of grub and other things constantly coming in. We also  have shacks to live in; but on this trip we will use tents, as the  weather at this season is fine.\"    It was quite a little expedition that set off up the mountain trail  that afternoon, for they had arrived at the end of the railroad line  shortly before dinner, and had eaten at a rather poor restaurant.    Professor Bumper had made up his own exploring party, consisting of  himself and three native Indian diggers with their picks and shovels.  They were to do whatever excavating he decided was necessary to locate  the hidden city.    Several mules and llamas, laden with the new explosive, and burdened  with camp equipment and food, and a few Indian servants made up the  cavalcade of Tom, the contractor, Mr. Damon and Koku. The giant was  almost as much a source of wonder to the Peruvians as he had been on  board the ship.  And he was a great help, too. For some of the Indians  were under-sized, and could not lift the heavy boxes and packages to  the backs of the beasts of burden.    But Koku, thrusting the little men aside, grasped with one hand what  two of them had tried in vain to lift, and set it on the back of mule  or llama.    The way was rough but they took their time to it, for the trail was an  ascending one. Above and beyond them towered the great Andes, and Tom,  gazing up into the sky, which in places seemed almost pierced by the  snow-covered peaks, saw some small black specks moving about.    \"Condors,\" said Mr. Titus, when his attention was called to them. \"Some  of them are powerful birds, and they sometimes pick up a sheep and make  off with it, though usually their food consists of carrion.\"    They went into camp before the sun went down, for it grew dark soon  after sunset, and they wanted to be prepared.  Supper was made ready by  the Indian helpers, and when this was over, and they sat about a camp  fire, Tom said:    \"Now, Professor Bumper, perhaps you'll explain about the lost city.\"    \"I wish I could explain about it,\" began the scientist.  \"For years I  have dreamed of finding it, but always I have been disappointed. Now,  perhaps, my luck may change.\"    \"Do you think it may be near here?\" asked Mr. Titus, motioning toward  the dark and frowning peaks all about them.    \"It may be. The signs are most encouraging. In brief, the story of the  lost city of Pelone is this. Thousands of years ago--in fact I do not  know how many--there existed somewhere in Peru an ancient city that was  the centre of civilization for this region. Older it was than the  civilization of the Mexicans--the Montezumas--older and more cultured.    \"It is many years since I became interested in Peruvian antiquities,  and then I had no idea of the lost city. But some of the antiques I  picked up contained in their inscriptions references to Pelone. At  first I conceived this to be a sort of god, a deity, or perhaps a  powerful ruler.  But as I went on in my work of gathering ancient  things from Peru, I saw that the name Pelone referred to a city--a seat  of government, whence everything had its origin.    \"Then I got on the track more closely. I examined ancient documents. I  found traces of an ancient language and writings, different from  anything else in the world. I managed to construct an alphabet and to  read some of the documents. From them I learned that Pelone was a city  situated in some fertile valley of the Andes. It had existed for  thousands of years; it was the seat of learning and culture. Much light  would be thrown on the lives of the people who lived in Peru before the  present races inhabited it, if I could but locate Pelone.    \"Then I came across two golden tablets on which were graven the  information that Pelone had utterly vanished.\"    \"How?\" asked Tom.    \"The golden tablets did not say. They simply stated the fact that  Pelone was lost, and one sentence read: 'He who shall find it again  shall be richly rewarded.' But it is not for that that I seek. It is  that I may give to the world the treasures it must contain--the  treasures of an ancient civilization.\"    \"And how do you think the city disappeared?\" asked Mr. Titus.    \"I do not know. Whether it was destroyed by enemies, whether it was  buried under the ashes of a volcano, whether it still exists, deserted  and solitary in some valley amid the mountain fastnesses of the Andes,  I do not know. But I am certain the city once existed, and it may exist  yet, though it may be in dust-covered ruins. That is what I seek to  find. See! Here are the tablets telling about it. I got them from an  old Peruvian grave.\"    He took from a box two thin sheets of yellow metal. They were covered  with curious marks, but Tom and the others could make nothing of them.  Only Professor Bumper was able to decipher them.    \"And that is the story of the lost city of Pelone--as much as I know,\"  he said. \"For years I have sought it. If I can find it I shall be  famous, for I shall have added to human knowledge.\"    \"If the people of that city wrote on golden tablets, the yellow metal  must have been plentiful,\" commented Mr. Titus.  \"You might strike a  rich mine.\"    \"I have no use for riches,\" said the professor.    \"Well, I have,\" the contractor said, with a laugh. \"That's why I'm  putting through this tunnel. And if my brother and I don't do it we'll  be in a bad way financially. We have struck traces of gold, but not in  paying quantities. I should like to see this lost city of yours,  Professor Bumper. It may contain gold.\"    \"You may have all the gold, if I am allowed to "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/954"],[0,"Tom Swift and His War Tank; Or, Doing His Bit for Uncle Sam (#12)"],[1," he could  in a hurry.\"    \"But he didn't count on Ned's being here!\" chuckled Mr. Damon.    \"No; that's where he slipped a cog,\" remarked Mr. Nestor.  \"Well, Tom,  I like your tank, what I've seen of her, but it's getting late and I  think Mary and I had better be getting back home.\"    \"We'll be ready to start in a little while,\" Tom said, after a brief  consultation with one of his men. \"Still, perhaps it would be just as  well if you didn't ride back with me. She may go all right, and then,  again, she may not.  And as it's dark, and we're in a rough part of the  field, you might be a bit shaken up. Not that the tank minds it!\" the  young inventor hastened to add \"She's got to do her bit over worse  places than this--much worse--but I want to get her in a little better  working shape first. So if you don't mind, Mary, I'll postpone your  initial trip.\"    \"Oh, I don't mind, Tom! I'm so glad you've made this! I want to see the  war ended, and I think machines like this will help.\"    \"I'll ride back with you, Tom, if you don't mind,\" put in Ned. \"I guess  a little shaking up won't hurt me.\"    \"All right--stick. We're going to start very soon.\"    \"Well, I'm coming over to-morrow to have a look at it by daylight,\"  said Mr. Damon, as he started toward his car.    \"So am I,\" added Mary. \"Please call for me, Mr. Damon.\"    \"I will,\" he promised.    Mr. Nestor, his daughter, and Mr. Damon went back to the automobile,  while Ned remained with Tom. In a little while those in the car heard  once more the rumbling and roaring sound and felt the earth tremble.  Then, with a flashing of lights, the big, ungainly shape of the tank  lifted herself out of the little ditch in which she had come to a halt,  and began to climb back to the road.    Ned Newton stood beside Tom in the control tower of the great tank as  she started on her homeward way.    \"Isn't it wonderful!\" murmured Mary, as she saw Tank A lumbering along  toward the road. \"Oh, and to think that human beings made that. To think  that Tom should know how to build such a wonderful machine!\"    \"And run it, too, Mary!  That's the point! Make it run!\" cried her  father. \"I tell you, that Tom Swift is a wonder!\"    \"Bless my dictionary, he sure is!\" agreed Mr. Damon.    Along the road, back toward the shop whence it had emerged, rumbled the  tank. The noise brought to their doors inhabitants along the country  thoroughfare, and some of them were frightened when they saw Tom  Swift's latest war machine, the details of which they could only guess  at in the darkness.    \"She'll butt over a house if it gets in her path, knock down trees,  chew up barbed-wire, and climb down into ravines and out again, and go  over a good-sized stream without a whimper,\" said Tom, as he steered  the great machine.    There was little chance then for Ned to see much of the inside  mechanism of the tank. He observed that Tom, standing in the forward  tower, steered it very easily by a small wheel or by a lever,  alternately, and that he communicated with the engine room by means of  electric signals.    \"And she steers by electricity, too,\" Tom told his friend.  \"That was  one difficulty with the first tanks. They had to be steered by brute  force, so to speak, and it was a terrific strain on the man in the  tower. Now I can guide this in two ways: by the electric mechanism  which swings the trailer wheels to either side, or by varying the speed  of the two motors that work the caterpillar belts. So if one breaks  down, I have the other.\"    \"Got any guns aboard her--I mean machine guns?\" asked Ned.    \"Not yet.  But I'm going to install some. I wanted to get the tank in  proper working order first. The guns are only incidental, though of  course they're vitally necessary when she goes into action. I've got  'em all ready to put in. But first I'm going to try the grippers.\"    \"Oh, you mean the gap-bridgers?\" asked Ned.    \"That's it,\" answered Tom. \"Look out, we're going over a rough spot  now.\"    And they did. Ned was greatly shaken up, and fairly tossed from side to  side of the steering tower. For the tank contained no springs, except  such as were installed around the most delicate machinery, and it was  like riding in a dump cart over a very rough road.    \"However, that's part of the game,\" Tom observed.    Tank A reached her \"harbor\" safely--in other words, the machine shop  enclosed by the high fence, inside of which she had been built.    Tom and Ned made some inquiries of Koku and Eradicate as to whether or  not there had been any unusual sights or sounds about the place. They  feared Simpson might have come to the shop to try to get possession of  important drawings or data.    But all had been quiet, Koku reported. Nor had Eradicate seen or heard  anything out of the ordinary.    \"Then I guess we'll lock up and turn in,\" decided Tom.  \"Come over  to-morrow, Ned.\"    \"I will,\" promised the young bank clerk. \"I want to see more of what  makes the wheels go round.\"  And he laughed at his own ingenuousness.    The next day Tom showed his friends as much as they cared to see about  the workings of the tank. They inspected the powerful gasolene engines,  saw how they worked the endless belts made of plates of jointed steel,  which, running over sprocket wheels, really gave the tank its power by  providing great tractive force.    Any self-propelled vehicle depends for its power, either to move itself  or to push or to pull, on its tractive force--that is, the grip it can  get on the ground.    In the case of a bicycle little tractive power is needed, and this is  provided by the rubber tires, which grip the ground. A locomotive  depends for its tractive power on its weight pressing on its driving  wheels, and the more driving wheels there are and the heavier the  locomotive, the more it can pull, though in that case speed is lost.  This is why freight locomotives are so heavy and have so many large  driving wheels. They pull the engine along, and the cars also, by their  weight pressing on the rails.    The endless steel belts of a tank are, the same as the wheels of a  locomotive. And the belts, being very broad, which gives them a large  surface with which to press on the ground, and the tank being very  heavy, great power to advance is thus obtained, though at the sacrifice  of speed.  However, Tom Swift had made his tank so that it would do  about ten miles and more an hour, nearly double the progress obtained  up to that time by the British machines.    His visitors saw the great motors, they inspected the compact but not  very attractive living quarters of the crew, for provision had to be  made for the men to stay in the tank if, perchance, it became stalled  in No Man's Land, surrounded by the enemy.    The tank was powerfully armored and would be armed. There were a number  of machine guns to be installed, quick-firers of various types, and in  addition the tank could carry a number of riflemen.    It was upon the crushing power of the tank, though, that most reliance  was placed. Thus it could lead the way for an infantry advance through  the enemy's lines, making nothing of barbed wire that would take an  artillery fire of several days to cut to pieces.    \"And now, Ned,\" said Tom, about a week after the night test of the  tank, \"I'm going to try what she'll do in bridging a gap.\"    \"Have you got her in shape again?\"    \"Yes, everything is all right. I've taken out the weak part in the  steering gear that nearly caused us to run you down, and we're safe in  that respect now. And I've got the grippers made. It only remains to  see whether they're strong enough to bear the weight of my little  baby,\" and Tom affectionately patted the steel sides of Tank A.    While his men were getting the machine ready for a test out on the  road, and for a journey across a small stream not far away, Tom told  his chum about conceiving the idea for the tank and carrying it out  secretly with the aid of his father and certain workmen.    \"That's the reason the government exempted me from enlisting,\" Tom  said. \"They wanted me to finish this tank. I didn't exactly want to,  but I considered it my 'bit.' After this I'm going into the army, Ned.\"    \"Glad to hear it, old man. Maybe by that time I'll have this Liberty  Bond work finished, and I'll go with you. We'll have great times  together! Have you heard anything more of Simpson, Blakeson and  Scoundrels?\" And Ned laughed as he named this \"firm.\"    \"No,\" answered Tom. \"I guess we scared off that slick German spy.\"    Once more the tank lumbered out along the road. It was a mighty engine  of war, and inside her rode Tom and Ned. Mary and her father had been  invited, but the girl could not quite get her courage to the point of  accepting, nor did Mr. Nestor care to go. Mr. Damon, however, as might  be guessed, was there.    \"Bless my monkey wrench, Tom!\" cried the eccentric man, as he noted  their advance over some rough ground, \"are you really going to make  this machine cross Tinkle Creek on a bridge of steel you carry with  you?\"    \"I'm going to try, Mr. Damon.\"    A little later, after a successful test up and down a small gully, Tank  A arrived at the edge of Tinkle Creek, a small stream about twenty feet  wide, not far from Tom's home. At the point selected for the test the  banks were high and steep.    \"If she bridges that gap she'll do anything,\" murmured Ned, as the tank  came to a stop on the edge.          Chapter XIII    Into a Trench      Tom cast a hasty glance over the mechanism of the machine before he  started to cross the stream by the additional aid of the grippers, or  spanners, as he sometimes called this latest device.    Along each side, in a row of sockets, were two long girders of steel,  latticed like the main supports of a bridge. They were of peculiar  triangular construction, designed to support heavy weights, and each  end was broadly flanged to prevent its sinking too deeply into the  earth on"]]]
