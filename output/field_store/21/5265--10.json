Keep it in the family, kind of, don't you  know. Besides, it would be a boon to the kid.\"    A jolly bright idea it seemed to me. Edwin was her young brother, who  was spending his holidays at Easeby. He was a ferret-faced kid, whom I  had disliked since birth. As a matter of fact, talking of  Recollections and Memories, it was young blighted Edwin who, nine  years before, had led his father to where I was smoking his cigar and  caused all of the unpleasantness. He was fourteen now and had just  joined the Boy Scouts. He was one of those thorough kids, and took his  responsibilities pretty seriously. He was always in a sort of fever  because he was dropping behind schedule with his daily acts of  kindness. However hard he tried, he'd fall behind; and then you would  find him prowling about the house, setting such a clip to try and  catch up with himself that Easeby was rapidly becoming a perfect hell  for man and beast.    The idea didn't seem to strike Florence.    \"I shall do nothing of the kind, Bertie. I wonder you can't appreciate  the compliment I am paying you--trusting you like this.\"    \"Oh, I see that all right, but what I mean is, Edwin would do it so  much better than I would. These Boy Scouts are up to all sorts of  dodges. They spoor, don't you know, and take cover and creep about,  and what not.\"    \"Bertie, will you or will you not do this perfectly trivial thing for  me? If not, say so now, and let us end this farce of pretending that  you care a snap of the fingers for me.\"    \"Dear old soul, I love you devotedly!\"    \"Then will you or will you not----\"    \"Oh, all right,\" I said. \"All right! All right! All right!\"    And then I tottered forth to think it over. I met Jeeves in the  passage just outside.    \"I beg your pardon, sir. I was endeavouring to find you.\"    \"What's the matter?\"    \"I felt that I should tell you, sir, that somebody has been putting  black polish on our brown walking shoes.\"    \"What! Who? Why?\"    \"I could not say, sir.\"    \"Can anything be done with them?\"    \"Nothing, sir.\"    \"Damn!\"    \"Very good, sir.\"           *       *       *       *       *    I've often wondered since then how these murderer fellows manage to  keep in shape while they're contemplating their next effort. I had a  much simpler sort of job on hand, and the thought of it rattled me to  such an extent in the night watches that I was a perfect wreck next  day. Dark circles under the eyes--I give you my word! I had to call on  Jeeves to rally round with one of those life-savers of his.    From breakfast on I felt like a bag-snatcher at a railway station. I  had to hang about waiting for the parcel to be put on the hall table,  and it wasn't put. Uncle Willoughby was a fixture in the library,  adding the finishing touches to the great work, I supposed, and the  more I thought the thing over the less I liked it. The chances against  my pulling it off seemed about three to two, and the thought of what  would happen if I didn't gave me cold shivers down the spine. Uncle  Willoughby was a pretty mild sort of old boy, as a rule, but I've  known him to cut up rough, and, by Jove, he was scheduled to extend  himself if he caught me trying to get away with his life work.    It wasn't till nearly four that he toddled out of the library with the  parcel under his arm, put it on the table, and toddled off again. I  was hiding a bit to the south-east at the moment, behind a suit of  armour. I bounded out and legged it for the table. Then I nipped  upstairs to hide the swag. I charged in like a mustang and nearly  stubbed my toe on young blighted Edwin, the Boy Scout. He was standing  at the chest of drawers, confound him, messing about with my ties.    \"Hallo!\" he said.    \"What are you doing here?\"    \"I'm tidying your room. It's my last Saturday's act of kindness.\"    \"Last Saturday's?\"    \"I'm five days behind. I was six till last night, but I polished your  shoes.\"    \"Was it you----\"    \"Yes. Did you see them? I just happened to think of it. I was in here,  looking round. Mr. Berkeley had this room while you were away. He left  this morning. I thought perhaps he might have left something in it  that I could have sent on. I've often done acts of kindness that way.\"    \"You must be a comfort to one and all!\"    It became more and more apparent to me that this infernal kid must  somehow be turned out eftsoons or right speedily. I had hidden the  parcel behind my back, and I didn't think he had seen it; but I wanted  to get at that chest of drawers quick, before anyone else came along.    \"I shouldn't bother about tidying the room,\" I said.    \"I like tidying it. It's not a bit of trouble--really.\"    \"But it's quite tidy now.\"    \"Not so tidy as I shall make it.\"    This was getting perfectly rotten. I didn't want to murder the kid,  and yet there didn't seem any other way of shifting him. I pressed  down the mental accelerator. The old lemon throbbed fiercely. I got an  idea.    \"There's something much kinder than that which you could do,\" I said.  \"You see that box of cigars? Take it down to the smoking-room and snip  off the ends for me. That would save me no end of trouble. Stagger  along, laddie.\"    He seemed a bit doubtful; but he staggered. I shoved the parcel into a  drawer, locked it, trousered the key, and felt better. I might be a  chump, but, dash it, I could out-general a mere kid with a face like a  ferret. I went downstairs again. Just as I was passing the  smoking-room door, out curveted Edwin. It seemed to me that if he  wanted to do a real act of kindness he would commit suicide.    \"I'm snipping them,\" he said.    \"Snip on! Snip on!\"    \"Do you like them snipped much, or only a bit?\"    \"Medium.\"    \"All right. I'll be getting on, then.\"    \"I should.\"    And we parted.    Fellows who know all about that sort of thing--detectives, and so  on--will tell you that the most difficult thing in the world is to get  rid of the body. I remember, as a kid, having to learn by heart a poem  about a bird by the name of Eugene Aram, who had the deuce of a job in  this respect. All I can recall of the actual poetry is the bit that  goes:        _Tum-tum, tum-tum, tum-tumty-tum,      I slew him, tum-tum-tum!_    But I recollect that the poor blighter spent much of his valuable time  dumping the corpse into ponds and burying it, and what not, only to  have it pop out at him again. It was about an hour after I had shoved  the parcel into the drawer when I realised that I had let myself in  for just the same sort of thing.    Florence had talked in an airy sort of way about destroying the  manuscript; but when one came down to it, how the deuce can a chap  destroy a great chunky mass of paper in somebody else's house in the  middle of summer? I couldn't ask to have a fire in my bedroom, with  the thermometer in the eighties. And if I didn't burn the thing, how  else could I get rid of it? Fellows on the battle-field eat dispatches  to keep them from falling into the hands of the enemy, but it would  have taken me a year to eat Uncle Willoughby's Recollections.    I'm bound to say the problem absolutely baffled me. The only thing  seemed to be to leave the parcel in the drawer and hope for the best.    I don't know whether you have ever experienced it, but it's a dashed  unpleasant thing having a crime on one's conscience. Towards the end  of the day the mere sight of the drawer began to depress me. I found  myself getting all on edge; and once when Uncle Willoughby trickled  silently into the smoking-room when I was alone there and spoke to me  before I knew he was there, I broke the record for the sitting high  jump.    I was wondering all the time when Uncle Willoughby would sit up and  take notice. I didn't think he would have time to suspect that  anything had gone wrong till Saturday morning, when he would be  expecting, of course, to get the acknowledgment of the manuscript from  the publishers. But early on Friday evening he came out of the library  as I was passing and asked me to step in. He was looking considerably  rattled.    \"Bertie,\" he said--he always spoke in a precise sort of pompous kind  of way--\"an exceedingly disturbing thing has happened. As you know, I  dispatched the manuscript of my book to Messrs. Riggs and Ballinger,  the publishers, yesterday afternoon. It should have reached them by  the first post this morning. Why I should have been uneasy I cannot  say, but my mind was not altogether at rest respecting the safety of  the parcel. I therefore telephoned to Messrs. Riggs and Ballinger a  few moments back to make enquiries. To my consternation they informed  me that they were not yet in receipt of my manuscript.\"    \"Very rum!\"    \"I recollect distinctly placing it myself on the hall table in good  time to be taken to the village. But here is a sinister thing. I have  spoken to Oakshott, who took the rest of the letters to the post  office, and he cannot recall seeing it there. He is, indeed,  unswerving in his assertions that when he went to the hall to collect  the letters there was no parcel among them.\"    \"Sounds funny!\"    \"Bertie, shall I tell you what I suspect?\"    \"What's that?\"    \"The suspicion will no doubt sound to you incredible, but it alone  seems to fit the facts as we know them. I incline to the belief that  the parcel has been stolen.\"    \"Oh, I say! Surely not!\"    \"Wait! Hear me out. Though I have said nothing to you before, or to  anyone else, concerning the matter, the fact remains that during the  past few weeks a number of objects--some valuable, others not--have  disappeared in this house. The conclusion to which one is irresistibly  impelled is that we have a kleptomaniac in our midst. It is a  peculiarity of kleptomania, as you are no doubt aware, that the  subject is unable to differentiate between the intrinsic values of  objects.

I could have administered alcoholic stimulants to her but I had neglected  to provide myself with them when I fell down the shaft. This should be a  warning to people who habitually go around the country without alcoholic  stimulants.    Finally she breathed a long sigh and murmured, \"where am I?\" I told her  that I did not know, but wherever it might be, we were safe, and that  whatever she might say to me, I would promise her, should go no farther.    Then there was a long pause.    To encourage further conversation I asked her if she did not think we had  been having a rather backward spring. She said we had, but she prophesied  a long, open fall.    Then there was another pause, after which I offered her a seat on an old  red empty powder can. Still, she seemed shy and reserved. I would make a  remark to which she would reply briefly, and then there would be a pause  of a little over an hour. Still it seemed longer.    Suddenly the idea of marriage presented itself to my mind. If we never got  out of the shaft, of course an engagement need not be announced. No one  had ever plighted his or her troth at the bottom of a prospect shaft  before. It was certainly unique, to say the least. I suggested it to her.    She demurred to this on the ground that our acquaintance had been so  brief, and that we had never been thrown together before. I told her that  this would be no objection, and that my parents were so far away that I  did not think they would make any trouble about it.    She said that she did not mind her parents so much as she did the violent  temper of her husband.    I asked her if her husband had ever indulged in polygamy. She replied that  he had, frequently. He had several previous wives. I convinced her that in  the eyes of the law, and under the Edmunds bill, she was not bound to him.  Still she feared the consequences of his wrath.    Then I suggested a desperate plan. We would elope!    I was now thirty-seven years old, and yet had never eloped. Neither had  she. So, when the first streaks of rosy dawn crept across the soft,  autumnal sky and touched the rich and royal coloring on the rugged sides  of the grim old mountains, we got out of the shaft and eloped.          On Cyclones.    I desire to state that my position as United States Cyclonist for this  Judicial District is now vacant. I resigned on the 9th day of September,  A.D. 1884.    I have not the necessary personal magnetism to look a cyclone in the eye  and make it quail. I am stern and even haughty in my intercourse with men,  but when a Manitoba simoon takes me by the brow of my pantaloons and  throws me across Township 28, Range 18, West of the 5th Principal  Meridian, I lose my mental reserve and become anxious and even taciturn.  For thirty years I had yearned to see a grown up cyclone, of the  ring-tail-puller variety, mop up the green earth with huge forest trees  and make the landscape look tired. On the 9th day of September, A.D. 1884,  my morbid curiosity was gratified.    As the people came out into the forest with lanterns and pulled me out of  the crotch of a basswood tree with a \"tackle and fall,\" I remember I told  them I didn't yearn for any more atmospheric phenomena. The old desire for  a hurricane that would blow a cow through a penitentiary was satiated. I  remember when the doctor pried the bones of my leg together, in order to  kind of draw my attention away from the limb, he asked me how I liked the  fall style of Zephyr in that locality.    I said it was all right, what there was of it. I said this in a tone of  bitter irony.    Cyclones are of two kinds, viz: the dark maroon cyclone; and the iron gray  cyclone with pale green mane and tail. It was the latter kind I frolicked  with on the above-named date.    My brother and I were riding along in the grand old forest, and I had just  been singing a few bars from the opera of \"Whoop 'em Up, Lizzie Jane,\"  when I noticed that the wind was beginning to sough through the trees.  Soon after that, I noticed that I was soughing through the trees also, and  I am really no slouch of a sougher, either, when I get started.    The horse was hanging by the breeching from the bough of a large butternut  tree, waiting for some one to come and pick him.    [Illustration: WAITING TO BE PICKED.]    I did not see my brother at first, but after a while he disengaged himself  from a rail fence and came where I was hanging, wrong end up, with my  personal effects spilling out of my pockets. I told him that as soon as  the wind kind of softened down, I wished he would go and pick the horse.  He did so, and at midnight a party of friends carried me into town on a  stretcher. It was quite an ovation. To think of a torchlight procession  coming way out there into the woods at midnight, and carrying me into town  on their shoulders in triumph! And yet I was once only a poor boy!    It shows what may be accomplished by anyone if he will persevere and  insist on living a different life.    The cyclone is a natural phenomenon, enjoying the most robust health. It  may be a pleasure for a man with great will power and an iron constitution  to study more carefully into the habits of the cyclone, but as far as I am  concerned, individually, I could worry along some way if we didn't have a  phenomenon in the house from one year's end to another.    As I sit here, with my leg in a silicate of soda corset, and watch the  merry throng promenading down the street, or mingling in the giddy  torchlight procession, I cannot repress a feeling toward a cyclone that  almost amounts to disgust.          The Arabian Language.    The Arabian language belongs to what is called the Semitic or Shemitic  family of languages, and, when written, presents the appearance of a  general riot among the tadpoles and wrigglers of the United States.    The Arabian letter \"jeem\" or \"jim,\" which corresponds with our J,  resembles some of the spectacular wonders seen by the delirium tremons  expert. I do not know whether that is the reason the letter is called jeem  or jim, or not.    The letter \"sheen\" or \"shin,\" which is some like our \"sh\" in its effect,  is a very pretty letter, and enough of them would make very attractive  trimming for pantalets or other clothing. The entire Arabic alphabet, I  think, would work up first-rate into trimming for aprons, skirts, and so  forth.    Still it is not so rich in variety as the Chinese language. A Chinaman who  desires to publish a paper in order to fill a long felt want, must have a  small fortune in order to buy himself an alphabet. In this country we get  a press, and then, if we have any money left, we lay it out in type; but  in China the editor buys himself an alphabet and then regards the press as  a mere annex. If you go to a Chinese type maker and ask him to show you  his goods, he will ask you whether you want a two or a three story  alphabet.    The Chinese compositor spends most of his time riding up and down the  elevator, seeking for letters and dusting them off with a feather duster.  In large and wealthy offices the compositor sits at his case with the copy  before him, and has five or six boys running from one floor to another,  bringing him the letters of this wild and peculiar alphabet.    Sometimes they have to stop in the middle of a long editorial and send  down to Hong Kong and have a letter cast specially for that editorial.    Chinese compositors soon die from heart disease, because they have to run  up stairs and down so much in order to get the different letters needed.    One large publisher tried to have his case arranged in a high building  without floors, so that the compositor could reach each type by means of a  long pole, but one day there was a slight earthquake shock that spilled  the entire alphabet out of the case, all over the floor, and although that  was ninety-seven years ago last April, there are still two bushels of pi  on the floor of that office. The paper employs rat printers, and as they  have been engaged in assorting and distributing this mass of pi, it is  called rat pi in China, and the term is quite popular.    When the editor underscores a word, the Chinese compositor charges $9  extra for italicizing it. This is nothing more than fair, for he may have  to go all over the empire, and climb twenty-seven flights of stairs to  find the necessary italics. So it is much more economical in China to use  body type mostly in setting up a paper, and the old journalist will avoid  caps and italics, unless he is very wealthy.    Arabian literature is very rich, and more especially so in verse. How the  Arabian poets succeeded so well in writing their verse in their own  language, I can hardly understand. I find it very difficult to write  poetry which will be greedily snapped up and paid for, even when written  in the English language, but if I had to paw around for an hour to get a  button-hook for the end of the fourth line, so that it would rhyme with  the button-hook in the second line of the same verse, I believe it would  drive me mad.    The Arabian writer is very successful in a tale of fiction. He loves to  take a tale and re-write it for the press by carefully expunging the  facts. It is in lyric and romantic writing that he seems to excel.    The Arabian Nights is the most popular work that has survived the harsh  touch of time. Its age is not fully known, and as the author has been dead  several hundred years, I feel safe in saying that a number of the  incidents contained in this book are grossly inaccurate.    It has been translated several times with more or less success by various  writers, and some of the statements contained in the book are well worthy  of the advanced civilization, and wild word painting incident to a heated  presidential campaign.
