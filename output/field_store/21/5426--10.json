[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/12809"],[0,"Quiet Talks about Jesus (#13)"],[1,"you.\" He was  pleading before a court that stubbornly refuses testimony of fact. And to  this honest seeker, whom we must all love for his sincerity, He reveals  His inner consciousness of a tragic break coming, with a pleading word for  personal trust, and a saddened \"men love darkness.\"    With the going away of the Passover crowds, Jesus leaves the national  capital, and assists in the sort of work John was doing. His power to draw  men, and men's eagerness for Him, stand out sharply at once. John had  drawn great crowds of all classes. Jesus drew greater crowds. Multitudes  eagerly accepted John's teaching and accepted baptism from him. As it  turned out, greater multitudes of people, under the very eyes of these  ignoring, contemptuous leaders, accepted Jesus' leadership. John baptized.  Jesus baptized through His disciples. These leaders in their questioning  of John had tacitly acknowledged the propriety of \"the Christ\" using such  a rite. Jesus follows the line of least resistance, and fitted into the  one phase of His work which they had recognized as proper.    The pitiable fact stands out that the only result with _them_ is a wordy  strife about the relative success of these two, Jesus and John. The most  that their minds, steeped in jealousies and rivalries, ever watching with  badger eyes to undercut some one else, could see, was a rivalry between  these two men. John's instant open-hearted disclaimer made no impression  upon them. They seemed not impressionable to such disinterested loyalty.    A little later, probably not much, John's ruggedly honest preaching  against sin came too close home to suit Herod. He promptly shuts up the  preacher in prison, with no protest from the nation's leaders. These  leaders had developed peculiar power in influencing their civil rulers by  the strenuousness of their protests. That they permitted the imprisonment  of John with no word of protest, was a tacit throwing overboard of John's  own claims, of John's claims for Jesus, and of Jesus' own claim.    Here is the first sharp crisis. From the first, the circle of national  leaders characterized by John, the writer of the Gospel, as \"the Jews,\"  including the inner clique of chief priests and the Pharisees, ignored  Jesus; with silent contempt, coldly, severely ignored. This was before the  temple-cleansing affair. That intensified their attitude toward the next  stage. They had to proceed cautiously, because the crowd was with Jesus.  And full well these keen leaders knew the ticklishness of handling a  fanatical Oriental mob, as subsequent events showed. Now John is  imprisoned, with the consent of these leaders, possibly through their  connivance.    Jesus keenly and quickly grasps the situation. First ignored, then made  the subject of evil gossip, the temple clash, and now His closest friend  subjected to violence, His own rejection is painfully evident. He makes a  number of radical changes. His _place_ of activity is changed to a  neighboring province under different civil rule; His _method_, to  preaching from place to place; His _purpose_, to working with  _individuals_. There's a peculiar word used here by Matthew to tell of  Jesus' departure from Judea to a province under a different civil ruler;  \"He _withdrew_.\" The word used implies going away because of danger  threatening. We will run across it again and each time at a crisis point.    The leaders refused Jesus because He was not duly labelled. It seems to be  a prevailing characteristic to want men labelled, especially a  characteristic of those who make the labels. There is always an eager  desire regarding a stranger to learn whom he represents, who have put  their stamp upon him and accepted him. And if the label is satisfactory,  he is acccepted in the degree in which the label is accepted. Others are  marked with a large interrogation point. Inherent worth has a slow time.  But sure? Yes, but slow. Jesus bore no label whose words they could spell  out or wanted to. They were a bit rusty in the language of worth. How  knoweth this man letters, having never learned! He seems to know, to know  surprisingly well. He seems keenly versed in the law, able quickly to turn  the tables upon their catch questions. But then it can't be the real  article of learning, because He hasn't been in our established schools. He  has no sheepskin in a dead language with our learned doctors' names  learnedly inscribed. How indeed! An upstart!!    Yet always to the earnest, sincere inquirer there was authority enough. In  His acts, an open-minded doctor of the law could read the stamp of God's  approval. The ear open to learn, not waxed up by self-seeking plans, or  filled with gold dust, heard the voice of divine approval out of the  clouds, or in His presence and acts.        <u>The Aggressive Rejection.</u>      Then came the second stage, _the aggressive rejection._ This is the  plotting stage. Their hot passion is cooling now into a hardening purpose.  This has been shaping itself under the surface for months. Now it is open.  This was a crowded year for Jesus, and a year of crowds. The Galileans  had been in His southern audiences many a time and seen His miracles. The  news of His coming up north to their country swiftly spread everywhere.  The throngs are so great that the towns and villages are blockaded, and  Jesus has recourse to the fields, where the people gather in untold  thousands.    An ominous incident occurs at the very beginning of this Galilean work. It  is a fine touch of character that Jesus at once pays a visit to His home  village. One always thinks more of Him for that. He never forgot the home  folk. The synagogue service on the Sabbath day gathers the villagers  together. Jesus takes the teacher's place, and reads, from Isaiah, a bit  of the prophecy of the coming One. Then with a rare graciousness and  winsomeness that wins all hearts, and fastens every eye upon Himself, He  begins talking of the fulfilment of that word in Himself.    Then there comes a strange, quick revulsion of feeling. Had some  Jerusalem spy gotten in and begun his poisoning work already? Eyes begin  to harden and jaws become set. \"Why, that is the man that made our  cattle-yoke.\"--\"Yes, and fixed our kitchen table.\"--\"He--the Messiah!\"  Then words of rebuke gently spoken, but with truth's razor edge. Then a  hot burst of passion, and He is hustled out to the jagged edge of the hill  to be thrown over. Then that wondrous presence awing them back, as their  hooked hands lose hold, and their eyes again fasten with wonder, and He  passed quietly on His way undisturbed. Surely that was the best evidence  of the truth of His despised word.    Seven outstanding incidents here reveal the ever-hardening purpose of the  leaders against Jesus. First comes another clash in the temple. Their  ideas of what was proper on the Sabbath day receive a shock because a man  enslaved by disease for years was healed with a word from Jesus' lips.  Could there be a finer use of a Sabbath day! We can either think them  really shocked, or hunting for a religious chance to fight Him. Jesus'  reply seems so to enrage that a passion to kill Him grips them. It is  notable that they had no doubt of the extent of Jesus' claim; \"He called  God His own Father, making Himself equal with God.\" On these two things,  His use of the Sabbath, and His claim of divinity, is based the aggressive  campaign begun that day.    The incident draws from Him the marvellous words preserved by John in his  fifth chapter. In support of His claim He quietly brings forward five  witnesses, John His herald, His own miraculous acts, His Father, the  Scriptures entrusted to their care, and Moses, the founder of the nation.  That was a great line of testimony. This first thought of killing Him  seems to have been a burst of hot, passionate rage, but gradually we shall  find it cooled into a hardened, deliberate purpose.    At once Jesus returns to the northern province. And now they begin to  follow Him up, and spy upon His movements and words. In Capernaum, His  northern headquarters, a man apparently at unrest in soul about his sins,  and palsied in body, is first assured of forgiveness, and then made bodily  whole. Their criticism of His forgiving sins is silenced by the power  evidenced in the bodily healing. But their plan of campaign is now begun  in earnest, and is evident at once. Later criticism of His personal  conduct and habits with the despised classes is mingled with an attempt to  work upon His disciples and undermine their loyalty. The Sabbath question  comes up again through the disciples satisfying their hunger in the grain  fields, and brings from Jesus the keen comment that man wasn't made for  the Sabbath, but to be helped through that day, and then the statement  that must have angered them further that He was \"Lord of the Sabbath.\"    Another Sabbath day in the synagogue they were on hand to see if He would  heal a certain man with a whithered hand whom they had gotten track of,  \"that they might accuse Him.\" They were spying out evidence for the use of  the Jerusalem leaders. To His grief they harden their hearts against His  plea for saving a _man_, a _life_, as against a tradition. And as the man  with full heart and full eyes finds his chance of earning a living  restored, they rush out, and with the fire spitting from their eyes, and  teeth gritting, they plan to get their political enemies, the Herodians,  to help them kill Jesus. A number of these incidents give rise to these  passionate outbursts to kill, which seem to cool off, but to leave the  remnants that hardened into the cool purpose most to be dreaded.    A second time occurs that significant word, \"withdrew.\" Jesus withdrew to  the sea, followed by a remarkable multitude of Galileans, and others from  such distant points as Tyre and Sidon on the north, Idumea on the extreme  south, beyond the Jordan on the east, and from"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/12814"],[0,"Philippine Folk Tales (#13)"],[1,"ice.\"    In answer to this Lumawig took a small basket of rice and passed  it over five kettles and they were full. Then he called \"Yishtjau,\"  and some deer came running out of the forest. These were not what he  wanted, however, so he called again and some pigs came. He told the  people that they were each to catch one and for his brother-in-law  he selected the largest and best.    They all set out in pursuit of the pigs and the others quickly caught  theirs, but though the brother-in-law chased his until he was very  tired and hot he could not catch it Lumawig laughed at him and said:    \"You chase that pig until he is thin and still you cannot catch it,  though all the others have theirs.\"    Thereupon he grasped the hind legs of the pig and lifted it. All the  people laughed and the brother-in-law said:    \"Of course you can catch it, because I chased it until it was tired.\"    Lumawig then handed it to him and said, \"Here, you carry it.\" But no  sooner had the brother-in-law put it over his shoulder than it cut  loose and ran away.    \"Why did you let it go?\" asked Lumawig. \"Do you care nothing for it,  even after I caught it for you? Catch it again and bring it here.\"    So the brother-in-law started out again, and he chased it up stream  and down, but he could not catch it. Finally Lumawig reached down  and picked up the pig and carried it to the place where the others  were cooking.    After they had all eaten and drunk and made their offerings to the  spirits, Lumawig said:    \"Come, let us go to the mountain to consult the omen concerning the  northern tribes.\"    So they consulted the omen, but it was not favorable, and they were  starting home when the brother-in-law asked Lumawig to create some  water, as the people were hot and thirsty.    \"Why do you not create water, Lumawig?\" he repeated as Lumawig paid  no attention to him. \"You care nothing that the people are thirsty  and in need of drink.\"    Then they quarreled and were very angry and Lumawig  said to the people, \"Let us sit down and rest.\"    While they rested, Lumawig struck the rock with his spear and water  came out. [102] The brother-in-law jumped up to get a drink first, but  Lumawig held him back and said he must be the last to drink. So they  all drank, and when they had finished, the brother-in-law stepped up,  but Lumawig gave him a push which sent him into the rock and water  came from his body.    \"You must stay there,\" said Lumawig, \"because you have troubled me  a great deal.\" And they went home, leaving him in the rock.    Some time after this Lumawig decided to go back to the sky to live,  but before he went he took care that his wife should have a home. He  made a coffin of wood [103] and placed her in it with a dog at her  feet and a cock at her head. And as he set it floating on the water,  [104] he told it not to stop until it reached Tinglayen. Then, if  the foot end struck first, the dog should bark; and if the head end  was the first to strike, the cock should crow. So it floated away,  and on and on, until it came to Tinglayen.    Now a widower was sharpening his ax on the bank of the river, and when  he saw the coffin stop, he went to fish it out of the water. On shore  he started to open it, but Fugan cried out, \"Do not drive a wedge,  for I am here,\" So the widower opened it carefully and took Fugan up  to the town, and then as he had no wife of his own, he married her.        How the First Head was Taken [105]    _Igorot_      One day the Moon, who was a woman named Kabigat, sat out in the yard  making a large copper pot. The copper was still soft and pliable like  clay, and the woman squatted on the ground with the heavy pot against  her knees while she patted and shaped it. [106]    Now while she was working a son of Chal-chal, the Sun, came by and  stopped to watch her mould the form. Against the inside of the jar she  pressed a stone, while on the outside with a wooden paddle dripping  with water she pounded and slapped until she had worked down the  bulges and formed a smooth surface.    The boy was greatly interested in seeing the jar grow larger, more  beautiful, and smoother with each stroke, and he stood still for some  time. Suddenly the Moon looked up and saw him watching her. Instantly  she struck him with her paddle, cutting off his head.    Now the Sun was not near, but he knew as soon as the Moon had cut off  his son's head. And hurrying to the spot, he put the boy's head back  on, and he was alive again.    Then the Sun said to the Moon, \"You cut off my son's head, and because  you did this ever after on the earth people will cut off each other's  heads.\"        The Serpent Eagle [107]    _Igorot_      Once there lived two boys whose mother sent them every day to the  forest to get wood [108] for her fires. Each morning, as they started  out, she gave them some food for their trip, but it was always poor  and there was little of it, and she would say:    \"The wood that you brought yesterday was so poor that I cannot give  you much to eat today.\"    The boys tried very hard to please her, but if they brought nice pine  wood she scolded them, and if they brought large dry reeds she said:    \"These are no good for my fire, for they leave too much ashes in  the house.\"    Try as they would, they failed to satisfy her; and their bodies grew  very thin from working hard all day and from want of enough to eat.    One morning when they left for the mountains the mother gave them a  bit of dog meat to eat, and the boys were very sad. When they reached  the forest one of them said:    \"You wait here while I climb the tree and cut off some branches.\"    He went up the tree and soon called down, \"Here is some wood,\" and  the bones of his arm dropped to the ground.    \"Oh,\" cried his brother, \"it is your arm!\"    \"Here is some more wood,\" cried the other, and the bones of the other  arm dropped to the ground.    Then he called again, and the bones of his leg fell, then those of his  other leg, and so on till all the bones of his body lay on the ground.    \"Take these home,\" he said, \"and tell the woman that here is her wood;  she only wanted my bones.\"    The younger boy was very sad, for he was alone, and there was no one  to go down the mountain with him. He gathered up the bundle of wood,  wondering meanwhile what he should do, but just as he finished a  serpent eagle called down from the tree tops:    \"I will go with you, Brother.\"    So the boy put the bundle of wood on his shoulder, and as he was  going down the mountain, his brother, who was now a serpent eagle,  flew over his head. When he reached the house, he put down the bundle  and said to his mother:    \"Here is your wood.\"    When she looked at it she was very much frightened and ran out of  the house.    Then the serpent eagle circled round and round above her head and  called:    \"Quiukok! quiukok! quiukok! I do not need your food any more.\"        The Tattooed Men [109]    _Igorot_    Once there were two young men, very good friends, who were unhappy  because neither of them had been tattooed. [110] They felt that they  were not as beautiful as their friends.    One day they agreed to tattoo each other. One marked the breast and  back of the other, his arms and legs, and even his face. And when he  had finished, he took soot off the bottom of a cooking-pot and rubbed  it into all the marks; and he was tattooed beautifully.    The one who had done the work said to the other:    \"Now, my friend, you are very beautiful, and you must tattoo me.\"    Then the tattooed one scraped a great pile of black soot off the  cooking-pots, and before the other knew what he was about, he had  rubbed it all over him from the top of his head to the bottom of his  feet; and he was very black and greasy. The one who was covered with  soot became very angry and cried:    \"Why do you treat me so when I tattooed you so carefully?\"    They began to fight, but suddenly the beautifully tattooed one became  a great lizard which ran away and hid in the tall grass, while the  sooty one became a crow and flew away over the village. [111]        Tilin, The Rice Bird [112]    _Igorot_      One day when a mother was pounding out rice to cook for supper,  her little girl ran up to her and cried:    \"Oh, Mother, give me some of the raw rice to eat.\"    \"No,\" said the mother, \"it is not good for you to eat until it is  cooked. Wait for supper.\"    But the little girl persisted until the mother, out of patience, cried:    \"Be still. It is not good for you to talk so much!\"    When she had finished pounding the rice, the woman poured it into a  rice winnower and tossed it many times into the air. As soon as the  chaff was removed she emptied the rice into her basket and covered it  with the winnower. Then she took the jar upon her head, and started  for the spring to get water.    Now the little girl was fond of going to the spring with her mother,  for she loved to play in the cool water while her mother filled the  jars. But this time she did not go, and as soon as the woman was  out of sight, she ran to the basket of rice. She reached down to  take a handful of the grain. The cover slipped so that she fell,  and was covered up in the basket.    When the mother returned to the house, she heard a bird crying,  \"King, king, nik! nik! nik!\" She listened carefully, and as the  sound seemed to come from the basket, she removed the cover. To her  surprise, out hopped a little brown rice bird, and as it flew away  it kept calling back:    \"Goodbye, Mother; goodbye, Mother. You would not give me any rice  to eat.\"            WILD TRIBES OF MINDANAO        Introduction      About one thousand miles to the south and east of the Tinguian and  Igorot is the Island of Mindanao, which is inhabited by mortals and  immortals entirely unknown to the mountain tribes of the north.
