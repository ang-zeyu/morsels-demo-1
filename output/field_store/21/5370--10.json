Herewith were men fed for the  space of 500 yeeres, untill our language growing more polished, and  our minds more ticklish, they were driven to invent some novelties  wherewith to delight us. Thus came ye bookes of Amadis into light  among us in this last age.--Francis de la Noue, _Discourses_, 87  (1587).      AMAI'MON (3 _syl_.), one of the principal devils. Asmode'us is one of  his lieutenants. Shakespeare twice refers to him, in 1 _Henry IV._ act  ii. sc. 4, and in _The Merry Wives of Windsor_, act ii. sc. 2.    AMAL'AHTA, son of Erill'yab the deposed queen of the Hoamen (2  _syl_.), an Indian tribe settled on the south of the Missouri. He is  described as a brutal savage, wily, deceitful, and cruel. Amalahta  wished to marry the princess Goer'vyl, Madoc's sister, and even seized  her by force, but was killed in his flight.--Southey, _Madoc_, ii. 16  (1805).    AMALTHAE'A, the sibyl who offered to sell to Tarquin nine books  of prophetic oracles. When the king refused to give her the price  demanded, she went away, burnt three of them, and returning to the  king, demanded the same price for the remaining six. Again the king  declined the purchase. The sibyl, after burning three more of the  volumes, demanded the original sum for the remaining three. Tarquin  paid the money, and Amalthaea was never more seen. Aulus Gellius says  that Amalthaea burnt the books in the king's presence. Pliny affirms  that the original number of volumes was only three, two of which the  sibyl burnt, and the third was purchased by king Tarquin.    AMALTHE'A, a mistress of Ammon and mother of Bacchus. Ammon hid  his mistress in the island Nysa (in Africa), in order to elude the  vigilance and jealousy of his wife Rhea. This account (given by  Diodorus Sic'ulus, bk. iii., and by sir Walter Raleigh in his _History  of the World_, I. vi. 5) differs from the ordinary story, which makes  Sem'ele the mother of Bacchus, and Rhea his nurse. (Ammon is Ham or  Cham, the son of Noah, founder of the African race.)      ... that Nyseian ile,    Girt with the river Triton, where old Cham    (Whom Gentiles Ammon call, and Libyan Jove)    Hid Amalthea and her florid son,    Young Bacchus, from his stepdame Rhea's eye.    Milton, _Paradise Lost_, iv. 275 (1665).    AMANDA, wife of Loveless. Lord Foppington pays her amorous attentions,  but she utterly despises the conceited coxcomb, and treats him with  contumely. Colonel Townly, in order to pique his lady-love, also  pays attention to Loveless's wife, but she repels his advances with  indignation, and Loveless, who overhears her, conscious of his own  shortcomings, resolves to reform his ways, and, \"forsaking all  other,\" to remain true to Amanda, \"so long as they both should  live.\"--Sheridan, _A Trip to Scarborough_.    _Aman'da_, in Thomson's _Seasons_, is meant for Miss Young, who  married admiral Campbell.      And thou, Amanda, come, pride of my song!    Formed by the Graces, loveliness itself.    \"Spring,\" 480, 481 (1728).    _Amanda_, the victim of Peregrine Pickle's seduction, in Smollett's  novel of _Peregrine Pickle_ (1751).    _Amanda_, worldly woman in Julia Ward Howe's poem, _Amanda's  Inventory_, who sums up her wealth and honors, and is forced to  conclude the list with death (1866).    AMARAN'TA, wife of Bar'tolus, the covetous lawyer. She was wantonly  loved by Leandro, a Spanish gentleman.--Beaumont and Fletcher, _The  Spanish Curate_ (1622).    AM'ARANTH (_Lady_), in _Wild Oats_, by John O'Keefe, a famous part of  Mrs. Pope (1740-1797).    AMARIL'LIS, a shepherdess in love with Per'igot (_t_ sounded), but  Perigot loved Am'oret. In order to break off this affection, Amarillis  induced \"the sullen shepherd\" to dip her in \"the magic well,\" whereby  she became transformed into the perfect resemblance of her rival, and  soon effectually disgusted Perigot with her bold and wanton conduct.  When afterwards he met the true Amoret, he repulsed her, and even  wounded her with intent to kill. Ultimately, the trick was discovered  by Cor'in, \"the faithful shepherdess,\" and Perigot was married to his  true love.--John Fletcher, _The Faithful Shepherd_ (1610).    AMARYLLIS, in Spenser's pastoral _Colin Clout's Come Home Again_, was  the countess of Derby. Her name was Alice, and she was the youngest of  the six daughters of sir John Spenser, of Althorpe, ancestor of the  noble houses of Spenser and Marlborough. After the death of the  earl, the widow married sir Thomas Egerton, keeper of the Great Seal  (afterwards baron of Ellesmere and viscount Brackley). It was for this  very lady, during her widowhood, that Milton wrote his _Ar'cades_ (3  _syl_.).      No less praiseworthy are the sisters three,    The honour of the noble family    Of which I meanest boast myself to be ...    Phyllis, Charyllis, and sweet Amaryllis:    Phyllis the fair is eldest of the three,    The next to her is bountiful Charyllis,    But th' youngest is the highest in degree.    Spenser, _Colin Clout's Come Home Again_ (1594).    AM'ASISI, _Amosis_, or _Aah'mes_ (3 _syl_.), founder of the eighteenth  Egyptian dynasty (B.C. 1610). Lord Brooke attributes to him one of the  pyramids. The three chief pyramids are usually ascribed to Suphis (or  Cheops), Sen-Suphis (or Cephrenes), and Mencheres, all of the fourth  dynasty.      Amasis and Cheops how can time forgive.    Who in their useless pyramids would live?    Lord Brooke, _Peace_.    AMATEUR (_An_), Pierce Egan the younger published under this pseudonym  his _Real Life in London_, or _The Rambles and Adventures of Rob  Tally-ho, Esq., and his Cousin, the Hon. Tom Dashall, through the  Metropolis_ (1821-2).    AMAUROTS (_The_), a people whose kingdom was invaded by the Dipsodes  (2 _syl_.), but Pantag'ruel, coming to their defence, utterly routed  the invaders.--Rabelais, _Pantagruel_, ii. (1533).    AMA'VIA, the personification of Intemperance in grief. Hearing that  her husband, sir Mordant, had been enticed to the Bower of Bliss by  the enchantress Acra'sia, she went in quest of him, and found him so  changed in mind and body she could scarcely recognize him; however,  she managed by tact to bring him away, but he died on the road, and  Amavia stabbed herself from excessive grief.--Spenser, _Faery Queen_,  ii. 1 (1590).    AMAZO'NA, a fairy, who freed a certain country from the Ogri and the  Blue Centaur. When she sounded her trumpet, the sick were recovered  and became both young and strong. She gave the princess Carpil'lona a  bunch of gilly-flowers, which enabled her to pass unrecognized before  those who knew her well.--Comtesse D'Aunoy, _Fairy Tales_ (\"The  Princess Carpillona,\" 1682).    AMAZONS, a fabled race of women-warriors. It was said that in order to  use the bow, they cut off one of their breasts.    AMBER, said to be a concretion of birds' tears, but the birds were the  sisters of Melea'ger, called Meleag'rides, who never ceased weeping  for their dead brother.--Pliny, _Natural History_, xxxvii. 2, 11.      Around thee shall glisten the loveliest amber.    That ever the sorrowing sea-birds have wept.    T. Moore, _Fire-Worshippers_.    AM'BROSE (2 _syl_.), a sharper, who assumed in the presence of Gil  Blas the character of a devotee. He was in league with a fellow who  assumed the name of don Raphael, and a young woman who called herself  Camilla, cousin of donna Mencia. These three sharpers allure Gil Blas  to a house which Camilla says is hers, fleece him of his ring, his  portmanteau, and his money, decamp, and leave him to find out that the  house is only a hired lodging.--Lesage, _Gil Blas_, i. 15, 16 (1715).    (This incident is borrowed from Espinel's romance entitled _Vida de  Escudero, marcos de Obregon_, 1618.)    _Am'brose_ (2 _syl_.), a male domestic servant waiting on Miss  Seraphine and Miss Angelica Arthuret.--Sir W. Scott, _Redgauntlet_  (time, George II.).    _Ambrose (Brother)_, a monk who attended the prior Aymer, of Jorvaulx  Abbey.--Sir W. Scott, _Ivanhoe_ (time, Richard I.).    _Am'brosius (Father)_, abbot of Kennaquhair, is Edward Glendinning,  brother of sir Halbert Glendinning (the knight of Avenel). He appears  at Kinross, disguised as a nobleman's retainer.--Sir W. Scott, _The  Abbot_ (time, Elizabeth).    AME'LIA, heroine of novel of same name. Young daughter of a German  inn-keeper, who rises to a high position in society, through native  merit, graces of mind and person.--Eliza Leslie (1843).    _Ame'lia_, a model of conjugal affection, in Fielding's novel so  called. It is said that the character was modelled from his own  wife. Dr. Johnson read this novel from beginning to end without once  stopping.      _Amelia_ is perhaps the only book of which, being printed off betimes  one morning, a new edition was called for before night. The character  of Amelia is the most pleasing heroine of all the romances.--Dr.  Johnson.      _Ame'lia_, in Thomson's _Seasons_, a beautiful, innocent young woman,  overtaken by a storm while walking with her troth-plight lover,  Cel'adon, \"with equal virtue formed, and equal grace. Hers the mild  lustre of the blooming morn, and his the radiance of the risen day.\"  Amelia grew frightened, but Celadon said, \"'Tis safety to be near  thee, sure;\" when a flash of lightning struck her dead in his  arms.--\"Summer\" (1727).    _Amelia_, in Schiller's tragedy of _The Robbers_.      Or they will learn how generous worth sublimes    The robber Moor, and pleads for all his crimes;    How poor Amelia kissed with many a tear    His hand, blood-stained, but ever, ever dear.    Campbell, _Pleasures of Hope_, ii. (1799).    _Amelia Bailey_, ambitious woman with \"literary tastes,\" who in  pursuit of a suitable sphere, marries a rich Californian, and \"shines  with the diamonds her husband has bought, and makes a noise, but it is  the blare of vulgar ostentation,\"--William Henry Rideing, _A Little  Upstart_ (1885).    AMELOT "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/11440"],[0,"Tales of Three Hemispheres (#13)"],[1,"say it.  I did  not intend to insult any one.\"    \"Why he knows nothing at all,\" said the old black cat.  And everybody  laughed till the poets were put to bed.    And then I took one look at the fields we know, and turned to the  other window that looks on the elfin mountains.  And the evening  looked like a sapphire.  And I saw my way though the fields were  growing dim, and when I found it I went downstairs and through the  witch's parlour, and out of doors and came that night to the palace of  Singanee.    Lights glittered through every crystal slab--and all were  uncurtained--in the palace of ivory.  The sounds were those of a  triumphant dance. Very haunting indeed was the booming of a bassoon,  and like the dangerous advance of some galloping beast were the blows  wielded by a powerful man on the huge, sonourous drum.  It seemed to  me as I listened that the contest of Singanee with the more than  elephantine destroyer of Perdondaris had already been set to music.  And as I walked in the dark along the amethyst precipice I suddenly  saw across it a curved white bridge.  It was one ivory tusk.  And I  knew it for the triumph of Singanee.  I knew at once that this curved  mass of ivory that had been dragged by ropes to bridge the abyss was  the twin of the ivory gate that once Perdondaris had, and had itself  been the destruction of that once famous city--towers and walls and  people. Already men had begun to hollow it and to carve human figures  life-size along its sides.  I walked across it; and half way across,  at the bottom of the curve, I met a few of the carvers fast asleep. On  the opposite cliff by the palace lay the thickest end of the tusk and  I came down a ladder which leaned against the tusk for they had not  yet carved steps.    Outside the ivory palace it was as I had supposed and the sentry at  the gate slept heavily; and though I asked of him permission to enter  the palace he only muttered a blessing on Singanee and fell asleep  again. It was evident that he had been drinking bak.  Inside the ivory  hall I met with servitors who told me that any stranger was welcome  there that night, because they extolled the triumph of Singanee.  And  they offered me bak to drink to commemorate the splendour but I did  not know its power nor whether a little or much prevailed over a man  so I said that I was under an oath to a god to drink nothing  beautiful; and they asked me if he could not be appeased by a prayer,  and I said, \"In nowise,\" and went towards the dance; and they  commiserated me and abused that god bitterly, thinking to please me  thereby, and then they fell to drinking bak to the glory of Singanee.  Outside the curtains that hung before the dance there stood a  chamberlain and when I told him that though a stranger there, yet I  was well known to Mung and Sish and Kib, the gods of Pegana, whose  signs I made, he bade me ample welcome. Therefore I questioned him  about my clothes asking if they were not unsuitable to so august an  occasion and he swore by the spear that had slain the destroyer of  Perdondaris that Singanee would think it a shameful thing that any  stranger not unknown to the gods should enter the dancing hall  unsuitably clad; and therefore he led me to another room and took  silken robes out of an old sea-chest of black and seamy oak with green  copper hasps that were set with a few pale sapphires, and requested me  to choose a suitable robe.  And I chose a bright green robe, with an  under-robe of light blue which was seen here and there, and a light  blue sword-belt.  I also wore a cloak that was dark purple with two  thin strips of dark-blue along the border and a row of large dark  sapphires sewn along the purple between them; it hung down from my  shoulders behind me.  Nor would the chamberlain of Singanee let me  take any less than this, for he said that not even a stranger, on that  night, could be allowed to stand in the way of his master's  munificence which he was pleased to exercise in honour of his victory.  As soon as I was attired we went to the dancing hall and the first  thing that I saw in that tall, scintillant chamber was the huge form  of Singanee standing among the dancers and the heads of the men no  higher than his waist.  Bare were the huge arms that had held the  spear that had avenged Perdondaris.  The chamberlain led me to him and  I bowed, and said that I gave thanks to the gods to whom he looked for  protection; and he said that he had heard my gods well spoken of by  those accustomed to pray but this he said only of courtesy, for he  knew not whom they were.    Singanee was simply dressed and only wore on his head a plain gold  band to keep his hair from falling over his forehead, the ends of the  gold were tied in the back with a bow of purple silk.  But all his  queens wore crowns of great magnificence, though whether they were  crowned as the queens of Singanee or whether queens were attracted  there from the thrones of distant lands by the wonder of him and the  splendour I did not know.    All there wore silken robes of brilliant colours and the feet of all  were bare and very shapely for the custom of boots was unknown in  those regions.  And when they saw that my big toes were deformed in  the manner of Europeans, turning inwards towards the others instead of  being straight, one or two asked sympathetically if an accident had  befallen me.  And rather than tell them truly that deforming out big  toes was our custom and our pleasure I told them that I was under the  curse of a malignant god at whose feet I had neglected to offer  berries in infancy.  And to some extent I justified myself, for  Convention is a god though his ways are evil; and had I told them the  truth I would not have been understood.  They gave me a lady to dance  with who was of marvellous beauty, she told me that her name was  Saranoora, a princess from the North, who had been sent as tribute to  the palace of Singanee. And partly she danced as Europeans dance and  partly as the fairies of the waste who lure, as legend has it, lost  travellers to their doom. And if I could get thirty heathen men out of  fantastic lands, with their long black hair and little elfin eyes and  instruments of music even unknown to Nebuchadnezzar the King; and if I  could make them play those tunes that I heard in the ivory palace on  some lawn, gentle reader, at evening near your house then you would  understand the beauty of Saranoora and the blaze of light and colour  in that stupendous hall and the lithesome movement of those mysterious  queens that danced round Singanee.  Then gentle reader you would be  gentle no more but the thoughts that run like leopards over the far  free lands would come leaping into your head even were it London, yes,  even in London: you would rise up then and beat your hands on the wall  with its pretty pattern of flowers, in the hope that the bricks might  break and reveal the way to that palace of ivory by the amethyst gulf  where the golden dragons are. For there have been men who have burned  prisons down that the prisoners might escape, and even such  incendiaries those dark musicians are who dangerously burn down custom  that the pining thoughts may go free.  Let your elders have no fear,  have no fear.  I will not play those tunes in any streets we know.  I  will not bring those strange musicians here, I will only whisper the  way to the Lands of Dream, and only a few frail feet shall find the  way, and I shall dream alone of the beauty of Saranoora and sometimes  sigh.  We danced on and on at the will of the thirty musicians, but  when the stars were paling and the wind that knew the dawn was  ruffling up the edge of the skirts of night, then Saranoora the  princess of the North led me out into a garden.  Dark groves of trees  were there which filled the night with perfume and guarded night's  mysteries from the arising dawn.  There floated over us, wandering in  that garden, the triumphant melody of those dark musicians, whose  origin was unguessed even by those that dwelt there and knew the Lands  of Dream.  For only a moment once sang the tolulu-bird, for the  festival of that night had scared him and he was silent.  For only a  moment once we heard him singing in some far grove because the  musicians rested and our bare feet made no sound; for a moment we  heard that bird of which once our nightingale dreamed and handed on  the tradition to his children.  And Saranoora told me that they have  named the bird the Sister of Song; but for the musicians, who  presently played again, she said they had no name, for no one knew who  they were or from what country.  Then some one sang quite near us in  the darkness to an instrument of strings telling of Singanee and his  battle against the monster.  And soon we saw him sitting on the ground  and singing to the night of that spear-thrust that had found the  thumping heart of the destroyer of Perdondaris; and we stopped awhile  and asked him who had seen so memorable a struggle and he answered  none but Singanee and he whose tusk had scattered Perdondaris, and now  the last was dead.  And when we asked him if Singanee had told him of  the struggle he said that that proud hunter would say no word about it  and that therefore his mighty deed was given to the poets and become  their trust forever, and he struck again his instrument of strings and  sang on.    When the strings of pearls that hung down from her neck began to gleam  all over Saranoora I knew that dawn was near and that that memorable  night was all but gone.  And at last we left the garden and came to  the abyss to see the sunrise shine on the amethyst cliff. And at first  it lit up the beauty of Saranoora and then it topped the world and  blazed upon those cliffs of amethyst until it dazzled our eyes, and we  turned from it and saw the workman going out along the tusk to hollow  it and to carve a balustrade of fair professional figures."]]]
