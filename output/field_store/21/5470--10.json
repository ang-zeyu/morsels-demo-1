We should represent them as a lawless, piratical set of unprincipled  robbers, plunderers and villains, who basely prostituted the superior power  and information, which God had given them for worthy purposes to the vilest  of all ends. We should not hesitate to say that they made use of those  advantages only to infringe upon every dictate of justice; to trample under  foot every suggestion of principle, and to spurn, with contempt, every  right of humanity.    The Algerines are reprobated all the world over, for their unlawful  depredations; and stigmatized as pirates, for their unreasonable exactions  from foreign nations. But, the Algerines are no greater pirates than the  Americans; nor are they a race more destructive to the happiness to  mankind. The depredations of the latter on the coast of Africa, and upon  the Indians' Territory make the truth of this assertion manifest. The  piratical depredations of the Algerines appear to be a judgment from  heaven upon the nations, to punish their perfidy and atrocious violations  of justice; and never did any people more justly merit the scourge than  Americans, on whom it seems to fall with peculiar and reiterated violence.  When they yoke our citizens to the plow, and compel them to labour in that  degraded manner, they only retaliate on us for similar barbarities. For  Algiers is a part of the same country, whose helpless inhabitants we are  accustomed to carry away. But the English and Americans cautiously avoid  engaging with a warlike people, whom they fear to attack in a manner so  base and unworthy; whilst the Algerines, more generous and courageous  plunderers, are not afraid to make war on brave and well-disciplined  enemies, who are capable of making a gallant resistance.    Whoever examines into the conditions of the slaves in America will find  them in a state of the most uncultivated rudeness. Not instructed in any  kind of learning, they are grossly ignorant of all refinement, and have  little else about them, belonging to the nature of civilized man, than mere  form. They are strangers to almost every idea, that doth not relate to  their labour or their food; and though naturally possessed of strong  sagacity, and lively parts, are, in all respects, in a state of most  deplorable brutality.--This is owing to the iron-hand of oppression, which  ever crushes the bud of genius and binds up in chains every expansion of  the human mind.--Such is their extreme ignorance that they are utterly  unacquainted with the laws of the world--the injunctions of religion--their  own natural rights, and the forms, ceremonies and privileges of marriage  originally established by the Divinity. Accordingly they lived in open  violation of the precepts of christianity and with as little formality or  restrictions as the brutes of the field, unite for the purposes of  procreation. Yet this is a civilized country and a most enlightened period  of the world! The resplendent glory of the gospel is at hand, to conduct us  in safety through the labyrinths of life. Science hath grown up to  maturity, and is discovered to possess not only all the properties of  solidity of strength, but likewise every ornament of elegance, and every  embellishment of fancy. Philosophy hath here attained the most exalted  height of elevation; and the art of government hath received such  refinements among us, as hath equally astonished our friends, our enemies  and ourselves. In fine, no annals are more brilliant than those of America;  nor do any more luxuriantly abound with examples of exalted heroism,  refined policy, and sympathetic humanity. Yet now the prospect begins to  change; and all the splendor of this august assemblage, will soon be  overcast by sudden and impenetrable clouds; and American greatness be  obliterated and swallowed up by one enormity. Slavery diffuses the gloom,  and casts around us the deepest shade of approaching darkness. No longer  shall the united states of America be famed for liberty. Oppression  pervades their bowels; and while they exhibit a fair exterior to the other  parts of the world, they are nothing more than \"painted sepulchres,\"  containing within them nought but rottenness and corruption.    Ye voluptuous, ye opulent and great, who hold in subjection such numbers of  your fellow-creatures, and suffer these things to happen--beware! Reflect  on this lamentable change, that may, at a future period, take place against  you. Arraigned before the almighty Sovereign of the universe, how will you  answer the charge of such complicated enormity? The presence of these  slaves, who have been lost, for want of your instruction, and by means of  your oppression, shall make you dart deeper into the flames, to avoid their  just reproaches, and seek out for an asylum, in the hidden corners of  perdition.    Many persons of opulence in Virginia, and the Carolinas, treat their  unhappy slaves with every circumstance of coolest neglect, and the most  deliberate indifference. Surrounded with a numerous train of servants,  to contribute to their personal ease, and wallowing in all the luxurious  plenitude of riches, they neglect the wretched source, whence they draw  this profusion. Many of their negroes, on distant estates, are left to  the entire management of inhuman overseers, where they suffer for the  want of that sustenance, which, at the proprietors seat of residence,  is wastefully given to the dogs. It frequently happens, on these large  estates, that they are not clothed, 'till winter is nearly expired;  and then, the most valuable only are attended to; the young, and the  labour-worn, having no other allowance, in this respect, than the  tattered garments, thrown off by the more fortunate. A single peck of  corn a week, or the like measure of rice, is the ordinary quantity of  provision for a hard working slave; to which a small quantity of meat is  occasionally, tho' rarely, added. While those miserable degraded persons  thus scantily subsist, all the produce of their unwearied toil, is taken  away to satiate their rapacious master. He, devoted wretch! thoughtless  of the sweat and toil with which his wearied, exhausted dependents  procure what he extravagantly dissipates, not contented with the ordinary  luxuries of life, is, perhaps, planning, at the time, some improvement on  the voluptuous art.--Thus he sets up two carriages instead of one;  maintains twenty servants, when a fourth part of that number are more than  sufficient to discharge the business of personal attendance; makes every  animal, proper for the purpose, bleed around him, in order to supply the  gluttonous profusion of his table; and generally gives away what his slaves  are pining for;--those very slaves, whose labour enables him to display  this liberality!--No comment is necessary, to expose the peculiar folly,  ingratitude, and infamy of such execrable conduct.    But the custom of neglecting those slaves, who have been worn out in our  service, is unhappily found to prevail, not only among the more opulent but  thro' the more extensive round of the middle and inferior ranks of life. No  better reason can be given for this base inattention, than that they are no  longer able to contribute to our emoluments. With singular dishonor, we  forget the faithful instrument of past enjoyment, and when, by length of  time, it becomes debilitated, it is, like a withered stalk, ungratefully  thrown away.    Our slaves unquestionably have the strongest of all claims upon us, for  protection and support; we having compelled them to involuntary servitude,  and deprived them of every means of protecting or supporting themselves.  The injustice of our conduct, and barbarity of our neglect, when this  reflexion is allowed to predominate, becomes so glaringly conspicuous, as  even to excite, against ourselves, the strongest emotion of detestation and  abhorrence.    To whom are the wretched sons of Africa to apply for redress, if their  cruel master treats them with unkindness? To whom will they resort for  protection, if he is base enough to refuse it to them? The law is not their  friend;--alas! too many statutes are enacted against them. The world is not  their friend;--the iniquity is too general and extensive. No one who hath  slaves of his own, will protect those of another, less the practice should  be retorted. Thus when their masters abandon them, their situation is  destitute and forlorn, and God is their only friend!    Let us imitate the conduct of a neighboring state, and immediately take  measures, at least, for the gradual abolition of slavery.[6] Justice  demands it of us, and we ought not to hesitate in obeying its inviolable  mandates.--All the feelings of pity, compassion, affection, and  benevolence--all the emotions of tenderness, humanity, philanthropy, and  goodness--all the sentiments of mercy, probity, honour, and integrity,  unite to solicit for their emancipation. Immortal will be the glory of  accomplishing their liberation; and eternal the disgrace of keeping them  in chains.    But, if the state of Pennsylvania is to be applauded for her conduct, that  of South Carolina can never be too strongly execrated.[7] The legislature  of that state, at no very remote period, brought in a bill for prohibiting  the use of letters to their slaves, and forbidding them the privilege of  being taught to read!--This was a deliberate attempt to enslave the minds  of those unfortunate objects, whose persons they already held in arbitrary  subjection:--Detestable deviation from the becoming rectitude of man.    One more peculiarly distressing circumstance remains to be recounted,  before I take my final leave of the subject.--In the ordinary course of the  business of the"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/13643"],[0,"International Weekly Miscellany of Literature, Art and Science - Volume 1, No. (#13)"],[1," was beautiful. She  breathed with avidity the pure air which, in imagination, brought to  her the kisses and caresses of her poor father! Her foster-father was,  doubtless, occupied with his bees; but his wife?    Anielka opened the door of the cabin; all was silent and deserted. The  arm-chair on which the poor old woman used to sit, was overturned in a  corner. Anielka was chilled by a fearful presentiment. She went with a  slow step toward the bee-hives; there she saw a little boy tending the  bees, whilst the old man was stretched on the ground beside him. The  rays of the sun, falling on his pale and sickly face, showed that he  was very ill. Anielka stooped down over him, and said, \"It is I, it is  Anielka, your own Anielka, who always loves you.\"    The old man raised his head, gazed upon her with a ghastly smile, and  took off his cap.    \"And my good old mother, where is she?\" Anielka asked.    \"She is dead!\" answered the old man, and falling back he began  laughing idiotically. Anielka wept. She gazed earnestly on the worn  frame, the pale and wrinkled cheeks, it which scarcely a sign of  life could be perceived; it seemed to her that he had suddenly fallen  asleep, and not wishing to disturb him, she went to the carriage for  the presents. When she returned, she took his hand. It was cold. The  poor old bee-keeper had breathed his last!    Anielka was carried almost senseless back to the carriage, which  quickly returned with her to the castle. There she revived a little;  but the recollection that she was now quite alone in the world, almost  drove her to despair.    Her master's wedding and the journey to Florence were a dream to  her. Though the strange sights of a strange city slowly restored her  perceptions, they did not her cheerfulness. She felt as if she could  no longer endure the misery of her life; she prayed to die.    \"Why are you so unhappy?\" said the Count Leon kindly to her, one day.    To have explained the cause of her wretchedness would have been death  indeed.    \"I am going to give you a treat,\" continued Leon. \"A celebrated singer  is to appear to-night in the theater. I will send you to hear her, and  afterward you shall sing to me what you remember of her performances.\"    Anielka went. It was a new era in her existence. Herself, by this  time, an artist, she could forget her griefs, and enter with her  whole soul into the beauties of the art she now heard practiced in  perfection for the first time. To music a chord responded in her  breast which vibrated powerfully. During the performances she was  at one moment pale and trembling, tears rushing into her eyes; at  another, she was ready to throw herself at the feet of the cantatrice,  in an ecstacy of admiration. \"Prima donna,\"--by that name the public  called on her to receive their applause, and it was the same, thought  Anielka, that Justiniani had bestowed upon her. Could she also be a  prima donna? What a glorious destiny! To be able to communicate one's  own emotions to masses of entranced listeners; to awaken in them, by  the power of the voice, grief, love, terror.    Strange thoughts continued to haunt her on her return home. She was  unable to sleep. She formed desperate plans. At last she resolved to  throw off the yoke of servitude, and the still more painful slavery of  feelings which her pride disdained. Having learnt the address of the  prima donna, she went early one morning to her house.    On entering she said, in French, almost incoherently, so great was her  agitation--\"Madam, I am a poor serf belonging to a Polish family who  have lately arrived in Florence. I have escaped from them; protect,  shelter me. They say I can sing.\"    The Signora Teresina, a warm-hearted, passionate Italian, was  interested by her artless earnestness. She said, \"Poor child! you must  have suffered much,\"--she took Anielka's hand in hers. \"You say you  can sing; let me hear you.\" Anielka seated herself on an ottoman. She  clasped her hands over her knees, and tears fell into her lap. With  plaintive pathos, and perfect truth of intonation, she prayed in  song. The Hymn to the Virgin seemed to Teresina to be offered up by  inspiration.    The Signora was astonished. \"Where,\" she asked, in wonder, \"were you  taught?\"    Anielka narrated her history, and when she had finished, the prima  donna spoke so kindly to her that she felt as if she had known her for  years. Anielka was Teresina's guest that day and the next. After the  Opera, on the third day, the prima donna made her sit beside her, and  said:--    \"I think you are a very good girl, and you shall stay with me always.\"    The girl was almost beside herself with joy.    \"We will never part. Do you consent, Anielka?\"    \"Do not call me Anielka. Give me instead some Italian name.\"    \"Well, then, be Giovanna. The dearest friend I ever had but whom I  have lost--was named Giovanna,\" said the prima donna.    \"Then, I will be another Giovanna to you.\"    Teresina then said, \"I hesitated to receive you at first, for your  sake as well as mine; it you are safe now. I learn that your master  and mistress, after searching vainly for you, have returned to  Poland.\"    From this time Anielka commenced an entirely new life. She took  lessons in singing every day from the Signora. and got an engagement  to appear in inferior characters at the theater. She had now her own  income, and her own servant--she, who till then had been obliged to  serve herself. She acquired the Italian language rapidly, and soon  passed for a native of the country.    So passed three years. New and varied impressions failed, however,  to blot out the old ones. Anielka arrived at great perfection in her  singing, and even began to surpass the prima donna, who was losing  her voice from weakness of the chest. This sad discovery changed the  cheerful temper of Teresina. She ceased to sing in public; for she  could not endure to excite pity, where she had formerly commanded  admiration.    She determined to retire. \"You,\" she said to Anielka, \"shall now  assert your claim to the first rank in the vocal art. You will  maintain it. You surpass me. Often, on hearing you sing, I have  scarcely been able to stifle a feeling of jealousy.\"    Anielka placed her hand on Teresina's shoulder, and kissed her.    \"Yes,\" continued Teresina, regardless of everything but the bright  future she was shaping for her friend. \"We will go to Vienna--there  you will be understood and appreciated. You shall sing at the  Italian Opera, and I will be by your side--unknown, no longer sought,  worshiped--but will glory in your triumphs. They will be a repetition  of my own; for have I not taught you? Will they not be the result of  my work!\"    Though Anielka's ambition was fired, her heart was softened, and she  wept violently.    Five months had scarcely elapsed, when a _furore_ was created in  Vienna by the first appearance, at the Italian Opera, of the Signora  Giovanna. Her enormous salary at once afforded her the means of even  extravagant expenditure. Her haughty treatment of male admirers only  attracted new ones; but in the midst of her triumphs she thought often  of the time when the poor orphan of Pobereze was cared for by nobody.  This remembrance made her receive the flatteries of the crowd with  an ironical smile; their fine speeches fell coldly on her ear, their  eloquent looks made no impression on her heart: _that_, no change  could alter, no temptation win.    In the flood of unexpected success a new misfortune overwhelmed her.  Since their arrival at Vienna, Teresina's health rapidly declined, and  in the sixth month of Anielka's operatic reign she expired, leaving  all her wealth, which was considerable, to her friend.    Once more Anielka was alone in the world. Despite all the honors and  blandishments of her position, the old feeling of desolateness came  upon her. The new shock destroyed her health. She was unable to appear  on the stage. To sing was a painful effort; she grew indifferent to  what passed around her. Her greatest consolation was in succoring the  poor and friendless, and her generosity was most conspicuous to all  young orphan girls without fortune. She had never ceased to love her  native land, and seldom appeared in society, unless it was to meet her  countrymen. If ever she sang, it was in Polish.    A year had elapsed since the death of the Signora Teresina, when  the Count Selka, a rich noble of Volkynia, at that time in Vienna,  solicited her presence at a party. It was impossible to refuse the  Count and his lady, from whom she had received great kindness.  She went. When in their saloons, filled with all the fashion and  aristocracy in Vienna, the name of Giovanna was announced, a general  murmur was heard. She entered, pale and languid, and proceeded between  the two rows made for her by the admiring assembly, to the seat of  honor beside the mistress of the house.    Shortly after, the Count Selka led her to the piano. She sat down  before it, and thinking what she should sing, glanced round upon the  assembly. She could not help feeling that the admiration which beamed  from the faces around her was the work of her own merit, for had she  neglected the great gift of nature--her voice, she could not have  excited it. With a blushing cheek, and eyes sparkling with honest  pride, she struck the piano with a firm hand, and from her seemingly  weak and delicate chest poured forth a touching Polish melody, with a  voice pure, sonorous, and plaintive. Tears were in many eyes, and the  beating of every heart was quickened.    The song was finished, but the wondering silence was unbroken.  Giovanna leaned exhausted on the arm of the chair, and cast down  her eyes. On again raising them, she perceived a gentleman who gazed  fixedly at her, as if he still listened to echoes which had not  yet died within him. The master of the house, to dissipate his  thoughtfulness, led him toward Giovanna. \"Let"]]]
