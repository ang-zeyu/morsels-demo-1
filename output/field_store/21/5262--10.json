This sort of intrusion into my father's work as an author bore, in the  \"friend's\" language, the modest title of \"corrections beforehand,\" and  there is no doubt that Marya Alexandrovna was right, for no one will  ever know where what my father wrote ends and where his concessions to  Mr. ----'s persistent \"corrections beforehand\" begin, all the more as  this careful adviser had the forethought to arrange that when my father  answered his letters he was always to return him the letters they were  answers to.[25]    Besides the desire for death that my father displayed, in the last years  of his life he cherished another dream, which he made no secret of  his hope of realizing, and that was the desire to suffer for his  convictions. The first impulse in this direction was given him by  the persecution on the part of the authorities to which, during his  lifetime, many of his friends and fellow-thinkers were subjected.    When he heard of any one being put in jail or deported for disseminating  his writings, he was so disturbed about it that one was really sorry  for him. I remember my arrival at Yasnaya some days after Gusef's  arrest.[26] I stayed two days with my father, and heard of nothing but  Gusef. As if there were nobody in the world but Gusef! I must confess  that, sorry as I was for Gusef, who was shut up at the time in the local  prison at Krapivna, I harbored a most wicked feeling of resentment at  my father's paying so little attention to me and the rest of those about  him and being so absorbed in the thought of Gusef.    I willingly acknowledge that I was wrong in entertaining this  narrow-minded feeling. If I had entered fully into what my father was  feeling, I should have seen this at the time.    As far back as 1896, in consequence of the arrest of a doctor, Miss  N----, in Tula, my father wrote a long letter to Muravyof, the Minister  of Justice, in which he spoke of the \"unreasonableness, uselessness,  and cruelty of the measures taken by the Government against those who  disseminate these forbidden writings,\" and begged him to \"direct the  measures taken to punish or intimidate the perpetrators of the evil,  or to put an end to it, against the man whom you regard as the real  instigator of it... all the more, as I assure you beforehand, that I  shall continue without ceasing till my death to do what the Government  considers evil and what I consider my sacred duty before God.\"    As every one knows, neither this challenge nor the others that followed  it led to any result, and the arrests and deportations of those  associated with him still went on.    My father felt himself morally responsible toward all those who suffered  on his account, and every year new burdens were laid on his conscience.          MASHA'S DEATH    As I reach the description of the last days of my father's life, I must  once more make it clear that what I write is based only on the personal  impressions I received in my periodical visits to Yasnaya Polyana.    Unfortunately, I have no rich shorthand material to rely on, such as  Gusef and Bulgakof had for their memoirs, and more especially  Dushan Petrovitch Makowicki, who is preparing, I am told, a big and  conscientious work, full of truth and interest.    In November, 1906, my sister Masha died of inflammation of the lungs.  It is a curious thing that she vanished out of life with just as little  commotion as she had passed through it. Evidently this is the lot of all  the pure in heart.    No one was particularly astonished by her death. I remember that when I  received the telegram, I felt no surprise. It seemed perfectly natural  to me. Masha had married a kinsman of ours, Prince Obolenski; she lived  on her own estate at Pirogovo, twenty-one miles from us, and spent half  the year with her husband at Yasnaya. She was very delicate and had  constant illnesses.    When I arrived at Yasnaya the day after her death, I was aware of an  atmosphere of exaltation and prayerful emotion about the whole family,  and it was then I think for the first time that I realized the full  grandeur and beauty of death.    I definitely felt that by her death Masha, so far from having gone away  from us, had come nearer to us, and had been, as it were, welded to us  forever in a way that she never could have been during her lifetime.    I observed the same frame of mind in my father. He went about silent and  woebegone, summoning all his strength to battle with his own sorrow; but  I never heard him utter a murmur of a complaint, only words of tender  emotion. When the coffin was carried to the church he changed his  clothes and went with the cortege. When he reached the stone pillars  he stopped us, said farewell to the departed, and walked home along the  avenue. I looked after him and watched him walk away across the wet,  thawing snow with his short, quick old man's steps, turning his toes out  at a sharp angle, as he always did, and never once looking round.    My sister Masha had held a position of great importance in my father's  life and in the life of the whole family. Many a time in the last few  years have we had occasion to think of her and to murmur sadly: \"If only  Masha had been with us! If only Masha had not died!\"    In order to explain the relations between Masha and my father I must  turn back a considerable way. There was one distinguishing and, at first  sight, peculiar trait in my father's character, due perhaps to the fact  that he grew up without a mother, and that was that all exhibitions of  tenderness were entirely foreign to him.    I say \"tenderness\" in contradistinction to heartiness. Heartiness he had  and in a very high degree.    His description of the death of my Uncle Nikolai is characteristic in  this connection. In a letter to his other brother, Sergei Nikolayevitch,  in which he described the last day of his brother's life, my father  tells how he helped him to undress.    \"He submitted, and became a different man.... He had a word of praise  for everybody, and said to me, 'Thanks, my friend.' You understand the  significance of the words as between us two.\"    It is evident that in the language of the Tolstoy brothers the phrase  \"my friend\" was an expression of tenderness beyond which imagination  could not go. The words astonished my father even on the lips of his  dying brother.    During all his lifetime I never received any mark of tenderness from him  whatever.    He was not fond of kissing children, and when he did so in saying good  morning or good night, he did it merely as a duty.    It is therefore easy to understand that he did not provoke any display  of tenderness toward himself, and that nearness and dearness with him  were never accompanied by any outward manifestations.    It would never have come into my head, for instance, to walk up to my  father and kiss him or to stroke his hand. I was partly prevented also  from that by the fact that I always looked up to him with awe, and his  spiritual power, his greatness, prevented me from seeing in him the mere  man--the man who was so plaintive and weary at times, the feeble old man  who so much needed warmth and rest.    The only person who could give him that warmth was Masha.    She would go up to him, stroke his hand, caress him, and say something  affectionate, and you could see that he liked it, was happy, and even  responded in kind. It was as if he became a different man with her. Why  was it that Masha was able to do this, while no one else even dared to  try? If any other of us had done it, it would have seemed unnatural, but  Masha could do it with perfect simplicity and sincerity.    I do not mean to say that others about my father loved him less than  Masha; not at all; but the display of love for him was never so warm and  at the same time so natural with any one else as with her.    So that with Masha's death my father was deprived of this natural source  of warmth, which, with advancing years, had become more and more of a  necessity for him.    Another and still greater power that she possessed was her remarkably  delicate and sensitive conscience. This trait in her was still dearer to  my father than her caresses.    How good she was at smoothing away all misunderstandings! How she always  stood up for those who were found any fault with, justly or unjustly! It  was all the same to her. Masha could reconcile everybody and everything.    During the last years of his life my father's health perceptibly grew  worse. Several times he had the most sudden and inexplicable sort  of fainting fits, from which he used to recover the next day, but  completely lost his memory for a time.    Seeing my brother Andrei's children, who were staying at Yasnaya, in the  zala one day, he asked with some surprise, \"Whose children are these?\"  Meeting my wife, he said, \"Don't be offended, my dear; I know that I am  very fond of you, but I have quite forgotten who you are\"; and when he  went up to the zala after one of these fainting fits, he looked round  with an astonished air and said, \"Where's my brother Nitenka.\" Nitenka  had died fifty years before.    The day following all traces of the attack would disappear.    During one of these fainting fits my brother Sergei, in undressing my  father, found a little note-book on him. He put it in his own pocket,  and next day, when he came to see my father, he handed it back to him,  telling him that he had not read it.    \"There would have been no harm in YOUR seeing it,\" said my father, as"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/8159"],[0,"Wanderings in South America (#12)"],[1,"vera VM. que yo no escribo Portugues ni aun lo hablo, pero, haviendo  aprendido el Castellano, no nos faltara medio de communicar y tener  conversacion.

Kind and gentle reader, if the journey in quest of the wourali poison  has engaged thy attention, probably thou mayest recollect that the  traveller took leave of thee at Fort St. Joachim, on the Rio Branco.  Shouldest thou wish to know what befell him afterwards, excuse the  following uninteresting narrative.    Having had a return of fever, and aware that the farther he advanced  into these wild and lonely regions the less would be the chance of  regaining his health, he gave up all idea of proceeding onwards, and  went slowly back towards the Demerara, nearly by the same route he had  come.    On descending the falls in the Essequibo, which form an oblique line  quite across the river, it was resolved to push through them, the  downward stream being in the canoe's favour. At a little distance from  the place a large tree had fallen into the river, and in the meantime  the canoe was lashed to one of its branches.    The roaring of the water was dreadful: it foamed and dashed over the  rocks with a tremendous spray, like breakers on a lee-shore,  threatening destruction to whatever approached it. You would have  thought, by the confusion it caused in the river and the whirlpools it  made, that Scylla and Charybdis, and their whole progeny, had left the  Mediterranean and come and settled here. The channel was barely twelve  feet wide, and the torrent in rushing down formed traverse furrows  which showed how near the rocks were to the surface.    Nothing could surpass the skill of the Indian who steered the canoe. He  looked steadfastly at it, then at the rocks, then cast an eye on the  channel, and then looked at the canoe again. It was in vain to speak.  The sound was lost in the roar of waters, but his eye showed that he  had already passed it in imagination. He held up his paddle in a  position as much as to say that he would keep exactly amid channel, and  then made a sign to cut the bush-rope that held the canoe to the fallen  tree. The canoe drove down the torrent with inconceivable rapidity. It  did not touch the rocks once all the way. The Indian proved to a  nicety: \"medio tutissimus ibis.\"    Shortly after this it rained almost day and night, the lightning  flashing incessantly and the roar of thunder awful beyond expression.    The fever returned, and pressed so heavy on him that to all appearance  his last day's march was over. However, it abated, his spirits rallied,  and he marched again; and after delays and inconveniences he reached  the house of his worthy friend Mr. Edmonstone, in Mibiri Creek, which  falls into the Demerara. No words of his can do justice to the  hospitality of that gentleman, whose repeated encounters with the  hostile negroes in the forest have been publicly rewarded and will be  remembered in the colony for years to come.    Here he learned that an eruption had taken place in St. Vincent's, and  thus the noise heard in the night of the first of May, which had caused  such terror amongst the Indians and made the garrison at Fort St.  Joachim remain under arms the rest of the night, is accounted for.    After experiencing every kindness and attention from Mr. Edmonstone he  sailed for Granada, and from thence to St. Thomas's, a few days before  poor Captain Peake lost his life on his own quarter-deck bravely  fighting for his country on the coast of Guiana.    At St. Thomas's they show you a tower, a little distance from the town,  which they say formerly belonged to a bucanier chieftain. Probably the  fury of besiegers has reduced it to its present dismantled state. What  still remains of it bears testimony of its former strength and may  brave the attack of time for centuries. You cannot view its ruins  without calling to mind the exploits of those fierce and hardy hunters,  long the terror of the Western world. While you admire their undaunted  courage, you lament that it was often stained with cruelty; while you  extol their scrupulous justice to each other, you will find a want of  it towards the rest of mankind. Often possessed of enormous wealth,  often in extreme poverty, often triumphant on the ocean and often  forced to fly to the forests, their life was an ever-changing scene of  advance and retreat, of glory and disorder, of luxury and famine. Spain  treated them as outlaws and pirates, while other European powers  publicly disowned them. They, on the other hand, maintained that  injustice on the part of Spain first forced them to take up arms in  self-defence, and that, whilst they kept inviolable the laws which they  had framed for their own common benefit and protection, they had a  right to consider as foes those who treated them as outlaws. Under this  impression they drew the sword and rushed on as though in lawful war,  and divided the spoils of victory in the scale of justice.    After leaving St. Thomas's, a severe tertian ague every now and then  kept putting the traveller in mind that his shattered frame, \"starting  and shivering in the inconstant blast, meagre and pale, the ghost of  what it was,\" wanted repairs. Three years elapsed after arriving in  England before the ague took its final leave of him.    During that time, several experiments were made with the wourali  poison. In London an ass was inoculated with it and died in twelve  minutes. The poison was inserted into the leg of another, round which a  bandage had been previously tied a little above the place where the  wourali was introduced. He walked about as usual and ate his food as  though all were right. After an hour had elapsed the bandage was  untied, and ten minutes after death overtook him.    A she-ass received the wourali poison in the shoulder, and died  apparently in ten minutes. An incision was then made in its windpipe  and through it the lungs were regularly inflated for two hours with a  pair of bellows. Suspended animation returned. The ass held up her head  and looked around, but the inflating being discontinued she sunk once  more in apparent death. The artificial breathing was immediately  recommenced, and continued without intermission for two hours more.  This saved the ass from final dissolution: she rose up and walked  about; she seemed neither in agitation nor in pain. The wound through  which the poison entered was healed without difficulty. Her  constitution, however, was so severely affected that it was long a  doubt if ever she would be well again. She looked lean and sickly for  above a year, but began to mend the spring after, and by midsummer  became fat and frisky.    The kind-hearted reader will rejoice on learning that Earl Percy,  pitying her misfortunes, sent her down from London to Walton Hall, near  Wakefield. There she goes by the name of Wouralia. Wouralia shall be  sheltered from the wintry storm; and when summer comes she shall feed  in the finest pasture. No burden shall be placed upon her, and she  shall end her days in peace.    For three revolving autumns, the ague-beaten wanderer never saw without  a sigh the swallow bend her flight towards warmer regions. He wished to  go too, but could not for sickness had enfeebled him, and prudence  pointed out the folly of roving again too soon across the northern  tropic. To be sure, the Continent was now open, and change of air might  prove beneficial, but there was nothing very tempting in a trip across  the Channel, and as for a tour through England!--England has long  ceased to be the land for adventures. Indeed, when good King Arthur  reappears to claim his crown, he will find things strangely altered  here; and may we not look for his coming? for there is written upon his  gravestone:      Hic jacet Arturus, Rex quondam Rexque futurus.      Here Arthur lies, who formerly    Was king--and king again to be.    Don Quixote was always of opinion that this famous king did not die,  but that he was changed into a raven by enchantment and that the  English are momentarily expecting his return. Be this as it may, it is  certain that when he reigned here all was harmony and joy. The browsing  herds passed from vale to vale, the swains sang from the  bluebell-teeming groves, and nymphs, with eglantine and roses in their  neatly-braided hair, went hand in hand to the flowery mead to weave  garlands for their lambkins. If by chance some rude, uncivil fellow  dared to molest them, or attempted to throw thorns in their path, there  was sure to be a knight-errant not far off ready to rush forward in  their defence. But alas! in these degenerate days it is not so. Should  a harmless cottage-maid wander out of the highway to pluck a primrose  or two in the neighbouring field, the haughty owner sternly bids her  retire; and if a pitying swain hasten to escort her back, he is perhaps  seized by the gaunt house-dog ere he reach her!    AEneas's route on the other side of Styx could not have been much worse  than this, though, by his account, when he got back to earth, it  appears that he had fallen in with \"Bellua Lernae, horrendum stridens,  flammisque, armata Chimaera.\"    Moreover, he had a sibyl to guide his steps; and as such a conductress  nowadays could not be got for love or money, it was judged most prudent  to refrain from sauntering through this land of freedom, and wait with  patience the return of health. At last this long-looked-for,  ever-welcome stranger came.
