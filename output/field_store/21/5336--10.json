At last, and whilst it was still dark, we came to the end of our fuel,  and as the fire died down, so did the noises in the valley recommence.  And there we stood in the growing dark, each one keeping a very ready  weapon, and a more ready glance. And at times the island would be  mightily quiet, and then again the sounds of things crawling in the  valley. Yet, I think the silences tried us the more.    And so at last came the dawn.          IX    What Happened in the Dusk      Now with the coming of the dawn, a lasting silence stole across the  island and into the valley, and, conceiving that we had nothing more to  fear, the bo'sun bade us get some rest, whilst he kept watch. And so I  got at last a very substantial little spell of sleep, which made me fit  enough for the day's work.    Presently, after some hours had passed, the bo'sun roused us to go  with him to the further side of the island to gather fuel, and soon we  were back with each a load, so that in a little we had the fire going  right merrily.    Now for breakfast, we had a hash of broken biscuit, salt meat and some  shell-fish which the bo'sun had picked up from the beach at the foot of  the further hill; the whole being right liberally flavored with some of  the vinegar, which the bo'sun said would help keep down any scurvy that  might be threatening us. And at the end of the meal he served out to us  each a little of the molasses, which we mixed with hot water, and drank.    The meal being ended, he went into the tent to take a look at Job, the  which he had done already in the early morning; for the condition of the  lad preyed somewhat upon him; he being, for all his size and  top-roughness, a man of surprisingly tender heart. Yet the boy remained  much as on the previous evening, so that we knew not what to do with him  to bring him into better health. One thing we tried, knowing that no food  had passed his lips since the previous morning, and that was to get some  little quantity of hot water, rum and molasses down his throat; for it  seemed to us he might die from very lack of food; but though we worked  with him for more than the half of an hour, we could not get him to  come-to sufficiently to take anything, and without that we had fear of  suffocating him. And so, presently, we had perforce to leave him within  the tent, and go about our business; for there was very much to be done.    Yet, before we did aught else, the bo'sun led us all into the valley,  being determined to make a very thorough exploration of it, perchance  there might be any lurking beast or devil-thing waiting to rush out and  destroy us as we worked, and more, he would make search that he might  discover what manner of creatures had disturbed our night.    Now in the early morning, when we had gone for the fuel, we had kept to  the upper skirt of the valley where the rock of the nearer hill came down  into the spongy ground, but now we struck right down into the middle part  of the vale, making a way amid the mighty fungi to the pit-like opening  that filled the bottom of the valley. Now though the ground was very  soft, there was in it so much of springiness that it left no trace of our  steps after we had gone on a little way, none, that is, save that in odd  places, a wet patch followed upon our treading. Then, when we got  ourselves near to the pit, the ground became softer, so that our feet  sank into it, and left very real impressions; and here we found tracks  most curious and bewildering; for amid the slush that edged the  pit--which I would mention here had less the look of a pit now that I had  come near to it--were multitudes of markings which I can liken to nothing  so much as the tracks of mighty slugs amid the mud, only that they were  not altogether like to that of slugs; for there were other markings such  as might have been made by bunches of eels cast down and picked up  continually, at least, this is what they suggested to me, and I do but  put it down as such.    Apart from the markings which I have mentioned, there was everywhere a  deal of slime, and this we traced all over the valley among the great  toadstool plants; but, beyond that which I have already remarked, we  found nothing. Nay, but I was near to forgetting, we found a quantity of  this thin slime upon those fungi which filled the end of the little  valley nearest to our encampment, and here also we discovered many of  them fresh broken or uprooted, and there was the same mark of the beast  upon them all, and now I remember the dull thuds that I had heard in the  night, and made little doubt but that the creatures had climbed the great  toadstools so that they might spy us out; and it may be that many climbed  upon one, so that their weight broke the fungi, or uprooted them. At  least, so the thought came to me.    And so we made an end of our search, and after that, the bo'sun set each  one of us to work. But first he had us all back to the beach to give a  hand to turn over the boat, so that he might get to the damaged part.  Now, having the bottom of the boat full to his view, he made discovery  that there was other damage beside that of the burst plank; for the  bottom plank of all had come away from the keel, which seemed to us a  very serious matter; though it did not show when the boat was upon her  bilges. Yet the bo'sun assured us that he had no doubts but that she  could be made seaworthy, though it would take a greater while than  hitherto he had thought needful.    Having concluded his examination of the boat, the bo'sun sent one of the  men to bring the bottom-boards out of the tent; for he needed some  planking for the repair of the damage. Yet when the boards had been  brought, he needed still something which they could not supply, and this  was a length of very sound wood of some three inches in breadth each  way, which he intended to bolt against the starboard side of the keel,  after he had gotten the planking replaced so far as was possible. He had  hopes that by means of this device he would be able to nail the bottom  plank to this, and then caulk it with oakum, so making the boat almost  so sound as ever.    Now hearing him express his need for such a piece of timber, we were all  adrift to know from whence such a thing could be gotten, until there came  suddenly to me a memory of the mast and topmast upon the other side of  the island, and at once I made mention of them. At that, the bo'sun  nodded, saying that we might get the timber out of it, though it would be  a work requiring some considerable labor, in that we had only a hand-saw  and a small hatchet. Then he sent us across to be getting it clear of the  weed, promising to follow when he had made an end of trying to get the  two displaced planks back into position.    Having reached the spars, we set-to with a very good will to shift away  the weed and wrack that was piled over them, and very much entangled with  the rigging. Presently we had laid them bare, and so we discovered them  to be in remarkably sound condition, the lower-mast especially being a  fine piece of timber. All the lower and topmast standing rigging was  still attached, though in places the lower rigging was stranded so far as  half-way up the shrouds; yet there remained much that was good and all  of it quite free from rot, and of the very finest quality of white hemp,  such as is to be seen only in the best found vessels.    About the time that we had finished clearing the weed, the bo'sun came  over to us, bringing with him the saw and the hatchet. Under his  directions, we cut the lanyards of the topmast rigging, and after that  sawed through the topmast just above the cap. Now this was a very tough  piece of work, and employed us a great part of the morning, even though  we took turn and turn at the saw, and when it was done we were mightily  glad that the bo'sun bade one of the men go over with some weed and make  up the fire for dinner, after which he was to put on a piece of the salt  meat to boil.    In the meanwhile, the bo'sun had started to cut through the topmast,  about fifteen feet beyond the first cut, for that was the length of the  batten he required; yet so wearisome was the work, that we had not gotten  more than half through with it before the man whom the bo'sun had sent,  returned to say that the dinner was ready. When this was dispatched, and  we had rested a little over our pipes, the bo'sun rose and led us back;  for he was determined to get through with the topmast before dark.    Presently, relieving each other frequently, we completed the second  cut, and after that the bo'sun set us to saw a block about twelve  inches deep from the remaining portion of the topmast. From this, when  we had cut it, he proceeded to hew wedges with the hatchet. Then he  notched the end of the fifteen-foot log, and into the notch he drove  the wedges, and so, towards evening, as much, maybe, by good luck as  good management, he had divided the log into two halves--the split  running very fairly down the center.    Now, perceiving how that it drew near to sundown, he bade the men haste  and gather weed and carry it across to our camp; but one he sent along  the shore to make a search for shell-fish among the weed; yet he himself  ceased not to work at the divided log, and kept me with him as helper.  Thus, within the next hour, we had a length, maybe some four inches in  diameter, split off the whole length of one of the halves, and with this  he was very well content; though it seemed but a very little result for  so much labor.    By this time the dusk was upon us, and the men, having made an end of  weed carrying, were returned to us, and stood about, waiting for the  bo'sun to go into camp. At this moment, the man the bo'sun had sent to  gather shellfish, returned, and he had a great crab upon his spear, which  he had spitted through the belly.

Let it go. If you want to give my butler a laugh, what  does it matter? What does anything matter now?\"    There was a death-where-is-thy-sting-fullness about her manner which I  found distasteful. It isn't often that I score off Jeeves in the  devastating fashion just described, and when I do I like to see happy,  smiling faces about me.    \"Tails up, Aunt Dahlia,\" I urged buoyantly.    \"Tails up be dashed,\" was her sombre response. \"I've just been talking to  Tom.\"    \"Telling him?\"    \"No, listening to him. I haven't had the nerve to tell him yet.\"    \"Is he still upset about that income-tax money?\"    \"Upset is right. He says that Civilisation is in the melting-pot and that  all thinking men can read the writing on the wall.\"    \"What wall?\"    \"Old Testament, ass. Belshazzar's feast.\"    \"Oh, that, yes. I've often wondered how that gag was worked. With  mirrors, I expect.\"    \"I wish I could use mirrors to break it to Tom about this baccarat  business.\"    I had a word of comfort to offer here. I had been turning the thing over  in my mind since our last meeting, and I thought I saw where she had got  twisted. Where she made her error, it seemed to me, was in feeling she  had got to tell Uncle Tom. To my way of thinking, the matter was one on  which it would be better to continue to exercise a quiet reserve.    \"I don't see why you need mention that you lost that money at baccarat.\"    \"What do you suggest, then? Letting _Milady's Boudoir_ join Civilisation  in the melting-pot. Because that is what it will infallibly do unless I  get a cheque by next week. The printers have been showing a nasty spirit  for months.\"    \"You don't follow. Listen. It's an understood thing, I take it, that  Uncle Tom foots the _Boudoir_ bills. If the bally sheet has been turning  the corner for two years, he must have got used to forking out by this  time. Well, simply ask him for the money to pay the printers.\"    \"I did. Just before I went to Cannes.\"    \"Wouldn't he give it to you?\"    \"Certainly he gave it to me. He brassed up like an officer and a  gentleman. That was the money I lost at baccarat.\"    \"Oh? I didn't know that.\"    \"There isn't much you do know.\"    A nephew's love made me overlook the slur.    \"Tut!\" I said.    \"What did you say?\"    \"I said 'Tut!'\"    \"Say it once again, and I'll biff you where you stand. I've enough to  endure without being tutted at.\"    \"Quite.\"    \"Any tutting that's required, I'll attend to myself. And the same applies  to clicking the tongue, if you were thinking of doing that.\"    \"Far from it.\"    \"Good.\"    I stood awhile in thought. I was concerned to the core. My heart, if you  remember, had already bled once for Aunt Dahlia this evening. It now bled  again. I knew how deeply attached she was to this paper of hers. Seeing  it go down the drain would be for her like watching a loved child sink  for the third time in some pond or mere.    And there was no question that, unless carefully prepared for the touch,  Uncle Tom would see a hundred _Milady's Boudoirs_ go phut rather than  take the rap.    Then I saw how the thing could be handled. This aunt, I perceived, must  fall into line with my other clients. Tuppy Glossop was knocking off  dinner to melt Angela. Gussie Fink-Nottle was knocking off dinner to  impress the Bassett. Aunt Dahlia must knock off dinner to soften Uncle  Tom. For the beauty of this scheme of mine was that there was no limit to  the number of entrants. Come one, come all, the more the merrier, and  satisfaction guaranteed in every case.    \"I've got it,\" I said. \"There is only one course to pursue. Eat less  meat.\"    She looked at me in a pleading sort of way. I wouldn't swear that her  eyes were wet with unshed tears, but I rather think they were, certainly  she clasped her hands in piteous appeal.    \"Must you drivel, Bertie? Won't you stop it just this once? Just for  tonight, to please Aunt Dahlia?\"    \"I'm not drivelling.\"    \"I dare say that to a man of your high standards it doesn't come under  the head of drivel, but----\"    I saw what had happened. I hadn't made myself quite clear.    \"It's all right,\" I said. \"Have no misgivings. This is the real Tabasco.  When I said 'Eat less meat', what I meant was that you must refuse your  oats at dinner tonight. Just sit there, looking blistered, and wave away  each course as it comes with a weary gesture of resignation. You see what  will happen. Uncle Tom will notice your loss of appetite, and I am  prepared to bet that at the conclusion of the meal he will come to you  and say 'Dahlia, darling'--I take it he calls you 'Dahlia'--'Dahlia  darling,' he will say, 'I noticed at dinner tonight that you were a bit  off your feed. Is anything the matter, Dahlia, darling?' 'Why, yes, Tom,  darling,' you will reply. 'It is kind of you to ask, darling. The fact  is, darling, I am terribly worried.' 'My darling,' he will say----\"    Aunt Dahlia interrupted at this point to observe that these Traverses  seemed to be a pretty soppy couple of blighters, to judge by their  dialogue. She also wished to know when I was going to get to the point.    I gave her a look.    \"'My darling,' he will say tenderly, 'is there anything I can do?' To  which your reply will be that there jolly well is--viz. reach for his  cheque-book and start writing.\"    I was watching her closely as I spoke, and was pleased to note respect  suddenly dawn in her eyes.    \"But, Bertie, this is positively bright.\"    \"I told you Jeeves wasn't the only fellow with brain.\"    \"I believe it would work.\"    \"It's bound to work. I've recommended it to Tuppy.\"    \"Young Glossop?\"    \"In order to soften Angela.\"    \"Splendid!\"    \"And to Gussie Fink-Nottle, who wants to make a hit with the Bassett.\"    \"Well, well, well! What a busy little brain it is.\"    \"Always working, Aunt Dahlia, always working.\"    \"You're not the chump I took you for, Bertie.\"    \"When did you ever take me for a chump?\"    \"Oh, some time last summer. I forget what gave me the idea. Yes, Bertie,  this scheme is bright. I suppose, as a matter of fact, Jeeves suggested  it.\"    \"Jeeves did not suggest it. I resent these implications. Jeeves had  nothing to do with it whatsoever.\"    \"Well, all right, no need to get excited about it. Yes, I think it will  work. Tom's devoted to me.\"    \"Who wouldn't be?\"    \"I'll do it.\"    And then the rest of the party trickled in, and we toddled down to  dinner.    Conditions being as they were at Brinkley Court--I mean to say, the place  being loaded down above the Plimsoll mark with aching hearts and standing  room only as regarded tortured souls--I hadn't expected the evening meal  to be particularly effervescent. Nor was it. Silent. Sombre. The whole  thing more than a bit like Christmas dinner on Devil's Island.    I was glad when it was over.    What with having, on top of her other troubles, to rein herself back from  the trough, Aunt Dahlia was a total loss as far as anything in the shape  of brilliant badinage was concerned. The fact that he was fifty quid in  the red and expecting Civilisation to take a toss at any moment had  caused Uncle Tom, who always looked a bit like a pterodactyl with a  secret sorrow, to take on a deeper melancholy. The Bassett was a silent  bread crumbler. Angela might have been hewn from the living rock. Tuppy  had the air of a condemned murderer refusing to make the usual hearty  breakfast before tooling off to the execution shed.    And as for Gussie Fink-Nottle, many an experienced undertaker would have  been deceived by his appearance and started embalming him on sight.    This was the first glimpse I had had of Gussie since we parted at my  flat, and I must say his demeanour disappointed me. I had been expecting  something a great deal more sparkling.    At my flat, on the occasion alluded to, he had, if you recall,  practically given me a signed guarantee that all he needed to touch him  off was a rural setting. Yet in this aspect now I could detect no  indication whatsoever that he was about to round into mid-season form. He  still looked like a cat in an adage, and it did not take me long to  realise that my very first act on escaping from this morgue must be to  draw him aside and give him a pep talk.    If ever a chap wanted the clarion note, it looked as if it was this  Fink-Nottle.    In the general exodus of mourners, however, I lost sight of him, and,  owing to the fact that Aunt Dahlia roped me in for a game of backgammon,  it was not immediately that I was able to institute a search. But after  we had been playing for a while, the butler came in and asked her if she  would speak to Anatole, so I managed to get away. And some ten minutes  later, having failed to find scent in the house, I started to throw out  the drag-net through the grounds, and flushed him in the rose garden.    He was smelling a rose at the moment in a limp sort of way, but removed  the beak as I approached.    \"Well, Gussie,\" I said.    I had beamed genially upon him as I spoke, such being my customary policy  on meeting an old pal; but instead of beaming back genially, he gave me a  most unpleasant look. His attitude perplexed me. It was as if he were not  glad to see Bertram. For a moment he stood letting this unpleasant look  play upon me, as it were, and then he spoke.    \"You and your 'Well, Gussie'!\"    He said this between clenched teeth, always an unmatey thing to do, and I  found myself more fogged than ever.    \"How do you mean--me and my 'Well, Gussie'?\"    \"I like your nerve, coming bounding about the place, saying 'Well,  Gussie.' That's about all the 'Well, Gussie' I shall require from you,  Wooster. And it's no good looking like that. You know what I mean. That"]]]
