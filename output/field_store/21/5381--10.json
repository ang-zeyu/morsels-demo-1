So Migwan accomplished her  own ends and gave the Winnebagos a new opportunity to pursue knowledge  at the same time.    At Christmas time she had also fallen back on her ingenuity to produce  the gifts she wished to give. There was no money at all to be spent for  this purpose. Migwan took a careful stock of the resources of the house.  The only promising thing she found was a leather skin which Hinpoha had  given her the summer before for helping her write up the weekly Count in  Hiawatha meter, which was outside of Hinpoha's range of talents. She  considered the possibilities of that skin carefully. It must yield seven  articles--a present for each of the Winnebagos. She decided on book  covers. She wrote up seven different incidents of the summer camping  trip in verse and copied them with the typewriter on rough yellow  drawing paper, thinking to decorate each sheet. But Migwan had little  artistic ability and soon saw that her decorations were not beautiful  enough to adorn Christmas gifts. After spoiling several pages she gave  up in disgust and threw the spoiled pages into the grate. The next  morning she was cleaning out the grate and found the pieces of paper,  only partially burned around the edges. She suddenly had an idea. The  fire had burned a neat and artistic brown border around the writing. Why  not burn all her sheets around the edges? Accordingly she set to work  with a candle, and in a short time had her pages decorated in an odd and  original way which could not fail to appeal to a Camp Fire Girl. Then  she pasted the irregular pieces of yellow paper on straight pages of  heavy brown paper, which brought out the burned edges beautifully. On  the cover of each book she painted the symbol of the girl for whom it  was intended, and on the inside of the back cover she painted her own.  The Winnebagos were delighted with the books and took greater pride in  showing them to their friends than they did their more expensive  presents.    That piece of ingenuity was bread cast on the water for Migwan. Nyoda  came to her one day while she was working her head off on the  typewriter. \"Could the authoress be persuaded to desist from her labors  for a while?\" she asked, tiptoeing around the room in a ridiculous  effort to be quiet, which convulsed Migwan.    \"Speak,\" said Migwan. \"Your wish is already granted.\"    Nyoda sat down. \"You remember that cunning little book you made me for  Christmas?\" she asked. Migwan nodded. \"Well,\" continued Nyoda, \"I was  showing it to Professor Green the other night and he was quite carried  away with it. He has a quantity of notes he took on a hunting trip last  fall and wants to know if you will make them into a book like that for  him. There will be quite a bit of work connected with it, as all the  material will have to be copied on the typewriter and arranged in good  order, and he is willing to pay two and a half dollars for your  services. Would you be willing to do it?\"    Would she be willing to do it? Would she see two and a half dollars  lying in the street and not pick it up? The professor's notes were  speedily secured and she set to work happily to transform them into an  artistic record book. Her sister Betty grumbled a good deal these days  because she was asked to do so much of the housework. Before Migwan took  to typewriting at night Betty had been in the habit of staying out of  the house until supper was ready, and then getting up from the table and  going out again immediately, leaving Migwan to get supper and wash the  dishes. It was easier to do the work herself than to argue with Betty  about it, and if she appealed to her mother Mrs. Gardiner always said,  \"Just leave the dishes and I'll do them alone,\" so rather than have her  mother do them Migwan generally washed and wiped them alone. But now  that she was working so hard she needed the whole afternoon to get her  lessons in, and insisted that Betty should help get supper and wipe  dishes afterwards. For once Mrs. Gardiner took sides with Migwan and  commanded Betty to do her share of the work. In consequence Betty  developed a fierce resentment against Migwan's literary efforts, and  taunted her continually with her failure to make anything of it. Since  she had been working on Professor Green's book Migwan had done nothing  at all in the house, and her usual Saturday work fell to Betty.    Mrs. Gardiner was not feeling well of late, and could do no sweeping, so  Betty found herself with a good day's work ahead of her one Saturday  morning. Instead of playing that the dirt was a host of evil sprits, as  Migwan did, which she could vanquish with the aid of her magic broom,  Betty went at it sullenly and with a firm determination to do as little  as possible and get through just as quickly as she could. She made up  her mind that when Migwan went to market in the afternoon she would go  along with her in the automobile. So by going hastily over the surface  of things she got through by three o'clock, and when Gladys called for  Migwan, Betty came running out too, with her coat and hat on, dressed in  her best dress.    \"Where are you going?\" asked Migwan.    \"Along with you,\" answered Betty.    \"I'm afraid we can't take you,\" said Migwan; \"there isn't enough room.\"    \"Oh, I'll squeeze in,\" said Betty lightly. Now seven girls with market  baskets in addition to the driver are somewhat of a crowd, and there  really was no room for Betty in the machine. Besides, Betty was a great  tease and the girls dreaded to have her with them, so no one said a word  of encouragement.    \"You can't come, and that is all there is to it,\" said Migwan rather  crossly. She was in a hurry to be off and get the marketing done. Betty  stamped her foot, and snatching Migwan's market basket, she ran around  the corner of the house with it. Migwan ran after her, and forcibly  recovering the basket, hit Betty over the head with it several times.  Then she jumped into the automobile and the driver started off, leaving  Betty standing looking after the rapidly disappearing car and working  herself into a terrible temper. She ran into the house and slammed the  door with such a jar that the vases on the mantel rattled and threatened  to fall down. She threw her hat and coat on the floor and stamped on  them in a perfect fury. On the sitting room table lay the pages of the  book which Migwan was making for Professor Green. The edges were already  burned and they were ready to be pasted on the brown mat. Betty's eyes  suddenly snapped when she saw them. Here was a fine chance to be  revenged on Migwan. With an exclamation of triumph she seized the  leaves, tore them in half and threw them into the grate, standing by  until they were consumed to ashes, and laughing spitefully the while.    Migwan came in briskly with her basket of provisions. Betty looked up  slyly from the book she was reading, but said not a word. Migwan went  into the sitting room and Betty heard her moving around. \"Mother,\"  called Migwan up the stairway, \"where did you put the pages of my book?  I left them on the sitting room table.\"      \"I didn't touch them,\" replied her mother; \"I haven't been downstairs  since you went out.\"    \"Betty,\" said Migwan sternly, \"did you hide my work?\" Betty laughed  mockingly, but made no reply. \"Make haste and give them back,\" commanded  Migwan. \"I have no time to waste.\"    Betty still maintained a provoking silence and Migwan began looking  through the table drawers for the missing leaves. Betty watched her with  malicious glee. \"You may look a while before you find them,\" she said  meaningly; \"they're hidden in a nice, safe place.\"    Migwan stood and faced her, exasperated beyond endurance. \"Betty  Gardiner,\" she said angrily, \"stop this nonsense at once and tell me  where those pages are!\"    \"Well, if you're really curious to know,\" answered Betty, smiling  wickedly, \"I'll tell you. They're _there_\" and she pointed to the grate.    \"Betty,\" gasped Migwan, turning white, \"you don't mean that you've  burned them?\"    \"That's what I do mean,\" said Betty coolly. \"I'll show you if you can  treat me like a baby.\"    Migwan stood as if turned to stone. She could hardly believe that those  fair pages, which represented so many hours of patient work, had been  swept away in one moment of passion. Blindly she turned, and putting on  her wraps, walked from the house without a word. It seemed to her that  Fate had decreed that nothing which she undertook should succeed.  Discouragement settled down on her like a black pall. With the ability  to do things which should set her above her fellows, she was being  relentlessly pursued by some strange fatality which marked every effort  of hers a failure. She walked aimlessly up street after street without  any idea where she was going, entirely oblivious to her surroundings.  Wandering thus, she discovered that she was in the park, and had come  out on the high bluff of the lake. She stood moodily looking down at the  vast field of ice that such a short time before had been tossing waves.  The lake, to all appearances, was frozen solid out as far as the  one-mile crib. There was a curious stillness in the air, as when the  clock had stopped, due to the absence of the noise made by the waves  dashing on the rocks. Nothing had ever appealed so to Migwan as did the  absolute silence and solitude of that frozen lake. Her bruised young  spirit was weary of contact with people, and found balm in this icy  desert where there was so sound of a human voice. As far as the eye  could see there was not a living being in sight. A skating carnival in  the other end of the park drew the attention of all who were abroad on  this Saturday afternoon, and kept them away from the lake front.      A desire to be enveloped in this solitude came over Migwan; to get her  feet off the earth altogether. She half slid and half climbed down the  cliff and walked out on the ice. Before her "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/11734"],[0,"Scientific American Supplement, No. 460, October 25, 1884 (#13)"],[1," and beginning of this  century, and find Rumford's conclusion regarding the heat generated in  boring a brass gun: \"It appears to me to be extremely difficult, if not  quite impossible, to form any distinct idea of anything capable of being  excited and communicated in the manner the heat was excited and  communicated in these experiments, except it be MOTION;\" and Davy's still  more suggestive statements: \"The phenomena of repulsion are not dependent  on a peculiar elastic fluid for their existence.\" ... \"Heat may be defined  as a peculiar motion, probably a vibration, of the corpuscles of bodies,  tending to separate them.\" ... \"To distinguish this motion from others, and  to signify the causes of our sensations of heat, etc., the name _repulsive_  motion has been adopted.\" Here we have a most important idea. It would be  somewhat a bold figure of speech to say the earth and moon are kept apart  by a repulsive motion; and yet, after all, what is centrifugal force but a  repulsive motion, and may it not be that there is no such thing as  repulsion, and that it is solely by inertia that what seems to be repulsion  is produced? Two bodies fly together, and, accelerated by mutual  attraction, if they do not precisely hit one another, they cannot but  separate in virtue of the inertia of their masses. So, after dashing past  one another in sharply concave curves round their common center of gravity,  they fly asunder again. A careless onlooker might imagine they had repelled  one another, and might not notice the difference between what he actually  sees and what he would see if the two bodies had been projected with great  velocity toward one another, and either colliding and rebounding, or  repelling one another into sharply convex continuous curves, fly asunder  again.    Joule, Clausius, and Maxwell, and no doubt Daniel Bernoulli himself, and I  believe every one who has hitherto written or done anything very explicit  in the kinetic theory of gases, has taken the mutual action of molecules in  collision as repulsive. May it not after all be attractive? This idea has  never left my mind since I first read Davy's \"Repulsive Motion,\" about  thirty-five years ago, and I never made anything of it, at all events have  not done so until to-day (June 16, 1884)--if this can be said to be making  anything of it--when, in endeavoring to prepare the present address, I  notice that Joule's and my own old experiments[1] on the thermal effect of  gases expanding from a high-pressure vessel through a porous plug, proves  the less dense gas to have greater intrinsic _potential_ energy than the  denser gas, if we assume the ordinary hypothesis regarding the temperature  of a gas, according to which two gases are of equal temperatures [2] when  the kinetic energies of their constituent molecules are of equal average  amounts per molecule.    [Footnote 1: Republished in Sir W. Thomson's \"Mathematical and Physical  Papers,\" vol. i., article xlix., p. 381. ]    [Footnote 2: That this is a mere hypothesis has been scarcely remarked by  the founders themselves, nor by almost any writer on the kinetic theory of  gases. No one has yet examined the question, What is the condition as  regards average distribution of kinetic energy, which is ultimately  fulfilled by two portions of gaseous matter, separated by a thin elastic  septum which absolutely prevents interdiffusion of matter, while it allows  interchange of kinetic energy by collisions against itself? Indeed, I do  not know but, that the present is the very first statement which has ever  been published of this condition of the problem of equal temperatures  between two gaseous masses.]    Think of the thing thus. Imagine a great multitude of particles inclosed by  a boundary which may be pushed inward in any part all round at pleasure.  Now station an engineer corps of Maxwell's army of sorting demons all round  the inclosure, with orders to push in the boundary diligently everywhere,  when none of the besieged troops are near, and to do nothing when any of  them are seen approaching, and until after they have turned again inward.  The result will be that, with exactly the same sum of kinetic and potential  energies of the same inclosed multitude of particles, the throng has been  caused to be denser. Now Joule's and my own old experiments on the efflux  of air prove that if the crowd be common air, or oxygen, or nitrogen, or  carbonic acid, the temperature is a little higher in the denser than in the  rarer condition when the energies are the same. By the hypothesis, equality  of temperature between two different gases or two portions of the same gas  at different densities means equality of kinetic energies in the same  number of molecules of the two. From our observations proving the  temperature to be higher, it therefore follows that the potential energy is  smaller in the condensed crowd. This--always, however, under protest as to  the temperature hypothesis--proves some degree of attraction among the  molecules, but it does not prove ultimate attraction between two molecules  in collision, or at distances much less than the average mutual distance of  nearest neighbors in the multitude. The collisional force might be  repulsive, as generally supposed hitherto, and yet attraction might  predominate in the whole reckoning of difference between the intrinsic  potential energies of the more dense and less dense multitudes.    It is however remarkable that the explanation of the propagation of sound  through gases, and even of the positive fluid pressure of a gas against the  sides of the containing vessel, according to the kinetic theory of gases,  is quite independent of the question whether the ultimate collisional force  is attractive or repulsive. Of course it must be understood that, if it is  attractive, the particles must, be so small that they hardly ever  meet--they would have to be infinitely small to _never_ meet--that, in  fact, they meet so seldom, in comparison with the number of times their  courses--are turned through large angles by attraction, that the influence  of these surely attractive collisions is preponderant over that of the  comparatively very rare impacts from actual contact. Thus, after all, the  train of speculation suggested by Davy's \"Repulsive Motion\" does not allow  us to escape from the idea of true repulsion, does not do more than let us  say it is of no consequence, nor even say this with truth, because, if  there are impacts at all, the nature of the force during the impact and the  effects of the mutual impacts, however rare, cannot be evaded in any  attempt to realize a conception of the kinetic theory of gases. And in  fact, unless we are satisfied to imagine the atoms of a gas as mathematical  points endowed with inertia, and as, according to Boscovich, endowed with  forces of mutual, positive, and negative attraction, varying according to  some definite function of the distance, we cannot avoid the question of  impacts, and of vibrations and rotations of the molecules resulting from  impacts, and we must look distinctly on each molecule as being either a  little elastic solid or a configuration of motion in a continuous  all-pervading liquid. I do not myself see how we can ever permanently rest  anywhere short of this last view; but it would be a very pleasant temporary  resting-place on the way to it if we could, as it were, make a mechanical  model of a gas out of little pieces of round, perfectly elastic solid  matter, flying about through the space occupied by the gas, and colliding  with one another and against the sides of the containing vessel.    This is, in fact, all we have of the kinetic theory of gases up to the  present time, and this has done for us, in the hands of Clausius and  Maxwell, the great things which constitute our first step toward a  molecular theory of matter. Of course from it we should have to go on to  find an explanation of the elasticity and all the other properties of the  molecules themselves, a subject vastly more complex and difficult than the  gaseous properties, for the explanation of which we assume the elastic  molecule; but without any explanation of the properties of the molecule  itself, with merely the assumption that the molecule has the requisite  properties, we might rest happy for a while in the contemplation of the  kinetic theory of gases, and its explanation of the gaseous properties,  which is not only stupendously important as a step toward a more  thoroughgoing theory of matter, but is undoubtedly the expression of a  perfectly intelligible and definite set of facts in Nature.    But alas for our mechanical model consisting of the cloud of little elastic  solids flying about among one another. Though each particle have absolutely  perfect elasticity, the end must be pretty much the same as if it were but  imperfectly elastic. The average effect of repeated and repeated mutual  collisions must be to gradually convert all the translational energy into  energy of shriller and shriller vibrations of the molecule. It seems  certain that each collision must have something more of energy in  vibrations of very finely divided nodal parts than there was of energy in  such vibrations before the impact. The more minute this nodal subdivision,  the less must be the tendency to give up part of the vibrational energy  into the shape of translational energy in the course of a collision; and I  think it is rigorously demonstrable that the whole translational energy  must ultimately become transformed into vibrational energy of higher and  higher nodal subdivisions if each molecule is a continuous elastic solid.  Let us, then, leave the kinetic theory of gases for a time with this  difficulty unsolved, in the hope that we or others after us may return to  it, armed with more knowledge of the properties of matter, and with sharper  mathematical weapons to cut through the barrier which at"]]]
