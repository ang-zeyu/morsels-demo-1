[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/836"],[0,"The Phoenix and the Carpet (#12)"],[1," a word,' said Cyril. 'How on earth are we to ask for  things for our bazaar?'    'And they're poor people, too,' said Jane; 'I'm sure they are. What we  want is a rajah or something.'    Robert was beginning to unroll the carpet, but the others stopped him,  imploring him not to waste a wish.    'We asked the carpet to take us where we could get Indian things for  bazaars,' said Anthea, 'and it will.'    Her faith was justified.    Just as she finished speaking a very brown gentleman in a turban came  up to them and bowed deeply. He spoke, and they thrilled to the sound of  English words.    'My ranee, she think you very nice childs. She asks do you lose  yourselves, and do you desire to sell carpet? She see you from her  palkee. You come see her--yes?'    They followed the stranger, who seemed to have a great many more teeth  in his smile than are usual, and he led them through crooked streets  to the ranee's palace. I am not going to describe the ranee's palace,  because I really have never seen the palace of a ranee, and Mr Kipling  has. So you can read about it in his books. But I know exactly what  happened there.    The old ranee sat on a low-cushioned seat, and there were a lot of other  ladies with her--all in trousers and veils, and sparkling with tinsel  and gold and jewels. And the brown, turbaned gentleman stood behind a  sort of carved screen, and interpreted what the children said and what  the queen said. And when the queen asked to buy the carpet, the children  said 'No.'    'Why?' asked the ranee.    And Jane briefly said why, and the interpreter interpreted. The queen  spoke, and then the interpreter said--    'My mistress says it is a good story, and you tell it all through  without thought of time.'    And they had to. It made a long story, especially as it had all to be  told twice--once by Cyril and once by the interpreter. Cyril rather  enjoyed himself. He warmed to his work, and told the tale of the Phoenix  and the Carpet, and the Lone Tower, and the Queen-Cook, in language that  grew insensibly more and more Arabian Nightsy, and the ranee and her  ladies listened to the interpreter, and rolled about on their fat  cushions with laughter.    When the story was ended she spoke, and the interpreter explained that  she had said, 'Little one, thou art a heaven-born teller of tales,' and  she threw him a string of turquoises from round her neck.    'OH, how lovely!' cried Jane and Anthea.    Cyril bowed several times, and then cleared his throat and said--    'Thank her very, very much; but I would much rather she gave me some of  the cheap things in the bazaar. Tell her I want them to sell again, and  give the money to buy clothes for poor people who haven't any.'    'Tell him he has my leave to sell my gift and clothe the naked with its  price,' said the queen, when this was translated.    But Cyril said very firmly, 'No, thank you. The things have got to be  sold to-day at our bazaar, and no one would buy a turquoise necklace at  an English bazaar. They'd think it was sham, or else they'd want to know  where we got it.'    So then the queen sent out for little pretty things, and her servants  piled the carpet with them.    'I must needs lend you an elephant to carry them away,' she said,  laughing.    But Anthea said, 'If the queen will lend us a comb and let us wash our  hands and faces, she shall see a magic thing. We and the carpet and all  these brass trays and pots and carved things and stuffs and things will  just vanish away like smoke.'    The queen clapped her hands at this idea, and lent the children a  sandal-wood comb inlaid with ivory lotus-flowers. And they washed their  faces and hands in silver basins. Then Cyril made a very polite farewell  speech, and quite suddenly he ended with the words--    'And I wish we were at the bazaar at our schools.'    And of course they were. And the queen and her ladies were left with  their mouths open, gazing at the bare space on the inlaid marble floor  where the carpet and the children had been.    'That is magic, if ever magic was!' said the queen, delighted with the  incident; which, indeed, has given the ladies of that court something to  talk about on wet days ever since.    Cyril's stories had taken some time, so had the meal of strange sweet  foods that they had had while the little pretty things were being  bought, and the gas in the schoolroom was already lighted. Outside, the  winter dusk was stealing down among the Camden Town houses.    'I'm glad we got washed in India,' said Cyril. 'We should have been  awfully late if we'd had to go home and scrub.'    'Besides,' Robert said, 'it's much warmer washing in India. I shouldn't  mind it so much if we lived there.'    The thoughtful carpet had dumped the children down in a dusky space  behind the point where the corners of two stalls met. The floor was  littered with string and brown paper, and baskets and boxes were heaped  along the wall.    The children crept out under a stall covered with all sorts of  table-covers and mats and things, embroidered beautifully by idle  ladies with no real work to do. They got out at the end, displacing a  sideboard-cloth adorned with a tasteful pattern of blue geraniums. The  girls got out unobserved, so did Cyril; but Robert, as he cautiously  emerged, was actually walked on by Mrs Biddle, who kept the stall. Her  large, solid foot stood firmly on the small, solid hand of Robert and  who can blame Robert if he DID yell a little?    A crowd instantly collected. Yells are very unusual at bazaars, and  every one was intensely interested. It was several seconds before the  three free children could make Mrs Biddle understand that what she  was walking on was not a schoolroom floor, or even, as she presently  supposed, a dropped pin-cushion, but the living hand of a suffering  child. When she became aware that she really had hurt him, she grew very  angry indeed. When people have hurt other people by accident, the one  who does the hurting is always much the angriest. I wonder why.    'I'm very sorry, I'm sure,' said Mrs Biddle; but she spoke more in anger  than in sorrow. 'Come out! whatever do you mean by creeping about under  the stalls, like earwigs?'    'We were looking at the things in the corner.'    'Such nasty, prying ways,' said Mrs Biddle, 'will never make you  successful in life. There's nothing there but packing and dust.'    'Oh, isn't there!' said Jane. 'That's all you know.'    'Little girl, don't be rude,' said Mrs Biddle, flushing violet.    'She doesn't mean to be; but there ARE some nice things there, all the  same,' said Cyril; who suddenly felt how impossible it was to inform the  listening crowd that all the treasures piled on the carpet were mother's  contributions to the bazaar. No one would believe it; and if they did,  and wrote to thank mother, she would think--well, goodness only knew  what she would think. The other three children felt the same.    'I should like to see them,' said a very nice lady, whose friends  had disappointed her, and who hoped that these might be belated  contributions to her poorly furnished stall.    She looked inquiringly at Robert, who said, 'With pleasure, don't  mention it,' and dived back under Mrs Biddle's stall.    'I wonder you encourage such behaviour,' said Mrs Biddle. 'I always  speak my mind, as you know, Miss Peasmarsh; and, I must say, I am  surprised.' She turned to the crowd. 'There is no entertainment here,'  she said sternly. 'A very naughty little boy has accidentally hurt  himself, but only slightly. Will you please disperse? It will only  encourage him in naughtiness if he finds himself the centre of  attraction.'    The crowd slowly dispersed. Anthea, speechless with fury, heard a nice  curate say, 'Poor little beggar!' and loved the curate at once and for  ever.    Then Robert wriggled out from under the stall with some Benares brass  and some inlaid sandalwood boxes.    'Liberty!' cried Miss Peasmarsh. 'Then Charles has not forgotten, after  all.'    'Excuse me,' said Mrs Biddle, with fierce politeness, 'these objects are  deposited behind MY stall. Some unknown donor who does good by stealth,  and would blush if he could hear you claim the things. Of course they  are for me.'    'My stall touches yours at the corner,' said poor Miss Peasmarsh,  timidly, 'and my cousin did promise--'    The children sidled away from the unequal contest and mingled with  the crowd. Their feelings were too deep for words--till at last Robert  said--    'That stiff-starched PIG!'    'And after all our trouble! I'm hoarse with gassing to that trousered  lady in India.'    'The pig-lady's very, very nasty,' said Jane.    It was Anthea who said, in a hurried undertone, 'She isn't very nice,  and Miss Peasmarsh is pretty and nice too. Who's got a pencil?'    It was a long crawl, under three stalls, but Anthea did it. A large  piece of pale blue paper lay among the rubbish in the corner.    She folded it to a square and wrote upon it, licking the pencil at every  word to make it mark quite blackly: 'All these Indian things are for  pretty, nice Miss Peasmarsh's stall.' She thought of adding, 'There is  nothing for Mrs Biddle;' but she saw that this might lead to suspicion,  so she wrote hastily: 'From an unknown donna,' and crept back among the  boards and trestles to join the others.    So that when Mrs Biddle appealed to the bazaar committee, and the corner  of the stall was lifted and shifted, so that stout clergymen and heavy  ladies could get to the corner without creeping under stalls, the blue  paper was discovered, and all the splendid, shining Indian things were  given over to Miss Peasmarsh, and she sold them all, and got thirty-five  pounds for them.    'I don't understand about that blue paper,' said Mrs Biddle. 'It looks  to me like the work of a lunatic. And saying you were nice and pretty!  It's not the work of a sane person.'

Its neat reception room,  with its tables, chairs and clock, shows the influence of the modern  world.    Here a monk in the prime of life spent a few months recently lecturing  on Buddhism to members of parliament and to scholars from various parts  of China. Frequently the writer used to drop in of an afternoon to  discuss Buddhism and its outlook. Usually a simple repast concluded  these conversations, the substance of which forms the greater part of  this section.    _1. The Threefold Classification of Men Under Buddhism_    \"What does Buddhism do for men?\"    \"There are in the world at least three classes of men. The lowest class  live among material things, they are occupied with possessions. Their  life is entangled in the crude and coarse materials which they regard as  real. A second, higher class, regard ideas as realities. They are not  entangled in the maze of things, but are confused by ideas, ascribing  reality to them. The third and highest class are those who by meditation  have freed themselves from the thraldom of ideas and can enter the  sixteen heavens.\"    _2. Salvation for the Common Man_    \"What can Buddhism do for the lowest class?\"    \"For this class Buddhism has the ten prohibitions. Every man has in him  ten evils, which must be driven out. Three have to do with evil in the  body, namely, not to steal, not to kill, not to commit adultery; four  belong to the mouth, lying, exaggeration, abuse, and ambiguous talk;  three belong to the mind, covetousness, malice, and unbelief.\"    \"Is not this entirely negative?\"    \"Yes, but it is necessary, for during the process of eliminating these  evil deeds, man acquires patience and equanimity. Buddhism does not stop  with the prohibitions. The believer must practice the ten charitable  deeds. Not only must he remove the desire to kill living beings, but he  must cultivate the desire to save all beings. Not only must he not  steal, but he must assist men with his money. Not only must he not give  himself to lasciviousness, but he must treat all men with propriety. So  each prohibition involves a positive impulse to virtue, which is quite  as essential as the refraining from evil.\"    \"What energizing power does Buddhism provide?\"    \"First, is purgatory with its terrors. The evil man, seeing the  consequences of his acts upon himself, becomes afraid to do them and  does that which is good. Then there is transmigration with the danger of  transmigration into beasts and insects. Again, there are the rewards in  the paradise of Amitâbha. Moreover, there is even the possibility not  only of saving one's self, but by accumulated merit of saving one's  parents and relatives and shortening their stay in purgatory.\"    _3. The Place of Faith_    \"Can any man enter the western paradise of Amitâbha?\"    \"Yes, it is open to all men. The sutra says: 'If there be any one who  commits evil deeds, and even completes the ten evil actions, the five  deadly sins and the like; that man, being himself stupid and guilty of  many crimes, deserves to fall into a miserable path of existence and  suffer endless pains during many long ages. On the eve of death he may  meet a good and learned teacher who, soothing and encouraging him in  various ways, will preach to him the excellent Law and teach him the  remembrance of Buddha, but being harassed by pains', he will have no  time to think of Buddha.'\"    \"What hope has such a man?\"    \"Even such a man has hope. The sutra says: 'Some good friend will say to  him: Even if thou canst not exercise the remembrance of Buddha, utter  the name of Buddha Amitabha.' Let him do so serenely with his voice  uninterrupted; let him be (continually) thinking of Buddha, until he has  completed ten times the thought, repeating 'Namah O-mi-to-fo,' I put my  trust in Buddha! On the strength of (his merit of) uttering Buddha's  name he will, during every repetition expiate the sins which involve him  in births and deaths during eighty millions of long ages. He will, while  dying, see a golden lotus-flower, like the disk of the sun, appearing  before his eyes; in a moment he will be born in the world of highest  happiness. After twelve greater ages the lotus-flower will unfold;  thereupon the Bodhisattvas, Avalôkitësvaras and Mahasattva's, raising  their voices in great compassion, will preach to him in detail the real  state of all the elements of nature and the law of the expiation of  sins.\"    \"Does faith save such a man?\"    \"Yes, not his own faith, but the faith which prompted the vow of  Amitabha. Amitâbha's faith in the possibility of his salvation gives him  supreme confidence that he will attain salvation. All he needs is to  have the desire to be born in that paradise and to repeat the name of  Amitabha.\"    _4. Salvation of the Second Class_    \"How do those of the second class attain salvation?\"    \"The men of the second class regard ideas as realities. They are not  entangled in the maze of things, but are confused by ideas, regarding  them as real. These men do not need images and outward sanctions, but  they need heaven and purgatory though regarding them as ideas. By  performing the ten good deeds they will obtain a quiet heart, having no  fear, and become saints and sages. Among men, saints and sages occupy a  high rank, but not so among Buddhists. By merit of good works merely  they enter the planes of sensuous desire, the six celestial worlds  located immediately above the earth.\"    _5. Salvation for the Highest Class_    \"And the third class?\"    \"This class has many ranks. There are those who by the practice of  meditation (four _dkyanas_) [Footnote: Dhyana means contemplation.  In later times under the influence of the idea of transmigration heavens  were imagined which corresponded to the degrees of contemplation.] can  enter the sixteen heavens conditioned by form. By the practice of the  four _arûpa-dhyânas_ [Footnote: That degree of abstract  contemplation from which all sensations are absent.] they enter the four  highest heavens free from all sensuous desires and not conditioned by  form. These heavens are the anteroom of Nirvana.\"    \"What is the driving power in all this?\"    \"It is _vîrya_ or energy.\"    _6. Heaven and Purgatory_    \"Do heaven and purgatory exist?\"    \"Heaven and purgatory are in the minds and hearts of men. Really heaven  is in the mind of Amitâbha and purgatory exists in the illusioned brains  of men.\"    \"Does anything exist?\"    \"Nâgârjuna says: 'There is no production, no destruction, no  annihilation, no persistence, no unity, no plurality, no coming in and  no going forth.'\"    _7. Sin_    \"Does sin exist?\"    \"In the mind of the real Buddhist sin and virtue are different aspects  of the all. Sin is illusion; virtue is illusion, There is a higher unity  in which they are reconciled.\"    _8. Nirvâna_    _\"Do you know of any one who attained Nirvâna?\"_    \"Yes, I have experienced it. It is not a state beyond the grave. It is a  state into which one can enter here.\"    \"Can you express this experience in words?\"    \"Impossible. I can only indicate the shore of this great ocean. At first  I was in great distress and agony, as though carrying the illusions of  the world. Then came a great peace and calm, ineffable, serene, and  surpassing the power of language to express.\"    _9. The Philosophical Background_    \"What is behind this universe!\"    \"Underlying this universe of phenomena and change there is a unity. It  is the basis of all being. It is within all being and all being rests in  it. It is because of this common background that men are able to  apprehend it. This universal basis we call _dharma,_ or law. Its  characteristics are that everything born grows old, is subject to  disease and death; that the teachings of Buddha purify the mind and  enable it to obtain supreme enlightenment; that all Buddhas by treading  the same way of perfection will attain the highest freedom.\"    \"You speak of the Buddhist Trinity.\"    \"Yes, we have the Dharmakâya. This is the essence-body, the ground of  all being, taking many forms, Buddhas, Bodhisattvas, spirits, angels,  men and even demons. It is impersonal, all-pervasive. It may be called  the first person. The second person is the Sambhogakâya, the body of  bliss. This is the heavenly manifestation of Buddha. The third person is  the Nirmânakâya. This is the projection of the body of bliss on earth.\"    Some identify this trinity with that of the Christian faith. While there  is a resemblance, we should note that the first person of the Buddhist  trinity would correspond to God as the absolute or the impersonal  background of universal Being. The second corresponds to the glorified  Christ and the third to the historic Jesus. There is no counterpart  either to God the Father or to the Holy Spirit.    \"Do you believe in the salvation of all beings?\"    \"Yes, all have the Buddha heart. All living beings will finally become  Buddhas.\"    Then turning to a friend of mine the speaker said: \"What have you done  in Buddhism?\" The friend answered: \"I have written and translated many  books.\" \"I do not mean that,\" he answered. \"What _work_ have you  done?\" The friend confessed that he had not done much else. Then he  said: \"Every morning when you awake, reflect deeply and profoundly upon  your state before you were born. Think back to that state where your  soul was merged with Buddha. Find yourself in that state and you will  find ineffable enlightenment and joy.\"    The sun was setting behind the Western hills. The blare of trumpets  sounded on the city wall. Outside of the door was the whirling sound of  Peking returning home from its mundane tasks and joys. We joined the  rushing, restless crowd and still we felt the calm of another world. Has  not Christianity a message of balm and peace for these sons of the East  who are so sensitive to the touch of the eternal and sublime?    _10. What Buddhism Has to Give_"]]]
