[Illustration: Fig. 3.--INCANDESCENT GAS LIGHTER.]    Dr. Naret's _Fiat Lux_ (Fig. 3) is simpler in its operation, and cheaper  of application, since it takes its current from the ordinary piles that  supply domestic call-bells. It consists essentially of a fine platinum  wire supported by a tilting device in connection with the two poles of a  pile composed of three Leclanche elements. Upon exerting a vertical  pressure on the button placed to the left of the apparatus, either  directly or by means of a cord, we at the same time turn the cock and  cause the platinum spiral to approach, and the latter then becomes  incandescent as a consequence of the closing of the circuit of the pile.  After the burner is lighted it is only necessary to leave the apparatus  to itself. The cock remains open, the spiral recedes from the burner,  the circuit opens anew, and the burner remains lighted until the gas is  turned off. This device, then, is particularly appropriate in all cases  where there is a pressing need of light, for a single maneuver suffices  to open the cock and effect a lighting of the burner.--_La Nature_.           *       *       *       *       *          DISTRIBUTION OF HEAT WHICH IS DEVELOPED BY FORGING.      On the 8th of June. 1874, Tresca presented to the French Academy some  considerations respecting the distribution of heat in forging a bar of  platinum, and stated the principal reasons which rendered that metal  especially suitable for the purpose. He subsequently experimented, in a  similar way, with other metals, and finally adopted Senarmont's method  for the study of conductibility. A steel or copper bar was carefully  polished on its lateral faces, and the polished portion covered with a  thin coat of wax. The bar thus prepared was placed under a ram, of known  weight, P, which was raised to a height, H, where it was automatically  released so as to expend upon the bar the whole quantity of work _T=PH,_  between the two equal faces of the ram and the anvil. A single shock  sufficed to melt the wax upon a certain zone and thus to limit, with  great sharpness, the part of the lateral faces which had been raised  during the shock to the temperature of melting wax. Generally the zone  of fusion imitates the area comprised between the two branches of an  equilateral hyperbola, but the fall can be so graduated as to restrict  this zone, which then takes other forms, somewhat different, but always  symmetrical. If A is the area of this zone, b the breadth of the bar, d  the density of the metal, c its capacity for heat, and t-t0 the excess  of the melting temperature of wax over the surrounding temperature, it  is evident that, if we consider A as the base of a horizontal prism  which is raised to the temperature t, the calorific effect may be  expressed by:      Ab x d x C(t-t0);    and on multiplying this quantity of heat by 425 we find, for the value  of its equivalent in work,      T' = 425 AbdC(t-t0).    On comparing T' to T we may consider the experiment as a mechanical  operation, having a minimum of:      T'/T = (425/PH)AbdC(t-t0).    After giving diagrams and tables to illustrate the geometrical  disposition of the areas of fusion, Tresca feels justified in concluding  that the development of heat depends upon the form of the faces and the  intensity of the shock; that the points of greatest heat correspond to  the points of greatest flow of the metal, and that this flow is really  the mechanical phenomenon which gives rise to the calorific phenomenon;  that for action sufficiently energetic and for bars of sufficient  dimensions, about 0.8 of the labor expended on the blow may be found  again in the heat; that the figures formed in the melted wax for shocks  of less intensity furnish a kind of diagram of the distribution of the  heat and of the deformation in the interior of the bar, but that the  calculation of the coefficient of efficiency does not yield satisfactory  results in the case of moderate blows.--_Comptes Rendus_.           *       *       *       *       *          TIN IN CANNED FOODS.    [Footnote: Read at an evening meeting of the Pharmaceutical Society,  March 5, 1884.]    By PROFESSOR ATTFIELD, F.R.S., ETC.      From time to time, during the past twelve years, paragraphs have  appeared in newspapers and other periodicals tending in effect to warn  the public at least against the indiscriminate use of canned foods. And  whenever there has been any foundation in fact for such cautions, it has  commonly rested on the alleged presence and harmfulness of tin in the  food. At the worst, the amount of tin present has been absurdly small,  affording an opportunity for one literary representative of medicine to  state that before a man could be seriously affected by the tin, even if  it occurred in the form of a compound of the metal, he would have to  consume at a meal ten pounds of the food containing the largest amount  of tin ever detected.    But the greatest proportions of tin thus referred to are, according to  my experiments, far beyond those ever likely to be actually present in  the food itself in the form of a compound of tin; present, that is to  say, on account of the action of the fluids or juices of the food on the  tin of the can. Such action and such consequent solution of the tin, and  consequent admixture of a possibly assimilable compound of tin with the  food, in my opinion never occurs to an extent which in relation to  health has any significance whatever. The occurrence of tin, not as a  compound, but as the metal itself, is, if possible, still less  important.    During the last fifteen years I have frequently examined canned foods,  not only with respect to the food itself as food, and to the process of  canning, but with regard to the relation of the food to, or the  influence if any of the metal of, the can itself. So lately as within  the past two or three months I have examined sixteen varieties of canned  food for metals, with the following results:                                      Decimal parts of                                      a grain of tin                                   (or other foreign                                   metal) present in    Name of article               a quarter of a lb.    examined.      Salmon                               none.    Lobsters                             none.    Oysters                              0.004    Sardines                             none.    Lobster paste                        none.    Salmon paste                         none.    Bloater paste                        0.002    Potted beef                          none.    Potted tongue                        none.    Potted \"Strasbourg\"                  none.    Potted ham                           0.002    Luncheon tongue                      0.003    Apricots                             0.007    Pears                                0.003    Tomatoes                             0.007    Peaches                              0.004    These proportions of metal are, I say, undeserving of serious notice. I  question whether they represent more than the amounts of tin we  periodically wear off tin saucepans in preparing food--a month ago I  found a trace of tin in water which had been boiled in a tin kettle--or  the silver we wear off our forks and spoons. There can be little doubt  that we annually pass through our systems a sensible amount of such  metals, metallic compounds, and other substances that do not come under  the denomination of food; but there is no evidence that they ever did or  are ever likely to do harm or occasion us the slightest inconvenience.  Harm is far more likely to come to us from noxious gases in the air we  breathe than from foreign substances in the food we eat.    But whence come the much less minute amounts of tin--still harmless, be  it remembered--which have been stated to be occasionally present in  canned foods? They come from the minute particles of metal chipped off  from the tin sheets in the operations of cutting, bending, or hammering  the parts of the can, or possibly melted off in the operations necessary  for the soldering together of the joints of the can. Some may, perhaps,  be cut, off by the knife in opening a can. At all events I not  unfrequently find such minute particles of metal on carefully washing  the external surfaces of a mass of meat just removed from a can, or on  otherwise properly treating canned food with the object of detecting  such particles. The published processes for the detection of tin in  canned food will not reveal more than the amounts stated in the table,  or about those amounts; that is to say, a few thousandths or perhaps two  or three hundredths of a grain, if this precaution be adopted. If such  care be not observed, the less minute amounts may be found. I did not  detect any metallic particles in the twelve samples of canned food just  mentioned, but during the past few years I have occasionally found small  pieces of metal, perhaps amounting in some of the cases to a few tenths  of a grain per pound. Now and then small shot-like pieces of tin, or  possibly solder, may be met with; but no one has ever found, to my  knowledge, such a quantity of actual metallic tin, tinned iron, or  solder as, from the point of view of health, can have any significance  whatever.    The largest amount of tin I ever detected in actual solution in food was  in some canned soup, containing a good deal of lemon juice. It amounted  to only three-hundredths of a grain in a half pint of the soup as sent  to table. Now, Christison says that quantities of 18 to 44 grains of the  very soluble chloride of tin were required to kill dogs in from one to  four days. Orfila says that several persons on one occasion dressed  their dinner with chloride of tin, mistaking it for salt. One person  would thus take not less than "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/11414"],[0,"In the Claws of the German Eagle (#13)"],[1,"their hard fatiguing  exertions.    Here and there among the groves, or along the wayside, was a  contrivance that looked like a tiny engine; smoke curled out of its  chimney and coals blazed brightly in the grate. They were the  kitchen-wagons, each making in itself a complete, compact  cooking apparatus. Some had immense caldrons with a spoon as  large as a spade. In these the stews, put up in dry form and  guaranteed to keep for twenty years, were being heated. A savory  smell permeated the air and at the sound of the bugle the men  clustered about, each looking happy as he received his dish filled  with steaming rations.    Through this scene the native Belgians moved freely in and out.  Tables had been dragged out into the yard, and around them  officers were sitting eating, drinking, and chatting with the peasant  women who were serving them and with whom they had set up an  entente cordiale. Indeed, these Belgians seemed to be rather  enjoying this interruption in the monotony of their lives, and a few  were making the most of the great adventure. In one case I could  not help believing that a certain strikingly-pretty, self-possessed girl  was not altogether averse to a war which could thus bring to her  side the attentions of such a handsome and gallant set of officers  as were gathered round her. At any rate, she was equal to the  occasion, and over her little court, which rang with laughter, she  presided with a certain rustic dignity and ease.    The ordinary soldier could make himself understood only with  motions and sundry gruntings, and consequently had to content  himself with smoking in the sun or sleeping in the shade.  Everywhere was the atmosphere of physical relaxation after the  long journey. So far did my tension wear off, that I even forgot the  resolution to hold my tongue. Two officers leaning back in their  chairs at a table by the wayside surveyed me intently as I came  along. Rather than wait to be challenged, I thought it best to turn  aside and ask them my usual question, \"How does one get to  Liege?\"    One of them answered somewhat stiffly, adding, \"And where did  you learn your German?\" \"I was in a German university a few  months,\" I replied. \"Which one?\" the officer asked. \"Marburg,\" I  replied.    \"Ah!\" he said, this time with a smile; \"that was mine. I studied  philology there.\"    We talked together of the fine, rich life there, and I spoke of the  students' duels I had witnessed a few miles out.    \"Ah!\" he said, uncovering his head and pointing to the scars  across his scalp; \"that's where I got these. Perhaps I will get some  deeper ones down in this country,\" he added with a smile.    Ofttimes in the early morning hours I had trudged out to a  students' inn on the outskirts of Marburg. As many times I had  heard the solemn announcement of the umpire warning all  assembled to disperse as the place might be raided by the police  and all imprisoned. That was a mere formality. No one left. The  umpire forthwith cried \"Los,\" there was a flash of swords in the air  as each duelist sought, and sometimes succeeded, in cutting his  opponent's face into a Hamburg steak. It was a sanguinary affair  and undoubtedly connived at by the officials. When I had asked  what was the point of it all, I was told that it developed Mut and  Enschlossenheit--a fine contempt of pain and blood. That dueling  was not without its contribution to the general program of German  preparedness. Only now the bloodletting was gone at on a  colossal scale.    \"Yes, that's where I received these cuts,\" this young officer said,  \"and if I do not get some too deep down here I'll write to you after  the war,\" he added with another smile. As I gave him my address,  I asked for his.    \"It's against all the rules,\" he answered. \"It can't be done. But you  shall hear from me, I assure you,\" he said with a hearty  handshake.    Only once all the way into Liege did I feel any suspicion directed  towards me. That was when I presented my paper to the next  guard, a morose-looking individual. He looked at it very puzzled,  and put several questions to me. His last one was,    \"Where is your home?\"    \"I come from Boston, Massachusetts,\" I replied.    Encouraged with my success with the last officers, I ventured to  ask him where he came from.    Looking me straight in the eyes, he replied very pointedly, \"Ich  komme aus Deutschland.\"    Good form among invading armies, I found, precluded the guest  making inquiry into anyone's antecedents. I made a second  resolution to keep my own counsel, as I hurried down the road.    There was no release from his searching eyes until a turn in the  highway put an intervening obstacle between myself and him. But  this relief was short-lived, for no sooner had I rounded the bend  than a cry of \"Halt!\" shot fear into me. I turned to see a man on a  wheel waving wildly at me. I thought it was a summons back to my  inquisitor, and the end of my journey. Instead, it was my officer  from Marburg, who dismounted, took two letters from his pocket,  and asked me if I would have the kindness to deliver them to the  Feld Post if I got through to Liege. He said that seemed like a God-  given opportunity to lift the load off the hearts of his mother and his  sweetheart back home. Gladly I took them, with his caution not to  drop them into an ordinary letter-box in Liege, but to take them to  the Feld Post or give them to an officer. I went on my way rejoicing  that I could add these letters to my credentials. I now passed down  the long street of Jupilles, which was plastered with notices from  the German authorities guaranteeing observance of the rights of  the citizens of Jupilles, but threatening to visit any overt acts  against the soldiers \"with the most terrible reprisals.\"    I arrived on the outskirts of Liege with the expectation of seeing a  sorry-looking battered city, as the reports which had drifted to the  outer world had made it; but considering that it had been the  center around which the storm of battle had raged for over two  weeks, it showed outwardly but little damage. The chief marks of  war were in the shattered windows; the great pontoon bridge of  barges, which replaced the dynamited structure by the Rue  Leopold, and hundreds of stores and public buildings, flying the  white flag with the Red Cross on it. The walls, too, were fairly white  with placards posted by order of the German burgomaster Klyper.  It was an anachronism to find along the trail of the forty-two  centimeter guns warnings of death to persons harboring courier  pigeons.    Another bill which was just being posted was the announcement of  the war-tax of 50,000,000 francs imposed on the city to pay for the  \"administration of civil affairs.\" That was the first of those war-  levies which leeched the life blood out of Belgium.    The American consul, Heingartner, threw up his hands in  astonishment as I presented myself. No one else had come  through since the beginning of hostilities. He begged for  newspapers but, unfortunately, I had thrown my lot away, not  realizing how completely Liege had been cut off from the outer  world. He related the incidents of that first night entry of German  troops into Liege. The clatter of machine gun bullets sweeping by  the consulate had scarcely ceased when the sounds of gun-butts  battering on the doors accompanied by hoarse shouts of \"Auf  Steigen\" (get up) reverberated through the street. As the doors  unbolted and swung back, officers peremptorily demanded  quarters for their troops, receiving with contempt the protests of  Heingartner that they were violating precincts under protection of  the American flag.    On the following day, however, a wholehearted apology was  tendered along with an invitation to witness the first firing of the big  guns.    \"Put your fingers in your ears, stand on your toes, and open your  mouth,\" the officer said. There was a terrific concussion, a black  speck up in the heavens, and a ton of metal dropped down out of  the blue, smashing one of the cupolas of the forts to pieces. That  one shot annihilated 260 men. I shuddered as we all do. But it  should not be for the sufferings of the killed. For they did not suffer  at all. They were wiped out as by the snapping of a finger.    The taking of those 260 bodies out of the world, then, was a  painless process. But not so the bringing of these bodies into the  world. That cost an infinite sum of pain and anguish. To bring  these bodies into being 260 mothers went down into the very  Valley of the Shadow of Death. And now in a flash all this life had  been sent crashing into eternity. \"Women may not bear arms, but  they bear men, and so furnish the first munitions of war.\" Thus are  they deeply and directly concerned in the affairs of the state.    The consul with his wife and daughter gave me dinner along with a  cordial welcome. At first he was most appreciative of my exploits.  Then it seemed to dawn on him that possibly other motives than  sheer love of adventure might have spurred me on. The harboring  of a possible spy was too large a risk to run in the uncertain  temper of the Germans. In that light I took on the aspects of a  liability.    The clerks of the two hotels to whom I applied assumed a like  attitude. In fact every one with whom I attempted to hold converse  became coldly aloof. Holding the best of intents, I was treated like  a pariah. The only one whom I could get a raise from was a  bookseller who spoke English. His wrath against the spoilers  overcame his discretion, and he launched out into a bitter tirade  against them. I reminded him that, as civilians, his fellow-  countrymen had undoubtedly been sniping on the German troops.  That was too much.    \"What would you do if a thief or a murderer entered your house?\"  he exploded. \"No matter if he had announced his coming, you  would shoot him, wouldn't you?\"    Realizing that he had confided altogether too"]]]
