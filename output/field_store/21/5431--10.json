I, VIII. 69. 9, VI. 23. 5, 1. 47. 2, VII. 22.  9, VI. 52. 3, etc.). On the strength of these Hillebrandt justifies the  conjecture of Haug that it signifies a mysterious power which can  be called forth by various ceremonies, and his definition of it, as  the magical force which is derived from the orderly cooperation of  the hymns, the chants and the sacrificial gifts [Footnote ref 3]. I am  disposed to think that this meaning is closely connected with the  meaning as we find it in many passages in the Ara@nyakas and the  Upani@sads. The meaning in many of these seems to be midway between    ________________________________________________________________    [Footnote 1: Ait. Ara@n. II 1-3.]    [Footnote 2: Keith's _Translation of Aitareya Aranyaka_.]    [Footnote 3: Hillebrandt's article on Brahman, _E.R.E._.]    37    \"magical force\" and \"great,\" transition between which is  rather easy. Even when the sacrifices began to be replaced by  meditations, the old belief in the power of the sacrifices still  remained, and as a result of that we find that in many passages  of the Upani@sads people are thinking of meditating upon this  great force \"Brahman\" as being identified with diverse symbols,  natural objects, parts and functions of the body.    When the main interest of sacrifice was transferred from its  actual performance in the external world to certain forms of  meditation, we find that the understanding of particular allegories  of sacrifice having a relation to particular kinds of bodily functions  was regarded as Brahman, without a knowledge of which nothing  could be obtained. The fact that these allegorical interpretations  of the Pancagnividya are so much referred to in the Upani@sads  as a secret doctrine, shows that some people came to think that  the real efficacy of sacrifices depended upon such meditations.  When the sages rose to the culminating conception, that he is  really ignorant who thinks the gods to be different from him, they  thought that as each man was nourished by many beasts, so the  gods were nourished by each man, and as it is unpleasant for a  man if any of his beasts are taken away, so it is unpleasant for  the gods that men should know this great truth. [Footnote ref 1].    In the Kena we find it indicated that all the powers of  the gods such as that of Agni (fire) to burn, Vayu (wind) to  blow, depended upon Brahman, and that it is through Brahman  that all the gods and all the senses of man could work. The  whole process of Upani@sad thought shows that the magic power  of sacrifices as associated with @Rta (unalterable law) was being  abstracted from the sacrifices and conceived as the supreme power.  There are many stories in the Upani@sads of the search after the  nature of this great power the Brahman, which was at first only  imperfectly realized. They identified it with the dominating power  of the natural objects of wonder, the sun, the moon, etc. with  bodily and mental functions and with various symbolical  representations, and deluded themselves for a time with the idea  that these were satisfactory. But as these were gradually found  inadequate, they came to the final solution, and the doctrine of  the inner self of man as being the highest truth the Brahman  originated.    ___________________________________________________________________    [Footnote 1: B@rh. I. 4. 10.]    38      The meaning of the word Upani@sad.    The word Upani@sad is derived from the root _sad_ with the prefix  _ni_ (to sit), and Max Muller says that the word originally meant the  act of sitting down near a teacher and of submissively listening to  him. In his introduction to the Upani@sads he says, \"The history  and the genius of the Sanskrit language leave little doubt that  Upani@sad meant originally session, particularly a session consisting  of pupils, assembled at a respectful distance round their teacher  [Footnote ref 1].\" Deussen points out that the word means \"secret\" or  \"secret instruction,\" and this is borne out by many of the passages of  the Upani@sads themselves. Max Muller also agrees that the word was used  in this sense in the Upani@sads [Footnote ref 2]. There we find that  great injunctions of secrecy are to be observed for the communication  of the doctrines, and it is said that it should only be given to a  student or pupil who by his supreme moral restraint and noble desires  proves himself deserving to hear them. S'ankara however, the  great Indian exponent of the Upani@sads, derives the word from  the root _sad_ to destroy and supposes that it is so called because it  destroys inborn ignorance and leads to salvation by revealing the  right knowledge. But if we compare the many texts in which the  word Upani@sad occurs in the Upani@sads themselves it seems that  Deussen's meaning is fully justified [Footnote ref 3].      The composition and growth of diverse Upani@sads.    The oldest Upani@sads are written in prose. Next to these we  have some in verses very similar to those that are to be found in  classical Sanskrit. As is easy to see, the older the Upani@sad the  more archaic is it in its language. The earliest Upani@sads have  an almost mysterious forcefulness in their expressions at least to  Indian ears. They are simple, pithy and penetrate to the heart.  We can read and read them over again without getting tired.  The lines are always as fresh as ever. As such they have a charm  apart from the value of the ideas they intend to convey. The word  Upani@sad was used, as we have seen, in the sense of \"secret  doctrine or instruction\"; the Upani@sad teachings were also intended  to be conveyed in strictest secrecy to earnest enquirers of  high morals and superior self-restraint for the purpose of achieving    ______________________________________________________________________    [Footnote 1: Max Muller's _Translation of the Upanishads, S.B.E._ vol.  I.p. lxxxi.]    [Footnote 2: _S. B.E._ vol. I, p lxxxi.]    [Footnote 3: Deussen's _Philosophy of the Upanishads,_ pp. 10-15.]    39    emancipation. It was thus that the Upani@sad style of expression,  when it once came into use, came to possess the greatest charm and  attraction for earnest religious people; and as a result of that we  find that even when other forms of prose and verse had been  adapted for the Sanskrit language, the Upani@sad form of composition  had not stopped. Thus though the earliest Upani@sads  were compiled by 500 B C., they continued to be written even so  late as the spread of Mahommedan influence in India. The  earliest and most important are probably those that have been  commented upon by S'ankara namely B@rhadara@nyaka, Chandogya,  Aitareya, Taittiriya, Is'a, Kena, Katha, Pras'na, Mundaka and  Mandukya [Footnote ref 1]. It is important to note in this connection  that the separate Upani@sads differ much from one another with regard  to their content and methods of exposition. Thus while some of  them are busy laying great stress upon the monistic doctrine of  the self as the only reality, there are others which lay stress upon  the practice of Yoga, asceticism, the cult of S'iva, of Visnu and  the philosophy or anatomy of the body, and may thus be  respectively called the Yoga, S'aiva, Visnu and S'arira Upani@sads.  These in all make up the number to one hundred and eight.      Revival of Upani@sad studies in modern times.    How the Upani@sads came to be introduced into Europe is an  interesting story Dara Shiko the eldest son of the Emperor  Shah Jahan heard of the Upani@sads during his stay in Kashmir  in 1640. He invited several Pandits from Benares to Delhi, who  undertook the work of translating them into Persian. In 1775  Anquetil Duperron, the discoverer of the Zend Avesta, received  a manuscript of it presented to him by his friend Le Gentil, the  French resident in Faizabad at the court of Shuja-uddaulah.  Anquetil translated it into Latin which was published in 1801-1802.  This translation though largely unintelligible was read by  Schopenhauer with great enthusiasm. It had, as Schopenhauer  himself admits, profoundly influenced his philosophy. Thus he    ______________________________________________________________________    [Footnote 1: Deussen supposes that Kausitaki is also one of the earliest.  Max Mueller and Schroeder think that Maitray@ani also belongs to the  earliest group, whereas Deussen counts it as a comparatively later  production. Winternitz divides the Upani@sads into four periods. In  the first period he includes B@rhadara@nyaka, Chandogya, Taittiriya,  Aitareya, Kausitaki and Kena. In that second he includes Ka@thaka, Is'a,  S'vetas'vatara, Mu@ndaka, Mahanarayana, and in the third period he  includes Pras'na, Maitraya@ni and Man@dukya. The rest of the Upani@sads  he includes in the fourth period.]    40    writes in the preface to his _Welt als Wille und Vorstellung_  [Footnote ref 1], \"And if, indeed, in addition to this he is a partaker  of the benefit conferred by the Vedas, the access to which, opened to  us through the Upanishads, is in my eyes the greatest advantage which  this still young century enjoys over previous ones, because I believe  that the influence of the Sanskrit literature will penetrate not less  deeply than did the revival of Greek literature in the fifteenth  century: if, I say, the reader has also already received and  assimilated the sacred, primitive Indian wisdom, then is he best  of all prepared to hear what I have to say to him....I might express  the opinion that each one of the individual and disconnected  aphorisms which make up the Upanishads may be deduced as  a consequence from the thought I am going to impart, though  the converse, that my thought is to be found in the Upanishads  is by no means the case.\" Again, \"How does every line display  its firm, definite, and throughout harmonious meaning! From every  sentence deep, original,"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/12975"],[0,"International Weekly Miscellany of Literature, Art and Science — Volume 1, No. (#13)"],[1,"he stood,  he pressed Marguerite in his arms; again the nobility of his mind  brightened in his eye and beamed over his countenance. It was another  instance amid the thousand which, unknown to them, were passing around  them of a man won to noble thoughts by a woman's influence, proving  that she is the animating power to save him in all his difficulties;  that she invokes and renews all those noble thoughts which are  concealed in the recesses of his mind. Hers is the light to dispel  the mists which the chill atmosphere of the world hangs around the  brightest portions of the mind: great at all times, greatest of all  when, in a moment of difficulty, she is called upon to decide between  the good and the evil, the just and the unjust, the generous and  the mean, the ingenuous and the sophistical; and Marguerite, in one  glance, saw all that Dumiger had failed to discover in the Count's  appearance and manner,--the dark design, the selfish calculation; her  simplicity of mind perceived indications of low, mean purposes, which  he failed to discern. Thus it is ever that the first impressions, and,  above all other first impressions, the impressions of innocence and  youth, are the truest and most to be depended on.    For wherein is it that men--so often men of the shrewdest intelligence  and keenest intellect--deceive themselves by their own egregious  vanity.--by that vanity which makes them prefer to depend on the  refinements and subtle processes of their own intelligence, rather  than on the first impressions of the mind which Heaven has bestowed  upon them? They are not satisfied with perceiving that a thing is  good, but they must learn why it is so. They are not satisfied with  knowing that the world is beautiful, that the harmony of this globe  and its planets is admirable, but they must know the origin of  this beauty, and the cause of the harmony which strikes them with  wonder. It is not enough for them to be told they are \"fearfully  and wonderfully made,\" but they must attend schools to learn why  they live, move, and have their being. Such is man, blinded by his  self-conceit; blasted not by the excess, but by the partial light  which bursts upon him: whereas woman moves clear in her apprehension,  because she believes that \"whatever is, is right;\" and great in her  intelligence, because she knows she is ignorant.    The count saw that all further appeals to Dumiger's interest would now  be thrown away, but he was not on that account to be baffled.    \"Very well, sir,\" he said, in an angry voice; \"I make you the greatest  offer that was ever made to any workman in this city, and you reject  it with contempt. The day will come when you shall repent it. I would  have saved you for that woman's sake, from the distress and ruin which  are impending over you, but you will not be free. Look to it, sir, for  there is danger even now. Your success is not so certain. I have it in  my power to crush you, and your pride shall be broken.\"    So saying he took up the rouleau of gold he had given to Marguerite  and departed. Dumiger and Marguerite stood side by side, alarmed, but  still unbending; and yet the man who spoke to them was of great power.  To recite his titles once more:--Grand Master of the Teutonic Knights,  President of the City Council; magnificent in his promise, fierce  in his resentments, unscrupulous in his means. For a moment Dumiger  looked at Marguerite as though he were disposed to yield to the  tyranny of that great man, but a glance from her reassured him; and  it was with a low but formal reverence that he opened the door to  the illustrious visitor, while Marguerite stood proud, haughty, and  reserved.    \"Did we do wisely?\" said Dumiger, when the door closed upon them.    \"Wisely!\" exclaimed Marguerite; \"oh, Dumiger, can you doubt it? I feel  myself worthier of you now that I was able to influence you in your  moment of uncertainty. I say moment, for I will not believe that, upon  reflection, you could have hesitated in your decision. Better risk  all and lose all than sacrifice the glorious object which you have in  view. Who would not prefer the greatness which must be yours, if you  succeed? and the count has at least taught us one thing, that success  is almost certain,--who would not prefer this to that wealth of which  he is so proud, and that eminence which it makes him giddy to stand  on? No, Dumiger, you were in the right; and come what may, you will  feel proud of your decision and self-denial.\"    \"It was you who decided for me,\" replied Dumiger, as he pressed her  lips fondly to his own.    He toiled throughout the day, and the dusk was settling over the town  when the last wheel was finished and the clock was completed.      CHAPTER IV.    It was late in the evening of the same day. Marguerite and Dumiger  were sitting by the fire together. The fire burnt so brightly that  it was not necessary to light the candles. Marguerite, with her eyes  closed and half reposing in Dumiger's arms, was enjoying all the  happiness which the sense of returning affection gives. The night was  somewhat changed since they first sat there. The rain beat against the  casement, and the wind whistled down the chimney. The more it rained  and blew, the closer crept Marguerite to Dumiger's side. It was  a picture of comfort; of that comfort which, alas! is so easily  destroyed by the breath of tyranny. It was a type of the many hearths  which are covered with ruins when the trumpet sounds through the city  and the tocsin rings to arms; when war or rebellion sweeps like a  pestilence, not alone over the ruins of palaces and of senate-houses,  but over the abodes of the humble, where every room can tell a tale of  affection and toil.    There was a knock at Dumiger's door, which made Marguerite start and  called all the color into her cheeks.    There was something ominous in the knock. It was a short, quick,  clear, and decisive knock. It was the knock of a man in authority; of  one who felt that although standing on the outside of the door, he had  a right to be within. Marguerite and Dumiger both looked at the fire,  as though they could read in its confused shapes the reason of this  interruption; but the result could not have been very satisfactory,  for neither spoke, while reluctantly Dumiger rose to open the dour,  and Marguerite followed his movements with intense anxiety.    The truth is that people are never thoroughly comfortable and happy  without a sense of the uncertainty of human happiness stealing over  them. We speak of those whose lives are not a succession of parties  of pleasure, of soft dreams and golden fulfillments--to such favored  ones all sense of happiness is deadened by satiety--but they who toil  through long, long days, and are blest with a few moments of repose,  value them so highly that they scarcely believe such happiness can  last.    Dumiger opened the door, and uttered a faint cry. Marguerite was in a  moment by his side.    He had, indeed, some cause for alarm. An officer of the Grande Court  de Justice stood there. There was no mistaking his character, for the  uniform of the myrmidons of that court was too well known to all the  inhabitants of Dantzic, and more especially to the poorer classes, who  gazed on them with awe, for they were in general stern, hard-featured,  and hard-hearted men, who did their duty without gentleness, and  rarely deserted a man when once they had him in their clutches.  Dumiger had made acquaintance with them of old on one or two  occasions, and the recollection was anything but agreeable.    The man entered the room very quickly, took his seat in Dumiger's  chair, and drew his missive from his pocket. It was Dumiger's bill to  Hoffman for a very large sum, which had been purchased by the Count.    \"What is this?\" gasped forth Dumiger; for, at the moment, the debt had  entirely escaped his recollection. \"Ach Gott!\" exclaimed Dumiger, \"is  it possible?\" but observing Marguerite standing by, pale, tearful, and  trembling, he restrained his impetuosity.    Dumiger rose and went to a drawer. He counted over, with the eagerness  of a miser, all the dollars which were kept there,--the few which had  remained after the expenses of the last fortnight. For some time past  he had devoted all his energies so entirely to the construction of the  clock, that the smallest receipts of his craft had been despised.    A cold perspiration stood on his forehead as he gazed upon his small  store. He knew too well, that by the laws of Dantzic the debtor was  either dragged to the common prison or all his goods were seized.  Either alternative was terrible. He looked round the room. On one side  stood the clock, the child of his mind and industry, on the other was  Marguerite, beautiful in her grief.    The man had lit a pipe, and was carelessly smoking.    \"Come,\" said the officer at last, as shaking out the ashes of his pipe  and drawing himself to his full stature, so as to give weight to his  authority--\"come, we have no time to lose, Herr Dumiger. The money or  the furniture, or to prison. Consult the pretty jungfrau there: but  you must come to a conclusion directly, for time presses and I have  several other little bits of business to perform to-night: so I will  light another pipe while you make up your minds.\"    It was no easy matter for Marguerite to bring her mind to a decision.  She thought on the one hand of the lonely nights she might have to  pass; on the other, of the irreparable loss the clock would be to  Dumiger. Dumiger clasped her hands in his own, and as his lips clung  to hers he exclaimed, \"Perish all things but love.\" He rose--he was  on the point of desiring the man to take away the clock in payment  of the debt, in the hope that he might redeem it on the morrow, when  the sudden thought struck him that the Count was the instigator of  this act. He caught hold of the man by one arm, which was hanging  listlessly"]]]
