Occasionally Lyons found some opportunity to  talk with him. On February 4, 1861, in an official letter to Russell,  Lyons reported at length an interview with Seward, in which the latter  had expressed his extreme confidence that the trouble in America was but  superficial and that union sentiment in the South would soon  prevail[86]. In a private letter of the same date, however, Lyons  asserted that Seward was indeed likely to be a very dangerous Secretary  of State. He had told Lyons that if European governments interfered to  protect their commerce, he could unite America by a foreign war in order  to resist such interference[87]. Again, on February 12, while himself  expressing hope that a solution might be found for the difficulties in  America, Lyons warned Russell that there were those who would solve  these difficulties by a foreign war, especially if foreign governments  refused to acknowledge a United States declaration without formal  blockade closing the Southern ports[88]. Writing privately, Lyons  exhibited great anxiety in regard to Seward's attitude and suggested  that the best safeguard would be close union by England and France, for  if these two governments took exactly the same stand in regard to trade,  Seward would hardly dare to carry out his threat[89].    Lyons' letter of February 4 called out from Russell an instruction in  which it was repeated that advice to either party should be withheld and  a strictly neutral attitude maintained, and Russell concluded by an  assertion that if the United States attempted a jingo policy toward  England, the British Cabinet would be tolerant because of its feeling of  strength but that \"blustering demonstrations\" must not be carried too  far[90]. Even as early as December, 1860, Russell had foreseen the  possibility of what he considered a mere jingo policy for home effect in  America. Now, however, upon the repeated expression of fears from Lyons  that this might be more than mere \"bunkum,\" Russell began to instruct  Lyons not to permit English dignity to be infringed, while at the same  time desiring him to be cautious against stirring American antagonism.  Lyons' earlier disquietude seems, indeed, to have passed away for a  time, and on February 26 he wrote that everyone was waiting to see what  Lincoln would do when inaugurated, that there was still hope of  compromise, and that in his own view this was still possible. In this  letter the tone is more important than the matter, and so far as Lyons  is concerned the tone is all distinctly hopeful, all favourable to a  resumption of normal relations between the North and South. He at least  had no hope of disruption, and no happiness in it[91].    Before this communication could reach England Russell had thoroughly  awakened to the seriousness of the American situation in relation to  British foreign trade. On March 9, writing privately to Lyons, he  stated, \"I hope you are getting on well with the new President. If he  blockades the Southern ports we shall be in a difficulty. But according  to all American doctrine it must be an actual blockade kept up by an  efficient force[92].\" Thus, before any act had really occurred in  America, the matter of a blockade was occupying the attention of British  statesmen. One difficulty at the time was that there was no one in  England qualified to speak for the new administration at Washington.  Dallas, the American Minister appointed under the Buchanan  administration, while, unlike some other diplomatic representatives  abroad, faithful to the cause of the United States, was nevertheless not  wholly trusted by Lincoln or by Seward, and was thus handicapped in  representing to Russell American conditions or intentions. Indeed he had  very little communication with Russell. Adams' nomination to England was  known to Lyons on March 20, for on that day he telegraphed to Russell,  \"Mr. Charles Francis Adams, of Massachusetts, is appointed Minister in  London. I think it a very good appointment[93].\" This news was received  in London on April 2, but over six weeks were yet to elapse before Adams  reached his post. The appointment of Adams, however, seemed to Lyons a  matter of congratulation in his hope that no vicious anti-British policy  would be indulged in by Seward. Ten days after his telegram, he wrote at  length to Russell, making an excellent statement and analysis in regard  to the character of Adams.         \"Mr. Adams is son of John Quincy Adams, the fifth P. of the       U.S., and grandson of John Adams, the second P. The       grandfather was the first Am. minister in England. The father       was one of the Plenipotentiaries who signed in London the       Convention of the 3rd July, 1815. Mr. Adams as a member of       the H. of R. for one of the districts of Mass., acted with       the less violent section of the 'Republican' Party. During       the last session of Congress he made a very remarkable       speech on the state of the Union, denying the reasonableness       of the complaints of the Southern States, but stating his       desire that every concession not inconsistent with honour and       principle should be made to them. He is considered to be a       man of great independence of character, and has the       reputation of being very tenacious of his own opinions. In       manner he is quiet and unassuming. He is a man of good       fortune. Mrs. Adams comes of a considerable family in Mass.,       of the name of Brooks. The late wife of Mr. Edward Everett,       who, as your L. is aware, has held the offices of Minister in       London and Secretary of State, was her sister[94].\"    Similar characterizations were being forwarded at almost the same time  by Bunch in regard to the Southern Commissioners, now being despatched  to London, but they were not so favourable. Mann, wrote Bunch, was the  son of a \"bankrupt grocer.\" His personal character was \"not good,\" yet  he alone of the three Commissioners appointed had had diplomatic  experience. Yancey, it was stated, was an able lawyer, a stirring  orator, and a recognized leader of the secession movement, but he was  also extremely pro-slavery in his views, had expressed himself in favour  of a renewal of the slave trade, and throughout his career had been a  \"manifest destiny\" man. Of Rost, Bunch had no knowledge. In conclusion  Bunch described the extreme confidence expressed in the South in \"King  Cotton,\" and in rather bitter criticism stated that the Southern  Commissioners thought even England, the foe of slavery, would now be  compelled to bend the knee and recognize the South in order to get  cotton[95].    The Northern British Consuls on the other hand took an astonishingly  pro-Northern view of the whole situation. Archibald, consul at New York,  wrote to Russell soon after the fall of Sumter, an exceedingly strong  statement of his faith in the power of the North and its fixed and  unalterable determination to force the South back into the Union, his  confidence in Northern success, and his belief in the justice of the  Northern cause. He ventured to suggest the proper policy for England to  pursue, viz., to offer immediately her services in mediation but wholly  and clearly on the side of the North. He stated that if England did not  feel free to offer mediation, she should at least show \"such a  consistent and effective demonstration of sympathy and aid\" for the  North as would help in shortening the war[96]. The British Consul at  Boston wrote to Russell in much the same vein. So far, indeed, did these  men go in expressing their sympathy with the North, that Lyons, on April  27, commented to Russell that these consuls had \"taken the Northern War  Fever,\" and that he had mildly reproved Archibald[97].    With the inauguration of Lincoln on March 4, and the installation of  Seward as Secretary of State, it was possible for Lyons to become more  active in his efforts to prevent a disruption of British Trade. On March  20 he told Seward in a confidential conversation:         \"... If the United States determined to stop by force so       important a commerce as that of Great Britain with the       cotton-growing States, I could not answer for what       might happen.         \"... It was, however, a matter of the greatest consequence to       England to procure cheap cotton. If a considerable rise were       to take place in the price of cotton, and British ships were       to be at the same time excluded from the Southern Ports, an       immense pressure would be put upon Her Majesty's Government       to use all the means in their power to open those ports. If       Her Majesty's Government felt it to be their duty to do so,       they would naturally endeavour to effect their object in a       manner as consistent as possible, first with their friendly       feelings towards both Sections of this Country, and secondly       with the recognized principles of International Law. As       regards the latter point in particular, it certainly appeared       that the most simple, if not the only way, would be to       recognize the Southern Confederacy[98].\"    This was plain speaking, and Lyons' threat of recognizing the South did  not at the moment stir Seward to any retort. But five days later, on  March 25, Lyons gave a dinner to Seward and a number of the foreign  Ministers, and there Seward's violent talk about seizing any and all  ships that tried to trade with the South, even if there was no blockade,  made Lyons very anxious. As a host he diverted the conversation lest it  become too acrimonious, but he himself told Seward         \"... that it was really a matter so very serious that I was"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/13796"],[0,"International Weekly Miscellany of Literature, Art and Science - Volume 1, No. (#13)"],[1," still. \"I'm  sure I saw it!\" cried he, and again made a dash with both hands into a  fresh place, and began to distribute the ashes and dust and rubbish on  every side, to the great merriment of all the rest.    \"What did you see, Jemmy?\" asked old Doubleyear, in a compassionate  tone.    \"Oh, I don't know,\" said the boy, \"only it was like a bit of something  made of real gold!\"    A fresh burst of laughter from the company assembled followed this  somewhat vague declaration, to which the dustmen added one or two  elegant epithets, expressive of their contempt of the notion that they  could have overlooked a bit of anything valuable in the process of  emptying sundry dust-holes, and carting them away.    \"Ah,\" said one of the sifters, \"poor Jem's always a-fancying something  or other good but it never comes.\"    \"Didn't I find three cats this morning?\" cried Jem, \"two on 'em white  'uns! How you go on!\"    \"I meant something quite different from the like o' that,\" said the  other; \"I was a-thinking of the rare sights all you three there have  had, one time and another.\"    The wind having changed, and the day become bright, the party at work  all seemed disposed to be more merry than usual. The foregoing remark  excited the curiosity of several of the sifters, who had recently  joined the \"company\": the parties alluded to were requested to favor  them with the recital; and though the request was made with only a  half-concealed irony, still it was all in good-natured pleasantry, and  was immediately complied with. Old Doubleyear spoke first:    \"I had a bad night of it with the rats some years ago--they runn'd  all over the floor, and over the bed, and one on 'em come'd and guv a  squeak close into my ear--so I couldn't sleep comfortable. I wouldn't  ha' minded a trifle of it, but this was too much of a good thing.  So I got up before sunrise, and went out for a walk; and thinking I  might as well be near our work-place, I slowly come'd down this way!  I worked in a brick-field at that time, near the canal yonder. The sun  was just a rising up behind the Dust-heap as I got in sight of it,  and soon it rose above, and was very bright; and though I had two eyes  then, I was obligated to shut them both. When I opened them again, the  sun was higher up; but in his haste to get over the Dust-heap, he had  dropped something. You may laugh--I say he dropped something. Well  I can't say what it was, in course--a bit of his-self, I suppose.  It was just like him--a bit on him, I mean--quite as bright--just  the same--only not so big. And not up in the sky, but a-lying and  sparkling all on fire upon the Dust-heap. Thinks I--I was a younger  man then by some years than I am now--I'll go and have a nearer look.  Though you be a bit o' the sun, maybe you won't hurt a poor man. So  I walked toward the Dust-heap, and up I went, keeping the piece of  sparkling fire in sight all the while. But before I got up to it, the  sun went behind a cloud--and as he went out--like, so the young 'un  he had dropped, went out arter him. And I had to climb up the heap for  nothing, though I had marked the place vere it lay very percizely. But  there was no signs at all on him, and no morsel left of the light as  had been there. I searched all about; but found nothing 'cept a bit 'o  broken glass as had got stuck in the heel of an old shoe. And that's  my story. But if ever a man saw anything at all, I saw a bit o' the  sun; and I thank God for it. It was a blessed sight for a poor ragged  old man of threescore and ten, which was my age at that time.\"    \"Now, Peggy!\" cried several voices, \"tell us what you saw. Peg saw a  bit o' the moon.\"    \"No,\" said Mrs. Dotting, rather indignantly; \"I'm no moon-raker. Not  a sign of the moon was there, nor a spark of a star the time I speak  on.\"    \"Well--go on, Peggy--go on.\"    \"I don't know as I will,\" said Peggy.    But being pacified by a few good-tempered, though somewhat humorous,  compliments, she thus favored them with her little adventure:    \"There was no moon, or stars, or comet, in the 'versal heavens, nor  lamp nor lantern along the road, when I walked home one winter's night  from the cottage of Widow Pin, where I had been to tea with her and  Mrs. Dry, as lived in the almshouses. They wanted Davy, the son of  Bill Davy the milkman, to see me home with the lantern, but I wouldn't  let him, 'cause of his sore throat. Throat!--no it wasn't his throat  as was rare sore--it was--no, it wasn't--yes, it was--it was his toe  as was sore. His big toe. A nail out of his boot had got into it. I  _told_ him he'd be sure to have a bad toe, if he didn't go to church  more regular, but he wouldn't listen; and so my words come'd true.  But, as I was a-saying, I wouldn't let him by reason of his sore  throat--toe, I mean--and as I went along, the night seemed to grow  darker and darker. A straight road, though, and I was so used to it by  day-time, it didn't matter for the darkness. Hows'ever, when I come'd  near the bottom of the Dust-heap as I had to pass, the great dark  heap was so 'zackly the same as the night, you couldn't tell one  from t'other. So, thinks I to myself--_what_ was I thinking of at  this moment?--for the life o' me I can't call it to mind; but that's  neither here nor there, only for this--it was a something that led me  to remember the story of how the devil goes about like a roaring lion.  And while I was a-hoping he might not he out a-roaring that night,  what should I see rise out of one side of the Dust-heap, but a  beautiful shining star, of a violet color. I stood as still, as  stock-still as any I don't-know-what! There it lay, as beautiful as  a new-born babe, all a-shining in the dust! By degrees I got courage  to go a little nearer--and then a little nearer still--for, says I  to myself, I'm a sinful woman, I know, but I have repented, and do  repent constantly of all the sins of my youth and the backslidings  of my age--which have been numerous; and once I had a very heavy  backsliding--but that's neither here nor there. So, as I was a-saying,  having collected all my sinfulness of life, and humbleness before  Heaven, into a goodish bit of courage, forward I steps--a little  furder--and a leetle furder more--_un_-til I come'd just up to the  beautiful shining star lying upon the dust. Well, it was a long time I  stood a-looking down at it, before I ventured to do what I arterwards  did. But at last I did stoop down with both hands slowly--in case  it might burn, or bite--and gathering up a good scoop of ashes as  my hands went along. I took it up, and began a-carrying it home, all  shining before me, and with a soft blue mist rising up round about it.  Heaven forgive me! I was punished for meddling with what Providence  had sent for some better purpose than to be carried borne by an old  woman like me, whom it had pleased Heaven to afflict with the loss  of one leg, and the pain, ixpinse, and inconvenience of a wooden one.  Well, I _was_ punished; covetousness had its reward; for, presently,  the violet light got very pale, and then went out; and when I reached  home, still holding in both hands all I had gathered up, and when I  took it to the candle, it had burned into the red shell of a lobsky's  head, and its two black eyes poked up at me with a long stare--and I  may say, a strong smell, too--enough to knock a poor body known.\"    Great applause, and no little laughter, followed the conclusion of old  Peggy's story, but she did not join in the merriment. She said it was  all very well for young folks to laugh, but at her age she had enough  to do to pray; and she had never said so many prayers, nor with so  much fervency, as she had done since she received the blessed sight  of the blue star on the Dust-heap, and the chastising rod of the  lobster's head at home.    Little Jem's turn now came: the poor lad was, however, so excited by  the recollection of what his companions called \"Jem's Ghost,\" that he  was unable to describe it in any coherent language. To his imagination  it had been a lovely vision,--the one \"bright consummate flower\" of  his life, which he treasured up as the most sacred image in his heart.  He endeavored, in wild and hasty words, to set forth, how that he had  been bred a chimney-sweep; that one Sunday afternoon he had left a set  of companions, most on 'em sweeps, who were all playing at marbles in  the church-yard, and he had wandered to the Dust-heap, where he had  fallen asleep; that he was awoke by a sweet voice in the air, which  said something about some one having lost her way!--that he, being now  wide awake, looked up, and saw with his own eyes a young Angel, with  fair hair and rosy cheeks, and large white wings at her shoulders,  floating about like bright clouds, rise out of the dust! She had on  a garment of shining crimson, which changed as he looked upon her  to shining gold. She then exclaimed, with a joyful smile, \"I see the  right way!\" and the next moment the Angel was gone!    As the sun was just now very bright and warm for the time of year,  and shining full upon the Dust-heap in its setting, one of the men  endeavored to raise a laugh at the deformed lad, by asking him if he  didn't expect to see just such another angel at this minute, who had  lost her way in the field on the other side of the heap; but his jest  failed. The earnestness and devout emotion of the boy to the vision of  reality which his imagination, aided by the hues of sunset, had thus  exalted, were too much for the gross spirit of banter, and the speaker  shrunk back into his dust-shovel, and affected to be very assiduous in  his work.    Before the day's work was ended, however, little Jem again had a  glimpse of the prize which had escaped him on the previous occasion.  He instantly darted, hands and head foremost, into the mass of cinders  and rubbish, and brought up a black mass of half-burnt parchment,  entwined with vegetable refuse, from"]]]
