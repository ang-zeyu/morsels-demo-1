It is not the fact of these people's immature ideas that has  caused these remarks on our part, but rather their tendency to set up  their puny conceptions as the absolute truth, and then insisting upon  forcing these views upon the outer world of men, whom they consider  \"poor ignorant heathen.\" Permit each man to think according to his  light--and help him by offering to share with him the best that you  possess--but do not attempt to force upon him your own views as  absolute truth to be swallowed by him under threat of damnation or  eternal punishment. Who are you that dares to speak of punishment and  damnation, when the smell of the smoke of the hell of materialism is  still upon your robes. When you realize just what spiritual infants you  still are--the best of you--you will blush at these things. Hold fast  to the best that you know--be generous to others who seem to wish to  share your knowledge--but give without blame or feeling of  superiority--for those whom you teach today may be your teachers  tomorrow--there are many surprises of this kind along The Path. Be  brave and confident, but when you begin to feel puffed up by your  acquirement of some new bit of knowledge, let your prayer--_our_  prayer, for we too are infants--be, \"Lord, be merciful unto me, a  fool!\"    The above words are for us, the students of the Yogi Philosophy--the  teachers of the same--for human nature is the same in spite of names,  and we must avoid the \"vanity of vanities\"--Spiritual Pride and  Arrogance--that fault which has sent many a soul tumbling headlong from  a high position on The Path, and compelled it to again begin the  journey, chastened and bruised. The fall of Lucifer has many  correspondences upon the occult plane, and is, indeed, in itself an  allegorical illustration of just this law. Remember, always, that you  are but a Centre in the Ocean of Life, and that all others are Centres  in the same ocean, and that underlying both and all of you is the same  calm bed of Life and Knowledge, the property of all. The highest and  the lowest are part of the same One Life--each of you has the same life  blood flowing through your veins--you are connected with every other  form of life, high or low, with invisible bonds, and none is separate  from another. We are speaking, of course, to the personalities of the  various students who are reading these words. The Real Self of each is  above the need of such advice and caution, and those who are able to  reach the Real Self in consciousness have no need for these words, for  they have outlived this stage of error. To many, the consciousness of  the One Life--the Universal Life--in which all are centres of  consciousness and being--has come gradually as a final step of a long  series of thought and reasoning, aided by flashes of truth from the  higher regions of the mind. To others it has come as a great  illumination, or flash of Truth, in which all things are seen in their  proper relations and positions to each other, and all as phases of  being in the One. The term \"Cosmic Consciousness,\" which has been used  in the previous series of these lessons, and by other writers, means  this sudden flash of \"knowing\" in which all the illusionary dividing  lines between persons and things are broken down and the Universal Life  is seen to be actually existent as One Life. To those who have reached  this consciousness by either route just mentioned--or by other  routes--there is no sense of loss of individuality or power or  strength. On the contrary there is always a new sense of increased  power and strength and knowing--instead of losing Individuality, there  is a sense of having found it. One feels that he has the whole Universe  at his back, or within him, rather than that he has lost his identity  in the great Ocean of Life.    While we are speaking of this phase of the subject, we should like to  ask you if you have ever investigated and inquired into the real  meaning of the much-used word \"Individuality?\" Have you ever looked up  its origin and real meaning, as given by the standard authorities? We  are sure that many of you have no real idea of the actual meaning of  the term, as strange as this statement may appear to you at first  glance. Stop now, and define the word to yourself, as you have been  accustomed to think of it. Ninety-five people of a hundred will tell  you that it means something like \"a strong personality.\" Let us see  about this.    Webster defines the word \"Individual\" as follows: \"Not divided, or not  to be divided; existing as one distinct being or object; single; one.\"  The same authority informs us that the word arises from the Latin word  _individuus_, meaning \"indivisible; not divisible.\" Does not this help  you to gain a clearer idea of the Individuality that knows itself to be  a Centre of Consciousness in the One Life, rather than a separate,  puny, insignificant thing apart from all other centres or forms of  Life, or the source of Life? We think it will help to clear your mind  of some of the fog that has not as yet lifted itself.    And while we are on the subject of definitions, let us take a little  look at the word \"Personality,\" that is generally believed to be a  synonym of \"Individuality,\" and is often so used. Webster tells us that  the word \"Person\" originated from the Latin word _persona_, meaning \"a  mask used by actors,\" which word in turn arose from two other words,  _per_, meaning \"through,\" and _sonare_, meaning \"to sound,\" the two  combined words meaning \"to sound through.\" The same authority informs  us that the archaic meaning of the word was \"a character or part, as in  a play; an assumed character.\" If you will think of Personality as \"a  mask used by an actor,\" or as \"a part in a play,\" or as something used  to \"sound through\" or to speak through, by the real Individual behind  the mask of Personality, then perhaps you will see a little further  into the Mystery of Personality and Individuality.    Oh, dear students, be not deceived by the mask of Personality which you  may happen to be wearing at this moment, or by the masks which are worn  by those around you. Realize that back of your mask is the great  Individual--the Indivisible--the Universal Life, in which you are a  centre of consciousness and activity. This does not wipe out your  identity--instead it gives you a greater and grander identity. Instead  of your sinking into a Nirvana of extinction of consciousness, your  consciousness so enlarges as you unfold, that you will in the end feel  your identity to be the identity of the Universe. Instead of your  gaining Nothingness, you gain Allness. All spiritual growth and  unfoldment gives you a constantly increasing sense of relationship  with, and agreement with, the All. You grow into Allness as you unfold.  Be not deceived by this chatter about Nothingness, and loss of  Individuality, in the Oriental thought, although some of the  presentations of its teachings may so seem to mean at first reading.  Remember always that Personality is the mask, and Individuality the  Real One.    You have often heard persons, claiming to be acquainted with the  teachings of Theosophy and other expositions of the Oriental Wisdom  Religion (including our own presentation), asserting that the Oriental  mind was ever bent upon attaining a final stage of Nothingness or  Extinction in Nirvana. In addition to what we have said, and to what we  shall say on this subject, let us quote from the inspired writer of the  \"_Secret Doctrine_\" (a standard Theosophical work) when she says, in  that work on page 286, Vol. I: \"Is this annihilation, as some think?  ... To see in Nirvana annihilation, amounts to saying of a man plunged  in a sound, dreamless sleep--one that leaves no impression on the  physical memory and brain, because the sleeper's Higher Self is in its  original state of absolute consciousness during these hours--that he  too is annihilated. The latter simile answers only to one side of the  question--the most material; since reabsorption is by no means such a  dreamless sleep, but, on the contrary, absolute existence, an  unconditional unity, or a state, to describe which human language is  absolutely and hopelessly inadequate... Nor is the individuality--nor  even the essence of the personality, if any be left behind--lost  because re-absorbed.\" As J. Wm. Lloyd says, in connection with the  above quotation, \"This seems conclusive proof that Theosophy does not  regard Nirvana as annihilation, but as an infinite enlargement of  consciousness.\" And we would add that this is true not only as regards  the Nirvana of the Theosophist, but also of the consciousness of the  Unity of Life--the Universal Life. This too is not annihilation of  individual consciousness, but an \"infinite enlargement of  consciousness\" as this Western writer Lloyd has so well expressed it.    The very consciousness of Life that every man feels within him, comes  not from something belonging exclusively to himself as a separate or  personal thing. On the contrary, it belongs to his Individuality, not  to his Personality, and is a phase of his consciousness or \"awareness\"  of his relation to the One Universal Life which underlies his  existence, and in which he is a center of consciousness. Do you grasp  this idea? If not, meditate and concentrate upon it, for it is  important. You must learn to _feel_ the Life within you, and to know  that it is the Life of the great Ocean of Universal Life upon the bosom  of which you are borne as a centre of consciousness and energy. In this  thought there is Power, Strength, Calm, Peace, and Wisdom. Acquire it,  if you are wise. It is indeed a Gift from the Gods.    In this lesson we are not attempting to build up your idea of the Unity  of Life by a series of arguments taken from a world of phenomena in  which separateness and non-Unity is apparent."]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/13444"],[0,"Searchlights on Health: The Science of Eugenics (#13)"],[1,"TENESS.      1. BEAUTIFUL BEHAVIOR.--Politeness has been described as the art of  showing, by external signs, the internal regard we have for others.  But one may be perfectly polite to another without necessarily paying  a special regard for him. Good manners are neither more nor less than  beautiful behavior. It has been well said that \"a beautiful form is  better than a beautiful face, and a beautiful behavior is better  than a beautiful form; it gives a higher pleasure than statues or  pictures--it is the finest of the fine arts.\"    2. TRUE POLITENESS.--The truest politeness comes of sincerity. It must  be the outcome of the heart, or it will make no lasting impression;  for no amount of polish can dispense with truthfulness. The natural  character must be allowed to appear, freed of its angularities and  asperities. Though politeness, in its best form, should resemble  water--\"best when clearest, most simple, and without taste\"--yet  genius in a man will always cover many defects of manner, and much  will be excused to the strong and the original. Without genuineness  and individuality, human life would lose much of its interest and  variety, as well as its manliness and robustness of character.    3. PERSONALITY OF OTHERS.--True politeness especially exhibits itself  in regard for the personality of others. A man will respect the  individuality of another if he wishes to be respected himself. He will  have due regard for his views and opinions, even though they differ  from his own. The well-mannered man pays a compliment to another, and  sometimes even secures his respect by patiently listening to him. He  is simply tolerant and forbearant, and refrains from judging harshly;  and harsh judgments of others will almost invariably provoke harsh  judgments of ourselves.    4. THE IMPOLITE.--The impolite, impulsive man will, however, sometimes  rather lose his friend than his joke. He may surely be pronounced  a very foolish person who secures another's hatred at the price  of a moment's gratification. It was a saying of Burnel, the  engineer--himself one of the kindest-natured of men--that \"spite and  ill-nature are among the most expensive luxuries in life.\" Dr. Johnson  once said: \"Sir, a man has no more right to say a rude thing to  another than to knock him down.\"    5. FEELINGS OF OTHERS.--Want of respect for the feelings of others  usually originates in selfishness, and issues in hardness and  repulsiveness of manner. It may not proceed from malignity so much, as  from want of sympathy, and want of delicacy--a want of that perception  of, and attention to, those little and apparently trifling things, by  which pleasure is given or pain occasioned to others. Indeed, it may  be said that in self-sacrifice in the ordinary intercourse of life,  mainly consists the difference between being well and ill bred.  Without some degree of self-restraint in society a man may be found  almost insufferable. No one has pleasure in holding intercourse with  such a person, and he is a constant source of annoyance to those about  him.    6. DISREGARD OF OTHERS.--Men may show their disregard to others in  various impolite ways, as, for instance, by neglect of propriety in  dress, by the absence of cleanliness, or by indulging in repulsive  habits. The slovenly, dirty person, by rendering himself physically  disagreeable, sets the tastes and feelings of others at defiance, and  is rude and uncivil, only under another form.    7. THE BEST SCHOOL OF POLITENESS.--The first and best school of  politeness, as of character, is always the home, where woman is the  teacher. The manners of society at large are but the reflex of the  manners of our collective homes, neither better nor worse. Yet, with  all the disadvantages of ungenial homes, men may practice self-culture  of manner as of intellect, and learn by good examples to cultivate a  graceful and agreeable behavior towards others. Most men are like so  many gems in the rough, which need polishing by contact with other and  better natures, to bring out their full beauty and lustre. Some have  but one side polished, sufficient only to show the delicate graining  of the interior; but to bring out the full qualities of the gem, needs  the discipline of experience, and contact with the best examples of  character in the intercourse of daily life.    8. CAPTIOUSNESS OF MANNER.--While captiousness of manner, and the  habit of disputing and contradicting every thing said, is chilling and  repulsive, the opposite habit of assenting to, and sympathizing  with, every statement made, or emotion expressed, is almost equally  disagreeable. It is unmanly, and is felt to be dishonest. \"It may seem  difficult,\" says Richard Sharp, \"to steer always between bluntness and  plain dealing, between merited praises and lavishing indiscriminate  flattery; but it is very easy--good humor, kindheartedness, and  perfect simplicity, being all that are requisite to do what is right  in the right way. At the same time many are impolite, not because  they mean to be so, but because they are awkward, and perhaps know no  better.\"    9. SHY PEOPLE.--Again many persons are thought to be stiff, reserved,  and proud, when they are only shy. Shyness is characteristic of  most people of the Teutonic race. From all that can be learned of  Shakespeare, it is to be inferred that he was an exceedingly shy man.  The manner in which his plays were sent into the world--for it is not  known that he edited or authorized the publication of a single one  of them,--and the dates at which they respectively appeared, are mere  matters of conjecture.    10. SELF-FORGETFULNESS.--True politeness is best evinced by  self-forgetfulness, or self-denial in the interest of others. Mr.  Garfield, our martyred president, was a gentleman of royal type. His  friend, Col. Rockwell, says of him: \"In, the midst of his suffering he  never forgets others. For instance, to-day he said to me, 'Rockwell,  there is a poor soldier's widow who came to me before this thing  occurred, and I promised her, she should be provided for. I want you  to see that the matter is attended to at once.' He is the most docile  patient I ever saw.\"    11. ITS BRIGHT SIDE.--We have thus far spoken of shyness as a defect.  But there is another way of looking at it; for even shyness has its  bright side, and contains an element of good. Shy men and shy races  are ungraceful and undemonstrative, because, as regards society at  large, they are comparatively unsociable. They do not possess those  elegancies of manner acquired by free intercourse, which distinguish  the social races, because their tendency is to shun society rather  than to seek it. They are shy in the presence of strangers, and shy  even in their own families. They hide their affections under a robe  of reserve, and when they do give way to their feelings, it is only in  some very hidden inner chamber. And yet, the feelings are there, and  not the less healthy and genuine, though they are not made the subject  of exhibition to others.    12. WORTHY OF CULTIVATION.--While, therefore, grace of manner,  politeness of behavior, elegance of demeanor, and all the arts  that contribute to make life pleasant and beautiful, are worthy of  cultivation, it must not be at the expense of the more solid and  enduring qualities of honesty, sincerity, and truthfulness. The  fountain of beauty must be in the heart more than in the eye, and if  it does not tend to produce beautiful life and noble practice, it will  prove of comparatively little avail. Politeness of manner is not worth  much, unless it is accompanied by polite actions.             *       *       *       *       *    INFLUENCE OF GOOD CHARACTER.        \"Unless above himself he can    Erect himself, how poor a thing is man!    --DANIEL.      \"Character is moral order seen through the medium of an individual    nature--Men of character are the conscience of the society to    which they belong.\"    --EMERSON.      The purest treasure mortal times afford,    Is--spotless reputation; that away,    Men are but gilded loam, or painted clay,    A jewel in a ten-times-barr'd-up chest    Is--a bold Spirit in a loyal breast.    --SHAKESPEARE.      1. REPUTATION.--The two most precious things this side the grave are  our reputation and our life. But it is to be lamented that the most  contemptible whisper may deprive us of the one, and the weakest weapon  of the other. A wise man, therefore, will be more anxious to deserve  a fair name than to possess it, and this will teach him so to live, as  not to be afraid to die.    2. CHARACTER.--Character is one of the greatest motive powers in the  world. In its noblest embodiments, it exemplifies human nature in its  highest forms, for it exhibits man at his best.    3. THE HEART THAT RULES IN LIFE.--Although genius always commands  admiration, character most secures respect. The former is more the  product of brain power, the latter of heart power; and in the long run  it is the heart that rules in life. Men of genius stand to society in  the relation of its intellect as men of character of its conscience:  and while the former are admired, the latter are followed.    4. THE HIGHEST IDEAL OF LIFE AND CHARACTER.--Common-place though it  may appear, this doing of one's duty embodies the highest ideal of  life and character. There may be nothing heroic about it; but the  common lot of men is not heroic. And though the abiding sense of duty  upholds man in his highest attitudes, it also equally sustains him in  the transaction of the ordinary affairs of every-day existence.  Man's life is \"centered in the sphere of common duties.\" The most  influential of all the virtues are those which are the most in request  for daily use. They wear the best, and last the longest.    5. WEALTH.--Wealth in the hands of men of weak purpose, or deficient  self-control, or of ill regulated passions is only a temptation and a  snare--the"]]]
