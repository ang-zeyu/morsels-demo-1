This is now the usual mode of dressing terrapins  in Maryland, Virginia, and many other parts of the South, and will be  found superior to any other. If there are no eggs in the terrapin,  \"egg balls\" may be substituted. (See recipe.)      STEWED TERRAPIN, WITH CREAM.    Place in a saucepan, two heaping tablespoonfuls of butter and one of  dry flour; stir it over the fire until it bubbles; then gradually stir  in a pint of cream, a teaspoonful of salt, a quarter of a teaspoonful  of white pepper, the same of grated nutmeg, and a very small pinch of  cayenne. Next, put in a pint of terrapin meat and stir all until it is  scalding hot. Move the saucepan to the back part of the stove or  range, where the contents will keep hot but not boil; then stir in  four well-beaten yolks of eggs; do not allow the terrapin to boil  after adding the eggs, but pour it immediately into a tureen  containing a gill of good Madeira and a tablespoonful of lemon juice.  Serve hot.      STEWED TERRAPIN.    Plunge the terrapins alive into boiling water, and let them remain  until the sides and lower shell begin to crack--this will take less  than an hour; then remove them and let them get cold; take off the  shell and outer skin, being careful to save all the blood possible in  opening them. If there are eggs in them put them aside in a dish; take  all the inside out, and be very careful not to break the gall, which  must be immediately removed or it will make the rest bitter. It lies  within the liver. Then cut up the liver and all the rest of the  terrapin into small pieces, adding the blood and juice that have  flowed out in cutting up; add half a pint of water; sprinkle a little  flour over them as you place them in the stewpan; let them stew slowly  ten minutes, adding salt, black and cayenne pepper, and a very small  blade of mace; then add a gill of the best brandy and half a pint of  the very best sherry wine; let it simmer over a slow fire very gently.  About ten minutes or so, before you are ready to dish them, add half a  pint of rich cream, and half a pound of sweet butter, with flour, to  prevent boiling; two or three minutes before taking them off the fire  peel the eggs carefully and throw them in whole. If there should be no  eggs use the yolks of hens' eggs, hard boiled. This recipe is for four  terrapins.    _Rennert's Hotel, Baltimore._    [Illustration: BASTING THE TURKEY.]      OILED LOBSTER.    Put a handful of salt into a large kettle or pot of boiling water.  When the water boils very hard put in the lobster, having first  brushed it and tied the claws together with a bit of twine. Keep it  boiling from twenty minutes to half an hour, in proportion to its  size. If boiled too long the meat will be hard and stringy. When it is  done take it out, lay it on its claws to drain, and then wipe it dry.    It is scarcely necessary to mention that the head of a lobster and  what are called the lady fingers are not to be eaten.    Very large lobsters are not the best, the meat being coarse and tough.  The male is best for boiling; the flesh is firmer and the shell a  brighter red. It may readily be distinguished from the female; the  tail is narrower, and the two uppermost fins within the tail are stiff  and hard. Those of the hen lobster are not so, and the tail is  broader.    Hen lobsters are preferred for sauce or salad, on account of their  coral. The head and small claws are never used.    They should be alive and freshly caught when put into the boiling  kettle. After being cooked and cooled, split open the body and tail  and crack the claws, to extract the meat. The sand pouch found near  the throat should be removed. Care should be exercised that none of  the feathery, tough, gill-like particles found under the body shell  get mixed with the meat, as they are indigestible and have caused much  trouble. They are supposed to be the cause of so-called poisoning from  eating lobster.    Serve on a platter. Lettuce and other concomitants of a salad should  also be placed on the table or platter.      SCALLOPED LOBSTER.    Butter a deep dish and cover the bottom with fine bread crumbs; put on  this a layer of chopped lobster, with pepper and salt; so on,  alternately, until the dish is filled, having crumbs on top. Put on  bits of butter, moisten with milk and bake about twenty minutes.      DEVILED LOBSTER.    Take out all the meat from a boiled lobster, reserving the coral;  season highly with mustard, cayenne, salt and some kind of table  sauce; stew until well mixed and put it in a covered saucepan, with  just enough hot water to keep from burning; rub the coral smooth,  moistening with vinegar until it is thin enough to pour easily, then  stir it into the saucepan. The dressing should be prepared before the  meat is put on the fire, and which ought to boil but once before the  coral is put in; stir in a heaping teaspoonful of butter, and when it  boils again it is done and should be taken up at once, as too much  cooking toughens the meat.      LOBSTER CROQUETTES.    Take any of the lobster remaining from table and pound it until the  dark, light meat and coral are well mixed; put with it not quite as  much fine bread crumbs; season with pepper, salt and a very little  cayenne pepper; add a little melted butter, about two tablespoonfuls  if the bread is rather dry; form into egg-shaped or round balls; roll  them in egg, then in fine crumbs, and fry in boiling lard.      LOBSTER PATTIES.    Cut some boiled lobster in small pieces; then take the small claws and  the spawn, put them in a suitable dish, and jam them to a paste with a  potato masher. Now add to them a ladleful of gravy or broth, with a  few bread crumbs; set it over the fire and boil; strain it through a  strainer, or sieve, to the thickness of a cream, and put half of it to  your lobsters, and save the other half to sauce them with after they  are baked. Put to the lobster the bigness of an egg of butter, a  little pepper and salt; squeeze in a lemon, and warm these over the  fire enough to melt the butter, set it to cool, and sheet your patty  pan or a plate or dish with good puff paste, then put in your lobster,  and cover it with a paste; bake it within three-quarters of an hour  before you want it; when it is baked, cut up your cover, and warm up  the other half of your sauce above mentioned, with a little butter, to  the thickness of cream, and pour it over your patty, with a little  squeezed lemon; cut your cover in two, and lay it on the top, two  inches distant, so that what is under may be seen. You may bake  crawfish, shrimps or prawns the same way; and they are all proper for  plates or little dishes for a second course.      LOBSTER A LA NEWBURG.    Take one whole lobster, cut up in pieces about as large as a hickory  nut. Put in the same pan with a piece of butter size of a walnut,  season with salt and pepper to taste, and thicken with heavy cream  sauce; add the yolk of one egg and two oz. of sherry wine.    Cream sauce for above is made as follows: 1 oz. butter, melted in  saucepan; 2 oz. flour, mixed with butter, thin down to proper  consistency with boiling cream.    _Rector's Oyster House, Chicago._      BAKED CRABS.    Mix with the contents of a can of crabs, bread crumbs or pounded  crackers. Pepper and salt the whole to taste; mince some cold ham;  have the baking pan well buttered, place therein first a layer of the  crab meat, prepared as above, then a layer of the minced ham, and so  on, alternately until the pan is filled. Cover the top with bread  crumbs and bits of butter, and bake.      DEVILED CRABS.    Half a dozen fresh crabs, boiled and minced, two ounces of butter, one  small teaspoonful of mustard powder; cayenne pepper and salt to taste.  Put the meat into a bowl and mix carefully with it an equal quantity  of fine bread crumbs. Work the butter to a light cream, mix the  mustard well with it, then stir in very carefully, a handful at a  time, the mixed crabs, a tablespoonful of cream and crumbs. Season to  taste with cayenne pepper and salt; fill the crab shells with the  mixture, sprinkle bread crumbs over the tops, put three small pieces  of butter upon the top of each, and brown them quickly in a hot oven.  They will puff in baking and will be found very nice. Half the  quantity can be made. A crab shell will hold the meat of two crabs.      CRAB CROQUETTES.    Pick the meat of boiled crabs and chop it fine. Season to taste with  pepper, salt and melted butter. Moisten it well with rich milk or  cream, then stiffen it slightly with bread or cracker crumbs. Add two  or three well-beaten eggs to bind the mixture. Form the croquettes,  egg and bread, crumb them and fry them delicately in boiling lard. It  is better to use a wire frying basket for croquettes of all kinds.      TO MAKE A CRAB PIE.    Procure the crabs alive, and put them in boiling water, along with  some salt. Boil them for a quarter of an hour or twenty minutes,  according to the size. When cold pick the meat from the claws and  body. Chop all together, and mix it with crumbs of bread, pepper and  salt, and a little butter. Put all this into the shell and brown in a  hot oven. A crab shell will hold the meat of two crabs.      CRABS. (Soft Shell.)    Crabs may be boiled as lobsters. They make a fine dish when stewed.  Take out the meat from the shell, put it into a saucepan with butter,  pepper, salt, a pinch of mace and a very little water; dredge with  flour and let simmer five minutes over a slow fire. Serve hot; garnish  the dish with the claws laid around it.    The usual way of cooking them is frying them in plenty of butter and  lard mixed; prepare them the same as frying fish. The spongy substance  from the sides should be taken off, also the sand bag. Fry a nice  brown and garnish with parsley.      OYSTERS.    Oysters must be fresh and fat to be good. They are in season from  September "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/13937"],[0,"The Mysterious Rider (#13)"],[1,"a brook ran near an aspen thicket. He had no desire  to hurry to meet events at White Slides Ranch, although he longed to see  this girl that belonged to Belllounds. Night settled down over the quiet  foothills. A pack of roving coyotes visited Wade, and sat in a  half-circle in the shadows back of the camp-fire. They howled and  barked. Nevertheless sleep visited Wade's tired eyelids the moment he  lay down and closed them.           *       *       *       *       *    Next morning, rather late, Wade rode down to White Slides Ranch. It  looked to him like the property of a rich rancher who held to the old  and proven customs of his generation. The corrals were new, but their  style was old. Wade reflected that it would be hard for rustlers or  horse-thieves to steal out of those corrals. A long lane led from the  pasture-land, following the brook that ran through the corrals and by  the back door of the rambling, comfortable-looking cabin. A cowboy was  leading horses across a wide square between the main ranch-house and a  cluster of cabins and sheds. He saw the visitor and waited.    \"Mornin',\" said Wade, as he rode up.    \"Hod do,\" replied the cowboy.    Then these two eyed each other, not curiously nor suspiciously, but with  that steady, measuring gaze common to Western men.    \"My name's Wade,\" said the traveler. \"Come from Meeker way. I'm lookin'  for a job with Belllounds.\"    \"I'm Lem Billings,\" replied the other. \"Ridin' fer White Slides fer  years. Reckon the boss'll be glad to take you on.\"    \"Is he around?\"    \"Sure. I jest seen him,\" replied Billings, as he haltered his horses to  a post. \"I reckon I ought to give you a hunch.\"    \"I'd take that as a favor.\"    \"Wal, we're short of hands,\" said the cowboy. \"Jest got the round-up  over. Hudson was hurt an' Wils Moore got crippled. Then the boss's son  has been put on as foreman. Three of the boys quit. Couldn't stand him.  This hyar son of Belllounds is a son-of-a-gun! Me an' pards of mine,  Montana an' Bludsoe, are stickin' on--wal, fer reasons thet ain't  egzactly love fer the boss. But Old Bill's the best of bosses.... Now  the hunch is--thet if you git on hyar you'll hev to do two or three  men's work.\"    \"Much obliged,\" replied Wade. \"I don't shy at that.\"    \"Wal, git down an' come in,\" added Billings, heartily.    He led the way across the square, around the corner of the ranch-house,  and up on a long porch, where the arrangement of chairs and blankets  attested to the hand of a woman. The first door was open, and from it  issued voices; first a shrill, petulant boy's complaint, and then a  man's deep, slow, patient reply.    Lem Billings knocked on the door-jamb.    \"Wal, what's wanted?\" called Belllounds.    \"Boss, thar's a man wantin' to see you,\" replied Lem.    Heavy steps approached the doorway and it was filled with the large  figure of the rancher. Wade remembered Belllounds and saw only a gray  difference in years.    \"Good mornin', Lem, an' good moinin' to you, stranger,\" was the  rancher's greeting, his bold, blue glance, honest and frank and keen,  with all his long experience of men, taking Wade in with one flash.    Lem discreetly walked to the end of the porch as another figure, that of  the son who resembled the father, filled the doorway, with eyes less  kind, bent upon the visitor.    \"My name's Wade. I'm over from Meeker way, hopin' to find a job with  you,\" said Wade.    \"Glad to meet you,\" replied Belllounds, extending his huge hand to shake  Wade's. \"I need you, sure bad. What's your special brand of work?\"    \"I reckon any kind.\"    \"Set down, stranger,\" replied Belllounds, pulling up a chair. He seated  himself on a bench and leaned against the log wall. \"Now, when a boy  comes an' says he can do anythin', why I jest haw! haw! at him. But  you're a man, Wade, an' one as has been there. Now I'm hard put fer  hands. Jest speak out now fer yourself. No one else can speak fer you,  thet's sure. An' this is bizness.\"    \"Any work with stock, from punchin' steers to doctorin' horses,\" replied  Wade, quietly. \"Am fair carpenter an' mason. Good packer. Know farmin'.  Can milk cows an' make butter. I've been cook in many outfits. Read an'  write an' not bad at figures. Can do work on saddles an' harness, an-\"    \"Hold on!\" yelled Belllounds, with a hearty laugh. \"I ain't imposin' on  no man, no matter how I need help. You're sure a jack of all range  trades. An' I wish you was a hunter.\"    \"I was comin' to that. You didn't give me time.\"    \"Say, do you know hounds?\" queried Belllounds, eagerly.    \"Yes. Was raised where everybody had packs. I'm from Kentucky. An' I've  run hounds off an' on for years. I'll tell you--\"    Belllounds interrupted Wade.    \"By all that's lucky! An' last, can you handle guns? We 'ain't had a  good shot on this range fer Lord knows how long. I used to hit plumb  center with a rifle. My eyes are pore now. An' my son can't hit a flock  of haystacks. An' the cowpunchers are 'most as bad. Sometimes right hyar  where you could hit elk with a club we're out of fresh meat.\"    \"Yes, I can handle guns,\" replied Wade, with a quiet smile and a  lowering of his head. \"Reckon you didn't catch my name.\"    \"Wal--no, I didn't,\" slowly replied Belllounds, and his pause, with the  keener look he bestowed upon Wade, told how the latter's query had  struck home.    \"Wade--Bent Wade,\" said Wade, with quiet distinctness.    \"_Not Hell-Bent Wade!_\" ejaculated Belllounds.    \"The same.... I ain't proud of the handle, but I never sail under false  colors.\"    \"Wal, I'll be damned!\" went on the rancher. \"Wade, I've heerd of you fer  years. Some bad, but most good, an' I reckon I'm jest as glad to meet  you as if you'd been somebody else.\"    \"You'll give me the job?\"    \"I should smile.\"    \"I'm thankin' you. Reckon I was some worried. Jobs are hard for me to  get an' harder to keep.\"    \"Thet's not onnatural, considerin' the hell which's said to camp on your  trail,\" replied Belllounds, dryly. \"Wade, I can't say I take a hell of a  lot of stock in such talk. Fifty years I've been west of the Missouri. I  know the West an' I know men. Talk flies from camp to ranch, from  diggin's to town, an' always some one adds a little more. Now I trust my  judgment an' I trust men. No one ever betrayed me yet.\"    \"I'm that way, too,\" replied Wade. \"But it doesn't pay, an' yet I still  kept on bein' that way.... Belllounds, my name's as bad as good all over  western Colorado. But as man to man I tell you--I never did a low-down  trick in my life.... Never but once.\"    \"An' what was thet?\" queried the rancher, gruffly.    \"I killed a man who was innocent,\" replied Wade, with quivering lips,  \"an'--an' drove the woman I loved to her death.\"    \"Aw! we all make mistakes some time in our lives,\" said Belllounds,  hurriedly. \"I made 'most as big a one as yours--so help me God!...\"    \"I'll tell you--\" interrupted Wade.    \"You needn't tell me anythin',\" said Belllounds, interrupting in his  turn. \"But at thet some time I'd like to hear about the Lascelles outfit  over on the Gunnison. I knowed Lascelles. An' a pardner of mine down in  Middle Park came back from the Gunnison with the dog-gondest story I  ever heerd. Thet was five years ago this summer. Of course I knowed your  name long before, but this time I heerd it powerful strong. You got in  thet mix-up to your neck.... Wal, what consarns me now is this. Is there  any sense in the talk thet wherever you land there's hell to pay?\"    \"Belllounds, there's no sense in it, but a lot of truth,\" confessed  Wade, gloomily.    \"Ahuh!... Wal, Hell-Bent Wade, I'll take a chance on you,\" boomed the  rancher's deep voice, rich with the intent of his big heart. \"I've  gambled all my life. An' the best friends I ever made were men I'd  helped.... What wages do you ask?\"    \"I'll take what you offer.\"    \"I'm payin' the boys forty a month, but thet's not enough fer you.\"    \"Yes, that'll do.\"    \"Good, it's settled,\" concluded Belllounds, rising. Then he saw his son  standing inside the door. \"Say, Jack, shake hands with Bent Wade, hunter  an' all-around man. Wade, this's my boy. I've jest put him on as foreman  of the outfit, an' while I'm at it I'll say thet you'll take orders from  me an' not from him.\"    Wade looked up into the face of Jack Belllounds, returned his brief  greeting, and shook his limp hand. The contact sent a strange chill over  Wade. Young Belllounds's face was marred by a bruise and shaded by a  sullen light.    \"Get Billin's to take you out to thet new cabin an' sheds I jest had put  up,\" said the rancher. \"You'll bunk in the cabin.... Aw, I know. Men  like you sleep in the open. But you can't do thet under Old White Slides  in winter. Not much! Make yourself to home, an' I'll walk out after a  bit an' we'll look over the dog outfit. When you see thet outfit you'll  holler fer help.\"    Wade bowed his thanks, and, putting on his sombrero, he turned away. As  he did so he caught a sound of light, quick footsteps on the far end of  the porch.    \"Hello, you-all!\" cried a girl's voice, with melody in it that vibrated  piercingly upon Wade's sensitive ears.    \"Mornin', Columbine,\" replied the rancher.    Bent Wade's heart leaped up. This girlish voice rang upon the chord of  memory. Wade had not the strength to look at her then. It was not that  he could not bear to look, but that he could not bear the disillusion  sure to follow his first glimpse of this adopted daughter of Belllounds.  Sweet to delude himself! Ah! the years were bearing sterner upon his  head! The old dreams persisted, sadder now for the fact that from long  use they had become half-realities! Wade shuffled slowly across the  green square to where the cowboy waited for him. His eyes were dim, and  a sickness attended the sinking of his heart.    \"Wade, I ain't a bettin' fellar, but I'll bet Old Bill took you up,\"  vouchsafed Billings, with interest.    \"Glad to say he did,\" replied Wade. \"You're"]]]
