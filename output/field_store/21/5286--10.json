What sacrilege to reduce crisp, glossy, beautiful  leaves like these to a slimy mess in a pot! The tender buds, often used  in white sauce as a substitute for capers, probably do not give it the  same piquancy where piquancy is surely most needed--on boiled mutton,  said to be Queen Victoria's favorite dish. Hawked about the streets in  tight bunches, the Marsh Marigold blossoms--with half their yellow  sepals already dropped--and the fragrant, pearly, pink arbutus are the  most familiar spring wild flowers seen in Eastern cities.      Gold-thread; Canker-root    _Coptis trifolia_    _Flowers_--Small, white, solitary, on a slender scape 3 to 6 in. high.  Sepals 5 to 7, petal-like, falling early; petals 5 to 6, inconspicuous,  like club-shaped columns; stamens numerous; carpels few, the stigmatic  surfaces curved. _Leaves:_ From the base, long petioled, divided into 3  somewhat fan-shaped, shining, evergreen, sharply toothed leaflets.  _Rootstock:_ Thread-like, long, bright yellow, wiry, bitter.    _Preferred Habitat_--Cool mossy bogs, damp woods.    _Flowering Season_--May-August.    _Distribution_--Maryland and Minnesota northward to circumpolar regions.    Dig up a plant, and the fine, tangled, yellow roots tell why it was  given its name. In the good old days when decoctions of any herb that  was particularly nauseous were swallowed in the simple faith that  virtue resided in them in proportion to their revolting taste, the  gold-thread's bitter roots furnished a tea much valued as a spring  tonic and as a cure for ulcerated throats and canker-sore mouths of  helpless children.      Wild Columbine    _Aquilegia canadensis_    _Flower_--Red outside, yellow within, irregular, 1 to 2 in. long,  solitary, nodding from a curved footstalk from the upper leaf axils.  Petals 5, funnel-shaped, but quickly narrowing into long, erect, very  slender hollow spurs, rounded at the tip and united below by the 5  spreading red sepals, between which the straight spurs ascend; numerous  stamens and 5 pistils projecting. _Stem_: 1 to 2 ft. high, branching,  soft-hairy or smooth. _Leaves_: More or less divided, the lobes with  rounded teeth; large lower compound leaves on long petioles. _Fruit_: An  erect pod, each of the 5 divisions tipped with a long, sharp beak.    _Preferred Habitat_--Rocky places, rich woodland.    _Flowering Season_--April-July.    _Distribution_--Nova Scotia to the Northwest Territory; southward to the  Gulf states. Rocky Mountains.    Although under cultivation the columbine nearly doubles its size, it  never has the elfin charm in a conventional garden that it possesses  wild in Nature's. Dancing, in red and yellow petticoats, to the rhythm  of the breeze along the ledge of overhanging rocks, it coquettes with  some Punchinello as if daring him to reach her at his peril. Who is he?  Let us sit a while on the rocky ledge and watch for her lovers.    Presently a big muscular bumblebee booms along. Owing to his great  strength, an inverted, pendent blossom, from which he must cling upside  down, has no more terrors for him than a trapeze for the trained  acrobat. His long tongue--if he is one of the largest of our sixty-two  species of _Bombus_--can suck almost any flower unless it is especially  adapted to night-flying sphinx moths, but can he drain this? He is the  truest benefactor of the European Columbine _(A. vulgaris)_, whose spurs  suggested the talons of an eagle _(aquila)_ to imaginative Linnaeus when  he gave this group of plants its generic name. Smaller bumblebees,  unable through the shortness of their tongues to feast in a legitimate  manner, may be detected nipping holes in the tips of all columbines,  where the nectar is secreted, just as they do in larkspurs, Dutchman's  breeches, squirrel corn, butter and eggs, and other flowers whose deeply  hidden nectaries make dining too difficult for the little rogues.  Fragile butterflies, absolutely dependent on nectar, hover near our  showy wild columbine with its five tempting horns of plenty, but sail  away again, knowing as they do that their weak legs are not calculated  to stand the strain of an inverted position from a pendent flower, nor  are their tongues adapted to slender tubes unless these may be entered  from above. The tongues of both butterflies and moths bend readily only  when directed beneath their bodies. It will be noticed that our  columbine's funnel-shaped tubes contract just below the point where the  nectar is secreted--doubtless to protect it from small bees. When we see  the honey-bee or the little wild bees--_Halictus_ chiefly--on the  flower, we may know they get pollen only.    Finally a ruby-throated humming bird whirs into sight. Poising before a  columbine, and moving around it to drain one spur after another until  the five are emptied, he flashes like thought to another group of  inverted red cornucopias, visits in turn every flower in the colony,  then whirs away quite as suddenly as he came. Probably to him, and no  longer to the outgrown bumblebee, has the flower adapted itself. The  European species wears blue, the bee's favorite color according to Sir  John Lubbock; the nectar hidden in its spurs, which are shorter,  stouter, and curved, is accessible only to the largest bumblebees.  There are no humming birds in Europe. Our native columbine, on the  contrary, has longer, contracted, straight, erect spurs, most easily  drained by the ruby-throat which, like Eugene Field, ever delights in  \"any color at all so long as it's red.\"    To help make the columbine conspicuous, even the sepals become red; but  the flower is yellow within, it is thought to guide visitors to the  nectaries. The stamens protrude like a golden tassel. After the anthers  pass the still immature stigmas, the pollen of the outer row ripens,  ready for removal, while the inner row of undeveloped stamens still acts  as a sheath for the stigmas. Owing to the pendent position of the  flower, no pollen could fall on the latter in any case. The columbine is  too highly organized to tolerate self-fertilization. When all the  stamens have discharged their pollen, the styles then elongate; and the  feathery stigmas, opening and curving sidewise, bring themselves at the  entrance of each of the five cornucopias, just the position the anthers  previously occupied. Probably even the small bees, collecting pollen  only, help carry some from flower to flower; but perhaps the largest  bumblebees, and certainly the humming bird, must be regarded as the  columbine's legitimate benefactors. Caterpillars of one of the dusky  wings (_Papilio lucilius_) feed on the leaves.      Black Cohosh; Black Snakeroot; Tall Bugbane    _Cimicifuga racemosa_    _Flowers_--Foetid, feathery, white, in an elongated wand-like raceme, 6  in. to 2 ft. long, at the end of a stem 3 to 8 ft. high. Sepals  petal-like, falling early; 4 to 8 small stamen-like petals 2-cleft;  stamens very numerous, with long filaments; 1 or 2 sessile pistils with  broad stigmas. _Leaves:_ Alternate, on long petioles, thrice compounded  of oblong, deeply toothed or cleft leaflets, the end leaflet often again  compound. _Fruit:_ Dry oval pods, their seeds in 2 rows.    _Preferred Habitat_--Rich woods and woodland borders, hillsides.    _Flowering Season_--June-August.    _Distribution_--Maine to Georgia, and westward from Ontario to Missouri.    Tall white rockets, shooting upward from a mass of large handsome leaves  in some heavily shaded midsummer woodland border, cannot fail to impress  themselves through more than one sense, for their odor is as  disagreeable as the fleecy white blossoms are striking. Obviously such  flowers would be most attractive to the carrion and meat flies.  _Cimicifuga_, meaning to drive away bugs, and the old folk-name of  bugbane testify to a degree of offensiveness to other insects, where the  flies' enjoyment begins. As these are the only insects one is likely to  see about the fleecy wands, doubtless they are their benefactors. The  countless stamens which feed them generously with pollen willingly left  for them alone must also dust them well as they crawl about before  flying to another foetid lunch.    The close kinship with the baneberries is detected at once on examining  one of these flowers. Were the vigorous plant less offensive to the  nostrils, many a garden would be proud to own so decorative an addition  to the shrubbery border.      White Baneberry; Cohosh    _Actaea alba_    _Flowers_--Small, white, in a terminal oblong raceme. Calyx of 3 to 5  petal-like, early-falling sepals; petals very small, 4 to 10, spatulate,  clawed; stamens white, numerous, longer than petals; 1 pistil with a  broad stigma. _Stem:_ Erect, bushy, 1 to 2 ft. high. _Leaves:_ Twice or  thrice compounded of sharply toothed and pointed, sometimes lobed,  leaflets, petioled. _Fruit:_ Clusters of poisonous oval white berries  with dark purple spot on end, formed from the pistils. Both pedicels and  peduncles much thickened and often red after fruiting.    _Preferred Habitat_--Cool, shady, moist woods.    _Flowering Season_--April-June.    _Distribution_--Nova Scotia to Georgia and far West.    However insignificant the short fuzzy clusters of flowers lifted by this  bushy little plant, we cannot fail to name it after it has set those  curious white berries with a dark spot on the end, which Mrs. Starr Dana  graphically compares to \"the china eyes that small children occasionally  manage to gouge from their dolls' heads.\" For generations they have been  called \"dolls' eyes\" in Massachusetts. Especially after these poisonous  berries fully ripen and the rigid stems which bear them thicken and  redden, we cannot fail to notice them. As the sepals fall early, the  white stamens and stigmas are the most conspicuous parts of the flowers.

Volume 1 (#12)"],[1,"been placed by CHANCE, that  has not a cause for occupying the place where it is found; that does  not, in the most rigorous sense of the word, act after the manner in  which it ought to act; that is, according to its own peculiar essence,  and that of the beings from whom it receives this communicated force.  A geometrician exactly knew the different energies acting in each case,  with the properties of the particles moved, could demonstrate that after  the causes given, each particle acted precisely as it ought to act, and  that it could not have acted otherwise than it did.    In those terrible convulsions that sometimes agitate political  societies, shake their foundations, and frequently produce the overthrow  of an empire; there is not a single action, a single word, a single  thought, a single will, a single passion in the agents, whether they act  as destroyers, or as victims, that is not the necessary result of the  causes operating; that does not act, as, of necessity, it must act, from  the peculiar essence of the beings who give the impulse, and that of the  agents who receive it, according to the situation these agents fill in  the moral whirlwind. This could be evidently proved by an understanding  capacitated to rate all the action and re-action, of the minds and  bodies of those who contributed to the revolution.    In fact, if all be connected in Nature, if all motion be produced,  the one from the other, notwithstanding their secret communications  frequently elude our sight; we ought to feel convinced of this truth,  that there is no cause, however minute, however remote, that does not  sometimes produce the greatest and most immediate effects on man. It  may, perhaps, be in the parched plains of Lybia, that are amassed  the first elements of a storm or tempest, which, borne by the winds,  approach our climate, render our atmosphere dense, and thus operating  on the temperament, may influence the passions of a man, whose  circumstances shall have capacitated him to influence many others, who  shall decide after his will the fate of many nations.    Man, in fact, finds himself in Nature, and makes a part of it: he acts  according to laws, which are appropriate to him; he receives in a manner  more or less distinct, the action and impulse of the beings who surround  him; who themselves act after laws that are peculiar to their essence.  Thus he is variously modified; but his actions are always the result of  his own energy, and that of the beings who act upon him, and by whom he  is modified. This is what gives such variety to his determinations--what  generally produces such contradiction in his thoughts, his opinions,  his will, his actions; in short, in that motion, whether concealed or  visible, by which he is agitated. We shall have occasion, in the sequel,  to place this truth, at present so much contested, in a clearer light:  it will be sufficient for our purpose at present to prove, generally,  that every thing in Nature is necessary--that nothing to be found in it  can act otherwise than it does.    Motion, alternately communicated and received, establishes the  connection or relation between the different orders of beings: when they  are in the sphere of reciprocal action, attraction approximates  them; repulsion dissolves and separates them; the one strengthens and  preserves them; the other enfeebles and destroys them. Once combined,  they have a tendency to conserve themselves in that mode of existence,  by virtue of their _inert force_; in this they cannot succeed, because  they are exposed to the continual influence of all other beings, who  perpetually and successively act upon them; their change of form, their  dissolution, is requisite to the preservation of Nature herself: this is  the sole end we are able to assign her--to which we see her tend without  intermission--which she follows without interruption, by the destruction  and reproduction of all subordinate beings, who are obliged to submit to  her laws--to concur, by their mode of action, to the maintenance of her  active existence, so essentially requisite to the GREAT WHOLE.    It is thus each being is an individual, who, in the great family,  performs his necessary portion of the general labour--who executes the  unavoidable task assigned to him. All bodies act according to laws,  inherent in their peculiar essence, without the capability to swerve,  even for a single instant, from those according to which Nature herself  acts. This is the central power, to which all other powers, essences,  and energies, are submitted: she regulates the motions of beings, by the  necessity of her own peculiar essence: she makes them concur by various  modes to the general plan: this appears to be nothing more than the  life, action, and maintenance of the whole, by the continual change of  its parts. This object she obtains, in removing them, one by the other;  by that which establishes, and by that which destroys, the relation  subsisting between them; by that which gives them, and that which  deprives them of, their forms, combinations, proportions, and qualities,  according to which they act for a time, after a given mode; these are  afterwards taken from them, to make them act after a different manner.  It is thus that Nature makes them expand and change, grow and decline,  augment and diminish, approximate and remove, forms and destroys them,  according as she finds it requisite to maintain the whole; towards the  conservation which this Nature is herself essentially necessitated to  have a tendency.    This irresistible power, this universal necessity, this general energy,  then, is only a consequence of the nature of things; by virtue of which  every thing acts, without intermission, after constant and immutable  laws: these laws not varying more for the whole than for the beings of  which it is composed. Nature is an active living whole, to which all its  parts necessarily concur; of which, without their own knowledge, they  maintain the activity, the life, and the existence. Nature acts and  exists necessarily: all that she contains, necessarily conspires to  perpetuate her active existence. This is the decided opinion of PLATO,  when he says, \"_matter and necessity are the same thing; this necessity  is the mother of the world._\" In point of fact, we cannot go beyond this  aphorism, MATTER ACTS, BECAUSE IT EXISTS; AND EXISTS, TO ACT. If it be  enquired how, or for why, matter exists? We answer, we know not: but  reasoning by analogy, of what we do not know by that which we do, we  should be of opinion it exists necessarily, or because it contains  within itself a sufficient reason for its existence. In supposing it to  be created or produced by a being distinguished from it, or less known  than itself, (which it may be, for any thing we know to the contrary,)  we must still admit, that this being is necessary, and includes a  sufficient reason for his own existence. We have not then removed any of  the difficulty, we have not thrown a clearer light upon the subject, we  have not advanced a single step; we have simply laid aside a being,  of which we know some few of the properties, but of which we are still  extremely ignorant, to have recourse to a power, of which it is utterly  impossible we can, as long as we are men, form any distinct idea; of  which, notwithstanding it may be a truth, we cannot, by any means we  possess, demonstrate the existence. As, therefore, these must be at best  but speculative points of belief, which each individual, by reason of  its obscurity, may contemplate with different optics, under various  aspects, they surely ought to be left free for each to judge after his  own fashion: the Hindoo can have no just cause of enmity against  the Christian for his faith: this has no moral right to question  the Mussulman upon his; the numerous sects of each of the various  persuasions spread over the face of the earth, ought to make it a creed  to look with an eye of complacency on the deviation of the others;  and rest upon that great moral axiom, which is strictly conformable  to Nature, which contains the whole of man's happiness--\"_Do not unto  another, that which do you not wish another should do unto you_;\" for it  is evident, according to their own doctrines, out of all the variety of  systems, one only can be right.    We shall see in the sequel, how much man's imagination labours to  form an idea, of the energies of that Nature he has personified, and  distinguished from herself: in short, we shall examine some of the  ridiculous and pernicious inventions, which, for want of understanding  Nature, have been imagined to impede her course, to suspend her eternal  laws, to place obstacles to the necessity of things.            CHAP. V.    _Order and Confusion.--Intelligence.--Chance._      The observation of the necessary, regular, and periodical motion in the  universe, generated in the mind of man the idea of ORDER; this term,  in its original signification, represents nothing more than a mode of  considering, a facility of perceiving, together and separately, the  different relations of a whole; in which is discovered, by its manner of  existing and acting, a certain affinity or conformity with his own. Man,  in extending this idea to the universe, carried with him those methods  of considering things which are peculiar to himself: he has consequently  supposed there really existed in Nature affinities and relations, which  he classed under the name of ORDER; and others which appeared to him not  to conform to those, which he has ranked under the term of CONFUSION.    It is easy to comprehend, that this idea of order and confusion can have  no absolute existence in Nature, where every thing is necessary; where  the whole follows constant and invariable laws, which oblige each being,  in every moment of its duration, to submit to other laws, which  flow from its own peculiar mode of"]]]
