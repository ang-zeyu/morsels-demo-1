What  riddle is this?'    'It is one,' she answered, rising as she spoke, 'that must remain for  ever as it is. I dare not say more than that.'    'Dare not!' repeated the wondering locksmith.    'Do not press me,' she replied. 'I am sick and faint, and every faculty  of life seems dead within me.--No!--Do not touch me, either.'    Gabriel, who had stepped forward to render her assistance, fell back as  she made this hasty exclamation, and regarded her in silent wonder.    'Let me go my way alone,' she said in a low voice, 'and let the hands of  no honest man touch mine to-night.' When she had tottered to the door,  she turned, and added with a stronger effort, 'This is a secret, which,  of necessity, I trust to you. You are a true man. As you have ever been  good and kind to me,--keep it. If any noise was heard above, make some  excuse--say anything but what you really saw, and never let a word or  look between us, recall this circumstance. I trust to you. Mind, I trust  to you. How much I trust, you never can conceive.'    Casting her eyes upon him for an instant, she withdrew, and left him  there alone.    Gabriel, not knowing what to think, stood staring at the door with a  countenance full of surprise and dismay. The more he pondered on  what had passed, the less able he was to give it any favourable  interpretation. To find this widow woman, whose life for so many years  had been supposed to be one of solitude and retirement, and who, in her  quiet suffering character, had gained the good opinion and respect of  all who knew her--to find her linked mysteriously with an ill-omened  man, alarmed at his appearance, and yet favouring his escape, was a  discovery that pained as much as startled him. Her reliance on his  secrecy, and his tacit acquiescence, increased his distress of mind. If  he had spoken boldly, persisted in questioning her, detained her  when she rose to leave the room, made any kind of protest, instead of  silently compromising himself, as he felt he had done, he would have  been more at ease.    'Why did I let her say it was a secret, and she trusted it to me!' said  Gabriel, putting his wig on one side to scratch his head with greater  ease, and looking ruefully at the fire. 'I have no more readiness than  old John himself. Why didn't I say firmly, \"You have no right to such  secrets, and I demand of you to tell me what this means,\" instead of  standing gaping at her, like an old moon-calf as I am! But there's my  weakness. I can be obstinate enough with men if need be, but women may  twist me round their fingers at their pleasure.'    He took his wig off outright as he made this reflection, and, warming  his handkerchief at the fire began to rub and polish his bald head with  it, until it glistened again.    'And yet,' said the locksmith, softening under this soothing process,  and stopping to smile, 'it MAY be nothing. Any drunken brawler trying to  make his way into the house, would have alarmed a quiet soul like her.  But then'--and here was the vexation--'how came it to be that man; how  comes he to have this influence over her; how came she to favour his  getting away from me; and, more than all, how came she not to say it  was a sudden fright, and nothing more? It's a sad thing to have, in one  minute, reason to mistrust a person I have known so long, and an old  sweetheart into the bargain; but what else can I do, with all this upon  my mind!--Is that Barnaby outside there?'    'Ay!' he cried, looking in and nodding. 'Sure enough it's Barnaby--how  did you guess?'    'By your shadow,' said the locksmith.    'Oho!' cried Barnaby, glancing over his shoulder, 'He's a merry fellow,  that shadow, and keeps close to me, though I AM silly. We have such  pranks, such walks, such runs, such gambols on the grass! Sometimes  he'll be half as tall as a church steeple, and sometimes no bigger  than a dwarf. Now, he goes on before, and now behind, and anon he'll  be stealing on, on this side, or on that, stopping whenever I stop, and  thinking I can't see him, though I have my eye on him sharp enough. Oh!  he's a merry fellow. Tell me--is he silly too? I think he is.'    'Why?' asked Gabriel.    'Because he never tires of mocking me, but does it all day long.--Why  don't you come?'    'Where?'    'Upstairs. He wants you. Stay--where's HIS shadow? Come. You're a wise  man; tell me that.'    'Beside him, Barnaby; beside him, I suppose,' returned the locksmith.    'No!' he replied, shaking his head. 'Guess again.'    'Gone out a walking, maybe?'    'He has changed shadows with a woman,' the idiot whispered in his ear,  and then fell back with a look of triumph. 'Her shadow's always with  him, and his with her. That's sport I think, eh?'    'Barnaby,' said the locksmith, with a grave look; 'come hither, lad.'    'I know what you want to say. I know!' he replied, keeping away from  him. 'But I'm cunning, I'm silent. I only say so much to you--are you  ready?' As he spoke, he caught up the light, and waved it with a wild  laugh above his head.    'Softly--gently,' said the locksmith, exerting all his influence to keep  him calm and quiet. 'I thought you had been asleep.'    'So I HAVE been asleep,' he rejoined, with widely-opened eyes. 'There  have been great faces coming and going--close to my face, and then a  mile away--low places to creep through, whether I would or no--high  churches to fall down from--strange creatures crowded up together neck  and heels, to sit upon the bed--that's sleep, eh?'    'Dreams, Barnaby, dreams,' said the locksmith.    'Dreams!' he echoed softly, drawing closer to him. 'Those are not  dreams.'    'What are,' replied the locksmith, 'if they are not?'    'I dreamed,' said Barnaby, passing his arm through Varden's, and peering  close into his face as he answered in a whisper, 'I dreamed just now  that something--it was in the shape of a man--followed me--came softly  after me--wouldn't let me be--but was always hiding and crouching, like  a cat in dark corners, waiting till I should pass; when it crept out and  came softly after me.--Did you ever see me run?'    'Many a time, you know.'    'You never saw me run as I did in this dream. Still it came creeping on  to worry me. Nearer, nearer, nearer--I ran faster--leaped--sprung out  of bed, and to the window--and there, in the street below--but he is  waiting for us. Are you coming?'    'What in the street below, Barnaby?' said Varden, imagining that  he traced some connection between this vision and what had actually  occurred.    Barnaby looked into his face, muttered incoherently, waved the light  above his head again, laughed, and drawing the locksmith's arm more  tightly through his own, led him up the stairs in silence.    They entered a homely bedchamber, garnished in a scanty way with chairs,  whose spindle-shanks bespoke their age, and other furniture of very  little worth; but clean and neatly kept. Reclining in an easy-chair  before the fire, pale and weak from waste of blood, was Edward Chester,  the young gentleman who had been the first to quit the Maypole on the  previous night, and who, extending his hand to the locksmith, welcomed  him as his preserver and friend.    'Say no more, sir, say no more,' said Gabriel. 'I hope I would have done  at least as much for any man in such a strait, and most of all for you,  sir. A certain young lady,' he added, with some hesitation, 'has done us  many a kind turn, and we naturally feel--I hope I give you no offence in  saying this, sir?'    The young man smiled and shook his head; at the same time moving in his  chair as if in pain.    'It's no great matter,' he said, in answer to the locksmith's  sympathising look, 'a mere uneasiness arising at least as much from  being cooped up here, as from the slight wound I have, or from the loss  of blood. Be seated, Mr Varden.'    'If I may make so bold, Mr Edward, as to lean upon your chair,' returned  the locksmith, accommodating his action to his speech, and bending over  him, 'I'll stand here for the convenience of speaking low. Barnaby is  not in his quietest humour to-night, and at such times talking never  does him good.'    They both glanced at the subject of this remark, who had taken a seat on  the other side of the fire, and, smiling vacantly, was making puzzles on  his fingers with a skein of string.    'Pray, tell me, sir,' said Varden, dropping his voice still lower,  'exactly what happened last night. I have my reason for inquiring. You  left the Maypole, alone?'    'And walked homeward alone, until I had nearly reached the place where  you found me, when I heard the gallop of a horse.'    'Behind you?' said the locksmith.    'Indeed, yes--behind me. It was a single rider, who soon overtook me,  and checking his horse, inquired the way to London.'    'You were on the alert, sir, knowing how many highwaymen there are,  scouring the roads in all directions?' said Varden.    'I was, but I had only a stick, having imprudently left my pistols  in their holster-case with the landlord's son. I directed him as he  desired. Before the words had passed my lips, he rode upon me furiously,  as if bent on trampling me down beneath his horse's hoofs. In starting  aside, I slipped and fell. You found me with this stab and an ugly  bruise or two, and without my purse--in which he found little enough for  his pains. And now, Mr Varden,' he added, shaking the locksmith by the  hand, 'saving the extent of my gratitude to you, you know as much as I.'    'Except,' said Gabriel, bending down yet more, and looking cautiously  towards their silent neighhour, 'except in respect of the robber  himself. What like was he, sir? Speak low, if you please. Barnaby means  no harm, but I have watched him oftener than you, and I know, little as  you would think it, that he's listening now.'    It required a strong confidence in the locksmith's veracity to lead any  one to"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/9172"],[0,"A Study of Association in Insanity (#12)"],[1,"....19  Bath--Mott............19  Cottage--globe........19  Swift--continue.......19  Blue--notice..........19  Hungry--Josephine.....19  Priest--sixteen.......12  Ocean--flag...........15  Head--cabbage.........
