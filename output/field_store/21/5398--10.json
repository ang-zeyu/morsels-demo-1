I told his Majesty at the siege of Magdeburg. \"At  Magdeburg!\" said the king, shaking his head; \"Tilly must answer to me  some day for that city, and if not to me, to a greater King than I.  Can you guess what army he had with him?\" said the king. \"He had two  armies with him,\" said I, \"but one I suppose will do your Majesty  no harm.\" \"Two armies!\" said the king. \"Yes, sir, he has one army  of about 26,000 men,\" said I, \"and another of about 15,000 women and  their attendants,\" at which the king laughed heartily. \"Ay, ay,\" says  the king, \"those 15,000 do us as much harm as the 26,000, for they  eat up the country, and devour the poor Protestants more than the men.  Well,\" says the king, \"do they talk of fighting us?\" \"They talk big  enough, sir,\" said I, \"but your Majesty has not been so often fought  with as beaten in their discourse.\" \"I know not for the men,\" says the  king, \"but the old man is as likely to do it as talk of it, and I hope  to try them in a day or two.\"    The king inquired after that several matters of me about the Low  Countries, the Prince of Orange, and of the court and affairs in  England; and Sir John Hepburn informing his Majesty that I was the son  of an English gentleman of his acquaintance, the king had the goodness  to ask him what care he had taken of me against the day of battle.  Upon which Sir John repeated to him the discourse we had together by  the way; the king seeming particularly pleased with it, began to take  me to task himself. \"You English gentlemen,\" says he, \"are too  forward in the wars, which makes you leave them too soon again.\" \"Your  Majesty,\" replied I, \"makes war in so pleasant a manner as makes  all the world fond of fighting under your conduct.\" \"Not so pleasant  neither,\" says the king, \"here's a man can tell you that sometimes it  is not very pleasant.\" \"I know not much of the warrior, sir,\" said  I, \"nor of the world, but if always to conquer be the pleasure of the  war, your Majesty's soldiers have all that can be desired.\" \"Well,\"  says the king, \"but however, considering all things, I think you would  do well to take the advice Sir John Hepburn has given you.\" \"Your  Majesty may command me to anything, but where your Majesty and so many  gallant gentlemen hazard their lives, mine is not worth mentioning;  and I should not dare to tell my father at my return into England  that I was in your Majesty's army, and made so mean a figure that  your Majesty would not permit me to fight under that royal standard.\"  \"Nay,\" replied the king, \"I lay no commands upon you, but you are  young.\" \"I can never die, sir,\" said I, \"with more honour than in your  Majesty's service.\" I spake this with so much freedom, and his Majesty  was so pleased with it, that he asked me how I would choose to serve,  on horseback or on foot. I told his Majesty I should be glad to  receive any of his Majesty's commands, but if I had not that honour I  had purposed to trail a pike under Sir John Hepburn, who had done me  so much honour as to introduce me into his Majesty's presence. \"Do so,  then,\" replied the king, and turning to Sir John Hepburn, said, \"and  pray, do you take care of him.\" At which, overcome with the goodness  of his discourse, I could not answer a word, but made him a profound  reverence and retired.    The next day but one, being the 7th of September, before day the army  marched from Dieben to a large field about a mile from Leipsic, where  we found Tilly's army in full battalia in admirable order, which made  a show both glorious and terrible. Tilly, like a fair gamester, had  taken up but one side of the plain, and left the other free, and all  the avenues open for the king's army; nor did he stir to the charge  till the king's army was completely drawn up and advanced toward him.  He had in his army 44,000 old soldiers, every way answerable to what  I have said of them before; and I shall only add, a better army, I  believe, never was so soundly beaten.    The king was not much inferior in force, being joined with the Saxons,  who were reckoned 22,000 men, and who drew up on the left, making a  main battle and two wings, as the king did on the right.    The king placed himself at the right wing of his own horse, Gustavus  Horn had the main battle of the Swedes, the Duke of Saxony had the  main battle of his own troops, and General Arnheim the right wing of  his horse. The second line of the Swedes consisted of the two Scotch  brigades, and three Swedish, with the Finland horse in the wings.    In the beginning of the fight, Tilly's right wing charged with such  irresistible fury upon the left of the king's army where the Saxons  were posted, that nothing could withstand them. The Saxons fled amain,  and some of them carried the news over the country that all was lost,  and the king's army overthrown; and indeed it passed for an oversight  with some that the king did not place some of his old troops among the  Saxons, who were new-raised men. The Saxons lost here near 2000 men,  and hardly ever showed their faces again all the battle, except some  few of their horse.    I was posted with my comrade, the captain, at the head of three  Scottish regiments of foot, commanded by Sir John Hepburn, with  express directions from the colonel to keep by him. Our post was in  the second line, as a reserve to the King of Sweden's main battle,  and, which was strange, the main battle, which consisted of four great  brigades of foot, were never charged during the whole fight; and yet  we, who had the reserve, were obliged to endure the whole weight  of the Imperial army. The occasion was, the right wing of the  Imperialists having defeated the Saxons, and being eager in the chase,  Tilly, who was an old soldier, and ready to prevent all mistakes,  forbids any pursuit. \"Let them go,\" says he, \"but let us beat the  Swedes, or we do nothing.\" Upon this the victorious troops fell in  upon the flank of the king's army, which, the Saxons being fled, lay  open to them. Gustavus Horn commanded the left wing of the Swedes, and  having first defeated some regiments which charged him, falls in upon  the rear of the Imperial right wing, and separates them from the van,  who were advanced a great way forward in pursuit of the Saxons, and  having routed the said rear or reserve, falls on upon Tilly's main  battle, and defeated part of them; the other part was gone in chase of  the Saxons, and now also returned, fell in upon the rear of the left  wing of the Swedes, charging them in the flank, for they drew up upon  the very ground which the Saxons had quitted. This changed the whole  front, and made the Swedes face about to the left, and made a great  front on their flank to make this good. Our brigades, who were placed  as a reserve for the main battle, were, by special order from the  king, wheeled about to the left, and placed for the right of this new  front to charge the Imperialists; they were about 12,000 of their best  foot, besides horse, and flushed with the execution of the Saxons,  fell on like furies. The king by this time had almost defeated the  Imperialists' left wing; their horse, with more haste than good speed,  had charged faster than their foot could follow, and having broke into  the king's first line, he let them go, where, while the second line  bears the shock, and bravely resisted them, the king follows them on  the crupper with thirteen troops of horse, and some musketeers, by  which being hemmed in, they were all cut down in a moment as it were,  and the army never disordered with them. This fatal blow to the left  wing gave the king more leisure to defeat the foot which followed, and  to send some assistance to Gustavus Horn in his left wing, who had his  hands full with the main battle of the Imperialists.    But those troops who, as I said, had routed the Saxons, being called  off from the pursuit, had charged our flank, and were now grown very  strong, renewed the battle in a terrible manner. Here it was I saw our  men go to wreck. Colonel Hall, a brave soldier, commanded the rear of  the Swede's left wing; he fought like a lion, but was slain, and most  of his regiment cut off, though not unrevenged, for they entirely  ruined Furstenberg's regiment of foot. Colonel Cullembach, with his  regiment of horse, was extremely overlaid also, and the colonel and  many brave officers killed, and in short all that wing was shattered,  and in an ill condition.    In this juncture came the king, and having seen what havoc the enemy  made of Cullembach's troops, he comes riding along the front of our  three brigades, and himself led us on to the charge; the colonel of  his guards, the Baron Dyvel, was shot dead just as the king had given  him some orders. When the Scots advanced, seconded by some regiments  of horse which the king also sent to the charge, the bloodiest fight  began that ever men beheld, for the Scottish brigades, giving fire  three ranks at a time over one another's heads, poured in their shot  so thick, that the enemy were cut down like grass before a scythe;  and following into the thickest of their foot with the clubs of their  muskets made a most dreadful slaughter, and yet was there no flying.  Tilly's men might be killed and knocked down, but no man turned his  back,"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/1226"],[0,"The Journal of Abnormal Psychology, Volume 10 (#13)"],[1," itself,  as has once been said, from the control of the consciousness; by so doing  the patient can exert no influence upon it, cannot correct it and can  neither come to an understanding with it nor get rid of it, because in  reality the patient absolutely does not possess the subconscious passions.  Rather they are repressed from out the hierarchy of the conscious soul, they  have become autonomous complexes, which can be brought again into  consciousness only with great resistance through analysis. Many patients  think that the erotic conflict does not exist for them; in their opinion the  sexual question is nonsense; they have no sexual feeling.  These people  forget that in place of that they are crippled by other things of unknown  origin. They are subject to hysterical moods, bad temper, crossness, from  which they, no less than their associates, suffer. They are tortured by  indigestion, by pains of every sort, and are visited by the whole category  of other nervous phenomena. They have this in place of what they lack in the  sexual territory, because only a few are privileged to escape the great  conflict of civilized man of the present day.  The great majority inevitably  takes part in this common discord.    As specimens of dream-analysis I will give resumes of two histories of  illness told me by Dr. Jung.        ANALYSIS AND CURE OF A CASE OF NERVOUS PROSTRATION    A twenty-year-old banker's son, from a large city in Hungary, suddenly grew  sick two years ago, shortly after his father had suffered an attack of  apoplexy and paralysis of the right side. He is spiritless, restless, not  able to work, cannot use his right arm to write, is powerless to put his  attention on anything, sleeps badly, etc.  No treatment has any helpful  effect. He is advised to seek distraction in Paris, but this, too, is of no  avail.  Then, after months of torture, he came to Zurich to Dr. Jung, who  subjected him to analysis. At the second visit the patient behaved extremely  mysteriously; he was much disturbed and appeared to be under the influence  of an anxious dream, which he had dreamt that night. It required some effort  to induce him to tell this dream, and it was only after he had convinced  himself that no one could listen in the hall, that this story, not without  emotion, came out.    \"I see in a vault a coffin in which my father lies, and I beside him; in  vain I attempt to remove the lid, and in my horrible fear I awake.\"    Some days were employed with the analysis of this dream. The explanation of  it is:  he has a very strong father-complex. From childhood up he has always  been with his father, he has assumed the role of his father's wife, has  cared for him, lived for him. He often reproached his mother for not making  enough of the father, for not always cooking his favorite dish, for  sometimes contradicting him, etc.  He was always around with his father,  worked at his office, served him in all sorts of ways, and anticipated all  his wishes.  Now, when the father suddenly became an invalid, the conflict  arose.  He identifies himself with the father. His father's invalidism  becomes his own, he cannot think any more, he cannot write any more, and he  sees death approaching. In the dream he is apparently dead, but his youth,  his strength refuses to die, and this is translated in his attempts to get  out of the coffin, which explains the fear.    The explanation brings relaxation.  After some days, during which the  patient communicates his secret thoughts in detail, he feels very much  better, his heavy burden has been rolled away, and he cannot find words  enough to express his thanks to the doctor. The latter points out to him  that however natural this feeling of thankfulness may be, it is partly a  symptom of the cure at his hands. He shows the patient how the latter, who  had seen through the analysis that his love for his father has been  exaggerated and morbid, had been able to control this, and how he now  transfers to him, the assisting physician, the need for love, freed from  suffering along the way of sublimated homo-sexuality. He impresses upon him  that he must now learn to moderate the sympathy, which he expresses too  feelingly, and that he must not desire to see another father in the doctor,  but simply a friend, who is teaching him to stand on his own feet and to  become an independent man. After a few more weeks the young man was entirely  cured of his neurosis, freed from his exaggerations and returned home a well  man.    ANALYSIS OF A CASE OF SLEEPLESSNESS    Once when traveling I made the acquaintance of a naturalist who not long  before had completed a famous exploring expedition in distant countries.  During this expedition he had been almost constantly in peril of his life.  Almost every night he had had to stay awake and watch so as not to be set  upon and killed.  He had been back in England a short time and had  completely recovered from the privations and sufferings he had experienced,  but he suffered desperately from insomnia.  On his return he had slept well,  but a month before his sleep had suddenly begun to be disturbed.    Knowing me to be a neurologist, he asked my advice. I inquired about the  patient's former life, but discovered that my traveling companion was little  inclined to be communicative in this direction, in fact he was strikingly  reticent. To my inquiry about the immediate origin of the insomnia, he told  me it was immediately connected with a miserable dream which he had dreamt a  month past, and from which he had awakened in terrible anxiety.  I asked him  to tell me this dream and gave him hope that perhaps the analysis of this  might succeed in laying bare the cause of the insomnia. The substance of the  dream was as follows:    \"I was in a narrow gorge, formed by almost perpendicular walls of rock. This  made me think of a similar narrow gorge which, during my journey, I had  passed through at peril of my life.  Upon a jutting rock a hundred yards  high above the abyss, I saw a man and woman standing, shoulder to shoulder,  both covering their eyes with their hands. They step forward and I see them  plunge downwards together, and hear their bodies falling to destruction.  Screaming wildly I awoke.  Since that time I dare not let myself sleep for  fear of the repetition of this dream.    The patient, accustomed to deadly peril on his long expedition, could not  explain to himself the anxiety caused by this dream. I called Mr. X's  attention to the fact that in my opinion an erotic conflict was concealed in  the dream, and asked him point blank whether he had taken part in a love  story. At this the patient grew deadly pale, struck the table with his fist  and said \"That you should have guessed it!\" Now the confession followed, how  he had had a love affair in which he had not cut a good figure and which  ruined a woman's life, and that afterwards he had been violently remorseful  and had lived with the idea of suicide.  Then he had seized upon the  opportunity offered him to lead a dangerous expedition. He wanted to die and  here he would not find death ingloriously.    It is clear that the two people upon the rocks above symbolized the two, who  went to meet destruction.    Soon afterwards the travelers parted.  A year later the newspapers contained  the report of the marriage of the famous explorer. The surmise is allowable  that the analysis of this dream was the cause of this fortunate solution.    As I have already pointed out, the original cathartic method of Breuer and  Freud, explained to some extent, is still followed by some investigators, by  Muthman, Bezzola, Frank and many others. I had the opportunity in June and  July, 1912, of observing for some time the treatment of patients by Dr.  Frank in Zurich at his private clinic, and of gaining for myself a  satisfactory idea of his technique. Frank by no means rejects the Freudian  psychoanalysis with all its helps, but uses it only when he does not succeed  in hypnotizing his patient. Preferably, and in a great number of cases, he  uses, in a state of hypnotism, a cathartic method he originated.    Where Breuer and Freud profited from the spontaneous or the provoked  somnabulistic state of the patient, and by questioning dug up the hidden  depths, Frank decided to be satisfied with a light hypnose, a state of  hypotaxie, which might be termed analogous to the half-conscious state of  the person who after taking a mid-day nap frequently denies having been  asleep.  In this condition we can give an account on waking of what happened  around us. One sleeps and one does not sleep; the upper-consciousness then  can control what the sub-consciousness brings up.    Frank says that, except in the peculiarity that he is satisfied with a  lighter degree of hypnose, his method differs from that of Breuer and Freud  in that generally he does not question the patient when under hypnotism,  neither suggests.  Experience has taught him, he says, that the ideas loaded  with affect, spontaneously discharge. They are the very ones which would do  so in a dream, but are differentiated from the occurrences in the dream in  the sense that these last enter phantastically dressed, while the first  express themselves with the mental affects belonging to them, precisely as  they were lived through.    Precisely as in the primitive-cathartic method, the affects pushing in here  are disemburdened here, but at the same time, the connection between the  existent sick-phenomena and the causes having a place here were  automatically conscious to the patient. In some cases suggestion is called  upon for help in order to free an affect or to direct the attention to the  expected scene.    In most cases the process goes on itself, after the introduction of  hypnosis. If the sleep is too deep, then the ideas are transferred into real  dreams, which the patient immediately recognizes as such, or the production  of "]]]
