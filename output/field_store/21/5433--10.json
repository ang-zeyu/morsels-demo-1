[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/12984"],[0,"Eugene Field, a Study in Heredity and Contradictions â€” Volume 1 (#13)"],[1,"introductory words, under date of  Springfield, February 4th, 1901, Mr. Griffin wrote:      Yes, I was of the class of 1872, but Field flitted before I became    connected with it. But Williamstown was my birthplace and home and    I struck up an acquaintance with him at Smith's college bookstore    and the post-office. Field was raw and not a bit deferential to    established customs, and so the secret-society men were not attracted    to him. The \"trotting\" or preliminary attentions to freshmen    constitute a great and revered feature of college life. When I saw    Field \"trotting\" a lank and gawky freshman for the \"Mills Theological    Society,\" the humor of it appealed to one soaked in the traditions of    a college town, and we \"became acquainted.\" Field left the class    about as I came in.      It is not remarkable that Tom McMahon has no clear recollection of    Field, who was in college only about six months and was not a    fraternity man. There are so many coming and going! Nor that the    faculty should be mindful of the lawless, irresponsible boy, and    not of the genius that developed on its own lines and was never    conventionalized but always remained a sinner however brilliant, and    a flayer of good men unblessed with a saving sense of humor. If there    is any kind thought for me in my old home it is because I did what    Field couldn't do, paid outward respect to the environment. It was    possible for me to see his point of view and theirs--to them    irreconcilable, and to him also.      Sincerely yours,      S.B. GRIFFIN.    Mr. Tufts's memorandum-book shows that Eugene returned to Monson April  27th, 1889, so his experience, if not his education, at Williams  covered almost eight months of an impressionable period of his life. It  is interesting to record the comment of Mrs. Tufts on the return of the  wanderer to her indulgent care. \"He was too smart for the professors at  Williams,\" said she; \"because they did not understand him, they could  not pardon his eccentricities.\" That she did understand her husband's  favorite pupil is evidenced in the following brief description, given  off-hand to the writer: \"Eugene was not much of a student, but very  much of an irrepressible boy. There was no malice in his pranks, only  the inherited disposition to tease somebody and everybody.\"    On July 5th, 1869, Eugene was summoned to St. Louis by the serious  illness of his father, who died July 12th.    Thus ended his education, so far as it was to be affected by the  environments and instructors of New England. Thenceforth he was  destined to be a western man, with an ineradicable tang of Puritan  prejudices and convictions cropping out unexpectedly and incongruously  in all he thought and wrote.    In the autumn of 1869 Eugene entered the sophomore class at Knox  College, Galesburg, Ill., where Professor John William Burgess, who  had been chosen as his guardian, held the chair of logic, rhetoric,  English literature, and political science. But his career at Knox was  practically a repetition of that at Williams. He chafed under the  restraint of set rules and the requirement of attention to studies  in which he took no interest. If he had been allowed to choose, he  would have devoted his time to reading the Latin classics and  declaiming--that is, as much time as he could spare from plaguing  the professors and interrupting the studies of his companions by  every device of a festive and fertile imagination.    One year of this was enough for the faculty of Knox and for the  restless scholar, so in the autumn of 1870 Eugene joined his brother  Roswell in the junior class at the University of Missouri. Here Eugene  Field ended, without graduating, such education as the school and the  university was ever to give him, for in the spring of 1871 he left  Columbia for St. Louis, never to return--a student at three  universities and a graduate from none.    Of Eugene Field's life in Columbia many stories abound there and  throughout Missouri. From the aged and honored historian of the  university I have the following testimony as to the relations of the  two brothers with that institution, premising it with the fact that all  the official records of students were consumed in the fire that visited  the university in 1892:    Roswell M. Field attended the university as a freshman in 1868-69, as a  sophomore in 1869-70, and as a junior in 1870-71. He was a student of  the institution these three sessions only. His brother Eugene Field was  a student of the junior class, session 1870-71, and never before or  since.    I knew both of them well. Eugene was an inattentive, indifferent  student, making poor progress in the studies of the course--a genial,  sportive, song-singing, fun-making companion. Nevertheless he was  bright, sparkling, entertaining and a leader among \"the boys.\" In truth  he was in intellect above his fellows and a genius along his favorite  lines. He was prolific of harmless pranks and his school life was a big  joke.    [Illustration: THE OLD KNOX COLLEGE BUILDINGS, GALESBURG. ILL.]    There has been preserved the following specimen of the \"rigs\" Eugene  was in the habit of grinding out at the expense of the faculty--this  being aimed at President Daniel Reed (1868-77). The poem is entitled:      _BUCEPHALUS: A TAIL.      Twelve by the clock and all is well--    That is, I think so, but who can tell?    So quiet and still the city seems    That even old Luna's brightest beams    Cannot a single soul discover    Upon the streets the whole town over.      The Marshal smiles a genial smile    And retires to snooze for a little while,    To dream of billies and dirks and slings,    The calaboose and such pleasant things.    The college dig now digs for bed    With bunged-up eyes and aching head,    Conning his lesson o'er and o'er,    Till an audible melodious snore    Tells that he's going the kingdom through    Where Greek's at a discount and Latin, too.      The Doctor, robed in his snowy white,    Gazes out from his window height,    And he bends to the breezes his noble form,    Like a stately oak in a thunderstorm,    And watches his sleek and well-fed cows    At the expense of the college browse.    His prayers are said; out goes the light;    Good-night; O learned pres, good-night.      Half-past five by Ficklin's time    When I again renew my rhyme;    Old Sol is up and the college dig    Resumes his musty, classic gig,    \"Caesar venit celere jam.\"    With here and there an auxiliary--    The Marshal awakes and stalks around    With an air importantly profound,    And seizing on a luckless wight    Who quietly stayed at home all night    On a charge of not preserving order,    Drags him before the just Recorder.      In vain the hapless youth denies it;    A barroom loafer testifies it.    \"Fine him,\" the court-house rabble shout    (This is the latest jury out).    So when his pocketbook is eased    Most righteous justice is appeased.      The Doctor lay in his little bed,    His night-cap 'round his God-like head,    With a blanket thick and snowy sheet    Enveloped his l---- pshaw! and classical feet,    And he cleared his throat and began: \"My dear,    As well in Indiana as here--    I always took a morning ride,    With you, my helpmeet, by my side.      \"This morning is so clear and cool,    We'll ride before it's time for school.    Holloa, there John! you lazy cuss!    Bring forth my horse, Bucephalus!\"    So spake the man of letters. Straight    Black John went through the stable gate,    But soon returned with hair on end,    While terror wings his speed did lend,    And out he sent his piteous wail:    \"O boss! Old Bucky's lost his tail!\"      Down went the night-cap on the ground,    Hats, boots and clothing flying round;    In vain his helpmeet cried \"Hold on!\"    He went right through that sable John.    Sing, sing, O Muse, what deeds were done    This morn by God-like Peleus' son;    Descend, O fickle Goddess, urge    My lyre to his bombastic splurge.      Boots and the man I sing, who first    Those Argive machinations cursed;    His swimming eyes did Daniel raise    To that sad tail of other days,    And cried \"Alas! what ornery cuss    Has shaved you, my Bucephalus?\"    Then turning round he gently sighed,    \"We will postpone our morning ride.\"      In wrath I smite my quivering lyre,    Come once again, fair Muse, inspire    My song to more heroic acts    Than these poor simple, truthful facts.    Cursed be the man who hatched the plot!    Let dire misfortune be his lot!    Palsied the hand that struck the blow!    Blind be the eyes that saw the show!    Hated the wretch who ruthless bled    This innocent old quadruped.      Subpreps, a word of caution, please;    Better prepare your A, B, C's    Than prowl around at dead of night.    Don't rouse the beast in Daniel's breast;    Perhaps you'll come out second best.      Dear, gentle reader, pardon, pray,    I'm thinking now I hear you say,    \"Oh, nonsense! what a foolish fuss    About a horse, Bucephalus.\"_    This is no better verse, and possibly no worse, than much of the  adolescent doggerel that is so often preserved by fond parents to  prove that their child early gave signs of poetic and literary genius.    [Illustration: STATE UNIVERSITY BUILDINGS AT COLUMBIA, MO.]          CHAPTER VI    CHOICE OF A PROFESSION      Eugene Field was in his twenty-first year when he turned his back upon  the colleges and faced life. Roswell M. Field, Sr., had been dead two  years, and the moderate fortune which he had left, consisting mostly of  realty valued at about $60,000, had not yet been distributed among the  legatees, Eugene and Roswell M. Field and Mary French Field. To the  last named one-fifth had been willed in recognition of the loving care  she had bestowed upon the testator's two motherless sons, each of whom  was to receive two-fifths of the father's estate. Eugene therefore  looked forward to "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/12985"],[0,"Eugene Field, a Study in Heredity and Contradictions â€” Volume 2 (#13)"],[1,"fact, had scarcely reached his first politico    medical phrase--when in came Roche (fresh from his bridal tour    through Colorado) with a thunder-gust of tedious experiences. The    Dock bore the infliction with Christian fortitude and thanked God    when Roche left. In a moment or two thereafter, however, a Kansas    City friend of mine called--very drunk, and not finding me, insisted    upon discussing me, my work, and my prospects, with the Dock. John    Thatcher dropped in subsequently, and so the Dock had quite a    matinee of it. By the time I got back to the office the old    gentleman was as vaporish as a hysterical old woman and he vented    his spleen on my unoffending head. God knows what a trial that man    is to me! Yet I try to be respectful and kind to him, for age is    entitled to that much tribute at least from youth. Since penning    these lines I have read them to the Dock and it would do your soul    good to see him squirm.      We are all well. When are you coming home? Paying postage on daily    letters to Canada is swiftly bankrupting me; then, too, it is a long    time since I had a square meal. But, japes, bourds, and mockages    aside, we miss you and will be glad to see you back. Salutations to    the home folk.      Yours in friendship,      EUGENE FIELD.    The pen-picture in this letter of the delays, intrusions, and  interruptions that aroused Dr. Reilly's ire is a fair portrayal of  the difficulties under which the editorial staff worked in those days.  Field was the only one who could shut himself away from such annoyances  to do his own wood-sawing. But when released from this, he delighted  to add to the tribulations of his less erratic associates by his  never-ending \"japes, bourds, and mockages.\"      X      CHICAGO, Wednesday, September 22d, 1886.      A second letter came from you to-day, dear boy, and I am glad to    hear that you are enjoying yourself, although I made mone passing    measure when I learned that the caitiff Brunswick knight had    forejusted you at tennis. I don't know why the revered Miss Mollie    Tillie deems me a capricious man and a fickle; nor can I imagine.    You should not suffer her to missay me so grievously. Where could    the skeptical damosell have found a person more faithful than I have    been in writing each day to her big brother? But if Miss Mollie    throws me overboard, so to speak, I shall look to her bustling    sister, Miss Nellie, for less capricious friendship. \"_Varium et    mutabile semper foemina._\"      Poor old Dock! He comes into the room and leaves his key sticking in    the door; to complicate matters still further, he leaves another key    sticking in the book-case. When I reproach him with these evidences    of a failing mind, he smiles and cries. I wish he were here that I    might read these lines to him. Then there is Cowen--but I will not    fill this letter with incoherent criminations. The enclosed sketch    will explain all.      It represents a scene in this office. I have stepped out to post a    letter to you. Coming back I peep in at the window and behold baby    Dock in his high-chair weeping lustily, whilst baby Cowen has crept    out of his chair, toddled to the wall and is reaching for his    _bottle_! Betwixt the hysterics of the one babe and the bottle    of t'other I am well-nigh exhausted. Come back and take care of your    babies yourself!    [Illustration: A SCENE IN THE DAILY NEWS OFFICE.  _From a drawing by Eugene Field._]      I do not see that any effort is being made to get out a better    paper. The sheet has been simply rotten, and everybody says so--even    the dogs are barking about it. Meanwhile I am sawing wood. I am    reading a great deal. Read Mrs. Gordon's Life of Christopher North,    parts of Burns's poems, life of Dr. Faustus, and Morte D'Arthur    since you left, and hope to read Goethe's poems, Life of Bunyan,    Homer's works, Sartor Resartus and Rasselas before you get back. I    have about made up my mind to do little outside writing for four or    five months and to do a prodigious amount of reading instead.      My wife will be back to-morrow evening; as I am to meet her at the    station, I may not have time to write you your daily note. She    writes me that she has had a bad cold ever since she reached St.    Louis and is heartily glad that she is coming home. Dunlap, of the    McCaul Company, invites me to be his guest at the Southern Hotel    while the company sings in St. Louis, but that sort of thing is out    of the question. Do you intend to go to Indianapolis with me? E----    W---- has been very friendly of late. I suspect he is getting hard    up. B----'s latest fad is to organize a Friday night club to discuss    literature, art, science, etc. Hearing him talk about it to-day gave    the old Dock a violent attack of nausea. Speaking of nausea reminds    me that P---- has been seriously indisposed for two days as the    consequence of eating nine peaches, two apples, and a pound of    grapes! He is satisfied, however, that this variable fall weather is    very trying. Shackelford is off on his vacation, but I do not    complain, since I find Rogers, his substitute, a pleasant gentleman    to do Saturday business with....      Affectionately yours,      EUGENE FIELD.    An interesting point in this letter is its reference to his proposed  first appearance as a reader after coming to Chicago before the  convention of Western Association of Writers at Indianapolis. Previous  to this, during our acquaintance he had repeatedly declined requests to  appear upon the platform. But in this case he was persuaded by Richard  Lew Dawson, the secretary of the association, to make an exception in  its favor. In a letter to Mr. Dawson, under date of September 3d, 1886,  Field gives the following interesting estimate of some of his own work:      \"Since reading your last letter, I have thought that it might be    wise for me to contribute to your programme the following pieces,    which exhibit pretty nearly all styles of my work:      1. Death and the Soldier       Prose.    10 minutes.    2. The Humane Lad (new)        Verse.     3 minutes    3. The Noontide Hymn (new)     Verse.     3 minutes    4. The Merciful Lad (new)      Verse.     2 minutes    5. The Divine Lullaby (new)    Verse.     2 minutes.      \"The reading of these pieces will require not more than twenty    minutes, and I would prefer to give them consecutively. Numbers 2    and 4 are humorous. I do not like 'Death and the Soldier' as much as    'The First Christmas Tree,' the 'Robin and the Violet,' or 'The    Mountain and the Sea'--I mean I do not like it so much as a piece of    fanciful literary work, but it may be more catchy. You know what    your audience will like, and I leave the matter in your hands.\"    Field closed his letter with a request that an invitation should be  extended to me, which I duly received. This accounts for the reference  to an approaching visit to Indianapolis in his letter of September 22d.    By the way, Field got more pleasure out of the various pronunciations  of Goethe's name than instruction from the perusal of his poems. He was  always starting or fostering discussions over it, as in the following  paragraph:      The valued New York Life asserts that Chicago used to rhyme \"Goethe\"    with \"teeth\" until the Renaissance set in, since which epoch it has    rhymed it with \"ity.\" This is hardly fair. In a poem read recently    before the Hyde Park Toboggan Slide Lyceum the following couplet    occurred:        _\"Until at last John Wolfgang Goethe      Was gathered home, upward of eighty.\"_    To resume the Fredericton series of letters:      XI      CHICAGO, Sunday the 26th, 1886.      Dear Boy:--Such a close, muggy night this is that I feel little like    writing to you or to anybody else. Yet I am not one to neglect or    shirk a duty. I have been with Kate Field all the evening, and we    have discussed everything from literature down to Sir Charles Dilke    and back again. A mighty smart woman is Kate! My wife returned from    St. Louis last Thursday, bringing about fifty of my books with her.    They were mostly of the Bohn's Library series, but among them was a    set of Boswell's Johnson, Routledge edition of 1859. I want you to    have an edition of this kind, and I have sent to New York to see if    it can be had (cheap). I am reading like a race-horse. The famous    history of Dr. Faustus has done me a power of good, and I have been    highly amused with a volume of Bohn which contains the old Ray    proverbs.      Isn't it about time for you to be getting back home? You have been    gone about sixteen days now, and we are growing more and more    lonesome. Peattie is looked for next Tuesday. Mr. Stone goes out of    town to-morrow--to Dakota, I believe--and is to be absent for a week    also. Shackelford will be back at work to-morrow. You alone are    delinquent. Not only am I lonesome--egad, I am starving! So if you    don't come _in propria persona_, at least _send_ something. The old    Dock has been as grumpy as a bear to-day and I have had a hard time    bearing with him. He announced to me to-day that he thought that I    was fickle--I tell you this so that you may repeat it to Miss Marie    Mathilde, who, I believe, invented that opinion. _Entre nous_:    Hawkins tells me that some of his friends are trying to buy the St.    Paul Dispatch for him. There was a fire in the Chicago Opera House    building to-night, but, unfortunately, no serious damage was done.      Stone is thinking of having the three of us--Dock, you and your    habit--write a department for the Saturday News after the fashion of    the Noctes. Think it all over whilst you are away. What are you    going to bring me for a present? Don't go to buying any foolish    trumpery; you have no money to waste on follies. What I need is a    \"Noctes,\" and any other useful book you may get hold"]]]
