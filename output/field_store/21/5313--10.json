Heavy footsteps retreated,  then Andrew heard them once more grumbling and booming below him.    After that his head cleared rapidly. Two windows were open in this  higher room, and a sharp current of the night wind blew across him,  clearing his mind as rapidly as wind blows away a fog. Now he made out  that one man had not left him; the dark outline of him was by the  bed, waiting.    \"Who's there?\" asked Andrew. \"Allister. Take it easy.\"    \"I'm all right. I'll go down again to the boys.\"    \"That's what I'm here to talk to you about, kid. Are you sure your  head's clear?\"    \"Yep. Sure thing.\"    \"Then listen to me, Lanning, while I talk. It's important. Stay here  till the morning, then ride on.\"    \"Where?\"    \"Oh, away from Martindale, that's all.\"    \"Out of the desert? Out of the mountains?\"    \"Of course. They'll hunt for you here.\" Allister paused, then went on.  \"And when you get away what'll you do? Go straight?\"    \"God willing,\" said Andrew fervently. \"It--it was only luck, bad luck,  that put me where I am.\"    The outlaw scratched a match and lighted a candle; then he dropped a  little of the melted tallow on a box, and by that light he peered  earnestly into Andrew's face. He appeared to need this light to read the  expression on it. It also enabled Andrew to see the face of Allister.  Sometimes the play of shadows made that face unreal as a dream,  sometimes the face was filled with poetic beauty, sometimes the light  gleamed on the scar and the sardonic smile, and then it was a face  out of hell.    \"You're going to get away from the mountain desert and go straight,\"  said Allister.    \"That's it.\" He saw that the outlaw was staring with a smile, half grim  and half sad, into the shadows and far away.    \"Lanning, let me tell you. You'll never get away.\"    \"You don't understand,\" said Andrew. \"I don't like fighting. It--it  makes me sick inside. I'm not a brave man!\"    He waited to see the contempt come on the face of the famous leader, but  there was nothing but grave attention.    \"Why,\" Andy went on in a rush of confidence, \"everybody in Martindale  knows that I'm not a fighter. Those fellows downstairs think that I'm a  sort of bad hombre. I'm not. Why, Allister, when I turned over Buck  Heath and saw his face, I nearly fainted, and then--\"    \"Wait,\" cut in the other. \"That was your first man. You didn't kill him,  but you thought you had. You nearly fainted, then. But as I gather it,  after you shot Bill Dozier you simply sat on your horse and waited. Did  you feel like fainting then?\"    \"No,\" explained Andrew hastily. \"I wanted to go after them and shoot'em  all. They could have rushed me and taken me prisoner easily, but they  wanted to shoot me from a distance--and it made me mad to see them work  it. I--I hated them all, and I had a reason for it. Curse them!\"    He added hurriedly: \"But I've no grudge against anybody. All I want is a  chance to live quiet and clean.\"    There was a faint sigh from Allister.    \"Lanning,\" he murmured, \"the minute I laid eyes on you, I knew you were  one of my kind. In all my life I've known only one other with that same  chilly effect in his eyes--that was Marshal Langley--only he happened to  be on the side of the law. No matter. He had the iron dust in him. He  was cut out to be a man-killer. You say you want to get away: Lanning,  you can't do it. Because you can't get away from yourself. I'm making a  long talk to you, but you're worth it. I tell you I read your mind. You  plan on riding north and getting out of the mountain desert before the  countryside there is raised against you, the way it's raised to the  south. In the first place, I don't think you'll get away. Hal Dozier is  on your trail, and he'll get to the north and raise the whole district  and stop you before you hit the towns. You'll have to go back to the  mountain desert. You'll have to do it eventually, why not do it now?  Lanning, if I had you at my back I could laugh at the law the rest of  our lives! Stay with me. I can tell a man when I see him. I saw you call  Larry la Roche. And I've never wanted a man the way I want you. Not to  follow me, but as a partner. Shake and say you will!\"    The slender hand was stretched out through the shadows, the light from  the candle flashed on it. And a power outside his own will made Andrew  move his hand to meet it. He stopped the gesture with a violent effort.    The swift voice of the outlaw, with a fiber of earnest persuasion in it,  went on: \"You see what I risk to get you. Hal Dozier is on your trail.  He's the only man in the world I'd think twice about before I met him  face to face. But if I join to you, I'll have to meet him sooner or  later. Well, Lanning, I'll take that risk. I know he's more devil than  man when it comes to gun play, but we'll meet him together. Give me  your hand!\"    There was a riot in the brain of Andrew Lanning. The words of the outlaw  had struck something in him that was like metal chiming on metal. Iron  dust? That was it! The call of one blood to another, and he realized the  truth of what Allister said. If he touched the hand of this man, there  would be a bond between them which only death could break. In one  blinding rush he sensed the strength and the faith of Allister.    But another voice was at his ear, and he saw Anne Withero, as she had  stood for that moment in his arms in her room. It came over him with a  chill like cold moonlight.    \"Do you fear me?\" he had whispered.    \"No.\"    \"Will you remember me?\"    \"Forever!\"    And with that ghost of a voice in his ear Andrew Lanning groaned to the  man beside him: \"Partner, I know you're nine-tenths man, and I thank you  out of the bottom of my heart. But there's some one else has a claim to  me--I don't belong to myself.\"    There was a breathless pause. Anger contracted the face of Henry  Allister; he nodded gravely.    \"It's the girl you went back to see,\" he said.    \"Yes.\"    \"Well, then, go ahead and try to win through. I wish you luck. But if  you fail, remember what I've said. Now, or ten years from now, what I've  said goes for you. Now roll over and sleep. Good-by, Lanning, or,  rather, au revoir!\"          CHAPTER 15      The excitement kept Andrew awake for a little time, but then the hum of  the wind, the roll of voices below him, and the weariness of the long  ride rushed on him like a wave and washed him out into an ebb of sleep.    When he wakened the aches were gone from his limbs, and his mind was a  happy blank. Only when he started up from his blankets and rapped his  head against the slanting rafters just above him, he was brought to a  painful realization of where he was. He turned, scowling, and the first  thing he saw was a piece of brown wrapping paper held down by a shoe and  covered with a clumsy scrawl.      These blankets are yours and the slicker along with    them and heres wishin you luck while youre beatin it    back to civlizashun. your friend, JEFF RANKIN.    Andy glanced swiftly about the room and saw that the other bunks had  been removed. He swept up the blankets and went down the stairs to the  first floor. The house reeked of emptiness; broken bottles, a twisted  tin plate in which some one had set his heel, were the last signs of the  outlaws of Henry Allister's gang. A bundle stood on the table with  another piece of the wrapping paper near it. The name of Andrew Lanning  was on the outside. He unfolded the sheet and read in a precise, rather  feminine writing:      Dear Lanning: We are, in a manner, sneaking off.    I've already said good-by, and I don't want to tempt    you again. Now you're by yourself and you've got your    own way to fight. The boys agree with me. We all want    to see you make good. We'll all be sorry if you come    back to us. But once you've found out that it's no go    trying to beat back to good society, we'll be mighty    happy to have you with us. In the meantime, we want    to do our bit to help Andrew Lanning make up for his    bad luck.      For my part, I've put a chamois sack on top of the    leather coat with the fur lining. You'll find a little    money in that purse. Don't be foolish. Take the money    I leave you, and, when you're back on your feet, I know    that you'll repay it at your own leisure.      And here's best luck to you and the girl.      HENRY ALLISTER.    Andrew lifted the chamois sack carelessly, and out of its mouth tumbled  a stream of gold. One by one he picked up the pieces and replaced them;  he hesitated, and then put the sack in his pocket. How could he refuse a  gift so delicately made?    A broken kitchen knife had been thrust through a bit of the paper on the  box. He read this next:      Your hoss is known. So I'm leaving you one in place    of the pinto. He goes good and he dont need no spurring    but when you come behind him keep watching    your step. your pal, LARRY LA ROCHE.    Blankets and slicker, money, horse. A flask of whisky stood on another  slip of the paper. And the writing on this was much more legible.      Here's a friend in need. When you come to a pinch,    use it. And when you come to a bigger pinch send word    to your friend, SCOTTIE MACDOUGAL.    Andrew picked it up, set it down again, and smiled. On the fur coat  there was a fifth tag. Not one of the five, then, had forgotten him.      Its comin on cold, partner. Take this coat and welcome.    When the snows get on the mountains if you    aint out of the desert put on this coat and think of your    partner,                                      JOE CLUNE.      P.S.--I seen you first, and I have first call on you over    the rest of these gents and you can figure that you have    first call on me.                                 J.C.

The  sympathetic condolence of their respective replies was cut short by  Raven's announcement of 'dinner on table.'    The conversation that took place when the wine was in circulation, and  the ladies were withdrawn, we shall report with our usual scrupulous  fidelity.      MR GLOWRY    You are leaving England, Mr Cypress. There is a delightful melancholy  in saying farewell to an old acquaintance, when the chances are twenty  to one against ever meeting again. A smiling bumper to a sad parting,  and let us all be unhappy together.      MR CYPRESS (_filling a bumper_)    This is the only social habit that the disappointed spirit never  unlearns.      THE REVEREND MR LARYNX (_filling_)    It is the only piece of academical learning that the finished educatee  retains.      MR FLOSKY (_filling_)    It is the only objective fact which the sceptic can realise.      SCYTHROP (_filling_)    It is the only styptic for a bleeding heart.      THE HONOURABLE MR LISTLESS (_filling_)    It is the only trouble that is very well worth taking.      MR ASTERIAS (_filling_)    It is the only key of conversational truth.      MR TOOBAD (_filling_)    It is the only antidote to the great wrath of the devil.      MR HILARY (_filling_)    It is the only symbol of perfect life. The inscription 'HIC NON  BIBITUR' will suit nothing but a tombstone.      MR GLOWRY    You will see many fine old ruins, Mr Cypress; crumbling pillars, and  mossy walls--many a one-legged Venus and headless Minerva--many a  Neptune buried in sand--many a Jupiter turned topsy-turvy--many a  perforated Bacchus doing duty as a water-pipe--many reminiscences of  the ancient world, which I hope was better worth living in than the  modern; though, for myself, I care not a straw more for one than the  other, and would not go twenty miles to see any thing that either  could show.      MR CYPRESS    It is something to seek, Mr Glowry. The mind is restless, and must  persist in seeking, though to find is to be disappointed. Do you feel  no aspirations towards the countries of Socrates and Cicero? No wish  to wander among the venerable remains of the greatness that has passed  for ever?      MR GLOWRY    Not a grain.      SCYTHROP    It is, indeed, much the same as if a lover should dig up the buried  form of his mistress, and gaze upon relics which are any thing but  herself, to wander among a few mouldy ruins, that are only imperfect  indexes to lost volumes of glory, and meet at every step the more  melancholy ruins of human nature--a degenerate race of stupid and  shrivelled slaves, grovelling in the lowest depths of servility and  superstition.      THE HONOURABLE MR LISTLESS    It is the fashion to go abroad. I have thought of it myself, but am  hardly equal to the exertion. To be sure, a little eccentricity and  originality are allowable in some cases; and the most eccentric and  original of all characters is an Englishman who stays at home.      SCYTHROP    I should have no pleasure in visiting countries that are past all hope  of regeneration. There is great hope of our own; and it seems to me  that an Englishman, who, either by his station in society, or by his  genius, or (as in your instance, Mr Cypress,) by both, has the power  of essentially serving his country in its arduous struggle with its  domestic enemies, yet forsakes his country, which is still so rich  in hope, to dwell in others which are only fertile in the ruins of  memory, does what none of those ancients, whose fragmentary memorials  you venerate, would have done in similar circumstances.      MR CYPRESS    Sir, I have quarrelled with my wife; and a man who has quarrelled with  his wife is absolved from all duty to his country. I have written an  ode to tell the people as much, and they may take it as they list.      SCYTHROP    Do you suppose, if Brutus had quarrelled with his wife, he would have  given it as a reason to Cassius for having nothing to do with his  enterprise? Or would Cassius have been satisfied with such an excuse?      MR FLOSKY    Brutus was a senator; so is our dear friend: but the cases are  different. Brutus had some hope of political good: Mr Cypress has  none. How should he, after what we have seen in France?      SCYTHROP    A Frenchman is born in harness, ready saddled, bitted, and bridled,  for any tyrant to ride. He will fawn under his rider one moment, and  throw him and kick him to death the next; but another adventurer  springs on his back, and by dint of whip and spur on he goes as  before. We may, without much vanity, hope better of ourselves.      MR CYPRESS    I have no hope for myself or for others. Our life is a false nature;  it is not in the harmony of things; it is an all-blasting upas,  whose root is earth, and whose leaves are the skies which rain their  poison-dews upon mankind. We wither from our youth; we gasp with  unslaked thirst for unattainable good; lured from the first to the  last by phantoms--love, fame, ambition, avarice--all idle, and all  ill--one meteor of many names, that vanishes in the smoke of death.[8]      MR FLOSKY    A most delightful speech, Mr Cypress. A most amiable and instructive  philosophy. You have only to impress its truth on the minds of  all living men, and life will then, indeed, be the desert and the  solitude; and I must do you, myself, and our mutual friends, the  justice to observe, that let society only give fair play at one and  the same time, as I flatter myself it is inclined to do, to your  system of morals, and my system of metaphysics, and Scythrop's system  of politics, and Mr Listless's system of manners, and Mr Toobad's  system of religion, and the result will be as fine a mental chaos as  even the immortal Kant himself could ever have hoped to see; in the  prospect of which I rejoice.      MR HILARY    'Certainly, ancient, it is not a thing to rejoice at:' I am one  of those who cannot see the good that is to result from all this  mystifying and blue-devilling of society. The contrast it presents  to the cheerful and solid wisdom of antiquity is too forcible not to  strike any one who has the least knowledge of classical literature. To  represent vice and misery as the necessary accompaniments of genius,  is as mischievous as it is false, and the feeling is as unclassical as  the language in which it is usually expressed.      MR TOOBAD    It is our calamity. The devil has come among us, and has begun by  taking possession of all the cleverest fellows. Yet, forsooth, this is  the enlightened age. Marry, how? Did our ancestors go peeping about  with dark lanterns, and do we walk at our ease in broad sunshine?  Where is the manifestation of our light? By what symptoms do you  recognise it? What are its signs, its tokens, its symptoms, its  symbols, its categories, its conditions? What is it, and why? How,  where, when is it to be seen, felt, and understood? What do we see by  it which our ancestors saw not, and which at the same time is worth  seeing? We see a hundred men hanged, where they saw one. We see five  hundred transported, where they saw one. We see five thousand in the  workhouse, where they saw one. We see scores of Bible Societies, where  they saw none. We see paper, where they saw gold. We see men in stays,  where they saw men in armour. We see painted faces, where they saw  healthy ones. We see children perishing in manufactories, where they  saw them flourishing in the fields. We see prisons, where they saw  castles. We see masters, where they saw representatives. In short,  they saw true men, where we see false knaves. They saw Milton, and we  see Mr Sackbut.      MR FLOSKY    The false knave, sir, is my honest friend; therefore, I beseech you,  let him be countenanced. God forbid but a knave should have some  countenance at his friend's request.      MR TOOBAD    'Good men and true' was their common term, like the chalos chagathos  of the Athenians. It is so long since men have been either good or  true, that it is to be questioned which is most obsolete, the fact or  the phraseology.      MR CYPRESS    There is no worth nor beauty but in the mind's idea. Love sows the  wind and reaps the whirlwind.[9] Confusion, thrice confounded, is the  portion of him who rests even for an instant on that most brittle of  reeds--the affection of a human being. The sum of our social destiny  is to inflict or to endure.[10]      MR HILARY    Rather to bear and forbear, Mr Cypress--a maxim which you perhaps  despise. Ideal beauty is not the mind's creation: it is real beauty,  refined and purified in the mind's alembic, from the alloy which  always more or less accompanies it in our mixed and imperfect nature.  But still the gold exists in a very ample degree. To expect too  much is a disease in the expectant, for which human nature is not  responsible; and, in the common name of humanity, I protest against  these false and mischievous ravings. To rail against humanity for not  being abstract perfection, and against human love for not realising  all the splendid visions of the poets of chivalry, is to rail at the  summer for not being all sunshine, and at the rose for not being  always in bloom.      MR CYPRESS    Human love! Love is not an inhabitant of the earth. We worship him as  the Athenians did their unknown God: but broken hearts are the martyrs  of his faith, and the eye shall never see the form which phantasy  paints, and which passion pursues through paths of delusive beauty,  among flowers whose odours are agonies, and trees whose gums are  poison.[11]      MR HILARY    You talk like a Rosicrucian, who will love nothing but a sylph, who  does not believe in the existence of a sylph, and who yet quarrels  with the whole universe for not containing a sylph.      MR CYPRESS    The mind is diseased of its own beauty, and fevers into false  creation. The forms which the sculptor's soul has seized exist only in"]]]
