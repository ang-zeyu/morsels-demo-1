And many other flowers close  and open their petals at certain hours of the day; and thus constitute  what Linneus calls the Horologe, or Watch of Flora. He enumerates 46  flowers, which possess this kind of sensibility. I shall mention a few of  them with their respective hours of rising and setting, as Linneus terms  them. He divides them first into _meteoric_ flowers, which less accurately  observe the hour of unfolding, but are expanded sooner or later, according  to the cloudiness, moisture, or pressure of the atmosphere. 2d. _Tropical_  flowers open in the morning and close before evening every day; but the  hour of the expanding becomes earlier or later, at the length of the day  increases or decreases. 3dly. _AEquinoctial_ flowers, which open at a  certain and exact hour of the day, and for the most part close at another  determinate hour.    Hence the Horologe or Watch of Flora is formed from numerous plants, of  which the following are those most common in this country. Leontodon  taraxacum, Dandelion, opens at 5--6, closes at 8--9. Hieracium pilosella,  mouse-ear hawkweed, opens at 8, closes at 2. Sonchus laevis, smooth  Sow-thistle, at 5 and at 11--12. Lactuca sativa, cultivated Lettice, at  7 and jo. Tragopogon luteum, yellow Goatsbeard, at 3--5 and at 9--10.  Lapsana, nipplewort, at 5--6 and at 10--1. Nymphaea alba, white water  lily, at 7 and 5. Papaver nudicaule, naked poppy, at 5 and at 7.  Hemerecallis fulva, tawny Day-lily, at 5 and at 7--8. Convolvulus, at  5--6. Malva, Mallow, at 9--10, and at 1. Arenarea purpurea, purple  Sandwort, at 9--10, and at 2--3. Anagallis, pimpernel, at 7--8. Portulaca  hortensis, garden Purilain, at 9--10, and at 11--12. Dianthus prolifer,  proliferous Pink, at 8 and at 1. Cichoreum, Succory, at 4--5.  Hypochiaeris, at 6--7, and at 4--5. Crepis at 4--5, and at 10--II.  Picris, at 4--5, and at 12. Calendula field, at 9, and at 3. Calendula  African, at 7, and at 3--4.    As these observations were probably made in the botanic gardens at Upsal,  they must require further attention to suit them to our climate. See  Stillingfleet Calendar of Flora.]              Watch with nice eye the Earth's diurnal way,          Marking her solar and sidereal day,          Her slow nutation, and her varying clime,  170  And trace with mimic art the march of Time;          Round his light foot a magic chain they fling,          And count the quick vibrations of his wing.--          First in its brazen cell reluctant roll'd          Bends the dark spring in many a steely fold;  175  On spiral brass is stretch'd the wiry thong,          Tooth urges tooth, and wheel drives wheel along;          In diamond-eyes the polish'd axles flow,          Smooth slides the hand, the ballance pants below.          Round the white circlet in relievo bold  180  A Serpent twines his scaly length in gold;          And brightly pencil'd on the enamel'd sphere          Live the fair trophies of the passing year.          --Here _Time's_ huge fingers grasp his giant-mace,          And dash proud Superstition from her base,  185  Rend her strong towers and gorgeous fanes, and shed          The crumbling fragments round her guilty head.          There the gay _Hours_, whom wreaths of roses deck,          Lead their young trains amid the cumberous wreck;          And, slowly purpling o'er the mighty waste,  190  Plant the fair growths of Science and of Taste.          While each light _Moment_, as it dances by          With feathery foot and pleasure-twinkling eye,          Feeds from its baby-hand, with many a kiss,          The callow nestlings of domestic Bliss.    195  As yon gay clouds, which canopy the skies,          Change their thin forms, and lose their lucid dyes;          So the soft bloom of Beauty's vernal charms          Fades in our eyes, and withers in our arms.          --Bright as the silvery plume, or pearly shell,  200  The snow-white rose, or lily's virgin bell,          The fair HELLEBORAS attractive shone,          Warm'd every Sage, and every Shepherd won.--          Round the gay sisters press the _enamour'd bands_,          And seek with soft solicitude their hands.  205  --Ere while how chang'd!--in dim suffusion lies          The glance divine, that lighten'd in their eyes;      [_Helleborus_. I. 201. Many males, many females. The Helleborus niger,  or Christmas rose, has a large beautiful white flower, adorned with a  circle of tubular two-lipp'd nectarics. After impregnation the flower  undergoes a remarkable change, the nectaries drop off, but the white  corol remains, and gradually becomes quite green. This curious  metamorphose of the corol, when the nectaries fall off, seems to shew  that the white juices of the corol were before carried to the nectaries,  for the purpose of producing honey: because when these nectaries fall  off, no more of the white juice is secreted in the corol, but it becomes  green, and degenerates into a calyx. See note on Lonicera. The nectary of  the Tropaeolum, garden nasturtion, is a coloured horn growing from the  calyx.]              Cold are those lips, where smiles seductive hung,          And the weak accents linger on their tongue;          Each roseat feature fades to livid green,--  210  --Disgust with face averted shuts the scene.            So from his gorgeous throne, which awed the world,          The mighty Monarch of the east was hurl'd,          To dwell with brutes beneath the midnight storm,          By Heaven's just vengeance changed in mind and form.  215  --Prone to the earth He bends his brow superb,          Crops the young floret and the bladed herb;          Lolls his red tongue, and from the reedy side          Of slow Euphrates laps the muddy tide.          Long eagle-plumes his arching neck invest,  220  Steal round his arms, and clasp his sharpen'd breast;          Dark brinded hairs in bristling ranks, behind,          Rise o'er his back, and rustle in the wind,          Clothe his lank sides, his shrivel'd limbs surround,          And human hands with talons print the ground.  225  Silent in shining troops the Courtier-throng          Pursue their monarch as he crawls along;          E'en Beauty pleads in vain with smiles and tears,          Nor Flattery's self can pierce his pendant ears.            _Two_ Sister-Nymphs to Ganges' flowery brink  230  Bend their light steps, the lucid water drink,          Wind through the dewy rice, and nodding canes,          (As _eight_ black Eunuchs guard the sacred plains),          With playful malice watch the scaly brood,          And shower the inebriate berries on the flood.--  235  Stay in your crystal chambers, silver tribes!          Turn your bright eyes, and shun the dangerous bribes;          The tramel'd net with less destruction sweeps          Your curling shallows, and your azure deeps;          With less deceit, the gilded fly beneath,  240  Lurks the fell hook unseen,--to taste is death!--          --Dim your slow eyes, and dull your pearly coat,          Drunk on the waves your languid forms shall float,      [_Two Sister-Nymphs._ l. 229.

Then kneel'd the hoary Seer, to heaven address'd          His fiery eyes, and smote his sounding breast;          \"Bless ye the Lord!\" with thundering voice he cry'd,  260  \"Bless ye the Lord!\" the bending shores reply'd;          The winds and waters caught the sacred word,          And mingling echoes shouted \"Bless the Lord!\"          The listening shoals the quick contagion feel,          Pant on the floods, inebriate with their zeal,  265  Ope their wide jaws, and bow their slimy heads,          And dash with frantic fins their foamy beds.

The plants of this  class are almost all of them poisonous; the finest opium is procured by  wounding the heads of large poppies with a three-edged knife, and  tying muscle-shells to them to catch the drops.

Make a dot upon the card opposite the tip of the filament, taking  care not to disturb the position of either. In a few minutes observe that  the filament is no longer opposite the dot. Mark its position anew, and  continue thus until a circle is completed on the cardboard. This is a  rough way of conducting the experiment. Darwin's method will be found in  the footnote.[1]    [Footnote 1: \"Plants growing in pots were protected wholly from the light,  or had light admitted from above or on one side as the case might require,  and were covered above by a large horizontal sheet of glass, and with  another vertical sheet on one side. A glass filament, not thicker than a  horsehair, and from a quarter to three-quarters of an inch in length,  was affixed to the part to be observed by means of shellac dissolved in  alcohol. The solution was allowed to evaporate until it became so thick  that it set hard in two or three seconds, and it never injured the  tissues, even the tips of tender radicles, to which it was applied. To the  end of the glass filament an excessively minute bead of black sealing-wax  was cemented, below or behind which a bit of card with a black dot was  fixed to a stick driven into the ground.... The bead and the dot on the  card were viewed through the horizontal or vertical glass-plate (according  to the position of the object) and when one exactly covered the other, a  dot was made on the glass plate with a sharply pointed stick dipped in  thick India ink. Other dots were made at short intervals of time and these  were afterwards joined by straight lines. The figures thus traced were  therefore angular, but if dots had been made every one or two minutes, the  lines would have been more curvilinear.\"--The Power of Movement in Plants,  p. 6.]    The use of the glass filament is simply to increase the size of the circle  described, and thus make visible the movements of the stem. All young  parts of stems are continually moving in circles or ellipses. \"To learn  how the sweeps are made, one has only to mark a line of dots along the  upper side of the outstretched revolving end of such a stem, and to note  that when it has moved round a quarter of a circle, these dots will be on  one side; when half round, the dots occupy the lower side; and when the  revolution is completed, they are again on the upper side. That is, the  stem revolves by bowing itself over to one side,--is either pulled over or  pushed over, or both, by some internal force, which acts in turn all round  the stem in the direction in which it sweeps; and so the stem makes its  circuits without twisting.\"[1]    [Footnote 1: How Plants Behave. By Asa Gray. Ivison, Blakeman, Taylor &  Co., New York, 1872. Page 13.]    The nature of the movement is thus a successive nodding to all the points  of the compass, whence it is called by Darwin _circumnutation_. The  movement belongs to all young growing parts of plants. The great sweeps of  a twining stem, like that of the Morning-Glory, are only an increase in  the size of the circle or ellipse described.[1]    [Footnote 1: \"In the course of the present volume it will be shown  that apparently every growing part of every plant is continually  circumnutating, though often on a small scale. Even the stems of seedlings  before they have broken through the ground, as well as their buried  radicles, circumnutate, as far as the pressure of the surrounding earth  permits. In this universally present movement we have the basis or  groundwork for the acquirement, according to the requirements of the  plant, of the most diversified movements. Thus the great sweeps made by  the stems of the twining plants, and by the tendrils of other climbers,  result from a mere increase in the amplitude of the ordinary movement of  circumnutation.\"--The Power of Movement in Plants, p. 3.]    When a young stem of a Morning-Glory, thus revolving, comes in contact  with a support, it will twist around it, unless the surface is too smooth  to present any resistance to the movement of the plant. Try to make  it twine up a glass rod. It will slip up the rod and fall off. The  Morning-Glory and most twiners move around from left to right like the  hands of a clock, but a few turn from right to left.    While this subject is under consideration, the tendrils of the Pea and  Bean and the twining petioles of the Nasturtium will be interesting for  comparison. The movements can be made visible by the same method as was  used for the stem of the Morning-Glory. Tendrils and leaf petioles are  often sensitive to the touch. If a young leaf stalk of Clematis be rubbed  for a few moments, especially on the under side, it will be found in a day  or two to be turned inward, and the tendrils of the Cucumber vine will  coil in a few minutes after being thus irritated.[1] The movements of  tendrils are charmingly described in the chapter entitled \"How Plants  Climb,\" in the little treatise by Dr. Gray, already mentioned.    [Footnote 1: Reader in Botany. X. Climbing Plants.]    The so-called \"sleep of plants\" is another similar movement. The Oxalis is  a good example. The leaves droop and close together at night, protecting  them from being chilled by too great radiation.    The cause of these movements is believed to lie in changes of tension  preceding growth in the tissues of the stem.[1] Every stem is in a state  of constant tension. Naudin has thus expressed it, \"the interior of every  stem is too large for its Jacket.\"[2] If a leaf-stalk of Nasturtium be  slit vertically for an inch or two, the two halves will spring back  abruptly. This is because the outer tissues of the stem are stretched,  and spring back like india-rubber when released. If two stalks twining  in opposite directions be slit as above described, the side of the stem  towards which each stalk is bent will spring back more than the other,  showing the tension to be greater on that side. A familiar illustration of  this tension will be found in the Dandelion curls of our childhood.    [Footnote 1: See Physiological Botany. By Geo. L. Goodale. Ivison & Co.,  New York, 1885. Page 406.]    [Footnote 2: The following experiment exhibits the phenomenon of tension  very strikingly. \"From a long and thrifty young internode of grapevine  cut a piece that shall measure exactly one hundred units, for instance,  millimeters. From this section, which measures exactly one hundred  millimeters, carefully separate the epidermal structures in strips, and  place the strips at once under an inverted glass to prevent drying;  next, separate the pith in a single unbroken piece wholly freed from the  ligneous tissue. Finally, remeasure the isolated portions, and compare  with the original measure of the internode. There will be found an  appreciable shortening of the epidermal tissues and a marked increase in  length of the pith.\"--Physiological Botany, p. 391.]    The movements of the Sensitive Plant are always very interesting to  pupils, and it is said not to be difficult to raise the plants in the  schoolroom. The whole subject, indeed, is one of the most fascinating  that can be found, and its literature is available, both for students and  teachers. Darwin's essay on \"Climbing Plants,\" and his later work on the  \"Power of Movement in Plants,\" Dr. Gray's \"How Plants Behave,\" and the  chapter on \"Movements\" in the \"Physiological Botany,\" will offer a wide  field for study and experiment.    3. _Structure of Stems_.--Let the pupils collect a series of branches of  some common tree or shrub, from the youngest twig up to as large a branch  as they can cut, and describe them. Poplar, Elm, Oak, Lilac, etc., will be  found excellent for the purpose.    While discussing these descriptions, a brief explanation of  plant-structure may be given. In treating this subject, the teacher must  govern himself by the needs of his class, and the means at his command.  Explanations requiring the use of a compound microscope do not enter  necessarily into these lessons. The object aimed at is to teach the pupils  about the things which they can see and handle for themselves. Looking at  sections that others have prepared is like looking at pictures; and, while  useful in opening their eyes and minds to the wonders hidden from our  unassisted sight, fails to give the real benefit of scientific training.  Plants are built up of cells. The delicate-walled spherical, or polygonal,  cells which make up the bulk of an herbaceous stem, constitute cellular  tissue (_parenchyma_). This was well seen in the stem of the cutting of  Bean in which the roots had begun to form.[1] The strengthening fabric  in almost all flowering plants is made up of woody bundles, or woody  tissue.[2] The wood-cells are cells which are elongated and with thickened  walls. There are many kinds of them. Those where the walls are very thick  and the cavity within extremely small are _fibres_. A kind of cell, not  strictly woody, is where many cells form long vessels by the breaking away  of the connecting walls. These are _ducts_. These two kinds of cells  are generally associated together in woody bundles, called therefore  fibro-vascular bundles. We have already spoken of them as making the dots  on the leaf-scars, and forming the strengthening fabric of the leaves.[3]    [Footnote 1: See page 46.]    [Footnote 2: If elements of the same kind are untied, they constitute a  tissue to which is given the name of those elements; thus parenchyma cells  form parenchyma tissue or simply parenchyma; cork-cells form cork, etc. A  tissue can therefore be defined as a fabric of united cells which have had  a common origin and obeyed a common law of growth.--Physiological Botany.  p. 102.]    [Footnote 3: See page 58.]    We will now examine our series of branches. The youngest twigs, in spring  or early summer, are covered with a delicate, nearly colorless skin.  Beneath this is a layer of"]]]
