The latter engaged Champlain as his lieutenant, and  also sent out Du Pont Grave in command of the second vessel, as head  of the trading operations. This time, on the advice of Champlain, the  expedition made its way directly to the St. Lawrence River, stopping  first at Tadoussac, where Du Pont Grave proceeded to take very strong  measures with the Basque seamen, who were infringing his monopoly by  trading with the natives in furs. Apparently they were still allowed  to continue their whale fishery.    Once more Champlain heard from the Montagnais Indians of the great  Salt Sea to the north of Saguenay, in other words, the southern  extension of Hudson's Bay; and in his book he notes that the English  in these latter years \"had gone thither to find their way to China\".  However, he kept his intent fixed on the establishment of a French  colony along the St. Lawrence, and may be said to have founded the  city of Quebec (the site of which was then covered with nut trees) on  the 4th of July, 1608. Then his enterprise was near being wrecked by a  base conspiracy got up between a surgeon and a number of French  artisans, who believed that by seizing and killing Champlain, and then  handing over the infant settlement to the Spanish Basques, they might  enable these traders and fishermen with their good strong ships to  overcome Du Pont Grave, and seize the whole country. Naturally (they  believed) the Basques would reward the conspirators, who would thus at  a stroke become rich men. They none of them wished to go to France,  but would live here independent of outside interference. A  conspirator, however, revealed the plot to Champlain as he was  planting one of the little gardens which he started as soon as he had  been in a place a few days. He went about his business very  discreetly, arrested all the leading conspirators, gave them a fair  trial, had the ringleader executed by Pont Grave, and sent three  others back to France. After this he settled down at Quebec for the  winter, taking care, however, in the month of October, to plant seeds  and vines for coming up in the spring.    In the summer of 1609 Champlain, apparently with the idea of thus  exploring the country south of the St. Lawrence, decided to accompany  a party of Algonkins and Hurons from Georgian Bay and the  neighbourhood of Montreal, who were bent on attacking the Iroquois  confederacy in the Mohawk country at the headwaters of the Hudson  River. He was accompanied by two French soldiers--Des Marais and La  Routte--and by a few Montagnais Indians from Tadoussac.    The Hurons[21] were really of the same group (as regards language and  descent) as the Iroquois (Irokwa), but in those days held aloof from  the five other tribes who had formed a confederacy[22] and alliance  under the name of _Ongwehonwe_--\"Superior Men\". The Iroquois  (Mohawks, Oneidas, Onondagas, Kayugas, and Senekas) dominated much of  what is now New York State, and from the mountain country of the  Adirondaks and Catskills descended on the St. Lawrence valley and the  shores of Lakes Ontario and Huron to rob and massacre.    [Footnote 21: Huron was a French name given to the westernmost group  of the Iroquois family (see p. 159). The Huron group included the  Waiandots, the Eries or Erigas, the Arendaronons, and the Atiwandoronk  or \"neutral\" nation. The French sometimes called all these Huron  tribes \"the good Iroquois\". Iroquois was probably pronounced \"Irokwa\",  and seems to have been derived from a word like Irokosia, the name of  the Adirondack mountain country.]    [Footnote 22: The confederacy was founded about 1450 by the great  Hiawatha (of Longfellow's Poem), himself an Onondaga from south of  Lake Ontario, but backed by the Mohawks only, in the beginning of his  work.]      The route into the enemy's country lay along the Richelieu River and  across Lake Champlain to its southern end, in sight of the majestic  snow-crowned Adirondak Mountains. On the way the allies stopped at an  island, held a kind of review, and explained their tactics to  Champlain. They set no sentries and kept no strict watch at night,  being too tired; but during the daytime the army advanced as follows:  The main body marched in the centre along the warpath; a portion of  the troops diverged on either side to hunt up food for the expedition;  and a third section was told off for \"intelligence\" work, namely, they  ran on ahead and roundabout to locate the enemy, looking out  especially along the rivers for marks or signals showing whether  friends or enemies had passed that way. These marks were devised by  the chiefs of the different tribes, and were duly communicated to the  war leaders of tribes in friendship or alliance, like our cipher  codes; and equally they were changed from time to time to baffle the  enemy. Neither hunters nor main body ever got in front of the advance  guard, lest they should give an alarm. Thus they travelled until they  got within two days or so of the enemies' headquarters; thenceforward  they only marched by night, and hid in the woods by day, making no  fires or noise, and subsisting only on cooked maize meal.    At intervals the soothsayers accompanying the army were consulted for  signs and omens; and when the war-chiefs decided on their plan of  campaign they summoned all the fighting men to a smooth place in a  wood, cut sticks a foot long (as many as there were warriors), and  each leader of a division \"put the sticks in such order as seemed to  him best, indicating to his followers the rank and order they were to  observe in battle. The warriors watched carefully this proceeding,  observing attentively the outline which their chief had made with the  sticks. Then they would go away and set to placing themselves in such  order as the sticks were in. This manoeuvre they repeated several  times, and at all their encampments, without needing a sergeant to  maintain them in the proper order they were able to keep accurately  the positions assigned to them\" (Champlain).    The Hurons who were accompanying Champlain frequently questioned him  as to his dreams, they themselves having a great belief in the value  of dreams as omens and indications of future events. One day, when  they were approaching the country of the Iroquois, Champlain actually  did have a dream. In this he imagined that he saw the Iroquois enemies  drowning in a lake near a mountain. Moved to pity in his dream he  wished to help them, but his savage allies insisted that they must be  allowed to die. When he awoke he told the Amerindians of his dream,  and they were greatly impressed, as they regarded it as a good omen.    Near the modern town of Ticonderoga the Hurons and Algonkins of  Georgian Bay and Ottawa met a party of Iroquois, probably of the  Mohawk tribe. The Iroquois had built rapidly a stockade in which to  retreat if things should go badly with them, but the battle at first  began in the old heroic style with as much ceremony as a French duel.  First the allies from the St. Lawrence asked the Iroquois what time it  would suit them to begin fighting the next day; then the latter  replied: \"When the sun is well up, if you don't mind? We can see  better then to kill you all.\" Accordingly in the bright morning the  Hurons and Algonkins advanced against the circular stockade of the  Iroquois, and the Iroquois marched out to fight in great pomp, their  leaders wearing plumed headdresses. With this exception both parties  fought quite naked, and armed only with bows and arrows.    \"I marched twenty paces in advance of the rest\" (wrote Champlain)  \"till I was within about thirty paces of the Iroquois.... I rested my  musket against my cheek, and aimed directly at one of the three  chiefs. With the same shot two fell to the ground, and one of their  men was so wounded that he died some time afterwards. I had loaded my  musket with four balls. When they saw I had shot so favourably for  them, they (the Algonkins and Hurons) raised such loud cries that one  could not have heard it thunder.    \"Meantime the arrows flew on both sides. The Iroquois were greatly  astonished that two men had been so quickly killed, though they were  equipped with armour woven from copper thread and with wood, which was  proof against their arrows.\"    Whilst Champlain was loading to fire again one of his two companions  fired a shot from the woods, whereupon the Iroquois took to flight,  abandoning their camp and fort. As they fled they threw off their  armour of wooden boards and cotton cloth.    As to the way in which the Hurons tortured their Iroquois prisoners,  Champlain writes of one instance.    \"They commanded him (the prisoner) to sing, if he had courage, which  he did, but it was a very sad song.\" The Hurons kindled a fire, and  when it was well alight they each took a brand from the blaze, the end  of which was red-hot, and with this burnt the bodies of their  prisoners tied to stakes. Every now and then they stopped and threw  water over them to restore them from fainting. Then they tore out  their finger nails and applied fire to the extremities of the fingers.  After that they tore the scalps off their heads, and poured over the  raw and bleeding flesh a kind of hot gum. Then they pierced the arms  of the prisoners near the wrists, and drew up their sinews with sticks  inserted underneath, trying to tear them out by force, and, if  failing, cutting them. One poor wretch \"uttered such terrible cries  that it excited my pity to see him treated in this manner, yet at  other times he showed such firmness that one would have said he  suffered scarcely any pain at all\".    In this case Champlain, seeing that the man could not recover from his  injuries, drew apart and shot him dead, \"thus putting an end to all  the tortures he would have suffered\".    But the savage Hurons were not yet satisfied. They opened the corpse  and threw its entrails into the lake. Then they cut off head,"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/13015"],[0,"Tales of Old Japan (#13)"],[1,"and entreated  kindly without asking any questions as to their antecedents; how much  the more then, on being applied to for an asylum by the son of his own  foster-mother, did he willingly extend his patronage to him, and  guarantee him against all danger. So he called a meeting of the  principal Hatamotos, and introduced Matagoro to them, saying--\"This  man is a retainer of Ikeda Kunaishoyu, who, having cause of hatred  against a man named Watanabe Yukiye, has slain him, and has fled to me  for protection; this man's mother suckled me when I was an infant,  and, right or wrong, I will befriend him. If, therefore, Ikeda  Kunaishoyu should send to require me to deliver him up, I trust that  you will one and all put forth your strength and help me to defend  him.\"    \"Ay! that will we, with pleasure!\" replied Kondo Noborinosuke. \"We  have for some time had cause to complain of the scorn with which the  Daimios have treated us. Let Ikeda Kunaishoyu send to claim this man,  and we will show him the power of the Hatamotos.\"    All the other Hatamotos, with one accord, applauded this  determination, and made ready their force for an armed resistance,  should my Lord Kunaishoyu send to demand the surrender of Matugoro.  But the latter remained as a welcome guest in the house of Abe  Shirogoro.    [Illustration: MATAGORO KILLS YUKIYE.]    Now when Watanabe Kazuma saw that, as the night advanced, his father  Yukiye did not return home, he became anxious, and went to the house  of Matagoro to seek for him, and finding to his horror that he was  murdered, fell upon the corpse and, embraced it, weeping. On a sudden,  it flashed across him that this must assuredly be the handiwork of  Matagoro; so he rushed furiously into the house, determined to kill  his father's murderer upon the spot. But Matagoro had already fled,  and he found only the mother, who was making her preparations for  following her son to the house of Abe Shirogoro: so he bound the old  woman, and searched all over the house for her son; but, seeing that  his search was fruitless, he carried off the mother, and handed her  over to one of the elders of the clan, at the same time laying  information against Matagoro as his father's murderer. When the affair  was reported to the Prince, he was very angry, and ordered that the  old woman should remain bound and be cast into prison until the  whereabouts of her son should be discovered. Then Kazuma buried his  father's corpse with great pomp, and the widow and the orphan mourned  over their loss.    It soon became known amongst the people of Abe Shirogoro that the  mother of Matagoro had been imprisoned for her son's crime, and they  immediately set about planning her rescue; so they sent to the palace  of my Lord Kunaishoyu a messenger, who, when he was introduced to the  councillor of the Prince, said--    \"We have heard that, in consequence of the murder of Yukiye, my lord  has been pleased to imprison the mother of Matagoro. Our master  Shirogoro has arrested the criminal, and will deliver him up to you.  But the mother has committed no crime, so we pray that she may be  released from a cruel imprisonment: she was the foster-mother of our  master, and he would fain intercede to save her life. Should you  consent to this, we, on our side, will give up the murderer, and hand  him over to you in front of our master's gate to-morrow.\"    The councillor repeated this message to the Prince, who, in his  pleasure at being able to give Kazuma his revenge on the morrow,  immediately agreed to the proposal, and the messenger returned  triumphant at the success of the scheme. On the following day, the  Prince ordered the mother of Matagoro to be placed in a litter and  carried to the Hatamoto's dwelling, in charge of a retainer named  Sasawo Danyemon, who, when he arrived at the door of Abe Shirogoro's  house, said--    \"I am charged to hand over to you the mother of Matagoro, and, in  exchange, I am authorized to receive her son at your hands.\"    \"We will immediately give him up to you; but, as the mother and son  are now about to bid an eternal farewell to one another, we beg you to  be so kind as to tarry a little.\"    With this the retainers of Shirogoro led the old woman inside their  master's house, and Sasawo Danyemon remained waiting outside, until at  last he grew impatient, and ventured to hurry on the people within.    \"We return you many thanks,\" replied they, \"for your kindness in  bringing us the mother; but, as the son cannot go with you at present,  you had better return home as quickly as possible. We are afraid we  have put you to much trouble.\" And so they mocked him.    When Danyemon saw that he had not only been cheated into giving up the  old woman, but was being made a laughing-stock of into the bargain, he  flew into a great rage, and thought to break into the house and seize  Matagoro and his mother by force; but, peeping into the courtyard, he  saw that it was filled with Hatamotos, carrying guns and naked swords.  Not caring then to die fighting a hopeless battle, and at the same  time feeling that, after having been so cheated, he would be put to  shame before his lord, Sasawo Danyemon went to the burial-place of his  ancestors, and disembowelled himself in front of their graves.    [Illustration: THE DEATH OF DANYEMON.]    When the Prince heard how his messenger had been treated, he was  indignant, and summoning his councillors resolved, although he was  suffering from sickness, to collect his retainers and attack Abe  Shirogoro; and the other chief Daimios, when the matter became  publicly known, took up the cause, and determined that the Hatamotos  must be chastised for their insolence. On their side, the Hatamotos  put forth all their efforts to resist the Daimios. So Yedo became  disturbed, and the riotous state of the city caused great anxiety to  the Government, who took counsel together how they might restore  peace. As the Hatamotos were directly under the orders of the Shogun,  it was no difficult matter to put them down: the hard question to  solve was how to put a restraint upon the great Daimios. However, one  of the Gorojin,[17] named Matsudaira Idzu no Kami, a man of great  intelligence, hit upon a plan by which he might secure this end.    [Footnote 17: The first Council of the Shogun's ministers; literally,  \"assembly of imperial elders.\"]    There was at this time in the service of the Shogun a physician, named  Nakarai Tsusen, who was in the habit of frequenting the palace of my  Lord Kunaishoyu, and who for some time past had been treating him for  the disease from which he was suffering. Idzu no Kami sent secretly  for this physician, and, summoning him to his private room, engaged  him in conversation, in the midst of which he suddenly dropped his  voice and said to him in a whisper--    \"Listen, Tsusen. You have received great favours at the hands of the  Shogun. The Government is now sorely straitened: are you willing to  carry your loyalty so far as to lay down your life on its behalf?\"    \"Ay, my lord; for generations my forefathers have held their property  by the grace of the Shogun. I am willing this night to lay down my  life for my Prince, as a faithful vassal should.\"    \"Well, then, I will tell you. The great Daimios and the Hatamotos  have fallen out about this affair of Matagoro, and lately it has  seemed as if they meant to come to blows. The country will be  agitated, and the farmers and townsfolk suffer great misery, if we  cannot quell the tumult. The Hatamotos will be easily kept under, but  it will be no light task to pacify the great Daimios. If you are  willing to lay down your life in carrying out a stratagem of mine,  peace will be restored to the country; but your loyalty will be your  death.\"    \"I am ready to sacrifice my life in this service.\"    \"This is my plan. You have been attending my Lord Kunaishoyu in his  sickness; to-morrow you must go to see him, and put poison in his  physic. If we can kill him, the agitation will cease. This is the  service which I ask of you.\"    Tsusen agreed to undertake the deed; and on the following day, when he  went to see Kunaishoyu, he carried with him poisoned drugs. Half the  draught he drank himself,[18] and thus put the Prince off his guard,  so that he swallowed the remainder fearlessly. Tsusen, seeing this,  hurried away, and as he was carried home in his litter the death-agony  seized him, and he died, vomiting blood.    [Footnote 18: A physician attending a personage of exalted rank has  always to drink half the potion he prescribes as a test of his good  faith.]    My Lord Kunaishoyu died in the same way in great torture, and in the  confusion attending upon his death and funeral ceremonies the struggle  which was impending with the Hatamotos was delayed.    In the meanwhile the Gorojiu Idzu no Kami summoned the three leaders  of the Hatamotos and addressed them as follows--    \"The secret plottings and treasonable, turbulent conduct of you three  men, so unbecoming your position as Hatamotos, have enraged my lord  the Shogun to such a degree, that he has been pleased to order that  you be imprisoned in a temple, and that your patrimony be given over  to your next heirs.\"    Accordingly the three Hatamotos, after having been severely  admonished, were confined in a temple called Kanyeiji; and the  remaining Hatamotos, scared by this example, dispersed in peace. As  for the great Daimios, inasmuch as after the death of my Lord  Kunaishoyu the Hatamotos were all dispersed, there was no enemy left  for them to fight with; so the tumult was quelled, and peace was  restored.    Thus it happened that Matagoro lost his patron; so, taking his mother  with him, he went and placed himself under the protection of an old  man named Sakurai Jiuzayemon. This old man was a famous teacher of  lance exercise, and enjoyed both wealth and honour; so he took in  Matagoro, and having engaged as a guard"]]]
