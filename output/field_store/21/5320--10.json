Or perhaps we recall him  best for burying his wine and Parmazan cheese in his garden at the time  of the Fire, or for standing to the measure of Mr. Pin the tailor for a  \"camlett cloak with gold buttons,\" or for sitting for his portrait in an  Indian gown which he \"hired to be drawn in.\" Who shall say that this is not  the very portrait by which we have fancied him stalking off to Commons?  Could the apprentices have known in what a borrowed majesty he walked,  would they not have tossed their caps in mirth and pointed their dusky  fingers at him?    Or we remember that he once lived in a garret, and that his wife, \"poor  wretch,\" was used to make the fire while Samuel lay abed, and that she  washed his \"foul clothes\"--that by degrees he came to be wealthy and  rode in his own yellow coach--that his wife went abroad in society \"in  a flowered tabby gown\"--that Pepys forsook his habits of poverty and  exchanged his twelve-penny seat in the theatre gallery for a place in the  pit--and that on a rare occasion (doubtless when he was alone and there was  but one seat to buy) he arose to the extravagance of a four-shilling box.    Consequently, despite the weightier parts of the diary, we know Pepys  chiefly in his hours of ease. Sittings and consultations are so dry. If  only the world would run itself decently and in silence! Even a meeting of  the Committee for Tangier--when the Prince of Wales was present and such  smaller fry as Chancellors--is dull and is matter for a skipping eye.    If a session of Parliament bulks to a fat paragraph and it happens that  there is a bit of deviltry just below at the bottom of the page--maybe no  more than a clinking of glasses (or perhaps Nell Gwynne's name pops in  sight)--bless us how the eye will hurry to turn the leaf on the chance  of roguery to come! Who would read through a long discourse on Admiralty  business, if it be known before that Pepys is engaged with the pretty Mrs.  Knipp for a trip to Bartholomew Fair to view the dancing horse, and that  the start is to be made on the turning of the page? Or a piece of scandal  about Lady Castlemaine, how her nose fell out of joint when Mrs. Stuart  came to court--such things tease one from the sterner business.    And for these reasons, we have been inclined to underestimate the  importance of Pepys' diary. Francis Jeffrey, who wrote long ago about  Pepys, evidently thought that he was an idle and unprofitable fellow and  that the diary was too much given to mean and petty things. But in reality  the diary is an historical mine. Even when Pepys plays upon the surface,  he throws out facts that can be had nowhere else. No one would venture to  write of Restoration life without digging through his pages. Pepys wrote in  a confused shorthand, maybe against the eye of his wife, from whom he had  reason to conceal his offenses. The papers lay undeciphered until 1825,  when a partial publication was made. There were additions by subsequent  editors until now it appears that the Wheatley text of 1893-1899 is final.  But ever since 1825, the diary has been judged to be of high importance in  the understanding of the first decade of the Restoration.    If some of the weightier parts are somewhat dry, there are places in which  a lighter show of personality is coincident with real historical data.  Foremost are the pages where Pepys goes to the theatre.    More than Charles II was restored in 1660. Among many things of more  importance than this worthless King, the theatre was restored. Since the  close of Elizabethan times it had been out of business. More than thirty  years before, Puritanism had snuffed out its candles and driven its  fiddlers to the streets. But Puritanism, in its turn, fell with the return  of the Stuarts. Pepys is a chief witness as to what kind of theatre it was  that was set up in London about the year 1660. It was far different from  the Elizabethan theatre. It came in from the Bankside and the fields to the  north of the city and lodged itself on the better streets and squares. It  no longer patterned itself on the inn-yard, but was roofed against the  rain. The time had been when the theatre was cousin to the bear-pit. They  were ranged together on the Bankside and they sweat and smelled like  congenial neighbors. But these days are past. Let Bartholomew Fair be as  rowdy as it pleases, let acrobats and such loose fellows keep to Southwark,  the theatre has risen in the world! It has put on a wig, as it were, it has  tied a ribbon to itself and has become fashionable. And although it has  taken on a few extra dissolute habits, they are of the genteelest kind and  will make it feel at home in the upper circles.    But also the theatre introduced movable scenery. There is an attempt toward  elaboration of stage effect. \"To the King's playhouse--\" says Pepys, \"a  good scene of a town on fire.\" Women take parts. An avalanche of new plays  descends on it. Even the old plays that have survived are garbled to suit a  change of taste.    But if you would really know what kind of theatre it was that sprang up  with the Stuarts and what the audiences looked like and how they behaved,  you must read Pepys. With but a moderate use of fancy, you can set out with  him in his yellow coach for the King's house in Drury Lane. Perhaps hunger  nips you at the start. If so, you stop, as Pepys pleasantly puts it, for a  \"barrel of oysters.\" Then, having dusted yourself of crumbs, you take the  road again. Presently you come to Drury Lane. Other yellow coaches are  before you. There is a show of foppery on the curb and an odor of smoking  links. A powdered beauty minces to the door. Once past the doorkeeper, you  hear the cries of the orange women going up and down the aisles. There is a  shuffling of apprentices in the gallery. A dandy who lolls in a box with a  silken leg across the rail, scrawls a message to an actress and sends it  off by Orange Moll. Presently Castlemaine enters the royal box with the  King. There is a craning of necks, for with her the King openly \"do  discover a great deal of familiarity.\" In other boxes are other fine ladies  wearing vizards to hold their modesty if the comedy is free. A board breaks  in the ceiling of the gallery and dust falls in the men's hair and the  ladies' necks, which, writes Pepys, \"made good sport.\" Or again, \"A  gentleman of good habit, sitting just before us, eating of some fruit in  the midst of the play, did drop down as dead; being choked, but with much  ado Orange Moll did thrust her finger down his throat and brought him to  life again.\" Or perhaps, \"I sitting behind in a dark place, a lady spit  backward upon me by a mistake, not seeing me, but after seeing her to be a  very pretty lady, I was not troubled at it at all.\"    At a change of scenes, Mrs. Knipp spies Pepys and comes to the pit door. He  goes with her to the tiring-room. \"To the women's shift,\" he writes,  \"where Nell was dressing herself, and was all unready, and is very pretty,  prettier than I thought.... But to see how Nell cursed for having so few  people in the pit, was pretty.\"--\"But Lord! their confidence! and how  many men do hover about them as soon as they come off the stage, and how  confident they are in their talk!\" Or he is whispered a bit of gossip, how  Castlemaine is much in love with Hart, an actor of the house. Then Pepys  goes back into the pit and lays out a sixpence for an orange. As the play  nears its end, footmen crowd forward at the doors. The epilogue is spoken.  The fiddles squeak their last. There is a bawling outside for coaches.    \"Would it fit your humor,\" asks Mr. Pepys, when we have been handed to our  seats, \"would it fit your humor, if we go around to the Rose Tavern for  some burnt wine and a breast of mutton off the spit? It's sure that some  brave company will fall in, and we can have a tune. We'll not heed the  bellman. We'll sit late, for it will be a fine light moonshine morning.\"          To an Unknown Reader      Once in a while I dream that I come upon a person who is reading a book  that I have written. In my pleasant dreams these persons do not nod  sleepily upon my pages, and sometimes I fall in talk with them. Although  they do not know who I am, they praise the book and name me warmly among  my betters. In such circumstance my happy nightmare mounts until I ride  foremost with the giants. If I could think that this disturbance of my  sleep came from my diet and that these agreeable persons arose from a  lobster or a pie, nightly at supper I would ply my fork recklessly among  the platters.    But in a waking state these meetings never come. If an article of mine is  ever read at all, it is read in secret like the Bible. Once, indeed, in a  friend's house I saw my book upon the table, but I suspect that it had been  dusted and laid out for my coming. I request my hostess that next time, for  my vanity, she lay the book face down upon a chair, as though the grocer's  knock intruded. Or perhaps a huckster's cart broke upon her enjoyment.  Let it be thought that a rare bargain--tender asparagus or the first  strawberries of the summer--tempted her off my pages! Or maybe there was  red rhubarb in the cart and the jolly farmer, as he journeyed up the  street, pitched it to a pleasing melody. Dear lady, I forgive you. But let  us hope no laundryman led you off! Such discord would have marred my book.    I saw once in a public library, as I went along the shelves, a volume of  mine which gave evidence to have been really read. The record in front  showed that it had been withdrawn one time only. The card was blank  below--but once certainly it had been read. I hope that the book went out  on a Saturday noon when the spirits rise for the holiday to come, and that  a rainy Sunday followed, so that my single reader"]]]
