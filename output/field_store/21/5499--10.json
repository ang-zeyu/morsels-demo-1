[Illustration: Diagram II.    SHOWING WHERE SQUARENESSES MAY BE LOOKED FOR IN THE DRAWING ON THE  OPPOSITE PAGE]    [Illustration: Plate XVI.    STUDY BY RUBENS FROM THE COLLECTION OF CHARLES RICKETTS AND CHARLES  SHANNON    A splendid example of Rubens' love of rich, full forms. Compare with the  diagram opposite, and note the flatnesses that give strength to the  forms.]    From lack of this elementary tone study, the student, when he approaches  painting for the first time, with only his outline and light and shade  knowledge, is entirely at sea. With brushes and paint he is presented  with a problem of form expressions entirely new. And he usually begins  to flounder about, using his paint as much like chalk on paper as  possible. And timid of losing his outlines, he fears to put down a mass,  as he has no knowledge of reducing appearances to a structure of tone  masses or planes.    I would suggest, therefore, that the student should study simultaneously  from these two points of view, beginning with their most extreme  positions, that is, bare outline on the one side and on the other side  tone masses criticised for their accuracy of values only in the first  instance. As he advances, the one study will help the other. The line  work will help the accuracy with which he observes the shapes of masses,  and when he comes to light and shade his knowledge of tone values will  help him here. United at last, when complete light and shade has been  added to his outline drawings and to his mass drawing an intimate  knowledge of form, the results will approximate and the two paths will  meet. But if the qualities appertaining to either point of view are not  studied separately, the result is confusion and the \"muddling through\"  method so common in our schools of art.          VIII    LINE DRAWING: PRACTICAL      Seeing that the first condition of your drawing is that it has to be  made on a flat surface, no matter whether it is to be in line or mass  you intend to draw, it is obvious that appearances must be reduced to  terms of a flat surface before they can be expressed on paper. And this  is the first difficulty that confronts the student in attempting to draw  a solid object. He has so acquired the habit of perceiving the solidity  of things, as was explained in an earlier chapter, that no little  difficulty will be experienced in accurately seeing them as a flat  picture.    [Sidenote: Observing Solids as a Flat copy.]    As it is only from one point of view that things can be drawn, and as we  have two eyes, therefore two points of view, the closing of one eye will  be helpful at first.    The simplest and most mechanical way of observing things as a flat  subject is to have a piece of cardboard with a rectangular hole cut out  of the middle, and also pieces of cotton threaded through it in such a  manner that they make a pattern of squares across the opening, as in the  accompanying sketch. To make such a frame, get a piece of stiff  cardboard, about 12 inches by 9 inches, and cut a rectangular hole in  the centre, 7 inches by 5 inches, as in Diagram III. Now mark off the  inches on all sides of the opening, and taking some black thread, pass  it through the point A with a needle (fixing the end at this point with  sealing-wax), and across the opening to the corresponding point on the  opposite side. Take it along to the next point, as shown by the dotted  line, and pass it through and across the opening again, and so on, until  B is reached, when the thread should be held by some sealing-wax quite  taut everywhere. Do the same for the other side. This frame should be  held between the eye and the object to be drawn (one eye being closed)  in a perfectly vertical position, and with the rectangular sides of the  opening vertical and horizontal. The object can then be observed as a  flat copy. The trellis of cotton will greatly help the student in seeing  the subject to be drawn in two dimensions, and this is the first  technical difficulty the young draughtsman has to overcome. It is useful  also in training the eye to see the proportions of different parts one  to another, the squares of equal size giving one a unit of measurement  by which all parts can be scaled.    [Illustration: Diagram III.    A DEVICE FOR ENABLING STUDENTS TO OBSERVE APPEARANCES AS A FLAT SUBJECT]    [Sidenote: Fixing Positions of Salient Points]    Vertical and horizontal lines are also of the utmost importance in that  first consideration for setting out a drawing, namely the fixing of  salient points, and getting their relative Positions. Fig. Z, on page  87 [Transcribers Note: Diagram IV], will illustrate what is meant. Let  A B C D E be assumed to be points of some importance in an object you  wish to draw. Unaided, the placing of these points would be a matter of  considerable difficulty. But if you assume a vertical line drawn from A,  the positions of B, C, D, and E can be observed in relation to it by  noting the height and length of horizontal lines drawn from them to this  vertical line. This vertical can be drawn by holding a plumb line at  arm's length (closing one eye, of course) and bringing it to a position  where it will cover the point A on your subject. The position of the  other points on either side of this vertical line can then be observed.  Or a knitting-needle can be held vertically before you at arm's length,  giving you a line passing through point A. The advantage of the needle  is that comparative measurements can be taken with it.    [Illustration: Diagram IV.    SHOWING THREE PRINCIPLES OF CONSTRUCTION USED IN OBSERVING FIG. X,  MASSES; FIG. Y, CURVES; FIG. Z, POSITION OF POINTS]    In measuring comparative distances the needle should always be held at  arm's length and the eye kept in one position during the operation; and,  whether held vertically or horizontally, always kept in a vertical  plane, that is, either straight up and down, or across at right angles  to the line of your vision. If these things are not carefully observed,  your comparisons will not be true. The method employed is to run the  thumb-nail up the needle until the distance from the point so reached to  the top exactly corresponds with the distance on the object you wish to  measure. Having this carefully noted on your needle, without moving the  position of your eye, you can move your outstretched arm and compare it  with other distances on the object. #It is never advisable to compare  other than vertical and horizontal measurements.# In our diagram the  points were drawn at random and do not come in any obvious mathematical  relationship, and this is the usual circumstance in nature. But point C  will be found to be a little above the half, and point D a little less  than a third of the way up the vertical line. How much above the half  and less than the third will have to be observed by eye and a  corresponding amount allowed in setting out your drawing. In the  horizontal distances, B will be found to be one-fourth the distance from  X to the height of C on the right of our vertical line, and C a little  more than this distance to the left, while the distance on the right of  D is a little less than one-fifth of the whole height. The height of B  is so near the top as to be best judged by eye, and its distance to the  right is the same as B. These measurements are never to be taken as  absolutely accurate, but are a great help to beginners in training  the eye, and are at times useful in every artist's work.    [Illustration: Plate XVII.    DEMONSTRATION DRAWING MADE BEFORE THE STUDENTS OF THE GOLDSMITHS COLLEGE  SCHOOL OF ART    Illustrating how different directions of lines can help expression of  form.]    It is useful if one can establish a unit of measurement, some  conspicuous distance that does not vary in the object (if a living model  a great many distances will be constantly varying), and with which all  distances can be compared.    In setting out a drawing, this fixing of certain salient points is the  first thing for the student to do. The drawing reproduced on page 90  [Transcribers Note: Plate XVIII] has been made to illustrate the method  of procedure it is advisable to adopt in training the eye to accurate  observation. It was felt that a vertical line drawn through the pit of  the arm would be the most useful for taking measurements on, and this  was first drawn and its length decided upon. Train yourself to draw  between limits decided upon at the start. This power will be of great  use to you when you wish to place a figure in an exact position in a  picture. The next thing to do is to get the relative heights of  different points marked upon this line. The fold at the pit of the  stomach was found to be exactly in the centre. This was a useful start,  and it is generally advisable to note where the half comes first, and  very useful if it comes in some obvious place. Other measurements were  taken in the same way as our points A B C D E in the diagram on page 87  [Transcribers Note: Diagram IV], and horizontal lines drawn across, and  the transverse distances measured in relation to the heights. I have  left these lines on the drawing, and also different parts of it  unfinished, so as to show the different stages of the work. These guide  lines are done mentally later on, when the student is more advanced, and  with more accuracy than the clumsy knitting-needle. But before the  habit of having constantly in mind a vertical and horizontal line with  which to compare positions is acquired, they should be put in with as  much accuracy as measuring can give.

They had discussed it quite calmly. It was even down on  Josephine's list of things to be done. \"Go through father's things and  settle about them.\" But that was a very different matter from saying  after breakfast:    \"Well, are you ready, Con?\"    \"Yes, Jug--when you are.\"    \"Then I think we'd better get it over.\"    It was dark in the hall. It had been a rule for years never to disturb  father in the morning, whatever happened. And now they were going to  open the door without knocking even... Constantia's eyes were enormous at  the idea; Josephine felt weak in the knees.    \"You--you go first,\" she gasped, pushing Constantia.    But Constantia said, as she always had said on those occasions, \"No,  Jug, that's not fair. You're the eldest.\"    Josephine was just going to say--what at other times she wouldn't have  owned to for the world--what she kept for her very last weapon, \"But  you're the tallest,\" when they noticed that the kitchen door was open,  and there stood Kate...    \"Very stiff,\" said Josephine, grasping the doorhandle and doing her best  to turn it. As if anything ever deceived Kate!    It couldn't be helped. That girl was... Then the door was shut behind  them, but--but they weren't in father's room at all. They might have  suddenly walked through the wall by mistake into a different flat  altogether. Was the door just behind them? They were too frightened to  look. Josephine knew that if it was it was holding itself tight shut;  Constantia felt that, like the doors in dreams, it hadn't any handle  at all. It was the coldness which made it so awful. Or the  whiteness--which? Everything was covered. The blinds were down, a cloth  hung over the mirror, a sheet hid the bed; a huge fan of white paper  filled the fireplace. Constantia timidly put out her hand; she almost  expected a snowflake to fall. Josephine felt a queer tingling in her  nose, as if her nose was freezing. Then a cab klop-klopped over the  cobbles below, and the quiet seemed to shake into little pieces.    \"I had better pull up a blind,\" said Josephine bravely.    \"Yes, it might be a good idea,\" whispered Constantia.    They only gave the blind a touch, but it flew up and the cord flew  after, rolling round the blind-stick, and the little tassel tapped as if  trying to get free. That was too much for Constantia.    \"Don't you think--don't you think we might put it off for another day?\"  she whispered.    \"Why?\" snapped Josephine, feeling, as usual, much better now that she  knew for certain that Constantia was terrified. \"It's got to be done.  But I do wish you wouldn't whisper, Con.\"    \"I didn't know I was whispering,\" whispered Constantia.    \"And why do you keep staring at the bed?\" said Josephine, raising her  voice almost defiantly. \"There's nothing on the bed.\"    \"Oh, Jug, don't say so!\" said poor Connie. \"At any rate, not so loudly.\"    Josephine felt herself that she had gone too far. She took a wide swerve  over to the chest of drawers, put out her hand, but quickly drew it back  again.    \"Connie!\" she gasped, and she wheeled round and leaned with her back  against the chest of drawers.    \"Oh, Jug--what?\"    Josephine could only glare. She had the most extraordinary feeling that  she had just escaped something simply awful. But how could she explain  to Constantia that father was in the chest of drawers? He was in the  top drawer with his handkerchiefs and neckties, or in the next with  his shirts and pyjamas, or in the lowest of all with his suits. He  was watching there, hidden away--just behind the door-handle--ready to  spring.    She pulled a funny old-fashioned face at Constantia, just as she used to  in the old days when she was going to cry.    \"I can't open,\" she nearly wailed.    \"No, don't, Jug,\" whispered Constantia earnestly. \"It's much better not  to. Don't let's open anything. At any rate, not for a long time.\"    \"But--but it seems so weak,\" said Josephine, breaking down.    \"But why not be weak for once, Jug?\" argued Constantia, whispering  quite fiercely. \"If it is weak.\" And her pale stare flew from the locked  writing-table--so safe--to the huge glittering wardrobe, and she began  to breathe in a queer, panting away. \"Why shouldn't we be weak for once  in our lives, Jug? It's quite excusable. Let's be weak--be weak, Jug.  It's much nicer to be weak than to be strong.\"    And then she did one of those amazingly bold things that she'd done  about twice before in their lives: she marched over to the wardrobe,  turned the key, and took it out of the lock. Took it out of the lock and  held it up to Josephine, showing Josephine by her extraordinary smile  that she knew what she'd done--she'd risked deliberately father being in  there among his overcoats.    If the huge wardrobe had lurched forward, had crashed down on  Constantia, Josephine wouldn't have been surprised. On the contrary,  she would have thought it the only suitable thing to happen. But nothing  happened. Only the room seemed quieter than ever, and the bigger flakes  of cold air fell on Josephine's shoulders and knees. She began to  shiver.    \"Come, Jug,\" said Constantia, still with that awful callous smile, and  Josephine followed just as she had that last time, when Constantia had  pushed Benny into the round pond.      Chapter 3.VII.    But the strain told on them when they were back in the dining-room. They  sat down, very shaky, and looked at each other.    \"I don't feel I can settle to anything,\" said Josephine, \"until I've had  something. Do you think we could ask Kate for two cups of hot water?\"    \"I really don't see why we shouldn't,\" said Constantia carefully. She  was quite normal again. \"I won't ring. I'll go to the kitchen door and  ask her.\"    \"Yes, do,\" said Josephine, sinking down into a chair. \"Tell her, just  two cups, Con, nothing else--on a tray.\"    \"She needn't even put the jug on, need she?\" said Constantia, as though  Kate might very well complain if the jug had been there.    \"Oh no, certainly not! The jug's not at all necessary. She can pour  it direct out of the kettle,\" cried Josephine, feeling that would be a  labour-saving indeed.    Their cold lips quivered at the greenish brims. Josephine curved her  small red hands round the cup; Constantia sat up and blew on the wavy  steam, making it flutter from one side to the other.    \"Speaking of Benny,\" said Josephine.    And though Benny hadn't been mentioned Constantia immediately looked as  though he had.    \"He'll expect us to send him something of father's, of course. But it's  so difficult to know what to send to Ceylon.\"    \"You mean things get unstuck so on the voyage,\" murmured Constantia.    \"No, lost,\" said Josephine sharply. \"You know there's no post. Only  runners.\"    Both paused to watch a black man in white linen drawers running through  the pale fields for dear life, with a large brown-paper parcel in his  hands. Josephine's black man was tiny; he scurried along glistening like  an ant. But there was something blind and tireless about Constantia's  tall, thin fellow, which made him, she decided, a very unpleasant person  indeed... On the veranda, dressed all in white and wearing a cork helmet,  stood Benny. His right hand shook up and down, as father's did when he  was impatient. And behind him, not in the least interested, sat Hilda,  the unknown sister-in-law. She swung in a cane rocker and flicked over  the leaves of the \"Tatler.\"    \"I think his watch would be the most suitable present,\" said Josephine.    Constantia looked up; she seemed surprised.    \"Oh, would you trust a gold watch to a native?\"    \"But of course, I'd disguise it,\" said Josephine. \"No one would know  it was a watch.\" She liked the idea of having to make a parcel such a  curious shape that no one could possibly guess what it was. She  even thought for a moment of hiding the watch in a narrow cardboard  corset-box that she'd kept by her for a long time, waiting for it to  come in for something. It was such beautiful, firm cardboard. But, no,  it wouldn't be appropriate for this occasion. It had lettering on it:  \"Medium Women's 28. Extra Firm Busks.\" It would be almost too much of a  surprise for Benny to open that and find father's watch inside.    \"And of course it isn't as though it would be going--ticking, I mean,\"  said Constantia, who was still thinking of the native love of jewellery.  \"At least,\" she added, \"it would be very strange if after all that time  it was.\"      Chapter 3.VIII.    Josephine made no reply. She had flown off on one of her tangents.  She had suddenly thought of Cyril. Wasn't it more usual for the only  grandson to have the watch? And then dear Cyril was so appreciative, and  a gold watch meant so much to a young man. Benny, in all probability,  had quite got out of the habit of watches; men so seldom wore waistcoats  in those hot climates. Whereas Cyril in London wore them from year's end  to year's end. And it would be so nice for her and Constantia, when he  came to tea, to know it was there. \"I see you've got on grandfather's  watch, Cyril.\" It would be somehow so satisfactory.    Dear boy! What a blow his sweet, sympathetic little note had been! Of  course they quite understood; but it was most unfortunate.    \"It would have been such a point, having him,\" said Josephine.    \"And he would have enjoyed it so,\" said Constantia, not thinking what  she was saying.    However, as soon as he got back he was coming to tea with his aunties.  Cyril to tea was one of their rare treats.    \"Now, Cyril, you mustn't be frightened of our cakes. Your Auntie Con and  I bought them at Buszard's this morning. We know what a man's appetite  is. So don't be ashamed of making a good tea.\"    Josephine cut recklessly into the rich dark cake that stood for her  winter gloves or the soling and heeling of Constantia's only respectable  shoes. But Cyril was most "]]]
