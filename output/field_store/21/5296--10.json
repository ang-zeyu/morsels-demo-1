II      Long ago, in youth, he squander'd    All his goods away, and wander'd          To the Timskoop-hills afar.    There on golden sunsets glazing    Every evening found him gazing,    Singing, \"Orb! you're quite amazing!          How I wonder what you are!\"      III      Like the ancient Medes and Persians,    Always by his own exertions          He subsisted on those hills;    Whiles, by teaching children spelling,    Or at times by merely yelling,    Or at intervals by selling          \"Propter's Nicodemus Pills.\"      IV      Later, in his morning rambles,    He perceived the moving brambles          Something square and white disclose:--    'Twas a First-class Railway-Ticket;    But on stooping down to pick it    Off the ground, a pea-green cricket          Settled on my uncle's nose.      V      Never, nevermore, oh! never    Did that cricket leave him ever,--          Dawn or evening, day or night;    Clinging as a constant treasure,    Chirping with a cheerious measure,    Wholly to my uncle's pleasure,          (Though his shoes were far too tight.)      VI      So for three and forty winters,    Till his shoes were worn to splinters          All those hills he wander'd o'er,--    Sometimes silent, sometimes yelling;    Till he came to Borley-Melling,    Near his old ancestral dwelling,          (But his shoes were far too tight.)      VII      On a little heap of barley    Died my aged Uncle Arly,          And they buried him one night    Close beside the leafy thicket;    There, his hat and Railway-Ticket;    There, his ever faithful cricket;          (But his shoes were far too tight.)                              _Edward Lear_.          LINES TO A YOUNG LADY      How pleasant to know Mr. Lear!        Who has written such volumes of stuff!    Some think him ill-tempered and queer,        But a few think him pleasant enough.      His mind is concrete and fastidious,        His nose is remarkably big;    His visage is more or less hideous,        His beard it resembles a wig.      He has ears, and two eyes, and ten fingers,        Leastways if you reckon two thumbs;    Long ago he was one of the singers,        But now he is one of the dumbs.      He sits in a beautiful parlour,        With hundreds of books on the wall;    He drinks a great deal of Marsala,        But never gets tipsy at all.      He has many friends, laymen and clerical,        Old Foss is the name of his cat:    His body is perfectly spherical,        He weareth a runcible hat.      When he walks in a waterproof white,        The children run after him so!    Calling out, \"He's come out in his night-        Gown, that crazy old Englishman, oh!\"      He weeps by the side of the ocean,        He weeps on the top of the hill;    He purchases pancakes and lotion,        And chocolate shrimps from the mill.      He reads but he cannot speak Spanish,        He cannot abide ginger-beer:    Ere the days of his pilgrimage vanish,        How pleasant to know Mr. Lear.                              _Edward Lear_.          WAYS AND MEANS      I'll tell thee everything I can;        There's little to relate.    I saw an aged aged man,        A-sitting on a gate.    \"Who are you, aged man?\" I said,        \"And how is it you live?\"    His answer trickled through my head        Like water through a sieve.      He said, \"I look for butterflies        That sleep among the wheat:    I make them into mutton-pies,        And sell them in the street.    I sell them unto men,\" he said,        \"Who sail on stormy seas;    And that's the way I get my bread--        A trifle, if you please.\"      But I was thinking of a plan        To dye one's whiskers green,    And always use so large a fan        That they could not be seen.    So, having no reply to give        To what the old man said,    I cried, \"Come, tell me how you live!\"        And thumped him on the head.      His accents mild took up the tale;        He said, \"I go my ways    And when I find a mountain-rill        I set it in a blaze;    And thence they make a stuff they call        Rowland's Macassar Oil--    Yet twopence-halfpenny is all        They give me for my toil.\"      But I was thinking of a way        To feed oneself on batter,    And so go on from day to day        Getting a little fatter.    I shook him well from side to side,        Until his face was blue;    \"Come, tell me how you live,\" I cried,        \"And what it is you do!\"      He said, \"I hunt for haddock's eyes        Among the heather bright,    And work them into waistcoat-buttons        In the silent night.    And these I do not sell for gold        Or coin of silvery shine,    But for a copper halfpenny        And that will purchase nine.\"      \"I sometimes dig for buttered rolls,        Or set limed twigs for crabs;    I sometimes search the grassy knolls        For wheels of Hansom cabs.    And that's the way\" (he gave a wink)        \"By which I get my wealth--    And very gladly will I drink        Your Honor's noble health.\"      I heard him then, for I had just        Completed my design    To keep the Menai Bridge from rust        By boiling it in wine.    I thanked him much for telling me        The way he got his wealth,    But chiefly for his wish that he        Might drink my noble health.      And now if e'er by chance I put        My fingers into glue,    Or madly squeeze a right-hand foot        Into a left-hand shoe,    Or if I drop upon my toe        A very heavy weight,    I weep, for it reminds me so    Of that old man I used to know--    Whose look was mild, whose speech was slow,    Whose hair was whiter than the snow,    Whose face was very like a crow,    With eyes, like cinders, all aglow,    Who seemed distracted with his woe,    Who rocked his body to and fro,    And muttered mumblingly, and low,    As if his mouth were full of dough,    Who snorted like a buffalo--    That summer evening, long ago,        A-sitting on a gate.                              _Lewis Carroll_          THE WALRUS AND THE CARPENTER      The sun was shining on the sea,        Shining with all his might:    He did his very best to make        The billows smooth and bright--    And this was odd, because it was        The middle of the night.      The moon was shining sulkily,        Because she thought the sun    Had got no business to be there        After the day was done--    \"It's very rude of him,\" she said,        \"To come and spoil the fun!\"      The sea was wet as wet could be,        The sands were dry as dry.    You could not see a cloud, because        No cloud was in the sky:    No birds were flying overhead--        There were no birds to fly.      The Walrus and the Carpenter        Were walking close at hand;    They wept like anything to see        Such quantities of sand:    \"If this were only cleared away,\"        They said, \"it would be grand!\"      \"If seven maids with seven mops        Swept it for half a year,    Do you suppose,\" the Walrus said,        \"That they could get it clear?\"    \"I doubt it,\" said the Carpenter,        And shed a bitter tear.      \"O Oysters come and walk with us!\"        The Walrus did beseech.    \"A pleasant walk, a pleasant talk,        Along the briny beach:    We cannot do with more than four,        To give a hand to each.\"      The eldest Oyster looked at him,        But not a word he said:    The eldest Oyster winked his eye,        And shook his heavy head--    Meaning to say he did not choose        To leave the oyster-bed.      But four young Oysters hurried up,        All eager for the treat:    Their coats were brushed, their faces washed,        Their shoes were clean and neat--    And this was odd, because, you know,        They hadn't any feet.      Four other Oysters followed them,        And yet another four;    And thick and fast they came at last,        And more, and more, and more--    All hopping through the frothy waves,        And scrambling to the shore.      The Walrus and the Carpenter        Walked on a mile or so,    And then they rested on a rock        Conveniently low:    And all the little Oysters stood        And waited in a row.      \"The time has come,\" the Walrus said,        \"To talk of many things:    Of shoes--and ships--and sealing-wax--        Of cabbages--and kings--    And why the sea is boiling hot--        And whether pigs have wings.\"      \"But wait a bit,\" the Oysters cried,        \"Before we have our chat;    For some of us are out of breath,        And all of us are fat!\"    \"No hurry!\" said the Carpenter,        They thanked him much for that.      \"A loaf of bread,\" the Walrus said,        \"Is what we chiefly need:    Pepper and vinegar besides        Are very good indeed--    Now if you 're ready, Oysters dear,        We can begin to feed.\"      \"But not on us!\" the Oysters cried,        Turning a little blue.    \"After such kindness that would be        A dismal thing to do!\"    \"The night is fine,\" the Walrus said,        \"Do you admire the view?\"      \"It was so kind of you to come!        And you are very nice!\"    The Carpenter said nothing but        \"Cut us another slice:    I wish you were not quite so deaf--        I've had to ask you twice!\"      \"It seems a shame,\" the Walrus said,        \"To play them such a trick,    After we've brought them out so far,        And made them trot so quick!\"    The Carpenter said nothing but       \"The butter's spread too thick!\"      \"I weep for you,\" the Walrus said;        \"I deeply sympathize.\"    With sobs and tears he sorted out        Those of the largest size,    Holding his pocket-handkerchief        Before his streaming eyes.      \"O Oysters,\" said the Carpenter,        \"You've had a pleasant run!    Shall we be trotting home again?\"        But answer came there none--    And this was scarcely odd, because      They'd eaten every one.                              _Lewis Carroll_.          THE HUNTING OF THE SNARK      We have"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/9408"],[0,"By Water to the Columbian Exposition (#12)"],[1," which the eye of heaven shone almost  too hot--and undertook our first trip to the Fair Grounds. Seated on deck,  we inhaled the invigorating, fresh breeze sweeping over the lake and  modified by the burning rays of the sun that kissed the brilliant, blue  waters beneath, with his golden face, gilding them with heavenly alchemy.    High ran our anticipations as we were approaching the renowned White City,  to which representatives of all nations have made a pilgrimage.    At the expiration of about one-half hour, we reached the pier, destined  for the halting-place of yachts; and welcomed by the supervisor of the  harbor, we went on shore.    The first impression was bewildering. Americans have reason to be proud of  what was to be viewed in Jackson Park; as such buildings no previous  generations of men have seen, congregated in this manner; and the display  of the achievements of science, art, and industries, exhibited in them,  has undoubtedly eclipsed all other expositions in the world's annals of  progress.    It seems impossible to give so adequate a pen-picture of the World's Fair  as to impart to the reader an accurate idea of its true grandeur. Many  minds have essayed already to reproduce what they have witnessed there;  many pens have attempted to record exactly the incomparable impression the  exposition effected upon its visitors, but, it is safe to say, without  even faintly describing it; for, can language convey to a blind man what  \"color\" means, or to a deaf person the meaning of music?--No more can the  pen of the most gifted author adequately portray the World's Columbian  Exposition. If one would give to each building a volume; a shelf to the  Midway Plaisance; and to the exhibitions a whole library in way of  description, yet half of its beauties and wonders would not be told.--    Leaving the \"Marguerite\" at the North Pier, our attention was called to a  unique exhibit made by the U.S. Navy Department, a structure representing  a faithful model of a modern coast-line battle-ship. This full-sized  imitation _man-of-war_ _\"Illinois\"_ was completely equipped erected on  piling on the lake front, and surrounded by water, so as to give the  appearance of being moored to a wharf. Here the Government showed also a  war baloon, a light-house, a life-saving station complete with apparatus,  and a gun battery.    Proceeding a little westward, we viewed a building, delightfully located,  bearing a strong resemblance to the National Museum at Washington. This  imposing edifice classic in style, and adorned by a central octagonal dome  was the _United States Government Building_; to the southward of which  rose the largest of the Exposition structures, the _Manufactures and  Liberal Arts Building_, notable for its gigantic but symmetrical  proportions, covering an area of more than thirty-one acres.    Looking in a southern direction, we caught sight of the pier extending  1,000 feet into the lake, and affording a landing-place for steamers. It  was bounded on the east by the beautiful facade of the _Casino_, which  presented a decidedly Venetian aspect; its nine pavilions being in  communication both by gondolas and bridges. At the west end of the pier  stood thirteen stately columns emblematic of the Thirteen Original States  of the Union.    Rising out of the lagoon, the colossal _Statue of the Republic,_ the  largest ever built in America, predominated over this charming scene.    Beyond it extended a broad basin from which grassy terraces and broad  walks led on the southward to one of the most magnificent edifices raised  for the exposition, the _Agricultural Building_. In style of architecture  it pertained to the classic renaissance and was erected at a cost of about  $1,000,000.    From the pier westward across the park, we walked through an avenue,  several feet long; affording a view of almost unparalleled splendor.  Encompassing a beautiful sheet of water, the majestic facades of imposing  buildings attracted our eyes; above all, a superb guilded dome shimmering  in the sun-light, and pertaining to the _Administration Building,_ which  was pronounced the gem and crown of the Exposition structures. In general  design in the style of the French renaissance, it was built at an expense  of about $550,000.    Located at the extreme south of the park rose the stately _Machinery  Hall_, following classical models throughout, and being especially rich in  architectural lines and details. Its construction required a sum of  $1,000,000.    Facing the Grand Avenue, our eyes rested with delight upon two immense  edifices on either side of the Administration Building, one for the  _Electrical_ and the other for the _Mining Exhibit_.    Turning to the northward, we viewed the _Transportation Building,_  exquisitely refined and simple in architectural treatment, although very  rich and costly in detail.    On our right we beheld one of the most notable spots in Jackson Park,  (viz) _Wooded Island_, a gem of primitive nature, agreeably contrasting  with the grand productions of human skill surrounding it. Close by was the  _Palace of Horticulture,_ the largest structure ever erected for such  purpose, costing about $400,000.    Proceeding more northward, we reached the entrance to the _Midway  Plaisance_, directly east of which stood, encompassed by luxuriant shrubs  and beds of fragrant flowers, like a white silhouette against the  background of old and stately oaks, the daintily designed _Woman's  Building_.    On a well paved boulevard we entered the great \"Highway through the  Nations.\" Formerly a promenade belonging to the South Park System and  connecting Jackson Park on the east and Washington Park on the west, it  was styled by the seekers of _plaisir_ \"Midway Plaisance\" signifying  \"Pleasure-Way.\" This name has been retained by the Administration of the  World's Fair, whereas the country-lane of former times had undergone a  complete metamorphosis. We were unable to realize the radical character of  the transformation as we contemplated the enormous variety of attractions  here presented, more numerous and unlike any others ever brought together.  Therefore, it is a very difficult task to give the reader an exact idea of  the impression the Midway Plaisance effected upon its visitors, because we  generally derive our conception of a scene from the comparison it will  bear with similar spectacles.    The \"Highway through the Nations\" constituted an attractive, novel, and  instructive addition to the Exposition. For, besides enlightening  ourselves in regard to the styles of structures--inhabited by the diverse  nations on the earth,--forming a fine array of villages, castles, towers,  pavilions, pagodas, mosques, and other displays of oriental and occidental  architecture, we viewed the natives of the various countries. There were  representatives of nearly all the races and tribes, constituting the human  population on our planet which is estimated to amount to 1,500,000,000  men. We had a chance to study their features, manners, and customs; their  way of dressing, as well as their language and special occupations. Such  opportunities are only otherwise given to travelers around the globe.    The rays of the descending sun--casting rosy reflections on the beautiful  panorama and the mammoth _Ferris Wheel_, with its gigantic form  overtowering the structures of the Midway Plaisance--gave us the signal  for abandoning this charming realm.    Thus, directing our steps toward the Exposition Grounds, we arrived at the  northwestern portion of Jackson Park where we ascended the entrance to a  station of the _Columbian Intramural Railway_, the first and only electric  elevated railroad, operated by the Third Rail Trolley System.--Conveyed by  the driving power of electricity, we had a delightful ride affording a  fine view upon the northern part of the grounds. Scores of graceful  structures constituting a veritable town of palaces, embodied the best  conceptions of America's greatest architectural display.    A picturesque group of buildings erected by the States and Territories of  the American Union, rose in a semicircle around the _Fine Arts Galleries_,  a palace costing half a million. Grecian-ionic in style, this edifice  represented a pure type of the most refined classic architecture. In the  western portion of this group--facing the North Pond--stood the _Illinois  Building_, adorned by a dome in the center, and a great porch looking  southward.    Surrounded by lawns, walks, beds of flowers, and shrubs, the charming  structures of Foreign Nations were ranged on wide, curved avenues--  affording an interesting aspect.    Just south of the _Foreign_ and _State Buildings_ we observed a  considerable expanse of the lagoon, with inlet to the lake, encompassing  three islands. On the largest one stood--contrasting agreeably in  appearance with the other edifices--the _U.S. Fisheries Building_,  Spanish-Romanesque in style and flanked at each end by a curved arcade  connecting it with two polygonal pavilions.    Leaving the Intramural Train at the North Loop, we arrived at the  Government Building; thus having completed our round-trip on the Fair  Grounds and Midway Plaisance.    When we returned to our floating home, we had the satisfaction of having  obtained the best possible results of our first visit by properly  utilizing every minute.    It will be obvious to the reader that the excursion just described, was  equivalent to a trip around the world; wherefore I am entitled to the  assertion that it even surpassed Nellie Bly's remarkable feat who needed  seventy-two days, six hours, and eleven minutes for accomplishing her  circumterraneous voyage.    This success was due to the management of Mr. James, who made his  intelligence effectual, in unison with great experience, gained by having  attended the grand international expositions held in the course of several  decades in the different"]]]
