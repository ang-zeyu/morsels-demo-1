[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/10430"],[0,"Trips to the Moon (#13)"],[1,"I met with the poet Homer, and  both of us being quite at leisure, asked him several questions, and  amongst the rest where he was born, that, as I informed him, having  been long a matter of dispute amongst us.  We were very ignorant  indeed, he said, for some had made him a Chian, others a native of  Smyrna, others of Colophon, but that after all he was a Babylonian,  and amongst them was called Tigranes, though, after being a hostage  in Greece, they had changed his name to Homer.  I then asked him  about those of his verses which are rejected as spurious, and  whether they were his or not.  He said they were all his own, which  made me laugh at the nonsense of Zenodotus and Aristarchus the  grammarians.  I then asked him how he came to begin his \"Iliad\" with  the wrath of Achilles; he said it was all by chance.  I desired  likewise to know whether, as it was generally reported, he wrote the  \"Odyssey\" before the \"Iliad.\"  He said, no.  It is commonly said he  was blind, but I soon found he was not so; for he made use of his  eyes and looked at me, so that I had no reason to ask him that  question.  Whenever I found him disengaged, I took the opportunity  of conversing with him, and he very readily entered into discourse  with me, especially after the victory which he obtained over  Thersites, who had accused him of turning him into ridicule in some  of his verses.  The cause was heard before Rhadamanthus, and Homer  came off victorious.  Ulysses pleaded for him.    I met also Pythagoras the Samian, who arrived in these regions after  his soul had gone a long round in the bodies of several animals,  having been changed seven times.  All his right side was of gold,  and there was some dispute whether he should be called Pythagoras or  Euphorbus.  Empedocles came likewise, who looked sodden and roasted  all over.  He desired admittance, but though he begged hard for it,  was rejected.    A little time after the games came on, which they call here  Thanatusia. {126}  Achilles presided for the fifth time, and Theseus  for the seventh.  A narrative of the whole would be tedious; I shall  only, therefore, recount a few of the principal circumstances in the  wrestling match.  Carus, a descendant of Hercules, conquered Ulysses  at the boxing match; Areus the Egyptian, who was buried at Corinth,  and Epeus contended, but neither got the victory.  The Pancratia was  not proposed amongst them.  In the race I do not remember who had  the superiority.  In poetry Homer was far beyond them all; Hesiod,  however, got a prize.  The reward to all was a garland of peacock's  feathers.    When the games were over word was brought that the prisoners in  Tartarus had broken loose, overcome the guard, and were proceeding  to take possession of the island under the command of Phalaris the  Agrigentine, {127a} Busiris of Egypt, {127b} Diomede the Thracian,  {128a} Scyron, {128b} and Pityocamptes.  As soon as Rhadamanthus  heard of it he despatched the heroes to the shore, conducted by  Theseus, Achilles, and Ajax Telamonius, who was now returned to his  senses.  A battle ensued, wherein the heroes were victorious, owing  principally to the valour of Achilles.  Socrates, who was placed in  the right wing, behaved much better than he had done at Delius  {128c} in his life-time, for when the enemy approached he never  fled, nor so much as turned his face about.  He had a very  extraordinary present made him as the reward of his courage, no less  than a fine spacious garden near the city; here he summoned his  friends and disputed, calling the place by the name of the Academy  of the Dead.  They then bound the prisoners and sent them back to  Tartarus, to suffer double punishment.  Homer wrote an account of  this battle, and gave it me to show it to our people when I went  back, but I lost it afterwards, together with a great many other  things.  It began thus--         \"Sing, Muse, the battles of the heroes dead--\"    The campaign thus happily finished, they made an entertainment to  celebrate the victory, which, as is usual amongst them, was a bean-  feast.  Pythagoras alone absented himself on that day, and fasted,  holding in abomination the wicked custom of eating beans.    Six months had now elapsed, when a new and extraordinary affair  happened.  Cinyrus, the son of Scintharus, a tall, well-made,  handsome youth, fell in love with Helen, and she no less desperately  with him.  They were often nodding and drinking to one another at  the public feasts, and would frequently rise up and walk out  together alone into the wood.  The violence of his passion, joined  to the impossibility of possessing her any other way, put Cinyrus on  the resolution of running away with her.  She imagined that they  might easily get off to some of the adjacent islands, either to  Phellus or Tyroessa.  He selected three of the bravest of our crew  to accompany them; never mentioning the design to his father, who he  knew would never consent to it, but the first favourable  opportunity, put it in execution; and one night when I was not with  them (for it happened that I stayed late at the feast, and slept  there) carried her off.    Menelaus, rising in the middle of the night, and perceiving that his  wife was gone, made a dreadful noise about it, and, taking his  brother along with him, proceeded immediately to the king's palace.  At break of day the guards informed him that they had seen a vessel  a good distance from land.  He immediately put fifty heroes on board  a ship made out of one large piece of the asphodelus, with orders to  pursue them.  They made all the sail they possibly could, and about  noon came up with and seized on them, just as they were entering  into the Milky Sea, close to Tyroessa; so near were they to making  their escape.  The pursuers threw a rosy chain over the vessel and  brought her home again.  Helen began to weep, blushed, and hid her  face.  Rhadamanthus asked Cinyrus and the rest of them if they had  any more accomplices:  they told him they had none.  He then ordered  them to be chained, whipped with mallows, and sent to Tartarus.    It was now determined that we should stay no longer on the island  than the time limited, and the very next day was fixed for our  departure.  This gave me no little concern, and I wept to think I  must leave so many good things, and be once more a wanderer.  They  endeavoured to administer consolation to me by assuring me that in a  few years I should return to them again; they even pointed out the  seat that should be allotted to me, and which was near the best and  worthiest inhabitants of these delightful mansions.  I addressed  myself to Rhadamanthus, and humbly entreated him to inform me of my  future fate, and let me know beforehand whether I should travel.  He  told me that, after many toils and dangers, I should at last return  in safety to my native country, but would not point out the time  when.  He then showed me the neighbouring islands, five of which  appeared near to me, and a sixth at a distance.  \"Those next to  you,\" said he, \"where you see a great fire burning, are the  habitations of the wicked; the sixth is the city of dreams; behind  that lies the island of Calypso, which you cannot see yet.  When you  get beyond these you will come to a large tract of land inhabited by  those who live on the side of the earth directly opposite to you,  {132} there you will suffer many things, wander through several  nations, and meet with some very savage and unsociable people, and  at length get into another region.\"    Having said thus, he took a root of mallow out of the earth, and  putting it into my hand, bade me remember, when I was in any danger,  to call upon that; and added, moreover, that if, when I came to the  Antipodes, I took care \"never to stir the fire with a sword, and  never to eat lupines,\" I might have hopes of returning to the Island  of the Blessed.    I then got everything ready for the voyage, supped with, and took my  leave of them.  Next day, meeting Homer, I begged him to make me a  couple of verses for an inscription, which he did, and I fixed them  on a little column of beryl, at the mouth of the harbour; the  inscription was as follows:         \"Dear to the gods, and favourite of heaven,        Here Lucian lived:  to him alone 'twas given,        Well pleased these happy regions to explore,        And back returning, seek his native shore.\"    I stayed that day, and the next set sail; the heroes attending to  take their leave of us; when Ulysses, unknown to Penelope, slipped a  letter into my hand for Calypso, at the island of Ogygia.  Rhadamanthus was so obliging as to send with us Nauplius the pilot,  that, if we stopped at the neighbouring islands, and they should lay  hold on us, he might acquaint them that we were only on our passage  to another place.    As soon as we got out of the sweet-scented air, we came into another  that smelt of asphaltus, pitch, and sulphur burning together, with a  most intolerable stench, as of burned carcases:  the whole element  above us was dark and dismal, distilling a kind of pitchy dew upon  our heads; we heard the sound of stripes, and the yellings of men in  torment.    We saw but one of these islands; that which we landed on I will give  you some description of.  Every part of it was steep and filthy,  abounding in rocks and rough mountains.  We crept along, over  precipices full of thorns and briers, and, passing through a most  horrid country, came to the dungeon, and place of punishment, which  we beheld with an admiration full of horror:  the ground was strewed  with swords and prongs, and close to us were three rivers, one of  mire, another of blood, and another of fire, immense and impassable,  that flowed in torrents, and rolled like waves in the sea; it had  many fish in it, some like torches, others resembling live coals;  which they called lychnisci.  There is but one entrance into the"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/10444"],[0,"The Peace Negotiations: A Personal Narrative (#13)"],[1," so that  there will be no separation in peace of the four powers which have  battled side by side.\"    M. Clemenceau's words caused a decided sensation among the delegates  already in Paris and excited much comment in the press. The public  interest was intensified by the fact that President Wilson had but a day  or two before, in an address at Manchester, England, denounced the  doctrine of \"the balance of power\" as belonging to the old international  order which had been repudiated because it had produced the conditions  that resulted in the Great War.    A week after the delivery of M. Clemenceau's address I discussed his  declarations at some length with Colonel House, and he agreed with me  that the doctrine was entirely contrary to the public opinion of the  world and that every effort should be made to prevent its revival and to  end the \"system of alliances\" which M. Clemenceau desired to continue.    During this conversation I pointed out that the form of affirmative  guaranty, which the President then had in mind, would unavoidably impose  the burden of enforcing it upon the Great Powers, and that they, having  that responsibility, would demand the right to decide at what time and  in what manner the guaranty should be enforced. This seemed to me to be  only a different application of the principle expressed in the doctrine  of \"the balance of power\" and to amount to a practical continuance of  the alliances formed for prosecution of the war. I said that, in my  judgment, if the President's guaranty was made the central idea of the  League of Nations, it would play directly into the hands of M.  Clemenceau because it could mean nothing other than the primacy of the  great military and naval powers; that I could not understand how the  President was able to harmonize his plan of a positive guaranty with his  utterances at Manchester; and that, if he clung to his plan, he would  have to accept the Clemenceau doctrine, which would to all intents  transform the Conference into a second Congress of Vienna and result in  a reversion to the old undesirable order, and its continuance in the  League of Nations.    It was my hope that Colonel House, to whom I had shown the letter and  memoranda which I had sent to the President, would be so impressed with  the inconsistency of favoring the affirmative guaranty and of opposing  the doctrine of \"the balance of power,\" that he would exert his  influence with the President to persuade him to find a substitute for  the guaranty which Mr. Wilson then favored. It seemed politic to  approach the President in this way in view of the fact that he had never  acknowledged my letter or manifested any inclination to discuss the  subject with me.    This hope was increased when the Colonel came to me on the evening of  the same day that we had the conversation related above and told me that  he was \"entirely converted\" to my plan for a negative guaranty and for  the organization of a League.    At this second interview Colonel House gave me a typewritten copy of the  President's plan and asked me to examine it and to suggest a way to  amend it so that it would harmonize with my views. This was the first  time that I had seen the President's complete plan for a League. My  previous knowledge had been gained orally and was general and more or  less vague in character except as to the guaranty of which I had an  accurate idea through the President's \"Bases of Peace\" of 1917, and  Point XIV of his address of January 8, 1918. At the time that the  typewritten plan was handed to me another copy had already been given to  the printer of the Commission. It was evident, therefore, that the  President was satisfied with the document. It contained the theory and  fundamental principles which he advocated for world organization.          CHAPTER VI    THE PRESIDENT'S PLAN AND THE CECIL PLAN      I immediately began an examination and analysis of the President's plan  for a League, having in mind Colonel House's suggestion that I consider  a way to modify it so that it would harmonize with my views. The more I  studied the document, the less I liked it. A cursory reading of the  plan, which is printed in the Appendix (page 281), will disclose the  looseness of the language and the doubtful interpretation of many of the  provisions. It showed an inexpertness in drafting and a fault in  expression which were chargeable to lack of appreciation of the need of  exactness or else to haste in preparation. This fault in the paper,  which was very apparent, could, however, be cured and was by no means a  fatal defect. As a matter of fact, the faults of expression were to a  certain extent removed by subsequent revisions, though some of the  vagueness and ambiguity of the first draft persisted and appeared in the  final text of the Covenant.    The more serious defects of the plan were in the principles on which it  was based and in their application under the provisions of the articles  proposed. The contemplated use of force in making good the guaranty of  sovereign rights and the establishment of a primacy of the Great Powers  were provided for in language which was sufficiently explicit to admit  of no denial. In my opinion these provisions were entirely out of  harmony with American ideals, policies, and traditions. Furthermore, the  clauses in regard to arbitration and appeals from arbitral awards, to  which reference has been made, the lack of any provision for the  establishment of a permanent international judiciary, and the  introduction of the mandatory system were strong reasons to reject the  President's plan.    It should be borne in mind that, at the time that this document was  placed in my hands, the plan of General Smuts for a League of Nations  had, as I have said, been printed in the press and in pamphlet form and  had been given wide publicity. In the Smuts plan, which gave first place  to the system of mandates, appeared the declaration that the League of  Nations was to acquire the mandated territories as \"the heir of the  Empires.\" This clever and attractive phrase caught the fancy of the  President, as was evident from his frequent repetition and approval of  it in discussing mandates under the League. Just as General Smuts had  adopted the President's \"self-determination,\" Mr. Wilson seized upon the  Smuts idea with avidity and incorporated it in his plan. It  unquestionably had a decided influence upon his conception of the right  way to dispose of the colonial possessions of Germany and of the proper  relation of the newly created European states to the League of Nations.  As an example of the way in which President Wilson understood and  applied General Smuts's phrase to the new states, I quote the following  from the \"Supplementary Agreements\" forming part of the first printed  draft of the President's Covenant, but which I believe were added to the  typewritten draft after the President had examined the plan of the South  African statesman:       \"As successor to the Empires, the League of Nations is empowered,     directly and without right of delegation, to watch over the relations     _inter se_ of all new independent states arising or created out of     the Empires, and shall assume and fulfill the duty of conciliating     and composing differences between them with a view to the maintenance     of settled order and the general peace.\"    There is a natural temptation to a student of international agreements  to analyze critically the composition and language of this provision,  but to do so would in no way advance the consideration of the subject  under discussion and would probably be interpreted as a criticism of the  President's skill in accurately expressing his thoughts, a criticism  which it is not my purpose to make.    Mr. Wilson's draft also contained a system of mandates over territories  in a form which was, to say the least, rudimentary if not inadequate. By  the proposed system the League of Nations, as \"the residuary trustee,\"  was to take sovereignty over \"the peoples and territories\" of the  defeated Empires and to issue a mandate to some power or powers to  exercise such sovereignty. A \"residuary trustee\" was a novelty in  international relations sufficient to arouse conjecture as to its  meaning, but giving to the League the character of an independent state  with the capacity of possessing sovereignty and the power to exercise  sovereign rights through a designated agent was even more extraordinary.  This departure from the long accepted idea of the essentials of  statehood seemed to me an inexpedient and to a degree a dangerous  adventure. The only plausible excuse for the proposal seemed to be a  lack of knowledge as to the nature of sovereignty and as to the  attributes inherent in the very conception of a state. The character of  a mandate, a mandatory, and the authority issuing the mandate presented  many legal perplexities which certainly required very careful study  before the experiment was tried. Until the system was fully worked out  and the problems of practical operation were solved, it seemed to me  unwise to suggest it and still more unwise to adopt it. While the  general idea of mandates issuing from the proposed international  organization was presumably acceptable to the President from the first,  his support was doubtless confirmed by the fact that it followed the  groove which had been made in his mind by the Smuts phrase \"the heir of  the Empires.\"    In any event it seemed to me the course of wise statesmanship to  postpone the advocacy of mandates, based on the assumption that the  League of Nations could become the possessor of sovereignty, until the  practical application of the theory could be thoroughly considered from  the standpoint of international law as well as from the standpoint of  policy. The experiment was too revolutionary to be tried without  hesitation and without consideration of the effect on"]]]
