He said very little to the superintendent except that a  person who was very dear to him had not returned home that evening.    \"He had not felt really anxious until half an hour ago, when suddenly he  thought of looking at his paper. The description of the deceased lady,  though vague, had terribly alarmed him. He had jumped into a hansom, and  now begged permission to view the body, in order that his worst fears  might be allayed.    \"You know what followed, of course,\" continued the man in the corner,  \"the grief of the young man was truly pitiable. In the woman lying there  in a public mortuary before him, Mr. Hazeldene had recognized his wife.    \"I am waxing melodramatic,\" said the man in the corner, who looked up at  Polly with a mild and gentle smile, while his nervous fingers vainly  endeavoured to add another knot on the scrappy bit of string with which  he was continually playing, \"and I fear that the whole story savours of  the penny novelette, but you must admit, and no doubt you remember, that  it was an intensely pathetic and truly dramatic moment.    \"The unfortunate young husband of the deceased lady was not much worried  with questions that night. As a matter of fact, he was not in a fit  condition to make any coherent statement. It was at the coroner's  inquest on the following day that certain facts came to light, which for  the time being seemed to clear up the mystery surrounding Mrs.  Hazeldene's death, only to plunge that same mystery, later on, into  denser gloom than before.    \"The first witness at the inquest was, of course, Mr. Hazeldene himself.  I think every one's sympathy went out to the young man as he stood  before the coroner and tried to throw what light he could upon the  mystery. He was well dressed, as he had been the day before, but he  looked terribly ill and worried, and no doubt the fact that he had not  shaved gave his face a careworn and neglected air.    \"It appears that he and the deceased had been married some six years or  so, and that they had always been happy in their married life. They had  no children. Mrs. Hazeldene seemed to enjoy the best of health till  lately, when she had had a slight attack of influenza, in which Dr.  Arthur Jones had attended her. The doctor was present at this moment,  and would no doubt explain to the coroner and the jury whether he  thought that Mrs. Hazeldene had the slightest tendency to heart disease,  which might have had a sudden and fatal ending.    \"The coroner was, of course, very considerate to the bereaved husband.  He tried by circumlocution to get at the point he wanted, namely, Mrs.  Hazeldene's mental condition lately. Mr. Hazeldene seemed loath to talk  about this. No doubt he had been warned as to the existence of the small  bottle found in his wife's satchel.    \"'It certainly did seem to me at times,' he at last reluctantly  admitted, 'that my wife did not seem quite herself. She used to be very  gay and bright, and lately I often saw her in the evening sitting, as if  brooding over some matters, which evidently she did not care to  communicate to me.'    \"Still the coroner insisted, and suggested the small bottle.    \"'I know, I know,' replied the young man, with a short, heavy sigh. 'You  mean--the question of suicide--I cannot understand it at all--it seems  so sudden and so terrible--she certainly had seemed listless and  troubled lately--but only at times--and yesterday morning, when I went  to business, she appeared quite herself again, and I suggested that we  should go to the opera in the evening. She was delighted, I know, and  told me she would do some shopping, and pay a few calls in the  afternoon.'    \"'Do you know at all where she intended to go when she got into the  Underground Railway?'    \"'Well, not with certainty. You see, she may have meant to get out at  Baker Street, and go down to Bond Street to do her shopping. Then,  again, she sometimes goes to a shop in St. Paul's Churchyard, in which  case she would take a ticket to Aldersgate Street; but I cannot say.'    \"'Now, Mr. Hazeldene,' said the coroner at last very kindly, 'will you  try to tell me if there was anything in Mrs. Hazeldene's life which you  know of, and which might in some measure explain the cause of the  distressed state of mind, which you yourself had noticed? Did there  exist any financial difficulty which might have preyed upon Mrs.  Hazeldene's mind; was there any friend--to whose intercourse with Mrs.  Hazeldene--you--er--at any time took exception? In fact,' added the  coroner, as if thankful that he had got over an unpleasant moment, 'can  you give me the slightest indication which would tend to confirm the  suspicion that the unfortunate lady, in a moment of mental anxiety or  derangement, may have wished to take her own life?'    \"There was silence in the court for a few moments. Mr. Hazeldene seemed  to every one there present to be labouring under some terrible moral  doubt. He looked very pale and wretched, and twice attempted to speak  before he at last said in scarcely audible tones:    \"'No; there were no financial difficulties of any sort. My wife had an  independent fortune of her own--she had no extravagant tastes--'    \"'Nor any friend you at any time objected to?' insisted the coroner.    \"'Nor any friend, I--at any time objected to,' stammered the unfortunate  young man, evidently speaking with an effort.    \"I was present at the inquest,\" resumed the man in the corner, after he  had drunk a glass of milk and ordered another, \"and I can assure you  that the most obtuse person there plainly realized that Mr. Hazeldene  was telling a lie. It was pretty plain to the meanest intelligence that  the unfortunate lady had not fallen into a state of morbid dejection for  nothing, and that perhaps there existed a third person who could throw  more light on her strange and sudden death than the unhappy, bereaved  young widower.    \"That the death was more mysterious even than it had at first appeared  became very soon apparent. You read the case at the time, no doubt, and  must remember the excitement in the public mind caused by the evidence  of the two doctors. Dr. Arthur Jones, the lady's usual medical man, who  had attended her in a last very slight illness, and who had seen her in  a professional capacity fairly recently, declared most emphatically that  Mrs. Hazeldene suffered from no organic complaint which could possibly  have been the cause of sudden death. Moreover, he had assisted Mr.  Andrew Thornton, the district medical officer, in making a postmortem  examination, and together they had come to the conclusion that death was  due to the action of prussic acid, which had caused instantaneous  failure of the heart, but how the drug had been administered neither he  nor his colleague were at present able to state.    \"'Do I understand, then, Dr. Jones, that the deceased died, poisoned  with prussic acid?'    \"'Such is my opinion,' replied the doctor.    \"'Did the bottle found in her satchel contain prussic acid?'    \"'It had contained some at one time, certainly.'    \"'In your opinion, then, the lady caused her own death by taking a dose  of that drug?'    \"'Pardon me, I never suggested such a thing; the lady died poisoned by  the drug, but how the drug was administered we cannot say. By injection  of some sort, certainly. The drug certainly was not swallowed; there was  not a vestige of it in the stomach.'    \"'Yes,' added the doctor in reply to another question from the coroner,  'death had probably followed the injection in this case almost  immediately; say within a couple of minutes, or perhaps three. It was  quite possible that the body would not have more than one quick and  sudden convulsion, perhaps not that; death in such cases is absolutely  sudden and crushing.'    \"I don't think that at the time any one in the room realized how  important the doctor's statement was, a statement which, by the way, was  confirmed in all its details by the district medical officer, who had  conducted the postmortem. Mrs. Hazeldene had died suddenly from an  injection of prussic acid, administered no one knew how or when. She  had been travelling in a first-class railway carriage in a busy time of  the day. That young and elegant woman must have had singular nerve and  coolness to go through the process of a self-inflicted injection of a  deadly poison in the presence of perhaps two or three other persons.    \"Mind you, when I say that no one there realized the importance of the  doctor's statement at that moment, I am wrong; there were three persons,  who fully understood at once the gravity of the situation, and the  astounding development which the case was beginning to assume.    \"Of course, I should have put myself out of the question,\" added the  weird old man, with that inimitable self-conceit peculiar to himself. \"I  guessed then and there in a moment where the police were going wrong,  and where they would go on going wrong until the mysterious death on the  Underground Railway had sunk into oblivion, together with the other  cases which they mismanage from time to time.    \"I said there were three persons who understood the gravity of the two  doctors' statements--the other two were, firstly, the detective who had  originally examined the railway carriage, a young man of energy and  plenty of misguided intelligence, the other was Mr. Hazeldene.    \"At this point the interesting element of the whole story was first  introduced into the proceedings, and this was done through the humble  channel of Emma Funnel, Mrs. Hazeldene's maid, who, as far as was known  then, was the last person who had seen the unfortunate lady alive and  had spoken to her.    \"'Mrs."]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/10574"],[0,"The History of England, Volume I (#13)"],[1," which happened in the forty-eighth year  of Edwin's age, and seventeenth of his reign [y], divided the monarchy  of Northumberland, which that prince had united in his person.  Eanfrid, the son of Adelfrid, returned with his brothers, Oswald and  Oswy, from Scotland, and took possession of Bernicia, his paternal  kingdom: Osric, Edwin's cousin-german, established himself at Deiri,  the inheritance of his family, but to which the sons of Edwin had a  preferable title.  Eanfrid, the elder surviving son, fled to Penda, by  whom he was treacherously slain.  The younger son, Vuscfraea, with  Yffi, the grandson of Edwin, by Osfrid, sought protection in Kent, and  not finding themselves in safety there, retired into France to King  Dagobert, where they died [z].  [FN [x] Matth. West. p. 114  Chron. Sax. p. 29.  [y] W. Malmes. lib 1.  cap. 3.  [z] Bede, lib. 2. cap. 20.]    Osric, King of Deiri, and Eanfrid, of Bernicia, returned to paganism,  and the whole people seem to have returned with them; since Paullinus,  who was the first Archbishop of York, and who had converted them,  thought proper to retire with Ethelburga, the queen dowager, into  Kent.  Both these Northumbrian kings perished soon after, the first in  battle against Caedwalla, the Briton; the second by the treachery of  that prince.  Oswald, the brother of Eanfrid, of the race of Bernicia,  united again the kingdom of Northumberland in the year 634, and  restored the Christian religion in his dominions.  He gained a bloody  and well-disputed battle against Caedwalla; the last vigorous effort  which the Britons made against the Saxons.  Oswald is much celebrated  for his sanctity and charity by the monkish historians, and they  pretend that his relics wrought miracles, particularly the curing of a  sick horse, which had approached the place of his interment [a].  [FN [a] Ibid. lib. 3. cap. 9.]    He died in battle against Penda, King of Mercia, and was succeeded by  his brother Oswy, who established himself in the government of the  whole Northumbrian kingdom, by putting to death Oswin, the son of  Osric, the last king of the race of Deiri.  His son Egfrid succeeded  him; who perishing in battle against the Picts, without leaving any  children, because Adelthrid, his wife, refused to violate her vow of  chastity, Alfred, his natural brother, acquired possession of the  kingdom, which he governed for nineteen years, and he left it to  Osred, his son, a boy of eight years of age.  This prince, after a  reign of eleven years, was murdered by Kenred, his kinsman, who, after  enjoying the crown only a year, perished by a like fate.  Osric, and  after him Celwulph, the son of Kenred, next mounted the throne, which  the latter relinquished in the year 735, in favour of Eadbert, his  cousin-german, who, imitating his predecessor, abdicated the crown,  and retired into a monastery.  Oswolf, son of Eadbert, was slain in a  sedition, a year after his accession to the crown; and Mollo, who was  not of the royal family, seized the crown.  He perished by the  treachery of Ailred, a prince of the blood; and Ailred, having  succeeded in his design upon the throne, was soon after expelled by  his subjects.  Ethelred, his successor, the son of Mollo, underwent a  like fate.  Celwold, the next king, the brother of Ailred, was deposed  and slain by the people, and his place was filled by Osred, his  nephew, who, after a short reign of a year, made way for Ethelbert,  another son of Mollo, whose death was equally tragical with that of  almost all his predecessors.  After Ethelbert's death an universal  anarchy prevailed in Northumberland, and the people having, by so many  fatal revolutions, lost all attachment to their government and  princes, were well prepared for subjection to a foreign yoke, which  Egbert, King of Wessex, finally imposed upon them.    [MN The kingdom of East Anglia.]  The history of this kingdom contains nothing memorable except the  conversion of Earpwold, the fourth king, and great-grandson of Uffa,  the founder of the monarchy.  The authority of Edwin, King of  Northumberland, on whom that prince entirely depended, engaged him to  take this step; but soon after, his wife, who was an idolatress,  brought him back to her religion, and he was found unable to resist  those allurements which had seduced the wisest of mankind.  After his  death, which was violent, like that of most of the Saxon princes that  did not early retire into monasteries, Sigebert, his successor and  half brother, who had been educated in France, restored Christianity,  and introduced learning among the East Angles.  Some pretend that he  founded the university of Cambridge, or rather some schools in that  place.  It is almost impossible,  and quite needless, to be more  particular in relating the transactions of the East Angles.  What  instruction or entertainment can it give the reader, to hear a long  bead-roll of barbarous names, Egric, Annas, Ethelbert, Ethelwald,  Aldulf; Elfwald, Beorne, Ethelred, Ethelbert, who successively  murdered, expelled, or inherited from each other, and obscurely filled  the throne of that kingdom?  Ethelbert, the last of these princes, was  treacherously murdered by Offa, King of Mercia, in the year 792, and  his state was thenceforth united with that of Offa, as we shall relate  presently.    [MN The kingdom of Mercia.]  Mercia, the largest if not the most powerful kingdom of the Heptarchy,  comprehended all the middle counties of England, and as its frontiers  extended to those of all the other six kingdoms, as well as to Wales,  it received its name from that circumstance.  Wibba, the son of Crida,  founder of the monarchy, being placed on the throne, by Ethelbert,  King of Kent, governed his paternal dominions by a precarious  authority, and after his death, Ceorl, his kinsman, was, by the  influence of the Kentish monarch, preferred to his son Penda, whose  turbulent character appeared dangerous to that prince.  Penda was thus  fifty years of age before he mounted the throne, and his temerity and  restless disposition were found nowise abated by time, experience, or  reflection.  He engaged in continual hostilities against all the  neighbouring states, and by his injustice and violence rendered  himself equally odious to his own subjects and to strangers.  Sigebert, Egric, and Annas, three kings of East Anglia, perished  successively in battle against him, as did also Edwin and Oswald, the  two greatest princes that had reigned over Northumberland.  At last  Oswy, brother to Oswald, having defeated and slain him in a decisive  battle, freed the world from this sanguinary tyrant.  Peada, his son,  mounted the throne of Mercia in 655, and lived under the protection of  Oswy, whose daughter he had espoused.  This princess was educated in  the Christian faith, and she employed her influence with success, in  converting her husband and his subjects to that religion.  Thus the  fair sex have had the merit of introducing the Christian doctrine into  all the most considerable  kingdoms of the Saxon Heptarchy.  Peada  died a violent death [b].  His son, Wolfhere, succeeded to the  government, and, after having reduced to dependence the kingdoms of  Essex and East Anglia, he, left the crown to his brother Ethelred,  who, though a lover of peace, showed himself not unfit for military  enterprises.  Besides making a successful expedition into Kent, he  repulsed Egfrid, King of Northumberland, who had invaded his  dominions; and he slew in battle Elfwin, the brother of that prince.  Desirous, however, of composing all animosities with Egfrid, he paid  him a sum of money as a compensation for the loss of his brother.  After a prosperous reign of thirty years, he resigned the crown to  Kendred, son of Wolfhere, and retired into the monastery of Bardney  [c].  Kendred returned the present of the crown to Ceolred, the son of  Ethelred, and making a pilgrimage to Rome, passed his life there in  penance and devotion.  The place of Ceolred was supplied by Ethelbald,  great-grand-nephew to Penda, by Alwy, his brother; and this prince,  being slain in a mutiny, was succeeded by Offa, who was a degree more  remote from Penda, by Eawa, another brother.  [FN [b] Hugo Candidus, p. 4, says, that he was treacherously murdered  by his queen, by whose persuasion he had embraced Christianity; but  this account of the matter is found in that historian alone.  [c]  Bede, lib. 5.]    This prince, who mounted the throne in 775 [d], had some great  qualities, and was successful in his warlike enterprises against  Lothaire, King of Kent, and Kenwulph, King of Wessex.  He defeated the  former in a bloody battle at Otford upon the Darent, and reduced his  kingdom to a state of dependence: he gained a victory over the latter  at Bensington in Oxfordshire; and conquering that county, together  with that of Gloucester, annexed both to his dominions.  But all these  successes were stained by his treacherous murder of Ethelbert, King of  the East Angles, and his violent seizing of that kingdom.  This young  prince, who is said to have possessed great merit, had paid his  addresses to Elfrida, the daughter of Offa, and was invited with all  his retinue to Hereford, in order to solemnize the nuptials.  Amidst  the joy and festivity of these entertainments, he was seized by Offa,  and secretly beheaded; and though Elfrida, who abhorred her father's  treachery, had time to give warning to the East Anglian nobility, who  escaped into their own country, Offa, having extinguished the royal  family, succeeded in his design of subduing that kingdom [e].  The  perfidious prince, desirous of re-establishing his character in the  world, and perhaps of appeasing the remorses of his own conscience,  paid great court to the clergy, and practised all the monkish devotion  so much esteemed in that ignorant and superstitious age.  He gave the  tenth of his goods to the church [f]; bestowed rich"]]]
