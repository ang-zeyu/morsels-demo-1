Bismarck always looked on the new Minister with great dislike. Radowitz,  indeed, hated the Revolution as much as he did; he was a zealous and  patriotic Prussian; but there was a fundamental difference in the nature  of the two men. Radowitz wished to reform Germany by moral influence.  Bismarck did not believe in the possibility of this. To this perhaps we  must add some personal feeling. The Ministry had hitherto consisted  almost entirely of men who were either personal friends of Bismarck, or  whom he had recommended to the King. With Radowitz there entered into it  a man who was superior to all of them in ability, and over whom Bismarck  could not hope to have any influence. Bismarck's distrust, which  amounted almost to hatred, depended, however, on his fear that the new  policy would bring about the ruin of Prussia. He took the extreme  Particularist view; he had no interest in Germany outside Prussia;  Wuertemberg and Bavaria were to him foreign States. In all these  proposals for a new Constitution he saw only that Prussia would be  required to sacrifice its complete independence; that the King of  Prussia would become executor for the decrees of a popular and alien  Parliament. They were asked to cease to be Prussians in order that they  might become Germans. This Bismarck refused to do. \"Prussians we are,\"  he said, \"and Prussians we will remain.\" He had no sympathy with this  idea of a United Germany which was so powerful at the time; there was  only one way in which he was willing that Germany should be united, and  that was according to the example which Frederick the Great had set. The  ideals of the German nation were represented by Arndt's famous song,  \"Was ist des Deutschen Vaterland?\" The fatherland of the Germans was not  Suabia or Prussia, not Austria or Bavaria, it was the whole of Germany  wherever the German tongue was spoken. From this Bismarck deliberately  dissociated himself. \"I have never heard,\" he said, \"a Prussian soldier  singing, 'Was ist des Deutschen Vaterland?'\" The new flag of Germany was  to be the German tricolour, black and white and gold.      \"The Prussian soldiers,\" cried Bismarck, \"have no tricoloured    enthusiasm; among them you will find, as little as in the rest of    the Prussian people, the desire for a national regeneration; they    are contented with the name of Prussia, and proud of the name of    Prussia. These troops follow the black and white flag, not the    tricolour; under the black and white they die with joy for their    country. The tricolour they have learnt since the 18th of March    to look on as the colours of their foes.\"    These words aroused intense indignation. One of the speakers who  followed referred to him as the Prodigal Son of the German Fatherland,  who had deserted his father's house. Bismarck repudiated the epithet. \"I  am not a prodigal son,\" he said; \"my father's house is Prussia and I  have never left it.\" He could not more clearly repudiate the title  German. The others were moved by enthusiasm for an idea, he by loyalty  to an existing State.    Nothing was sound, he said, in Germany, except the old Prussian  institutions.      \"What has preserved us is that which is specifically Prussian. It    was the remnant of the _Stock-Preussenthum_ which has survived    the Revolution, the Prussian army, the Prussian treasure, the    fruits of many years of intelligent Prussian administration, and    the living co-operation between King and people. It was the    attachment of the Prussian people to their hereditary dynasty,    the old Prussian virtues of honour, loyalty, obedience, and the    courage which, emanating from the officers who form its bone and    marrow, permeates the army down to the youngest recruit.\"    He reminded the House how the Assembly at Frankfort had only been saved  from the insurgent mob by a Prussian regiment, and now it was proposed  to weaken and destroy all these Prussian institutions in order to change  them into a democratic Germany. He was asked to assent to a Constitution  in which the Prussian Government would sink to the level of a provincial  council, under the guidance of an Imperial Ministry which itself would  be dependent on a Parliament in which the Prussian interests would be in  a minority. The most important and honourable duties of the Prussian  Parliament would be transferred to a general Parliament; the King would  lose his veto; he would be compelled against his will to assent to laws  he disliked; even the Prussian army would be no longer under his sole  command. What recompense were they to gain for this?      \"The pleasant consciousness of having followed an unselfish and    noble policy; of having satisfied the requirements of a national    regeneration; of having carried out the historical task of    Prussia, or some such vague expression.\"    With this he contrasted what would have been a true Prussian policy, a  policy which Frederick the Great might have followed.      \"He would have known that now as in the day of our fathers the    sound of the trumpets which summoned them to their sovereign's    flag has not lost its power for Prussian ears; he would have had    the choice either of joining our old comrade Austria, and    undertaking the brilliant part which the Emperor of Russia has    played, and destroying the cause of the Revolution, or by the    same right by which he took Silesia, he might, after refusing to    accept the crown, have ordered the Germans what constitution they    should have, and thrown the sword into the scale; then Prussia    would have been in the position to win for Germany its place in    the Council of Europe.      \"We all wish the same. We all wish that the Prussian eagle should    spread out his wings as guardian and ruler from the Memel to the    Donnersberg, but free will we have him, not bound by a new    Regensburg Diet. Prussians we are and Prussians will we remain; I    know that in these words I speak the confession of the Prussian    army and the majority of my fellow-countrymen, and I hope to God    that we will still long remain Prussian when this sheet of paper    is forgotten like a withered autumn leaf.\"    The policy of Radowitz was doomed to failure, not so much because of any  inherent weakness in it, but because Prussia was not strong enough to  defend herself against all the enemies she had called up. The other  Courts of Germany were lukewarm, Austria was extremely hostile. The  Kings of Hanover and Saxony retreated from the alliance on the ground  that they would enter the union only if the whole of Germany joined;  Bavaria had refused to do so; in fact the two other Kings had privately  used all their influence to prevent Bavaria from joining, in order that  they might always have an excuse for seceding. Prussia was, therefore,  left surrounded by twenty-eight of the smaller States. A Parliament from  them was summoned to meet at Erfurt in order to discuss the new  Constitution. Bismarck was elected a member of it; he went there  avowedly to protect the Prussian interests. He had demanded from the  Government that at least the Constitution agreed on in Erfurt should  again be submitted to the Prussian Chamber; he feared that many of the  most important Prussian rights might be sacrificed. His request was  refused, for it was obvious that if, after the Parliament of Erfurt had  come to some conclusion, the new Constitution was to be referred back  again to the twenty-eight Parliaments of the allied States, the new  union would never come into effect at all. It is curious here to find  Bismarck using the rights of the Prussian Parliament as a weapon to  maintain the complete independence of Prussia. Sixteen years later, when  he was doing the work in which Radowitz failed, one of his chief  difficulties arose from the conduct of men who came forward with just  the same demand which he now made, and he had to refuse their demands as  Radowitz now refused his.    He did not take much part in the debates at Erfurt; as he was one of the  youngest of the members, he held the position of Secretary; the  President of the Assembly was Simpson, a very distinguished public man,  but a converted Jew. \"What would my father have said,\" observed  Bismarck, \"if he had lived to see me become clerk to a Jewish scholar?\"  On one occasion he became involved in what might have been a very  serious dispute, when he used his power as Secretary to exclude from the  reporters' gallery two journalists whose reports of the meeting were  very partial and strongly opposed to Austria. His attitude towards the  Assembly is shewn by the words:      \"I know that what I have said to you will have no influence on    your votes, but I am equally convinced that your votes will be as    completely without influence on the course of events.\"    The whole union was, as a matter of fact, broken down by the opposition  of Austria. Bismarck had, in one of his first speeches, warned against a  policy which would bring Prussia into the position which Piedmont had  held before the battle of Novara, when they embarked on a war in which  victory would have brought about the overthrow of the monarchy, and  defeat a disgraceful peace. It was his way of saying that he hoped the  King would not eventually draw the sword in order to defend the new  Liberal Constitution against the opposition of Austria. The day came  when the King was placed in this position. Austria had summoned the old  Diet to meet at Frankfort; Prussia denied that the Diet still legally  existed; the two policies were clearly opposed to one another: Austria  desiring the restoration of the old Constitution, Prussia, at the head  of Liberal Germany, summoning the States round her in a new union. There  were other disputes about Schleswig-Holstein and the affairs of Hesse,  but this was the real point at issue. The Austrians were armed, and were  supported by"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/12422"],[0,"Journal of a Residence on a Georgian Plantation: 1838-1839 (#13)"],[1," discomfort of which has to them all the addition of comparison  with our mode of living. Now, in all establishments whatever, of course  some disparity exists between the comforts of the drawing-room and best  bed-rooms, and the servant's hall and attics, but here it is no longer a  matter of degree. The young woman who performs the office of lady's-maid,  and the lads who wait upon us at table, have neither table to feed at nor  chair to sit down upon themselves. The boys sleep at night on the hearth  by the kitchen fire, and the women upon a rough board bedstead, strewed  with a little tree moss. All this shows how very torpid the sense of  justice is apt to lie in the breasts of those who have it not awakened by  the peremptory demands of others.    In the north we could not hope to keep the worst and poorest servant for  a single day in the wretched discomfort in which our negro servants are  forced habitually to live. I received a visit this morning from some of  the Darien people. Among them was a most interesting young person, from  whose acquaintance, if I have any opportunity of cultivating it, I  promise myself much pleasure. The ladies that I have seen since I  crossed the southern line, have all seemed to me extremely sickly in  their appearance--delicate in the refined term, but unfortunately sickly  in the truer one. They are languid in their deportment and speech, and  seem to give themselves up, without an effort to counteract it, to the  enervating effect of their warm climate. It is undoubtedly a most  relaxing and unhealthy one, and therefore requires the more imperatively  to be met by energetic and invigorating habits both of body and mind. Of  these, however, the southern ladies appear to have, at present, no very  positive idea. Doctor ---- told us to-day of a comical application which  his negro man had made to him for the coat he was then wearing. I forget  whether the fellow wanted the loan, or the absolute gift of it, but his  argument was (it might have been an Irishman's) that he knew his master  intended to give it to him by and by, and that he thought he might as  well let him have it at once, as keep him waiting any longer for it.  This story the Doctor related with great glee, and it furnishes a very  good sample of what the Southerners are fond of exhibiting, the degree  of licence to which they capriciously permit their favourite slaves  occasionally to carry their familiarity. They seem to consider it as an  undeniable proof of the general kindness with which their dependents are  treated. It is as good a proof of it as the maudlin tenderness of a fine  lady to her lap-dog is of her humane treatment of animals in general.  Servants whose claims to respect are properly understood by themselves  and their employers, are not made pets, playthings, jesters, or  companions of, and it is only the degradation of the many that admits of  this favouritism to the few--a system of favouritism which, as it is  perfectly consistent with the profoundest contempt and injustice,  degrades the object of it quite as much, though it oppresses him less,  than the cruelty practised upon his fellows. I had several of these  favourite slaves presented to me, and one or two little negro children,  who their owners assured me were quite pets. The only real service which  this arbitrary goodwill did to the objects of it was quite involuntary  and unconscious on the part of their kind masters--I mean the inevitable  improvement in intelligence, which resulted to them from being more  constantly admitted to the intercourse of the favoured white race.    I must not forget to tell you of a magnificent bald-headed eagle which  Mr. ---- called me to look at early this morning. I had never before seen  alive one of these national types of yours, and stood entranced as the  noble creature swept, like a black cloud, over the river, his bald white  head bent forward and shining in the sun, and his fierce eyes and beak  directed towards one of the beautiful wild ducks on the water, which he  had evidently marked for his prey. The poor little duck, who was not  ambitious of such a glorification, dived, and the eagle hovered above the  spot. After a short interval, its victim rose to the surface several  yards nearer shore. The great king of birds stooped nearer, and again the  watery shield was interposed. This went on until the poor water-fowl,  driven by excess of fear into unwonted boldness, rose, after repeatedly  diving, within a short distance of where we stood. The eagle, who, I  presume, had read how we were to have dominion over the fowls of the air  (bald-headed eagles included), hovered sulkily awhile over the river, and  then sailing slowly towards the woods on the opposite shore, alighted and  furled his great wings on a huge cypress limb, that stretched itself out  against the blue sky, like the arm of a giant, for the giant bird to  perch upon.    I am amusing myself by attempting to beautify, in some sort, this  residence of ours. Immediately at the back of it runs a ditch, about three  feet wide, which empties and fills twice a day with the tide. This lies  like a moat on two sides of the house. The opposite bank is a steep dyke,  with a footpath along the top. One or two willows droop over this very  interesting ditch, and I thought I would add to their company some  magnolias and myrtles, and so make a little evergreen plantation round the  house. I went to the swamp reserves I have before mentioned to you, and  chose some beautiful bushes--among others, a very fine young pine, at  which our overseer and all the negroes expressed much contemptuous  surprise; for though the tree is beautiful, it is also common, and with  them, as with wiser folk 'tis 'nothing pleases but rare accidents.' In  spite of their disparaging remarks, however, I persisted in having my pine  tree planted; and I assure you it formed a very pleasing variety among the  broad smooth leaved evergreens about it. While forming my plantation I had  a brand thrown into a bed of tall yellow sedges which screen the brimming  waters of the noble river from our parlour window, and which I therefore  wished removed. The small sample of a southern conflagration which ensued  was very picturesque, the flames devouring the light growth, absolutely  licking it off the ground, while the curling smoke drew off in misty  wreaths across the river. The heat was intense, and I thought how  exceedingly and unpleasantly warm one must feel in the midst of such a  forest burning, as Cooper describes. Having worked my appointed task in  the garden, I rowed over to Darien and back, the rosy sunset changing  meantime to starry evening, as beautiful as the first the sky ever was  arrayed in.    I saw an advertisement this morning in the paper, which occasioned me much  thought. Mr. J---- C---- and a Mr. N----, two planters of this  neighbourhood, have contracted to dig a canal, called the Brunswick canal,  and not having hands enough for the work, advertise at the same time for  negroes on hires and for Irish labourers. Now the Irishmen are to have  twenty dollars a month wages, and to be 'found' (to use the technical  phrase,) which finding means abundant food, and the best accommodations  which can be procured for them. The negroes are hired from their masters,  who will be paid of course as high a price as they can obtain for  them--probably a very high one, as the demand for them is urgent--they, in  the meantime, receiving no wages, and nothing more than the miserable  negro fare of rice and corn grits. Of course the Irishmen and these slaves  are not allowed to work together, but are kept at separate stations on the  canal. This is every way politic, for the low Irish seem to have the same  sort of hatred of negroes which sects, differing but little in their  tenets, have for each other. The fact is, that a condition in their own  country nearly similar, has made the poor Irish almost as degraded a class  of beings as the negroes are here, and their insolence towards them, and  hatred of them, are precisely in proportion to the resemblance between  them. This hiring out of negroes is a horrid aggravation of the miseries  of their condition, for, if on the plantations, and under the masters to  whom they belong, their labour is severe, and their food inadequate, think  what it must be when they are hired out for a stipulated sum to a  temporary employer, who has not even the interest which it is pretended an  owner may feel in the welfare of his slaves, but whose chief aim it must  necessarily be to get as much out of them, and expend as little on them,  as possible. Ponder this new form of iniquity, and believe me ever your  most sincerely attached.           *       *       *       *       *      Dearest E----. After finishing my last letter to you, I went out into the  clear starlight to breathe the delicious mildness of the air, and was  surprised to hear rising from one of the houses of the settlement a hymn  sung apparently by a number of voices. The next morning I enquired the  meaning of this, and was informed that those negroes on the plantation who  were members of the Church, were holding a prayer-meeting. There is an  immensely strong devotional feeling among these poor people. The worst of  it is, that it is zeal without understanding, and profits them but  little; yet light is light, even that poor portion that may stream  through a key-hole, and I welcome this most ignorant profession of  religion in Mr. ----'s dependents, as the herald of better and brighter  things for them. Some of the planters are entirely inimical to any such  proceedings, and neither allow their negroes to attend worship, or to  congregate together for religious purposes, and truly I think they are  wise in their own generation. On other plantations, again, the same rigid  discipline is not observed; and some planters and overseers go even  farther than"]]]
