Every new power of controlling these by the will frees  man from slavery and widens the field of freedom. To acquire the power  of doing all with consciousness and volition mentalizes the body,  gives control over to higher brain levels, and develops them by  rescuing activities from the dominance of lower centers. Thus _mens  agitat molem._ [Footnote: Mind rules the body.] This end is favored by  the Swedish _commando_ exercises, which require great alertness of  attention to translate instantly a verbal order into an act and also,  although in somewhat less degree, by quick imitation of a leader. The  stimulus of music and rhythm are excluded because thought to interfere  with this end. A somewhat sophisticated form of this goal is sought by  several Delsartian schemes of relaxation, decomposition, and  recomposition of movements. To do all things with consciousness and to  encroach on the field of instinct involves new and more vivid sense  impressions, the range of which is increased directly as that of  motion, the more closely it approaches the focus of attention. By thus  analyzing settled and established coordinations, their elements are  set free and may be organized into new combinations, so that the  former is the first stage toward becoming a virtuoso with new special  skills. This is the road to inner secrets or intellectual rules of  professional and expert successes, such as older athletes often rely  upon when their strength begins to wane. Every untrained automatism  must be domesticated, and every striated muscle capable of direct  muscular control must be dominated by volition. Thus tensions and  incipient contractures that drain off energy can be relaxed by fiat.  Sandow's \"muscle dance,\" the differentiation of movements of the  right and left hand--one, e.g., writing a French madrigal while the  other is drawing a picture of a country dance, or each playing  tunes of disparate rhythm and character simultaneously on the  piano--controlling heart rate, moving the ears, crying, laughing,  blushing, moving the bowels, etc., at will, feats of inhibition of  reflexes, stunts of all kinds, proficiency with many tools, deftness  in sports--these altogether would mark the extremes in this direction.    This, too, has its inspiration for youth. To be a universal adept like  Hippias suggests Diderot and the encyclopedists in the intellectual  realm. To do all with consciousness is a means to both remedial and  expert ends. Motor life often needs to be made over to a greater or  less extent; and that possibilities of vastly greater accomplishments  exist than are at present realized, is undoubted, even in manners and  morals, which are both at root only motor habits. Indeed consciousness  itself is largely and perhaps wholly corrective in its very essence  and origin. Thus life is adjusted to new environments; and if the  Platonic postulate be correct, that untaught virtues that come by  nature and instinct are no virtues, but must be made products of  reflection and reason, the sphere and need of this principle is great  indeed. But this implies a distrust of physical human nature as  deep-seated and radical as that of Calvinism for the unregenerate  heart, against which modern common sense, so often the best muse of  both psychophysics and pedagogy, protests. Individual prescription is  here as imperative as it is difficult. Wonders that now seem to be  most incredible, both of hurt and help, can undoubtedly be wrought,  but analysis should always be for the sake of synthesis and never be  beyond its need and assured completion. No thoughtful student fully  informed of the facts and tentatives in this field can doubt that here  lies one of the most promising fields of future development, full of  far-reaching and rich results for those, as yet far too few, experts  in physical training, who have philosophic minds, command the facts of  modern psychology, and whom the world awaits now as never before.    C. Another yet closely correlated ideal is that of economic postures  and movements. The system of Ling is less orthopedic than orthogenic,  although he sought primarily to correct bad attitudes and perverted  growth. Starting from the respiratory and proceeding to the muscular  system, he and his immediate pupils were content to refer to the  ill-shapen bodies of most men about them. One of their important aims  was to relax the flexor and tone up the extensor muscles and to open  the human form into postures as opposite as possible to those of the  embryo, which it tends so persistently to approximate in sitting, and  in fatigue and collapse attitudes generally. The head must balance on  the cervical vertebra and not call upon the muscles of the neck to  keep it from rolling off; the weight of the shoulders must be thrown  back off the thorax; the spine be erect to allow the abdomen free  action; the joints of the thigh extended; the hand and arm supinated,  etc. Bones must relieve muscles and nerves. Thus an erect,  self-respecting carriage must be given, and the unfortunate  association, so difficult to overcome, between effort and an involuted  posture must be broken up. This means economy and a great saving of  vital energy. Extensor action goes with expansive, flexor with  depressive states of mind; hence courage, buoyancy, hope, are favored  and handicaps removed. All that is done with great effort causes wide  irradiation of tensions to the other half of the body and also  sympathetic activities in those not involved; the law of maximal ease  and minimal expenditure of energy must be always striven for, and the  interests of the viscera never lost sight of. This involves educating  weak and neglected muscles, and like the next ideal, often shades over  by almost imperceptible gradation into the passive movements by the  Zander machines. Realizing that certain activities are sufficiently or  too much emphasized in ordinary life, stress is laid upon those which  are complemental to them, so that there is no pretense of taking  charge of the totality of motor processes, the intention being  principally to supplement deficiencies, to insure men against being  warped, distorted, or deformed by their work in life, to compensate  specialties and perform more exactly what recreation to some extent  aims at.    This wholesome but less inspiring endeavor, which combats one of the  greatest evils that under modern civilization threatens man's physical  weal, is in some respects as easy and practical as it is useful. The  great majority of city bred men, as well as all students, are prone to  deleterious effects from too much sitting; and indeed there is  anatomical evidence in the structure of the tissues, and especially  the blood-vessels of the groins, that, at his best, man is not yet  entirely adjusted to the upright position. So a method that  straightens knees, hips, spine, and shoulders, or combats the  school-desk attitude, is a most salutary contribution to a great and  growing need. In the very act of stretching, and perhaps yawning, for  which much is to be said, nature itself suggests such correctives and  preventives. To save men from being victims of their occupations is  often to add a better and larger half to their motor development. The  danger of the system, which now best represents this ideal, is  inflexibility and overscholastic treatment. It needs a great range of  individual variations if it would do more than increase circulation,  respiration, and health, or the normal functions of internal organs  and fundamental physiological activities. To clothe the frame with  honest muscles that are faithful servants of the will adds not only  strength, more active habits and efficiency, but health; and in its  material installation this system is financially economic. Personal  faults and shortcomings are constantly pointed out where this work is  best represented, and it has a distinct advantage in inciting an  acquaintance with physiology and inviting the larger fields of medical  knowledge.    D. The fourth gymnastic aim is symmetry and correct proportions.  Anthropometry and average girths and dimensions, strength, etc., of  the parts of the body are first charted in percentile grades; and each  individual is referred to the apparatus and exercises best fitted to  correct weaknesses and subnormalities. The norms here followed are not  the canons of Greek art, but those established by the measurement of  the largest numbers properly grouped by age, weight, height, etc.  Young men are found to differ very widely. Some can lift 1,000 pounds,  and some not 100; some can lift their weight between twenty and forty  times, and some not once; some are most deficient in legs, others in  shoulders, arms, backs, chests. By photography, tape, and scales, each  is interested in his own bodily condition and incited to overcome his  greatest defects; and those best endowed by nature to attain ideal  dimensions and make new records are encouraged along these lines. Thus  this ideal is also largely though not exclusively remedial.    This system can arouse youth to the greatest pitch of zest in watching  their own rapidly multiplying curves of growth in dimensions and  capacities, in plotting curves that record their own increment in  girths, lifts, and other tests, and in observing the effects of sleep,  food, correct and incorrect living upon a system so exquisitely  responsive to all these influences as are the muscles. To learn to  know and grade excellence and defect, to be known for the list of  things one can do and to have a record, or to realize what we lack of  power to break best records, even to know that we are strengthening  some point where heredity has left us with some shortage and perhaps  danger, the realization of all this may bring the first real and deep  feeling for growth that may become a passion later in things of the  soul.

He could move but slowly, resting  often; but savage hatred and an equally savage desire for vengeance  kept him to his task.  As the days passed his wounds healed and his  strength returned, until at last his giant frame had regained all of  its former mighty powers.  Now he went more rapidly; but the mounted  Arabs had covered a great distance while the wounded black had been  painfully crawling after them.    They had reached their fortified camp, and there Achmet Zek awaited the  return of his lieutenant, Albert Werper.  During the long, rough  journey, Jane Clayton had suffered more in anticipation of her  impending fate than from the hardships of the road.    Achmet Zek had not deigned to acquaint her with his intentions  regarding her future.  She prayed that she had been captured in the  hope of ransom, for if such should prove the case, no great harm would  befall her at the hands of the Arabs; but there was the chance, the  horrid chance, that another fate awaited her.  She had heard of many  women, among whom were white women, who had been sold by outlaws such  as Achmet Zek into the slavery of black harems, or taken farther north  into the almost equally hideous existence of some Turkish seraglio.    Jane Clayton was of sterner stuff than that which bends in spineless  terror before danger.  Until hope proved futile she would not give it  up; nor did she entertain thoughts of self-destruction only as a final  escape from dishonor.  So long as Tarzan lived there was every reason  to expect succor.  No man nor beast who roamed the savage continent  could boast the cunning and the powers of her lord and master.  To her,  he was little short of omnipotent in his native world--this world of  savage beasts and savage men.  Tarzan would come, and she would be  rescued and avenged, of that she was certain.  She counted the days  that must elapse before he would return from Opar and discover what had  transpired during his absence.  After that it would be but a short time  before he had surrounded the Arab stronghold and punished the motley  crew of wrongdoers who inhabited it.    That he could find her she had no slightest doubt.  No spoor, however  faint, could elude the keen vigilance of his senses.  To him, the trail  of the raiders would be as plain as the printed page of an open book to  her.    And while she hoped, there came through the dark jungle another.  Terrified by night and by day, came Albert Werper.  A dozen times he  had escaped the claws and fangs of the giant carnivora only by what  seemed a miracle to him.  Armed with nothing more than the knife he had  brought with him from Opar, he had made his way through as savage a  country as yet exists upon the face of the globe.    By night he had slept in trees.  By day he had stumbled fearfully on,  often taking refuge among the branches when sight or sound of some  great cat warned him from danger.  But at last he had come within sight  of the palisade behind which were his fierce companions.    At almost the same time Mugambi came out of the jungle before the  walled village.  As he stood in the shadow of a great tree,  reconnoitering, he saw a man, ragged and disheveled, emerge from the  jungle almost at his elbow.  Instantly he recognized the newcomer as he  who had been a guest of his master before the latter had departed for  Opar.    The black was upon the point of hailing the Belgian when something  stayed him.  He saw the white man walking confidently across the  clearing toward the village gate.  No sane man thus approached a  village in this part of Africa unless he was sure of a friendly  welcome.  Mugambi waited.  His suspicions were aroused.    He heard Werper halloo; he saw the gates swing open, and he witnessed  the surprised and friendly welcome that was accorded the erstwhile  guest of Lord and Lady Greystoke.  A light broke upon the understanding  of Mugambi.  This white man had been a traitor and a spy.  It was to  him they owed the raid during the absence of the Great Bwana.  To his  hate for the Arabs, Mugambi added a still greater hate for the white  spy.    Within the village Werper passed hurriedly toward the silken tent of  Achmet Zek.  The Arab arose as his lieutenant entered.  His face showed  surprise as he viewed the tattered apparel of the Belgian.    \"What has happened?\" he asked.    Werper narrated all, save the little matter of the pouch of gems which  were now tightly strapped about his waist, beneath his clothing.  The  Arab's eyes narrowed greedily as his henchman described the treasure  that the Waziri had buried beside the ruins of the Greystoke bungalow.    \"It will be a simple matter now to return and get it,\" said Achmet Zek.  \"First we will await the coming of the rash Waziri, and after we have  slain them we may take our time to the treasure--none will disturb it  where it lies, for we shall leave none alive who knows of its existence.    \"And the woman?\" asked Werper.    \"I shall sell her in the north,\" replied the raider.  \"It is the only  way, now.  She should bring a good price.\"    The Belgian nodded.  He was thinking rapidly.  If he could persuade  Achmet Zek to send him in command of the party which took Lady  Greystoke north it would give him the opportunity he craved to make his  escape from his chief.  He would forego a share of the gold, if he  could but get away unscathed with the jewels.    He knew Achmet Zek well enough by this time to know that no member of  his band ever was voluntarily released from the service of Achmet Zek.  Most of the few who deserted were recaptured.  More than once had  Werper listened to their agonized screams as they were tortured before  being put to death.  The Belgian had no wish to take the slightest  chance of recapture.    \"Who will go north with the woman,\" he asked, \"while we are returning  for the gold that the Waziri buried by the bungalow of the Englishman?\"    Achmet Zek thought for a moment.  The buried gold was of much greater  value than the price the woman would bring.  It was necessary to rid  himself of her as quickly as possible and it was also well to obtain  the gold with the least possible delay.  Of all his followers, the  Belgian was the most logical lieutenant to intrust with the command of  one of the parties.  An Arab, as familiar with the trails and tribes as  Achmet Zek himself, might collect the woman's price and make good his  escape into the far north.  Werper, on the other hand, could scarce  make his escape alone through a country hostile to Europeans while the  men he would send with the Belgian could be carefully selected with a  view to preventing Werper from persuading any considerable portion of  his command to accompany him should he contemplate desertion of his  chief.    At last the Arab spoke: \"It is not necessary that we both return for  the gold.  You shall go north with the woman, carrying a letter to a  friend of mine who is always in touch with the best markets for such  merchandise, while I return for the gold.  We can meet again here when  our business is concluded.\"    Werper could scarce disguise the joy with which he received this  welcome decision.  And that he did entirely disguise it from the keen  and suspicious eyes of Achmet Zek is open to question.  However, the  decision reached, the Arab and his lieutenant discussed the details of  their forthcoming ventures for a short time further, when Werper made  his excuses and returned to his own tent for the comforts and luxury of  a long-desired bath and shave.    Having bathed, the Belgian tied a small hand mirror to a cord sewn to  the rear wall of his tent, placed a rude chair beside an equally rude  table that stood beside the glass, and proceeded to remove the rough  stubble from his face.    In the catalog of masculine pleasures there is scarce one which imparts  a feeling of greater comfort and refreshment than follows a clean  shave, and now, with weariness temporarily banished, Albert Werper  sprawled in his rickety chair to enjoy a final cigaret before retiring.  His thumbs, tucked in his belt in lazy support of the weight of his  arms, touched the belt which held the jewel pouch about his waist.  He  tingled with excitement as he let his mind dwell upon the value of the  treasure, which, unknown to all save himself, lay hidden beneath his  clothing.    What would Achmet Zek say, if he knew?  Werper grinned.  How the old  rascal's eyes would pop could he but have a glimpse of those  scintillating beauties!  Werper had never yet had an opportunity to  feast his eyes for any great length of time upon them.  He had not even  counted them--only roughly had he guessed at their value.    He unfastened the belt and drew the pouch from its hiding place.  He  was alone.  The balance of the camp, save the sentries, had  retired--none would enter the Belgian's tent.  He fingered the pouch,  feeling out the shapes and sizes of the precious, little nodules  within.  He hefted the bag, first in one palm, then in the other, and  at last he wheeled his chair slowly around before the table, and in the  rays of his small lamp let the glittering gems roll out upon the rough  wood.    The refulgent rays transformed the interior of the soiled and squalid  canvas to the splendor of a palace in the eyes of the dreaming man.  He  saw the gilded halls of pleasure that would open their portals to the  possessor of the wealth which lay scattered upon this stained and  dented table top.  He dreamed of joys and luxuries and power which  always had been beyond his grasp, and as he dreamed his gaze lifted  from the table, as the gaze of a dreamer will, to a far distant goal  above the mean horizon of terrestrial commonplaceness.    Unseeing, his eyes rested upon the shaving mirror which still hung upon  the tent wall above the table; but his sight was focused far beyond.  And then a reflection moved"]]]
