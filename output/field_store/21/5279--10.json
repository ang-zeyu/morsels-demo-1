He was in a degree a constable, a selectman, a  teacher, a tax-collector, an inspector, a sexton, a home-watcher, and above  all, a Puritan Bumble, whose motto was _Hie et ubique_. He was, in  fact, a general law-enforcer and order-keeper, whose various duties,  wherever still necessary and still performed, are now apportioned to  several individuals. The ecclesiastical functions and authority of the  tithingman lingered long after the civil powers had been removed or had  gradually passed away from his office. Persons are now living who in their  early and unruly youth were rapped at and pointed at by a New England  tithingman when they laughed or were noisy in meeting.          VII.    The Length of the Service.      Watches were unknown in the early colonial days of New England, and for a  long time after their introduction both watches and clocks were costly and  rare. John Davenport of New Haven, who died in 1670, left a clock to his  heirs; and E. Needham, who died in 1677, left a \"Striking clock, a watch,  and a Larum that dus not Strike,\" worth L5; these are perhaps the first  records of the ownership of clocks and watches in New England. The time of  the day was indicated to our forefathers in their homes by \"noon marks\" on  the floor or window-seats, and by picturesque sundials; and in the  civil and religious meetings the passage of time was marked by a strong  brass-bound hour-glass, which stood on a desk below or beside the pulpit,  or which was raised on a slender iron rod and standard, so that all the  members of the congregation could easily watch \"the sands that ran i' the  clock's behalf.\" By the side of the desk sat, on the Sabbath, a sexton,  clerk, or tithingman, whose duty it was to turn the hour-glass as often  as the sands ran out. This was a very ostentatious way of reminding the  clergyman how long he had preached; but if it were a hint to bring the  discourse to an end, it was never heeded; for contemporary historical  registers tell of most painfully long sermons, reaching up through long  sub-divisions and heads to \"twenty-seventhly\" and \"twenty-eighthly.\"    At the planting of the first church in Woburn, Massachusetts, the Rev.  Mr. Symmes showed his godliness and endurance (and proved that of his  parishioners also) by preaching between four and five hours. Sermons which  occupied two or three hours were customary enough. One old Scotch clergyman  in Vermont, in the early years of this century, bitterly and fiercely  resented the \"popish innovation and Sabbath profanation\" of a Sunday-school  for the children, which some daring and progressive parishioners proposed  to hold at the \"nooning.\" This canny Parson Whiteinch very craftily and  somewhat maliciously prolonged his morning sermons until they each occupied  three hours; thus he shortened the time between the two services to about  half an hour, and victoriously crowded out the Sunday-school innovators,  who had barely time to eat their cold lunch and care for their waiting  horses, ere it was time for the afternoon service to begin. But one man  cannot stop the tide, though he may keep it for a short time from one  guarded and sheltered spot; and the rebellious Vermont congregation, after  two or three years of tedious three-hour sermons, arose in a body and  crowded out the purposely prolix preacher, and established the wished-for  Sunday-school. The vanquished parson thereafter sullenly spent the noonings  in the horse-shed, to which he ostentatiously carried the big church-Bible  in order that it might not be at the service of the profaning teachers.    An irreverent caricature of the colonial days represents a phenomenally  long-preaching clergyman as turning the hour-glass by the side of his  pulpit and addressing his congregation thus, \"Come! you are all good  fellows, we'll take another glass together!\" It is recorded of Rev. Urian  Oakes that often the hour-glass was turned four times during one of his  sermons. The warning legend, \"Be Short,\" which Cotton Mather inscribed over  his study door was not written over his pulpit; for he wrote in his diary  that at his own ordination he prayed for an hour and a quarter, and  preached for an hour and three quarters. Added to the other ordination  exercises these long Mather addresses must have been tiresome enough.  Nathaniel Ward deplored at that time, \"Wee have a strong weakness in New  England that when wee are speaking, wee know not how to conclude: wee make  many ends before wee make an end.\"    Dr. Lord of Norwich always made a prayer which was one hour long; and an  early Dutch traveller who visited New England asserted that he had heard  there on Fast Day a prayer which was two hours long. These long prayers  were universal and most highly esteemed,--a \"poor gift in prayer\" being a  most deplored and even despised clerical short-coming. Had not the Puritans  left the Church of England to escape \"stinted prayers\"? Whitefield prayed  openly for Parson Barrett of Hopkinton, who could pray neither freely, nor  well, that \"God would open this dumb dog's mouth;\" and everywhere in the  Puritan Church, precatory eloquence as evinced in long prayers was felt to  be the greatest glory of the minister, and the highest tribute to God.    In nearly all the churches the assembled people stood during prayer-time  (since kneeling and bowing the head savored of Romish idolatry) and in the  middle of his petition the minister usually made a long pause in order that  any who were infirm or ill might let down their slamming pew-seats and sit  down; those who were merely weary stood patiently to the long and painfully  deferred end. This custom of standing during prayer-time prevailed in the  Congregational churches in New England until quite a recent date, and is  not yet obsolete in isolated communities and in solitary cases. I have seen  within a few years, in a country church, a feeble, white-haired old deacon  rise tremblingly at the preacher's solemn words \"Let us unite in prayer,\"  and stand with bowed head throughout the long prayer; thus pathetically  clinging to the reverent custom of the olden time, he rendered tender  tribute to vanished youth, gave equal tribute to eternal hope and faith,  and formed a beautiful emblem of patient readiness for the last solemn  summons.    Sometimes tedious expounding of the Scriptures and long \"prophesying\"  lengthened out the already too long service. Judge Sewall recorded that  once when he addressed or expounded at the Plymouth Church, \"being afraid  to look at the glass, ignorantly and unwittingly I stood two hours and a  half,\" which was doing pretty well for a layman.    The members of the early churches did not dislike these long preachings and  prophesyings; they would have regarded a short sermon as irreligious,  and lacking in reverence, and besides, would have felt that they had not  received in it their full due, their full money's worth. They often fell  asleep and were fiercely awakened by the tithingman, and often they could  not have understood the verbose and grandiose language of the preacher.  They were in an icy-cold atmosphere in winter, and in glaring, unshaded  heat in summer, and upon most uncomfortable, narrow, uncushioned seats at  all seasons; but in every record and journal which I have read, throughout  which ministers and laymen recorded all the annoyances and opposition which  the preachers encountered, I have never seen one entry of any complaint or  ill-criticism of too long praying or preaching. Indeed, when Rev. Samuel  Torrey, of Weymouth, Massachusetts, prayed two hours without stopping, upon  a public Fast Day in 1696, it is recorded that his audience only wished  that the prayer had been much longer.    When we consider the training and exercise in prayer that the New England  parsons had in their pulpits on Sundays, in their own homes on Saturday  nights, on Lecture Days and Fast Days and Training Days, and indeed upon  all times and occasions, can we wonder at Parson Boardman's prowess in New  Milford in 1735? He visited a \"praying\" Indian's home wherein lay a sick  papoose over whom a \"pow-wow\" was being held by a medicine-man at the  request of the squaw-mother, who was still a heathen. The Christian warrior  determined to fight the Indian witch-doctor on his own grounds, and while  the medicine-man was screaming and yelling and dancing in order to cast the  devil out ol the child, the parson began to pray with equal vigor and power  of lungs to cast out the devil of a medicine-man. As the prayer and  pow-wow proceeded the neighboring Indians gathered around, and soon became  seriously alarmed for the success of their prophet. The battle raged for  three hours, when the pow-wow ended, and the disgusted and exhausted Indian  ran out of the wigwam and jumped into the Housatonic River to cool his  heated blood, leaving the Puritan minister triumphant in the belief, and  indeed with positive proof, that he could pray down any man or devil.    The colonists could not leave the meeting-house before the long sen ices  were ended, even had they wished, for the tithingman allowed no deserters.  In Salem, in 1676, it was \"ordered by ye Selectmen yt the three Constables  doe attend att ye three greate doores of ye meeting-house every Lordes Day  att ye end of ye sermon, both forenoone and afternoone, and to keep ye  doores fast and suffer none to goe out before ye whole exercises bee  ended.\" Thus Salem people had to listen to no end of praying and  prophesying from their ministers and elders for they \"couldn't get out.\"    As the years passed on, the church attendants became less referential and  much more impatient and fearless, and soon after the Revolutionary War one  man in Medford made a bargain with his minister--Rev. Dr. Osgood--that he  would attend regularly the"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/8694"],[0,"The Abbot's Ghost, or Maurice Treherne's Temptation: A Christmas Story (#12)"],[1," do long ago?\" he asked, after a  moment's thought.    \"I told you so! There it is, just what we want.\" And Sir Jasper looked  triumphant.    \"It's capital--let us begin at once. It is after ten now, so we shall  not have long to wait,\" cried Rose, and, taking Sir Jasper's arm, she  led the way to the hall.    A great fire always burned there, and in wintertime thick carpets  and curtains covered the stone floor and draped the tall windows.  Plants blossomed in the warm atmosphere, and chairs and lounges  stood about invitingly. The party was soon seated, and Treherne was  desired to begin.    \"We must have ghost stories, and in order to be properly thrilling and  effective, the lights must be put out,\" said Rose, who sat next him, and  spoke first, as usual.    This was soon done, and only a ruddy circle of firelight was left to  oppose the rapt gloom that filled the hall, where shadows now seemed to  lurk in every corner.    \"Don't be very dreadful, or I shall faint away,\" pleaded Blanche,  drawing nearer to Annon, for she had taken her sister's advice, and laid  close siege to that gentleman's heart.    \"I think your nerves will bear my little tale,\" replied Treherne.  \"When I was in India, four years ago, I had a very dear friend in my  regiment--a Scotchman; I'm half Scotch myself, you know, and clannish,  of course. Gordon was sent up the country on a scouting expedition,  and never returned. His men reported that he left them one evening to  take a survey, and his horse came home bloody and riderless. We  searched, but could not find a trace of him, and I was desperate to  discover and avenge his murder. About a month after his disappearance,  as I sat in my tent one fearfully hot day, suddenly the canvas door  flap was raised and there stood Gordon. I saw him as plainly as I see  you, Jasper, and should have sprung to meet him, but something held me  back. He was deathly pale, dripping with water, and in his bonny blue  eyes was a wild, woeful look that made my blood run cold. I stared  dumbly, for it was awful to see my friend so changed and so unearthly.  Stretching his arm to me he took my hand, saying solemnly, 'Come!' The  touch was like ice; an ominous thrill ran through me; I started up to  obey, and he was gone.\"    \"A horrid dream, of course. Is that all?\" asked Rose.    With his eyes on the fire and his left hand half extended, Treherne went  on as if he had not heard her.    \"I thought it was a fancy, and soon recovered myself, for no one had  seen or heard anything of Gordon, and my native servant lay just outside  my tent. A strange sensation remained in the hand the phantom touched.  It was cold, damp, and white. I found it vain to try to forget this  apparition; it took strong hold of me; I told Yermid, my man, and he  bade me consider it a sign that I was to seek my friend. That night I  dreamed I was riding up the country in hot haste; what led me I know  not, but I pressed on and on, longing to reach the end. A half-dried  river crossed my path, and, riding down the steep bank to ford it, I saw  Gordon's body lying in the shallow water looking exactly as the vision  looked. I woke in a strange mood, told the story to my commanding  officer, and, as nothing was doing just then, easily got leave of  absence for a week. Taking Yermid, I set out on my sad quest. I thought  it folly, but I could not resist the impulse that drew me on. For seven  days I searched, and the strangest part of the story is that all that  time I went on exactly as in the dream, seeing what I saw then, and led  by the touch of a cold hand on mine. On the seventh day I reached the  river, and found my friend's body.\"    \"How horrible! Is it really true?\" cried Mrs. Snowdon.    \"As true as I am a living man. Nor is that all: this left hand of mine  never has been warm since that time. See and feel for yourselves.\"    He opened both hands, and all satisfied themselves that the left was  smaller, paler, and colder than the right.    \"Pray someone tell another story to put this out of my mind; it makes me  nervous,\" said Blanche.    \"I'll tell one, and you may laugh to quiet your nerves. I want to have  mine done with, so that I can enjoy the rest with a free mind.\" With  these words Rose began her tale in the good old fashion.    \"Once upon a time, when we were paying a visit to my blessed grandmamma,  I saw a ghost in this wise: The dear old lady was ill with a cold and  kept her room, leaving us to mope, for it was very dull in the great  lonely house. Blanche and I were both homesick, but didn't like to leave  till she was better, so we ransacked the library and solaced ourselves  with all manner of queer books. One day I found Grandmamma very low and  nervous, and evidently with something on her mind. She would say  nothing, but the next day was worse, and I insisted on knowing the  cause, for the trouble was evidently mental. Charging me to keep it from  Blanche, who was, and is, a sad coward, she told me that a spirit had  appeared to her two successive nights. 'If it comes a third time, I  shall prepare to die,' said the foolish old lady.    \"'No, you won't, for I'll come and stay with you and lay your ghost,' I  said. With some difficulty I made her yield, and after Blanche was  asleep I slipped away to Grandmamma, with a book and candle for a long  watch, as the spirit didn't appear till after midnight. She usually  slept with her door unlocked, in case of fire or fright, and her maid  was close by. That night I locked the door, telling her that spirits  could come through the oak if they chose, and I preferred to have a fair  trial. Well, I read and chatted and dozed till dawn and nothing  appeared, so I laughed at the whole affair, and the old lady pretended  to be convinced that it was all a fancy.    \"Next night I slept in my own room, and in the morning was told that not  only Grandmamma but Janet had seen the spirit. All in white, with  streaming hair, a pale face, and a red streak at the throat. It came and  parted the bed-curtains, looking in a moment, and then vanished. Janet  had slept with Grandmamma and kept a lamp burning on the chimney, so  both saw it.    \"I was puzzled, but not frightened; I never am, and I insisted on trying  again. The door was left unlocked, as on the previous night, and I lay  with Grandmamma, a light burning as before. About two she clutched me as  I was dropping off. I looked, and there, peeping in between the dark  curtains, was a pale face with long hair all about it, and a red streak  at the throat. It was very dim, the light being low, but I saw it, and  after one breathless minute sprang up, caught my foot, fell down with a  crash, and by the time I was around the bed, not a vestige of the thing  appeared. I was angry, and vowed I'd succeed at all hazards, though I'll  confess I was just a bit daunted.    \"Next time Janet and I sat up in easy chairs, with bright lights  burning, and both wide awake with the strongest coffee we could make. As  the hour drew near we got nervous, and when the white shape came gliding  in Janet hid her face. I didn't, and after one look was on the point of  laughing, for the spirit was Blanche walking in her sleep. She wore a  coral necklace in those days, and never took it off, and her long hair  half hid her face, which had the unnatural, uncanny look somnambulists  always wear. I had the sense to keep still and tell Janet what to do, so  the poor child went back unwaked, and Grandmamma's spirit never walked  again for I took care of that.\"    \"Why did you haunt the old lady?\" asked Annon, as the laughter ceased.    \"I don't know, unless it was that I wanted to ask leave to go home, and  was afraid to do it awake, so tried when asleep. I shall not tell any  story, as I was the heroine of this, but will give my turn to you, Mr.  Annon,\" said Blanche, with a soft glance, which was quite thrown away,  for the gentleman's eyes were fixed on Octavia, who sat on a low ottoman  at Mrs. Snowdon's feet in the full glow of the firelight.    \"I've had very small experience in ghosts, and can only recall a little  fright I once had when a boy at college. I'd been out to a party, got  home tired, couldn't find my matches, and retired in the dark. Toward  morning I woke, and glancing up to see if the dim light was dawn or  moonshine I was horrified to see a coffin standing at the bed's foot. I  rubbed my eyes to be sure I was awake, and looked with all my might.  There it was, a long black coffin, and I saw the white plate in the  dusk, for the moon was setting and my curtain was not drawn. 'It's some  trick of the fellows,' I thought; 'I'll not betray myself, but keep  cool.' Easy to say but hard to do, for it suddenly flashed into my mind  that I might be in the wrong room. I glanced about, but there were the  familiar objects as usual, as far as the indistinct light allowed me to  see, and I made sure by feeling on the wall at the bed's head for my  watchcase. It was there, and mine beyond a doubt, being peculiar in  shape and fabric. Had I been to a college wine party I could have  accounted for the vision, but a quiet evening in a grave professor's  well-conducted family could produce no ill effects. 'It's an optical  illusion, or a prank of my mates; I'll sleep and forget it,' I said, and  for a time endeavored to do so, but curiosity overcame my resolve, and  soon I peeped again. Judge of my horror when I saw the sharp white  outline of a dead face, which seemed to be peeping up from the coffin.  It gave me a terrible shock for I was but a lad and had been ill. I hid  my face and quaked like a nervous girl, still thinking it some joke and  too proud to betray fear lest I should be laughed at. How long I lay  there I don't know, but when I looked again the face was farther out and  the whole figure seemed rising slowly. The moon was nearly down, I had  no lamp, and to be left in the dark with that awesome thing was more  than I could bear."]]]
