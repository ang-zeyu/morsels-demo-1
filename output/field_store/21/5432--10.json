[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/1298"],[0,"The Virginian: A Horseman of the Plains (#13)"],[1,"joining Em'ly in  her horrid surprise, when I saw how it all was. The Virginian had taken  an egg from a hen which had already been sitting for three weeks.    I dressed in haste, hearing Em'ly's distracted outcry. It steadily  sounded, without perceptible pause for breath, and marked her erratic  journey back and forth through stables, lanes, and corrals. The shrill  disturbance brought all of us out to see her, and in the hen-house I  discovered the new brood making its appearance punctually.    But this natural explanation could not be made to the crazed hen. She  continued to scour the premises, her slant tail and its one preposterous  feather waving as she aimlessly went, her stout legs stepping high with  an unnatural motion, her head lifted nearly off her neck, and in  her brilliant yellow eye an expression of more than outrage at  this overturning of a natural law. Behind her, entirely ignored and  neglected, trailed the little progeny. She never looked at it. We went  about our various affairs, and all through the clear, sunny day that  unending metallic scream pervaded the premises. The Virginian put out  food and water for her, but she tasted nothing. I am glad to say that  the little chicken did. I do not think that the hen's eyes could see,  except in the way that sleep-walkers' do.    The heat went out of the air, and in the canyon the violet light began  to show. Many hours had gone, but Em'ly never ceased. Now she suddenly  flew up in a tree and sat there with her noise still going; but it had  risen lately several notes into a slim, acute level of terror, and was  not like machinery any more, nor like any sound I ever heard before or  since. Below the tree stood the bewildered little chicken, cheeping, and  making tiny jumps to reach its mother.    \"Yes,\" said the Virginian, \"it's comical. Even her aigg acted different  from anybody else's.\" He paused, and looked across the wide, mellowing  plain with the expression of easy-going gravity so common with him. Then  he looked at Em'ly in the tree and the yellow chicken.    \"It ain't so damned funny,\" said he.    We went in to supper, and I came out to find the hen lying on the  ground, dead. I took the chicken to the family in the hen-house.    No, it was not altogether funny any more. And I did not think less of  the Virginian when I came upon him surreptitiously digging a little hole  in the field for her.    \"I have buried some citizens here and there,\" said he, \"that I have  respected less.\"    And when the time came for me to leave Sunk Creek, my last word to the  Virginian was, \"Don't forget Em'ly.\"    \"I ain't likely to,\" responded the cow-puncher. \"She is just one o' them  parables.\"    Save when he fell into his native idioms (which, they told me, his  wanderings had well-nigh obliterated until that year's visit to his home  again revived them in his speech), he had now for a long while dropped  the \"seh,\" and all other barriers between us. We were thorough friends,  and had exchanged many confidences both of the flesh and of the spirit.  He even went the length of saying that he would write me the Sunk Creek  news if I would send him a line now and then. I have many letters from  him now. Their spelling came to be faultless, and in the beginning was  little worse than George Washington's.    The Judge himself drove me to the railroad by another way--across the  Bow Leg Mountains, and south through Balaam's Ranch and Drybone to Rock  Creek.    \"I'll be very homesick,\" I told him.    \"Come and pull the latch-string whenever you please,\" he bade me. I  wished that I might! No lotus land ever cast its spell upon man's heart  more than Wyoming had enchanted mine.          VII. THROUGH TWO SNOWS      \"Dear Friend [thus in the spring the Virginian wrote me], Yours  received. It must be a poor thing to be sick. That time I was shot at  Canada de Oro would have made me sick if it had been a littel lower or  if I was much of a drinking man. You will be well if you give over city  life and take a hunt with me about August or say September for then the  elk will be out of the velvett.    \"Things do not please me here just now and I am going to settel it  by vamosing. But I would be glad to see you. It would be pleasure not  business for me to show you plenty elk and get you strong. I am not  crybabying to the Judge or making any kick about things. He will want  me back after he has swallowed a litter tincture of time. It is the best  dose I know.    \"Now to answer your questions. Yes the Emmily hen might have ate loco  weed if hens do. I never saw anything but stock and horses get poisoned  with loco weed. No the school is not built yet. They are always big  talkers on Bear Creek. No I have not seen Steve. He is around but I  am sorry for him. Yes I have been to Medicine Bow. I had the welcom I  wanted. Do you remember a man I played poker and he did not like it? He  is working on the upper ranch near Ten Sleep. He does not amount to a  thing except with weaklings. Uncle Hewie has twins. The boys got him  vexed some about it, but I think they are his. Now that is all I know  to-day and I would like to see you poco presently as they say at Los  Cruces. There's no sense in you being sick.\"    The rest of this letter discussed the best meeting point for us should I  decide to join him for a hunt.    That hunt was made, and during the weeks of its duration something was  said to explain a little more fully the Virginian's difficulty at the  Sunk Creek Ranch, and his reason for leaving his excellent employer the  Judge. Not much was said, to be sure; the Virginian seldom spent many  words upon his own troubles. But it appeared that owing to some jealousy  of him on the part of the foreman, or the assistant foreman, he found  himself continually doing another man's work, but under circumstances so  skilfully arranged that he got neither credit nor pay for it. He would  not stoop to telling tales out of school. Therefore his ready and  prophetic mind devised the simple expedient of going away altogether.  He calculated that Judge Henry would gradually perceive there was a  connection between his departure and the cessation of the satisfactory  work. After a judicious interval it was his plan to appear again in the  neighborhood of Sunk Creek and await results.    Concerning Steve he would say no more than he had written. But it was  plain that for some cause this friendship had ceased.    Money for his services during the hunt he positively declined to accept,  asserting that he had not worked enough to earn his board. And the  expedition ended in an untravelled corner of the Yellowstone Park,  near Pitchstone Canyon, where he and young Lin McLean and others  were witnesses of a sad and terrible drama that has been elsewhere  chronicled.    His prophetic mind had foreseen correctly the shape of events at Sunk  Creek. The only thing that it had not foreseen was the impression to be  made upon the Judge's mind by his conduct.    Toward the close of that winter, Judge and Mrs. Henry visited the East.  Through them a number of things became revealed. The Virginian was back  at Sunk Creek.    \"And,\" said Mrs. Henry, \"he would never have left you if I had had my  way, Judge H.!\"    \"No, Madam Judge,\" retorted her husband; \"I am aware of that. For you  have always appreciated a fine appearance in a man.\"    \"I certainly have,\" confessed the lady, mirthfully. \"And the way he  used to come bringing my horse, with the ridges of his black hair so  carefully brushed and that blue spotted handkerchief tied so effectively  round his throat, was something that I missed a great deal after he went  away.\"    \"Thank you, my dear, for this warning. I have plans that will keep him  absent quite constantly for the future.\"    And then they spoke less flightily. \"I always knew,\" said the lady,  \"that you had found a treasure when that man came.\"    The Judge laughed. \"When it dawned on me,\" he said, \"how cleverly he  caused me to learn the value of his services by depriving me of them, I  doubted whether it was safe to take him back.\"    \"Safe!\" cried Mrs. Henry.    \"Safe, my dear. Because I'm afraid he is pretty nearly as shrewd as I  am. And that's rather dangerous in a subordinate.\" The Judge laughed  again. \"But his action regarding the man they call Steve has made me  feel easy.\"    And then it came out that the Virginian was supposed to have discovered  in some way that Steve had fallen from the grace of that particular  honesty which respects another man's cattle. It was not known for  certain. But calves had begun to disappear in Cattle Land, and cows had  been found killed. And calves with one brand upon them had been found  with mothers that bore the brand of another owner. This industry was  taking root in Cattle Land, and of those who practised it, some were  beginning to be suspected. Steve was not quite fully suspected yet. But  that the Virginian had parted company with him was definitely known. And  neither man would talk about it.    There was the further news that the Bear Creek schoolhouse at length  stood complete, floor, walls, and roof; and that a lady from Bennington,  Vermont, a friend of Mrs. Balaam's, had quite suddenly decided that she  would try her hand at instructing the new generation.    The Judge and Mrs. Henry knew this because Mrs. Balaam had told them  of her disappointment that she would be absent from the ranch on Butte  Creek when her friend arrived, and therefore unable to entertain her.  The friend's decision had been quite suddenly made, and must form the  subject of the next chapter.          VIII. THE SINCERE SPINSTER      I do not know with which of the two estimates--Mr. Taylor's or the  Virginian's--you agreed. Did you think that Miss Mary Stark Wood of  Bennington, Vermont, was forty years of age? That would have been an  error. At the time she wrote the letter to Mrs. Balaam, of which  letter certain portions have been"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/12982"],[0,"International Weekly Miscellany of Literature, Art and Science — Volume 1, No. (#13)"],[1,"constrained; his heart was  heavy within him; and ever and anon the source whence all this  disappointment and woe had sprung would recur to his perplexed,  tortured mind.    Thus mutually pained and distrustful, they returned to Paris, which  they reached about nine o'clock. In spite of her depression, Natalie,  who had not seen her new apartments, felt some curiosity about them,  whilst De Chaulieu anticipated a triumph in exhibiting the elegant  home he had prepared for her. With some alacrity, therefore, they  stepped out of the carriage, the gates of the Hotel were thrown open,  the concierge rang the bell which announced to the servants that their  master and mistress had arrived, and whilst these domestics appeared  above, holding lights over the balusters, Natalie, followed by her  husband, ascended the stairs. But when they reached the landing-place  of the first flight, they saw the figure of a man standing in a corner  as if to make way for them; the flash from above fell upon his face,  and again Antoine de Chaulieu recognized the features of Jacques  Rollet!    From the circumstance of his wife's preceding him, the figure was  not observed by De Chaulieu till he was lifting his foot to place it  on the top stair; the sudden shock caused him to miss the step, and,  without uttering a sound, he fell back, and never stopped till he  reached the stories at the bottom. The screams of Natalie brought the  concierge from below and the maids from above, and an attempt was  made to raise the unfortunate man from the ground; but with cries of  anguish he besought them to desist.    \"Let me,\" he said, \"die here! What a fearful vengeance is thine! Oh,  Natalie, Natalie!\" he exclaimed to his wife, who was kneeling beside  him, \"to win fame, and fortune, and yourself, I committed a dreadful  crime! With lying words I argued away the life of a fellow-creature,  whom, whilst I uttered them, I half believed to be innocent: and  now, when I have attained all I desired, and reached the summit of  my hopes, the Almighty has sent him back upon the earth to blast me  with the sight. Three times this day--three times this day! Again!  again!\"--and as he spoke, his wild and dilated eyes fixed themselves  on one of the individuals that surrounded him.    \"He is delirious,\" said they.    \"No,\" said the stranger! \"What he says is true enough,--at least  in part;\" and bending over the expiring man, he added, \"May Heaven  forgive you, Antoine de Chaulieu! I was not executed; one who well  knew my innocence saved my life. I may name him, for he is beyond  the reach of the law now,--it was Claperon, the jailer, who loved  Claudine, and had himself killed Alphonse de Bellefonds from jealousy.  An unfortunate wretch had been several years in the jail for a murder  committed during the frenzy of a fit of insanity. Long confinement  had reduced him to idiocy. To save my life Claperon substituted the  senseless being for me, on the scaffold, and he was executed in my  stead. He has quitted the country, and I have been a vagabond on the  face of the earth ever since that time. At length I obtained, through  the assistance of my sister, the situation of concierge in the Hotel  Marboeuf, in the Rue Grange Bateliere. I entered on my new place  yesterday evening, and was desired to awaken the gentleman on the  third floor at seven o'clock. When I entered the room to do so,  you were asleep, but before I had time to speak you awoke, and I  recognized your features in the glass. Knowing that I could not  vindicate my innocence if you chose to seize me, I fled, and seeing  an omnibus starting for St. Denis, I got on it with a vague idea of  getting on to Calais, and crossing the Channel to England. But having  only a franc or two in my pocket, or indeed in the world, I did not  know how to procure the means of going forward; and whilst I was  lounging about the place, forming first one plan and then another,  I saw you in the church, and concluding you wore in pursuit of me, I  thought the best way of eluding your vigilance was to make my way back  to Paris as fast as I could; so I set off instantly, and walked all  the way; but having no money to pay my night's lodging, I came here  to borrow a couple of livres of my sister Claudine, who lives in the  fifth story.\"    \"Thank Heaven!\" exclaimed the dying man; \"that sin is off my soul!  Natalie, dear wife, farewell! Forgive! forgive all!\"    These were the last words he uttered; the priest, who had been  summoned in haste, held up the cross before his failing sight; a few  strong convulsions shook the poor bruised and mangled frame; and then  all was still.    And thus ended the Young Advocate's Wedding Day.           *       *       *       *       *    [FROM DICKENS'S HOUSEHOLD WORDS FOR JUNE 29.]    THE POWER OF MERCY.    Quiet enough, in general, is the quaint old town of Lamborough. Why  all this bustle to-day? Along the hedge-bound roads which lead to it,  carts, chaises, vehicles of every description are jogging along filled  with countrymen; and here and there the scarlet cloak or straw bonnet  of some female occupying a chair, placed somewhat unsteadily behind  them, contrasts gaily with the dark coats, or gray smock-frocks of the  front row; from every cottage of the suburb, some individuals join the  stream, which rolls on increasing through the streets till it reaches  the castle. The ancient moat teems with idlers, and the hill opposite,  usually the quiet domain of a score or two of peaceful sheep, partakes  of the surrounding agitation.    The voice of the multitude which surrounds the court-house, sounds  like the murmur of the sea, till suddenly it is raised to a sort  of shout. John West, the terror of the surrounding country, the  sheep-stealer and burglar, had been found guilty.    \"What is the sentence?\" is asked by a hundred voices.    The answer is \"Transportation for Life.\"    But there was one standing aloof on the hill, whose inquiring eye  wandered over the crowd with indescribable anguish, whose pallid cheek  grew more and more ghastly at every denunciation of the culprit, and  who, when at last the sentence was pronounced, fell insensible upon  the green-sward. It was the burglar's son.    When the boy recovered from his swoon, it was late in the afternoon;  he was alone; the faint tinkling of the sheep-bell had again replaced  the sound of the human chorus of expectation, and dread, and jesting;  all was peaceful, he could not understand why he lay there, feeling  so weak and sick. He raised himself tremulously and looked around, the  turf was cut and spoilt by the trampling of many feet. All his life  of the last few months floated before his memory, his residence in  his father's hovel with ruffianly comrades, the desperate schemes he  heard as he pretended to sleep on his lowly bed, their expeditions at  night, masked and armed, their hasty returns, the news of his father's  capture, his own removal to the house of some female in the town, the  court, the trial, the condemnation.    The father had been a harsh and brutal parent, but he had not  positively ill-used his boy. Of the Great and Merciful Father of the  fatherless the child knew nothing. He deemed himself alone in the  world. Yet grief was not his pervading feeling, nor the shame, of  being known as the son of a transport. It was revenge which burned  within him. He thought of the crowd which had come to feast upon  his father's agony; he longed to tear them to pieces, and he plucked  savagely a handful of the grass on which he leant. Oh, that he were  a man! that he could punish them all--all,--the spectators first  the constables, the judge, the jury, the witnesses,--one of them  especially, a clergyman named Leyton, who had given his evidence more  positively, more clearly, than all the others. Oh, that he could do  that man some injury,--but for him his father would not have been  identified and convicted.    Suddenly a thought occurred to him,--his eyes sparkled with fierce  delight. \"I know where he lives,\" he said to himself; \"he has the farm  and parsonage of Millwood. I will go there at once,--it is almost  dark already. I will do as I have heard father say he once did to the  Squire. I will set his barns and his house on fire. Yes, yes, he shall  burn for it,--he shall get no more fathers transported.\"    To procure a box of matches was an easy task, and that was all the  preparation the boy made.    The autumn was far advanced. A cold wind was beginning to moan amongst  the almost leafless trees, and George West's teeth chattered, and  his ill-clad limbs grew numb as he walked along the fields leading to  Millwood. \"Lucky it's a dark night; this fine wind will fan the flame  nicely,\" he repeated to himself.    The clock was striking nine, but all was quiet as midnight; not a soul  stirring, not a light in the parsonage windows that he could see. He  dared not open the gate, lest the click of the latch should betray  him, so he softly climbed over; but scarcely had he dropped on the  other side of the wall before the loud barking of a dog startled  him. He cowered down behind the hay-rick, scarcely daring to breathe,  expecting each instant that the dog would spring upon him. It was  some time before the boy dared to stir, and as his courage cooled,  his thirst for revenge somewhat subsided also, till he almost  determined to return to Lamborough; but he was too tired, too cold,  too hungry,--besides, the woman would beat him for staying out so  late. What could he do? where should he go? and as the sense of his  lonely and forlorn position returned, so did also the affectionate  remembrance of his father, his hatred of his accusers, his desire to  satisfy his vengeance; and, once more, courageous through anger, he  rose, took the box from his pocket, and boldly drew one of them across  the sand-paper. It flamed; he stuck it hastily in the stack against  which he rested,--it only "]]]
