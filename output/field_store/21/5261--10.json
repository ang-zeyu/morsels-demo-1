[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/8115"],[0,"Authors of Greece (#12)"],[1,"Agamemnon and Menelaus, who married respectively  Clytemnestra and Helen, daughters of Zeus and Leda, both evil women;  the son of Thyestes was Aegisthus, a deadly foe of his cousins who had  banished him. The \"inherited curse\" then had developed itself in this  unhappy stock and it did not fail to ruin it.    When Helen abandoned Menelaus and went to Troy with Paris, Agamemnon led  a great armament to recover the adulteress. The fleet was wind-bound  at Aulis, because the Greeks had offended Artemis. Chalcas the seer  informed Agamemnon that it would be impossible for him to reach Troy  unless he offered his eldest daughter Iphigeneia to Artemis. Torn by  patriotism and fatherly affection, Agamemnon resorted to a strategem to  bring his daughter to the sacrifice. He sent a messenger to Clytemnestra  saying he wished to marry their child to Achilles. When the mother and  daughter arrived at Aulis they learned the bitter truth. Iphigeneia  was indeed sacrificed, but Artemis spirited her away to the country  now called Crimea, there to serve as her priestess. Believing that her  daughter was dead, Clytemnestra returned to Argos to plot destruction  for her husband, forming an illicit union with his foe Aegisthus,  nursing her revenge during the ten years of the siege.    The _Agamemnon_, the first play of the trilogy, opens in a romantic  setting. It is night. A watchman is on the wall of Argos, stationed  there by the Queen. For ten years he had waited for the signal of the  beacon-fire to be lit at Nauplia, the port of Argos, to announce the  fall of Troy. At last the expected signal is given. He hurries to tell  the news to the Queen, a woman with the resolution of a man; in his  absence the Chorus of Argive Elders enter the stage, singing one of the  finest odes to be found in any language. It likens Agamemnon and his  brother to two avenging spirits sent to punish the sinner. The Chorus  are past military age, and are come to learn from Clytemnestra why  there is sacrifice throughout all Argos. They remember the woes at the  beginning of the campaign, how Chalcas prophesied that in time Troy  would be taken, yet hinted darkly of some blinding curse of Heaven  hanging over the Greeks, his burden being        \"Sing woe, sing woe, but let the good prevail.\"        \"Yea, the law of Zeus is, wisdom by suffering, for thus soberness of      thought comes to those who wish not for it. First men are emboldened      by ill-counselling foolish frenzy which begins their troubles; even      as Agamemnon, through sin against Artemis, was compelled to slay his      daughter to save his armament. Her cries for a father's mercy, her      unuttered appeals to her slayers--these he disregarded. What is to      come of it, no man knows; yet it is useless to lament the issue before      it comes, as come it will, clear as the light of day.\"    Clytemnestra enters, the sternest woman figure in all literature. She  reminds the Chorus that she is no child and is not known to have a  slumbering wit. When they enquire how she has learned so quickly of the  capture of Troy, she describes with great brilliance the long chain of  beacon fires she has caused to be made, stretching from Ida in Troyland  to Argos. She imagines the wretched fate of the conquered and the joy  of the victors, rid for ever of their watchings beneath the open sky.  Striking the same ominous note as Chalcas did, she continues:        \"If they reverence the Gods of Troy and their shrines, they shall not      be caught even as they have taken the city. May no lust of plundering      fall upon the army, for it needs a safe return home. Yet even if the      army sins not against the gods, the anger of the slain may awake,      though no new ills arise. But let the right prevail, for all to see      it clearly.\"    This speech inspires the Chorus to sing another solemn ode. Too much  prosperity leads to godlessness; Paris carried away Helen in pride and  infatuation, stealing the light of Menelaus' eyes, leaving him only the  torturing memories of her beauty which visited him in his dreams. But  there is a spirit of discontent in every city of Greece; all had sent  their young men to Troy in the glory of life, and in return they had a  handful of ashes, asking why their sons should fall in murderous strife  for another man's wife. At night the dark dread haunts Argos that the  gods care not for men who shed much blood, who succeed by injustice, who  are well spoken of overmuch. Often these are smitten full in the face by  the thunderbolt; and perhaps this beacon message is mere imagining or a  lie sent from heaven.    Hearing this the Queen comes forth to prove the truth of her story. A  herald at that moment advances to confirm it, for Troy has been sacked.        \"Altars and shrines have been demolished and all the seed of land      destroyed. Thus is Agamemnon the happiest man of mortals, most      worthy of honour, for Paris and his city cannot say that their      crime was greater than its punishment.\"    Immediately after learning this story, Clytemnestra makes the first of a  number of speeches charged with a dreadful double meaning.        \"When the first news came, I shouted for joy, but now I shall hear      the story from the King himself. And I will use all diligence to      give my lord the best of all possible welcomes. Bid him come with      speed. May he find in the house a wife as faithful as he left her!      I know of no wanton pleasure with another man more than I know how      to dye a sword.\"    The Chorus understand well the hidden force of this sinister speech and  bid the messenger speak of Menelaus, the other beloved King of the land.  In reply he tells how a dreadful storm sent by the angry gods descended  upon the Greek fleet. In it fire and water, those ancient foes, forsook  their feud, conspiring to destroy the unhappy armament. Whether Menelaus  was alive or not was uncertain; if he lived, it was only by the will of  Zeus who desired to save the royal house. The Chorus who look at things  with a deeper glance than the herald, hear his story with a growing  uneasiness.        \"Helen, the cause of the war, at first was a spirit ofcalm to Troy,      but at the latter end she was their bane, the evil angel of ruin.      For one act of violence begets many others like it, until      righteousness can no longer dwell within the sinner.\"    They touch a more joyous chord of welcome and loyalty when at last they  see the actual arrival of Agamemnon himself.    The King enters the stage accompanied by Cassandra, the prophetic  daughter of Priam, thus giving visible proof of his contempt for Apollo,  the Trojan protector and inspirer of the prophetess. He has heard  the Chorus' welcome and promises to search out the false friends and  administer healing medicine to the city. Clytemnestra replies in a  second speech of double significance.        \"The Argive Elders well know how dearly she loves her lord and the      impatience of her life while he was at Troy. Often stories came of      his wounds; were they all true, he would have more scars than a net      has holes. Orestes their son has been sent away, lest he should be      the victim of some popular uprising in the King's absence. Her fount      of tears is dried up, not a drop being left.\"    After some words of extravagant flattery, she bids her waiting women lay  down purple carpets on which Justice may bring him to a home which he  never hoped to see. Agamemnon coldly deprecates her long speech; the  honour she suggests is one for the gods alone; his fame will speak loud  enough without gaudy trappings, for a wise heart is Heaven's greatest  gift. But the Queen, not to be denied, overcomes his scruples. Giving  orders that Cassandra is to be well treated, he passes over the purple  carpets, led by Clytemnestra who avows that she would have given many  purple carpets to get him home alive. Thus arrogating to himself the  honours of a god, he proceeds within the palace, while she lingers  behind for one brief moment to pray openly to Zeus to fulfil her prayers  and to bring his will to its appointed end. Thoroughly alarmed, the  Chorus give free utterance to the vague forebodings which shake them,  the song of the avenging Furies which cries within their hearts.        \"Human prosperity often strikes a sunken rock; bloodshed calls to      Heaven for vengeance; yet there is comfort, for one destiny may      override another, and good may yet come to pass.\"    These pious hopes are broken by the entry of the Queen who summons  Cassandra within: when the captive prophetess answers her not a word,  Clytemnestra declares she has no time to waste outside the palace:  already there stands at the altar the ox ready for sacrifice, a joy she  never looked to have; if Cassandra will not obey, she must be taught to  foam out her spirit in blood.    In the marvellous scene which follows Aeschylus reaches the pinnacle  of tragic power. Cassandra advances to the palace, but starts back in  horror as a series of visions of growing vividness comes before her  eyes. These find utterance in language of blended sanity and madness,  creating a terror whose very vagueness increases its intensity. First  she sees Atreus' cruel murder of his brother's children; then follows  the sight of Clytemnestra's treacherous smile and of Agamemnon in the  bath, hand after hand reaching at him; quickly she sees the net cast  about him, the murderess' blow. In a flash she foresees her own end  and breaks out into a wild lament over the ruin of her native city. Her  words work up the Chorus into a state of confused dread and foreboding;  they can neither understand nor yet disbelieve. When their mental  confusion is at its height, relief comes in a prophecy of the greatest  clearness, no longer couched in riddling terms. The palace is peopled by  a band of kindred Furies, who have drunk their fill of human blood and"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/8129"],[0,"A Dreamer's Tales (#12)"],[1,"that city. And even as I came  a man stood up to pay his toll to the watchers. They were seated  cross-legged on the ground between him and the gate, and each one held a  spear. Near him two other travellers sat on the warm sand waiting. And the  man said:    \"Now the city of Nombros forsook the worship of the gods and turned  towards God. So the gods threw their cloaks over their faces and strode  away from the city, and going into the haze among the hills passed through  the trunks of the olive groves into the sunset. But when they had already  left the Earth, they turned and looked through the gleaming folds of the  twilight for the last time at their city; and they looked half in anger  and half in regret, then turned and went away for ever. But they sent back  a Death, who bore a scythe, saying to it: 'Slay half in the city that  forsook us, but half of them spare alive that they may yet remember their  old forsaken gods.'    \"But God sent a destroying angel to show that He was God, saying unto him:  'Go into that city and slay half of the dwellers therein, yet spare a half  of them that they may know that I am God.'    \"And at once the destroying angel put his hand to his sword, and the sword  came out of the scabbard with a deep breath, like to the breath that a  broad woodman takes before his first blow at some giant oak. Thereat the  angel pointed his arms downwards, and bending his head between them, fell  forward from Heaven's edge, and the spring of his ankles shot him  downwards with his wings furled behind him. So he went slanting earthward  through the evening with his sword stretched out before him, and he was  like a javelin that some hunter hath hurled that returneth again to the  earth: but just before he touched it he lifted his head and spread his  wings with the under feathers forward, and alighted by the bank of the  broad Flavro that divides the city of Nombros. And down the bank of the  Flavro he fluttered low, like to a hawk over a new-cut cornfield when the  little creatures of the corn are shelterless, and at the same time down  the other bank the Death from the gods went mowing.    \"At once they saw each other, and the angel glared at the Death, and the  Death leered back at him, and the flames in the eyes of the angel  illumined with a red glare the mist that lay in the hollows of the sockets  of the Death. Suddenly they fell on one another, sword to scythe. And the  angel captured the temples of the gods, and set up over them the sign of  God, and the Death captured the temples of God, and led into them the  ceremonies and sacrifices of the gods; and all the while the centuries  slipped quietly by, going down the Flavro seawards.    \"And now some worship God in the temple of the gods, and others worship the  gods in the temple of God, and still the angel hath not returned again to  the rejoicing choirs, and still the Death hath not gone back to die with  the dead gods; but all through Nombros they fight up and down, and still  on each side of the Flavro the city lives.\"    And the watchers in the gate said, \"Enter in.\"    Then another traveler rose up, and said:    \"Solemnly between Huhenwazy and Nitcrana the huge grey clouds came  floating. And those great mountains, heavenly Huhenwazi and Nitcrana, the  king of peaks, greeted them, calling them brothers. And the clouds were  glad of their greeting, for they meet with companions seldom in the lonely  heights of the sky.    \"But the vapours of evening said unto the earth-mist, 'What are those  shapes that dare to move above us and to go where Nitcrana is and  Huhenwazi?'    \"And the earth-mist said in answer unto the vapours of evening, 'It is  only an earth-mist that has become mad and has left the warm and  comfortable earth, and has in his madness thought that his place is with  Huhenwazi and Nitcrana.'    \"'Once,' said the vapours of evening, 'there were clouds, but this was  many and many a day ago, as our forefathers have said. Perhaps the mad one  thinks he is the clouds.'    \"Then spake the earth-worms from the warm deeps of the mud, saying 'O  earth-mist, thou art indeed the clouds, and there are no clouds but thou.  And as for Huhenwazi and Nitcrana, I cannot see them, and therefore they  are not high, and there are no mountains in the world but those that I  cast up every morning out of the deeps of the mud.'    \"And the earth-mist and the vapours of evening were glad at the voice of  the earth-worms, and looking earthward believed what they had said.    \"And indeed it is better to be as the earth-mist, and to keep close to the  warm mud at night, and to hear the earth-worm's comfortable speech, and  not to be a wanderer in the cheerless heights, but to leave the mountains  alone with their desolate snow, to draw what comfort they can from their  vast aspect over all the cities of men, and from the whispers that they  hear at evening of unknown distant gods.\"    And the watchers in the gate said, \"Enter in.\"    Then a man stood up who came out of the west, and told a western tale. He  said:    \"There is a road in Rome that runs through an ancient temple that once the  gods had loved; it runs along the top of a great wall, and the floor of  the temple lies far down beneath it, of marble, pink and white.    \"Upon the temple floor I counted to the number of thirteen hungry cats.    \"'Sometimes,' they said among themselves, 'it was the gods that lived  here, sometimes it was men, and now it's cats. So let us enjoy the sun on  the hot marble before another people comes.'    \"For it was at that hour of a warm afternoon when my fancy is able to hear  silent voices.    \"And the awful leanness of all those thirteen cats moved me to go into a  neighbouring fish shop, and there to buy a quantity of fishes. Then I  returned and threw them all over the railing at the top of the great wall,  and they fell for thirty feet, and hit the sacred marble with a smack.    \"Now, in any other town but Rome, or in the minds of any other cats, the  sight of fishes falling out of heaven had surely excited wonder. They rose  slowly, and all stretched themselves, then they came leisurely towards the  fishes. 'It is only a miracle,' they said in their hearts.\"    And the watchers in the gate said, \"Enter in.\"    Proudly and slowly, as they spoke, drew up to them a camel, whose rider  sought entrance to the city. His face shone with the sunset by which for  long he had steered for the city's gate. Of him they demanded toll.  Whereat he spoke to his camel, and the camel roared and kneeled, and the  man descended from him. And the man unwrapped from many silks a box of  divers metals wrought by the Japanese, and on the lid of it were figures  of men who gazed from some shore at an isle of the Inland Sea. This he  showed to the watchers, and when they had seen it, said, \"It has seemed to  me that these speak to each other thus:    \"'Behold now Oojni, the dear one of the sea, the little mother sea that  hath no storms. She goeth out from Oojni singing a song, and she returneth  singing over her sands. Little is Oojni in the lap of the sea, and scarce  to be perceived by wondering ships. White sails have never wafted her  legends afar, they are told not by bearded wanderers of the sea. Her  fireside tales are known not to the North, the dragons of China have not  heard of them, nor those that ride on elephants through Ind.    \"'Men tell the tales and the smoke ariseth upwards; the smoke departeth  and the tales are told.    \"'Oojni is not a name among the nations, she is not know of where the  merchants meet, she is not spoken of by alien lips.    \"'Indeed, but Oojni is a little among the isles, yet is she loved by those  that know her coasts and her inland places hidden from the sea.    \"Without glory, without fame, and without wealth, Oojni is greatly loved  by a little people, and by a few; yet not by few, for all her dead still  love her, and oft by night come whispering through her woods. Who could  forget Oojni even among the dead?    \"For here in Oojni, wot you, are homes of men, and gardens, and golden  temples of the gods, and sacred places inshore from the sea, and many  murmurous woods. And there is a path that winds over the hills to go into  mysterious holy lands where dance by night the spirits of the woods, or  sing unseen in the sunlight; and no one goes into these holy lands, for  who that love Oojni could rob her of her mysteries, and the curious aliens  come not. Indeed, but we love Oojni though she is so little; she is the  little mother of our race, and the kindly nurse of all seafaring birds.    \"And behold, even now caressing her, the gentle fingers of the mother sea,  whose dreams are far with that old wanderer Ocean.    \"And yet let us forget not Fuzi-Yama, for he stands manifest over clouds  and sea, misty below, and vague and indistinct, but clear above for all  the isles to watch. The ships make all their journeys in his sight, the  nights and the days go by him like a wind, the summers and winters under  him flicker and fade, the lives of men pass quietly here and hence, and  Fuzi-Yama watches there--and knows.\"    And the watchers in the gate said, \"Enter in.\"    And I, too, would have told them a tale, very wonderful and very true; one  that I had told in many cities, which as yet had no believers. But now the  sun had set, and the brief twilight gone, and ghostly silences were rising  from far and darkening hills. A stillness hung over that city's gate. And  the great silence of the solemn night was more acceptable to the watchers  in the gate than any sound of man. Therefore they beckoned to us, and  motioned with their hands that we should pass untaxed into the city. And  softly we went up over the sand, and between the high rock pillars of the  gate, and a deep stillness settled among the watchers, and the stars over  them twinkled undisturbed.    For how short a while man speaks, and withal how vainly. And for how "]]]
