My worthy friend, ne'er grudge an' carp,       Tho' fortune use you hard an' sharp;       Come, kittle up your moorland harp       Wi' gleesome touch!       Ne'er mind how Fortune waft and warp;       She's but a bitch.         She 's gien me mony a jirt an' fleg,       Sin' I could striddle owre a rig;       But, by the Lord, tho' I should beg       Wi' lyart pow,       I'll laugh an' sing, an' shake my leg,       As lang's I dow!         Now comes the sax-an'-twentieth simmer       I've seen the bud upon the timmer,       Still persecuted by the limmer       Frae year to year;       But yet, despite the kittle kimmer,       I, Rob, am here.         Do ye envy the city gent,       Behint a kist to lie an' sklent;       Or pursue-proud, big wi' cent. per cent.       An' muckle wame,       In some bit brugh to represent       A bailie's name?         Or is't the paughty, feudal thane,       Wi' ruffl'd sark an' glancing cane,       Wha thinks himsel nae sheep-shank bane,       But lordly stalks;       While caps and bonnets aff are taen,       As by he walks?         \"O Thou wha gies us each guid gift!       Gie me o' wit an' sense a lift,       Then turn me, if thou please, adrift,       Thro' Scotland wide;       Wi' cits nor lairds I wadna shift,       In a' their pride!\"         Were this the charter of our state,       \"On pain o' hell be rich an' great,\"       Damnation then would be our fate,       Beyond remead;       But, thanks to heaven, that's no the gate       We learn our creed.         For thus the royal mandate ran,       When first the human race began;       \"The social, friendly, honest man,       Whate'er he be--       'Tis he fulfils great Nature's plan,       And none but he.\"         O mandate glorious and divine!       The ragged followers o' the Nine,       Poor, thoughtless devils! yet may shine       In glorious light,       While sordid sons o' Mammon's line       Are dark as night!         Tho' here they scrape, an' squeeze, an' growl,       Their worthless nievefu' of a soul       May in some future carcase howl,       The forest's fright;       Or in some day-detesting owl       May shun the light.         Then may Lapraik and Burns arise,       To reach their native, kindred skies,       And sing their pleasures, hopes an' joys,       In some mild sphere;       Still closer knit in friendship's ties,       Each passing year!          Epistle To William Simson         Schoolmaster, Ochiltree.--May, 1785         I gat your letter, winsome Willie;       Wi' gratefu' heart I thank you brawlie;       Tho' I maun say't, I wad be silly,       And unco vain,       Should I believe, my coaxin billie       Your flatterin strain.         But I'se believe ye kindly meant it:       I sud be laith to think ye hinted       Ironic satire, sidelins sklented       On my poor Musie;       Tho' in sic phraisin terms ye've penn'd it,       I scarce excuse ye.         My senses wad be in a creel,       Should I but dare a hope to speel       Wi' Allan, or wi' Gilbertfield,       The braes o' fame;       Or Fergusson, the writer-chiel,       A deathless name.         (O Fergusson! thy glorious parts       Ill suited law's dry, musty arts!       My curse upon your whunstane hearts,       Ye E'nbrugh gentry!       The tithe o' what ye waste at cartes       Wad stow'd his pantry!)         Yet when a tale comes i' my head,       Or lassies gie my heart a screed--       As whiles they're like to be my dead,       (O sad disease!)       I kittle up my rustic reed;       It gies me ease.         Auld Coila now may fidge fu' fain,       She's gotten poets o' her ain;       Chiels wha their chanters winna hain,       But tune their lays,       Till echoes a' resound again       Her weel-sung praise.         Nae poet thought her worth his while,       To set her name in measur'd style;       She lay like some unkenn'd-of-isle       Beside New Holland,       Or whare wild-meeting oceans boil       Besouth Magellan.         Ramsay an' famous Fergusson       Gied Forth an' Tay a lift aboon;       Yarrow an' Tweed, to monie a tune,       Owre Scotland rings;       While Irwin, Lugar, Ayr, an' Doon       Naebody sings.

We'll sing auld Coila's plains an' fells,       Her moors red-brown wi' heather bells,       Her banks an' braes, her dens and dells,       Whare glorious Wallace       Aft bure the gree, as story tells,       Frae Suthron billies.         At Wallace' name, what Scottish blood       But boils up in a spring-tide flood!       Oft have our fearless fathers strode       By Wallace' side,       Still pressing onward, red-wat-shod,       Or glorious died!         O, sweet are Coila's haughs an' woods,       When lintwhites chant amang the buds,       And jinkin hares, in amorous whids,       Their loves enjoy;       While thro' the braes the cushat croods       With wailfu' cry!         Ev'n winter bleak has charms to me,       When winds rave thro' the naked tree;       Or frosts on hills of Ochiltree       Are hoary gray;       Or blinding drifts wild-furious flee,       Dark'ning the day!         O Nature! a' thy shews an' forms       To feeling, pensive hearts hae charms!       Whether the summer kindly warms,       Wi' life an light;       Or winter howls, in gusty storms,       The lang, dark night!         The muse, nae poet ever fand her,       Till by himsel he learn'd to wander,       Adown some trottin burn's meander,       An' no think lang:       O sweet to stray, an' pensive ponder       A heart-felt sang!         The war'ly race may drudge an' drive,       Hog-shouther, jundie, stretch, an' strive;       Let me fair Nature's face descrive,       And I, wi' pleasure,       Shall let the busy, grumbling hive       Bum owre their treasure.         Fareweel, \"my rhyme-composing\" brither!       We've been owre lang unkenn'd to ither:       Now let us lay our heads thegither,       In love fraternal:       May envy wallop in a tether,       Black fiend, infernal!         While Highlandmen hate tools an' taxes;       While moorlan's herds like guid, fat braxies;       While terra firma, on her axis,       Diurnal turns;       Count on a friend, in faith an' practice,       In Robert Burns.          Postcript         My memory's no worth a preen;       I had amaist forgotten clean,       Ye bade me write you what they mean       By this \"new-light,\"       'Bout which our herds sae aft hae been       Maist like to fight.         In days when mankind were but callans       At grammar, logic, an' sic talents,       They took nae pains their speech to balance,       Or rules to gie;       But spak their thoughts in plain, braid lallans,       Like you or me.         In thae auld times, they thought the moon,       Just like a sark, or pair o' shoon,       Wore by degrees, till her last roon       Gaed past their viewin;       An' shortly after she was done       They gat a new ane.         This passed for certain, undisputed;       It ne'er cam i' their heads to doubt it,       Till chiels gat up an' wad confute it,       An' ca'd it wrang;       An' muckle din there was about it,       Baith loud an' lang.         Some herds, weel learn'd upo' the beuk,       Wad threap auld folk the thing misteuk;       For 'twas the auld moon turn'd a neuk       An' out of' sight,       An' backlins-comin to the leuk       She grew mair bright.         This was deny'd, it was affirm'd;       The herds and hissels were alarm'd       The rev'rend gray-beards rav'd an' storm'd,       That beardless laddies       Should think they better wer inform'd,       Than their auld daddies.         Frae less to mair, it gaed to sticks;       Frae words an' aiths to clours an' nicks;       An monie a fallow gat his licks,       Wi' hearty crunt;       An' some, to learn them for their tricks,       Were hang'd an' brunt.         This game was play'd in mony lands,       An' auld-light caddies bure sic hands,       That faith, the youngsters took the sands       Wi' nimble shanks;       Till lairds forbad, by strict commands,       Sic bluidy pranks.         But new-light herds gat sic a cowe,       Folk thought them ruin'd stick-an-stowe;       Till now, amaist on ev'ry knowe       Ye'll find ane plac'd;       An' some their new-light fair avow,       Just quite barefac'd.         Nae doubt the auld-light flocks are bleatin;       Their zealous herds are vex'd an' sweatin;       Mysel', I've even seen them greetin       Wi' girnin spite,       To hear the moon sae sadly lied on       By word an' write.         But shortly they will cowe the louns!       Some auld-light herds in neebor touns       Are mind't, in things they ca' balloons,       To tak a flight;       An' stay ae month amang the moons       An' see them right.         Guid observation they will gie them;       An' when the auld moon's gaun to lea'e them,       The hindmaist shaird, they'll fetch it wi' them       Just i' their pouch;       An' when the new-light billies see them,       I think they'll crouch!         Sae, ye observe that a' this clatter       Is naething but a \"moonshine matter\";       But tho' dull prose-folk Latin splatter       In logic tulyie,       I hope we bardies ken some better       Than mind sic brulyie.          One Night As I Did Wander         Tune--\"John Anderson, my jo.\"           One night as I did wander,       When corn begins"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/12797"],[0,"The Log of a Cowboy: A Narrative of the Old Trail Days (#13)"],[1,"to our foreman that he could  assign no other plausible excuse for the stampede than that it was the  work of cattle rustlers. He claimed to know the country along the  Colorado, and unless it had changed recently, those hills to the  westward harbored a good many of the worst rustlers in the State. He  admitted it might have been wolves chasing the range cattle, but  thought it had the earmarks of being done by human wolves. He  maintained that few herds had ever passed that river without loss of  cattle, unless the rustlers were too busy elsewhere to give the  passing herd their attention. Straw had ordered his herd to drop back  down the trail about ten miles from their camp of the night previous,  and about noon the two herds met on a branch of Brady Creek. By that  time our herd had nearly three hundred head of the Ellison cattle, so  we held it up and cut theirs out. Straw urged our foreman, whatever he  did, not to make camp in the Colorado bottoms or anywhere near the  river, if he didn't want a repetition of his experience. After  starting our herd in the afternoon, about half a dozen of us turned  back and lent a hand in counting Straw's herd, which proved to be over  a hundred head short, and nearly half his outfit were still out  hunting cattle. Acting on Straw's advice, we camped that night some  five or six miles back from the river on the last divide. From the  time the second guard went on until the third was relieved, we took  the precaution of keeping a scout outriding from a half to three  quarters of a mile distant from the herd, Flood and Honeyman serving  in that capacity. Every precaution was taken to prevent a surprise;  and in case anything did happen, our night horses tied to the wagon  wheels stood ready saddled and bridled for any emergency. But the  night passed without incident.    An hour or two after the herd had started the next morning, four well  mounted, strange men rode up from the westward, and representing  themselves as trail cutters, asked for our foreman. Flood met them, in  his usual quiet manner, and after admitting that we had been troubled  more or less with range cattle, assured our callers that if there was  anything in the herd in the brands they represented, he would gladly  hold it up and give them every opportunity to cut their cattle out. As  he was anxious to cross the river before noon, he invited the visitors  to stay for dinner, assuring them that before starting the herd in the  afternoon, he would throw the cattle together for their inspection.  Flood made himself very agreeable, inquiring into cattle and range  matters in general as well as the stage of water in the river ahead.  The spokesman of the trail cutters met Flood's invitation to dinner  with excuses about the pressing demands on his time, and urged, if it  did not seriously interfere with our plans, that he be allowed to  inspect the herd before crossing the river. His reasons seemed trivial  and our foreman was not convinced.    \"You see, gentlemen,\" he said, \"in handling these southern cattle, we  must take advantage of occasions. We have timed our morning's drive so  as to reach the river during the warmest hour of the day, or as near  noon as possible. You can hardly imagine what a difference there is,  in fording this herd, between a cool, cloudy day and a clear, hot one.  You see the herd is strung out nearly a mile in length now, and to  hold them up and waste an hour or more for your inspection would  seriously disturb our plans. And then our wagon and _remuda_ have gone  on with orders to noon at the first good camp beyond the river. I  perfectly understand your reasons, and you equally understand mine;  but I will send a man or two back to help you recross any cattle you  may find in our herd. Now, if a couple of you gentlemen will ride  around on the far side with me, and the others will ride up near the  lead, we will trail the cattle across when we reach the river without  cutting the herd into blocks.\"    Flood's affability, coupled with the fact that the lead cattle were  nearly up to the river, won his point. Our visitors could only yield,  and rode forward with our lead swing men to assist in forcing the lead  cattle into the river. It was swift water, but otherwise an easy  crossing, and we allowed the herd, after coming out on the farther  side, to spread out and graze forward at its pleasure. The wagon and  saddle stock were in sight about a mile ahead, and leaving two men on  herd to drift the cattle in the right direction, the rest of us rode  leisurely on to the wagon, where dinner was waiting. Flood treated our  callers with marked courtesy during dinner, and casually inquired if  any of their number had seen any cattle that day or the day previous  in the Ellison road brand. They had not, they said, explaining that  their range lay on both sides of the Concho, and that during the trail  season they kept all their cattle between that river and the main  Colorado. Their work had kept them on their own range recently, except  when trail herds were passing and needed to be looked through for  strays. It sounded as though our trail cutters could also use  diplomacy on occasion.    When dinner was over and we had caught horses for the afternoon and  were ready to mount, Flood asked our guests for their credentials as  duly authorized trail cutters. They replied that they had none, but  offered in explanation the statement that they were merely cutting in  the interest of the immediate locality, which required no written  authority.    Then the previous affability of our foreman turned to iron. \"Well,  men,\" said he, \"if you have no authority to cut this trail, then you  don't cut this herd. I must have inspection papers before I can move a  brand out of the county in which it is bred, and I'll certainly let no  other man, local or duly appointed, cut an animal out of this herd  without written and certified authority. You know that without being  told, or ought to. I respect the rights of every man posted on a trail  to cut it. If you want to see my inspection papers, you have a right  to demand them, and in turn I demand of you your credentials, showing  who you work for and the list of brands you represent; otherwise no  harm's done; nor do you cut any herd that I'm driving.\"    \"Well,\" said one of the men, \"I saw a couple of head in my own  individual brand as we rode up the herd. I'd like to see the man who  says that I haven't the right to claim my own brand, anywhere I find  it.\"    \"If there's anything in our herd in your individual brand,\" said  Flood, \"all you have to do is to give me the brand, and I'll cut it  for you. What's your brand?\"    \"The 'Window Sash.'\"    \"Have any of you boys seen such a brand in our herd?\" inquired Flood,  turning to us as we all stood by our horses ready to start.    \"I didn't recognize it by that name,\" replied Quince Forrest, who rode  in the swing on the branded side of the cattle and belonged to the  last guard, \"but I remember seeing such a brand, though I would have  given it a different name. Yes, come to think, I'm sure I saw it, and  I'll tell you where: yesterday morning when I rode out to throw those  drifting cattle away from our herd, I saw that brand among the Ellison  cattle which had stampeded the night before. When Straw's outfit cut  theirs out yesterday, they must have left the 'Window Sash' cattle  with us; those were the range cattle which stampeded his herd. It  looked to me a little blotched, but if I'd been called on to name it,  I'd called it a thief's brand. If these gentlemen claim them, though,  it'll only take a minute to cut them out.\"    \"This outfit needn't get personal and fling out their insults,\"  retorted the claimant of the \"Window Sash\" brand, \"for I'll claim my  own if there were a hundred of you. And you can depend that any animal  I claim, I'll take, if I have to go back to the ranch and bring twenty  men to help me do it.\"    \"You won't need any help to get all that's coming to you,\" replied our  foreman, as he mounted his horse. \"Let's throw the herd together,  boys, and cut these 'Window Sash' cattle out. We don't want any cattle  in our herd that stampede on an open range at midnight; they must  certainly be terrible wild.\"    As we rode out together, our trail cutters dropped behind and kept a  respectable distance from the herd while we threw the cattle together.  When the herd had closed to the required compactness, Flood called our  trail cutters up and said, \"Now, men, each one of you can take one of  my outfit with you and inspect this herd to your satisfaction. If you  see anything there you claim, we'll cut it out for you, but don't  attempt to cut anything yourselves.\"    We rode in by pairs, a man of ours with each stranger, and after  riding leisurely through the herd for half an hour, cut out three head  in the blotched brand called the \"Window Sash.\" Before leaving the  herd, one of the strangers laid claim to a red cow, but Fox  Quarternight refused to cut the animal.    When the pair rode out the stranger accosted Flood. \"I notice a cow of  mine in there,\" said he, \"not in your road brand, which I claim. Your  man here refuses to cut her for me, so I appeal to you.\"    \"What's her brand, Fox?\" asked Flood.    \"She's a 'Q' cow, but the colonel here thinks it's an 'O.' I happen to  know the cow and the brand both; she came into the herd four hundred  miles south of here while we were watering the herd in the Nueces  River. The 'Q' is a little dim, but it's plenty plain to hold her for  the present.\"    \"If she's a 'Q' cow I have no claim on her,\" protested the stranger,  \"but if the brand is an 'O,' then I claim her as a stray from our  range, and I don't care if she came into your herd when you were  watering in the San Fernando River in Old Mexico, I'll claim her just  the same. I'm going to ask you to throw her.\"    \"I'll throw her for you,\" coolly replied Fox, \"and"]]]
