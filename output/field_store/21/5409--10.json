And they most ardently hope to see a British parliament,      by the extinction of that sanguinary traffic, extend the blessings      of liberty to millions beyond this realm, hold up to an enlightened      world a glorious and merciful example, and stand foremost in the      defence of the violated rights of human nature.\"    This petition was presented by the honourable Ann Poulet, and Alexander  Hood, esq., (now lord Bridport) who were the members for the town of  Bridgewater. It was ordered to lie on the table. The answer, which these  gentlemen gave to their constituents relative to the reception of it in the  house of commons, is worthy of notice: \"There did not appear,\" say they in  their common letter, \"the least disposition to pay any farther attention to  it. Every one almost says, that the abolition of the Slave-trade must  immediately throw the West Indian islands into convulsions, and soon  complete their utter ruin. Thus they will not trust Providence for its  protection for so pious an undertaking.\"    In the year 1786, captain J.S. Smith of the royal navy offered himself to  the notice of the public in behalf of the African cause. Mr. Ramsay, as I  have observed before, had become involved in a controversy in consequence  of his support of it. His opponents not only attacked his reputation, but  had the effrontery to deny his facts. This circumstance occasioned captain  Smith to come forward. He wrote a letter to his friend Mr. Hill, in which  he stated that he had seen those things, while in the West Indies, which  Mr. Ramsay had asserted to exist, but which had been so boldly denied. He  gave also permission to Mr. Hill to publish this letter. Too much praise  cannot be bestowed on captain Smith, for thus standing forth in a noble  cause, and in behalf of an injured character.    The last of the necessary forerunners and coadjutors of this class, whom I  am to mention, was our much-admired poet, Cowper; and a great coadjutor he  was, when we consider what value was put upon his sentiments, and the  extraordinary circulation of his works. There are few persons, who have not  been properly impressed by the following lines:                       \"My ear is pain'd,    My soul is sick with every day's report    Of wrong and outrage with which earth is fill'd.    There is no flesh in man's obdurate heart,    It does not feel for man. The nat'ral bond    Of brotherhood is sever'd as the flax    That falls asunder at the touch of fire.    He finds his fellow guilty of a skin    Not colour'd like his own, and having pow'r    T'inforce the wrong, for such a worthy cause    Dooms and devotes him as his lawful prey.    Lands intersected by a narrow frith    Abhor each other. Mountains interpos'd,    Make enemies of nations, who had else,    Like kindred drops, been mingled into one.    Thus man devotes his brother, and destroys;    And, worse than all, and most to be deplor'd    As human Nature's broadest, foulest blot,--    Chains him, and tasks him, and exacts his sweat    With stripes, that mercy with a bleeding heart    Weeps, when she sees inflicted on a beast.    Then what is man? And what man, seeing this,    And having human feelings, does not blush    And hang his head to think himself a man?    I would not have a slave to till my ground,    To carry me, to fan me while I sleep,    And tremble when I wake, for all the wealth    That sinews bought and sold have ever earn'd.    No! dear as freedom is,--and in my heart's    Just estimation priz'd above all price,--    I had much rather be myself the slave,    And wear the bonds, than fasten them on him.    We have no Slaves at home--then why abroad?    And they themselves once ferried o'er the wave    That parts us, are emancipate and loos'd.    Slaves cannot breathe in England; if their lungs    Receive our air, that moment they are free;    They touch our country, and their shackles fall[A].    That's noble, and bespeaks a nation proud    And jealous of the blessing. Spread it then,    And let it circulate through every vein    Of all your empire--that where Britain's pow'r    Is felt, mankind may feel her mercy too.\"    [Footnote A: Expressions used in the great trial, when Mr. Sharp obtained  the verdict in favour of Somerset.]          CHAPTER IV.    _Second class of forerunners and coadjutors, up to May 1787, consists of  the Quakers in England--of George Fox, and others--of the body of the  Quakers assembled at the yearly meeting in 1727--and at various other  times--Quakers, as a body, petition Parliament--and circulate books on the  subject--Individuals among them become labourers and associate in behalf of  the Africans--Dilwyn--Harrison--and others--This the first association  ever formed in England for the purpose._      The second class of the forerunners and coadjutors in this great cause up  to May 1787 will consist of the Quakers in England.    The first of this class was George Fox, the venerable founder of this  benevolent society.    George Fox was contemporary with Richard Baxter, being born not long after  him, and dying much about the same time. Like him, he left his testimony  against this wicked trade. When he was in the island of Barbadoes, in the  year 1671, he delivered himself to those who attended his religious  meetings, in the following manner:--    \"Consider with yourselves,\" says he, \"if you were in the same condition as  the poor Africans are--who came strangers to you, and were sold to you as  slaves--I say, if this should be the condition of you or yours, you would  think it a hard measure; yea, and very great bondage and cruelty. And  therefore consider seriously of this; and do you for them, and to them, as  you would willingly have them, or any others do unto you, were you in the  like slavish condition, and bring them to know the Lord Christ.\" And in his  Journal, speaking of the advice, which he gave his friends at Barbadoes, he  says, \"I desired also, that they would cause their overseers to deal mildly  and gently with their Negros, and not to use cruelty towards them, as the  manner of some had been, and that after certain years of servitude they  should make them free.\"    William Edmundson, who was a minister of the Society, and, indeed, a  fellow-traveller with George Fox, had the boldness in the same island to  deliver his sentiments to the governor on the same subject. Having been  brought before him and accused of making the Africans Christians, or, in  other words, of making them rebel and destroy their owners, he replied,  \"that it was a good thing to bring them to the knowledge of God and Christ  Jesus, and to believe in him who died for them and all men, and that this  would keep them from rebelling, or cutting any person's throat; but if they  did rebel and cut their throats, as the governor insinuated they would, it  would be their own doing, in keeping them in ignorance and under  oppression, in giving them liberty to be common with women, like brutes,  and, on the other hand, in starving them for want of meat and clothes  convenient; thus giving them liberty in that which God restrained, and  restraining them in that which was meat and clothing.\"    I do not find any individual of this society moving in this cause for some  time after the death of George Fox and William Edmundson. The first  circumstance of moment, which I discover, is a Resolution of the whole  Society on the subject, at their yearly meeting held in London in the year  1727. The resolution was contained in the following words:--\"It is the  sense of this meeting, that the importing of Negros from their native  country and relations by Friends, is not a commendable nor allowed  practice, and is therefore censured by this meeting.\"    In the year 1758 the Quakers thought it their duty, as a body to pass  another Resolution upon this subject. At this time the nature of the trade  beginning to be better known we find them more animated upon it, as the  following extract will show:--    \"We fervently warn all in profession with us, that they carefully avoid  being any way concerned in reaping the unrighteous profits arising from the  iniquitous practice of dealing in Negro or other slaves; whereby, in the  original purchase, one man selleth another, as he doth the beasts that  perish, without any better pretension to a property in him, than that of  superior force; in direct violation of the Gospel rule, which teacheth all  to do as they would be done by, and to do good to all; being the reverse of  that covetous disposition, which furnisheth encouragement to those poor  ignorant people to perpetuate their savage wars, in order to supply the  demands of this most unnatural traffic, by which great numbers of mankind,  free by nature, are subject to inextricable bondage; and which hath often  been observed to fill their possessors with haughtiness, tyranny, luxury,  and barbarity, corrupting the minds and debasing the morals of their  children, to the unspeakable prejudice of religion and virtue, and the  exclusion of that holy spirit of universal love, meekness, and charity,  which is the unchangeable nature and the glory of true Christianity. We  therefore can do no less than, with the greatest earnestness, impress it  upon Friends every where, that they endeavour to keep their hands clear of  this unrighteous gain of oppression.\"    The Quakers hitherto, as appears by the two resolutions which have been  quoted, did nothing more than seriously warn all those in religious  profession with them, against being concerned in this trade. But in three  years afterwards; or at the yearly meeting in 1761, they came to a  resolution, as we find by the following extract from"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/12434"],[0,"Twelve Studies on the Making of a Nation: The Beginnings of Israel's History (#13)"],[1,"all the prisoners who  were in the prison, and for whatever they did he was responsible.    And Pharaoh said to Joseph, See, I have appointed you over all the  land of Egypt.  And Pharaoh took off his signet ring from his  finger and put it upon Joseph's finger, and clothed him in garments  of fine linen, and put a gold chain about his neck, and made him  ride in the second chariot which he had.  Then they cried before  him, Bow the knee!  Thus he set him over all the land of Egypt.  Pharaoh also said to Joseph, I am Pharaoh, but without your consent  shall no man lift up his hand or his foot in all the land of  Egypt.--_Hist. Bible_.    For what is a man profited, if he shall gain the whole world and  lose his own soul?--_Matt. 16:36_.    Men at some time are masters of their fates: The fault, dear  Brutus, is not in our stars, but in ourselves, that we are  underlings.--_Shakespeare_ (Julius Caesar, Act. I, Sc. 2, L. 139).    I find the great thing in this world is not so much where we stand  as in what direction we are moving.  To reach the port of Heaven we  must sail sometimes with the wind, and sometimes against it; but we  must sail and not drift, nor lie at anchor.--_O. W. Holmes_.      He that respects himself is safe from others;    He wears a coat of mail that none can pierce.    It is more important to make a life than to make a  living.--_Ex-Governor Russell of Massachusetts_.      I.    THE QUALITIES ESSENTIAL TO SUCCESS.    The late Samuel L. Clemens (Mark Twain) advised a young man who  desired to enter business to select the firm with which he wished  to be associated, then ask that they give him work, without  mentioning the subject of compensation.  Having secured this  opportunity to demonstrate his ability and willingness to work,  recognition would come in due time.  This advice received the  approval of many prominent business men.  It concretely illustrates  the fact that the first essential of success is the willingness to  serve.  It also emphasizes the necessity of being ready to do the  work in accordance with the employer's wishes.  Ultimate success  also requires knowledge and trained ability.  These, however, come  through apprenticeship and a faithful improvement of opportunities.  The Hebrew sages, with true insight, emphasized the importance of  knowledge; but they taught also that wisdom, which is not only  knowledge, but the power to apply it practically in the various  relations of life, was far more important.    What other qualities are essential to the highest success?  Is it  very important that a man should have the right moral standards?  How do a man's habits affect his efficiency?    Is it only the genius who is able to attain the highest success  to-day in business and professional life?  Do you accept George  Eliot's definition of genius as \"the capacity for unlimited work\"?  To what extent does a man's faith in God and in his fellow men  determine his ability to win success?  How far are they essential  to the attainment of the highest type of success?      II.    THE LIMITATIONS AND TEMPTATIONS OF JOSEPH'S EARLY LIFE.    The Hebrew sage who uttered the prayer:      Remove far from me falsehood and lies;    Give me neither poverty nor riches;    Feed me with the food that is needful for me.      --_Prov. 30:8_.    voiced a great economic as well as moral principle.  The men who  are handicapped to-day in the race for success are either those who  are born in homes of extreme poverty or of extreme wealth where  they are unnaturally barred or shielded from the real problems and  tasks of life.  Which is probably the greater handicap?  To which  class did Joseph belong?    In what ways did his father show his favoritism towards Joseph?  The Hebrew word rendered in the older translations, \"coat of many  colors,\" means literally, \"long-sleeved tunic.\" This garment, like  those worn by wealthy Chinese when in native costume, distinguished  the rich or the nobility, who were not under the necessity of  engaging in manual labor.    The dreams which Joseph told to his brothers reveal his high  estimate of his own importance and were probably suggested by his  father's attitude toward him.  They were indeed a revelation of the  ambitions already stirring in the young boy's mind.  But Joseph  required closer contact with real life in order to transform his  ambitions into actual achievements.    Joseph gave his brothers cause for hatred toward him, but their  action in selling him to the Ishmaelites was by no means  justifiable.  Nevertheless it brought to Joseph the experiences and  opportunities absolutely essential to the attainment of his  ultimate success.  Often what seem man's greatest misfortunes are  in reality the door that opens to the new and larger opportunities.  In what two ways may a man meet misfortune?      III.    THE CALL OF A GREAT OPPORTUNITY.    Egypt, with its marvelous natural resources, its peculiar climate,  its irrigation, which usually guarantees good crops, and its  versatile people, has always been pre-eminently the land of  opportunity.  Especially was this true during the reigns of the  powerful despots of the eighteenth dynasty, when the relations  between Egypt and Palestine were exceedingly close.  Thus, for  example, according to contemporary records, during the reign of the  great reformer king, Amenhotep IV, several Semites rose to  positions of great authority.  A certain Dudu (David) was one of  the most trusted officials of this king.  He is addressed by one of  the Egyptian governors as \"My lord, my father.\"  Another Semite  named Yanhamu not only had control of the storehouses of grain in  the eastern part of the Nile Delta, but also directed the Egyptian  rule of Palestine.  The local governors of Palestine refer to him  in terms which suggest that his authority was almost equal to that  of Pharaoh himself.  This was perhaps the Joseph of the Biblical  account.    Is there any evidence that Joseph complained because of the  injustice of his brothers?  By loyal attention to his duties he  made himself indispensable to his Egyptian master.  A great  temptation came to him in the new home.  What influences led him to  resist this temptation?  Analyze his probable motives in detail.    The great injustice which he suffered and the seeming misfortune  proved in turn a new door of opportunity, but this would not have  been the case had not Joseph forgotten his own personal wrongs and  given himself to the service of his fellow-prisoners.  Was the  prosperity which generally attended Joseph a miraculous gift or the  natural consequences of his courageous, helpful spirit and his  skill in making the best of every situation?    In modern life as in the ancient story, the place usually seeks the  man who is fitted to fill it.  The ever recurring complaint of  employers is the scarcity of good men, especially of men able to  exercise discretion in positions of responsibility.  Was it  Joseph's skill in interpreting Pharaoh's dreams, or his wise  counsel in suggesting methods of providing for the people during  famine that gave him his position of high trust and authority?  Was  the policy which made Pharaoh practical owner of all the land first  instituted by Joseph, or was it already in force in Egypt?  (_Hist.  Bible_, I, 133.)  In the thought of the prophetic narrative, was  Joseph's fiscal system regarded as evidence of his loyalty to his  master rather than of disloyalty to the interests of the people?  Was the system suited to that stage and kind of civilization?  Can  this be cited by Socialists to-day as a valid argument in favor of  public ownership of all land?  If not, why not?    Three principles, illustrated by Joseph's life, are true to all  time: (1) The only successful way to forget one's own burdens is to  help bear another's; (2) God makes all things work together for  good to those that love him; (3) he alone who improves the small  opportunities will not miss the great chances of life.      IV.    THE TEMPTATIONS OF SUCCESS.    Modern life, and especially that in America to-day, is full of  illustrations of the overwhelming temptations which come to the man  who has had great success.  Many a man has enjoyed the confidence  and respect of his associates until his abilities have won for him  large wealth with which apparently comes at times a misleading  sense of immunity from the ordinary moral obligations.  The result  has been that the sterling virtues which have enabled him to win  success have been quickly undermined and his public and private  acts have become the theme of the public press.  Instead of being  an honor he has become a disgrace to his nation.    Joseph's sudden rise to power surpassed anything told in the  Arabian Nights' Tales, and yet he remained the same simple,  unaffected man, more thoughtful for another's interests than for  his own.  The supreme test came in his contact with his brothers,  who had insulted and cruelly wronged him.  They were completely at  his mercy and he had abundant reason for ignoring the obligations  of kinship.  Did Joseph hide his cup in Benjamin's sack and later  hold him as a hostage in order to punish his brothers or to test  their honor and fidelity?  Was this action wise?  Did the brothers  stand the test?    No class was regarded by the Egyptians with greater scorn and  contempt than the shepherds to whom they entrusted their flocks,  because the task of herding sheep was regarded as too menial for an  Egyptian.  The public recognition of his shepherd kinsmen,  therefore, revealed in Joseph the noblest and most courageous  qualities.    Why is such loyalty a primary obligation?  Is it to-day regarded by  all thoughtful men as one of the clearest evidences of a strong  character?  Can you give any modern illustrations, perhaps among  your acquaintances?  What is a snob?  Did Joseph leave undone any  act which loyalty to his kinsmen could prompt?  Is Joseph's"]]]
