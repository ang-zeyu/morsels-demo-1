But for  the big affairs with 500 or 600 guests, they went to the hotels. Even  the hotels had to rent my dishes, silver and linens.... Oh, lord, yes,  miss. I always had my own. It took me ten years to save enough money to  start out with my first 500 of everything.... You want to see them?...  Sure, I keep them here at home.... Look. Here's my silver chests, all  packed to go. I have them divided into different sizes. This one has  fifty of every kind of silver, so if fifty guests are to be provided  for. I keep my linens, plates of different sizes, glasses and everything  the same way. A 200-guest outfit is packed in those chests over there.  No, ma'am, I don't have much trouble of losing silver, because it all  has my initials on; look: H.K.M. on every piece. Heap of dishes are  broken every time I have a big catering. I found one plate  yesterday--the last of a full pattern I had fifteen years ago. About  every ten years is a complete turnover of china. Glassware goes faster,  and of course, the linen is the greatest overhead. Yes ma'am, as I was  telling you, catering is slack because of clubs. So many women take  their parties to clubs now. Another thing, the style of food has  changed. In those old days, the table was loaded with three four meats,  fish, half dozen vegetable dishes, entrees, different kinds of wine, and  an array of desserts. Now what do they have? Liquid punch, frozen punch  and cakes. In June I had a wedding party for 400, and that's all they  served. I had to have 30 punch bowls, but borrowed about half from my  white friends.    \"You have got that wrong about me living with my grandchildren. No  ma'am! They are living with me. They make their home with me. I don't  expect ever to marry again. I'm 86. In my will I am leaving everything I  have to my three grandchildren.    \"Well, miss, you're looking young and blooming. Guess your husband is  right proud of you? Say you're a widow? Well, now, my goodness. Some of  these days a fine man going to find you and then, er--er, lady, let me  cater for the wedding?\"          Interviewer: Samuel S.

Miller]                      1513 State Street, Little Rock, Arkansas  Age 87 [HW: 86]      \"I am eighty-six years old-eighty-six years and six months. I was born  July 25, 1851. I was a slave. Didn't get free till June 1865. I was a  boy fifteen years old when I got free.    \"I have been living in this house fifty years. I have been living in  Arkansas ever since 1873. That makes about sixty-five years.    \"The engineer who got killed in that wreck the other day (a wreck which  occurred February 7, 1938, Monday morning at three and in which the  engineer and five other people were killed) came right from my town,  Fort Valley, Georgia. I came here from there in 1873. I don't know  anybody living in Fort Valley now unless it's my own folks. And I don't  'spect I'd know them now. When I got married and left there, I was only  twenty-one years old.      Parents and Relatives    \"My mother and father were born in South Carolina. After their master  and missis married they came to Georgia. Back there I don't know. When I  remember anything they were in Georgia. They said they came from South  Carolina to Georgia. I don't know how they came. Both of my parents were  Negroes. They came to Arkansas ahead of me. I have their pictures.\" (He  carried me into the parlor and showed me life-sized bust portraits of  his mother and father.)    \"There were eighteen of us: six boys and twelve girls. They are all dead  now but myself and one sister. She lives in Atlanta, Georgia. I am older  than she is.      Occupation    \"I am a caterer. I have been serving the Scottish Rite Masons in their  annual reunion every six months for forty-one years. We are going to the  Seventh Street Entrance this Friday. One of the orders will have a  dinner and I am going down to serve it. I served the dinner for Teddy  Roosevelt there, thirty years ago. This Roosevelt is a cousin of his.      Masters    \"My parents' master was named Wade. When he died, I was so little that  they had to lift me up to let me see into the coffin so I could look at  him. I went to his daughter. My name is after my father's father. My  grandfather was named Miller. I took his name. He was a white man.    \"Wade's daughter was named Riley, but I keep my grandfather's name. My  mother and father were then transferred to the Rileys too, and they took  the name of Riley. It was after freedom that I took the name Miller from  my original people. Haven Riley's father was my brother.\" (Haven Riley  lives in Little Rock and was formerly an instructor at Philander Smith  College. Now he is a public stenographer and a private teacher.)    \"Wade owned all of my brothers and sisters and parents and some of my  kin--father's sister and brother. There might have been some more I  can't remember. Wade was a farmer.    \"I remember once when my mother and father were going to the field to  work, I went with them as usual. That was before Wade died and his  daughter drew us.    \"My wife died six years ago. If she had lived till tomorrow, she would  have been married to me sixty years. She died on the tenth of February  and we were married on the sixth. We just lacked five years of being  married sixty years when she died.      Food    \"For food, I don't know anything more than bread and meat. Meal, meat,  molasses were the only rations I saw. In those times the white people  had what was known as the white people's house and then what was known  as nigger quarters. The children that weren't big enough to work were  fed at the white people's house. We got milk and mush for breakfast.  When they boiled cabbage we got bread and pot-liquor. For supper we got  milk and bread. They had cows and the children were fed mostly on milk  and mush or milk and bread. We used to bake a corn cake in the ashes,  ash cake, and put it in the milk.    \"The chickens used to lay out in the barn. If we children would find the  nests and bring the eggs in our missis would give us a biscuit, and we  always got biscuits for Christmas.      Houses in the Negro Quarters    \"In the nigger quarters there were nothing but log houses. I don't  remember any house other than a log house. They'd just go out in the  woods and get logs and put up a log house. Put dirt and mud or clay in  the cracks to seal it. Notch the logs in the end to hitch them at  corners. Nailed planks at the end of the logs to make a door frame.    \"My people all ate and cooked and lived in the same room. Some of the  slaves had dirt floors and some of them had plank floors.    \"Food was kept in the house in a sort of box or chest, built in the wall  sometimes. Mostly it was kept on the table.    \"In cooking they had a round oven made like a pot only the bottom would  be flat. It had an iron top. The oven was a bought oven. It was shaped  like a barrel. The top lifted up. Coal was placed under the oven and a  little on top.      Tables and Chairs    \"Tables were just boards nailed together. Nothing but planks nailed  together. I don't remember nothing but homemade benches for chairs. They  sometimes made platted or split-bottom chairs out of white oak. Strips  of oak were seven feet long. They put them in water so they would bend  easily and wove them while they were flexible and fresh. The whole chair  bottom was made out of one strip just like in caning. Those chairs were  stouter than the chairs they make now.\"    (To be continued) [TR: No continuation found.]          Interviewer: Mrs. Annie L. LaCotts  Person interviewed: Matilda Miller                      Humphrey, Ark.  Age: 79      The day of the interview Matilda, a nice clean-looking Negro woman, was  in bed, suffering from some kind of a pain in her head. She lives in a  little two-room unpainted boxed house beside the highway in Humphrey.  Her house is almost in the shadow of the big tank which was put up  recently when the town acquired its water system.    When told that the visitor wanted to talk with her about her early life,  Matilda said, \"Well, honey, I'll tell you all I can, but you see, I was  just a little girl when the war was, but I've heard my mother tell lots  of things about then.    \"I was born a slave; my mother and daddy both were owned by Judge  Richard Gamble at Crockett's Bluff. I was born at Boone Hill--about  twelve miles north of DeWitt--and how come it named Boone Hill, that  farm was my young mistress's. Her papa give it to her, just like he give  me to her when I was little, and after she married Mr. Oliver Boone and  lived there the farm always went by the name of 'Boone Hill.' The house  is right on top of a hill, you know, it shure was a pretty place when  Miss Georgia lived there, with great big Magnolia trees in the front  yard. I belonged to Miss Georgia, my young mistress, and when the  niggers were freed my mamma staid on with her. She was right there when  both of his chillun were born, Mr. John Boone and Miss Mary, too. I  nursed _both_ of them chillun. You know who Miss Mary is now, don't you?  Yes'um, she's Mr. Lester Black's wife and he's good, too.    \"I was de oney child my mother had till twelve years after the  surrender. You see, my papa went off with Yankees and didn't come back  till twelve years after we was free, and then I had some brothers and  sisters. Exactly nine months from the day my daddy come home, I had a  baby brother born. My mother said she knew my daddy had been married or  took up with some other woman, but she hadn't got a divorce and still  counted him her husband. They lived for a long time with our white  folks, for they were good to us, but you know after the boys and girls  got grown and began to marry and live in different places, my parents  wanted to be with them and left the white folks.    \"No mam, I didn't see any fighting, but we could hear the big guns  booming away off"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/11547"],[0,"Blackfoot Lodge Tales: The Story of a Prairie People (#13)"],[1,"ds, he swayed, and then fell forward on the  grass, dead. But now the warriors came pouring from the camp to aid  him. Too late! The Snakes quickly scalped their fallen enemy, scattered up  the mountain, and were lost to sight.    Now Fox-eye had two wives, and their father and mother and all their near  relations were dead. All Fox-eye's relatives, too, had long since gone to  the Sand Hills[1]. So these poor widows had no one to avenge them, and they  mourned deeply for the husband so suddenly taken from them. Through the  long days they sat on a near hill and mourned, and their mourning was very  sad.    [Footnote 1: Sand Hills: the shadow land; place of ghosts; the Blackfoot  future world.]    There was a young warrior named Mik-a'pi. Every morning he was awakened by  the crying of these poor widows, and through the day his heart was touched  by their wailing. Even when he went to rest, their mournful cries reached  him through the darkness, and he could not sleep. So he sent his mother to  them. \"Tell them,\" he said, \"that I wish to speak to them.\" When they had  entered, they sat close by the door-way, and covered their heads.    \"_Kyi!\"_ said Mik-a'pi. \"For days and nights I have heard your mourning,  and I too have silently mourned. My heart has been very sad. Your husband  was my near friend, and now he is dead and no relations are left to avenge  him. So now, I say, I will take the load from your hearts. I will avenge  him. I will go to war and take many scalps, and when I return, they shall  be yours. You shall paint your faces black, and we will all rejoice that  Fox-eye is avenged.\"    When the people heard that Mik-a'pi was going to war, many warriors wished  to join him, but he refused them; and when he had taken a medicine sweat,  and got a medicine-pipe man to make medicine for him during his absence, he  started from the camp one evening, just after sunset. It is only the  foolish warrior who travels in the day; for other war parties may be out,  or some camp-watcher sitting on a hill may see him from far off, and lay  plans to destroy him. Mik-a'pi was not one of these. He was brave but  cautious, and he had strong medicine. Some say that he was related to the  ghosts, and that they helped him. Having now started to war against the  Snakes, he travelled in hidden places, and at sunrise would climb a hill  and look carefully in all directions, and during the long day would lie  there, and watch, and take short sleeps.    Now, when Mik-a'pi had come to the Great Falls (of the Missouri), a heavy  rain set in; and, seeing a hole in the rocks, he crawled in and lay down in  the farther end to sleep. The rain did not cease, and when night came he  could not travel because of the darkness and storm; so he lay down to sleep  again. But soon he heard something coming into the cave toward him, and  then he felt a hand laid on his breast, and he put out his hand and touched  a person. Then Mik-a'pi put the palm of his hand on the person's breast and  jerked it to and fro, and then he touched the person with the point of his  finger, which, in the sign language, means, \"Who are you?\"    The strange person then took Mik-a'pi's hand, and made him feel of his own  right hand. The thumb and all the fingers were closed except the  forefinger, which was extended; and when Mik-a'pi touched it the person  moved his hand forward with a zigzag motion, which means \"Snake.\" Then  Mik-a'pi was glad. Here had come to him one of the tribe he was  seeking. But he thought it best to wait for daylight before attacking  him. So, when the Snake in signs asked him who he was, he replied, by  making the sign for paddling a canoe, that he was a Pend d'Oreille, or  River person. For he knew that the Snakes and the Pend d'Oreilles were at  peace.    Then they both lay down to sleep, but Mik-a'pi did not sleep. Through the  long night he watched for the first dim light, so that he might kill his  enemy. The Snake slept soundly; and just at daybreak Mik-a'pi quietly  strung his bow, fitted an arrow, and, taking aim, sent the thin shaft  through his enemy's heart. The Snake quivered, half rose up, and with a  groan fell back dead. Then Mik-a'pi took his scalp and his bow and arrows,  and also his bundle of moccasins; and as daylight had come, he went out of  the cave and looked all about. No one was in sight. Probably the Snake,  like himself, had gone alone to war. But, ever cautious, he travelled only  a short distance, and waited for night before going on. The rain had ceased  and the day was warm. He took a piece of dried meat and back fat from his  pouch and ate them, and, after drinking from the river, he climbed up on a  high rock wall and slept.    Now in his dream he fought with a strange people, and was wounded. He felt  blood trickling from his wounds, and when he awoke, he knew that he had  been warned to turn back. The signs also were bad. He saw an eagle rising  with a snake, which dropped from its claws and escaped. The setting sun,  too, was painted[1],--a sure warning to people that danger is near. But, in  spite of all these things, Mik-a'pi determined to go on. He thought of the  poor widows mourning and waiting for revenge. He thought of the glad  welcome of the people, if he should return with many scalps; and he thought  also of two young sisters, whom he wanted to marry. Surely, if he could  return and bring the proofs of brave deeds, their parents would be glad to  give them to him.    [Footnote 1: Sun dogs.]        II    It was nearly night. The sun had already disappeared behind the  sharp-pointed gray peaks. In the fading light the far-stretching prairie  was turning dark. In a valley, sparsely timbered with quaking aspens and  cotton-woods, stood a large camp. For a long distance up and down the river  rose the smoke of many lodges. Seated on a little hill overlooking the  valley, was a single person. With his robe drawn tightly around him, he sat  there motionless, looking down on the prairie and valley below.    Slowly and silently something was crawling through the grass toward  him. But he heard nothing. Still he gazed eastward, seeking to discover any  enemy who might be approaching. Still the dark object crawled slowly  onward. Now it was so close to him that it could almost touch him. The  person thought he heard a sound, and started to turn round. Too late! Too  late! A strong arm grasped him about the neck and covered his mouth. A long  jagged knife was thrust into his breast again and again, and he died  without a cry. Strange that in all that great camp no one should have seen  him killed!    Still extended on the ground, the dark figure removed the scalp. Slowly he  crawled back down the hill, and was lost in the gathering darkness. It was  Mik-a'pi, and he had another Snake scalp tied to his belt. His heart was  glad, yet he was not satisfied. Some nights had passed since the bad signs  had warned him, yet he had succeeded. \"One more,\" he said. \"One more scalp  I must have, and then I will go back.\" So he went far up on the mountain,  and hid in some thick pines and slept. When daylight came, he could see  smoke rise as the women started their fires. He also saw many people rush  up on the hill, where the dead watcher lay. He was too far off to hear  their angry shouts and mournful cries, but he sung to himself a song of war  and was happy.    Once more the sun went to his lodge behind the mountains, and as darkness  came Mik-a'pi slowly descended the mountain and approached the camp. This  was the time of danger. Behind each bush, or hidden in a bunch of the tall  rye grass, some person might be watching to warn the camp of an approaching  enemy. Slowly and like a snake, he crawled around the outskirts of the  camp, listening and looking. He heard a cough and saw a movement of a  bush. There was a Snake. Could he kill him and yet escape? He was close  to him now. So he sat and waited, considering how to act. For a long time  he sat there waiting. The moon rose and travelled high in the sky. The  Seven Persons[1] slowly swung around, and pointed downward. It was the  middle of the night. Then the person in the bush stood up and stretched out  his arms and yawned, for he was tired of watching, and thought that no  danger was near; but as he stood thus, an arrow pierced his breast. He gave  a loud yell and tried to run, but another arrow struck him and he fell.    [Footnote 1: The constellation of the Great Bear.]    At the sound the warriors rushed forth from the lodges and the outskirts of  the camp; but as they came, Mik-a'pi tore the scalp from his fallen enemy,  and started to run toward the river. Close behind him followed the Snakes.  Arrows whizzed about him. One pierced his arm. He plucked it out. Another  struck his leg, and he fell. Then a great shout arose from the  Snakes. Their enemy was down. Now they would be revenged for two lately  taken lives. But where Mik-a'pi fell was the verge of a high rock wall;  below rushed the deep river, and even as they shouted, he rolled from the  wall, and disappeared in the dark water far below. In vain they searched  the shores and bars. They did not find him.    Mik-a'pi had sunk deep in the water. The current was swift, and when at  last he rose to the surface, he was far below his pursuers. The arrow in  his leg pained him, and with difficulty he crawled out on a  sand-bar. Luckily the arrow was lance-shaped instead of barbed, so he  managed to draw it out. Near by on the bar was a dry pine log, lodged there  by the high spring water. This he managed to roll into the stream; and,  partly resting on it, he again drifted down with the current. All night he  floated down the river, and when morning came he was far from the camp of  the Snakes. Benumbed with cold and stiff from the arrow wounds, he was glad  to crawl out on the bank, and lie down in the warm sunshine. Soon he slept.      III    The sun was already in the middle when he awoke."]]]
