With this exception, all was left to  the memory of the orator. The Homeric poems, the hymns of the Vedas, the  Kalewala, the Polynesian genealogies, and many other examples, show the  exactness with which a composition that interests a whole nation may be  handed down; but it is not surprising that when the chiefs became aware  of the superior advantages of a written record, they should have had  recourse to it. We need not doubt that Chief David of Schoharie, or  whoever else was the scribe appointed to this duty, has faithfully  preserved the substance, and, for the most part, the very words, of the  speeches and chants which he had often heard under such impressive  circumstances.    The hymn, or _karenna_, deserves a special notice. In every important  council of the Iroquois a song or chant is considered a proper and  almost essential part of the proceedings. Such official songs are  mentioned in many reports of treaty councils held with them by the  French and English authorities. In this greatest of all councils the  song must, of course, have a distinguished place. It follows immediately  upon the address of greeting and condolence, and is, in fact, regarded  as the completion of it, and the introduction to the equally important  ceremony which is to follow, viz., the repetition of the ancient laws of  the confederacy. This particular hymn is of great antiquity. Some of the  chiefs expressed to me the opinion that it was composed by Dekana-widah  or Hiawatha. Its tenor, however, as well as that of the whole book,  shows that it belongs to a later period. The ceremonies of the council  were doubtless prescribed by the founders of the League; but the  speeches of the Book, and this hymn, all refer to the League as the work  of a past age. The speakers appeal to the wisdom of their forefathers  (literally, their grandsires), and lament the degeneracy of the later  times. They expressly declare that those who established the \"great  peace\" were in their graves, and had taken their work with them and  placed it as a pillow under them. This is the language of men who  remembered the founders, and to whom the burial of the last of them was  a comparatively recent event. If the league was formed, as seems  probable, about the year 1450, the speeches and hymn, in their present  form, may reasonably be referred to the early part of the next century.  There is reason to believe that the formation of the confederacy was  followed by wars with the Hurons and Algonkin tribes, in which, as  usual, many changes of fortune took place. If the Hurons, as has been  shown, were expelled from their abode on the northern shore of the St.  Lawrence, the Mohegans, on the other hand, inflicted some serious blows  upon the eastern nations of the confederacy. [Footnote: See the Jesuit  _Relation_ for 1660, p. 6.] The Delawares were not conquered and reduced  to subjection without a long and sanguinary struggle. In a Condoling  Council we might expect that the tone of feeling would be lugubrious;  but the sense of loss and of danger is too marked in all the speeches of  the Canienga Book to be merely a formal utterance. It does not appear in  those of the Onondaga Book, which is seemingly of later composition.    The \"karenna,\" or chant of the Condoling Council, may be styled the  National Hymn of the Iroquois. A comparison between it and other  national hymns, whose chief characteristics are self-glorification and  defiance, might afford room for some instructive inferences. This hymn,  it should be remarked, brief as it is, is regarded by the Indians as a  collection of songs. Each line, in fact, is, in their view, a song by  itself, and is brought to mind by its own special wampum string. In  singing, each line is twice repeated, and is introduced and followed by  many long-drawn repetitions of the exclamation _aihaigh_ (or rather  _haihaih_) which is rendered \"hail!\" and from which the hymn derives its  designation. In the first line the speaker salutes the \"Peace,\" or the  league, whose blessings they enjoy. In the next he greets the kindred of  the deceased chief, who are the special objects of the public sympathy.  Then he salutes the _oyenkondonh_, a term which has been rendered  \"warriors.\" This rendering, however, may have a misleading effect. The  word has nothing to do with war, unless in the sense that every grown  man in an Indian community is supposed to be a soldier. Except in this  hymn, the word in question is now disused. An elderly chief assured me  that he had sung it for years without knowing its precise meaning. Some  of his fellow-councillors were better informed. The word is apparently  derived from _ankwe_, man, which in the Onondaga dialect becomes  _yenkwe_. It comprises all the men (the \"manhood\" or mankind) of the  nation--as, in the following verse, the word _wakonnyh_, which is also  obsolete, signifies the \"womanhood,\" or all the women of the people with  whom the singer condoles. In the next line he invokes the laws which  their forefathers established; and he concludes by calling upon his  hearers to listen to the wisdom of their forefathers, which he is about  to recite. As a whole, the hymn may be described as an expression of  reverence for the laws and for the dead, and of sympathy with the  living. Such is the \"national anthem,\"--the Marseillaise,--of the  ferocious Iroquois.    The regard for women which is apparent in this hymn, and in other  passages of the Book, is deserving of notice. The common notion that  women among the Indians were treated as inferiors, and made \"beasts of  burden,\" is unfounded so far as the Iroquois are concerned, and among  all other tribes of which I have any knowledge. With them, as with  civilized nations, the work of the community and the cares of the family  are fairly divided. Among the Iroquois the hunting and fishing, the  house-building and canoe-making, fell to the men. The women cooked, made  the dresses, scratched the ground with their light hoes, planted and  gathered the crops, and took care of the children. The household goods  belonged to the woman. On her death, her relatives, and not her husband,  claimed them. The children were also hers; they belonged to her clan,  and in case of a separation they went with her. She was really the head  of the household; and in this capacity her right, when she chanced to be  the oldest matron of a noble family, to select the successor of a  deceased chief of that family, was recognized by the highest law of the  confederacy. That this rank and position were greatly prized is shown by  a remarkable passage in the Jesuit Relations. A Canienga matron,  becoming a Christian, left her country, with two of her children, to  enjoy greater freedom in her devotions among the French. The act, writes  the missionary, so offended her family that, in a public meeting of the  town, \"they degraded her from the rank of the nobility, and took from  her the title of Oyander, that is, honorable (_considerable_)--a title  which they esteem highly, and which she had inherited from her  ancestors, and deserved by her good judgment, her prudence, and her  excellent conduct; and at the same time they installed another in her  place.\" [Footnote: _Relation_ of 1671, p. 6. The word _oyander_ in  modern pronunciation becomes _oyaner_. It is derived from the root  _yaner_, noble, and is the feminine form of the word _royaner_, lord, or  nobleman,--the title applied to the members of the federal council.]    The complete equality of the sexes in social estimation and influence is  apparent in all the narratives of the early missionaries, who were the  best possible judges on this point. Casual observers have been misled by  the absence of those artificial expressions of courtesy which have  descended to us from the time of chivalry, and which, however gracious  and pleasing to witness, are, after all, merely signs of condescension  and protection from the strong to the weak. The Iroquois does not give  up his seat to a woman, or yield her precedence on leaving a room; but  he secures her in the possession of her property, he recognizes her  right to the children she has borne, and he submits to her decision the  choice of his future rulers.          CHAPTER VI.    THE LAWS OF THE LEAGUE.      It is the custom of the officiating orator, while the chant is going on,  to walk to and fro in the council-house. When the hymn is finished, he  breaks out into a passionate invocation to their forefathers, and a  lament over the degeneracy of the times. This, as the French  missionaries inform us, was a favorite topic of Indian speakers.  [Footnote: See the _Relation_ of 1659, p. 57: \"C'est la plainte  ordinaire des Capitaines [of the Hurons] que tout se va perdant, a faute  de garder les formes et coustoumes de leurs ancestres.\"] Among the  Iroquois, who could look back to an era of genuine statesmen and heroes,  the authors of their constitution, this complaint must have had a  peculiar force and sincerity. After this appeal to the founders of their  state, there naturally followed an address to the Council and the  people, reciting \"all the rules they decided on, which they thought  would strengthen the house.\" By \"the house\" was meant, of course, the  house of many hearths, to which they likened their confederacy. The  \"rules\" or laws which follow require some explanation, that their full  value may be understood.    The first law prescribes that when a chief dies his office shall not  perish with him. This is expressed, in their metaphorical style, by an  injunction that the \"horns,\" or insignia of office, shall not be buried  with the deceased chief, but shall be taken off at his death, to be  transferred to his successor. This rule is laid down in the most urgent  and impressive terms. \"We should perhaps all"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/8599"],[0,"Fairy Tales from the Arabian Nights (#12)"],[1,"she commanded one of her  women to shut up the owl in a cage, and give him neither meat nor  drink.    The woman took the cage, and without regarding what the queen  ordered, gave him both meat and drink; and being old Abdallah's  friend, she sent him word privately how the queen had treated his  nephew, and of her design to destroy both him and King Beder, that  he might give orders to prevent it and save himself.    Abdallah knew no common measures would do with Queen Labe: he  therefore did but whistle after a certain manner, and there  immediately arose a vast giant, with four wings, who, presenting  himself before him, asked what he wanted. 'Lightning,' said  Abdallah to him (for so was the genie called), 'I command you to  preserve the life of King Beder, son of Queen Gulnare. Go to the  palace of the magic queen, and transport immediately to the capital  of Persia the compassionate woman who has the cage in custody, so  that she may inform Queen Gulnare of the danger the king her son is  in, and the occasion he has for her assistance. Take care not to  frighten her when you come before her and tell her from me what she  ought to do.'    Lightning immediately disappeared, and got in an instant to the  palace of the magic queen. He instructed the woman, lifted her up  into the air, and transported her to the capital of Persia, where  he placed her on the terrace near the apartment where Queen Gulnare  was. She went downstairs to the apartment, and she there found  Queen Gulnare and Queen Farasche her mother lamenting their  misfortunes. She made them a profound obeisance and they soon  understood the great need that King Beder was in of their  assistance.    Queen Gulnare was so overjoyed at the news, that rising from her  seat, she went and embraced the good woman, telling her how much  she was obliged to her for the service she had done.    Then immediately going out, she commanded the trumpets to sound,  and the drums to beat, to acquaint the city that the King of Persia  would suddenly return safe to his kingdom. She then went again, and  found King Saleh her brother, whom Queen Farasche had caused to  come speedily thither by a certain fumigation. 'Brother,' said she  to him, 'the king your nephew, my dear son, is in the City of  Enchantments, under the power of Queen Labe. Both you and I must go  to deliver him, for there is no time to be lost.'    King Saleh forthwith assembled a powerful body of his marine  troops, who soon rose out of the sea. He also called to his  assistance the genies, his allies, who appeared with a much more  numerous army than his own. As soon as the two armies were joined,  he put himself at the head of them, with Queen Farasche, Queen  Gulnare, and the princesses. They then lifted themselves up into  the air, and soon poured down on the palace and City of  Enchantments, where the magic queen, her mother, and all the  adorers of fire, were destroyed in an instant.    Queen Gulnare had ordered the woman who brought her the news of  Queen Labe's transforming and imprisoning her son to follow her  closely, and bade her go, and in the confusion, seize the cage, and  bring it to her. This order was executed as she wished, and Queen  Gulnare was no sooner in possession of the cage than she opened it  and took out the owl, saying, as she sprinkled a little water upon  him, 'My dear son, quit that strange form, and resume thy natural  one of a man.'    In a moment Queen Gulnare no more saw the hideous owl, but King  Beder her son. She immediately embraced him with an excess of joy.  She could not find in her heart to let him go; and Queen Farasche  was obliged to force him from her in her turn. After her, he was  likewise embraced by the king his uncle and his relations.    Queen Gulnare's first care was to look out for old Abdallah, to  whom she had been indebted for the recovery of the King of Persia.  When he was brought to her, she said, 'My obligations to you, sir,  have been so great, that there is nothing in my power that I would  not freely do for you, as a token of my acknowledgment. Do but tell  me in what I can serve you.'    'Great queen,' replied Abdallah, 'if the lady whom I sent to your  majesty will but consent to the marriage I offer her, and the King  of Persia will give me leave to reside at his court, I will spend  the remainder of my days in his service.'    Then the queen turned to the lady, who was present, and finding  that she was not averse to the match proposed, she caused them to  join hands, and the King of Persia and she took care of their  welfare.    This marriage occasioned the King of Persia to speak thus to the  queen: 'Madam,' said he, 'I am heartily glad of this match which  your majesty has just made. There remains one more, which I desire  you to think of.'    Queen Gulnare did not at first comprehend what marriage he meant;  but after a little considering, she said, 'Of yours, you mean, son?  I consent to it with all my heart.' Then turning, and looking on  her brother's sea attendants, and the genies who were still  present, 'Go,' said she, 'and traverse both sea and land, to find  out the most lovely and amiable princess, worthy of the king my  son, and come and tell us.'    'Madam,' replied King Beder, 'it is to no purpose for them to take  all that pains. You have no doubt heard that I have already given  my heart to the Princess of Samandal. I have seen her, and do not  repent of the present I then made her. In a word, neither earth nor  sea, in my opinion, can furnish a princess like her. It is true  that she treated me in a way that would have extinguished any  affection less strong than mine. But I hold her excused; she could  not treat me with less rigour, after I had had the king her father  imprisoned. But it may be the King of Samandal has changed his  mind; and his daughter the princess may consent to love me when she  sees her father has agreed to it.'    'Son,' replied Queen Gulnare, 'if only the Princess Giauhara can  make you happy, it is not my design to oppose you. The king your  uncle need only have the King of Samandal brought, and we shall  soon see whether he be still of the same untractable temper.'    Strictly as the King of Samandal had been kept during his captivity  by King Saleh's orders, yet he always had great respect shown him,  and was become very familiar with the officers who guarded him.  King Saleh caused a chafing-dish of coals to be brought, into which  he threw a certain composition, uttering at the same time some  mysterious words. As soon as the smoke began to arise, the palace  shook, and immediately the King of Samandal, with King Saleh's  officers, appeared. The King of Persia cast himself at the King of  Samandal's feet, and kneeling said, 'It is no longer King Saleh  that demands of your majesty the honour of your alliance for the  King of Persia; it is the King of Persia himself that humbly begs  that boon; and I am sure your majesty will not persist in being the  cause of the death of a king who can no longer live if he does not  share life with the amiable Princess Giauhara.'    The King of Samandal did not long suffer the King of Persia to  remain at his feet. He embraced him and obliging him to rise, said,  'I should be very sorry to have contributed in the least to the  death of a monarch who is so worthy to live. If it be true that so  precious a life cannot be preserved without my daughter, live,  sir,' said he, 'she is yours. She has always been obedient to my  will, and I cannot think she will now oppose it.' Speaking these  words, he ordered one of his officers, whom King Saleh had  permitted to be about him, to go and look for the Princess  Giauhara, and bring her to him immediately.    The princess had remained where the King of Persia had left her.  The officer soon perceived her, and brought her with her women. The  King of Samandal embraced her, and said, 'Daughter, I have provided  a husband for you; it is the King of Persia you see there, the most  accomplished monarch at present in the universe. The preference he  has given you over all other Princesses obliges us both to express  our gratitude.'    'Sir,' replied the Princess Giauhara, 'your majesty well knows I  never have presumed to disobey your will in anything; I shall  always be ready to obey you; and I hope the King of Persia will  forget my ill-treatment of him, and consider it was duty, not  inclination, that forced me to it.'    The wedding was celebrated in the palace of the City of  Enchantments, with the greater solemnity in that all the lovers of  the magic queen, who resumed their original forms as soon as ever  that queen ceased to live, came to return their thanks to the King  of Persia, Queen Gulnare, and King Saleh. They were all sons of  kings or princes, or persons of high rank.    King Saleh at length conducted the King of Samandal to his  dominions, and put him in possession of them. The King of Persia  returned to his capital with Queen Gulnare, Queen Farasche, and the  princesses; and Queen Farasche and the princesses continued there  till King Saleh came to reconduct them to his kingdom under the  waves of the sea.                      THE THREE PRINCES AND THE PRINCESS NOURONNIHAR.        There was once a sultan of India who had three sons. These, with  the princess his niece, were the ornaments of his court. The eldest  of the princes was called Houssain, the second Ali, the youngest  Ahmed, and the princess his niece, Nouronnihar. The Princess  Nouronnihar was the daughter of the younger brother of the sultan,  to whom the sultan in his lifetime allowed a considerable revenue.  But that prince had not been married long before he died, and left  the princess very young. The sultan, out of brotherly love and  friendship, took upon himself the care of his niece's education,  and brought her up in his palace with the three princes, where her  singular beauty and personal accomplishments,"]]]
