The scuttlebutt  often referred to big Allied victories, prisoner exchanges, ships  loaded with food, a new Ford for every prisoner, promotions,  decorations, etc., etc.    They all proved to be figments of the imagination-just pure  scuttlebutt.    Prisoner-of-War Status: About October of 1942, the Japanese removed  our status of \"captive\" (criminal awaiting trial) and designated us as  \"prisoners-of-war!\" We hoped that this meant that things would get  better.    We began receiving pay-the same as the Japanese officers and soldiers  of the same rank. I quickly learned that after receiving my thirty yen  at the pay window, I had to move to the next window and deposit twenty  yen into Japanese Postal Savings.    When I graduated from Prison Camp (Class of August, 1945), I had more  than 30,000 yen in Postal Savings. They have never offered me any  money, or a Toyota; in fact, they haven't even answered my mail.    Post Cards: When we became prisoners-of-war, each prisoner received a  yellow, printed form post card. He could fill in the blank places,  sign it, and it would be sent home.    \"Major Eugene C. Jacobs    I am interned at Philippine Military Camp No.1.    My health is fair    I am Uninjured    Please take care of Insurance                                       Love, Eugene C. Jacobs, 1897\"    We were allowed to send one post card every six months during  thirty-eight months. The last card was a fifty-word card.    Mail: About the same number of times shipments of letters and packages  came into camp from the States. Censoring was extensive. I got one  letter that was completely cut out, except, \"Dear Gene,  ----------------------------------------------------------------------  ----------------------------------------------------------------------  ----------------------------------------------------------------------  -------    Love, Mother      Of course, these letters and packages were a Godsend. We passed the  letters around to all of our friends, hoping there might be something  of interest to them. We ate the cheese and malted milk in the  packages-even when they had maggots in them. It was a great boost to  our morale to know that someone loved us and was praying for our safe  return.    Commissary: We were permitted to have a commissary; my ten yen each  month bought a can of salmon or condensed milk, several bananas, a cup  of mongo beans or peanuts. Once I was able to buy a live chicken and  have a Thanksgiving dinner. The commissary was operated by Lt. Col.  Harold K. Johnson (later to become the Chief of Staff of the U.S.  Army), Capt. Amos and Capt. Norton. Gradually inflation became so bad  that the Japanese pay become almost worthless.    Chapel Service: We were permitted to go to church on Sundays.    The sermons had to be censored on Saturdays; there was often a Jap  attending service-to keep the preachers honest. Lt. Col. Alfred  Oliver, U. S. Army, was chief of chaplains in the Philippines by  reason of seniority.    Two protestant chaplains built their own chapels with scrap lumber and  prison labor. Capt. Frank Tiffany was a Presbyterian; I became an  elder in his chapel. Capt. Robert Taylor was a Baptist. I became a  deacon in his chapel. Other chaplains used mess halls, libraries and  even barracks to hold their services.    Catholic chaplains were: Majors Stanley Reilly and Albert Braun,  Captains Richard Carberry, John McDonnell, Stober, Albert Talbot, Tom  Scenina, and Dugan, and Lieutenants McManus, James O'Brien, Mithias  Zerfas, John Wilson, Duffy, William Cummings, and John Curran.    Protestant chaplains included: Majors John Borneman and Ralph Brown,  Captains Sam Donald, Leslie Zimmerman, Morris Day, Arthur Cleveland,  and Lieutenants Quinn, Herbert Trump and Ed Nagle (a missionary from  Baguio).       Chaplains of unknown denomination: William Dawson, Joseph  Vanderheiden.       Jewish cantor: Aaron Kliatchko.    Christmas Midnight Mass and Easter Mass were very colorful events  attended by all healthy prisoners. On May 30th of each year  (Decoration Day), the Japanese allowed one thousand prisoners to visit  the cemetery. Chaplain Oliver led the services; Major Iwanaka Oapanese  Camp Commander) presented a large wreath.    Chaplains took turns accompanying the Burial Detail from the morgue to  the cemetery nearly every day-giving graveside services. Chaplains'  visits to the wards of the hospital were much appreciated by the  patients-sick, depressed and underground dying.    Underground: After being in camp for several months, I discovered that  some of the captives were leaving notes (addressed to friends in  Manila) on their beds. In some mysterious way, they were picked up and  delivered in Manila. In a couple weeks there would be an answer, also  left on the bed of the sender.    Sometimes there would be money, medicine and even food.    Looked like a good idea! I didn't inquire about the mechanics of the  Underground. In fact I didn't want to know. I had had amoebic  dysentery with bleeding for four months-with a loss of fifty pounds  weight. Here was a chance to get some medicine.    I had a Spanish friend in Manila, the president of an insurance  company. When he had been in Baguio with his family prior to the war,  he brought his eight-year-old son to me because of a chronic stomach  ailment. I made the diagnosis of \"peptic ulcer\" and treated him with  good results. The family was quite pleased.    So I wrote Jose Olbes a note explaining my predicament.    Sure enough, in two weeks, on my bed was a note, carbazone (medicine)  and twenty pesos. In another two weeks I was feeling better and  gaining strength. I never inquired further about the Underground,  figuring that someday someone would get caught, and the penalty would  be severe.    During the two years that the Underground operated, it undoubtedly  saved the lives of hundreds of prisoners. After the war was over, I  learned the mechanics of the operation:    In the early days of the war, a 31st Infantry Sergeant John Phillips  married a Claire (?) on Bataan. Sgt. John survived Bataan and the  \"Death March,\" but died on July 27, 1942 in the Japanese P.O.W. Camp  No.1 at Cabanatuan.    A few weeks later his wife, Claire, received a note from Chaplain  Frank Tiffany in Cabanatuan, verifying that Sgt. John Phillips had  died of malaria, dysentery and starvation. Frank ended his note with,  \"I beg you do not forget the ones that are left; they are dying by the  hundreds! God Bless You!\" Everlasting (code name). To fill her  emptiness, Claire vowed revenge. Claire returned to Manila; she  obtained false Italian identification papers from the Japanese,  stating that she was born in Manila of Italian parents.    Claire opened a nightclub, The Club Tsubaki (Camelia) and sang her  heart out every night to high-ranking Japanese officers, all the while  raising money to send to the sick and dying at Cabanatuan.    When the Japanese officers became \"high and loquacious,\" she pumped  them for information concerning the movements of Japanese ships and  troops, and forwarded this information to guerilla leaders.    Claire assumed the code name of \"High Pockets,\" because she kept her  valuables in her bra. Once every two weeks, High Pockets \"baked  cookies!\" (That is, collected notes, money and medicines from  prominent citizens in Manila: Juan Elizaldi, Judge Riveria, Lopes, Dr.  and Mrs. Romeo Atienza, Father Lopez, Judge Roxas, and many others.)    A Filipina mestiza, Evangeline Neibert (code name, \"Sassy Suzie\"),  carried \"the cookies\" by train from Manila to the town of Cabanatuan,  where she delivered them to the market.    Naomi Flores (code name, \"Looter\"), a brave Filipina, who had also  lost a husband in prison camp, obtained a Japanese license as a  vegetable peddler and worked in the Cabanatuan market. Naomi hid \"the  cookies\" in the bottom of rice sacks to be taken to camp.    Once or twice a week, the \"Rice Detail\" from Camp #1, went to the  market in Cabanatuan to get some hundred pound sacks of rice for the  mess halls.    In the mess halls, the notes were removed from the sacks of  rice, and delivered to one of the following:    Captain (Chaplain) Frank Tiffany-\"Everlasting\"    Lt. Col. Jack Schwartz, Hosp. C.O.-\"Liver\"    Charles De Maio (U.S. Navy)-\"WOP\"    Lt. Col. Mack (Inspector General)-\"DITTO\"    Captain (Chaplain) Robert Taylor-\"Chap BOB\"    Captain (Chaplain) John Wilson-\"Left Field\"      Helpers delivered \"the cookies\" to the beds of the senders of notes,  and picked up notes for future delivery in Manila.    High Pockets also baked \"cookies\" and collected intelligence for the  guerrilla leader-Major John Boone (code name, \"Compadre\") for delivery  to MacArthur.    The Underground continued for about two years. The Japanese became  suspicious when the prisoners were spending more money in the  commissary than they were being paid by the Japanese.    May 3, 1944: Six carabao drivers were arrested on their return trip  from the market, and taken to jail in Cabanatuan city: Fred Threatt,  Sgt. S.H. Bish, St. Sgt. Virgil Burns, Pvt. Reed Philipps, Tysinger  and Rose.    The Japs seized the rice sacks with the notes, money and medicines in  them.    May 10, 1944: Capt. Pat Bynes, Lee Baldwin, Capt. Jack LeMire, Lt. Bob  Shirk, Sgt. Alexander, Walter Jasten, Bellew, and Cherokensky were  picked up by the Japanese Military Police-along with all their  belongings. That afternoon Gov. P.D. Rogers and Lt. Col. Mack were  nabbed.        May 11, 1944: Sixteen Americans and eight Filipinos were taken  away in a truck. All had their hands tied behind them.        May 12: Jack Shirk and Chaplain Tiffany were taken to Cabanatuan.    May 16: Five carabao drivers were returned to camp. Several prisoners  were placed in \"Sweat Boxes\" in the middle of the field-on one meal  per day: Lt. Col. (Chaplain) Alfred Oliver, Lt. Col. Jack Schwartz,  Capt. (Chaplain) Bob Taylor, Col. Mack Rogers, Threatt, "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/8452"],[0,"Scientific American Supplement, No. 363, December 16, 1882 (#12)"],[1,"of adjoining land, which was bought for the timber.  There are a hoisting works, mill, roasting sheds, and leaching vats on  the ground, and they cover several acres.    On going around with Mr. Ellis, the first place we came to was the mine  proper, which is simply an immense opening in the ground covering about  one half of an acre, and about 80 feet deep. It has an incline running  down into it, by which the ore is hoisted to the surface. Standing on  the brink of this opening and looking down, we could see the men at  work, some drilling, others filling and running the cars to the incline  to be hoisted to the surface.    The ore is found in a sort of chloritic slate and iron pyrites which  follow the ledge all around. The ore itself is a fine-grained pyrite,  with a grayish color, and it is well suited by its sulphur and low  copper contents, as well as by its properties for heap roasting. In heap  roasting, the ore is hand-broken by Chinamen into small lumps before  being hoisted to the surface. From the landing on the surface it is run  out on long tracks under sheds, dumped around a loose brick flue and on  a few sticks of wood formed in the shape of a V, which runs to the flues  to give a draught. Layers of brush are put on at intervals through the  pile. The smaller lumps are placed in the core of the heap, the larger  lumps thrown upon them, and 40 tons of tank residues thrown over all to  exclude excess of air; 500 lb. of salt is then distributed through the  pile, and it is then set afire. After well alight the draught-holes are  closed up, and the pile is left to burn, which it does for six months.  At the expiration of that time the pile is broken into and sorted, the  imperfectly roasted ore is returned to a fresh roast-heap, and the rest  trammed to the      LEACH-VATS.    These are 50 in number, 10 having been recently added. The first 40 are  four feet by six feet and four feet deep, the remaining 10 twice as  large. About two tons of burnt ore is put in the small vats (twice as  much in the larger ones), half the vats being tilled at one time, and  then enough cold water is turned in to cover the ore. Steam is then  injected beneath the ore, thus boiling the water. After boiling for some  time, the steam is turned off and the water allowed to go cold. The  water, which after the boiling process turns to a dark red color, is  then drawn off. This water carries the copper in a state of solution.  The ore is then boiled a second time, after which the tank residues are  thrown out and water kept sprinkling over them. This water collects the  copper still left in the residues, and is then run into a reservoir, and  from the reservoirs still further on into settling tanks, previous to      PRECIPITATION,    and is then conducted through a system of boxes filled with scrap iron,  thus precipitating the copper.    The richer copper liquors which have been drawn from the tanks fire not  allowed to run in with that which comes from the dump heaps. This liquor  is also run into settling tanks, and from them pumped into four large  barrels, mounted horizontally on friction rollers, to which a very slow  motion is given. These barrels are 18 feet long and six feet six inches  deep outside measure. They are built very strongly, and are water-tight.  Ten tons of scrap iron are always kept in each of these barrels, which  are refilled six times daily, complete precipitation being effected in  less than four hours. Each barrel is provided with two safety valves,  inserted in the heads, which open automatically to allow the escape of  gas and steam. The precipitation of the copper in the barrels forms  copper cement. This cement is discharged from the barrels on to screens  which hold any lumps of scrap iron which may be discharged with the  cement. It is then dried by steam, after which it is conveyed into  another tank, left to cool, and then placed in bags ready for shipment,  as copper cement. The building in which the liquor is treated is the  mill part of the property, from which they send out 42 tons monthly of  an average of 85 per cent, of copper cement, this being the average  yield of the mine.    There are 23 white men and 40 Chinamen employed at the mine and the  mill. There are also several wood choppers, etc., on the company's  pay-roll. Eight months' supply of ore is always kept on hand, there  now being 12,000 tons roasting. The mine is now paying regular monthly  dividends, and everything argues well for the continuance of the same.           *       *       *       *       *          SIR WILLIAM THOMSON'S PILE.      The Thomson pile, which is employed with success for putting in action  the siphon recorder, and which is utilized in a certain number of cases  in which an energetic and constant current is needed, is made in two  forms. We shall describe first the one used for demonstration. Each  element of this (Fig. 1) consists of a disk of copper placed at the  bottom of a cylindrical glass vessel, and of a piece of zinc in the form  of a grating placed at the upper part, near the surface of the solution.  A glass tube is placed vertically in the solution, its lower extremity  resting on the copper. Into this tube are thrown some crystals of  sulphate of copper, which dissolve in the liquid, and form a solution of  a greater density than that of the zinc alone, and which, consequently,  cannot reach the zinc by diffusion. In order to retard the phenomenon of  diffusion, a glass siphon containing a cotton wick is placed with one of  its extremities midway between the copper and zinc, and the other in  a vessel outside the element, so that the liquid is sucked up slowly  nearly to its center. The liquid is replaced by adding from the top  either water or a weak solution of sulphate of zinc.    [Illustration: FIG. 1.--THE THOMSON PILE.(Type for demonstration.)]    The greater part of the sulphate of copper that rises through the liquid  by diffusion is carried off by the siphon before reaching the zinc, the  latter being thus surrounded with an almost pure solution of sulphate  of copper having a slow motion from top to bottom. This renewal of the  liquid is so much the more necessary in that the saturated solution of  sulphate of copper has a density of 1.166, and the sulphate of zinc  one of 1.445, There would occur, then, a mixture through inversion of  densities if the solution were allowed to reach a too great amount of  saturation, did not the siphon prevent such a phenomenon by sucking up  the liquid into the part where the mixture tends to take place. The  chemical action that produces the current is identical with that of the  Daniell element.    In its application, this pile is considerably modified in form  and arrangement. Each element (Fig 2) consists of a flat wooden  hopper-shaped trough, about fifty centimeters square, lined with sheet  lead to make it impervious. The bottom is covered with a sheet of copper  and above this there is a zinc grate formed of closely set bars that  allow the liquid to circulate. This grate is provided with a rim which  serves to support a second similar element, and the latter a third,  and soon until there are ten of the elements superposed to form series  mounted for tension. The weight of the elements is sufficient to secure  a proper contact between the zinc and copper of the elements placed  beneath them, such contact being established by means of a band of  copper cut out of the sheet itself, and bent over the trough.    [Illustration: FIG. 2.--THE THOMSON PILE. (Siphon Recorder Type.)]    On account of the large dimensions of the elements, and the proximity  of the two metals, a pile is obtained whose internal resistance is very  feeble, it being always less than a tenth of an ohm when the pile is  in a good state, and the electromotive force being that of the Daniell  element--about 1 08 volts.    Sometimes the zinc is covered with a sheet of parchment which more  thoroughly prevents a mixture of the liquids and a deposit of copper on  the zinc. But such a precaution is not indispensable, if care be taken  to keep up the pile by taking out some of the solution of sulphate of  zinc every day, and adding sulphate of copper in crystals. If the pile  is to remain idle for some time, it is better to put it on a short  circuit in order to use up all the sulphate of copper, the disappearance  of which will be ascertained by the loss of blue color in the liquid. In  current service, on the contrary, a disappearance of the blue color will  indicate an insufficiency of the sulphate, and will be followed by a  considerable reduction in the effects produced by the pile.    The great power of this pile, and its constancy, when it is properly  kept up, constitute features that are indispensable for the proper  working of the siphon recorder--the application for which it was more  especially designed.    This apparatus has been also employed under some circumstances for  producing an electric light and charging accumulators; but such  applications are without economic interest, seeing the enormous  consumption of sulphate of copper during the operation of the pile.  The use of the apparatus is only truly effective in cases where it is  necessary to have, before everything else, an energetic and exceedingly  constant current.--_La Nature_.           *       *       *       *       *          SIEMENS' TELEMETER      The accompanying cut illustrates a telemeter which was exhibited at the  Paris Exhibition of Electricity, and which is particularly interesting  from the fact that it is the first apparatus of this kind. It will be  remembered that the object of a telemeter is to make known at any moment  whatever the distance of a movable object, and that, too, by a direct  reading and without any calculation. In Mr. Siemens' apparatus the  problem is solved in the following manner:    The movable object (very often a vessel) is sighted from two different "]]]
