To themselves they  seem the only wise; to all others, steeped in infatuation; the gods  smile as they look forward to the crisis of cure; to men, the woman  seems an unlovely syren; to women, the man an effeminate boy.    The other form, of intellectual companionship, has become more and  more frequent. Men engaged in public life, literary men, and artists,  have often found in their wives companions and confidants in thought  no less than in feeling. And, as the intellectual development of Woman  has spread wider and risen higher, they have, not unfrequently, shared  the same employment; as in the case of Roland and his wife, who were  friends in the household and in the nation's councils, read, regulated  home affairs, or prepared public documents together, indifferently. It  is very pleasant, in letters begun by Roland and finished by his wife,  to see the harmony of mind, and the difference of nature; one thought,  but various ways of treating it.    This is one of the best instances of a marriage of friendship.    It  was only friendship, whose basis was esteem; probably neither party  knew love, except by name.   Roland was a good man, worthy to esteem,  and be esteemed; his wife as deserving of admiration as able to do  without it.    Madame Roland is the fairest specimen we yet have of her class; as  clear to discern her aim, as valiant to pursue it, as Spenser's  Britomart; austerely set apart from all that did not belong to her,  whether as Woman or as mind. She is an antetype of a class to which  the coming time will afford a field--the Spartan matron, brought by  the culture of the age of books to intellectual consciousness and  expansion. Self-sufficingness, strength, and clearsightedness were, in  her, combined with a power of deep and calm affection. She, too, would  have given a son or husband the device for his shield, \"Return with it  or upon it;\" and this, not because she loved little, but much. The  page of her life is one of unsullied dignity. Her appeal to posterity  is one against the injustice of those who committed such crimes in the  name of Liberty. She makes it in behalf of herself and her husband. I  would put beside it, on the shelf, a little volume, containing a  similar appeal from the verdict of contemporaries to that of mankind,  made by Godwin in behalf of his wife, the celebrated, the by most men  detested, Mary Wolstonecraft. In his view, it was an appeal from the  injustice of those who did such wrong in the name of virtue. Were this  little book interesting for no other cause, it would be so for the  generous affection evinced under the peculiar circumstances. This man  had courage to love and honor this woman in the face of the world's  sentence, and of all that was repulsive in her own past history. He  believed he saw of what soul she was, and that the impulses she had  struggled to act out were noble, though the opinions to which they had  led might not be thoroughly weighed. He loved her, and he defended her  for the meaning and tendency of her inner life. It was a good fact.    Mary Wolstonecraft, like Madame Dudevant (commonly known as George  Sand) in our day, was a woman whose existence better proved the need  of some new interpretation of Woman's Rights than anything she wrote.  Such beings as these, rich in genius, of most tender sympathies,  capable of high virtue and a chastened harmony, ought not to find  themselves, by birth, in a place so narrow, that, in breaking bonds,  they become outlaws. Were there as much room in the world for such, as  in Spenser's poem for Britomart, they would not run their heads so  wildly against the walls, but prize their shelter rather. They find  their way, at last, to light and air, but the world will not take off  the brand it has set upon them. The champion of the Rights of Woman  found, in Godwin, one who would plead that cause like a brother. He  who delineated with such purity of traits the form of Woman in the  Marguerite, of whom the weak St. Leon could never learn to be  worthy,--a pearl indeed whose price was above rubies,--was not false  in life to the faith by which he had hallowed his romance. He acted,  as he wrote, like a brother. This form of appeal rarely fails to touch  the basest man:--\"Are you acting toward other women in the way you  would have men act towards your sister?\" George Sand smokes, wears  male attire, wishes to be addressed as \"Mon frere;\"--perhaps, if she  found those who were as brothers indeed, she would not care whether  she were brother or sister. [Footnote: A note appended by my sister in  this place, in the first edition, is here omitted, because it is  incorporated in another article in this volume, treating of George  Sand more at length.--[ED.]] We rejoice to see that she, who expresses  such a painful contempt for men in most of her works, as shows she  must have known great wrong from them, depicts, in \"La Roche Mauprat,\"  a man raised by the workings of love from the depths of savage  sensualism to a moral and intellectual life. It was love for a pure  object, for a steadfast woman, one of those who, the Italian said,  could make the \"stair to heaven.\"    This author, beginning like the many in assault upon bad institutions,  and external ills, yet deepening the experience through comparative  freedom, sees at last that the only efficient remedy must come from  individual character. These bad institutions, indeed, it may always be  replied, prevent individuals from forming good character, therefore we  must remove them. Agreed; yet keep steadily the higher aim in view.  Could you clear away all the bad forms of society, it is vain, unless  the individual begin to be ready for better. There must be a parallel  movement in these two branches of life. And all the rules left by  Moses availed less to further the best life than the living example of  one Messiah.    Still the mind of the age struggles confusedly with these problems,  better discerning as yet the ill it can no longer bear, than the good  by which it may supersede it. But women like Sand will speak now and  cannot be silenced; their characters and their eloquence alike  foretell an era when such as they shall easier learn to lead true  lives. But though such forebode, not such shall be parents of it.  [Footnote: Appendix E.] Those who would reform the world must show that  they do not speak in the heat of wild impulse; their lives must be  unstained by passionate error; they must be severe lawgivers to  themselves. They must be religious students of the divine purpose with  regard to man, if they would not confound the fancies of a day with  the requisitions of eternal good. Their liberty must be the liberty of  law and knowledge. But as to the transgressions against custom which  have caused such outcry against those of noble intention, it may be  observed that the resolve of Eloisa to be only the mistress of  Abelard, was that of one who saw in practice around her the contract  of marriage made the seal of degradation. Shelley feared not to be  fettered, unless so to be was to be false. Wherever abuses are seen,  the timid will suffer; the bold will protest. But society has a right  to outlaw them till she has revised her law; and this she must be  taught to do, by one who speaks with authority, not in anger or haste.    If Godwin's choice of the calumniated authoress of the \"Rights of  Woman,\" for his honored wife, be a sign of a new era, no less so is an  article to which I have alluded some pages back, published five or six  years ago in one of the English Reviews, where the writer, in doing  fall justice to Eloisa, shows his bitter regret that she lives not now  to love him, who might have known bettor how to prize her love than  did the egotistical Abelard.    These marriages, these characters, with all their imperfections,  express an onward tendency. They speak of aspiration of soul, of  energy of mind, seeking clearness and freedom. Of a like promise are  the tracts lately published by Goodwyn Barmby (the European Pariah, as  he calls himself) and his wife Catharine. Whatever we may think of  their measures, we see in them wedlock; the two minds are wed by the  only contract that can permanently avail, that of a common faith and a  common purpose.    We might mention instances, nearer home, of minds, partners in work  and in life, sharing together, on equal terms, public and private  interests, and which wear not, on any side, the aspect of offence  shown by those last-named: persons who steer straight onward, yet, in  our comparatively free life, have not been obliged to run their heads  against any wall. But the principles which guide them might, under  petrified and oppressive institutions, have made them warlike,  paradoxical, and, in some sense, Pariahs. The phenomena are different,  the law is the same, in all these cases. Men and women have been  obliged to build up their house anew from the very foundation. If they  found stone ready in the quarry, they took it peaceably; otherwise  they alarmed the country by pulling down old towers to get materials.    These are all instances of marriage as intellectual companionship. The  parties meet mind to mind, and a mutual trust is produced, which can  buckler them against a million. They work together for a common,  purpose, and, in all these instances, with the same implement,--the  pen. The pen and the writing-desk furnish forth as naturally the  retirement of Woman as of Man.    A pleasing expression, in this kind, is afforded by the union in the  names of the Howitts. William and Mary Howitt we heard named together  for years, supposing them to be brother and sister; the equality of  labors and reputation, even so, was auspicious; more so, now we find  them man and wife. In his late work on Germany, Howitt mentions his  wife, with pride, as one among the constellation of"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/8649"],[0,"Indian Tales (#12)"],[1,"and are coming across the plain! Get away! Let us  not be seen with the boy!\"    The men waited for an instant, and then, as another shot was fired,  withdrew into the hills, silently as they had appeared.    \"The wegiment is coming,\" said Wee Willie Winkie, confidently, to Miss  Allardyce, \"and it's all wight. Don't cwy!\"    He needed the advice himself, for ten minutes later, when his father came  up, he was weeping bitterly with his head in Miss Allardyce's lap.    And the men of the 195th carried him home with shouts and rejoicings; and  Coppy, who had ridden a horse into a lather, met him, and, to his intense  disgust, kissed him openly in the presence of the men.    But there was balm for his dignity. His father assured him that not only  would the breaking of arrest be condoned, but that the good-conduct badge  would be restored as soon as his mother could sew it on his blouse-sleeve.  Miss Allardyce had told the Colonel a story that made him proud of his  son.    \"She belonged to you, Coppy,\" said Wee Willie Winkie, indicating Miss  Allardyce with a grimy forefinger. \"I _knew_ she didn't ought to go acwoss  ve wiver, and I knew ve wegiment would come to me if I sent Jack home.\"    \"You're a hero, Winkie,\" said Coppy--\"a _pukka_ hero!\"    \"I don't know what vat means,\" said Wee Willie Winkie, \"but you mustn't  call me Winkie any no more, I'm Percival Will'am Will'ams.\"    And in this manner did Wee Willie Winkie enter into his manhood.        THE ROUT OF THE WHITE HUSSARS      It was not in the open fight       We threw away the sword,     But in the lonely watching       In the darkness by the ford.     The waters lapped, the night-wind blew,     Full-armed the Fear was born and grew.     And we were flying ere we knew       From panic in the night.          --_Beoni Bar>/I>.    Some people hold that an English Cavalry regiment cannot run. This is a  mistake. I have seen four hundred and thirty-seven sabres flying over the  face of the country in abject terror--have seen the best Regiment that  ever drew bridle wiped off the Army List for the space of two hours. If  you repeat this tale to the White Hussars they will, in all probability,  treat you severely. They are not proud of the incident.    You may know the White Hussars by their \"side,\" which is greater than that  of all the Cavalry Regiments on the roster. If this is not a sufficient  mark, you may know them by their old brandy. It has been sixty years in  the Mess and is worth going far to taste. Ask for the \"McGaire\" old  brandy, and see that you get it. If the Mess Sergeant thinks that you are  uneducated, and that the genuine article will be lost on you, he will  treat you accordingly. He is a good man. But, when you are at Mess, you  must never talk to your hosts about forced marches or long-distance rides.  The Mess are very sensitive; and, if they think that you are laughing at  them, will tell you so.    As the White Hussars say, it was all the Colonel's fault. He was a new  man, and he ought never to have taken the Command. He said that the  Regiment was not smart enough. This to the White Hussars, who knew that  they could walk round any Horse and through any Guns, and over any Foot on  the face of the earth! That insult was the first cause of offence.    Then the Colonel cast the Drum-Horse--the Drum-Horse of the White Hussars!  Perhaps you do not see what an unspeakable crime he had committed. I will  try to make it clear. The soul of the Regiment lives in the Drum-Horse who  carries the silver kettle-drums. He is nearly always a big piebald Waler.  That is a point of honor; and a Regiment will spend anything you please on  a piebald. He is beyond the ordinary laws of casting. His work is very  light, and he only manoeuvres at a foot-pace. Wherefore, so long as he can  step out and look handsome, his well-being is assured. He knows more about  the Regiment than the Adjutant, and could not make a mistake if he tried.    The Drum-Horse of the White Hussars was only eighteen years old, and  perfectly equal to his duties. He had at least six years' more work in  him, and carried himself with all the pomp and dignity of a Drum-Major of  the Guards. The Regiment had paid Rs.1200 for him.    But the Colonel said that he must go, and he was cast in due form and  replaced by a washy, bay beast, as ugly as a mule, with a ewe-neck,  rat-tail, and cow-hocks. The Drummer detested that animal, and the best of  the Band-horses put back their ears and showed the whites of their eyes at  the very sight of him. They knew him for an upstart and no gentleman. I  fancy that the Colonel's ideas of smartness extended to the Band, and that  he wanted to make it take part in the regular parade movements. A Cavalry  Band is a sacred thing. It only turns out for Commanding Officers'  parades, and the Band Master is one degree more important than the  Colonel. He is a High Priest and the \"Keel Row\" is his holy song. The  \"Keel Row\" is the Cavalry Trot; and the man who has never heard that tune  rising, high and shrill, above the rattle of the Regiment going past the  saluting-base, has something yet to hear and understand.    When the Colonel cast the Drum-Horse of the White Hussars, there was  nearly a mutiny.    The officers were angry, the Regiment were furious, and the Bandsmen  swore--like troopers. The Drum-Horse was going to be put up to  auction--public auction--to be bought, perhaps, by a Parsee and put into a  cart! It was worse than exposing the Inner life of the Regiment to the  whole world, or selling the Mess Plate to a Jew--a Black Jew.    The Colonel was a mean man and a bully. He knew what the Regiment thought  about his action; and, when the troopers offered to buy the Drum-Horse, he  said that their offer was mutinous and forbidden by the Regulations.    But one of the Subalterns--Hogan-Yale, an Irishman--bought the Drum-Horse  for Rs. 160 at the sale, and the Colonel was wroth. Yale professed  repentance--he was unnaturally submissive--and said that, as he had only  made the purchase to save the horse from possible ill-treatment and  starvation, he would now shoot him and end the business. This appeared to  soothe the Colonel, for he wanted the Drum-Horse disposed of. He felt that  he had made a mistake, and could not of course acknowledge it. Meantime,  the presence of the Drum-Horse was an annoyance to him.    Yale took to himself a glass of the old brandy, three cheroots, and his  friend Martyn; and they all left the Mess together. Yale and Martyn  conferred for two hours in Yale's quarters; but only the bull-terrier who  keeps watch over Yale's boot-trees knows what they said. A horse, hooded  and sheeted to his ears, left Yale's stables and was taken, very  unwillingly, into the Civil Lines. Yale's groom went with him. Two men  broke into the Regimental Theatre and took several paint-pots and some  large scenery-brushes. Then night fell over the Cantonments, and there was  a noise as of a horse kicking his loose-box to pieces in Yale's stables.  Yale had a big, old, white Waler trap-horse.    The next day was a Thursday, and the men, hearing that Yale was going to  shoot the Drum-Horse in the evening, determined to give the beast a  regular regimental funeral--a finer one than they would have given the  Colonel had he died just then. They got a bullock-cart and some sacking,  and mounds and mounds of roses, and the body, under sacking, was carried  out to the place where the anthrax cases were cremated; two-thirds of the  Regiment following. There was no Band, but they all sang \"The Place where  the old Horse died\" as something respectful and appropriate to the  occasion. When the corpse was dumped into the grave and the men began  throwing down armfuls of roses to cover it, the Farrier-Sergeant ripped  out an oath and said aloud, \"Why, it ain't the Drum-Horse any more than  it's me!\" The Troop Sergeant-Majors asked him whether he had left his head  in the Canteen. The Farrier-Sergeant said that he knew the Drum-Horse's  feet as well as he knew his own; but he was silenced when he saw the  regimental number burned in on the poor stiff, upturned near-fore.    Thus was the Drum-Horse of the White Hussars buried; the Farrier-Sergeant  grumbling. The sacking that covered the corpse was smeared In places with  black paint; and the Farrier-Sergeant drew attention to this fact. But the  Troop Sergeant-Major of E Troop kicked him severely on the shin, and told  him that he was undoubtedly drunk.    On the Monday following the burial, the Colonel sought revenge on the  White Hussars. Unfortunately, being at that time temporarily in Command of  the Station, he ordered a Brigade field-day. He said that he wished to  make the Regiment \"sweat for their damned insolence,\" and he carried out  his notion thoroughly. That Monday was one of the hardest days in the  memory of the White Hussars. They were thrown against a skeleton-enemy,  and pushed forward, and withdrawn, and dismounted, and \"scientifically  handled\" in every possible fashion over dusty country, till they sweated  profusely. Their only amusement came late in the day when they fell upon  the battery of Horse Artillery and chased it for two miles. This was a  personal question, and most of the troopers had money on the event; the  Gunners saying openly that they had the legs of the White Hussars. They  were wrong. A march-past concluded the campaign, and when the Regiment got  back to their Lines, the men were coated with dirt from spur to  chin-strap.    The White Hussars have one great and peculiar privilege. They won it at  Fontenoy, I think.    Many Regiments possess special rights such as wearing collars with undress  uniform, or a bow of riband between the shoulders, or red and white roses  in their helmets on certain days of the year. Some rights are connected  with regimental saints, and some with regimental successes. All are valued  highly; but none so highly as the right of "]]]
