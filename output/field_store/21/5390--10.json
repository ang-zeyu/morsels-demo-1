They are all published in one volume, together  with a translation of the Life of Miltiades and Cymon, from Cornelius  Nepos; the first edition was in 1725.    The most considerable of them are the following,      1. The Muse's Choice, or the Progress of Wit.      2. On Friendship. To Colonel Stanhope.      3. To Mr. Addison, occasioned by the news of    the victory obtained over the Rebels in Scotland,    by his Grace the Duke of Argyle.      4. To Lady Catherine Manners.      5. The Lovers Parting.      6. The Retreat.      7. An Epistle from a Half-pay Officer in the    Country, to his Friend in Town.      8. Upon Religious Solitude; occasioned by    reading the Inscription on the Tomb of Casimir    King of Poland, who abdicated his Crown, and    spent the remainder of his life in the Abbey of    St. Germains, near Paris, where he lies interred.      9. A Pastoral in Imitation of Virgil's Second    Eclogue.      10. The 2d, 3d, and 4th Elegies of the Fourth    Book of Tibullus.      11. Elegy. Sylvia to Amintor, in Imitation of    Ovid. After Sylvia is enjoyed, she gives this Advice    to her sex.      Trust not the slight defence of female pride.    Nor in your boasted honour much confide;    So still the motion, and so smooth the dart,    It steals unfelt into the heedless heart.    A Prologue to the Tragedy of Sir Walter Raleigh, and an Epilogue  to Mr. Southern's Spartan Dame. In the former he has the following  beautiful lines on Ambition;      Ambition is a mistress few enjoy!    False to our hopes, and to our wishes coy;    The bold she bafflles, and defeats the strong;    And all are ruined who pursue her long;    Yet so bewitching are her fatal charms,    We think it heav'n to die within her arms.    Major Pack obliged the world with some Memoirs of the Life of Mr.  Wycherley, which are prefixed to Theobald's edition of that author.  Mr. Jacob mentions a piece of his which he saw in MS. entitled  Religion and Philosophy, which, says he, with his other works,  demonstrate the author to be a polite writer, and a man of wit and  gallantry.    This amiable gentleman died at Aberdeen in Scotland, in the month of  September 1728, colonel Montague's regiment, in which he was then a  major, being quartered there.      [Footnote A: Vide Jacob's Lives.]           *       *       *       *       *          Sir WILLIAM DAWES, Baronet (Archbishop of YORK,)      This revd. prelate was descended from an ancient, and honourable  family in the county of Essex; he was educated at Merchant-Taylor's  school, London, and from thence elected to St. John's College in  Oxford, of which he was afterwards fellow.    He was the youngest of four brothers, three of whom dying young, the  title, and estate of the family fell to him. As soon as he had taken  his first degree in arts, and upon the family estate devolving to him,  he resigned his fellowship, and left Oxford. For some time he gave his  attention to the affairs of his estate, but finding his inclination  lead him more to study, than rural affairs, he entered into holy  orders. Sir William did not long remain in the church without  preferment; his fortune, and family assisted him to rise; for it often  happens that these advantages will do much more for a man, as well in  the ecclesiastical, as in other classes of life, than the brightest  parts without them. Before he was promoted to the mitre, he was made  master of Catherine Hall in Cambridge, chaplain to Queen Anne, and  dean of Bocking.    In the year 1708 he was consecrated bishop of Chester, and in 1713  was translated to the archbishopric of York. While he was at the  university, before he went into orders, he wrote the Anatomy of  Atheism, a Poem, dedicated to Sir George Darcy Bart. printed in the  year 1701, 8vo.    The design of this piece, as his lordship declares in the preface,  'is to expose the folly of those men, who are arrived at that pitch of  impudence and prophaneness, that they think it a piece of wit to  deny the Being of a God, and to laugh at that which they cannot argue  against.' Such characters are well described in the following lines,      See then our Atheist all the world oppose,    And like Drawcansir make all men his foes.    See with what fancy pride he does pretend,    His miser father's notions to amend,    Huffs Plutarch, Plato, Pliny, Seneca,    And bids even Cicero himself give way.    Tells all the world, they follow a false light,    And he alone, of all mankind is right.    Thus, like a madman, who when all alone,    Thinks himself King, and every chair a throne,    Drunk with conceit, and foolish impudence,    He prides himself in his abounding sense.    This prelate is said to have united the gentleman, and the divine,  which both shone out with equal lustre in him. He was esteemed in his  time a very popular preacher; his piety was great, and conspicuous;  his charity and benevolence equalled by few, and his good nature, and  humanity the most extensive.    Our author died in the 53d year of his age, April 30, 1724. We have  no account of any other of his grace's poetical works, probably the  business of his high station diverted his mind from the amusements of  poetry.    The archbishop has written several sermons upon the Eternity of Hell  Torments, a doctrine which he has laboured to vindicate; also sermons  upon various other subjects.           *       *       *       *       *          WILLIAM CONGREVE, Esq;      This gentleman was descended from the ancient house of Congreve in  Staffordshire, but authors differ as to the place of his birth; some  contend that he was born in Ireland[A], others that he drew his first  breath at the village of Bardsa, near Leeds in Yorkshire, which was  the estate of a near relation of his by his mother's side. Mr. Jacob,  in his preface to the Lives of the Poets, has informed us, that he  had the advice and assistance of Mr. Congreve in that work, who  communicated to him many particulars of the lives of cotemporary  writers, as well as of himself, and as Mr. Congreve can hardly be  thought ignorant of the place of his own birth, and Mr. Jacob has  asserted it to be in England, no room is left to doubt of it. The  learned antiquary of Ireland, Sir James Ware, has reckoned our author  amongst his own country worthies, from the relation of Southern; but  Mr. Congreve's own account, if Jacob may be relied on, is more than  equal to that of Southern, who possibly might be mistaken.    About the year 1671, or 1672, our author was born, and his father  carried him, when a child, into Ireland, where he then had a command  in the army, but afterwards was entrusted with the management of a  considerable estate, belonging to the noble family of Burlington,  which fixed his residence there[B]. Mr. Congreve received the first  tincture of letters in the great school of Kilkenny, and, according  to common report, gave early proofs of a poetical genius; his first  attempt in poetry was a copy of verses on the death of his master's  Magpye.    He went from the school of Kilkenny to the university of Dublin, where  under the direction of Dr. George Ash, he acquired a general knowledge  of the classics. His father, who was desirous that his studies should  be directed to a profitable employment, sent him over to England  a little after the revolution, and placed him as a student in the  Middle-Temple. But the severe study of the Law was so ill adapted to  the sprightly genius of Congreve, that he never attempted to reconcile  himself to a way of life, for which he had the greatest aversion. But  however he disappointed his friends with respect to the proficiency  they expected him to make in the Law; yet it is certain he was not  negligent in those studies to which his genius led him.    Mr. Congreve's first performance, written when but a youth of  seventeen, was a Novel, dedicated to Mrs. Katherine Leveson, which  gave proof, not only of a great vivacity of wit, but also a fluency of  stile, and a solid judgment. He was conscious that young men in their  early productions generally aimed at a florid stile, and enthusiastic  descriptions, without any regard to the plot, fable, or subserviency  of the parts; for this reason he formed a new model, and gave an  example how works of that kind should be written. He pursued a regular  plan, observed a general moral, and carried on a connexion, as well as  distinction, between his characters.    This performance is entitled Incognita, or Love and Duty Reconciled;  it has been asserted that this is a real history, and though the scene  is laid in Italy, the adventures happened in England; it is not our  business to enter into the secret history of this entertaining piece,  or to attempt giving the reader a key to what the writer took so much  pains to conceal. It appears from this piece, that Mr. Congreve aimed  at perfection from the very beginning, and his design in writing this  novel, was to shew, how novels ought to be written. Let us hear what  he says himself, and from thence we shall entertain a higher opinion  of his abilities, than could possibly be raised by the warmest  commendations. After very judiciously observing, that there is the  same relation between romances and novels as between tragedy and  comedy, he proceeds thus: 'Since all traditions must indisputably give  glace to the drama, and since there is no possibility of giving that  life to the writing, or repetition of a story, which it has in the  action; I resolved in another beauty to imitate dramatic writing,  namely, in the design, contexture, and result in the plot. I have  not observed it before in a novel. Some I have seen begin with an  unexpected accident which has been the only surprizing part of  the "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/12019"],[0,"Queen Hortense: A Life Picture of the Napoleonic Era (#13)"],[1," that he too has no other ambition than to become  your husband? Do you think that he loves you for your own sake alone?\"    \"I know it,\" said the young girl, with beaming eyes; \"Duroc has told me  that he loved me, and me only. He has sworn eternal fidelity and love to  me. Both of us ask for nothing more than to belong to each other.\"    Josephine shrugged her shoulders almost compassionately.    \"Suppose,\" she rejoined, \"that I were to affirm that Duroc is willing to  marry you, only because he is ambitious, and thinks that Bonaparte would  then advance him the more rapidly?\"    \"It is a slander--it is impossible!\" exclaimed Hortense, glowing with  honest indignation; \"Duroc loves me, and his noble soul is far from all  selfish calculation.\"    \"And if I were to prove the contrary to you?\" asked Josephine, irritated  by her daughter's resistance, and made cruel by her alarm for her  own fortunes.    Hortense turned pale, and her face, which had been so animated, so  beautiful, a moment before, blanched as though the icy chill of death  had passed over it.    \"If you can prove to me,\" she said, in a hollow tone, \"that Duroc loves  me only through ambitious motives, I am ready to give him up, and marry  whom you will.\"    Josephine triumphed. \"Duroc gets back to-day from his journey,\" she  replied, \"and in three days more I will give you the proof that he does  not love you, but the family alliance which you present.\"    Hortense had heard only the first of her mother's words: \"Duroc returns  to-day.\" What cared she for all the rest? She should see him again--she  should read consolation and love's assurance in his handsome manly face;  not that she needed this to confirm her confidence, for she believed in  him, and not the shadow of a doubt obscured her blissful greeting.    Meanwhile, Josephine's pretty hands were busy drawing the meshes of this  intrigue tighter every moment. She absolutely required a supporting ally  in the family, _against_ the family itself; and for this reason Louis  must become the husband of Hortense.    Bonaparte himself was against this union, and was quite resolved to  marry Duroc to his step-daughter. But Josephine managed to shake his  resolve, by means of entreaties, representations, caresses, and little  endearments, and even succeeded in such eloquent argument to show that  Duroc did not cherish any love whatever for Hortense, but wanted to make  an ambitious speculation out of her, that Bonaparte resolved, at least,  to put his friend to the test, and, if Josephine turned out to be right,  to marry Hortense to his own brother.    After this last interview with Josephine, Bonaparte went back into his  office, where he found Bourrienne, as ever, at the writing-desk.    \"Where is Duroc?\" he hastily asked.    \"He has gone out--to the opera, I think.\"    \"So soon as he returns tell him that I have promised him Hortense--that  he shall marry her. But I want the wedding to take place in two days, at  the farthest. I give Hortense five hundred thousand francs, and I  appoint Duroc to the command of the eighth military division. On the day  after his wedding he shall start with his wife for Toulon, and we shall  live apart. I will not have a son-in-law in my house; and, as I want to  see these matters brought to an end, at last, let me know to-day whether  Duroc accepts my propositions.\"    \"I don't think that he will, general.\"    \"Very good! Then, in that case, Hortense shall marry my brother Louis.\"    \"Will she consent?\"    \"She will have to consent, Bourrienne.\"    Duroc came in at a late hour that evening, and Bourrienne told him, word  for word, the ultimatum of the first consul.    Duroc listened to him attentively; but, as Bourrienne went on with his  communication, his countenance grew darker and darker.    \"If such be the case,\" he exclaimed at last, when Bourrienne had got  through, \"if Bonaparte will do nothing more than that for his  son-in-law, I must forego a marriage with Hortense, however painful it  may be to do so: and then, instead of going to Toulon, I can remain in  Paris.\" And, as he ceased to speak, Duroc took up his hat, without a  trace of excitement or concern, and departed.    That same evening, Josephine received from her husband his full consent  to the marriage of her daughter to Louis Bonaparte.    On that very evening, too, Josephine informed her daughter that Duroc  had not withstood the test, and that he had now relinquished her,  through ambition, as, through ambition, he had previously feigned  to love her.    Hortense gazed at her mother with tearless eyes. She had not a word of  complaint or reproach to utter; she was conscious merely that a  thunder-bolt had just fallen, and had forever dashed to atoms her love,  her hopes, her future, and her happiness.    But she no longer had the strength and the will to escape the evil that  had flung its meshes around her; she submitted meekly to it. She had  been betrayed by love itself; and what cared she now for her future, her  embittered, bloomless, scentless life, when _he_ had deceived her  --_he_, the only one whom she had loved?    The next morning Hortense stepped, self-possessed and smiling, into  Josephine's private cabinet, and declared that she was ready to fulfil  her mother's wishes and marry Louis Bonaparte.    Josephine clasped her in her arms, with exclamations of delight. She  little knew what a night of anguish, of wailing, of tears, and of  despair, Hortense had struggled through, or that her present smiling  unconcern was nothing more than the dull hopelessness of a worn-out  heart. She did not see that Hortense smiled now only in order that  Duroc should not observe that she suffered. Her love for him was dead,  but her maidenly pride had survived, and it dried her tears, and  conjured up a smile to her struggling lips; it, too, enabled her to  declare that she was ready to accept the husband whom her mother might  present to her.    Thus, Josephine had accomplished her purpose; she had made one of  Bonaparte's brothers her son. Now there remained the question whether  she should attain her other aim through that son, and whether she should  find in him a support against the intrigues of the other brothers of the  first consul.        CHAPTER III.    CONSUL AND KING.    There was only two days' interval between the betrothal of the young  couple and their wedding; and on the 7th of January, 1802, Hortense was  married to Louis Bonaparte, the youngest brother but one of the first  consul. Bonaparte, who contented himself with the civil ceremony, and  had never given his own union with Josephine the sanction of the Church,  was less careless and unconcerned with regard to this youthful alliance,  which had, indeed, great need of the blessing of Heaven, in order to  prove a source of any good fortune to the young couple. Perhaps he  reasoned that the consciousness of the indissoluble character of their  union would lead them to an honorable and upright effort for a mutual  inclination; perhaps it was because he simply wished to render their  separation impossible. Cardinal Caprara was called into the Tuileries,  after the civil ceremony concluded, and had to bestow the blessing of  God and of the Church upon the bride and bridegroom.    Yet, not one word or one glance had thus far been interchanged by the  young couple. It was in silence that they stepped, after the ceremonies  were over, into the carriage that bore them to their new home, in the  same small residence in the Rue de la Victoire which her mother had  occupied in the first happy weeks of her youthful union with Bonaparte.    Now, another young, newly-married pair were making their entry into this  dwelling, but love did not enter with them; affection and happiness did  not shine in their faces, as had been the case with Bonaparte and  Josephine. The eyes of Hortense were dimmed with tears, and the  countenance of her young husband was dark and gloomy. For, on his side,  he, too, felt no love for this young woman; and, as she never forgave  him for having accepted her hand, although he knew that she loved  another, he, in like manner, could never forgive her having consented to  be his wife, although he had not been the one to solicit it, and  although he had never told her that he loved her. Both had bowed to the  will of him who gave the law, not merely to all France, but also to his  own family, and who had already become the lord and master of the  republic. Both had married through obedience, not for love; and the  consciousness of this compulsion rose like an impassable wall between  these two otherwise tender and confiding young hearts. In the  consciousness of this compulsion, too, they would not even try to love  one another, or find in each other's society the happiness that they  were forbidden to seek elsewhere.    Pale and mournful, in splendid attire, but with a heavy heart, did  Hortense make her appearance at the _fetes_ which were given in honor of  her marriage; and it was with a beclouded brow and averted face that  Louis Bonaparte received the customary congratulations. While every one  around them exhibited a cheerful and joyous bearing, while parties were  given in their honor, and people danced and sang, the young couple only,  of all present, were dull and sad. Louis avoided speaking to Hortense,  and she turned her gaze away from him, possibly so that he might not  read in it her deep and angry aversion.    But she had to accept her lot; and, since she was thus indissolubly  bound up with another, she had to try to live with that other. Hortense,  externally so gentle and yielding, so full of maiden coyness and  delicacy, nevertheless possessed a strong and resolute soul, and, in the  noble pride of her wounded heart, was unwilling to give any one the  right to pity her. Her soul wept, but she restrained her tears and still  tried to smile, were it only that Duroc might not perceive the traces  "]]]
