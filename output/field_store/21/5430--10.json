I had scarcely time to complete a sketch of these hills before the sun  went down. Mr. White took bearings of the principal summits, and at the  same time obtained their respective names from the native. The range that  we had ascended consisted of porphyry, having a base of fawn-coloured  compact felspar, with grains of quartz, and crystals of common felspar.  We reached the tents, distant from the hill a mile and a half, as night  came on. The moon soon rose in cloudless splendour, and received our  particular attention, for we were uncertain how soon we should be  compelled to depend on the chronometer alone for the longitude, which  thus far we had been enabled to connect with the survey of the colony by  means of Barragundy and other hills towards Liverpool range.    December 16.    We proceeded over a perfectly level surface, wooded rather thickly with a  broad-leaved eucalyptus, and the Acacia pendula. The air was cool, and a  most refreshing breeze met us in the face during the whole of this day's  journey; the thermometer at sunrise was only 52 degrees.    THE RIVER NAMOI.    After travelling upwards of ten miles we crossed the corner of an open  plain, and five miles further on we reached the bank of the river Namoi,  and encamped about noon. This stream, having received the Conadilly from  the left bank, had here an important appearance: the breadth of the water  was 100 feet, its mean depth 11 3/4 feet; the current half a mile per  hour, and the height of the banks above the water 37 feet. The course of  the Muluerindie, from the junction of the Peel to that of the Conadilly,  is somewhat to the southward of west. Below the junction of the  Conadilly, where the well-known native name is the Namoi, it pursues a  north-west course. The men threw in their lines, but caught during the  day only two fishes, similar to those we obtained at Perimbungay. The  alluvial bed of the stream consisted of marl, fragments of red quartz,  and other rocks. A very hard yellow calcareous sandstone also occurred in  the bank.    December 17.    Leaving the ground at an early hour, the party travelled for about two  miles along the riverbank, the stream appearing deeper and broader as we  proceeded. Six miles on we came upon a narrow branch from the river,  which we avoided by turning a little to the right.    STOCKYARD OF THE BUSHRANGER.    We next reached a very large stockyard which the natives said had  belonged to George The Barber, meaning The Bushranger. We saw besides the  remains of a house, the gunyas, or huts, of a numerous encampment of  natives; and the bones of bullocks were strewed about in great abundance,  plainly enough showing the object of the stockyard, and that of The  Barber's alliance with the aborigines of these parts. The whole country  was on fire; but although our guide frequently drew our attention to  recent footmarks, we could not discover a single native.    We encamped near this stockyard, beside a lagoon of still water which was  as broad and deep as the main stream. The water was nearly on a level  with the surface of the surrounding country, and was obviously supplied  from the overflowings of the Namoi, then at some distance to the  westward.    SINGULAR FISH.    We caught some small fish, two of them being of a rather singular kind,  resembling an eel in the head and shape of the tail, although as short in  proportion to their thickness as most other kinds of fish. (Figure 2  Plate 6.)* We found granular felspar in the bank.    (*Footnote. For a description of this fish see note to Chapter 1.5  below.)    VIEW FROM TANGULDA.    The pic of Tangulda lay due north of our camp, distant about two miles;  and in the afternoon I set out on foot to ascend it, accompanied by Mr.  White and the carpenter. On approaching its base, the bold rocks near the  summit were reddened by the rays of a sun setting in smoke; while the  whole mass of woody hill below that summit seemed more imposing, as it  overhung a level country, which had no visible horizon. We reached the  top at a little after four P.M. by a steep and rocky ascent; and although  the atmosphere was dim, the view was very important. I saw the Namoi's  course through a cluster of hills, between which it passed to a lower  country in the north-west. These hills were connected on the right bank  with the pic on which we stood, and with a low range in the east and  north-east, whose western extremities appeared to terminate on the vale  of the Namoi, as far northward as I could then see them in perspective.  The Barber had positively stated that the only practicable way to the big  river was north-east by north from Tangulda; and it now appeared that the  lowest part of this range lay exactly in that direction. Some bold and  remarkable hills appeared at no great distance to the right of that line;  but the country between Tangulda and the lowest part of that horizon  seemed so level or gently undulating that I felt it my duty, before I  traced the Namoi further, to explore the country in the direction so  particularly described by The Bushranger. On my return to the camp in the  evening, I made a drawing of the eel-fish, which we had caught early in  the day. (Figure 2 Plate 6.)    December 18.    We now quitted the line of the Namoi, and proceeded in the direction  north-east by north from Tangulda. We thus continued our route in a  straight line up a long valley, until at ten A.M. we reached the crest of  the low range previously mentioned. The rock consisted of a calcareous  breccia, with water-worn pebbles. The carts had ascended to the crest  without difficulty, and the descent to the country beyond was equally  favourable. Halfway down, the dogs killed a female kangaroo, with a  nearly full-grown young one, which she retained to the last, within her  pouch. The death of no animal can excite more sympathy than that of one  of these inoffensive creatures. The country beyond the low range was more  open for two miles; the only trees being ironbark.    CUTTING THROUGH A THICK SCRUB.    At 15 miles we met an impenetrable scrub of forest oak (casuarina)  through which no passage appearing near, we were compelled, hot as the  day was, to cut our way with axes where the trees were smallest and least  numerous. We thus cleared our course for a mile and a half, when we had  the good fortune to see once more an open forest before us, and after a  journey of eighteen miles the party encamped on a dry watercourse, but  without much prospect of finding any water. We had carried eleven gallons  from our last camp, but the men had already experienced the full benefit  of this, in cutting through the scrub, during a hot wind, after having  travelled fifteen miles.    When the camp was fixed, I rode forward with Mr. White and the native,  and soon entered an extensive valley beyond which I could just perceive,  through the general smoke, a majestic chain of mountains extending to the  westward. I never felt less love for the picturesque than at that time,  for grand as the outline was, I could perceive no opening by which I  could hope to cross it.    WANT OF WATER.    Our present urgent want however was water, and fortunately, at a distance  of upwards of four miles from the camp, we reached the stream watering  that valley, and which we thankfully saluted with our parched lips, its  waters being cool and clear.    MARKS OF NATIVES' FEET.    Imprinted on their sandy margin however our native guide discovered,  apparently with horror, the fresh traces of human feet. The trees bore  numerous marks of the mogo or stone hatchet, the use of which  distinguishes the barbarous from the civil blackfellows, who all use iron  tomahawks. Although Mr. Brown made the woods echo with his cooeys their  inhabitants remained silent and concealed, a circumstance which seemed to  distress him very much.    On returning to the party, we received the agreeable intelligence that  some very good water had been found in a deep hole within a short  distance of the tents. The supply however was not sufficient for the  bullocks, which were consequently restless, and seemed so much disposed  to ramble during the night that two men placed in charge found it  extremely difficult to keep them together. This difficulty suggested the  plan which I on subsequent occasions adopted, of confining these animals  at night, within a temporary stockyard of ropes tied between trees.    MAULE'S RIVER.    December 19.    We left the ground at six A.M. and in an hour and half arrived at the  stream of the valley, which I now named Maule's river. Here, leaving Mr.  White with the party to encamp, that the cattle might be watered and  refreshed during the day, I proceeded with the native and two men to  examine the mountains before us.    A GRILLED SNAKE.    As we advanced along a rising ground, the native discovered a dog, and on  following it to a little brook, we came to a fire, with a large snake  roasting upon it; and a wooden water-vessel on the ground beside it. The  reptile was evidently the intended breakfast of somebody whom our  approach had disturbed. Mr. Brown soon discovered that the fugitives were  females, and, following their track, he found a bag, apparently thrown  down in hasty flight. He called loudly and repeatedly, at the same time  tracing the footsteps through the long grass into a rocky glen, but no  person appeared.    IMPEDED BY A LOFTY RANGE OF MOUNTAINS.    We placed the grilled snake, as it seemed quite cooked, within the wooden  bowl, and we left also a head-band (uluguer) which we had found near the  fire, and we then continued our journey up the mountains. This range  consisted of a different rock from any I had seen in the country, a  chocolate-coloured trapean conglomerate. A very dark colour distinguished  these rocky masses, which terminated in"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/12929"],[0,"A Voyage to Terra Australis — Volume 1 (#13)"],[1,"at E. S. E. The soundings  increased from 5 to 7 fathoms; and afterwards varied between these  depths, until noon; when the latitude observed was 9 deg. 42' south.* The  Brothers then bore S. 64 deg. E.; Mount Cornwallis N. 38 deg. E; and a long, low  island (Turn-again., of Bligh,) N. 35 deg. to 58 deg. W. At three p.m. the reefs  were so numerous, that the ships were obliged to anchor, until the boats  could sound for a passage: the depth here was 41/2 fathoms, on a bottom of  rotten stones and coral.    [* This latitude is from 4' to 6' more _south_ than captain Bligh's  positions; and the same difference occurs in all the observations, where  a comparison can be made.]    July 31. They weighed, and hauled the wind eastward, to pass round  Turn-again Island; bearing away occasionally to avoid small reefs: the  soundings 51/2 to 4 fathoms. After passing round, they anchored in 5  fathoms; until the boats should sound between the reefs which appeared on  every side: Turn-again Island then bore S. 56 deg. to 83 deg. W. about two  leagues, Mount Cornwallis N. 56 deg. E., the Brothers S. 50 deg. E.; the latitude  observed was 9 deg. 32', and longitude from four sights of the sun and moon,  140 deg. 58' east. Next afternoon, in proceeding to the north-westward, the  Chesterfield struck upon a bank in eight feet water; but the coral giving  way to the ship, she went over without injury. In the evening, they both  anchored in 41/2 fathoms, gravel and shells; Mount Cornwallis bearing E. 1/4  S., and a long tract of land from N. W. by N. to N. E., at the distance  of five or six leagues. Turn-again Island bore S. S. E. 3/4 E. to S. 1/2 W.,  four miles; and thither the ships ran on Aug. 3, and anchored in 33/4  fathoms, fine sand, within a quarter of a mile of the shore; the extremes  bearing S. 58 deg. E. to 60 deg. W. The purpose for which they came to this  island, was to procure wood, water, and refreshments; during the time  necessary for the boats to explore a passage through the innumerable  reefs and banks, which occupy this part of the Strait.    Messieurs Bampton and Alt remained here seventeen days; being afraid to  move with the strong south-east winds which blew during the greater part  of the time. Turn-again Island is flat, low, and swampy; and about three  miles in length, by half that space in breadth. (Mr. Bampton's chart  makes it the double of these dimensions; and, generally, the islands in  it exceed the description of the journal in about the same proportion:  the journal seems to be the preferable authority.) The reefs which  surround Turn-again Island, extend a great distance to the east and west;  particularly in the latter direction, where there are many dry sand  banks. The island is mostly over-run with mangroves; and at the top of  the flood, the wood cutters were obliged to work in the water; and were,  at all times, exceedingly annoyed with musketoes. The island is said, in  the journal, to be in 9 deg. 34; south and 140 deg. 55' east; which is 3' to the  south and 1 deg. 24' west of its situation in the chart of captain Bligh.    No other refreshment than small quantities of fish, crabs, and  shell-fish, being procurable here, the ships crews were further reduced  in their short allowance. With respect to fresh water, their situation  was still worse: None could be obtained upon Turn-again Island; and had  not captain Bampton ingeniously contrived a _still_, their state would  have been truly deplorable. He caused a cover, with a hole in the centre,  to be fitted by the carpenter upon a large cooking pot; and over the hole  he funded an inverted tea kettle, with the spout cut off. To the stump of  the spout, was fitted a part of the tube of a speaking trumpet; and this  was lengthened by a gun barrel, which passed through a cask of salt  water, serving as a cooler. From this machine, good fresh water, to the  amount of twenty-five to forty gallons per day, was procured; and  obtained a preference to that contained in the few casks remaining in the  Hormuzeer.    By Aug. 20., when the weather had become more moderate, the boats had  sounded amongst the reefs in all directions; but there appeared to be no  practicable passage out of this labyrinth, except to the north-west. In  that direction the ships proceeded three hours, in from 6 to 3 fathoms.  Next afternoon, they steered westward, with the flood tide; and again  anchored in 3 fathoms, sand and gravel. The coast of New Guinea then  extended from N. by E. 1/4 E. to N. W. 3/4 N.; and the north-west end of a  long island, to which the name of _Talbot_ was given, bore N. by E. 1/2 E.  nine or ten miles.    Aug. 22, At day-light they followed the long boat to the westward., in  soundings from 21/2 to 4 fathoms. At seven o'clock, the Hormuzeer grounded  in 2 fathoms; upon a bank whence Talbot's Island bore N. N. E. to E. N.  E., eight or ten miles, and where the observed latitude was 9 deg. 27' south.  She remained upon this bank until the morning of the 24th; when Mr.  Bampton got into a channel of 13 fathoms, which had been found by the  boats, and the ship did not appear to have received other damage, than  the loss of the false keel. The _still_ continued to be kept at work, day  and night.    Aug. 27. Messieurs Bampton and Alt proceeded onward in a track which had  been sounded by the boats. At sunset, they came to, in 4 fathoms; the  extremes of New Guinea then bearing N. W. by W. to N. E. by E., three or  four leagues. Some further progress was made next morning; and at noon,  when at anchor in 33/4 fathoms, and in latitude 9 deg. 261/2', an island was  discovered bearing S. W. 3/4 S. five or six leagues; which received,  eventually, the name of DELIVERANCE ISLAND.    Aug. 29. The Hormuzeer grounded at low water; from which it appeared that  the tide had fallen twelve feet, though then at the neaps. When the ship  floated, they made sail to the westward; and deepened the water to 9 and  12 fathoms. At noon, it had again shoaled to 6; Deliverance Island  bearing S. S. W. 1/2 W. nine or ten miles, and New Guinea N. W. to N. by E.  1/2 E. four or five leagues: latitude observed 9 deg. 25' south. After  proceeding a little further westward, they anchored in 5 fathoms.    Aug. 30. The soundings varied as before, between 4 and 10 fathoms: the  bottom, rotten coral intermixed with sand. At noon, when the latitude was  9 deg. 21', Deliverance Island was just in sight from the deck, in the S. E.  by S.; and the extremes of New Guinea bore N. E. by E. to N. W. 1/2 W., ten  or twelve miles.* In the afternoon, the depth again decreased to 4  fathoms, and obliged them to anchor until morning. On the 31st, the ships  appear to have steered south-westward, leaving on the starbord hand a  very extensive bank, on which the long boat had 2 fathoms water: the  soundings from the Hormuzeer were from 3 to 7 fathoms. At noon, the  latitude was 9 deg. 27', and no land in sight. The soundings then increased  gradually; and at sunset, no bottom could be found at 40 fathoms. A swell  coming from S. S. W. announced an open sea in that direction; and that  the dangers of Torres' Strait were, at length, surmounted.    [* Mr. Bampton's chart and journal are more at variance here than in the  preceding parts of the Strait, and I have found it very difficult to  adjust them; but have attempted it in Plate XIII.]    This passage of the Hormuzeer and Chesterfield in _seventy-two_ days,  with that made in _nineteen_, by the captains Bligh and Portlock,  displayed the extraordinary dangers of the Strait; and appear to have  deterred all other commanders from following them, up to the time of the  Investigator. Their accounts confirm the truth of Torres having passed  through it, by showing the correctness of the sketch contained in his  letter to the King of Spain.    CONCLUSIVE REMARKS.    The sole remaining information, relative to the North Coast of Terra  Australis, was contained in a note, transcribed by Mr. Dalrymple, from a  work of burgomaster WITSEN upon the _Migration of Mankind_. The place of  which the burgomaster speaks, is evidently on the coast of Carpentaria,  near the head of the Gulph; but it is called _New Guinea; and he wrote in  1705_. The note is as follows; but upon whose authority it was given,  does not appear:    \"In 16 deg. 10' south, longitude 159 deg. 17'\" (east of Teneriffe, or between  142 deg. and 143 deg. east of Greenwich,) \"the people swam on board of a Dutch  ship; and when they received a present of a piece of linen, they laid it  upon their head in token of gratitude: Every where thereabout, all the  people are malicious. They use arrows, and bows of such a length, that  one end rests on the ground when shooting. They have also _hazeygaeys_  and _kalawaeys_, and attacked the Dutch; but did not know the execution  of the guns.\" On summing up the whole of the knowledge which had been  acquired of the North Coast, it will appear, that natural history,  geography, and navigation had still much to learn of this part of the  world; and more particularly, that they required the accomplishment of  the following objects:    1st. _A general survey of TORRES' STRAIT_. The navigation from the  Pacific, or Great Ocean to all parts of India, and to the Cape of Good  Hope, would be greatly facilitated, if a passage through the Strait,  moderately free from danger, could be discovered; since _five or six  weeks_ of the usual route, by the north of New Guinea or the more eastern  islands, would thereby be saved. Notwithstanding the great obstacles  which navigators had encountered in some parts of the Strait, there was  still room to hope, that an examination of the whole, made with care and  perseverance, would bring such a passage to light. A survey of it was,  therefore, an object much to be desired; not only for the merchants and  seamen trading to these parts, but also from the benefits which would  certainly accrue therefrom to"]]]
