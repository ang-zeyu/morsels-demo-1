Not till the  Great Day.\"    What the Great Day might be Roland could not even faintly conjecture. He  could only hope that it would also be a remote one.    \"And now,\" said the Senorita, throwing a cloak about her shoulders, \"you  come away with me to my house. My friends are there awaiting us. They  will be glad and proud to meet you.\"           *       *       *       *       *    After his first inspection of the house and the friends, Roland came to  the conclusion that he preferred Maraquita's room to her company. The  former was large and airy, the latter, with one exception, small and  hairy.    The exception Maraquita addressed as Bombito. He was a conspicuous  figure. He was one of those out-size, hasty-looking men. One suspected  him of carrying lethal weapons.    Maraquita presented Roland to the company. The native speech of Paranoya  sounded like shorthand, with a blend of Spanish. An expert could  evidently squeeze a good deal of it into a minute. Its effect on the  company was good. They were manifestly soothed. Even Bombito.    Introductions in detail then took place. This time, for Roland's  benefit, Maraquita spoke in English, and he learned that most of those  present were marquises. Before him, so he gathered from Maraquita, stood  the very flower of Paranoya's aristocracy, driven from their native land  by the Infamy of 1905. Roland was too polite to inquire what on earth  the Infamy of 1905 might be, but its mention had a marked effect on the  company. Some scowled, others uttered deep-throated oaths. Bombito  did both. Before supper, to which they presently sat down, was over,  however, Roland knew a good deal about Paranoya and its history. The  conversation conducted by Maraquita--to a ceaseless _bouche pleine_  accompaniment from her friends--bore exclusively upon the subject.    Paranoya had, it appeared, existed fairly peacefully for centuries under  the rule of the Alejandro dynasty. Then, in the reign of Alejandro the  Thirteenth, disaffection had begun to spread, culminating in the Infamy  of 1905, which, Roland had at last discovered, was nothing less than the  abolition of the monarchy and the installation of a republic.    Since 1905 the one thing for which they had lived, besides the  caoutchouc, was to see the monarchy restored and their beloved Alejandro  the Thirteenth back on his throne. Their efforts toward this end  had been untiring, and were at last showing signs of bearing fruit.  Paranoya, Maraquita assured Roland, was honeycombed with intrigue. The  army was disaffected, the people anxious for a return to the old order  of things.    A more propitious moment for striking the decisive blow was never likely  to arrive. The question was purely one of funds.    At the mention of the word \"funds,\" Roland, who had become thoroughly  bored with the lecture on Paranoyan history, sat up and took notice.  He had an instinctive feeling that he was about to be called upon for  a subscription to the cause of the distressful country's freedom.  Especially by Bombito.    He was right. A moment later Maraquita began to make a speech.    She spoke in Paranoyan, and Roland could not follow her, but he gathered  that it somehow had reference to himself.    As, at the end of it, the entire company rose to their feet and extended  their glasses toward him with a mighty shout, he assumed that Maraquita  had been proposing his health.    \"They say 'To the liberator of Paranoya!'\" kindly translated the  Peerless One. \"You must excuse,\" said Maraquita tolerantly, as a bevy  of patriots surrounded Roland and kissed him on the cheek. \"They are so  grateful to the savior of our country. I myself would kiss you, were it  not that I have sworn that no man's lips shall touch mine till the royal  standard floats once more above the palace of Paranoya. But that will be  soon, very soon,\" she went on. \"With you on our side we can not fail.\"    What did the woman mean? Roland asked himself wildly. Did she labor  under the distressing delusion that he proposed to shed his blood on  behalf of a deposed monarch to whom he had never been introduced?    Maraquita's next remarks made the matter clear.    \"I have told them,\" she said, \"that you love me, that you are willing  to risk everything for my sake. I have promised them that you, the  rich Senor Bleke, will supply the funds for the revolution. Once more,  comrades. To the Savior of Paranoya!\"    Roland tried his hardest to catch the infection of this patriotic  enthusiasm, but somehow he could not do it. Base, sordid, mercenary  speculations would intrude themselves. About how much was a good,  well-furnished revolution likely to cost? As delicately as he could, he  put the question to Maraquita.    She said, \"Poof! The cost? La, la!\" Which was all very well, but hardly  satisfactory as a business chat. However, that was all Roland could get  out of her.           *       *       *       *       *    The next few days passed for Roland in a sort of dream. It was the kind  of dream which it is not easy to distinguish from a nightmare.    Maraquita's reticence at the supper-party on the subject of details  connected with the financial side of revolutions entirely disappeared.  She now talked nothing but figures, and from the confused mass which  she presented to him Roland was able to gather that, in financing  the restoration of royalty in Paranoya, he would indeed be risking  everything for her sake.    In the matter of revolutions Maraquita was no niggard. She knew how the  thing should be done--well, or not at all. There would be so much for  rifles, machine-guns, and what not: and there would be so much for the  expense of smuggling them into the country. Then there would be so much  to be laid out in corrupting the republican army. Roland brightened a  little when they came to this item. As the standing army of Paranoya  amounted to twenty thousand men, and as it seemed possible to corrupt  it thoroughly at a cost of about thirty shillings a head, the obvious  course, to Roland's way of thinking was to concentrate on this side of  the question and avoid unnecessary bloodshed.    It appeared, however, that Maraquita did not want to avoid bloodshed,  that she rather liked bloodshed, that the leaders of the revolution  would be disappointed if there were no bloodshed. Especially Bombito.  Unless, she pointed out, there was a certain amount of carnage, looting,  and so on, the revolution would not achieve a popular success. True, the  beloved Alejandro might be restored; but he would sit upon a throne  that was insecure, unless the coronation festivities took a bloodthirsty  turn. By all means, said Maraquita, corrupt the army, but not at the  risk of making the affair tame and unpopular. Paranoya was an emotional  country, and liked its revolutions with a bit of zip to them.    It was about ten days after he had definitely cast in his lot with the  revolutionary party that Roland was made aware that these things were a  little more complex than he had imagined. He had reconciled himself to  the financial outlay. It had been difficult, but he had done it. That  his person as well as his purse would be placed in peril he had not  foreseen.    The fact was borne in upon him at the end of the second week by the  arrival of the deputation.    It blew in from the street just as he was enjoying his after-dinner  cigar.    It consisted of three men, one long and suave, the other two short,  stout, and silent. They all had the sallow complexion and undue  hairiness which he had come by this time to associate with the native of  Paranoya.    For a moment he mistook them for a drove of exiled noblemen whom he  had not had the pleasure of meeting at the supper-party; and he waited  resignedly for them to make night hideous with the royal anthem. He  poised himself on his toes, the more readily to spring aside if they  should try to kiss him on the cheek.    \"Mr. Bleke?\" said the long man.    His companions drifted toward the cigar-box which stood open on the  table, and looked at it wistfully.    \"Long live the monarchy,\" said Roland wearily. He had gathered in the  course of his dealings with the exiled ones that this remark generally  went well.    On the present occasion it elicited no outburst of cheering. On the  contrary, the long man frowned, and his two companions helped themselves  to a handful of cigars apiece with a marked moodiness.    \"Death to the monarchy,\" corrected the long man coldly. \"And,\" he added  with a wealth of meaning in his voice, \"to all who meddle in the affairs  of our beloved country and seek to do it harm.\"    \"I don't know what you mean,\" said Roland.    \"Yes, Senor Bleke, you do know what I mean. I mean that you will be  well advised to abandon the schemes which you are hatching with the  malcontents who would do my beloved land an injury.\"    The conversation was growing awkward. Roland had got so into the habit  of taking it for granted that every Paranoyan he met must of necessity  be a devotee of the beloved Alejandro that it came as a shock to him  to realize that there were those who objected to his restoration to  the throne. Till now he had looked on the enemy as something in the  abstract. It had not struck him that the people for whose correction  he was buying all these rifles and machine-guns were individuals with a  lively distaste for having their blood shed.    \"Senor Bleke,\" resumed the speaker, frowning at one of his companions  whose hand was hovering above the bottle of liqueur brandy, \"you are a  man of sense. You know what is safe and what is not safe. Believe me,  this scheme of yours is not safe. You have been led away, but there  is still time to withdraw. Do so, and all is well. Do not so, and your  blood be upon your own head.\"    \"My blood!\" gasped Roland.    The speaker bowed.    \"That is all,\" he said. \"We merely came to give the warning.

He talked a vast deal about his good place, and  how he was in search of a good huswife, whence we soon guessed what  quarter the wind blew from. _Ergo_, my daughter told him that if he was  seeking for a huswife she wondered that he lost his time in riding to  Coserow to no purpose, for that she knew of no huswife for him there,  which vexed him so sore that he never came again.    And now any one would think that the grapes were sour even for the  Sheriff; nevertheless he came riding to us soon after, and without more  ado asked my daughter in marriage for his huntsman. Moreover, he promised  to build him a house of his own in the forest; _item_, to give him pots  and kettles, crockery, bedding, etc., seeing that he had stood god-father  to the young fellow, who, moreover, had ever borne himself well during  seven years he had been in his service. Hereupon my daughter answered that  his lordship had already heard that she would keep house for nobody but  her papa, and that she was still much too young to become a huswife.    This, however, did not seem to anger him, but after he had talked a long  time to no purpose, he took leave quite kindly, like a cat which pretends  to let a mouse go, and creeps behind the corners, but she is not in  earnest, and presently springs out upon it again. For doubtless he saw  that he had set to work stupidly; wherefore he went away in order to begin  his attack again after a better fashion, and Satan went with him, as  whilom with Judas Iscariot.          _The Thirteenth Chapter_      WHAT MORE HAPPENED DURING THE WINTER:  _ITEM_, HOW IN THE SPRING WITCHCRAFT BEGAN IN THE VILLAGE    Nothing else of note happened during the winter, save that the merciful  God bestowed a great plenty of fish, both from the Achterwater and the  sea, and the parish again had good food; so that it might be said of us,  as it is written, \"For a small moment have I forsaken thee; but with great  mercies will I gather thee.\" Wherefore we were not weary of praising the  Lord; and the whole congregation did much for the church, buying new  pulpit and altar cloths, seeing that the enemy had stolen the old ones.  _Item_, they desired to make good to me the money I had paid for the new  cups, which, however, I would not take.    There were still, however, about ten peasants in the parish who had not  been able to buy their seed-corn for the spring, inasmuch as they had  spent all their earnings on cattle and corn for bread. I therefore made an  agreement with them that I would lend them the money for it, and that if  they could not repay me this year, they might the next, which offer they  thankfully took; and we sent seven waggons to Friedland, in Mecklenburg,  to fetch seed-corn for us all. For my beloved brother-in-law, Martin  Behring, in Hamburg, had already sent me by the schipper Wulf, who had  sailed home by Christmas, 700 florins for the amber: may the Lord prosper  it with him!    Old Thiemcke died this winter in Loddin, who used to be the midwife in the  parish, and had also brought my child into the world. Of late, however,  she had had but little to do, seeing that in this year I only baptized two  children, namely, Jung his son in Uekeritze, and Lene Hebers her little  daughter, the same whom the Imperialists afterwards speared. _Item_, it  was now full five years since I had married the last couple. Hence any one  may guess that I might have starved to death had not the righteous God so  mercifully considered and blessed me in other ways. Wherefore to him alone  be all honour and glory. Amen.    Meanwhile, however, it so happened that, not long after the Sheriff had  last been here, witchcraft began in the village. I sat reading with my  child the second book of _Virgilius_ of the fearful destruction of the  city of Troy, which was more terrible even than that of our own village,  when a cry arose that our old neighbour Zabel his red cow, which he had  bought only a few days before, had stretched out all-fours and seemed  about to die; and this was the more strange as she had fed heartily but  half an hour before. My child was therefore begged to go and pluck three  hairs from its tail, and bury them under the threshold of the stall; for  it was well known that if this was done by a pure maid the cow would get  better. My child then did as they would have her, seeing that she is the  only maid in the whole village (for the others are still children); and  the cow got better from that very hour, whereat all the folks were amazed.  But it was not long before the same thing befell Witthahn her pig, whilst  it was feeding heartily. She too came running to beg my child for God's  sake to take compassion on her, and to do something for her pig, as ill  men had bewitched it. Hereupon she had pity on her also, and it did as  much good as it had done before. But the woman, who was _gravida_, was  straightway taken in labour from the fright; and my child was scarce out  of the pigsty when the woman went into her cottage, wailing and holding by  the wall, and called together all the woman of the neighbourhood, seeing  that the proper midwife was dead, as mentioned above; and before long  something shot to the ground from under her; and when the women stooped  down to pick it up, the devil's imp, which had wings like a bat, flew up  off the ground, whizzed and buzzed about the room, and then shot out of  the window with a great noise, so that the glass clattered down into the  street. When they looked after it nothing was to be found. Any one may  judge for himself what a great noise this made in all the neighbourhood;  and the whole village believed that it was no one but old Seden his  squint-eyed wife that had brought forth such a devil's brat.    But the people soon knew not what to believe. For that woman her cow got  the same thing as all the other cows; wherefore she too came lamenting,  and begged my daughter to take pity on her, as on the rest, and to cure  her poor cow for the love of God. That if she had taken it ill of her that  she had said anything about going into service with the Sheriff, she could  only say she had done it for the best, etc. _Summa_, she talked over my  unhappy child to go and cure her cow.    Meanwhile I was on my knees every Sunday before the Lord with the whole  congregation, praying that he would not allow the Evil One to take from us  that which his mercy had once more bestowed upon us after such extreme  want. _Item_, that he would bring to light the _auctor_ of such devilish  works, so that he might receive the punishment he deserved.    But all was of no avail. For a very few days had passed when the mischief  befell Stoffer Zuter his spotted cow, and he, too, like all the rest, came  running to fetch my daughter; she accordingly went with him, but could do  no good, and the beast died under her hands.    _Item_, Katy Berow had bought a little pig with the money my daughter had  paid her in the winter for spinning, and the poor woman kept it like a  child, and let it run about her room. This little pig got the mischief,  like all the rest, in the twinkling of an eye; and when my daughter was  called it grew no better, but also died under her hands; whereupon the  poor woman made a great outcry and tore her hair for grief, so that my  child was moved to pity her, and promised her another pig next time my sow  should litter. Meantime another week passed over, during which I went on,  together with the whole congregation, to call upon the Lord for his  merciful help, but all in vain, when the same thing happened to old wife  Seden her little pig. Whereupon she again came running for my daughter  with loud outcries, and although my child told her that she must have seen  herself that nothing she could do for the cattle cured them any longer,  she ceased not to beg and pray her and to lament till she went forth to do  what she could for her with the help of God. But it was all to no purpose,  inasmuch as the little pig died before she left the sty. What think you  this devil's whore then did? After she had run screaming through the  village she said that any one might see that my daughter was no longer a  maid, else why could she now do no good to the cattle, whereas she had  formerly cured them? She supposed my child had lost her maiden honour on  the Streckelberg, whither she went so often this spring, and that God only  knew who had taken it! But she said no more then, and we did not hear the  whole until afterwards. And it is indeed true that my child had often  walked on the Streckelberg this spring, both with me and also alone, in  order to seek for flowers and to look upon the blessed sea, while she  recited aloud, as she was wont, such verses out of _Virgilius_ as pleased  her best (for whatever she read a few times, that she remembered).    Neither did I forbid her to take these walks, for there were no wolves now  left on the Streckelberg, and even if there had been they always fly  before a human creature in the summer season. Howbeit, I forbade her to  dig for amber. For as it now lay deep, and we knew not what to do with the  earth we threw up, I resolved to tempt the Lord no further, but to wait  till my store of money grew very scant before we would dig any more.    But my child did not do as I had bidden her, although she had promised she  would, and of this her disobedience came all our misery. (Oh, blessed  Lord, how grave a matter is thy holy fourth commandment!) For as his  reverence Johannes Lampius, of Crummin, who visited me this spring, had  told me that the Cantor of Wolgast wanted to sell the _Opp. St.  Augustini_, and I had said before her that I desired above all things to  buy that book, but had not money enough left, she got up in the night  without my knowledge to dig for amber, meaning to sell it as best she  might at Wolgast, in order secretly to present me "]]]
