It  consists of a covered tin pail _a_ that may be fastened to the edge of a  table by the clamp _b_. Inside of the pail is a kneading prong _c_, in  the shape of a gooseneck, that is revolved by turning the handle _d_.  The flour and other materials for the dough are put into the pail, and  they are mixed and kneaded mechanically by turning the handle.    15. A cake mixer, the usual type of which is shown in Fig. 5, is similar  in construction to a bread mixer. Instead of a pail, however, for the  dough ingredients, it has a deep pan _a_, and instead of one kneading  prong it has several prongs, which are attached to two arms _b_, as  shown. These arms are revolved by gear-wheels _c_ that fit in a large  gearwheel _d_ attached to a shaft _e_, which is turned by means of a  handle _f_. The large number of mixing prongs in a cake mixer are  necessary, because cake dough must be thoroughly stirred and beaten,  whereas in bread making the dough must be made to form a compact mass.    [Illustration: Fig. 5]    16. DISH-WASHING MACHINES.--Although machines for washing dishes are to  be had, they are most helpful where large numbers of people are served  and, consequently, where great quantities of dishes are to be washed.  Such machines are usually large and therefore take up more space than  the ordinary kitchen can afford. Likewise the care and cleaning of them  require more labor than the washing of dishes for a small family  entails. Large quantities of hot water are needed to operate mechanical  dish washers, and even where they are installed, the glassware, silver,  and cooking utensils must, as a rule, be washed by hand.    17. FIRELESS COOKER.--A device that has proved to be really labor-saving  is the fireless cooker, one type of which is shown in Fig. 6. It  consists of an insulated box _a_ lined with metal and divided into  compartments _b_, with pans _c_ that fit into them. Hotplates, or  stones, as they are sometimes called, are frequently used if the article  to be cooked requires them. These stones, which are shown at _d_, are  supported in the compartments by metal racks _e_, and they are lifted in  and out by means of wire handles _f_.    [Illustration: Fig 6.]    To use a fireless cooker properly, the food must be cooked for a short  time on the stove; then it must be tightly covered and placed in one of  the insulated compartments. If hotplates are to be used they must be  heated in the same manner. The food loses its heat so gradually in the  fireless cooker that the cooking proceeds slowly but effectually. When  the previous heating has been sufficient, the food will be cooked and  still warm when the cooker is opened hours later. Some articles of food  occasionally need reheating during the process. By this method of  cooking there is no loss of flavor or food value, and the food usually  requires no further attention after being placed in the cooker. It also  permits of economy in both fuel and time.      UTENSILS FOR FURNISHING A KITCHEN    18. As a guide in purchasing equipment for a kitchen, a list of utensils  is here presented. This list is divided into utensils that are necessary  and those that are convenient and only at times necessary. In any case,  however, the number of utensils and the size must be determined by the  quantity of food that is to be prepared.      NECESSARY EQUIPMENT    Baking dish with cover  Bread box  Bread knife  Bread pans  Can opener  Cake knife  Chopping bowl and knife or food chopper  Coffee mill  Coffee pot  Colander  Cookie cutter  Corer, Apple  Cutting board  Dishpan  Double boiler  Egg beater  Flour sifter  Forks  Frying pan, large  Frying pan, small  Garbage can  Grater  Kettle covers  Kettles, two or more  Knife sharpener  Knives  Lemon squeezer  Long-handled fork  Measuring cup  Meat board  Meat knife  Mixing bowls  Mixing spoons  Molding board  Muffin pan  Paring knife  Pepper shaker  Pie pans  Potato masher  Rinsing, or draining, pan  Roasting pan  Rolling pin  Salt box  Saucepans  Spatula  Tablespoons  Teakettle  Teapot  Teaspoons  Toaster  Wire strainer  Wooden spoon      CONVENIENT EQUIPMENT    Bread mixer  Cake coolers  Cake mixer  Cake turner  Casseroles  Clock  Coffee percolator  Containers for spices and dry groceries  Cookie sheets  Cream whip Egg whip  Fireless cooker  Frying kettle and basket  Funnel Glass jars for canning  Griddle  Ice-cream freezer  Ice pick  Jelly molds  Nest of bowls  Pan for baking fish  Potato knife  Potato ricer  Ramekins  Quart measure  Scales  Scissors  Set of skewers  Steamer  Waffle iron  Wheel cart           *       *       *       *       *    GETTING FOODS READY FOR COOKING    PRELIMINARY PREPARATION    19. Before foods that require cooking are cooked or before foods that  are to be eaten raw are served, they must be properly prepared, for  their palatability and their value as food depend considerably on the  way in which they are made ready for cooking or for eating. Of course,  the way in which food should be prepared will depend on how it is to be  served, but in any event all foods, for the sake of cleanliness, must  first be washed with water or wiped with a clean, damp cloth.    20. The ways in which vegetables and fruits are made ready for cooking  vary. Sometimes such foods are cooked with the skins on, and sometimes  certain vegetables, such as new potatoes, young carrots and parsnips,  vegetable oysters, etc., are made ready in an economical way by scraping  off their skins with a knife. Vegetables are also peeled, and when this  is done a very sharp knife with a thin blade should be used and as  little of the food removed as possible. Still another way of removing  the skins of such foods as tomatoes, nuts, and some fruits is by  _blanching_. In this process, the skins are loosened so that they may be  removed easily, either by immersing the foods in boiling water or by  pouring boiling water over them and allowing them to stand in the water  for a few minutes, but not long enough to soften them. Blanching used in  this sense should not be confused with the same word when it means \"to  take color out\" and has reference to a process of bleaching. Only when  the word means \"to remove the covering of\" can it be applied to the  peeling of tomatoes, fruits, and nuts. Vegetables and fruits may be  cooked whole or they may be cut into chunks, or pieces, or into slices.    21. In order to get meats ready for cooking, it is necessary to wipe  them clean and usually to trim off all unnecessary bone, fat, and skin.  Meats may be cooked in large pieces or small pieces or they may be  ground, depending on the cooking process to be used. Before cooking  poultry and fish, they should be thoroughly cleaned and then trimmed and  cut to suit the cooking process chosen. If desired, the bones may be  removed from poultry or fish before cooking, and sometimes it is  advantageous to do so. Cream and raw eggs may be whipped or beaten light  before they are served or cooked, and after such foods as fruits,  vegetables, meats, and fish have been cooked, they may be sliced,  chopped, ground, mashed, or cut into dice, or small pieces.      MIXING OF FOOD INGREDIENTS    22. PROCESSES INVOLVED IN MIXING.--In cookery, the mixing of ingredients  is done for several purposes--to produce a certain texture, to give a  smoothness or creaminess to a mixture, or to impart lightness. Various  processes are involved in the mixing of ingredients, and the results  that are accomplished depend entirely on the method that is selected.  The most important of these processes with brief explanations of what  they mean follow.    BEATING is a rapid motion that picks up material from the bottom and  mixes it with that nearer the surface. It is done with a spoon, a fork,  an egg whip, or, if the mixture is thin, with a rotary egg beater.  Sometimes beating is done for the purpose of incorporating air and thus  making the mixture light.    STIRRING is usually done with a spoon, and is accomplished by moving the  spoon in circles, around and around, through ingredients contained in a  pan or a bowl. This is the method that is generally applied to the  simple mixing of ingredients.    FOLDING is a careful process whereby beaten egg or whipped cream is  added to a mixture without destroying its lightness. It is accomplished  by placing the egg or cream on top of a mixture in a bowl or a pan, and  then passing a spoon down through both and bringing up a spoonful of the  mixture and placing it on top. This motion is repeated until the two are  well blended, but this result should be accomplished with as few strokes  as possible.    RUBBING is done by pressing materials against the side of a bowl with  the back of a spoon. This is the process that is applied when butter and  other fats are to be mixed with such dry ingredients as sugar and flour.    CREAMING consists in continuing the rubbing process until the texture  becomes soft and smooth and is of a creamy consistency.    CUTTING-IN is a method used to combine butter with flour when it is  desired to have the butter remain hard or in small pieces. It is done by  chopping the butter into the flour with a knife.    SIFTING is shaking or stirring material through a sifter having a fine  wire mesh. It is done to remove foreign or coarse material, to impart  lightness, or to mix dry ingredients together.    RICING is a process whereby certain cooked foods, such as fruits,  vegetables, meats, and fish, may be reduced to the form of a puree. This  result is accomplished by forcing the cooked material through a ricer.    23. APPLICATION OF MIXING PROCESSES.--In applying the various mixing  processes, it is well to bear in mind that good results depend  considerably on the order of mixing, as well as on the deftness and  thoroughness with which each process is performed. This fact is clearly  demonstrated in a cake in which the butter and sugar have not been"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/9938"],[0,"Woman's Institute Library of Cookery. Volume 4: Salads and Sandwiches; Cold and (#12)"],[1,"well with  salt and pepper. Add sufficient salad dressing to moisten well. Cut  bread thin and spread a slice with butter and another slice with the  sandwich mixture. Place a lettuce leaf over this, put the two pieces of  bread together, trim and serve.      HOT SANDWICHES    133. All the sandwiches thus far discussed are served cold, but various  hot sandwiches can also be made. As these generally have meat or a  high-protein food for their filling, they may be used as the main dish  in the meal in which they are served. Sandwiches of this kind are  excellent for a light luncheon or for supper.    134. HOT-MEAT SANDWICHES.--If both meat and gravy remain from a roast, a  very excellent luncheon dish may be made by slicing the meat thin,  placing it on slices of bread, and pouring the gravy, which has been  heated, over both the bread and meat. There may be a second layer of  bread on top of the meat if desired.    135. HOT FRIED-EGG SANDWICHES.--A very good way in which to serve eggs  is to saute them and then make sandwiches of them. Spread slices of  bread thinly with butter. Break the desired number of eggs into a frying  pan with melted butter or other fat, season with salt and pepper, and  fry on one side. Then turn and fry on the other side until the yolk  becomes quite hard. Place an egg on one slice of the buttered bread,  place a second slice over this, and serve while hot.    136. HAM-AND-EGG SANDWICHES.--The combination of ham and eggs is always  a good one, but it becomes especially palatable when used in a sandwich,  as here explained. Slice boiled ham into thin slices and saute in hot  fat for a few minutes. Then break into a bowl as many eggs as will be  required, beat slightly, and pour over the slices of ham in the frying  pan. When the mass has cooked well on one side, turn and cook on the  opposite side. There should not be sufficient egg to make this very  thick. Season well with salt and pepper and when the mixture is  thoroughly cooked, cut it into pieces of a size to fit the bread used  for the sandwiches. Cut the bread, butter it slightly, place a piece of  the ham-and-egg mixture between each two slices of bread, and serve hot.  If desired, toast may be used in place of bread and a more delicious  sandwich will be the result.    137. CLUB SANDWICHES.--Nothing in the way of sandwiches is more  delicious than club sandwiches if they are properly made. They involve a  little more work than most sandwiches, but no difficulty will be  experienced in making them if the directions here given are carefully  followed. The ingredients necessary for sandwiches of this kind are  bread, lettuce, salad dressing, bacon, and chicken. The quantity of each  required will depend on whether a two- or a three-layer sandwich is made  and the number of sandwiches to be served.    Cut the bread into slices about 1/4 inch thick and cut each slice  diagonally across to form two triangular pieces. Trim the crust and  toast the bread on a toaster until it is a light brown on both sides and  then butter slightly if desired. Slice chicken into thin slices. Broil  strips of bacon until they are crisp. On a slice of toast, place a  lettuce leaf and then a layer of sliced chicken, and spread over this a  small quantity of salad dressing, preferably mayonnaise. On top of this,  place strips of the broiled bacon and then a second slice of toast. If  desired, repeat the first layer and place on top of it a third slice of  toast. This should be served while the bacon is still hot. Thin slices  of tomato may also be used in each layer of this sandwich if desired.    138. CHEESE DREAMS.--With persons who are fond of melted cheese, a  favorite kind of sandwich is that known as cheese dreams. These make a  good dish for a Sunday evening supper or for an evening lunch.    Cut bread about 1/4 inch thick. Cut slices of cheese about half as  thick, and between each two slices of bread place a slice of the cheese.  Place these on a broiler, broil first on one side and then on the other  until the cheese is thoroughly melted, or saute the sandwiches in a  frying pan with melted butter, first on one side and then on the other.  Serve while hot.      OPEN SANDWICHES    139. If sandwiches that are entirely different and at the same time  attractive are desired for an afternoon tea or to serve with a salad,  open sandwiches will undoubtedly find favor. Fig. 27 illustrates several  varieties of such sandwiches and shows how artistically they can be  made. These are merely submitted as suggestions, but with a little  ingenuity, the housewife may work out in designs any ideas she may have.  To make such sandwiches attractive, fancy cutters of various shapes will  be found helpful. As here shown, round, diamond-shaped, crescent-shaped,  triangular, and star-shaped cutters have been used.    140. The most suitable materials for open sandwiches include cream  cheese, jam, stuffed olives, chopped parsley, hard-cooked eggs with the  yolks or whites forced through a ricer, pimiento cut into attractive  shapes, and any other material that will add either flavor or color.  Either white or brown bread may be used. After cutting the bread in the  preferred shapes, spread first with butter, if desired, and then with  cream cheese, jam, or jelly. With this done, decorate the sandwiches in  any desired way. Slices of stuffed olives are placed in the center of  several here shown and strips or small pieces of pimiento are used for  much of the decoration. On those that have jam or jelly for their  foundation, cream cheese put through a pastry tube forms the decoration.    [Illustration: FIG. 27, Plate of decorative open-faced sandwiches.]    141. If an accompaniment for a salad is desired and time will not permit  the making of open sandwiches, small crisp crackers, decorated with  cream cheese, as shown in Fig. 28, will be a very good substitute. These  are excellent with a vegetable or a fruit salad; also, when served after  the dessert they make a good final course to a meal.    [Illustration: FIG. 28, Plate of crackers decorated with cream cheese.]    To prepare them, add cream to cream cheese until it is thin enough to be  forced through a pastry bag. Using the rosette tube in the bag, make a  single rosette in the center of each wafer. Dust with paprika and serve.    142. CANAPES.--Although differing somewhat from the open sandwiches that  have been described, canapes are usually placed under this head.  _Canapes_ are small pieces of bread toasted or sauted in butter and then  spread with some highly seasoned material, such as caviar, anchovy  paste, well-seasoned smoked or canned salmon, or a vegetable mixture.  They are served either hot or cold as an appetizer or as a first course  for lunch or dinner.    To make canapes, toast or saute slices of bread and cut them into any  shape desired. Cover each piece with a thin layer of the material to be  used and then decorate in any of the ways shown in Fig. 27 or in any  other manner. Sometimes a thin layer of tomato is used, but often just a  border of some material of contrasting color, such as the yolk of egg  forced through a ricer, finely chopped parsley, a thin strip of  pimiento, etc., is placed around the edge.           *       *       *       *       *    SALADS AND SANDWICHES    EXAMINATION QUESTIONS    (1) Discuss the importance of salads and their value in the diet.
