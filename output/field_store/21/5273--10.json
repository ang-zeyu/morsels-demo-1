Gravitation,  extensive as the universe, is but the power of God in each case.    The total force in the universe _is_ beyond calculation.  It is a  part of the power of Almighty God. It approaches infinity. All heat is  convertible into power, and power into heat. Heat, when converted into  power, moves the mighty engines. The power of Niagara may be converted  into heat and light. The sun had lifted the waters of the whole  Niagara River, and the lakes far above the Falls. Its power is  enormous. It lifts up over 1,000,000,000,000 tons of water to the  clouds every day,--more than all the rivers and streams pour into the  seas. The sun equals in size a pile of more than a million worlds like  ours. Every square yard of surface of this enormous sphere, has enough  heat to push a great liner across the sea,--as much power as in many  tons of coal. The amount of heat in the surface of the sun, consisting  of more than 2,284,000,000,000 sq. mi., can hardly be imagined. The  heat of one sq. mi. (3,097,600 sq. yds.)  would drive 3,000,000 ships  across the sea,--150 times as many as are afloat. More than  2,200,000,000 times as much heat as the earth receives, goes out into  space. And this enormous amount of heat is but a poor fraction of the  heat of 400,000,000 suns, few of which are so small as ours.    A single star, Betelguese, has recently been computed to be  215,000,000 mi. in diameter, and therefore larger than 10,000,000 suns  like ours. A still more recent computation shows stars even  larger. Antares is 390,000,000 mi. in diameter, equal, to 91,125,000  suns, or 136,687,500,000,000 worlds. If our sun were in the centre of  this sun, it would extend beyond the orbit of Mars. Alpha Hercules is  300,000,000 mi. in diameter. Some stars are so far away that it takes  light 60,000 years to reach us, at the rate of 186,000 mi. in a  second. Some say there are 400,000,000 enormous suns. Compute, if you  can, the sum total of the power causing the light and heat, and the  power of gravitation controlling these vast swarms of stars. All this  power is the power of God, and a weak fraction of the total. This  power could not originate itself. It could not grow. It could not come  by evolution. It could not come by chance.    The doctrine of the Conservation of Force, accepted by scientists,  proves that no part of force can be lost. A God of infinite power is  required to create, maintain and control this vast universe. Force can  no more create itself than matter. God must create and preserve both.  It takes almighty power to maintain the universe in existence, as well  as to create it.    If atheism be true, then, if there was even one germ to start with, as  most admit, it must have created itself, unless the absurd claim that  it came from another world, riding on a meteorite, be entertained. If  such a foolish assumption were possible, it would require a God to  create it in another world.    \"The fool hath said in his heart, 'No God'.\" Some translators would  supply the words omitted by the Hebrew, and make it read: \"The fool  hath said in his heart, '_There is_ no God'.\" Others, \"The fool  hath said in his heart, '_I wish there were_ no God'.\" It is hard  to tell which is the bigger fool, the man who refuses to see the  countless evidences of design, proving His existence; or the man who  refuses to see the terrible wreck of the great universe, and the awful  chaos that would result if there were no God. We can imagine only one  greater fool than either: The man who thinks he can get the world to  believe, under cover of evolution, that there is no God, and that all  things were evolved by chance, even though it be camouflaged by the  terms \"natural selection\" or \"natural law.\"    Atheism implies spontaneous generation, which is entirely without  proof. Indeed, if spontaneous generation were possible at the  beginning of life, it is possible now, and has been possible during  all the ages. But no proof of it has been given. On the contrary, all  efforts to secure, by chemistry, the lowest forms of life from dead  matter have been without avail. Dr. Leib, of Chicago University, made  earnest efforts to do so. He failed utterly.  If nature, aided by the  genius of man, can not now produce the lowest forms of life from  matter, how could it ever have been done? Prof. Huxley filled jars  with sterilized water, and placed in it sterilized vegetation, and  sealed them up, and after 30 years, no life was seen, disproving  spontaneous generation. Pasteur proved that, if milk were sterilized,  there would be no development of life by spontaneous generation. This  discovery was of immense practical value, making milk safe to use.  Prof. Tyndall, the distinguished physicist, said: \"If matter is what  the world believes it to be, materialism, spontaneous generation, and  evolution, or development, are absurdities too monstrous to be  entertained by any sane mind.\" Dr. Clark Maxwell, another  distinguished physicist, says, \"I have examined all [theories of  evolution] and have found that every one must have a God to make it  work.\" _L'Univers_ says: \"When hypotheses tend to nothing less  than the shutting out of God from the thoughts and hearts of men, and  the diffusion of the leprosy of materialism, the savant who invents  and propagates them is either a criminal or a fool.\" Even Darwin seems  to be conscious of a designing mind when he says, \"It is difficult to  avoid personifying the word Nature.  But I mean by nature only the  aggregate action and product of many natural laws.\" A futile effort to  exclude God. Who made these laws?    Can a theory that is consistent with false theories, like chance and  atheism be true? Truth is consistent with truth, but not with  falsehood. We can judge a theory by the company it keeps. Evolution  naturally affiliates with false theories rather than with the  truth. It favors infidelity and atheism. A theory in perfect harmony  with manifest error, raises a presumption against its truth.  Evolution seems to have a natural attraction for erroneous hypotheses  and manifests the closest kinship with impossible theories. This is  not a mark of a true theory.    So baneful has been the effect of teaching evolution as a proven  hypothesis, that multitudes have been led into infidelity and  atheism. Prof. James H. Leuba, of Bryn Mawr College, Pa., sent a  questionaire to 1000 of the most prominent scientists teaching  sciences relating to evolution. The replies indicate that more than  one-half do not believe in a personal God, nor the immortality of the  soul,--beliefs almost universal even in the heathen world. So  pernicious is this doctrine of evolution that more than one-half of  the professors who teach it and kindred subjects, are infidels and  atheists and farther from God than the ignorant heathen. And while we  are happy in the conviction that the great majority of professors and  teachers of other subjects are Christians, yet one or two atheists or  infidels are sufficient to make havoc of the faith of many, in a great  college or university.    A doctrine so abhorrent to the conscience, so contrary to the well  nigh universal belief, and so fruitful of evil, certainly can not be  true. Small wonder is it that students are fast becoming infidels and  atheists, and we shudder as we think of the coming generation. A great  responsibility rests upon the authorities who employ such teachers.    The answers of the students in seven large representative colleges and  universities to Prof. Leuba's questionaire, show that while only 15%  of the Freshmen have abandoned the Christian religion, 30% of the  Juniors and over 40% of the Seniors have abandoned the Christian  faith. Note the steady and rapid growth of infidelity and atheism as a  result of this pernicious theory.    Will Christian parents patronize or support or endow institutions that  give an education that is worse than worthless? What the colleges  teach today the world will believe tomorrow.    Atheism, under its own name, has never had many to embrace it. Its  only hope is to be tolerated and believed under some other name. In  Russia, no man is allowed to belong to the ruling (Communist) party  unless he is an atheist. It will be a sorry world when \"scientific\"  atheism wins, under the name of evolution.    No one has a moral right to believe what is false, much less to teach  it, under the specious plea of freedom of thought.    It is the privilege and duty of parents to send their children to  institutions that are safe.    Nathan Leopold, Jr., and Richard Loeb kidnapped and cruelly murdered  Robert Franks. Both were brilliant scholars and atheists. Both  graduates of universities, though minors, and both were taking a  post-graduate course in the University of Chicago. It is asserted and  widely believed that they were encouraged in their atheistic belief by  the teaching of evolution and modernism, and were thus prepared to  commit a crime that shocked the world.    Most of the writers who advocated evolution became atheists or  infidels; most of the professors who teach it, believe neither in God  nor the immortality of the soul; and the number of students discarding  Christianity rose from 15% in the Freshman year to 40% in the  Senior. What more proof is needed?        16. BRUTE DESCENT IMPOSSIBLE      According to Prof. R. S. Lull and other evolutionists, \"The skull of  the pithecanthropus is characterized by a limited capacity of about  two-thirds that of a man.\" Assuming that this skull is that of a  normal creature of that age, as is done in all the arguments of \"our  friends, the enemy,\" then the pithecanthropus must have lived  20,000,000 years ago, one-third the period assigned to life.  They  claim the pithecanthropus lived 750,000 years ago; later the guess"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/852"],[0,"Democracy and Education: An Introduction to the Philosophy of Education (#12)"],[1,"g, our shoes, and gloves; to the atmosphere  as long as it is fairly equable; to our daily associates, etc.  Conformity to the environment, a change wrought in the organism without  reference to ability to modify surroundings, is a marked trait of such  habituations. Aside from the fact that we are not entitled to carry  over the traits of such adjustments (which might well be called  accommodations, to mark them off from active adjustments) into habits of  active use of our surroundings, two features of habituations are worth  notice. In the first place, we get used to things by first using them.    Consider getting used to a strange city. At first, there is excessive  stimulation and excessive and ill-adapted response. Gradually certain  stimuli are selected because of their relevancy, and others are  degraded. We can say either that we do not respond to them any longer,  or more truly that we have effected a persistent response to them--an  equilibrium of adjustment. This means, in the second place, that this  enduring adjustment supplies the background upon which are made specific  adjustments, as occasion arises. We are never interested in changing  the whole environment; there is much that we take for granted and accept  just as it already is. Upon this background our activities focus at  certain points in an endeavor to introduce needed changes. Habituation  is thus our adjustment to an environment which at the time we are not  concerned with modifying, and which supplies a leverage to our active  habits. Adaptation, in fine, is quite as much adaptation of the  environment to our own activities as of our activities to the  environment. A savage tribe manages to live on a desert plain. It adapts  itself. But its adaptation involves a maximum of accepting, tolerating,  putting up with things as they are, a maximum of passive acquiescence,  and a minimum of active control, of subjection to use. A civilized  people enters upon the scene. It also adapts itself. It introduces  irrigation; it searches the world for plants and animals that will  flourish under such conditions; it improves, by careful selection, those  which are growing there. As a consequence, the wilderness blossoms as  a rose. The savage is merely habituated; the civilized man has habits  which transform the environment.    The significance of habit is not exhausted, however, in its executive  and motor phase. It means formation of intellectual and emotional  disposition as well as an increase in ease, economy, and efficiency of  action. Any habit marks an inclination--an active preference and choice  for the conditions involved in its exercise. A habit does not wait,  Micawber-like, for a stimulus to turn up so that it may get busy;  it actively seeks for occasions to pass into full operation. If its  expression is unduly blocked, inclination shows itself in uneasiness and  intense craving. A habit also marks an intellectual disposition. Where  there is a habit, there is acquaintance with the materials and equipment  to which action is applied. There is a definite way of understanding the  situations in which the habit operates. Modes of thought, of observation  and reflection, enter as forms of skill and of desire into the habits  that make a man an engineer, an architect, a physician, or a merchant.  In unskilled forms of labor, the intellectual factors are at minimum  precisely because the habits involved are not of a high grade. But there  are habits of judging and reasoning as truly as of handling a tool,  painting a picture, or conducting an experiment. Such statements are,  however, understatements. The habits of mind involved in habits of the  eye and hand supply the latter with their significance. Above all,  the intellectual element in a habit fixes the relation of the habit to  varied and elastic use, and hence to continued growth. We speak of fixed  habits. Well, the phrase may mean powers so well established that their  possessor always has them as resources when needed. But the phrase  is also used to mean ruts, routine ways, with loss of freshness,  open-mindedness, and originality. Fixity of habit may mean that  something has a fixed hold upon us, instead of our having a free hold  upon things. This fact explains two points in a common notion about  habits: their identification with mechanical and external modes of  action to the neglect of mental and moral attitudes, and the tendency  to give them a bad meaning, an identification with \"bad habits.\" Many  a person would feel surprised to have his aptitude in his chosen  profession called a habit, and would naturally think of his use of  tobacco, liquor, or profane language as typical of the meaning of habit.  A habit is to him something which has a hold on him, something not  easily thrown off even though judgment condemn it.    Habits reduce themselves to routine ways of acting, or degenerate into  ways of action to which we are enslaved just in the degree in which  intelligence is disconnected from them. Routine habits are unthinking  habits: \"bad\" habits are habits so severed from reason that they are  opposed to the conclusions of conscious deliberation and decision. As we  have seen, the acquiring of habits is due to an original plasticity  of our natures: to our ability to vary responses till we find an  appropriate and efficient way of acting. Routine habits, and habits that  possess us instead of our possessing them, are habits which put an end  to plasticity. They mark the close of power to vary. There can be no  doubt of the tendency of organic plasticity, of the physiological basis,  to lessen with growing years. The instinctively mobile and eagerly  varying action of childhood, the love of new stimuli and new  developments, too easily passes into a \"settling down,\" which means  aversion to change and a resting on past achievements. Only an  environment which secures the full use of intelligence in the process  of forming habits can counteract this tendency. Of course, the same  hardening of the organic conditions affects the physiological structures  which are involved in thinking. But this fact only indicates the need  of persistent care to see to it that the function of intelligence is  invoked to its maximum possibility. The short-sighted method which falls  back on mechanical routine and repetition to secure external efficiency  of habit, motor skill without accompanying thought, marks a deliberate  closing in of surroundings upon growth.    3. The Educational Bearings of the Conception of Development. We have  had so far but little to say in this chapter about education. We have  been occupied with the conditions and implications of growth. If our  conclusions are justified, they carry with them, however, definite  educational consequences. When it is said that education is development,  everything depends upon how development is conceived. Our net conclusion  is that life is development, and that developing, growing, is life.  Translated into its educational equivalents, that means (i) that the  educational process has no end beyond itself; it is its own end; and  that (ii) the educational process is one of continual reorganizing,  reconstructing, transforming.    1. Development when it is interpreted in comparative terms, that is,  with respect to the special traits of child and adult life, means  the direction of power into special channels: the formation of habits  involving executive skill, definiteness of interest, and specific  objects of observation and thought. But the comparative view is not  final. The child has specific powers; to ignore that fact is to stunt  or distort the organs upon which his growth depends. The adult uses his  powers to transform his environment, thereby occasioning new stimuli  which redirect his powers and keep them developing. Ignoring this fact  means arrested development, a passive accommodation. Normal child  and normal adult alike, in other words, are engaged in growing. The  difference between them is not the difference between growth and  no growth, but between the modes of growth appropriate to different  conditions. With respect to the development of powers devoted to coping  with specific scientific and economic problems we may say the child  should be growing in manhood. With respect to sympathetic curiosity,  unbiased responsiveness, and openness of mind, we may say that the adult  should be growing in childlikeness. One statement is as true as the  other.    Three ideas which have been criticized, namely, the merely privative  nature of immaturity, static adjustment to a fixed environment, and  rigidity of habit, are all connected with a false idea of growth or  development,--that it is a movement toward a fixed goal. Growth is  regarded as having an end, instead of being an end. The educational  counterparts of the three fallacious ideas are first, failure to take  account of the instinctive or native powers of the young; secondly,  failure to develop initiative in coping with novel situations; thirdly,  an undue emphasis upon drill and other devices which secure automatic  skill at the expense of personal perception. In all cases, the adult  environment is accepted as a standard for the child. He is to be brought  up to it.    Natural instincts are either disregarded or treated as nuisances--as  obnoxious traits to be suppressed, or at all events to be brought into  conformity with external standards. Since conformity is the aim, what is  distinctively individual in a young person is brushed aside, or regarded  as a source of mischief or anarchy. Conformity is made equivalent to  uniformity. Consequently, there are induced lack of interest in the  novel, aversion to progress, and dread of the uncertain and the unknown.  Since the end of growth is outside of and beyond the process of growing,  external agents have to be resorted to to induce movement toward it.  Whenever a method of education is stigmatized"]]]
