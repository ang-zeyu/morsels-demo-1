After this they grew tired of the coast of Brazil. However, in their  return to the West Indies they took some very considerable prizes, upon  which they resolved unanimously to return home, in order, as they  flattered themselves, to enjoy their riches. The captain who then  commanded them was an Irishman, who endeavoured to bring the ship into  Ireland, on the north coast of which a storm arising, the vessel was  carried into Scotland and there wrecked. At that time Kennedy had a  considerable quantity of gold, which he either squandered away, or had  stolen from him in the Highlands. He afterwards went over into Ireland,  where being in a low and poor condition he shipped himself at length for  England, and came up to London. He had not been long in town before he  was observed by some whose vessel had been taken by the crew with whom  he sailed. They caused him to be apprehended, and after lying a  considerable time in prison, he was, as I have said before, tried and  convicted.    After sentence, he showed much less concern for life than is usual for  persons in that condition. He was so much tired with the miseries and  misfortune which for some years before he had endured, that death  appeared to him a thing rather desirable than frightful. When the  reprieve came for Bradshaw, who was condemned with him, he expressed  great satisfaction, at the same time saying that he was better pleased  than if he himself had received mercy. _For_, continued he, _should I be  banished into America as he is, 'tis highly probable I might be tempted  to my old way of life, and so instead of reforming, add to the number of  my sins._    He continued in these sentiments till the time of his death, when, as he  went through Cheapside to his execution, the silver oar being carried  before him as is usual, he turned about to a person who sat by him in  the cart, and said, _Though it is a common thing for us when at sea to  acquire vast quantities both of that metal which goes before me, and of  gold, yet such is the justice of Providence that few or none of us  preserve enough to maintain us; but as you see in me, when we go to  death, we have not wherewith to purchase a coffin to bury us._ He died  at Execution Dock, the 21st[11] of July, 1721, being then about  twenty-six years of age.    FOOTNOTES:        [8] Avery was one of the best known pirates of his time and          told of his wonderful wealth, his capturing and marrying the          daughter of the Great Mogul, and his setting up a kingdom in          Madagascar. He was even the hero of a popular play--_The          Successful Pirate_, produced at Dray Lane in 1712. The true          story of his life and how he died in want, is related at length          in Captain Charles Johnson's _History of the Pirates_ edited by          me, and published in the same edition as the present volume.        [9] Woodes Rogers (d. 1732) sailed on Dampier's voyages and          made a large sum of money which he devoted to buying the Bahama          Islands from the proprietors on a twenty-one years' lease. He          was made governor, but found himself unable to cope with the          pirates and Spaniards who infested the islands, and went back to          England in 1721. He returned as governor in 1728, and remained          there until his death.

The Life of MATTHEW CLARK, a Footpad and Murderer      Perhaps there is nothing to which we may more justly attribute those  numerous executions which so disgrace our country, than the false  notions which the meaner sort, especially, imbibe in their youth as to  love and women. This unhappy person, Matthew Clark, of whom we are now  to speak, was a most remarkable instance of the truth of this  observation. He was born at St. Albans, of parents in but mean  circumstances, who thought they had provided very well for their son  when they had procured his admission into the family of a neighbouring  gentleman, equally distinguished by the greatness of his merit and  fortune.    In this place, certainly, had Matthew been inclined in any degree to  good, he might have acquired from the favour of his master all the  advantages, even of a liberal education; but proving an incorrigible,  lazy and undutiful servant, the gentleman in whose service he was, after  bearing with him a long time, turned him out of his family. He then went  to plough and cart, and such other country work, but though he had been  bred to this and was never in any state from which he could reasonably  hope better, yet was he so restless and uneasy at those hardships which  he fancied were put upon him, that he chose rather to rob than to  labour; and leaving the farmer in whose service he was, used to skulk  about Bushey Heath, and watch all opportunities to rob passengers.    Matthew was a perfect composition of all the vices that enter into low  life. He was idle, inclined to drunkenness, cruel and a coward; nor  would he have had spirit enough to attack anybody on the road had it not  been to supply him with money for merry meetings and dancing bouts, to  which he was carried by his prevailing passion for loose women. And  these expeditions keeping him continually bare, robbing and junketting,  desire of pleasure and fear of the gallows were the whole round of both  his actions and his thoughts.    At last the matrimonial maggot bit his brain, and alter a short  courtship, he prevailed on a young girl in the neighbourhood to go up  with him to London, in order to their marriage. When they were there,  finding his stock reduced so low that he had not even money to purchase  the wedding ring, he pretended that a legacy of fifteen pounds was just  left him in the country, and with a thousand promises of a quick return,  set out from London to fetch it. When he left the town, full of uneasy  thoughts, he travelled towards Neasden and Willesden Green, where  formerly he had lived. He intended to have lurked there till he had an  opportunity of robbing as many persons as to make up fifteen pounds from  their effects. In pursuance of this resolution, he designed in himself  to attack every passenger he saw, but whenever it came to the push, the  natural cowardice of his temper prevailed and his heart failed him.    [Illustration: MATTHEW CLARK CUTTING THE THROAT OF SARAH GOLDINGTON    (_From the Annals of Newgate_)]    While he loitered about there, the master of an alehouse hard by took  notice of him and asked him how he came to idle about in haytime, when  there was so much work, offering at the same time to hire him for a  servant. Upon this discourse Clark immediately recollected that all the  persons belonging to this man's house must be out haymaking, except the  maid, who served his liquors and waited upon guests. As soon, therefore,  as he had parted from the master and saw he was gone into the fields, he  turned back and went into his house, where renewing his former  acquaintance with the maid, who as he had guessed, was there alone, and  to whom he formerly had been a sweetheart, he sat near an hour drinking  and talking in that jocose manner which is usual between people of their  condition in the country. But in the midst of all his expressions of  affection, he mediated how to rob the house, his timorous disposition  supposing a thousand dangers from the knowledge the maid had of him.    He resolved, in order absolutely to secure himself, to murder her out of  the way; upon which, having secretly drawn his knife out of his sheath,  and hiding it under his coat, he kissed her, designing at the same time  to dispatch her; but his heart failed him the first time. However,  getting up and kissing her a second time, he darted it into her  windpipe; but its edge being very dull, the poor creature made a shift  to mutter his name, and endeavoured to scramble after him. Upon which he  returned, and with the utmost inhumanity cut her neck to the bone quite  round; after which he robbed the house of some silver, but being  confounded and astonished did not carry off much.    He went directly into the London Road, and came as far as Tyburn, the  sight of which filled him with so much terror that he was not able to  pick up courage enough to go by it. Returning back into the road again,  he met a waggon, which, in hopes of preventing all suspicion, he  undertook to drive up to town (the man who drove it having hurt his  leg). But he had not gone far before the persons who were in pursuit of  the murderer of Sarah Goldington (the maid before mentioned) came up  with him, and enquired whether he had seen anybody pass by his waggon  who looked suspicious, or was likely to have committed the fact. This  enquiry put him into so much confusion that he was scarce able to make  an answer, which occasioned their looking at him more narrowly and  thereby discovering the sleeve of his shirt to be all bloody. At first  he affirmed with great confidence that a soldier meeting him upon the  road had insulted him, and that in fighting with him he had made the  soldier's mouth bleed, which had so stained his shirt. But in a little  time perceiving this excuse would not prevail, but that they were  resolved to carry him back, he fell into a violent agony and confessed  the fact.    At the next sessions at the Old Bailey he was convicted, and after  receiving sentence of death, endeavoured all he could to comfort and  compose himself during the time he lay under condemnation. His father,"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/13102"],[0,"The Decameron, Volume II (#13)"],[1,"t.    Fineo already knew, for 'twas bruited everywhere, the cause for which  Pietro was being led to the gallows; wherefore he straightway hied him  with his companions and their retinue to Messer Currado, and said to  him:--\"Sir, this lad, whom you are sending to the gallows like a slave,  is freeborn, and my son, and is ready to take to wife her whom, as 'tis  said, he has deflowered; so please you, therefore, delay the execution  until such time as it may be understood whether she be minded to have him  for husband, lest, should she be so minded, you be found to have broken  the law.\" Messer Currado marvelled to hear that Pietro was Fineo's son,  and not without shame, albeit 'twas not his but Fortune's fault,  confessed that 'twas even as Fineo said: and having caused Pietro to be  taken home with all speed, and Messer Amerigo to be brought before him,  told him the whole matter. Messer Amerigo, who supposed that by this time  his daughter and grandson must be dead, was the saddest man in the world  to think that 'twas by his deed, witting that, were the damsel still  alive, all might very easily be set right: however, he sent post haste to  his daughter's abode, revoking his orders, if they were not yet carried  out. The servant, whom he had earlier despatched, had laid the sword and  poison before the damsel, and, for that she was in no hurry to make her  choice, was giving her foul words, and endeavouring to constrain her  thereto, when the messenger arrived; but on hearing the injunction laid  upon him by his lord, he desisted, and went back, and told him how things  stood. Whereupon Messer Amerigo, much relieved, hied him to Fineo, and  well-nigh weeping, and excusing himself for what had befallen, as best he  knew how, craved his pardon, and professed himself well content to give  Teodoro, so he were minded to have her, his daughter to wife. Fineo  readily accepted his excuses, and made answer:--\"'Tis my will that my son  espouse your daughter, and, so he will not, let thy sentence passed upon  him be carried out.\"    So Fineo and Messer Amerigo being agreed, while Teodoro still languished  in fear of death, albeit he was glad at heart to have found his father,  they questioned him of his will in regard of this matter.    When he heard that, if he would, he might have Violante to wife,  Teodoro's delight was such that he seemed to leap from hell to paradise,  and said that, if 'twas agreeable to them all, he should deem it the  greatest of favours. So they sent to the damsel to learn her pleasure:  who, having heard how it had fared, and was now like to fare, with  Teodoro, albeit, saddest of women, she looked for nought but death, began  at length to give some credence to their words, and to recover heart a  little, and answered that, were she to follow the bent of her desire,  nought that could happen would delight her more than to be Teodoro's  wife; but nevertheless she would do as her father bade her.    So, all agreeing, the damsel was espoused with all pomp and festal cheer,  to the boundless delight of all the citizens, and was comforted, and  nurtured her little boy, and in no long time waxed more beautiful than  ever before; and, her confinement being ended, she presented herself  before Fineo, who was then about to quit Rome on his homeward journey,  and did him such reverence as is due to a father. Fineo, mighty well  pleased to have so fair a daughter-in-law, caused celebrate her nuptials  most bravely and gaily, and received, and did ever thereafter entreat,  her as his daughter.    And so he took her, not many days after the festivities were ended, with  his son and little grandson, aboard a galley, and brought them to  Lazistan, and there thenceforth the two lovers dwelt with him in easeful  and lifelong peace.      NOVEL VIII.    --  Nastagio degli Onesti, loving a damsel of the Traversari family, by  lavish expenditure gains not her love. At the instance of his kinsfolk he  hies him to Chiassi, where he sees a knight hunt a damsel and slay her  and cause her to be devoured by two dogs. He bids his kinsfolk and the  lady that he loves to breakfast. During the meal the said damsel is torn  in pieces before the eyes of the lady, who, fearing a like fate, takes  Nastagio to husband.  --    Lauretta was no sooner silent than thus at the queen's behest began  Filomena:--Sweet ladies, as in us pity has ever its meed of praise, even  so Divine justice suffers not our cruelty to escape severe chastisement:  the which that I may shew you, and thereby dispose you utterly to banish  that passion from your souls, I am minded to tell you a story no less  touching than delightsome.    In Ravenna, that most ancient city of Romagna, there dwelt of yore  noblemen and gentlemen not a few, among whom was a young man, Nastagio  degli Onesti by name, who by the death of his father and one of his  uncles inherited immense wealth. Being without a wife, Nastagio, as 'tis  the way with young men, became enamoured of a daughter of Messer Paolo  Traversaro, a damsel of much higher birth than his, whose love he hoped  to win by gifts and the like modes of courting, which, albeit they were  excellent and fair and commendable, not only availed him not, but seemed  rather to have the contrary effect, so harsh and ruthless and unrelenting  did the beloved damsel shew herself towards him; for whether it was her  uncommon beauty or her noble lineage that puffed her up, so haughty and  disdainful was she grown that pleasure she had none either in him or in  aught that pleased him. The burden of which disdain Nastagio found so  hard to bear, that many a time, when he had made his moan, he longed to  make away with himself. However he refrained therefrom, and many a time  resolved to give her up altogether, or, if so he might, to hold her in  despite, as she did him: but 'twas all in vain, for it seemed as if, the  more his hope dwindled, the greater grew his love. And, as thus he  continued, loving and spending inordinately, certain of his kinsfolk and  friends, being apprehensive lest he should waste both himself and his  substance, did many a time counsel and beseech him to depart Ravenna, and  go tarry for a time elsewhere, that so he might at once cool his flame  and reduce his charges. For a long while Nastagio answered their  admonitions with banter; but as they continued to ply him with them, he  grew weary of saying no so often, and promised obedience. Whereupon he  equipped himself as if for a journey to France or Spain, or other distant  parts, got on horseback and sallied forth of Ravenna, accompanied by not  a few of his friends, and being come to a place called Chiassi, about  three miles from Ravenna, he halted, and having sent for tents and  pavilions, told his companions that there he meant to stay, and they  might go back to Ravenna. So Nastagio pitched his camp, and there  commenced to live after as fine and lordly a fashion as did ever any man,  bidding divers of his friends from time to time to breakfast or sup with  him, as he had been wont to do. Now it so befell that about the beginning  of May, the season being very fine, he fell a brooding on the cruelty of  his mistress, and, that his meditations might be the less disturbed, he  bade all his servants leave him, and sauntered slowly, wrapt in thought,  as far as the pinewood. Which he had threaded for a good half-mile, when,  the fifth hour of the day being well-nigh past, yet he recking neither of  food nor of aught else, 'twas as if he heard a woman wailing exceedingly  and uttering most piercing shrieks: whereat, the train of his sweet  melancholy being broken, he raised his head to see what was toward, and  wondered to find himself in the pinewood; and saw, moreover, before him  running through a grove, close set with underwood and brambles, towards  the place where he was, a damsel most comely, stark naked, her hair  dishevelled, and her flesh all torn by the briers and brambles, who wept  and cried piteously for mercy; and at her flanks he saw two mastiffs,  exceeding great and fierce, that ran hard upon her track, and not seldom  came up with her and bit her cruelly; and in the rear he saw, riding a  black horse, a knight sadly accoutred, and very wrathful of mien,  carrying a rapier in his hand, and with despiteful, blood-curdling words  threatening her with death. Whereat he was at once amazed and appalled,  and then filled with compassion for the hapless lady, whereof was bred a  desire to deliver her, if so he might, from such anguish and peril of  death. Wherefore, as he was unarmed, he ran and took in lieu of a cudgel  a branch of a tree, with which he prepared to encounter the dogs and the  knight. Which the knight observing, called to him before he was come to  close quarters, saying:--\"Hold off, Nastagio, leave the dogs and me alone  to deal with this vile woman as she has deserved.\" And, even as he spoke,  the dogs gripped the damsel so hard on either flank that they arrested  her flight, and the knight, being come up, dismounted. Whom Nastagio  approached, saying:--\"I know not who thou art, that knowest me so well,  but thus much I tell thee: 'tis a gross outrage for an armed knight to go  about to kill a naked woman, and set his dogs upon her as if she were a  wild beast: rest assured that I shall do all I can to protect her.\"  Whereupon:--\"Nastagio,\" replied the knight, \"of the same city as thou was  I, and thou wast yet a little lad when I, Messer Guido degli Anastagi by  name, being far more enamoured of this damsel than thou art now of her of  the Traversari, was by her haughtiness and cruelty brought to so woeful a  pass that one day in a fit of despair I slew myself with this rapier  which thou seest in my hand; for which cause I am condemned to the  eternal pains. Nor was it long after my death that she, who exulted  therein over measure, also died, and for that she repented her not of her  cruelty and the joy she"]]]
