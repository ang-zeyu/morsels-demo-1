Foods from which it is  desirable to extract the nutrient properties, as for broths, extracts,  etc., should be put to cook in cold water. Foods to be kept intact as  nearly as may be, should be put to cook in boiling water.    Hot and cold water act differently upon the different food elements.  Starch is but slightly acted upon by cold water. When starch is added  to several times its bulk of hot water, all the starch granules burst on  approaching the boiling point, and swell to such a degree as to occupy  nearly the whole volume of the water, forming a pasty mess. Sugar is  dissolved readily in the either hot or cold water. Cold water extracts  albumen. Hot water coagulates it.    _Steaming_, as its name implies, is the cooking of food by the use of  steam. There are several ways of steaming, the most common of which is  by placing the food in a perforated dish over a vessel of boiling water.  For foods not needing the solvent powers of water, or which already  contain a large amount of moisture, this method is preferable to  boiling. Another form of cooking, which is usually termed steaming, is  that of placing the food, with or without water, as needed, in a closed  vessel which is placed inside another vessel containing boiling water.  Such an apparatus is termed a double boiler. Food cooked in its own  juices in a covered dish in a hot oven, is sometimes spoken of as being  _steamed_ or _smothered_.    _Stewing_ is the prolonged cooking of food in a small quantity of  liquid, the temperature of which is just below the boiling point.  Stewing should not be confounded with simmering, which is slow, steady  boiling. The proper temperature for stewing is most easily secured by  the use of the double boiler. The water in the outer vessel boils, while  that in the inner vessel does not, being kept a little below the  temperature of the water from which its heat is obtained, by the  constant evaporation at a temperature a little below the boiling point.    _Frying_, which is the cooking of food in hot fat, is a method not to be  recommended--Unlike all the other food elements, fat is rendered less  digestible by cooking. Doubtless it is for this reason that nature has  provided those foods which require the most prolonged cooking to fit  them for use with only a small proportion of fat, and it would seem to  indicate that any food to be subjected to a high degree of heat should  not be mixed and compounded largely of fats. The ordinary way of frying,  which the French call _sauteing_, is by the use of only a little fat in  a shallow pan, into which the food is put and cooked first on one side  and then the other. Scarcely anything could be more unwholesome than  food prepared in this manner. A morsel of food encrusted with fat  remains undigested in the stomach because fat is not acted upon by the  gastric juice, and its combination with the other food elements of which  the morsel is composed interferes with their digestion also. If such  foods are habitually used, digestion soon becomes slow and the gastric  juice so deficient in quantity that fermentation and putrefactive  changes are occasioned, resulting in serious disturbance of health. In  the process of frying, the action of the heat partially decomposes the  fat; in consequence, various poisonous substances are formed, highly  detrimental to the digestion of the partaker of the food.    ADDING FOODS TO BOILING LIQUIDS.--Much of the soddenness of  improperly cooked foods might be avoided, if the following facts were  kept in mind:--    When vegetables, or other foods of ordinary temperature, are put into  boiling water, the temperature of the water is lowered in proportion to  the quantity and the temperature of the food thus introduced, and will  not again boil until the mass of food shall have absorbed more heat from  the fire. The result of this is that the food is apt to become more or  less water-soaked before the process of cooking begins. This difficulty  may be avoided by introducing but small quantities of the food at one  time, so as not to greatly lower the temperature of the liquid, and then  allowing the latter to boil between the introduction of each fresh  supply, or by heating the food before adding it to the liquid.    EVAPORATION is another principle often overlooked in the cooking of  food, and many a sauce or gravy is spoiled because the liquid, heated in  a shallow pan, from which evaporation is rapid, loses so much in bulk  that the amount of thickening requisite for the given quantity of fluid,  and which, had less evaporation occurred, would have made it of the  proper consistency, makes the sauce thick and unpalatable. Evaporation  is much less, in slow boiling, than in more rapid cooking.    MEASURING.--One of the most important principles to be observed in  the preparation of food for cooking, is accuracy in measuring. Many an  excellent recipe proves a failure simply from lack of care in this  respect. Measures are generally more convenient than weights, and are  more commonly used. The common kitchen cup, which holds a half pint, is  the one usually taken as the standard; if any other size is used, the  ingredients for the entire recipe should be measured by the same. The  following points should be observed in measuring:--    1. The teaspoons and tablespoons to be used in measuring, are the silver  spoons in general use.    2. Any material like flour, sugar, salt, that has been packed, should  either be sifted or stirred up lightly before measuring.    3. A cupful of dry material is measured level with the top of the cup,  without being packed down.    4. A cupful of liquid is all the cup will contain without running over.  Hold the cup in a saucer while measuring, to prevent spilling the liquid  upon the floor or table.    COMPARATIVE TABLE OF WEIGHTS AND MEASURES.--The following  comparative table of weights and measurements will aid in estimating  different materials:--    One heaping tablespoonful of sugar weighs one ounce.    Two round tablespoonfuls of flour weigh one ounce.    Two cupfuls of granulated sugar weigh one pound.    Two cupfuls of meal weigh one pound.    Four cupfuls of sifted flour weigh one pound.    One pint of oatmeal, cracked wheat, or other coarse grains, weighs about  one pound.    One pint of liquid weighs one pound.    One pint of meat chopped and packed solid weighs one pound.    Seven heaping tablespoonfuls of sugar = one cupful.    Five heaping tablespoonfuls of flour = one cupful.    Two cupfuls of liquid or dry material = one pint    Four cupfuls of liquid or dry material = one quart.    MIXING MATERIALS.--In the compounding of recipes, various modes are  employed for mingling together the different ingredients, chief of which  are _stirring_, _beating_, and _kneading_.    By _stirring_ is meant a continuous motion round and round with a spoon,  without lifting it from the mixture, except to scrape occasionally from  the sides of the dish any portion of the material that may cling to it.  It is not necessary that the stirring should be all in one direction, as  many cooks suppose. The object of the stirring is to thoroughly blend  the ingredients, and this may be accomplished as well by stirring--in  one direction as in another.    _Beating_ is for the purpose of incorporating as much air in the mixture  as possible. It should be done by dipping the spoon in and out, cutting  clear through and lifting from the bottom with each stroke. The process  must be continuous, and must never be interspersed with any stirring if  it is desired to retain the air within the mixture.    _Kneading_ is the mode by which materials already in the form of dough  are more thoroughly blended together; it also serves to incorporate air.  The process is more fully described in the chapter on \"Bread,\"    TEMPERATURE.--Many a cook fails and knows not why, because she does  not understand the influence of temperature upon materials and food.  Flour and liquids for unfermented breads cannot be too cold, while for  bread prepared with yeast, success is largely dependent upon a warm and  equable temperature throughout the entire process.    COOKING UTENSILS.--The earliest cookery was probably accomplished  without the aid of any utensils, the food being roasted by burying it in  hot ashes or cooked by the aid of heated stones; but modern cookery  necessitates the use of a greater or less variety of cooking utensils to  facilitate the preparation of food, most of which are so familiar to the  reader as to need no description. (A list of those needed for use will  be found on page 66.) Most of these utensils are manufactured from some  kind of metal, as iron, tin, copper, brass, etc. All metals are  dissolvable in certain substances, and some of those employed for making  household utensils are capable of forming most poisonous compounds when  used for cooking certain foods. This fact should lead to great care on  the part of the housewife, both in purchasing and in using utensils for  cooking purposes.    Iron utensils, although they are, when new, apt to discolor and impart  a disagreeable flavor to food cooked in them, are not objectionable from  a health standpoint, if kept clean and free from rust. Iron rust is the  result of the combination of the iron with oxygen, for which it has so  great an affinity that it will decompose water to get oxygen to unite  with; hence it is that iron utensils rust so quickly when not carefully  dried after using, or if left where they can collect moisture. This is  the reason why a coating of tallow, which serves to exclude the air and  moisture, will preserve ironware not in daily use from rusting.    \"Porcelain ware\" is iron lined with a hard, smooth enamel, and makes  safe and very desirable cooking utensils. German porcelain ware is  unexcelled for culinary purposes.    \"Granite ware\" is a material quite recently come into use,"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/12242"],[0,"Poems (#13)"],[1,"Acquaintance, just a few,  And chatted close with this grand thing  That don't remember you?    Past bows and invitations,  Past interview, and vow,  Past what ourselves can estimate, --  That makes the quick of woe!            XXII.    THE JOURNEY.    Our journey had advanced;  Our feet were almost come  To that odd fork in Being's road,  Eternity by term.    Our pace took sudden awe,  Our feet reluctant led.  Before were cities, but between,  The forest of the dead.    Retreat was out of hope, --  Behind, a sealed route,  Eternity's white flag before,  And God at every gate.            XXIII.    A COUNTRY BURIAL.    Ample make this bed.  Make this bed with awe;  In it wait till judgment break  Excellent and fair.    Be its mattress straight,  Be its pillow round;  Let no sunrise' yellow noise  Interrupt this ground.            XXIV.    GOING.    On such a night, or such a night,  Would anybody care  If such a little figure  Slipped quiet from its chair,    So quiet, oh, how quiet!  That nobody might know  But that the little figure  Rocked softer, to and fro?    On such a dawn, or such a dawn,  Would anybody sigh  That such a little figure  Too sound asleep did lie    For chanticleer to wake it, --  Or stirring house below,  Or giddy bird in orchard,  Or early task to do?    There was a little figure plump  For every little knoll,  Busy needles, and spools of thread,  And trudging feet from school.    Playmates, and holidays, and nuts,  And visions vast and small.  Strange that the feet so precious charged  Should reach so small a goal!            XXV.    Essential oils are wrung:  The attar from the rose  Is not expressed by suns alone,  It is the gift of screws.    The general rose decays;  But this, in lady's drawer,  Makes summer when the lady lies  In ceaseless rosemary.          XXVI.    I lived on dread; to those who know  The stimulus there is  In danger, other impetus  Is numb and vital-less.    As 't were a spur upon the soul,  A fear will urge it where  To go without the spectre's aid  Were challenging despair.            XXVII.    If I should die,  And you should live,  And time should gurgle on,  And morn should beam,  And noon should burn,  As it has usual done;  If birds should build as early,  And bees as bustling go, --  One might depart at option  From enterprise below!  'T is sweet to know that stocks will stand  When we with daisies lie,  That commerce will continue,  And trades as briskly fly.  It makes the parting tranquil  And keeps the soul serene,  That gentlemen so sprightly  Conduct the pleasing scene!            XXVIII.    AT LENGTH.    Her final summer was it,  And yet we guessed it not;  If tenderer industriousness  Pervaded her, we thought    A further force of life  Developed from within, --  When Death lit all the shortness up,  And made the hurry plain.    We wondered at our blindness, --  When nothing was to see  But her Carrara guide-post, --  At our stupidity,    When, duller than our dullness,  The busy darling lay,  So busy was she, finishing,  So leisurely were we!            XXIX.    GHOSTS.    One need not be a chamber to be haunted,  One need not be a house;  The brain has corridors surpassing  Material place.    Far safer, of a midnight meeting  External ghost,  Than an interior confronting  That whiter host.    Far safer through an Abbey gallop,  The stones achase,  Than, moonless, one's own self encounter  In lonesome place.    Ourself, behind ourself concealed,  Should startle most;  Assassin, hid in our apartment,  Be horror's least.    The prudent carries a revolver,  He bolts the door,  O'erlooking a superior spectre  More near.            XXX.    VANISHED.    She died, -- this was the way she died;  And when her breath was done,  Took up her simple wardrobe  And started for the sun.    Her little figure at the gate  The angels must have spied,  Since I could never find her  Upon the mortal side.            XXXI.    PRECEDENCE.    Wait till the majesty of Death  Invests so mean a brow!  Almost a powdered footman  Might dare to touch it now!    Wait till in everlasting robes  This democrat is dressed,  Then prate about \"preferment\"  And \"station\" and the rest!    Around this quiet courtier  Obsequious angels wait!  Full royal is his retinue,  Full purple is his state!    A lord might dare to lift the hat  To such a modest clay,  Since that my Lord, \"the Lord of lords\"  Receives unblushingly!            XXXII.    GONE.    Went up a year this evening!  I recollect it well!  Amid no bells nor bravos  The bystanders will tell!  Cheerful, as to the village,  Tranquil, as to repose,  Chastened, as to the chapel,  This humble tourist rose.  Did not talk of returning,  Alluded to no time  When, were the gales propitious,  We might look for him;  Was grateful for the roses  In life's diverse bouquet,  Talked softly of new species  To pick another day.    Beguiling thus the wonder,  The wondrous nearer drew;  Hands bustled at the moorings --  The crowd respectful grew.  Ascended from our vision  To countenances new!  A difference, a daisy,  Is all the rest I knew!            XXXIII.    REQUIEM.    Taken from men this morning,  Carried by men to-day,  Met by the gods with banners  Who marshalled her away.    One little maid from playmates,  One little mind from school, --  There must be guests in Eden;  All the rooms are full.    Far as the east from even,  Dim as the border star, --  Courtiers quaint, in kingdoms,  Our departed are.            XXXIV.    What inn is this  Where for the night  Peculiar traveller comes?  Who is the landlord?  Where the maids?  Behold, what curious rooms!  No ruddy fires on the hearth,  No brimming tankards flow.  Necromancer, landlord,  Who are these below?            XXXV.    It was not death, for I stood up,  And all the dead lie down;  It was not night, for all the bells  Put out their tongues, for noon.    It was not frost, for on my flesh  I felt siroccos crawl, --  Nor fire, for just my marble feet  Could keep a chancel cool.    And yet it tasted like them all;  The figures I have seen  Set orderly, for burial,  Reminded me of mine,    As if my life were shaven  And fitted to a frame,  And could not breathe without a key;  And 't was like midnight, some,    When everything that ticked has stopped,  And space stares, all around,  Or grisly frosts, first autumn morns,  Repeal the beating ground.    But most like chaos, -- stopless, cool, --  Without a chance or spar,  Or even a report of land  To justify despair.            XXXVI.    TILL THE END.    I should not dare to leave my friend,  Because -- because if he should die  While I was gone, and I -- too late --  Should reach the heart that wanted me;    If I should disappoint the eyes  That hunted, hunted so, to see,  And could not bear to shut until  They \"noticed\" me -- they noticed me;    If I should stab the patient faith  So sure I 'd come -- so sure I 'd come,  It listening, listening, went to sleep  Telling my tardy name, --    My heart would wish it broke before,  Since breaking then, since breaking then,  Were useless as next morning's sun,  Where midnight frosts had lain!            XXXVII.    VOID.    Great streets of silence led away  To neighborhoods of pause;  Here was no notice, no dissent,  No universe, no laws.    By clocks 't was morning, and for night  The bells at distance called;  But epoch had no basis here,  For period exhaled.            XXXVIII.    A throe upon the features  A hurry in the breath,  An ecstasy of parting  Denominated \"Death,\" --    An anguish at the mention,  Which, when to patience grown,  I 've known permission given  To rejoin its own.            XXXIX.    SAVED!    Of tribulation these are they  Denoted by the white;  The spangled gowns, a lesser rank  Of victors designate.    All these did conquer; but the ones  Who overcame most times  Wear nothing commoner than snow,  No ornament but palms.    Surrender is a sort unknown  On this superior soil;  Defeat, an outgrown anguish,  Remembered as the mile    Our panting ankle barely gained  When night devoured the road;  But we stood whispering in the house,  And all we said was \"Saved\"!            XL.    I think just how my shape will rise  When I shall be forgiven,  Till hair and eyes and timid head  Are out of sight, in heaven.    I think just how my lips will weigh  With shapeless, quivering prayer  That you, so late, consider me,  The sparrow of your care.    I mind me that of anguish sent,  Some drifts were moved away  Before my simple bosom broke, --  And why not this, if they?    And so, until delirious borne  I con that thing, -- \"forgiven,\" --  Till with long fright and longer trust  I drop my heart, unshriven!            XLI.    THE FORGOTTEN GRAVE.    After a hundred years  Nobody knows the place, --  Agony, that enacted there,  Motionless as peace.    Weeds triumphant ranged,  Strangers strolled and spelled  At the lone orthography  Of the elder dead.    Winds of summer fields  Recollect the way, --  Instinct picking up the key  Dropped by memory.            XLII.    Lay this laurel on the one  Too intrinsic for renown.  Laurel! veil your deathless tree, --  Him you chasten, that is he!                  POEMS    by EMILY DICKINSON    Third Series          Edited by    MABEL LOOMIS TODD            It's all I have to bring to-day,        This, and my heart beside,      This, and my heart, and all the fields,        And all the meadows wide.      Be sure you count, should I forget, --        Some one the sum could tell, --      This, and my heart, and all the bees        Which in the clover dwell.        PREFACE.    The intellectual activity of Emily Dickinson was so great that  a large and characteristic choice is still possible among her  literary material, and this third volume of her verses is put  forth in response to the repeated wish of the admirers of her  peculiar genius. Much of Emily Dickinson's prose was rhythmic,  --even rhymed, though frequently not set apart in lines. "]]]
