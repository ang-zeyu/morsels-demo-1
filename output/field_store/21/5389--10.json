This alliance which is offered to  you will bring upon France the Germans, the Spaniards, and the English;  think of the great mischief which will ensue--human bloodshed,  destruction of towns, of good families and of churches, violation of  women, and other calamities that come of war.  Reflect also on the great  treason you are committing; when the king has started for Italy and left  you in France, putting his trust in you, you will go and stab him in the  back, and destroy him as well as his kingdom.  You belong to the House of  France, and are one of the chief princes of the country, so beloved and  esteemed by all that everybody is gladdened at the very sight of you.  If  you should come to be the cause of so great ruin, you will be the most  accursed creature that ever was, accursed for a thousand years after your  death.  For the love of God consider all this; and if you have no regard  for the king and Madame his mother, who, you say, are treating you  wrongfully, at least have some regard for the queen and the princes her  children, and do not wilfully cause the perdition of this kingdom, whose  enemies, when you have let them into it, will drive you out of it  yourself.\"  \"But, cousin,\" said the constable, quite overcome, \"what  would you have me to do?  The king and Madame mean to destroy me; they  have already taken away a part of my possessions.\"  \"Sir,\" replied  Saint-Vallier, \"give up, I pray you, all these wicked enterprises; commend  yourself to God, and speak frankly to the king.\"  If we are to believe  Saint-Vallier's deposition, when, six months afterwards, he was put on  his trial and convicted for his participation in the plot and treason,  the constable was sufficiently affected by his representations to promise  that he would abandon his design and make his peace with the king: but  facts refute this assertion.  In the latter months of 1523, the  stipulations of the treaty concluded at Montbrison on the 18th of July  were put into execution by all the contracting parties; letters of  exchange from Henry VIII. were sent to Bale for the German lanzknechts he  was to pay; the lanzknechts crossed the Rhine on the 26th of August, and  marched through Franche-Comte in spite of its neutrality; the English  landed at Calais between the 23d and 30th of August, to co-operate with  the Flemings; the Spaniards began the campaign, on the 6th of September,  in the direction of the Pyrenees; and the Duke, of Bourbon on his side  took all the necessary measures for forming a junction with his allies,  and playing that part in the coalition which had been assigned to him.    According to what appears, he had harbored a design of commencing his  enterprise with a very bold stroke.  Being informed that Francis I. was  preparing to go in person and wage war upon Italy, he had resolved to  carry him off on the road to Lyons, and, when once he had the king in his  hands, he flattered himself he would do as he pleased with the kingdom.  If his attempt were unsuccessful, be would bide his time until Francis I.  was engaged in Milaness, Charles V. had entered Guienne, and Henry VIII.  was in Picardy: he would then assemble a thousand men-at-arms, six  thousand foot and twelve thousand lanzknechts, and would make for the  Alps to cut the king off from any communication with France.  This plan  rested upon the assumption that the king would, as he had announced,  leave the constable in France with an honorable title and an apparent  share in the government of the kingdom, though really isolated and  debarred from action.  But Francis had full cognizance of the details of  the conspiracy through two Norman gentlemen whom the constable had  imprudently tried to get to join in it, and who, not content with  refusing, had revealed the matter at confession to the Bishop of Lisieux,  who had lost no time in giving information to Sire de Breze, grand  seneschal of Normandy.  Breze at once reported it to the king, and his  letter ran: \"Sir, there is need also to take care of yourself, for there  has been talk of an attempt to carry you off between here and Lyons, and  conduct you to a strong place in the Bourbon district or on the borders  of Auvergne.\"  Being at last seriously disquieted for the consequences of  his behavior towards the constable, Francis took two resolutions: one  was, not to leave him in France during his own absence; the other was,  to go and see him at Moulins, at the same time taking all necessary  precautions for his own safety, and win him over once more by announcing  an intention of taking him off to Italy and sharing with him the command  of the army.  On approaching Moulins the king recalled the lanzknechts  who had already passed the town, entered it himself surrounded by his  guards, and took up his quarters in the castle, of which he seized the  keys.  At his first interview with the constable, who was slightly  indisposed and pretended to be very much so, \"I know,\" said he, \"that you  are keeping up a connection with the emperor, and that he is trying to  turn your discontent to advantage, so as to beguile you; but I have faith  in you; you are of the House of France and of the line of Bourbon, which  has never produced a traitor.\"  \"It is true, sir,\" said the constable,  without any confusion; \"the emperor, informed by public rumor of the  position to which I am reduced, sent Beaurain to offer me an asylum in  his dominions and a fortune suitable to my birth and my rank; but I know  the value of empty compliments.  Hearing that your Majesty was to pass by  Moulins, I thought it my duty to wait and disclose this secret to you  myself rather than intrust it to a letter.\"  The king showed signs of  being touched.  \"I have an idea of taking you away with me to Italy,\"  said he: \"would you come with me willingly?\"  \"Not only to Italy,\" was  the answer, \"but to the end of the world.  The doctors assure me that I  shall soon be in a condition to bear the motion of a litter; I already  feel better; your Majesty's kindnesses will soon complete my cure.\"  Francis testified his satisfaction.  Some of his advisers, with more  distrust and more prevision, pressed him to order the arrest of so  dangerous a man, notwithstanding his protestations; but Francis refused.  According to what some historians say, if he had taken off the  sequestration laid upon the constable's possessions, actually restored  them to him, as well as discharged the debts due to him and paid his  pensions, and carried him off to Italy, if, in a word, he had shown a  bold confidence and given back to him at once and forever the whole of  his position, he would, perhaps, have weaned him from his plot, and would  have won back to himself and to France that brave and powerful servant.  But Francis wavered between distrust and hope; he confined himself to  promising the constable restitution of his possessions if the decree of  Parliament was unfavorable to him; he demanded of him a written  engagement to remain always faithful to him and to join him in Italy as  soon as his illness would allow him; and, on taking leave of him, left  with him one of his own gentlemen, Peter de Brentonniere, Lord of Warthy,  with orders to report to the king as to his health.  In this officer  Bourbon saw nothing more or less than a spy, and in the king's promises  nothing but vain words dependent as they were upon the issue of a lawsuit  which still remained an incubus upon him.  He had no answer for words but  words; he undertook the engagements demanded of him by the king without  considering them binding; and he remained ill at Moulins, waiting till  events should summon him to take action with his foreign allies.    This state of things lasted far nearly three weeks.  The king remained  stationary at Lyons waiting for the constable to join him; and the  constable, saying he was ready to set out and going so far as to actually  begin his march, was doing his three leagues a day by litter, being  always worse one day than he was the day before.  Peter de Warthy, the  officer whom the king had left with him, kept going and coming from Lyons  to Moulins and from Moulins to Lyons, conveying to the constable the  king's complaints and to the king the constable's excuses, without  bringing the constable to decide upon joining the king at Lyons and  accompanying him into Italy, or the king upon setting out for Italy  without the constable.  \"I would give a hundred thousand crowns,\" the  king sent word to Bourbon, \"to be in Lombardy.\"  \"The king will do well,\"  answered Bourbon, \"to get there as soon as possible, for despatch is  needful beyond everything.\"  When Warthy insisted strongly, the constable  had him called up to his bedside; and \"I feel myself,\" said he, \"the  most unlucky man in the world not to be able to serve the king; but if I  were to be obstinate, the doctors who are attending me would not answer  for my life, and I am even worse than the doctors think.  I shall never  be in a condition to do the king service any more.  I am going back to my  native air, and, if I recover a day's health, I will go to the king.\"  \"The king will be terribly put out,\" said Warthy; and he returned to  Lyons to report these remarks of the real or pretended invalid.  While he  was away, the constable received from England and Spain news which made  him enter actively upon his preparations; he heard at the same time that  the king was having troops marched towards Bourbonness so as to lay  violent hands on him if he did not obey; he, therefore, decided to go and  place himself in security in his strong castle of Chantelle, where he  could await the movements of his allies; he mounted his horse, did six  leagues at one stretch, and did not draw bridle until he had entered  Chantelle.  Warthy speedily came and rejoined him.  He found "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/11956"],[0,"A Popular History of France from the Earliest Times, Volume 6 (#13)"],[1,"seized all France, capital and  province.  He created some fifteen hundred millions of new shares,  promising his shareholders a dividend of twelve per cent.  From all parts  silver and gold flowed into his hands; everywhere the paper of the Bank  was substituted for coin.  The delirium had mastered all minds.  The  street called Quincampoix, for a long time past devoted to the operations  of bankers, had become the usual meeting-place of the greatest lords as  well as of discreet burgesses.  It had been found necessary to close the  two ends of the street with gates, open from six A. M. to nine P. M.;  every house harbored business agents by the hundred; the smallest room  was let for its weight in gold.  The workmen who made the paper for the  bank-notes could not keep up with the consumption.  The most modest  fortunes suddenly became colossal, lacqueys of yesterday were  millionaires to-morrow; extravagance followed the progress of this  outburst of riches, and the price of provisions followed the progress of  extravagance.  Enthusiasm was at its height in favor of the able author  of so many benefits.  Law became a convert to Catholicism, and was made  comptroller-general; all the court was at his feet.  \"My son was looking  for a duchess to escort my granddaughter to Genoa,\" writes Madame, the  Regent's mother.  \"'Send and choose one at Madame Law's,' said I; 'you  will find them all sitting in her drawing-room.'\"  Law's triumph was  complete; the hour of his fall was about to strike.    At the pinnacle of his power and success the new comptroller-general fell  into no illusion as to the danger of the position.  \"He had been forced  to raise seven stories on foundations which he had laid for only three,\"  said a contemporary, as clear-sighted as impartial.  Some large  shareholders were already beginning to quietly realize their profits.  The warrants of the _Compagnie des Indes_ had been assimilated to the  bank-notes; and the enormous quantity of paper tended to lower its value.  First, there was a prohibition against making payments in silver above  ten francs, and in gold above three hundred.  Soon afterwards money was  dislegalized as a tender, and orders were issued to take every kind to  the Bank on pain of confiscation, half to go to the informer.  Informing  became a horrible trade; a son denounced his father.  The Regent openly  violated law, and had this miscreant punished.  The prince one day saw  President Lambert de Vernon coming to visit him.  \"I am come,\" said the  latter, \"to denounce to your Royal Highness a man who has five hundred  thousand livres in gold.\"  The Duke of Orleans drew back a step.  \"Ah,  Mr. President,\" he cried, \"what low vocation have you taken to?\"  \"Monseigneur,\" rejoined the president, \"I am obeying the law; but your  Royal Highness may be quite easy; it is myself whom I have come to  denounce, in hopes of retaining at least a part of this sum, which I  prefer to all the bank-notes.\"  \"My money is at the king's service,\" was  the proud remark of Nicolai, premier president of the Exchequer-Chamber,  \"but it belongs to nobody.\"  The great mass of the nation was of the same  opinion as the two presidents; forty-five millions only found their way  to the Bank; gold and silver were concealed everywhere.  The crisis was  becoming imminent; Law boldly announced that the value of the notes was  reduced by a half.  The public outcry was so violent that the Regent was  obliged to withdraw the edict, as to which the council had not been  consulted.  \"Since Law became comptroller-general, his head has been  turned,\" said the prince.  That same evening Law was arrested by the  major of the Swiss; it was believed to be all over with him, but the  admirable order in which were his books, kept by double entry after the  Italian manner, as yet unknown in France, and the ingenious expedients  he indicated for restoring credit, gave his partisans a moment's fresh  confidence.  He ceased to be comptroller-general, but he remained  director of the Bank.  The death-blow, however, had been dealt his  system, for a panic terror had succeeded to the insensate enthusiasm of  the early days.  The Prince of Conti had set the example of getting back  the value of his notes; four wagons had been driven up to his house laden  with money.  It was suffocation at the doors of the Bank, changing small  notes, the only ones now payable in specie.  Three men were crushed to  death on one day in the crowd.  It was found necessary to close the  entrances to Quincampoix Street, in order to put a stop to the feverish  tumult arising from desperate speculation.  The multitude moved to the  Place Vendome; shops and booths were thrown up; there was a share-fair;  this ditty was everywhere sung in the streets:--    [Illustration: La Rue Quincampoix---68]                  \"On On Monday I bought share on share;                 On Tuesday I was a millionaire;                 On Wednesday took a grand abode;                 On Thursday in my carriage rode;                 On Friday drove to the Opera-ball;                 On Saturday came to the paupers' hall.\"    To restore confidence, Law conceived the idea of giving the seals back to  D'Aguesseau; and the Regent authorized him to set out for Fresnes.  In  allusion to this step, so honorable for the magistrate who was the object  of it, Law afterwards wrote from Venice to the Regent, \"In my labors I  desired to be useful to a great people, as the chancellor can bear me  witness.  .  .  .  At his return I offered him my shares, which were then  worth more than a hundred millions, to be distributed by him amongst  those who had need of them.\"  The chancellor came back, though his  influence could neither stop the evil, nor even assuage the growing  disagreement between the Duke of Orleans and the Parliament.  None could  restore the public sense of security, none could prevent the edifice from  crumbling to pieces.  With ruin came crimes.  Count Horn, belonging to  the family of the celebrated Count Horn, who was beheaded under Philip  II., in company with Count Lamoral d'Egmont, murdered at an inn a poor  jobber whom he had inveigled thither on purpose to steal his pocket-book.  In spite of all his powerful family's entreaties, Count Horn died on the  wheel, together with one of his accomplices.  It was represented to the  Regent that the count's house had the honor of being connected with his.  \"Very, well, gentlemen,\" said he, \"then I will share the shame with you,\"  and he remained inflexible.    The public wrath and indignation fastened henceforth upon Law, the author  and director of a system which had given rise to so many hopes, and had  been the cause of so many woes.  His carriage was knocked to pieces in  the streets.  President de Mesmes entered the Grand Chamber, singing with  quite a solemn air,--             \"Sirs, sirs, great news!  What is it?            It's--They've smashed Law's carriage all to bits.\"    The whole body jumped up, more regardful of their hatred than of their  dignity; and \"Is Law torn in pieces?\"  was the cry.  Law had taken refuge  at the Palais Royal.  One day he appeared at the theatre in the Regent's  box; low murmurs recalled to the Regent's mind the necessity for  prudence; in the end he got Law away secretly in a carriage lent him by  the Duke of Bourbon.    Law had brought with him to France a considerable fortune; he had  scarcely enough to live upon when he retired to Venice, where he died  some years later (1729), convinced to the last of the utility of his  system, at the same time that he acknowledged the errors he had committed  in its application.  \"I do not pretend that I did not make mistakes,\" he  wrote from his retreat; \"I know I did, and that if I had to begin again I  should do differently.  I should go more slowly but more surely, and I  should not expose the state and my own person to the dangers which may  attend the derangement of a general system.\"  \"There was neither avarice  nor rascality in what he did,\" says St. Simon; \"he was a gentle, kind,  respectful man, whom excess of credit and of fortune had not spoilt, and  whose bearing, equipage, table, and furniture could not offend anybody.  He bore with singular patience and evenness the obstructions that were  raised against his operations, until at the last, finding himself short  of means, and nevertheless seeking for them and wishing to present a  front, he became crusty, gave way to temper, and his replies were  frequently ill-considered.  He was a man of system, calculation,  comparison, well informed and profound in that sort of thing, who was the  dupe of his Mississippi, and in good faith believed in forming great and  wealthy establishments in America.  He reasoned Englishwise, and did not  know how opposed to those kinds of establishments are the levity of our  nation and the inconveniences of a despotic government, which has a  finger in everything, and under which what one minister does is always  destroyed or changed by his successor.\"  The disasters caused by Law's  system have recoiled upon his memory.  Forgotten are his honesty, his  charity, his interest in useful works; remembered is nothing but the  imprudence of his chimerical hopes and the fatal result of his  enterprises, as deplorable in their effects upon the moral condition of  France, as upon her wealth and her credit.    The Regent's rash infatuation for a system, as novel as it was seductive,  had borne its fruits.  The judgment which his mother had pronounced upon  Philip of Orleans was justified to the last.  \"The fairies,\" said Madame,  \"were all invited to the birth of my son; and each endowed him with some  happy quality.  But one wicked fairy, who had been forgotten, came  likewise, leaning upon her stick, and not being able to annul her  sisters' gifts, declared that the prince should never know how to make  use of them.\"    Throughout the successive periods of"]]]
