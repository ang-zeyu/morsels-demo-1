The singers  at St. Augustine's are of more than ordinary merit. Two or three of  them have most excellent voices; and the conjoint efforts of the  body are in many respects capital. Their reading is accurate, their  time good, and their melody frequently constitutes a treat which  would do a power of good to those who hear the vocalisation of many  ordinary psalm-singers whose great object through life is to kill  old tunes and inflict grevious bodily harm upon new ones. There is a  very good organ at St. Augustine's, and it is blown well and played  well.    Usually there are three priests at the mission; but on our visit  there were only two--the Rev. Canon Walker, and the Rev. J.  Hawkesworth; and if you had to travel from the lowest point in  Cornwall to the farthest house in Caithness you wouldn't find two  more kindly men. We Protestants talk volubly about the grim,  grinding character of priests, about their tyrannous influence, and  their sinister sacerdotalism; but there is a good deal of extra  colouring matter in the picture. Whatever their religion may be, and  however much we may differ from it, this at least we have always  found amongst priests--excellent education, amazing devotion to  duty, gentlemanly behaviour, and in social life much geniality. They  have studied all subjects; they know something about everything;  their profession necessarily makes them acquainted with each phase  and feeling of life. The Rev. Canon Walker is a good type of a  thoroughly English priest and of a genuine Lancashire man. He is  unassuming, obliging in manner, careful in his duties, fonder of a  good pinch of snuff than of warring about creeds, much more in love  with a quiet chat than of platform violence, and would far sooner  offer you a glass of wine, and ask you to take another when you had  done it, than fight with you about piety. He is a man of peace, of  homely, disposition, of kindly thought, unobtrusive in style,  sincere in action, with nothing bombastic in his nature, and nothing  self-righteous in his speech. His sermons are neither profound nor  simple--they are made up of fair medium material; and are discharged  rapidly. There is no effort at rhetorical flourish in his style; a  simple lifting of the right hand, with an easy swaying motion, is  all the \"action\" you perceive. Canon Walker speaks with a rapidity  seldom noticed. Average talkers can get through about 120 words in a  minute; Canon Walker can manage 200 nicely, and show no signs of  being out of breath.    The Rev. Mr. Hawkesworth--a bright-eyed, rubicund-featured  gentleman, with a slight disposition to corporeal rotundity--is the  second priest. He is a sharp, kindly-humoured gentleman, and does  not appear to have suffered in either mind or body by a four years  residence in Rome. Mr. Hawkesworth is a practical priest, a good  singer, and a hard worker. He resides with Canon Walker in a  spacious house adjoining St. Augustine's. No unusual sounds have  ever been heard to proceed from the residence, and it may fairly be  inferred that they dwell together to harmony. The house is  substantially furnished. The library within it is not very large,  but what it lacks in bulk is made up for by variety. Its contents  range from the Clockmaker of Sam Slick to the Imitation of Thomas a  Kempis, from Little Dorrit to the Greek Lexicon. Not far from St.  Augustine's Church there is a convent. It is the old Larkhill  mansion transmuted, and is one of the most pleasantly situated  houses in this locality. In front of it you have flowers of  delicious hues, shrubs of every kind, grassy undulations, rare old  shady trees, a small artificial lake, a fountain--shall we go on  piling up the agony of beauty until we reach a Claude Melnotte  altitude? It is unnecessary; all we need add is this--that the  grounds are a lovely picture, delightfully formed, and most snugly  set. The convent is a large, clean, airy establishment. The entrance  hall is handsome; some of the apartments are choicely furnished, the  walls being decorated with pictures, &c., made by either the nuns or  their pupils. The convent includes apartments for the reception of  visitors, a small chapel, with deeply-toned light, and exquisitely  arranged; dining rooms, sitting rooms, two or three school rooms,  lavatories, sculleries, dormitories, and a gigantic kitchen,  reminding one of olden houses wherein were vast open fire-places,  massive spits, and every apparatus for making meat palateable and  life enjoyable. The 22 nuns before referred to live at this convent.  They belong to the order of \"Faithful Companions;\" they lead quiet,  industrious lives--have no Saurin-Starr difficulties, and appear to  be contented.    At the convent there are 33 pupils--some from a distance, others  belonging the town. They are taught every accomplishment; look very  healthy; and, when we saw them, seemed not only comfortable but  merry. Near the convent there is a commodious girls' and infants'  school connected with St. Augustine's, the general average  attendance being about 240. In Vauxhall-road there is another large,  excellently built school belonging to the same Church, and set apart  for boys. The attendance is not very numerous. At both there is room  for many more scholars, and if religious bigotry did not operate in  some quarters, and prevent Catholic children going to those schools  recognising the principles of their own faith, the attendance at  each would be much better than it is. Taking the district in its  entirety, it is industriously worked by the Catholics. They deserve  praise for their energy. Their object is to push on Catholicism and  improve the secular position of the inhabitants, and they do this  with a zeal most praiseworthy. This finishes our Augustinian  mission.        QUAKERS' MEETING HOUSE.        I love Quaker ways and Quaker worship. I venerate the Quaker  principles. It does me good for the rest of the day when I meet any  of their people in my path. When I am ruled or disturbed by any  occurrence, the sight or quiet voice of a Quaker acts upon me as a  ventilator, lightening the air, and taking off a load from the  bosom; but I cannot like the Quakers, as Desdemona would say, \"to  live with them.\"--Charles Lamb.    Sheep, leather, and religion were the principal things which George  Fox, the founder of Quakerism, looked after. In boyhood he was a  shepherd, in youth a shoemaker, in manhood an expounder of  Christianity. No one could have had a series of occupations more  comprehensive or practical. The history of the world proves that it  is as important for men to look after their mutton as to \"save their  bacon;\" that, after all, \"there is nothing like leather;\" and that  there can be nothing better than religion. 219 years since the  ancestors of those who now follow the \"inner light\" were termed  Quakers. An English judge--Gervaise Bennet--gave them this name at  Derby, and it is said that he did so because Fox \"bid them quake at  the word of the Lord.\" Theologically, Quakers are a peculiar people;  they believe in neither rites nor ceremonies, in neither prayer-  books nor hymn-books, in neither lesson reading, nor pulpit  homilies, nor sacraments. They are guided by their spiritual  feelings, and have a strong idea that a man has no right to open his  mouth when he has got nothing to say, and that he should avoid  keeping it shut when he has something worth uttering.    This is an excellent plan, and the world would be considerably  benefited if it were universally observed both in religion and  every-day life. Creation is killed and done for daily through an  everlasting torrent of meaningless talk. Compact and quiet as it may  appear, Quakerism has had its schisms and internal feuds. Early in  this century, the White Quakers, who dressed themselves in light  suits when outside and didn't dress at all--stripped themselves  after the manner of Adamites--when within doors, created much furore  in Ireland. About 30 years since, the Hicksite Quakers, who denied  the divinity of Christ and the authority of the Bible, made their  advent; afterwards the Beaconite Quakers put in an appearance; and  then came the Wilburites. Taking all sections into account, there  are at present about 130,000 Quakers in the world, and Preston  contributes just seventy genuine ones to their number. In this  locality they remain unchanged. Today they are neither smaller nor  larger, numerically, than they were thirty years age. In the early  days of local Quakerism, the country rather than the town was its  favourite situation. Newton, Freckleton, Rawcliffe, and Chipping  contained respectively at one time many more Quakers than Preston,  but the old stations were gradually broken up, and Preston  eventually got the majority of their members. A building located  somewhere between Everton-gardens and Spring-gardens was first used  as a meeting-house by them. In 1784 a better place was erected by  the Friends, on a piece of land contiguous to and on the north side  of Friargate; and in 1847 it was rebuilt. Although no one was  officially engaged to map out the place, a good deal of learned  architectural gas was disengaged in its design and construction. It  was made three times larger than its congregational requirements--  the object being to accommodate those who might assemble at the  periodical district meetings. Special attention was also paid to the  loftiness of the building--to the height of its ceiling. One or two  of the amateur designers having a finger in the architectural pie  had serious notions as to the importance of air space. They had  studied the"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/10484"],[0,"Beacon Lights of History, Volume 03: Ancient Achievements (#13)"],[1,"enabled them to rear vast  edifices with the humblest materials, to build bridges, aqueducts,  sewers, amphitheatres, and triumphal arches, as well as temples and  palaces. The merits of the arch have never been lost sight of by  succeeding generations, and it is an essential element in the  magnificent Gothic cathedrals of the Middle Ages. Its application  extends to domes and cupolas, to floors and corridors and roofs, and to  various other parts of buildings where economy of material and labor is  desired. It was applied extensively to doorways and windows, and is an  ornament as well as a utility. The most imposing forms of Roman  architecture may be traced to a knowledge of the properties of the arch,  and as brick was more extensively used than any other material, the arch  was invaluable. The imperial palace on Mount Palatine, the Pantheon  (except its portico and internal columns), the temples of Peace, of  Venus and Rome, and of Minerva Medica, were of brick. So were the great  baths of Titus, Caracalla, and Diocletian, the villa of Hadrian, the  city walls, the villa of Mecaenas at Tivoli, and most of the palaces of  the nobility,--although, like many of the temples, they were faced with  stone. The Colosseum was of travertine, a cheap white limestone, and  faced with marble. It was another custom to stucco the surface of brick  walls, as favorable to decorations. In consequence of the invention of  the arch, the Romans erected a greater variety of fine structures than  either the Greeks or Egyptians, whose public edifices were chiefly  confined to temples. The arch entered into almost every structure,  public or private, and superseded the use of long stone-beams, which  were necessary in the Grecian temples, as also of wooden timbers, in the  use of which the Romans were not skilled, and which do not really  pertain to architecture: an imposing edifice must always be constructed  of stone or brick. The arch also enabled the Romans to economize in the  use of costly marbles, of which they were very fond, as well as of other  stones. Some of the finest columns were made of Egyptian granite, very  highly polished.    The extensive application of the arch doubtless led to the deterioration  of the Grecian architecture, since it blended columns with arcades, and  thus impaired the harmony which so peculiarly marked the temples of  Athens and Corinth; and as taste became vitiated with the decline of  the empire, monstrous combinations took place, which were a great fall  from the simplicity of the Parthenon and the interior of the Pantheon.    But whatever defects marked the age of Diocletian and Constantine, it  can never be questioned that the Romans carried architecture to a  perfection rarely attained in our times. They may not have equalled the  severe simplicity of their teachers the Greeks, but they surpassed them  in the richness of their decorations, and in all buildings designed for  utility, especially in private houses and baths and theatres.    The Romans do not seem to have used other than semicircular arches. The  Gothic, or Pointed, or Christian architecture, as it has been variously  called, was the creation of the Middle Ages, and arose almost  simultaneously in Europe after the first Crusade, so that it would seem  to be of Eastern origin. But it was a graft on the old Roman arch, in  the curve of the ellipse rather than the circle.    Aside from this invention of the arch, to which we are indebted for the  most beautiful ecclesiastical structures ever erected, we owe everything  in architecture to the Greeks and Romans. We have found out no new  principles which were not known to Vitruvius. No one man was the  inventor or creator of the wonderful structures which ornamented the  cities of the ancient world. We have the names of great architects, who  reared various and faultless models, but they all worked upon the same  principles, and these can never be subverted; so that in architecture  the ancients are our schoolmasters, whose genius we revere the more we  are acquainted with their works. What more beautiful than one of those  grand temples which the cultivated heathen Greeks erected to the worship  of their unknown gods!--the graduated and receding stylobate as a base  for the fluted columns, rising at regular distances in all their severe  proportion and matchless harmony, with their richly carved capitals  supporting an entablature of heavy stones, most elaborately moulded and  ornamented with the figures of plants and animals; and rising above  this, on the ends of the temple, or over a portico several columns deep,  the pediment, covered with chiselled cornices, with still richer  ornaments rising from the apices and at the feet, all carved in white  marble, and then spread over an area larger than any modern churches,  making a forest of columns to bear aloft those ponderous beams of stone,  without anything tending to break the continuity of horizontal lines, by  which the harmony and simplicity of the whole are regulated! So  accurately squared and nicely adjusted were the stones and pillars of  which these temples were composed, that there was scarcely need even of  cement. Without noise or confusion or sound of hammers did those  temples rise, since all their parts were cut and carved in the distant  quarries, and with mathematical precision. And within the cella, nearly  concealed by surrounding columns, were the statues of the gods, and the  altars on which incense was offered, or sacrifices made. In every part,  interior and exterior, do we see a matchless proportion and beauty,  whether in the shaft or the capital or the frieze or the pilaster or the  pediment or the cornices, or even the mouldings,--everywhere grace and  harmony, which grow upon the mind the more they are contemplated. The  greatest evidence of the matchless creative genius displayed in those  architectural wonders is that after two thousand years, and with all the  inventions of Roman and modern artists, no improvement has been made;  and those edifices which are the admiration of our own times are deemed  beautiful as they approximate the ancient models, which will forever  remain objects of imitation. No science can make two and two other than  four; no art can make a Doric temple different from the Parthenon  without departing from the settled principles of beauty and proportion  which all ages have indorsed. Such were the Greeks and Romans in an art  which is one of the greatest indices of material civilization, and which  by them was derived from geometrical forms, or the imitation of Nature.    The genius displayed by the ancients in sculpture is even more  remarkable than their skill in architecture. Sculpture was carried to  perfection only by the Greeks; but they did not originate the art, since  we read of sculptured images from the remotest antiquity. The earliest  names of sculptors are furnished by the Old Testament. Assyria and Egypt  are full of relics to show how early this art was cultivated. It was not  carried to perfection as early, probably, as architecture; but rude  images of gods, carved in wood, are as old as the history of idolatry.  The history of sculpture is in fact identified with that of idols. The  Egyptians were probably the first who made any considerable advances in  the execution of statues. Those which remain are rude, simple, uniform,  without beauty or grace (except a certain serenity of facial expression  which seems to pervade all their portraiture), but colossal and grand.  Nearly two thousand years before Christ the walls of Thebes were  ornamented with sculptured figures, even as the gates of Babylon were  made of sculptured bronze. The dimensions of Egyptian colossal figures  surpass those of any other nation. The sitting statues of Memnon at  Thebes are fifty feet in height, and the Sphinx is twenty-five,--all of  granite. The number of colossal statues was almost incredible. The  sculptures found among the ruins of Karnak must have been made nearly  four thousand years ago. They exhibit great simplicity of design, but  have not much variety of expression. They are generally carved from the  hardest stones, and finished so nicely that we infer that the Egyptians  were acquainted with the art of hardening metals for their tools to a  degree not known in our times. But we see no ideal grandeur among any of  the remains of Egyptian sculpture; however symmetrical or colossal,  there is no diversity of expression, no trace of emotion, no  intellectual force,--everything is calm, impassive, imperturbable. It  was not until sculpture came into the hands of the Greeks that any  remarkable excellence in grace of form or expression of face was  reached. But the progress of development was slow. The earliest carvings  were rude wooden images of the gods, and more than a thousand years  elapsed before the great masters were produced whose works marked the  age of Pericles.    It is not my object to give a history of the development of the plastic  art, but to show the great excellence it attained in the hands of  immortal sculptors.    The Greeks had an intuitive perception of the beautiful, and to this  great national trait we ascribe the wonderful progress which sculpture  made. Nature was most carefully studied by the Greek artists, and that  which was most beautiful in Nature became the object of their imitation.  They even attained to an ideal excellence, since they combined in a  single statue what could not be found in a single individual,--as Zeuxis  is said to have studied the beautiful forms of seven virgins of Crotona  in order to paint his famous picture of Venus. Great as was the beauty  of Phryne or Aspasia or Lais, yet no one of them could have served for a  perfect model; and it required a great sensibility to beauty in order to  select and idealize what was most perfect in the human figure. Beauty  was adored in Greece, and every means were"]]]
