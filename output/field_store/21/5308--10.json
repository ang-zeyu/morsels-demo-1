After this treatment and  exposure to light the shells will have a blood-red luminous appearance  in the dark. The shells thus prepared are used with sulphur and  the phosphide and sulphide of calcium to produce a phosphorescent  composition, as follows: One hundred parts, by weight, of the shells,  prepared as above, are intimately mixed with twenty parts, by weight, of  sulphur. This mixture is placed in a crucible or retort and heated to a  white heat for four or five hours, when it is to be removed and forty  parts more of sulphur, one and one-half parts of calcium phosphide, and  one-half part of chemically pure sulphide of calcium added. The mixture  is then heated for about ninety minutes to an extreme white heat. When  cold, and after exposure to light, this mixture will become luminous.  Instead of these two ignitions, the same object may be in a measure  accomplished by the addition of the full amount of sulphur with the  phosphide and sulphide of calcium and raising it to a white heat but  once. The calcium phosphide is prepared by igniting phosphorus in  connection with newly slaked lime made chemically pure by calcination.  The condition of the shells when the sulphur is added is not material;  but the heat renders them porous and without moisture, so that they will  absorb the salt to as great an extent as possible. Where calcined shells  are mixed with solid salt, the absorbing power of the shells is greatly  diminished by the necessary exposure, and there will be a lack of  uniformity in the saturation. On the contrary, by plunging the red-hot  shells in the saline solution the greatest uniformity is attained.    Instead of using clam shells as the base of my improved composition, I  may use other forms of sea shells--such as oyster shells, etc.    I claim as new:    1. The herein described process of manufacturing phosphorescent  materials, which consists in heating sea shells red-hot, treating them  while heated with a bath of brine, then, after removal from the bath,  mixing sulphur and phosphide and sulphide of calcium therewith, and  finally subjecting the mixture to a white heat, substantially as and for  the purpose described.    2. The described process, which consists in placing clean and red-hot  clam shells in a saturated solution of sea salt, and then drying them,  for the purpose specified.           *       *       *       *       *          BOXWOOD AND ITS SUBSTITUTES.    [Footnote: Prize essay written for the International Forestry  Exhibition, Edinburgh.]    By JOHN R. JACKSON. A.L.S., Curator of the Museums, Royal Gardens, Ken.      The importance of the discovery of a hard, compact, and even grained  wood, having all the characteristics of boxwood, and for which it would  form an efficient substitute, cannot be overestimated; and if such  a discovery should be one of the results of the present Forestry  Exhibition, one of its aims will have been fulfilled.    For several years past the gradual diminution in the supplies of  boxwood, and the deterioration in its quality, have occupied the  attention of hardwood merchants, of engravers, and of scientific men.    Of merchants, because of the difficulties in obtaining supplies to meet  the ever increasing demand; of engravers, because of the higher prices  asked for the wood, and the difficulty of securing wood of good size and  firm texture, so that the artistic excellence of the engraving might be  maintained; and of the man of science, who was specially interested  in the preservation of the indigenous boxwood forests, and in the  utilization of other woods, natives, it might be, of far distant  countries, whose adaptation would open not only a new source of revenue,  but would also be the means of relieving the strain upon existing  boxwood forests.    While by far the most important use of boxwood is for engraving  purposes, it must be borne in mind that the wood is also applied to  numerous other uses, such, for instance, as weaving shuttles, for  mathematical instruments, turnery purposes, carving, and for various  ornamental articles, as well as for inlaying in cabinet work. The  question, therefore, of finding suitable substitutes for boxwood divides  itself into two branches, first, directly for engraving purposes, and,  secondly, to supply its place for the other uses to which it is now put.  This, to a certain extent, might set free some of the boxwood so used,  and leave it available for the higher purposes of art. At the same time,  it must not be forgotten that much of the wood used for general purposes  is unsuited for engraving, and can only therefore be used by the turner  or cabinet maker. Nevertheless, the application of woods other than box  for purposes for which that wood is now used would tend to lessen the  demand for box, and thus might have an effect in lowering the price.    So far back as 1875 a real uneasiness began to be felt as to the future  supplies of box. In the _Gardeners' Chronicle_ for September 25, of that  year, page 398, it is said that the boxwood forests of Mingrelia in the  Caucasian range were almost exhausted. Old forests, long abandoned, were  even then explored in search of trees that might have escaped the notice  of former proprietors, and wood that was rejected by them was, in 1875,  eagerly purchased at high prices for England. The export of wood was at  that time prohibited from Abhasia and all the government forests in  the Caucasus. A report, dated at about the same period from Trebizond,  points out that the Porte had prohibited the cutting of boxwood in the  crown forests. (_Gardeners' Chronicle_, Aug. 19, 1876, p. 239.) Later  on, the British Consul at Tiflis says: \"_Bona fide_ Caucasian boxwood  may be said to be commercially non-existent, almost every marketable  tree having been exported.\" (_Gardeners' Chronicle_, Dec. 6, 1879, p.  726.)    The characters of boxwood are so marked and so distinct from those of  most other woods that some extracts from a report of Messrs. J. Gardner  & Sons, of London and Liverpool, addressed to the Inspector-General of  Forests in India, bearing on this subject, will not be without value;  indeed, its more general circulation than its reprint in Mr. J.S.  Gamble's \"Manual of Indian Timbers\" will, it is hoped, be the means of  directing attention to this very important matter, and by pointing  out the characters that make boxwood so valuable, may be the means of  directing observation to the detection of similar characters in other  woods. Messrs. Gardner say:    \"The most suitable texture of wood will be found growing upon the sides  of mountains. If grown in the plains the growth is usually too quick,  and consequently the grain is too coarse, the wood of best texture being  of slow growth, and very fine in the grain.    \"It should be cut down in the winter, and, if possible, stored at once  in airy wooden sheds well protected from sun and rain, and not to have  too much air through the sides of the sheds, more especially for the  wood under four inches diameter.    \"The boxwood also must not be piled upon the ground, but be well skidded  under, so as to be kept quite free from the effects of any damp from the  soil.    \"After the trees are cut down, the longer they are exposed the more  danger is there afterward of the wood splitting more than is absolutely  necessary during the necessary seasoning before shipment to this  country.    \"If shipped green, there is great danger of the wood sweating and  becoming mildewed during transit, which causes the wood afterward to dry  light and of a defective color, and in fact rendering it of little value  for commercial purposes.    \"There is no occasion to strip the bark off or to put cowdung or  anything else upon the ends of the pieces to prevent their splitting.    \"Boxwood is the nearest approach to ivory of any wood known, and will,  therefore, probably gradually increase in value, as it, as well  as ivory, becomes scarcer. It is now used very considerably in  manufacturing concerns, but on account of its gradual advance in price  during the past few years, cheaper woods are in some instances being  substituted.    \"Small wood under four inches is used principally by flax spinners for  rollers, and by turners for various purposes, rollers for rink skates,  etc., etc., and if free from splits, is of equal value with the larger  wood. It is imported here as small as one a half inches in diameter, but  the most useful sizes are from 21/2 to 31/2 inches, and would therefore,  we suppose, be from fifteen to thirty or forty years in growing, while  larger wood would require fifty years and upward at least, perhaps we  ought to say one hundred years and upward. It is used principally for  shuttles, for weaving silk, linen, and cotton, and also for rule making  and wood engraving. _Punch, The Illustrated London News, The Graphic_,  and all the first class pictorial papers use large quantities of  boxwood.\"    In 1880, Messrs. Churchill and Sim reported favorably on some  consignments of Indian boxwood, concluding with the remarks that if the  wood could be regularly placed on the market at a moderate figure, there  was no reason why a trade should not be developed in it. Notwithstanding  these prospects, which seemed promising in 1877 and 1880, little or  nothing has been accually done up to the present time in bringing Indian  boxwood into general use, in consequence, as Mr. Gamble shows, of  the cost of transit through India. The necessity, therefore, of the  discovery of some wood akin to box is even more important now than ever  it was.      BOXWOOD SUBSTITUTES.    First among the substitutes that have been proposed to replace boxwood  may be mentioned an invention of Mr. Edward Badoureau, referred to in  the _Gardeners' Chronicle_, March 23, 1878, p. 374,"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/97"],[0,"Flatland: A Romance of Many Dimensions (#12)"],[1," of sight at all than to see so little!  I grant  you I have not your discriminative faculty of hearing; for the concert  of all Lineland which gives you such intense pleasure, is to me no  better than a multitudinous twittering or chirping.  But at least I can  discern, by sight, a Line from a Point.  And let me prove it.  Just  before I came into your kingdom, I saw you dancing from left to right,  and then from right to left, with Seven Men and a Woman in your  immediate proximity on the left, and eight Men and two Women on your  right.  Is not this correct?\"    \"It is correct,\" said the King, \"so far as the numbers and sexes are  concerned, though I know not what you mean by 'right' and 'left.' But I  deny that you saw these things.  For how could you see the Line, that  is to say the inside, of any Man?  But you must have heard these  things, and then dreamed that you saw them.  And let me ask what you  mean by those words 'left' and 'right.'  I suppose it is your way of  saying Northward and Southward.\"    \"Not so,\" replied I; \"besides your motion of Northward and Southward,  there is another motion which I call from right to left.\"    King.  Exhibit to me, if you please, this motion from left to right.    I.  Nay, that I cannot do, unless you could step out of your Line  altogether.    King.  Out of my Line?  Do you mean out of the world?  Out of Space?    I.  Well, yes.  Out of YOUR world.  Out of YOUR Space.  For your Space  is not the true Space.  True Space is a Plane; but your Space is only a  Line.    King.  If you cannot indicate this motion from left to right by  yourself moving in it, then I beg you to describe it to me in words.    I.  If you cannot tell your right side from your left, I fear that no  words of mine can make my meaning clearer to you.  But surely you  cannot be ignorant of so simple a distinction.    King.  I do not in the least understand you.    I.  Alas!  How shall I make it clear?  When you move straight on, does  it not sometimes occur to you that you COULD move in some other way,  turning your eye round so as to look in the direction towards which  your side is now fronting?  In other words, instead of always moving in  the direction of one of your extremities, do you never feel a desire to  move in the direction, so to speak, of your side?    King.  Never.  And what do you mean?  How can a man's inside \"front\" in  any direction?  Or how can a man move in the direction of his inside?    I.  Well then, since words cannot explain the matter, I will try deeds,  and will move gradually out of Lineland in the direction which I desire  to indicate to you.    At the word I began to move my body out of Lineland.  As long as any  part of me remained in his dominion and in his view, the King kept  exclaiming, \"I see you, I see you still; you are not moving.\" But when  I had at last moved myself out of his Line, he cried in his shrillest  voice, \"She is vanished; she is dead.\"  \"I am not dead,\" replied I; \"I  am simply out of Lineland, that is to say, out of the Straight Line  which you call Space, and in the true Space, where I can see things as  they are.  And at this moment I can see your Line, or side--or inside  as you are pleased to call it; and I can see also the Men and Women on  the North and South of you, whom I will now enumerate, describing their  order, their size, and the interval between each.\"    When I had done this at great length, I cried triumphantly, \"Does that  at last convince you?\"  And, with that, I once more entered Lineland,  taking up the same position as before.    But the Monarch replied, \"If you were a Man of sense--though, as you  appear to have only one voice I have little doubt you are not a Man but  a Woman--but, if you had a particle of sense, you would listen to  reason.  You ask me to believe that there is another Line besides that  which my senses indicate, and another motion besides that of which I am  daily conscious.  I, in return, ask you to describe in words or  indicate by motion that other Line of which you speak.  Instead of  moving, you merely exercise some magic art of vanishing and returning  to sight; and instead of any lucid description of your new World, you  simply tell me the numbers and sizes of some forty of my retinue, facts  known to any child in my capital.  Can anything be more irrational or  audacious?  Acknowledge your folly or depart from my dominions.\"    Furious at his perversity, and especially indignant that he professed  to be ignorant of my sex, I retorted in no measured terms, \"Besotted  Being!  You think yourself the perfection of existence, while you are  in reality the most imperfect and imbecile.  You profess to see,  whereas you see nothing but a Point!  You plume yourself on inferring  the existence of a Straight Line; but I CAN SEE Straight Lines, and  infer the existence of Angles, Triangles, Squares, Pentagons, Hexagons,  and even Circles.  Why waste more words?  Suffice it that I am the  completion of your incomplete self.  You are a Line, but I am a Line of  Lines called in my country a Square:  and even I, infinitely superior  though I am to you, am of little account among the great nobles of  Flatland, whence I have come to visit you, in the hope of enlightening  your ignorance.\"    Hearing these words the King advanced towards me with a menacing cry as  if to pierce me through the diagonal; and in that same movement there  arose from myriads of his subjects a multitudinous war-cry, increasing  in vehemence till at last methought it rivalled the roar of an army of  a hundred thousand Isosceles, and the artillery of a thousand  Pentagons.  Spell-bound and motionless, I could neither speak nor move  to avert the impending destruction; and still the noise grew louder,  and the King came closer, when I awoke to find the breakfast-bell  recalling me to the realities of Flatland.          SECTION 15  Concerning a Stranger from Spaceland      From dreams I proceed to facts.    It was the last day of our 1999th year of our era.  The patterning of  the rain had long ago announced nightfall; and I was sitting (footnote  3) in the company of my wife, musing on the events of the past and the  prospects of the coming year, the coming century, the coming Millennium.    My four Sons and two orphan Grandchildren had retired to their several  apartments; and my wife alone remained with me to see the old  Millennium out and the new one in.    I was rapt in thought, pondering in my mind some words that had  casually issued from the mouth of my youngest Grandson, a most  promising young Hexagon of unusual brilliancy and perfect angularity.  His uncles and I had been giving him his usual practical lesson in  Sight Recognition, turning ourselves upon our centres, now rapidly, now  more slowly, and questioning him as to our positions; and his answers  had been so satisfactory that I had been induced to reward him by  giving him a few hints on Arithmetic, as applied to Geometry.    Taking nine Squares, each an inch every way, I had put them together so  as to make one large Square, with a side of three inches, and I had  hence proved to my little Grandson that--though it was impossible for  us to SEE the inside of the Square--yet we might ascertain the number  of square inches in a Square by simply squaring the number of inches in  the side:  \"and thus,\" said I, \"we know that three-to-the-second, or  nine, represents the number of square inches in a Square whose side is  three inches long.\"    The little Hexagon meditated on this a while and then said to me; \"But  you have been teaching me to raise numbers to the third power: I  suppose three-to-the-third must mean something in Geometry; what does  it mean?\"  \"Nothing at all,\" replied I, \"not at least in Geometry; for  Geometry has only Two Dimensions.\"  And then I began to shew the boy  how a Point by moving through a length of three inches makes a Line of  three inches, which may be represented by three; and how a Line of  three inches, moving parallel to itself through a length of three  inches, makes a Square of three inches every way, which may be  represented by three-to-the-second.  xxx Upon this, my Grandson, again  returning to his former suggestion, took me up rather suddenly and  exclaimed, \"Well, then, if a Point by moving three inches, makes a Line  of three inches represented by three; and if a straight Line of three  inches, moving parallel to itself, makes a Square of three inches every  way, represented by three-to-the-second; it must be that a Square of  three inches every way, moving somehow parallel to itself (but I don't  see how) must make Something else (but I don't see what) of three  inches every way--and this must be represented by three-to-the-third.\"    \"Go to bed,\" said I, a little ruffled by this interruption: \"if you  would talk less nonsense, you would remember more sense.\"    So my Grandson had disappeared in disgrace; and there I sat by my  Wife's side, endeavouring to form a retrospect of the year 1999 and of  the possibilities of the year 2000; but not quite able to shake of the  thoughts suggested by the prattle of my bright little Hexagon.  Only a  few sands now remained in the half-hour glass.  Rousing myself from my  reverie I turned the glass Northward for the last time in the old  Millennium; and in the act, I exclaimed aloud, \"The boy is a fool.\"    Straightway I became conscious of a Presence in the room, and a  chilling breath thrilled through my very being.  \"He is no such thing,\"  cried my Wife, \"and you are breaking the Commandments in thus  dishonouring your own Grandson.\"  But I took no notice of her.  Looking  around in every direction I could see nothing; yet still I FELT a  Presence, and shivered as the cold whisper came again.  I started up.  \"What is the matter?\" said my Wife, \"there is no draught; what are you  looking for?  There is nothing.\"  There was nothing; and I resumed my  seat, again exclaiming, \"The boy is"]]]
