Any unforeseen blow, a fall, a touch, may be  fatally injurious to you; and I am terrified at the possibility of it.  For my sake do this: put away the picture, not out of your affections,  not out of your room; let it have the brightest, the holiest place which  you can give it; only do not wear upon your breast a thing, the presence  of which seems to me, perhaps from an extravagant anxiety, so  dangerous.\"    Ottilie said nothing, and while he was speaking she kept her eyes fixed  straight before her; then, without hesitation and without haste, with a  look turned more toward heaven than on Edward, she unclasped the chain,  drew out the picture, and pressed it against her forehead, and then  reached it over to her friend, with the words:    \"Do you keep it for me till we come home; I cannot give you a better  proof how deeply I thank you for your affectionate care.\"    He did not venture to press the picture to his lips; but he caught her  hand and raised it to his eyes. They were, perhaps, two of the most  beautiful hands which had ever been clasped together. He felt as if a  stone had fallen from his heart, as if a partition-wall had been thrown  down between him and Ottilie.    Under the miller's guidance, Charlotte and the Captain came down by an  easier path, and now joined them. There was the meeting, and a happy  talk, and then they took some refreshments. They would not return by the  same way as they came; and Edward struck into a rocky path on the other  side of the stream, from which the ponds were again to be seen. They  made their way along it, with some effort, and then had to cross a  variety of wood and copse--getting glimpses, on the land side, of a  number of villages and manor-houses, with their green lawns and  fruit-gardens; while very near them, and sweetly situated on a rising  ground, a farm lay in the middle of the wood. From a gentle ascent, they  had a view, before and behind, which showed them the richness of the  country to the greatest advantage; and then, entering a grove of trees,  they found themselves, on again emerging from it, on the rock opposite  the castle.    They came upon it rather unexpectedly, and were of course delighted.  They had made the circuit of a little world; they were standing on the  spot where the new building was to be erected, and were looking again at  the windows of their home.    They went down to the summer-house, and sat all four in it for the first  time together; nothing was more natural than that with one voice it  should be proposed to have the way they had been that day, and which, as  it was, had taken them much time and trouble, properly laid out and  gravelled, so that people might loiter along it at their leisure. They  each said what they thought; and they reckoned up that the circuit, over  which they had taken many hours, might be traveled easily with a good  road all the way round to the castle, in a single one.    Already a plan was being suggested for making the distance shorter, and  adding a fresh beauty to the landscape, by throwing a bridge across the  stream, below the mill, where it ran into the lake; when Charlotte  brought their inventive imagination somewhat to a standstill, by putting  them in mind of the expense which such an undertaking would involve.    \"There are ways of meeting that too,\" replied Edward; \"we have only to  dispose of that farm in the forest which is so pleasantly situated, and  which brings in so little in the way of rent: the sum which will be set  free will more than cover what we shall require, and thus, having gained  an invaluable walk, we shall receive the interest of well-expended  capital in substantial enjoyment--instead of, as now, in the summing up  at the end of the year, vexing and fretting ourselves over the pitiful  little income which is returned for it.\"    Even Charlotte, with all her prudence, had little to urge against this.  There had been, indeed, a previous intention of selling the farm. The  Captain was ready immediately with a plan for breaking up the ground  into small portions among the peasantry of the forest. Edward, however,  had a simpler and shorter way of managing it. His present steward had  already proposed to take it off his hands--he was to pay for it by  instalments--and so, gradually, as the money came in, they would get  their work forward from point to point.    So reasonable and prudent a scheme was sure of universal approbation,  and already, in prospect, they began to see their new walk winding along  its way, and to imagine the many beautiful views and charming spots  which they hoped to discover in its neighborhood.    To bring it all before themselves with greater fulness of detail, in the  evening they produced the new chart. With the help of this they went  over again the way that they had come, and found various places where  the walk might take a rather different direction with advantage. Their  other scheme was now once more talked through, and connected with the  fresh design. The site for the new house in the park, opposite the  castle, was a second time examined into and approved, and fixed upon for  the termination of the intended circuit.    Ottilie had said nothing all this time. At length Edward pushed the  chart, which had hitherto been lying before Charlotte, across to her,  begging her to give her opinion; she still hesitated for a moment.  Edward in his gentlest way again pressed her to let them know what she  thought--nothing had as yet been settled--it was all as yet in embryo.    \"I would have the house built here,\" she said, as she pointed with her  finger to the highest point of the slope on the hill. \"It is true you  cannot see the castle from thence, for it is hidden by the wood; but for  that very reason you find yourself in another quite new world; you lose  village and houses and all at the same time. The view of the ponds with  the mill, and the hills and mountains in the distance, is singularly  beautiful--I have often observed it when I have been there.\"    \"She is right,\" Edward cried; \"how could we have overlooked it. This is  what you mean, Ottilie, is it not?\" He took a lead pencil, and drew a  great black rectangular figure on the summit of the hill.    It went through the Captain's soul to see his carefully and  clearly-drawn chart disfigured in such a way. He collected himself,  however, after a slight expression of his disapproval and went into the  idea. \"Ottilie is right,\" he said; \"we are ready enough to walk any  distance to drink tea or eat fish, because they would not have tasted as  well at home--we require change of scene and change of objects. Your  ancestors showed their judgment in the spot which they chose for the  castle; for it is sheltered from the wind, with the conveniences of life  close at hand. A place, on the contrary, which is more for pleasure  parties than for a regular residence, may be very well yonder  there, and in the fair time of year the most agreeable hours may be  spent there.\"    [Illustration: CHARLOTTE, OTTILIE, EDWARD AND THE CAPTAIN DISCUSS THE  NEW PLAN OF THE HOUSE _From the Painting by Franz Simm_]    The more they talked it over, the more conclusive was their judgment in  favor of Ottilie; and Edward could not conceal his triumph that the  thought had been hers. He was as proud as if he had hit upon it himself.          CHAPTER VIII      Early the following morning the Captain examined the spot: he first  threw off a sketch of what should be done, and afterward, when the thing  had been more completely decided on, he made a complete design, with  accurate calculations and measurements. It cost him a good deal of  labor, and the business connected with the sale of the farm had to be  gone into, so that both the gentlemen now found a fresh impulse to  activity.    The Captain made Edward observe that it would be proper, indeed that it  would be a kind of duty, to celebrate Charlotte's birthday with laying  the foundation-stone. Not much was wanted to overcome Edward's  disinclination for such festivities--for he quickly recollected that a  little later Ottilie's birthday would follow, and that he could have a  magnificent celebration for that.    Charlotte, to whom all this work and what it would involve was a subject  for much serious and almost anxious thought, busied herself in carefully  going through the time and outlay which it was calculated would be  expended on it. During the day they rarely saw each other, so that the  evening meeting was looked forward to with all the more anxiety.    Ottilie meantime was complete mistress of the household--and how could  it be otherwise, with her quick methodical rays of working? Indeed, her  whole mode of thought was suited better to home life than to the world,  and to a more free existence. Edward soon observed that she only walked  about with them out of a desire to please; that when she stayed out late  with them in the evening it was because she thought it a sort of social  duty, and that she would often find a pretext in some household matter  for going in again--consequently he soon managed so to arrange the walks  which they took together, that they should be at home before sunset; and  he began again, what he had long left off, to read aloud  poetry--particularly such as had for its subject the expression of a  pure but passionate love.    They ordinarily sat in the evening in the same places round a small  table--Charlotte on the sofa, Ottilie on a chair opposite to her, and  the gentlemen on each side. Ottilie's place was on Edward's right, the  side where he put the candle when he was reading--at such times she  would draw her chair a little nearer to look over him, for Ottilie also  trusted her own eyes better"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/11367"],[0,"A History of China (#13)"],[1," against the tall crag, and enjoyed the prospect  of wild nature. His ideas floated on the breezes, and he looked as if  the wide spaces of the heavens and the countries of the earth were too  narrow for him; as if he was going to fly but had not yet left the  ground; as if he had already spread his wings but wanted to wait a  moment. Mr. Rationalist climbed up with the aid of vine shoots, reached  the top of the crag, and stepped up to him, saying very respectfully:    \"'I have heard that a man of nobility does not flee from society, but  seeks to gain fame; a man of wisdom does not swim against the current,  but seeks to earn repute. You, however, despise the achievements of  civilization and culture; you have no regard for the splendour of  philanthropy and justice; you squander your powers here in the  wilderness and neglect ordered relations between man....'\"    Frequently Master Mysticus and Mr. Rationalist were united in a single  person. Thus, Shih Ch'ung wrote in an essay on himself:    \"In my youth I had great ambition and wanted to stand out above the  multitude. Thus it happened that at a little over twenty years of age I  was already a court official; I remained in the service for twenty-five  years. When I was fifty I had to give up my post because of an  unfortunate occurrence.... The older I became, the more I appreciated  the freedom I had acquired; and as I loved forest and plain, I retired  to my villa. When I built this villa, a long embankment formed the  boundary behind it; in front the prospect extended over a clear canal;  all around grew countless cypresses, and flowing water meandered round  the house. There were pools there, and outlook towers; I bred birds and  fishes. In my harem there were always good musicians who played dance  tunes. When I went out I enjoyed nature or hunted birds and fished. When  I came home, I enjoyed playing the lute or reading; I also liked to  concoct an elixir of life and to take breathing exercises,[3] because I  did not want to die, but wanted one day to lift myself to the skies,  like an immortal genius. Suddenly I was drawn back into the official  career, and became once more one of the dignitaries of the Emperor.\"    [Footnote 3: Both Taoist practices.]    Thus Lao Tz[)u]'s individualist and anarchist doctrine was not suited to  form the basis of a general Chinese social order, and its employment in  support of dictatorship was certainly not in the spirit of Lao Tz[)u].  Throughout history, however, Taoism remained the philosophic attitude of  individuals of the highest circle of society; its real doctrine never  became popularly accepted; for the strong feeling for nature that  distinguishes the Chinese, and their reluctance to interfere in the  sanctified order of nature by technical and other deliberate acts, was  not actually a result of Lao Tz[)u]'s teaching, but one of the  fundamentals from which his ideas started.    If the date assigned to Lao Tz[)u] by present-day research (the fourth  instead of the sixth century B.C.) is correct, he was more or less  contemporary with Chuang Tz[)u], who was probably the most gifted poet  among the Chinese philosophers and Taoists. A thin thread extends from  them as far as the fourth century A.D.: Huai-nan Tz[)u], Chung-ch'ang  T'ung, Yuean Chi (210-263), Liu Ling (221-300), and T'ao Ch'ien  (365-427), are some of the most eminent names of Taoist philosophers.  After that the stream of original thought dried up, and we rarely find a  new idea among the late Taoists. These gentlemen living on their estates  had acquired a new means of expressing their inmost feelings: they wrote  poetry and, above all, painted. Their poems and paintings contain in a  different outward form what Lao Tz[)u] had tried to express with the  inadequate means of the language of his day. Thus Lao Tz[)u]'s teaching  has had the strongest influence to this day in this field, and has  inspired creative work which is among the finest achievements of  mankind.        Chapter Four      THE CONTENDING STATES (481-256 B.C.): DISSOLUTION OF THE FEUDAL SYSTEM      1 _Social and military changes_    The period following that of the Chou dictatorships is known as that of  the Contending States. Out of over a thousand states, fourteen remained,  of which, in the period that now followed, one after another  disappeared, until only one remained. This period is the fullest, or one  of the fullest, of strife in all Chinese history. The various feudal  states had lost all sense of allegiance to the ruler, and acted in  entire independence. It is a pure fiction to speak of a Chinese State in  this period; the emperor had no more power than the ruler of the Holy  Roman Empire in the late medieval period of Europe, and the so-called  \"feudal states\" of China can be directly compared with the developing  national states of Europe. A comparison of this period with late  medieval Europe is, indeed, of highest interest. If we adopt a political  system of periodization, we might say that around 500 B.C. the unified  feudal state of the first period of Antiquity came to an end and the  second, a period of the national states began, although formally, the  feudal system continued and the national states still retained many  feudal traits.    As none of these states was strong enough to control and subjugate the  rest, alliances were formed. The most favoured union was the north-south  axis; it struggled against an east-west league. The alliances were not  stable but broke up again and again through bribery or intrigue, which  produced new combinations. We must confine ourselves to mentioning the  most important of the events that took place behind this military  facade.    Through the continual struggles more and more feudal lords lost their  lands; and not only they, but the families of the nobles dependent on  them, who had received so-called sub-fiefs. Some of the landless nobles  perished; some offered their services to the remaining feudal lords as  soldiers or advisers. Thus in this period we meet with a large number of  migratory politicians who became competitors of the wandering scholars.  Both these groups recommended to their lord ways and means of gaining  victory over the other feudal lords, so as to become sole ruler. In  order to carry out their plans the advisers claimed the rank of a  Minister or Chancellor.    Realistic though these advisers and their lords were in their thinking,  they did not dare to trample openly on the old tradition. The emperor  might in practice be a completely powerless figurehead, but he belonged  nevertheless, according to tradition, to a family of divine origin,  which had obtained its office not merely by the exercise of force but  through a \"divine mandate\". Accordingly, if one of the feudal lords  thought of putting forward a claim to the imperial throne, he felt  compelled to demonstrate that his family was just as much of divine  origin as the emperor's, and perhaps of remoter origin. In this matter  the travelling \"scholars\" rendered valuable service as manufacturers of  genealogical trees. Each of the old noble families already had its  family tree, as an indispensable requisite for the sacrifices to  ancestors. But in some cases this tree began as a branch of that of the  imperial family: this was the case of the feudal lords who were of  imperial descent and whose ancestors had been granted fiefs after the  conquest of the country. Others, however, had for their first ancestor a  local deity long worshipped in the family's home country, such as the  ancient agrarian god Huang Ti, or the bovine god Shen Nung. Here the  \"scholars\" stepped in, turning the local deities into human beings and  \"emperors\". This suddenly gave the noble family concerned an imperial  origin. Finally, order was brought into this collection of ancient  emperors. They were arranged and connected with each other in  \"dynasties\" or in some other \"historical\" form. Thus at a stroke Huang  Ti, who about 450 B.C. had been a local god in the region of southern  Shansi, became the forefather of almost all the noble families,  including that of the imperial house of the Chou. Needless to say, there  would be discrepancies between the family trees constructed by the  various scholars for their lords, and later, when this problem had lost  its political importance, the commentators laboured for centuries on the  elaboration of an impeccable system of \"ancient emperors\"--and to this  day there are sinologists who continue to present these humanized gods  as historical personalities.    In the earlier wars fought between the nobles they were themselves the  actual combatants, accompanied only by their retinue. As the struggles  for power grew in severity, each noble hired such mercenaries as he  could, for instance the landless nobles just mentioned. Very soon it  became the custom to arm peasants and send them to the wars. This  substantially increased the armies. The numbers of soldiers who were  killed in particular battles may have been greatly exaggerated (in a  single battle in 260 B.C., for instance, the number who lost their lives  was put at 450,000, a quite impossible figure); but there must have been  armies of several thousand men, perhaps as many as 10,000. The  population had grown considerably by that time.    The armies of the earlier period consisted mainly of the nobles in their  war chariots; each chariot surrounded by the retinue of the nobleman.  Now came large troops of commoners as infantry as well, drawn from the  peasant population. To these, cavalry were first added in the fifth  century B.C., by the northern state of Chao (in the present Shansi),  following the example of its Turkish and Mongol neighbours. The general  theory among ethnologists is that the horse was first harnessed to a  chariot, and that riding came much later; but it is my opinion that  riders were known earlier, but could not be efficiently"]]]
