If commenced in youth, thick lips may be reduced by compression, and  thin linear ones are easily modified by suction. This draws the blood  to the surfaces, and produces at first a temporary and, later, a  permanent inflation. It is a mistaken belief that biting the lips  reddens them. The skin of the lips is very thin, rendering them  extremely susceptible to organic derangement, and if the atmosphere  does not cause chaps or parchment, the result of such harsh treatment  will develop into swelling or the formation of scars. Above all  things, keep a sweet breath.    Everybody can not have beautiful hands, but there is no plausible  reason for their being ill kept. Red hands may be overcome by soaking  the feet in hot water as often as possible. If the skin is hard and  dry, use tar or oat-meal soap, saturate them with glycerine, and wear  gloves in bed. Never bathe them in hot water, and wash no oftener than  is necessary. There are dozens of women with soft, white hands who do  not put them in water once a month. Rubber gloves are worn in making  the toilet, and they are cared for by an ointment of glycerine and  rubbed dry with chamois-skin or cotton flannel. The same treatment is  not unfrequently applied to the face with the most successful results.  If such methods are used, it would be just as well to keep the  knowledge of it from the gentlemen. We know of one beautiful lady who  has not washed her face for three years, yet it is always clean, rosy,  sweet and kissable. With some of her other secrets she gave it to her  lover for safe keeping. Unfortunately, it proved to be her last gift  to that gentleman, who declared in a subsequent note that \"I can not  reconcile my heart and my manhood to a woman who can get along without  washing her face.\"      SOME OF THE SECRETS OF BEAUTY.    There is as much a \"fashion\" in complexion as there is in bonnets  or boots. Sometimes nature is the mode, sometimes art. Just now the  latter is in the ascendant, though, as a rule, only in that inferior  phase which has not reached the \"concealment of art\"--the point  where extremes meet and the perfection of artifice presents all the  appearance of artlessness. No one of an observant turn of mind, who  is accustomed to the sight of English maids and matrons, can deny  that making-up, as at present practiced, partakes of the amateurish  element. Impossible reds and whites grow still more impossibly red  and white from week to week under the unskilled hands of the wearer of  \"false colors,\" who does not like to ask for advice on so delicate a  subject, for, even were she willing to confess to the practice, the  imputation of experience conveyed in the asking for counsel might be  badly received, and would scarcely be in good taste.    The prevalent and increasing short-sightedness of our times is,  perhaps, partly the cause of the excessive use of rouge and powder.  The wielder of the powder puff sees herself afar off, as it were. She  knows that she cannot judge of the effect of her complexion with her  face almost touching its reflection in the glass, and, standing about  a yard off, she naturally accentuates her roses and lilies in a way  that looks very pleasing to her, but is rather startling to any one  with longer sight. Nor can she tone down her rouge with the powdered  hair that softened the artificial coloring of her grandmother when she  had her day. Powder is only occasionally worn with evening dress,  and it is by daylight that those dreadful bluish reds and whites look  their worst.    On the other hand, there are some women so clever at making up their  faces that one feels almost inclined to condone the practice in  admiration of the result. These are the small minority, and are likely  to remain so, for their secret is of a kind unlikely to be shared. The  closest inspection of these cleverly managed complexions reveals no  trace of art.    Notwithstanding the reticence of these skilled artists, an occasional  burst of confidence has revealed a few of their means of accomplishing  the great end of looking pretty. \"Do you often do that?\" said one of  those clever ones, a matron of 37, who looked like a girl of 19, to a  friend who was vigorously rubbing her cheeks with a course towel after  a plentiful application of cold water.    \"Yes, every time I come in from a walk, ride or drive. Why?\"    \"Well, no wonder you look older than you are. You are simply wearing  your face out!\"    \"But I must wash?\"    \"Certainly, but not like that. Take a leaf out of my book; never  wash you face just before going out into the fresh air, or just after  coming in. Nothing is more injurious to the skin. Come to the glass.  Do you notice a drawn look about your eyes and a general streakiness  in the cheeks? That is the result of your violent assault upon your  complexion just now. You look at this moment ten years older than you  did twenty minutes ago in the park.\"    \"Well, I really do. I look old enough to be your mother; but then, you  are wonderful. You always look so young and fresh!\"    \"Because I never treat my poor face so badly as you do yours. I use  rain-water, and if I cannot get that, I have the water filtered. When  I dress for dinner I always wash my face with milk, adding just enough  hot water to make it pleasant to use. A very soft sponge and very fine  towel take the place of your terrible huckaback arrangement.\"    Two or three years ago a lady of Oriental parentage on her father's  side spent a season in London society. Her complexion was brown,  relieved by yellow, her features large and irregular, but redeemed  by a pair of lovely and expressive eyes. So perfect was her taste in  dress that she always attracted admiration wherever she went. Dressed  in rich dark brown or dullest crimsons or russets, so that no one  ever noticed much what she wore, she so managed that suggestions  and hints--no more--of brilliant amber or [Transcriber's Note: The  original text reads 'promegranate'] pomegranate scarlet should appear  just where they imparted brilliancy to her deep coloring, and abstract  the yellow from her skin. A knot of old gold satin under the rim of  her bonnet, another at her throat, and others in among the lace at her  wrists, brightened up the otherwise subdued tinting of her costume, so  that it always looked as though it had been designed expressly for her  by some great colorist. Here rouge was unnecessary. The surroundings  were arranged to suit the complexion, instead of the complexion to  suit the surroundings. There can be no doubt as to which is the method  which best becomes the gentlewoman.    In addition to the disagreeable sensation of making-up, it must  be remembered that the use of some of the white powders eventually  destroys the texture of the skin, rendering it rough and coarse.  Rimmel, the celebrated perfumer, in his \"Book of Perfumes,\" says that  rouge, being composed of cochineal and saffron, is harmless, but that  white cosmetics consist occasionally of deleterious substances which  may injure the health. He advises actors and actresses to choose  cosmetics, especially the white, with the greatest care, and women of  the world, who wish to preserve the freshness of their complexion, to  observe the following recipe: Open air, rest, exercise and cold water.    In another part of this pleasant book the author says that _schonada_,  a cosmetic used among the Arabs, is quite innocuous and at the same  time effectual. \"This cream, which consists of sublimated benzoin,  acts upon the skin as a slight stimulant, and imparts perfectly  natural colors during some hours without occasioning the  inconveniences with which European cosmetics may justly be  reproached.\" It is a well-known fact that bismuth, a white powder  containing sugar of lead, injures the nerve-centers when constantly  employed, and occasionally causes paralysis itself.    In getting up the eyes, nothing is injurious that is not dropped into  them. Tho use of _kohl_ or _kohol_ is quite harmless, and, it must be  confessed, very effective when applied--as the famous recipe for salad  dressing enjoins with regard to the vinegar--by the hand of a miser.  Modern Egyptian ladies make their _kohol_ of the smoke produced by  burning almonds. A small bag holding the bottle of _kohol_, and a pin,  with a rounded point with which to apply it, form part of the toilet  paraphernalia of all the beauties of Cairo, who make the immense  mistake of getting up their eyes in an exactly similar manner, thus  trying to reduce the endless variety of nature to one common pattern,  a mistake that may be accounted for by the fact that the Arabs believe  _kohol_ to be a sovereign specific against ophthalmia. Their English  sisters often make the same mistake without the same excuse. A hairpin  steeped in lampblack is the usual method of darkening the eyes in  England, retribution following sooner or later in the shape of a total  loss of the eyelashes. Eau de Cologne is occasionally dropped into  the eyes, with the effect of making them brighter. The operation is  painful, and it is said that half a dozen drops of whisky and the  same quantity of Eau de Cologne, eaten on a lump of sugar, is quite as  effective.      HIGH-HEELED BOOTS.    A lady looks infinitely taller and slimmer in a long dress than she  does in a short costume, and there is always a way of showing the  feet, if desired, by making the front quite short, which gives,  indeed, a more youthful appearance to a train dress. The greatest  attention must, of course, be paid to the feet with these short  dresses, and I may here at once state that high heels are absolutely  forbidden by fashion. Doctors, are you content? Only on cheap shoes  and boots are they now made, and are only worn by common people. A  good bootmaker will not make high heels now, even if paid double price  to do so.

I will only say that I believe my brother applied  himself diligently to his studies, and took his amusement mostly on  horseback, riding two horses which he had had sent to him from Worth  Maltravers.    About the second week after his return he received a letter from Mr.  George Smart to the effect that the Stradivarius violin was now in  complete order. Subsequent examination, Mr. Smart wrote, and the  unanimous verdict of connoisseurs whom he had consulted, had merely  confirmed the views he had at first expressed--namely, that the violin  was of the finest quality, and that my brother had in his possession a  unique and intact example of Stradivarius's best period. He had had it  properly strung; and as the bass-bar had never been moved, and was of  a stronger nature than that usual at the period of its manufacture, he  had considered it unnecessary to replace it. If any signs should become  visible of its being inadequate to support the tension of modern  stringing, another could be easily substituted for it at a later date.  He had allowed a young German _virtuoso_ to play on it, and though this  gentleman was one of the first living performers, and had had an  opportunity of handling many splendid instruments, he assured Mr. Smart  that he had never performed on one that could in any way compare with  this. My brother wrote in reply thanking him, and begging that the  violin might be sent to Magdalen Hall.    The pleasant musical evenings, however, which John had formerly  been used to spend in the company of Mr. Gaskell were now entirely  pretermitted. For though there was no cause for any diminution of  friendship between them, and though on Mr. Gaskell's part there was an  ardent desire to maintain their former intimacy, yet the two young men  saw less and less of one another, until their intercourse was confined  to an accidental greeting in the street. I believe that during all this  time my brother played very frequently on the Stradivarius violin,  but always alone. Its very possession seemed to have engendered from  the first in his mind a secretive tendency which, as I have already  observed, was entirely alien to his real disposition. As he had  concealed its discovery from his sister, so he had also from his friend,  and Mr. Gaskell remained in complete ignorance of the existence of such  an instrument.    On the evening of its arrival from London, John seems to have carefully  unpacked the violin and tried it with a new bow of Tourte's make which  he had purchased of Mr. Smart. He had shut the heavy outside door of his  room before beginning to play, so that no one might enter unawares; and  he told me afterwards that though he had naturally expected from the  instrument a very fine tone, yet its actual merits so far exceeded his  anticipations as entirely to overwhelm him. The sound issued from it  in a volume of such depth and purity as to give an impression of the  passages being chorded, or even of another violin being played at the  same time. He had had, of course, no opportunity of practising during  his illness, and so expected to find his skill with the bow somewhat  diminished; but he perceived, on the contrary, that his performance was  greatly improved, and that he was playing with a mastery and feeling  of which he had never before been conscious. While attributing this  improvement very largely to the beauty of the instrument on which he was  performing, yet he could not but believe that by his illness, or in some  other unexplained way, he had actually acquired a greater freedom of  wrist and fluency of expression, with which reflection he was not a  little elated. He had had a lock fixed on the cupboard in which he had  originally found the violin, and here he carefully deposited it on each  occasion after playing, before he opened the outer door of his room.    So the summer term passed away. The examinations had come in their due  time, and were now over. Both the young men had submitted themselves  to the ordeal, and while neither would of course have admitted as  much to anyone else, both felt secretly that they had no reason to be  dissatisfied with their performance. The results would not be published  for some weeks to come. The last night of the term had arrived, the last  night too of John's Oxford career. It was near nine o'clock, but still  quite light, and the rich orange glow of sunset had not yet left the  sky. The air was warm and sultry, as on that eventful evening when just  a year ago he had for the first time seen the figure or the illusion  of the figure of Adrian Temple. Since that time he had played the  \"Areopagita\" many, many times; but there had never been any reappearance  of that form, nor even had the once familiar creaking of the wicker  chair ever made itself heard. As he sat alone in his room, thinking with  a natural melancholy that he had seen the sun set for the last time on  his student life, and reflecting on the possibilities of the future  and perhaps on opportunities wasted in the past, the memory of that  evening last June recurred strongly to his imagination, and he felt an  irresistible impulse to play once more the \"Areopagita.\" He unlocked  the now familiar cupboard and took out the violin, and never had the  exquisite gradations of colour in its varnish appeared to greater  advantage than in the soft mellow light of the fading day. As he began  the _Gagliarda_ he looked at the wicker chair, half expecting to see a  form he well knew seated in it; but nothing of the kind ensued, and he  concluded the \"Areopagita\" without the occurrence of any unusual  phenomenon.    It was just at its close that he heard some one knocking at the outer  door. He hurriedly locked away the violin and opened the \"oak.\" It was  Mr. Gaskell. He came in rather awkwardly, as though not sure whether he  would be welcomed.    \"Johnnie,\" he began, and stopped.    The force of ancient habit sometimes, dear nephew, leads us unwittingly  to accost those who were once our friends by a familiar or nick-name  long after the intimacy that formerly justified it has vanished. But  sometimes we intentionally revert to the use of such a name, not wishing  to proclaim openly, as it were, by a more formal address that we are no  longer the friends we once were. I think this latter was the case with  Mr. Gaskell as he repeated the familiar name.    \"Johnnie, I was passing down New College Lane, and heard the violin from  your open windows. You were playing the 'Areopagita,' and it all sounded  so familiar to me that I thought I must come up. I am not interrupting  you, am I?\"    \"No, not at all,\" John answered.    \"It is the last night of our undergraduate life, the last night we shall  meet in Oxford as students. To-morrow we make our bow to youth and  become men. We have not seen much of each other this term at any rate,  and I daresay that is my fault. But at least let us part as friends.  Surely our friends are not so many that we can afford to fling them  lightly away.\"    He held out his hand frankly, and his voice trembled a little as he  spoke--partly perhaps from real emotion, but more probably from the  feeling of reluctance which I have noticed men always exhibit to  discovering any sentiment deeper than those usually deemed conventional  in correct society. My brother was moved by his obvious wish to renew  their former friendship, and grasped the proffered hand.    There was a minute's pause, and then the conversation was resumed, a  little stiffly at first, but more freely afterwards. They spoke on many  indifferent subjects, and Mr. Gaskell congratulated John on the prospect  of his marriage, of which he had heard. As he at length rose up to take  his departure, he said, \"You must have practised the violin diligently  of late, for I never knew anyone make so rapid progress with it as you  have done. As I came along I was spellbound by your music. I never  before heard you bring from the instrument so exquisite a tone: the  chorded passages were so powerful that I believed there had been  another person playing with you. Your Pressenda is certainly a finer  instrument than I ever imagined.\"    My brother was pleased with Mr. Gaskell's compliment, and the latter  continued, \"Let me enjoy the pleasure of playing with you once more in  Oxford; let us play the 'Areopagita.'\"    And so saying he opened the pianoforte and sat down.    John was turning to take out the Stradivarius when he remembered that he  had never even revealed its existence to Mr. Gaskell, and that if he now  produced it an explanation must follow. In a moment his mood changed,  and with less geniality he excused himself, somewhat awkwardly, from  complying with the request, saying that he was fatigued.    Mr. Gaskell was evidently hurt at his friend's altered manner, and  without renewing his petition rose at once from the pianoforte, and  after a little forced conversation took his departure. On leaving he  shook my brother by the hand, wished him all prosperity in his marriage  and after-life, and said, \"Do not entirely forget your old comrade, and  remember that if at any time you should stand in need of a true friend,  you know where to find him!\"    John heard his footsteps echoing down the passage and made a  half-involuntary motion towards the door as if to call him back, but did  not do so, though he thought over his last words then and on a  subsequent occasion.          CHAPTER X      The summer was spent by us in the company of Mrs. Temple and Constance,  partly at Royston and partly at Worth Maltravers. John had again  hired the cutter-yacht _Palestine_, and the whole party made several  expeditions in her. Constance was entirely devoted to her lover; her  life seemed wrapped up in his; she appeared to have no existence except  in his presence.    I can scarcely enumerate the reasons which prompted such thoughts, but  during these months I"]]]
