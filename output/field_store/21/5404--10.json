Wait until it is properly heated before putting in the articles to be  fried.    Fry a few articles at a time. Too many will cool the fat or oil below  the point of proper frying and they will absorb grease and be  unpalatable.    Put articles to be fried in the wire frying-basket and lower into the  boiling hot fat or oil. Test the fat by lowering a piece of stale bread  into it, if the bread browns in thirty seconds the fat is sufficiently  hot.    Fry croquettes a light brown; drain over the fat, lift the frying-basket  from the hot fat to a round plate, remove the articles from the basket  quickly to brown paper, drain a moment and serve.    When frying fish or any food that is to be used at a milk meal, use oil.  Olive oil is the best, but is very expensive for general use. Any other  good vegetable oil or nut oil will do as substitute.    When the food is intended for a meat meal; fat may be prepared according  to the following directions and used in the same manner as oil.      TO RENDER GOOSE, DUCK OR BEEF FAT    Cut the fat into small pieces. Put in a deep, iron kettle and cover with  cold water. Place on the stove uncovered; when the water has nearly all  evaporated, set the kettle back and let the fat try out slowly. When the  fat is still and scraps are shriveled and crisp at the bottom of the  kettle, strain the fat through a cloth into a stone crock, cover and set  it away in a cool place. The water may be omitted and the scraps slowly  tried out on back of stove or in moderate oven. When fat is tried out,  pour in crock.    Several slices of raw potato put with the fat will aid in the  clarifying.    All kinds of fats are good for drippings except mutton fat, turkey fat  and fat from smoked meats which has too strong a flavor to be used for  frying, but save it with other fat that may be unsuitable for frying,  and when six pounds are collected make it into hard soap.      TO MAKE WHITE HARD SOAP    Save every scrap of fat each day; try out all that has accumulated;  however small the quantity. This is done by placing the scraps in a  frying-pan on the back of the range. If the heat is low, and the grease  is not allowed to get hot enough to smoke or burn, there will be no odor  from it. Turn the melted grease into tin pails and keep them covered.  When six pounds of fat have been obtained, turn it into a dish-pan; add  a generous amount of hot water, and stand it on the range until the  grease is entirely melted. Stir it well together; then stand it aside to  cool. This is clarifying the grease. The clean grease will rise to the  top, and when it has cooled can be taken off in a cake, and such  impurities as have not settled in the water can be scraped off the  bottom of the cake of fat.    Put the clean grease into the dish-pan and melt it. Put a can of  Babbitt's lye in a tin pail; add to it a quart of cold water, and stir  it with a stick or wooden spoon until it is dissolved. It will get hot  when the water is added; let it stand until it cools. Remove the melted  grease from the fire, and pour in the lye slowly, stirring all the time.  Add two tablespoons of ammonia. Stir the mixture constantly for twenty  minutes or half an hour, or until the soap begins to set.    Let it stand until perfectly hard; then cut it into square cakes. This  makes a very good, white hard soap which will float on water.          *ENTREES*      CROQUETTES    Combine ingredients as directed in the recipe, roll the mixture lightly  between the hands into a ball. Have a plentiful supply of bread crumbs  spread evenly on a board; roll the ball lightly on the crumbs into the  shape of a cylinder, and flatten each end by dropping it lightly on the  board; put it in the egg (to each egg add one tablespoon of water, and  beat together), and with a spoon moisten the croquette completely with  the egg; lift it out on a knife-blade, and again roll lightly in the  crumbs. Have every part entirely covered, so there will be no opening  through which the grease may be absorbed. Where a light yellow color is  wanted, use fresh white crumbs grated from the loaf (or rubbed through a  puree sieve) for the outside, and do not use the yolk of the egg. Coarse  fresh crumbs are used for fish croquettes, which are usually made in the  form of chops, or half heart shape. A small hole is pricked in the  pointed end after frying, and a sprig of parsley inserted. Have all the  croquettes of perfectly uniform size and shape, and lay them aside on a  dish, not touching one another, for an hour or more before frying. This  will make the crust more firm.    The white of an egg alone may be used for egging them, but not the yolk  alone. Whip the egg with the water, just enough to break it, as  air-bubbles in the egg will break in frying, and let the grease  penetrate. Serve the croquettes on a platter, spread them on a napkin  and garnish with sprigs of parsley.      CHICKEN CROQUETTES, No. 1    Cook one-half tablespoon of flour in one tablespoon chicken-fat, add  one-half cup of soup stock gradually, and one-half teaspoon each of  onion juice, lemon juice, salt, and one-quarter teaspoon of pepper, one  and one-half cups of veal or chicken, chopped very fine, one pair of  brains which have been boiled, mix these well, remove from the fire and  add one well-beaten egg. Turn this mixture out on a flat dish and place  in ice-box to cool. Then roll into small cones, dip in beaten egg, roll  again in powdered bread or cracker crumbs and drop them into boiling  fat, fry until a delicate brown.      CHICKEN CROQUETTES, No. 2    Chop the chicken very fine, using the white meat alone, or the dark meat  alone, or both together. Season with salt, pepper, onion-juice, and  lemon-juice. Chopped mushrooms, sweetbreads, calf's brains, tongue, or  truffles are used with chicken, and a combination of two or more of them  much improves the quality of the croquettes.      CROQUETTES OF CALF'S BRAINS    Lay the brains in salt water an hour, or until they look perfectly  white, then take out one at a time, pat with your hands to loosen the  outer skin and pull it off. Beat or rub them to a smooth paste with a  wooden spoon, season with salt and pepper and a very little mace; add a  beaten egg and about one-half cup of bread crumbs. Heat fat in a spider  and fry large spoonfuls of this mixture in it.      MEAT CROQUETTES    Veal, mutton, lamb, beef and turkey croquettes may be prepared in the  same way as chicken croquettes.      MEAT AND BOILED HOMINY CROQUETTES    Equal proportions.      SWEETBREAD CROQUETTES    Cut the boiled sweetbreads into small dice with a silver knife. Mix with  mushrooms, using half the quantity of mushrooms that you have of  sweetbreads. Use two eggs in the sauce.      VEAL CROQUETTES    Veal is often mixed with chicken, or is used alone as a substitute for  chicken. Season in same manner and make the same combinations.      CAULIFLOWER CROQUETTES    Finely chop cold cooked cauliflower, mix in one small, finely chopped  onion, one small bunch of parsley finely chopped, one-half cup of bread  crumbs and one well-beaten egg. Carefully mix and mold into croquette  forms, dip in cracker dust and fry in deep, smoking fat until a light  brown.      EGGPLANT CROQUETTES (ROUMANIAN)    Peel the eggplant, place in hot water and boil until tender, drain, add  two eggs, salt, pepper, two tablespoons of matzoth or white flour or  bread crumbs, beat together; fry in butter or oil by tablespoonfuls.      CROQUETTES OF FISH    Take any kind of boiled fish, separate it from the bones carefully, chop  with a little parsley, salt and pepper to taste. Beat up one egg with  one teaspoon of milk and flour. Roll the fish into balls and turn them  in the beaten egg and cracker crumbs or bread. Fry a light brown. Serve  with any sauce or a mayonnaise.      POTATO CROQUETTES    Work into two cups of mashed potatoes, a tablespoon of melted butter,  until smooth and soft; add one egg well-beaten and beat all together  with a wooden spoon. Season with salt and nutmeg. Roll each in beaten  egg then in bread crumbs, fry in hot oil or butter substitute. If  desired chicken-fat may be substituted for the butter and the croquettes  fried in deep fat or oil.      SWEET POTATO CROQUETTES    Press through a ricer sufficient hot baked sweet potatoes to measure one  pint. Place over the fire. Add one teaspoon of butter or drippings, the  beaten yolks of two eggs, pepper and salt to taste, and beat well with a  fork until the mixture leaves the sides of the pan. Cool slightly, form  into cones, roll in fine bread crumbs; dip in beaten eggs, roll again in  crumbs and fry in hot oil or fat.      PEANUT AND RICE CROQUETTES    To one cup of freshly cooked rice allow one cup of peanut butter, four  tablespoons of minced celery, one teaspoon of grated onion, one  tablespoon of canned tomatoes, and salt and pepper to taste. Mix well;  add the white of one egg, reserving the yolk for coating the croquettes.  Shape into croquettes and let stand in a cold place for an hour, then  coat with the egg yolk mixed with one tablespoon of water and roll in  stale bread crumb dust until well covered. Fry in any hot oil or butter  substitute.      RICE CROQUETTES, No. 1    Separate the white and yolk of one egg and reserve about half the yolk  for coating the croquette. Beat the rest with the white. Mix with two  cups of boiled or steamed rice and one-half teaspoon of salt, form into  oblong croquettes or small balls. Mix the reserved part of the egg yolk  with a tablespoon of cold water. Dip croquettes in this and then roll in  fine bread crumbs. Repeat until well-coated, then fry brown in deep  oil.      RICE CROQUETTES, No. 2    Put on with cold water one cup of rice, and let boil until tender.  Drain, and mix with the rice, one tablespoon of butter, yolks of three  eggs, and pinch of salt. About one tablespoon of flour may be added to  hold the croquettes together. Beat the"]]]
