They stood chattering about the fallen man, straightening him out,  feeling his pulse, making sure that he, who would soon hang at the  will of the law, was alive. Outside, voices were rushing toward them,  doors slamming.    Bull Hunter broke through the circle, bent over the limp body, and  drew a big bundle of keys from a pocket. Then, without a word, he went  back to the far end of the room, buckled on his gun belt, and in  silence left the room.    The others paid no heed. They and the newcomers who had poured into  the room were fascinated by the work of the giant rather than the  giant's self. They had a lantern, swinging dull light and grotesque  shadows across the place now, and by the illumination, two of the men  went to the wall and picked up the great oaken chair. They raised it  slowly between them, a battered mass of disconnected wood. Then they  looked to the far end of the long table where he who had thrown the  missile had stood. Another line had been written into the history of  Bull Hunter--the first line that was written in red.    Bull himself was on his way to the jail. He found it unguarded. The  deputy had gone to find the cause of the commotion at the hotel. The  steel bars, moreover, were sufficient to retain the prisoner and keep  out would-be rescuers.    In the dim light of his lantern, Bull saw that Pete Reeve was sitting  cross-legged on his bunk, like a little, dried-up idol, smoking a  cigarette. His only greeting to the big man was a lifting of the  eyebrows. But, when the big key was fitted into the lock and the lock  turned, he showed his first signs of interest. He was standing up when  Bull opened the door and strode in.    \"Have you got your things?\" said Bull curtly.    \"What things, big fellow?\"    \"Why, guns and things--and your hat, of course.\"    Pete Reeve walked to the corner of the cell and took a sombrero off  the wall. \"Here's that hat,\" he answered, \"but they ain't passing out  guns to jailbirds--not in these parts!\"    \"You ain't a jailbird,\" answered Bull, \"so we'll get that gun. Know  where it is?\"    Reeve followed without a question through the open door, only stopping  as he passed beyond the bars, to look back to them with a shudder. It  was the first sign of emotion he had shown since his arrest. But his  step was lighter and quicker as he followed Bull into the front room.    \"In that closet, yonder,\" said Reeve, pointing to a door. \"That's  where they keep the guns.\"    Bull shook out his bundle of keys into the great palm of his hand.    \"Not those keys--the deputy has the key to the closet,\" said Pete. \"I  saw Anderson give it to him.\"    Bull sighed. \"I ain't got much time, partner,\" he said. Approaching  the door, he examined it wistfully. \"But, maybe, they's another way.\"  He drew back a little, raised his right leg, and smashed the heavy  cowhide boot against the door. The wood split from top to bottom, and  Bull's leg was driven on through the aperture. He paused to wrench the  fragments of the door from lock and hinges and then beckoned to Pete  Reeve. \"Look for your gun in here, Reeve.\"    The little man cast one twinkling glance at his companion and then was  instantly among the litter of the closet floor. He emerged strapping a  belt about him, the holster tugging far down, so that the muzzle of  the gun was almost at his knee. Bull appreciated the diminutive size  of the man for the first time, seeing him in conjunction with the big  gun on his thigh.    There was an odd change in the little man also, the moment his gun was  in place. He tugged his broad-brimmed hat a little lower across his  eyes and poised himself, as if on tiptoe; his glance was a constant  flicker about the room until it came to rest on Bull. \"Suppose you  lemme in on the meaning of all this. Who are you and where do you  figure on letting me loose? What in thunder is it all about?\"    \"We'll talk later. Now you got to get started.\"    Bull waved to the door. Pete Reeve darted past him with noiseless  steps and paused a moment at the threshold of the jail. Plainly he was  ready for fight or flight, and his right hand was toying constantly  with the holstered butt of his gun. Bull followed to the outside.    \"Hosses?\" asked the little man curtly.    \"On foot,\" answered Bull with equal brevity, and he led the way  straight across the street. There was no danger of being seen. All the  life of the town was drawn to a center about the hotel. Lights were  flashing behind its windows, men were constantly pounding across the  veranda, running in and out. Bull led the way past the building and  cut for the cottonwoods.    \"And now?\" demanded Pete Reeve. \"Now, partner?\"    That word stung Bull. It had not been applied to him more than a half  a dozen times in his life, together with its implications of free and  equal brotherhood. To be called partner by the great man who had  conquered terrible Uncle Bill Campbell!    \"They's a mess in the hotel,\" said Bull, explaining as shortly as he  could. \"Seems that Sheriff Anderson was the gent that done the killing  of Armstrong. It got found out and the sheriff tried to get away. Lots  of noise and trouble.\"    \"Ah,\" said Reeve, \"it was him, then--the old hound! I might have  knowed! But I kep' on figuring that they was two of 'em! Well, the  sheriff was a handy boy with his gun. Did he drop anybody before they  got him? I heard two guns go off like one. Them must of been the  sheriff's cannons.\"    \"They was,\" said Bull, \"but them bullets didn't hit nothing but wood.\"    \"Wild, eh? Shot into the wall?\"    \"Nope. Into a chair.\"    The little man was struggling and panting sometimes breaking into a  trot to keep up with the immense strides of his companion. \"A chair?  You don't say so!\"    Bull was silent.    \"How come he shot at a chair? Drunk?\"    \"The chair was sailing through the air at him.\"    \"H'm!\" returned Pete Reeve. \"Somebody throwed a chair at him, and the  sheriff got rattled and shot at it instead of dodging? Well, I've seen  a pile of funnier things than that happen in gun play, off and on. Who  threw the chair?\"    \"I did.\"    \"You?\" He squinted up at the lofty form of Bull Hunter. \"What name did  you say?\" he asked gently.    \"Hunter is my name. Mostly they call me Bull.\"    \"You got the size for that name, partner. So you cleaned up the  sheriff with a chair?\" he sighed. \"I wish I'd been there to see it.  But who got the inside on the sheriff?\"    \"I dunno what you mean?\"    Pete Reeve looked closely at his companion. Plainly he was bewildered,  somewhere between a smile and a frown.    \"I mean who found out that the sheriff done it?\"    \"He told it himself,\" said Bull.    \"Drunk, en?\"    \"Nope. Not drunk. He was asked if he didn't do the murder.\"    \"Great guns! Who asked him?\"    \"I done it,\" said Bull as simply as ever.    Reeve bit his lip. He had just put Bull down as a simple-minded hulk.  He was forced to revise his opinion.    \"You done that? You follered him up, eh?\"    \"I just done a little thinking. So I asked him.\"    Reeve shook his head. \"Maybe you hypnotized him,\" he suggested.    \"Nope. I just asked him. I got a lot of folks sitting around, and then  I began telling the sheriff how he done the shooting.\"    \"And he admitted it?\"    \"Nope. He jumped for a gun.\"    \"And then you heaved a chair at him.\" Pete Reeve drew in a long  breath. \"But what reason did you have, son? I got to ask you that  before I thank you the way I want to thank you. But, before you kick  out, you'll find that Pete Reeve is a friend.\"    \"My reason was,\" said Bull, \"that I had business to do with you that  couldn't be done in a jail. So I had to get you out.\"    \"And now where're we headed?\"    \"Where we can do that business.\"    They had reached a broad break in the cottonwoods; the moonlight was  falling so softly and brightly.    Bull paused and looked around him. \"I guess this'll have to do,\" he  declared.    \"All right, son. You can be as mysterious as you want. Now what you  got me here for?\"    \"To kill you,\" said Bull gently.    Pete Reeve flinched back. Then he tapped his holster, made sure of the  gun, became more easy. \"That's interesting,\" he announced. \"You  couldn't wait for the law to hang me, eh?\"    Bull began explaining laboriously. He pushed back his hat and began to  count off his points into the palm of one hand. \"You shot up Uncle  Bill Campbell,\" he explained. \"It ain't that I got any grudge agin'  you for that, but you see, Uncle Bill took me in young and give me a  home all these years. I thought it would sort of pay him back if I run  you down. So I walked across the mountains and come after you.\"    \"Wait!\" exclaimed Pete Reeve. \"You walked?\"    \"Yep,\" he went on, heedless of the fact that Pete Reeve was peering  earnestly into the face of his companion, now puckered with the  earnest frown of thought. \"I come down hoping to get you and kill you.  Besides, that wouldn't only pay back Uncle Bill. It would make him  think that I was a man. You see, Reeve, I ain't quick thinking, and I  ain't bright. I ain't got a quick tongue and sharp eyes, and they been  treating me like I was a kid all my life. So I got to do something. I  got to! I ain't got anything agin' you, but you just happen to be the  one that I got to fight. Stand over yonder by that stump. I'll stand  here, and we'll fight fair and square.\"    Pete Reeve obeyed, his movements slow, as if they were the result of  hypnotism. \"Bull,\" he said rather faintly, looking at the towering  bulk of his opponent, \"I dunno. Maybe I'm going nutty. But I figure  that you come down here to kill me for the sake of getting your uncle  to pat you on the back once or twice. And you find you can't get at me  because I'm in jail, so you work out a murder mystery to get me out,  and then you tackle me. You say you ain't very bright. I dunno.

In this sort of country a stranger might travel for miles without  seeming to have moved, for all the difference there is in the scenery.  The new tracks were 'blazed'--that is, slices of bark cut off from both  sides of trees, within sight of each other, in a line, to mark the track  until the horses and wheel-marks made it plain. A smart Bushman, with  a sharp tomahawk, can blaze a track as he rides. But a Bushman a little  used to the country soon picks out differences amongst the trees, half  unconsciously as it were, and so finds his way about.    Mary and I didn't talk much along this track--we couldn't have heard  each other very well, anyway, for the 'clock-clock' of the waggon and  the rattle of the cart over the hard lumpy ground. And I suppose we  both began to feel pretty dismal as the shadows lengthened. I'd noticed  lately that Mary and I had got out of the habit of talking to each  other--noticed it in a vague sort of way that irritated me (as vague  things will irritate one) when I thought of it. But then I thought, 'It  won't last long--I'll make life brighter for her by-and-by.'    As we went along--and the track seemed endless--I got brooding, of  course, back into the past. And I feel now, when it's too late, that  Mary must have been thinking that way too. I thought of my early  boyhood, of the hard life of 'grubbin'' and 'milkin'' and 'fencin'' and  'ploughin'' and 'ring-barkin'', &c., and all for nothing. The few months  at the little bark-school, with a teacher who couldn't spell. The cursed  ambition or craving that tortured my soul as a boy--ambition or craving  for--I didn't know what for! For something better and brighter, anyhow.  And I made the life harder by reading at night.    It all passed before me as I followed on in the waggon, behind Mary in  the spring-cart. I thought of these old things more than I thought of  her. She had tried to help me to better things. And I tried too--I had  the energy of half-a-dozen men when I saw a road clear before me,  but shied at the first check. Then I brooded, or dreamed of making a  home--that one might call a home--for Mary--some day. Ah, well!----    And what was Mary thinking about, along the lonely, changeless miles? I  never thought of that. Of her kind, careless, gentleman father, perhaps.  Of her girlhood. Of her homes--not the huts and camps she lived in with  me. Of our future?--she used to plan a lot, and talk a good deal of our  future--but not lately. These things didn't strike me at the time--I was  so deep in my own brooding. Did she think now--did she begin to feel  now that she had made a great mistake and thrown away her life, but must  make the best of it? This might have roused me, had I thought of it. But  whenever I thought Mary was getting indifferent towards me, I'd think,  'I'll soon win her back. We'll be sweethearts again--when things  brighten up a bit.'    It's an awful thing to me, now I look back to it, to think how far apart  we had grown, what strangers we were to each other. It seems, now, as  though we had been sweethearts long years before, and had parted, and  had never really met since.    The sun was going down when Mary called out--    'There's our place, Joe!'    She hadn't seen it before, and somehow it came new and with a shock to  me, who had been out here several times. Ahead, through the trees to  the right, was a dark green clump of the oaks standing out of the creek,  darker for the dead grey grass and blue-grey bush on the barren ridge in  the background. Across the creek (it was only a deep, narrow gutter--a  water-course with a chain of water-holes after rain), across on the  other bank, stood the hut, on a narrow flat between the spur and the  creek, and a little higher than this side. The land was much better than  on our old selection, and there was good soil along the creek on both  sides: I expected a rush of selectors out here soon. A few acres round  the hut was cleared and fenced in by a light two-rail fence of timber  split from logs and saplings. The man who took up this selection left it  because his wife died here.    It was a small oblong hut built of split slabs, and he had roofed it  with shingles which he split in spare times. There was no verandah, but  I built one later on. At the end of the house was a big slab-and-bark  shed, bigger than the hut itself, with a kitchen, a skillion for tools,  harness, and horse-feed, and a spare bedroom partitioned off with sheets  of bark and old chaff-bags. The house itself was floored roughly, with  cracks between the boards; there were cracks between the slabs all  round--though he'd nailed strips of tin, from old kerosene-tins, over  some of them; the partitioned-off bedroom was lined with old chaff-bags  with newspapers pasted over them for wall-paper. There was no ceiling,  calico or otherwise, and we could see the round pine rafters and  battens, and the under ends of the shingles. But ceilings make a hut hot  and harbour insects and reptiles--snakes sometimes. There was one  small glass window in the 'dining-room' with three panes and a sheet  of greased paper, and the rest were rough wooden shutters. There was a  pretty good cow-yard and calf-pen, and--that was about all. There was  no dam or tank (I made one later on); there was a water-cask, with the  hoops falling off and the staves gaping, at the corner of the house, and  spouting, made of lengths of bent tin, ran round under the eaves. Water  from a new shingle roof is wine-red for a year or two, and water from  a stringy-bark roof is like tan-water for years. In dry weather the  selector had got his house water from a cask sunk in the gravel at  the bottom of the deepest water-hole in the creek. And the longer the  drought lasted, the farther he had to go down the creek for his water,  with a cask on a cart, and take his cows to drink, if he had any. Four,  five, six, or seven miles--even ten miles to water is nothing in some  places.      James hadn't found himself called upon to do more than milk old 'Spot'  (the grandmother cow of our mob), pen the calf at night, make a fire  in the kitchen, and sweep out the house with a bough. He helped me  unharness and water and feed the horses, and then started to get the  furniture off the waggon and into the house. James wasn't lazy--so  long as one thing didn't last too long; but he was too uncomfortably  practical and matter-of-fact for me. Mary and I had some tea in the  kitchen. The kitchen was permanently furnished with a table of split  slabs, adzed smooth on top, and supported by four stakes driven into the  ground, a three-legged stool and a block of wood, and two long  stools made of half-round slabs (sapling trunks split in halves) with  auger-holes bored in the round side and sticks stuck into them for legs.  The floor was of clay; the chimney of slabs and tin; the fireplace  was about eight feet wide, lined with clay, and with a blackened pole  across, with sooty chains and wire hooks on it for the pots.    Mary didn't seem able to eat. She sat on the three-legged stool near the  fire, though it was warm weather, and kept her face turned from me.  Mary was still pretty, but not the little dumpling she had been: she was  thinner now. She had big dark hazel eyes that shone a little too much  when she was pleased or excited. I thought at times that there was  something very German about her expression; also something aristocratic  about the turn of her nose, which nipped in at the nostrils when she  spoke. There was nothing aristocratic about me. Mary was German in  figure and walk. I used sometimes to call her 'Little Duchy' and 'Pigeon  Toes'. She had a will of her own, as shown sometimes by the obstinate  knit in her forehead between the eyes.    Mary sat still by the fire, and presently I saw her chin tremble.    'What is it, Mary?'    She turned her face farther from me. I felt tired, disappointed, and  irritated--suffering from a reaction.    'Now, what is it, Mary?' I asked; 'I'm sick of this sort of thing.  Haven't you got everything you wanted? You've had your own way. What's  the matter with you now?'    'You know very well, Joe.'    'But I DON'T know,' I said. I knew too well.    She said nothing.    'Look here, Mary,' I said, putting my hand on her shoulder, 'don't go on  like that; tell me what's the matter?'    'It's only this,' she said suddenly, 'I can't stand this life here; it  will kill me!'    I had a pannikin of tea in my hand, and I banged it down on the table.    'This is more than a man can stand!' I shouted. 'You know very well that  it was you that dragged me out here. You run me on to this! Why weren't  you content to stay in Gulgong?'    'And what sort of a place was Gulgong, Joe?' asked Mary quietly.    (I thought even then in a flash what sort of a place Gulgong was. A  wretched remnant of a town on an abandoned goldfield. One street, each  side of the dusty main road; three or four one-storey square brick  cottages with hip roofs of galvanised iron that glared in the heat--four  rooms and a passage--the police-station, bank-manager and schoolmaster's  cottages, &c. Half-a-dozen tumble-down weather-board shanties--the three  pubs., the two stores, and the post-office. The town tailing off into  weather-board boxes with tin tops, and old bark huts--relics of the  digging days--propped up by many rotting poles. The men, when at home,  mostly asleep or droning over their pipes or hanging about the verandah  posts of the pubs., saying, ''Ullo, Bill!' or ''Ullo, Jim!'--or  sometimes drunk. The women, mostly hags, who blackened each other's and  girls' characters with their tongues, and criticised the aristocracy's  washing hung out on the line: 'And the colour of the clothes! Does that  woman wash her clothes at all? or only soak 'em and hang 'em out?'--"]]]
