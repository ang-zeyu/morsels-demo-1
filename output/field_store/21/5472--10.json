While they stood petrified, fascinated by the eyes of green fire, there  sounded in the wood a single deep bay. Martin trembled at it.    \"They have lost her, and laid muzzled bloodhounds on her scent;  they will find her here, and the venison. Good-bye, friends, Martin  Wittenhaagen ends here.\"    Gerard seized his bow, and put it into the soldier's hands.    \"Be a man,\" he cried; \"shoot her, and fling her into the wood ere they  come up. Who will know?\"    More voices of hounds broke out, and nearer.    \"Curse her!\" cried Martin; \"I spared her once; now she must die, or I,  or both more likely;\" and he reared his bow, and drew his arrow to the  head.    \"Nay! nay!\" cried Margaret, and seized the arrow. It broke in half: the  pieces fell on each side the bow. The air at the same time filled with  the tongues of the hounds: they were hot upon the scent.    \"What have you done, wench? You have put the halter round my throat.\"    \"No!\" cried Margaret. \"I have saved you: stand back from the window,  both! Your knife, quick!\"    She seized his long-pointed knife, almost tore it out of his girdle, and  darted from the room. The house was now surrounded with baying dogs and  shouting men.    The glowworm eyes moved not.        CHAPTER IX    Margaret cut off a huge piece of venison, and ran to the window and  threw it out to the green eyes of fire. They darted on to it with a  savage snarl; and there was a sound of rending and crunching: at this  moment, a hound uttered a bay so near and loud it rang through the  house; and the three at the window shrank together. Then the leopard  feared for her supper, and glided swiftly and stealthily away with it  towards the woods, and the very next moment horses and men and dogs came  helter-skelter past the window, and followed her full cry. Martin and  his companions breathed again: the leopard was swift, and would not  be caught within a league of their house. They grasped hands. Margaret  seized this opportunity, and cried a little; Gerard kissed the tears  away.    To table once more, and Gerard drank to woman's wit: \"'Tis stronger than  man's force,\" said he.    \"Ay,\" said Margaret, \"when those she loves are in danger; not else.\"    To-night Gerard stayed with her longer than usual, and went home prouder  than ever of her, and happy as a prince. Some little distance from home,  under the shadow of some trees, he encountered two figures: they almost  barred his way.    It was his father and mother.    Out so late! what could be the cause?    A chill fell on him.    He stopped and looked at them: they stood grim and silent. He stammered  out some words of inquiry.    \"Why ask?\" said the father; \"you know why we are here.\"    \"Oh, Gerard!\" said his mother, with a voice full of reproach yet of  affection.    Gerard's heart quaked: he was silent.    Then his father pitied his confusion, and said to him:    \"Nay, you need not to hang your head. You are not the first young fool  that has been caught by a red cheek and a pair of blue eyes.\"    \"Nay, nay!\" put in Catherine, \"it was witchcraft; Peter the Magician is  well known for that.\"    \"Come, Sir Priest,\" resumed his father, \"you know you must not meddle  with women folk. But give us your promise to go no more to Sevenbergen,  and here all ends: we won't be hard on you for one fault.\"    \"I cannot promise that, father.\"    \"Not promise it, you young hypocrite!\"    \"Nay, father, miscall me not: I lacked courage to tell you what I knew  would vex you; and right grateful am I to that good friend, whoever he  be, that has let you wot. 'Tis a load off my mind. Yes, father, I love  Margaret; and call me not a priest, for a priest I will never be. I will  die sooner.\"    \"That we shall see, young man. Come, gainsay me no more; you will learn  what 'tis to disrespect a father.\"    Gerard held his peace, and the three walked home in gloomy silence,  broken only by a deep sigh or two from Catherine.    From that hour the little house at Tergou was no longer the abode of  peace. Gerard was taken to task next day before the whole family; and  every voice was loud against him, except little Kate's and the dwarf's,  who was apt to take his cue from her without knowing why. As for  Cornelis and Sybrandt, they were bitterer than their father. Gerard  was dismayed at finding so many enemies, and looked wistfully into his  little sister's face: her eyes were brimming at the harsh words showered  on one who but yesterday was the universal pet. But she gave him no  encouragement: she turned her head away from him and said:    \"Dear, dear Gerard, pray to Heaven to cure you of this folly!\"    \"What, are you against me too?\" said Gerard, sadly; and he rose with a  deep sigh, and left the house and went to Sevenbergen.    The beginning of a quarrel, where the parties are bound by affection  though opposed in interest and sentiment, is comparatively innocent:  both are perhaps in the right at first starting, and then it is that  a calm, judicious friend, capable of seeing both sides, is a gift from  Heaven. For the longer the dissension endures, the wider and deeper it  grows by the fallibility and irascibility of human nature: these are  not confined to either side, and finally the invariable end is  reached--both in the wrong.    The combatants were unequally matched: Elias was angry, Cornelis and  Sybrandt spiteful; but Gerard, having a larger and more cultivated mind,  saw both sides where they saw but one, and had fits of irresolution,  and was not wroth, but unhappy. He was lonely, too, in this struggle.  He could open his heart to no one. Margaret was a high-spirited girl:  he dared not tell her what he had to endure at home; she was capable of  siding with his relations by resigning him, though at the cost of her  own happiness. Margaret Van Eyck had been a great comfort to him on  another occasion; but now he dared not make her his confidant. Her own  history was well known. In early life she had many offers of marriage;  but refused them all for the sake of that art, to which a wife's and  mother's duties are so fatal: thus she remained single and painted with  her brothers. How could he tell her that he declined the benefice she  had got him, and declined it for the sake of that which at his age she  had despised and sacrificed so lightly?    Gerard at this period bade fair to succumb. But the other side had a  horrible ally in Catherine, senior. This good-hearted but uneducated  woman could not, like her daughter, act quietly and firmly: still less  could she act upon a plan. She irritated Gerard at times, and so helped  him; for anger is a great sustainer of the courage: at others she turned  round in a moment and made onslaughts on her own forces. To take  a single instance out of many: one day that they were all at home,  Catherine and all, Cornelis said: \"Our Gerard wed Margaret Brandt? Why,  it is hunger marrying thirst.\"    \"And what will it be when you marry?\" cried Catherine. \"Gerard can  paint, Gerard can write, but what can you do to keep a woman, ye lazy  loon? Nought but wait for your father's shoon. Oh we can see why you and  Sybrandt would not have the poor boy to marry. You are afraid he will  come to us for a share of our substance. And say that he does, and say  that we give it him, it isn't yourn we part from, and mayhap never will  be.\"    On these occasions Gerard smiled slily, and picked up heart, and  temporary confusion fell on Catherine's unfortunate allies. But at last,  after more than six months of irritation, came the climax. The father  told the son before the whole family he had ordered the burgomaster  to imprison him in the Stadthouse rather than let him marry Margaret.  Gerard turned pale with anger at this, but by a great effort held his  peace. His father went on to say, \"And a priest you shall be before the  year is out, nilly-willy.\"    \"Is it so?\" cried Gerard. \"Then, hear me, all. By God and St. Bavon I  swear I will never be a priest while Margaret lives. Since force is to  decide it, and not love and duty, try force, father; but force shall not  serve you, for the day I see the burgomaster come for me, I leave Tergou  for ever, and Holland too, and my father's house, where it seems I have  been valued all these years, not for myself, but for what is to be got  out of me.\"    And he flung out of the room white with anger and desperation.    \"There!\" cried Catherine, \"that comes of driving young folks too hard.  But men are crueller than tigers, even to their own flesh and blood.  Now, Heaven forbid he should ever leave us, married or single.\"    As Gerard came out of the house, his cheeks pale and his heart panting,  he met Reicht Heynes: she had a message for him: Margaret Van Eyck  desired to see him. He found the old lady seated grim as a judge. She  wasted no time in preliminaries, but inquired coldly why he had not  visited her of late: before he could answer, she said in a sarcastic  tone, \"I thought we had been friends, young sir.\"    At this Gerard looked the picture of doubt and consternation.    \"It is because you never told her you were in love,\" said Reicht Heynes,  pitying his confusion.    \"Silence, wench! Why should he tell us his affairs? We are not his  friends: we have not deserved his confidence.\"    \"Alas! my second mother,\" said Gerard, \"I did not dare to tell you my  folly.\"    \"What folly? Is it folly to love?\"    \"I am told so every day of my life.\"    \"You need not have been afraid to tell my mistress; she is always kind  to true lovers.\"    \"Madam--Reicht I was afraid because I was told...\"    \"Well, you were told--?\"    \"That in your youth you scorned love, preferring art.\"    \"I did, boy; and what is the end of it? Behold me here a barren stock,  while the women of my youth have a troop of children at their side, and  grandchildren at their knee I gave up the sweet joys of wifehood and  motherhood for what? For my dear brothers. "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/13665"],[0,"War in the Garden of Eden (#13)"],[1,"and far  from any source of supply. The German prisoners were apt to cringe at  first, but as soon as they found they were not to be oppressed became  arrogant and overbearing. At different times we retook men that had been  captives for varying lengths of time. I remember a Tommy, from the  Manchesters, if I am not mistaken, who had been taken before Kut fell, but  had soon after made his escape and lived among the Kurdish tribesmen for  seven or eight months before he found his way back to us. Quite a number  of Indians who had been set to work on the construction of the  Berlin-to-Baghdad Railway between Nisibin and Mosul made good their escape  and struggled through to our lines.    It was a great relief when the Red Cross lorries came in and we could turn  over the wounded to them. All night long they journeyed back and forth  transporting such as could stand the trip to the main evacuation camp at  Haditha.    By daybreak we were once more under way. Under cover of darkness the Arabs  had pillaged the abandoned supplies, in some cases killing the wounded  Turks. The transport animals of the enemy and their cavalry horses were  in very bad shape. They had evidently been hard put to it to bring through  sufficient fodder during the wet winter months when the roads were so deep  in mud as to be all but impassable. Instead of being distant from Ana the  eight miles that we had measured on the map, we found that we were  seventeen, but we made it without any serious hindrance. The town was most  attractive, embowered in gardens which skirt the river's edge for a  distance of four or five miles. In addition to the usual palms and  fruit-trees there were great gnarled olives, the first I had seen in  Mesopotamia, as were also the almond-trees. It must be of great antiquity,  for the prophet Isaiah speaks of it as a place where kings had reigned,  but from which, even in his time, the grandeur had departed.    The greater part of the enemy had already abandoned the town, but we  captured the Turkish governor and a good number of the garrison, and many  that had escaped from Haditha. The disaster at Khan Baghdadi had only been  reported the afternoon before, as we had of course cut all the telegraph  wires, and the governor had not thought it possible we would continue the  pursuit so far. He had spent most of his life in Hungary and had been  given this post only a few months previous to our advance. From the  prisoners we had taken at Haditha we had extracted conflicting estimates  as to the time when Colonel Tennant, the commander of our air forces, had  been sent on, and from those we took at Ana we received equally varying  accounts. The cars had been ordered to push on in search of the colonel as  long as sufficient gasolene remained to bring them back. Captain Todd with  the Eighth Battery was in the lead when some thirty miles north of Ana  they caught sight of a group of camels surrounded by horsemen. A couple of  belts from the machine-guns scattered the escort, and Colonel Tennant and  his companion, Major Hobart, were soon safe in the turret of one of the  cars.    From some of our Turkish captives we heard about a large gold convoy which  had been sent back from Ana; some said one day, and others two, before our  arrival. The supply of fuel that we had brought in the tenders was almost  exhausted, so that it would be necessary to procure more in order to  continue the pursuit. Major Thompson, who was in command of the  armored-car detachment, instructed me to take all the tenders and go back  as far as was necessary to find a petrol dump from which I could draw a  thousand gallons. I emptied the trucks and loaded them with such of the  wounded as could stand the jolting they were bound to receive because of  the speed at which I must travel. I also took a few of the more important  prisoners, among them the governor of Ana. He was a cultivated middle-aged  man who spoke no Arabic but quite good French. It was mid-afternoon when  we started, and I hadn't the most remote idea where I would find a  sufficient quantity of petrol. During the run back we were sniped at  occasionally by Turks who were still hiding in the hills. A small but  determined force could have completely halted the cars in a number of  different places where the road wound through narrow rock-crowned gorges,  or along ledges cut in the hillside and hemmed in by the river. In such  spots the advance of the armored cars could either have been completely  checked, or at all events seriously hampered and delayed, merely by  rolling great boulders down on top of us.    When we had retraced our steps for about sixty miles I was lucky enough  to get wind of an enemy petrol dump that our men had discovered. It was a  special aeroplane supply and the colonel of the infantry regiment who was  guarding it had been instructed to allow none of it to be used for  automobiles. He showed his desire to co-operate and his ability to read  the spirit rather than the letter of a command by letting me load my  tenders. The L.A.M. batteries were well regarded and we everywhere  encountered a willingness to meet us more than half-way and aid us in the  thousand and one points that make so much difference in obtaining results.    By the time that we had everything in readiness for our return run it was  long after dark and the men were exhausted. I managed to get some tea, but  naturally no sugar or milk. The strong steaming brew served to wash down  the scanty supply of cold bully beef. Fortunately it was a brilliant  starlit night, but even so it was difficult to avoid ditches and washouts,  and the road seemed interminable. Not long after we left we ran into a  couple of armored cars that had been detailed to bring the rescued  aviators back, after they had been reoutfitted and supplied as far as our  limited resources would permit. During the halt I found that my sergeant  had produced from somewhere or other an emergency rum ration which he was  issuing. An old-army, experienced sergeant always managed to hold over a  reserve from former issues for just such occasions as this, when it would  be of inestimable value. I had been driving all day and had the greatest  difficulty in keeping awake. Twice I dozed off. Once I awakened just as  the car started over the edge of an embankment; the other time a large  rock in the road brought me back to the world. It was two o'clock in the  morning when we wearily crept into Ana.    The expedition to capture the gold convoy was to start at four, so after  two hours' sleep I bundled into one of the Rolls-Royces and the column  swung out into the road. Through the mist loomed the sinister,  businesslike outlines of the armored car ahead of me. Captain Carr of the  Thirteenth L.A.M.B.'s[1] was in command of the expedition. Unless we were  in action or in a locality where we momentarily expected to be under fire  from rifle or machine-gun, the officer commanding the car and his N.C.O.  stood in the well behind the turret, steadying themselves with leather  loops riveted to its sides. On long runs the tool-boxes on either side of  the well formed convenient seats. When the car became engaged the crew  would get inside, pulling the steel doors shut. The slits through which  the driver and the man next him looked could be made still smaller when  the firing was heavy, and the peep-holes at either side and in the rear  had slides which could be closed. The largest aperture was that around the  tube of the gun. Splinters of lead came in continuously, and sometimes  chance directed a bullet to an opening. One of our drivers was shot  straight through the head near Ramadie. The bottom of the car was of wood,  and bullets would ricochet up through it, but to have had it made of steel  would have added too much weight. The large gasolene-tank behind was  usually protected by plating, but even so was fairly vulnerable. A  reserve-tank holding ten gallons was built inside the turret. We almost  invariably had trouble with the feed-pipes leading from it. During the  great heat of the summer the inside of the turret was a veritable fiery  furnace, with the pedals so hot that they scorched the feet.    [Footnote 1: Light Armored Motor Battery.]    Forty miles above Ana we came upon a large khan. These road-houses are  built at intervals along the main caravan routes. Their plan is simple:  four walls with two tiers of rooms or booths built into them, enclosing an  open court in which the camels and horses are tethered during the night.  The whole is strongly made to resist the inroads of the desert tribesmen.  As we drove to the heavy gate, a wild clamor met our ears from a confused  jumble of Jewish and Armenian merchants that had taken refuge within. Some  of them had left Ana on their way to Aleppo before the news of the fall of  Khan Baghdadi had reached the town. Others had been despatched by the  Turks when the news of our advance arrived. All had been to a greater or  lesser degree plundered by the Arabs. Most of the baggage animals had been  run off, and the merchants were powerless to move. The women were weeping  and imploring help, and the children tumbled about among the confused  heaps of merchandise. Some of the Armenians had relations in Baghdad about  whom I was able to give them bits of information. All begged permission to  go back to Ana and thence to the capital. We, of course, had no means of  supplying them with transportation, and any attempt to recapture their  lost property was out of the question.    A few miles on we made out a troop of Arabs hurrying inland, a mile or so  away from us, across a couple of ravines. They had some of the stolen  camels and were laden down with plunder. Two of our cars made a fruitless  attempt to come to terms with them, but only succeeded in placing a few  well-aimed bursts from their machine-guns among them.    We now began to come up with bands of Turks. We ran"]]]
