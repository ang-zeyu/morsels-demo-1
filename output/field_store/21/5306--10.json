The afternoon had come when the Sheriff mounted his horse and joined  Robin Hood, who stood outside the gateway of the paved court waiting for  him, for he had sold his horse and cart to a trader for two marks. Then  they set forth upon their way, the Sheriff riding upon his horse and  Robin running beside him. Thus they left Nottingham Town and traveled  forward along the dusty highway, laughing and jesting together as though  they had been old friends. But all the time the Sheriff said within  himself, \"Thy jest to me of Robin Hood shall cost thee dear, good  fellow, even four hundred pounds, thou fool.\" For he thought he would  make at least that much by his bargain.    So they journeyed onward till they came within the verge of Sherwood  Forest, when presently the Sheriff looked up and down and to the right  and to the left of him, and then grew quiet and ceased his laughter.  \"Now,\" quoth he, \"may Heaven and its saints preserve us this day from a  rogue men call Robin Hood.\"    Then Robin laughed aloud. \"Nay,\" said he, \"thou mayst set thy mind at  rest, for well do I know Robin Hood and well do I know that thou art in  no more danger from him this day than thou art from me.\"    At this the Sheriff looked askance at Robin, saying to himself, \"I like  not that thou seemest so well acquainted with this bold outlaw, and I  wish that I were well out of Sherwood Forest.\"    But still they traveled deeper into the forest shades, and the deeper  they went, the more quiet grew the Sheriff. At last they came to where  the road took a sudden bend, and before them a herd of dun deer went  tripping across the path. Then Robin Hood came close to the Sheriff and  pointing his finger, he said, \"These are my horned beasts, good Master  Sheriff. How dost thou like them? Are they not fat and fair to see?\"    At this the Sheriff drew rein quickly. \"Now fellow,\" quoth he, \"I would  I were well out of this forest, for I like not thy company. Go thou  thine own path, good friend, and let me but go mine.\"    But Robin only laughed and caught the Sheriff's bridle rein. \"Nay,\"  cried he, \"stay awhile, for I would thou shouldst see my brothers, who  own these fair horned beasts with me.\" So saying, he clapped his bugle  to his mouth and winded three merry notes, and presently up the path  came leaping fivescore good stout yeomen with Little John at their head.    \"What wouldst thou have, good master?\" quoth Little John.    \"Why,\" answered Robin, \"dost thou not see that I have brought goodly  company to feast with us today? Fye, for shame! Do you not see our good  and worshipful master, the Sheriff of Nottingham? Take thou his bridle,  Little John, for he has honored us today by coming to feast with us.\"    Then all doffed their hats humbly, without smiling or seeming to be in  jest, while Little John took the bridle rein and led the palfrey still  deeper into the forest, all marching in order, with Robin Hood walking  beside the Sheriff, hat in hand.    All this time the Sheriff said never a word but only looked about him  like one suddenly awakened from sleep; but when he found himself going  within the very depths of Sherwood his heart sank within him, for he  thought, \"Surely my three hundred pounds will be taken from me, even  if they take not my life itself, for I have plotted against their lives  more than once.\" But all seemed humble and meek and not a word was said  of danger, either to life or money.    So at last they came to that part of Sherwood Forest where a noble oak  spread its branches wide, and beneath it was a seat all made of moss, on  which Robin sat down, placing the Sheriff at his right hand. \"Now busk  ye, my merry men all,\" quoth he, \"and bring forth the best we have,  both of meat and wine, for his worship the Sheriff hath feasted me in  Nottingham Guild Hall today, and I would not have him go back empty.\"    All this time nothing had been said of the Sheriff's money, so presently  he began to pluck up heart. \"For,\" said he to himself, \"maybe Robin Hood  hath forgotten all about it.\"    Then, while beyond in the forest bright fires crackled and savory smells  of sweetly roasting venison and fat capons filled the glade, and brown  pasties warmed beside the blaze, did Robin Hood entertain the Sheriff  right royally. First, several couples stood forth at quarterstaff, and  so shrewd were they at the game, and so quickly did they give stroke  and parry, that the Sheriff, who loved to watch all lusty sports of  the kind, clapped his hands, forgetting where he was, and crying aloud,  \"Well struck! Well struck, thou fellow with the black beard!\" little  knowing that the man he called upon was the Tinker that tried to serve  his warrant upon Robin Hood.    Then several yeomen came forward and spread cloths upon the green grass,  and placed a royal feast; while others still broached barrels of sack  and Malmsey and good stout ale, and set them in jars upon the cloth,  with drinking horns about them. Then all sat down and feasted and drank  merrily together until the sun was low and the half-moon glimmered with  a pale light betwixt the leaves of the trees overhead.    Then the Sheriff arose and said, \"I thank you all, good yeomen, for the  merry entertainment ye have given me this day. Right courteously have ye  used me, showing therein that ye have much respect for our glorious King  and his deputy in brave Nottinghamshire. But the shadows grow long,  and I must away before darkness comes, lest I lose myself within the  forest.\"    Then Robin Hood and all his merry men arose also, and Robin said to the  Sheriff, \"If thou must go, worshipful sir, go thou must; but thou hast  forgotten one thing.\"    \"Nay, I forgot nought,\" said the Sheriff; yet all the same his heart  sank within him.    \"But I say thou hast forgot something,\" quoth Robin. \"We keep a merry  inn here in the greenwood, but whoever becometh our guest must pay his  reckoning.\"    Then the Sheriff laughed, but the laugh was hollow. \"Well, jolly boys,\"  quoth he, \"we have had a merry time together today, and even if ye had  not asked me, I would have given you a score of pounds for the sweet  entertainment I have had.\"    \"Nay,\" quoth Robin seriously, \"it would ill beseem us to treat Your  Worship so meanly. By my faith, Sir Sheriff, I would be ashamed to show  my face if I did not reckon the King's deputy at three hundred pounds.  Is it not so, my merry men all?\"    Then \"Ay!\" cried all, in a loud voice.    \"Three hundred devils!\" roared the Sheriff. \"Think ye that your beggarly  feast was worth three pounds, let alone three hundred?\"    \"Nay,\" quoth Robin gravely. \"Speak not so roundly, Your Worship. I  do love thee for the sweet feast thou hast given me this day in merry  Nottingham Town; but there be those here who love thee not so much. If  thou wilt look down the cloth thou wilt see Will Stutely, in whose eyes  thou hast no great favor; then two other stout fellows are there here  that thou knowest not, that were wounded in a brawl nigh Nottingham  Town, some time ago--thou wottest when; one of them was sore hurt in one  arm, yet he hath got the use of it again. Good Sheriff, be advised by  me; pay thy score without more ado, or maybe it may fare ill with thee.\"    As he spoke the Sheriff's ruddy cheeks grew pale, and he said nothing  more but looked upon the ground and gnawed his nether lip. Then slowly  he drew forth his fat purse and threw it upon the cloth in front of him.    \"Now take the purse, Little John,\" quoth Robin Hood, \"and see that the  reckoning be right. We would not doubt our Sheriff, but he might not  like it if he should find he had not paid his full score.\"    Then Little John counted the money and found that the bag held three  hundred pounds in silver and gold. But to the Sheriff it seemed as if  every clink of the bright money was a drop of blood from his veins. And  when he saw it all counted out in a heap of silver and gold, filling a  wooden platter, he turned away and silently mounted his horse.    \"Never have we had so worshipful a guest before!\" quoth Robin, \"and, as  the day waxeth late, I will send one of my young men to guide thee out  of the forest depths.\"    \"Nay, Heaven forbid!\" cried the Sheriff hastily. \"I can find mine own  way, good man, without aid.\"    \"Then I will put thee on the right track mine own self,\" quoth Robin,  and, taking the Sheriff's horse by the bridle rein, he led him into the  main forest path. Then, before he let him go, he said, \"Now, fare thee  well, good Sheriff, and when next thou thinkest to despoil some poor  prodigal, remember thy feast in Sherwood Forest. 'Ne'er buy a horse,  good friend, without first looking into its mouth,' as our good gaffer  Swanthold says. And so, once more, fare thee well.\" Then he clapped  his hand to the horse's back, and off went nag and Sheriff through the  forest glades.    Then bitterly the Sheriff rued the day that first he meddled with Robin  Hood, for all men laughed at him and many ballads were sung by folk  throughout the country, of how the Sheriff went to shear and came home  shorn to the very quick. For thus men sometimes overreach themselves  through greed and guile.          Little John Goes to Nottingham Fair    SPRING HAD GONE since the Sheriff's feast in Sherwood, and summer also,  and the mellow month of October had come. All the air was cool and  fresh; the harvests were gathered home, the young birds were full  fledged, the hops were plucked, and apples were ripe. But though time  had so smoothed things over that men no longer talked of the horned  beasts that the Sheriff wished to buy, he was still sore about the  matter and could not bear to hear Robin Hood's name spoken in his  presence.    With October had come the time for holding the"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/965"],[0,"The Black Tulip (#12)"],[1,"in  his dry-room, with his feet resting on the foot-bar of the table, and  his elbows on the cover, looking with intense delight on three suckers  which he had just detached from the mother bulb, pure, perfect,  and entire, and from which was to grow that wonderful produce of  horticulture which would render the name of Cornelius van Baerle for  ever illustrious.    \"I shall find the black tulip,\" said Cornelius to himself, whilst  detaching the suckers. \"I shall obtain the hundred thousand guilders  offered by the Society. I shall distribute them among the poor of Dort;  and thus the hatred which every rich man has to encounter in times of  civil wars will be soothed down, and I shall be able, without fearing  any harm either from Republicans or Orangists, to keep as heretofore my  borders in splendid condition. I need no more be afraid lest on the day  of a riot the shopkeepers of the town and the sailors of the port should  come and tear out my bulbs, to boil them as onions for their families,  as they have sometimes quietly threatened when they happened to remember  my having paid two or three hundred guilders for one bulb. It is  therefore settled I shall give the hundred thousand guilders of the  Haarlem prize to-the poor. And yet----\"    Here Cornelius stopped and heaved a sigh. \"And yet,\" he continued,  \"it would have been so very delightful to spend the hundred thousand  guilders on the enlargement of my tulip-bed or even on a journey to the  East, the country of beautiful flowers. But, alas! these are no thoughts  for the present times, when muskets, standards, proclamations, and  beating of drums are the order of the day.\"    Van Baerle raised his eyes to heaven and sighed again. Then turning his  glance towards his bulbs,--objects of much greater importance to him  than all those muskets, standards, drums, and proclamations, which he  conceived only to be fit to disturb the minds of honest people,--he  said:--    \"These are, indeed, beautiful bulbs; how smooth they are, how well  formed; there is that air of melancholy about them which promises to  produce a flower of the colour of ebony. On their skin you cannot  even distinguish the circulating veins with the naked eye. Certainly,  certainly, not a light spot will disfigure the tulip which I have called  into existence. And by what name shall we call this offspring of my  sleepless nights, of my labour and my thought? Tulipa nigra Barlaensis?    \"Yes Barlaensis: a fine name. All the tulip-fanciers--that is to say,  all the intelligent people of Europe--will feel a thrill of excitement  when the rumour spreads to the four quarters of the globe: The  grand black tulip is found! 'How is it called?' the fanciers will  ask.--'Tulipa nigra Barlaensis!'--'Why Barlaensis?'--'After its grower,  Van Baerle,' will be the answer.--'And who is this Van Baerle?'--'It is  the same who has already produced five new tulips: the Jane, the John  de Witt, the Cornelius de Witt, etc.' Well, that is what I call my  ambition. It will cause tears to no one. And people will talk of  my Tulipa nigra Barlaensis when perhaps my godfather, this sublime  politician, is only known from the tulip to which I have given his name.    \"Oh! these darling bulbs!    \"When my tulip has flowered,\" Baerle continued in his soliloquy, \"and  when tranquillity is restored in Holland, I shall give to the poor only  fifty thousand guilders, which, after all, is a goodly sum for a man who  is under no obligation whatever. Then, with the remaining fifty thousand  guilders, I shall make experiments. With them I shall succeed in  imparting scent to the tulip. Ah! if I succeed in giving it the odour of  the rose or the carnation, or, what would be still better, a completely  new scent; if I restored to this queen of flowers its natural  distinctive perfume, which she has lost in passing from her Eastern to  her European throne, and which she must have in the Indian peninsula at  Goa, Bombay, and Madras, and especially in that island which in olden  times, as is asserted, was the terrestrial paradise, and which is called  Ceylon,--oh, what glory! I must say, I would then rather be Cornelius  van Baerle than Alexander, Caesar, or Maximilian.    \"Oh the admirable bulbs!\"    Thus Cornelius indulged in the delights of contemplation, and was  carried away by the sweetest dreams.    Suddenly the bell of his cabinet was rung much more violently than  usual.    Cornelius, startled, laid his hands on his bulbs, and turned round.    \"Who is here?\" he asked.    \"Sir,\" answered the servant, \"it is a messenger from the Hague.\"    \"A messenger from the Hague! What does he want?\"    \"Sir, it is Craeke.\"    \"Craeke! the confidential servant of Mynheer John de Witt? Good, let him  wait.\"    \"I cannot wait,\" said a voice in the lobby.    And at the same time forcing his way in, Craeke rushed into the  dry-room.    This abrupt entrance was such an infringement on the established rules  of the household of Cornelius van Baerle, that the latter, at the sight  of Craeke, almost convulsively moved his hand which covered the bulbs,  so that two of them fell on the floor, one of them rolling under a small  table, and the other into the fireplace.    \"Zounds!\" said Cornelius, eagerly picking up his precious bulbs, \"what's  the matter?\"    \"The matter, sir!\" said Craeke, laying a paper on the large table, on  which the third bulb was lying,--\"the matter is, that you are requested  to read this paper without losing one moment.\"    And Craeke, who thought he had remarked in the streets of Dort symptoms  of a tumult similar to that which he had witnessed before his departure  from the Hague, ran off without even looking behind him.    \"All right! all right! my dear Craeke,\" said Cornelius, stretching his  arm under the table for the bulb; \"your paper shall be read, indeed it  shall.\"    Then, examining the bulb which he held in the hollow of his hand, he  said: \"Well, here is one of them uninjured. That confounded Craeke! thus  to rush into my dry-room; let us now look after the other.\"    And without laying down the bulb which he already held, Baerle went to  the fireplace, knelt down and stirred with the tip of his finger the  ashes, which fortunately were quite cold.    He at once felt the other bulb.    \"Well, here it is,\" he said; and, looking at it with almost fatherly  affection, he exclaimed, \"Uninjured as the first!\"    At this very instant, and whilst Cornelius, still on his knees, was  examining his pets, the door of the dry-room was so violently shaken,  and opened in such a brusque manner, that Cornelius felt rising in his  cheeks and his ears the glow of that evil counsellor which is called  wrath.    \"Now, what is it again,\" he demanded; \"are people going mad here?\"    \"Oh, sir! sir!\" cried the servant, rushing into the dry-room with a much  paler face and with a much more frightened mien than Craeke had shown.    \"Well!\" asked Cornelius, foreboding some mischief from the double breach  of the strict rule of his house.    \"Oh, sir, fly! fly quick!\" cried the servant.    \"Fly! and what for?\"    \"Sir, the house is full of the guards of the States.\"    \"What do they want?\"    \"They want you.\"    \"What for?\"    \"To arrest you.\"    \"Arrest me? arrest me, do you say?\"    \"Yes, sir, and they are headed by a magistrate.\"    \"What's the meaning of all this?\" said Van Baerle, grasping in his hands  the two bulbs, and directing his terrified glance towards the staircase.    \"They are coming up! they are coming up!\" cried the servant.    \"Oh, my dear child, my worthy master!\" cried the old housekeeper, who  now likewise made her appearance in the dry-room, \"take your gold, your  jewelry, and fly, fly!\"    \"But how shall I make my escape, nurse?\" said Van Baerle.    \"Jump out of the window.\"    \"Twenty-five feet from the ground!\"    \"But you will fall on six feet of soft soil!\"    \"Yes, but I should fall on my tulips.\"    \"Never mind, jump out.\"    Cornelius took the third bulb, approached the window and opened it, but  seeing what havoc he would necessarily cause in his borders, and, more  than this, what a height he would have to jump, he called out, \"Never!\"  and fell back a step.    At this moment they saw across the banister of the staircase the points  of the halberds of the soldiers rising.    The housekeeper raised her hands to heaven.    As to Cornelius van Baerle, it must be stated to his honour, not as a  man, but as a tulip-fancier, his only thought was for his inestimable  bulbs.    Looking about for a paper in which to wrap them up, he noticed the  fly-leaf from the Bible, which Craeke had laid upon the table, took it  without in his confusion remembering whence it came, folded in it the  three bulbs, secreted them in his bosom, and waited.    At this very moment the soldiers, preceded by a magistrate, entered the  room.    \"Are you Dr. Cornelius van Baerle?\" demanded the magistrate (who,  although knowing the young man very well, put his question according to  the forms of justice, which gave his proceedings a much more dignified  air).    \"I am that person, Master van Spennen,\" answered Cornelius, politely, to  his judge, \"and you know it very well.\"    \"Then give up to us the seditious papers which you secrete in your  house.\"    \"The seditious papers!\" repeated Cornelius, quite dumfounded at the  imputation.    \"Now don't look astonished, if you please.\"    \"I vow to you, Master van Spennen,\" Cornelius replied, \"that I am  completely at a loss to understand what you want.\"    \"Then I shall put you in the way, Doctor,\" said the judge; \"give up to  us the papers which the traitor Cornelius de Witt deposited with you in  the month of January last.\"    A sudden light came into the mind of Cornelius.    \"Halloa!\" said Van Spennen, \"you begin now to remember, don't you?\"    \"Indeed I do, but you spoke of seditious papers, and I have none of that  sort.\"    \"You deny it then?\"    \"Certainly I do.\"    The"]]]
