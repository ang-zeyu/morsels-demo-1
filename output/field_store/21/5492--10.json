Just when I would so eagerly go into it with him....  There's something the matter now, something--it may be grave. I feel he  wants to tell me. And there it is!--it seems I am the last person to  whom he can humiliate himself by a confession of blundering, or  weakness.... Something I should just laugh at and say, 'That's in the  blood of all of us, dear Spit of myself. Let's see what's to be  done.'...\"    He paused and then went on, finding in the unfamiliarity and  transitoriness of his visitor a freedom he might have failed to find in  a close friend.    \"I am frightened at times at all I don't know about in that boy's mind.  I know nothing of his religiosities. He's my son and he must have  religiosities. I know nothing of his ideas or of his knowledge about sex  and all that side of life. I do not know of the things he finds  beautiful. I can guess at times; that's all; when he betrays himself....  You see, you don't know really what love is until you have children. One  doesn't love women. Indeed you don't! One gives and gets; it's a trade.  One may have tremendous excitements and expectations and overwhelming  desires. That's all very well in its way. But the love of children is an  exquisite tenderness: it rends the heart. It's a thing of God. And I lie  awake at nights and stretch out my hands in the darkness to this  lad--who will never know--until his sons come in their time....\"    He made one of his quick turns again.    \"And that's where our English way makes for distresses. Mr. Prussian  respects and fears his father; respects authorities, attends, obeys  and--_his father has a hold upon him_. But I said to myself at the  outset, 'No, whatever happens, I will not usurp the place of God. I will  not be the Priest-Patriarch of my children. They shall grow and I will  grow beside them, helping but not cramping or overshadowing.' They grow  more. But they blunder more. Life ceases to be a discipline and becomes  an experiment....\"    \"That's very true,\" said Mr. Direck, to whom it seemed the time was ripe  to say something. \"This is the problem of America perhaps even more than  of England. Though I have not had the parental experience you have  undergone.... I can see very clearly that a son is a very serious  proposition.\"    \"The old system of life was organisation. That is where Germany is still  the most ancient of European states. It's a reversion to a tribal cult.  It's atavistic.... To organise or discipline, or mould characters or  press authority, is to assume that you have reached finality in your  general philosophy. It implies an assured end. Heinrich has his assured  end, his philological professorship or thereabouts as a part of the  Germanic machine. And that too has its assured end in German national  assertion. Here, we have none of those convictions. We know we haven't  finality, and so we are open and apologetic and receptive, rather than  wilful.... You see all organisation, with its implication of finality,  is death. We feel that. The Germans don't. What you organise you kill.  Organised morals or organised religion or organised thought are dead  morals and dead religion and dead thought. Yet some organisation you  must have. Organisation is like killing cattle. If you do not kill some  the herd is just waste. But you musn't kill all or you kill the herd.  The unkilled cattle are the herd, the continuation; the unorganised side  of life is the real life. The reality of life is adventure, not  performance. What isn't adventure isn't life. What can be ruled about  can be machined. But priests and schoolmasters and bureaucrats get hold  of life and try to make it _all_ rules, _all_ etiquette and regulation  and correctitude.... And parents and the love of parents make for the  same thing. It is all very well to experiment for oneself, but when one  sees these dear things of one's own, so young and inexperienced and so  capable of every sort of gallant foolishness, walking along the narrow  plank, going down into dark jungles, ah! then it makes one want to wrap  them in laws and foresight and fence them about with 'Verboten' boards  in all the conceivable aspects....\"    \"In America of course we do set a certain store upon youthful  self-reliance,\" said Mr. Direck.    \"As we do here. It's in your blood and our blood. It's the instinct of  the English and the Irish anyhow to suspect government and take the  risks of the chancy way.... And manifestly the Russians, if you read  their novelists, have the same twist in them.... When we get this young  Prussian here, he's a marvel to us. He really believes in Law. He  _likes_ to obey. That seems a sort of joke to us. It's curious how  foreign these Germans are--to all the rest of the world. Because of  their docility. Scratch the Russian and you get the Tartar. Educate the  Russian or the American or the Englishman or the Irishman or Frenchman  or any real northern European except the German, and you get the  Anarchist, that is to say the man who dreams of order without  organisation--of something beyond organisation....    \"It's one o'clock,\" said Mr. Britling abruptly, perceiving a shade of  fatigue upon the face of his hearer and realising that his thoughts had  taken him too far, \"and Sunday. Let's go to bed.\"      Section 11    For a time Mr. Direck could not sleep. His mind had been too excited by  this incessant day with all its novelties and all its provocations to  comparison. The whole complicated spectacle grouped itself, with a  naturalness and a complete want of logic that all who have been young  will understand, about Cecily Corner.    She had to be in the picture, and so she came in as though she were the  central figure, as though she were the quintessential England. There she  was, the type, the blood, the likeness, of no end of Massachusetts  families, the very same stuff indeed, and yet she was different....    For a time his thoughts hovered ineffectively about certain details of  her ear and cheek, and one may doubt if his interest in these things was  entirely international....    Then he found himself under way with an exposition of certain points to  Mr. Britling. In the security of his bed he could imagine that he was  talking very slowly and carefully while Mr. Britling listened; already  he was more than half way to dreamland or he could not have supposed  anything so incredible.    \"There's a curious sort of difference,\" he was saying. \"It is difficult  to define, but on the whole I might express it by saying that such a  gathering as this if it was in America would be drawn with harder lines,  would show its bones more and have everything more emphatic. And just to  take one illustrative point: in America in such a gathering as this  there would be bound to be several jokes going on as it were, running  jokes and running criticisms, from day to day and from week to week....  There would be jokes about your writing and your influence and jokes  about Miss Corner's advanced reading.... You see, in America we pay much  more attention to personal character. Here people, I notice, are not  talked to about their personal characters at all, and many of them do  not seem to be aware and do not seem to mind what personal characters  they have....    \"And another thing I find noteworthy is the way in which what I might  call mature people seem to go on having a good time instead of standing  by and applauding the young people having a good time.... And the young  people do not seem to have set out to have a good time at all.... Now in  America, a charming girl like Miss Corner would be distinctly more aware  of herself and her vitality than she is here, distinctly more. Her  peculiarly charming sidelong look, if I might make so free with  her--would have been called attention to. It's a perfectly beautiful  look, the sort of look some great artist would have loved to make  immortal. It's a look I shall find it hard to forget.... But she doesn't  seem to be aware in the least of it. In America she would be aware of  it. She would be distinctly aware of it. She would have been _made_  aware of it. She would have been advised of it. It would be looked for  and she would know it was looked for. She would _give_ it as a singer  gives her most popular song. Mamie Nelson, for example, used to give a  peculiar little throw back of the chin and a laugh.... It was talked  about. People came to see it....    \"Of course Mamie Nelson was a very brilliant girl indeed. I suppose in  England you would say we spoilt her. I suppose we did spoil her....\"    It came into Mr. Direck's head that for a whole day he had scarcely  given a thought to Mamie Nelson. And now he was thinking of her--calmly.  Why shouldn't one think of Mamie Nelson calmly?    She was a proud imperious thing. There was something Southern in her.  Very dark blue eyes she had, much darker than Miss Corner's....    But how tortuous she had been behind that outward pride of hers! For  four years she had let him think he was the only man who really mattered  in the world, and all the time quite clearly and definitely she had  deceived him. She had made a fool of him and she had made a fool of the  others perhaps--just to have her retinue and play the queen in her  world. And at last humiliation, bitter humiliation, and Mamie with her  chin in the air and her bright triumphant smile looking down on him.    Hadn't he, she asked, had the privilege of loving her?    She took herself at the value they had set upon her.    Well--somehow--that wasn't right....    All the way across the Atlantic Mr. Direck had been trying to forget her  downward glance with the chin up, during that last encounter--and other  aspects of the same humiliation. The years he had spent upon her! The  time! Always relying upon her assurance of a special preference for him.  He tried to think he was"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/14070"],[0,"English Grammar in Familiar Lectures (#13)"],[1,"erson_, as well as in number; that is, the verb  must be spelled and spoken in such a manner as to correspond with the  _first, second_, or _third_ person of the noun or pronoun which is its  nominative.    I will now show you how the verb is varied in order to agree with its  nominative in number and person. I, Thou, He, She, It; We, Ye or You,  They, are _personal pronouns_. _I_ is of the _first_ person, and  _singular_ number; _Thou_ is _second_ person, _sing._; _He, She_, or  _It_, is _third_ per. _sing._; _We_ is _first_ per. _plural_; _Ye_ or  _You_ is _second_ per. _plural_; _They_ is _third_ per. _plural_. These  pronouns are the representatives of nouns, and perform the same office  that the nouns would for which they stand. When placed before the verb,  they are, therefore, the _nominatives_ to the verb.    Notice particularly, the different variations or endings of the verb, as  it is thus conjugated in the INDICATIVE MOOD, PRESENT TENSE.       _Singular_.                           _Plural_.    1. _Per_. I walk,                     1. _Per_. We Walk,  2. _Per_. Thou walk_est_,             2. _Per_. Ye _or_ you walk,  3. _Per_. He walk_s_, _or_            3. _Per_. They walk, or                 the boy walk_s_,                      the boys walk.                 _or_ walk_eth_.    This display of the verb shows you, that whenever it ends in _est_, it  is of the _second_ person _singular_; but when the verb ends in _s_, or  _eth_, it is of the _third_ person singular. _Walkest, ridest,  standest_, are of the second person singular; and _walks_ or _walketh,  rides_ or _rideth, stands_ or _standeth_, are of the third person  singular.    I have told you, that when the nominative is singular number, the verb  must be; when the nominative is plural, the verb must be; and when the  nominative is first, second, or third person, the verb must be of the  same person. If you look again at the foregoing conjugation of _walk_,  you will notice that the verb varies if its endings in the _singular_,  in order to agree in _form_ with the first, second, and third person of  its nominative; but in the _plural_ it does not vary its endings from  the first person singular. The verb, however, agrees in _sense_ with its  nominative in the plural, as well as in the singular. Exercise a little  mind, and you will perceive that _agreement_ and _government_ in  language do not consist _merely_ in the _form_ of words. Now, is it not  clear, that when I say, I _walk_, the verb walk is _singular_, because  it expresses but _one_ action? And when I say, Two men _walk_, is it not  equally apparent, that walk is _plural_, because it expresses _two_  actions? In the sentence, Ten men _walk_, the verb _walk_ denotes _ten_  actions, for there are ten actors. Common sense teaches you, that there  must be as many _actions_ as there are _actors_; and that the verb, when  it has _no form_ or _ending_ to show it, is as strictly plural, as when  it has.--So, in the phrase, _We_ walk, the verb walk is _first_ person,  because it expresses the actions performed by the _speakers: Ye_ or  _you_ walk, the verb is _second_ person, denoting the actions of the  persons _spoken to;_ third person, _They_ walk. The verb, then, when  correctly written, always agrees, in _sense_, with its nominative in  number and person.    At present you are learning two parts of speech, neither of which can be  understood without a knowledge of the other. It therefore becomes  necessary to explain them both, in the same lecture. You have been  already informed, that nouns have three cases; the nominative, the  possessive, and the objective.    POSSESSIVE CASE. The _possessive case_ denotes the possessor of  something; as, This is _John's_ horse. This expression implies, that  _John_ is the _owner_ or _possessor_ of the horse; and, that horse is  the _property_ which he possesses.    When I say, These are the _men's_, and those, the _boys'_ hats, the two  words, \"boys' hats,\" plainly convey the idea, if they have any meaning  at all, that the boys _own_ or _possess_ the hats. \"Samuel Badger sells  _boys'_ hats.\" Who _owns_ the hats? Mr. Badger. How is that fact  ascertained? Not by the words, \"boys' hats,\" which, taken by themselves,  imply, not that they are _Mr. Badger's_ hats, nor that they are _for_  boys, but that they are hats _of_, or _belonging to_, or _possessed by_  boys. But we _infer_ from the _words connected_ with the phrase, \"boys'  hats,\" that the boys are not yet, as the phrase literally denotes, in  the actual possession of the hats. The possession is anticipated.    In the phrases, _fine_ hats, _coarse_ hats, _high-crowned_ hats,  _broad-brimmed_ hats, _woollen, new, ten, some, these, many_ hats, the  words in italics, are adjectives, because they restrict, qualify, or  define the term _hats;_ but the term _boys'_ does not _describe_ or  limit the meaning of _hats. Boys'_, therefore, is not, as some suppose,  an adjective.    \"The _slave's_ master.\" Does the slave possess the master? Yes. The  slave _has_ a master. If he _has_ him, then, he _possesses_ him;--he  sustains that relation to him which we call possession.    A noun in the possessive case, is always known by its having an  apostrophe, and generally an _s_ after it; thus, _John's_, hat; the  _boy's_ coat. When a plural noun in the possessive case, ends in _s_,  the apostrophe is added, but no additional _s_; as, \"_Boys'_ hats;  _Eagles'_ wings.\" When a singular noun ends in _ss_, the apostrophe  only is added; as, \"For _goodness'_ sake; for _righteousness'_ sake;\"  except the word witness; as, \"The _witness's_ testimony.\" When a noun in  the possessive case ends in _ence_, the _s_ is omitted, but the  apostrophe is retained; as, \"For _conscience'_ sake.\"    Now please to turn back, and read over this and the preceding lecture  _three_ times, and endeavor, not only to understand, but, also, to  _remember_, what you read. In reading, proceed thus: read one sentence  over slowly, and then look off the book, and repeat it two or three  times over in your mind. After that, take another sentence and proceed  in the same manner, and so on through the whole lecture. Do not presume  to think, that these directions are of no real consequence to you; for,  unless you follow them strictly, you need not expect to make rapid  progress. On the other hand, if you proceed according to my  instructions, you will be sure to acquire a practical knowledge of  grammar in a short time.--When you shall have complied with this  requisition, you may commit the following _order of parsing a noun_, and  _the order of parsing a verb_; and then you will be prepared to parse or  analyze the following examples.    ANALYSIS, OR PARSING.    Do you recollect the meaning of the word _analysis?_ If you do not, I  will explain if: and first, I wish you to remember, that analysis is the  reverse of synthesis. _Synthesis_ is the act of combining simples so as  to form a whole or compound. Thus, in putting together letters so as to  form syllables, syllables so as to form words, words so as to form  sentences, and sentences so as to form a discourse, the process is  called synthetic. _Analysis_, on the contrary, is the act of  decomposition; that is, the act of separating any thing compounded into  its simple parts, and thereby exhibiting its elementary principles.  Etymology treats of the analysis of language. To analyze a sentence, is  to separate from one another and classify the different words of which  it is composed; and to analyze or _parse_ a word, means to enumerate and  describe all its various properties, and its grammatical relations with  respect to other words in a sentence, and trace it through all its  inflections or changes. Perhaps, to you, this will, at first, appear to  be of little importance; but, if you persevere, you will hereafter find  it of great utility, for parsing will enable you to detect, and correct,  errors in composition.    SYSTEMATIC ORDER OF PARSING.    The _order of parsing_ a NOUN, is--a noun, and why?--common, proper, or  collective, and why?--gender, and why?--person, and why?--number, and  why?--case, and why?--RULE:--decline it.    _The order of parsing_ a VERB, is--a verb, and why?--active, passive,  or neuter, and why?--if _active_--transitive or intransitive, and  why?--if _passive_--how is it formed?--regular, irregular, or defective,  and why?--mood, and why?--tense, and why?--person and number, and  why?--with what does it agree?--RULE:--conjugate it.    I will now parse two nouns according to the order, and, in so doing, by  applying the definitions and rules, I shall answer all those questions  given in the order. If you have _perfectly committed_ the order of  parsing a noun and verb, you may proceed with me; but, recollect, you  cannot parse a verb _in full_, until you shall have had a more complete  explanation of it.        _John's hand trembles_.    _John's_ is a noun, [because it is] the name of a person--proper, the  name of an individual--masculine gender, it denotes a male--third  person, spoken of--singular number, it implies but one--and in the  possessive case, it denotes possession--it is governed by the noun  \"hand,\" according to    RULE 12. _A noun or pronoun in the possessive case, is governed by the  noun it possesses_.    Declined--Sing. nom. John, poss. John's, obj. John. Plural--nom.  Johns, poss. Johns', obj. Johns.    _Hand_ is a noun, the name of a thing--common, the name of a sort or  species of things--neuter gender, it denotes a thing without sex--third  person, spoken of--sing. number, it implies but one--and in the  nominative case, it is the actor and subject of the verb \"trembles,\" and  governs it agreeably to    RULE 3. _The nominative case governs the verb:_--that is, the nominative  determines the number and person of the verb.    Declined--Sing. nom. hand, poss. hand's, obj. hand. Plur. nom. hands,  poss. hands', obj. hands.    _Trembles_ is "]]]
