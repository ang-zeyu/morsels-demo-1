He struck his nose--and it bled--\"    \"Come,\" interrupted Mrs. Haldean, \"let us go,\" and she rushed from the  room, leaving me to follow.    I lifted Miss Haldean, who was half fainting with fatigue and agitation,  on to the sofa, and, whispering a few words of encouragement into her  ear, turned to Mrs. Hanshaw.    \"I can't stay with Mrs. Haldean,\" I said. \"There are two visits to be  made at Rebworth. Will you send the dogcart up the road with somebody to  take my place?\"    \"Yes,\" she answered. \"I will send Giles, or come myself if Lucy is fit  to be left.\"    I ran to the stables for my bicycle, and as I pedalled out into the road  I could see Mrs. Haldean already far ahead, driving her machine at  frantic speed. I followed at a rapid pace, but it was not until we  approached the commencement of the wood, when she slowed down somewhat,  that I overtook her.    \"This is the place,\" I said, as we reached the spot where I had parted  from Miss Haldean. We dismounted and wheeled our bicycles through the  gate, and laying them down beside the hedge, crossed the meadow and  entered the wood.    It was a terrible experience, and one that I shall never forget--the  white-faced, distracted woman, tramping in her flimsy house-shoes over  the rough ground, bursting through the bushes, regardless of the thorny  branches that dragged at skin and hair and dainty clothing, and sending  forth from time to time a tremulous cry, so dreadfully pathetic in its  mingling of terror and coaxing softness, that a lump rose in my throat,  and I could barely keep my self-control.    \"Freddy! Freddy-boy! Mummy's here, darling!\" The wailing cry sounded  through the leafy solitude; but no answer came save the whirr of wings  or the chatter of startled birds. But even more shocking than that  terrible cry--more disturbing and eloquent with dreadful suggestion--was  the way in which she peered, furtively, but with fearful expectation,  among the roots of the bushes, or halted to gaze upon every molehill and  hummock, every depression or disturbance of the ground.    So we stumbled on for a while, with never a word spoken, until we came  to a beaten track or footpath leading across the wood. Here I paused to  examine the footprints, of which several were visible in the soft earth,  though none seemed very recent; but, proceeding a little way down the  track, I perceived, crossing it, a set of fresh imprints, which I  recognized at once as Miss Haldean's. She was wearing, as I knew, a pair  of brown golf-boots, with rubber pads in the leather soles, and the  prints made by them were unmistakable.    \"Miss Haldean crossed the path here,\" I said, pointing to the  footprints.    \"Don't speak of her before me!\" exclaimed Mrs. Haldean; but she gazed  eagerly at the footprints, nevertheless, and immediately plunged into  the wood to follow the tracks.    \"You are very unjust to your niece, Mrs. Haldean,\" I ventured to  protest.    She halted, and faced me with an angry frown.    \"You don't understand!\" she exclaimed. \"You don't know, perhaps, that  if my poor child is really dead, Lucy Haldean will be a rich woman, and  may marry to-morrow if she chooses?\"    \"I did not know that,\" I answered, \"but if I had, I should have said the  same.\"    \"Of course you would,\" she retorted bitterly. \"A pretty face can muddle  any man's judgment.\"    She turned away abruptly to resume her pursuit, and I followed in  silence. The trail which we were following zigzagged through the  thickest part of the wood, but its devious windings eventually brought  us out on to an open space on the farther side. Here we at once  perceived traces of another kind. A litter of dirty rags, pieces of  paper, scraps of stale bread, bones and feathers, with hoof-marks, wheel  ruts, and the ashes of a large wood fire, pointed clearly to a gipsy  encampment recently broken up. I laid my hand on the heap of ashes, and  found it still warm, and on scattering it with my foot a layer of  glowing cinders appeared at the bottom.    \"These people have only been gone an hour or two,\" I said. \"It would be  well to have them followed without delay.\"    A gleam of hope shone on the drawn, white face as the bereaved mother  caught eagerly at my suggestion.    \"Yes,\" she exclaimed breathlessly; \"she may have bribed them to take him  away. Let us see which way they went.\"    We followed the wheel tracks down to the road, and found that they  turned towards London. At the same time I perceived the dogcart in the  distance, with Mrs. Hanshaw standing beside it; and, as the coachman  observed me, he whipped up his horse and approached.    \"I shall have to go,\" I said, \"but Mrs. Hanshaw will help you to  continue the search.\"    \"And you will make inquiries about the gipsies, won't you?\" she said.    I promised to do so, and as the dogcart now came up, I climbed to the  seat, and drove off briskly up the London Road.    The extent of a country doctor's round is always an unknown quantity. On  the present occasion I picked up three additional patients, and as one  of them was a case of incipient pleurisy, which required to have the  chest strapped, and another was a neglected dislocation of the shoulder,  a great deal of time was taken up. Moreover, the gipsies, whom I ran to  earth on Rebworth Common, delayed me considerably, though I had to leave  the rural constable to carry out the actual search, and, as a result,  the clock of Burling Church was striking six as I drove through the  village on my way home.    I got down at the front gate, leaving the coachman to take the dogcart  round, and walked up the drive; and my astonishment may be imagined  when, on turning the corner, I came suddenly upon the inspector of the  local police in earnest conversation with no less a person than John  Thorndyke.    \"What on earth has brought you here?\" I exclaimed, my surprise getting  the better of my manners.    \"The ultimate motive-force,\" he replied, \"was an impulsive lady named  Mrs. Haldean. She telegraphed for me--in your name.\"    \"She oughtn't to have done that,\" I said.    \"Perhaps not. But the ethics of an agitated woman are not worth  discussing, and she has done something much worse--she has applied to  the local J.P. (a retired Major-General), and our gallant and unlearned  friend has issued a warrant for the arrest of Lucy Haldean on the charge  of murder.\"    \"But there has been no murder!\" I exclaimed.    \"That,\" said Thorndyke, \"is a legal subtlety that he does not  appreciate. He has learned his law in the orderly-room, where the  qualifications to practise are an irritable temper and a loud voice.  However, the practical point is, inspector, that the warrant is  irregular. You can't arrest people for hypothetical crimes.\"    The officer drew a deep breath of relief. He knew all about the  irregularity, and now joyfully took refuge behind Thorndyke's great  reputation.    When he had departed--with a brief note from my colleague to the  General--Thorndyke slipped his arm through mine, and we strolled towards  the house.    \"This is a grim business, Jervis,\" said he. \"That boy has got to be  found for everybody's sake. Can you come with me when you have had some  food?\"    \"Of course I can. I have been saving myself all the afternoon with a  view to continuing the search.\"    \"Good,\" said Thorndyke. \"Then come in and feed.\"    A nondescript meal, half tea and half dinner, was already prepared, and  Mrs. Hanshaw, grave but self-possessed, presided at the table.    \"Mabel is still out with Giles, searching for the boy,\" she said. \"You  have heard what she has done!\"    I nodded.    \"It was dreadful of her,\" continued Mrs. Hanshaw, \"but she is half mad,  poor thing. You might run up and say a few kind words to poor Lucy while  I make the tea.\"    I went up at once and knocked at Miss Haldean's door, and, being bidden  to enter, found her lying on the sofa, red-eyed and pale, the very ghost  of the merry, laughing girl who had gone out with me in the morning. I  drew up a chair, and sat down by her side, and as I took the hand she  held out to me, she said:    \"It is good of you to come and see a miserable wretch like me. And Jane  has been so sweet to me, Dr. Jervis; but Aunt Mabel thinks I have killed  Freddy--you know she does--and it was really my fault that he was lost.  I shall never forgive myself!\"    She burst into a passion of sobbing, and I proceeded to chide her  gently.    \"You are a silly little woman,\" I said, \"to take this nonsense to heart  as you are doing. Your aunt is not responsible just now, as you must  know; but when we bring the boy home she shall make you a handsome  apology. I will see to that.\"    She pressed my hand gratefully, and as the bell now rang for tea, I bade  her have courage and went downstairs.    \"You need not trouble about the practice,\" said Mrs. Hanshaw, as I  concluded my lightning repast, and Thorndyke went off to get our  bicycles. \"Dr. Symons has heard of our trouble, and has called to say  that he will take anything that turns up; so we shall expect you when we  see you.\"    \"How do you like Thorndyke?\" I asked.    \"He is quite charming,\" she replied enthusiastically; \"so tactful and  kind, and so handsome, too. You didn't tell us that. But here he is.  Good-bye, and good luck.\"    She pressed my hand, and I went out into the drive, where Thorndyke and  the coachman were standing with three bicycles.    \"I see you have brought your outfit,\" I said as we turned into the road;  for Thorndyke's machine bore a large canvas-covered case strapped on to  a strong bracket.    \"Yes; there are many things that we may want on a quest of this kind.  How did you find Miss Haldean?\"    \"Very miserable, poor girl. By the way, have you heard anything about  her pecuniary interest in the child's death?\"    \"Yes,\" said Thorndyke. \"It appears that the late Mr. Haldean used up all  his brains on his business, and had none left for the making of his  will--as"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/13888"],[0,"Bacon (#13)"],[1,"own greatness, the more I will think       of it._'         \"He replied, '_I think scorn to stand upon terms of greatness       towards you, who are less than little; less than the least;_' and       other such strange light terms he gave me, with that insulting       which cannot be expressed.         \"Herewith stirred, yet I said no more but this: '_Mr. Attorney, do       not depress me so far; for I have been your better, and may be       again, when it please the Queen._'         \"With this he spake, neither I nor himself could tell what, as if       he had been born Attorney-General; and in the end bade me not       meddle with the Queen's business, but with mine own; and that I was       unsworn, etc. I told him, sworn or unsworn was all one to an honest       man; and that I ever set my service first, and myself second; and       wished to God that he would do the like.         \"Then he said, it were good to clap a _cap. ultegatum_ upon my       back! To which I only said he could not; and that he was at fault,       for he hunted upon an old scent. He gave me a number of disgraceful       words besides, which I answered with silence, and showing that I       was not moved with them.\"    The threat of the _capias ultegatum_ was probably in reference to the  arrest of Bacon for debt in September, 1593. After this we are not  surprised at Bacon writing to Coke, \"who take to yourself a liberty to  disgrace and disable my law, my experience, my discretion,\" that, \"since  I missed the Solicitor's place (the rather I think by your means) I  cannot expect that you and I shall ever serve as Attorney and Solicitor  together, but either serve with another on your remove, or step into  some other course.\" And Coke, no doubt, took care that it should be so.  Cecil, too, may possibly have thought that Bacon gave no proof of his  fitness for affairs in thus bringing before him a squabble in which both  parties lost their tempers.    Bacon was not behind the rest of the world in \"the posting of men of  good quality towards the King,\" in the rash which followed the Queen's  death, of those who were eager to proffer their services to James, for  whose peaceful accession Cecil had so skilfully prepared the way. He  wrote to every one who, he thought, could help him: to Cecil, and to  Cecil's man--\"I pray you, as you find time let him know that he is the  personage in the State which I love most;\" to Northumberland, \"If I may  be of any use to your Lordship, by my head, tongue, pen, means, or  friends, I humbly pray you to hold me your own;\" to the King's Scotch  friends and servants, even to Southampton, the friend of Essex, who had  been shut up in the Tower since his condemnation with Essex, and who was  now released. \"This great change,\" Bacon assured him, \"hath wrought in  me no other change towards your Lordship than this, that I may safely be  now that which I truly was before.\" Bacon found in after years that  Southampton was not so easily conciliated. But at present Bacon was  hopeful: \"In mine own particular,\" he writes, \"I have many comforts and  assurances; but in mine own opinion the chief is, that the _canvassing  world is gone, and the deserving world is come_.\" He asks to be  recommended to the King--\"I commend myself to your love and to the  well-using of my name, as well in repressing and answering for me, if  there be any biting or nibbling at it in that place, as in impressing a  good conceit and opinion of me, chiefly in the King, as otherwise in  that Court.\" His pen had been used under the government of the Queen,  and he had offered a draft of a proclamation to the King's advisers. But  though he obtained an interview with the King, James's arrival in  England brought no immediate prospect of improvement in Bacon's  fortunes. Indeed, his name was at first inadvertently passed over in the  list of Queen's servants who were to retain their places. The first  thing we hear of is his arrest a second time for debt; and his letters  of thanks to Cecil, who had rendered him assistance, are written in deep  depression.         \"For my purpose or course I desire to meddle as little as I can in       the King's causes, his Majesty now abounding in counsel, and to       follow my private thrift and practice, and to marry with some       convenient advancement. For as for any ambition, I do assure your       Honour, mine is quenched. In the Queen's, my excellent Mistress's,       time the _quorum_ was small: her service was a kind of freehold,       and it was a more solemn time. All those points agreed with my       nature and judgment. My ambition now I shall only put upon my pen,       whereby I shall be able to maintain memory and merit of the times       succeeding.         \"Lastly, for this divulged and almost prostituted title of       knighthood, I could without charge, by your Honour's mean, be       content to have it, both because of this late disgrace and because       I have three new knights in my mess in Gray's Inn's commons; and       because I have found out an alderman's daughter, an handsome       maiden, to my liking.\"    Cecil, however, seems to have required that the money should be repaid  by the day; and Bacon only makes a humble request, which, it might be  supposed, could have been easily granted.         \"IT MAY PLEASE YOUR GOOD LORDSHIP,--In answer of your last       letter, your money shall be ready before your day: principal,       interest, and costs of suit. So the sheriff promised, when I       released errors; and a Jew takes no more. The rest cannot be       forgotten, for I cannot forget your Lordship's _dum memor ipse       mei_; and if there have been _aliquid nimis_, it shall be amended.       And, to be plain with your Lordship, that will quicken me now which       slackened me before. Then I thought you might have had more use of       me than now I suppose you are like to have. Not but I think the       impediment will be rather in my mind than in the matter or times.       But to do you service I will come out of my religion at any time.         \"For my knighthood, I wish the manner might be such as might grace       me, since the matter will not; I mean, that I might not be merely       gregarious in a troop. The coronation is at hand. It may please       your Lordship to let me hear from you speedily. So I continue your       Lordship's ever much bounden,         \"FR. BACON.       \"From Gorhambury, this 16th of July, 1603.\"    But it was not done. He \"obtained his title, but not in a manner to  distinguish him. He was knighted at Whitehall two days before the  coronation, but had to share the honour with 300 others.\"    It was not quite true that his \"ambition was quenched.\" For the rest of  Cecil's life Cecil was the first man at James's Court; and to the last  there was one thing that Bacon would not appear to believe--he did not  choose to believe that it was Cecil who kept him back from employment  and honour. To the last he persisted in assuming that Cecil was the  person who would help, if he could, a kinsman devoted to his interests  and profoundly conscious of his worth. To the last he commended his  cause to Cecil in terms of unstinted affection and confiding hope. It is  difficult to judge of the sincerity of such language. The mere customary  language of compliment employed by every one at this time was of a kind  which to us sounds intolerable. It seems as if nothing that ingenuity  could devise was too extravagant for an honest man to use, and for a man  who respected himself to accept. It must not, indeed, be forgotten that  conventionalities, as well as insincerity, differ in their forms in  different times; and that insincerity may lurk behind frank and clear  words, when they are the fashion, as much as in what is like mere  fulsome adulation. But words mean something, in spite of forms and  fashions. When a man of great genius writes his private letters, we wish  generally to believe on the whole what he says; and there are no limits  to the esteem, the honour, the confidence, which Bacon continued to the  end to express towards Cecil. Bacon appeared to trust him--appeared, in  spite of continued disappointments, to rely on his good-will and good  offices. But for one reason or another Bacon still remained in the  shade. He was left to employ his time as he would, and to work his way  by himself.    He was not idle. He prepared papers which he meant should come before  the King, on the pressing subjects of the day. The Hampton Court  conference between the Bishops and the Puritan leaders was at hand, and  he drew up a moderating paper on the _Pacification of the Church_. The  feeling against him for his conduct towards Essex had not died away, and  he addressed to Lord Mountjoy that _Apology concerning the Earl of  Essex_, so full of interest, so skilfully and forcibly written, so vivid  a picture of the Queen's ways with her servants, which has every merit  except that of clearing Bacon from the charge of disloyalty to his best  friend. The various questions arising out of the relations of the two  kingdoms, now united under James, were presenting themselves. They were  not of easy solution, and great mischief would follow if they were  solved wrongly. Bacon turned his attention to them. He addressed a  discourse to the King on the union of the two kingdoms, the first of a  series of discussions on the subject which Bacon made peculiarly his  own, and which, no doubt, first drew the King's attention and favour to  him.    But for the first year of James's reign he was unnoticed by the King,  and he was able to give his attention more freely to the great thought  and hope of his life. This time of neglect gave him the opportunity of  leisurely calling together and examining the ideas which had long had  hold of his mind about the state of human knowledge, about the  possibilities of extending it, about the hopes and powers which that new"]]]
