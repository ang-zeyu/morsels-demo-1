I presume his  nationality is Persian, but I can't be sure of it. He periodically turns  up in the various big capitals when international loans and that sort of  thing are being negotiated. I understand that he has a flat somewhere  in Paris, and the Service de Surete tells me that his name is good for  several million francs over there. He appears to have a certain fondness  for London during the spring and early summer months, and I am told he  has a fine place in Surrey. He is at present living at Savoy Court.  He appears to be something of a dandy and to be very partial  to the fair sex, but nevertheless there is nothing wrong with  his reputation,considering, I mean, that the man is a sort of  Eastern multimillionaire.\"    \"Ah!\" said Harley, who had been listening eagerly. \"Is that the extent  of your information, Wessex?\"    \"That's it,\" replied Wessex, with a laugh. \"I hope you'll find it  useful, but I doubt it. He hasn't been picking pockets or anything, has  he?\"    \"No,\" said Harley, shortly. \"I don't apprehend that his excellency will  ever appear in your province, Wessex. My interest in him is of a purely  personal nature. Thanks for all the trouble you have taken.\"    Paul Harley began to pace the office. From a professional point of view  the information was uninteresting enough, but from another point of  view it had awakened again that impotent anger which he had too often  experienced in these recent, strangely restless days.    At all costs he must see Ormuz Khan, although how he was to obtain  access to this man who apparently never left his private apartments (if  the day of his vigil at the Savoy had been a typical one) he failed to  imagine.    Nevertheless, pausing at the table, he again took up his pencil, and  to the note \"Obtain interview with Ormuz Khan\" he added the one word,  underlined:    \"To-morrow.\"        CHAPTER X. HIS EXCELLENCY ORMUZ KHAN    The city clocks were chiming the hour of ten on the following morning  when a page from the Savoy approached the shop of Mr. Jarvis, bootmaker,  which is situated at no great distance from the hotel. The impudent face  of the small boy wore an expression of serio-comic fright as he pushed  open the door and entered the shop.    Jarvis, the bootmaker, belonged to a rapidly disappearing class of  British tradesmen. He buckled to no one, but took an artistic pride in  his own handiwork, criticism from a layman merely provoking a scornful  anger which had lost Jarvis many good customers.    He was engaged, at the moment of the page's entrance, in a little  fitting room at the back of his cramped premises, but through the  doorway the boy could see the red, bespectacled face with its fringe of  bristling white beard, in which he detected all the tokens of brewing  storm. He whistled softly in self-sympathy.    \"Yes, sir,\" Jarvis was saying to an invisible patron, \"it's a welcome  sight to see a real Englishman walk into my shop nowadays. London isn't  London, sir, since the war, and the Strand will never be the Strand  again.\" He turned to his assistant, who stood beside him, bootjack in  hand. \"If he sends them back again,\" he directed, \"tell him to go to  one of the French firms in Regent Street who cater to dainty ladies.\" He  positively snorted with indignation, while the page, listening, whistled  again and looked down at the parcel which he carried.    \"An unwelcome customer, Jarvis?\" inquired the voice of the man in the  fitting room.    \"Quite unwelcome,\" said Jarvis. \"I don't want him. I have more work than  I know how to turn out. I wish he would go elsewhere. I wish--\"    He paused. He had seen the page boy. The latter, having undone his  parcel, was holding out a pair of elegant, fawn-coloured shoes.    \"Great Moses!\" breathed Jarvis. \"He's had the cheek to send them back  again!\"    \"His excellency--\" began the page, when Jarvis snatched the shoes from  his hand and hurled them to the other end of the shop. His white beard  positively bristled.    \"Tell his excellency,\" he shouted, \"to go to the devil, with my  compliments!\"    So positively ferocious was his aspect that the boy, with upraised arm,  backed hastily out into the street. Safety won: \"Blimey!\" exclaimed the  youth. \"He's the warm goods, he is!\"    He paused for several moments, staring in a kind of stupefied admiration  at the closed door of Mr. Jarvis's establishment. He whistled again,  softly, and then began to run--for the formidable Mr. Jarvis suddenly  opened the door. \"Hi, boy!\" he called to the page. The page hesitated,  glancing back doubtfully. \"Tell his excellency that I will send round in  about half an hour to remeasure his foot.\"    \"D'you mean it?\" inquired the boy, impudently--\"or is there a catch in  it?\"    \"I'll tan your hide, my lad!\" cried the bootmaker--\"and I mean that!  Take my message and keep your mouth shut.\"    The boy departed, grinning, and little more than half an hour later a  respectable-looking man presented himself at Savoy Court, inquiring of  the attendant near the elevator for the apartments of \"his excellency,\"  followed by an unintelligible word which presumably represented \"Ormuz  Khan.\" The visitor wore a well-brushed but threadbare tweed suit,  although his soft collar was by no means clean. He had a short,  reddish-brown beard, and very thick, curling hair of the same hue  protruded from beneath a bowler hat which had seen long service.    Like Mr. Jarvis, he was bespectacled, and his teeth were much  discoloured and apparently broken in front, as is usual with cobblers.  His hands, too, were toil-stained and his nails very black. He carried  a cardboard box. He seemed to be extremely nervous, and this nervousness  palpably increased when the impudent page, who was standing in the  lobby, giggled on hearing his inquiry.    \"He's second floor,\" said the youth. \"Are you from Hot-Stuff Jarvis?\"    \"That's right, lad,\" replied the visitor, speaking with a marked  Manchester accent; \"from Mr. Jarvis.\"    \"And are you really going up?\" inquired the boy with mock solicitude.    \"I'm going up right enough. That's what I'm here for.\"    \"Shut up, Chivers,\" snapped the hall porter. \"Ring the bell.\" He glanced  at the cobbler. \"Second floor,\" he said, tersely, and resumed his study  of a newspaper which he had been reading.    The representative of Mr. Jarvis was carried up to the second floor and  the lift man, having indicated at which door he should knock, descended  again. The cobbler's nervousness thereupon became more marked than ever,  so that a waiter, seeing him looking helplessly from door to door, took  pity on him and inquired for whom he was searching.    \"His excellency,\" was the reply; \"but I'm hanged if I can remember the  number or how to pronounce his name.\"    The waiter glanced at him oddly. \"Ormuz Khan,\" he said, and rang the  bell beside a door. As he hurried away, \"Good luck!\" he called back.    There was a short interval, and then the door was opened by a man  who looked like a Hindu. He wore correct morning dress and through  gold-rimmed pince-nez he stared inquiringly at the caller.    \"Is his excellency at home?\" asked the latter. \"I'm from Mr. Jarvis, the  bootmaker.\"    \"Oh!\" said the other, smiling slightly. \"Come in. What is your name?\"    \"Parker, sir. From Mr. Jarvis.\"    As the door closed, Parker found himself in a small lobby. Beside  an umbrella rack a high-backed chair was placed. \"Sit down,\" he was  directed. \"I will tell his excellency that you are here.\"    A door was opened and closed again, and Parker found himself alone. He  twirled his bowler hat, which he held in his hand, and stared about  the place vacantly. Once he began to whistle, but checked himself and  coughed nervously. Finally the Hindu gentleman reappeared, beckoning to  him to enter.    Parker stood up very quickly and advanced, hat in hand.    Then he remembered the box which he had left on the floor, and, stooping  to recover it, he dropped his hat. But at last, leaving his hat upon the  chair and carrying the box under his arm, he entered a room which had  been converted into a very businesslike office.    There was a typewriter upon a table near the window at which someone had  evidently been at work quite recently, and upon a larger table in the  centre of the room were dispatch boxes, neat parcels of documents,  ledgers, works of reference, and all the evidence of keen commercial  activity. Crossing the room, the Hindu rapped upon an inner door, opened  it, and standing aside, \"The man from the bootmaker,\" he said in a low  voice.    Parker advanced, peering about him as one unfamiliar with his  surroundings. As he crossed the threshold the door was closed behind  him, and he found himself in a superheated atmosphere heavy with the  perfume of hyacinths.    The place was furnished as a sitting room, but some of its appointments  were obviously importations. Its keynote was orientalism, not of that  sensuous yet grossly masculine character which surrounds the wealthy  Eastern esthete but quite markedly feminine. There were an extraordinary  number of cushions, and many bowls and vases containing hyacinths. What  other strange appointments were present Parker was far too nervous to  observe.    He stood dumbly before a man who lolled back in a deep, cushioned chair  and whose almond-shaped eyes, black as night, were set immovably upon  him. This man was apparently young. He wore a rich, brocaded robe,  trimmed with marten fur, and out of it his long ivory throat rose  statuesquely. His complexion was likewise of this uniform ivory colour,  and from his low smooth brow his hair was brushed back in a series of  glossy black waves.    His lips were full and very red. As a woman he might have been  considered handsome--even beautiful; in a man this beauty was unnatural  and repellent. He wore Oriental slippers, fur-lined, and his feet rested  on a small"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/11602"],[0,"The World of Ice (#13)"],[1," halo were situated the mock-suns, which were four in  number--one above and one below the sun, and one on each side of him.    Not a breath of wind stirred the little flag that drooped from the  mizzen-peak, and the clamorous, ceaseless-cries of sea-birds, added to  the merry shouts and laughter of the men as they followed the restless  football, rendered the whole a scene of life, as it was emphatically one  of beauty.    \"Ain't it glorious?\" panted Davie Summers vehemently as he stopped  exhausted in a headlong race beside one of his comrades, while the ball  was kicked hopelessly beyond his reach by a comparatively fresh member  of the party.    \"Ah! then, it bates the owld country intirely, it does,\" replied  O'Riley, wiping the perspiration from his forehead.    It is needless to say that O'Riley was an Irishman. We have not  mentioned him until now, because up to this time he had not done  anything to distinguish himself beyond his messmates; but on this  particular day O'Riley's star was in the ascendant, and fortune seemed  to have singled him out as an object of her special attention. He was a  short man, and a broad man, and a particularly _rugged_ man--so to  speak. He was all angles and corners. His hair stuck about his head in  violently rigid and entangled tufts, rendering it a matter of wonder how  anything in the shape of a hat could stick on. His brow was a countless  mass of ever-varying wrinkles, which gave to his sly visage an aspect of  humorous anxiety that was highly diverting--and all the more diverting  when you came to know that the man had not a spark of anxiety in his  composition, though he often said he had. His dress, like that of most  Jack tars, was naturally rugged, and he contrived to make it more so  than usual.    \"An' it's hot, too, it is,\" he continued, applying his kerchief again to  his pate \"If it warn't for the ice we stand on, we'd be melted down, I  do belave, like bits o' whale blubber.\"    \"Wot a jolly game football is, ain't it?\" said Davie seating himself on  a hummock, and still panting hard.    \"Ay, boy, that's jist what it is. The only objiction I have agin it is,  that it makes ye a'most kick the left leg clane off yer body.\"    \"Why don't you kick with your right leg, then, stupid, like other  people?\" inquired Summers.    \"Why don't I, is it? Troth, then, I don't know for sartin. Me father  lost his left leg at the great battle o' the Nile, and I've sometimes  thought that had somethin' to do wid it. But then me mother was lame o'  the _right_ leg intirely, and wint about wid a crutch, so I can't make  out how it was, d'ye see?\"    \"Look out, Pat,\" exclaimed Summers, starting up, \"here comes the ball.\"    As he spoke, the football came skimming over the ice towards the spot on  which they stood, with about thirty of the men running at full speed and  shouting like maniacs after it.    \"That's your sort, my hearties! another like that and it's home! Pitch  into it, Mivins. You're the boy for me! Now then, Grim, trip him up!  Hallo! Buzzby, you bluff-bowed Dutchman, luff! luff! or I'll stave in  your ribs! Mind your eye, Mizzle! there's Green, he'll be into your  larboard quarter in no time. Hurrah! Mivins, up in the air with it.  Kick, boy, kick like a spanker-boom in a hurricane!\"    Such were a few of the expressions that showered like hail round the men  as they rushed hither and thither after the ball. And here we may remark  that the crew of the _Dolphin_ played football in a somewhat different  style from the way in which that noble game is played by boys in  England. Sides, indeed, were chosen, and boundaries were marked out, but  very little, if any, attention was paid to such secondary matters! To  kick the ball, and keep on kicking it in front of his companions, was  the ambition of each man; and so long as he could get a kick at it that  caused it to fly from the ground like a cannon-shot, little regard was  had by any one to the direction in which it was propelled. But, of  course, in this effort to get a kick, the men soon became scattered over  the field, and ever and anon the ball would fall between two men, who  rushed at it simultaneously from opposite directions. The inevitable  result was a collision, by which both men were suddenly and violently  arrested in their career. But generally the shock resulted in one of the  men being sent staggering backwards, and the other getting the _kick_.  When the two were pretty equally matched, both were usually, as they  expressed it, \"brought up all standing,\" in which case a short scuffle  ensued, as each endeavoured to trip up the heels of his adversary. To  prevent undue violence in such struggles, a rule was laid down that  hands were not to be used on any account. They might use their feet,  legs, shoulders, and elbows, but not their hands.    In such rough play the men were more equally matched than might have  been expected, for the want of weight among the smaller men was often  more than counterbalanced by their activity, and frequently a sturdy  little fellow launched himself so vigorously against a heavy tar as to  send him rolling head over heels on the ice. This was not always the  case, however, and few ventured to come into collision with Peter Grim,  whose activity was on a par with his immense size. Buzzby contented  himself with galloping on the outskirts of the fight, and putting in a  kick when fortune sent the ball in his way. In this species of warfare  he was supported by the fat cook, whose oily carcass could neither stand  the shocks nor keep up with the pace of his messmates. Mizzle was a  particularly energetic man in his way, however, and frequently kicked  with such goodwill that he missed the ball altogether, and the  tremendous swing of his leg lifted him from the ice and laid him  sprawling on his back.    \"Look out ahead!\" shouted Green, the carpenter's mate; \"there's a sail  bearing down on your larboard bow.\"    Mivins, who had the ball before him at the moment, saw his own  satellite, Davie, coming down towards him with vicious intentions. He  quietly pushed the ball before him for a few yards, then kicked it far  over the boy's head, and followed it up like an antelope. Mivins  depended for success on his almost superhuman activity. His tall, slight  frame could not stand the shocks of his comrades, but no one could equal  or come near to him in speed, and he was quite an adept at dodging a  _charge_, and allowing his opponent to rush far past the ball by the  force of his own momentum. Such a charge did Peter Grim make at him at  this moment.    \"Starboard hard!\" yelled Davie Summers, as he observed his master's  danger.    \"Starboard it is!\" replied Mivins, and leaping aside to avoid the shock,  he allowed Grim to pass. Grim knew his man, however, and had held  himself in hand, so that in a moment he pulled up and was following  close on his heels.    \"It's an ill wind that blows no good,\" cried one of the crew, towards  whose foot the ball rolled, as he quietly kicked it into the centre of  the mass of men. Grim and Mivins turned back, and for a time looked on  at the general _melee_ that ensued. It seemed as though the ball must  inevitably be crushed among them as they struggled and kicked hither and  thither for five minutes, in their vain efforts to get a kick; and  during those few exciting moments many tremendous kicks, aimed at the  ball, took effect upon shins, and many shouts of glee terminated in  yells of anguish.    \"It can't last much longer!\" screamed the cook, his face streaming with  perspiration and beaming with glee, as he danced round the outside of  the circle. \"There it goes!\"    As he spoke, the ball flew out of the circle like a shell from a mortar.  Unfortunately it went directly over Mizzle's head. Before he could wink  he went down before them, and the rushing mass of men passed over him  like a mountain torrent over a blade of grass.    Meanwhile Mivins ran ahead of the others, and gave the ball a kick that  nearly burst it, and down it came exactly between O'Riley and Grim, who  chanced to be far ahead of the others. Grim dashed at it. \"Och! ye big  villain,\" muttered the Irishman to himself, as he put down his head and  rushed against the carpenter like a battering-ram.    Big though he was, Grim staggered back from the impetuous shock, and  O'Riley following up his advantage, kicked the ball in a side direction,  away from every one except Buzzby, who happened to have been steering  rather wildly over the field of ice. Buzzby, on being brought thus  unexpectedly within reach of the ball, braced up his energies for a  kick; but seeing O'Riley coming down towards him like a runaway  locomotive, he pulled up, saying quietly to himself, \"Ye may take it all  yer own way, lad; I'm too old a bird to go for to make my carcass a  buffer for a madcap like you to run agin.\"    Jack Mivins, however, was troubled by no such qualms. He happened to be  about the same distance from the ball as O'Riley, and ran like a deer to  reach it first. A pool of water lay in his path, however, and the  necessity of going round it enabled the Irishman to gain on him a  little, so that it became evident that both would come up at the same  moment, and a collision be inevitable.    \"Hold yer wind, Paddy,\" shouted the men, who paused for a moment to  watch the result of the race. \"Mind your timbers, Mivins! Back your  top-sails, O'Riley; mind how he yaws!\"    Then there was a momentary silence of breathless expectation. The two  men seemed about to meet with a shock that would annihilate both, when  Mivins bounded to one side like an indiarubber ball. O'Riley shot past  him like a rocket, and the next instant went head foremost into the pool  of water.    This unexpected termination to the affair converted the intended huzzah  of the men into a yell of mingled laughter and consternation as they  hastened in a body to the spot; but before they reached it, O'Ri"]]]
