The religion, the  morality of a limited sphere of life, for instance that of a shepherd or  a peasant, in its intensive concentration and limitation to a few  perfectly simple relations of life has infinite worth--the same worth as  the religion and morality of extensive knowledge and of an existence  rich in the compass of its relations and actions. This inner focus, this  simple region of the claims of subjective freedom, the home of  volition, resolution, and action, the abstract sphere of  conscience--that which comprises the responsibility and moral value of  the individual--remains untouched and is quite shut out from the noisy  din of the world's history--including not merely external and temporal  changes but also those entailed by the absolute necessity inseparable  from the realization of the idea of freedom itself. But, as a general  truth, this must be regarded as settled, that whatever in the world  possesses claims as noble and glorious has nevertheless a higher  existence above it. The claim of the World-Spirit rises above all  special claims.    These observations may suffice in reference to the means which the  World-Spirit uses for realizing its Idea. Stated simply and abstractly,  this mediation involves the activity of personal existences in whom  Reason is present as their absolute, substantial being, but a basis, in  the first instance, still obscure and unknown to them. But the subject  becomes more complicated and difficult when we regard individuals not  merely in their aspect of activity, but more concretely, in conjunction  with a particular manifestation of that activity in their religion and  morality--forms of existence which are intimately connected with Reason  and share in its absolute claims. Here the relation of mere means to an  end disappears, and the chief bearings of this seeming difficulty in  reference to the absolute aim of Spirit have been briefly considered.    (3) The third point to be analyzed is, therefore: What is the object to  be realized by these means--that is, What is the form it assumes in the  realm of reality? We have spoken of means; but, in carrying out of a  subjective, limited aim, we have also to take into consideration the  element of a material either already present or which has to be  procured. Thus the question would arise: What is the material in which  the Ideal of Reason is wrought out? The primary answer would be:  Personality itself, human desires, subjectivity generally. In human  knowledge and volition as its material element Reason attains positive  existence. We have considered subjective volition where it has an object  which is the truth and essence of reality--viz., where it constitutes a  great world-historical passion. As a subjective will, occupied with  limited passions, it is dependent, and can gratify its desires only  within the limits of this dependence. But the subjective will has also a  substantial life, a reality, in which it moves in the region of  essential being and has the essential itself as the object of its  existence. This essential being is the union of the subjective with the  rational will; it is the moral whole, the _State_, which is that form of  reality in which the individual has and enjoys his freedom, but on the  condition of his recognizing, believing in, and willing that which is  common to the whole. And this must not be understood as if the  subjective will of the social unit attained its gratification and  enjoyment through that common will, as if this were a means provided for  its benefit, as if the individual, in his relations to other  individuals, thus limited his freedom, in order that this universal  limitation, the mutual constraint of all, might secure a small space of  liberty for each. Rather, we affirm, are law, morality, government, and  these alone, the positive reality and completion of freedom. Freedom of  a low and limited order is mere caprice, which finds its exercise in the  sphere of particular and limited desires.    Subjective volition, passion, is that which sets men in activity, that  which effects \"practical\" realization. The Idea is the inner spring of  action; the State is the actually existing, realized moral life. For it  is the unity of the universal, essential will, with that of the  individual; and this is \"morality.\" The individual living in this unity  has a moral life and possesses a value that consists in this  substantiality alone. Sophocles in his _Antigone_ says, \"The divine  commands are not of yesterday, nor of today; no, they have an infinite  existence, and no one could say whence they came.\" The laws of morality  are not accidental, but are the essentially rational. It is the very  object of the State that what is essential in the practical activity of  men and in their dispositions should be duly recognized; that it should  have a manifest existence and maintain its position. It is the absolute  interest of Reason that this moral whole should exist; and herein lies  the justification and merit of heroes who have founded States, however  rude these may have been. In the history of the world, only those  peoples can come under our notice which form a State; for it must be  understood that the State is the realization of freedom, i. e., of the  absolute final aim, and that it exists for its own sake. It must further  be understood that all the worth which the human being possesses--all  spiritual reality--he possesses only through the State. For his  spiritual reality consists in this, that his own essence, Reason, is  objectively present to him, that it possesses objective immediate  existence for him. Thus only is he fully conscious; thus only is he a  partaker of morality, of a just and moral social and political life. For  truth is the unity of the universal and subjective will; and the  universal is to be found in the State, in its laws, and in its universal  and rational arrangements. The State is the Divine Idea as it exists on  earth. We have in it, therefore, the object of history in a more  definite shape than before--that in which freedom obtains objectivity  and lives in the enjoyment of this objectivity. For law is the  objectivity of Spirit, volition in its true form. Only that will which  obeys law is free; for it obeys itself--it is independent and,  therefore, free. When the State or our country constitutes a community  of existence, when the subjective will of man submits to laws, the  contradiction between liberty and necessity vanishes. The rational has  necessary existence, as being the reality and substance of things, and  we are free in recognizing it as law and following it as the substance  of our own being. The objective and the subjective will are then  reconciled and present one identical homogeneous whole. For the  morality (_Sittlichkeit_) of the State is not of that ethical  (_moralische_) reflective kind, in which one's own conviction bears  sway; the latter is rather the peculiarity of the modern time, while the  true antique morality is based on the principle of abiding by one's duty  (to the State at large). An Athenian citizen did what was required of  him, as it were from instinct; but if I reflect on the object of my  activity I must have the consciousness that my will has been called into  exercise. But morality is duty--substantial right, a \"second nature,\" as  it has been justly called; for the first nature of man is his primary,  merely animal, existence.    The development _in extenso_ of the idea of the State belongs to the  philosophy of jurisprudence; but it must be observed that in the  theories of our time various errors are current respecting it, which  pass for established truths and have become fixed prejudices. We will  mention only a few of them, giving prominence to such as have a  reference to the object of our history.    The error which first meets us is the direct opposite of our principle  that the State presents the realization of freedom--the opinion--that  man is free by nature, but that in society, in the State, to which  nevertheless he is irresistibly impelled, he must limit this natural  freedom. That man is free by nature is quite correct in one sense,  namely, that he is so according to the idea of humanity; but we imply  thereby that he is such only in virtue of his destiny--that he has an  undeveloped power to become such; for the \"nature\" of an object is  exactly synonymous with its \"idea.\" But the view in question imports  more than this. When man is spoken of as \"free by nature,\" the mode of  his existence as well as his destiny is implied; his merely natural and  primary condition is intended. In this sense a \"state of nature\" is  assumed in which mankind at large is in the possession of its natural  rights with the unconstrained exercise and enjoyment of its freedom.  This assumption is not raised to the dignity of the historical fact; it  would indeed be difficult, were the attempt seriously made, to point  out any such condition as actually existing or as having ever occurred.  Examples of a savage state of life can be pointed out, but they are  marked by brutal passions and deeds of violence; while, however rude and  simple their, conditions, they involve social arrangements which, to use  the common phrase, \"restrain freedom.\" That assumption is one of those  nebulous images which theory produces, an idea which it cannot avoid  originating, but which it fathers upon real existence without sufficient  historical justification.    What we find such a state of nature to be, in actual experience, answers  exactly to the idea of a merely natural condition. Freedom as the ideal  of that which is original and natural does not exist as original and  natural; rather must it first be sought out and won, and that by an  incalculable medial discipline of the intellectual and moral powers. The  state of nature is, therefore,"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/12380"],[0,"Two Thousand Miles on an Automobile (#13)"],[1,"--the machine is being driven with the motor running fast.    With only two gears where roads or grades are such that the high  gear cannot be used, there is nothing to do but drop to the low,  --from thirty miles an hour to five or six,--and the engine runs as  if it had no load at all. American roads especially demand  intermediate gears if best results are to be attained, the  conditions change so from mile to mile.    Foreign machines are equipped with from three to five  speed-changing gears in addition to the spark control, and many  also have throttles for governing the speed of the engine.    Going at full speed down a long hill about two miles out of  Canandaigua, we discovered that neither power nor brakes had any  control over the machine. The large set-screws holding the two  halves of the rear-axle in the differential gears had worked loose  and the right half was steadily working out. As both brakes  operated through the differential, both were useless, and the  machine was beyond control. An obstacle or a bad turn at the  bottom meant disaster; happily the hill terminated in a level  stretch of softer road, which checked the speed and the machine  came slowly to a stop.    The sensation of rushing down hill with power and brakes  absolutely detached is peculiar and exhilarating. It is quite like  coasting or tobogganing; the excitement is in proportion to the  risk; the chance of safety lies in a clear road; for the time  being the machine is a huge projectile, a flying mass, a ton of  metal rushing through space; there is no sensation of fear, not a  tremor of the nerves, but one becomes for the moment exceedingly  alert, with instantaneous comprehension of the character of the  road; every rut, stone, and curve are seen and appreciated; the  possibility of collision is understood, and every danger is  present in the mind, and with it all the thrill of excitement  which ever accompanies risk.    During the entire descent the Professor was in blissful ignorance  of the loss of control. To him the hill was like many another that  we had taken at top speed; but when he saw the rear wheel far out  from the carriage with only about twelve inches of axle holding in  the sleeve, and understood the loss of control through both chain  and brakes, his imagination began to work, and he thought of  everything that could have happened and many things that could  not, but he remarked philosophically,--    \"Fear is entirely a creature of the imagination. We are not afraid  of what will happen, but of what may. We are all cowards until  confronted with danger; most men are heroes in emergencies.\"    Detaching a lamp from the front of the carriage, repairs were  made. A block of wood and a fence rail made a good jack; the gear  case was opened up, the axle driven home, and the set-screws  turned down tight; but it was only too apparent that the screws  would work loose again.    The next morning we pulled out both halves of the axle and found  the key-ways worn so there was a very perceptible play. As the  keys were supposed to hold the gears tight and the set-screws were  only for the purpose of keeping the axle from working out, it was  idle to expect the screws to hold fast so long as the keys were  loose in the ways; the slight play of the gears upon the axles  would soon loosen screws, in fact, both were found loose, although  tightened up only the evening before.    As it had become apparent that the machine was geared too high for  the hills of New York, it seemed better to send it into the shop  for such changes as were necessary, rather than spend the time  necessary to make them in the one small machine shop at  Canandaigua.    Furthermore the Professor's vacation was drawing to a close; he  had given himself not to exceed ten days, eight had elapsed.    \"I feel that I have exhausted the possibilities and eccentricities  of automobiling; there is nothing more to learn; if there is  anything more, I do not care to know it. I am inclined to accept  the experience of last night as a warning; as the fellow who was  blown up with dynamite said when he came down, 'to repeat the  experiment would be no novelty.'\"    And so the machine was loaded on the cars, side-tracked on the  way, and it was many a day before another start could be made from  Buffalo.    It cannot be too often repeated that it is a mistake to ever lose  sight of one's machine during a tour; it is a mistake to leave it  in a machine shop for repairs; it is a mistake to even return it  to the place of its creation; for you may be quite sure that  things will be left undone that should be done, and things done  that should not be done.    It requires days and weeks to become acquainted  with all the  peculiarities and weaknesses of an automobile, to know its strong  points and rely upon them, to appreciate its failings and be  tender towards them. After you have become acquainted, do not risk  the friendship by letting the capricious thing out of your sight.  It is so fickle that it forms wanton attachments for every one it  meets,--for urchins, idlers, loafers, mechanics, permits them all  sorts of familiarities, so that when, like a truant, it comes  wandering back, it is no longer the same, but a new creature,  which you must learn again to know.    It is monotonously lonesome running an automobile across country  alone; the record-breaker may enjoy it, but the civilized man does  not; man is a gregarious animal, especially in his sports; one  must have an audience, if an audience of only one.    The return of the Professor made it necessary to find some one  else. There was but one who could go, but she had most  emphatically refused; did not care for the dust and dirt, did not  care for the curious crowds, did not care to go fast, did not care  to go at all. To overcome these apparently insurmountable  objections, a semi-binding pledge was made to not run more than  ten or twelve miles per hour, and not more than thirty or forty  miles per day,--promises so obviously impossible of fulfillment on  the part of any chauffeur that they were not binding in law. We  started out well within bounds, making but little over forty miles  the first day; we wound up with a glorious run of one hundred and  forty miles the last day, covering the Old Sarnia gravel out of  London, Ontario, at top speed for nearly seventy miles.    For five weeks to a day we wandered over the eastern country at  our own sweet will, not a care, not a responsibility,--days  without seeing newspapers, finding mail and telegrams at  infrequent intervals, but much of the time lost to the world of  friends and acquaintances.    Touring on an automobile differs from coaching, posting,  railroading, from every known means of locomotion, in that you are  really lost to the world. In coaching or posting, one knows with  reasonable certainty the places that can be made; the itinerary is  laid out in advance, and if departed from, friends can be notified  by wire, so that letters and telegrams may be forwarded.    With an automobile all is different. The vagaries of the machine  upset every itinerary. You do not know where you will stop,  because you cannot tell when you may stop. If one has in mind a  certain place, the machine may never reach it, or, arriving, the  road and the day may be so fine you are irresistibly impelled to  keep on. The very thought that letters are to be at a certain  place at a certain date is a bore, it limits your progress,  fetters your will, and curbs your inclinations. One hears of  places of interest off the chosen route; the temptation to see  them is strong exactly in proportion to the assurances given that  you will go elsewhere.    The automobile is lawless; it chafes under restraint; will follow  neither advice nor directions. Tell it to go this way, it is sure  to go that; to turn the second corner to the right, it will take  the first to the left; to go to one city, it prefers another; to  avoid a certain road, it selects that above all others.    It is a grievous error to tell friends you are coming; it puts  them to no end of inconvenience; for days they expect you and you  do not come; their feeling of relief that you did not come is  destroyed by your appearance.    The day we were expected at a friend's summer home at the sea-side  we spent with the Shakers in the valley of Lebanon, waiting for a  new steering-head. Telegrams of inquiry, concern, and consolation  reached us in our retreat, but those who expected us were none the  less inconvenienced.    Then, too, what business have the dusty, grimy, veiled, goggled,  and leathered party from the machine among the muslin gowns, smart  wraps, and immaculate coverings of the conventional house party;  if we but approach, they scatter in self-protection.    From these reflections it is only too plain that the automobile  --like that other inartistic instrument of torture, the grand piano  --is not adapted to the drawing-room. It is not quite at home in  the stable; it demands a house of its own. If the friend who  invites you to visit him has a machine, then accept, for he is a  brother crank; but if he has none, do not fill his generous soul  with dismay by running up his drive-way, sprinkling its spotless  white with oil, leaving an ineradicable stain under the  porte-cochere, and frightening his favorite horses into fits as  you run into the stable.    But it is delightful to go through cities and out-of-the-way  places, just leaving cards in a most casual manner upon people one  knows. We passed through many places twice, some places three  times, in careering about. Each time we called on friends;  sometimes they were in, sometimes out; it was all so casual,--a  cup of tea, a little chat, sometimes without shutting down the  motor,--the briefest of calls, all the more charming because  brief,--really, it was strange.    We see a town ahead; calling to a man by the roadside,--    \"What "]]]
