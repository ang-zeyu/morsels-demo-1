There were two sets, each generating a 1,500 or 2,000 volt direct  current; and the two generators being permanently connected, delivered  a combined direct current of 3,000 volts--as high a direct voltage  current, Tom knew, as had ever been adopted for railroad work. The  current voltage for ordinary street railway work is 550 volts.    \"I could run even this big machine,\" Tom explained to Ned Newton, \"with  a much lighter current. But out there on the Hendrickton & Pas Alos  line the transforming stations deliver this high voltage to the  locomotives. I want to test mine under similar conditions.\"    \"This is going to be an expensive test, Tom,\" said Ned, grumbling a  little. \"The cost-sheets are running high.\"    \"We are aiming at a big target,\" returned the inventor. \"You've got to  bait with something bigger than sprats to catch a whale, Ned.\"    \"Humph! Suppose you don't catch the whale after all?\"    \"Don't lose hope,\" returned Tom, calmly. \"I am going after this whale  right, believe me! This is one of the biggest contracts--if not the  very biggest--we ever tackled.\"    \"It looks as if the expense account would run the highest,\" admitted  the financial manager.    \"All right. Maybe that is so. But I'll spend the last cent I've got to  perfect this patent. I am going to beat the Jandels if it is humanly  possible to do so.\"    \"I can only hope you will, Tom. Why, this track and the overhead  trolley equipment is going to cost a small fortune. I had no idea when  you signed that contract with Mr. Bartholomew that so much money would  have to be spent in merely the experimental stage of the thing.\"    Ned Newton possessed traits of caution that could not be gainsaid. That  was one thing that made him such a successful financial manager for the  Swift Company. He watched expenditures as closely now as he had when  the business was upon a much more limited footing.    The rails laid along the inside of the stockade made a two-mile track,  as well ballasted as any regular railroad right of way. In addition the  overhead equipment was costly.    To eliminate any possibility of the trolley wire breaking, a strong  steel cable, called a catenary, was slung just above the trolley wire.  To this catenary the trolley wire was suspended by hangers at short  intervals.    These cables were strung from brackets so that a single row of poles  could be used, save at the curves, at which cross-span construction was  used. The trolley wire itself was of the 4/0 size, and was the largest  diameter copper wire ever employed for railroad purposes.    Several weeks had now passed since the great locomotive had been  assembled in the erection shed and the cab of the locomotive completed.  It really was a monster machine, and any stranger coming into the place  and seeing it for the first time must have marveled at the grim power  suggested by the mere bulk of the structure.    When the day of the first test arrived Tom allowed only his most  intimate friends to be present. Mary Nestor accompanied Mr. Swift into  the shops at the time appointed, and she was as excited over the  outcome of the test as Tom himself.    Ned Newton and the mechanical force of the shops knocked off work to  become spectators at the exhibition.  The only other outsider was Mr.  Damon.    \"Bless my alternating current!\" cried the eccentric gentleman.  \"I  would not miss this for the world. If you tried to shut me out, Tom,  I'd climb over the stockade to get in.\"    \"You'd better not,\" Tom told him, dryly. \"If you tried that you'd get a  worse shock than any chicken thief will get that tries to steal your  buff Orpingtons.\"          Chapter XIII    Hopes and Fears      Tom climbed into the huge cab of the electric locomotive. In fact, the  cab was the most of it, for every part of the mechanism save the  drivers was covered by the eighty-odd foot structure.  From the peak of  the pilot to the rear bumper the length was ninety feet and some inches.    As Tom slid the monster out upon the yard track the small crowd  cheered. At least, the locomotive had the power to move, and to the  unknowing ones, at least, that seemed a great and wonderful thing.    What they saw was apparently a box-car--like a mail coach, only with  more high windows--ten feet wide, its roof more than fourteen feet from  the rails, its locked pantagraph adding two feet more to its height.    Just what was in the cab--the water and oil tanks, the steam-heating  boiler to supply heat and hot water to the train the monster was to  draw, the motors and the many other mechanical contrivances--was hidden  from the spectators.    In fact, since completing the electrical equipment of the Hercules  0001, as Tom had named the locomotive, the young inventor had allowed  nobody inside the cab, any more than he allowed visitors inside his  private workshop. Even Mr. Swift did not know all the results of Tom's  experimental work. In a general way the older inventor knew the trend  of his son's attempts, but the details and the results of Tom's  experiments, the latter told to nobody.    But as the huge locomotive rolled into the yard and followed the more  or less circular track inside the yard fence, it was plain to all of  the onlookers that the motive-power was there all right! Just what  speed could be coaxed from the feed-cable overhead was another question.    Nor did Tom Swift try for much speed on this first test of the Hercules  0001. He went around the two-mile track several times before bringing  his machine to a stop near the crowd of onlookers. He came to the open  door of the cab.    \"One thing is sure, Tom!\" shouted Ned. \"It do move!\"    \"Bless my slippery skates!\" exclaimed Mr. Damon, \"it slides right  along, Tom. You've done it, my boy--you've done it!\"    \"It looks good from where I stand, my son,\" said Mr. Barton Swift.    It was Mary who suspected that Tom was not wholly satisfied--as yet, at  least--with the test of the Hercules 0001. She cried:    \"Tom! is it all right?\"    \"Nothing is ever all right--that is, not perfect--in this old world, I  guess, Mary,\" returned the young inventor. \"But I am not discouraged.  As Ned says, the old contraption 'do move.' How fast she'll move is  another thing.\"    \"What time did you make?\" asked Mr. Swift.    \"Not above fifteen miles an hour.\"    \"Whew!\" whistled Ned dolefully. \"That is a long way from--\"    Tom made an instant motion and Ned's careless lips were sealed.  It was  not generally known among the men the speed which Tom hoped to obtain  with his new invention.    \"It is a wide shoot at the target, that is true,\" Tom said, soberly.  \"But remember I cannot test it for speed on this short and almost  circular track. Right at the start, however, I see that something about  the power-feed must be changed.\"    \"What is that?\" asked Mary, curiously.    \"I have only had rigged here one trolley wire. There must be two  attached alternately to the catenary cable. Such a form of twin  conductor trolley will permit the collection of a heavy current through  the twin contact of the pantagraph with the two trolley wires, and  should assure a sparkless collection of the current at any speed. You  noticed that when I took the sharper curves there was an aerial  exhibition. I want to do away with the fireworks.\"    The fact that the Hercules 0001 was a going and apparently powerful  draught engine satisfied most of the onlookers that Tom Swift was on  the road to final and overwhelming success. The mechanics, indeed, saw  no reason why the locomotive could not be run right out of the yard on  the freight track and coupled to the first train going West. Of course,  the Hercules 0001 could not be delivered to the Hendrickton & Pas Alos  under its own power.    When the locomotive was run back into the shed and stood once more on  the erection track, Tom confessed to Mary and Ned, while Mr. Damon and  Mr. Swift were looking through the huge cab, that he was not at all  pleased with the action of the machine.    \"I have the best equipment of any electric locomotive on the rails  today. I am sure of that,\" he said. \"The Hercules Three-Oughts-One is  not as long as those electric locomotives of the C. M. &. St. P. But  that's all right. I have built mine more compactly and, properly  geared, it should have all the power of either the Baldwin-Westinghouse  or the Jandel locomotive.\"    \"Then, Tom dear, what is wrong?\" cried Mary.    \"Speed. That is what troubles me. Have I got anything like the speed I  am aiming for?\"    \"Two miles a minute!\" breathed Ned Newton. \"Some speed, boy!\"    \"And must you have such great speed, Tom?\" repeated Mary.    \"That is in my contract. Not only that, but to be of much use to the H.  & P. A. this locomotive must have such speed--or mighty near it. Of  course, under ordinary conditions, two miles a minute for a locomotive  and train of heavy freights would burn up the track--maybe melt the  flanges and throw everything out of gear.\"    \"Why try for it, then?\" demanded Mary.    \"It is the power suggested by the possession of such speed that we want  in the Hercules Three-Oughts-One. That two miles a minute is a fiction  of the imagination, cannot be claimed. It is possible. It is humanly  possible. It is coming.\"    \"Then you must be the fellow to first accomplish it, Tom Swift,\" Ned  declared.    \"Of course, if anybody can do it, you can, Tom,\" agreed the girl  complacently.    \"Thanks--many, many thanks,\" laughed the young inventor. \"I'd be able  to harness the sun and stars, and put a surcingle around the moon if I  came up to my friends' opinion of my ability.    \"Nevertheless, two-miles-a-minute is my objective point, and I do not  believe it is visionary. Consider the motor-cycle. Ninety miles an hour  has long been possible with that, and some tests have shown a speed of  over a hundred and ten. That is not far from my mark.    \"Some Mallet locomotives of the "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/13640"],[0,"Scientific American Supplement, No. 821, September 26, 1891 (#13)"],[1,"numbers who desired to make the ascent,  and the time was deemed fit for the establishment of more speedy  communication.    Notwithstanding the necessity, the proposal to establish a railroad met  with general derision, but the scheme was soon shown to be perfectly  practicable, and a beginning was made in 1879. The road is what is known  as a cable road, there being a single sleeper with three rails, one on  the top which really bore the weight, and one on each side near the  bottom, which supported the wheels, which coming out from the axle at a  sharp angle, prevented the vehicle from being overturned. The road  covers the last 4,000 feet of the ascent, and the power house is at the  bottom, a steel cable running up, passing round a wheel at the top and  returning to the engine in the power house. The ascent to the lower  terminus of the road is made on mules or donkeys; then, in a comfortable  car, the traveler is carried to a point not far from the crater. The car  is a combined grip and a passenger car, similar in some points to the  grip car of the present day, while the seats of the passenger portion  are inclined as in the cars on the Rigi road. But the angle of the road  being from thirty-three to forty-five degrees, makes both ascent and  descent seem fearfully perilous. Every precaution, however, is taken to  insure the safety of passengers; each car is provided with several  strong and independent brakes, and thus far no accident worth recording  has occurred. The road was opened in June, 1880. Although there have  been several considerable eruptions since that date, none of them did  any damage to the line but what was repaired in a few hours.    The fashion thus set will, no doubt, be followed in many other quarters.  Wherever there is sufficient travel to pay working expenses and a profit  on a steep grade mountain road it will probably be built. Already there  is talk of a road on Mont Blanc, of another up the Yungfrau, and several  have been projected in the Schwartz and Hartz mountains. A route on Ben  Nevis, in Scotland, is already surveyed, and it is said surveys have  also been made up Snowden, with a view to the establishment of a road to  the summit of the highest Welsh peak. Sufficient travel is all that is  necessary, and when that is guaranteed, whenever a mountain possesses  sufficient interest to induce people to make its ascent in considerable  numbers, means of transportation, safe and speedy, will soon be  provided. The modern engineer is able, willing and ready to build a road  to the top of Mt.

[Illustration: THE FRENCH ARMORED TURRET SHIP MARCEAU]    The Marceau, the last ironclad completed and added to the French navy,  was put in commission at Toulon in April last, and has lately left that  town to join the French squadron of the north at Brest. The original  designs of this ship were prepared by M. Huin, of the French Department  of Naval Construction, but since the laying down of the keel in the year  1882 they have been very considerably modified, and many improvements  have been introduced.    Both ship and engines were constructed by the celebrated French firm,  the Societe des Forges et Chantiers de la Mediterranee, the former at  their shipyard in La Seyne and the latter at their engine works in  Marseilles. The ship was five years in construction on the stocks, was  launched in May, 1887, and not having been put in commission until the  present year, was thus nearly nine years in construction. She is a  barbette belted ship of somewhat similar design to the French ironclads  Magenta, now being completed at the Toulon arsenal, and the Neptune, in  construction at Brest.    The hull is constructed partly of steel and partly of iron, and has the  principal dimensions as follows. Length, 330 ft. at the water line;  beam, 66 ft. outside the armor; draught, 27 ft. 6 in. aft.;  displacement, 10,430 English or 10,600 French tons. The engines are two  in number, one driving each propeller; they are of the vertical compound  type, and on the speed trials developed 11,300 indicated horse power  under forced and 5,500 indicated horse power under natural draught, the  former giving a speed of 16.2 knots per hour with 90 revolutions per  minute. The boilers are eight in number, of the cylindrical marine type,  and work at a pressure of 85.3 lb. per square inch. During the trials  the steering powers of the ship were found to be excellent, but the bow  wave is said, by one critic, to have been very great.    The ship is completely belted with Creusot steel armor, which varies in  thickness from 9 in. forward to 173/4 in. midships. In addition to this  belt the ship is protected by an armored deck of 31/2 in., while the  barbette gun towers are protected with 153/4 in. steel armor with a hood  of 21/2 in. to protect the men against machine gun fire. As a further  means of insuring the life of the ship in combat and also against  accidents at sea, the Marceau is divided into 102 water-tight  compartments and is fitted with torpedo defense netting. There are two  masts, each carrying double military tops; and a conning tower is  mounted on each mast, from either of which the ship may be worked in  time of action, and both of which are in telegraphic communication with  the engine rooms and magazines. Provision is made for carrying 600 tons  of coal, which, at a speed of 10 knots, should be sufficient to supply  the boilers for a voyage of 4,000 miles.    The armament of the Marceau is good for the tonnage of the ship and  consists principally of four guns of 34 centimeters (13.39 in.) of the  French 1884 model, having a weight of 52 tons, a length of 281/2 calibers,  and being able to pierce 30 in. of iron armor at the muzzle. The  projectiles weigh 924 lb., and are fired with a charge of 387 lb. of  powder. The muzzle velocity has been calculated to be 1,968 ft. per  second. The guns are entirely of steel and are mounted on Canet  carriages in four barbette towers, one forward, one aft, and one on each  side amidships. On the firing trials both the guns and all the Canet  machinery, for working the guns and hoisting the ammunition, gave very  great satisfaction to all present at the time. In addition to the above  four heavy guns there are, in the broadside battery, sixteen guns of 14  centimeters (5.51 in.), eight on each side, and a gun of equal caliber  is mounted right forward on the same deck. The armament is completed by  a large number of Hotchkiss quick-firing and revolver guns and four  torpedo tubes, one forward, one aft, and one on each side.    The crew of the Marceau has been fixed at 600 men, and the cost is  stated to have been about $3,750,000.--_Engineering_.           *       *       *       *       *    [Continued from SUPPLEMENT, No. 820, page 13097.]          A REVIEW OF MARINE ENGINEERING DURING THE PAST DECADE.[1]    [Footnote 1: Paper read before the Institution of Mechanical Engineers,  July 28, 1891.]    BY MR. ALFRED BLECHYNDEN, OF BARROW-IN-FURNESS      _Steam Pipes_.--The failures of copper steam pipes on board the Elbe,  Lahn, and other vessels have drawn serious attention both to the  material and to the modes of construction of the pipes. The want of  elastic strength in copper is an important element in the matter; and  the three following remedies have been proposed, while still retaining  copper as the material. First, in view of the fact that in the operation  of brazing the copper may be seriously injured, to use solid drawn  tubes. This appears fairly to meet the main dangers incidental to  brazing; but as solid drawn pipes of over 7 inches diameter are  difficult to procure, it hardly meets the case sufficiently. Secondly,  to use electrically deposited tubes. At first much was promised in this  direction; but up to the present time it can hardly be regarded as more  than in the experimental stage. Thirdly, to use the ordinary brazed or  solid drawn tubes, and to re-enforce them by serving with steel cord or  steel or copper wire. This has been tried, and found to answer  perfectly. For economical reasons, as well as for insuring the minimum  of torsion to the material during manufacture, it is important to make  as few bends as possible; but in practice much less difficulty has been  experienced in serving bent pipes in a machine than would have been  expected. Discarding copper, it has been proposed to substitute steel or  iron. In the early days of the higher pressures, Mr. Alexander Taylor  adopted wrought iron for steam pipes. One fitted in the Claremont in  February, 1882, was recently removed from the vessel for experimental  purposes, and was reported upon by Mr. Magnus Sandison in a paper read  before the Northeast Coast Institution of Engineers and Shipbuilders.[2]  The following is a summary of the facts. The pipe was 5 inches external  diameter, and 0.375 inch thick. It was lap welded in the works of  Messrs. A. & J. Stewart. The flanges were screwed on and brazed  externally. The pipe was not lagged or protected in any manner. After  eight and a half years' service the metal measured where cut 0.32 and  0.375 inch in thickness, showing that the wasting during that time had  been very slight. The interior surface of the tube exhibited no signs of  pitting or corrosion. It was covered by a thin crust of black oxide, the  maximum thickness of which did not exceed 1/32 inch. Where the deposit  was thickest it was curiously striated by the action of the steam. On  the scale being removed, the original bloom on the surface of the metal  was exposed. It would thus appear that the danger from corrosion of iron  steam pipes is not"]]]
