The old  man was knocked silly, and as a consequence was drowned. When Isidro,  the son, who dearly loved his father, heard of the old man's death, he  at once made up his mind to accuse Suan before the king. He therefore  joined the two travellers.    After a while the three came to a place where they saw Barbekin  having a hard time getting his carabao out of the mire. Suan offered  to help. He seized the carabao by the tail, and pulled with great  force. The carabao was rescued, but its tail was broken off short  by a sudden pull of Suan. Barbekin was filled with rage because of  the injury done to his animal: so he, too, resolved to accuse Suan  before the king.    When they came to the palace, the king said, \"Why have you come here?\"    Pedro spoke first. \"I have come,\" he said, \"to accuse Suan to you. He  has one of my posts, and he won't return it to me.\"    On being asked if the accusation was true, Suan responded with a nod,  and said in addition, \"But Pedro ate a part of my rice and fish on  the way here.\"    \"My decision, then,\" said the king, \"is that Suan shall give Pedro  his post, and that Pedro shall give Suan his rice and fish.\"    Isidro was the next to speak. \"I have come here to accuse Suan. While  my father was bathing in the river, Suan jumped on him and killed him.\"    \"Suan, then, must bathe in the river,\" said the king, \"and you may  jump on him.\"    When Barbekin was asked why he had come, he replied, \"I wish to accuse  Suan. He pulled my carabao by the tail, and it was broken off short.\"    \"Give Suan your carabao, then,\" said the king. \"He shall not return  it to you until he has made its tail grow to its full length.\"    The accused and the accusers now took their leave of the king.    \"Give me the carabao now,\" said Suan to Barbekin when they had gone  some distance from the palace.    The carabao was young and strong, and Barbekin hated to give it up. So  he said, \"Don't take the carabao, and I will give you fifty pesos.\"    \"No; the decision of the king must be fulfilled,\" said Suan. Barbekin  then raised the sum to ninety pesos, and Suan consented to accept  the offer. Thus Suan was rewarded for his work in helping Barbekin.    When they came to the bridge, Suan went down into the river, and told  Isidro to jump on him. But the bridge was high, and Isidro was afraid  to jump. Moreover, he did not know how to swim, and he feared that he  would but drown himself if he jumped. So he asked Suan to pardon him.    \"No, you must fulfil the decision of the king,\" answered Suan.    \"Let me off from jumping on you, and I will give you five hundred  pesos,\" said Isidro.    The amount appealed to Suan as being a good offer, so he accepted it  and let Isidro go.    As soon as Suan reached home, he took Pedro's post from his house,  and started for Pedro's house, taking a razor along with him. \"Here  is your post,\" he said; \"but you must lie down, for I am going to  get my rice and fish from you.\"    In great fright Pedro said, \"You need not return the post any more.\"    \"No,\" said Suan, \"we must fulfil the decision of the king.\"    \"If you do not insist on your demand,\" said Pedro, \"I will give you  half of my riches.\"    \"No, I must have my rice and fish.\" Suan now held Pedro by the  shoulder, and began to cut Pedro's abdomen with the razor. He had no  sooner done that, than Pedro, in great terror, cried out,--    \"Don't cut me, and you shall have all my riches!\"    Thus Suan became the richest man in town by using his tact and  knowledge in outwitting his enemies.      The King's Decisions.    Narrated by Jose M. Hilario, a Tagalog from Batangas, who heard the  story from his father.    Once a poor man named Juan was without relatives or friends. Life  to him was a series of misfortunes. A day often passed without his  tasting even a mouthful of food.    One day, weakened with hunger and fatigue, as he was walking along  the road, he passed a rich man's house. It so happened that at this  time the rich man's food was being cooked. The food smelled so good,  that Juan's hunger was satisfied merely with the fragrance. When the  rich man learned that the smell of his food had satisfied Juan, he  demanded money of Juan. Juan refused to give money, however, because  he had none, and because he had neither tasted nor touched the rich  man's food. \"Let's go to the king, then,\" said Pedro, the rich man,  \"and have this matter settled!\" Juan had no objection to the proposal,  and the two set out for the palace.    Soon they came to a place where the mire was knee-deep. There they saw  a young man who was trying to help his horse out of a mud-hole. \"Hey,  you lazy fellows! help me to get my horse out of this hole,\" said  Manuel. The three tried with all their might to release the horse. They  finally succeeded; but unfortunately Juan had taken hold of the  horse's tail, and it was broken off when Juan gave a sudden hard pull.    \"You have got to pay me for injuring my horse,\" said Manuel.    \"No, I will not give you any money, because I had no intention of  helping you until you asked me to,\" said Juan.    \"Well, the king will have to settle the quarrel.\" Juan, who was not  to be frightened by threats, went with Pedro and Manuel.    Night overtook the three on their way. They had to lodge themselves in  the house of one of Pedro's friends. Juan was not allowed to come up,  but was made to sleep downstairs.    At midnight the pregnant wife of the host had to make water. She  went to the place under which Juan was sleeping. Juan, being suddenly  awakened and frightened, uttered a loud shriek; and the woman, also  frightened because she thought there were robbers or ghosts about,  miscarried. The next morning the husband asked Juan why he had cried  out so loud in the night. Juan said that he was frightened.    \"You won't fool me! Come with us to the king,\" said the husband.    When the four reached the palace, they easily gained access to the  royal presence. Then each one explained why he had come there.    \"I'll settle the first case,\" said the king. He commanded the servant  to fetch two silver coins and place them on the table. \"Now, Pedro,  come here and smell the coins. As Juan became satisfied with the  smell of your food, so now satisfy yourself with the smell of the  money.\" Pedro could not say a word, though he was displeased at the  unfavorable decision.    \"Now I'll give my decisions on the next two cases. Manuel, you must  give your horse to Juan, and let him have it until another tail  grows.--And you, married man, must let Juan have your wife until she  gives birth to another child.\"    Pedro, Manuel, and the married man went home discontented with the  decisions of the king,--Pedro without having received pay, Manuel  without his horse, and the other man without his wife.      Notes.    These two Tagalog stories, together with another, \"How Piro  became Rich,\" which is almost identical with No. 5(a), may  possibly be descended directly from an old Buddhist birth-story  (\"Gamani-canda-jataka,\" No. 257),--a tale in which W. A. Clouston  (see Academy, No. 796, for Aug. 6, 1887) sees the germ of the  \"pound-of-flesh\" incident. An abstract of the first part of this Jataka  will set forth the striking resemblance between our stories and this  old Hindoo apologue, [21] The part of the Jataka that interests us  is briefly the account of how a man was haled to the king's tribunal  for injuries done unwittingly, and how the king passed judgment  thereupon. The abstract follows:--    Gamani, a certain old courtier of the ruling king's dead father,  decided to earn his living by farming, as he thought that the new  king should be surrounded with advisers of his own age. He took up  his abode in a village three leagues from the city, and, after the  rainy season was over, one day borrowed two oxen from a friend, with  which to help him do his ploughing. In the evening he returned the  oxen; but the friend being at dinner, and not inviting Gamani to eat,  Gamani put the oxen in the stall, and got no formal release from his  creditor. That night thieves stole the cattle. Next day the owner of  the oxen discovered the theft, and decided to make Gamani pay for the  beasts. So the two set out to lay the case before the king. On the  way they stopped for food at the house of a friend of Gamani's. The  woman of the house, while climbing a ladder to the store-room for rice  for Gamani, fell and miscarried. The husband, returning that instant,  accused Gamani of hitting his wife and bringing on untimely labor:  so the husband set off with Gamani's first accuser to get justice  from the king. On their way they met a horse that would not go with  its groom. The owner of the horse shouted to G. to hit the horse  with something and head it back. G. threw a stone at the animal, but  broke its leg. \"Here's a king's officer for you,\" shouted the man;  \"you've broken my horse's leg.\" G. was thus three men's prisoner. By  this time G. was in despair, and decided to kill himself. As soon as  opportunity came, he rushed up a hill near the road, and threw himself  from a precipice. But he fell on the back of an old basket-maker and  killed him on the spot. The son of the basket-maker accused G. of  murder and went along with the three other plaintiffs to the king. (I  omit here the various questions that persons whom G. meets along the  road beg him to take to the king for an answer.)    All five appearing in the presence of the king, the owner of the oxen  demanded justice. In answer to the king's question, he at first denied  having seen G. return the oxen, but later admitted that he saw them  in the stall. G. was ordered to pay twenty-four pieces of money for  the oxen; but the plaintiff, for lying, was condemned to have his  eyes plucked out by G. Terrified at the prospect, he threw money  to G. and rushed away.

And  bordering on it the Mossynoeci next in order inhabit the well-wooded  mainland and the parts beneath the mountains, who have built in towers  made from trees their wooden homes and well-fitted chambers, which they  call Mossynes, and the people themselves take their name from them.  After passing them ye must beach your ship upon a smooth island, when ye  have driven away with all manner of skill the ravening birds, which  in countless numbers haunt the desert island. In it the Queens of the  Amazons, Otrere and Antiope, built a stone temple of Ares what time they  went forth to war. Now here an unspeakable help will come to you from  the bitter sea; wherefore with kindly intent I bid you stay. But what  need is there that I should sin yet again declaring everything to the  end by my prophetic art? And beyond the island and opposite mainland  dwell the Philyres: and above the Philyres are the Macrones, and after  them the vast tribes of the Becheiri. And next in order to them dwell  the Sapeires, and the Byzeres have the lands adjoining to them, and  beyond them at last live the warlike Colchians themselves. But speed on  in your ship, till ye touch the inmost bourne of the sea. And here at  the Cytaean mainland and from the Amarantine mountains far away and the  Circaean plain, eddying Phasis rolls his broad stream to the sea. Guide  your ship to the mouth of that river and ye shall behold the towers of  Cytaean Aeetes and the shady grove of Ares, where a dragon, a monster  terrible to behold, ever glares around, keeping watch over the fleece  that is spread upon the top of an oak; neither by day nor by night does  sweet sleep subdue his restless eyes.\"    (ll. 408-410) Thus he spake, and straightway fear seized them as they  heard. And for a long while they were struck with silence; till at last  the hero, son of Aeson, spake, sore dismayed at their evil plight:    (ll. 411-418) \"O aged sire, now hast thou come to the end of the toils  of our sea-journeying and hast told us the token, trusting to which we  shall make our way to Pontus through the hateful rocks; but whether,  when we have escaped them, we shall have a return back again to Hellas,  this too would we gladly learn from thee. What shall I do, how shall I  go over again such a long path through the sea, unskilled as I am, with  unskilled comrades? And Colchian Aea lies at the edge of Pontus and of  the world.\"    (ll. 419-425) Thus he spake, and him the aged sire addressed in reply:  \"O son, when once thou hast escaped through the deadly rocks, fear not;  for a deity will be the guide from Aea by another track; and to Aea  there will be guides enough. But, my friends, take thought of the artful  aid of the Cyprian goddess. For on her depends the glorious issue of  your venture. And further than this ask me not.\"    (ll. 426-437) Thus spake Agenor's son, and close at hand the twin sons  of Thracian Boreas came darting from the sky and set their swift feet  upon the threshold; and the heroes rose up from their seats when they  saw them present. And Zetes, still drawing hard breath after his toil,  spake among the eager listeners, telling them how far they had driven  the Harpies and how his prevented their slaying them, and how the  goddess of her grace gave them pledges, and how those others in fear  plunged into the vast cave of the Dictaean cliff. Then in the mansion  all their comrades were joyful at the tidings and so was Phineus  himself. And quickly Aeson's son, with good will exceeding, addressed  him:    (ll. 438-442) \"Assuredly there was then, Phineus, some god who cared for  thy bitter woe, and brought us hither from afar, that the sons of Boreas  might aid thee; and if too he should bring sight to thine eyes, verily I  should rejoice, methinks, as much as if I were on my homeward way.\"    (ll. 443-447) Thus he spake, but Phineus replied to him with downcast  look: \"Son of Aeson, that is past recall, nor is there any remedy  hereafter, for blasted are my sightless eyes. But instead of that, may  the god grant me death at once, and after death I shall take my share in  perfect bliss.\"    (ll. 448-467) Then they two returned answering speech, each to other,  and soon in the midst of their converse early dawn appeared; and round  Phineus were gathered the neighbours who used to come thither aforetime  day by day and constantly bring a portion of their food. To all alike,  however poor he was that came, the aged man gave his oracles with good  will, and freed many from their woes by his prophetic art; wherefore  they visited and tended him. And with them came Paraebius, who was  dearest to him, and gladly did he perceive these strangers in the house.  For long ere now the seer himself had said that a band of chieftains,  faring from Hellas to the city of Aceres, would make fast their hawsers  to the Thynian land, and by Zeus' will would check the approach of the  Harpies. The rest the old man pleased with words of wisdom and let them  go; Paraebius only he bade remain there with the chiefs; and straightway  he sent him and bade him bring back the choicest of his sheep. And when  he had left the hall Phineus spake gently amid the throng of oarsmen:    (ll. 468-489) \"O my friends, not all men are arrogant, it seems, nor  unmindful of benefits. Even as this man, loyal as he is, came hither to  learn his fate. For when he laboured the most and toiled the most, then  the needs of life, ever growing more and more, would waste him, and day  after day ever dawned more wretched, nor was there any respite to his  toil. But he was paying the sad penalty of his father's sin. For he when  alone on the mountains, felling trees, once slighted the prayers of a  Hamadryad, who wept and sought to soften him with plaintive words, not  to cut down the stump of an oak tree coeval with herself, wherein for  a long time she had lived continually; but he in the arrogance of youth  recklessly cut it down. So to him the nymph thereafter made her death  a curse, to him and to his children. I indeed knew of the sin when he  came; and I bid him build an altar to the Thynian nymph, and offer on  it an atoning sacrifice, with prayer to escape his father's fate. Here,  ever since he escaped the god-sent doom, never has he forgotten or  neglected me; but sorely and against his will do I send him from my  doors, so eager is he to remain with me in my affliction.\"    (ll. 490-499) Thus spake Agenor's son; and his friend straightway came  near leading two sheep from the flock. And up rose Jason and up rose the  sons of Boreas at the bidding of the aged sire. And quickly they called  upon Apollo, lord of prophecy, and offered sacrifice upon the health as  the day was just sinking. And the younger comrades made ready a feast  to their hearts' desire. Thereupon having well feasted they turned  themselves to rest, some near the ship's hawsers, others in groups  throughout the mansion. And at dawn the Etesian winds blew strongly,  which by the command of Zeus blow over every land equally.    (ll. 500-527) Cyrene, the tale goes, once tended sheep along the  marsh-meadow of Peneus among men of old time; for dear to her were  maidenhood and a couch unstained. But, as she guarded her flock by the  river, Apollo carried her off far from Haemonia and placed her among the  nymphs of the land, who dwelt in Libya near the Myrtosian height.  And here to Phoebus she bore Aristaeus whom the Haemonians, rich in  corn-land, call \"Hunter\" and \"Shepherd\". Her, of his love, the god made  a nymph there, of long life and a huntress, and his son he brought while  still an infant to be nurtured in the cave of Cheiron. And to him when  he grew to manhood the Muses gave a bride, and taught him the arts of  healing and of prophecy; and they made him the keeper of their sheep,  of all that grazed on the Athamantian plain of Phthia and round steep  Othrys and the sacred stream of the river Apidanus. But when from heaven  Sirius scorched the Minoan Isles, and for long there was no respite for  the inhabitants, then by the injunction of the Far-Darter they summoned  Aristaeus to ward off the pestilence. And by his father's command  he left Phthia and made his home in Ceos, and gathered together the  Parrhasian people who are of the lineage of Lycaon, and he built a great  altar to Zeus Icmaeus, and duly offered sacrifices upon the mountains to  that star Sirius, and to Zeus son of Cronos himself. And on this account  it is that Etesian winds from Zeus cool the land for forty days, and  in Ceos even now the priests offer sacrifices before the rising of the  Dog-star.    (ll. 528-536) So the tale is told, but the chieftains stayed there by  constraint, and every day the Thynians, doing pleasure to Phineus, sent  them gifts beyond measure. And afterwards they raised an altar to the  blessed twelve on the sea-beach opposite and laid offerings thereon and  then entered their swift ship to row, nor did they forget to bear with  them a trembling dove; but Euphemus seized her and brought her all  quivering with fear, and they loosed the twin hawsers from the land.    (ll. 537-548) Nor did they start unmarked by Athena, but straightway  swiftly she set her feel on a light cloud, which would waft her on,  mighty though she was, and she swept on to the sea with friendly  thoughts to the oarsmen. And as when one roveth far from his native  land, as we men often wander with enduring heart, nor is any land too  distant but all ways are clear to his view, and he sees in mind his own  home, and at once the way over sea and land seems slain, and swiftly  thinking, now this way, now that, he strains with eager eyes; so swiftly  the daughter of Zeus darted down and set her foot on the cheerless shore  of Thynia.    (ll. 549-567) Now when they reached the narrow strait of the winding  passage, hemmed in on both sides by rugged cliffs, while an eddying "]]]
