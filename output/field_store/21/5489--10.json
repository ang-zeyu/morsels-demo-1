After leaving the road she found herself in thick bush and as the  sky was heavily overcast she presently had recourse to her compass  and it was not until then that she discovered to her dismay that  she did not have it with her. So sure was she of her woodcraft,  however, that she continued on in the direction she thought west  until she had covered sufficient distance to warrant her in feeling  assured that, by now turning south, she could pass safely in rear  of the British patrol.    Nor did she commence to feel any doubts until long after she had  again turned toward the east well south, as she thought, of the  patrol. It was late afternoon--she should long since have struck  the road again south of Tonda; but she had found no road and now  she began to feel real anxiety.    Her horse had traveled all day without food or water, night  was approaching and with it a realization that she was hopelessly  lost in a wild and trackless country notorious principally for its  tsetse flies and savage beasts. It was maddening to know that she  had absolutely no knowledge of the direction she was traveling--that  she might be forging steadily further from the railway, deeper  into the gloomy and forbidding country toward the Pangani; yet it  was impossible to stop--she must go on.    Bertha Kircher was no coward, whatever else she may have been, but  as night began to close down around her she could not shut out from  her mind entirely contemplation of the terrors of the long hours  ahead before the rising sun should dissipate the Stygian gloom--the  horrid jungle night--that lures forth all the prowling, preying  creatures of destruction.    She found, just before dark, an open meadow-like break in the  almost interminable bush. There was a small clump of trees near the  center and here she decided to camp. The grass was high and thick,  affording feed for her horse and a bed for herself, and there was  more than enough dead wood lying about the trees to furnish a good  fire well through the night. Removing the saddle and bridle from  her mount she placed them at the foot of a tree and then picketed  the animal close by. Then she busied herself collecting firewood  and by the time darkness had fallen she had a good fire and enough  wood to last until morning.    From her saddlebags she took cold food and from her canteen a  swallow of water. She could not afford more than a small swallow  for she could not know how long a time it might be before she should  find more. It filled her with sorrow that her poor horse must go  waterless, for even German spies may have hearts and this one was  very young and very feminine.    It was now dark. There was neither moon nor stars and the light  from her fire only accentuated the blackness beyond.  She could see  the grass about her and the boles of the trees which stood out in  brilliant relief against the solid background of impenetrable night,  and beyond the firelight there was nothing.    The jungle seemed ominously quiet. Far away in the distance she  heard faintly the boom of big guns; but she could not locate their  direction. She strained her ears until her nerves were on the point  of breaking; but she could not tell from whence the sound came. And  it meant so much to her to know, for the battle-lines were north  of her and if she could but locate the direction of the firing she  would know which way to go in the morning.    In the morning! Would she live to see another morning?  She squared  her shoulders and shook herself together. Such thoughts must be  banished--they would never do. Bravely she hummed an air as she  arranged her saddle near the fire and pulled a quantity of long  grass to make a comfortable seat over which she spread her saddle  blanket. Then she un-strapped a heavy, military coat from the cantle  of her saddle and donned it, for the air was already chill.    Seating herself where she could lean against the saddle she prepared  to maintain a sleepless vigil throughout the night. For an hour  the silence was broken only by the distant booming of the guns and  the low noises of the feeding horse and then, from possibly a mile  away, came the rumbling thunder of a lion's roar. The girl started  and laid her hand upon the rifle at her side. A little shudder ran  through her slight frame and she could feel the goose flesh rise  upon her body.    Again and again was the awful sound repeated and each time she was  certain that it came nearer. She could locate the direction of this  sound although she could not that of the guns, for the origin of  the former was much closer. The lion was up wind and so could not  have caught her scent as yet, though he might be approaching to  investigate the light of the fire which could doubtless be seen  for a considerable distance.    For another fear-filled hour the girl sat straining her eyes and  ears out into the black void beyond her little island of light.  During all that time the lion did not roar again; but there was  constantly the sensation that it was creeping upon her. Again and  again she would start and turn to peer into the blackness beyond  the trees behind her as her overwrought nerves conjured the stealthy  fall of padded feet. She held the rifle across her knees at the  ready now and she was trembling from head to foot.    Suddenly her horse raised his head and snorted, and with a little  cry of terror the girl sprang to her feet. The animal turned and  trotted back toward her until the picket rope brought him to a stand,  and then he wheeled about and with ears up-pricked gazed out into  the night; but the girl could neither see nor hear aught.    Still another hour of terror passed during which the horse often  raised his head to peer long and searchingly into the dark. The girl  replenished the fire from time to time. She found herself becoming  very sleepy. Her heavy lids persisted in drooping; but she dared  not sleep. Fearful lest she might be overcome by the drowsiness  that was stealing through her she rose and walked briskly to and  fro, then she threw some more wood on the fire, walked over and  stroked her horse's muzzle and returned to her seat.    Leaning against the saddle she tried to occupy her mind with plans  for the morrow; but she must have dozed. With a start she awoke.  It was broad daylight. The hideous night with its indescribable  terrors was gone.    She could scarce believe the testimony of her senses. She had slept  for hours, the fire was out and yet she and the horse were safe  and alive, nor was there sign of savage beast about.  And, best of  all, the sun was shining, pointing the straight road to the east.  Hastily she ate a few mouthfuls of her precious rations, which with  a swallow of water constituted her breakfast. Then she saddled her  horse and mounted. Already she felt that she was as good as safe  in Wilhelmstal.    Possibly, however, she might have revised her conclusions could she  have seen the two pairs of eyes watching her every move intently  from different points in the bush.    Light-hearted and unsuspecting, the girl rode across the clearing  toward the bush while directly before her two yellow-green eyes  glared round and terrible, a tawny tail twitched nervously and  great, padded paws gathered beneath a sleek barrel for a mighty  spring. The horse was almost at the edge of the bush when Numa,  the lion, launched himself through the air. He struck the animal's  right shoulder at the instant that it reared, terrified, to wheel  in flight. The force of the impact hurled the horse backward to the  ground and so quickly that the girl had no opportunity to extricate  herself; but fell to the earth with her mount, her left leg pinned  beneath its body.    Horror-stricken, she saw the king of beasts open his mighty jaws  and seize the screaming creature by the back of its neck.  The  great jaws closed, there was an instant's struggle as Numa shook  his prey. She could hear the vertebrae crack as the mighty fangs  crunched through them, and then the muscles of her faithful friend  relaxed in death.    Numa crouched upon his kill. His terrifying eyes riveted themselves  upon the girl's face--she could feel his hot breath upon her cheek  and the odor of the fetid vapor nauseated her.  For what seemed  an eternity to the girl the two lay staring at each other and then  the lion uttered a menacing growl.    Never before had Bertha Kircher been so terrified--never before had  she had such cause for terror. At her hip was a pistol--a formidable  weapon with which to face a man; but a puny thing indeed with  which to menace the great beast before her. She knew that at best  it could but enrage him and yet she meant to sell her life dearly,  for she felt that she must die. No human succor could have availed  her even had it been there to offer itself. For a moment she tore  her gaze from the hypnotic fascination of that awful face and  breathed a last prayer to her God. She did not ask for aid, for she  felt that she was beyond even divine succor--she only asked that  the end might come quickly and with as little pain as possible.    No one can prophesy what a lion will do in any given emergency.  This one glared and growled at the girl for a moment and then fell  to feeding upon the dead horse. Fraulein Kircher wondered for an  instant and then attempted to draw her leg cautiously from beneath  the body of her mount; but she could not budge it. She increased  the force of her efforts and Numa looked up from his feeding to  growl again.  The girl desisted. She hoped that he might satisfy  his hunger and then depart to lie up, but she could not believe  that he would leave her there alive. Doubtless he would drag the  remains of his kill into the bush for"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/14012"],[0,"Ice-Caves of France and Switzerland (#13)"],[1," that she had brought up two  sons in the tomb, in order that there might be other voices to intercede  for her husband's life besides her own. They were, however, put to  death.[32]    To judge from the style of the hotels, Besancon is not visited by many  English travellers; and yet it well repays a visit, providing those who  care for such things with a full average of vaulted passages, and feudal  gateways, and arcaded court-yards, with much less than the average of  evil smell. There are gates of all shapes and times--Louis-Quatorze  towers, and fortifications specially constructed under Vauban's own eye;  while the approach to the town, from the land side, is by a tunnel, cut  through the live rock which forms a solid chord to the arc described by  the course of the river Doubs. This excavation, called appropriately the  _Porte Taillee_, is attributed by the various inhabitants to pretty  nearly all the famous emperors and kings who have lived from Julius  Caesar to Louis XIV.: it owes its origin, no doubt, to the construction  of the aqueduct which formerly brought into the town the waters pouring  out of the rock at Arcier, two leagues from Besancon, and was the work  probably of M. Aurelius and L. Verus. Local antiquaries assign the  aqueduct to Agrippa, the son-in-law of Augustus, apparently for no  better reason than because he built a similar work in Rome. The arch of  triumph[33] at the entrance to the upper town has been an inexhaustible  subject of controversy for many generations of antiquaries, and up to  the time of Dunod was generally attributed to Aurelian: that historian,  however, believed that its sculptures represented the education of  Crispus, the son of Constantine, and that the name Chrysopolis, by which  Besancon was very generally known in early times, was only a corruption  of Crispopolis. Earlier writers are in favour of the natural derivation  of Chrysopolis, and assert that when the Senones lost their famous  chief, the Brennus of Roman history, before Delphos, they built a town  where Byzantium afterwards stood, and called it Bisantium and  Chrysopolis, in memory of their city of those names at home.    The Hotel du Nord is a rambling old house, comfortable after French  ideas of comfort, and rejoicing in an excellent cuisine; though it is  true that on one occasion, at least, _haricots verts a l'Anglaise_ meant  a mass of fibrous greens, swimming in a most un-English sea of  artificial fat. It is a good place for studying the natural manners of  the untravelled Frenchman, who there sits patiently at the table, for  many minutes before dinner is served, with his napkin tucked in round  his neck, and his countenance composed into a look of much resignation.  The waiters are for the most part shock-headed boys, in angular-tail  coats well up in the back of the neck, who frankly confess, when any  order out of the common run of orders is given, that a German patois  from the left bank of the Rhine is their only extensive language. One of  these won my eternal gratitude by providing a clean fork at a crisis  between the last savouries and the _plat doux_; for the usual practice  with the waiters, when anyone neglected to secure his knife and fork for  the next course, was to slip the plate from under the unwonted charge,  and leave those instruments sprawling on the tablecloth in a vengeful  mess of gravy. Chickens' bones were there dealt with on all sides as  nature perhaps intended that they should be dealt with, namely, by  taking them between finger and thumb, and removing superfluities with  the teeth; and French officers with wasp-like waists, and red trousers  gathered in plaits to match, boldly despised the sophistication of  spoons, and ate their vanilla cream like men, by the help of bread and  fingers. The manners and broken French of the stranger formed an open  and agreeable subject of conversation, and the table was much quieter  than a Frenchman's _table d'hote_ is sometimes known to be: on one  occasion, however, all decorum was scattered to the winds, and the  guests rushed out into the court-yard with disordered bibs and tuckers,  on the announcement by the head waiter of a '_chien a l'Anglaise_, not  so high as a mustard-pot,' which one of the company promptly bought for  twenty-four francs, commencing its education on the spot by a lesson in  cigar-smoking.    It frequently happens in France that _cafe noir_ is a much more ready  and abundant tap than water, and so it was here; notwithstanding which,  the bedroom apparatus was most comfortable and complete. The chambermaid  was a boy, and under his auspices a sheet of postage-stamps and a lead  pencil vanished from the table. When it was suggested to him that  possibly they had been blown into some corner, and so swept away, he  brought a dustpan from a distant part of the house, and miraculously  discovered the stamps perched upon a small handful of dust therein,  deferring the discovery and his consequent surprise till he reached my  room. It was curious that the stamps, which had before been in an open  sheet, were now folded neatly together, and curled into the shape of a  waistcoat-pocket. He was inexorable about the pencil.    No certain information could be obtained in the hotel respecting the  glaciere; so an owner of carriages was summoned, and consulted as to the  best means of getting there. He naturally recommended that one of his  own carriages should be taken as far as the Abbey of Grace-Dieu, and  that we should start at five o'clock the next morning, with a driver who  knew the way to the glaciere from the point at which the carriage must  be left.[34] Five o'clock seemed very early for a drive of fifteen  miles; but the man asserted that instead of five leagues it was a good  seven or eight, and so it turned out to be. This glaciere may be called  a historical glaciere, being the only one which has attracted general  attention; and the mistake about its distance from Besancon arose very  many years ago, and has been perpetuated by a long series of copyists.  The distance may not be more than five leagues when measured on the map  with a ruler; but until the tunnels and via-ducts necessary for a crow  line are constructed, the world must be content to call it seven and a  half at least. The man bargained for two days' pay for the carriage, on  the plea that the horse would be so tired the next day that he would not  be able to do any work, and as that day was Sunday, the great day for  excursions, it would be a dead loss. It so happened that the charge for  two days, fifteen francs, was exactly what I paid elsewhere for one day,  so there was no difficulty about the price.    We started, accordingly, at five o'clock. The day was delightfully  fine, and in spite of the driver's peculiarity of speech, caused by a  short tongue, and aggravated by a villanous little black pipe clutched  between his remaining teeth, we got through a large amount of question  and answer respecting the country through which we passed. Of course,  the reins were carried through rings low down on the kicking-strap,  ingeniously placed so that each whisk of the horse's tail caught one or  other rein; and then the process of extraction was a somewhat dangerous  one, for there was no splashboard, and the driver had to stow his legs  away out of reach, before commencing operations. The landlord of the inn  at Muehlinen, on the road from Kandersteg to Thun, has a worse  arrangement than even this, both reins passing through one small leather  loop at the top of the kicking-strap; so that when the horse on one  occasion ran away down a steep hill in consequence of the break refusing  to act, the man in his flurry could not tell which rein to pull, to  steer clear of the wall of rock on one side, and the unfenced slope on  the other, and finally flung himself out in despair, leaving his English  cargo behind.    There has evidently been at some time a vast lake near Besancon, and the  old bottom of the lake is now covered with heavy meadow-grass, while the  corn-fields and villages creep down from the higher grounds, on the  remains of promontories which stretch out into the plain. The people are  in constant fear of inundation, and the driver informed me that in  winter large parts of the plain are flooded, the superfluous waters  vanishing after a time into a great hole, whose powers of digestion he  could not explain. The villages which lie on the shores, as it were, of  the lake, rejoice in church-towers with bulbous domes, rising out of  rich clusters of trees, and the early bells rang out through the crisp  air with something of a Belgian sweetness. Farther on, the road passed  through glorious wheat, clean as on an English model farm, save where  some picturesque farmer had devoted a corner to the growth of poppies.  Here, as elsewhere, potatoes did not grow in ridges, but each root had a  little hillock to itself; an unnatural early training which may account  for the strange appearance of _pommes de terre au naturel_.    Anyone who has driven through the morning air for an hour or two before  breakfast, will understand the satisfaction with which, about seven  o'clock, we deciphered a complicated milestone into 14 kilometres from  Besancon, which meant breakfast at the next village, Nancray. The  breakfast was simple enough, owing to the absence of butter and other  things, and consisted of coffee in its native pot, and dry bread: the  milk was set on the table in the pan in which it had been boiled, and a  soup-ladle and a French wash-hand basin took the place of cup and spoon.  A cat kept the door against sundry large and tailless dogs, whose  appetites had not gone with their tails; and an old woman kindly  delivered a lecture on the most approved method of making a ptisan from  the flowers of the lime-tree, and on the many medicinal properties of  that decoction, to which she attributed her good health at so"]]]
