He turned and went briskly through an empty  and untrampled part of the grove to the place where the wagon would be  most likely to stop. \"I'm sure going to make good to-day or--\" And a  little farther--\"What if it ain't _them_?\"    Speedily he discovered that it was \"them,\" and at the same time he  discovered something else which pleased him not at all. Dressed with  much care, so that even Billy must reluctantly own him good-looking  enough, and riding so close to the blue parasol that his horse barely  escaped grazing a wheel, was the Pilgrim. He glared at Billy in  unfriendly fashion and would have shut him off completely from  approach to the wagon; but a shining milk can, left carelessly by a  bush, caught the eye of his horse, and after that the Pilgrim was very  busy riding erratically in circles and trying to keep in touch with  his saddle.    Billy, grown surprisingly bold, went straight to where the blue  parasol was being closed with dainty deliberation. \"A little more, and  you'd have been late for dinner,\" he announced, smiling up at her, and  held out his eager arms. Diplomacy, perhaps, should have urged him to  assist the other lady first--but Billy Boyle was quite too direct  to be diplomatic and besides, the other lady was on the opposite side  from him.    Miss Bridger may have been surprised, and she may or may not have been  pleased; Billy could only guess at her emotions--granting she felt  any. But she smiled down at him and permitted the arms to receive her,  and she also permitted--though with some hesitation--Billy to lead her  straight away from the wagon and its occupants and from the gyrating  Pilgrim to the deep delights of the grove.    \"Mr. Walland is a good rider, don't you think?\" murmured Miss Bridger,  gazing over her shoulder.    \"He's a bird,\" said Billy evenly, and was polite enough not to mention  what kind of bird. He was wondering what on earth had brought those  two together and why, after that night, Miss Bridger should be  friendly with the Pilgrim; but of these things he said nothing, though  he did find a good deal to say upon pleasanter subjects.    So far as any one knew, Charming Billy Boyle, while he had done many  things, had never before walked boldly into a picnic crowd carrying a  blue parasol as if it were a rifle and keeping step as best he might  over the humps and hollows of the grove with a young woman. Many there  were who turned and looked again--and these were the men who knew him  best. As for Billy, his whole attitude was one of determination; he  was not particularly lover-like--had he wanted to be, he would not  have known how. He was resolved to make the most of his opportunities,  because they were likely to be few and because he had an instinct that  he should know the girl better--he had even dreamed foolishly, once or  twice, of some day marrying her. But to clinch all, he had no notion  of letting the Pilgrim offend her by his presence.    So he somehow got her wedged between two fat women at one of the  tables, and stood behind and passed things impartially and ate ham  sandwiches and other indigestibles during the intervals. He had the  satisfaction of seeing the Pilgrim come within ten feet of them, hover  there scowling for a minute or two and then retreat. \"He ain't forgot  the licking I gave him,\" thought Billy vaingloriously, and hid a smile  in the delectable softness of a wedge of cake with some kind of creamy  filling.    \"_I_ made that cake,\" announced Miss Bridger over her shoulder when  she saw what he was eating. \"Do you like it as well as--chicken stew?\"    Whereupon Billy murmured incoherently and wished the two fat women ten  miles away. He had not dared--he would never have dared--refer to that  night, or mention chicken stew or prune pies or even dried apricots in  her presence; but with her own hand she had brushed aside the veil of  constraint that had hung between them.    \"I wish I'd thought to bring a prune pie,\" he told her daringly, in  his eagerness half strangling over a crumb of cake.    \"Nobody wants prune pie at a picnic,\" declared one of the fat women  sententiously. \"You might as well bring fried bacon and done with it.\"    \"Picnics,\" added the other and fatter woman, \"iss for getting  somet'ings t' eat yuh don'd haff every day at home.\" To point the  moral she reached for a plate of fluted and iced molasses cakes.    \"I _love_ prune pies,\" asserted Miss Bridger, and laughed at the  snorts which came from either side.    Billy felt himself four inches taller just then. \"Give me stewed  prairie-chicken,\" he stooped to murmur in her ear--or, to be exact, in  the blue bow on her hat.    \"Ach, you folks didn'd ought to come to a picnic!\" grunted the fatter  woman in disgust.    The two who had the secret between them laughed confidentially, and  Miss Bridger even turned her head away around so that their eyes could  meet and emphasize the joke.    Billy looked down at the big, blue bow and at the soft, blue ruffly  stuff on her shoulders--stuff that was just thin enough so that one  caught elusive suggestions of the soft, pinky flesh beneath--and  wondered vaguely why he had never noticed the beating in his throat  before--and what would happen if he reached around and tilted back her  chin and--\"Thunder! I guess I've sure got 'em, all right!\" he brought  himself up angrily, and refrained from carrying the subject farther.    It was rumored that the dancing would shortly begin in the schoolhouse  up the hill, and Billy realized suddenly with some compunction that he  had forgotten all about Dill. \"I want to introduce my new boss to  yuh, Miss Bridger,\" he said when they had left the table and she was  smoothing down the ruffly blue stuff in an adorably feminine way. \"He  isn't much just to look at, but he's the whitest man I ever knew. You  wait here a minute and I'll go find him\"--which was a foolish thing  for him to do, as he afterward found out.    For when he had hunted the whole length of the grove, he found  Dill standing like a blasted pine tree in the middle of a circle of  men--men who were married, and so were not wholly taken up with  the feminine element--and he was discoursing to them earnestly and  grammatically upon the capitalistic tendencies of modern politics.  Billy stood and listened long enough to see that there was no hope of  weaning his interest immediately, and then went back to where he had  left Miss Bridger. She was not there. He looked through the nearest  groups, approached one of the fat women, who was industriously  sorting the remains of the feast and depositing the largest and most  attractive pieces of cake in her own basket, and made bold to inquire  if she knew where Miss Bridger had gone.    \"Gone home after some prune pie, I guess maybe,\" she retorted  quellingly, and Billy asked no farther.    Later he caught sight of a blue flutter in the swing; investigated and  saw that it was Miss Bridger, and that the Pilgrim, smiling and with  his hat set jauntily back on his head, was pushing the swing. They did  not catch sight of Billy for he did not linger there. He turned short  around, walked purposefully out to the edge of the grove where his  horse was feeding at the end of his rope, picked up the rope and led  the horse over to where his saddle lay on its side, the neatly folded  saddle-blanket laid across it. \"Darn it, stand still!\" he growled  unjustly, when the horse merely took the liberty of switching a fly  off his rump. Billy picked up the blanket, shook the wrinkles out  mechanically, held it before him ready to lay across the waiting back  of Barney; shook it again, hesitated and threw it violently back upon  the saddle.    \"Go on off--I don't want nothing of yuh,\" he admonished the horse,  which turned and looked at him inquiringly. \"I ain't through yet--I  got another chip to put up.\" He made him a cigarette, lighted it and  strolled nonchalantly back to the grove.          CHAPTER XI.    _\"When I Lift My Eyebrows This Way.\"_           \"Oh, where have you been, Billy boy, Billy boy?       Oh, where have you been, charming Billy?\"    Somewhere behind him a daring young voice was singing. Billy turned  with a real start, and when he saw her coming gayly down a little,  brush-hidden path and knew that she was alone, the heart of him turned  a complete somersault--from the feel of it.    \"My long friend, Dilly, was busy, and so I--I went to look after my  horse,\" he explained, his mind somewhat in a jumble. How came she to  be there, and why did she sing those lines? How did she know that was  _his_ song, or--did she really care at all? And where was the Pilgrim?    \"Mr. Walland and I tried the swing, but I don't like it; it made me  horribly dizzy,\" she said, coming up to him. \"Then I went to find Mama  Joy--\"    \"Who?\" Billy had by that time recovered his wits enough to know just  exactly what she said.    \"Mama Joy--my stepmother. I call her that. You see, father wants me to  call her mama--he really wanted it mother, but I couldn't--and she's  so young to have me for a daughter, so she wants me to call her Joy;  that's her name. So I call her both and please them both, I hope. Did  you ever study diplomacy, Mr. Boyle?\"    \"I never did, but I'm going to start right in,\" Billy told her, and  half meant it.    \"A thorough understanding of the subject is indispensable--when you  have a stepmother--a _young_ stepmother. You've met her, haven't you?\"    \"No,\" said Billy. He did not want to talk about her stepmother, but he  hated to tell her so. \"Er--yes, I believe I did see her once, come to  think of it,\" he added honestly when memory prompted him.    Miss Bridger laughed, stopped, and laughed again. \"How Mama Joy would  _hate_ you if she knew that!\" she exclaimed relishfully.    \"Why?\"    \"Oh, you wait! If ever I tell her that you--that _anybody_ ever met  her "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/12225"],[0,"Tales of lonely trails (#13)"],[1,"out with a crash, and giving the cedar such a  tremendous shaking that Jones lost his footing and fell heavily.    Thrilling as the moment was, I had to laugh, for Jones came up out of  a cloud of dust, as angry as a wet hornet, and made prodigious leaps  to get out of the reach of the whirling lion.    \"Look out!\" he bawled.    Tom, certainly none the worse for his tumble, made three leaps, two at  Jones, one at Jim, which was checked by the short length of the rope  in Emett's hands. Then for a moment, a thick cloud of dust enveloped  the wrestling lion, during which the quick-witted Jones tied the free  end of the lasso to a sapling.    \"Dod gast the luck!\" yelled Jones reaching for another lasso. \"I  didn't mean for you to pull him out of the tree. Now he'll get loose  or kill himself.\"    When the dust cleared away, we discovered our prize stretched out at  full length and frothing at the mouth. As Jones approached, the lion  began a series of evolutions so rapid as to be almost indiscernible to  the eye. I saw a wheel of dust and yellow fur. Then came a thud and  the lion lay inert.    Jones pounced upon him and loosed the lasso around his neck.    \"I think he's done for, but maybe not. He's breathing yet. Here, help  me tie his paws together. Look out! He's coming to!\"    The lion stirred and raised his head. Jones ran the loop of the second  lasso around the two hind paws and stretched the lion out. While in  this helpless position and with no strength and hardly any breath left  in him the lion was easy to handle. With Emett's help Jones quickly  clipped the sharp claws, tied the four paws together, took off the  neck lasso and substituted a collar and chain.    \"There, that's one. He'll come to all right,\" said Jones. \"But we are  lucky. Emett, never pull another lion clear out of a tree. Pull him over  a limb and hang him there while some one below ropes his hind paws.  That's the only way, and if we don't stick to it, somebody is going to  get done for. Come, now, we'll leave this fellow here and hunt up Don  and Jude. They've treed another lion by this time.\"    Remarkable to me was to see how, as soon as the lion lay helpless,  Sounder lost his interest. Moze growled, yet readily left the spot.  Before we reached the level, both hounds had disappeared.    [Illustration: DOWN THE SHINUMO TRAIL OF THE NORTH RIVER]    [Illustration: CAMP AT THE SADDLE]    \"Hear that?\" yelled Jones, digging spurs into his horse. \"Hi! Hi! Hi!\"    From the cedars rang the thrilling, blending chorus of bays that told  of a treed lion. The forest was almost impenetrable. We had to pick  our way. Emett forged ahead; we heard him smashing the deadwood; and  soon a yell proclaimed the truth of Jones' assertion.    First I saw the men looking upward; then Moze climbing the cedar, and  the other hounds with noses skyward; and last, in the dead top of the  tree, a dark blot against the blue, a big tawny lion.    \"Whoop!\" The yell leaped past my lips. Quiet Jim was yelling; and  Emett, silent man of the desert, let from his wide cavernous chest a  booming roar that drowned ours.    Jones' next decisive action turned us from exultation to the grim  business of the thing. He pulled Moze out of the cedar, and while he  climbed up, Emett ran his rope under the collars of all of the hounds.  Quick as the idea flashed over me I leaped into the cedar adjoining  the one Jones was in, and went up hand over hand. A few pulls brought  me to the top, and then my blood ran hot and quick, for I was level  with the lion, too close for comfort, but in excellent position for  taking pictures.    The lion, not heeding me, peered down at Jones, between widespread  paws. I could hear nothing except the hounds. Jones' gray hat came  pushing up between the dead snags; then his burly shoulders. The  quivering muscles of the lion gathered tense, and his lithe body  crouched low on the branches. He was about to jump. His open dripping  jaws, his wild eyes, roving in terror for some means of escape, his  tufted tail, swinging against the twigs and breaking them, manifested  his extremity. The eager hounds waited below, howling, leaping.    It bothered me considerably to keep my balance, regulate my camera  and watch the proceedings. Jones climbed on with his rope between his  teeth, and a long stick. The very next instant it seemed to me, I  heard the cracking of branches and saw the lion biting hard at the  noose which circled his neck.    Here I swung down, branch to branch, and dropped to the ground, for  I wanted to see what went on below. Above the howls and yelps, I  distinguished Jones' yell. Emett ran directly under the lion with a  spread noose in his hands. Jones pulled and pulled, but the lion held  on firmly. Throwing the end of the lasso down to Jim, Jones yelled  again, and then they both pulled. The lion was too strong. Suddenly,  however, the branch broke, letting the lion fall, kicking frantically  with all four paws. Emett grasped one of the four whipping paws, and  even as the powerful animal sent him staggering he dexterously left  the noose fast on the paw. Jim and Jones in unison let go of their  lasso, which streaked up through the branches as the lion fell, and  then it dropped to the ground, where Jim made a flying grab for it.  Jones plunging out of the tree fell upon the rope at the same instant.    If the action up to then had been fast, it was slow to what followed.  It seemed impossible for two strong men with one lasso, and a giant  with another, to straighten out that lion. He was all over the little  space under the trees at once. The dust flew, the sticks snapped,  the gravel pattered like shot against the cedars. Jones ploughed the  ground flat on his stomach, holding on with one hand, with the other  trying to fasten the rope to something; Jim went to his knees; and on  the other side of the lion, Emett's huge bulk tipped a sharp angle,  and then fell.    I shouted and ran forward, having no idea what to do, but Emett rolled  backward, at the same instant the other men got a strong haul on  the lion. Short as that moment was in which the lasso slackened, it  sufficed for Jones to make the rope fast to a tree. Whereupon with the  three men pulling on the other side of the leaping lion, somehow I had  flashed into my mind the game that children play, called skipping the  rope, for the lion and lasso shot up and down.    This lasted for only a few seconds. They stretched the beast from tree  to tree, and Jones running with the third lasso, made fast the front  paws.    \"It's a female,\" said Jones, as the lion lay helpless, her sides  swelling; \"a good-sized female. She's nearly eight feet from tip to  tip, but not very heavy. Hand me another rope.\"    When all four lassos had been stretched, the lioness could not move.  Jones strapped a collar around her neck and clipped the sharp yellow  claws.    \"Now to muzzle her,\" he continued.    Jones' method of performing this most hazardous part of the work was  characteristic of him. He thrust a stick between her open jaws, and  when she crushed it to splinters he tried another, and yet another,  until he found one that she could not break. Then while she bit on it,  he placed a wire loop over her nose, slowly tightening it, leaving the  stick back of her big canines.    The hounds ceased their yelping and when untied, Sounder wagged his  tail as if to say, \"Well done,\" and then lay down; Don walked within  three feet of the lion, as if she were now beneath his dignity; Jude  began to nurse and lick her sore paw; only Moze the incorrigible  retained antipathy for the captive, and he growled, as always, low and  deep. And on the moment, Ranger, dusty and lame from travel, trotted  wearily into the glade and, looking at the lioness, gave one disgusted  bark and flopped down.      III    Transporting our captives to camp bade fair to make us work. When  Jones, who had gone after the pack horses, hove in sight on the sage  flat, it was plain to us that we were in for trouble. The bay stallion  was on the rampage.    \"Why didn't you fetch the Indian?\" growled Emett, who lost his temper  when matters concerning his horses went wrong. \"Spread out, boys, and  head him off.\"    We contrived to surround the stallion, and Emett succeeded in getting  a halter on him.    \"I didn't want the bay,\" explained Jones, \"but I couldn't drive the  others without him. When I told that redskin that we had two lions, he  ran off into the woods, so I had to come alone.\"    \"I'm going to scalp the Navajo,\" said Jim, complacently.    These remarks were exchanged on the open ridge at the entrance to the  thick cedar forest. The two lions lay just within its shady precincts.  Emett and I, using a long pole in lieu of a horse, had carried Tom up  from the Canyon to where we had captured the lioness.    Jones had brought a packsaddle and two panniers.    [Illustration: BUCKSKIN FOREST]    [Illustration: BUFFALO JONES WITH SOUNDER AND RANGER]    When Emett essayed to lead the horse which carried these, the animal  stood straight up and began to show some of his primal desert  instincts. It certainly was good luck that we unbuckled the packsaddle  straps before he left the vicinity. In about three jumps he had  separated himself from the panniers, which were then placed upon the  back of another horse. This one, a fine looking beast, and amiable  under surroundings where his life and health were considered even a  little, immediately disclaimed any intention of entering the forest.    \"They scent the lions,\" said Jones. \"I was afraid of it; never had but  one nag that would pack lions.\"    \"Maybe we can't pack them at all,\" replied Emett dubiously. \"It's  certainly new to me.\"    \"We've got to,\" Jones asserted; \"try the sorrel.\"    For the first time in a serviceable and honorable life, according to  Emett, the sorrel broke his halter and kicked like a plantation mule.    \"It's a matter of fright.
