Catching sight of her reflection in a mirror, she glanced at  herself with a slight smile of recognition, as if she were an old friend  to herself. Her face was oval and calm, her nose a little arched. Her  neck made a beautiful line down to her shoulder. With hair knotted  loosely behind, she had something of a warm, maternal look. Thinking this  of herself, she arched her eyebrows and her rather heavy eyelids, with a  little flicker of a smile, and for a moment her grey eyes looked amused  and wicked, a little sardonic, out of her transfigured Madonna face.    Then, resuming her air of womanly patience--she was really fatally  self-determined--she went with a little jerk towards the door. Her eyes  were slightly reddened.    She passed down the wide hall, and through a door at the end. Then she  was in the farm premises. The scent of dairy, and of farm-kitchen, and of  farm-yard and of leather almost overcame her: but particularly the scent  of dairy. They had been scalding out the pans. The flagged passage in  front of her was dark, puddled and wet. Light came out from the open  kitchen door. She went forward and stood in the doorway. The farm-people  were at tea, seated at a little distance from her, round a long, narrow  table, in the centre of which stood a white lamp. Ruddy faces, ruddy  hands holding food, red mouths working, heads bent over the tea-cups:  men, land-girls, boys: it was tea-time, feeding-time. Some faces caught  sight of her. Mrs. Wernham, going round behind the chairs with a large  black teapot, halting slightly in her walk, was not aware of her for a  moment. Then she turned suddenly.    'Oh, is it Madam!' she exclaimed. 'Come in, then, come in! We're at tea.'  And she dragged forward a chair.    'No, I won't come in,' said Isabel, 'I'm afraid I interrupt your meal.'    'No--no--not likely, Madam, not likely.'    'Hasn't Mr. Pervin come in, do you know?'    'I'm sure I couldn't say! Missed him, have you, Madam?'    'No, I only wanted him to come in,' laughed Isabel, as if shyly.    'Wanted him, did ye? Get you, boy--get up, now--'    Mrs. Wernham knocked one of the boys on the shoulder. He began to scrape  to his feet, chewing largely.    'I believe he's in top stable,' said another face from the table.    'Ah! No, don't get up. I'm going myself,' said Isabel.    'Don't you go out of a dirty night like this. Let the lad go. Get along  wi' ye, boy,' said Mrs. Wernham.    'No, no,' said Isabel, with a decision that was always obeyed. 'Go on  with your tea, Tom. I'd like to go across to the stable, Mrs. Wernham.'    'Did ever you hear tell!' exclaimed the woman.    'Isn't the trap late?' asked Isabel.    'Why, no,' said Mrs. Wernham, peering into the distance at the tall, dim  clock. 'No, Madam--we can give it another quarter or twenty minutes yet,  good--yes, every bit of a quarter.'    'Ah! It seems late when darkness falls so early,' said Isabel.    'It do, that it do. Bother the days, that they draw in so,' answered Mrs.  Wernham.' Proper miserable!'    'They are,' said Isabel, withdrawing.    She pulled on her overshoes, wrapped a large tartan shawl around her, put  on a man's felt hat, and ventured out along the causeways of the first  yard. It was very dark. The wind was roaring in the great elms behind the  outhouses. When she came to the second yard the darkness seemed deeper.  She was unsure of her footing. She wished she had brought a lantern. Rain  blew against her. Half she liked it, half she felt unwilling to battle.    She reached at last the just visible door of the stable. There was no  sign of a light anywhere. Opening the upper half, she looked in: into a  simple well of darkness. The smell of horses, and ammonia, and of warmth  was startling to her, in that full night. She listened with all her ears,  but could hear nothing save the night, and the stirring of a horse.    'Maurice!' she called, softly and musically, though she was afraid.  'Maurice--are you there?'    Nothing came from the darkness. She knew the rain and wind blew in upon  the horses, the hot animal life. Feeling it wrong, she entered the  stable, and drew the lower half of the door shut, holding the upper part  close. She did not stir, because she was aware of the presence of the  dark hindquarters of the horses, though she could not see them, and she  was afraid. Something wild stirred in her heart.    She listened intensely. Then she heard a small noise in the distance--far  away, it seemed--the chink of a pan, and a man's voice speaking a brief  word. It would be Maurice, in the other part of the stable. She stood  motionless, waiting for him to come through the partition door. The  horses were so terrifyingly near to her, in the invisible.    The loud jarring of the inner door-latch made her start; the door was  opened. She could hear and feel her husband entering and invisibly  passing among the horses near to her, in darkness as they were, actively  intermingled. The rather low sound of his voice as he spoke to the horses  came velvety to her nerves. How near he was, and how invisible! The  darkness seemed to be in a strange swirl of violent life, just upon her.  She turned giddy.    Her presence of mind made her call, quietly and musically:    'Maurice! Maurice--dea-ar!'    'Yes,' he answered. 'Isabel?'    She saw nothing, and the sound of his voice seemed to touch her.    'Hello!' she answered cheerfully, straining her eyes to see him. He was  still busy, attending to the horses near her, but she saw only darkness.  It made her almost desperate.    'Won't you come in, dear?' she said.    'Yes, I'm coming. Just half a minute. _Stand over--now_! Trap's not come,  has it?'    'Not yet,' said Isabel.    His voice was pleasant and ordinary, but it had a slight suggestion of  the stable to her. She wished he would come away. Whilst he was so  utterly invisible she was afraid of him.    'How's the time?' he asked.    'Not yet six,' she replied. She disliked to answer into the dark.  Presently he came very near to her, and she retreated out of doors.    'The weather blows in here,' he said, coming steadily forward, feeling  for the doors. She shrank away. At last she could dimly see him.    'Bertie won't have much of a drive,' he said, as he closed the doors.    'He won't indeed!' said Isabel calmly, watching the dark shape at the  door.    'Give me your arm, dear,' she said.    She pressed his arm close to her, as she went. But she longed to see him,  to look at him. She was nervous. He walked erect, with face rather  lifted, but with a curious tentative movement of his powerful, muscular  legs. She could feel the clever, careful, strong contact of his feet with  the earth, as she balanced against him. For a moment he was a tower of  darkness to her, as if he rose out of the earth.    In the house-passage he wavered, and went cautiously, with a curious look  of silence about him as he felt for the bench. Then he sat down heavily.  He was a man with rather sloping shoulders, but with heavy limbs,  powerful legs that seemed to know the earth. His head was small, usually  carried high and light. As he bent down to unfasten his gaiters and boots  he did not look blind. His hair was brown and crisp, his hands were  large, reddish, intelligent, the veins stood out in the wrists; and his  thighs and knees seemed massive. When he stood up his face and neck were  surcharged with blood, the veins stood out on his temples. She did not  look at his blindness.    Isabel was always glad when they had passed through the dividing door  into their own regions of repose and beauty. She was a little afraid of  him, out there in the animal grossness of the back. His bearing also  changed, as he smelt the familiar, indefinable odour that pervaded his  wife's surroundings, a delicate, refined scent, very faintly spicy.  Perhaps it came from the pot-pourri bowls.    He stood at the foot of the stairs, arrested, listening. She watched him,  and her heart sickened. He seemed to be listening to fate.    'He's not here yet,' he said. 'I'll go up and change.'    'Maurice,' she said, 'you're not wishing he wouldn't come, are you?'    'I couldn't quite say,' he answered. 'I feel myself rather on the _qui  vive_.'    'I can see you are,' she answered. And she reached up and kissed his  cheek. She saw his mouth relax into a slow smile.    'What are you laughing at?' she said roguishly.    'You consoling me,' he answered.    'Nay,' she answered. 'Why should I console you? You know we love each  other--you know _how_ married we are! What does anything else matter?'    'Nothing at all, my dear.'    He felt for her face, and touched it, smiling.    '_You're_ all right, aren't you?' he asked, anxiously.    'I'm wonderfully all right, love,' she answered. 'It's you I am a little  troubled about, at times.'    'Why me?' he said, touching her cheeks delicately with the tips of his  fingers. The touch had an almost hypnotizing effect on her.    He went away upstairs. She saw him mount into the darkness, unseeing and  unchanging. He did not know that the lamps on the upper corridor were  unlighted. He went on into the darkness with unchanging step. She heard  him in the bathroom.    Pervin moved about almost unconsciously in his familiar surroundings,  dark though everything was. He seemed to know the presence of objects  before he touched them. It was a pleasure to him to rock thus through a  world of things, carried on the flood in a sort of blood-prescience. He  did not think much or trouble much. So long as he kept this sheer  immediacy of blood-contact with the substantial world he was happy, he  wanted no intervention of visual consciousness. In this state there was a  certain rich positivity, bordering sometimes on rapture. Life seemed to  move in him like a tide lapping, and advancing, enveloping all things  darkly. It was a pleasure to stretch forth the hand and meet the unseen  object,"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/8952"],[0,"Scientific American, Volume 22, No. 1, January 1, 1870 (#12)"],[1,"part of the managers, the oyster is swallowed and the contestants are  each politely handed a shell.    The conditions on which the general test was to be made contained, among  other specifications, these: that \"the water supplied to and evaporated  in the boiler will be measured by means of a meter, and the coal burned  may also be weighed.\"    Only one of the conditions quoted was properly complied with. The coal  was weighed, but though a meter was used to measure the water, tests  made, we are informed, _after the trial of the engines_, showed that  the meter was so inaccurate as to completely invalidate any calculation  based upon its record of the water supplied. Nevertheless this has,  we are credibly informed, been made the basis of calculation; and the  amount of coal consumed during each trial has been rejected either as a  basis of calculation or a check on the inaccuracy of the meter.    Other prescribed regulations were observed with great care. The engines  were indicated in a masterly manner by a gentleman of great experience,  as the cards--tracings of which we have seen--bear ample testimony. The  temperature of the feedwater was 47 degrees; it should, in our opinion,  have been heated, but we waive this point. The state of the barometer  and temperatures of engine room and fire-room were observed; but  we respectfully submit, that with coal consumption left out of the  calculation, and the water consumption an unascertained quantity, the  question of relative economy, the vital point to be settled, is as  uncertain today as it was before the test.    In the _Tribune_ of December 20, appeared a statement of the test to  ascertain the accuracy of the meter used, which showed that in an  aggregate of twelve tests it varied nearly three per cent in its record  from the actual quantity delivered, while at times it was so erratic  that it varied in one instance over _ten per cent_.    Truly, considered in connection with this fundamental error,  temperatures of engine and boiler rooms, and states of barometer, will  not count for much with engineers.    An oversight like this would, however, never have been laid at the door  of the managers, however it might invalidate the test; but when the  utterly absurd decision announced in the papers, after a tedious delay  had led the public to expect an exhaustive statement, gave rise to  general disappointment and excited the utmost dissatisfaction, it became  manifest that a manly, straightforward course on their part was not to  be hoped for, and that any protest against the consummation of the farce  would be vain.    It is not for us to decide on the merits of the engines submitted to  test. It was for the judges to do this. We maintain that nothing that  the public will accept as a decision has been reached, and on behalf of  the public we protest that the managers have not only placed themselves  in a very unenviable position by their action in the premises, but have  done a lasting injury to the American Institute, the results of which  will be disastrously felt in future exhibitions.    The studied ambiguity of the report which awards two first prizes to  the competing engines, is no less apparent than the desire to shun  responsibility.           *       *       *       *       *          A PROTEST AGAINST THE CANADIAN PATENT LAW.      In July, 1869, the New Dominion Patent Law went into operation, but it  has not yet been approved by the Queen, and if rejected the Canadian  Parliament will perhaps try its hand again. Although Canadians may  freely go to all parts of the world and take out patents for their  inventions, they have always manifested a mean spirit and adopted a  narrow policy, in reference to inventors of other nations. Their present  patent laws are so framed as practically to debar all persons except  Canadians from taking patents; and the result is that American and  English inventions are pirated and patented in the Dominion, without so  much as a \"thank you, sir,\" to the _bona fide_ originators.    A protest has been presented to her Majesty's Secretary of State for the  Colonies, asking that the new law may be rejected, on the ground that it  deprives the subjects of the Crown of their equal rights throughout  the empire. There is force in this objection, and Lord Granville has  promised that it shall be duly considered before the Queen is advised to  sign the law.    The probable result will be a revision of the Dominion patent code so as  to let in Englishmen but exclude the Yankees, from whom the Canadians  derive whatever of improvement, progress, and energy they possess.           *       *       *       *       *          THE BRIGHTER SIDE.      Ingratitude seldom enters into the composition of a true inventor, and  nothing in our business career has afforded us more pleasure than the  frequent letters addressed to us by those who have, during more than  twenty years, employed the Scientific American Patent Agency. We cannot  find room for all the pleasant missives that come to us from our  extensive list of clients, but we may give a few as samples of the many.    Mr. Daniel J. Gale, of Sheboygan, Wis., has recently secured through our  Agency Letters Patent for a \"Perpetual and Lunar Calendar Clock.\" In the  fullness of his satisfaction he thus writes: \"The fact is, I shall never  be able to thank you sufficiently for what you have done for me. I  sent you a copy of the paper printed here, which favorably notices my  improvement and your great Agency. The fees charged me for my patent  have been low enough. Already, by one of my own townsmen, I have been  offered $4,000 for my interest in the patent. But I must not take up too  much of your I time. Please allow me to add that I regularly receive  your valuable paper, the SCIENTIFIC AMERICAN, and that you may number me  as one of its stanch friends.\"    Mr. Edwin Norton, of Brooklyn, N.Y., in a recent note, says: \"Allow me  to express my thanks for the promptness and efficiency with which the  business of obtaining a patent for my 'Cinder and Dust Arrester' has  been conducted through your Agency--and not only in this case but in  several previous ones. This is the _fourth_ patent obtained by me  through four Agency within nine months. It gives me pleasure to add my  testimony to that of many others, with respect to the very satisfactory  manner in which your Patent Agency is conducted.\"    Mr. E. J. Marstens says, in reference to his improved \"Field Press\"--\"I  find everything correct. You certainly accomplished more than I expected  after the first examination by the Primary Examiner. I hope soon to be  able to give you another case.\"    Mr. S. P. Williams, an old client, writes as follows: \"I received the  patent on my 'Trace Lock for Whiffletrees,' and I am truly pleased with  the prompt manner in which you have done the business. It is only a few  weeks since I made the application, and I expected that it would be as  many months before the patent could be granted.\"           *       *       *       *       *          PROFESSOR FISKE'S LECTURES AT HARVARD.      It certainly argues well for the intellectual character of the readers  of the New York _World_ that during the prevalent taste for sensational  journalism, it has found the publication of a series of philosophical  lectures acceptable. We thank our neighbor for thus making these  lectures available to the general public. Their ability is  unquestionable; and the calmness and candor which Professor Fiske brings  to the treatment of the subject is such as to add greatly to the force  of his logic.    The \"positive philosophy\" has been shown by Professor Fiske to be much  misunderstood, misapprehension not being confined solely to the ranks of  its opponents.    His exposition of some of the misconceptions on which Professor Huxley  has based some criticisms upon the writings of Comte, strikes us as  especially forcible; and the whole course of lectures proves Professor  Fiske to be one of the clearest and most able of American thinkers.    These lectures are followed as they appear, with great interest, and  their publication in the World we regard as a real and permanent benefit  to the public.           *       *       *       *       *          SCIENTIFIC LECTURES BEFORE THE AMERICAN INSTITUTE.      The announcement of these lectures came to hand too late for our last  issue, and the first has already been delivered. The course is as  follows: Friday, Dec. 17, The Battle Fields of Science, by Andrew D.  White, President of the Cornell University, Ithaca, N.Y. Friday, Dec.  24, How Animals Move, by Professor E. S. Morse, of the Peabody Academy  of Science, Salem, Mass. Friday, Dec. 31, The Correlation of Vital and  Physical Forces, by Professor G. F. Barker, of Yale College, New Haven.  Friday, Jan. 7, The Air and Respiration, by Professor J. C. Draper, of  the College of the City of New York. Friday, Jan. 14, The Connection  of Natural Science and Mental Philosophy, by Professor J. Bascom, of  Williams College, Williamstown, Mass. Friday, Jan. 21, The Constitution  of the Sun, by Dr. B. A. Gould, of Cambridge, Mass. Friday, Jan. 28,  The Colorado Plateau, its Canyons and Ruined Cities, by Professor J. S.  Newberry, of Columbia College, New York.    The course is a good one, and ought to be, and doubtless will be, well  attended.

This lecture did not disappoint the expectations of those familiar with  the subject of the discourse, which, considering the difficulty of  restating familiar historical facts in such a manner as to clothe them  in a garb of originality, is high praise. Many, however, found great  difficulty in hearing the speaker at the back part of the hall, and "]]]
