In the fifth century before Christ, an Indo-European people called the  Persians (I shall tell you about them later) left its pastures amidst  the high mountains of Iran and conquered the fertile valley.    The city of Babylon was captured without a struggle.    Nabonidus, the last Babylonian king, who had been more interested in  religious problems than in defending his own country, fled.    A few days later his small son, who had remained behind, died.    Cyrus, the Persian King, buried the child with great honor and then  proclaimed himself the legitimate successor of the old rulers of  Babylonia.    Mesopotamia ceased to be an independent State.    It became a Persian province ruled by a Persian \"Satrap\" or Governor.    As for Babylon, when the Kings no longer used the city as their  residence it soon lost all importance and became a mere country village.    In the fourth century before Christ it enjoyed another spell of glory.    It was in the year 331 B.C. that Alexander the Great, the young Greek  who had just conquered Persia and India and Egypt and every other place,  visited the ancient city of sacred memories. He wanted to use the old  city as a background for his own newly-acquired glory. He began to  rebuild the palace and ordered that the rubbish be removed from  the temples.    Unfortunately he died quite suddenly in the Banqueting Hall of  Nebuchadnezzar and after that nothing on earth could save Babylon  from her ruin.    As soon as one of Alexander's generals, Seleucus Nicator, had perfected  the plans for a new city at the mouth of the great canal which united  the Tigris and the Euphrates, the fate of Babylon was sealed.    A tablet of the year 275 B.C. tells us how the last of the Babylonians  were forced to leave their home and move into this new settlement which  had been called Seleucia.    Even then, a few of the faithful continued to visit the holy places  which were now inhabited by wolves and jackals.    The majority of the people, little interested in those half-forgotten  divinities of a bygone age, made a more practical use of their  former home.    They used it as a stone-quarry.    For almost thirty centuries Babylon had been the great spiritual and  intellectual center of the Semitic world and a hundred generations had  regarded the city as the most perfect expression of their  people's genius.    It was the Paris and London and New York of the ancient world.    At present three large mounds show us where the ruins lie buried beneath  the sand of the ever-encroaching desert.        THIS IS THE STORY OF MOSES    High above the thin line of the distant horizon there appeared a small  cloud of dust. The Babylonian peasant, working his poor farm on the  outskirts of the fertile lands, noticed it.    \"Another tribe is trying to break into our land,\" he said to himself.  \"They will not get far. The King's soldiers will drive them away.\"    He was right. The frontier guards welcomed the new arrivals with drawn  swords and bade them try their luck elsewhere.    They moved westward following the borders of the land of Babylon and  they wandered until they reached the shores of the Mediterranean.    There they settled down and tended their flocks and lived the simple  lives of their earliest ancestors who had dwelt in the land of Ur.    Then there came a time when the rain ceased to fall and there was not  enough to eat for man or beast and it became necessary to look for new  pastures or perish on the spot.    Once more the shepherds (who were called the Hebrews) moved their  families into a new home which they found along the banks of the Red Sea  near the land of Egypt.    But hunger and want had followed them upon their voyage and they were  forced to go to the Egyptian officials and beg for food that they might  not starve.    The Egyptians had long expected a famine. They had built large  store-houses and these were all filled with the surplus wheat of the  last seven years. This wheat was now being distributed among the people  and a food-dictator had been appointed to deal it out equally to the  rich and to the poor. His name was Joseph and he belonged to the tribe  of the Hebrews.    As a mere boy he had run away from his own family. It was said that he  had escaped to save himself from the anger of his brethren who envied  him because he was the favorite of their Father.    Whatever the truth, Joseph had gone to Egypt and he had found favor in  the eyes of the Hyksos Kings who had just conquered the country and who  used this bright young man to assist them in administering their new  possessions.    As soon as the hungry Hebrews appeared before Joseph with their request  for help, Joseph recognized his relatives.    But he was a generous man and all meanness of spirit was foreign to his  soul.    He did not revenge himself upon those who had wronged him but he gave  them wheat and allowed them to settle in the land of Egypt, they and  their children and their flocks--and be happy.    For many years the Hebrews (who are more commonly known as the Jews)  lived in the eastern part of their adopted country and all was well  with them.    Then a great change took place.    A sudden revolution deprived the Hyksos Kings of their power and forced  them to leave the country. Once more the Egyptians were masters within  their own house. They had never liked foreigners any too well. Three  hundred years of oppression by a band of Arab shepherds had greatly  increased this feeling of loathing for everything that was alien.    [Illustration: MOSES.]    The Jews on the other hand had been on friendly terms with the Hyksos  who were related to them by blood and by race. This was enough to make  them traitors in the eyes of the Egyptians.    Joseph no longer lived to protect his people.    After a short struggle they were taken away from their old homes, they  were driven into the heart of the country and they were treated  like slaves.    For many years they performed the dreary tasks of common laborers,  carrying stones for the building of pyramids, making bricks for public  buildings, constructing roads, and digging canals to carry the water of  the Nile to the distant Egyptian farms.    Their suffering was great but they never lost courage and help was near.    There lived a certain young man whose name was Moses. He was very  intelligent and he had received a good education because the Egyptians  had decided that he should enter the service of Pharaoh.    If nothing had happened to arouse his anger, Moses would have ended his  days peacefully as the governor of a small province or the collector of  taxes of an outlying district.    But the Egyptians, as I have told you before, despised those who did not  look like themselves nor dress in true Egyptian fashion and they were  apt to insult such people because they were \"different.\"    And because the foreigners were in the minority they could not well  defend themselves. Nor did it serve any good purpose to carry their  complaints before a tribunal for the Judge did not smile upon the  grievances of a man who refused to worship the Egyptian gods and who  pleaded his case with a strong foreign accent.    Now it occurred one day that Moses was taking a walk with a few of his  Egyptian friends and one of these said something particularly  disagreeable about the Jews and even threatened to lay hands on them.    Moses, who was a hot-headed youth hit him.    The blow was a bit too severe and the Egyptian fell down dead.    To kill a native was a terrible thing and the Egyptian laws were not as  wise as those of Hammurapi, the good Babylonian King, who recognized the  difference between a premeditated murder and the killing of a man whose  insults had brought his opponent to a point of unreasoning rage.    Moses fled.    He escaped into the land of his ancestors, into the Midian desert, along  the eastern bank of the Red Sea, where his tribe had tended their sheep  several hundred years before.    A kind priest by the name of Jethro received him in his house and gave  him one of his seven daughters, Zipporah, as his wife.    There Moses lived for a long time and there he pondered upon many deep  subjects. He had left the luxury and the comfort of the palace of  Pharaoh to share the rough and simple life of a desert priest.    In the olden days, before the Jewish people had moved into Egypt, they  too had been wanderers among the endless plains of Arabia. They had  lived in tents and they had eaten plain food, but they had been honest  men and faithful women, contented with few possessions but proud of the  righteousness of their mind.    All this had been changed after they had become exposed to the  civilization of Egypt. They had taken to the ways of the comfort-loving  Egyptians. They had allowed another race to rule them and they had not  cared to fight for their independence.    Instead of the old gods of the wind-swept desert they had begun to  worship strange divinities who lived in the glimmering splendors of the  dark Egyptian temples.    Moses felt that it was his duty to go forth and save his people from  their fate and bring them back to the simple Truth of the olden days.    And so he sent messengers to his relatives and suggested that they leave  the land of slavery and join him in the desert.    But the Egyptians heard of this and guarded the Jews more carefully than  ever before.    It seemed that the plans of Moses were doomed to failure when suddenly  an epidemic broke out among the people of the Nile Valley.    The Jews who had always obeyed certain very strict laws of health (which  they had learned in the hardy days of their desert life) escaped the  disease while the weaker Egyptians died by the hundreds of thousands.    Amidst the confusion and the panic which followed this Silent Death, the  Jews packed their belongings and hastily fled from the land which had  promised them so much and "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/10002"],[0,"The House on the Borderland (#13)"],[1,"that it was the same place, so greatly  was it changed. The dark, wooded ravine of a fortnight ago, with a  foliage-hidden stream, running sluggishly, at the bottom, existed no  longer. Instead, my eyes showed me a ragged chasm, partly filled with a  gloomy lake of turbid water. All one side of the ravine was stripped of  underwood, showing the bare rock.    A little to my left, the side of the Pit appeared to have collapsed  altogether, forming a deep V-shaped cleft in the face of the rocky  cliff. This rift ran, from the upper edge of the ravine, nearly down to  the water, and penetrated into the Pit side, to a distance of some forty  feet. Its opening was, at least, six yards across; and, from this, it  seemed to taper into about two. But, what attracted my attention, more  than even the stupendous split itself, was a great hole, some distance  down the cleft, and right in the angle of the V. It was clearly defined,  and not unlike an arched doorway in shape; though, lying as it did in  the shadow, I could not see it very distinctly.    The opposite side of the Pit, still retained its verdure; but so torn  in places, and everywhere covered with dust and rubbish, that it was  hardly distinguishable as such.    My first impression, that there had been a land slip, was, I began to  see, not sufficient, of itself, to account for all the changes I  witnessed. And the water--? I turned, suddenly; for I had become aware  that, somewhere to my right, there was a noise of running water. I could  see nothing; but, now that my attention had been caught, I  distinguished, easily, that it came from somewhere at the East end  of the Pit.    Slowly, I made my way in that direction; the sound growing plainer as I  advanced, until in a little, I stood right above it. Even then, I could  not perceive the cause, until I knelt down, and thrust my head over the  cliff. Here, the noise came up to me, plainly; and I saw, below me, a  torrent of clear water, issuing from a small fissure in the Pit side,  and rushing down the rocks, into the lake beneath. A little further  along the cliff, I saw another, and, beyond that again, two smaller  ones. These, then, would help to account for the quantity of water in  the Pit; and, if the fall of rock and earth had blocked the outlet of  the stream at the bottom, there was little doubt but that it was  contributing a very large share.    Yet, I puzzled my head to account for the generally _shaken_ appearance  of the place--these streamlets, and that huge cleft, further up the  ravine! It seemed to me, that more than the landslip was necessary to  account for these. I could imagine an earthquake, or a great  _explosion_, creating some such condition of affairs as existed; but, of  these, there had been neither. Then, I stood up, quickly, remembering  that crash, and the cloud of dust that had followed, directly, rushing  high into the air. But I shook my head, unbelievingly. No! It must have  been the noise of the falling rocks and earth, I had heard; of course,  the dust would fly, naturally. Still, in spite of my reasoning, I had an  uneasy feeling, that this theory did not satisfy my sense of the  probable; and yet, was any other, that I could suggest, likely to be  half so plausible? Pepper had been sitting on the grass, while I  conducted my examination. Now, as I turned up the North side of the  ravine, he rose and followed.    Slowly, and keeping a careful watch in all directions, I made the  circuit of the Pit; but found little else, that I had not already seen.  From the West end, I could see the four waterfalls, uninterruptedly.  They were some considerable distance up from the surface of the  lake--about fifty feet, I calculated.    For a little while longer, I loitered about; keeping my eyes and ears  open, but still, without seeing or hearing anything suspicious. The  whole place was wonderfully quiet; indeed, save for the continuous  murmur of the water, at the top end, no sound, of any description, broke  the silence.    All this while, Pepper had shown no signs of uneasiness. This seemed,  to me, to indicate that, for the time being, at least, there was none of  the Swine-creatures in the vicinity. So far as I could see, his  attention appeared to have been taken, chiefly, with scratching and  sniffing among the grass at the edge of the Pit. At times, he would  leave the edge, and run along toward the house, as though following  invisible tracks; but, in all cases, returning after a few minutes. I  had little doubt but that he was really tracing out the footsteps of the  Swine-things; and the very fact that each one seemed to lead him back to  the Pit, appeared to me, a proof that the brutes had all returned whence  they came.    At noon, I went home, for dinner. During the afternoon, I made a  partial search of the gardens, accompanied by Pepper; but, without  coming upon anything to indicate the presence of the creatures.    Once, as we made our way through the shrubberies, Pepper rushed in  among some bushes, with a fierce yelp. At that, I jumped back, in sudden  fright, and threw my gun forward, in readiness; only to laugh,  nervously, as Pepper reappeared, chasing an unfortunate cat. Toward  evening, I gave up the search, and returned to the house. All at once,  as we were passing a great clump of bushes, on our right, Pepper  disappeared, and I could hear him sniffing and growling among them, in a  suspicious manner. With my gun barrel, I parted the intervening  shrubbery, and looked inside. There was nothing to be seen, save that  many of the branches were bent down, and broken; as though some animal  had made a lair there, at no very previous date. It was probably, I  thought, one of the places occupied by some of the Swine-creatures, on  the night of the attack.    Next day, I resumed my search through the gardens; but without result.  By evening, I had been right through them, and now, I knew, beyond the  possibility of doubt, that there were no longer any of the Things  concealed about the place. Indeed, I have often thought since, that I  was correct in my earlier surmise, that they had left soon after  the attack.        _XII_    THE SUBTERRANEAN PIT    Another week came and went, during which I spent a great deal of my time  about the Pit mouth. I had come to the conclusion a few days earlier,  that the arched hole, in the angle of the great rift, was the place  through which the Swine-things had made their exit, from some unholy  place in the bowels of the world. How near the probable truth this went,  I was to learn later.    It may be easily understood, that I was tremendously curious, though in  a frightened way, to know to what infernal place that hole led; though,  so far, the idea had not struck me, seriously, of making an  investigation. I was far too much imbued with a sense of horror of the  Swine-creatures, to think of venturing, willingly, where there was any  chance of coming into contact with them.    Gradually, however, as time passed, this feeling grew insensibly less;  so that when, a few days later, the thought occurred to me that it might  be possible to clamber down and have a look into the hole, I was not so  exceedingly averse to it, as might have been imagined. Still, I do not  think, even then, that I really intended to try any such foolhardy  adventure. For all that I could tell, it might be certain death, to  enter that doleful looking opening. And yet, such is the pertinacity of  human curiosity, that, at last, my chief desire was but to discover what  lay beyond that gloomy entrance.    Slowly, as the days slid by, my fear of the Swine-things became an  emotion of the past--more an unpleasant, incredible memory, than  aught else.    Thus, a day came, when, throwing thoughts and fancies adrift, I  procured a rope from the house, and, having made it fast to a stout  tree, at the top of the rift, and some little distance back from the Pit  edge, let the other end down into the cleft, until it dangled right  across the mouth of the dark hole.    Then, cautiously, and with many misgivings as to whether it was not a  mad act that I was attempting, I climbed slowly down, using the rope as  a support, until I reached the hole. Here, still holding on to the rope,  I stood, and peered in. All was perfectly dark, and not a sound came to  me. Yet, a moment later, it seemed that I could hear something. I held  my breath, and listened; but all was silent as the grave, and I breathed  freely once more. At the same instant, I heard the sound again. It was  like a noise of labored breathing--deep and sharp-drawn. For a short  second, I stood, petrified; not able to move. But now the sounds had  ceased again, and I could hear nothing.    As I stood there, anxiously, my foot dislodged a pebble, which fell  inward, into the dark, with a hollow chink. At once, the noise was taken  up and repeated a score of times; each succeeding echo being fainter,  and seeming to travel away from me, as though into remote distance.  Then, as the silence fell again, I heard that stealthy breathing. For  each respiration I made, I could hear an answering breath. The sounds  appeared to be coming nearer; and then, I heard several others; but  fainter and more distant. Why I did not grip the rope, and spring up out  of danger, I cannot say. It was as though I had been paralyzed. I broke  out into a profuse sweat, and tried to moisten my lips with my tongue.  My throat had gone suddenly dry, and I coughed, huskily. It came back to  me, in a dozen, horrible, throaty tones, mockingly. I peered,  helplessly, into the gloom; but still nothing showed. I had a strange,  choky sensation, and again I coughed, dryly. Again the echo took it up,  rising and falling, grotesquely, and dying slowly into a  muffled silence.    Then, suddenly, a thought came to me, and I held my breath. The other  breathing stopped. I breathed again, and, once more, it re-commenced.  But now, I no"]]]
