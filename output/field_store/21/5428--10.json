For the Spaniards which you had with you here, the  last year, have bewrayed the place and taken away all that you left  here. I depart hence, this present 7th of July, 1572. Your very loving  friend, John Garrett.' That was fourteen days before. Drake, however,  was determined to carry out his plan. So he built a fort and set up his  pinnaces. But others had now found the secret harbor; for in came three  sail under Ranse, an Englishman, who asked that he be taken into  partnership, which was done.    Then the combined forces, not much over a hundred strong, stole out and  along the coast to the Isle of Pines, where again Drake found himself  forestalled. From the negro crews of two Spanish vessels he discovered  that, only six weeks earlier, the Maroons had annihilated a Spanish  force on the Isthmus and nearly taken Nombre de Dios itself. These  Maroons were the descendants of escaped negro slaves intermarried with  the most warlike of the Indians. They were regular desperadoes, always,  and naturally, at war with the Spaniards, who treated them as vermin to  be killed at sight. Drake put the captured negroes ashore to join the  Maroons, with whom he always made friends. Then with seventy-three  picked men he made his dash for Nombre de Dios, leaving the rest under  Ranse to guard the base.    Nombre de Dios was the Atlantic terminus, as Panama was the Pacific  terminus, of the treasure trail across the Isthmus of Darien. The  Spaniards, knowing nothing of Cape Horn, and unable to face the  appalling dangers of Magellan's straits, used to bring the Peruvian  treasure ships to Panama, whence the treasure was taken across the  isthmus to Nombre de Dios by _recuas_, that is, by mule trains under  escort.    At evening Drake's vessel stood off the harbor of Nombre de Dios and  stealthily approached unseen. It was planned to make the landing in the  morning. A long and nerve-racking wait ensued. As the hours dragged on,  Drake felt instinctively that his younger men were getting demoralized.  They began to whisper about the size of the town--'as big as  Plymouth'--with perhaps a whole battalion of the famous Spanish  infantry, and so on. It wanted an hour of the first real streak of dawn.  But just then the old moon sent a ray of light quivering in on the tide.  Drake instantly announced the dawn, issued the orders: 'Shove off, out  oars, give way!' Inside the bay a ship just arrived from sea was picking  up her moorings. A boat left her side and pulled like mad for the wharf.  But Drake's men raced the Spaniards, beat them, and made them sheer off  to a landing some way beyond the town.    Springing eagerly ashore the Englishmen tumbled the Spanish guns off  their platforms while the astonished sentry ran for dear life. In five  minutes the church bells were pealing out their wild alarms, trumpet  calls were sounding, drums were beating round the general parade, and  the civilians of the place, expecting massacre at the hands of the  Maroons, were rushing about in agonized confusion. Drake's men fell  in--they were all well-drilled--and were quickly told off into three  detachments. The largest under Drake, the next under Oxenham--the hero  of Kingsley's _Westward Ho!_--and the third, of twelve men only, to  guard the pinnaces. Having found that the new fort on the hill  commanding the town was not yet occupied, Drake and Oxenham marched  against the town at the head of their sixty men, Oxenham by a flank,  Drake straight up the main street, each with a trumpet sounding, a drum  rolling, fire-pikes blazing, swords flashing, and all ranks yelling like  fiends. Drake was only of medium stature. But he had the strength of a  giant, the pluck of a bulldog, the spring of a tiger, and the cut of a  man that is born to command. Broad-browed, with steel-blue eyes and  close-cropped auburn hair and beard, he was all kindliness of  countenance to friends, but a very 'Dragon' to his Spanish foes.    As Drake's men reached the Plaza, his trumpeter blew one blast of  defiance and then fell dead. Drake returned the Spanish volley and  charged immediately, the drummer beating furiously, pikes levelled, and  swords brandished. The Spaniards did not wait for him to close; for  Oxenham's party, fire-pikes blazing, were taking them in flank. Out went  the Spaniards through the Panama gate, with screaming townsfolk  scurrying before them. Bang went the gate, now under English guard, as  Drake made for the Governor's house. There lay a pile of silver bars  such as his men had never dreamt of: in all, about four hundred tons of  silver ready for the homeward fleet--enough not only to fill but sink  the _Pascha_, _Swan_, and pinnaces. But silver was then no more to Drake  than it was once to Solomon. What he wanted were the diamonds and pearls  and gold, which were stored, he learned, in the King's Treasure House  beside the bay.    A terrific storm now burst. The fire-pikes and arquebuses had to be  taken under cover. The wall of the King's Treasure House defied all  efforts to breach it. And the Spaniards who had been shut into the  town, discovering how few the English were, reformed for attack. Some of  Drake's men began to lose heart. But in a moment he stepped to the front  and ordered Oxenham to go round and smash in the Treasure House gate  while he held the Plaza himself. Just as the men stepped off, however,  he reeled aside and fell. He had fainted from loss of blood caused by a  wound he had managed to conceal. There was no holding the men now. They  gave him a cordial, after which he bound up his leg, for he was a  first-rate surgeon, and repeated his orders as before. But there were a  good many wounded; and, with Drake no longer able to lead, the rest all  begged to go back. So back to their boats they went, and over to the  Bastimentos or Victualling Islands, which contained the gardens and  poultry runs of the Nombre de Dios citizens.    Here they were visited, under a flag of truce, by the Spanish officer  commanding the reinforcement just sent across from Panama. He was all  politeness, airs, and graces, while trying to ferret out the secret of  their real strength. Drake, however, was not to be outdone either in  diplomacy or war; and a delightful little comedy of prying and veiling  courtesies was played out, to the great amusement of the English  sea-dogs. Finally, when the time agreed upon was up, the Spanish officer  departed, pouring forth a stream of high-flown compliments, which Drake,  who was a Spanish scholar, answered with the like. Waving each other a  ceremonious adieu the two leaders were left no wiser than before.    Nombre de Dios, now strongly reinforced and on its guard, was not an  easy nut to crack. But Panama? Panama meant a risky march inland and a  still riskier return by the regular treasure trail. But with the help of  the Maroons, who knew the furtive byways to a foot, the thing might yet  be done. Ranse thought the game not worth the candle and retired from  the partnership, much to Drake's delight.    A good preliminary stroke was made by raiding Cartagena. Here Drake  found a frigate deserted by its crew, who had gone ashore to see fair  play in a duel fought about a seaman's mistress. The old man left in  charge confessed that a Seville ship was round the point. Drake cut her  out at once, in spite of being fired at from the shore. Next, in came  two more Spanish sail to warn Cartagena that 'Captain Drake has been at  Nombre de Dios and taken it, and if a blest bullet hadn't hit him in the  leg he would have sacked it too.'    Cartagena, however, was up in arms already; so Drake put all his  prisoners ashore unhurt and retired to reconsider his position, leaving  Diego, a negro fugitive from Nombre de Dios, to muster the Maroons for a  raid overland to Panama. Then Drake, who sank the _Swan_ and burnt his  prizes because he had only men enough for the _Pascha_ and the pinnaces,  disappeared into a new secret harbor. But his troubles were only  beginning; for word came that the Maroons said that nothing could be  done inland till the rains were over, five months hence. This meant a  long wait; however, what with making supply depots and picking up prizes  here and there, the wet time might pass off well enough.    One day Oxenham's crew nearly mutinied over the shortness of provisions.  'Have ye not as much as I,' Drake called to them, 'and has God's  Providence ever failed us yet?' Within an hour a Spanish vessel hove in  sight, making such very heavy weather of it that boarding her was out of  the question. But 'We spent not two hours in attendance till it pleased  God to send us a reasonable calm, so that we might use our guns and  approach her at pleasure. We found her laden with victuals, which we  received as sent of God's great mercy.' Then 'Yellow Jack' broke out,  and the men began to fall sick and die. The company consisted of  seventy-three men; and twenty-eight of these perished of the fever,  among them the surgeon himself and Drake's own brother.    But on the 3d of February, 1573, Drake was ready for the dash on Panama.  Leaving behind about twenty-five men to guard the base, he began the  overland march with a company of fifty, all told, of whom thirty-one  were picked Maroons. The fourth day out Drake climbed a forest giant on  the top of the Divide, saw the Atlantic behind him and the Pacific far  in front, and vowed that if he lived he would sail an English ship over  the great South Sea. Two days more and the party left the protecting  forest for the rolling pampas where the risk of being seen increased at  every step. Another day's march and Panama was sighted as they topped  the crest of one of the bigger waves of ground. A clever Maroon went  ahead to spy out the situation and returned to say that two _recuas_  would leave at dusk, one coming from Venta Cruz, fifteen miles northwest  of"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/12888"],[0,"The German Classics of the Nineteenth and Twentieth Centuries, Volume 05 (#13)"],[1,"unchangeably determined, and upon which one may reckon with infallible  security, as the mortal reckons securely on the laws of his world.  A Will in which the lawful will of finite beings has inevitable  consequences, but only their will, which is immovable to everything  else, and for which everything else is as though it were not.    That sublime Will, therefore, does not pursue its course for itself,  apart from the rest of Reason's world. There is between it and all  finite, rational beings, a spiritual tie, and that Will itself is  this spiritual tie of Reason's world. I will, purely and decidedly, my  duty, and it then wills that I shall succeed, at least in the world of  spirits. Every lawful resolve of the finite will enters into it,  and moves and determines it--to speak after our fashion--not in  consequence of a momentary good pleasure, but in consequence of the  eternal law of its being.    With astounding clearness it now stands before my soul, the thought  which hitherto had been wrapped in darkness--the thought that my will,  merely as such, and of itself, has consequences. It has consequences  because it is infallibly and immediately taken knowledge of by another  related Will, which is itself an act and the only life-principle of  the spiritual world. In that Will it has its first consequence, and  only through that, in the rest of the spiritual world which, in all  its parts, is but the product of that infinite Will.    Thus I flow--the mortal must use the language of mortals--thus I flow  in upon that Will; and the voice of conscience in my inmost being,  which, in every situation of my life, instructs me what I have to do  in that situation, is that by means of which it, in turn, flows  in upon me. That voice is the oracle from the eternal world, made  sensible by my environment, and translated, by my reception of it,  into my language; which announces to me how I must fit myself to my  part in the order of the spiritual world, or to the infinite Will,  which itself is the order of that spiritual world. I cannot oversee or  see through this spiritual order; nor need I. I am only a link in its  chain, and can no more judge of the whole than a single tone in a song  can judge of the harmony of the whole. But what I myself should be, in  the harmony of Spirits, I must know; for only I myself can make myself  that, and it is immediately revealed to me by a voice which sounds  over to me from that world. Thus I stand in connection with the only  being that _exists_, and partake of its being. There is nothing truly  real, permanent, imperishable in me, but these two--the voice of my  conscience and my free obedience. By means of the first, the spiritual  world bows down to me and embraces me, as one of its members. By means  of the second, I raise myself into this world, lay hold of it, and  work in it. But that infinite Will is the mediator between it and me;  for, of it and me, that Will is the primal fountain. This is the only  true and imperishable reality, toward which my soul moves from its  inmost depth. All else is only phenomenon, and vanishes and returns  again, with new seeming.    This Will connects me with itself. The same connects me with all  finite beings of my species, and is the universal mediator between  us all. That is the great mystery of the invisible world, and  its fundamental law, so far as it is a world or system of several  individual wills: _Union and direct reciprocal action of several  self-subsisting and independent wills among one another_--a mystery  which, even in the present life, lies clear before all eyes, without  any one's noticing it or thinking it worthy his admiration! The voice  of Conscience, which enjoins upon each one his proper duty, is the ray  by which we proceed from the Infinite and are set forth as individual  particular beings. It defines the boundaries of our personality; it  is, therefore, our true original constituent, the foundation and the  stuff of all the life which we live.           *       *       *       *       *    That eternal Will, then, is indeed world-creator, as he alone can  be--in the finite reason (the only creation which is needed). They who  suppose him to build a world out of eternal inert matter, which world,  in that case, could be nothing else but inert and lifeless, like  implements fashioned by human hands and not an eternal process of  self-development, or who think they can imagine the going forth of a  material something out of nothing, know neither the world nor him. If  matter only is something, then there is nowhere anything, and nowhere,  in all eternity, can anything be. Only Reason _is_: the infinite  reason in itself, and the finite in and through the infinite. Only in  our minds does he create the world, or, at least, that from which we  unfold it, and that whereby we unfold it--the call to duty, and the  feelings, perceptions and laws of thought agreeing therewith. It is  _his_ light whereby we see light and all that appears to us in that  light. In our minds he is continually fashioning this world, and  interposing in it by interposing in our minds with the call of duty,  whenever another free agent effects a change therein. In our minds he  maintains this world, and, therewith, our finite existence, of which  alone we are capable, in that he causes to arise out of our states new  states continually. After he has proved us sufficiently for our next  destination, according to his higher aim, and when we shall have  cultivated ourselves for the same, he will annihilate this world for  us by what we call death, and introduce us into a new one, the product  of our dutiful action in this. All our life is his life. We are in  his hand, and remain in it, and no one can pluck us out of it. We are  eternal because he is eternal.    Sublime, living Will, whom no name can name, and whom no conception  can grasp!--well may I raise my mind to thee, for thou and I are not  divided. Thy voice sounds in me, and mine sounds back in thee; and all  my thoughts, if only they are true and good, are thought in thee. In  thee, the Incomprehensible, I become comprehensible to myself, and  entirely comprehend the world. All the riddles of my existence are  solved, and the most perfect harmony arises in my mind.    Thou art best apprehended by childlike simplicity, devoted to thee.  To it thou art the heart-searcher who lookest through its innermost  thoughts; the all-present, faithful witness of its sentiments, who  alone knowest that it meaneth well, and who alone understandest it,  when misunderstood by all the world. Thou art to it a Father, whose  purposes toward it are ever kind, and who will order everything for  its best good. It submitteth itself wholly, with body and soul, to thy  beneficent decrees. Do with me as thou wilt, it saith, I know that it  shall be good, so surely as it is thou that dost it. The speculative  understanding, which has only heard of thee but has never seen thee,  would teach us to know thy being in itself, and sets before us an  inconsistent monster which it gives out for thine image, ridiculous to  the merely knowing, hateful and detestable to the wise and good.    I veil my face before thee and lay my hand upon my mouth. How thou art  in thyself, and how thou appearest to thyself, I can never know,  as surely as I can never be thou. After thousand times thousand  spirit-lives lived through, I shall no more be able to comprehend thee  than now, in this hut of earth. That which I comprehend becomes, by my  comprehension of it, finite; and this can never, by an endless process  of magnifying and exalting, be changed into infinite. Thou differest  from the finite, not only in degree but in kind. By that magnifying  process they make thee only a greater and still greater man, but never  God, the Infinite, incapable of measure.           *       *       *       *       *    I will not attempt that which is denied to me by my finite nature,  and which could avail me nothing. I desire not to know how thou art  in thyself. But thy relations and connections with me, the finite,  and with all finite beings, lie open to mine eye, when I become what  I should be. They encompass me with a more luminous clearness than the  consciousness of my own being. Thou workest in me the knowledge of my  duty, of my destination in the series of rational beings. How? I know  not, and need not to know. Thou knowest and perceivest what I think  and will. How thou canst know it--by what act thou bringest this  consciousness to pass--on that point I comprehend nothing. Yea, I know  very well that the idea of an act, of a special act of consciousness,  applies only to me but not to thee, the Infinite. Thou willest,  because thou willest, that my free obedience shall have consequences  in all eternity. The act of thy will I cannot comprehend; I only know  that it is not like to mine. Thou _doest_, and thy will itself is  deed. But thy method of action is directly contrary to that of which,  alone, I can form a conception. Thou _livest_ and _art_, for thou  knowest, and willest, and workest, omnipresent to finite Reason. But  thou art not such as through all eternity I shall alone be able to  conceive of Being.    In the contemplation of these thy relations to me, the finite, I will  be calm and blessed. I know immediately, only what I must do. This  will I perform undisturbed and joyful, and without philosophizing.  For it is thy voice which commands me, it is the ordination of the  spiritual world-plan concerning me, and the power by which I perform  it is thy power. Whatsoever is commanded me by that voice, whatsoever  is accomplished by this power, is surely and truly good in relation to  that plan. I am calm in all the events of this world, for they occur  in thy world. Nothing can deceive, or surprise, or make me afraid, so  surely as thou livest and I behold thy life. For in thee and through  thee, O infinite"]]]
