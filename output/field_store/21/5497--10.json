[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/14209"],[0,"The Kybalion (#13)"],[1," Nineteenth Century physical science re-discovered the truth and the  Twentieth Century scientific discoveries have added additional proof of  the correctness and truth of this centuries-old Hermetic doctrine.    The Hermetic Teachings are that not only is everything in constant  movement and vibration, but that the \"differences\" between the various  manifestations of the universal power are due entirely to the varying  rate and mode of vibrations. Not only this, but that even THE ALL, in  itself, manifests a constant vibration of such an infinite degree of  intensity and rapid motion that it may be practically considered as at  rest, the teachers directing the attention of the students to the fact  that even on the physical plane a rapidly moving object (such as a  revolving wheel) seems to be at rest. The Teachings are to the effect  that Spirit is at one end of the Pole of Vibration, the other Pole being  certain extremely gross forms of Matter. Between these two poles are  millions upon millions of different rates and modes of vibration.    Modern Science has proven that all that we call Matter and Energy are  but \"modes of vibratory motion,\" and some of the more advanced  scientists are rapidly moving toward the positions of the occultists who  hold that the phenomena of Mind are likewise modes of vibration or  motion. Let us see what science has to say regarding the question of  vibrations in matter and energy.    In the first place, science teaches that all matter manifests, in some  degree, the vibrations arising from temperature or heat. Be an object  cold or hot--both being but degrees of the same things--it manifests  certain heat vibrations, and in that sense is in motion and vibration.  Then all particles of Matter are in circular movement, from corpuscle to  suns. The planets revolve around suns, and many of them turn on their  axes. The suns move around greater central points, and these are  believed to move around still greater, and so on, ad infinitum. The  molecules of which the particular kinds of Matter are composed are in a  state of constant vibration and movement around each other and against  each other. The molecules are composed of Atoms, which, likewise, are in  a state of constant movement and vibration. The atoms are composed of  Corpuscles, sometimes called \"electrons,\" \"ions,\" etc., which also are  in a state of rapid motion, revolving around each other, and which  manifest a very rapid state and mode of vibration. And, so we see that  all forms of Matter manifest Vibration, in accordance with the Hermetic  Principle of Vibration.    And so it is with the various forms of Energy. Science teaches that  Light, Heat, Magnetism and Electricity are but forms of vibratory motion  connected in some way with, and probably emanating from the Ether.  Science does not as yet attempt to explain the nature of the phenomena  known as Cohesion, which is the principle of Molecular Attraction; nor  Chemical Affinity, which is the principle of Atomic Attraction; nor  Gravitation (the greatest mystery of the three), which is the principle  of attraction by which every particle or mass of Matter is bound to  every other particle or mass. These three forms of Energy are not as yet  understood by science, yet the writers incline to the opinion that these  too are manifestations of some form of vibratory energy, a fact which  the Hermetists have held and taught for ages past.    The Universal Ether, which is postulated by science without its nature  being understood clearly, is held by the Hermetists to be but a higher  manifestation of that which is erroneously called matter--that is to  say, Matter at a higher degree of vibration--and is called by them \"The  Ethereal Substance.\" The Hermetists teach that this Ethereal Substance  is of extreme tenuity and elasticity, and pervades universal space,  serving as a medium of transmission of waves of vibratory energy, such  as heat, light, electricity, magnetism, etc. The Teachings are that The  Ethereal Substance is a connecting link between the forms of vibratory  energy known as \"Matter\" on the one hand, and \"Energy or Force\" on the  other; and also that it manifests a degree of vibration, in rate and  mode, entirely its own.    Scientists have offered the illustration of a rapidly moving wheel, top,  or cylinder, to show the effects of increasing rates of vibration. The  illustration supposes a wheel, top, or revolving cylinder, running at a  low rate of speed--we will call this revolving thing \"the object\" in  following out the illustration. Let us suppose the object moving slowly.  It may be seen readily, but no sound of its movement reaches the ear.  The speed is gradually increased. In a few moments its movement becomes  so rapid that a deep growl or low note may be heard. Then as the rate is  increased the note rises one in the musical scale. Then, the motion  being still further increased, the next highest note is distinguished.  Then, one after another, all the notes of the musical scale appear,  rising higher and higher as the motion is increased. Finally when the  motions have reached a certain rate the final note perceptible to human  ears is reached and the shrill, piercing shriek dies away, and silence  follows. No sound is heard from the revolving object, the rate of motion  being so high that the human ear cannot register the vibrations. Then  comes the perception of rising degrees of Heat. Then after quite a time  the eye catches a glimpse of the object becoming a dull dark reddish  color. As the rate increases, the red becomes brighter. Then as the  speed is increased, the red melts into an orange. Then the orange melts  into a yellow. Then follow, successively, the shades of green, blue,  indigo, and finally violet, as the rate of sped increases. Then the  violet shades away, and all color disappears, the human eye not  being able to register them. But there are invisible rays emanating from  the revolving object, the rays that are used in photographing, and other  subtle rays of light. Then begin to manifest the peculiar rays known as  the \"X Rays,\" etc., as the constitution of the object changes.  Electricity and Magnetism are emitted when the appropriate rate of  vibration is attained.    When the object reaches a certain rate of vibration its molecules  disintegrate, and resolve themselves into the original elements or  atoms. Then the atoms, following the Principle of Vibration, are  separated into the countless corpuscles of which they are composed. And  finally, even the corpuscles disappear and the object may be said to Be  composed of The Ethereal Substance. Science does not dare to follow the  illustration further, but the Hermetists teach that if the vibrations be  continually increased the object would mount up the successive states of  manifestation and would in turn manifest the various mental stages, and  then on Spiritward, until it would finally re-enter THE ALL, which is  Absolute Spirit. The \"object,\" however, would have ceased to be an  \"object\" long before the stage of Ethereal Substance was reached, but  otherwise the illustration is correct inasmuch as it shows the effect of  constantly increased rates and modes of vibration. It must be  remembered, in the above illustration, that at the stages at which the  \"object\" throws off vibrations of light, heat, etc., it is not actually  \"resolved\" into those forms of energy (which are much higher in the  scale), but simply that it reaches a degree of vibration in which those  forms of energy are liberated, in a degree, from the confining  influences of its molecules, atoms and corpuscles, as the case may be.  These forms of energy, although much higher in the scale than matter,  are imprisoned and confined in the material combinations, by reason of  the energies manifesting through, and using material forms, but thus  becoming entangled and confined in their creations of material forms,  which, to an extent, is true of all creations, the creating force  becoming involved in its creation.    But the Hermetic Teachings go much further than do those of modern  science. They teach that all manifestation of thought, emotion, reason,  will or desire, or any mental state or condition, are accompanied by  vibrations, a portion of which are thrown off and which tend to affect  the minds of other persons by \"induction.\" This is the principle which  produces the phenomena of \"telepathy\"; mental influence, and other forms  of the action and power of mind over mind, with which the general public  is rapidly becoming acquainted, owing to the wide dissemination of  occult knowledge by the various schools, cults and teachers along these  lines at this time.    Every thought, emotion or mental state has its corresponding rate and  mode of vibration. And by an effort of the will of the person, or of  other persons, these mental states may be reproduced, just as a musical  tone may be reproduced by causing an instrument to vibrate at a certain  rate--just as color may be reproduced in the same may. By a knowledge of  the Principle of Vibration, as applied to Mental Phenomena, one may  polarize his mind at any degree he wishes, thus gaining a perfect  control over his mental states, moods, etc. In the same way he may  affect the minds of others, producing the desired mental states in them.  In short, he may be able to produce on the Mental Plane that which  science produces on the Physical Plane--namely, \"Vibrations at Will.\"  This power of course may be acquired only by the proper instruction,  exercises, practice, etc., the science being that of Mental  Transmutation, one of the branches of the Hermetic Art.    A little reflection on what we have said will show the student that the  Principle of Vibration underlies the wonderful phenomena of the power  manifested by the Masters and Adepts, who are able to apparently set  aside the Laws of Nature, but who, in reality, are simply using"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/14218"],[0,"The Story of Alchemy and the Beginnings of Chemistry (#13)"],[1,"of the  gas discovered by Priestley and studied by Lavoisier, the gas we now  call oxygen, and recognise as of paramount importance in chemical  reactions.    [Illustration: FIG. XII. _See p. 92._]    Besides discovering and recording many facts which have become part  and parcel of the science of chemistry, the alchemists invented and  used various pieces of apparatus, and conducted many operations, which  are still employed in chemical laboratories. I shall reproduce  illustrations of some of these processes and pieces of apparatus, and  quote a few of the directions, given in a book, published in 1664,  called _The Art of Distillation_, by John French, Dr. in Physick.    The method recommended by French for hermetically sealing the neck of  a glass vessel is shown in Fig. VI. p. 80. The neck of the vessel is  surrounded by a tray containing burning coals; when the glass melts it  is cut off by shears, and then closed by tongs, which are made hot  before use.    Fig. VII. p. 81, represents a method for covering an open vessel,  air-tight, with a receptacle into which a substance may be sublimed  from the lower vessel. The lettering explains the method of using the  apparatus.    French gives very practical directions and much sound advice for  conducting distillations of various kinds. The following are specimens  of his directions and advice:--      \"When you put water into a seething Balneum wherein there are    glasses let it be hot, or else thou wilt endanger the breaking of    the glasses.      \"When thou takest any earthen, or glass vessel from the fire,    expose it not to the cold aire too suddenly for fear it should    break.      \"In all your operations diligently observe the processes which you    read, and vary not a little from them, for sometimes a small    mistake or neglect spoils the whole operation, and frustrates your    expectations.      \"Try not at first experiments of great cost, or great difficulty;    for it will be a great discouragement to thee, and thou wilt be    very apt to mistake.      \"If any one would enter upon the practices of Chymistry, let him    apply himself to some expert artist for to be instructed in the    manual operation of things; for by this means he will learn more    in two months, than he can by his practice and study in seven    years, as also avoid much pains and cost, and redeem much time    which else of necessity he will lose.\"    Fig. VIII. p. 82, represents a common cold still, and Fig. IX. p. 84,  is a sketch of an apparatus for distilling by the aid of boiling  water. The bath wherein the vessels are placed in Fig. IX. was called  by the alchemists _balneum Mariae_, from Mary the Jewess, who is  mentioned in the older alchemical writings, and is supposed to have  invented an apparatus of this character. Nothing definite is known of  Mary the Jewess. A writer of the 7th century says she was initiated in  the sacred art in the temple of Memphis; a legend prevailed among some  of the alchemists that she was the sister of Moses.    Fig. X. p. 85, represents methods of distilling with an apparatus for  cooling the volatile products; the lower vessel is an _alembic_, with  a long neck, the upper part of which passes through a vessel  containing cold water.    [Illustration: Fig XIII. _See p. 94._]    Fig. XI. p. 88, shows a _pelican_, that is a vessel wherein a liquid  might be heated for a long time, and the volatile products be  constantly returned to the original vessel.    Fig. XII. p. 89, represents a retort with a receiver.    Some of the pieces of apparatus for distilling, which are described  by French, are shown in the following figures. Besides describing  apparatus for distilling, subliming, and other processes in the  laboratory, French gives directions for making tinctures, essences,  essential oils, spirits of salt, and pure saltpetre, oil of vitriol,  butter of antimony, calces (or as we now say, oxides) of metals, and  many other substances. He describes processes for making fresh water  from salt, artificial mineral water, medicated hot baths for invalids  (one of the figures represents an apparatus very like those advertised  to-day as \"Turkish baths at home\"), and artificial precious stones; he  tells how to test minerals, and make alloys, and describes the  preparation of many substances made from gold and silver. He also  gives many curious receipts; for instance, \"To make Firre-trees appear  in Turpentine,\" \"To make a Plant grow in two or three hours,\" \"To make  the representation of the whole world in a Glass,\" \"To extract a white  Milkie substance from the raies of the Moon.\"    [Illustration: FIG. XIV. _See p. 94._]    The process of making oil of vitriol, by burning sulphur under a hood  fitted with a side tube for the outflow of the oil of vitriol, is  represented in Fig. XIII. p. 92.    Fig. XIV. p. 93, is interesting; it is an apparatus for rectifying  spirits, by distilling, and liquefying only the most volatile portions  of the distillate. The spirituous liquor was heated, and the vapours  caused to traverse a long zigzag tube, wherein the less volatile  portions condensed to liquid, which flowed back into the vessel; the  vapour then passed into another vessel, and then through a second  zigzag tube, and was finally cooled by water, and the condensed liquid  collected. This apparatus was the forerunner of that used to-day, for  effecting the separation of liquids which boil at different  temperatures, by the process called _fractional distillation_.    We should never forget that the alchemists were patient and laborious  workers, their theories were vitally connected with their practice,  and there was a constant action and reaction between their general  scheme of things and many branches of what we now call chemical  manufactures. We may laugh at many of their theories, and regret that  much useless material was accumulated by them; we may agree with Boyle  (end of 17th century) when he likens the \"hermetick philosophers,\" in  their search for truth, to \"the navigators of Solomon's Tarshish  fleet, who brought home from their long and tedious voyages, not only  gold, and silver, and ivory, but apes and peacocks too; for so the  writings of several of your hermetick philosophers present us,  together with divers substantial and noble experiments, theories,  which either like peacocks' feathers make a great show but are neither  solid nor useful; or else like apes, if they have some appearance of  being rational, are blemished with some absurdity or other, that, when  they are attentively considered make them appear ridiculous.\" But  however we may condemn their method, because it rested on their own  conception of what the order of nature must be, we cannot but praise  their assiduity in conducting experiments and gathering facts.    As Bacon says, in _De Augmentis Scientiarum_:      \"Alchemy may be compared to the man who told his sons that he had    left them gold buried somewhere in his vineyard; where they by    digging found no gold, but by turning up the mould about the roots    of the vines, procured a plentiful vintage. So the search and    endeavours to make gold have brought many useful inventions and    instructive experiments to light.\"          CHAPTER VII.    THE LANGUAGE OF ALCHEMY      The vagueness of the general conceptions of alchemy, and the  attribution of ethical qualities to material things by the alchemists,  necessarily led to the employment of a language which is inexact,  undescriptive, and unsuggestive to modern ears. The same name was  given to different things, and the same thing went under many names.  In Chapter IV. I endeavoured to analyse two terms which were  constantly used by the alchemists to convey ideas of great importance,  the terms _Element_ and _Principle_. That attempt sufficed, at any  rate, to show the vagueness of the ideas which these terms were  intended to express, and to make evident the inconsistencies between  the meanings given to the words by different alchemical writers. The  story quoted in Chapter III., from Michael Sendivogius, illustrates  the difficulty which the alchemists themselves had in understanding  what they meant by the term _Mercury_; yet there is perhaps no word  more often used by them than that. Some of them evidently took it to  mean the substance then, and now, called mercury; the results of this  literal interpretation were disastrous; others thought of mercury as a  substance which could be obtained, or, at any rate, might be obtained,  by repeatedly distilling ordinary mercury, both alone and when mixed  with other substances; others used the word to mean a hypothetical  something which was liquid but did not wet things, limpid yet capable  of becoming solid, volatile yet able to prevent the volatilisation of  other things, and white, yet ready to cause other white things to  change their colour; they thought of this something, this soul of  mercury, as having properties without itself being tangible, as at  once a substance and not a substance, at once a bodily spirit and a  spiritual body.    It was impossible to express the alchemical ideas in any language save  that of far-fetched allegory. The alchemical writings abound in such  allegories. Here are two of them.    The first allegory is taken from _The Twelve Keys_, of Basilius  Valentinus, the Benedictine:--      \"The eleventh key to the knowledge of the augmentation of our    Stone I will put before you in the form of a parable.      \"There lived in the East a gilded knight, named Orpheus, who was    possessed of immense wealth, and had everything that heart can    wish. He had taken to wife his own sister, Euridice, who did not,    however, bear him any children. This he regarded as the punishment    of his sin in having wedded his own sister, and was instant in    prayer to God both by day and by night, that the curse might be    taken from him. One night when he was buried"]]]
