The summons was answered  by a bond-servant, a coarse-clad and dull-featured piece of humanity,  who, after ascertaining that his master was the applicant, undid the  door and held a flaring pine-knot torch to light him in. Farther back  in the passageway the red blaze discovered a matronly woman, but no  little crowd of children came bounding forth to greet their father's  return.    As the Puritan entered he thrust aside his cloak and displayed  Ilbrahim's face to the female.    \"Dorothy, here is a little outcast whom Providence hath put into our  hands,\" observed he. \"Be kind to him, even as if he were of those dear  ones who have departed from us.\"    \"What pale and bright-eyed little boy is this, Tobias?\" she inquired.  \"Is he one whom the wilderness-folk have ravished from some Christian  mother?\"    \"No, Dorothy; this poor child is no captive from the wilderness,\" he  replied. \"The heathen savage would have given him to eat of his scanty  morsel and to drink of his birchen cup, but Christian men, alas! had  cast him out to die.\" Then he told her how he had found him beneath  the gallows, upon his father's grave, and how his heart had prompted  him like the speaking of an inward voice to take the little outcast  home and be kind unto him. He acknowledged his resolution to feed and  clothe him as if he were his own child, and to afford him the  instruction which should counteract the pernicious errors hitherto  instilled into his infant mind.    Dorothy was gifted with even a quicker tenderness than her husband,  and she approved of all his doings and intentions.    \"Have you a mother, dear child?\" she inquired.    The tears burst forth from his full heart as he attempted to reply,  but Dorothy at length understood that he had a mother, who like the  rest of her sect was a persecuted wanderer. She had been taken from  the prison a short time before, carried into the uninhabited  wilderness and left to perish there by hunger or wild beasts. This was  no uncommon method of disposing of the Quakers, and they were  accustomed to boast that the inhabitants of the desert were more  hospitable to them than civilized man.    \"Fear not, little boy; you shall not need a mother, and a kind one,\"  said Dorothy, when she had gathered this information. \"Dry your tears,  Ilbrahim, and be my child, as I will be your mother.\"    The good woman prepared the little bed from which her own children had  successively been borne to another resting-place. Before Ilbrahim  would consent to occupy it he knelt down, and as Dorothy listed to his  simple and affecting prayer she marvelled how the parents that had  taught it to him could have been judged worthy of death. When the boy  had fallen asleep, she bent over his pale and spiritual countenance,  pressed a kiss upon his white brow, drew the bedclothes up about his  neck, and went away with a pensive gladness in her heart.    Tobias Pearson was not among the earliest emigrants from the old  country. He had remained in England during the first years of the  Civil War, in which he had borne some share as a cornet of dragoons  under Cromwell. But when the ambitious designs of his leader began to  develop themselves, he quitted the army of the Parliament and sought a  refuge from the strife which was no longer holy among the people of  his persuasion in the colony of Massachusetts. A more worldly  consideration had perhaps an influence in drawing him thither, for New  England offered advantages to men of unprosperous fortunes as well as  to dissatisfied religionists, and Pearson had hitherto found it  difficult to provide for a wife and increasing family. To this  supposed impurity of motive the more bigoted Puritans were inclined to  impute the removal by death of all the children for whose earthly good  the father had been over-thoughtful. They had left their native  country blooming like roses, and like roses they had perished in a  foreign soil. Those expounders of the ways of Providence, who had thus  judged their brother and attributed his domestic sorrows to his sin,  were not more charitable when they saw him and Dorothy endeavoring to  fill up the void in their hearts by the adoption of an infant of the  accursed sect. Nor did they fail to communicate their disapprobation  to Tobias, but the latter in reply merely pointed at the little quiet,  lovely boy, whose appearance and deportment were indeed as powerful  arguments as could possibly have been adduced in his own favor. Even  his beauty, however, and his winning manners sometimes produced an  effect ultimately unfavorable; for the bigots, when the outer surfaces  of their iron hearts had been softened and again grew hard, affirmed  that no merely natural cause could have so worked upon them. Their  antipathy to the poor infant was also increased by the ill-success of  divers theological discussions in which it was attempted to convince  him of the errors of his sect. Ilbrahim, it is true, was not a skilful  controversialist, but the feeling of his religion was strong as  instinct in him, and he could neither be enticed nor driven from the  faith which his father had died for.    The odium of this stubbornness was shared in a great measure by the  child's protectors, insomuch that Tobias and Dorothy very shortly  began to experience a most bitter species of persecution in the cold  regards of many a friend whom they had valued. The common people  manifested their opinions more openly. Pearson was a man of some  consideration, being a representative to the General Court and an  approved lieutenant in the train-bands, yet within a week after his  adoption of Ilbrahim he had been both hissed and hooted. Once, also,  when walking through a solitary piece of woods, he heard a loud voice  from some invisible speaker, and it cried, \"What shall be done to the  backslider? Lo! the scourge is knotted for him, even the whip of nine  cords, and every cord three knots.\" These insults irritated Pearson's  temper for the moment; they entered also into his heart, and became  imperceptible but powerful workers toward an end which his most secret  thought had not yet whispered.           *       *       *       *       *    On the second Sabbath after Ilbrahim became a member of their family,  Pearson and his wife deemed it proper that he should appear with them  at public worship. They had anticipated some opposition to this  measure from the boy, but he prepared himself in silence, and at the  appointed hour was clad in the new mourning-suit which Dorothy had  wrought for him. As the parish was then, and during many subsequent  years, unprovided with a bell, the signal for the commencement of  religious exercises was the beat of a drum. At the first sound of that  martial call to the place of holy and quiet thoughts Tobias and  Dorothy set forth, each holding a hand of little Ilbrahim, like two  parents linked together by the infant of their love. On their path  through the leafless woods they were overtaken by many persons of  their acquaintance, all of whom avoided them and passed by on the  other side; but a severer trial awaited their constancy when they had  descended the hill and drew near the pine-built and undecorated house  of prayer. Around the door, from which the drummer still sent forth  his thundering summons, was drawn up a formidable phalanx, including  several of the oldest members of the congregation, many of the  middle-aged and nearly all the younger males. Pearson found it  difficult to sustain their united and disapproving gaze, but Dorothy,  whose mind was differently circumstanced, merely drew the boy closer  to her and faltered not in her approach. As they entered the door they  overheard the muttered sentiments of the assemblage; and when the  reviling voices of the little children smote Ilbrahim's ear, he wept.    The interior aspect of the meeting-house was rude. The low ceiling,  the unplastered walls, the naked woodwork and the undraperied pulpit  offered nothing to excite the devotion which without such external  aids often remains latent in the heart. The floor of the building was  occupied by rows of long cushionless benches, supplying the place of  pews, and the broad aisle formed a sexual division impassable except  by children beneath a certain age.    Pearson and Dorothy separated at the door of the meeting-house, and  Ilbrahim, being within the years of infancy, was retained under the  care of the latter. The wrinkled beldams involved themselves in their  rusty cloaks as he passed by; even the mild-featured maidens seemed to  dread contamination; and many a stern old man arose and turned his  repulsive and unheavenly countenance upon the gentle boy, as if the  sanctuary were polluted by his presence. He was a sweet infant of the  skies that had strayed away from his home, and all the inhabitants of  this miserable world closed up their impure hearts against him, drew  back their earth-soiled garments from his touch and said, \"We are  holier than thou.\"    Ilbrahim, seated by the side of his adopted mother and retaining fast  hold of her hand, assumed a grave and decorous demeanor such as might  befit a person of matured taste and understanding who should find  himself in a temple dedicated to some worship which he did not  recognize, but felt himself bound to respect. The exercises had not  yet commenced, however, when the boy's attention was arrested by an  event apparently of trifling interest. A woman having her face muffled  in a hood and a cloak drawn completely about her form advanced slowly  up the broad aisle and took place upon the foremost bench. Ilbrahim's  faint color varied, his nerves fluttered; he was unable to turn his  eyes from the muffled female.    When the"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/1371"],[0,"Astoria; Or, Anecdotes of an Enterprise Beyond the Rocky Mountains (#13)"],[1,"  obtained, besides several goats, two sheep, a quantity of poultry, and  vegetables in abundance. The partners now urged to recruit their forces  from the natives of this island. They declared they had never seen  watermen equal to them, even among the voyageurs of the Northwest; and,  indeed, they are remarkable for their skill in managing their light  craft, and can swim and dive like waterfowl. The partners were inclined,  therefore, to take thirty or forty with them to the Columbia, to be  employed in the service of the company. The captain, however, objected  that there was not room in his vessel for the accommodation of such a  number. Twelve, only, were therefore enlisted for the company, and as  many more for the service of the ship. The former engaged to serve for  the term of three years, during which they were to be fed and clothed;  and at the expiration of the time were to receive one hundred dollars in  merchandise.    And now, having embarked his live-stock, fruits, vegetables, and water,  the captain made ready to set sail. How much the honest man had  suffered in spirit by what he considered the freaks and vagaries of  his passengers, and how little he had understood their humors and  intentions, is amusingly shown in a letter written to Mr. Astor from  Woahoo, which contains his comments on the scenes we have described.    \"It would be difficult,\" he writes, \"to imagine the frantic gambols  that are daily played off here; sometimes dressing in red coats, and  otherwise very fantastically, and collecting a number of ignorant  natives around them, telling them that they are the great eris of the  Northwest, and making arrangements for sending three or four vessels  yearly to them from the coast with spars, &c.; while those very natives  cannot even furnish a hog to the ship. Then dressing in Highland plaids  and kilts, and making similar arrangements, with presents of rum, wine,  or anything that is at hand. Then taking a number of clerks and men  on shore to the very spot on which Captain Cook was killed, and each  fetching off a piece of the rock or tree that was touched by the shot.  Then sitting down with some white man or some native who can be a little  understood, and collecting the history of those islands, of Tamaahmaah's  wars, the curiosities of the islands, &c., preparatory to the  histories of their voyages; and the collection is indeed ridiculously  contemptible. To enumerate the thousand instances of ignorance, filth,  &c.,--or to particularize all the frantic gambols that are daily  practiced, would require Volumes.\"    Before embarking, the great eris of the American Fur Company took leave  of their illustrious ally in due style, with many professions of lasting  friendship and promises of future intercourse; while the matter-of-fact  captain anathematized him in his heart for a grasping, trafficking  savage; as shrewd and sordid in his dealings as a white man. As one of  the vessels of the company will, in the course of events, have to appeal  to the justice and magnanimity of this island potentate, we shall see  how far the honest captain was right in his opinion.         * It appears, from the accounts of subsequent voyagers, that       Tamaahmaah afterwards succeeded in his wish of purchasing a       large ship. In this he sent a cargo of sandal-wood to       Canton, having discovered that the foreign merchants trading       with him made large profits on this wood, shipped by them       from the islands to the Chinese markets. The ship was manned       by natives, but the officers were Englishmen. She       accomplished her voyage, and returned in safety to the       islands, with the Hawaiian flag floating gloriously in the       breeze. The king hastened on board, expecting to find his       sandal-wood converted into crapes and damasks, and other       rich stuffs of China, but found, to his astonishment, by the       legerdemain of traffic, his cargo had all disappeared, and,       in place of it, remained a bill of charges amounting to       three thousand dollars. It was some time before he could be       made to comprehend certain of the most important items of       the bill, such as pilotage, anchorage, and custom-house       fees; but when he discovered that maritime states in other       countries derived large revenues in this manner, to the       great cost of the merchant, \"Well,\" cried he, \"then I will       have harbor fees also.\" He established them accordingly.       Pilotage a dollar a foot on the draft of each vessel.       Anchorage from sixty to seventy dollars. In this way he       greatly increased the royal revenue, and turned his China       speculation to account.        CHAPTER VII.         Departure From the Sandwich Islands.--Misunderstandings--       Miseries of a Suspicious Man.--Arrival at the Columbia--       Dangerous Service.--Gloomy Apprehensions--Bars and       Breakers.--Perils of the Ship. Disasters of a Boat's Crew.--       Burial of a Sandwich Islander.    IT was on the 28th of February that the Tonquin set sail from the  Sandwich Islands. For two days the wind was contrary, and the vessel was  detained in their neighborhood; at length a favorable breeze sprang up,  and in a little while the rich groves, green hills, and snowy peaks of  those happy islands one after another sank from sight, or melted into  the blue distance, and the Tonquin ploughed her course towards the  sterner regions of the Pacific.    The misunderstandings between the captain and his passengers still  continued; or rather, increased in gravity. By his altercations and his  moody humors, he had cut himself off from all community of thought, or  freedom of conversation with them. He disdained to ask questions as  to their proceedings, and could only guess at the meaning of their  movements, and in so doing indulged in conjectures and suspicions, which  produced the most whimsical self-torment.    Thus, in one of his disputes with them, relative to the goods on board,  some of the packages of which they wished to open, to take out articles  of clothing for the men or presents for the natives, he was so harsh and  peremptory that they lost all patience, and hinted that they were the  strongest party, and might reduce him to a very ridiculous dilemma, by  taking from him the command.    A thought now flashed across the captain's mind that they really had  a plan to depose him, and that, having picked up some information at  Owyhee, possibly of war between the United States and England, they  meant to alter the destination of the voyage; perhaps to seize upon ship  and cargo for their own use.    Once having conceived this suspicion, everything went to foster it. They  had distributed fire-arms among some of their men, a common precaution  among the fur traders when mingling with the natives. This, however,  looked like preparation. Then several of the partners and clerks and  some of the men, being Scotsmen, were acquainted with the Gaelic, and  held long conversations together in that language. These conversations  were considered by the captain of a \"mysterious and unwarranted nature,\"  and related, no doubt, to some foul conspiracy that was brewing among  them. He frankly avows such suspicions, in his letter to Mr. Astor, but  intimates that he stood ready to resist any treasonous outbreak; and  seems to think that the evidence of preparation on his part had an  effect in overawing the conspirators.    The fact is, as we have since been informed by one of the parties, it  was a mischievous pleasure with some of the partners and clerks, who  were young men, to play upon the suspicious temper and splenetic humors  of the captain. To this we may ascribe many of their whimsical pranks  and absurd propositions, and, above all, their mysterious colloquies in  Gaelic.    In this sore and irritable mood did the captain pursue his course,  keeping a wary eye on every movement, and bristling up whenever the  detested sound of the Gaelic language grated upon his ear. Nothing  occurred, however, materially to disturb the residue of the voyage  excepting a violent storm; and on the twenty-second of March, the  Tonquin arrived at the mouth of the Oregon, or Columbia River.    The aspect of the river and the adjacent coast was wild and dangerous.  The mouth of the Columbia is upwards of four miles wide with a peninsula  and promontory on one side, and a long low spit of land on the other;  between which a sand bar and chain of breakers almost block the  entrance. The interior of the country rises into successive ranges  of mountains, which, at the time of the arrival of the Tonquin, were  covered with snow.    A fresh wind from the northwest sent a rough tumbling sea upon the  coast, which broke upon the bar in furious surges, and extended a sheet  of foam almost across the mouth of the river. Under these circumstances  the captain did not think it prudent to approach within three leagues,  until the bar should be sounded and the channel ascertained. Mr.  Fox, the chief mate, was ordered to this service in the whaleboat,  accompanied by John Martin, an old seaman, who had formerly visited the  river, and by three Canadians. Fox requested to have regular sailors to  man the boat, but the captain would not spare them from the service of  the ship, and supposed the Canadians, being expert boatmen on lakes  and rivers, were competent to the service, especially when directed and  aided by Fox and Martin. Fox seems to have lost all firmness of spirit  on the occasion, and to have regarded the service with a misgiving  heart. He came to the partners for sympathy, knowing their differences  with the captain, and the tears were in his eyes as he represented  his case. \"I am sent off,\" said he, \"without seamen to man my boat,  in boisterous weather, and on the most dangerous part of the northwest  coast. My uncle was lost a few years ago on this same bar, and I am now  going to lay"]]]
