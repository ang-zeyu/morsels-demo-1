They liue  also with fisshe, either dried in the Sonne and so eaten rawe, or elles  kept in pikle. They fiede also vpon birdes, and foules, firste salted, and  then eaten rawe. Quaile, and mallard, are not but for the richer sorte. At  all solempne suppers, when a number is gathered, and the tables withdrawen,  some one of the company carieth aboute in an open case, the image of death,  caruen out of woode, or drawen with the pencille as niere to the vine as is  possible, of a cubite, or two cubites long at the moste.

When  they miete in the waye, they do reuerence to eche other, bowing their  bodies, and letting fall their handes on their knees. They weare long  garments of lynnen, hemmed about the skirtes beneth, which the call  Casiliras: ouer the which they throwe on another white garment also. Wollen  apparelle thei neither weare to the churche, ne bewry any man in.    Nowe for asmoche as they afore time that euer excelled in anye kinde of  learning, or durste take vppon them, to prescribe lawe, and rule of life  vnto to other, as Orpheus, Homeire, Museus, Melampode, Dedalus, Licurgus,  Solon, Plato, Pithagoras, Samolxis, Eudoxus, Democritus, Inopides, and  Moses the Hebrue, with manye other, whose names the Egiptians glorie to be  cronicled with theim: trauelled first to the Egiptians, to learne emongest  them bothe wisedome, and politique ordre (wherein at those daies they  passed all other) me thinketh it pleasaunte and necessarie also, to stande  somewhat vpon their maners, ceremonies and Lawes, that it may be knowen  what they, and sondry more haue borowed of them, and translated vnto other.  For (as Philip Beroalde writeth in his commentary vpon Apuleius booke,  entituled the Golden Asse) the moste parte of the deuices that we vse in  our Christian religion, ware borowed out of the maner of Thegiptians. As  surpluis and rochet, and suche linnen garmentes: shauen crownes, tourninges  at the altare, our masse solempnities, our organes, our knielinges,  crouchinges, praiers, and other of that kinde. The kinges of Egipte (saieth  Diodore the Sicilian in his seconde booke) liued not at rouers [Footnote:  From the expression _to shoot at rovers_, i.e., at a mark, but with an  elevation, not point blank.] as other kinges doe, as thoughe me lusteth  ware lawe, but bothe in their monie collections, and daily fare and  apparell, folowed the bridle of the lawe. They had neither slaue that was  homeborne, ne slaue that was forein bought, appointed to attende or awaite  vpon them. But the sonnes of those that ware priestes of honour, bothe  aboue thage of twenty yeres, and also singulerly learned. That the king  hauing these attendant for the body both by daie and by night, restrained  by the reuerence of the company about hym might commit nothing that was  vicious, or dishonourable. For men of power are seldome euil, where they  lacke ministres for their vnlawfull lustes. There ware appoincted houres,  both of the daie and the night, in the whiche the kinge mighte lawfully  doe, what the Lawe did permit. In the morning, assone as he was ready, it  behoued him to peruse al lettres, supplicacions, and billes: that knowing  what was to be done, he might giue aunswer in tyme: that all thinges might  rightlie, and ordrely be done. These being dispatched, when he had washed  his bodie emong the Pieres of the Realme, he put on some robe of estate,  and Sacrificed to the goddes. The maner was, that the Primate, or head of  the spiritualty (the beastes appoincted for the sacrifices being brought  harde to the altare, and the Kyng standing by) should with a loude voyce,  in the hearing of the people, wysshe to the king (that bare him selfe  iustely towarde his subiectes) prosperous healthe, and good fortune in all.  And should further particulerly recite the vertues of the king, his  deuoutnes and reuerence towarde God, and clemency towarde men. Commende him  as chaste, iuste, and vpright: of noble and great coinage, sothfaste,  liberal, and one that well brideled al his desires. Punisshing thoffendour  vnder his desertes, and rewarding the well doer aboue his merites. Making a  processe of these, and such other like: in the ende with the rehersalle of  the contrary vices, he cursed the wicked and euil. Then absoluing the King  of his offences, he laied all the faulte vpon the ministres, and  attendauntes, that should at any time moue the king to any thing vnright,  or vnlawfull. These thinges beinge done, he preached vnto the King the  blessednes of the life, led accordyng to the pleasure of the goddes, and  exhorted him thervnto: as also to frame his maners and doinges vnto vertue,  and not to giue eare to that, that leude men should counsaile him, but to  followe those thynges that led vnto honour and vertue. In thende, whan the  King had sacrificed a bulle, the priest declared certain preceptes and  examples of excellente, and moste worthy men: written in their holy  scripture. To thende that the Kynge admonisshed by the example of theim,  might ordre his gouernaunce iustlye, and godly, and not geue hym selfe to  couetous cloinyng, [Footnote: Probably from the old French, _encloyer_, to  glut, or surfeit.] and hourdyng of tresure. He neither satte to iudge, ne  toke his vocacion, ne walked abrode, ne washed at home, ne laye with his  Quiene, ne finally did any maner of thing, but vpon the prescripte of the  lawe.    Their fare was but simple, nothing but veale, and goose, and their wine by  measure appoincted. So that thone should nether ouerlade the bealy, ne the  other the heade. To conclude, their whole life so bounde vpon temperaunce,  that it might be thoughte raither to haue bene prescribed them by a  discrete Phisicen to preserue helthe, then by a politique Lawyer. It  siemeth wondrefull that the Egiptians mighte not rule their owne priuate  life, but by the Lawes. But it semeth more wonderfull that their King had  no liberty of him selfe, either to sitte in iudgement, to make collections  of money, or topunishe any man, vpon wilfulnes, stoute stomacke, angre,  displeasure, or anye vniuste cause: But to be holden vnder lawe as a  commune subiecte, and yet not to be agreued therwith, but to thincke them  selues moste blessed in obeyeng and folowyng the lawe, and other in  folowing their lustes most vnhappy, as being led by them into many  daungiers, and damages. For suche oftentimes, euen when they know them  selues to do euill, either ouercome with malice, and hatred, or some other  mischiefe of the minde, are not able to witholde theim selues from the  euille. But they which by wisedome and discretion, gouerne their liues,  offende in fewe thinges. The kinges vsing suche an equitie, and vprightnes  towarde their subdites, are so tendred againe of them, that not onely the  priestes, but all the Egiptians in generall, haue more care for the health  and the welfare of the King, then for their wiues, their children, or any  other princes.    He that to his death continueth in this goodnesse, him being dead, do they  in general lamente. They teare their clothes, they shut vp the churche  dores, they haunte no place of wonte commune concourse, they omytte all  solempne holy daies: and girding them selues vnder the pappes with brode  Ribbond of Sarsenet, two or thre hundred on a company, men and women  together, renewe euery daye twise, thre skore and xii. daies together, the  buriall bewailing, casting dirte on their heades, and singing in rithme the  vertue of the Kinge. They absteine from al flesshe of beastes, all meates  that touche fire, all wine and all preparation of seruice at the table.  They bathe not, thei smel of no swietes, they go to no beddes, they  pleasure not in women: but as folkes that had buried their beste beloued  childe, all that continuance of time they lamente. During these seuenty and  two daies (hauyng prepared all thinges necessarie for the funerall pompe):  the laste daye of all, the bodie beyng enbaulmed and cofred, is sette  before the entrie of the Toombe. Thereaftre the custome, one redeth an  abridgemente of all the thinges done by the king in his life. And if there  be any man disposed to accuse the deade, libertie is giuen him. The  priestes are present, and euer giue praise to his well doings, as they be  recited. There stondeth also rounde about the Toombe a multitude of the  communes, which with their voices allowe asmuche as is trew, and crie out  vpon that, that is false, with vehement gainsaienges. Wherby it hath  happened, that sondry kynges by the repugnynges of the people haue lien  vntoombed: and haue lacked the honoure of bewrialle, that the good are  wonte to haue. That feare, hath driuen the kynges of Aegipte, to liue  iustly, and vprightly, lesse the people aftre their deathes, might shewe  them suche dishonour, and beare them perpetuall hatred. This was the maner  specially, of the aunciente kynges there.    The whole realme of Egipte was diuided into Shieres: and to euery Shiere  was appoincted a Presidente, whiche had the gouernaunce of the whole  Shiere. The reuenewes of the realme ware diuided into iii. partes: whereof  the companie of the priestes had the first parte, which ware in greate  estimacion emong them, both for the administration of Goddes Seruice, and  also for the good learnyng, wherin thei brought vp many.

Two consuls would  balance the military power between them, and prevent either from  becoming supreme. Among the Iroquois this office never became  influential.    In Indian ethnography the subjects of primary importance are the gens,  phratry, tribe, and confederacy. They exhibit the organization of  society. Next to these are the tenure and functions of the office of  sachem and chief, the functions of the council of chiefs, and the  tenure and functions of the office of principal war-chief. When  these are ascertained the structure and principles of their  governmental system will be known. A knowledge of their usages and  customs, of their arts and inventions, and of their plan of life  will then fill out the picture. In the work of American  investigators too little attention has been given to the former.  They still afford a rich field in which much information may be  gathered. Our knowledge, which is now general, should be made minute  and comparative. The Indian tribes in the Lower and in the Middle  Status of barbarism represent two of the great stages of progress  from savagery to civilization. Our own remote forefathers passed  through the same conditions, one after the other, and possessed,  there can scarcely be a doubt, the same, or very similar institutions,  with many of the same usages and customs. However little we may be  interested in the American Indians personally, their experience  touches us more nearly, as an exemplification of the experience of  our own ancestors. Our primary institutions root themselves in a  prior gentile society in which the gens, phratry, and tribe were the  organic series, and in which the council of chiefs was the  instrument of government. The phenomena of their ancient society  must have presented many points in common with that of the Iroquois  and other Indian tribes. This view of the matter lends an additional  interest to the study of comparative institutions of mankind.    The Iroquois confederacy is an excellent exemplification of a  gentile society under this form of organization. It seems to realize  all the capabilities of gentile institutions in the Lower Status of  barbarism, leaving an opportunity for further development, but no  subsequent plan of government until the institutions of political  society, founded upon territory and upon property, with the  establishment of which the gentile organization would be overthrown.  The intermediate stages were transitional, remaining military  democracies to the end, except where tyrannies founded upon  usurpation were temporarily established in their places. The  confederacy of the Iroquois was essentially democratic, because it  was composed of gentes each of which was organized upon the common  principles of democracy, not of the highest but of the primitive type;  and because the tribes reserved the right of local self-government.  They conquered other tribes and held them in subjection, as for  example the Delawares; but the latter remained under the government  of their own chiefs, and added nothing to the strength of the  confederacy. It was impossible in this state of society to unite  tribes under one government who spoke different languages, or to  hold conquered tribes under tribute with any benefit but the tribute.    This exposition of the Iroquois confederacy is far from exhaustive  of the facts, but it has been carried far enough to answer my  present object. The Iroquois were a vigorous and intelligent people,  with a brain approaching in volume the Aryan average. Eloquent in  oratory, vindictive in war, and indomitable in perseverance, they  have gained a place in history. If their military achievements are  dreary with the atrocities of savage warfare, they have illustrated  some of the highest virtues of mankind in their relations with each  other. The confederacy which they organized must be regarded as a  remarkable production of wisdom and sagacity. One of its avowed  objects was peace--to remove the cause of strife by uniting their  tribes under one government, and then extending it by incorporating  other tribes of the same name and lineage. They urged the Eries and  the Neutral Nation to become members of the confederacy, and for  their refusal expelled them from their borders. Such an insight into  the highest objects of government is creditable to their intelligence.  Their numbers were small, but they counted in their ranks a large  number of able men. This proves the high grade of the stock.    [Footnote: For the prevalence of the organization into gentes or  clans among the Indian tribes, see Ancient Society, ch. vi. Since  the publication of that work the same organization has been found by  Mr. Bandelier by personal exploration among the Pueblo tribes in New  Mexico, who speak the Queris language, among whom his work thus far  has been confined. Descent is in the female line. The same  indefatigable student has found very satisfactory evidence of the  same organization among the ancient Mexicans. (See article on  \"The Social Organization and Mode of Government of the Ancient  Mexicans,\" Peabody Museum, Twelfth Annual Report, p. 576.) He has  also found additional evidence of the same organization among the  Sedentary Tribes in Central America. It seems highly probable that  this organization was anciently universal among the tribes in the  Ganowanian family.]          CHAPTER II.    THE LAW OF HOSPITALITY AND ITS GENERAL PRACTICE.      When America was discovered in its several parts the Indian tribes  were found in dissimilar conditions. The least advanced tribes were  without the art of pottery, and without horticulture, and were,  therefore, in savagery. But in the arts of life they were advanced  as far as is implied by its Upper Status, which found them in  possession of the bow and arrow. Such were the tribes in the Valley  of the Columbia, in the Hudson Bay Territory, in parts of Canada,  California, and Mexico, and some of the coast tribes of South America.  The use of pottery, and the cultivation of maize and plants, were  unknown among them. They depended for subsistence upon fish, bread,  roots, and game. The second class were intermediate between them and  the Village Indians. They subsisted upon fish and game and the  products of a limited horticulture, and were in the Lower Status of  barbarism. Such were the Iroquois, the New England and Virginia  Indians, the Creeks, Cherokees, and Choctaws, the Shawnees, Miamis,  Mandans, Minmtarees, and other tribes of the United States east of  the Missouri River, together with certain tribes of Mexico and South  America in the same condition of advancement. Many of them lived in  villages, some of which were stockaded, but village life was not as  distinctive and common among them as it was among the most advanced  tribes. The third class were the Village Indians proper, who  depended almost exclusively upon horticulture for subsistence,  cultivating maize and plants by irrigation. They constructed joint  tenement houses of adobe bricks and of stone, usually more than one  story high. Such were the tribes of New Mexico, Mexico, Central  America, and upon the plateau of the Andes. These tribes were in the  Middle Status of barbarism.    The weapons, arts, usages, and customs, inventions, architecture,  institutions, and form of government of all alike bear the impress  of a common mind, and reveal, in their wide range, the successive  stages of development of the same original conceptions. Our first  mistake consisted in overrating the degree of advancement of the  Village Indians, in comparison with that of the other tribes; our  second in underrating that of the latter; from which resulted a third,  that of separating one from the other, and regarding them as  different races. The evidence of their unity of origin has now  accumulated to such a degree as to leave no reasonable doubt upon  the question. The first two classes of tribes always held the  preponderating power, at least in North America, and furnished the  migrating bands which replenished the ranks of the Village Indians,  as well as the continent, with inhabitants. It remained for the  Village Indians to invent the process of smelting iron ore to attain  to the Upper Status of barbarism, and, beyond that, to invent a  phonetic alphabet to reach the first stage of civilization. One  entire ethnical period intervened between the highest class of  Indians and the beginning of civilization.    [Transcriber's Note: Lengthy footnote relocated to chapter end.]    It seems singular that the Village Indians, who first became  possessed of maize, the great American cereal, and of the art of  cultivation, did not rise to supremacy over the continent. With  their increased numbers and more stable subsistence they might have  been expected to extend their power and spread their migrating bands  over the most valuable areas to the gradual displacement of the  ruder tribes. But in this respect they signally failed. The means of  sustaining life among the latter were remarkably persistent. The  higher culture of the Village Indians, such as it was, did not  enable them to advance, either in their weapons or in the art of war,  beyond the more barbarous tribes, except as a superior house  architecture tended to render their villages and their habitations  impregnable to Indian assault. Moreover, in the art of government  they had not been able to rise above gentile institutions and  establish political society. This fact demonstrates the  impossibility of privileged classes and of potentates, under their  institutions, with power to enforce the labor of the people for the  erection of palaces for their use, and explains the absence of such  structures.    Horticulture and other domestic arts spread from the Village Indians  to the tribes in the Lower Status of barbarism, and"]]]
