Life was only exhibited in him by  movement, his senses had not as yet been restored.    Pencroft much regretted not having either fire, or the means of  procuring it, for he had, unfortunately, forgotten to bring the burnt  linen, which would easily have ignited from the sparks produced by  striking together two flints. As to the engineer's pockets, they were  entirely empty, except that of his waistcoat, which contained his watch.  It was necessary to carry Harding to the Chimneys, and that as soon as  possible. This was the opinion of all.    Meanwhile, the care which was lavished on the engineer brought him back  to consciousness sooner than they could have expected. The water with  which they wetted his lips revived him gradually. Pencroft also thought  of mixing with the water some moisture from the titra's flesh which  he had brought. Herbert ran to the beach and returned with two large  bivalve shells. The sailor concocted something which he introduced  between the lips of the engineer, who eagerly drinking it opened his  eyes.    Neb and the reporter were leaning over him.    \"My master! my master!\" cried Neb.    The engineer heard him. He recognized Neb and Spilett, then his other  two companions, and his hand slightly pressed theirs.    A few words again escaped him, which showed what thoughts were, even  then, troubling his brain. This time he was understood. Undoubtedly they  were the same words he had before attempted to utter.    \"Island or continent?\" he murmured.    \"Bother the continent,\" cried Pencroft hastily; \"there is time enough  to see about that, captain! we don't care for anything, provided you are  living.\"    The engineer nodded faintly, and then appeared to sleep.    They respected this sleep, and the reporter began immediately to make  arrangements for transporting Harding to a more comfortable place. Neb,  Herbert, and Pencroft left the cave and directed their steps towards  a high mound crowned with a few distorted trees. On the way the sailor  could not help repeating,--    \"Island or continent! To think of that, when at one's last gasp! What a  man!\"    Arrived at the summit of the mound, Pencroft and his two companions  set to work, with no other tools than their hands, to despoil of its  principal branches a rather sickly tree, a sort of marine fir; with  these branches they made a litter, on which, covered with grass and  leaves, they could carry the engineer.    This occupied them nearly forty minutes, and it was ten o'clock when  they returned to Cyrus Harding whom Spilett had not left.    The engineer was just awaking from the sleep, or rather from the  drowsiness, in which they had found him. The color was returning to his  cheeks, which till now had been as pale as death. He raised himself a  little, looked around him, and appeared to ask where he was.    \"Can you listen to me without fatigue, Cyrus?\" asked the reporter.    \"Yes,\" replied the engineer.    \"It's my opinion,\" said the sailor, \"that Captain Harding will be  able to listen to you still better, if he will have some more grouse  jelly,--for we have grouse, captain,\" added he, presenting him with a  little of this jelly, to which he this time added some of the flesh.    Cyrus Harding ate a little of the grouse, and the rest was divided  among his companions, who found it but a meager breakfast, for they were  suffering extremely from hunger.    \"Well!\" said the sailor, \"there is plenty of food at the Chimneys, for  you must know, captain, that down there, in the south, we have a house,  with rooms, beds, and fireplace, and in the pantry, several dozen of  birds, which our Herbert calls couroucous. Your litter is ready, and as  soon as you feel strong enough we will carry you home.\"    \"Thanks, my friend,\" replied the engineer; \"wait another hour or two,  and then we will set out. And now speak, Spilett.\"    The reporter then told him all that had occurred. He recounted all the  events with which Cyrus was unacquainted, the last fall of the balloon,  the landing on this unknown land, which appeared a desert (whatever it  was, whether island or continent), the discovery of the Chimneys,  the search for him, not forgetting of course Neb's devotion, the  intelligence exhibited by the faithful Top, as well as many other  matters.    \"But,\" asked Harding, in a still feeble voice, \"you did not, then, pick  me up on the beach?\"    \"No,\" replied the reporter.    \"And did you not bring me to this cave?\"    \"No.\"    \"At what distance is this cave from the sea?\"    \"About a mile,\" replied Pencroft; \"and if you are astonished, captain,  we are not less surprised ourselves at seeing you in this place!\"    \"Indeed,\" said the engineer, who was recovering gradually, and who took  great interest in these details, \"indeed it is very singular!\"    \"But,\" resumed the sailor, \"can you tell us what happened after you were  carried off by the sea?\"    Cyrus Harding considered. He knew very little. The wave had torn him  from the balloon net. He sank at first several fathoms. On returning  to the surface, in the half light, he felt a living creature struggling  near him. It was Top, who had sprung to his help. He saw nothing of the  balloon, which, lightened both of his weight and that of the dog, had  darted away like an arrow.    There he was, in the midst of the angry sea, at a distance which could  not be less than half a mile from the shore. He attempted to struggle  against the billows by swimming vigorously. Top held him up by his  clothes; but a strong current seized him and drove him towards the  north, and after half an hour of exertion, he sank, dragging Top  with him into the depths. From that moment to the moment in which he  recovered to find himself in the arms of his friends he remembered  nothing.    \"However,\" remarked Pencroft, \"you must have been thrown on to the  beach, and you must have had strength to walk here, since Neb found your  footmarks!\"    \"Yes... of course,\" replied the engineer, thoughtfully; \"and you found  no traces of human beings on this coast?\"    \"Not a trace,\" replied the reporter; \"besides, if by chance you had met  with some deliverer there, just in the nick of time, why should he have  abandoned you after having saved you from the waves?\"    \"You are right, my dear Spilett. Tell me, Neb,\" added the engineer,  turning to his servant, \"it was not you who... you can't have had a  moment of unconsciousness... during which no, that's absurd.... Do any  of the footsteps still remain?\" asked Harding.    \"Yes, master,\" replied Neb; \"here, at the entrance, at the back of  the mound, in a place sheltered from the rain and wind. The storm has  destroyed the others.\"    \"Pencroft,\" said Cyrus Harding, \"will you take my shoe and see if it  fits exactly to the footprints?\"    The sailor did as the engineer requested. While he and Herbert, guided  by Neb, went to the place where the footprints were to be found, Cyrus  remarked to the reporter,--    \"It is a most extraordinary thing!\"    \"Perfectly inexplicable!\" replied Gideon Spilett.    \"But do not dwell upon it just now, my dear Spilett, we will talk about  it by-and-by.\"    A moment after the others entered.    There was no doubt about it. The engineer's shoe fitted exactly to the  footmarks. It was therefore Cyrus Harding who had left them on the sand.    \"Come,\" said he, \"I must have experienced this unconsciousness which I  attributed to Neb. I must have walked like a somnambulist, without any  knowledge of my steps, and Top must have guided me here, after having  dragged me from the waves... Come, Top! Come, old dog!\"    The magnificent animal bounded barking to his master, and caresses were  lavished on him. It was agreed that there was no other way of accounting  for the rescue of Cyrus Harding, and that Top deserved all the honor of  the affair.    Towards twelve o'clock, Pencroft having asked the engineer if they could  now remove him, Harding, instead of replying, and by an effort which  exhibited the most energetic will, got up. But he was obliged to lean on  the sailor, or he would have fallen.    \"Well done!\" cried Pencroft; \"bring the captain's litter.\"    The litter was brought; the transverse branches had been covered with  leaves and long grass. Harding was laid on it, and Pencroft, having  taken his place at one end and Neb at the other, they started towards  the coast. There was a distance of eight miles to be accomplished; but,  as they could not go fast, and it would perhaps be necessary to stop  frequently, they reckoned that it would take at least six hours to reach  the Chimneys. The wind was still strong, but fortunately it did not  rain. Although lying down, the engineer, leaning on his elbow, observed  the coast, particularly inland. He did not speak, but he gazed; and, no  doubt, the appearance of the country, with its inequalities of ground,  its forests, its various productions, were impressed on his mind.  However, after traveling for two hours, fatigue overcame him, and he  slept.    At half-past five the little band arrived at the precipice, and a short  time after at the Chimneys.    They stopped, and the litter was placed on the sand; Cyrus Harding was  sleeping profoundly, and did not awake.    Pencroft, to his extreme surprise, found that the terrible storm had  quite altered the aspect of the place. Important changes had occurred;  great blocks of stone lay on the beach, which was also covered with a  thick carpet of sea-weed, algae, and wrack. Evidently the sea, passing  over the islet, had been carried right up to the foot of the enormous  curtain of granite. The soil in front of the cave had been torn away  by the violence of the waves. A horrid presentiment flashed across  Pencroft's mind. He rushed into the passage, but returned almost  immediately, and stood motionless, staring at his companions....

But on the morrow he  repaired to the Market, thinking on the way of the ethical distinction  between \"duties of the heart\" and \"duties of the limbs,\" as expounded in  choice Hebrew by Rabbenu Bachja, and he laid out the remnant in lemons.  Then he stationed himself in Petticoat Lane, crying, in his imperfect  English, \"Lemans, verra good lemans, two a penny each, two a penny  each!\"          CHAPTER IV.    THE REDEMPTION OF THE SON AND THE DAUGHTER.      Malka did not have long to wait for her liege lord. He was a  fresh-colored young man of thirty, rather good-looking, with side  whiskers, keen, eager glance, and an air of perpetually doing business.  Though a native of Germany, he spoke English as well as many Lane Jews,  whose comparative impiety was a certificate of British birth. Michael  Birnbaum was a great man in the local little synagogue if only one of  the crowd at \"Duke's Plaizer.\" He had been successively _Gabbai_ and  _Parnass_, or treasurer and president, and had presented the plush  curtain, with its mystical decoration of intersecting triangles, woven  in silk, that hung before the Ark in which the scrolls of the Law were  kept. He was the very antithesis of Moses Ansell. His energy was  restless. From hawking he had risen to a profitable traffic in gold lace  and Brummagem jewelry, with a large _clientele_ all over the country,  before he was twenty. He touched nothing which he did not profit by; and  when he married, at twenty-three, a woman nearly twice his age, the  transaction was not without the usual percentage. Very soon his line was  diamonds,--real diamonds. He carried, a pocket-knife which was a  combination of a corkscrew, a pair of scissors, a file, a pair of  tweezers, a toothpick, and half a dozen other things, and which seemed  an epitome of his character. His temperament was lively, and, like  Ephraim Phillips, he liked music-halls. Fortunately, Malka was too  conscious of her charms to dream of jealousy.    Michael smacked her soundly on the mouth with his lips and said: \"Well,  mother!\"    He called her mother, not because he had any children, but because she  had, and it seemed a pity to multiply domestic nomenclature.    \"Well, my little one,\" said Malka, hugging him fondly. \"Have you made a  good journey this time?\"    \"No, trade is so dull. People won't put their hands in their pockets.  And here?\"    \"People won't take their hands out of their pockets, lazy dogs!  Everybody is striking,--Jews with them. Unheard-of things! The  bootmakers, the capmakers, the furriers! And now they say the tailors  are going to strike; more fools, too, when the trade is so slack. What  with one thing and another (let me put your cravat straight, my little  love), it's just the people who can't afford to buy new clothes that are  hard up, so that they can't afford to buy second-hand clothes either. If  the Almighty is not good to us, we shall come to the Board of Guardians  ourselves.\"    \"Not quite so bad as that, mother,\" laughed Michael, twirling the  massive diamond ring on his finger. \"How's baby? Is it ready to be  redeemed?\"    \"Which baby?\" said Malka, with well-affected agnosticism.    \"Phew!\" whistled Michael. \"What's up now, mother?\"    \"Nothing, my pet, nothing.\"    \"Well, I'm going across. Come along, mother. Oh, wait a minute. I want  to brush this mud off my trousers. Is the clothes-brush here?\"    \"Yes, dearest one,\" said the unsuspecting Malka.    Michael winked imperceptibly, flicked his trousers, and without further  parley ran across the diagonal to Milly's house. Five minutes afterwards  a deputation, consisting of a char-woman, waited upon Malka and said:    \"Missus says will you please come over, as baby is a-cryin' for its  grandma.\"    \"Ah, that must be another pin,\" said Malka, with a gleam of triumph at  her victory. But she did not budge. At the end of five minutes she rose  solemnly, adjusted her wig and her dress in the mirror, put on her  bonnet, brushed away a non-existent speck of dust from her left sleeve,  put a peppermint in her mouth, and crossed the Square, carrying the  clothes-brush in her hand. Milly's door was half open, but she knocked  at it and said to the char-woman:    \"Is Mrs. Phillips in?\"    \"Yes, mum, the company's all upstairs.\"    \"Oh, then I will go up and return her this myself.\"    Malka went straight through the little crowd of guests to Milly, who was  sitting on a sofa with Ezekiel, quiet as a lamb and as good as gold, in  her arms.    \"Milly, my dear,\" she said. \"I have come to bring you back your  clothes-brush. Thank you so much for the loan of it.\"    \"You know you're welcome, mother,\" said Milly, with unintentionally dual  significance. The two ladies embraced. Ephraim Phillips, a  sallow-looking, close-cropped Pole, also kissed his mother-in-law, and  the gold chain that rested on Malka's bosom heaved with the expansion of  domestic pride. Malka thanked God she was not a mother of barren or  celibate children, which is only one degree better than personal  unfruitfulness, and testifies scarce less to the celestial curse.    \"Is that pin-mark gone away yet, Milly, from the precious little  thing?\" said Malka, taking Ezekiel in her arms and disregarding the  transformation of face which in babies precedes a storm.    \"Yes, it was a mere flea-bite,\" said Milly incautiously, adding  hurriedly, \"I always go through his flannels and things most carefully  to see there are no more pins lurking about.\"    \"That is right! Pins are like fleas--you never know where they get to,\"  said Malka in an insidious spirit of compromise. \"Where is Leah?\"    \"She is in the back yard frying the last of the fish. Don't you smell  it?\"    \"It will hardly have time to get cold.\"    \"Well, but I did a dishful myself last night. She is only preparing a  reserve in case the attack be too deadly.\"    \"And where is the _Cohen_?\"    \"Oh, we have asked old Hyams across the Ruins. We expect him round every  minute.\"    At this point the indications of Ezekiel's facial barometer were  fulfilled, and a tempest of weeping shook him.    \"_Na_! Go then! Go to the mother,\" said Malka angrily. \"All my children  are alike. It's getting late. Hadn't you better send across again for  old Hyams?\"    \"There's no hurry, mother,\" said Michael Birnbaum soothingly. \"We must  wait for Sam.\"    \"And who's Sam?\" cried Malka unappeased.    \"Sam is Leah's _Chosan_,\" replied Michael ingenuously.    \"Clever!\" sneered Malka. \"But my grandson is not going to wait for the  son of a proselyte. Why doesn't he come?\"    \"He'll be here in one minute.\"    \"How do you know?\"    \"We came up in the same train. He got in at Middlesborough. He's just  gone home to see his folks, and get a wash and a brush-up. Considering  he's coming up to town merely for the sake of the family ceremony, I  think it would be very rude to commence without him. It's no joke, a  long railway journey this weather. My feet were nearly frozen despite  the foot-warmer.\"    \"My poor lambkin,\" said Malka, melting. And she patted his side  whiskers.    Sam Levine arrived almost immediately, and Leah, fishfork in hand, flew  out of the back-yard kitchen to greet him. Though a member of the tribe  of Levi, he was anything but ecclesiastical in appearance, rather a  representative of muscular Judaism. He had a pink and white complexion,  and a tawny moustache, and bubbled over with energy and animal spirits.  He could give most men thirty in a hundred in billiards, and fifty in  anecdote. He was an advanced Radical in politics, and had a high opinion  of the intelligence of his party. He paid Leah lip-fealty on his entry.    \"What a pity it's Sunday!\" was Leah's first remark when the kissing was  done.    \"No going to the play,\" said Sam ruefully, catching her meaning.    They always celebrated his return from a commercial round by going to  the theatre--the-etter they pronounced it. They went to the pit of the  West End houses rather than patronize the local dress circles for the  same money. There were two strata of Ghetto girls, those who strolled in  the Strand on Sabbath, and those who strolled in the Whitechapel Road.  Leah was of the upper stratum. She was a tall lovely brunette, exuberant  of voice and figure, with coarse red hands. She doted on ice-cream in  the summer, and hot chocolate in the winter, but her love of the theatre  was a perennial passion. Both Sam and she had good ears, and were always  first in the field with the latest comic opera tunes. Leah's healthy  vitality was prodigious. There was a legend in the Lane of such a maiden  having been chosen by a coronet; Leah was satisfied with Sam, who was  just her match. On the heels of Sam came several other guests, notably  Mrs. Jacobs (wife of \"Reb\" Shemuel), with her pretty daughter, Hannah.  Mr. Hyams, the _Cohen_, came last--the Priest whose functions had so  curiously dwindled since the times of the Temples. To be called first to  the reading of the Law, to bless his brethren with symbolic spreadings  of palms and fingers in a mystic incantation delivered, standing  shoeless before the Ark of the Covenant at festival seasons, to redeem  the mother's first-born son when neither parent was of priestly  lineage--these privileges combined with a disability to be with or near  the dead, differentiated his religious position from that of the Levite  or the Israelite. Mendel Hyams was not puffed up about his tribal  superiority, though if tradition were to be trusted, his direct descent  from Aaron, the High Priest, gave him a longer genealogy than Queen  Victoria's. He was a meek sexagenarian, with a threadbare black coat and  a child-like smile. All the pride of the family seemed to be monopolized  by his daughter Miriam, a girl whose very nose Heaven had fashioned  scornful. Miriam had accompanied him out of contemptuous curiosity. She  wore a stylish feather in"]]]
