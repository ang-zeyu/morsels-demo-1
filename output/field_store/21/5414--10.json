From the great height of the Table Mountain*, whatever clouds are  within its influence are attracted when the south-east wind prevails; and  as it increases in violence, these clouds hang over the side of the  mountain, and descend into the valley, sometimes rolling down very near  the town. From the curling of the vapour over the mountain, the  inhabitants predict the arrival of the south-easter, and say, 'The  Table-cloth is spread;' but with all its violence, and the inconvenience  of the dust and sand, it has a good effect, for the climate and air of  the Cape Town (though wonderfully beneficial and refreshing to strangers  after a long voyage) is not reckoned salubrious by the inhabitants, who,  we understood, were at times visited by pains in the chest, sore throats,  and putrid fevers; and the place would certainly be still more unhealthy  were it not for this south-east wind, which burns as it blows, and while  it sweeps disorder before it purifies the air.    [* 3353 Rhineland feet--a Rhineland foot being twelve inches and 5/12  English.]    The Cape is celebrated for producing in the highest perfection all the  tropical and other fruits; but of the few that were in season during our  stay we could not pronounce so favourably. The oranges and bananas in  particular were not equal to those of Rio de Janeiro. The grape we could  only taste from the bottle; that of Constantia, so much famed, has a very  fine, rich, and pleasant flavour, and is an excellent cordial; but much  of the wine that is sold under that name was never made of the grape of  Constantia; for the vineyard is but small, and has credit for a much  greater produce that it could  possibly yield: this reminds us of those eminent masters in the art of  painting, to whom more originals are ascribed than the labour of the  longest life of man could produce.    Wines of their own growth formed a considerable article of traffic here;  and the neatness, regularity, and extent of their wine-vaults, were  extremely pleasing to the eye; but a stranger should not visit more than  one of them in a day; for almost every cask has some peculiarity to  recommend it, and its contents must be tasted.    We found the paper currency here very inconvenient, from its lightness;  as more than one instance occurred among ourselves during our stay, of  its being torn from our hands by the violence of the south-east wind,  when we were about to make a payment in the street, or even at the door  of a shop.    The meat of the Cape was excellent; the black cattle were large, very  strong, and remarkable for the great space between their horns. It was  not uncommon to see twelve, fourteen, or sixteen oxen yoked in pairs to a  waggon, and galloping through the streets of the town, preceded by a  Hottentot boy, who accompanied them on foot, conducting the foremost  couple by a leathern thong, which caution they are compelled to observe  by an order of government, some accidents having formerly happened from  some of these large teams having been imprudently driven through the  streets without any one to lead them; the lash of the charioteer (for the  driver of such a team deserves a more honourable appellation than that of  waggoner) had been sometimes heard, we were told, on board of ships in  the bay.    The sheep are fat, well-flavoured, and remarkable for the weight and size  of their tails. Wonders have been related of them by travellers; but  travellers from this part of the world are privileged to exaggerate in  their narrations, if they choose so to do; the truth however is, that  their tails weigh from eight to sixteen pounds; some few perhaps may be  heavier by a pound or two; but though the sheep itself will very well  endure the voyage to Europe, yet its tall considerably decreases in size  and weight during the passage.    Strangers coming into the bay are served with beef, mutton, etc. by the  Company's butcher, who contracts to supply the Company, its officers and  ships, with meat at a certain price, which is fixed at about three  halfpence per pound, although he may have to purchase the cattle at three  or four times that sum; but in return for this exaction, he has the sole  permission of selling to strangers, and at a much higher price, though  even in that instance his demand is not allowed to exceed a certain  quota. Four-pence _per_ pound was the price given for all the meat served  to our ships after we came in.    During our stay here we made frequent visits to the Company's garden,  pleasantly situated in the midst of the town. The ground on each side of  the principal walk, which was from eight to nine hundred paces in length,  was laid out in fruit and kitchen gardens, and at the upper end was a  paddock where we saw three large ostriches, and a few antelopes. Behind  this paddock was a menagerie, which contained nothing very curious--a  vicious zebra, an eagle, a cassowary, a falcon, a crowned falcon, two of  the birds called secretaries, a crane, a tiger, an hyaena, two wolves, a  jackal, and a very large baboon, composed the entire catalogue of its  inhabitants.    In the town are two churches, one for the Calvinists, and another for the  followers of Luther. In the first of these was a handsome organ; four  large plain columns supported the roof, and the walls were ornamented  with escutcheons and armorial quarterings. The body of the church was  filled with chairs for the women, the men sitting in pews round the  sides. By the pulpit stood an hour-glass, which, we were told, regulated  the duration of the minister's admonition to his congregation. In the  churchyards the gravestones, instead of bearing the names of the  deceased, were all numbered, and the names were registered in a book kept  for the purpose.    Weddings were always solemnized on a Sunday at one or other of these  churches, and the parties were habited in sables, a dress surely more  congenial with the sensations felt on the last than on the first day of  such an union.    To the care of an officer belonging to a regiment in India, who was  returning to Europe in a Danish vessel, Captain Phillip committed his  dispatches; and by this ship every officer gladly embraced the last  opportunity of communicating with their friends and connections, until  they should be enabled to renew their correspondence from the new world  to which they were now bound.    Nothing remaining to be done that need detain the convoy longer in this  port, every article having been procured that could tend to the present  refreshment of the colonists, or to the future advantage of the colony,  the _Sirius_ was unmoored in the evening of Sunday the llth, Captain  Phillip purposing to put to sea the following morning; but the wind at  that time not being favourable, the boats from the _Sirius_ were once  more sent on shore for a load of water, in order than no vessel which  could be filled with an article so essential to the preservation of the  flock might be taken to sea empty.    The south-east wind now beginning to blow, the signal was made for  weighing, and at ten minutes before two in the afternoon of Monday the  12th of November the whole fleet was under sail standing out with a fresh  of wind to the northward of Robin Island.    It was natural to indulge at this moment a melancholy reflection which  obtruded itself upon the mind. The land behind us was the abode of a  civilized people; that before us was the residence of savages. When, if  ever, we might again enjoy the commerce of the world, was doubtful and  uncertain. The refreshments and the pleasures of which we had so  liberally partaken at the Cape, were to be exchanged for coarse fare and  hard labour at New South Wales. All communication with families and  friends now cut off, we were leaving the world behind us, to enter on a  state unknown; and, as if it had been necessary to imprint this idea more  strongly on our minds, and to render the sensation still more poignant,  at the close of the evening we spoke a ship from London*. The metropolis  of our native country, its pleasures, its wealth, and its consequence,  thus accidentally presented to the mind, failed not to afford a most  striking contrast with the object now principally in our view.    [* The _Kent_--southern whaler.]    Before we quitted the Cape Captain Hunter determined the longitude of the  Cape-town in Table-bay to be, by the mean of several sets of lunar  observations taken on board the _Sirius_, 18 degrees 23 minutes 55  seconds east from Greenwich.    SECTION III    Proceed on the voyage  Captain Phillip sails onward in the _Supply_, taking with him three of  the transports  Pass the island of St. Paul  Weather, January 1788  The South Cape of New Holland made  The _Sirius_ and her convoy anchor in the harbour of Botany Bay.    Every precaution being absolutely necessary to guard against a failure of  water on board the different ships, the whole were put upon an allowance  of three pints _per_ man _per diem_ soon after our departure from the  Cape. This regulation was highly proper, as from the probable continuance  of the easterly wind which then blew, the fleet might be detained a  considerable time at sea.    For several days after we had sailed, the wind was unfavourable, and  blowing fresh, with much sea, some time elapsed before we had reached to  the eastward of the Cape of Good Hope. On the 16th, Captain Phillip  signified his intention of proceeding forward in the _Supply_, with the  view of arriving in New South Wales so long before the principal part of  the fleet, as to be able to fix on a clear and proper place for the  settlement. Lieutenant Shortland was at the same time informed, that he  was to quit the fleet with the _Alexander_, taking on with him the  _Scarborough_ and _Friendship_ transports. These three ships had on board  the"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/12573"],[0,"The German Classics of the Nineteenth and Twentieth Centuries, Volume 08 (#13)"],[1,"learned to adapt herself to them. She managed to do all  sorts of kindnesses to old Farmer Rodel, who could not get over his  chagrin at having had to retire so early, and grumbled all day long  about it. She told what a good girl his daughter-in-law was, only that  she did not know how to show it. And when, after scarcely a year, the  first child came, Amrei evinced so much joy at the event, and was so  handy at everything that had to be done, that all in the house were full  of her praise; but according to the fashion of such people they were  more ready to scold her for any trifling omission than to praise her  openly. But Amrei did not expect any praise. She knew so well how to  carry the little baby to its grandfather, and just when to take it away  again, that it pleased and surprised everybody. And when the baby's  first tooth came, and Amrei exhibited it to the grandfather, the old man  said:    \"I will give you a sixpence for the pleasure you have given me. But do  you remember the one you stole from me at the wedding--now you may keep  it honestly.\"    Meanwhile Black Marianne was not forgotten. It was certainly a difficult  task to regain her favor. At first Marianne would have nothing to say to  Barefoot, whose new mistress would not allow her to go to Marianne's,  especially not with the child, as it was always feared that the witch  might do the baby some mischief. Great patience and perseverance were  required to overcome this prejudice, but it was accomplished at last.  Indeed, Little Barefoot brought matters to such a pass that Farmer Rodel  himself several times paid a visit to Black Marianne, a thing which  astonished the entire village. These visits, however, were soon  discontinued, for Marianne once said:    \"I am nearly seventy years old and have got on until now without the  friendship of a farmer; and it's not worth while to make a change now.\"    Naturally enough Damie was often with his sister. But young Farmer Rodel  objected to this, alleging, not without reason, that it would result in  his having to feed the big boy; for in a large house like his one could  not see whether a servant was not giving him all kinds of things to eat.  He therefore forbade Damie to come to the house, except on Sunday  afternoons.    Damie, however, had already seen too much of the comfort of living in a  wealthy farmer's house; his mouth watered for the flesh-pots, and he  wanted to stay there, if only as a servant. Stone-chipping was such a  hungry life. But Barefoot had many objections to make. She told him to  remember that he was already learning a second trade, and that he ought  to keep at it; that it was a mistake to be always wanting to begin  something new, and then to suppose that one could be happy in that way.  She said that one must be happy in the place where one was, if one was  ever to be happy at all. Damie allowed himself to be persuaded for a  time. And so great was the acknowledged authority of Little Barefoot  already, and so natural did it seem that she should dictate to her  brother, that he was always called \"Barefoot's Damie,\" as if he were not  her brother, but her son. And yet he was a head taller than she, and did  not act as if he were subordinate to her. Indeed, he often expressed his  annoyance that he was not considered as good as she, merely because he  did not have a tongue like hers in his head. His discontent with himself  and with his trade he always vented first on his sister. She bore it  patiently, and because he showed before the world that she was obliged  to give him his way, she really gained more influence and power through  this very publicity. For everybody said that it was very good of Amrei  to do what she did for her brother, and she rose in the public  estimation by letting him treat her thus unkindly, while she in turn  cared for him like a mother. She washed and darned for him at night so  steadily, that he was one of the neatest boys in the village; and  instead of taking two stout pairs of shoes, which she received as part  of her wages every half year, she always paid the shoemaker a little  extra money to make two pairs for Damie, while she herself went  barefoot; it was only on Sunday, when she went to church, that she was  seen wearing shoes at all.    Little Barefoot was exceedingly annoyed to find that Damie, though no  one knew why, had become the general butt of all the joking and teasing  in the village. She took him sharply to task for it, and told him he  ought not to tolerate it; but he retorted that she ought to speak to the  people about it, and not to him, for he could not stand up against it.  But that was not to be done--in fact, Damie was secretly not  particularly annoyed by being teased everywhere he went. Sometimes,  indeed, it hurt him to have everybody laugh at him, and to have boys  much younger than himself take liberties with him, but it annoyed him a  great deal more to have people take no notice of him at all, and he  would then try to make a fool of himself and expose himself to insult.    Barefoot, on the other hand, was certainly in some danger of developing  into the hermit Marianne had always professed to recognize in her. She  had once attached herself to one single companion, the daughter of Coaly  Mathew; but this girl had been away for years, working in a factory in  Alsace, and nothing was ever heard of her now. Barefoot lived so  entirely by herself that she was not reckoned at all among the young  people of the village; she was friendly and sociable with those of her  own age, but her only real playmate was Black Marianne. And just because  Barefoot lived so much by herself, she had no influence upon the  behavior of Damie, who, however much he might be teased and tormented,  always had to have the company of others, and could never be alone like  his sister.    But now Damie suddenly emancipated himself; one fine Sunday he exhibited  to his sister some money he had received as an earnest from  Scheckennarre, of Hirlingen, to whom he had hired himself out as a  farmhand.    \"If you had spoken to me about it first,\" said Barefoot, \"I could have  told you of a better place. I would have given you a letter to Farmer  Landfried's wife in Allgau; and there you would have been treated like a  son of the family.\"    \"Oh, don't talk to me about her!\" said Damie crossly. \"She has owed me a  pair of leather breeches she promised me for nearly thirteen years.  Don't you remember?--when we were little, and thought we had only to  knock, and mother and father would open the door. Don't talk to me of  Dame Landfried! Who knows whether she ever thinks of us, or indeed if  she is still alive?\"    \"Yes, she's alive--she's related to the family which I serve, and they  often speak of her. And all her children are married, except one son,  who is to have the farm.\"    \"Now you want to make me feel dissatisfied with my new place,\" said  Damie complainingly, \"and you go and tell me that I might have had a  better one. Is that right?\" And his voice faltered.    \"Oh, don't be so soft-hearted all the time!\" said Barefoot. \"Is what I  said going to take away any of your good fortune? You are always acting  as if the geese were biting you. And now I will only tell you one thing,  and that is, that you should hold fast to what you have, and remain  where you are. It's no use to be like a cuckoo, sleeping on a different  tree every night. I, too, could get other places, but I won't; I have  brought it about that I am well off here. Look you, he who is every  minute running to another place will always be treated like a  stranger--people know that tomorrow he perhaps won't belong to the  house, and so they don't make him at home in it today.\"    \"I don't need your preaching,\" said Damie, and he started to go away in  anger. \"You are always scolding me, and toward everybody else in the  world you are good-natured.\"    \"That's because you are my brother,\" said Barefoot, laughing and  caressing the angry boy.    In truth, a strange difference had developed itself between brother and  sister; Damie had a certain begging propensity, and then again the next  minute showed a kind of pride; Barefoot, on the other hand, was always  good-natured and yielding, but was nevertheless supported by a certain  self-respect, which was never detracted from by her willingness to work  and oblige.    She now succeeded in pacifying her brother, and said:    \"Look, I have an idea. But first you must be good, for the coat must not  lie on an angry heart. Farmer Rodel still has in his possession our dear  father's clothes; you are tall now, and they will just fit you. Now it  will give you a good appearance if you arrive at the farm in such  respectable clothes; then your fellow-servants will see where you come  from, and what worthy parents you had.\"    Damie saw that this was sensible, and Barefoot induced old Farmer  Rodel--with considerable difficulty, for he did not want to give up the  clothes so soon--to hand the garments over to Damie. Barefoot at once  took him up to her room and made him put on his father's coat and vest  then and there. He objected, but when Amrei had set her heart on a  thing, it had to be done. The hat, alone, Damie could not be induced to  wear; when he had put on the coat, Amrei laid her hand on his shoulder  and said:    \"There, now you are my brother and my father, and now the coat is going  to be worn again with a new man in it. Look, Damie,--you have there the  finest coat of honor in the world; hold it in honor, and be as worthy  and honest in it as our dear father was.\"    She could say no more. She laid her head on her brother's shoulder, and  tears fell upon the paternal coat which had once more been brought to  light.    \"You say that I am soft-hearted,\" said Damie, \"and you are much worse  yourself.\"    And Barefoot was indeed deeply and quickly moved by anything; but she  was strong and light-hearted like a child.
