Across the mountains--with  whom?\"    \"The man who brought you here.\"    \"Who's he?\"    \"I don't know.\"    \"You don't know? He looks like a shifty little rat to me.\"    \"He's big enough, Jack.\"    Such small praise was enough to set Donnegan's heart thumping.    \"Besides, father told me to go with him, to trust him.\"    \"Ah!\" There was an abrupt chilling and lowering of Landis' voice. \"The  colonel knows him? He's one of the colonel's men?\"    Plainly the colonel was to him as the rod to the child.    \"Why didn't you come directly to me?\"    \"We thought it would be better not to.\"    \"H'm-m. Your guide--well, what was the colonel's idea in sending you  here? Heavens above, doesn't he know that a mining camp is no place for  a young girl? And you haven't a sign of a chaperon, Lou! What the devil  can I do? What was in his mind?\"    \"You haven't written for a long time.\"    \"Good Lord! Written! Letters! Does he think I have time for letters?\"  The lie came smoothly enough. \"Working day and night?\"    Donnegan smoothed his whiskers and grinned into the night. Landis might  prove better game than he had anticipated.    \"He worried,\" said the girl, and her voice was as even as ever. \"He  worried, and sent me to find out if anything is wrong.\"    Then: \"Nonsense! What is there to worry about? Lou, I'm half inclined to  think that the colonel doesn't trust me!\"    She did not answer. Was she reading beneath the boisterous assurance of  Landis?    \"One thing is clear to me--and to you, too, I hope. The first thing is  to send you back in a hurry.\"    Still no answer.    \"Lou, do you distrust me?\"    At length she managed to speak, but it was with some difficulty: \"There  is another reason for sending me.\"    \"Tell me.\"    \"Can't you guess, Jack?\"    \"I'm not a mind reader.\"    \"The cad,\" said Donnegan through his teeth.    \"It's the old reason.\"    \"Money?\"    \"Yes.\"    A shadow swept across the side of the tent; it was Landis waving his arm  carelessly.    \"If that's all, I can fix you up and send you back with enough to carry  the colonel along. Look here--why, I have five hundred with me. Take it,  Lou. There's more behind it, but the colonel mustn't think that there's  as much money in the mines as people say. No idea how much living costs  up here. Heavens, no! And the prices for labor! And then they shirk the  job from dawn to dark. I have to watch 'em every minute, I tell you!\"    He sighed noisily.    \"But the end of it is, dear\"--how that small word tore into the heart of  Donnegan, who crouched outside--\"that you must go back tomorrow morning.  I'd send you tonight, if I could. As a matter of fact, I don't trust the  red-haired rat who--\"    The girl interrupted while Donnegan still had control of his  hair-trigger temper.    \"You forget, Jack. Father sent me here, but he did not tell me to come  back.\"    At this Jack Landis burst into an enormous laughter.    \"You don't mean, Lou, that you actually intend to stay on?\"    \"What else can I mean?\"    \"Of course it makes it awkward if the colonel didn't expressly tell you  just what to do. I suppose he left it to my discretion, and I decide  definitely that you must go back at once.\"    \"I can't do it.\"    \"Lou, don't you hear me saying that I'll take the responsibility? If  your father blames you let him tell me--\"    He broke down in the middle of his sentence and another of those  uncomfortable little pauses ensued. Donnegan knew that their eyes were  miserably upon each other; the man tongue-tied by his guilt; the girl  wretchedly guessing at the things which lay behind her fiance's words.    \"I'm sorry you don't want me here.\"    \"It isn't that, but--\"    He apparently expected to be interrupted, but she waited coolly for him  to finish the sentence, and, of course, he could not. After all, for a  helpless girl she had a devilish effective way of muzzling Landis.  Donnegan chuckled softly in admiration.    All at once she broke through the scene; her voice did not rise or  harden, but it was filled with finality, as though she were weary of the  interview.    \"I'm tired out; it's been a hard ride, Jack. You go home now and look me  up again any time tomorrow.\"    \"I--Lou--I feel mighty bad about having you up here in this infernal  tent, when the camp is full, and--\":    \"You can't lie across the entrance to my tent and guard me, Jack.  Besides, I don't need you for that. The man who's with me will protect  me.\"    \"He doesn't look capable of protecting a cat!\"    \"My father said that in any circumstances he would be able to take care  of me.\"    This reply seemed to overwhelm Landis.    \"The colonel trusts him as far as all that?\" he muttered. \"Then I  suppose you're safe enough. But what about comfort, Lou?\"    \"I've done without comfort all my life. Run along, Jack. And take this  money with you. I can't have it.\"    \"But, didn't the colonel send--\"    \"You can express it through to him. To me it's--not pleasant to take  it.\"    \"Why, Lou, you don't mean--\"    \"Good night, Jack. I don't mean anything, except that I'm tired.\"    The shadow swept along the wall of the tent again. Donnegan, with a  shaking pulse, saw the profile of the girl and the man approach as he  strove to take her in his arms and kiss her good night. And then one  slender bar of shadow checked Landis.    \"Not tonight.\"    \"Lou, you aren't angry with me?\"    \"No. But you know I have queer ways. Just put this down as one of them.  I can't explain.\"    There was a muffled exclamation and Landis went from the tent and strode  down the hill; he was instantly lost in the night. But Donnegan, turning  to the entrance flap, called softly. He was bidden to come in, and when  he raised the flap he saw her sitting with her hands clasped loosely and  resting upon her knees. Her lips were a little parted, and colorless;  her eyes were dull with a mist; and though she rallied herself a little,  the wanderer could see that she was only half-aware of him.    The face which he saw was a milestone in his life. For he had loved her  jealously, fiercely before; but seeing her now, dazed, hurt, and  uncomplaining, tenderness came into Donnegan. It spread to his heart  with a strange pain and made his hands tremble.    All that he said was: \"Is there anything you need?\"    \"Nothing,\" she replied, and he backed out and away.    But in that small interval he had turned out of the course of his gay,  selfish life. If Jack Landis had hurt her like this--if she loved him so  truly--then Jack Landis she should have.    There was an odd mixture of emotions in Donnegan; but he felt most  nearly like the poor man from whose hand his daughter tugs back and  looks wistfully, hopelessly, into the bright window at all the toys.  What pain is there greater than the pain that comes to the poor man in  such a time? He huddles his coat about him, for his heart is as cold as  a Christmas day; and if it would make his child happy, he would pour out  his heart's blood on the snow.    Such was the grief of Donnegan as he backed slowly out into the night.  Though Jack Landis were fixed as high as the moon he would tear him out  of his place and give him to the girl.          14      The lantern went out in the tent; she was asleep; and when he knew that,  Donnegan went down into The Corner. He had been trying to think out a  plan of action, and finding nothing better than to thrust a gun stupidly  under Landis' nose and make him mark time, Donnegan went into Lebrun's  place. As if he hoped the bustle there would supply him with ideas.    Lebrun's was going full blast. It was not filled with the shrill mirth  of Milligan's. Instead, all voices were subdued to a point here. The  pitch was never raised. If a man laughed, he might show his teeth but he  took good care that he did not break into the atmosphere of the room.  For there was a deadly undercurrent of silence which would not tolerate  more than murmurs on the part of others. Men sat grim-faced over the  cards, the man who was winning, with his cold, eager eye; the chronic  loser of the night with his iron smile; the professional, ever debonair,  with the dull eye which comes from looking too often and too closely  into the terrible face of chance. A very keen observer might have  observed a resemblance between those men and Donnegan.    Donnegan roved swiftly here and there. The calm eye and the smooth play  of an obvious professional in a linen suit kept him for a moment at one  table, looking on; then he went to the games, and after changing the  gold which Jack Landis had given as alms so silver dollars, he lost it  with precision upon the wheel.    He went on, from table to table, from group to group. In Lebrun's his  clothes were not noticed. It was no matter whether he played or did not  play, whether he won or lost; they were too busy to notice. But he came  back, at length, to the man who wore the linen coat and who won so  easily. Something in his method of dealing appeared to interest Donnegan  greatly.    It was jackpot; the chips were piled high; and the man in the linen coat  was dealing again. How deftly he mixed the cards!    Indeed, all about him was elegant, from the turn of his black cravat to  the cut of the coat. An inebriate passed, shouldered and disturbed his  chair, and rising to put it straight again, the gambler was seen to be  about the height and build of Donnegan.    Donnegan studied him with the interest of an artist. Here was a man,  harking back to Nelly Lebrun and her love of brilliance, who would  probably win her preference over Jack Landis for the simple reason that  he was different. That is, there was more in his cravat to attract  astonished attention in The Corner than there was in all the silver lace  of Landis. And he was a man's man, no doubt of that. On the inebriate he  had flashed one glance of fire, and his lean hand had stirred uneasily"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/1007"],[0,"Divine Comedy, Cary's Translation, Paradise (#13)"],[1,"that, which the world cannot see,  The grace divine, albeit e'en his sight  Reach not its utmost depth.\"  Like to the lark,  That warbling in the air expatiates long,  Then, trilling out his last sweet melody,  Drops satiate with the sweetness; such appear'd  That image stampt by the' everlasting pleasure,  Which fashions like itself all lovely things.    I, though my doubting were as manifest,  As is through glass the hue that mantles it,  In silence waited not: for to my lips  \"What things are these?\"  involuntary rush'd,  And forc'd a passage out: whereat I mark'd  A sudden lightening and new revelry.  The eye was kindled: and the blessed sign  No more to keep me wond'ring and suspense,  Replied: \"I see that thou believ'st these things,  Because I tell them, but discern'st not how;  So that thy knowledge waits not on thy faith:  As one who knows the name of thing by rote,  But is a stranger to its properties,  Till other's tongue reveal them.  Fervent love  And lively hope with violence assail  The kingdom of the heavens, and overcome  The will of the Most high; not in such sort  As man prevails o'er man; but conquers it,  Because 't is willing to be conquer'd, still,  Though conquer'd, by its mercy conquering.    \"Those, in the eye who live the first and fifth,  Cause thee to marvel, in that thou behold'st  The region of the angels deck'd with them.  They quitted not their bodies, as thou deem'st,  Gentiles but Christians, in firm rooted faith,  This of the feet in future to be pierc'd,  That of feet nail'd already to the cross.  One from the barrier of the dark abyss,  Where never any with good will returns,  Came back unto his bones.  Of lively hope  Such was the meed; of lively hope, that wing'd  The prayers sent up to God for his release,  And put power into them to bend his will.  The glorious Spirit, of whom I speak to thee,  A little while returning to the flesh,  Believ'd in him, who had the means to help,  And, in believing, nourish'd such a flame  Of holy love, that at the second death  He was made sharer in our gamesome mirth.  The other, through the riches of that grace,  Which from so deep a fountain doth distil,  As never eye created saw its rising,  Plac'd all his love below on just and right:  Wherefore of grace God op'd in him the eye  To the redemption of mankind to come;  Wherein believing, he endur'd no more  The filth of paganism, and for their ways  Rebuk'd the stubborn nations.  The three nymphs,  Whom at the right wheel thou beheldst advancing,  Were sponsors for him more than thousand years  Before baptizing.  O how far remov'd,  Predestination! is thy root from such  As see not the First cause entire: and ye,  O mortal men! be wary how ye judge:  For we, who see our Maker, know not yet  The number of the chosen: and esteem  Such scantiness of knowledge our delight:  For all our good is in that primal good  Concentrate, and God's will and ours are one.\"    So, by that form divine, was giv'n to me  Sweet medicine to clear and strengthen sight,  And, as one handling skillfully the harp,  Attendant on some skilful songster's voice  Bids the chords vibrate, and therein the song  Acquires more pleasure; so, the whilst it spake,  It doth remember me, that I beheld  The pair of blessed luminaries move.  Like the accordant twinkling of two eyes,  Their beamy circlets, dancing to the sounds.          CANTO XXI    Again mine eyes were fix'd on Beatrice,  And with mine eyes my soul, that in her looks  Found all contentment.  Yet no smile she wore  And, \"Did I smile,\" quoth she, \"thou wouldst be straight  Like Semele when into ashes turn'd:  For, mounting these eternal palace-stairs,  My beauty, which the loftier it climbs,  As thou hast noted, still doth kindle more,  So shines, that, were no temp'ring interpos'd,  Thy mortal puissance would from its rays  Shrink, as the leaf doth from the thunderbolt.  Into the seventh splendour are we wafted,  That underneath the burning lion's breast  Beams, in this hour, commingled with his might,  Thy mind be with thine eyes: and in them mirror'd  The shape, which in this mirror shall be shown.\"  Whoso can deem, how fondly I had fed  My sight upon her blissful countenance,  May know, when to new thoughts I chang'd, what joy  To do the bidding of my heav'nly guide:  In equal balance poising either weight.    Within the crystal, which records the name,  (As its remoter circle girds the world)  Of that lov'd monarch, in whose happy reign  No ill had power to harm, I saw rear'd up,  In colour like to sun-illumin'd gold.    A ladder, which my ken pursued in vain,  So lofty was the summit; down whose steps  I saw the splendours in such multitude  Descending, ev'ry light in heav'n, methought,  Was shed thence.  As the rooks, at dawn of day  Bestirring them to dry their feathers chill,  Some speed their way a-field, and homeward some,  Returning, cross their flight, while some abide  And wheel around their airy lodge; so seem'd  That glitterance, wafted on alternate wing,  As upon certain stair it met, and clash'd  Its shining. And one ling'ring near us, wax'd  So bright, that in my thought: said: \"The love,  Which this betokens me, admits no doubt.\"    Unwillingly from question I refrain,  To her, by whom my silence and my speech  Are order'd, looking for a sign: whence she,  Who in the sight of Him, that seeth all,  Saw wherefore I was silent, prompted me  T' indulge the fervent wish; and I began:  \"I am not worthy, of my own desert,  That thou shouldst answer me; but for her sake,  Who hath vouchsaf'd my asking, spirit blest!  That in thy joy art shrouded! say the cause,  Which bringeth thee so near: and wherefore, say,  Doth the sweet symphony of Paradise  Keep silence here, pervading with such sounds  Of rapt devotion ev'ry lower sphere?\"  \"Mortal art thou in hearing as in sight;\"  Was the reply: \"and what forbade the smile  Of Beatrice interrupts our song.  Only to yield thee gladness of my voice,  And of the light that vests me, I thus far  Descend these hallow'd steps: not that more love  Invites me; for lo! there aloft, as much  Or more of love is witness'd in those flames:  But such my lot by charity assign'd,  That makes us ready servants, as thou seest,  To execute the counsel of the Highest.\"  \"That in this court,\" said I, \"O sacred lamp!  Love no compulsion needs, but follows free  Th' eternal Providence, I well discern:  This harder find to deem, why of thy peers  Thou only to this office wert foredoom'd.\"  I had not ended, when, like rapid mill,  Upon its centre whirl'd the light; and then  The love, that did inhabit there, replied:  \"Splendour eternal, piercing through these folds,  Its virtue to my vision knits, and thus  Supported, lifts me so above myself,  That on the sov'ran essence, which it wells from,  I have the power to gaze: and hence the joy,  Wherewith I sparkle, equaling with my blaze  The keenness of my sight.  But not the soul,  That is in heav'n most lustrous, nor the seraph  That hath his eyes most fix'd on God, shall solve  What thou hast ask'd: for in th' abyss it lies  Of th' everlasting statute sunk so low,  That no created ken may fathom it.  And, to the mortal world when thou return'st,  Be this reported; that none henceforth dare  Direct his footsteps to so dread a bourn.  The mind, that here is radiant, on the earth  Is wrapt in mist.  Look then if she may do,  Below, what passeth her ability,  When she is ta'en to heav'n.\"  By words like these  Admonish'd, I the question urg'd no more;  And of the spirit humbly sued alone  T' instruct me of its state.  \"'Twixt either shore  Of Italy, nor distant from thy land,  A stony ridge ariseth, in such sort,  The thunder doth not lift his voice so high,  They call it Catria: at whose foot a cell  Is sacred to the lonely Eremite,  For worship set apart and holy rites.\"  A third time thus it spake; then added: \"There  So firmly to God's service I adher'd,  That with no costlier viands than the juice  Of olives, easily I pass'd the heats  Of summer and the winter frosts, content  In heav'n-ward musings.  Rich were the returns  And fertile, which that cloister once was us'd  To render to these heavens: now 't is fall'n  Into a waste so empty, that ere long  Detection must lay bare its vanity  Pietro Damiano there was I yclept:  Pietro the sinner, when before I dwelt  Beside the Adriatic, in the house  Of our blest Lady.  Near upon my close  Of mortal life, through much importuning  I was constrain'd to wear the hat that still  From bad to worse it shifted.--Cephas came;  He came, who was the Holy Spirit's vessel,  Barefoot and lean, eating their bread, as chanc'd,  At the first table.  Modern Shepherd's need  Those who on either hand may prop and lead them,  So burly are they grown: and from behind  Others to hoist them.  Down the palfrey's sides  Spread their broad mantles, so as both the beasts  Are cover'd with one skin.  O patience! thou  That lookst on this and doth endure so long.\"  I at those accents saw the splendours down  From step to step alight, and wheel, and wax,  Each circuiting, more beautiful.  Round this  They came, and stay'd them; uttered them a shout  So loud, it hath no likeness here: nor I  Wist what it spake, so deaf'ning was the thunder.          CANTO XXII    Astounded, to the guardian of my steps  I turn'd me, like the chill, who always runs  Thither for succour, where he trusteth most,  And she was like the mother, who her son  Beholding pale and breathless, with her voice  Soothes him, and he is cheer'd; for thus she spake,  Soothing me: \"Know'st not thou, thou art in heav'n?  And know'st not thou, whatever is in heav'n,  Is holy, and that nothing there is done  But is done zealously and well?  Deem now,  What change in thee the song, and what my smile  had wrought, since thus the shout had pow'r to move thee.  In which couldst thou have understood their prayers,  The vengeance were already known to thee,  Which thou must witness ere thy mortal hour,  "]]]
