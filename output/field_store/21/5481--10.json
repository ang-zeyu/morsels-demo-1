[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/13854"],[0,"The Old Franciscan Missions Of California (#13)"],[1,"e;--the Missions had gathered two  hundred thousand bushels in a single harvest. All manufacturing in the  province--weaving, tanning, leather-work, flour-mills, soap-making--was  carried on exclusively by the pupils of the Franciscans. It was more  than doubtful whether they could be got to work under any other  management, and a sudden cessation of labor might ruin the whole  territory.\"    Something must be done, so, after consultation with some of the more  advanced of the padres, the governor issued a proclamation July 25,  1826, announcing to the Indians that those who desired to leave the  Missions might do so, provided they had been Christians from childhood,  or for fifteen years, were married, or at least not minors, and had some  means of gaining a livelihood. The Indians must apply to the commandant  at the presidio, who, after obtaining from the padre a report, was to  issue a written permit entitling the neophyte and his family to go where  they chose, their names being erased from the Mission register. The  result of this might readily be foreseen. Few could take advantage of  it, and those that did soon came in contact with vultures of the  \"superior race,\" who proceeded to devour them and their substance.    Between July 29 and August 3, 1830, Echeandia had the California  _diputacion_ discuss his fuller plans, which they finally approved.  These provided for the gradual transformation of the Missions into  pueblos, beginning with those nearest the presidios and pueblos, of  which one or two were to be secularized within a year, and the rest as  rapidly as experience proved practicable. Each neophyte was to have a  share in the Mission lands and other property. The padres might remain  as curates, or establish a new line of Missions among the hitherto  unreached Indians as they should choose. Though this plan was passed, it  was not intended that it should be carried out until approved by the  general government of Mexico.    All this seems singular to us now, reading three quarters of a century  later, for, March 8, 1830, Manuel Victoria was appointed political chief  in Echeandia's stead; but as he did not reach San Diego until November  or December, and in the meantime a new element had been introduced into  the secularization question in the person of Jose Maria Padres,  Echeandia resolved upon a bold stroke. He delayed meeting Victoria,  lured him up to Santa Barbara, and kept him there under various  pretexts until he had had time to prepare and issue a decree. This was  dated January 6, 1831. It was a political trick, \"wholly illegal,  uncalled for, and unwise.\" He decreed immediate secularization of all  the Missions, and the turning into towns of Carmel and San Gabriel. The  ayuntamiento of Monterey, in accordance with the decree, chose a  commissioner for each of the seven Missions of the district. These were  Juan B. Alvarado for San Luis Obispo, Jose Castro for San Miguel,  Antonio Castro for San Antonio, Tiburcio Castro for Soledad, Juan  Higuera for San Juan Bautista, Sebastian Rodriguez for Santa Cruz, and  Manuel Crespo for San Carlos. Castro and Alvarado were sent to San  Miguel and San Luis Obispo respectively, where they read the decree and  made speeches to the Indians; at San Miguel, Alvarado made a  spread-eagle speech from a cart and used all his eloquence to persuade  the Indians to adopt the plan of freemen. \"Henceforth their trials were  to be over. No tyrannical priest could compel them to work. They were to  be citizens in a free and glorious republic, with none to molest or make  them afraid.\" Then he called for those who wished to enjoy these  blessings of freedom to come to the right, while those who were content  to remain under the hideous bondage of the Missions could go to the  left. Imagine his surprise and the chill his oratory received when all  but a small handful quickly went to the left, and those who at first  went to the right speedily joined the majority. At San Luis and San  Antonio the Indians also preferred \"slavery.\"    By this time Victoria began to see that he was being played with, so he  hurried to Monterey and demanded the immediate surrender of the office  to which he was entitled. One of his first acts was to nullify  Echeandia's decree, and to write to Mexico and explain fully that it was  undoubtedly owing to the influence of Padres, whom he well knew. But  before the end of the year Echeandia and his friends rose in rebellion,  deposed, and exiled Victoria. Owing to the struggles then going on in  Mexico, which culminated in Santa Anna's dictatorship, the revolt of  Echeandia was overlooked and Figueroa appointed governor in his stead.    For a time Figueroa held back the tide of secularization, while Carlos  Carrillo, the Californian delegate to the Mexican Congress, was doing  all he could to keep the Missions and the Pious Fund intact. Figueroa  then issued a series of provisional regulations on gradual emancipation,  hoping to be relieved from further responsibility by the Mexican  government.    This only came in the passage of an Act, August 17, 1833, decreeing full  secularization. The Act also provided for the colonization of both the  Californias, the expenses of this latter move to be borne by the  proceeds gained from the distribution of the Mission property. A shrewd  politician named Hijars was to be made governor of Upper California for  the purpose of carrying this law into effect.    But now Figueroa seemed to regret his first action. Perhaps it was  jealousy that Hijars should have been appointed to his stead. He  bitterly opposed Hijars, refused to give up the governorship, and after  considerable \"pulling and hauling,\" issued secularization orders of his  own, greatly at variance with those promulgated by the Mexican Cortes,  and proceeded to set them in operation.    Ten Missions were fully secularized in 1834, and six others in the  following year. And now came the general scramble for Mission property.  Each succeeding governor, freed from too close supervision by the  general government in Mexico, which was passing through trials and  tribulations of its own, helped himself to as much as he could get.  Alvarado, from 1836 to 1842, plundered on every hand, and Pio Pico was  not much better. When he became governor, there were few funds with  which to carry on the affairs of the country, and he prevailed upon the  assembly to pass a decree authorizing the renting or the sale of the  Mission property, reserving only the church, a curate's house, and a  building for a court-house. From the proceeds the expenses of conducting  the services of the church were to be provided, but there was no  disposition made as to what should be done to secure the funds for that  purpose. Under this decree the final acts of spoliation were  consummated.    The padres took the matter in accordance with their individual  temperaments. Some were hopefully cheerful, and did the best they could  for their Indian charges; others were sulky and sullen, and retired to  the chambers allotted to them, coming forth only when necessary duty  called; still others were belligerent, and fought everything and  everybody, and, it must be confessed, generally with just cause.    As for the Indians, the effect was exactly as all thoughtful men had  foreseen. Those who received property seldom made good use of it, and  soon lost it. Cattle were neglected, tools unused, for there were none  to compel their care or use. Consequently it was easy to convert them  into money, which was soon gambled or drunk away. Rapidly they sank from  worse to worse, until now only a few scattered settlements remain of the  once vast number, thirty thousand or more, that were reasonably happy  and prosperous under the rule of the padres.        CHAPTER IX    SAN DIEGO DE ALCALA    The story of the founding of San Diego by Serra has already been given.  It was the beginning of the realization of his fondest hopes. The early  troubles with the Indians delayed conversions, but in 1773 Serra  reported that some headway had been made. He gives the original name of  the place as _Cosoy, in_ 32 deg. 43', built on a hill two gunshots from the  shore, and facing the entrance to the port at Point Guijarros. The  missionaries left in charge were Padres Fernando Parron and  Francisco Gomez.    About the middle of July ill health compelled Parron to retire to Lower  California and Gomez to Mexico, and Padres Luis Jayme and Francisco  Dumetz took their places.    San Diego was in danger of being abandoned for lack of provisions, for  in 1772 Padre Crespi, who was at San Carlos, writes that on the  thirtieth of March of that year \"the mail reached us with the lamentable  news that this Mission of San Diego was to be abandoned for lack of  victuals.\" Serra then sent him with \"twenty-two mules, and with them  fifteen half-loads of flour\" for their succor. Padres Dumetz and Cambon  had gone out to hunt for food to the Lower California Missions. The same  scarcity was noticed at San Gabriel, and the padres, \"for a considerable  time, already, had been using the supplies which were on hand to found  the Mission of San Buenaventura; and though they have _drawn their belts  tight_ there remains to them provisions only for two months and a half.\"    Fortunately help came; so the work continued.    The region of San Diego was well peopled. At the time of the founding  there were eleven rancherias within a radius of ten leagues. They must  have been of a different type from most of the Indians of the coast,  for, from the first, as the old Spanish chronicler reports, they were  insolent, arrogant, and thievish. They lived on grass seeds, fish,  and rabbits.    In 1774, the separation of the Mission from the presidio was decided  upon, in order to remove the neophytes from the evil influences of the  soldiers. The site chosen was six miles up the valley (named _Nipaguay_  by the Indians), and so"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/13858"],[0,"The Laws Of War, Affecting Commerce And Shipping (#13)"],[1,"himself with the proprietor's rights, detain  them, with intent to appropriate to himself, in the same manner, in  every respect, as he may seize _res nullius_ in the time of peace; but  it does not follow from thence that the effect of these two actions is  the same, when applied to objects of so different a condition, or that  the right of war alone, without cession or renunciation, is a title  sufficient for a full property.    By the Laws of War the right and power _of possession_ is in the  captor; the _right of property_ remains in the proprietor. This right  of war, which is personal in the captor, not being capable of cession,  cannot bind a third person, who acquires the prize by recapture during  war; and nothing prohibits the original proprietor from prosecuting  his rights against him; accordingly, without making any distinction  between conquest, booty, or prize; the goods taken by the enemy,  however legal that capture might be, however certain the possession of  them might be, do not become his full property till the moment of  peace; and that during the whole course of the war it may be claimed  by the first proprietor from the hands of every third possessor. From  this it follows that every recapture, made at any period of the war  whatever, whether the capture may have been legal, or whether it may  have been illegal; whether the recapture be made by a Sovran, or by a  privateer; ought to be restored to the original owner on a just  repayment of the costs and damages of every recaptor, unless the  illegality of the recapture precludes the recaptor from the privilege  of demanding the indemnification.[130]    [Sidenote: Salvage.]    The costs and damages paid to the recaptor are termed Salvage. It was  the ancient law of this country, that a possession of twenty-four  hours was a sufficient conversion of the property, and unless it was  reclaimed before _sundown_, the owner was divested of his property.  Thus there was a complete obliteration of the rights of former owners.  This was the ancient law of England, and was in accordance with the  ancient law of Europe.    This rule has been receded from in this country, since the increase of  her commerce. During the time of the usurpation, when England was  becoming commercial, an alteration was effected by the ordinance of  1649, which directed a restitution, upon salvage, to British subjects;  and the same indulgent rule was continued afterwards, when this  country became still more commercial.    This country, as a commercial country, has thus departed from the old  law, and has made a new and peculiar law for itself, in favour of  merchant property recaptured, introducing a policy not then introduced  by other countries, and differing from its own ancient practice.    [Sidenote: Recaptures converted into Ships of War are not restored.]    There is one exception to this law. The Prize Act provides that if a  recaptured ship, originally taken by her Majesty's enemies, shall  appear to have been by them \"_set forth as a ship or vessel of war_,\"  the said ship or vessel shall not be restored to the former owners or  proprietors; but shall, in all cases, whether retaken by any of Her  Majesty's ships, or by any privateer, be adjudged lawful prize for the  benefit of the captors. When the former character of the vessel has  been once obliterated by her conversion into a ship of war, the title  of the former owner, and his claim to restitution, are extinguished,  and cannot be revived by any subsequent variation of the character of  the vessel.    _Setting forth_ does not necessarily mean sending out of port with a  regular commission. It is sufficient if she has been used as part of  the _national_ force of the enemy, by those in _competent_  authority.[131]    [Sidenote: Capture a material question in cases of Recapture.]    As it has been stated above, in cases of recapture, the material  question is, whether there was such a capture made by the enemy, as to  found a case of re-capture.    This is settled by the question whether the enemy have an effectual  possession; by this is not meant the _complete_ and firm possession  obtained by condemnation in a Court of Prize, but that effectual  possession, that if not interrupted by recapture, would have enabled  the captor to exercise rights of war over her. For this purpose it is  not necessary that the possession should be _long_ maintained. The  following are some examples of such effectual possession.    An English merchantman, separated from her convoy during a storm, was  brought to by an enemy's lugger, which came up and told the master to  stay by her till the storm was abated, when they would send a man on  board; a British frigate coming up afterwards chased the lugger and  took her, thus releasing the merchantman; the frigate was held  entitled to salvage.[132]    But when a small English vessel, armed with two swivels, forced a  privateer row-boat from Dunkirk to strike, but was not able to board  her, because the English vessel has only three men, and no arms but  the swivels,--the Frenchman being filled with a well armed crew; and  subsequently, the row-boat was forced to put into the port of Ostend,  then the port of an ally; this might not be a capture under the act,  so much as it was under the general maritime law.    A vessel brought out of port, and which was in the power, though not  in the actual occupation of the enemy, was thus rescued from  considerable peril, was held to be recaptured.[133]    Similarly, with a vessel abandoned by the enemy, having possession of  her, through the terror of an approaching force.[134]    There is no claim to Salvage where the property rescued was not in the  possession of the enemy, or so nearly as to be certainly and  inevitably under his grasp.    [Sidenote: Recapture of Property of Allies.]    England restores the Recaptured Property of her Allies, on the payment  of salvage; but if instances can be given of British property retaken  by them, and condemned as prize, the Court of Admiralty will determine  their cases according to their own rule.[135]    [Sidenote: Recapture of Neutral Property.]    It is not the practice of modern nations to grant Salvage on the  Recapture of Neutral Vessels; and upon this plain principle, that the  liberation of a clear neutral from the hand of the enemy, is no  essential service to him; for the enemy would be compelled by the  tribunals of his own country, after he had carried the neutral into  port, to release him with costs and damages, for the injurious seizure  and detention. This proceeds on the supposition, that those tribunals  would duly respect the law of nations; a presumption which, in the  wars of civilized states, each belligerent is bound to entertain in  their respective dealings with neutrals. But in the wild hostilities  declared and practised by France in the Revolutionary War, there was a  constant struggle between the governing powers of France and the  maritime courts, which should most outrage the rights of neutral  property; the liberation of neutral property out of their hands then  came to be deemed, not only by Lord Stowell, but by the neutrals  themselves, a substantial benefit; and salvage for such service was  not only awarded, but thankfully paid.[136]    [Sidenote: Jus Postliminii.]    The rule by which things taken by the enemy are restored to their  former owner, upon coming again under the power of the nation to which  they formerly belonged, is termed _jus postliminii_, or the right of  postliminy. Real property, which is easily identified, is more  completely within the right of postliminy than moveable property,  which is more transitory in its nature, and less easily recognized.  During war, the right of postliminy can only be claimed in the  tribunals of the belligerent powers, and not in the courts of  neutrals; for by a general law of nations, neutrals have no right to  enquire into any captures, except such as are an infringement of their  own neutrality.[137]    [Sidenote: Costs and Damages to Owners for invalid Seizures.]    It often happens that captains of ships of war and privateers make  seizures of native or neutral vessels, under the impression that such  vessels are occupied in illicit trade or other condemnatory acts. This  may arise from error, and in such cases the vessel is restored to the  owner by the prize court; but still there may be circumstances  justifying the seizure, though not condemnation; and if condemnation  is not granted, the owner sets up a claim for any damage that may have  occurred to his vessel.    And the rule is, that where the capture is not justifiable, a captor  is answerable for every damage.[138]    But if a seizure is justifiable, all that the law requires is that the  captor shall be held responsible for _due diligence_; it is not enough  that the captor should use as much caution as he would in his own  affairs, the law requires that there should be no _deficiency of due  diligence_.[139]    When property is confided by an owner to another person, the care that  the owner would take of his own property may be a reasonable criterion  of the care that he may expect his agent to take. But in the case of  capture, there is no confidence reposed, nor any voluntary election of  the person in whose care the property is left. It is a compulsory act  of justifiable force, but still of such force as removes from the  owner any responsibility for the imprudent conduct of the  prize-master. Hence, where the prize-master refused to take a pilot,  and the ship and cargo were lost, restitution in value was decreed.          CHAPTER III.        SECTION I.        _Neutrality_.
