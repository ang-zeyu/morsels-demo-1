Put arm of switch on point No. 1 and lower one of the top disks in  jar No. 1 and make contact with wire above jars. The current then  will flow through the motor. The speed for each point can be  determined by lowering top disks in jars. The top disk in jar No.  2 is lower down than in No. 1 and so on for No. 3 and No. 4. The  connection between point No. 5 on switch, direct to wire across  jars, gives full current and full speed.        ** How to Build a Toboggan Sled [44]  By A. BOETTE    The first object of the builder of a sled should be to have a  \"winner\" both in speed and appearance. The accompanying  instructions for building a sled are designed to produce these  results.    The sled completed should be 15 ft. 2 in. long by 22 in. wide,  with the cushion about 15 in. above the ground. For the baseboard  select a pine board 15 ft. long, 11 in. wide and 2 in. thick, and  plane it on all edges. Fit up the baseboard with ten oak  foot-rests 22 in. long, 3 in. wide and 3/4 in. thick. Fasten them  on the under side of the baseboard at right angles to its length  and 16 in. apart, beginning at the rear. At the front 24 or 26 in.  will be left without cross bars for fitting on the auto front. On  the upper side of the cross bars at their ends on each side screw  a piece of oak 1 in. square by 14 ft. long. On the upper side of  the baseboard at its edge on each side screw an oak strip 3 in.  wide by 3/4 in. thick and the length of the sled from the back to  the auto front. These are to keep the cushion from falling out.  See Fig. 1. For the back of the sled use the upper part of a  child's high chair, taking out the spindles and resetting them in  the rear end of the baseboard. Cover up the outside of the  spindles with a piece of galvanized iron.    The construction of the runners is shown by Figs. 2 and 3. The  stock required for them is oak, two pieces 30 in. by 5 in. by  1-1/4 in., two pieces 34 in. by 5 in. by 1-1/4 in., two pieces 14  in. by 6 in. by 2 in., and four pieces 14 in. by 2 in. by 1 in.  They should be put together with large screws about 3 in. long.  Use no nails, as they are not substantial enough. In proportioning  them the points A, B and C, Fig. 2, are important. For the front  runners these measurements are: A, 30 in.; B, 4 in.; C, 15-1/2  in., and for the rear runners: A, 34 in.; B, 7 in. ; C, 16-1/2 in.  The screw eyes indicated must be placed in a straight line and the  holes for them carefully centered. A variation of 1/16 in. one way  or another would cause a great deal of trouble. For the steel  runners use 3/8 in. cold-rolled steel flattened at the ends for  screw holes. Use no screws on the running surface, however, as  they \"snatch\" the ice.    The mechanism of the front steering gear is shown at Fig. 3. A  3/4-in. steel rod makes a good steering rod. Flatten the steering  rod at one end and sink it into the wood. Hold it in place by  means of an iron plate drilled to receive the rod and screwed to  block X. An iron washer, Z, is used to reduce friction; bevel  block K to give a rocker motion. Equip block X with screw eyes,  making them clear those in the front runner, and bolt through. For  the rear runner put a block with screw eyes on the baseboard and  run a bolt through.    Construct the auto front (Fig. 4) of  3/4-in. oak boards. The  illustration shows how to shape it. Bevel it toward all sides and  keep the edges sharp, as sharp edges are best suited for the brass  trimmings which are to be added. When the auto front is in place  enamel the sled either a dark maroon or a creamy white. First  sandpaper all the wood, then apply a coat of thin enamel. Let  stand for three days and apply another coat. Three coats of enamel  and one of thin varnish will make a fine-looking sled. For the  brass trimmings use No. 27 B. & S. sheet brass 1 in. wide on all  the front edges and pieces 3 in. square on the cross bars to rest  the feet against. On the door of the auto front put the monogram  of the owner or owners of the sled, cutting it out of sheet brass.    For the steering-wheel procure an old freight-car \"brake\" wheel,  brass plated. Fasten a horn, such as used on automobiles, to the  wheel.    Make the cushion of leather and stuff it with hair. The best way  is to get some strong, cheap material, such as burlap, sew up one  end and make in    [Illustration: Construction a \"Winner\" Toboggan Sled]    the form of an oblong bag. Stuff this as tightly as possible with  hair. Then get some upholstery buttons, fasten a cord through the  loop, bring the cord through to the underside of the cushion, and  fasten the button by slipping a nail through the knot. Then put a  leather covering over the burlap, sewing it to the burlap on the  under side. Make the cushion for the back in the same way. On top  of the cushion supports run a brass tube to serve the double  purpose of holding the cushion down and affording something to  hold on to.    If desired, bicycle lamps may be fastened to the front end, to  improve the appearance, and it is well to have a light of some  kind at the back to avoid the danger of rear-end collisions.    The door of the auto front should be hinged and provided with a  lock so that skates, parcels, overshoes, lunch, etc. may be stowed  within. A silk pennant with a monogram adds to the appearance.    If desired, a brake may be added to the sled. This can be a  wrought-iron lever 1-1/2 in. by 1/2 in. by 30 in. long, so pivoted  that moving the handle will cause the end to scrape the ice. This  sled can be made without lamps and horn at a cost of about $15, or  with these for $25, and the pleasure derived from it well repays  the builder. If the expense is greater than one can afford, a  number of boys may share in the ownership.        ** Burning Inscriptions on Trees    Scrape off the bark just enough to come to the first light under  coating, which is somewhat moist. With a lead pencil make an  outline of the inscription to be burnt on the tree and bring, the  rays of a large magnifying glass not quite to a fine focus on the  same. The tree will be burnt along the pencil marks, and if the  glass is not held in one spot too long, the inscription will be  burnt in as evenly as if it had been written.  --Contributed by Stewart H. Leland, Lexington, Ill.        ** How to Make Small Gearwheels Without a Lathe [46]    To make small models sundry small gears and racks are required,  either cut for the place or by using the parts from an old clock.  With no other tools than a hacksaw, some files, a compass,    [Illustration: Making Model Wheels]    and with the exercise of a little patience and moderate skill,  very good teeth may be cut on blank wheels.    First take the case of a small gearwheel, say 1 in. outside  diameter and 1/16 in. thick, with twenty-four teeth. Draw a circle  on paper, the same diameter as the wheel. Divide the circumference  into the number of parts desired, by drawing diameters, Fig. 1.  The distance AB will be approximately the pitch. Now describe a  smaller circle for the base of the teeth and halfway between these  circles may be taken as the pitch circle.    Now describe a circle the same size as the largest circle on a  piece of 1/16-in. sheet metal, and having cut it out and filed it  up to this circle, fasten the marked-out paper circle accurately  over it with glue. Saw-cuts can now be made down the diameters to  the smaller circle with the aid of a saw guide, Fig. 2, made from  1/16-in. mild steel or iron. This guide should have a beveled  edge, E, from F to G, to lay along the line on which the saw-cut  is to be made. The straight-edge, CD, should be set back one-half  the thickness of the saw-blades, so that the center of the blade,  when flat against it, will be over the line FG. A small clearance  space, FC, must be made to allow the teeth of the saw to pass.    The guide should then be placed along one of the diameters and  held in position until gripped in the vise, Fig. 3. The first  tooth may now be cut, care being taken to keep the blade of the  saw flat up to the guiding edge. The Model Engineer, London, says  if this is done and the saw-guide well made, the cut will be  central on the line, and if the marking-out is correct the teeth  will be quite uniform all the way round. A small ward file will be  needed to finish off the teeth to their proper shape and  thickness.    In making a worm wheel the cuts must be taken in a sloping  direction, the slope and pitch depending on the slope and pitch of  the worm thread, which, though more difficult, may also be cut  with a hacksaw and file.    A bevel wheel should be cut in the same manner as the spur wheel,  but the cut should be deeper on the side which has the larger  diameter. To cut a rack the pitch should be marked along the side,  and the guide and saw used as before (Fig. 4).        ** How to Make Four Pictures on One Plate [46]    Secure two extra slides for the plate holders and cut one corner  out on one    [Illustration: Four Photos on One Plate]    of them, as shown in Fig. 1. Make a hole in the other, as shown in  Fig. 2. With a lead pencil draw on the ground glass one line  vertical and one horizontal, each in the center. This will divide  the ground glass into four equal parts.    Focus the camera in the usual manner, but get the picture desired  to fill only one of the parts on the ground glass. Place the  plate-holder in position and draw the regular slide; substitute  one of the slides prepared and expose in the usual way.    If a small picture is to be made in the lower left-hand corner of  the plate, place the prepared slide with the corner cut, as shown  in Fig. 1. The slide may be turned over for the upper left hand  corner and then changed for slide shown in Fig. 2 for the upper  and lower right-hand corners.        ** Electric Blue-Light Experiment  [47] "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/12661"],[0,"Canada under British Rule 1760-1900 (#13)"],[1," I.--The successful Revolution of the Thirteen Colonies in  America.    When Canada was formally ceded to Great Britain the Thirteen Colonies  were relieved from the menace of the presence of France in the valleys  of the St. Lawrence, the Ohio, and the Mississippi. Nowhere were there  more rejoicings on account of this auspicious event than in the homes of  the democratic Puritans. The names of Pitt and Wolfe were honoured above  all others of their countrymen, and no one in England, certainly not  among its statesmen, imagined that in the colonies, which stretched from  the river Penobscot to the peninsula of Florida, there was latent a  spirit of independence which might at any moment threaten the rule of  Great Britain on the American continent. The great expenses of the Seven  Years' War were now pressing heavily on the British taxpayer. British  statesmen were forced to consider how best they could make the colonies  themselves contribute towards their own protection in the future, and  relieve Great Britain in some measure from the serious burden which  their defence had heretofore imposed on her. In those days colonies were  considered as so many possessions to be used for the commercial  advantage of the parent state. Their commerce and industries had been  fettered for many years by acts of parliament which were intended to  give Great Britain a monopoly of their trade and at the same time  prevent them from manufacturing any article that they could buy from the  British factories. As a matter of fact, however, these restrictive  measures of imperial protection had been for a long time practically  dead-letters. The merchants and seamen of New England carried on  smuggling with the French and Spanish Indies with impunity, and  practically traded where they pleased.    The stamp act was only evidence of a vigorous colonial policy, which was  to make the people of the colonies contribute directly to their own  defence and security, and at the same time enforce the navigation laws  and acts of trade and put an end to the general system of smuggling by  which men, some of the best known merchants of Boston, had acquired a  fortune. George Grenville, who was responsible for the rigid enforcement  of the navigation laws and the stamp act, had none of that worldly  wisdom which Sir Robert Walpole showed when, years before, it was  proposed to him to tax the colonies. \"No,\" said that astute politician,  \"I have old England set against me already, and do you think I will have  New England likewise?\" But Grenville and his successors, in attempting  to carry out a new colonial policy, entirely misunderstood the  conditions and feelings of the colonial communities affected and raised  a storm of indignation which eventually led to independence. The stamp  act was in itself an equitable measure, the proceeds of which were to be  exclusively used for the benefit of the colonies themselves; but its  enactment was most unfortunate at a time when the influential classes in  New England were deeply irritated at the enforcement of a policy which  was to stop the illicit trade from which they had so largely profited in  the past. The popular indignation, however, vented itself against the  stamp act, which imposed internal taxation, was declared to be in direct  violation of the principles of political liberty and self-government  long enjoyed by the colonists as British subjects, and was repealed as a  result of the violent opposition it met in the colonies. Parliament  contented itself with a statutory declaration of its supremacy in all  matters over every part of the empire; but not long afterwards the  determination of some English statesmen to bring the colonies as far as  practicable directly under the dominion of British law in all matters of  commerce and taxation, and to control their government as far as  possible, found full expression in the Townshend acts of 1767 which  imposed port duties on a few commodities, including tea, imported into  those countries. At the same time provision was made for the due  execution of existing laws relating to trade. The province of New York  was punished for openly refusing to obey an act of parliament which  required the authorities to furnish the British troops with the  necessaries of life. Writs of assistance, which allowed officials to  search everywhere for smuggled goods, were duly legalised. These writs  were the logical sequence of a rigid enforcement of the laws of trade  and navigation, and had been vehemently denounced by James Otis, so far  back as 1761, as not only irreconcilable with the colonial charters, but  as inconsistent with those natural rights which a people \"derived from  nature and the Author of nature\"--an assertion which obtained great  prominence for the speaker. This bold expression of opinion in  Massachusetts should be studied by the historian of those times in  connection with the equally emphatic revolutionary argument advanced by  Patrick Henry of Virginia, two years later, against the ecclesiastical  supremacy of the Anglican clergy and the right of the king to veto  legislation of the colony. Though the prerogative of the crown was thus  directly called into question in a Virginia court, the British  government did not take a determined stand on the undoubted rights of  the crown in the case. English statesmen and lawyers probably regarded  such arguments, if they paid any attention to them at all in days when  they neglected colonial opinion, as only temporary ebullitions of local  feeling, though in reality they were so many evidences of the opposition  that was sure to show itself whenever there was a direct interference  with the privileges and rights of self-governing communities. Both Henry  and Otis touched a key-note of the revolution, which was stimulated by  the revenue and stamp acts and later measures affecting the colonies.    It is somewhat remarkable that it was in aristocratic Virginia, founded  by Cavaliers, as well as in democratic Massachusetts, founded by  Puritans, that the revolutionary element gained its principal strength  during the controversy with the parent state. The makers of  Massachusetts were independents in church government and democrats in  political principle. The whole history of New England, in fact, from the  first charters until the argument on the writs of assistance, is full of  incidents which show the growth of republican ideas. The Anglican church  had no strength in the northern colonies, and the great majority of  their people were bitterly opposed to the pretensions of the English  hierarchy to establish an episcopate in America. It is not therefore  surprising that Massachusetts should have been the leader in the  revolutionary agitation; on the other hand in Virginia the Anglican  clergy belonged to what was essentially an established church, and the  whole social fabric of the colony rested on an aristocratic basis. No  doubt before the outbreak of the revolution there was a decided feeling  against England on account of the restrictions on the sale of tobacco;  and the quarrel, which I have just referred to, with respect to the  stipends of the clergy, which were to be paid in this staple commodity  according to its market value at the time of payment, had spread  discontent among a large body of the people. But above all such causes  of dissatisfaction was the growing belief that the political freedom of  the people, and the very existence of the colony as a self-governing  community, were jeopardised by the indiscreet acts of the imperial  authorities after 1763. It is easy then to understand that the action of  the British government in 1767 renewed the agitation, which had been  allayed for the moment by the repeal of the stamp act and the general  belief that there would be no rigid enforcement of old regulations which  meant the ruin of the most profitable trade of New England. The measures  of the ministry were violently assailed in parliament by Burke and  other eminent men who availed themselves of so excellent an opportunity  of exciting the public mind against a government which was doing so much  to irritate the colonies and injure British trade. All the political  conditions were unfavourable to a satisfactory adjustment of the  colonial difficulty. Chatham had been one of the earnest opponents of  the stamp act, but he was now buried in retirement--labouring under some  mental trouble--and Charles Townshend, the chancellor of the exchequer  in the cabinet of which Chatham was the real head, was responsible for  measures which his chief would have repudiated as most impolitic and  inexpedient in the existing temper of the colonies.    The action of the ministry was for years at once weak and irritating.  One day they asserted the supremacy of the British parliament, and on  the next yielded to the violent opposition of the colonies and the  appeals of British merchants whose interests were at stake. Nothing  remained eventually but the tea duty, and even that was so arranged that  the colonists could buy their tea at a much cheaper rate than the  British consumer. But by this time a strong anti-British party was in  course of formation throughout the colonies. Samuel Adams of  Massachusetts, Patrick Henry of Virginia, and a few other political  managers of consummate ability, had learned their own power, and the  weakness of English ministers. Samuel Adams, who had no love in his  heart for England, was undoubtedly by this time insidiously working  towards the independence of the colonies. Violence and outrage formed  part of his secret policy. The tea in Boston harbour was destroyed by a  mob disguised as Mohawk Indians, and was nowhere allowed to enter into  domestic consumption. The patience of English ministers was now  exhausted, and they determined to enter on a vigorous system of  repression, which might have had some effect at an earlier stage of the"]]]
