The last command I heard  our Captain give was:\"    \"'Boys, when you hear my whistle, lie flat down on the ground.'\"    \"Whether he ever whistled or not I do not know. The next move we made  was when, with a terrific yell, we charged up to the Spanish trenches  and bayoneted and clubbed them out of their places in a jiffy. Some of  the men of our regiment say that the last command they heard was: 'To  the rear!' But this command they utterly disregarded and charged to  the front until the day was won, and the Spaniards, those not dead in  the trenches, fled back to the city.\"    [Illustration: CUBANS FIGHTING FROM TREE TOPS.]    But a colored man, Wm. H. Brown, a member of the Tenth Cavalry, said:    \"A foreign officer, standing near our position when we started out to  make that charge, was heard to say; 'Men, for heaven's sake, don't  go up that hill! It will be impossible for human beings to take that  position! You can't stand the fire!' Notwithstanding this, with a  terrific yell we rushed up the enemy's works, and you know the result.  Men who saw him say that when this officer saw us make the charge he  turned his back upon us and wept.\"    \"And the odd thing about it all is that these wounded heroes never  will admit that they did anything out of the common. They will  talk all right about those 'other fellows,' but they don't about  themselves, and were immensely surprised when such a fuss was made  over them on their arrival and since. They simply believed they had a  duty to perform and performed it.\"--Planet.           *       *       *       *       *    OUR COLORED SOLDIERS.    A FEW OF THE INTERESTING COMMENTS ON THE DEEDS PERFORMED BY THE BRAVE  BOYS OF THE REGULAR ARMY--SAVED THE LIFE OF HIS LIEUTENANT BUT LOST  HIS OWN.      \"The Ninth and Tenth Cavalry are composed of the bravest lot of  soldiers I ever saw. They held the ground that Roosevelt retreated  from and saved them from annihilation.\"      To a Massachusetts soldier in another group of interviewers, the same  question was put: \"How about the colored soldiers?\"    \"They fought like demons,\" came the answer.    \"Before El Caney was taken the Spaniards were on the heights of San  Juan with heavy guns. All along our line an assault was made and the  enemy was holding us off with terrible effect. From their blockhouse  on the hill came a magazine of shot. Shrapnell shells fell in our  ranks, doing great damage. Something had to be done or the day would  have been lost. The Ninth and part of the Tenth Cavalry moved across  into a thicket near by. The Spaniards rained shot upon them. They  collected and like a flash swept across the plains and charged up the  hill. The enemy's guns were used with deadly effect. On and on they  went, charging with the fury of madness. The blockhouse was captured,  the enemy fled and we went into El Caney.\"    In another group a trooper from an Illinois regiment was explaining  the character of the country and the effect of the daily rains upon  the troops. Said he:    \"Very few colored troops are sick. They stood the climate better and  even thrived on the severity of army life.\"    Said he: \"I never had much use for a 'nigger' and didn't want him  in the fight. He is all right, though. He makes a good soldier and  deserves great credit.\"    Another comrade near by related the story as told by a cavalry  lieutenant, who with a party reconnoitered a distance from camp. The  thick growth of grass and vines made ambuscading a favorite pastime  with the Spaniards. With smokeless powder they lay concealed in the  grass. As the party rode along the sharp eye of a colored cavalryman  noticed the movement of grass ahead. Leaning over his horse with sword  in hand he plucked up an enemy whose gun was levelled at the officer.  The Spaniard was killed by the Negro who himself fell dead, shot by  another. He had saved the life of his lieutenant and lost his own.    A comrade of the Seventeenth Infantry gave his testimony. Said he:    \"I shall never forget the 1st of July. At one time in the engagement  of that day the Twenty-first Infantry had faced a superior force of  Spaniards and were almost completely surrounded. The Twenty-fourth  Infantry, of colored troops, seeing the perilous position of the  Twenty-first, rushed to the rescue, charged and routed the enemy,  thereby saving the ill-fated regiment.\"    Col. Joseph Haskett, of the Seventeenth regular Infantry, testifies to  the meritorious conduct of the Negro troops. Said he:    \"Our colored soldiers are 100 percent superior to the Cuban. He is a  good scout, brave soldier, and not only that, but is everywhere to be  seen building roads for the movement of heavy guns.\"    Among the trophies of war brought to Old Point were a machete, the  captured property of a colored trooper, a fine Spanish sword, taken  from an officer and a little Cuban lad about nine years old, whose  parents had bled for Cuba. His language and appearance made him the  cynosure of all eyes. He was dressed in a little United States uniform  and had pinned to his clothing a tag which read: \"Santiago buck, care  of Col. C.L. Wilson, Manhattan Club, New York.\" His name is Vairrames  y Pillero.    He seemed to enjoy the shower of small coin that fell upon him from  the hotels. His first and only English words were \"Moocha Moona.\"    These fragments were gathered while visiting at Old Point Comfort  recently. They serve to show the true feeling of the whites for their  brave black brother.    A.E. MEYZEEK, in the Freeman.    Louisville, Ky.    BLACK SOLDIER BOYS.    The following is what the New York Mail and Express says respecting  the good services being rendered by our black soldier boys:    \"All honors to the black troopers of the gallant Tenth! No more  striking example of bravery and coolness has been shown since the  destruction of the Maine than by the colored veterans of the Tenth  Cavalry during the attack upon Caney on Saturday. By the side of the  intrepid Rough Riders they followed their leader up the terrible hill  from whose crest the desperate Spaniards poured down a deadly fire of  shell and musketry. They never faltered. The tents in their ranks  were filled as soon as made. Firing as they marched, their aim was  splendid, their coolness was superb, and their courage aroused the  admiration of their comrades. Their advance was greeted with wild  cheers from the white regiment's, and with an answering shout they  pressed onward over the trenches they had taken close in the pursuit  of the retreating enemy. The war has not shown greater heroism. The  men whose own freedom was baptized with blood have proved themselves  capable of giving up their lives that others may be free. To-day is a  glorious Fourth for all races 'of people in this great land.\"           *       *       *       *       *    THEY NEVER FALTERED.    The test of the Negro soldier has been applied and today the whole  world stands amazed at the valor and distinctive bravery shown by the  men, who, in the face of a most galling fire, rushed onward while  shot and shell tore fearful gaps in their ranks. These men, the Tenth  Cavalry, did not stop to ask was it worth while for them to lay down  their lives for the honor of a country that has silently allowed her  citizens to be killed and maltreated in almost every conceivable way;  they did not stop to ask would their death bring deliverance to their  race from mob violence and lynching. They saw their duty and did it!  The New York Journal catches inspiration from the wonderful courage of  the Tenth Cavalry and writes these words:    \"The two most picturesque and most characteristically American  commands in General Shafter's army bore off the great honors of a day  in which all won honor.\"    \"No man can read the story in to-day's Journal of the 'Rough Riders'  charge on the blockhouse at El Caney of Theodore Roosevelt's mad  daring in the face of what seemed certain death without having his  pulses beat faster and some reflected light of the fire of battle  gleam from his eyes.\"    \"And over against this scene of the cowboy and the college graduate,  the New York man about town and the Arizona bad man united in one  coherent war machine, set the picture of the Tenth United States  Cavalry-the famous colored regiment. Side by side with Roosevelt's men  they fought-these black men. Scarce used to freedom themselves, they  are dying that Cuba may be free. Their marksmanship was magnificent,  say the eye witnesses. Their courage was superb. They bore themselves  like veterans, and gave proof positive that out of nature's naturally  peaceful, careless and playful military discipline and an inspiring  cause can make soldiers worthy to rank with Caesar's legions or  Cromwell's army.\"    \"The Rough Riders and the Black Regiment. In those two commands is an  epitome of almost our whole national character.\"    THE NEGRO AS A SOLDIER.    HIS GOOD NATURE--HIS KINDHEARTEDNESS--EQUALLY AVAILABLE IN INFANTRY OR  CAVALRY.    The good nature of the Negro soldier is remarkable. He is always fond  of a joke and never too tired to enjoy one. Officers have wondered to  see a whole company of them, at the close of a long practice march,  made with heavy baggage, chasing a rabbit which some one may have  started. They will run for several hundred yards whooping and yelling  and laughing, and come back to camp feeling as if they had had lots of  fun, the white soldier, even if not tired, would never see any joke in  rushing after a rabbit. To the colored man the diversion is a delight.    In caring for the sick, the Negro's tenderheartedness is conspicuous.  On one of the transports "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/11114"],[0,"Debate on Woman Suffrage in the Senate of the United States, (#13)"],[1," only in  respect to the right of suffrage, but in every other respect the peer  and equal of her brother, man.           *       *       *       *       *    Mr. VEST. Mr. President, any measure of legislation which affects  popular government based on the will of the people as expressed  through their suffrage is not only important but vitally so. If this  Government, which is based on the intelligence of the people, shall  ever be destroyed it will be by injudicious, immature, or corrupt  suffrage. If the ship of state launched by our fathers shall ever be  destroyed, it will be by striking the rock of universal, unprepared  suffrage. Suffrage once given can never be taken away. Legislatures  and conventions may do everything else; they never can do that. When  any particular class or portion of the community is once invested with  this privilege it is used, accomplished, and eternal.    The Senator who last spoke on this question refers to the successful  experiment in regard to woman-suffrage in the Territories of Wyoming  and Washington. Mr. President, it is not upon the plains of the  sparsely-settled Territories of the West that woman suffrage can be  tested. Suffrage in the rural districts and sparsely settled regions  of this country must from the very nature of things remain pure when  corrupt everywhere else. The danger of corrupt suffrage is in the  cities, and those masses of population to which civilization tends  everywhere in all history. Whilst the country has been pure and  patriotic, the cities have been the first cancers to appear upon the  body-politic in all ages of the world.    Wyoming Territory! Washington Territory! Where are their large cities?  Where are the localities in these Territories where the strain upon  popular government must come? The Senator from New Hampshire, who is  so conspicuous in this movement, appalled the country some months  since by his ghastly array of illiteracy in the Southern States. He  proposes that $77,000,000 of the people's money be taken in order to  strike down the great foe to republican government, illiteracy. How  was that illiteracy brought upon this country? It was by giving the  suffrage to unprepared voters. It is not my purpose to go back into  the past and make any partisan or sectional appeal, but it is a fact  known to every intelligent man that in one single act the right of  suffrage was given without preparation to hundreds of thousands of  voters who to-day can scarcely read. That Senator proposes now to  double, and more than double, that illiteracy. He proposes to give the  negro women of the South this right of suffrage, utterly unprepared as  they are for it.    In a convention some two years and a half ago in the city of  Louisville an intelligent negro from the South said the negro men  could not vote the Democratic ticket because the women would not live  with them if they did. The negro men go out in the hotels and upon the  railroad cars. They go to the cities and by attrition they wear  away the prejudice of race; but the women remain at home, and their  emotional natures aggregate and compound the race-prejudice, and when  suffrage is given them what must be the result?    Mr. President, it is not my purpose to speak of the inconveniences,  for they are nothing more, of woman suffrage. I trust that as a  gentleman I respect the feelings of the ladies and their advocates. I  am not here to ridicule. My purpose only is to use legitimate argument  as to a movement which commands respectful consideration, if for no  other reason than because it comes from women. But it is impossible  to divest ourselves of a certain degree of sentiment when considering  this question.    I pity the man who can consider any question affecting the influence  of woman with the cold, dry logic of business. What man can, without  aversion, turn from the blessed memory of that dear old grandmother,  or the gentle words and caressing hand of that blessed mother gone to  the unknown world, to face in its stead the idea of a female justice  of the peace or township constable? For my part I want when I go to my  home--when I turn from the arena where man contends with man for what  we call the prizes of this paltry world--I want to go back, not to be  received in the masculine embrace of some female ward politician, but  to the earnest, loving look and touch of a true woman. I want to go  back to the jurisdiction of the wife, the mother; and instead of a  lecture upon finance or the tariff, or upon the construction of the  Constitution, I want those blessed, loving details of domestic life  and domestic love.    I have said I would not speak of the inconveniences to arise from  woman suffrage--I care not--whether the mother is called upon to  decide as a juryman or jury-woman rights of property or rights of  life, whilst her baby is \"mewling and puking\" in solitary confinement  at home. There are other considerations more important, and one of  them to my mind is insuperable. I speak now respecting women as a sex.  I believe that they are better than men, but I do not believe they are  adapted to the political work of this world. I do not believe that the  Great Intelligence ever intended them to invade the sphere of work  given to men, tearing down and destroying all the best influences for  which God has intended them.    The great evil in this country to-day is in emotional suffrage. The  great danger to-day is in excitable suffrage. If the voters of this  country could think always coolly, and if they could deliberate, if  they could go by judgment and not by passion, our institutions would  survive forever, eternal as the foundations of the continent itself;  but massed together, subject to the excitements of mobs and of these  terrible political contests that come upon us from year to year under  the autonomy of our Government, what would be the result if suffrage  were given to the women of the United States?    Women are essentially emotional. It is no disparagement to them they  are so. It is no more insulting to say that women are emotional than  to say that they are delicately constructed physically and unfitted to  become soldiers or workmen under the sterner, harder pursuits of life.    What we want in this country is to avoid emotional suffrage, and what  we need is to put more logic into public affairs and less feeling.  There are spheres in which feeling should be paramount. There are  kingdoms in which the heart should reign supreme. That kingdom belongs  to woman. The realm of sentiment, the realm of love, the realm of the  gentler and the holier and kindlier attributes that make the name of  wife, mother, and sister next to that of God himself.    I would not, and I say it deliberately, degrade woman by giving her  the right of suffrage. I mean the word in its full signification,  because I believe that woman as she is to-day, the queen of home and  of hearts, is above the political collisions of this world, and should  always be kept above them.    Sir, if it be said to us that this is a natural right belonging to  women, I deny it. The right of suffrage is one to be determined by  expediency and by policy, and given by the State to whom it pleases.  It is not a natural right; it is a right that comes from the state.    It is claimed that if the suffrage be given to women it is to protect  them. Protect them from whom? The brute that would invade their rights  would coerce the suffrage of his wife, or sister, or mother as he  would wring from her the hard earnings of her toil to gratify his own  beastly appetites and passions.    It is said that the suffrage is to be given to enlarge the sphere of  woman's influence. Mr. President, it would destroy her influence.  It would take her down from that pedestal where she is to-day,  influencing as a mother the minds of her offspring, influencing by her  gentle and kindly caress the action of her husband toward the good and  pure.    But I rise not to discuss this question, but to discharge a request.  I know that when a man attacks this claim for woman suffrage he is  sneered at and ridiculed as afraid to meet women in the contests for  political honor and supremacy. If so, I oppose to the request of these  ladies the arguments of their own sex; but first, I ask the Secretary  to read a paper which has been sent to me with a request that I place  it before the Senate.    The Chief Clerk read as follows:    _To the honorable Senate and House of Representatives_:    We, the undersigned, respectfully remonstrate against the further  extension of suffrage to women.
