The rest of us who saw this Whistling Dan in action  aren't a bit inclined to wonder. Suppose you were to meet a black  panther down here in the willows?\"    \"I wouldn't give a damn if I had my Winchester with me.\"    \"All right, Terry, but suppose the panther,\" broke in Hal Purvis,  \"could sling shootin' irons as well as you could--maybe _that'd_ make  you partic'ler pleased.\"    \"It ain't possible,\" said Terry.    \"Sure it ain't,\" grinned Purvis amiably, \"an' this Barry ain't  possible, either. Where you going, Lee?\"    Haines turned from his task of saddling his mount.    \"Private matter. Kilduff, you take my place while I'm gone. I may be  back tomorrow night. The chief isn't apt to return so soon.\"    A few moments later Haines galloped out of the willows and headed  across the hills towards old Joe Cumberland's ranch. He was  remembering his promise to Kate, to keep Dan out of danger. He had  failed from that promise once, but that did not mean that he had  forgotten. He looked up to the yellow-bright mountain stars, and they  were like the eyes of good women smiling down upon him. He guessed  that she loved Barry and if he could bring her to Whistling Dan she  might have strength enough to take the latter from Silent's trail. The  lone rider knew well enough that to bring Dan and Kate together was  to surrender his own shadowy hopes, but the golden eyes of the sky  encouraged him. So he followed his impulse.    Haines could never walk that middle path which turns neither to the  right nor the left, neither up nor down. He went through life with  a free-swinging stride, and as the result of it he had crossed the  rights of others. He might have lived a lawful life, for all his  instincts were gentle. But an accident placed him in the shadow of the  law. He waited for his legal trial, but when it came and false witness  placed him behind the bars, the revolt came. Two days after his  confinement, he broke away from his prison and went to the wilds.  There he found Jim Silent, and the mountain-desert found another to  add to its list of great outlaws.    Morning came as he drew close to the house, and now his reminiscences  were cut short, for at a turn of the road he came upon Kate galloping  swiftly over the hills. He drew his horse to a halt and raised his  hand. She followed suit. They sat staring. If she had remembered his  broken promise and started to reproach, he could have found answer,  but her eyes were big with sorrow alone. He put out his hand without a  word. She hesitated over it, her eyes questioning him mutely, and then  with the ghost of a smile she touched his fingers.    \"I want to explain,\" he said huskily.    \"What?\"    \"You remember I gave you my word that no harm would come to Barry?\"    \"No man could have helped him.\"    \"You don't hold it against me?\"    A gust of wind moaned around them. She waved her arm towards the  surrounding hills and her laugh blended with the sound of the wind,  it was so faint. He watched her with a curious pang. She seemed among  women what that morning was to the coming day--fresh, cool, aloof. It  was hard to speak the words which would banish the sorrow from her  eyes and make them brilliant with hope and shut him away from her  thoughts with a barrier higher than mountains, and broader than seas.    \"I have brought you news,\" he said at last, reluctantly.    She did not change.    \"About Dan Barry.\"    Ay, she changed swiftly enough at that! He could not meet the fear and  question of her glance. He looked away and saw the red rim of the sun  pushing up above the hills. And colour poured up the throat of Kate  Cumberland, up even to her forehead beneath the blowing golden hair.    Haines jerked his sombrero lower on his head. A curse tumbled up to  his lips and he had to set his teeth to keep it back.    \"But I have heard his whistle.\"    Her lips moved but made no sound.    \"Five other men heard him.\"    She cried out as if he had hurt her, but the hurt was happiness. He  knew it and winced, for she was wonderfully beautiful.    \"In the willows of the river bottom, a good twenty miles south,\" he  said at last, \"and I will show you the way, if you wish.\"    He watched her eyes grow large with doubt.    \"Can you trust me?\" he asked. \"I failed you once. Can you trust me  now?\"    Her hand went out to him.    \"With all my heart,\" she said. \"Let us start!\"    \"I've given my horse a hard ride. He must have some rest.\"    She moaned softly in her impatience, and then: \"We'll go back to the  house and you can stable your horse there until you're ready to start.  Dad will go with us.\"    \"Your father cannot go,\" he said shortly.    \"Cannot?\"    \"Let's start back for the ranch,\" he said, \"and I'll tell you  something about it as we go.\"    As they turned their horses he went on: \"In order that you may reach  Whistling Dan, you'll have to meet first a number of men who are  camping down there in the willows.\"    He stopped. It became desperately difficult for him to go on.    \"I am one of those men,\" he said, \"and another of them is the one whom  Whistling Dan is following.\"    She caught her breath and turned abruptly on him.    \"What are you, Mr. Lee?\"    Very slowly he forced his eyes up to meet her gaze.    \"In that camp,\" he answered indirectly, \"your father wouldn't be  safe!\"    It was out at last!    \"Then you are--\"    \"Your friend.\"    \"Forgive me. You _are_ my friend!\"    \"The man whom Dan is following,\" he went on, \"is the leader. If he  gives the command four practised fighters pit themselves against  Barry.\"    \"It is murder!\"    \"You can prevent it,\" he said. \"They know Barry is on the trail, but I  think they will do nothing unless he forces them into trouble. And he  will force them unless you stop him. No other human being could take  him off that trail.\"    \"I know! I know!\" she muttered. \"But I have already tried, and he will  not listen to me!\"    \"But he will listen to you,\" insisted Haines, \"when you tell him that  he will be fighting not one man, but six.\"    \"And if he doesn't listen to me?\"    Haines shrugged his shoulders.    \"Can't you promise that these men will not fight with him?\"    \"I cannot.\"    \"But I shall plead with them myself.\"    He turned to her in alarm.    \"No, you must not let them dream you know who they are,\" he warned,  \"for otherwise--\"    Again that significant shrug of the shoulders.    He explained: \"These men are in such danger that they dare not take  chances. You are a woman, but if they feel that you suspect them you  will no longer be a woman in their eyes.\"    \"Then what must I do?\"    \"I shall ride ahead of you when we come to the willows, after I have  pointed out the position of our camp. About an hour after I have  arrived, for they must not know that I have brought you, you will ride  down towards the camp. When you come to it I will make sure that it  is I who will bring you in. You must pretend that you have simply  blundered upon our fire. Whatever you do, never ask a question while  you are there--and I'll be your warrant that you will come off safely.  Will you try?\"    He attempted no further persuasion and contented himself with merely  meeting the wistful challenge of her eyes.    \"I will,\" she said at last, and then turning her glance away she  repeated softly, \"I will.\"    He knew that she was already rehearsing what she must say to Whistling  Dan.    \"You are not afraid?\"    She smiled.    \"Do you really trust me as far as this?\"    With level-eyed tenderness that took his breath, she answered: \"An  absolute trust, Mr. Lee.\"    \"My name,\" he said in a strange voice, \"is Lee Haines.\"    Of one accord they stopped their horses and their hands met.          CHAPTER XI      SILENT BLUFFS    The coming of the railroad had changed Elkhead from a mere crossing of  the ways to a rather important cattle shipping point. Once a year it  became a bustling town whose two streets thronged with cattlemen with  pockets burdened with gold which fairly burned its way out to the open  air. At other times Elkhead dropped back into a leaden-eyed sleep.    The most important citizen was Lee Hardy, the Wells Fargo agent.  Office jobs are hard to find in the mountain-desert, and those who  hold them win respect. The owner of a swivel-chair is more lordly  than the possessor of five thousand \"doggies.\" Lee Hardy had such  a swivel-chair. Moreover, since large shipments of cash were often  directed by Wells Fargo to Elkhead, Hardy's position was really more  significant than the size of the village suggested. As a crowning  stamp upon his dignity he had a clerk who handled the ordinary routine  of work in the front room, while Hardy set himself up in state in  a little rear office whose walls were decorated by two brilliant  calendars and the coloured photograph of a blond beauty advertising a  toilet soap.    To this sanctuary he retreated during the heat of the day, while in  the morning and evening he loitered on the small porch, chatting with  passers-by. Except in the hottest part of the year he affected a soft  white collar with a permanent bow tie. The leanness of his features,  and his crooked neck with the prominent Adam's apple which stirred  when he spoke, suggested a Yankee ancestry, but the faded blue eyes,  pathetically misted, could only be found in the mountain-desert.    One morning into the inner sanctum of this dignitary stepped a man  built in rectangles, a square face, square, ponderous shoulders, and  even square-tipped fingers. Into the smiling haze of Hardy's face his  own keen black eye sparkled like an electric lantern flashed into a  dark room. He was dressed in the cowboy's costume, but there was no  Western languor in his make-up. Everything about him was clear cut  and precise. He had a habit of clicking his teeth as he finished a  sentence. In a word, when he appeared in the"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/10890"],[0,"Dio's Rome, Volume 5 (#13)"],[1," as to believe that  he could live for a moment as a private citizen and would be able to  appear as a musician.    He was on the point of putting those measures into effect when the senate  first withdrew the guard that surrounded Nero, then entered the camp, and  declared Nero an enemy but chose Galba in his place as emperor.    But when he perceived that he had been deserted also by his body-guards  (he happened to be asleep in some garden), he undertook to make his  escape. Accordingly, he assumed shabby clothing and mounted a horse no  better than his attire. Closely veiled he rode while it was yet night  towards an estate of Phao, a Caesarian, in company with the owner of the  place, and Epaphroditus and Sporus. [Sidenote:--28--] While he was on the  way an extraordinary earthquake occurred, so that one might have thought  the whole world was breaking apart and all the spirits of those murdered  by him were leaping up to assail him. Being recognized, they say, in spite  of his disguise by some one who met him he was saluted as emperor;  consequently he turned aside from the road and hid himself in a kind of  reedy place. There he waited till daylight, lying flat on the ground so as  to run the least risk of being seen. Every one who passed he suspected had  come for him; he started at every voice, thinking it to be that of some  one searching for him: if a dog barked anywhere or a bird chirped, or a  bush or twig was shaken by the breeze, he was thrown into a violent  tremor. These sounds would not let him have rest, yet he dared not speak a  word to any one of those that were with him for fear some one else might  hear: but he wept and bewailed his fortune, considering among other things  how he had once stood resplendent in the midst of so vast a retinue and  was now dodging from sight in company with three freedmen. Such was the  drama that Fate had now prepared for him, to the end that he should no  longer represent all other matricides and beggars, but only himself at  last. Now he repented of his haughty insolence, as if he could make one of  his acts undone. Such was the tragedy in which Nero found himself  involved, and this verse constantly ran through his mind:      \"Both spouse and father bid me pitiably die.\"    After a long time, as no one was seen to be searching for him, he went  over into the cave, where in his hunger he ate such bread as he had never  before tasted and in his thirst drank water such as he had never drunk  before. This gave him such a qualm that he said: \"So this is my famous  frigid _decocta_.\" [Footnote: Reading [Greek: apepsthon] (Reimar,  Cobet et al)..]    While he was in this plight the Roman people were going wild with delight  and offering whole oxen in sacrifice. Some carried small liberty caps, and  they voted to Galba the rights pertaining to the imperial office. For Nero  himself they instituted a search in all directions and for some time were  at a loss to know whither he could have betaken himself. When they finally  learned, they sent horsemen to dispose of him. He, then, perceiving that  they were drawing near, commanded his companions to kill him. As they  refused to obey, he uttered a groan and said: \"I alone have neither friend  nor foe.\" By this time the horsemen were close at hand, and so he killed  himself, uttering that far-famed sentence: \"Jupiter, what an artist  perishes in me!\" And as he lingered in his agony Epaphroditus dealt him a  finishing stroke. He had lived thirty years and nine months, out of which  he had ruled thirteen years and eight months. Of the descendants of Aeneas  and of Augustus he was the last, as was plainly indicated by the fact that  the laurels planted by Livia and the breed of white chickens perished  somewhat before his death.    There was no one who might not hope to lay hands on the sovereignty in a  time of so great confusion.    Rufus visited Galba and could obtain from him no important privileges,  unless one reckons the fact that a man who had frequently been hailed as  emperor was allowed to live. Among the rest of mankind, however, he had  acquired a great name, greater than if he had accepted the sovereignty,  for refusing to receive it.    Galba, now that Nero had been destroyed and the senate had voted him the  imperial authority and Rufus had made advances to him, plucked up courage.  However, He did not adopt the name \"Caesar,\" until envoys of the senate  had paid him a visit. Nor had he hitherto inscribed the name \"emperor\" in  any document.

(A.D. 69 = a.u. 822, to January 15th).      [Sidenote: A.D. 68 (a.u. 821)] [Sidenote:--1--] Thus was Galba declared  emperor just as Tiberius had foretold when he said to him: \"You also shall  have a little taste of sovereignty.\" The event was likewise foretold by  unmistakable omens. He beheld in visions the Goddess of Fortune telling  him that she had now stuck by him for a long time yet no one appeared  ready to take her into his house; and if she should be barred out much  longer she should take up her abode with some one else. During those very  days also boats full of weapons and under the guidance of no human being  came to anchor off the coast of Spain. And a mule brought forth young, an  occurrence which had been previously interpreted as destined to portend  the possession of authority by him. Again, a boy that was bringing him  incense in the course of a sacrifice suddenly had his hair turn gray;  whereupon the seers declared that dominion over the younger generation  should be given to his old age.    [Sidenote:--2--] These, then, were the signs given beforehand that had a  bearing on his sovereignty. Personally his conduct was in most ways  moderate and he avoided giving offence since he bore in mind that he had  not taken the emperor's seat but it had been given him;--indeed, he said  so frequently:--unfortunately, he collected money greedily since his wants  were numerous, though he spent comparatively little after all, bestowing  upon some persons not even denarii but merely asses. His freedmen,  however, committed a great number of wrongs, the responsibility for which  was laid upon him. Ordinary individuals need only keep themselves from  crime, but those who hold sovereign power must see to it that no dependent  of theirs practices villany either. For it makes little difference to the  ones who suffer wrong at whose hands they happen to be ill treated.  Consequently, even though Galba abstained from inflicting injury, yet he  was ill spoken of because he allowed these others to commit crimes, or at  least was ignorant of what was taking place. Nymphidius and Capito, in  particular, were allowed by him to run riot. For instance, Capito, when  one day some one appealed a case from his jurisdiction, changed his seat  hastily to a high chair near by and then cried out: \"Now plead your case  before Caesar!\" He went through the form of deciding it and had the man  put to death. Galba felt obliged to proceed against them for this.    [Sidenote:--3--] As he drew near the City, the guards of Nero met him and  asked that their organization be preserved intact. At first he was for  postponing his decision and averred that he wanted to think the matter  over. Since, however, they would not obey but kept up a clamor, the army  submitted to them. As a consequence about seven thousand of his soldiers  lost their lives and the guardsmen were decimated. This shows that even if  Galba was bowed down with age and disease, yet his spirit was keen and he  did not believe in an emperor's being compelled to do anything  unwillingly. A further proof is that when the Pretorians asked him for the  money which Nymphidius had promised them, he would not give it, but  replied: \"I am accustomed to levy soldiers, not to buy them.\" And when the  populace brought urgent pressure to bear on him to kill Tigillinus and  some others who had before been wantonly insolent, he would not yield,  though he would probably have disposed of them had not their enemies made  this demand. Helius, however, as well as Narcissus, Patrobius, Lucusta the  poison merchant, and some others who had been active in Nero's day, he  ordered to be carried in chains all over the city and afterwards to  receive punishment. The slaves, likewise, who had been guilty of any act  or speech detrimental to their masters were handed over to the latter for  punishment.    Some disdained receiving their own slaves, wishing to be rid of rascally  slaves.    Galba demanded the return of all moneys and objects of value which any  persons had received from Nero. However, if anybody had been exiled by the  latter on the charge of impiety towards the emperor, he restored him to  citizenship; and he also transferred to the tomb of Augustus the bones of  members of the imperial family who had been murdered, and he set up their  images anew.    For this he was praised. On the other hand he was the victim of uproarious  laughter for wearing a sword whenever he walked on the street, since he"]]]
