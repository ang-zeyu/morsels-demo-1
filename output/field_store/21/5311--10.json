The rushing winds had ceased, the pelting of the storm  was over, and, springing to the window, with delight pictured in her  face, she saw a glorious ray of sunshine lighting the opposite wood. The  foliage glittered with the checkered beauties of the October leaf,  reflecting back from the moistened boughs the richest luster of an  American autumn. In an instant, the piazza, which opened to the south,  was thronged with the inmates of the cottage. The air was mild, balmy,  and refreshing; in the east, clouds, which might be likened to the  retreating masses of a discomfited army, hung around the horizon in  awful and increasing darkness. At a little elevation above the cottage,  the thin vapor was still rushing towards the east with amazing velocity;  while in the west the sun had broken forth and shed his parting radiance  on the scene below, aided by the fullest richness of a clear atmosphere  and a freshened herbage. Such moments belong only to the climate of  America, and are enjoyed in a degree proportioned to the suddenness of  the contrast, and the pleasure we experience in escaping from the  turbulence of the elements to the quiet of a peaceful evening, and an  air still as the softest mornings in June.    \"What a magnificent scene!\" said Harper, in a low tone. \"How grand! how  awfully sublime!--may such a quiet speedily await the struggle in which  my country is engaged, and such a glorious evening follow the day of her  adversity!\"    Frances, who stood next to him, alone heard the voice. Turning in  amazement from the view to the speaker, she saw him standing bareheaded,  erect, and with his eyes lifted to heaven. There was no longer the quiet  which had seemed their characteristic, but they were lighted into  something like enthusiasm, and a slight flush passed over his features.    There can be no danger apprehended from such a man, thought Frances;  such feelings belong only to the virtuous.    The musings of the party were now interrupted by the sudden appearance  of the peddler. He had taken advantage of the first gleam of sunshine to  hasten to the cottage. Heedless of wet or dry as it lay in his path,  with arms swinging to and fro, and with his head bent forward of his  body several inches, Harvey Birch approached the piazza, with a gait  peculiarly his own. It was the quick, lengthened pace of an itinerant  vender of goods.    \"Fine evening,\" said the peddler, saluting the party, without raising  his eyes; \"quite warm and agreeable for the season.\"    Mr. Wharton assented to the remark, and inquired kindly after the health  of his father. Harvey heard him, and continued standing for some time in  moody silence; but the question being repeated, he answered with a  slight tremor in his voice,--    \"He fails fast; old age and hardships will do their work.\" The peddler  turned his face from the view of most of the family; but Frances noticed  his glistening eyes and quivering lip, and, for the second time, Harvey  rose in her estimation.    The valley in which the residence of Mr. Wharton stood ran in a  direction from northwest to southeast, and the house was placed on the  side of a hill which terminated its length in the former direction. A  small opening, occasioned by the receding of the opposite hill, and the  fall of the land to the level of the tide water, afforded a view of the  Sound [Footnote: An island more than forty leagues in length lies  opposite the coasts of New York and Connecticut. The arm of the sea  which separates it from the main is technically called a sound, and in  that part of the country _par excellence, the_ Sound. This sheet of  water varies in its breadth from five to thirty miles.] over the tops of  the distant woods on its margin. The surface of the water which had so  lately been lashing the shores with boisterous fury, was already losing  its ruffled darkness in the long and regular undulations that succeeded  a tempest, while the light air from the southwest was gently touching  their summits, lending its feeble aid in stilling the waters. Some dark  spots were now to be distinguished, occasionally rising into view, and  again sinking behind the lengthened waves which interposed themselves to  the sight. They were unnoticed by all but the peddler. He had seated  himself on the piazza, at a distance from Harper, and appeared to have  forgotten the object of his visit. His roving eye, however, soon caught  a glimpse of these new objects in the view, and he sprang up with  alacrity, gazing intently towards the water. He changed his place,  glanced his eye with marked uneasiness on Harper, and then said with  great emphasis--    \"The rig'lars must be out from below.\"    \"Why do you think so?\" inquired Captain Wharton, eagerly. \"God send it  may be true; I want their escort in again.\"    \"Them ten whaleboats would not move so fast unless they were better  manned than common.\"    \"Perhaps,\" cried Mr. Wharton in alarm, \"they are--they are continentals  returning from the island.\"    \"They look like rig'lars,\" said the peddler, with meaning.    \"Look!\" repeated the captain, \"there is nothing but spots to be seen.\"    Harvey disregarded his observation, but seemed to be soliloquizing, as  he said in an undertone, \"They came out before the gale--have laid on  the island these two days--horse are on the road--there will soon be  fighting near us.\" During this speech, Birch several times glanced his  eye towards Harper, with evident uneasiness, but no corresponding  emotion betrayed any interest of that gentleman in the scene. He stood  in silent contemplation of the view, and seemed enjoying the change in  the air. As Birch concluded, however, Harper turned to his host, and  mentioned that his business would not admit of unnecessary delay; he  would, therefore, avail himself of the fine evening to ride a few miles  on his journey. Mr. Wharton made many professions of regret at losing so  agreeable an inmate; but was too mindful of his duty not to speed the  parting guest, and orders were instantly given to that effect.    The uneasiness of the peddler increased in a manner for which nothing  apparent could account; his eye was constantly wandering towards the  lower end of the vale as if in expectation of some interruption from  that quarter. At length Caesar appeared, leading the noble beast which  was to bear the weight of the traveler. The peddler officiously  assisted to tighten the girths, and fasten the blue cloak and valise to  the mailstraps.    Every precaution being completed, Harper proceeded to take his leave. To  Sarah and her aunt he paid his compliments with ease and kindness; but  when he came to Frances, he paused a moment, while his face assumed an  expression of more than ordinary benignity. His eye repeated the  blessing which had before fallen from his lips, and the girl felt her  cheeks glow, and her heart beat with a quicker pulsation, as he spoke  his adieus. There was a mutual exchange of polite courtesy between the  host and his parting guest; but as Harper frankly offered his hand to  Captain Wharton, he remarked, in a manner of great solemnity,--    \"The step you have undertaken is one of much danger, and disagreeable  consequences to yourself may result from it; in such a case, I may have  it in my power to prove the gratitude I owe your family for its  kindness.\"    \"Surely, sir,\" cried the father, losing sight of delicacy in  apprehension for his child, \"you will keep secret the discovery which  your being in my house has enabled you to make?\"    Harper turned quickly to the speaker, and then, losing the sternness  which had begun to gather on his countenance, he answered mildly, \"I  have learned nothing in your family, sir, of which I was ignorant  before; but your son is safer from my knowledge of his visit than he  would be without it.\"    He bowed to the whole party, and without taking any notice of the  peddler, other than by simply thanking him for his attentions, mounted  his horse, and, riding steadily and gracefully through the little gate,  was soon lost behind the hill which sheltered the valley to the  northward.    The eyes of the peddler followed the retiring figure of the horseman so  long as it continued within view, and as it disappeared from his sight,  he drew a long and heavy sigh, as if relieved from a load of  apprehension. The Whartons had meditated in silence on the character and  visit of their unknown guest for the same period, when the father  approached Birch and observed,    \"I am yet your debtor, Harvey, for the tobacco you were so kind as to  bring me from the city.\"    \"If it should not prove so good as the first,\" replied the peddler,  fixing a last and lingering look in the direction of Harper's route, \"it  is owing to the scarcity of the article.\"    \"I like it much,\" continued the other; \"but you have forgotten to name  the price.\"    The countenance of the trader changed, and, losing its expression of  deep care in a natural acuteness, he answered,--    \"It is hard to say what ought to be the price; I believe I must leave it  to your own generosity.\"    Mr. Wharton had taken a hand well filled with the images of Carolus III  from his pocket, and now extended it towards Birch with three of the  pieces between his finger and thumb. Harvey's eyes twinkled as he  contemplated the reward; and rolling over in his mouth a large quantity  of the article in question, coolly stretched forth his hand, into which  the dollars fell with a most agreeable sound: but not satisfied with the  transient music of their fall, the peddler gave each piece in succession  a ring on the stepping-stone of the piazza, before he consigned it to  the safekeeping of a huge deerskin purse, which vanished from the sight  of the spectators so dexterously, that not one of them could have told  about what"]]]
