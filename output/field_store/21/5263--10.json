Clairaut, assisted by Lalande, found that  Saturn would retard the comet 100 days, Jupiter 518 days, and  predicted its return to perihelion on April 13th, 1759. In his  communication to the French Academy, he said that a comet travelling  into such distant regions might be exposed to the influence of forces  totally unknown, and \"even of some planet too far removed from the sun  to be ever perceived.\"    The excitement of astronomers towards the end of 1758 became intense;  and the honour of first catching sight of the traveller fell to an  amateur in Saxony, George Palitsch, on Christmas Day, 1758. It reached  perihelion on March 13th, 1759.    This fact was a startling confirmation of the Newtonian theory,  because it was a new kind of calculation of perturbations, and also it  added a new member to the solar system, and gave a prospect of adding  many more.    When Halley's comet reappeared in 1835, Pontecoulant's computations  for the date of perihelion passage were very exact, and afterwards he  showed that, with more exact values of the masses of Jupiter and  Saturn, his prediction was correct within two days, after an invisible  voyage of seventy-five years!    Hind afterwards searched out many old appearances of this comet, going  back to 11 B.C., and most of these have been identified as being  really Halley's comet by the calculations of Cowell and Cromellin[4]  (of Greenwich Observatory), who have also predicted its next  perihelion passage for April 8th to 16th, 1910, and have traced back  its history still farther, to 240 B.C.    Already, in November, 1907, the Astronomer Royal was trying to catch  it by the aid of photography.      FOOTNOTES:    [1] Born 1736; died 1813.    [2] Born 1749; died 1827.

DISCOVERY OF NEW PLANETS--HERSCHEL, PIAZZI, ADAMS, AND LE VERRIER.      It would be very interesting, but quite impossible in these pages, to  discuss all the exquisite researches of the mathematical astronomers,  and to inspire a reverence for the names connected with these  researches, which for two hundred years have been establishing the  universality of Newton's law. The lunar and planetary theories, the  beautiful theory of Jupiter's satellites, the figure of the earth, and  the tides, were mathematically treated by Maclaurin, D'Alembert,  Legendre, Clairaut, Euler, Lagrange, Laplace, Walmsley, Bailly,  Lalande, Delambre, Mayer, Hansen, Burchardt, Binet, Damoiseau, Plana,  Poisson, Gauss, Bessel, Bouvard, Airy, Ivory, Delaunay, Le Verrier,  Adams, and others of later date.    By passing over these important developments it is possible to trace  some of the steps in the crowning triumph of the Newtonian theory, by  which the planet Neptune was added to the known members of the solar  system by the independent researches of Professor J.C. Adams and of  M. Le Verrier, in 1846.    It will be best to introduce this subject by relating how the  eighteenth century increased the number of known planets, which was  then only six, including the earth.    On March 13th, 1781, Sir William Herschel was, as usual, engaged on  examining some small stars, and, noticing that one of them appeared to  be larger than the fixed stars, suspected that it might be a comet.  To test this he increased his magnifying power from 227 to 460 and  932, finding that, unlike the fixed stars near it, its definition was  impaired and its size increased.  This convinced him that the object  was a comet, and he was not surprised to find on succeeding nights  that the position was changed, the motion being in the ecliptic. He  gave the observations of five weeks to the Royal Society without a  suspicion that the object was a new planet.    For a long time people could not compute a satisfactory orbit for the  supposed comet, because it seemed to be near the perihelion, and no  comet had ever been observed with a perihelion distance from the sun  greater than four times the earth's distance. Lexell was the first to  suspect that this was a new planet eighteen times as far from the sun  as the earth is. In January, 1783, Laplace published the elliptic  elements. The discoverer of a planet has a right to name it, so  Herschel called it Georgium Sidus, after the king.  But Lalande urged  the adoption of the name Herschel.  Bode suggested Uranus, and this  was adopted. The new planet was found to rank in size next to Jupiter  and Saturn, being 4.3 times the diameter of the earth.    In 1787 Herschel discovered two satellites, both revolving in nearly  the same plane, inclined 80 deg. to the ecliptic, and the motion of both  was retrograde.    In 1772, before Herschel's discovery, Bode[1] had discovered a curious  arbitrary law of planetary distances.  Opposite each planet's name  write the figure 4; and, in succession, add the numbers 0, 3, 6, 12,  24, 48, 96, etc., to the 4, always doubling the last numbers.  You  then get the planetary distances.      Mercury, dist.-- 4  4 +   0 =   4    Venus      \"     7  4 +   3 =   7    Earth      \"    10  4 +   6 =  10    Mars       \"    15  4 +  12 =  16     --                 4 +  24 =  28    Jupiter  dist.  52  4 +  48 =  52    Saturn     \"    95  4 +  96 = 100    (Uranus)   \"   192  4 + 192 = 196     --                 4 + 384 = 388    All the five planets, and the earth, fitted this rule, except that  there was a blank between Mars and Jupiter. When Uranus was  discovered, also fitting the rule, the conclusion was irresistible  that there is probably a planet between Mars and Jupiter. An  association of twenty-four astronomers was now formed in Germany to  search for the planet. Almost immediately afterwards the planet was  discovered, not by any member of the association, but by Piazzi, when  engaged upon his great catalogue of stars. On January 1st, 1801, he  observed a star which had changed its place the next night. Its motion  was retrograde till January 11th, direct after the 13th.  Piazzi fell  ill before he had enough observations for computing the orbit with  certainty, and the planet disappeared in the sun's rays. Gauss  published an approximate ephemeris of probable positions when the  planet should emerge from the sun's light. There was an exciting hunt,  and on December 31st (the day before its birthday) De Zach captured  the truant, and Piazzi christened it Ceres.      The mean distance from the sun was found to be 2.767, agreeing with  the 2.8 given by Bode's law. Its orbit was found to be inclined over  10 deg. to the ecliptic, and its diameter was only 161 miles.    On March 28th, 1802, Olbers discovered a new seventh magnitude star,  which turned out to be a planet resembling Ceres. It was called  Pallas. Gauss found its orbit to be inclined 35 deg. to the ecliptic, and  to cut the orbit of Ceres; whence Olbers considered that these might  be fragments of a broken-up planet. He then commenced a search for  other fragments. In 1804 Harding discovered Juno, and in 1807 Olbers  found Vesta. The next one was not discovered until 1845, from which  date asteroids, or minor planets (as these small planets are called),  have been found almost every year. They now number about 700.    It is impossible to give any idea of the interest with which the first  additions since prehistoric times to the planetary system were  received. All of those who showered congratulations upon the  discoverers regarded these discoveries in the light of rewards for  patient and continuous labours, the very highest rewards that could be  desired. And yet there remained still the most brilliant triumph of  all, the addition of another planet like Uranus, before it had ever  been seen, when the analysis of Adams and Le Verrier gave a final  proof of the powers of Newton's great law to explain any planetary  irregularity.    After Sir William Herschel discovered Uranus, in 1781, it was found  that astronomers had observed it on many previous occasions, mistaking  it for a fixed star of the sixth or seventh magnitude. Altogether,  nineteen observations of Uranus's position, from the time of  Flamsteed, in 1690, had been recorded.    In 1790 Delambre, using all these observations, prepared tables for  computing its position. These worked well enough for a time, but at  last the differences between the calculated and observed longitudes of  the planet became serious. In 1821 Bouvard undertook a revision of the  tables, but found it impossible to reconcile all the observations of  130 years (the period of revolution of Uranus is eighty-four years).  So he deliberately rejected the old ones, expressing the opinion that  the discrepancies might depend upon \"some foreign and unperceived  cause which may have been acting upon the planet.\" In a few years the  errors even of these tables became intolerable. In 1835 the error of  longitude was 30\"; in 1838, 50\"; in 1841, 70\"; and, by comparing the  errors derived from observations made before and after opposition, a  serious error of the distance (radius vector) became apparent.    In 1843 John Couch Adams came out Senior Wrangler at Cambridge, and  was free to undertake the research which as an undergraduate he had  set himself--to see whether the disturbances of Uranus could be  explained by assuming a certain orbit, and position in that orbit, of  a hypothetical planet even more distant than Uranus.  Such an  explanation had been suggested, but until 1843 no one had the boldness  to attack the problem.
