Sunflower was  given that name because she always looked on the bright side of  everything; she looked like a sunflower, too, with her tanned face and  light, curly hair.    All the girls had symbolical names given them. \"Lark\" was so named  because of her sweet voice and because she loved to sing; \"Sweet  Tooth,\" on account of her love for candy; \"Quick Silver,\" because she  was quick, bright and witty; \"Great Buffalo,\" a girl who was very  strong; Elizabeth Schmidt, \"Laughing Water,\" so named because she  laughed and giggled at everybody and everything; \"Babbling Brook,\"  because it seemed an utter impossibility for her to stop talking;  \"Burr,\" because she sticks to ideas and friends; \"Faith,\" quiet and  reserved; \"Comet,\" comes suddenly and brings a lot of light; \"Black  Hawk,\" always eager at first, but inclined to let her eagerness wear  off: \"Pocahontas,\" because she never can hurry; \"Ginger Foot,\" a  fiery temper, \"Gypsy,\" so named on account of her black hair; \"Bright  Eyes,\" for her bright, blue eyes; \"Rainbow,\" for her many ways, and  because she is pretty.    As \"Sunflower\" took the matches and knelt by the pile of wood and  lighted the fire, she recited the Ode to the Fire:    \"Oh, Fire! Long years ago, when our fathers fought with great beasts,  you were their protector. From the cruel cold of winter you saved.  When they needed food, you changed the flesh of beasts into savory  meat for them. Through all ages your mysterious flame has been a  symbol of the Great Spirit to them. Tonight we light this fire in  remembrance of the Great Spirit Who gave you to us.\"    Then the girls sang the chant or chanted:        Wohelo for aye,      Wohelo for aye,      Wohelo for aye,      Wohelo for work,      Wohelo for health,      Wohelo,      Wohelo for love.    Then they recited the Wood-gatherer's Desire:    \"It is my desire to be a Campfire Girl and keep the law of the Camp  Fire, which is 'To Seek Beauty, Give Service, Pursue Knowledge, Be  Trustworthy, Hold onto Health, Glorify Work, Be Happy,'\"    None had yet attained the highest rank, that of Torch Bearer, won by  still greater achievement, the Camp having been organized so recently.  Their motto was \"The light which has been given to me, I desire to  pass undimmed to others.\"    \"Gypsy,\" the secretary, then read the \"Count\" for the last meeting and  called the roll, and the girls handed in the list of honors they had  won in the last month. Some amused themselves playing games, while  others gathered more wood.    At five o'clock the corn and white and sweet potatoes were in the fire  roasting. A jolly circle of girls around the fire were busily engaged  toasting \"Weiners\" for the feast, which was finally pronounced ready  to be partaken of. The hungry girls \"fell to\" and everything eatable  disappeared as if by magic; and last, but not least, was the toasting  of marshmallows, speared on the points of long, two-pronged sticks  (broken from near-by trees), which were held over the fire until the  marshmallows turned a delicate color. When everything had been eaten,  with the exception of several cardboard boxes, corn cobs and husks,  the girls quickly cleared up. Then, seated around the fire, told what  they knew of Indian legends and folklore.    Noticing the sun slowly sinking in the West, they quickly gathered  together their belongings and started homeward singing, \"My Country,  'tis of Thee, Sweet Land of Liberty.\"    Thus broke up the second Council Fire, and in the heart of each girl  was the thought of how much the Campfire was helping them to love God  and His works.          CHAPTER XIV.    MARY MAKES \"VIOLET\" AND \"ROSE LEAF\" BEADS.      \"Aunt Sarah,\" exclaimed Mary one day, \"you promised to tell me exactly  how you made those 'Rose Beads' you have.\"    \"Yes, my dear, and you must make the beads before the June roses are  gone. The process is very simple. If you would have them very sweet,  get the petals of the most fragrant roses. I used petals of the  old-fashioned, pink 'hundred leaf' and 'blush roses.' Gather a  quantity, for you will need them all. Grind them to a pulp in the food  chopper, repeat several times and place the pulp and juice into an  _iron_ kettle or pan. This turns the pulp black, which nothing but an  iron kettle will do; cook, and when the consistency of dough it is  ready to mold into beads. Take a bit of the dough, again as large as  the size you wish your beads to be when finished, as they shrink in  size when dried, and make them of uniform size, or larger ones for the  centre of the necklace, as you prefer. Roll in the palms of your  hands, until perfectly round, stick a pin through each bead, then  stick the pins into a bake board. Be careful the bead does not touch  the board, as that would spoil its shape. Allow the beads to remain  until perfectly dry. If they are to have a dull finish, leave as they  are. If you wish to polish them, take a tiny piece of vaseline on the  palm of the hand and rub them between the palms until the vaseline is  absorbed. Then string them on a linen thread. Keep in a closed box to  preserve their fragrance. Those I showed you, Mary, I made many years  ago, and the scent of the roses clings 'round them still.'\"    \"Did you know, Mary, that beads may be made from the petals of the  common wild blue violet in exactly the same manner as they are made  from rose leaves?\"    \"No, indeed, but I don't think the making of beads from the petals of  roses and violets as wonderful as the beads which you raise in the  garden. Those shiny, pearl-like seeds or beads of silvery-gray, called  'Job's Tears,' which grow on a stalk resembling growing corn; and to  think Professor Schmidt raised those which Elizabeth strung on linen  thread, alternately with beads, for a portiere in their sitting-room.\"    \"Yes, my dear, the beads must be pierced before they become hard;  later they should be polished. Did you ever see them grow, Mary? The  beads or 'tears' grow on a stalk about fifteen inches high and from  the bead or 'tear' grows a tiny, green spear resembling oats. They are  odd and with very little care may he grown in a small garden.\"    \"They certainly are a curiosity,\" said Mary.          CHAPTER XV.    MARY AND ELIZABETH VISIT SADIE SINGMASTER.      Farmer Landis, happening to mention at the breakfast table his  intention of driving over to the \"Ax Handle Factory\" to obtain wood  ashes to use as a fertilizer, his wife remarked, \"Why not take Mary  with you, John? She can stop at Singmaster's with a basket of carpet  rags for Sadie. I've been wanting to send them over for some time.\"  Turning to Mary, she said: \"Poor little, crippled Sadie! On account of  a fall, which injured her spine, when a small child, she has been  unable to walk for years. She cuts and sews carpet rags, given her by  friends and neighbors, and from their sale to a carpet weaver in a  near-by town, helps her widowed mother eke out her small income.\"    \"I'd love to go see her,\" said Mary. Elizabeth Schmidt also expressed  her willingness to go, when asked, saying: \"I am positive mother will  add her contribution to the carpet rags for Sadie, I do pity her so  very much.\"    \"Yes,\" said Mary's Aunt, \"she is poor and proud. She will not accept  charity, so we persuade her to take carpet rags, as we have more than  we can possibly use.\"    On reaching the Singmaster cottage, the girls alighted with their  well-filled baskets, Mary's Uncle driving on to the \"Ax Handle  Factory,\" promising to call for the girls on his return. The sad,  brown eyes of Sadie, too large for her pinched, sallow face, shone  with pleasure at sight of the two young girls so near her own age, and  she smiled her delight on examining the numerous bright-colored  patches brought by them. Thinking the pleasure she so plainly showed  might appear childish to the two girls, she explained: \"I do get so  dreadfully tired sewing together so many dull homely rags. I shall  enjoy making balls of these pretty, bright colors.\"    \"Sadie,\" Mary inquired, \"will you think me inquisitive should I ask  what the carpet weaver pays you for the rags when you have sewed and  wound them into balls?\"    \"Certainly not,\" replied Sadie. \"Four cents a pound is what he pays  me. It takes two of these balls to make a pound,\" and she held up a  ball she had just finished winding.    \"Is _that all_ you get?\" exclaimed Elizabeth.    \"Have you ever made rag rugs?\" inquired Mary.    \"No, I have never even seen one. Are they anything like braided mats?\"    \"Yes, they are somewhat similar to them, but I crochet mine and think  them prettier. I have made several, with Aunt Sarah's assistance. I'll  come over and teach you to make them one of these days, should you  care to learn, and I'm positive you will find ready sale for them. In  fact, I've several friends in the city who have admired the ones I  have, and would like to buy rugs for the Colonial rooms they are  furnishing. Sadie, can you crochet?\"    \"Oh, yes. I can do the plain stitch very well.\"    \"That is all that will be necessary. You will become very much  interested in inventing new designs, it is very fascinating work, and  it will be more remunerative than sewing carpet rags. Aunt Sarah will  send you more carpet rags if you require them, and should you wish  dull colors of blue or pink, a small package of dye will transform  white or light-colored rags into any desired shade, to match the  furnishings of different rooms. I think the crocheted rugs much  prettier than the braided ones, which are so popular in the 'Nutting'  pictures, and the same pretty shades may be used when rugs are  crocheted.\"    When Farmer Landis came for the girls, he found them too busily  engaged talking to "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/13559"],[0,"The Backwoods of Canada (#13)"],[1,"more than we do. One of their most remarkable terms is to  \"_Fix_.\" Whatever work requires to be done it must be _fixed_. \"Fix the  room\" is, set it in order. \"Fix the table\"--\"Fix the fire,\" says the  mistress to her servants, and the things are fixed accordingly.    I was amused one day by hearing a woman tell her husband the chimney  wanted fixing. I thought it seemed secure enough, and was a little  surprised when the man got a rope and a few cedar boughs, with which he  dislodged an accumulation of soot that caused the fire to smoke. The  chimney being _fixed_, all went right again. This odd term is not  confined to the lower orders alone, and, from hearing it so often, it  becomes a standard word even among the later emigrants from our own  country.    With the exception of some few remarkable expressions, and an attempt at  introducing fine words in their every-day conversation, the lower order  of Yankees have a decided advantage over our English peasantry in the  use of grammatical language: they speak better English than you will  hear from persons of the same class in any part of England, Ireland, or  Scotland; a fact that we should be unwilling, I suppose, to allow at  home.    If I were asked what appeared to me the most striking feature in the  manners of the Americans that I had met with, I should say it was  coldness approaching to apathy. I do not at all imagine them to be  deficient in feeling or real sensibility, but they do not suffer their  emotion to be seen. They are less profuse in their expressions of  welcome and kindness than we are, though probably quite as sincere. No  one doubts their hospitality; but, after all, one likes to see the  hearty shake of the hand, and hear the cordial word that makes one feel  oneself welcome.    Persons who come to this country are very apt to confound the old  settlers from Britain with the native Americans; and when they meet with  people of rude, offensive manners, using certain Yankee words in their  conversation, and making a display of independence not exactly suitable  to their own aristocratical notions, they immediately suppose they must  be genuine Yankees, while they are, in fact, only imitators; and you  well know the fact that a bad imitation is always worse than the  original.    You would be surprised to see how soon the new comers fall into this  disagreeable manner and affectation of equality, especially the inferior  class of Irish and Scotch; the English less so. We were rather  entertained by the behaviour of a young Scotchman, the engineer of the  steamer, on my husband addressing him with reference to the management  of the engine. His manners were surly, and almost insolent. He  scrupulously avoided the least approach to courtesy or outward respect;  nay, he even went so far as to seat himself on the bench close beside  me, and observed that \"among the many advantages this country offered to  settlers like him, he did not reckon it the least of them that he was  not obliged to take off his hat when he spoke to people (meaning persons  of our degree), or address them by any other title than their name;  besides, he could go and take his seat beside any gentleman or lady  either, and think himself to the full as good as them.    \"Very likely,\" I replied, hardly able to refrain from laughing at this  sally; \"but I doubt you greatly overrate the advantage of such  privileges, for you cannot oblige the lady or gentleman to entertain the  same opinion of your qualifications, or to remain seated beside you  unless it pleases them to do so.\" With these words I rose up and left  the independent gentleman evidently a little confounded at the  manoeuvre: however, he soon recovered his self-possession, and continued  swinging the axe he held in his hand, and said, \"It is no crime, I  guess, being born a poor man.\"    \"None in the world,\" replied my husband; \"a man's birth is not of his  own choosing. A man can no more help being born poor than rich; neither  is it the fault of a gentleman being born of parents who occupy a higher  station in society than his neighbour. I hope you will allow this?\"    The Scotchman was obliged to yield a reluctant affirmative to the latter  position; but concluded with again repeating his satisfaction at not  being obliged in this country to take off his hat, or speak with respect  to gentlemen, as they styled themselves.    \"No one, my friend, could have obliged you to be well mannered at home  any more than in Canada. Surely you could have kept your hat on your  head if you had been so disposed; no gentleman would have knocked it  off, I am sure.    \"As to the boasted advantage of rude manners in Canada, I should think  something of it if it benefited you the least, or put one extra dollar  in your pocket; but I have my doubts if it has that profitable effect.\"    \"There is a comfort, I guess, in considering oneself equal to a  gentleman.\"    \"Particularly if you could induce the gentleman to think the same.\" This  was a point that seemed rather to disconcert our candidate for equality,  who commenced whistling and kicking his heels with redoubled energy.    \"Now,\" said his tormentor, \"you have explained your notions of Canadian  independence; be so good as to explain the machinery of your engine,  with which you seem very well acquainted.\"    The man eyed my husband for a minute, half sulking, half pleased at the  implied compliment on his skill, and, walking off to the engine,  discussed the management of it with considerable fluency, and from that  time treated us with perfect respect. He was evidently struck with my  husband's reply to his question, put in a most discourteous tone, \"Pray,  what makes a gentleman: I'll thank you to answer me that?\" \"Good manners  and good education,\" was the reply. \"A rich man or a high-born man, if  he is rude, ill-mannered, and ignorant, is no more a gentleman than  yourself.\"    This put the matter on a different footing, and the engineer had the  good sense to perceive that rude familiarity did not constitute a  gentleman.    But it is now time I should give you some account of Peterborough,  which, in point of situation, is superior to any place I have yet seen  in the Upper Province. It occupies a central point between the townships  of Monaghan, Smith, Cavan, Otanabee, and Douro, and may with propriety  be considered as the capital of the Newcastle district.    It is situated on a fine elevated plain, just above the small lake,  where the river is divided by two low wooded islets. The original or  government part of the town is laid out in half-acre lots; the streets,  which are now fast filling up, are nearly at right angles with the  river, and extend towards the plains to the northeast. These plains form  a beautiful natural park, finely diversified with hill and dale, covered  with a lovely green sward, enamelled with a variety of the most  exquisite flowers, and planted, as if by Nature's own hand, with groups  of feathery pines, oaks, balsam, poplar, and silver birch. The views  from these plains are delightful; whichever way you turn your eyes they  are gratified by a diversity of hill and dale, wood and water, with the  town spreading over a considerable tract of ground.    The plains descend with a steep declivity towards the river, which  rushes with considerable impetuosity between its banks. Fancy a long,  narrow valley, and separating the east and west portions of the town  into two distinct villages.    [Illustration: Spruce]    The Otanabee bank rises to a loftier elevation than the Monaghan side,  and commands an extensive view over the intervening valley, the opposite  town, and the boundary forest and hills behind it: this is called  Peterborough East, and is in the hands of two or three individuals of  large capital, from whom the town lots are purchased.    Peterborough thus divided covers a great extent of ground, more than  sufficient for the formation of a large city. The number of inhabitants  are now reckoned at seven hundred and upwards, and if it continues to  increase as rapidly in the next few years as it has done lately, it will  soon be a very populous town*.    [*Since this account of Peterborough was written, the town has increased  at least a third in buildings and population.]    There is great water-power, both as regards the river and the fine broad  creek which winds its way through the town and falls into the small lake  below. There are several saw and grist-mills, a distillery, fulling-  mill, two principal inns, beside smaller ones, a number of good stores,  a government school-house, which also serves for a church, till one more  suitable should be built. The plains are sold off in park lots, and some  pretty little dwellings are being built, but I much fear the natural  beauties of this lovely spot will be soon spoiled.    I am never weary with strolling about, climbing the hills in every  direction, to catch some new prospect, or gather some new flowers,  which, though getting late in the summer, are still abundant.    Among the plants with whose names I am acquainted are a variety of  shrubby asters, of every tint of blue, purple, and pearly white; a lilac  _monarda_, most delightfully aromatic, even to the dry stalks and seed-  vessels; the white _gnaphalium_ or everlasting flower; roses of several  kinds, a few late buds of which I found in a valley, near the church. I  also noticed among the shrubs a very pretty little plant, resembling our  box; it trails along the ground, sending up branches and shoots; the  leaves turn of a deep copper red*; yet, in spite of this contradiction,  it is an evergreen. I also noticed some beautiful lichens, with coral  caps surmounting the grey hollow footstalks, which grow in irregular  tufts among the dry mosses, or more frequently I found them covering the  roots of the trees or half-decayed timbers. Among a variety of fungi I  gathered a hollow cup of the most splendid"]]]
