How they were as good as their word and how, when Johnny returned, they  stood aside and let Johnny and the sheriff fight it out. How the sheriff  beat Johnny to the draw, but was wounded in the left arm while Johnny  fired a second shot as he lay dying on the floor of the lean-to. How the  sheriff's wound was dressed by the companions of the dead Johnny, and how  he was safely dismissed with honor, as between brave men, and how  afterwards he hunted those same men down one by one.    It was quite a long story, but the audience followed it with a breathless  interest.    \"Yes, sir,\" concluded the sheriff, as the applause of murmurs fell off.  \"And from yarns like that one you wouldn't never figure it that I was the  son of a minister brung up plumb peaceful. Now, would you?\"    And again, to the intense joy of Vance, it was Terry who brought the  subject back, and this time the subject of all subjects which Elizabeth  dreaded, and which Vance longed for.    \"Tell us how you came to branch out, Sheriff Minter?\"    \"It was this way,\" began the sheriff, while Elizabeth cast at Vance a  glance of frantic and weary appeal, to which he responded with a gesture  which indicated that the cause was lost.    \"I was brung up mighty proper. I had a most amazing lot of prayers at the  tip of my tongue when I wasn't no more'n knee-high to a grasshopper. But  when a man has got a fire in him, they ain't no use trying to smother it.  You either got to put water on it or else let it burn itself out.    \"My old man didn't see it that way. When I got to cutting up he'd try to  smother it, and stop me by saying: 'Don't!' Which don't accomplish  nothing with young gents that got any spirit. Not a damn thing--asking  your pardon, ladies! Well, sirs, he kept me in harness, you might say,  and pulling dead straight down the road and working hard and faithful.  But all the time I'd been saving up steam, and swelling and swelling and  getting pretty near ready to bust.    \"Well, sirs, pretty soon--we was living in Garrison City them days, when  Garrison wasn't near the town that it is now--along comes word that Jack  Hollis is around. A lot of you younger folks ain't never heard nothing  about him. But in his day Jack Hollis was as bad as they was made. They  was nothing that Jack wouldn't turn to real handy, from shootin' up a  town to sticking up a train or a stage. And he done it all just about as  well. He was one of them universal experts. He could blow a safe as neat  as you'd ask. And if it come to a gun fight, he was greased lightning  with a flying start. That was Jack Hollis.\"    The sheriff paused to draw breath.    \"Perhaps,\" said Elizabeth Cornish, white about the lips, \"we had better  go into the living room to hear the rest of the sheriff's story?\"    It was not a very skillful diversion, but Elizabeth had reached the point  of utter desperation. And on the way into the living room unquestionably  she would be able to divert Terry to something else. Vance held his  breath.    And it was Terry who signed his own doom.    \"We're very comfortable here, Aunt Elizabeth. Let's not go in till the  sheriff has finished his story.\"    The sheriff rewarded him with a flash of gratitude, and Vance settled  back in his chair. The end could not, now, be far away.        CHAPTER 12      \"I was saying,\" proceeded the sheriff, \"that they scared their babies in  these here parts with the name of Jack Hollis. Which they sure done.  Well, sir, he was bad.\"    \"Not all bad, surely,\" put in Vance. \"I've heard a good many stories  about the generosity of--\"    He was anxious to put in the name of Black Jack, since the sheriff was  sticking so close to \"Jack Hollis,\" which was a name that Terry had not  yet heard for his dead father. But before he could get out the name, the  sheriff, angry at the interruption, resumed the smooth current of his  tale with a side flash at Vance.    \"Not all bad, you say? Generous? Sure he was generous. Them that live  outside the law has got to be generous to keep a gang around 'em. Not  that Hollis ever played with a gang much, but he had hangers-on all over  the mountains and gents that he had done good turns for and hadn't gone  off and talked about it. But that was just common sense. He knew he'd  need friends that he could trust if he ever got in trouble. If he was  wounded, they had to be someplace where he could rest up. Ain't that so?  Well, sir, that's what the goodness of Jack Hollis amounted to. No, sir,  he was bad. Plumb bad and all bad!    \"But he had them qualities that a young gent with an imagination is apt  to cotton to. He was free with his money. He dressed like a dandy. He'd  gamble with hundreds, and then give back half of his winnings if he'd  broke the gent that run the bank. Them was the sort of things that Jack  Hollis would do. And I had my head full of him. Well, about the time that  he come to the neighborhood, I sneaked out of the house one night and  went off to a dance with a girl that I was sweet on. And when I come  back, I found Dad waiting up for me ready to skin me alive. He tried to  give me a clubbing. I kicked the stick out of his hands and swore that  I'd leave and never come back. Which I never done, living up to my word  proper.    \"But when I found myself outside in the night, I says to myself: 'Where  shall I go now?'    \"And then, being sort of sick at the world, and hating Dad particular, I  decided to go out and join Jack Hollis. I was going to go bad. Mostly to  cut up Dad, I reckon, and not because I wanted to particular.    \"It wasn't hard to find Jack Hollis. Not for a kid my age that was sure  not to be no officer of the law. Besides, they didn't go out single and  hunt for Hollis. They went in gangs of a half a dozen at a time, or more  if they could get 'em. And even then they mostly got cleaned up when they  cornered Hollis. Yes, sir, he made life sad for the sheriffs in them  parts that he favored most.    \"I found Jack toasting bacon over a fire. He had two gents with him, and  they brung me in, finding me sneaking around like a fool kid instead of  walking right into camp. Jack sized me up a minute. He was a fine-looking  boy, was Hollis. He gimme a look out of them fine black eyes of his which  I won't never forget. Aye, a handsome scoundrel, that Hollis!\"    Elizabeth Cornish sank back in her chair and covered her eyes with her  hands for a moment. To the others it seemed that she was merely rubbing  weary eyes. But her brother knew perfectly that she was near to fainting.    He looked at Terry and saw that the boy was following the tale with  sparkling eyes.    \"I like what you say about this Hollis, sheriff,\" he ventured softly.    \"Do you? Well, so did I like what I seen of him that night, for all I  knew that he was a no-good, man-killing, heartless sort. I told him right  off that I wanted to join him. I even up and give him an exhibition of  shooting.    \"What do you think he says to me? 'You go home to your ma, young man!'    \"That's what he said.    \"'I ain't a baby,' says I to Jack Hollis. 'I'm a grown man. I'm ready to  fight your way.'    \"'Any fool can fight,' says Jack Hollis. 'But a gent with any sense don't  have to fight. You can lay to that, son!'    \"'Don't call me son,' says I. 'I'm older than you was when you started  out.'    \"I'd had my heart busted before I started,' says Jack Hollis to me. 'Are  you as old as that, son? You go back home and don't bother me no more.  I'll come back in five years and see if you're still in the same mind!'    \"And that was what I seen of Jack Hollis.    \"I went back into town--Garrison City. I slept over the stables the rest  of that night. The next day I loafed around town not hardly noways  knowing what I was going to do.    \"Then I was loafing around with my rifle, like I was going out on a  hunting trip that afternoon. And pretty soon I heard a lot of noise  coming down the street, guns and what not. I look out the window and  there comes Jack Hollis, hellbent! Jack Hollis! And then it pops into my  head that they was a big price, for them days, on Jack's head. I picked  up my gun and eased it over the sill of the window and got a good bead.    \"Jack turned in his saddle--\"    There was a faint groan from Elizabeth Cornish. All eyes focused on her  in amazement. She mustered a smile. The story went on.    \"When Jack turned to blaze away at them that was piling out around the  corner of the street, I let the gun go, and I drilled him clean. Great  sensation, gents, to have a life under your trigger. Just beckon one mite  of an inch and a life goes scooting up to heaven or down to hell. I never  got over seeing Hollis spill sidewise out of that saddle. There he was a  minute before better'n any five men when it come to fighting. And now he  wasn't nothing but a lot of trouble to bury. Just so many pounds of  flesh. You see? Well, sir, the price on Black Jack set me up in life and  gimme my start. After that I sort of specialized in manhunting, and I've  kept on ever since.\"    Terry leaned across the table, his left arm outstretched to call the  sheriff's attention.    \"I didn't catch that last name, sheriff,\" he said.    The talk was already beginning to bubble up at the end of the sheriff's  tale. But there was something in the tone of the boy that cut through the  talk to its root. People were suddenly looking at him out of eyes which  were very wide indeed. And it was not hard to find a reason. His handsome  face was colorless, like a carving from the stone, and under his knitted  brows his black eyes were ominous in the shadow. The sheriff frankly  gaped at him. It was another man who sat across the table in the chair  where the ingenuous youth had been a moment before.    \"What name? Jack Hollis?\"    \"I think the name you used was Black Jack, sheriff?\"    \"Black Jack? Sure. That was the other"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/9932"],[0,"The Last Trail (#12)"],[1,"hts.  To her the day was as a far-off dream. The great watch stars grew wan  before the radiant moon; it reigned alone. The immensity of the world  with its glimmering rivers, pensive valleys and deep, gloomy forests  lay revealed under the glory of the clear light.    Absorbed in this contemplation Helen remained a long time gazing with  dreamy ecstasy at the moonlit valley until a slight chill disturbed  her happy thoughts. She knew she was not alone. Trembling, she stood  up to see, easily recognizable in the moonlight, the tall  buckskin-garbed figure of Jonathan Zane.    \"Well, sir,\" she called, sharply, yet with a tremor in her voice.    The borderman came forward and stood in front of her. Somehow he  appeared changed. The long, black rifle, the dull, glinting weapons  made her shudder. Wilder and more untamable he looked than ever. The  very silence of the forest clung to him; the fragrance of the grassy  plains came faintly from his buckskin garments.    \"Evenin', lass,\" he said in his slow, cool manner.    \"How did you get here?\" asked Helen presently, because he made no  effort to explain his presence at such a late hour.    \"I was able to walk.\"    Helen observed, with a vaulting spirit, one ever ready to rise in  arms, that Master Zane was disposed to add humor to his penetrating  mysteriousness. She flushed hot and then paled. This borderman  certainly possessed the power to vex her, and, reluctantly she  admitted, to chill her soul and rouse her fear. She strove to keep  back sharp words, because she had learned that this singular  individual always gave good reason for his odd actions.    \"I think in kindness to me,\" she said, choosing her words carefully,  \"you might tell me why you appear so suddenly, as if you had sprung  out of the ground.\"    \"Are you alone?\"    \"Yes. Father is in bed; so is Mabel, and Will has not yet come home.  Why?\"    \"Has no one else been here?\"    \"Mr. Brandt came, as did some others; but wishing to be alone, I did  not see them,\" replied Helen in perplexity.    \"Have you seen Brandt since?\"    \"Since when?\"    \"The night I watched by the lilac bush.\"    \"Yes, several times,\" replied Helen. Something in his tone made her  ashamed. \"I couldn't very well escape when he called. Are you  surprised because after he insulted me I'd see him?\"    \"Yes.\"    Helen felt more ashamed.    \"You don't love him?\" he continued.    Helen was so surprised she could only look into the dark face above  her. Then she dropped her gaze, abashed by his searching eyes. But,  thinking of his question, she subdued the vague stirrings of pleasure  in her breast, and answered coldly:    \"No, I do not; but for the service you rendered me I should never have  answered such a question.\"    \"I'm glad, an' hope you care as little for the other five men who were  here that night.\"    \"I declare, Master Zane, you seem exceedingly interested in the  affairs of a young woman whom you won't visit, except as you have come  to-night.\"    He looked at her with his piercing eyes.    \"You spied upon my guests,\" she said, in no wise abashed now that her  temper was high. \"Did you care so very much?\"    \"Care?\" he asked slowly.    \"Yes; you were interested to know how many of my admirers were here,  what they did, and what they said. You even hint disparagingly  of them.\"    \"True, I wanted to know,\" he replied; \"but I don't hint about any  man.\"    \"You are so interested you wouldn't call on me when I invited you,\"  said Helen, with poorly veiled sarcasm. It was this that made her  bitter; she could never forget that she had asked this man to come to  see her, and he had refused.    \"I reckon you've mistook me,\" he said calmly.    \"Why did you come? Why do you shadow my friends? This is twice you  have done it. Goodness knows how many times you've been here!  Tell me.\"    The borderman remained silent.    \"Answer me,\" commanded Helen, her eyes blazing. She actually stamped  her foot. \"Borderman or not, you have no right to pry into my affairs.  If you are a gentleman, tell me why you came here?\"    The eyes Jonathan turned on Helen stilled all the angry throbbing of  her blood.    \"I come here to learn which of your lovers is the dastard who plotted  the abduction of Mabel Lane, an' the thief who stole our hosses. When  I find the villain I reckon Wetzel an' I'll swing him to some tree.\"    The borderman's voice rang sharp and cold, and when he ceased speaking  she sank back upon the step, shocked, speechless, to gaze up at him  with staring eyes.    \"Don't look so, lass; don't be frightened,\" he said, his voice gentle  and kind as it had been hard. He took her hand in his. \"You nettled me  into replyin'. You have a sharp tongue, lass, and when I spoke I was  thinkin' of him. I'm sorry.\"    \"A horse-thief and worse than murderer among my friends!\" murmured  Helen, shuddering, yet she never thought to doubt his word.    \"I followed him here the night of your company.\"    \"Do you know which one?\"    \"No.\"    He still held her hand, unconsciously, but Helen knew it well. A sense  of his strength came with the warm pressure, and comforted her. She  would need that powerful hand, surely, in the evil days which seemed  to darken the horizon.    \"What shall I do?\" she whispered, shuddering again.    \"Keep this secret between you an' me.\"    \"How can I? How can I?\"    \"You must,\" his voice was deep and low. \"If you tell your father, or  any one, I might lose the chance to find this man, for, lass, he's  desperate cunnin'. Then he'd go free to rob others, an' mebbe help  make off with other poor girls. Lass, keep my secret.\"    \"But he might try to carry me away,\" said Helen in fearful perplexity.    \"Most likely he might,\" replied the borderman with the smile that came  so rarely.    \"Oh! Knowing all this, how can I meet any of these men again? I'd  betray myself.\"    \"No; you've got too much pluck. It so happens you are the one to help  me an' Wetzel rid the border of these hell-hounds, an' you won't fail.  I know a woman when it comes to that.\"    \"I--I help you and Wetzel?\"    \"Exactly.\"    \"Gracious!\" cried Helen, half-laughing, half-crying. \"And poor me with  more trouble coming on the next boat.\"    \"Lass, the colonel told me about the Englishman. It'll be bad for him  to annoy you.\"    Helen thrilled with the depth of meaning in the low voice. Fate surely  was weaving a bond between her and this borderman. She felt it in his  steady, piercing gaze; in her own tingling blood.    Then as her natural courage dispelled all girlish fears, she faced  him, white, resolute, with a look in her eyes that matched his own.    \"I will do what I can,\" she said.          CHAPTER VII    Westward from Fort Henry, far above the eddying river, Jonathan Zane  slowly climbed a narrow, hazel-bordered, mountain trail. From time to  time he stopped in an open patch among the thickets and breathed deep  of the fresh, wood-scented air, while his keen gaze swept over the  glades near by, along the wooded hillsides, and above at the  timber-strewn woodland.    This June morning in the wild forest was significant of nature's  brightness and joy. Broad-leaved poplars, dense foliaged oaks, and  vine-covered maples shaded cool, mossy banks, while between the trees  the sunshine streamed in bright spots. It shone silver on the glancing  silver-leaf, and gold on the colored leaves of the butternut tree.  Dewdrops glistened on the ferns; ripples sparkled in the brooks;  spider-webs glowed with wondrous rainbow hues, and the flower of the  forest, the sweet, pale-faced daisy, rose above the green like a  white star.    Yellow birds flitted among the hazel bushes caroling joyously, and  cat-birds sang gaily. Robins called; bluejays screeched in the tall,  white oaks; wood-peckers hammered in the dead hard-woods, and crows  cawed overhead. Squirrels chattered everywhere. Ruffed grouse rose  with great bustle and a whirr, flitting like brown flakes through the  leaves. From far above came the shrill cry of a hawk, followed by the  wilder scream of an eagle.    Wilderness music such as all this fell harmoniously on the borderman's  ear. It betokened the gladsome spirit of his wild friends, happy in  the warm sunshine above, or in the cool depths beneath the fluttering  leaves, and everywhere in those lonely haunts unalarmed and free.    Familiar to Jonathan, almost as the footpath near his home, was this  winding trail. On the height above was a safe rendezvous, much  frequented by him and Wetzel. Every lichen-covered stone, mossy bank,  noisy brook and giant oak on the way up this mountain-side, could have  told, had they spoken their secrets, stories of the bordermen. The  fragile ferns and slender-bladed grasses peeping from the gray and  amber mosses, and the flowers that hung from craggy ledges, had wisdom  to impart. A borderman lived under the green tree-tops, and,  therefore, all the nodding branches of sassafras and laurel, the  grassy slopes and rocky cliffs, the stately ash trees, kingly oaks and  dark, mystic pines, together with the creatures that dwelt among them,  save his deadly red-skinned foes, he loved. Other affection as close  and true as this, he had not known. Hearkening thus with single heart  to nature's teachings, he learned her secrets. Certain it was,  therefore, that the many hours he passed in the woods apart from  savage pursuits, were happy and fruitful.    Slowly he pressed on up the ascent, at length coming into open light  upon a small plateau marked by huge, rugged, weather-chipped stones.  On the eastern side was a rocky promontory, and close to the edge of  this cliff, an hundred feet in sheer descent, rose a gnarled, time and  tempest-twisted chestnut tree. Here the borderman laid down his rifle  and knapsack, and, half-reclining against the tree, settled himself to  rest and wait.    This craggy point was the lonely watch-tower of eagles. Here on the  highest headland for miles around where the bordermen were"]]]
