At  this moment a patrol passed by. I was obliged to sound a retreat toward  the Rue Tiquetonne; I was pursued and took refuge in the house next to  this, where I have been concealed between two mattresses. This morning I  ventured to run along the gutters and----\"    \"Well,\" interrupted D'Artagnan, \"I am delighted that De Rochefort is  free, but as for thee, if thou shouldst fall into the hands of the  king's servants they will hang thee without mercy. Nevertheless, I  promise thee thou shalt be hidden here, though I risk by concealing thee  neither more nor less than my lieutenancy, if it was found out that I  gave one rebel an asylum.\"    \"Ah! sir, you know well I would risk my life for you.\"    \"Thou mayst add that thou hast risked it, Planchet. I have not forgotten  all I owe thee. Sit down there and eat in security. I see thee cast  expressive glances at the remains of my supper.\"    \"Yes, sir; for all I've had since yesterday was a slice of bread and  butter, with preserves on it. Although I don't despise sweet things in  proper time and place, I found the supper rather light.\"    \"Poor fellow!\" said D'Artagnan. \"Well, come; set to.\"    \"Ah, sir, you are going to save my life a second time!\" cried Planchet.    And he seated himself at the table and ate as he did in the merry days  of the Rue des Fossoyeurs, whilst D'Artagnan walked to and fro and  thought how he could make use of Planchet under present circumstances.  While he turned this over in his mind Planchet did his best to make up  for lost time at table. At last he uttered a sigh of satisfaction and  paused, as if he had partially appeased his hunger.    \"Come,\" said D'Artagnan, who thought that it was now a convenient time  to begin his interrogations, \"dost thou know where Athos is?\"    \"No, sir,\" replied Planchet.    \"The devil thou dost not! Dost know where Porthos is?\"    \"No--not at all.\"    \"And Aramis?\"    \"Not in the least.\"    \"The devil! the devil! the devil!\"    \"But, sir,\" said Planchet, with a look of shrewdness, \"I know where  Bazin is.\"    \"Where is he?\"    \"At Notre Dame.\"    \"What has he to do at Notre Dame?\"    \"He is beadle.\"    \"Bazin beadle at Notre Dame! He must know where his master is!\"    \"Without a doubt he must.\"    D'Artagnan thought for a moment, then took his sword and put on his  cloak to go out.    \"Sir,\" said Planchet, in a mournful tone, \"do you abandon me thus to my  fate? Think, if I am found out here, the people of the house, who have  not seen me enter it, will take me for a thief.\"    \"True,\" said D'Artagnan. \"Let's see. Canst thou speak any patois?\"    \"I can do something better than that, sir, I can speak Flemish.\"    \"Where the devil didst thou learn it?\"    \"In Artois, where I fought for years. Listen, sir. Goeden morgen,  mynheer, eth teen begeeray le weeten the ge sond heets omstand.\"    \"Which means?\"    \"Good-day, sir! I am anxious to know the state of your health.\"    \"He calls that a language! But never mind, that will do capitally.\"    D'Artagnan opened the door and called out to a waiter to desire  Madeleine to come upstairs.    When the landlady made her appearance she expressed much astonishment at  seeing Planchet.    \"My dear landlady,\" said D'Artagnan, \"I beg to introduce to you your  brother, who is arrived from Flanders and whom I am going to take into  my service.\"    \"My brother?\"    \"Wish your sister good-morning, Master Peter.\"    \"Wilkom, suster,\" said Planchet.    \"Goeden day, broder,\" replied the astonished landlady.    \"This is the case,\" said D'Artagnan; \"this is your brother, Madeleine;  you don't know him perhaps, but I know him; he has arrived from  Amsterdam. You must dress him up during my absence. When I return, which  will be in about an hour, you must offer him to me as a servant, and  upon your recommendation, though he doesn't speak a word of French, I  take him into my service. You understand?\"    \"That is to say, I guess your wishes, and that is all that's necessary,\"  said Madeleine.    \"You are a precious creature, my pretty hostess, and I am much obliged  to you.\"    The next moment D'Artagnan was on his way to Notre Dame.          7. Touches upon the Strange Effects a Half-pistole may have.      D'Artagnan, as he crossed the Pont Neuf, congratulated himself on having  found Planchet again, for at that time an intelligent servant was  essential to him; nor was he sorry that through Planchet and the  situation which he held in Rue des Lombards, a connection with the  bourgeoisie might be commenced, at that critical period when that class  were preparing to make war with the court party. It was like having a  spy in the enemy's camp. In this frame of mind, grateful for the  accidental meeting with Planchet, pleased with himself, D'Artagnan  reached Notre Dame. He ran up the steps, entered the church, and  addressing a verger who was sweeping the chapel, asked him if he knew  Monsieur Bazin.    \"Monsieur Bazin, the beadle?\" said the verger. \"Yes. There he is,  attending mass, in the chapel of the Virgin.\"    D'Artagnan nearly jumped for joy; he had despaired of finding Bazin, but  now, he thought, since he held one end of the thread he would be pretty  sure to reach the other end.    He knelt down just opposite the chapel in order not to lose sight of his  man; and as he had almost forgotten his prayers and had omitted to take  a book with him, he made use of his time in gazing at Bazin.    Bazin wore his dress, it may be observed, with equal dignity and saintly  propriety. It was not difficult to understand that he had gained the  crown of his ambition and that the silver-mounted wand he brandished was  in his eyes as honorable a distinction as the marshal's baton which  Conde threw, or did not throw, into the enemy's line of battle at  Fribourg. His person had undergone a change, analogous to the change in  his dress; his figure had grown rotund and, as it were, canonical. The  striking points of his face were effaced; he had still a nose, but his  cheeks, fattened out, each took a portion of it unto themselves; his  chin had joined his throat; his eyes were swelled up with the puffiness  of his cheeks; his hair, cut straight in holy guise, covered his  forehead as far as his eyebrows.    The officiating priest was just finishing mass whilst D'Artagnan was  looking at Bazin; he pronounced the words of the holy Sacrament and  retired, giving the benediction, which was received by the kneeling  communicants, to the astonishment of D'Artagnan, who recognized in the  priest the coadjutor* himself, the famous Jean Francois Gondy, who at  that time, having a presentiment of the part he was to play, was  beginning to court popularity by almsgiving. It was to this end that he  performed from time to time some of those early masses which the common  people, generally, alone attended.        _* A sacerdotal officer._    D'Artagnan knelt as well as the rest, received his share of the  benediction and made the sign of the cross; but when Bazin passed in his  turn, with his eyes raised to Heaven and walking, in all humility, the  very last, D'Artagnan pulled him by the hem of his robe.    Bazin looked down and started, as if he had seen a serpent.    \"Monsieur d'Artagnan!\" he cried; \"Vade retro Satanas!\"    \"So, my dear Bazin!\" said the officer, laughing, \"this is the way you  receive an old friend.\"    \"Sir,\" replied Bazin, \"the true friends of a Christian are those who aid  him in working out his salvation, not those who hinder him in doing so.\"    \"I don't understand you, Bazin; nor can I see how I can be a  stumbling-block in the way of your salvation,\" said D'Artagnan.    \"You forget, sir, that you very nearly ruined forever that of my master;  and that it was owing to you that he was very nearly being damned  eternally for remaining a musketeer, whilst all the time his true  vocation was the church.\"    \"My dear Bazin, you ought to perceive,\" said D'Artagnan, \"from the place  in which you find me, that I am greatly changed in everything. Age  produces good sense, and, as I doubt not but that your master is on the  road to salvation, I want you to tell me where he is, that he may help  me to mine.\"    \"Rather say, to take him back with you into the world. Fortunately, I  don't know where he is.\"    \"How!\" cried D'Artagnan; \"you don't know where Aramis is?\"    \"Formerly,\" replied Bazin, \"Aramis was his name of perdition. By Aramis  is meant Simara, which is the name of a demon. Happily for him he has  ceased to bear that name.\"    \"And therefore,\" said D'Artagnan, resolved to be patient to the end, \"it  is not Aramis I seek, but the Abbe d'Herblay. Come, my dear Bazin, tell  me where he is.\"    \"Didn't you hear me tell you, Monsieur d'Artagnan, that I don't know  where he is?\"    \"Yes, certainly; but to that I answer that it is impossible.\"    \"It is, nevertheless, the truth, monsieur--the pure truth, the truth of  the good God.\"    D'Artagnan saw clearly that he would get nothing out of this man, who  was evidently telling a falsehood in his pretended ignorance of the  abode of Aramis, but whose lies were bold and decided.    \"Well, Bazin,\" said D'Artagnan, \"since you do not know where your master  lives, let us speak of it no more; let us part good friends. Accept this  half-pistole to drink to my health.\"    \"I do not drink\"--Bazin pushed away with dignity the officer's  hand--\"'tis good only for the laity.\"    \"Incorruptible!\" murmured D'Artagnan; \"I am unlucky;\" and whilst he was  lost in thought Bazin retreated toward the sacristy, and even there he  could not think himself safe until he had shut and locked the door  behind him.    D'Artagnan was still in deep thought when some one touched him on the  shoulder. He turned and was about to utter an exclamation of surprise  when the other made to him a sign of silence.    \"You here,"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/12590"],[0,"The Shadow of the Rope (#13)"],[1,"is the  rather historic old seat of the family of that name; but they have so  many vastly superior and more modern places, and the last fifty years  have so ruined the surroundings, that I was able to induce the Duke to  take a price for it a year or two ago. He had hardly slept a night there  in his life, and I got it lock-stock-and-barrel for a song. The  Northborough which, you will observe, it is 'near'--a good four miles,  as a matter of fact--is the well-known centre of the Delverton  iron-trade. But you may very well have spent a year in this country  without having heard of it; they would be shocked at Northborough, but  nowhere else.\"    Rachel had dropped the card into her lap; she was looking straight at  Mr. John Buchanan Steel himself.    \"You are very rich,\" she said gravely.    \"I am nothing of the kind,\" he protested. \"The Duke is rich, if you  like, but I had to scrape together to pay him what would replenish his  racing-stud, or stand him in a new yacht.\"    But Rachel was not deceived.    \"I might have known you were very rich,\" she murmured, as much to  herself as to him; and there was a strange finality in her tone, as  though all was over between them; a still more strange regret,  involuntary, unconscious, and yet distinct.    \"Granting your hypothesis, for the sake of argument,\" he went on, with  his simplest smile; \"is it as difficult as ever for the poor rich man to  get to heaven?\"    Rachel spent some moments in serious thought. He was wonderfully honest  with her; of his central motive alone was she uncertain, unconvinced. In  all else she felt instinctively that he was telling her the truth,  telling her even more than he need. His generous candor was a challenge  to her own.    \"It may be very small of me,\" she said at length, \"but--somehow--if you  had been comparatively poor--I should have been less--ashamed!\"    And candor begot candor, as it generally will.    \"Upon my word,\" he cried, \"you make me sigh for the suburbs and six  hundred a year! But you shall know the worst. I meant you to know it  when I came in; then I changed my mind; but in for a penny, in for the  lot!\"    He caught up the magazine which he had brought in with the sheaf of  newspapers, and he handed it to Rachel, open at an article quite  excellently illustrated for an English magazine.    \"There,\" he cried, \"there's a long screed about the wretched place,  before it came into my hands. But it's no use pretending it isn't quite  the place it was. I took over the whole thing--every stick outside and  in--and I've put in new drainage and the electric light.\"    His tone of regret was intentionally ludicrous. Had Rachel been  listening, she would once more have suspected a pose. But already she  was deep in the article in the two-year-old magazine, or rather in its  not inartistic illustrations.    \"The House from the Tennis Lawn,\" \"In the Kitchen Garden,\" \"The  Drawing-room Door,\" \"A Drawing-room Chimney-piece,\" \"A Corner of the  Chinese Room,\" \"A Portion of the Grand Staircase\"--of such were the  titles underneath the process pictures. And (in all but their  production) each of these was more beautiful than the last.    \"That,\" observed Steel, \"happens to be the very article from which I  first got wind of the place, when I was looking about for one. And  now,\" he added, \"I suppose I have cut my own throat! Like the devil, I  have taken you up to a high place--\"    It was no word from Rachel that cut him short, but his own taste, with  which she at least had very little fault to find. And Rachel was  critical enough; but her experience was still unripe, and she liked his  view of his possessions, without perceiving how it disarmed her own.    Presently she looked up.    \"Now I see how much I should have to gain. But what would you gain?\"    The question was no sooner asked than Rachel foresaw the pretty speech  which was its obvious answer. Mr. Steel, however, refrained from making  it.    \"I am an oldish man,\" he said, \"and--yes, there is no use in denying  that I am comfortably off. I want a wife; or rather, my neighbors seem  bent upon finding me one; and, if the worst has to come to the worst, I  prefer to choose for myself. Matrimony, however, is about the very last  state of life that I desire, and I take it to be the same with you.  Therefore--to put the cart before the horse--you would suit me ideally.  One's own life would be unaltered, but the Delverton mothers would cease  from troubling, and at the head of my establishment there would be a  lady of whom I should be most justly proud. And even in my own life I  should, I hope, be the more than occasional gainer by her society; may I  also add, by her sympathy, by her advice? Mrs. Minchin,\" cried Steel,  with sudden feeling, \"the conditions shall be very rigid; my lawyer  shall see to that; nor shall I allow myself a loophole for any weakness  or nonsense whatsoever in the future. Old fellows like myself have made  fools of themselves before to-day, but you shall be safeguarded from the  beginning. Let there be no talk or thought of love between us from first  to last! But as for admiration, I don't mind telling you that I admire  you as I never admired any woman in the world before; and I hope, in  spite of that, we shall be friends.\"    Still the indicative mood, still not for a moment the conditional!  Rachel did not fail to make another note; but now there was nothing  bitter even in her thoughts. She believed in this man, and in his  promises; moreover, she began to focus the one thing about him in which  she disbelieved. It was his feeling towards her--nothing more and  nothing else. There he was insincere; but it was a pardonable  insincerity, after all.    Of his admiration she was convinced; it had been open and honest all  along; but there was something deeper than admiration. He could say what  he liked. The woman knew. And what could it be but love?    The woman knew; and though the tragedy of her life was so close behind  her; nay, though mystery and suspicion encompassed her still, as they  might until her death, the woman thrilled.    It was a thrill of excitement chiefly, but excitement was not the only  element. There was the personal factor, too; there was the fascination  which this man had for her, which he could exert at will, and which he  was undoubtedly exerting now.    To escape from his eyes, to think but once more for herself, and by  herself, Rachel rose at last, and looked from the window which lit this  recess.    It was the usual November day in London; no sun; a mist, but not a fog;  cabmen in capes, horses sliding on the muddy street, well-dressed women  picking their way home from church--shabby women hurrying in  shawls--hurrying as Rachel herself had done the night before--as she  might again to-night. And whither? And whither, in all the world?    Rachel turned from the window with a shudder; she caught up the first  newspaper of the sheaf upon the writing-table. Steel had moved into the  body of the room; she could not even see him through the alcove. So much  the better; she would discover for herself what they said.    Leading articles are easily found, and in a Sunday paper they are seldom  long. Rachel was soon through the first, her blood boiling; the second  she could not finish for her tears; the third dried her eyes with the  fires of fierce resentment. It was not so much what they said; it was  what they were obviously afraid to say. It was their circumlocution,  their innuendo, their mild surprise, their perfunctory congratulations,  their assumption of chivalry and their lack of its essence, that wounded  and stung the subject of these effusions. As she raised her flushed face  from the last of them, Mr. Steel stood before her once more, the  incarnation of all grave sympathy and consideration.    \"You must not think,\" said he, \"that my proposal admits of no  alternative but the miserable one of making your own way in a suspicious  and uncharitable world. On the contrary, if I am not to be your nominal  and legal husband, I still intend to be your actual friend. On the first  point you are to be consulted, but on the second not even you shall  stand in my way. Nor in that event would I attempt to rob you of the  independence which you value so highly; on the other hand, I would  point the way to an independence worth having. I am glad you have seen  those papers, though to-morrow they may be worse. Well, you may be  shocked, but, if you won't have me, the worse the better, say I! Your  case was most iniquitously commented upon before ever it came for trial;  there is sure to be a fresh crop of iniquities now; but I shall be much  mistaken if you cannot mulct the more flagrant offenders in heavy  damages for libel.\"    Rachel shivered at the thought. She was done with her case for ever and  for ever. People could think her guilty if they liked, but that the case  should breed other cases, and thus drag on and on, and, above all, that  she should make money out of all that past horror, what an unbearable  idea!    On second thoughts, Mr. Steel agreed.    \"Then you must let me send you back to Australia.\" No, no, no; she could  never show her face there again, or anywhere else where she was known.  She must begin life afresh, that was evident.    \"It was evident to me,\" said Steel, quietly, \"though not more so than  the injustice of it, from the very beginning. Hence the plans and  proposals that I have put before you.\"    Rachel regarded him wildly; the Sunday papers had driven her to  desperation, as, perhaps, it was intended that they should.    \"Are you sure,\" she cried, \"that they would not know me--up north?\"    \"Not from Eve,\" he answered airily. \"I should see to that; and, besides,  we should first travel, say until the summer.\"    \"If only I _could_ begin my life again!\" said Rachel to herself, but  aloud, in a way that made no secret of her last, most desperate  inclination.    \"That is "]]]
