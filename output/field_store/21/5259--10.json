EXPLANATION (FROM JOURNAL).    IT is necessary to premise by way of explanation, that in this Journal  (except while we lay at George's Island) the day is supposed to begin and  end at noon, as for instance, Friday the 27th May, began at noon on  Thursday 26th, and ended the following noon according to the natural day,  and all the courses and bearings are the true courses and bearings  according to the Globe, and not by Compass. The longitude is counted West  from the meridian of Greenwich where no other place is particularly  mentioned. The proportional length of the log-line to the half minute  glass, by which the ships run was measured, is as thirty seconds is to  thirty feet.    While the ship lay in port or was coasting in sight of land, or sailing  in narrow seas, this Journal is not kept in the usual form, but the  degrees of Latitude and Longitude the ship passes over are put down at  the top of each page, by which together with the notes in the margin* an  easy reference will be had to the Chart. (* These notes in the margin  have not been printed. ED.)      CHAPTER 1. ENGLAND TO RIO JANEIRO.    REMARKABLE OCCURRENCES ON BOARD HIS MAJESTY'S BARK ENDEAVOUR.    1768.

The transactions of Each Day, both while we  lay here and at Deptford, are inserted in the Log Book, and as they  contain nothing but common Occurrences, it was thought not necessary to  insert them here.
