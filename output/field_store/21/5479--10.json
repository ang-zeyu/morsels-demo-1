This fact  seems susceptible of being accounted for on historical grounds.  Mahometanism is in fact a sect or heresy of Christianity. The views  and sentiments, the aggregate of which make up the body of Christian  opinion, are not all of Jewish or Christian origin. They are the moral  creed of societies whose opinions and civilization have been derived  in part from other sources. The philosophy of Greece and the law of  Rome have contributed in nearly equal proportions to the theosophy  of the Hebrews. The jurisprudence of all Christian nations is mainly  referable to Rome for its origin, and the same is the case with at  least the Sunnite Mahometans. The nations of Islam took only their  religious creed from their Prophet; the jurists of Kufah retained and  expounded the civil law which prevailed among them before his time.  That law was the law of the Greek Empire, developed in the same way as  that of the Western Empire under the judicial and legislative auspices  of Roman Praetors and Pro-Consuls, aided by Roman jurists. Theophilus,  one of the jurists employed by Justinian for his compilations,  lectured in Greek on the Institutions; and the substance of  his lectures still survives under the name of the Paraphrase of  Theophilus. The Greek edicts and novels of Justinian's successors are  mainly Roman law. Throughout the Byzantine Empire (within which Kufah  and the region where Bagdad now stands were included) Roman law was  paramount, and Roman jurists were numerous. The arrangement, the  subdivisions, and the substance of Mahometan jurisprudence, show  that it has been principally derived from this source. Some of its  doctrines are doubtless aboriginal engrafted on the law of the  Empire; and it has been modified in some respects to reconcile it to  the religious dictates of Islam, just as the law of Pagan Rome was  modified after Christianity became the religion of the Empire. But  still Mahometan jurisprudence retains undeniably the lineaments of its  parentage.    This consideration places in a strong light the importance of the  study of Mahometan law. The increasing intimacy of our relations with  independent Mahometan states makes it of the utmost consequence that  we should entertain correct views of their opinions and institutions;  and no better key to the knowledge of both can be found than in the  historical study of their law. Again, we are called upon to legislate  and supply judges for British India, a large proportion of the  inhabitants of which are Mahometans. Even the Hindoos of the former  Mogul Empire have adopted many legal forms and doctrines from  their conquerors. A minute and accurate acquaintance with Mahometan  jurisprudence is an indispensable preliminary to judicious legislation  for British India. For these reasons, it could be wished that Mr.  Baillie, or some other equally accomplished laborer in that field,  would set himself to do for the \"Futawa Alumgeeree\" what Heineccius  and other modern civilians have done for the law-books of  Justinian--present the European public with an elegant and exact  abstract of its contents.           *       *       *       *       *    The following, from Southey's \"Gridiron,\" now first published in his  Memoirs, ought to be set to music for the Beef-Steak Club:--      \"Now the perfect Steak prepare!

A FREE TRANSLATION FROM THE GERMAN.    PART II--CONCLUSION    (CONCLUDED FROM PAGE 192.)    Several weeks passed away. Edward spared no pains to discover  some trace of the lady in question, but all in vain. No one in the  neighborhood knew the family; and he had already determined, as  soon as the spring began, to ask for leave of absence, and to travel  through the country where Ferdinand had formed his unfortunate  attachment, when a circumstance occurred which coincided strangely  with his wishes. His commanding-officer gave him a commission to  purchase some horses, which, to his great consolation, led him exactly  into that part of the country where Ferdinand had been quartered.  It was a market-town of some importance. He was to remain there some  time, which suited his plans exactly; and he made use of every leisure  hour to cultivate the acquaintance of the officers, to inquire into  Ferdinand's connections and acquaintance, to trace the mysterious name  if possible, and thus fulfill a sacred duty. For to him it appeared a  sacred duty to execute the commission of his departed friend--to get  possession of the ring, and to be the means, as he hoped, of giving  rest to the troubled spirit of Ferdinand.    Already, on the evening of the second day, he was sitting in the  coffee-room with burghers of the place and officers of different  regiments.    A newly-arrived cornet was inquiring whether the neighborhood were a  pleasant one, of an infantry officer, one of Hallberg's corps. \"For,\"  said he, \"I come from charming quarters.\"    \"There is not much to boast of,\" replied the captain. \"There is no  good fellowship, no harmony among the people.\"    \"I will tell you why that is,\" cried an animated lieutenant; \"that is  because there is no house as a point of reunion, where one is sure  to find and make acquaintances, and to be amused, and where each  individual ascertains his own merits by the effect they produce on  society at large.\"    \"Yes, we have had nothing of that kind since the Varniers left us,\"  said the captain.    \"Varniers!\" cried Edward, with an eagerness he could ill conceal. \"The  name sounds foreign.\"    \"They were not Germans--they were emigrants from the Netherlands, who  had left their country on account of political troubles,\" replied the  captain.    \"Ah, that was a charming house,\" cried the lieutenant, \"cultivation,  refinement, a sufficient competency, the whole style of establishment  free from ostentation, yet most comfortable; and Emily--Emily was the  soul of the whole house.\"    \"Emily Varnier!\" echoed Edward, while his heart beat fast and loud.    \"Yes, yes! that was the name of the prettiest, most graceful, most  amiable girl in the world,\" said the lieutenant.    \"You seem bewitched by the fair Emily,\" observed the cornet.    \"I think you would have been too, had you known her,\" rejoined the  lieutenant; \"she was the jewel of the whole society. Since she went  away there is no bearing their stupid balls and assemblies.\"    \"But you must not forget,\" the captain resumed once more, \"when you  attribute everything to the charms of the fair girl, that not only  she but the whole family has disappeared, and we have lost that  house which formed, as you say, so charming a point of reunion in our  neighborhood.\"    \"Yes, yes; exactly so,\" said an old gentleman, a civilian, who had  been silent hitherto; \"the Varniers' house is a great loss in the  country, where such losses are not so easily replaced as in a large  town. First, the father died, then came the cousin and carried the  daughter away.\"    \"And did this cousin marry the young lady?\" inquired Edward, in a tone  tremulous with agitation.    \"Certainly,\" answered the old gentleman; \"it was a very great match  for her; he bought land to the value of half a million about here.\"    \"And he was an agreeable, handsome man, we must all allow,\" remarked  the captain.    \"But she would never have married him,\" exclaimed the lieutenant, \"if  poor Hallberg had not died.\"    Edward was breathless, but he did not speak a word.    \"She would have been compelled to do so in any case,\" said the old  man; \"the father had destined them for each other from infancy,  and people say he made his daughter take a vow as he lay on his  death-bed.\"    \"That sounds terrible,\" said Edward; \"and does not speak much for the  good feeling of the cousin.\"    \"She could not have fulfilled her father's wish,\" interposed the  lieutenant; \"her heart was bound up in Hallberg, and Hallberg's in  her. Few people, perhaps, know this, for the lovers were prudent and  discreet; I, however, knew it all.\"    \"And why was she not allowed to follow the inclination of her heart?\"  asked Edward.    \"Because her father had promised her,\" replied the captain: \"you used  just now the word terrible; it is a fitting expression, according to  my version of the matter. It appears that one of the branches of the  house of Varnier had committed an act of injustice toward another, and  Emily's father considered it a point of conscience to make reparation.  Only through the marriage of his daughter with a member of the  ill-used branch could that act be obliterated and made up for, and,  therefore, he pressed the matter sorely.\"    \"Yes, and the headlong passion which Emily inspired her cousin with  abetted his designs.\"    \"Then her cousin loved Emily?\" inquired Edward.    \"Oh, to desperation,\" was the reply. \"He was a rival to her shadow,  who followed her not more closely than he did. He was jealous of the  rose that she placed on her bosom.\"    \"Then poor Emily is not likely to have a calm life with such a man,\"  said Edward.    \"Come,\" interposed the old gentleman, with en authoritative tone, \"I  think you, gentlemen, go a little too far. I know D'Effernay; he is an  honest, talented man, very rich, indeed, and generous; he anticipates  his wife "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/13821"],[0,"Tales of Wonder (#13)"],[1,"  In those three days he did five hundred miles; then the wind dropped  to a breeze though it still blew from the North, and for a week they  did no more than two knots an hour. The merry men began to murmur  then. Luck had distinctly favoured Shard at first for it sent him at  ten knots through the only populous districts well ahead of crowds  except those who chose to run, and the cavalry were away on a local  raid. As for the runners they soon dropped off when Shard pointed his  cannon though he did not dare to fire, up there near the coast; for  much as he jeered at the intelligence of the English and Spanish  Admirals in not suspecting his manoeuvre, the only one as he said that  was possible in the circumstances, yet he knew that cannon had an  obvious sound which would give his secret away to the weakest mind.  Certainly luck had befriended him, and when it did so no longer he  made out of the occasion all that could be made; for instance while  the wind held good he had never missed opportunities to revictual, if  he passed by a village its pigs and poultry were his, and whenever he  passed by water he filled his tanks to the brim, and now that he could  only do two knots he sailed all night with a man and a lantern before  him: thus in that week he did close on four hundred miles while  another man would have anchored at night and have missed five or six  hours out of the twenty-four. Yet his men murmured. Did he think the  wind would last for ever, they said. And Shard only smoked. It was  clear that he was thinking, and thinking hard. \"But what is he  thinking about?\" said Bill to Bad Jack. And Bad Jack answered: \"He may  think as hard as he likes but thinking won't get us out of the Sahara  if this wind were to drop.\"    And towards the end of that week Shard went to his chart-room and laid  a new course for his ship a little to the East and towards  cultivation. And one day towards evening they sighted a village, and  twilight came and the wind dropped altogether. Then the murmurs of the  merry men grew to oaths and nearly to mutiny. \"Where were they now?\"  they asked, and were they being treated like poor honest men?    Shard quieted them by asking what they wished to do themselves and  when no one had any better plan than going to the villagers and saying  that they had been blown out of their course by a storm, Shard  unfolded his scheme to them. Long ago he had heard how they drove  carts with oxen in Africa, oxen were very numerous in these parts  wherever there was any cultivation, and for this reason when the wind  had begun to drop he had laid his course for the village: that night  the moment it was dark they were to drive off fifty yoke of oxen; by  midnight they must all be yoked to the bows and then away they would  go at a good round gallop.    So fine a plan as this astonished the men and they all apologised for  their want of faith in Shard, shaking hands with him every one and  spitting on their hands before they did so in token of good will.    The raid that night succeeded admirably, but ingenious as Shard was on  land, and a past-master at sea, yet it must be admitted that lack of  experience in this class of seamanship led him to make a mistake, a  slight one it is true, and one that a little practice would have  prevented altogether: the oxen could not gallop. Shard swore at them,  threatened them with his pistol, said they should have no food, and  all to no avail: that night and as long as they pulled the bad ship  Desperate Lark they did one knot an hour and no more. Shard's failures  like everything that came his way were used as stones in the edifice  of his future success, he went at once to his chart-room and worked  out all his calculations anew.    The matter of the oxen's pace made pursuit impossible to avoid. Shard  therefore countermanded his order to his lieutenant to cover the  tracks in the sand, and the Desperate Lark plodded on into the Sahara  on her new course trusting to her guns.    The village was not a large one and the little crowd that was sighted  astern next morning disappeared after the first shot from the cannon  in the stern. At first Shard made the oxen wear rough iron bits,  another of his mistakes, and strong bits too. \"For if they run away,\"  he had said, \"we might as well be driving before a gale and there's no  saying where we'd find ourselves,\" but after a day or two he found  that the bits were no good and, like the practical man he was,  immediately corrected his mistake.    And now the crew sang merry songs all day bringing out mandolins and  clarionets and cheering Captain Shard. All were jolly except the  captain himself whose face was moody and perplexed; he alone expected  to hear more of those villagers; and the oxen were drinking up the  water every day, he alone feared that there was no more to be had, and  a very unpleasant fear that is when your ship is becalmed in a desert.  For over a week they went on like this doing ten knots a day and the  music and singing got on the captain's nerves, but he dared not tell  his men what the trouble was. And then one day the oxen drank up the  last of the water. And Lieutenant Smerdrak came and reported the fact.    \"Give them rum,\" said Shard, and he cursed the oxen. \"What is good  enough for me,\" he said, \"should be good enough for them,\" and he  swore that they should have rum.    \"Aye, aye, sir,\" said the young lieutenant of pirates.    Shard should not be judged by the orders he gave that day, for nearly  a fortnight he had watched the doom that was coming slowly towards  him, discipline cut him off from anyone that might have shared his  fear and discussed it, and all the while he had had to navigate his  ship, which even at sea is an arduous responsibility. These things had  fretted the calm of that clear judgment that had once baffled five  navies. Therefore he cursed the oxen and ordered them rum, and  Smerdrak had said \"Aye, aye, sir,\" and gone below.    Towards sunset Shard was standing on the poop, thinking of death; it  would not come to him by thirst; mutiny first, he thought. The oxen  were refusing rum for the last time, and the men were beginning to eye  Captain Shard in a very ominous way, not muttering, but each man  looking at him with a sidelong look of the eye as though there were  only one thought among them all that had no need of words. A score of  geese like a long letter \"V\" were crossing the evening sky, they  slanted their necks and all went twisting downwards somewhere about  the horizon. Captain Shard rushed to his chart-room, and presently the  men came in at the door with Old Frank in front looking awkward and  twisting his cap in his hand.    \"What is it?\" said Shard as though nothing were wrong.    Then Old Frank said what he had come to say: \"We want to know what you  be going to do.\"    And the men nodded grimly.    \"Get water for the oxen,\" said Captain Shard, \"as the swine won't have  rum, and they'll have to work for it, the lazy beasts. Up anchor!\"    And at the word water a look came into their faces like when some  wanderer suddenly thinks of home.    \"Water!\" they said.    \"Why not?\" said Captain Shard. And none of them ever knew that but for  those geese, that slanted their necks and suddenly twisted downwards,  they would have found no water that night nor ever after, and the  Sahara would have taken them as she has taken so many and shall take  so many more. All that night they followed their new course: at dawn  they found an oasis and the oxen drank.    And here, on this green acre or so with its palm-trees and its well,  beleaguered by thousands of miles of desert and holding out through  the ages, here they decided to stay: for those who have been without  water for a while in one of Africa's deserts come to have for that  simple fluid such a regard as you, O reader, might not easily credit.  And here each man chose a site where he would build his hut, and  settle down, and marry perhaps, and even forget the sea; when Captain  Shard having filled his tanks and barrels peremptorily ordered them to  weigh anchor. There was much dissatisfaction, even some grumbling, but  when a man has twice saved his fellows from death by the sheer  freshness of his mind they come to have a respect for his judgment  that is not shaken by trifles. It must be remembered that in the  affair of the dropping of the wind and again when they ran out of  water these men were at their wits' end: so was Shard on the last  occasion, but that they did not know. All this Shard knew, and he  chose this occasion to strengthen the reputation that he had in the  minds of the men of that bad ship by explaining to them his motives,  which usually he kept secret. The oasis he said must be a port of call  for all the travellers within hundreds of miles: how many men did you  see gathered together in any part of the world where there was a drop  of whiskey to be had! And water here was rarer than whiskey in decent  countries and, such was the peculiarity of the Arabs, even more  precious. Another thing he pointed out to them, the Arabs were a  singularly inquisitive people and if they came upon a ship in the  desert they would probably talk about it; and the world having a  wickedly malicious tongue would never construe in its proper light  their difference with the English and Spanish fleets, but would merely  side with the strong against the weak.    And the men sighed, and sang the capstan song and hoisted the anchor  and yoked the oxen up, and away they went doing their steady knot,  which nothing could increase. It may be thought strange that with all  sail furled in dead calm and while the oxen rested they should have  cast anchor at all. But custom is not easily overcome and long  survives its use. Rather enquire how many such useless customs we  ourselves preserve: the flaps for instance to pull up the tops of  hunting-boots though the tops no longer pull up, the bows on "]]]
