Of clerks there  were present fourscore, gentle and honourable men, clad in grey cloaks  bordered with sable. Of knights there were full five hundred, mounted  on bay, sorrel, or white-spotted steeds. There were so many burghers and  dames that no one could tell the number of them. The King and his son  galloped and rode on till they saw and recognised each other. They both  jump down from their horses and embrace and greet each other for a long  time, without stirring from the place where they first met. Each party  wished the other joy: the King makes much of Erec, but all at once  breaks off to turn to Enide. On all sides he is in clover: he embraces  and kisses them both, and knows not which of the two pleases him the  more. As they gaily enter the castle, the bells all ring their peals to  honour Erec's arrival. The streets are all strewn with reeds, mint, and  iris, and are hung overhead with curtains and tapestries of fancy silk  and satin stuffs. There was great rejoicing; for all the people came  together to see their new lord, and no one ever saw greater happiness  than was shown alike by young and old. First they came to the church,  where very devoutly they were received in a procession. Erec kneeled  before the altar of the Crucifix, and two knights led his wife to the  image of Our Lady. When she had finished her prayer, she stepped back  a little and crossed herself with her right hand, as a well-bred dame  should do. Then they came out from the church and entered the royal  palace, when the festivity began. That day Erec received many presents  from the knights and burghers: from one a palfrey of northern stock, and  from another a golden cup. One presents him with a golden pigeon-hawk,  another with a setter-dog, this one a greyhound, this other a  sparrowhawk, and another a swift Arab steed, this one a shield, this one  an ensign, this one a sword, and this a helmet. Never was a king more  gladly seen in his kingdom, nor received with greater joy, as all strove  to serve him well. Yet greater joy they made of Enide than of him, for  the great beauty which they saw in her, and still more for her open  charm. She was seated in a chamber upon a cushion of brocade which had  been brought from Thessaly. Round about her was many a fair lady; yet as  the lustrous gem outshines the brown flint, and as the rose excels the  poppy, so was Enide fairer than any other lady or damsel to be found in  the world, wherever one might search. She was so gentle and honourable,  of wise speech and affable, of pleasing character and kindly mien. No  one could ever be so watchful as to detect in her any folly, or sign of  evil or villainy. She had been so schooled in good manners that she had  learned all virtues which any lady can possess, as well as generosity  and knowledge. All loved her for her open heart, and whoever could do  her any service was glad and esteemed himself the more. No one spoke any  ill of her, for no one could do so. In the realm or empire there was no  lady of such good manners. But Erec loved her with such a tender love  that he cared no more for arms, nor did he go to tournaments, nor have  any desire to joust; but he spent his time in cherishing his wife. He  made of her his mistress and his sweetheart. He devoted all his heart  and mind to fondling and kissing her, and sought no delight in other  pastime. His friends grieved over this, and often regretted among  themselves that he was so deep in love. Often it was past noon before  he left her side; for there he was happy, say what they might. He rarely  left her society, and yet he was as open-handed as ever to his knights  with arms, dress, and money. There was not a tournament anywhere to  which he did not send them well apparelled and equipped. Whatever the  cost might be, he gave them fresh steeds for the tourney and joust. All  the knights said it was a great pity and misfortune that such a valiant  man as he was wont to be should no longer wish to bear arms. He was  blamed so much on all sides by the knights and squires that murmurs  reached Enide's ears how that her lord had turned craven about arms  and deeds of chivalry, and that his manner of life was greatly changed.  [126] She grieved sorely over this, but she did not dare to show her  grief; for her lord at once would take affront, if she should speak to  him. So the matter remained a secret, until one morning they lay in bed  where they had had sport together. There they lay in close embrace, like  the true lovers they were. He was asleep, but she was awake, thinking  of what many a man in the country was saying of her lord. And when she  began to think it all over, she could not keep back the tears. Such  was her grief and her chagrin that by mischance she let fall a word for  which she later felt remorse, though in her heart there was no guile.  She began to survey her lord from head to foot, his well-shaped body and  his clear countenance, until her tears fell fast upon the bosom of her  lord, and she said: \"Alas, woe is me that I ever left my country! What  did I come here to seek? The earth ought by right to swallow me up when  the best knight, the most hardy, brave, fair, and courteous that ever  was a count or king, has completely abjured all his deeds of chivalry  because of me. And thus, in truth, it is I who have brought shame upon  his head, though I would fain not have done so at any price.\" Then she  said to him: \"Unhappy thou!\" And then kept silence and spoke no more.  Erec was not sound asleep and, though dozing, heard plainly what she  said. He aroused at her words, and much surprised to see her weeping, he  asked her: \"Tell me, my precious beauty, why do you weep thus? What has  caused you woe or sorrow? Surely it is my wish to know. Tell me now,  my gentle sweetheart; and raise care to keep nothing back, why you said  that woe was me? For you said it of me and of no one else. I heard your  words plainly enough.\" Then was Enide in a great plight, afraid and  dismayed. \"Sire,\" says she, \"I know nothing of what you say.\" \"Lady, why  do you conceal it? Concealment is of no avail. You hare been crying; I  can see that, and you do not cry for nothing. And in my sleep I heard  what you said.\" \"Ah! fair sire, you never heard it, and I dare say it  was a dream.\" \"Now you are coming to me with lies. I hear you calmly  lying to me. But if you do not tell me the truth now, you will come to  repent of it later.\" \"Sire, since you torment me thus, I will tell you  the whole truth, and keep nothing back. But I am afraid that you will  not like it. In this land they all say--the dark, the fair, and the  ruddy--that it is a great pity that you should renounce your arms; your  reputation has suffered from it. Every one used to say not long ago that  in all the world there was known no better or more gallant knight.  Now they all go about making game of you--old and young, little and  great--calling you a recreant. Do you suppose it does not give me pain  to hear you thus spoken of with scorn? It grieves me when I hear it  said, and yet it grieves me more that they put the blame for it on me.  Yes, I am blamed for it, I regret to say, and they all assert it is  because I have so ensnared and caught you that you are losing all your  merit, and do not care for aught but me. You must choose another course,  so that you may silence this reproach and regain your former fame; for I  have heard too much of this reproach, and yet I did not dare to disclose  it to you. Many a time, when I think of it, I have to weep for very  grief. Such chagrin I felt just now that I could not keep myself from  saying that you were ill-starred.\" \"Lady,\" said he, \"you were in the  right, and those who blame me do so with reason. And now at once prepare  yourself to take the road. Rise up from here, and dress yourself in your  richest robe, and order your saddle to be put on your best palfrey.\" Now  Enide is in great distress: very sad and pensive, she gets up, blaming  and upbraiding herself for the foolish words she spoke: she had now  made her bed, and must lie in it. \"Ah!\" said she, \"poor fool! I was too  happy, for there lacked me nothing. God! why was I so forward as to dare  to utter such folly? God! did not my lord love me to excess? In faith,  alas, he was too fond of me. And now I must go away into exile. But I  have yet a greater grief, that I shall no longer see my lord, who loved  me with such tenderness that there was nothing he held so dear. The best  man that was ever born had become so wrapped up in me that he cared for  nothing else. I lacked for nothing then. I was very happy. But pride  it is that stirred me up: because of my pride, I must suffer woe for  telling him such insulting words, and it is right that I should suffer  woe. One does not know what good fortune is until he has made trial of  evil.\" Thus the lady bemoaned her fate, while she dressed herself fitly  in her richest robe. Yet nothing gave her any pleasure, but rather cause  for deep chagrin. Then she had a maid call one of her squires, and bids  him saddle her precious palfrey of northern stock, than which no count  or king ever had a better. As soon as she had given him the command, the  fellow asked for no delay, but straightway went and saddled the dappled  palfrey. And Erec summoned another squire and bade him bring his arms to  arm his body withal. Then he went up into a bower, and had a Limoges rug  laid out before him on the floor. Meanwhile, the squire ran to fetch the  arms and came back and laid them on the rug. Erec took a seat opposite,  on the figure of a leopard which was portrayed on the rug. He prepares  and gets ready to put on his arms: first, he had laced on a pair of  greaves of polished steel; next, he dons a hauberk, which was so fine  that not a mesh could be cut away from it. This hauberk of his was rich,  indeed, for neither inside nor"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/832"],[0,"Robin Hood (#12)"],[1," body, good sir,\" replied the other sadly; \"but my spirit is  grievously changed.\"    \"Tell me your tale,\" said Robin courteously. \"Belike I can help you.\"    \"That can no man on earth, I fear,\" said the stranger; \"nathless, I'll  tell you the tale. Yesterday I stood pledged to a maid, and thought  soon to wed her. But she has been taken from me and is to become an  old knight's bride this very day; and as for me, I care not what ending  comes to my days, or how soon, without her.\"    \"Marry, come up!\" said Robin; \"how got the old knight so sudden  vantage?\"    \"Look you, worship, 'tis this way. The Normans overrun us, and are in  such great favor that none may say them nay. This old returned Crusader  coveted the land whereon my lady dwells. The estate is not large, but  all in her own right; whereupon her brother says she shall wed a title,  and he and the old knight have fixed it up for to-day.\"    \"Nay, but surely--\" began Robin.    \"Hear me out, worship,\" said the other. \"Belike you think me a sorry  dog not to make fight of this. But the old knight, look you, is not  come-at-able. I threw one of his varlets into a thorn hedge, and another  into a water-butt, and a third landed head-first into a ditch. But I  couldn't do any fighting at all.\"    \"'Tis a pity!\" quoth Little John gravely. He had been sitting  cross-legged listening to this tale of woe. \"What think you, Friar Tuck,  doth not a bit of fighting ease a man's mind?\"    \"Blood-letting is ofttimes recommended of the leeches,\" replied Tuck.    \"Does the maid love you?\" asked Robin Hood.    \"By our troth, she loved me right well,\" said the minstrel. \"I have a  little ring of hers by me which I have kept for seven long years.\"    \"What is your name?\" then said Robin Hood.    \"By the faith of my body,\" replied the young man, \"my name is  Allan-a-Dale.\"    \"What will you give me, Allan-a-Dale,\" said Robin Hood, \"in ready gold  or fee, to help you to your true love again, and deliver her back unto  you?\"    \"I have no money, save only five shillings,\" quoth Allan; \"but--are you  not Robin Hood?\"    Robin nodded.    \"Then you, if any one, can aid me!\" said Allan-a-Dale eagerly. \"And if  you give me back my love, I swear upon the Book that I will be your true  servant forever after.\"    \"Where is this wedding to take place, and when?\" asked Robin.    \"At Plympton Church, scarce five miles from here; and at three o' the  afternoon.\"    \"Then to Plympton we will go!\" cried Robin suddenly springing into  action; and he gave out orders like a general: \"Will Stutely, do you  have four-and-twenty good men over against Plympton Church 'gainst three  o' the afternoon. Much, good fellow, do you cook up some porridge for  this youth, for he must have a good round stomach--aye, and a better  gear! Will Scarlet, you will see to decking him out bravely for the  nonce. And Friar Tuck, hold yourself in readiness, good book in hand, at  the church. Mayhap you had best go ahead of us all.\"    The fat Bishop of Hereford was full of pomp and importance that day at  Plympton Church. He was to celebrate the marriage of an old knight--a  returned Crusader--and a landed young woman; and all the gentry  thereabout were to grace the occasion with their presence. The church  itself was gaily festooned with flowers for the ceremony, while out  in the church-yard at one side brown ale flowed freely for all the  servitors.    Already were the guests beginning to assemble, when the Bishop, back in  the vestry, saw a minstrel clad in green walk up boldly to the door and  peer within. It was Robin Hood, who had borrowed Allan's be-ribboned  harp for the time.    \"Now who are you, fellow?\" quoth the Bishop, \"and what do you here at  the church-door with you harp and saucy air?\"    \"May it please your Reverence,\" returned Robin bowing very humbly, \"I  am but a strolling harper, yet likened the best in the whole North  Countree. And I had hope that my thrumming might add zest to the wedding  to-day.\"    \"What tune can you harp?\" demanded the Bishop.    \"I can harp a tune so merry that a forlorn lover will forget he is  jilted,\" said Robin. \"I can harp another tune that will make a bride  forsake her lord at the altar. I can harp another tune that will bring  loving souls together though they were up hill and down dale five good  miles away from each other.\"    \"Then welcome, good minstrel,\" said the Bishop, \"music pleases me right  well, and if you can play up to your prattle, 'twill indeed grace your  ceremony. Let us have a sample of your wares.\"    \"Nay, I must not put finger to string until the bride and groom have  come. Such a thing would ill fortune both us and them.\"    \"Have it as you will,\" said the Bishop, \"but here comes the party now.\"    Then up the lane to the church came the old knight, preceded by ten  archers liveried in scarlet and gold. A brave sight the archers made,  but their master walked slowly leaning upon a cane and shaking as though  in a palsy.    And after them came a sweet lass leaning upon her brother's arm. Her  hair did shine like glistering gold, and her eyes were like blue violets  that peep out shyly at the sun. The color came and went in her cheeks  like that tinting of a sea-shell, and her face was flushed as though  she had been weeping. But now she walked with a proud air, as though she  defied the world to crush her spirit. She had but two maids with her,  finikin lasses, with black eyes and broad bosoms, who set off their  lady's more delicate beauty well. One held up the bride's gown from the  ground; the other carried flowers in plenty.    \"Now by all the wedding bells that ever were rung!\" quoth Robin boldly,  \"this is the worst matched pair that ever mine eyes beheld!\"    \"Silence, miscreant!\" said a man who stood near.    The Bishop had hurriedly donned his gown and now stood ready to meet the  couple at the chancel.    But Robin paid no heed to him. He let the knight and his ten archers  pass by, then he strode up to the bride, and placed himself on the other  side from her brother.    \"Courage, lady!\" he whispered, \"there is another minstrel near, who  mayhap may play more to your liking.\"    The lady glanced at him with a frightened air, but read such honesty and  kindness in his glance that she brightened and gave him a grateful look.    \"Stand aside, fool!\" cried the brother wrathfully.    \"Nay, but I am to bring good fortune to the bride by accompanying her  through the church-doors,\" said Robin laughing.    Thereupon he was allowed to walk by her side unmolested, up to the  chancel with the party.    \"Now strike up your music, fellow!\" ordered the Bishop.    \"Right gladly will I,\" quoth Robin, \"an you will let me choose my  instrument. For sometimes I like the harp, and other times I think the  horn makes the merriest music in all the world.\"    And he drew forth his bugle from underneath his green cloak and blew  three winding notes that made the church--rafters ring again.    \"Seize him!\" yelled the Bishop; \"there's mischief afoot! These are the  tricks of Robin Hood!\"    The ten liveried archers rushed forward from the rear of the church,  where they had been stationed. But their rush was blocked by the  onlookers who now rose from their pews in alarm and crowded the aisles.  Meanwhile Robin had leaped lightly over the chancel rail and stationed  himself in a nook by the altar.    \"Stand where you are!\" he shouted, drawing his bow, \"the first man to  pass the rail dies the death. And all ye who have come to witness a  wedding stay in your seats. We shall e'en have one, since we are come  into the church. But the bride shall choose her own swain!\"    Then up rose another great commotion at the door, and four-and-twenty  good bowmen came marching in with Will Stutely at their head. And they  seized the ten liveried archers and the bride's scowling brother and the  other men on guard and bound them prisoners.    Then in came Allan-a-Dale, decked out gaily, with Will Scarlet for best  man. And they walked gravely down the aisle and stood over against the  chancel.    \"Before a maiden weds she chooses--an the laws of good King Harry be  just ones,\" said Robin. \"Now, maiden, before this wedding continues,  whom will you have to husband?\"    The maiden answered not in words, but smiled with a glad light in her  eyes, and walked over to Allan and clasped her arms about his neck.    \"That is her true love,\" said Robin. \"Young Allan instead of the gouty  knight. And the true lovers shall be married at this time before we  depart away. Now my lord Bishop, proceed with the ceremony!\"    \"Nay, that shall not be,\" protested the Bishop; \"the banns must be cried  three times in the church. Such is the law of our land.\"    \"Come here, Little John,\" called Robin impatiently; and plucked off the  Bishop's frock from his back and put it on the yeoman.    Now the Bishop was short and fat, and Little John was long and lean.  The gown hung loosely over Little John's shoulders and came only to  his waist. He was a fine comical sight, and the people began to laugh  consumedly at him.    \"By the faith o' my body,\" said Robin, \"this cloth makes you a man.  You're the finest Bishop that ever I saw in my life. Now cry the banns.\"    So Little John clambered awkwardly into the quire, his short gown  fluttering gaily; and he called the banns for the marriage of the maid  and Allan-a-Dale once, twice, and thrice.    \"That's not enough,\" said Robin; \"your gown is so short that you must  talk longer.\"    Then Little John asked them in the church four, five, six, and seven  times.    \"Good enough!\" said Robin. \"Now belike I see a worthy friar in the back  of this church who can say a better service than ever my lord Bishop of  Hereford. My lord Bishop shall be witness and seal the papers, but do  you, good friar, bless this pair with book and candle.\"    So Friar Tuck, who all along had been back in one corner of the church,  came forward; and Allan and his maid"]]]
