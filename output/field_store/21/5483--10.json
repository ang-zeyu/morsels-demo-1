Still animated by the hope of a peaceful solution and obeying the  dictates of duty, no effort was relaxed to bring about a speedy  ending of the Cuban struggle. Negotiations to this object continued  actively with the Government of Spain, looking to the immediate  conclusion of a six months' armistice in Cuba, with a view to effect  the recognition of her people's right to independence. Besides this,  the instant revocation of the order of reconcentration was asked,  so that the sufferers, returning to their homes and aided by united  American and Spanish effort, might be put in a way to support  themselves and, by orderly resumption of the well-nigh destroyed  productive energies of the island, contribute to the restoration of  its tranquillity and well-being. Negotiations continued for some little  time at Madrid, resulting in offers by the Spanish Government which  could not but be regarded as inadequate. It was proposed to confide the  preparation of peace to the insular parliament, yet to be convened under  the autonomous decrees of November, 1897, but without impairment in any  wise of the constitutional powers of the Madrid Government, which to  that end would grant an armistice, if solicited by the insurgents, for  such time as the general in chief might see fit to fix. How and with  what scope of discretionary powers the insular parliament was expected  to set about the \"preparation\" of peace did not appear. If it were to be  by negotiation with the insurgents, the issue seemed to rest on the one  side with a body chosen by a fraction of the electors in the districts  under Spanish control, and on the other with the insurgent population  holding the interior country, unrepresented in the so-called parliament  and defiant at the suggestion of suing for peace.    Grieved and disappointed at this barren outcome of my sincere endeavors  to reach a practicable solution, I felt it my duty to remit the whole  question to the Congress. In the message of April 11, 1898,[13] I  announced that with this last overture in the direction of immediate  peace in Cuba and its disappointing reception by Spain the effort of  the Executive was brought to an end. I again reviewed the alternative  courses of action which had been proposed, concluding that the only one  consonant with international policy and compatible with our firm-set  historical traditions was intervention as a neutral to stop the war and  check the hopeless sacrifice of life, even though that resort involved  \"hostile constraint upon both the parties to the contest, as well to  enforce a truce as to guide the eventual settlement.\" The grounds  justifying that step were the interests of humanity, the duty to protect  the life and property of our citizens in Cuba, the right to check injury  to our commerce and people through the devastation of the island, and,  most important, the need of removing at once and forever the constant  menace and the burdens entailed upon our Government by the uncertainties  and perils of the situation caused by the unendurable disturbance in  Cuba. I said:      The long trial has proved that the object for which Spain has waged    the war can not be attained. The fire of insurrection may flame or may    smolder with varying seasons, but it has not been and it is plain that    it can not be extinguished by present methods. The only hope of relief    and repose from a condition which can no longer be endured is the    enforced pacification of Cuba. In the name of humanity, in the name of    civilization, in behalf of endangered American interests which give us    the right and the duty to speak and to act, the war in Cuba must stop.      In view of all this the Congress was asked to authorize and empower the  President to take measures to secure a full and final termination of  hostilities between Spain and the people of Cuba and to secure in the  island the establishment of a stable government, capable of maintaining  order and observing its international obligations, insuring peace and  tranquillity and the security of its citizens as well as our own, and  for the accomplishment of those ends to use the military and naval  forces of the United States as might be necessary, with added authority  to continue generous relief to the starving people of Cuba.    The response of the Congress, after nine days of earnest deliberation,  during which the almost unanimous sentiment of your body was developed  on every point save as to the expediency of coupling the proposed action  with a formal recognition of the Republic of Cuba as the true and lawful  government of that island--a proposition which failed of adoption--the  Congress, after conference, on the 19th of April, by a vote of 42 to 35  in the Senate and 311 to 6 in the House of Representatives, passed the  memorable joint resolution declaring--      First. That the people of the island of Cuba are, and of right ought    to be, free and independent.      Second. That it is the duty of the United States to demand, and the    Government of the United States does hereby demand, that the Government    of Spain at once relinquish its authority and government in the island    of Cuba and withdraw its land and naval forces from Cuba and Cuban    waters.      Third. That the President of the United States be, and he hereby is,    directed and empowered to use the entire land and naval forces of the    United States and to call into the actual service of the United States    the militia of the several States to such extent as may be necessary    to carry these resolutions into effect.      Fourth. That the United States hereby disclaims any disposition or    intention to exercise sovereignty, jurisdiction, or control over    said island except for the pacification thereof, and asserts its    determination when that is accomplished to leave the government and    control of the island to its people.      This resolution was approved by the Executive on the next day, April 20.  A copy was at once communicated to the Spanish minister at this capital,  who forthwith announced that his continuance in Washington had thereby  become impossible, and asked for his passports, which were given him.  He thereupon withdrew from Washington, leaving the protection of  Spanish interests in the United States to the French ambassador and the  Austro-Hungarian minister. Simultaneously with its communication to  the Spanish minister here, General Woodford, the American minister at  Madrid, was telegraphed confirmation of the text of the joint resolution  and directed to communicate it to the Government of Spain with the  formal demand that it at once relinquish its authority and government  in the island of Cuba and withdraw its forces therefrom, coupling this  demand with announcement of the intentions of this Government as to  the future of the island, in conformity with the fourth clause of the  resolution, and giving Spain until noon of April 23 to reply.    That demand, although, as above shown, officially made known to the  Spanish envoy here, was not delivered at Madrid. After the instruction  reached General Woodford on the morning of April 21, but before he could  present it, the Spanish minister of state notified him that upon the  President's approval of the joint resolution the Madrid Government,  regarding the act as \"equivalent to an evident declaration of war,\" had  ordered its minister in Washington to withdraw, thereby breaking off  diplomatic relations between the two countries and ceasing all official  communication between their respective representatives. General Woodford  thereupon demanded his passports and quitted Madrid the same day.    Spain having thus denied the demand of the United States and initiated  that complete form of rupture of relations which attends a state of war,  the executive powers authorized by the resolution were at once used by  me to meet the enlarged contingency of actual war between sovereign  states. On April 22 I proclaimed a blockade of the north coast of Cuba,  including ports on said coast between Cardenas and Bahia Honda, and the  port of Cienfuegos, on the south coast of Cuba,[14] and on the 23d I  called for volunteers to execute the purpose of the resolution.[15] By  my message of April 25 the Congress was informed of the situation, and  I recommended formal declaration of the existence of a state of war  between the United States and Spain. [16] The Congress accordingly voted  on the same day the act approved April 25, 1898, declaring the existence  of such war from and including the 21st day of April,[17] and reenacted  the provision of the resolution of April 20 directing the President  to use all the armed forces of the nation to carry that act into  effect.[18] Due notification of the existence of war as aforesaid was  given April 25 by telegraph to all the governments with which the  United States maintain relations, in order that their neutrality  might be assured during the war. The various governments responded with  proclamations of neutrality, each after its own methods. It is not among  the least gratifying incidents of the struggle that the obligations of  neutrality were impartially discharged by all, often under delicate and  difficult circumstances.

Such are the  views which, with much passionate distortion of his thin features and  wagging of his thin, goat-like beard, he poured into our ears all the  way from Southampton to Manaos.  Since landing from the boat he has  obtained some consolation from the beauty and variety of the insect and  bird life around him, for he is absolutely whole-hearted in his  devotion to science.  He spends his days flitting through the woods  with his shot-gun and his butterfly-net, and his evenings in mounting  the many specimens he has acquired.  Among his minor peculiarities are  that he is careless as to his attire, unclean in his person,  exceedingly absent-minded in his habits, and addicted to smoking a  short briar pipe, which is seldom out of his mouth.  He has been upon  several scientific expeditions in his youth (he was with Robertson in  Papua), and the life of the camp and the canoe is nothing fresh to him.    Lord John Roxton has some points in common with Professor Summerlee,  and others in which they are the very antithesis to each other.  He is  twenty years younger, but has something of the same spare, scraggy  physique.  As to his appearance, I have, as I recollect, described it  in that portion of my narrative which I have left behind me in London.  He is exceedingly neat and prim in his ways, dresses always with great  care in white drill suits and high brown mosquito-boots, and shaves at  least once a day.  Like most men of action, he is laconic in speech,  and sinks readily into his own thoughts, but he is always quick to  answer a question or join in a conversation, talking in a queer, jerky,  half-humorous fashion.  His knowledge of the world, and very especially  of South America, is surprising, and he has a whole-hearted belief in  the possibilities of our journey which is not to be dashed by the  sneers of Professor Summerlee.  He has a gentle voice and a quiet  manner, but behind his twinkling blue eyes there lurks a capacity for  furious wrath and implacable resolution, the more dangerous because  they are held in leash.  He spoke little of his own exploits in Brazil  and Peru, but it was a revelation to me to find the excitement which  was caused by his presence among the riverine natives, who looked upon  him as their champion and protector.  The exploits of the Red Chief, as  they called him, had become legends among them, but the real facts, as  far as I could learn them, were amazing enough.    These were that Lord John had found himself some years before in that  no-man's-land which is formed by the half-defined frontiers between  Peru, Brazil, and Columbia.  In this great district the wild rubber  tree flourishes, and has become, as in the Congo, a curse to the  natives which can only be compared to their forced labor under the  Spaniards upon the old silver mines of Darien.  A handful of villainous  half-breeds dominated the country, armed such Indians as would support  them, and turned the rest into slaves, terrorizing them with the most  inhuman tortures in order to force them to gather the india-rubber,  which was then floated down the river to Para.  Lord John Roxton  expostulated on behalf of the wretched victims, and received nothing  but threats and insults for his pains.  He then formally declared war  against Pedro Lopez, the leader of the slave-drivers, enrolled a band  of runaway slaves in his service, armed them, and conducted a campaign,  which ended by his killing with his own hands the notorious half-breed  and breaking down the system which he represented.    No wonder that the ginger-headed man with the silky voice and the free  and easy manners was now looked upon with deep interest upon the banks  of the great South American river, though the feelings he inspired were  naturally mixed, since the gratitude of the natives was equaled by the  resentment of those who desired to exploit them.  One useful result of  his former experiences was that he could talk fluently in the Lingoa  Geral, which is the peculiar talk, one-third Portuguese and two-thirds  Indian, which is current all over Brazil.    I have said before that Lord John Roxton was a South Americomaniac.  He  could not speak of that great country without ardor, and this ardor was  infectious, for, ignorant as I was, he fixed my attention and  stimulated my curiosity.  How I wish I could reproduce the glamour of  his discourses, the peculiar mixture of accurate knowledge and of racy  imagination which gave them their fascination, until even the  Professor's cynical and sceptical smile would gradually vanish from his  thin face as he listened.  He would tell the history of the mighty  river so rapidly explored (for some of the first conquerors of Peru  actually crossed the entire continent upon its waters), and yet so  unknown in regard to all that lay behind its ever-changing banks.    \"What is there?\" he would cry, pointing to the north.  \"Wood and marsh  and unpenetrated jungle.  Who knows what it may shelter?  And there to  the south?  A wilderness of swampy forest, where no white man has ever  been.  The unknown is up against us on every side.  Outside the narrow  lines of the rivers what does anyone know?  Who will say what is  possible in such a country?  Why should old man Challenger not be  right?\"  At which direct defiance the stubborn sneer would reappear  upon Professor Summerlee's face, and he would sit, shaking his sardonic  head in unsympathetic silence, behind the cloud of his briar-root pipe.      So much, for the moment, for my two white companions, whose characters  and limitations will be further exposed, as surely as my own, as this  narrative proceeds.  But already we have enrolled certain retainers who  may play no small part in what is to come.  The first is a gigantic  negro named Zambo, who is a black Hercules, as willing as any horse,  and about as intelligent.  Him we enlisted at Para, on the  recommendation of the steamship company, on whose vessels he had  learned to speak a halting English.    It was at Para also that we engaged Gomez and Manuel, two half-breeds  from up the river, just come down with a cargo of redwood.  They were  swarthy fellows, bearded and fierce, as active and wiry as panthers.  Both of them had spent their lives in those upper waters of the Amazon  which we were about to explore, and it was this recommendation which  had caused Lord John to engage them.  One of them, Gomez, had the  further advantage that he could speak excellent English.  These men  were willing to act as our personal servants, to cook, to row, or to  make themselves useful in any way at a payment of fifteen dollars a  month.  Besides these, we had engaged three Mojo Indians from Bolivia,  who are the most skilful at fishing and boat work of all the river  tribes.  The chief of these we called Mojo, after his tribe, and the  others are known as Jose and Fernando.  Three white men, then, two  half-breeds, one negro, and three Indians made up the personnel of the  little expedition which lay waiting for its instructions at Manaos  before starting upon its singular quest.    At last, after a weary week, the day had come and the hour.  I ask you  to picture the shaded sitting-room of the Fazenda St.  Ignatio, two  miles inland from the town of Manaos.  Outside lay the yellow, brassy  glare of the sunshine, with the shadows of the palm trees as black and  definite as the trees themselves.  The air was calm, full of the  eternal hum of insects, a tropical chorus of many octaves, from the  deep drone of the bee to the high, keen pipe of the mosquito.  Beyond  the veranda was a small cleared garden, bounded with cactus hedges and  adorned with clumps of flowering shrubs, round which the great blue  butterflies and the tiny humming-birds fluttered and darted in  crescents of sparkling light.  Within we were seated round the cane  table, on which lay a sealed envelope.  Inscribed upon it, in the  jagged handwriting of Professor Challenger, were the words:--      \"Instructions to Lord John Roxton and party.  To be opened at Manaos  upon July 15th, at 12 o'clock precisely.\"      Lord John had placed his watch upon the table beside him.    \"We have seven more minutes,\" said he.  \"The old dear is very precise.\"    Professor Summerlee gave an acid smile as he picked up the envelope in  his gaunt hand.    \"What can it possibly matter whether we open it now or in seven  minutes?\" said he.  \"It is all part and parcel of the same system of  quackery and nonsense, for which I regret to say that the writer is  notorious.\"    \"Oh, come, we must play the game accordin' to rules,\" said Lord John.  \"It's old man Challenger's show and we are here by his good will, so it  would be rotten bad form if we didn't follow his instructions to the  letter.\"    \"A pretty business it is!\" cried the Professor, bitterly.  \"It struck  me as preposterous in London, but I'm bound to say that it seems even  more so upon closer acquaintance.  I don't know what is inside this  envelope, but, unless it is something pretty definite, I shall be much  tempted to take the next down-river boat and catch the Bolivia at Para.  After all, I have some more responsible work in the world than to run  about disproving the assertions of a lunatic.  Now, Roxton, surely it  is time.\"    \"Time it is,\" said Lord John.  \"You can blow the whistle.\" He took up  the envelope and cut it with his penknife.  From it he drew a folded  sheet of paper.  This he carefully opened out and flattened on the  table.  It was a blank sheet.  He turned it over.  Again it was blank.  We looked at each other in a bewildered silence, which was broken by a  discordant burst of derisive laughter from Professor Summerlee.    \"It is an open admission,\" he cried.  \"What more do you want?  The  fellow is a self-confessed humbug.  We have only to return home and  report him as the brazen imposter that he is.\"    \"Invisible ink!\" I suggested.    \"I"]]]
