The thews of the sire had been  transmitted to the son--it needed only the hardening of use to develop  them.  The lad found that it came quite naturally to him to swing  through the trees.  Even at great heights he never felt the slightest  dizziness, and when he had caught the knack of the swing and the  release, he could hurl himself through space from branch to branch with  even greater agility than the heavier Akut.    And with exposure came a toughening and hardening of his smooth, white  skin, browning now beneath the sun and wind.  He had removed his pajama  jacket one day to bathe in a little stream that was too small to harbor  crocodiles, and while he and Akut had been disporting themselves in the  cool waters a monkey had dropped down from the over hanging trees,  snatched up the boy's single remaining article of civilized garmenture,  and scampered away with it.    For a time Jack was angry; but when he had been without the jacket for  a short while he began to realize that being half-clothed is infinitely  more uncomfortable than being entirely naked.  Soon he did not miss his  clothing in the least, and from that he came to revel in the freedom of  his unhampered state.  Occasionally a smile would cross his face as he  tried to imagine the surprise of his schoolmates could they but see him  now.  They would envy him.  Yes, how they would envy him.  He felt  sorry for them at such times, and again as he thought of them amid  luxuries and comforts of their English homes, happy with their fathers  and mothers, a most uncomfortable lump would arise into the boy's  throat, and he would see a vision of his mother's face through a blur  of mist that came unbidden to his eyes.  Then it was that he urged Akut  onward, for now they were headed westward toward the coast.  The old  ape thought that they were searching for a tribe of his own kind, nor  did the boy disabuse his mind of this belief.  It would do to tell Akut  of his real plans when they had come within sight of civilization.    One day as they were moving slowly along beside a river they came  unexpectedly upon a native village.  Some children were playing beside  the water.  The boy's heart leaped within his breast at sight of  them--for over a month he had seen no human being.  What if these were  naked savages?  What if their skins were black?  Were they not  creatures fashioned in the mold of their Maker, as was he?  They were  his brothers and sisters!  He started toward them.  With a low warning  Akut laid a hand upon his arm to hold him back.  The boy shook himself  free, and with a shout of greeting ran forward toward the ebon players.    The sound of his voice brought every head erect.  Wide eyes viewed him  for an instant, and then, with screams of terror, the children turned  and fled toward the village.  At their heels ran their mothers, and  from the village gate, in response to the alarm, came a score of  warriors, hastily snatched spears and shields ready in their hands.    At sight of the consternation he had wrought the boy halted.  The glad  smile faded from his face as with wild shouts and menacing gestures the  warriors ran toward him.  Akut was calling to him from behind to turn  and flee, telling him that the blacks would kill him.  For a moment he  stood watching them coming, then he raised his hand with the palm  toward them in signal for them to halt, calling out at the same time  that he came as a friend--that he had only wanted to play with their  children.  Of course they did not understand a word that he addressed  to them, and their answer was what any naked creature who had run  suddenly out of the jungle upon their women and children might have  expected--a shower of spears.  The missiles struck all about the boy,  but none touched him.  Again his spine tingled and the short hairs  lifted at the nape of his neck and along the top of his scalp.  His  eyes narrowed.  Sudden hatred flared in them to wither the expression  of glad friendliness that had lighted them but an instant before.  With  a low snarl, quite similar to that of a baffled beast, he turned and  ran into the jungle.  There was Akut awaiting him in a tree.  The ape  urged him to hasten in flight, for the wise old anthropoid knew that  they two, naked and unarmed, were no match for the sinewy black  warriors who would doubtless make some sort of search for them through  the jungle.    But a new power moved the son of Tarzan.  He had come with a boy's glad  and open heart to offer his friendship to these people who were human  beings like himself.  He had been met with suspicion and spears.  They  had not even listened to him.  Rage and hatred consumed him.  When Akut  urged speed he held back.  He wanted to fight, yet his reason made it  all too plain that it would be but a foolish sacrifice of his life to  meet these armed men with his naked hands and his teeth--already the  boy thought of his teeth, of his fighting fangs, when possibility of  combat loomed close.    Moving slowly through the trees he kept his eyes over his shoulder,  though he no longer neglected the possibilities of other dangers which  might lurk on either hand or ahead--his experience with the lioness did  not need a repetition to insure the permanency of the lesson it had  taught.  Behind he could hear the savages advancing with shouts and  cries.  He lagged further behind until the pursuers were in sight.  They did not see him, for they were not looking among the branches of  the trees for human quarry.  The lad kept just ahead of them.  For a  mile perhaps they continued the search, and then they turned back  toward the village.  Here was the boy's opportunity, that for which he  had been waiting, while the hot blood of revenge coursed through his  veins until he saw his pursuers through a scarlet haze.    When they turned back he turned and followed them.  Akut was no longer  in sight.  Thinking that the boy followed he had gone on further ahead.  He had no wish to tempt fate within range of those deadly spears.  Slinking silently from tree to tree the boy dogged the footsteps of the  returning warriors.  At last one dropped behind his fellows as they  followed a narrow path toward the village.  A grim smile lit the lad's  face.  Swiftly he hurried forward until he moved almost above the  unconscious black--stalking him as Sheeta, the panther, stalked his  prey, as the boy had seen Sheeta do on many occasions.    Suddenly and silently he leaped forward and downward upon the broad  shoulders of his prey.  In the instant of contact his fingers sought  and found the man's throat.  The weight of the boy's body hurled the  black heavily to the ground, the knees in his back knocking the breath  from him as he struck.  Then a set of strong, white teeth fastened  themselves in his neck, and muscular fingers closed tighter upon his  wind-pipe.  For a time the warrior struggled frantically, throwing  himself about in an effort to dislodge his antagonist; but all the  while he was weakening and all the while the grim and silent thing he  could not see clung tenaciously to him, and dragged him slowly into the  bush to one side of the trail.    Hidden there at last, safe from the prying eyes of searchers, should  they miss their fellow and return for him, the lad choked the life from  the body of his victim.  At last he knew by the sudden struggle,  followed by limp relaxation, that the warrior was dead.  Then a strange  desire seized him.  His whole being quivered and thrilled.  Involuntarily he leaped to his feet and placed one foot upon the body  of his kill.  His chest expanded.  He raised his face toward the  heavens and opened his mouth to voice a strange, weird cry that seemed  screaming within him for outward expression, but no sound passed his  lips--he just stood there for a full minute, his face turned toward the  sky, his breast heaving to the pent emotion, like an animate statue of  vengeance.    The silence which marked the first great kill of the son of Tarzan was  to typify all his future kills, just as the hideous victory cry of the  bull ape had marked the kills of his mighty sire.          Chapter 7      Akut, discovering that the boy was not close behind him, turned back to  search for him.  He had gone but a short distance in return when he was  brought to a sudden and startled halt by sight of a strange figure  moving through the trees toward him.  It was the boy, yet could it be?  In his hand was a long spear, down his back hung an oblong shield such  as the black warriors who had attacked them had worn, and upon ankle  and arm were bands of iron and brass, while a loin cloth was twisted  about the youth's middle.  A knife was thrust through its folds.    When the boy saw the ape he hastened forward to exhibit his trophies.  Proudly he called attention to each of his newly won possessions.  Boastfully he recounted the details of his exploit.    \"With my bare hands and my teeth I killed him,\" he said.  \"I would have  made friends with them but they chose to be my enemies.  And now that I  have a spear I shall show Numa, too, what it means to have me for a  foe.  Only the white men and the great apes, Akut, are our friends.  Them we shall seek, all others must we avoid or kill.  This have I  learned of the jungle.\"    They made a detour about the hostile village, and resumed their journey  toward the coast.  The boy took much pride in his new weapons and  ornaments.  He practiced continually with the spear, throwing it at  some object ahead hour by hour as they traveled their loitering way,  until he gained a proficiency such as only youthful muscles may attain  to speedily.  All the while his training went on under the guidance of  Akut.  No longer was there a single jungle spoor but was an open book  to the keen eyes of the lad, and those other indefinite spoor that  elude the"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/903"],[0,"The White Company (#12)"],[1," to that trade,\" quoth the soldier;  \"for there is no child over the water but could answer what you ask.  Know then that though there may be peace between our own provinces and  the French, yet within the marches of France there is always war, for  the country is much divided against itself, and is furthermore harried  by bands of flayers, skinners, Brabacons, tardvenus, and the rest of  them. When every man's grip is on his neighbor's throat, and every  five-sous-piece of a baron is marching with tuck of drum to fight whom  he will, it would be a strange thing if five hundred brave English boys  could not pick up a living. Now that Sir John Hawkwood hath gone with  the East Anglian lads and the Nottingham woodmen into the service of the  Marquis of Montferrat to fight against the Lord of Milan, there are but  ten score of us left, yet I trust that I may be able to bring some back  with me to fill the ranks of the White Company. By the tooth of Peter!  it would be a bad thing if I could not muster many a Hamptonshire man  who would be ready to strike in under the red flag of St. George, and  the more so if Sir Nigel Loring, of Christchurch, should don hauberk  once more and take the lead of us.\"    \"Ah, you would indeed be in luck then,\" quoth a woodman; \"for it is said  that, setting aside the prince, and mayhap good old Sir John Chandos,  there was not in the whole army a man of such tried courage.\"    \"It is sooth, every word of it,\" the archer answered. \"I have seen him  with these two eyes in a stricken field, and never did man carry himself  better. Mon Dieu! yes, ye would not credit it to look at him, or to  hearken to his soft voice, but from the sailing from Orwell down to  the foray to Paris, and that is clear twenty years, there was not a  skirmish, onfall, sally, bushment, escalado or battle, but Sir Nigel was  in the heart of it. I go now to Christchurch with a letter to him from  Sir Claude Latour to ask him if he will take the place of Sir John  Hawkwood; and there is the more chance that he will if I bring one or  two likely men at my heels. What say you, woodman: wilt leave the bucks  to loose a shaft at a nobler mark?\"    The forester shook his head. \"I have wife and child at Emery Down,\"  quoth he; \"I would not leave them for such a venture.\"    \"You, then, young sir?\" asked the archer.    \"Nay, I am a man of peace,\" said Alleyne Edricson. \"Besides, I have  other work to do.\"    \"Peste!\" growled the soldier, striking his flagon on the board until the  dishes danced again. \"What, in the name of the devil, hath come over  the folk? Why sit ye all moping by the fireside, like crows round a dead  horse, when there is man's work to be done within a few short leagues of  ye? Out upon you all, as a set of laggards and hang-backs! By my hilt I  believe that the men of England are all in France already, and that what  is left behind are in sooth the women dressed up in their paltocks and  hosen.\"    \"Archer,\" quoth Hordle John, \"you have lied more than once and more than  twice; for which, and also because I see much in you to dislike, I am  sorely tempted to lay you upon your back.\"    \"By my hilt! then, I have found a man at last!\" shouted the bowman.  \"And, 'fore God, you are a better man than I take you for if you can lay  me on my back, mon garcon. I have won the ram more times than there are  toes to my feet, and for seven long years I have found no man in the  Company who could make my jerkin dusty.\"    \"We have had enough bobance and boasting,\" said Hordle John, rising and  throwing off his doublet. \"I will show you that there are better men  left in England than ever went thieving to France.\"    \"Pasques Dieu!\" cried the archer, loosening his jerkin, and eyeing his  foeman over with the keen glance of one who is a judge of manhood.  \"I have only once before seen such a body of a man. By your leave, my  red-headed friend, I should be right sorry to exchange buffets with  you; and I will allow that there is no man in the Company who would  pull against you on a rope; so let that be a salve to your pride. On  the other hand I should judge that you have led a life of ease for some  months back, and that my muscle is harder than your own. I am ready to  wager upon myself against you if you are not afeard.\"    \"Afeard, thou lurden!\" growled big John. \"I never saw the face yet of  the man that I was afeard of. Come out, and we shall see who is the  better man.\"    \"But the wager?\"    \"I have nought to wager. Come out for the love and the lust of the  thing.\"    \"Nought to wager!\" cried the soldier. \"Why, you have that which I covet  above all things. It is that big body of thine that I am after. See,  now, mon garcon. I have a French feather-bed there, which I have been at  pains to keep these years back. I had it at the sacking of Issodun, and  the King himself hath not such a bed. If you throw me, it is thine; but,  if I throw you, then you are under a vow to take bow and bill and hie  with me to France, there to serve in the White Company as long as we be  enrolled.\"    \"A fair wager!\" cried all the travellers, moving back their benches and  trestles, so as to give fair field for the wrestlers.    \"Then you may bid farewell to your bed, soldier,\" said Hordle John.    \"Nay; I shall keep the bed, and I shall have you to France in spite  of your teeth, and you shall live to thank me for it. How shall it be,  then, mon enfant? Collar and elbow, or close-lock, or catch how you  can?\"    \"To the devil with your tricks,\" said John, opening and shutting his  great red hands. \"Stand forth, and let me clip thee.\"    \"Shalt clip me as best you can then,\" quoth the archer, moving out into  the open space, and keeping a most wary eye upon his opponent. He had  thrown off his green jerkin, and his chest was covered only by a pink  silk jupon, or undershirt, cut low in the neck and sleeveless. Hordle  John was stripped from his waist upwards, and his huge body, with his  great muscles swelling out like the gnarled roots of an oak, towered  high above the soldier. The other, however, though near a foot shorter,  was a man of great strength; and there was a gloss upon his white skin  which was wanting in the heavier limbs of the renegade monk. He was  quick on his feet, too, and skilled at the game; so that it was clear,  from the poise of head and shine of eye, that he counted the chances to  be in his favor. It would have been hard that night, through the whole  length of England, to set up a finer pair in face of each other.    Big John stood waiting in the centre with a sullen, menacing eye, and  his red hair in a bristle, while the archer paced lightly and swiftly to  the right and the left with crooked knee and hands advanced. Then with a  sudden dash, so swift and fierce that the eye could scarce follow it, he  flew in upon his man and locked his leg round him. It was a grip that,  between men of equal strength, would mean a fall; but Hordle John tore  him off from him as he might a rat, and hurled him across the room, so  that his head cracked up against the wooden wall.    \"Ma foi!\" cried the bowman, passing his fingers through his curls, \"you  were not far from the feather-bed then, mon gar. A little more and this  good hostel would have a new window.\"    Nothing daunted, he approached his man once more, but this time with  more caution than before. With a quick feint he threw the other off his  guard, and then, bounding upon him, threw his legs round his waist and  his arms round his bull-neck, in the hope of bearing him to the ground  with the sudden shock. With a bellow of rage, Hordle John squeezed him  limp in his huge arms; and then, picking him up, cast him down upon the  floor with a force which might well have splintered a bone or two,  had not the archer with the most perfect coolness clung to the other's  forearms to break his fall. As it was, he dropped upon his feet and  kept his balance, though it sent a jar through his frame which set every  joint a-creaking. He bounded back from his perilous foeman; but the  other, heated by the bout, rushed madly after him, and so gave the  practised wrestler the very vantage for which he had planned. As big  John flung himself upon him, the archer ducked under the great red hands  that clutched for him, and, catching his man round the thighs, hurled  him over his shoulder--helped as much by his own mad rush as by the  trained strength of the heave. To Alleyne's eye, it was as if John had  taken unto himself wings and flown. As he hurtled through the air, with  giant limbs revolving, the lad's heart was in his mouth; for surely no  man ever yet had such a fall and came scathless out of it. In truth,  hardy as the man was, his neck had been assuredly broken had he not  pitched head first on the very midriff of the drunken artist, who was  slumbering so peacefully in the corner, all unaware of these stirring  doings. The luckless limner, thus suddenly brought out from his dreams,  sat up with a piercing yell, while Hordle John bounded back into the  circle almost as rapidly as he had left it.    \"One more fall, by all the saints!\" he cried, throwing out his arms.    \"Not I,\" quoth the archer, pulling on his clothes, \"I have come well out  of the business. I would sooner wrestle with the great bear of Navarre.\"    \"It was a trick,\" cried John.    \"Aye was it. By my ten finger-bones! it is a trick that will add a  proper man to the ranks of the Company.\"    \"Oh, for that,\" said the other, \"I count it not a fly; for I had  promised myself a good hour ago that I should go with thee, since the  life seems to be a goodly and proper one. Yet I would fain have had the  feather-bed.\"    \"I doubt it not, mon ami,\" quoth the archer, going back to his tankard.  \"Here is to thee, lad, and may we be good comrades to each other! But,  hola! what is it that ails our friend of the wrathful face?\"    The unfortunate limner had been sitting up rubbing himself ruefully"]]]
