From this the result is to those who have so  arranged the work of philosophy, not to fail in the desire, nor to fall  in with that which they would avoid; without uneasiness, without fear,  without perturbation to pass through life themselves, together with  their associates maintaining the relations both natural and acquired, as  the relation of son, of father, of brother, of citizen, of man, of wife,  of neighbor, of fellow-traveller, of ruler, of ruled. The work of a  philosopher we conceive to be something like this. It remains next to  inquire how this must be accomplished.    We see then that the carpenter ([Greek: techton]) when he has learned  certain things becomes a carpenter; the pilot by learning certain things  becomes a pilot. May it not then in philosophy also not be sufficient to  wish to be wise and good, and that there is also a necessity to learn  certain things? We inquire then what these things are. The philosophers  say that we ought first to learn that there is a God and that he  provides for all things; also that it is not possible to conceal from  him our acts, or even our intentions and thoughts. The next thing is to  learn what is the nature of the gods; for such as they are discovered to  be, he, who would please and obey them, must try with all his power to  be like them. If the divine is faithful, man also must be faithful; if  it is free, man also must be free; if beneficent, man also must be  beneficent; if magnanimous, man also must be magnanimous; as being then  an imitator of God he must do and say everything consistently with this  fact.           *       *       *       *       *    TO OR AGAINST THOSE WHO OBSTINATELY PERSIST IN WHAT THEY HAVE  DETERMINED.--When some persons have heard these words, that a man ought  to be constant (firm), and that the will is naturally free and not  subject to compulsion, but that all other things are subject to  hindrance, to slavery, and are in the power of others, they suppose that  they ought without deviation to abide by everything which they have  determined. But in the first place that which has been determined ought  to be sound (true). I require tone (sinews) in the body, but such as  exists in a healthy body, in an athletic body; but if it is plain to me  that you have the tone of a frenzied man and you boast of it, I shall  say to you, Man, seek the physician; this is not tone, but atony  (deficiency in right tone). In a different way something of the same  kind is felt by those who listen to these discourses in a wrong manner;  which was the case with one of my companions, who for no reason resolved  to starve himself to death. I heard of it when it was the third day of  his abstinence from food, and I went to inquire what had happened. \"I  have resolved,\" he said. \"But still tell me what it was which induced  you to resolve; for if you have resolved rightly, we shall sit with you  and assist you to depart, but if you have made an unreasonable  resolution, change your mind.\" \"We ought to keep to our determinations.\"  \"What are you doing, man? We ought to keep not to all our  determinations, but to those which are right; for if you are now  persuaded that it is right, do not change your mind, if you think fit,  but persist and say, We ought to abide by our determinations. Will you  not make the beginning and lay the foundation in an inquiry whether the  determination is sound or not sound, and so then build on it firmness  and security? But if you lay a rotten and ruinous foundation, will not  your miserable little building fall down the sooner, the more and the  stronger are the materials which you shall lay on it? Without any reason  would you withdraw from us out of life a man who is a friend and a  companion, a citizen of the same city, both the great and the small  city? Then while you are committing murder and destroying a man who has  done no wrong, do you say that you ought to abide by your  determinations? And if it ever in any way came into your head to kill  me, ought you to abide by your determinations?\"    Now this man was with difficulty persuaded to change his mind. But it is  impossible to convince some persons at present; so that I seem now to  know what I did not know before, the meaning of the common saying, that  you can neither persuade nor break a fool. May it never be my lot to  have a wise fool for my friend; nothing is more untractable. \"I am  determined,\" the man says. Madmen are also, but the more firmly they  form a judgment on things which do not exist, the more hellebore they  require. Will you not act like a sick man and call in the physician?--I  am sick, master, help me; consider what I must do: it is my duty to obey  you. So it is here also: I know not what I ought to do, but I am come to  learn.--Not so; but speak to me about other things: upon this I have  determined.--What other things? for what is greater and more useful than  for you to be persuaded that it is not sufficient to have made your  determination and not to change it. This is the tone (energy) of  madness, not of health.--I will die, if you compel me to this.--Why,  man? What has happened?--I have determined--I have had a lucky escape  that you have not determined to kill me--I take no money. Why?--I have  determined--Be assured that with the very tone (energy) which you now  use in refusing to take, there is nothing to hinder you at some time  from inclining without reason to take money, and then saying, I have  determined. As in a distempered body, subject to defluxions, the humor  inclines sometimes to these parts, and then to those, so too a sickly  soul knows not which way to incline; but if to this inclination and  movement there is added a tone (obstinate resolution), then the evil  becomes past help and cure.           *       *       *       *       *    THAT WE DO NOT STRIVE TO USE OUR OPINIONS ABOUT GOOD AND EVIL.--Where is  the good? In the will. Where is the evil? In the will. Where is neither  of them? In those things which are independent of the will. Well then?  Does any one among us think of these lessons out of the schools? Does  any one meditate (strive) by himself to give an answer to things as in  the case of questions?--Is it day?--Yes.--Is it night?--No.--Well, is  the number of stars even?--I cannot say.--When money is shown (offered)  to you, have you studied to make the proper answer, that money is not a  good thing? Have you practised yourself in these answers, or only  against sophisms? Why do you wonder then if in the cases which you have  studied, in those you have improved; but in those which you have not  studied, in those you remain the same? When the rhetorician knows that  he has written well, that he has committed to memory what he has  written, and brings an agreeable voice, why is he still anxious? Because  he is not satisfied with having studied. What then does he want? To be  praised by the audience? For the purpose then of being able to practise  declamation he has been disciplined; but with respect to praise and  blame he has not been disciplined. For when did he hear from any one  what praise is, what blame is, what the nature of each is, what kind of  praise should be sought, or what kind of blame should be shunned? And  when did he practise this discipline which follows these words (things)?  Why then do you still wonder, if in the matters which a man has learned,  there he surpasses others, and in those in which he has not been  disciplined, there he is the same with the many. So the lute player  knows how to play, sings well, and has a fine dress, and yet he trembles  when he enters on the stage; for these matters he understands, but he  does not know what a crowd is, nor the shouts of a crowd, nor what  ridicule is. Neither does he know what anxiety is, whether it is our  work or the work of another, whether it is possible to stop it or not.  For this reason if he has been praised, he leaves the theatre puffed up,  but if he has been ridiculed, the swollen bladder has been punctured and  subsides.    This is the case also with ourselves. What do we admire? Externals.  About what things are we busy? Externals. And have we any doubt then why  we fear or why we are anxious? What then happens when we think the  things, which are coming on us, to be evils? It is not in our power not  to be afraid, it is not in our power not to be anxious. Then we say,  Lord God, how shall I not be anxious? Fool, have you not hands, did not  God make them for you? Sit down now and pray that your nose may not run.  Wipe yourself rather and do not blame him. Well then, has he given to  you nothing in the present case? Has he not given to you endurance? Has  he not given to you magnanimity? Has he not given to you manliness? When  you have such hands do you still look for one who shall wipe your nose?  But we neither study these things nor care for them. Give me a man who  cares how he shall do anything, not for the obtaining of a thing, but  who cares about his own energy. What man, when he is walking about,  cares for his own energy? Who, when he is deliberating, cares about his  own deliberation, and not about obtaining that about which he  deliberates? And if he succeeds, he is elated and says, How well we have  deliberated; did I not tell you, brother, that it is impossible, when we  have thought about anything, that it should not turn out thus? But if  the thing should turn out otherwise, the wretched man is humbled; he  knows not even what to say about what has taken place. Who among us for  the sake of this matter has consulted a seer? Who among us as to his  actions has not slept in indifference? Who?

And this doth seem very strange.    And, as may be thought, all this made the Peoples of the Great Redoubt  think newly of the Earth-Current that issued from the \"Crack\" beneath  the Pyramid; and of their latter end; so that much was writ in the  Hour-Slips concerning this matter; yet in the main to assure us that we  ourselves might each be free from a disturbed heart; though some went  foolishly to the other event, and spoke of a speedy danger to us,  likewise; as is ever the way. But the truth of our own case lay, maybe,  somewhere between.    And all the Hour-Slips were full also of imaginings of the terror of  those poor humans out in the darkness of the world, facing that end  which must come upon all, even upon our mighty Pyramid; though, as most  would believe, so far away in some future eternity, that we have no  cause to trouble.    And there were sad poems writ to the peoples of that Lesser Redoubt, and  foolish plans set about to rescue them; but none to put them to effect;  and no way by which so great a thing might be done; and doth but show  how loosely people will speak out of an over-security. Yet to me, there  had come a certain knowledge that I must make the adventure, though I  achieved naught save mine own end. Yet, it were better to cease quickly,  than that I should feel, as now I did feel.    That same night, in the Eighteenth Hour, there was a great disturbance  in the aether about the Mighty Pyramid; and I was awakened suddenly by  the Master Monstruwacan; that I might use my gift of the Night-Hearing  to hearken for the throbbing of the Master-Word, which they had thought  to come vaguely through the Instruments; but no one of the Monstruwacans  was sensitive enough of soul to account truly whether this was so.    And lo! as I sat up in the bed, there came the sound of the Master-Word,  beating in the night about the Pyramid. And immediately there was a  crying in the aether all about me: \"We are coming! We are coming!\"    And mine inwards leaped and sickened me a moment, so shaken was I with a  sudden belief; for the message seemed some ways to come to me from very  near to the Great Redoubt; as that they who sent it were nigh to hand.    And, forthwith, I called the Master-Word into the night; but no answer  did there come for a while, and then a faint thrilling of the aether  about me, and the weak pulse of the Master-Word in the night, sent by a  far voice, strangely distant. And I knew that the voice was the voice of  Naani; and I put a question through all the darkness of the dead world,  whether she were within the Lesser Redoubt, and safe thus far.    And presently, there came a faint disturbance about me, and a small  voice in my soul, speaking weakly and out of an infinite distance; and I  knew that far away through the night Naani spoke feebly, with her  brain-elements; and that she abode within the Lesser Pyramid; but that  she too had heard that strange pulse of the Master-Word in the night,  and that message: \"We are coming! We are coming!\" And vastly had this  thing disturbed her, waking her within her sleep; so that she knew not  what to think; save that we were devising some method to come to them.  But this I removed from doubt, saying that she must not build on vain  hoping; for I would not have her doubly tortured by the vanity of such  believing. And, thereafter, having said such things as I might, though  few they were, to comfort her, I bade her, gently, to sleep; and turned  therewith to the Master Monstruwacan, who waited in quiet patience; and  had no knowledge of that which I had heard and sent; for his hearing was  but the normal; though his brain and heart were such as made me to love  him.    And I told the Master Monstruwacan many things as I put my clothing  about me; how that there had indeed been the calling of the Master-Word;  but not by any of that Lesser Redoubt; but that, to my belief, it had  come from nigh about the Great Pyramid. Moreover, it was sent by no  instrument; as I wotted that he did guess; but, as it seemed to me, by  the brain-elements of many, calling in unison.    And all this did I set out to the Master Monstruwacan; and with  something uncertain of fear and trouble in my heart; yet with a blind  expectation; as, indeed, who would not. Though, no longer was I shaken  by that first thought of Her nearness.    And I said to the Master Monstruwacan that we should go to the Tower of  Observation, and search the Night Lands with the great spy-glass.    And we did this, and lo! presently, we saw a great number of men pass  over the Electric Circle that went about the Pyramid; yet they came not  _to_ us; but went outwards towards the blackness and the strange fires  and hideous mysteries of the Night Land. And we ceased from spying, and  looked swiftly at one another, and knew in our hearts that some had left  the Mighty Pyramid in the Sleep-Time.    Then the Master Monstruwacan sent word to the Master Watchman that his  wardership had been outraged, and that people left the great Pyramid in  the Sleep-Time; for this was against the Law; and none ever went out  into the Night Land, save the Full Watch were posted to the Great Door;  and at a due time, when all were wakeful; for the Opening Of The Door  was made known to all the Millions of the Great Redoubt; so that all  might be aware; and know that no foolishness was done without their  wotting.    Moreover, ere any had power to leave the Pyramid, they must pass The  Examination, and Be Prepared; and some of this have I set out already.  And so stern was the framing of the Law, that there were yet the metal  pegs upon the inner side of the Great Gate, where had been stretched the  skin of one who disobeyed; and was flayed and his hide set there to be a  warning in the Early Days. Yet the tradition was remembered; for, as I  might say it, we lived very close about the place; and Memory had no  room whereby she might escape.    Now the Master Watchman, when he heard that which the Master  Monstruwacan had to tell, went hastily with some of the Central Watch  from the Watch-Dome, to the Great Gate; and he found the men of the  Sleep-Time Watch, with the Warder of the Gate, all bound, and stopt in  the mouth, so that none could make outcry.    And he freed them, and learned that nigh five hundred young men, from  the Upper Cities, by the bigness of their chests, had come upon them  suddenly, and bound them, and escaped into the night through the  Eye-Gate in the top of the Great Gate.    And the Master Watchman was angry, and demanded why that none had called  by the instruments of the Watch House; but lo! some had made to call  thus, and found them unable to wake the recorders which lay in the  central Watch-Dome; for there had been tampering.    Now, after this, they made certain new rules and Laws concerning the  order of Watching, and made tests of the lesser instruments of the  inward Pyramid, nightly, upon the coming of the Sleep-Time, which was,  even in that strange age, by tradition called the Night, as I have given  hint; though hitherto, until the way of my story was known, I have used  a word for the sleep hours that was yet not of that time; but somewhat  an invention to make this history free from the confusion of \"night\" and  \"day,\" when, in truth, it was always night without upon the world. Yet,  after this, shall I keep to mine use the luxury of the true names of  that time; and yet, how strange is it that the truth should be of so  little to our thinking.    And so to go forward with my telling; for, though all this care were now  taken, it had no force until afterward; and at this moment were those  poor foolish youths out in all the danger of the Night Land, and no way  by which they might be succoured, or called back; save that Fear or  Wisdom should come to them quickly, that they cease from so wild an  attempt. For it was to make rescue of those in that other, unknown  Pyramid, out in all the darkness of the World's Night that was their  intent, as we had speedy knowledge from those boon friends that had been  in the secret of their plot, which had seemed to them great and heroic;  and was so, in verity, but that neither they who went, nor they who  stayed, had a true awaredness of the danger they had dealing with, being  all naught but raw and crude youths; yet, doubtless, with the makings of  many fine and great men among them.    And because some had thus abetted that which they knew to be against the  Law, which was framed to the well-being and safety of all, there were  certain floggings, which might the better help their memories in the  future as to the properness of their actions and wisdom.    Moreover, they who returned, if any, would be flogged, as seemed proper,  after due examination. And though the news of their beatings might help  all others to hesitation, ere they did foolishly, in like fashion, yet  was the principle of the flogging not on this base, which would be both  improper and unjust; but only that the one in question be corrected to  the best advantage for his own well-being; for it is not meet that any  principle of correction should shape to the making of human signposts of  pain for the benefit of others; for in verity, this were to make one pay  the cost of many's learning; and each should owe to pay only so much as  shall suffice for the teaching of his own body and spirit. And if others  profit thereby, this is but accident, however helpful. And this is  wisdom, and denoteth now that a sound Principle shall prevent Practice  from becoming monstrous.    Yet, now I must hasten that I set down how it fared with those five  hundred youths that had made so sad an adventure of their lives and  unprepared souls; and were beyond our aid to help them, who might not"]]]
