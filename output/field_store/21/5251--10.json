There was no window in the lower one,  and in the upper, a small aperture which communicated light and air, but  would scarcely admit the body. The door which led into this, was close  to my bed-head, and was always locked, but when I myself was within. The  avenues below were accustomed to be closed and bolted at nights.    The maid was my only companion, and she could not reach my chamber  without previously passing through the opposite chamber, and the middle  passage, of which, however, the doors were usually unfastened. If she  had occasioned this noise, she would have answered my repeated calls.  No other conclusion, therefore, was left me, but that I had mistaken the  sounds, and that my imagination had transformed some casual noise into  the voice of a human creature. Satisfied with this solution, I was  preparing to relinquish my listening attitude, when my ear was again  saluted with a new and yet louder whispering. It appeared, as before,  to issue from lips that touched my pillow. A second effort of attention,  however, clearly shewed me, that the sounds issued from within the  closet, the door of which was not more than eight inches from my pillow.    This second interruption occasioned a shock less vehement than the  former. I started, but gave no audible token of alarm. I was so much  mistress of my feelings, as to continue listening to what should be  said. The whisper was distinct, hoarse, and uttered so as to shew that  the speaker was desirous of being heard by some one near, but, at the  same time, studious to avoid being overheard by any other.    \"Stop, stop, I say; madman as you are! there are better means than that.  Curse upon your rashness! There is no need to shoot.\"    Such were the words uttered in a tone of eagerness and anger, within so  small a distance of my pillow. What construction could I put upon  them? My heart began to palpitate with dread of some unknown danger.  Presently, another voice, but equally near me, was heard whispering in  answer. \"Why not? I will draw a trigger in this business, but perdition  be my lot if I do more.\" To this, the first voice returned, in a tone  which rage had heightened in a small degree above a whisper, \"Coward!  stand aside, and see me do it. I will grasp her throat; I will do her  business in an instant; she shall not have time so much as to groan.\"  What wonder that I was petrified by sounds so dreadful! Murderers  lurked in my closet. They were planning the means of my destruction. One  resolved to shoot, and the other menaced suffocation. Their means being  chosen, they would forthwith break the door. Flight instantly suggested  itself as most eligible in circumstances so perilous. I deliberated not  a moment; but, fear adding wings to my speed, I leaped out of bed, and  scantily robed as I was, rushed out of the chamber, down stairs, and  into the open air. I can hardly recollect the process of turning  keys, and withdrawing bolts. My terrors urged me forward with almost a  mechanical impulse. I stopped not till I reached my brother's door.  I had not gained the threshold, when, exhausted by the violence of my  emotions, and by my speed, I sunk down in a fit.    How long I remained in this situation I know not. When I recovered, I  found myself stretched on a bed, surrounded by my sister and her  female servants. I was astonished at the scene before me, but gradually  recovered the recollection of what had happened. I answered their  importunate inquiries as well as I was able. My brother and Pleyel,  whom the storm of the preceding day chanced to detain here, informing  themselves of every particular, proceeded with lights and weapons to my  deserted habitation. They entered my chamber and my closet, and found  every thing in its proper place and customary order. The door of the  closet was locked, and appeared not to have been opened in my absence.  They went to Judith's apartment. They found her asleep and in safety.  Pleyel's caution induced him to forbear alarming the girl; and finding  her wholly ignorant of what had passed, they directed her to return to  her chamber. They then fastened the doors, and returned.    My friends were disposed to regard this transaction as a dream. That  persons should be actually immured in this closet, to which, in the  circumstances of the time, access from without or within was apparently  impossible, they could not seriously believe. That any human beings  had intended murder, unless it were to cover a scheme of pillage, was  incredible; but that no such design had been formed, was evident  from the security in which the furniture of the house and the closet  remained.    I revolved every incident and expression that had occurred. My  senses assured me of the truth of them, and yet their abruptness and  improbability made me, in my turn, somewhat incredulous. The adventure  had made a deep impression on my fancy, and it was not till after a  week's abode at my brother's, that I resolved to resume the possession  of my own dwelling. There was another circumstance that enhanced the  mysteriousness of this event. After my recovery it was obvious to  inquire by what means the attention of the family had been drawn to my  situation. I had fallen before I had reached the threshold, or was able  to give any signal. My brother related, that while this was transacting  in my chamber, he himself was awake, in consequence of some slight  indisposition, and lay, according to his custom, musing on some favorite  topic. Suddenly the silence, which was remarkably profound, was broken  by a voice of most piercing shrillness, that seemed to be uttered by one  in the hall below his chamber. \"Awake! arise!\" it exclaimed: \"hasten to  succour one that is dying at your door.\"    This summons was effectual. There was no one in the house who was not  roused by it. Pleyel was the first to obey, and my brother overtook him  before he reached the hall. What was the general astonishment when your  friend was discovered stretched upon the grass before the door, pale,  ghastly, and with every mark of death!    This was the third instance of a voice, exerted for the benefit of this  little community. The agent was no less inscrutable in this, than in the  former case. When I ruminated upon these events, my soul was suspended  in wonder and awe. Was I really deceived in imagining that I heard the  closet conversation? I was no longer at liberty to question the reality  of those accents which had formerly recalled my brother from the hill;  which had imparted tidings of the death of the German lady to Pleyel;  and which had lately summoned them to my assistance.    But how was I to regard this midnight conversation? Hoarse and manlike  voices conferring on the means of death, so near my bed, and at such  an hour! How had my ancient security vanished! That dwelling, which had  hitherto been an inviolate asylum, was now beset with danger to my  life. That solitude, formerly so dear to me, could no longer be endured.  Pleyel, who had consented to reside with us during the months of spring,  lodged in the vacant chamber, in order to quiet my alarms. He treated  my fears with ridicule, and in a short time very slight traces of them  remained: but as it was wholly indifferent to him whether his nights  were passed at my house or at my brother's, this arrangement gave  general satisfaction.        Chapter VII      I will not enumerate the various inquiries and conjectures which these  incidents occasioned. After all our efforts, we came no nearer to  dispelling the mist in which they were involved; and time, instead of  facilitating a solution, only accumulated our doubts. In the midst of  thoughts excited by these events, I was not unmindful of my interview  with the stranger. I related the particulars, and shewed the portrait to  my friends. Pleyel recollected to have met with a figure resembling  my description in the city; but neither his face or garb made the same  impression upon him that it made upon me. It was a hint to rally me upon  my prepossessions, and to amuse us with a thousand ludicrous anecdotes  which he had collected in his travels. He made no scruple to charge me  with being in love; and threatened to inform the swain, when he met him,  of his good fortune.    Pleyel's temper made him susceptible of no durable impressions. His  conversation was occasionally visited by gleams of his ancient vivacity;  but, though his impetuosity was sometimes inconvenient, there was  nothing to dread from his malice. I had no fear that my character or  dignity would suffer in his hands, and was not heartily displeased when  he declared his intention of profiting by his first meeting with the  stranger to introduce him to our acquaintance.    Some weeks after this I had spent a toilsome day, and, as the sun  declined, found myself disposed to seek relief in a walk. The river  bank is, at this part of it, and for some considerable space upward,  so rugged and steep as not to be easily descended. In a recess of this  declivity, near the southern verge of my little demesne, was placed a  slight building, with seats and lattices. From a crevice of the rock,  to which this edifice was attached, there burst forth a stream of the  purest water, which, leaping from ledge to ledge, for the space of sixty  feet, produced a freshness in the air, and a murmur, the most delicious  and soothing imaginable. These, added to the odours of the cedars  which embowered it, and of the honey-suckle which clustered among the  lattices, rendered this my favorite retreat in summer.    On this occasion I repaired hither. My spirits drooped through the  fatigue of long attention, and I threw myself upon a bench, in a state,  both mentally and personally, of the utmost supineness. The lulling  sounds of the waterfall, the fragrance and the dusk combined to becalm  my spirits, and, in a short time, to sink me into sleep."]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/7937"],[0,"Journal of an African Cruiser (#12)"],[1,"et-corners, under the name of pea-nuts; so called from  the close resemblance of the bush to the tops of the sweet pea. This nut  is used in England for making oil. The Cocoa is a bulbous root of the size  of a tea-cup, and has some similarity to the artichoke. Pine-apples,  small, but finely flavored, grow wild in the woods, and are abundant in  their season.    In concluding these very imperfect and miscellaneous observations on the  agriculture and products of Liberia, it may be remarked that the farmer's  life and modes of labor are different from those of the same class, in  other countries; inasmuch as there is here no spring, autumn, or winter.  The year is a perpetual summer; therein, if in nothing else, resembling  the climate of the original Paradise, to which men of all colors look back  as the birth-place of their species. The culture of the soil appears to be  emphatically the proper occupation of the Liberians. Many persons have  anticipated making money more easily by trade; but, being unaccustomed to  commercial pursuits, and possessing but little capital, by far the greater  number soon find themselves bankrupt, and burthened with debt. With these  evidences of the inequality, on their part, of competition with vessels  trading on the coast, and with the established traders of the colony, the  inhabitants are now turning their attention more exclusively to  agriculture.

In this region, where all the plants  are strange, and many of them beautiful, it is easy work to form a  collection. With a Kroo-boy to carry my book, I cut leaves and flowers as  they came to hand.    4.--Governor Roberts, General Lewis, and Doctor Day, dined with us in the  ward-room. The Governor is certainly no ordinary person. In every  situation, as judge, ruler, and private gentleman, he sustains himself  creditably, and is always unexceptionable. His deportment is dignified,  quiet, and sensible. He has been tried in war as well as in peace, has  seen a good share of fighting, and has invariably been cool, brave, and  successful. He is a native of Virginia, and came from thence in 1828. The  friends of Colonization can hardly adduce a stronger argument in favor of  their enterprise, than that it has redeemed such a man as Governor Roberts  from servitude, and afforded him the opportunity (which was all he needed)  of displaying his high natural gifts, and applying them to the benefit of  his race.    To-night we had a Kroo-dance on the forecastle. It was an uncouth and  peculiar spectacle, characterized by singing, stamping, and clapping of  hands, with a great display of agility. National dances might be taken as  no bad standard of the comparative civilisation of different countries. A  gracefully quiet dance is the latest flower of high refinement.    5.--Two vessels descried standing in; and bets were five to one that they  were the Macedonian and Decatur. It proved otherwise; they were a British  gun-brig and French merchant-schooner.    8.--It has been raining for three days, almost incessantly. No Macedonian  yet.    10.--Dined on shore. Our captain and five officers, the master and surgeon  of an English merchantman, and the captain of the French schooner, were of  the party. It was a pleasant dinner. The conversation turned principally  upon the trade and customs of the coast. The slave-trade was freely  discussed; and the subject had a peculiar interest, under the  circumstances, because this identical Frenchman, at table with us, is  suspected to have some connection with it. It is merely a surmise. The  French captain speaks a little English; but, after dinner, as a matter of  courtesy, we all adopted his native language. Our friend Colonel Hicks, as  usual, did most of the talking; he is as shrewd, agreeable, and  instructive a companion, as may often be met with in any society.    The dinner-conversation, above alluded to, suggests some remarks in  reference to the slave-trade. There is great discrepancy in the various  estimates as to the number of slaves annually exported from Africa. Some  authorities rate it as high as half a million. Captain Bosanquet, R.N.,  estimates that fifteen thousand are annually sent to the West Indies, and  a greater number to Arabia, all of which are from Portuguese settlements.  He affirms that the trade has increased very much between the years 1832  and 1839, and particularly in the latter part of that period; an effect  naturally consequent upon the great number of captures made by the English  cruisers. A trader, for instance, contracting to introduce a given number  of slaves into Cuba, must purchase more on the coast to make up for those  lost by capture. Captain Brodhead, another British officer, says that the  number of slaves carried off is grossly exaggerated, and that the English  papers told of thousands being shipped from a port, where he lay at anchor  during the period indicated, and for fifty days before and afterwards; in  all which time, not a slave vessel came in sight. Doctor Madden states,  that, during his residence in Cuba, the number of slaves annually imported  was twenty-five thousand. Sir Thomas Fowell Buxton calls it one hundred  and fifteen thousand! Her Majesty's Commissioners say that the number is  as well known as any other statistical point, and that it does not exceed  fifteen thousand. The slave-trade rose to a great height in 1836, owing  principally to the high price of colonial produce. I was in Cuba in that  year, and witnessed the great activity that prevailed in buying negroes,  and forming plantations, especially those of sugar. The prices have since  fallen, and the slave-trade decreased, on the plain principle of political  economy, that the demand regulates the supply.    The English cruisers are doubtless very active in the pursuit of vessels  engaged in this traffic. The approbation of government and the public (to  say nothing of L5 head-money for every slave recaptured, and the increased  chance of promotion to vacancies caused by death) is a strong inducement  to vigilance. But, however benevolent may be the motives that influence  the action of Great Britain, in reference to the slave-trade, there is the  grossest cruelty and injustice in carrying out her views. Attempts are now  being made to transport the rescued slaves in great numbers to the British  West India islands, at the expense of government. It is boldly  recommended, by men of high standing in England, to carry them all thither  at once. The effect of such a measure, gloss it over as you may, would be  to increase the black labor of the British islands, by just so much as is  deducted from the number of slaves, intended for the Spanish or Brazilian  possessions. \"The sure cure for the slave-trade\" says Mr. Laird, \"is in  our own hands. It lies in producing cheaper commodities by free labor, in  our own colonies.\" And, to accomplish this desirable end, England will  seize upon the liberated Africans and land them in her West India islands,  with the alternative of adding their toil to the amount of her colonial  labor, or of perishing by starvation. How much better will their condition  be, as apprentices in Trinidad or Jamaica, than as slaves in Cuba?  Infinitely more wretched! English philanthropy cuts a very suspicious  figure, when, not content with neglecting the welfare of those whom she  undertakes to protect, she thus attempts to made them subservient to  national aggrandizement. The fate of the rescued slaves is scarcely better  than that of the crews of the captured slave-vessels. The latter are  landed on the nearest point of the African coast, where death by  starvation or fever almost certainly awaits them.    I am desirous to put the best construction possible on the conduct as well  of nations as of individuals, and never to entertain that cold scepticism  which explains away all generosity and philanthropy on motives of selfish  policy. But it is difficult to give unlimited faith to the ardent and  disinterested desire professed by England, to put a period to the  slave-trade. If sincere, why does she not, as she readily might, induce  Spain, Portugal, and Brazil, to declare the traffic piratical? And again,  why is not her own strength so directed as to give the trade a death-blow  at once? There are but two places between Sierra Leone and Accra, a  distance of one thousand miles, whence slaves are exported. One is  Gallinas; the other New Sesters. The English keep a cruiser off each of  these rivers. Slavers run in, take their cargoes of human flesh and blood,  and push off. If the cruiser can capture the vessels, the captors receive  L5 per head for the slaves on board, and the government has more  \"emigrants\" for its West India possessions. Now, were the cruisers to  anchor at the mouths of these two rivers, the slavers would be prevented  from putting to sea with their cargoes, and the trade at those places be  inevitably stopped. But, in this case, where would be the head-money and  the emigrants?    It has been asserted that the colonists of Liberia favor the slave-trade.  This is not true. The only places where the traffic is carried on, north  of the line, are in the neighborhood of the most powerful English  settlements on the whole coast; while even British authority does not  pretend that the vicinity of the American colonies is polluted by it.  Individuals among the colonists, unprincipled men, may, in a very few  instances, from love of gain, have given assistance to slavers, by  supplying goods or provisions at high"]]]
