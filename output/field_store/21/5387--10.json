The  Goala asked what sort of things would come to pass. The snake answered  \"If you say a man shall die he will die and if you say he shall come  to life, he will come to life. But you must not tell this to anyone;  not even to your wife when you marry; if you do the power will vanish.\"    Some time afterwards it happened that the Goala was bathing in the  river; and as he bathed one of his hairs came out and the fancy took  him to wrap it in a leaf and set it to float down the stream. Lower  down the river a princess was bathing with her attendants and they  saw the packet come floating down and tried to stop it but it floated  straight to the princess and she caught it and opened it and found  the hair inside. It shone like gold and when they measured it, it was  twelve fathoms long. So the princess tied it up in her cloth and went  home and shut herself up in her room, and would neither eat nor drink  nor speak. Her mother sent two of her companions to question her,  and at last she told them that she would not rise and eat until they  found the person to whom the golden hair belonged; if it were the  hair of a man he should be her husband and if it came from a girl  she would have that girl come and live with her.    When the Raja and Rani heard this and that the hair had come floating  down the river they went to their daughter and told her that they  would at once send messengers up the stream to find the owner of the  hair. Then she was comforted and rose up and ate her rice. That very  day the Raja ordered messengers to follow up the banks of the stream  and enquire in all the villages and question every one they met to  find trace of the owner of the golden hair; so the messengers set out  on both banks of the stream and followed it to its source but their  search was vain and they returned without news; then holy mendicants  were sent out to search and they also returned unsuccessful. Then the  princess said \"If you cannot find the owner of the golden hair I will  hang myself!\" At this a tame crow and a parrot which were chained to  a perch, said \"You will never be able to find the man with the golden  hair; he is in the depths of the forest; if he had lived in a village  you would have found him, but as it is we alone can fetch him; unfasten  our chains and we will go in search of him.\" So the Raja ordered them  to be unfastened and gave them a good meal before starting, for they  could not carry a bag of provisions with them like a man. Then the  crow and the parrot mounted into the air and flew away up the river,  and after long search they spied the Goala in the jungle resting his  cattle under the peepul tree; so they flew down and perched on the  peepul tree and consulted how they could lure him away. The parrot  said that he was afraid to go near the cattle and proposed that the  crow should fly down and carry off the Goala's flute, from where it  was lying with his stick and wrapper at the foot of the tree. So the  crow went flitting from one cow to another till it suddenly pounced  on the flute and carried it off in its beak; when the Goala saw this  he ran after the crow to recover his flute and the crow tempted him  on by just fluttering from tree to tree and the Goala kept following;  and when the crow was tired the parrot took the flute from him and  so between them they drew the Goala on right to the Raja's city,  and they flew into the palace and the Goala followed them in, and  they flew to the room in which the princess was and dropped the  flute into the hand of the princess and the Goala followed and the  door was shut upon him. The Goala asked the princess to give him the  flute and she said that she would give it to him if he promised to  marry her and not otherwise. He asked how he could marry her all of  a sudden when they had never been betrothed; but the princess said  \"We have been betrothed for a long time; do you remember one day  tying a hair up in a leaf and setting it to float downstream; well  that hair has been the go-between which arranged our betrothal.\" Then  the Goala remembered how the snake had told him that his hair would  find him a wife and he asked to see the hair which the princess had  found, so she brought it out and they found that it was like his,  as long and as bright; then he said \"We belong to each other\" and  the princess called for the door to be opened and brought the Goala  to her father and mother and told them that her heart's desire was  fulfilled and that if they did not allow the wedding to take place in  the palace she would run away with the Goala. So a day was fixed for  the wedding and invitations were issued and it duly took place. The  Goala soon became so much in love with his bride that he forgot all  about his herd of cattle which he had left behind, without any one  to look after them; but after some time he bethought himself of them  and he told his bride that he must return to his cattle, whether  she came with him or no. She said that she would take leave of her  parents and go with him; then the Raja gave them a farewell feast and  he made over to the Goala half his kingdom, and gave him a son's share  of his elephants and horses and flocks and herds and said to him \"You  are free to do as you like: you can stay here or go to your own home;  but if you elect to stay here, I shall never turn you out.\" The Goala  considered and said that he would live with his father-in-law but that  he must anyhow go and see the cattle which he had abandoned without  any one to look after them. So the next day he and his wife set off  and when they got to the jungle they found that all the cattle were  lying dead. At this the Goala was filled with grief and began to weep;  then he remembered the promise of the snake that he should be able  to restore the dead to life and he resolved to put it to the test.    So he told his wife that he would give the dead cows medicine and he  got some jungle roots as a blind and held them to the noses of the dead  animals and as he did so, he said \"Come to life\" and, behold, one by  one the cows all got up and began lowing to their calves. Having thus  proved the promises of the snake the Goala was loud in his gratitude  and he filled a large vessel with milk and poured it all out at the  foot of the peepul tree and the snake came and breathed on the hair  of the princess and it too became bright as gold.    The next day they collected all the cows and drove them back to the  princess' home and there the Goala and his wife lived happily, ruling  half the kingdom. And some years after the Goala reflected that the  snake was to him as his father and mother and yet he had come away in  a hurry without taking a proper farewell, so he went to see whether  it was still there; but he could not find it and he asked the peepul  tree and no answer came so he had to return home disappointed.          XX. Kara and Guja.    Once upon a time there were two brothers named Kara and Guja who  were first class shots with the bow and arrow. In the country  where they lived, a pair of kites were doing great damage: they  had young ones in a nest in a tree and used to carry off children  to feed their nestlings until the whole country was desolated. So  the whole population went in a body to the Raja and told him that  they would have to leave the country if he could not have the kites  killed. Then the Raja made proclamation that any one who could kill  the two kites should receive a large tract of land as a reward, and  thereupon many men tried to kill them; but the kites had made their  nest of ploughs and clod-crushers so that the arrows could not hit  them, and the shooters had to give up the attempt. At last Kara and  Guja thought that they would try, so they made an ambush and waited  till the birds came to the nest to feed their young and then shot them  both through the hole in a clod-crusher into which the pole fits, and  the two kites fell down dead, at the source of the Ganges and Jumna,  and where they fell they made a great depression in the ground. Then  Kara and Guja carried the bodies to the Raja and he gave them a grant  of land; and their grateful neighbours made a large rice field of the  depression which the kites had made in the earth and this was given  to Kara and Guja as service land to their great delight.    Kara and Guja used to spend their time in the forest, living on what  they could find there; they slept in a cave and at evening would  cook their rice there or roast jungle roots. One day a tiger spied  them out as they were roasting tubers and came up to them suddenly  and said. \"What are you cooking? Give me some or I will eat you.\" So  while they went on eating the roasted tubers, they threw the coals  from the fire to the tiger at the mouth of the cave and he crunched  them up and every now and then they threw him a bit of something good  to eat; the tiger would not go away but lay there expecting to be fed,  and Kara and Guja debated how to get rid of him. Then Guja suddenly  jumped up and dashed at the tiger and caught him by the tail and began  to twist the tail and he went on twisting until he twisted it right  off and the tiger ran roaring away. Kara and Guja roasted the tail  and ate it, and they found it so nice that they decided to hunt the  tiger and eat the rest of him. So the two brothers searched for him  everywhere and when they found him they chased him until they ran  him down and killed him; then they lit a fire and singed the hair  off and roasted the flesh and made a grand meal: but they did not  eat the paunch. Kara wanted to eat it but Guja would not let him,  so Kara carried it away on his shoulder.    Presently they sat down in the shade of a banyan tree by the side of a  road and along the road came a Raja's wedding procession; "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/11951"],[0,"A Popular History of France from the Earliest Times, Volume 1 (#13)"],[1,"a considerable compass, to  spare them the passage of thick forests, and, after a seven days' march,  arrived at a short distance from the camp of Ariovistus.  On learning  that Caesar was already so near, the German sent to him a messenger with  proposals for the interview which was but lately demanded, and to which  there was no longer any obstacle, since Caesar had himself arrived upon  the spot.  And the interview really took place, with mutual precautions  for safety and warlike dignity.  Caesar repeated all the demands he had  made upon Ariovistus, who, in his turn, maintained his refusal, asking,  \"What was wanted?  Why had foot been set upon his lands?  That part of  Gaul was his province, just as the other was the Roman province.  If  Caesar did not retire, and withdraw his troops, he should consider him no  more a friend, but an enemy.  He knew that if he were to slay Caesar, he  would recommend himself to many nobles and chiefs amongst the Roman  people; he had learned as much from their own envoys.  But if Caesar  retired and left him, Ariovistus, in free possession of Gaul, he would  pay liberally in return, and would wage on Caesar's behalf, without  trouble or danger to him, any wars he might desire.\"  During this  interview it is probable that Caesar smiled more than once at the  boldness and shrewdness of the barbarian.  Ultimately some horsemen in  the escort of Ariovistus began to caracole towards the Romans, and to  hurl at them stones and darts.  Caesar ordered his men to make no  reprisals, and broke off the conference.  The next day but one Ariovistus  proposed a renewal; but Caesar refused, having decided to bring the  quarrel to an issue.  Several days in succession he led out his legions  from their camp, and offered battle; but Ariovistus remained within his  lines.  Caesar then took the resolution of assailing the German camp.  At  his approach, the Germans at length moved out from their intrenchments,  arrayed by peoplets, and defiling in front of cars filled with their  women, who implored them with tears not to deliver them in slavery to the  Romans.  The struggle was obstinate, and not without moments of anxiety  and partial check for the Romans; but the genius of Caesar and strict  discipline of the legions carried the day.  The rout of the Germans was  complete; they fled towards the Rhine, which was only a few leagues from  the field of battle.  Ariovistus himself was amongst the fugitives; he  found a boat by the river side, and recrossed into Germany, where he died  shortly afterwards, \"to the great grief of the Germans,\" says Caesar.  The Suevian bands, who were awaiting on the right bank the result of the  struggle, plunged back again within their own territory.  And so the  invasion of the Germans was stopped as the emigration of the Helvetians  had been; and Caesar had only to conquer Gaul.    It is uncertain whether he had from the very first determined the whole  plan; but so soon as he set seriously to work, he felt all the  difficulties.  The expulsion of the Helvetian emigrants and of the German  invaders left the Romans and Gauls alone face to face; and from that  moment the Romans were, in the eyes of the Gauls, foreigners, conquerors,  oppressors.  Their deeds aggravated day by day the feelings excited by  the situation; they did not ravage the country, as the Germans had done;  they did not appropriate such and such a piece of land; but everywhere  they assumed the mastery: they laid heavy burdens upon the population;  they removed the rightful chieftains who were opposed to them, and  forcibly placed or maintained in power those only who were subservient to  them.  Independently of the Roman empire, Caesar established everywhere  his own personal influence; by turns gentle or severe, caressing or  threatening, he sought and created for himself partisans amongst the  Gauls, as he had amongst his army, showing favor to those only whose  devotion was assured to him.  To national antipathy towards foreigners  must be added the intrigues and personal rivalry of the conquered in  their relations with the conqueror.  Conspiracies were hatched,  insurrections soon broke out in nearly every part of Gaul, in the heart  even of the peoplets most subject to Roman dominion.  Every movement of  the kind was for Caesar a provocation, a temptation, almost an obligation  to conquest.  He accepted them and profited by them, with that  promptitude in resolution, boldness and address in execution, and cool  indifference as to the means employed, which were characteristic of his  genius.  During nine years, from A. U. C. 696 to 705, and in eight  successive campaigns, he carried his troops, his lieutenants, himself,  and, ere long, war or negotiation, corruption, discord, or destruction in  his path, amongst the different nations and confederations of Gaul,  Celtic, Kymric, Germanic, Iberian or Hybrid, northward and eastward,  in Belgica, between the Seine and the Rhine; westward, in Armorica, on  the borders of the ocean; south-westward, in Aquitania; centre-ward,  amongst the peoplets established between the Seine, the Loire, and the  Saone.  He was nearly always victorious, and then at one time he pushed  his victory to the bitter end, at another stopped at the right moment,  that it might not be compromised.  When he experienced reverses, he bore  them without repining, and repaired them with inexhaustible ability and  courage.  More than once, to revive the sinking spirits of his men, he  was rashly lavish of his person; and on one of those occasions, at the  raising of the siege of Gergovia, he was all but taken by some Arvernian  horsemen, and left his sword in their hands.  It was found a while  afterwards, when the war was over, in a temple in which the Gauls had  hung it.  Caesar's soldiers would have torn it down and returned it to  him; but \"let it be,\" said he; \"'tis sanctified.\"  In good or evil  fortune, the hero of a triumph at Rome or a prisoner in the hands of  Mediterranean pirates, he was unrivalled in striking the imaginations of  men and growing great in their eyes.  He did not confine himself to  conquering and subjecting the Gauls in Gaul; his ideas were ever  outstripping his deeds, and he knew how to make his power felt even where  he had made no attempt to establish it.  Twice he crossed the Rhine to  hurl back the Germans beyond their river, and to strike to the very  hearts of their forests the terror of the Roman name (A. U. C.  699,  700).  He equipped two fleets, made two descents on Great Britain  (A. U. C.  699, 700), several times defeated the Britons and their  principal chieftain Caswallon (Cassivellaunus), and set up across the  channel, the first landmarks of Roman conquest.  He thus became more and  more famous and terrible, both in Gaul, whence he sometimes departed for  a moment to go and look after his political prospects in Italy, and in  more distant lands, where he was but an apparition.    But the greatest minds are far from foreseeing all the consequences of  their deeds, and all the perils proceeding from their successes.  Caesar  was by nature neither violent nor cruel; but he did not trouble himself  about justice or humanity, and the success of his enterprises, no matter  by what means or at what price, was his sole law of conduct.  He could  show, on occasion, moderation and mercy; but when he had to put down an  obstinate resistance, or when a long and arduous effort had irritated  him, he had no hesitation in employing atrocious severity and perfidious  promises.  During his first campaign in Belgica, (A. U. C.  697 and 57  B.C.), two peoplets, the Nervians and the Aduaticans, had gallantly  struggled, with brief moments of success, against the Roman legions.  The  Nervians were conquered and almost annihilated.  Their last remnants,  huddled for refuge in the midst of their morasses, sent a deputation to  Caesar, to make submission, saying, \"Of six hundred senators three only  are left, and of sixty thousand men that bore arms scarce five hundred  have escaped.\"  Caesar received them kindly, returned to them their  lands, and warned their neighbors to do them no harm.  The Aduaticans, on  the contrary, defended them selves to the last extremity.  Caesar, having  slain four thousand, had all that remained sold by auction; and fifty-six  thousand human beings, according to his own statement, passed as slaves  into the hands of their purchasers.  Some years later another Belgian  peoplet, the Eburons, settled between the Meuse and the Rhine, rose and  inflicted great losses upon the Roman legions.  Caesar put them beyond  the pale of military and human law, and had all the neighboring peoplets  and all the roving bands invited to come and pillage and destroy \"that  accursed race,\" promising to whoever would join in the work the  friendship of the Roman people.  A little later still, some insurgents in  the centre of Gaul had concentrated in a place to the south-west, called  Urellocdunum (nowadays, it is said, Puy d'Issola, in the department of  the Lot, between Vayrac and Martel).  After a long resistance they were  obliged to surrender, and Caesar had all the combatants' hands cut off,  and sent them, thus mutilated, to live and rove throughout Gaul, as a  spectacle to all the country that was, or was to be, brought to  submission.  Nor were the rigors of administration less than those of  warfare.  Caesar wanted a great deal of money, not only to maintain  satisfactorily his troops in Gaul, but to defray the enormous expenses he  was at in Italy, for the purpose of enriching his partisans, or securing  the favor of the Roman people.  It was with the produce of imposts and  plunder in Gaul that he undertook the reconstruction at Rome of the  basilica of the Forum, the site whereof, extending to the temple of  Liberty, was valued, it is said, at more than twenty million five  hundred thousand francs.
