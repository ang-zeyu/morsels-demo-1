On counting it up, there was found the exact amount  of the draft to a cent, and in the identical coin which had been  received. He never, under any circumstances, used trust funds.\"    When Lincoln was about twenty-three years of age, some time in 1832, he  began studying law, using an old copy of Blackstone's Commentaries which  he had bought at auction in Springfield. This work was soon mastered,  and then the young man looked about him for more. His friend of the  Black Hawk War, Major John T. Stuart, had a considerable law library for  those days, and to him Lincoln applied in his extremity. The library was  placed at his disposal, and thenceforth he was engrossed in the  acquisition of its contents. But the books were in Springfield, where  their owner resided; and New Salem was some fourteen miles distant. This  proved no obstacle in the way of Lincoln, who made nothing of the walk  back and forth in the pursuit of his purpose. Mr. Stuart's partner, Mr.  H.C. Dummer, who took note of the youth in his frequent visits to the  office, describes him as \"an uncouth looking lad, who did not say much,  but what he did say he said straight and sharp.\" \"He used to read law,\"  says Henry McHenry, \"barefooted, seated in the shade of a tree just  opposite Berry's grocery, and would grind around with the shade,  occasionally varying his attitude by lying flat on his back and putting  his feet up the tree,\" a situation which might have been unfavorable to  mental application in the case of a man with shorter extremities. \"The  first time I ever saw Abe with a law-book in his hand,\" says Squire  Godbey, \"he was sitting astride Jake Bates's woodpile in New Salem. Says  I, 'Abe, what are you studying?' 'Law,' says Abe. 'Good God Almighty!'  responded I.\" It was too much for Godbey; he could not suppress the  exclamation of surprise at seeing such a figure acquiring learning in  such an odd situation. Mr. Arnold states that Lincoln made a practice  of reading in his walks between Springfield and New Salem; and so  intense was his application and so absorbed was he in his study that he  would pass his best friends without observing them, and some people said  that Lincoln was going crazy with hard study.    He soon began to make a practical application of his legal knowledge. He  bought an old form-book and began to draw up contracts, deeds, leases,  mortgages, and all sorts of legal instruments for his neighbors. He also  began to exercise his forensic ability in trying small cases before  justices of the peace and juries, and soon acquired a local reputation  as a speaker, which gave him considerable practice. But he was able in  this way to earn scarcely money enough for his maintenance. To add to  his means, he took up the study of surveying, and soon became, like  Washington, a skilful and accurate surveyor. John Calhoun, an  intelligent and courteous gentleman, was at that time surveyor of the  county of Sangamon. He became interested in Lincoln and appointed him  his deputy. His work was so accurate and the settlers had such  confidence in him that he was much sought after to survey, fix, and mark  the boundaries of farms, and to plot and lay off the town of Petersburg.  His accuracy must have been attained with some difficulty, for when he  began to survey his chain was a grape-vine. He did not speculate in the  land he surveyed. Had he done so the rapid advance in the value of real  estate would have made it easy for him to make good investments. But he  was not in the least like one of his own appointees when President,--a  surveyor-general of a Western territory, who bought up much of the best  land, and to whom the President said, \"I am told, sir, you are _monarch  of all you survey_.\"    The nomination of Lincoln for the State Legislature on his return from  the Black Hawk War was premature. The people of New Salem voted for him  almost to a man, but his acquaintance had not then extended into the  surrounding district far enough to insure his election. In the campaign  of 1834 the choice of a candidate again fell upon him, and this time  there was a prospect of success. Lincoln entered into the contest with  earnestness, and used every legitimate means to secure a victory. Mr.  Herndon relates the following incident of this campaign: \"Lincoln came  to my house, near Island Grove, during harvest. There were some thirty  men in the field. He had his dinner, and then went out into the field  where the men were at work. I introduced him, and the boys said they  would not vote for a man unless he could 'make a hand.' 'Well, boys,' he  said, 'if that is all that is needed I am sure of your votes.' He took  hold of the cradle and led the way all around with perfect ease. The  boys were satisfied. I don't think he lost a vote in that crowd. The  next day there was speaking at Berlin. He went from my house with Dr.  Barnett, who had asked me who this man Lincoln was. I told him he was a  candidate for the Legislature. He laughed and said, 'Can't the party  raise better material than that?' I said, 'Go to-morrow and hear him  before you pass judgment.' When he came back I said, 'Doctor, what have  you to say now?' 'Why, sir,' he said, 'he is a perfect _take-in_. He  knows more than all the rest of them put together.'\"    The result of the election was that Lincoln was chosen to represent the  Sangamon district. When the Legislature convened at the opening session,  he was in his place in the lower house; but he bore himself quietly in  his new position. He had much to learn in his novel situation as one of  the lawmakers of the State, and as a co-worker with an assembly  comprising the most talented and prominent men gathered from all parts  of Illinois. He was keenly watchful of the proceedings of the House,  weighing every measure with scrutinizing sagacity, but except in the  announcement of his vote his voice was seldom heard. At the previous  session, Mr. G.S. Hubbard, afterwards a well-known citizen of Chicago,  had exerted himself to procure the passage of an act for the  construction of the Illinois and Michigan Canal. His effort was  defeated; but he continued, as a lobbyist, to push the measure during  several winters, until it was finally adopted. Lincoln lent him  efficient aid in the accomplishment of his object. \"Indeed,\" remarks Mr.  Hubbard, \"I very much doubt if the bill could have passed as easily as  it did without his valuable help.\" \"We were thrown much together,\"  continues Mr. Hubbard, \"our intimacy increasing. I never had a friend to  whom I was more warmly attached. His character was almost faultless;  possessing a warm and generous heart, genial, affable, honest, courteous  to his opponents, persevering, industrious in research, never losing  sight of the principal point under discussion, aptly illustrating by his  stories which were always brought into good effect. He was free from  political trickery or denunciation of the personal character of his  opponents. In debate he was firm and collected. 'With malice toward  none, with charity for all,' he won the confidence of the public, even  his political opponents.\"    Of all the stories of Lincoln's boyhood and youth, the most profoundly  touching is that of his love for Anne Rutledge. The existence of this  romance was brief, but it is believed by many that it was the memory of  it which threw over Lincoln that indescribable melancholy which seemed  to shadow his whole life. The Rutledges from whom Anne was descended  were an eminent family of the Carolinas. She was about nineteen years  old when Lincoln knew her first. It was shortly after the Black Hawk  War. She was a winsome girl, with fair hair and blue eyes, and Lincoln's  heart was captivated by her sweet face and gentle manners. So attractive  a girl was not, of course, without suitors, and Anne had been wooed by  one James McNeill, a young man who had come to New Salem soon after the  founding of the town. He had been more than ordinarily successful, and  had bought a large farm a few miles north of the village. He was  unmarried--at least he so represented himself--and paid devoted  attention to Anne. They were engaged, although both had acquiesced in  the wishes of Anne's parents that they should not be married until she  was older.    About this time Lincoln appeared in New Salem and went to board at the  Rutledge tavern. Here he saw Anne, and was much in her company. During  the next year McNeill became restless and discontented. He said it was  because he wanted to see his people. So he decided to go East on a  visit. He sold out his interests in New Salem--an act not at all  necessary if he were going only on a visit, and which in the light of  after events had much significance--telling Anne that it was his hope to  bring his father and mother back with him and establish them upon his  farm. \"This done,\" he said, \"we will be married.\" He then set out on his  journey.    It was late in the summer before Anne heard from him. He explained that  he had been taken ill with chills and fever on the way, and had been  long delayed in getting home. But the long wait had been a great strain  upon Anne. Lincoln, meanwhile, had become the postmaster in New Salem,  and it was to him that Anne came to inquire for letters. He watched her  anxiety with sympathy, and in a way became her confidant. His tender  heart, which never could resist suffering, was deeply touched at sight  of her distress. Finally McNeill's letters ceased altogether; and then  Anne confided to Lincoln something which McNeill had told her before he  left, and which until now she had kept secret,--namely, that his name  was not McNeill but McNamar. He had explained to her that he had made  this change because his father had failed in business and that as his  oldest son it was his duty to retrieve the"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/14006"],[0,"An English Grammar (#13)"],[1,"es.    [Sidenote: What _simple relative and_ what _indefinite relative_.]    123. The above helps us to discriminate between _what_ as a simple  and _what_ as an indefinite relative.    As shown in Sec. 120, the simple relative _what_ is equivalent to  _that which_ or the _thing which_,--some particular thing; as shown by  the last sentence in Sec. 121, _what_ means _anything that_,  _everything that_ (or _everything which_). The difference must be seen  by the meaning of the sentence, as _what_ hardly ever has an  antecedent.    The examples in sentences 5 and 6, Sec. 121, show that _who_ and  _which_ have no antecedent expressed, but mean _any one whom_, _either  one that_, etc.        OTHER WORDS USED AS RELATIVES.      [Sidenote: But _and_ as.]    124. Two words, but and as, are used with the force of relative  pronouns in some expressions; for example,--         1. There is not a leaf rotting on the highway _but_ has force in       it: how else could it rot?--CARLYLE.         2. This, amongst such other troubles _as_ most men meet with in       this life, has been my heaviest affliction.--DE QUINCEY.    [Sidenote: _Proof that they have the force of relatives._]    Compare with these the two following sentences:--         3. There is nothing _but_ is related to us, nothing _that_ does       _not_ interest us.--EMERSON.         4. There were articles of comfort and luxury such _as_ Hester       never ceased to use, but _which_ only wealth could have       purchased.--HAWTHORNE.    Sentence 3 shows that _but_ is equivalent to the relative _that_ with  _not_, and that _as_ after _such_ is equivalent to _which_.    For _as_ after _same_ see \"Syntax\" (Sec. 417).    [Sidenote: _Former use of_ as.]    125. In early modern English, _as_ was used just as we use _that_ or  _which_, not following the word _such_; thus,--         I have not from your eyes that gentleness       And show of love _as_ I was wont to have.--SHAKESPEARE    This still survives in vulgar English in England; for example,--         \"Don't you mind Lucy Passmore, _as_ charmed your warts for you       when you was a boy? \"--KINGSLEY    This is frequently illustrated in Dickens's works.      [Sidenote: _Other substitutes._]    126. Instead of the phrases _in which_, _upon which_, _by which_,  etc., the conjunctions _wherein_, _whereupon_, _whereby_, etc., are  used.         A man is the facade of a temple _wherein_ all wisdom and good       abide.--EMERSON.         The sovereignty of this nature _whereof_ we speak.--_Id._         The dear home faces _whereupon_       That fitful firelight paled and shone.--WHITTIER.        PRONOUNS IN INDIRECT QUESTIONS.      [Sidenote: _Special caution needed here._]    127. It is sometimes hard for the student to tell a relative from an  interrogative pronoun. In the regular direct question the  interrogative is easily recognized; so is the relative when an  antecedent is close by. But compare the following in pairs:--    1.  (_a_) Like a gentleman of leisure _who_ is strolling out for       pleasure.         (_b_) Well we knew _who_ stood behind, though the earthwork hid       them.    2.  (_a_) But _what_ you gain in time is perhaps lost in power.         (_b_) But _what_ had become of them they knew not.    3.  (_a_) These are the lines _which_ heaven-commanded Toil shows on       his deed.         (_b_) And since that time I thought it not amiss To judge _which_       were the best of all these three.    In sentences 1 (_a_), 2 (_a_) and 3 (_a_) the regular relative use is  seen; _who_ having the antecedent _gentleman_, _what_ having the  double use of pronoun and antecedent, _which_ having the antecedent  _lines_.    But in 1 (_b_), 2 (_b_), and 3 (_b_), there are two points of  difference from the others considered: first, no antecedent is  expressed, which would indicate that they are not relatives; second, a  question is disguised in each sentence, although each sentence as a  whole is declarative in form. Thus, 1 (_b_), if expanded, would be,  \"Who stood behind? We knew,\" etc., showing that _who_ is plainly  interrogative. So in 2 (_b_), _what_ is interrogative, the full  expression being, \"But what had become of them? They knew not.\"  Likewise with _which_ in 3 (_b_).    [Sidenote: _How to decide._]    In studying such sentences, (1) see whether there is an antecedent of  _who_ or _which_, and whether _what_ = _that_ + _which_ (if so, it is  a simple relative; if not, it is either an indefinite relative or an  interrogative pronoun); (2) see if the pronoun introduces an indirect  question (if it does, it is an interrogative; if not, it is an  indefinite relative).    [Sidenote: _Another caution._]    128. On the other hand, care must be taken to see whether the  pronoun is the word that really _asks the question_ in an  interrogative sentence. Examine the following:--    1. Sweet rose! whence is this hue       _Which_ doth all hues excel?       --DRUMMOND    2. And then what wonders shall you do       _Whose_ dawning beauty warms us so?       --WALKER    3.  Is this a romance? Or is it a faithful picture of _what_ has       lately been in a neighboring land?--MACAULAY      These are interrogative sentences, but in none of them does the  pronoun ask the question. In the first, _whence_ is the interrogative  word, _which_ has the antecedent _hue_. In the second, _whose_ has the  antecedent _you_, and asks no question. In the third, the question is  asked by the verb.        OMISSION OF THE RELATIVES.      [Sidenote: _Relative omitted when_ object.]    129. The relative is frequently omitted in spoken and in literary  English when it would be the object of a preposition or a verb. Hardly  a writer can be found who does not leave out relatives in this way  when they can be readily supplied in the mind of the reader. Thus,--         These are the sounds we feed upon.--FLETCHER.         I visited many other apartments, but shall not trouble my reader       with all the curiosities I observed.--SWIFT.      Exercise.    Put in the relatives _who_, _which_, or _that_ where they are omitted  from the following sentences, and see whether the sentences are any  smoother or clearer:--         1. The insect I am now describing lived three years,--GOLDSMITH.         2. They will go to Sunday schools through storms their brothers       are afraid of.--HOLMES.         3. He opened the volume he first took from the shelf.--G. ELIOT.         4. He could give the coals in that queer coal scuttle we read of       to his poor neighbor.--THACKERAY.         5. When Goldsmith died, half the unpaid bill he owed to Mr.       William Filby was for clothes supplied to his nephew.--FORSTER         6. The thing I want to see is not Redbook Lists, and Court       Calendars, but the life of man in England.--CARLYLE.         7. The material they had to work upon was already democratical by       instinct and habitude.--LOWELL.      [Sidenote: _Relative omitted when_ subject.]    130. We often hear in spoken English expressions like these:--         There isn't one here * knows how to play ball.         There was such a crowd * went, the house was full.    Here the omitted relative would be in the nominative case. Also in  literary English we find the same omission. It is rare in prose, and  comparatively so in poetry. Examples are,--         The silent truth that it was she was superior.--THACKERAY         I have a mind presages me such thrift.--SHAKESPEARE.         There is a nun in Dryburgh bower,        Ne'er looks upon the sun.       --SCOTT.         And you may gather garlands there        Would grace a summer queen.       _Id._         'Tis distance lends enchantment to the view.--CAMPBELL.      Exercises on the Relative Pronoun.    (_a_) Bring up sentences containing ten instances of the relatives  _who_, _which_, _that_, and _what_.    (_b_) Bring up sentences having five indefinite relatives.    (_c_) Bring up five sentences having indirect questions introduced by  pronouns.    (_d_) Tell whether the pronouns in the following are interrogatives,  simple relatives, or indefinite relatives:--    1. He ushered him into one of the wherries which lay ready to attend  the Queen's barge, which was already proceeding.    2. The nobles looked at each other, but more with the purpose to see  what each thought of the news, than to exchange any remarks on what  had happened.    3. Gracious Heaven! who was this that knew the word?    4. It needed to be ascertained which was the strongest kind of men;  who were to be rulers over whom.    5. He went on speaking to who would listen to him.    6. What kept me silent was the thought of my mother.        ADJECTIVE PRONOUNS.    [Sidenote: _Function of adjective pronouns._]    131. Most of the words how to be considered are capable of a double  use,--they may be pure modifiers of nouns, or they may stand for  nouns. In the first use they are adjectives; in the second they retain  an adjective _meaning_, but have lost their adjective _use_. Primarily  they are adjectives, but in this function, or use, they are properly  classed as adjective pronouns.    The following are some examples of these:--         _Some_ say that the place was bewitched.--IRVING.          That mysterious realm where _each_ shall take       His chamber in the silent halls of death.       --BRYANT.         How happy is he born or taught        That serveth not _another's_ will.       --WOTTON         _That_ is more than any martyr can stand.--EMERSON.    [Sidenote: _Caution._]    [Sidenote: _Adjectives, not pronouns._]    Hence these words are like adjectives used as nouns, which we have  seen in such expressions as, \"_The dead_ are there;\" that is, a word,  in order to be an adjective pronoun, _must not modify any word,  expressed or understood_. It must come under the requirement of  pronouns, and _stand for a noun_. For instance, in the following  sentences--\"The cubes are of stainless ivory, and on _each_ is  written, in "]]]
