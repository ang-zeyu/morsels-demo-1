BIRD, ROBERT MONTGOMERY (1803-1854).--Novelist, an American physician,  wrote three tragedies, _The Gladiator_, _Oraloosa_, and _The Broker of  Bogota_, and several novels, including _Calavar_, _The Infidel_, _The  Hawks of Hawk Hollow_, _Peter Pilgrim_, and _Nick of the Woods_, in the  first two of which he gives graphic and accurate details and descriptions  of Mexican history.      BISHOP, SAMUEL (1731-1795).--Poet, _b._ in London, and _ed._ at Merchant  Taylor's School and Oxf., took orders and became Headmaster of Merchant  Taylor's School. His poems on miscellaneous subjects fill two quarto  vols., the best of them are those to his wife and _dau._ He also _pub._  essays.      BLACK, WILLIAM (1841-1898).--Novelist. After studying as a landscape  painter, he took to journalism in Glasgow. In 1864 he went to London, and  soon after _pub._ his first novel, _James Merle_, which made no  impression. In the Austro-Prussian War he acted as a war correspondent.  Thereafter he began afresh to write fiction, and was more successful; the  publication of _A Daughter of Heth_ (1871) at once established his  popularity. He reached his highwater-mark in _A Princess of Thule_  (1873). Many other books were added before his death in 1898, among which  may be mentioned _In Silk Attire_ (1869), _The Strange Adventures of a  Phaeton_ (1872), _Macleod of Dare_ (1878), _White Wings_ (1880), _Shandon  Bells_ (1882), _Yolande_ (1883), _Judith Shakespeare_ (1884), _White  Heather_ (1886), _Stand Fast Craig-Royston!_ (1890), _Green Pastures and  Piccadilly_, _Three Feathers_, _Wild Eelin_ (1898).      BLACKIE, JOHN STUART (1809-1895).--Scholar and man of letters, _b._ in  Glasgow, and _ed._ at the Universities of Aberdeen and Edin., after which  he travelled and studied in Germany and Italy. Returning to Scotland he  was, in 1834, admitted to the Scottish Bar, but did not practise. His  first work was his translation of _Faust_ (1834), which won the  approbation of Carlyle. From 1841-52 B. was Prof. of Humanity (Latin) in  Aberdeen, and from 1852-82, when he retired, of Greek in Edinburgh. His  literary activity was incessant, his works consisting of translations of  _AEschylus_ and of the _Iliad_, various books of poetry, including _Lays  and Legends of Ancient Greece_, and treatises on religious,  philosophical, and political subjects, among which may be mentioned  _Self-Culture_ (1873), _Horae Hellenicae_, and a life of Burns. He was an  enthusiastic champion of Scottish nationality. Possessed of great  conversational powers and general versatility, his picturesque  eccentricity made him one of the most notable members of Scottish  society. It was owing to his efforts that a Chair of Celtic Language and  Literature was established in Edinburgh University.      BLACKLOCK, THOMAS (1721-1791).--Poet, _b._ near Annan of humble  parentage, lost his sight by smallpox when 6 months old. He began to  write poetry at the age of 12, and studied for the Church. He was  appointed Minister of Kirkcudbright, but was objected to by the  parishioners on account of his blindness, and gave up the presentation on  receiving an annuity. He then retired to Edinburgh, where he took pupils.  He _pub._ some miscellaneous poems, which are now forgotten, and is  chiefly remembered for having written a letter to Burns, which had the  effect of dissuading him from going to the West Indies. He was made D.D.  in 1767.      BLACKMORE, SIR RICHARD (_c._ 1650, _d._ 1729).--Poet, one of the Court  Physicians to William III. and Anne, wrote several very long and  well-intentioned, but dull and tedious, poems, which, though praised by  Addison and Johnson, are now utterly forgotten. They include _Prince  Arthur_, _Creation_, _Redemption_, _Alfred_. As may be imagined, they  were the subject of derision by the profaner wits of the day. B. was a  successful physician and an excellent man.      BLACKMORE, RICHARD DODDRIDGE (1825-1900).--Novelist and poet, _b._ at  Longworth, Berks, _ed._ at Tiverton School and Oxf., practised for a  short time as a lawyer but, owing to his health, gave this up, and took  to market-gardening and literature at Teddington. His first _pub._ was  _Poems by Melanter_ (1853), followed by _Epullia_ (1855), _The Bugle of  the Black Sea_ (1855), etc.; but he soon found that fiction, not poetry,  was his true vocation. Beginning with _Clara Vaughan_ in 1864, he  produced fifteen novels, all of more than average, and two or three of  outstanding merit. Of these much the best in the opinion of the public,  though not of the author, is _Lorna Doone_ (1869), the two which rank  next to it being _The Maid of Sker_ (1872) (the author's favourite) and  _Springhaven_ (1887). Others are _Cradock Nowell_ (1866), _Alice  Lorraine_ (1875), _Cripps the Carrier_ (1876), _Mary Anerley_ (1880), and  _Christowell_ (1882). One of the most striking features of B.'s writings  is his marvellous eye for, and sympathy with, Nature. He may be said to  have done for Devonshire what Scott did for the Highlands. He has been  described as \"proud, shy, reticent, strong-willed, sweet-tempered, and  self-centred.\"      BLACKSTONE, SIR WILLIAM (1723-1780).--Legal Writer, posthumous _s._ of a  silk mercer in London, was _ed._ at Charterhouse School and Oxf., and  entered the Middle Temple in 1741. His great work is his _Commentaries on  the Laws of England_, in 4 vols. (1765-1769), which still remains the  best general history of the subject. It had an extraordinary success, and  is said to have brought the author L14,000. B. was not a man of original  mind, nor was he a profound lawyer; but he wrote an excellent style,  clear and dignified, which brings his great work within the category of  general literature. He had also a turn for neat and polished verse, of  which he gave proof in _The Lawyer's Farewell to his Muse_.      BLAIR, HUGH (1718-1800).--Divine, and man of letters, _b._ and _ed._ at  Edin. After being minister at Collessie in Fife, he was translated to  Edinburgh, where he filled various pulpits, latterly that of the High  Church. In 1759 he commenced a series of lectures on composition, and  soon after the Chair of Rhetoric and Belles Lettres was founded, to which  he was appointed. His _Lectures_ were _pub._ on his resignation of the  chair in 1783. His chief fame, however, rests upon his _Sermons_, in 4  vols., which had an extraordinary popularity, and obtained for him a  pension of L200. Time has not sustained the opinion of his  contemporaries: they have been described as feeble in thought though  elegant in style, and even as \"a bucket of warm water.\" B. was amiable,  kind to young authors, and remarkable for a harmless, but rather  ridiculous vanity and simplicity.      BLAIR, ROBERT (1699-1746).--Poet, _b._ at Edin., where his _f._ was a  clergyman, became minister of Athelstaneford, Haddingtonshire. His sole  work was _The Grave_, a poem in blank verse extending to 767 lines of  very various merit, in some passages rising to great sublimity, and in  others sinking to commonplace. It was illustrated by William Blake  (_q.v._) B.'s _s._, Robert, was a very distinguished Scottish judge and  Lord President of the Court of Session; and his successor in his  ministerial charge was Home, the author of _Douglas_.      BLAKE, WILLIAM (1757-1827).--Poet and painter, _b._ in London, was from  earliest youth a seer of visions and a dreamer of dreams, seeing \"Ezekiel  sitting under a green bough,\" and \"a tree full of angels at Peckham,\" and  such he remained to the end of his days. His teeming imagination sought  expression both in verse and in drawing, and in his 14th year he was  apprenticed to James Basire, an eminent engraver, and thereafter studied  at the Royal Academy. Among his chief artistic works were illustrations  for Young's _Night Thoughts_, Blair's _Grave_, \"Spiritual Portraits,\" and  his finest work, \"Inventions to the Book of Job,\" all distinguished by  originality and imagination. In literature his _Songs of Innocence_  appeared in 1789, _Songs of Experience_ in 1794. These books were  literally made by Blake and his heaven-provided wife; poems and designs  alike being engraved on copper by B. and bound by Mrs. B. In like fashion  were produced his mystical books, _The Book of Thel_ (1789), _The  Marriage of Heaven and Hell_ (1790), _The Gates of Paradise_, _Visions of  the Daughters of Albion_, _Europe_, _The Book of Urizen_ (1794), _The  Book of Los_ and _The Book of Ahania_ (1795). His last books were  _Jerusalem_ and _Milton_. His earlier and shorter pieces, _e.g._ \"The  Chimney-Sweeper,\" \"Holy Thursday,\" \"The Lamb,\" \"The Sun-flower,\" \"The  Tiger,\" etc., have an exquisite simplicity arising from directness and  intensity of feeling--sometimes tender, sometimes sublime--always  individual. Latterly he lost himself in clouds of mysticism. A truly  pious and loving soul, neglected and misunderstood by the world, but  appreciated by an elect few, he led a cheerful and contented life of  poverty illumined by visions and celestial inspirations.      BLAMIRE, SUSANNA (1747-1794).--Poetess, was of good Cumberland family,  and received the sobriquet of \"The Muse of Cumberland.\" Her poems, which  were not collected until 1842, depict Cumbrian life and manners with  truth and vivacity. She also wrote some fine songs in the Scottish  dialect, including \"Ye shall walk in Silk Attire,\" and \"What ails this  Heart o' Mine.\"      BLESSINGTON, MARGARET (POWER), COUNTESS of (1789-1849).--Married as her  second husband the 1st Earl of B., with whom she travelled much on the  Continent, where she met Lord Byron, her _Conversations_ with whom she  _pub._ in 1834. This is the only one of her books which has any value.  The others were slight works on Travel, such as _The Idler in Italy_,  annuals, and novels. She became bankrupt and went to Paris, where she  lived under the"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/13241"],[0,"International Weekly Miscellany of Literature, Art and Science - Volume 1, No. (#13)"],[1,"property--with the running quarter's interest, shall be paid at La  Touche's to the order of Messrs. Kettlewell and Sly. As the blindness  of the New Zealanders is deplorable, and as Mr. Kettlewell has already  enlisted some gallant champions who will blow the gospel-trumpet,  although they were to be served up to supper the same evening, I wish  the object to be carried out at once--'\"    \"_Beautiful!_\" said my poor father with a groan; \"_where the devil  could the money be raised? You won't realize now for a bullock what,  in war-time, you would get for a calf. Go on with the old harridan's  epistle._\"    \"'Having now got rid of fleshly considerations--I mean money ones--let  me, my dear James, offer a word in season. Remember that it comes from  an attached relation, who holds your worldly affairs as nothing--'\"    \"_I can't dispute that_,\" said my father with a smothered groan.    \"'But would turn your attention to the more important considerations  of our being. I would not lean too heavily upon the bruised reed, but  your early life was anything but evangelical--'\"    Constance laughed; she could not, wild girl, avoid it.    \"'We must all give an account of our stewardship,' _vide_ St. Luke,  chap. xvi.--'\"    \"_Stop--Shakspeare's right; when the devil quotes Scripture--but, go  on--let's have the whole dose._\"    \"'When can you pay the money in? And, oh! in you, my dear nephew, may  grace yet fructify, and may you be brought, even at the eleventh hour,  to a slow conviction that all on this earth is vanity and vexation  of spirit--drums, colors, scarlet and fine linen, hounds running  after hares, women whirling round, as they tell me they do, in that  invention of the evil one called a waltz, all these are but delusions  of the enemy, and designed to lead sinners to destruction. I  transcribe a verse from a most affecting hymn, composed by that gifted  man--'\"    \"_Oh, d----n the hymn!_\" roared my father; \"_on with you, Frank, and  my benison light on the composer of it! Don't stop to favor us with  his name, and pass over the filthy doggerel!_\"    I proceeded under orders accordingly.    \"'Remember, James, you are now sixty-one; repent, and, even in the  eleventh hour, you may be plucked like a brand from the fire. Avoid  swearing, mortify the flesh--that is, don't take a third tumbler after  dinner--'\"    My father could not stand it longer. \"_Oh, may Cromwell's curse light  upon her! I wonder how many glasses of brandy-and-water she swallows  at evening exercise, as she calls it, over a chapter of Timothy?_\"    \"'I would not recall the past, but for the purpose of wholesome  admonition. The year before you married, and gave up the godless life  of soldiering, can you forget that I found you, at one in the morning  in Bridget Donovan's room? Your reason was, that you had got the  colic; if you had, why not come to my chamber, where you knew there  was laudanum and lavender?    Poor Constance could not stand the fresh allegation; and, while my  mother looked very grave, we laughed, as Scrub says, \"consumedly.\" My  father muttered something about \"cursed nonsense!\" but I am inclined  to think that aunt Catharine's colic charge was not without some  foundation.    \"'I have now, James, discharged my duty: may my humble attempts to  arouse you to a sense of the danger of standing on the brink of the  pit of perdition be blessed! Pay the principal and interest over to La  Touche. Mr. Selby Sly hinted that a foreclosure of the mortgage might  expedite matters; and, by saving a term or two in getting in the  money, two or three hundred New Zealanders would--and oh, James! how  gratifying would be the reflection!--be saved from the wrath to come.    \"'This morning, on looking over your marriage settlement, Mr. Sly is  of opinion that, if Mrs. Hamilton will renounce certain rights he can  raise the money at once, and that too only at legal interest, say six  per cent.--'\"    Often had I witnessed a paternal explosion; but, when it was hinted  that the marital rights of my poor mother were to be sacrificed, his  fury amounted almost to madness.    \"Damnation!\" he exclaimed; \"confusion light upon the letter and the  letter-writer! You!--do you an act to invalidate your settlement!  I would see first every canting vagabond in----\" and he named a  disagreeable locality. \"Never, Mary! pitch that paper away: I dread  that at the end of it the old lunatic will inflict her benediction.  Frank, pack your traps--you must catch the mail to-night; you'll be  in town by eight o'clock to-morrow morning. Be at Sly's office at  nine. D----n the gout!--I should have done the job myself. Beat the  scoundrel as nearly to death as you think you can conscientiously  go without committing absolute murder: next, pay a morning visit to  Kettlewell, and, if you leave him in a condition to mount the pulpit  for a month, I'll never acknowledge you. Break that other seal;  Probably, the contents may prove as agreeable as old Kitty's.\"    There were times and moods when, in Byron's language, it was judicious  to reply \"Psha! to hear is to obey,\" and this was such a period.  I broke the black wax, and the epistle proved to be from the very  gentleman whom I was to be dispatched per mail to qualify next morning  for surgical assistance.    \"Out with it!\" roared my father, as I unclosed the foldings of the  paper; \"What is the signature? I remember that my uncle Hector always  looked at the name attached to a letter when he unclosed the post-bag;  and if the handwriting looked like an attorney's he flung it, without  reading a line, into the fire.\"    \"This letter, sir, is subscribed 'Selby Sly.'\"    \"Don't burn it, Frank, read. Well, there is one comfort that Selby  Sly shall have to-morrow evening a collection of aching ribs, if the  Hamiltons are not degenerated: read, man,\" and, as usual, there was a  running comment on the text.    \"'Dublin,--March, 1818.    \"'Colonel Hamilton,--Sir,    \"'It is my melancholy duty to inform you--'\"    \"_That you have foreclosed the mortgage. Frank, if you don't break a  bone or two, I'll never acknowledge you again._\"    \"'That my honored and valued client and patroness, Mrs. Catharine  O'Gorman, suddenly departed this life at half-past six o'clock, P.M.,  yesterday evening, when drinking a glass of sherry, and holding sweet  and spiritual converse with the Reverend Carter Kettlewell.'\"    \"_It's all up, no doubt: the canting scoundrels have secured her--or,  as blackguard gamblers say, have 'made all' safe?_\"    \"'She has died intestate, although a deed, that would have  immortalized her memory, was engrossed, and ready for signature.  Within an hour after she went to receive her reward--'\"    My father gave a loud hurrah! \"_Blessed be Heaven that the rout came  before the old fool completed the New Zealand business!_\"    \"'As heir-at-law, you are in direct remainder, and the will, not being  executed, is merely wastepaper: but, from the draft, the intentions  of your inestimable aunt can clearly be discovered. Although not  binding in law, let me say there is such a thing as Christian  equity that should guide you. The New Zealand bequest, involving a  direct application of 10,000l. to meet the annual expenditure of  gospel-soldiers--there being a constant drain upon these sacred  harbingers of peace, from the native fancy of preferring a deviled  missionary to a stewed kangaroo--that portion of the intended  testament I would not press upon you. But the intentional behests of  500l. to the Rev. Carter Kettlewell, the same sum to myself, and an  annuity to Miss Grace Lightbody of 50l. a year, though not recoverable  in law, under these circumstances should be faithfully confirmed.    \"'It may be gratifying to acquaint you with some particulars of the  last moments of your dear relative, and one of the most devout, nay,  I may use the term safely, evangelical elderly gentlewomen for whom I  have had the honor to transact business.'\"    \"_Stop, Frank. Pass over the detail. It might be too affecting._\"    \"'I await your directions for the funeral. My lamented friend and  client had erected a catacomb in the Siloam Chapel, and in the  minister's vault, and she frequently expressed a decided wish that  her dust might repose with faithful servants, who, in season and out  of season, fearlessly grappled with the man of sin, who is arrayed  in black, and the woman who sitteth on the seven hills, dressed in  scarlet.'\"    \"_Hang the canting vagabond--why not call people by their proper  titles; name Old Nick at once, and the lady whose soubriquet  is unmentionable, but who, report says, has a town residence in  Babylon._\"    Constance and I laughed; my mother, as usual, looking demure and  dignified. Another twinge of the gout altogether demolished the  commander's temper.    \"_Stop that scoundrel's jargon. Run your eye over the remainder, and  tell me what the fellow's driving at._\"    I obeyed the order.    \"Simply, sir, Mr. Sly desires to know whether you have any objection  to old Kitty taking peaceable possession of her catacomb in the Dublin  gospel-shop which she patronized, or would you prefer that she were  'pickled and sent home,' as Sir Lucius says.\"    \"Heaven forbid that I should interfere with her expressed wishes,\"  said my father. \"I suppose there's 'snug lying' in Siloam; and there's  one thing certain, that the company who occupy the premises are quite  unobjectionable. Kitty will be safer there. Lord! if the gentleman in  black, or the red lady of the seven hills attempted a felonious entry  on her bivouac, what a row the saintly inmates would kick up! It would  be a regular 'guard, turn out!' And what chance would scarlatina and  old clooty have? No, no, she'll be snug there in her sentry-box. What  a blessed escape from ruin! Mary, dear, make me another tumbler, and  d----n the gout!\"--he had a sharp twinge. \"I'll drink 'here's luck!'  Frank, go pack your kit, and instead of"]]]
