[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/10745"],[0,"The Story of the Champions of the Round Table (#13)"],[1," a shallow dale, very fertile and smiling, but  of no great size. For the more part that dale was all spread over with  fields and meadow-lands, with here and there a plantation of trees in full  blossom and here and there a farm croft. A winding river flowed down  through the midst of this valley, very quiet and smooth, and brimming its  grassy banks, where were alder and sedge and long rows of pollard willows  overreaching the water.    [Sidenote: Sir Launcelot and Croisette come to a fair valley] At the  farther end of the valley was a castle of very comely of appearance, being  built part of stone and part of bright red bricks; and the castle had many  windows of glass and tall chimneys, some a-smoke. About the castle and nigh  to it was a little village of thatched cottages, with many trees in blossom  and some without blossom shading the gables of the small houses that took  shelter beneath them.    Now when Sir Launcelot and Croisette came into that little valley it was at  the declining of the day and the sky was all alight with the slanting sun,  and the swallows were flying above the smooth shining surface of the river  in such multitudes that it was wonderful to behold them. And the lowing  herds were winding slowly along by the river in their homeward way, and all  was so peaceful and quiet that Sir Launcelot drew rein for pure pleasure,  and sat for some while looking down upon that fair, happy dale. Then by and  by he said: \"Croisette, meseems I have never beheld so sweet and fair a  country as this, nor one in which it would be so pleasant to live.\"    Upon this Croisette was very much pleased, and she smiled upon Sir  Launcelot. \"Think you so, Sir Launcelot?\" quoth she. \"Well, in sooth, I am  very glad that this valley pleasures you; for I love it beyond any other  place in all the world. For here was I born and here was I raised in that  castle yonder. For that is my brother's castle and it was my father's  castle before his time; wherefore meseems that no place in all the world  can ever be so dear to my heart as this dale.\"    [Sidenote: Croisette bringeth Sir Launcelot to her brother's house]  Thereupon they went forward up that little valley, and along by the  smoothly flowing river, and the farther they went the more Sir Launcelot  took pleasure in all that he beheld. Thus they came through the pretty  village where the folk stood and watched with great admiration how that  noble knight rode that way; and so they came to the castle and rode into  the court-yard thereof. Then presently there came the lord of that castle,  who was Sir Hilaire of the Dale. And Sir Hilaire greeted Sir Launcelot,  saying: \"Welcome, Sir Knight. This is great honor you do me to come into  this quiet dale with my sister, for we do not often have with us travellers  of such quality as you.\"    \"Brother,\" said Croisette, \"you may well say that it is an honor to have  this knight with us, for this is none other knight than the great Sir  Launcelot of the Lake. This day I beheld him overcome Sir Turquine in fair  and honorable battle. So he doth indeed do great honor for to visit us in  this wise.\"    Then Sir Hilaire looked at Sir Launcelot very steadily, and he said: \"Sir  Launcelot, your fame is so great that it hath reached even unto this  peaceful outland place; wherefore it shall not soon be forgotten here how  you came hither. Now, I pray you, come in and refresh yourself, for I see  that you are wounded and I doubt not you are weary.\"    [Sidenote: Sir Launcelot is made at ease] Upon this several attendants  came, and they took Sir Launcelot and led him to a pleasant chamber. There  they unarmed him and gave him a bath in tepid water, and there came a leech  and searched his wounds and dressed them. Then those in attendance upon him  gave him a soft robe of cloth of velvet, and when Sir Launcelot had put it  on he felt much at ease, and in great comfort of body.    By and by, when evening had fallen, a very good, excellent feast was spread  in the hall of the castle, and there sat down thereto Sir Launcelot and Sir  Hilaire and the damsel Croisette. As they ate they discoursed of various  things, and Sir Launcelot told many things concerning his adventures, so  that all who were there were very quiet, listening to what he said. For it  was as though he were a visitor come to them from some other world, very  strange and distant, of which they had no knowledge, wherefore they all  listened so as not to lose a single word of what he told them. So that  evening passed very pleasantly, and Sir Launcelot went to his bed with  great content of spirit.    [Sidenote: How Sir Launcelot abides at the castle of Sir Hilaire] So Sir  Launcelot abided for several days in that place until his wounds were  healed. Then one morning, after they had all broken their fast, he made  request that he and the damsel might be allowed to depart upon that  adventure which he had promised her to undertake, and unto this Sir Hilaire  gave his consent.    Now, during this while, Sir Launcelot's armor had been so pieced and mended  by the armor-smiths of that castle that when he donned it it was, in a  measure, as sound as it had ever been, and of that Sir Launcelot was very  glad. So having made ready in all ways he and Croisette took leave of that  place, and all they who were there bade them adieu and gave Sir Launcelot  God-speed upon that adventure.    Now some while after they left that dale they rode through a very ancient  forest, where the sod was exceedingly soft underfoot and silent to the  tread of the horses, and where it was very full of bursting foliage  overhead. And as they rode at an easy pace through that woodland place they  talked of many things in a very pleasant and merry discourse.    Quoth the damsel unto Sir Launcelot: \"Messire, I take very great wonder  that thou hast not some special lady for to serve in all ways as a knight  should serve a lady.\"    [Sidenote: Sir Launcelot and Croisette discourse together] \"Ha, damsel,\"  said Sir Launcelot, \"I do serve a lady in that manner and she is peerless  above all other ladies; for that lady is the Lady Guinevere, who is King  Arthur's queen. Yet though I am her servant I serve her from a very great  distance. For in serving her I am like one who standeth upon the earth, yet  looketh upward ever toward the bright and morning star. For though such an  one may delight in that star from a distance, yet may he never hope to  reach an altitude whereon that star standeth.\"    \"Heyday!\" quoth Croisette, \"for that matter, there are other ways of  serving a lady than that wise. Were I a knight meseems I would rather serve  a lady nearer at hand than at so great distance as that of which thou  speakest. For in most cases a knight would rather serve a lady who may  smile upon him nigh at hand, and not stand so far off from him as a star in  the sky.\" But to this Sir Launcelot made no reply but only smiled. Then in  a little Croisette said: \"Dost thou never think of a lady in that wise, Sir  Launcelot?\"    [Sidenote: Sir Launcelot speaketh of the Lady Guinevere] \"Nay,\" said Sir  Launcelot, \"and neither do I desire so to serve any lady. For it is thus  with me, Croisette--for all that while of my life until I was eighteen  years of age I lived in a very wonderful land beneath a magical lake, of  which I may not tell thee. Then I came out of that lake and into this world  and King Arthur made me a knight. Now because I was so long absent from  this world of mankind and never saw aught of it until I was grown into a  man, meseems I love that world so greatly that I cannot tell thee how  beautiful and wonderful it seems to me. For it is so wonderful and so  beautiful that methinks my soul can never drink its fill of the pleasures  thereof. Yea; methinks I love every blade of grass upon the fields, and  every leaf upon every tree: and that I love everything that creepeth or  that flyeth, so that when I am abroad under the sky and behold those things  about me I am whiles like to weep for very joy of them. Wherefore it is,  Croisette, that I would rather be a knight-errant in this world which I  love so greatly than to be a king seated upon a throne with a golden crown  upon my head and all men kneeling unto me. Yea; meseems that because of my  joy in these things I have no room in my heart for such a love of lady as  thou speakest of, but only for the love of knight-errantry, and a great  wish for to make this world in which I now live the better and the happier  for my dwelling in it. Thus it is, Croisette, that I have no lady for to  serve in the manner thou speakest of. Nor will I ever have such, saving  only the Lady Guinevere, the thought of whom standeth above me like that  bright star afore spoken of.\"    \"Ha,\" quoth Croisette, \"then am I sad for the sake of some lady, I know not  who. For if thou wert of another mind thou mightest make some lady very  glad to have so great a knight as thou art to serve her.\" Upon this Sir  Launcelot laughed with a very cheerful spirit, for he and the damsel were  grown to be exceedingly good friends, as you may suppose from such  discourse as this.    [Sidenote: Sir Launcelot perceives the Castle of Sir Peris] So they wended  their way in this fashion until somewhat after the prime of day, and by  that time they had come out of that forest and into a very rugged country.  For this place into which they were now come was a sort of rocky valley,  rough and bare and in no wise beautiful. When they had entered into it they  perceived, a great way off, a castle built up upon the rocks. And that  castle was built very high, so that the roofs and the chimneys thereof  stood wonderfully sharp and clear against the sky; yet the castle was so  distant that it looked like a toy which you might easily take into your  hand and hold betwixt your fingers.    Then Croisette said to Sir Launcelot: \"Yonder is the castle of that  evil-minded knight of whom I"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/10751"],[0,"Oregon, Washington and Alaska; Sights and Scenes for the Tourist (#13)"],[1,"regon,  and Washington.
