Her past was pushed so far from her that she could not even  long for it as she had done during the first few weeks. There were nights  of utter desolation, when Manley was in town upon some errand which  prevented his speedy return--nights when the coyotes howled much louder  than usual, and she could not sleep for the mysterious snapping and  creaking about the shack, but lay shivering with fear until dawn; but not  for worlds would she have admitted to Manley her dread of staying alone.  She believed it to be necessary, or he would not require it of her, and she  wanted to be all that he expected her to be. She was very sensitive, in  those days, about doing her whole duty as a wife--the wife of a Western  rancher.    For that reason, when Manley shouted to her the news of the fire as he  galloped past the shack, and told her to have something for the men to eat  when the fire was out, she never thought of demurring, or explaining to  him that there was scarcely any wood, and that she could not cook a meal  without fuel. Instead, she waved her hand to him and let him go; and when  he was quite out of sight she went up to the corrals to see if she could  find another useless pole, or a broken board or two which her slight  strength would be sufficient to break up with the axe. Till she came to  Montana, Val had never taken an axe in her hands; but its use was only  one of the many things she must learn, of which she had all her life been  ignorant.    There was an old post there, lying beside a rusty, overturned plow. More  than once she had stopped and eyed it speculatively, and the day before she  had gone so far as to lift an end of it tentatively; but she had found  it very heavy, and she had also disturbed a lot of black bugs that went  scurrying here and there, so that she was forced to gather her skirts close  about her and run for her life.    Where Manley had built his hayrack she had yesterday discovered some ends  of planking hidden away in the rank, ripened weeds and grass. She went  there now, but there were no more, look closely as she might. She circled  the evil-smelling stable in discouragement, picked up one short piece of  rotten board, and came back to the post. As she neared it she involuntarily  caught her skirts and held them close, in terror of the black bugs.    She eyed it with extreme disfavor, and finally ventured to poke it with her  slipper toe; one lone bug scuttled out and away in the tall weeds. With  the piece of board she turned it over, stared hard at the yellowed grass  beneath, discovered nothing so very terrifying after all, and, in pure  desperation, dragged the post laboriously down to the place where had been  the woodpile. Then, lifting the heavy axe, she went awkwardly to work  upon it, and actually succeeded, in the course of half an hour or so, in  worrying an armful of splinters off it.    She started a fire, and then she had to take the big zinc pail and carry  some water down from the spring before she could really begin to cook  anything. Manley's work, every bit of it--but then Manley was so very busy,  and he couldn't remember all these little things, and Val hated to keep  reminding him. Theoretically, Manley objected to her chopping wood or  carrying water, and always seemed to feel a personal resentment when he  discovered her doing it. Practically, however, he was more and more often  making it necessary for her to do these things.    That is why he returned with the fire fighters and found Val just laying  the cloth upon the table, which she had moved into the front room so that  there would be space to seat her guests at all four sides. He frowned when  he looked in and saw that they must wait indefinitely, and her cheeks took  on a deeper shade of pink.    \"Everything will be ready in ten minutes,\" she hurriedly assured him. \"How  many are there, dear?\"    \"Eight, counting myself,\" he answered gruffly. \"Get some clean towels, and  we'll go up to the spring to wash; and try and have dinner ready when we  get back--we're half starved.\" With the towels over his arm, he led the way  up to the spring. He must have taken the trail which led past the haystack,  for he returned in much better humor, and introduced the men to his wife  with the genial air of a host who loves to entertain largely.    Val stood back and watched them file in to the table and seat themselves  with a noisy confusion. Unpolished they were, in clothes and manner, though  she dimly appreciated the way in which they refrained from looking at her  too intently, and the conscious lowering of their voices while they talked  among themselves.    They did, however, glance at her surreptitiously while she was moving  quietly about, with her flushed cheeks and her yellow-brown hair falling  becomingly down at the temples because she had not found a spare minute in  which to brush it smooth, and her dainty dress and crisp, white apron. She  was not like the women they were accustomed to meet, and they paid her the  high tribute of being embarrassed by her presence.    She poured coffee until all the cups were full, replenished the bread plate  and brought more butter, and hunted the kitchen over for the can opener,  to punch little holes in another can of condensed cream; and she rather  astonished her guests by serving it in a beautiful cut-glass pitcher  instead of the can in which it was bought.    They handled the pitcher awkwardly because of their mental uneasiness,  and Val shared with them their fear of breaking it, and was guilty of an  audible sigh of relief when at last it found safety upon the table.    So perturbed was she that even when she decided that she could do no more  for their comfort and retreated to the kitchen, she failed to realize that  the one extra plate meant an absent guest, and not a miscount in placing  them, as she fancied.    She remembered that she would need plenty of hot water to wash all those  dishes, and the zinc pail was empty; it always was, it seemed to her, no  matter how often she filed it. She took the tin dipper out of it, so that  it would not rattle and betray her purpose to Manley, sitting just inside  the door with his back toward her, and tiptoed quite guiltily out of the  kitchen. Once well away from the shack, she ran.    She reached the spring quite out of breath, and she actually bumped into  a man who stood carefully rinsing a bloodstained handkerchief under the  overflow from the horse trough. She gave a little scream, and the pail went  rolling noisily down the steep bank and lay on its side in the mud.    Kent turned and looked at her, himself rather startled by the unexpected  collision. Involuntarily he threw out his hand to steady her. \"How do you  do, Mrs. Fleetwood?\" he said, with all the composure he could muster to his  aid. \"I'm afraid I scared you. My nose got to bleeding--with the heat, I  guess. I just now managed to stop it.\" He did not consider it necessary to  explain his presence, but he did feel that talking would help her recover  her breath and her color. \"It's a plumb nuisance to have the nosebleed so  much,\" he added plaintively.    Val was still trembling and staring at him with her odd, yellow-brown eyes.  He glanced at her swiftly, and then bent to squeeze the water from his  handkerchief; but his trained eyes saw her in all her dainty allurement;  saw how the coppery sunlight gave a strange glint to her hair, and how  her eyes almost matched it in color, and how the pupils had widened with  fright. He saw, too, something wistful in her face, as though life was  none too kind to her, and she had not yet abandoned her first sensation of  pained surprise that it should treat her so.    \"That's what I get for running,\" she said, still panting a little as she  watched him. \"I thought all the men were at the table, you see. Your dinner  will be cold, Mr. Burnett.\"    Kent was a bit surprised at the absence of cold hauteur in her manner; his  memory of her had been so different.    \"Well, I'm used to cold grub,\" he smiled over his shoulder. \"And, anyway,  when your nose gets to acting up with you, it's like riding a pitching  horse; you've got to pass up everything and give it all your time and  attention.\" Then, with the daring that sometimes possessed him like a  devil, he looked straight at her.    \"Sure you intend to give me my dinner?\" he quizzed, his lips' lifting  humorously at the corners. \"I kinda thought, from the way you turned me  down cold when we met before, you'd shut your door in my face if I came  pestering around. How _about_ that?\"    Little flames of light nickered in her eyes. \"You are the guest of my  husband, here by his invitation,\" she answered him coldly. \"Of course I  shall give you your dinner, if you want any.\"    He inspected his handkerchief critically, decided that it was not quite  clean, and held it again under the stream of water. \"If I want it--yes,\" he  drawled maliciously. \"Maybe I'm not sure about that part. Are you a pretty  fair cook?\"    \"Perhaps you'd better interview your friends,\" she retorted, \"if you are so  very fastidious. I--\" She drew her brows together, as if she was in doubt  as to the proper method of dealing with this impertinence. She suspected  that he was teasing her purposely, but still--    \"Oh, I can eat 'most any old thing,\" he assured her, with calm effrontery.  \"You look as if you'd learn easy, and Man ain't the worst cook I ever ate  after. If he's trained you faithful, maybe it'll be safe to take a change.  How _about_ that? Can you make sour-dough bread yet?\"    \"No!\" she flung the word at him. \"And I don't want to learn,\" she added, at  the expense of her dignity.    Kent shook his head disapprovingly. \"That sure ain't the proper spirit to  show,\" he commented. \"Man must have to beat you up a good deal, if you talk  back to _him_ that way.\" He eyed her sidelong. \"You're a real little"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/8547"],[0,"Pirke Avot: The Sayings of the Jewish Fathers (#12)"],[1,"    (31) Prov. III, 5.    19. R. Jannia said, \"It is not in our power (to explain) either the  prosperity of the wicked or the afflictions of the righteous.\"    20. R. Mattithiah, the son of Heresh (32), said, \"Be beforehand in the  salutation of peace to all men; and be rather a tail to lions than a  head to foxes\" (33).          (32) He lived about 120 C.E. in Rome.          (33) It is better to be a pupil of great teachers than to be a        teacher of worthless pupils (Maimonides).  It is better to        follow those who are greater than to lead those who are        inferior.    21. R. Jacob (34) said, \"This world is like a vestibule before the  world to come (35); prepare thyself in the vestibule, that thou mayest  enter into the hall.\"  22. He used to say, \"Better is one hour of  repentance and good deeds in this world than the whole life of the  world to come; and better is one hour of blissfulness of spirit in the  world to come than the whole life of this world.\"          (34) He lived about 160-220 C.E.          (35) This world is a bridge that leads to the future world        (Maimonides).    23. R. Simeon, the son of Eleazer (36), said, \"Do not appease thy  fellow in the hour of his anger, and comfort him not in the hour when  his dead lies before him, and question him not in the hour of his vow,  and rush not to see him in the hour of his disgrace.\"          (36) A pupil of R. Meir.  He lived about 160-220 C.E.    24. Samuel (37), the younger, used to say, \"Rejoice not when thine  enemy falleth, and let not thine heart be glad when he stumbleth: lest  the Lord see it and it displease him, and he turn away his wrath from  him\" (38).          (37) Samuel (about 120 C.E.) is said to have composed, at the        request of R. Gamaliel II, the prayer against heretics, added        to the \"Eighteen Benedictions\" (_Shemoneh Esreh_).  See the        _Jewish Encyclopedia_, vol. XI, p. 281.          (38) Prov. XXIV, 17, 18.    25. Elisha, the son of Abuyah (39), said, \"If one learns as a child,  what is it like?  Like ink written in clean paper.  If one learns as  an old man, what is it like?  Like ink written on used paper\" (40).          (39) See n. 1, above.  Elisha ben Abuyah, otherwise known as        Acher, lived at the end of the first and the beginning of the        second century.  He is charged by the Rabbis with having aided        the Romans in their attempts to suppress the Jewish religion,        with having endeavored to estrange the young from Judaism and        from the study of its literature, with having intentionally        and openly broken the ceremonial laws, and with having        desecrated the Sabbath.  R. Meir, his pupil, maintained a        close intimacy with him, in spite of his apostacy, having high        regard for Elisha's intellectual worth.  When reproached for        this, R. Meir said, \"I eat the kernel, and throw away the        husks.\"  Elisha is often referred to as the \"Faust of the        _Talmud_.\"  On his identification with the Apostle Paul, see        I. M. Wise, _The Origin of Christianity_, p. 311, and        Danziger, _ibid._, pp. 304-306.  Some have even identified him        with Jesus.  In _Abot de-Rabbi Natan_, a parable that is very        similar to that of Jesus, in Luke VI 47-49, is attributed to        Elisha.  \"A man who does good deeds and diligently studies the        Law, to whom is he likened?  He is like a man building a house        with a stone foundation and with tiles (on the roof); and when        a flood arises, and breaks against the walls, that house        cannot be moved from its place.  But the man who lives an evil        life, in spite of having deeply studied the Law, to whom is he        like?  He is like a man building a house with tiles for a        foundation and with heavy stones (on the roof); and when a        little rain comes, straightway the house falls in\" (G.        Friedlander's translation, in _The Jewish Sources of the        SErmon on the Mount_, pp. 259-260).  On the career of Acher,        see Bacher, _ibid._, pp. 432-436; Graetz, _History_, II,        _passim_; Myers, _ibid._, pp. 200-202; and Strack, _Einleitung        in den Talmud_, p. 91.          (40) What one learns in youth, one retains, while the opposite        is true of learning in old age.  The Rabbis, elsewhere, liken        learning in youth to engraving upon a stone, and learning in        old age to writing on the sand.    26. R. Jose, the son of Judah (41), of Chefar Babli said, \"He who  learns from the young, to what is he like?  To one who eats unripe  grapes, and drinks wine from his vat (42).  And he who learns from the  old, to what is he like?  To one who eats ripe grapes, and drinks old  wine.\"          (41) A contemporary of Judah ha-Nasi.          (42) _I.e._, wine that is not forty days old, and not yet        clarified.    27. Rabbi Meir said (43), \"Look not at the flask, but at what it  contains: there may be a new flask full of old wine, and an old flask  that has not even new wine in it\" (44).          (43) Some texts read \"Rabbi,\" _i.e._, Judah ha-Nasi (see        chapter II, n. 1).          (44) This verse expresses an opinion contrary to that of the        preceding one.  The mind of a young man may be more mature        than that of an old man.    28. R. Eleazar ha-Kappar (45) said, \"Envy, cupidity, and ambition take  a man from the world\" (46).          (45) A contemporary of Judah ha-Nasi.          (46) Cf. chapter II, 16.    29. He used to say, \"They that are born are doomed to die; and the  dead to be brought to life again; and the living to be judged, to  know, to make known, and to be made conscious that He is God, He the  Maker, He the Creator, He the Discerner (47), He the Judge, He the  Witness (48), He the Accuser; He it is that will in future judge,  blessed be He, with Whom there is no unrighteousness, nor  forgetfulness, nor respect of persons, nor taking of bribes (49); and  know also that everything is according to the reckoning (50); and let  not thy imagination give thee hope that the grave will be a place of  refuge for thee; for perforce thou wast formed, and perforce thou wast  born, and thou livest perforce, and perforce thou wilt die, and  perforce thou wilt in the future have to give account and reckoning  before the Supreme King of kings, the Holy One, blessed be He.\"          (47) Cf. Ps. XXXIII, 15: \"He fashioneth their hearts        altogether; he hath regard to all their works.\"          (48) Cf. Mal. III, 5.          (49) Cf. II Chron. XIX, 7: \"Take heed and act; for with the        Lord our God there is no injustice, nor respect for persons,        nor taking of bribes.\"  Maimonides interprets this verse of        _Abot_ as meaning that one cannot bribe God with good deeds in        order to have bad deeds forgiven.  The one bad deed is not        forgiven even by the doing of one hundred good ones, but        punishment is meted out for the bad deed and reward in full        for the hundred good ones.  That is, each action is judged        entirely on its own merits.  Neither is God a respecter of        persons.  On the one hand, He punished Moses for his anger at        the waters of Meribah, and, on the other, He rewarded Esau for        honoring his parents, and Nebuchadnezzar for honoring God.          (50) Maimonides interprets as follows, \"Think of the physical        things in which man has no choice, as our sages said, 'All is        in the power of God, except the fear of God.'  It is not said        that one must perforce, and against one's will, sin, or that        one is constrained to journey, walk, stand, etc., for these        are in the power of man, and are dependent upon his own free        will, and not upon any (external) compelling force, as we have        explained in chapter eight.\"  See Rawicz, _Commentar des        Maimonides_, p. 89, n. 4, and Garfinkle, _ibid._, p. 88 _et        seq._    Rabbi Chanania, the son of Akashia, said, \"The Holy One, blessed be  He, was pleased to make Israel worthy; wherefore He gave them a  copious _Torah_ and many commandments, as it is said, 'It pleased the  Lord, for his righteousness' sake, to magnify the _Torah_ and make it  honorable'\".                CHAPTER V    All Israel have a portion in the world to come, and it is said, \"And  thy people shall be all righteous; they shall inherit the land for  ever, the branch of my planting, the work of my hands, that I may be  glorified\".    1. With ten sayings the world was created.  What does this teach us?  Could it not have been created with one saying?  It is to make known  the punishment that will befall the wicked who destroy the world that  was created with ten sayings, as well as the goodly reward that will  be bestowed upon the just who preserve the world that was created with  ten sayings (1).  2. There were ten generations from Adam to Noah, to  make known how long-suffering God is, seeing that all those  generations continued provoking him, until he brought upon them the  waters of the flood (2).  3. There were ten generations from Noah to  Abraham, to make known how long-suffering God is, seeing that all  those generations continued provoking him, until Abraham, our father,  came, and received the reward they should all have earned (3).  4.  With ten trials our father Abraham was tried (4), and he stood firm in  them all, to make known how great was the love of our father Abraham  (5).  5. Ten miracles were wrought for our fathers in Egypt (6), and  ten at the Sea (7).  6. Ten plagues did the Holy One, blessed be He,  bring upon the Egyptians in Egypt, and ten at the Sea (8).  7. With  ten temptations did our fathers tempt the Holy One, blessed be He, in  the wilderness, as it is said, \"And they tempted me these ten times,  and have not hearkened to my voice\" (9).  8. Ten miracles were wrought  for our fathers in the Temple; no woman miscarried from the scent of  the holy"]]]
