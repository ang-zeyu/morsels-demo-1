Has any one opened the portals for you  to-day? Who was it? How did you get out? Tell me the truth, and you shall  not suffer for it; but deceive me, and there is no punishment that you  may not look for.\"    It is needless to say how I vowed and protested that I had never stirred;  that it was quite impossible; that I could not have done it if I would,  &c. I took all the saints to witness to my veracity, and swore I had  never seen the outside of his tremendous castle.    The monster had nothing to say to this; but I saw what he meant to do--I  saw that he would return instantly to the house of Ordauro, and ascertain  if the bride was there. Accordingly, the moment he turned the key on me,  I flew down the subterraneous passage, tossed on my new clothes like  lightning, and sat in my lover's house as before, waiting the arrival of  the panting old gentleman.    \"Well,\" exclaimed he, as soon as he set eyes upon me, \"never in all my  life--no--I must allow it to be impossible--never can my wife at home be  the lady sitting here.\"    From that day forth the old man, whenever he saw me in Ordauro's house,  treated me as if I were indeed his sister-in-law, though he never had the  heart to bring the two wives together, for fear of old recollections.  Nevertheless, this state of things was still very perilous; and my new  husband and myself lost no time in considering how we should put an end  to it by leaving the country. Ordauro resorted, as before, to a bold  expedient. He told Folderico that the air of the sea-coast disagreed  with him; and the old man, whose delight at getting rid of his neighbour  helped to blind him to the deceit, not only expedited the movement, but  offered to see him part of the way on his journey!    The offer was accepted. Six miles he rode forth with us, the stupid old  man; and then, taking his leave, to return home, we pushed our horses  like lightning, and so left him to tear his hair and his old beard with  cries and curses, as soon as he opened the door of his tower.        ARIOSTO:    Critical Notice of his Life and Genius.    CRITICAL NOTICE    OF    ARIOSTO'S LIFE AND GENIUS.[1]    The congenial spirits of Pulci and Boiardo may be said to have attained  to their height in the person of Ariosto, upon the principle of a  transmigration of souls, or after the fashion of that hero in romance,  who was heir to the bodily strengths of all whom he conquered.    Lodovico Giovanni Ariosto was born on the 8th of September, 1474, in the  fortress at Reggio, in Lombardy, and was the son of Niccolo Ariosto,  captain of that citadel (as Boiardo had been), and Daria Maleguzzi,  whose family still exists. The race was transplanted from Bologna in the  century previous, when Obizzo the Third of Este, Marquess of Ferrara,  married a lady belonging to it, whose Christian name was Lippa. Niccolo  Ariosto, besides holding the same office as Boiardo had done, at Modena  as well as at Reggio, was master of the household to his two successive  patrons, the Dukes Borso and Ercole. He was also employed, like him,  in diplomacy; and was made a count by the Emperor Frederick the Third,  though not, it seems, with remainder to his heirs.    Lodovico was the eldest of ten children, five sons and five daughters.  During his boyhood, theatrical entertainments were in great vogue at  court, as we have seen in the life of Boiardo; and at the age of twelve,  a year after the decease of that poet (who must have been well known to  him, and probably encouraged his attempts), his successor is understood  to have dramatised, after his infant fashion, the story of Pyramus and  Thisbe, and to have got his brothers and sisters to perform it. Panizzi  doubts the possibility of these precocious private theatricals; but  considering what is called \"writing\" on the part of children, and that  only one other performer was required in the piece, or at best a third  for the lion (which some little brother might have \"roared like any  sucking-dove\"), I cannot see good reason for disbelieving the story. Pope  was not twelve years old when he turned the siege of Troy into a play,  and got his school-fellows to perform it, the part of Ajax being given to  the gardener. Man is a theatrical animal ([Greek: zoon mimaetikon]), and  the instinct is developed at a very early period, as almost every family  can witness that has taken its children to the \"playhouse.\"    At fifteen the young poet, like so many others of his class, was  consigned to the study of the law, and took a great dislike to it. The  extreme mobility of his nature, and the wish to please his father, appear  to have made him enter on it willingly enough in the first instance;[2]  but as soon as he betrayed symptoms of disgust, Niccolo, whose affairs  were in a bad way, drove him back to it with a vehemence which must have  made bad worse.[3] At the expiration of five years he was allowed to give  it up.    There is reason to believe that Ariosto was \"theatricalising\" during  no little portion of this time; for, in his nineteenth year, he is  understood to have been taken by Duke Ercole to Pavia and to Milan,  either as a writer or performer of comedies, probably both, since the  courtiers and ducal family themselves occasionally appeared on the stage;  and one of the poet's brothers mentions his having frequently seen him  dressed in character.[4]    On being delivered from the study of the law, the young poet appears  to have led a cheerful and unrestrained life for the next four or five  years.    He wrote, or began to write, the comedy of the _Cassaria_; probably  meditated some poem in the style of Boiardo, then in the height of his  fame; and he cultivated the Latin language, and intended to learn Greek,  but delayed, and unfortunately missed it in consequence of losing his  tutor. Some of his happiest days were passed at a villa, still possessed  by the Maleguzzi family, called La Mauriziana, two miles from Reggio.  Twenty-five years afterwards he called to mind, with sighs, the pleasant  spots there which used to invite him to write verses; the garden, the  little river, the mill, the trees by the water-side, and all the other  shady places in which he enjoyed himself during that sweet season of his  life \"betwixt April and May.\"[5] To complete his happiness, he had a  friend and cousin, Pandolfo Ariosto, who loved every thing that he loved,  and for whom he augured a brilliant reputation.    But a dismal cloud was approaching. In his twenty-first year he lost  his father, and found a large family left on his hands in narrow  circumstances. The charge was at first so heavy, especially when  aggravated by the death of Pandolfo, that he tells us he wished to die.  He took to it manfully, however, in spite of these fits of gloom; and he  lived to see his admirable efforts rewarded; his brothers enabled to seek  their fortunes, and his sisters properly taken care of. Two of them, it  seems, had become nuns. A third married; and a fourth remained long in  his house. It is not known what became of the fifth.    In these family-matters the anxious son and brother was occupied for  three or four years, not, however, without recreating himself with his  verses, Latin and Italian, and recording his admiration of a number of  goddesses of his youth. He mentions, in particular, one of the name of  Lydia, who kept him often from \"his dear mother and household,\" and  who is probably represented by the princess of the same name in the  _Orlando_, punished in the smoke of Tartarus for being a jilt and  coquette.[6] His friend Bembo, afterwards the celebrated cardinal,  recommended him to be blind to such little immaterial points as ladies'  infidelities. But he is shocked at the advice. He was far more of  Othello's opinion than Congreve's in such matters; and declared, that he  would not have shared his mistress' good-will with Jupiter himself.[7]    Towards the year 1504, the poet entered the service of the unworthy  prince, Cardinal Ippolito of Este, brother of the new Duke of Ferrara,  Alfonso the First. His eminence, who had been made a prince of the church  at thirteen years of age by the infamous Alexander the Sixth (Borgia),  was at this period little more than one-and-twenty; but he took an active  part in the duke's affairs, both civil and military, and is said to  have made himself conspicuous in his father's lifetime for his vices and  brutality. He is charged with having ordered a papal messenger to be  severely beaten for bringing him some unpleasant despatches: which so  exasperated his unfortunate parent, that he was exiled to Mantua; and the  marquess of that city, his brother-in-law, was obliged to come to Ferrara  to obtain his pardon. But this was a trifle compared with what he  is accused of having done to one of his brothers. A female of their  acquaintance, in answer to a speech made her by the reverend gallant, had  been so unlucky as to say that she preferred his brother Giulio's eyes  to his eminence's whole body: upon which the monstrous villain hired two  ruffians to put out his brother's eyes; some say, was present at the  attempt. Attempt only it fortunately turned out to be, at least in part;  the opinion being, that the sight of one of the eyes was preserved.[8]    Party-spirit has so much to do with stories of princes, and princes are  so little in a condition to notice them, that, on the principle of  not condemning a man till he has been heard in his defence, an honest  biographer would be loath to credit these horrors of Cardinal Ippolito,  did not the violent nature of the times, and the general character of the  man, even with his defenders, incline him to do so. His being a soldier  rather than a churchman was a fault of the age, perhaps a credit to the  man, for he appears to have had abilities for war, and it was no crime of  his if he was"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/10657"],[0,"\"De Bello Gallico\" and Other Commentaries (#13)"],[1,"information: that the greater part of the Belgae were sprung from the  Germans, and that having crossed the Rhine at an early period, they had  settled there, on account of the fertility of the country, and had  driven out the Gauls who inhabited those regions; and that they were the  only people who, in the memory of our fathers, when all Gaul was  overrun, had prevented the Teutones and the Cimbri from entering their  territories; the effect of which was that, from the recollection of  those events, they assumed to themselves great authority and haughtiness  in military matters. The Remi said that they had known accurately  everything respecting their number, because, being united to them by  neighbourhood and by alliances, they had learnt what number each state  had in the general council of the Belgae promised for that war. That the  Bellovaci were the most powerful amongst them in valour, influence, and  number of men; that these could muster 100,000 armed men, [and had]  promised 60,000 picked men out of that number, and demanded for  themselves the command of the whole war. That the Suessiones were their  nearest neighbours and possessed a very extensive and fertile country;  that among them, even in our own memory, Divitiacus, the most powerful  man of all Gaul, had been king; who had held the government of a great  part of these regions, as well as of Britain; that their king at present  was Galba; that the direction of the whole war was conferred by the  consent of all upon him, on account of his integrity and prudence; that  they had twelve towns; that they had promised 50,000 armed men; and that  the Nervii, who are reckoned the most warlike among them, and are  situated at a very great distance, [had promised] as many; the  Atrebates, 15,000; the Ambiani, 10,000; the Morini, 25,000; the Menapu,  9000; the Caleti, 10,000; the Velocasses and the Veromandui as many; the  Aduatuci, 19,000; that the Condrusi, the Eburones, the Caeraesi, the  Paemani, who are called by the common name of Germans, [had promised],  they thought, to the number of 40,000.    V.--Caesar, having encouraged the Remi, and addressed them courteously,  ordered the whole senate to assemble before him, and the children of  their chief men to be brought to him as hostages; all which commands  they punctually performed by the day [appointed]. He, addressing himself  to Divitiacus the Aeduan, with great earnestness, points out how much it  concerns the republic and their common security, that the forces of the  enemy should be divided, so that it might not be necessary to engage  with so large a number at one time. [He asserts] that this might be  effected if the Aedui would lead their forces into the territories of  the Bellovaci, and begin to lay waste their country. With these  instructions he dismissed him from his presence. After he perceived that  all the forces of the Belgae, which had been collected in one place,  were approaching towards him, and learnt from the scouts whom he had  sent out, and [also] from the Remi, that they were not then far distant,  he hastened to lead his army over the Aisne, which is on the borders of  the Remi, and there pitched his camp. This position fortified one side  of his camp by the banks of the river, rendered the country which lay in  his rear secure from the enemy, and furthermore ensured that provisions  might without danger be brought to him by the Remi and the rest of the  states. Over that river was a bridge: there he places a guard; and on  the other side of the river he leaves Q. Titurus Sabinus, his  lieutenant, with six cohorts. He orders him to fortify a camp with a  rampart twelve feet in height, and a trench eighteen feet in breadth.    VI.--There was a town of the Remi, by name Bibrax, eight miles distant  from this camp. This the Belgae on their march began to attack with  great vigour. [The assault] was with difficulty sustained for that day.  The Gauls' mode of besieging is the same as that of the Belgae: when  after having drawn a large number of men around the whole of the  fortifications, stones have begun to be cast against the wall on all  sides, and the wall has been stript of its defenders, [then], forming a  testudo, they advance to the gates and undermine the wall: which was  easily effected on this occasion; for while so large a number were  casting stones and darts, no one was able to maintain his position upon  the wall. When night had put an end to the assault, Iccius, who was then  in command of the town, one of the Remi, a man of the highest rank and  influence amongst his people, and one of those who had come to Caesar as  ambassador [to sue] for a peace, sends messengers to him, [to report]  \"That, unless assistance were sent to him, he could not hold out any  longer.\"    VII.--Thither immediately after midnight, Caesar, using as guides the  same persons who had come to him as messengers from Iccius, sends some  Numidian and Cretan archers, and some Balearian slingers as a relief to  the townspeople, by whose arrival both a desire to resist together with  the hope of [making good their] defence was infused into the Remi, and,  for the same reason, the hope of gaining the town abandoned the enemy.  Therefore, after staying a short time before the town, and laying waste  the country of the Remi, when all the villages and buildings which they  could approach had been burnt, they hastened with all their forces to  the camp of Caesar, and encamped within less than two miles [of it]; and  their camp, as was indicated by the smoke and fires, extended more than  eight miles in breadth.    VIII.--Caesar at first determined to decline a battle, as well on  account of the great number of the enemy as their distinguished  reputation for valour: daily, however, in cavalry actions, he strove to  ascertain by frequent trials what the enemy could effect by their  prowess and what our men would dare. When he perceived that our men were  not inferior, as the place before the camp was naturally convenient and  suitable for marshalling an army (since the hill where the camp was  pitched, rising gradually from the plain, extended forward in breadth as  far as the space which the marshalled army could occupy, and had steep  declines of its side in either direction, and gently sloping in front  gradually sank to the plain), on either side of that hill he drew a  cross trench of about four hundred paces, and at the extremities of that  trench built forts, and placed there his military engines, lest, after  he had marshalled his army, the enemy, since they were so powerful in  point of number, should be able to surround his men in the flank, while  fighting. After doing this, and leaving in the camp the two legions  which he had last raised, that, if there should be any occasion, they  might be brought as a reserve, he formed the other six legions in order  of battle before the camp. The enemy, likewise, had drawn up their  forces which they had brought out of the camp.    IX.--There was a marsh of no great extent between our army and that of  the enemy. The latter were waiting to see if our men would pass this;  our men, also, were ready in arms to attack them while disordered, if  the first attempt to pass should be made by them. In the meantime battle  was commenced between the two armies by a cavalry action. When neither  army began to pass the marsh, Caesar, upon the skirmishes of the horse  [proving] favourable to our men, led back his forces into the camp. The  enemy immediately hastened from that place to the river Aisne, which it  has been stated was behind our camp. Finding a ford there, they  endeavoured to lead a part of their forces over it; with the design,  that, if they could, they might carry by storm the fort which Q.  Titurius, Caesar's lieutenant, commanded, and might cut off the bridge;  but, if they could not do that, they should lay waste the lands of the  Remi, which were of great use to us in carrying on the war, and might  hinder our men from foraging.    X.--Caesar, being apprised of this by Titurius, leads all his cavalry  and light-armed Numidians, slingers and archers, over the bridge, and  hastens towards them. There was a severe struggle in that place. Our  men, attacking in the river the disordered enemy, slew a great part of  them. By the immense number of their missiles they drove back the rest,  who in a most courageous manner were attempting to pass over their  bodies, and surrounded with their cavalry, and cut to pieces those who  had first crossed the river. The enemy, when they perceived that their  hopes had deceived them both with regard to their taking the town by  storm and also their passing the river, and did not see our men advance  to a more disadvantageous place for the purpose of fighting, and when  provisions began to fail them, having called a council, determined that  it was best for each to return to his country, and resolved to assemble  from all quarters to defend those into whose territories the Romans  should first march an army; that they might contend in their own rather  than in a foreign country, and might enjoy the stores of provisions  which they possessed at home. Together with other causes, this  consideration also led them to that resolution, viz.: that they had  learnt that Divitiacus and the Aedui were approaching the territories of  the Bellovaci. And it was impossible to persuade the latter to stay any  longer, or to deter them from conveying succour to their own people.    XI.--That matter being determined on, marching out of their camp at the  second watch, with great noise and confusion, in no fixed order, nor  under any command, since each sought for himself the foremost place in  the journey, and hastened to reach home, they made their departure  appear very like a flight. Caesar, immediately learning this through his  scouts, [but] fearing an ambuscade, because he had not yet discovered  for what"]]]
