Duodecim annós, accusative of duration of time.    11. Eurystheó. The English verb 'serve' is transitive, but _servió_ ('be  subject to') is intransitive and takes an indirect object.    14. quae. See the note on line 1. What is the case of quae?    16. Prímum is chiefly used in enumeration, prímó (line 6) in contrasting  an action or state with one that follows it.    19. sécum. The preposition _cum_ follows and is joined to the reflexive  and personal pronouns, usually also to the relative pronoun.    22. neque enim. See the note on 7, 12.    26. respírandí, the genitive of the gerund. It modifies facultás. The  gerund corresponds to the English verbal noun in _-ing_.    13. 5. Hóc. We might expect _haec_ referring to Hydram, but a  demonstrative pronoun is commonly attracted into the gender of the  predicate noun (here mónstrum).    cui erant, 'which had,' literally 'to which there were.' This  construction is found only with _sum_. It is called the dative of  possession.    8. rés. In rendering this word choose always with great freedom the most  suitable English word.    13. 8. mágní perículí. We say 'one of great danger.'    9. éius. What possessive would be used to modify sinistrá?    11. hóc cónátú, ablative of separation.    14. comprehendérunt. See the note on 3, 13.    unde = _ex quibus_.    16. auxilió Hydrae, 'to the aid of the Hydra,' but literally for aid  (i.e. as aid) to the Hydra,' for Hydrae is dative. This is called the  double dative construction, auxilió the dative of purpose, and Hydrae the  dative of reference, i.e. the dative denoting the person interested.    17. abscídit. See the note on 4, 25.    mordébat, 'kept biting,' the imperfect of repeated action.    18. tálí modó. See the note on 9, 13.    interfécit. We have now had several verbs meaning 'kill.' _Interfició_ is  the most general of these; _necó_ (line 4) is used of killing by unusual  or cruel means, as by poison; _occídó_ (12, 23) is most commonly used of  the 'cutting down' of an enemy in battle.    19. reddidit, as well as imbuit, has sagittás for its object, but we must  translate as if we had _eás_ with reddidit.    22. ad sé. Compare this construction with the use of the dative in 4, 2.  Notice that sé does not refer to Herculem, the subject of referre, but to  Eurystheus, the subject of Iussit. When the reflexive thus refers to the  subject of the principal verb rather than to the subject of the  subordinate verb with which it s directly connected, it is called  indirect.    23. tantae audáciae. The genitive of description, like the ablative of  description, consists always of a noun with some modifying word. Compare  _specié horribilí_, 4, 14.    autem. Compare 5, 8 and 10, 21.    24. incrédibilí celeritáte, ablative of description.    25. vestígiís, ablative of means.    26. ipsum, contrasts cervum with vestígiís.    27. omnibus víribus. See the note on 10, 2.    14. 1. currébat, 'he kept running.'    sibi, dative of reference. It need not be translated,    ad quiétem, 'for rest.' Purpose is frequently thus expressed by _ad_.    3. cucurrerat. The pluperfect is sometimes used with postquam when the  lapse of time is denoted.    4. cursú, ablative of cause.    exanimátum = _quí exanimátus erat_. The participle is often equivalent to  a relative clause.    5. rettulit. See the note on 13, 19.    8. rem. See the note on _rés_, 13, 8.    10. apró, dative of indirect object after the compound verb (_ob +  curró_).    11. tímóre perterritus. It is not necessary to translate both words.    13. iniécit, i.e. upon the boar.    summá cum difficultáte. Compare this with _omnibus víribus_, 13, 27, and  notice that _cum_ may be omitted with the ablative of manner when there  is an adjective. For the position of cum, see the note on 11, 25.    15. ad Eurystheum. We are told elsewhere that Eurystheus was so  frightened when he saw the boar that he hid in a cask.    vívus. Why have we the nominative here, but the accusative (vívum) in  line 5?    17. quartó. The capture of the Erymanthian boar is usually given as the  third labor and the capture of the Cerynean stag as the fourth.    nárrávimus. The writer sometimes uses the first person plural in speaking  of himself, instead of the first person singular. This is called the  plural of modesty, and is the same as the English usage.    18. in Arcadiam. How does this differ in meaning from _in Arcadiá_?    20. appeteret. The subjunctive introduced by cum, 'since,' may express  the reason for the action of the main verb.    23. Herculés. See the note on _Perseus_, 4, 4.    26. quod, conjunction, not pronoun.    reliquós centaurós, 'the rest of the centaurs,' 'the other centaurs.'  Compare _mediá nocte_, 9, 5. Notice that _reliquí_ means about the same  as _céterí_, and see the note on 4, 13.    28. inquit, historical present. This verb is used parenthetically with  direct quotations.    15. 1. dabó. Notice that Latin is more exact than English in the use of  the future tense in subordinate clauses. In English we often use the  present in the subordinate clause and leave it to the principal verb to  show that the time is future.    7. pervénérunt. See the note on 4, 26.    10. cónstitit, from _cónsistó_, not _cónstó_.    16. fugá. Latin says 'by flight,' not 'in flight.'    17. ex spéluncá. See the note on 10, 3.    21. locum, the direct object of Adiit, which is here transitive. We might  also have _ad locum_ with _adeó_ used intransitively.    16. 4. Herculí. See the note on 10, 15.    labórem. This labor is usually given as the sixth, the destruction of the  Stymphalian birds as the fifth.    6. tria mília boum, 'three thousand cattle,' literally 'three thousands  of cattle.' The partitive genitive is the regular construction with the  plural _mília_, but the singular _mílle_ is commonly used as an  adjective, like English 'thousand.' Thus 'one thousand cattle' would be  _mílle bovés_.    7. ingentís mágnitúdinis. See the note on _tantae audáciae_, 13, 23.    8. neque enim umquam, 'for ... never.' See the note on _neque enim_, 7,  12.    11. multae operae. See the note on _mágní perículí_, 13, 8.    12. duodévígintí pedum, i.e. in width.    dúxit. This word is used with reference to the progress of work on a wall  or ditch from one end of it to the other.    15. opus. Compare this word with operae and labóre, line 12. _Labor_ is  used of heavy or exhausting labor, _opera_ of voluntary exertion or  effort, _opus_ of that upon which one labors or of the completed work.    17. imperáverat. This verb takes an indirect object to express the person  ordered (eí). The action commanded is expressed by the subjunctive in a  clause introduced by _ut_ and used as the object of _imperó_ (ut  necáret). Notice that this may be translated 'that he should kill' or 'to  kill.' Compare now the construction with _iubeó_, 13, 22, with which the  command is expressed by the accusative and infinitive (_Herculem  referre_).    19. carne. _Véscor_ is an intransitive verb and governs the ablative.    22. appropinquandí. See the note on 12, 26.    23. cónstitit, from _cónstó_. Compare 15, 10.    pedibus, 'on foot,' literally 'by his feet.'    25. consúmpsisset. The imperfect and pluperfect tenses of the subjunctive  are used with cum, 'when,' to describe the circumstances of the action of  the main verb. Compare 14, 20, and the note.    26. hóc cónátú. See the note on 13, 11.    27. peteret. The subjunctive is used with ut to express purpose. The best  translation is usually the infinitive ('to ask'), but the Latin  infinitive is not used in model prose to express purpose.    17. 3. ávolárent. This is not subjunctive of purpose, but of result, as  is indicated by tam.    6. ex. Compare this with _ab_, 16, 21, and _dé_, 16, 13. We commonly  translate all of these 'from,' but the real meanings are 'out of,' 'away  from,' and 'down from' respectively.    Crétá. See the note on 3, 12.    7. esset. See the note on 14, 20.    8. ínsulae, dative with the compound verb (_ad_ + _propinquó_).    appropinquáret. See the note on 16, 25.    9. tanta ... ut. Notice how frequently the clause of result is connected  with a demonstrative word in the main clause.    12. návigandí imperítus, 'ignorant of navigation,' 'inexperienced in  sailing.' See the note on 12, 26.    21. cum, the conjunction.    ingentí labóre. See the note on _summá cum difficultáte_, 14, 13.    25. ut redúceret. See the note on 16, 27.    26. carne. See the note on 16, 19.    véscébantur, imperfect of customary action.    18. 3. ut tráderentur. Notice that _postuló_, like _imperó_, takes an  object-clause introduced by _ut_ and having its verb in the subjunctive.    sibi, the indirect reflexive. See the note on 13, 22.    4. írá ... interfécit, 'became furiously angry and killed the king,'  literally 'moved by wrath killed the king.' The participle is frequently  best rendered by a finite verb.    18. 4. cadáver. The subject of an infinitive stands in the accusative  case. We might translate here 'and gave orders that his body should be  thrown.' See the note on 16, 17.    6. míra rérum commútátió. When a noun has both an adjective and a  genitive modifier, this order of the words is common.    7. cum cruciátú, ablative of manner.    necáverat. See the note on _interfécit_, 13, 18.    10. referébant. See the note on 6, 16.    modo. This is the adverb, not a case of _modus_, the dative and ablative  singular of which would be _modó_. Make a practice of carefully observing  the quantity of vowels.    11. órábant. Notice that this verb, like _imperó_ and _postuló_, takes  _ut_ and the subjunctive.    14. ad návigandum. See the note on _ad quiétem_, 14, 1.    16. post, here an adverb of time.    18. dícitur. Notice that the Latin construction is personal ('the nation  is said to have consisted'), while English commonly has the impersonal  construction ('it is said that the nation consisted').    19. reí"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/8998"],[0,"Paris as It Was and as It Is (#12)"],[1,"eventy-eight  feet[2] in extent, called the _New Louvre_, consists in two double  façades, which are still unfinished. LE VEAU, and after him D'ORBAY,  were the architects under whose direction this augmentation was made  by order of Lewis XIV.    That king at first resolved to continue the _Louvre_ on the plan  begun by Francis I.: for some time he caused it to be pursued, but  having conceived a more grand and magnificent design, he ordered the  foundation of the superb edifice now standing, to be laid on the 17th  of October 1665, under the administration of COLBERT.    Through a natural prejudice, Lewis XIV. thought that he could find no  where but in Italy an artist sufficiently skilful to execute his  projects of magnificence. He sent for the Cavaliere BERNINI from  Rome. This artist, whose reputation was established, was received in  France with all the pomp due to princes of the blood. The king  ordered that, in the towns through which he might pass, he should be  complimented and receive presents from the corporations, &c.    BERNINI was loaded with wealth and honours: notwithstanding the  prepossession of the court in favour of this Italian architect,  notwithstanding his talents, he did not succeed in his enterprise.  After having forwarded the foundation of this edifice, he made a  pretext of the impossibility of spending the winter in a climate  colder than that of Italy. \"He was promised,\" says St. Foix, \"three  thousand louis a year if he would stay; but,\" he said, \"he would  positively go and die in his _own_ country.\" On the eve of his  departure, the king sent him three thousand louis, with the grant of  a pension of five hundred. He received the whole with great coolness.    Several celebrated architects now entered the lists to complete this  grand undertaking.--MANSARD presented his plans, with which COLBERT  was extremely pleased: the king also approved of them, and absolutely  insisted on their being executed without any alteration. MANSARD  replied that he would rather renounce the glory of building this  edifice than the liberty of correcting himself, and changing his  design when he thought he could improve it. Among the competitors was  CLAUDE PERRAULT, that physician so defamed by Boileau, the poet. His  plans were preferred, and merited the preference. Many pleasantries  were circulated at the expense of the new medical architect; and  PERRAULT replied to those sarcasms by producing the beautiful  colonnade of the _Louvre_, the master-piece of French architecture,  and the admiration of all Europe.    The façade of this colonnade, which is of the Corinthian order; is  five hundred and twenty-five feet in length: it is divided into two  peristyles and three avant-corps. The principal gate is in the centre  avant-corps, which is decorated with eight double columns, crowned by  a pediment, whose raking cornices are composed of two stones only,  each fifty-four feet in length by eight in breadth, though no more  than eighteen inches in thickness. They were taken from the quarries  of Meudon, and formed but one single block, which was sawed into two.  The other two avant-corps are ornamented by six pilasters, and two  columns of the same order, and disposed in the same manner. On the  top, in lieu of a ridged roof, is a terrace, bordered by a stone  balustrade, the pedestals of which are intended to bear trophies  intermixed with vases.    PERRAULT'S enemies disputed with him the invention of this  master-piece. They maintained that it belonged to LE VEAU, the  architect; but, since the discovery of the original manuscript and  drawings of PERRAULT, there no longer remains a doubt respecting  the real author of this beautiful production.    In front of this magnificent colonnade, a multitude of salesmen erect  their stalls, and there display quantities of old clothes, rags, &c.  This contrast, as Mercier justly remarks, still speaks to the eye of  the attentive observer. It is the image of all the rest, grandeur and  beggary, side by side.    However, it is not on the _outside_ of these walls only, that beggary  has been so nearly allied to grandeur. At least we have a solitary  instance of this truth of a very sinking nature.    Cardinal de Retz tells us, that going one morning to the _Louvre_ to  see the Queen of England, he found her in the chamber of her  daughter, aftenwards Dutchess of Orleans, and that she said to him:  \"You see, I come to keep Henriette company: the poor girl could not  leave her bed to-day, for want of fuel.\"--It is true, he adds, that,  for six months past Cardinal Mazarin had not paid her pension; the  tradesmen, would no longer give her credit, and she had not a piece  of wood to warm her.    Like St. Paul's in London, the façade of the _Louvre_ cannot be seen  to the best advantage, on account of the proximity of the surrounding  buildings; and, like many other great undertakings too, will,  probably, never be completed, but remain a monument of the fickleness  of the nation.    Lewis XIV, after having for a long time made the _Louvre_ his  residence; abandoned it for _Versailles_: \"Sire,\" said Dufreny once  to that prince, \"I never look at the _New Louvre_, without  exclaiming, superb monument of the magnificence of our greatest  kings, you would have been finished, had you been given to one of the  begging orders of friars!\" From that period, the _Louvre_ was wholly  consecrated to the sittings of different academies, and to the  accommodation of several men of science and artists, to whom free  apartments were allotted.    I much regret having, for this year at least, lost a sight here,  which I should have viewed with no inconsiderable degree of  attention. This is the    PUBLIC EXHIBITION OF THE PRODUCTIONS OF FRENCH INDUSTRY.    Under the directorial government, this exhibition was opened in the  _Champ de Mars_; but it now takes place, annually, in the square of  the _Louvre_, during the five complementary days of the republican  calendar; namely, from the 18th to the 22d of September, both  inclusive.    The exhibition not only includes manufactures of every sort, but also  every new discovery, invention, and improvement. For the purpose of  displaying these objects to advantage, temporary buildings are  erected along the four interior walls of this square, each of which  are subdivided into twenty-five porticoes; so that the whole square  of the _Louvre_, during that period, represents a fair with a hundred  booths. The resemblance, I am told, is rendered still more perfect by  the prodigious crowd; persons of all ranks being indiscriminately  admitted to view these productions. Precautions, however, are taken  to prevent the indiscreet part of the public from rushing into the  porticoes, and sentinels are posted at certain intervals to preserve  order.    This, undoubtedly, is a very laudable institution, and extremely well  calculated to excite emulation in the national manufactures,  specimens of which being sent from all the principal manufacturing  towns, the hundred porticoes may be said to comprise an epitome of  the present state of all the flourishing manufactures of France.  Indeed, none but new inventions and articles of finished workmanship,  the fabrication of which is known, are suffered to make part of the  exhibition. Even these are not admitted till after a previous  examination, and on the certificate of a private jury of five  members, appointed for that purpose by the prefect of each  department. A new jury, composed of fifteen members, nominated by the  Minister of the Interior, again examine the different articles  admitted; and agreeably to their decision, the government award  premiums and medals to those persons who have made the greatest  improvement in any particular fabric or branch of industry, or  produced any new discovery or invention. The successful candidates  are presented to the Chief Consul by the Minister of the Interior,  and have the honour of dining with him at his public monthly dinner.    From all that I can learn concerning this interesting exhibition, it  appears, that, though the useful arts, in general, cannot at present  be put in competition here with those of a similar description among  us, the object of the French government is to keep up a spirit of  rivalship, and encourage, by every possible means, the improvement of  those manufactures in which England is acknowledged to surpass other  countries.    I am reminded that it is time to prepare for going out to dinner. I  must therefore not leave this letter, like the _Louvre_, unfinished.  Fortunately, my good friend, the prevailing fashion here is to dine  very late, which leaves me a long morning; but for this, I know not  when I should have an opportunity of writing long letters. Restrain  then your impatience, and I promise that you shall very shortly be  ushered into the GALLERY OF ANTIQUES,      \"Where the smooth chisel all its force has shewn,    And soften'd into flesh the rugged stone.\"    [Footnote 1: _Essais historiques sur Paris_.]    [Footnote 2: It may be necessary to observe that, throughout these  letters, we always speak of French feet. The English foot is to the  French as 12 to 12.789, or as 4 to 4.263.]        LETTER VII.    _Paris, October 28, 1801._    Having, in my last letter, described to you the outside of the  _Louvre_, (with the exception of the Great Gallery, of which I shall  speak more at length in another place), I shall now proceed to give  you an account of some of the principal national establishments  contained within its walls.    Before the revolution, the _Louvre_ was, as I have said, the seat of  different academies, such as the _French Academy_, the _Academy of  Sciences_, the _Academy of Inscriptions and Belles Lettres_, the  _Academy of Painting and Sculpture_, and the _Academy of  Architecture_. All these are replaced by the _National Institute of  Arts and Sciences_, of which, however, I shall"]]]
