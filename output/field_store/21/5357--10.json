Not only  the Aztecs, but the Mayas of Yucatan and the Kiches and Cakchiquels of  Guatemala bewailed, in woful songs, the loss to them of that beautiful  land, and counted its destruction as a common starting point in their  annals.[1] Well might they regret it, for not again would they find its  like. In that land the crop of maize never failed, and the ears grew as  long as a man's arm; the cotton burst its pods, not white only, but  naturally of all beautiful colors, scarlet, green, blue, orange, what you  would; the gourds could not be clasped in the arms; birds of beauteous  plumage filled the air with melodious song. There was never any want nor  poverty. All the riches of the world were there, houses built of silver  and precious jade, of rosy mother of pearl and of azure turquoises. The  servants of the great king Quetzalcoatl were skilled in all manner of  arts; when he sent them forth they flew to any part of the world with  infinite speed; and his edicts were proclaimed from the summit of the  mountain Tzatzitepec, the Hill of Shouting, by criers of such mighty voice  that they could be heard a hundred leagues away.[2] His servants and  disciples were called \"Sons of the Sun\" and \"Sons of the Clouds.\"[3]    [Footnote 1: The _Books of Chilan Balam_, of the Mayas, the _Record from  Tecpan Atitlan_, of the Cakchiquels, and the _Popol vuh_, National Book,  of the Kiches, have much to say about Tulan. These works were all written  at a very early date, by natives, and they have all been preserved in the  original tongues, though unfortunately only the last mentioned has been  published.]    [Footnote 2: Sahagun, _Historia_, Lib. iii, cap. iii.]    [Footnote 3: Duran, _Historia de los Indios_, in Kingsborough, vol. viii,  p. 267.]    Where, then, was this marvelous land and wondrous city? Where could it be  but where the Light-God is on his throne, where the life-giving sun is  ever present, where are the mansions of the day, and where all nature  rejoices in the splendor of its rays?    But this is more than in one spot. It may be in the uppermost heavens,  where light is born and the fleecy clouds swim easily; or in the west,  where the sun descends to his couch in sanguine glory; or in the east,  beyond the purple rim of the sea, whence he rises refreshed as a giant to  run his course; or in the underworld, where he passes the night.    Therefore, in ancient Cakchiquel legend it is said: \"Where the sun rises,  there is one Tulan; another is in the underworld; yet another where the  sun sets; and there is still another, and there dwells the God. Thus, O my  children, there are four Tulans, as the ancient men have told us.\"[1]    [Footnote 1: Francisco Ernantez Arana Xahila, _Memorial de Tecpan  Atitlan_. MS. in Cakchiquel, in my possession.]    The most venerable traditions of the Maya race claimed for them a  migration from \"Tollan in Zuyva.\" \"Thence came we forth together,\" says  the Kiche myth, \"there was the common parent of our race, thence came we,  from among the Yaqui men, whose god is Yolcuat Quetzalcoat.\"[1] This  Tollan is certainly none other than the abode of Quetzalcoatl, named in an  Aztec manuscript as _Zivena vitzcatl_, a word of uncertain derivation, but  applied to the highest heaven.    [Footnote 1: _Le Popol Vuh_, p. 247. The name _Yaqui_ means in Kiche  civilized or polished, and was applied to the Aztecs, but it is, in its  origin, from an Aztec root _yauh_, whence _yaque_, travelers, and  especially merchants. The Kiches recognizing in the Aztec merchants a  superior and cultivated class of men, adopted into their tongue the name  which the merchants gave themselves, and used the word in the above sense.  Compare Sahagun, _Historia de Nueva Espana_, Lib. ix, cap. xii.]    Where Quetzalcoatl finally retired, and whence he was expected back, was  still a Tollan--Tollan Tlapallan--and Montezuma, when he heard of the  arrival of the Spaniards, exclaimed, \"It is Quetzalcoatl, returned from  Tula.\"    The cities which selected him as their tutelary deity were named for that  which he was supposed to have ruled over. Thus we have Tollan and  Tollantzinco (\"behind Tollan\") in the Valley of Mexico, and the pyramid  Cholula was called \"Tollan-Cholollan,\" as well as many other Tollans and  Tulas among the Nahuatl colonies.    The natives of the city of Tula were called, from its name, the _Tolteca_,  which simply means \"those who dwell in Tollan.\" And who, let us ask, were  these Toltecs?    They have hovered about the dawn of American history long enough. To them  have been attributed not only the primitive culture of Central America and  Mexico, but of lands far to the north, and even the earthworks of the Ohio  Valley. It is time they were assigned their proper place, and that is  among the purely fabulous creations of the imagination, among the giants  and fairies, the gnomes and sylphs, and other such fancied beings which in  all ages and nations the popular mind has loved to create.    Toltec, Toltecatl,[1] which in later days came to mean a skilled craftsman  or artificer, signifies, as I have said, an inhabitant of Tollan--of the  City of the Sun--in other words, a Child of Light. Without a metaphor, it  meant at first one of the far darting, bright shining rays of the sun. Not  only does the tenor of the whole myth show this, but specifically and  clearly the powers attributed to the ancient Toltecs. As the immediate  subjects of the God of Light they were called \"Those who fly the whole day  without resting,\"[2] and it was said of them that they had the power of  reaching instantly even a very distant place. When the Light-God himself  departs, they too disappear, and their city is left uninhabited and  desolate.    [Footnote 1: Toltecatl, according to Molina, is \"oficial de arte mecanica  o maestro,\" (_Vocabulario de la Lengua Mexicana_, s.v.). This is a  secondary meaning. Veitia justly says, \"Toltecatl quiere decir artifice,  porque en Thollan comenzaron a ensenar, aunque a Thollan llamaron Tula, y  por decir Toltecatl dicen Tuloteca\" (_Historia_, cap. xv).]    [Footnote 2: Their title was _Tlanqua cemilhuique_, compounded of  _tlanqua_, to set the teeth, as with strong determination, and  _cemilhuitia_, to run during a whole day. Sahagun, _Historia_, Lib. iii,  cap. iii, and Lib. x, cap. xxix; compare also the myth of Tezcatlipoca  disguised as an old woman parching corn, the odor of which instantly  attracted the Toltecs, no matter how far off they were. When they came she  killed them. Id. Lib. iii, cap. xi.]    In some, and these I consider the original versions of the myth, they do  not constitute a nation at all, but are merely the disciples or servants  of Quetzalcoatl.[1] They have all the traits of beings of supernatural  powers. They were astrologers and necromancers, marvelous poets and  philosophers, painters as were not to be found elsewhere in the world, and  such builders that for a thousand leagues the remains of their cities,  temples and fortresses strewed the land. \"When it has happened to me,\"  says Father Duran, \"to ask an Indian who cut this pass through the  mountains, or who opened that spring of water, or who built that old ruin,  the answer was, 'The Toltecs, the disciples of Papa.'\"[2]    [Footnote 1: \"Discipulos,\" Duran, _Historia_, in Kingsborough, vol. vii,  p. 260.]    [Footnote 2: Ibid.]    They were tall in stature, beyond the common race of men, and it was  nothing uncommon for them to live hundreds of years. Such was their energy  that they allowed no lazy person to live among them, and like their master  they were skilled in every art of life and virtuous beyond the power of  mortals. In complexion they are described as light in hue, as was their  leader, and as are usually the personifications of light, and not the less  so among the dark races of men.[1]    [Footnote 1: For the character of the Toltecs as here portrayed, see  Ixtlilxochitl, _Relaciones Historicas_, and Veitia, _Historia, passion_.]    When Quetzalcoatl left Tollan most of the Toltecs had already perished by  the stratagems of Tezcatlipoca, and those that survived were said to have  disappeared on his departure. The city was left desolate, and what became  of its remaining inhabitants no one knew. But this very uncertainty  offered a favorable opportunity for various nations, some speaking Nahuatl  and some other tongues, to claim descent from this mysterious, ancient and  wondrous race.    The question seems, indeed, a difficult one. When the Light-God disappears  from the sky, shorn of his beams and bereft of his glory, where are the  bright rays, the darting gleams of light which erewhile bathed the earth  in refulgence? Gone, gone, we know not whither.    The original home of the Toltecs was said to have been in Tlapallan--the  very same Red Land to which Quetzalcoatl was fabled to have returned; only  the former was distinguished as Old Tlapallan--Hue Tlapallan--as being  that from which he and they had emerged. Other myths called it the Place  of Sand, Xalac, an evident reference to the sandy sea strand, the same  spot where it was said that Quetzalcoatl was last seen, beyond which the  sun rises and below which he sinks. Thither he returned when driven from  Tollan, and reigned over his vassals many years in peace.[1]    [Footnote 1: \"Se metio (Quetzalcoatl) la tierra adentro hasta Tlapallan o  segun otros Huey Xalac, antigua patria de sus antepasados, en donde vivio  muchos anos.\" Ixtlilxochitl, _Relaciones Historicas_, p. 394, in  Kingsborough, vol. ix. Xalac, is from _xalli_, sand, with the locative  termination. In Nahuatl _xalli aquia_, to enter the sand, means to die.]    We cannot mistake this Tlapallan, new or old. Whether it is bathed in the  purple and gold of the rising sun or in the crimson and carnation of his  setting, it always was, as Sahagun tells us, with all needed distinctness,  \"the city of the Sun,\" the"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/11039"],[0,"A Woman's Journey Round the World (#13)"],[1,"mark of  confidence on the part of the owners towards travellers.  Arrived at  their destination the animals are delivered up at a certain place  fixed on by the proprietor.  We preferred, however, to take a  muleteer with us, as we were not acquainted with the road, a piece  of precaution we regretted the less, on finding the way frequently  obstructed with wooden gates, which had always to be opened and shut  again.    The price for hiring a mule was twelve milreis (1 pounds 6s.).    As we arrived at Porto Sampajo by 2 o'clock, we resolved on going on  as far as Ponte do Pinheiro, a distance of sixteen miles.  The road  lay mostly through valleys covered with large bushes and surrounded  by low rocks.  The country wore a general aspect of wildness, and  only here and there were a few scanty pasture-grounds and poverty-  stricken huts to be seen.    The little town of Ponte de Cairas, which we passed, consists of a  few shops and vendas, a number of smaller houses, an inconsiderable  church, and an apothecary's; the principal square looked like a  meadow.  Ponte do Pinheiro is rather larger.  We experienced here a  very good reception, and had an excellent supper, consisting of  fowls stewed in rice, flour of manioc, and Portuguese wine; we had  also good beds and breakfasts; the whole cost us, however, four  milreis (8s. 8d.).    3rd October.  We did not set off till 7 o'clock:  here, as  everywhere else in the country, there is no getting away early in  the morning.    The scenery was of the same character as that passed the day before,  except that we were approaching the more lofty mountains.  The road  was tolerably good, but the bridges across the streams and sloughs  execrable; we esteemed ourselves fortunate whenever we passed one  without being compelled to stop.  After a ride of three hours (nine  miles), we reached the great Sugar-Fazenda {38} de Collegio, which  in its arrangements is exactly like a large country seat.  To the  spacious residence is attached a chapel, with the offices lying all  around; the whole is enclosed by a high wall.    Far and wide stretched the fields and low eminences, covered with  sugar canes:  unfortunately, we could not see the mode of preparing  the sugar, as the canes were not yet ripe.    A planter's fortune in the Brazils is calculated by the number of  his slaves.  There were eight hundred of them on the plantation we  were viewing--a large property, since each male slave costs from six  to seven hundred milreis (60 to 70 pounds).    Not far from this fazenda, to the right of the high road, lies  another very considerable one, called Papagais; besides these we saw  several smaller plantations, which lent a little animation to the  uniformity of the scene.    St. Anna (sixteen miles distance) is a small place, consisting of  only a few poor houses, a little church, and an apothecary's; the  last is a necessary appendage to every Brazilian village, even  though it only contains twelve or fifteen huts.  We here made a  repast of eggs with a bottle of wine, and gave our mules a feed of  mil, for which a cheating landlord, Herr Gebhart, charged us three  milreis (6s. 6d.)    Today we did not proceed further than Mendoza (twelve miles), a  still more insignificant place than St. Anna.  A small shop and a  venda were the only houses at the road-side, though in the  background we perceived a manioc-fazenda, to which we paid a visit.  The proprietor was kind enough first to offer us some strong coffee,  without milk (a customary mark of attention in the Brazils), and  then to conduct us over his plantation.    The manioc plant shoots out stalks from four to six feet in height,  with a number of large leaves at their upper extremities.  The  valuable portion of the plant is its bulbous root, which often  weighs two or three pounds, and supplies the place of corn all  through the Brazils.  It is washed, peeled, and held against the  rough edge of a millstone, turned by a negro, until it is completely  ground away.  The whole mass is then gathered into a basket,  plentifully steeped in water, and is afterwards pressed quite dry by  means of a press.  Lastly it is scattered upon large iron plates,  and slowly dried by a gentle fire kept up beneath.  It now resembles  a very coarse kind of flour; and is eaten in two ways--wet and dry.  In the first case, it is mixed with hot water until it forms a kind  of porridge; in the second, it is handed round, under the form of  coarse flour, in little baskets, and every one at table takes as  much as he chooses, and sprinkles it over his plate.    4th October.  The mountain ranges continue drawing nearer and nearer  to each other, and the woods become thicker and more luxuriant.  The  various creeping plants are indescribably beautiful:  not only do  they entirely cover the ground, but they are so intertwined with the  trees that their lovely flowers hang on the highest branches, and  look like the blossoms of the trees themselves.  But there are  likewise trees whose own yellow and red blossoms resemble the most  beautiful flowers; while there are others whose great white leaves  stand out like silver from the surrounding mass of flowery green.  Woods like these might well be called \"the giant gardens of the  world.\"  The palm-trees have here almost disappeared.    We soon reached the mountain range we had to cross, and on our way  often ascended such elevated spots that we had a free view extending  as far back as the capital.  On the top of the mountain (Alta da  Serra, sixteen miles from Mendoza) we found a venda.  From this spot  the distance to Morroqueimado is sixteen miles, which took us a long  time, as the road is either up or down hill the whole way.  We were  continually surrounded by the most magnificent woodlands, and were  only rarely reminded by a small plantation of kabi, {39} or mil,  that we were in the neighbourhood of men.  We did not perceive the  little town until we had surmounted the last eminence and were in  its immediate vicinity.  It lies in a large and picturesque hollow,  surrounded by mountains at an elevation of 3,200 feet above the  level of the sea.  As night was near at hand, we were glad enough to  reach our lodgings, which were situated on one side of the town, in  the house of a German named Linderoth; they were very comfortable,  and, as we afterwards found, exceedingly reasonable, seeing that for  our rooms and three good meals a-day we only paid one milreis (2s.  2d.).    5th October.  The small town of Novo Friburgo, or Morroqueimado, was  founded about fifteen years since by French, Swiss, and Germans.  It  contains not quite a hundred substantial houses, the greater part of  which form an extremely broad street, while the others lie scattered  about, here and there.    We had already heard, in Rio Janeiro, a great deal of the Messrs.  Beske and Freese, and been particularly recommended not to forget to  pay a visit to each.  Herr Beske is a naturalist, and resides here  with his wife, who is almost as scientific as himself.  We enjoyed  many an hour in their entertaining society, and were shown many  interesting collections of quadrupeds, birds, serpents, insects,  etc.; the collection of these last, indeed, was more rich and  remarkable than that in the Museum of Rio Janeiro.  Herr Beske has  always a great many orders from Europe to send over various objects  of natural history.  Herr Freese is the director and proprietor of  an establishment for boys, and preferred establishing his school in  this cool climate than in the hot town beneath.  He was kind enough  to show us all his arrangements.  As it was near evening when we  paid our visit, school was already over; but he presented all his  scholars to us, made them perform a few gymnastic exercises, and  proposed several questions on geography, history, arithmetic, etc.,  which, without exception, they answered very carefully and  correctly.  His establishment receives sixty boys, and was quite  full, although the annual charge for each boy is one thousand  milreis (108 pounds 6s. 8d.).    6th October.  We had at first intended to stop only one day in Novo  Friburgo, and then continue our journey.  Unfortunately, however,  the wound which the Count had received on our excursion to  Petropolis became, through the frequent use of the hand and the  excessive heat, much worse; inflammation set in, and he was  consequently obliged to give up all ideas of going any further.  With my wounds I was more fortunate, for, as they were on the upper  part of the arm, I had been enabled to pay them a proper degree of  care and attention; they were now proceeding very favourably, and  neither dangerous nor troublesome.  I had, therefore, no resource  left but either to pursue my journey alone, or to give up the most  interesting portion of it, namely, my visit to the Indians.  To this  last idea I could by no means reconcile myself; I inquired,  therefore, whether the journey could be made with any degree of  safety, and as I received a sort of half-satisfactory answer, and  Herr Lindenroth found me also a trusty guide, I procured a good  double-barrelled pistol and set out undaunted upon my trip.    We at first remained for some time in the midst of mountain ranges,  and then again descended into the warmer region beneath.  The  valleys were generally narrow, and the uniform appearance of the  woods was often broken by plantations.  The latter, however, did not  always look very promising, most of them being so choked up with  weeds that it was frequently impossible to perceive the plant  itself, especially when it was young and small.  It is only upon the  sugar and coffee plantations that any great care is bestowed.    The coffee-trees stand in rows upon tolerably steep hillocks.  They  attain a height of from six to twelve feet, and begin to bear  sometimes as soon as the second, but in no case later than the third  year, and are productive"]]]
