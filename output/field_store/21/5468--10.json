He then went with it to the firm in Newmarket that was making  his containers, or \"bombs\" as he called them.    On his return he consulted with Mr. Baxter as to the ingredients of the  fluid that had put out the blaze in the tree.    \"I believe you have at last hit on the right combination,\" said the  chemist. \"You are on the road to success, Tom. I wish I could say the  same of myself.\"    \"Perhaps your formulae may come back to you as suddenly as they  disappeared, or as quickly as I discovered that I had the right thing  to put out the fire,\" said Tom hopefully.    Busy days followed for the young inventor. Now that he was convinced he  had at last evolved the right mixture of chemicals, he prepared to make  a test on a larger scale than merely a blazing tree.    \"I'll try it with a fire in the pit,\" he said to his chum.    Preparations were made, and the day before Tom was to carry out his  plans he received a letter.    \"What's the matter? Bad news?\" asked Ned, as he saw his friend's face  change after reading the epistle.    \"Nothing much. Only Mary is going away, and I had expected her to be at  the test,\" Tom answered.    \"Going away?\" echoed Ned. \"For long?\"    \"Oh, no, only for a couple of weeks. She is going to visit an uncle and  aunt in Newmarket, or just outside of that city.  Another uncle, Barton  Keith, has offices in the Landmark Building, I believe.\"    \"Landmark Building,\" murmured Ned. \"Isn't that where Field and Melling  hang out?\"    \"Yes. But don't mention Mary's uncle in connection with them,\" laughed  Tom. \"He wouldn't like it.\"    \"I should say not!\"    Ned well remembered Mary's uncle, who had been associated with Tom in  recovering the treasure in the undersea search.    \"Well, if she can't be here, she can't,\" said Tom, as philosophically  as possible. \"I'd better run over and bid her goodbye.\"    This Tom did, though Ned noticed that his chum acted as though lonesome  on his return.    \"But when he gets to work testing his new chemical he'll be all right,\"  decided Ned.          CHAPTER XIII    A SUCCESSFUL TEST      \"It took you long enough,\" Ned remarked as Tom entered the main office  of the plant, having been to see Mary off on her trip to Newmarket.  This was following his call of the night before to learn more  particulars of her unexpected visit.    \"Yes, I didn't plan to be gone so long,\" apologized Tom. \"But I thought  while I was there I might as well go all the way with her.\"    \"And did you?\"    \"Yes. In the electric runabout. I wanted to come back and get the  airship, but she said she wanted to look nice when she met her  relatives, and as yet airship travel is a bit mussy. Though when I get  my cabined cruiser of the clouds I'll guarantee not to ruffle a curl of  the daintiest girl!\"    \"Getting poetical in your old age!\" laughed Ned. \"Well, here is that  statement you said you wanted me to get ready. Want to go over it now?\"    \"No, I guess not, as long as you know it's all right. I'm going to  start right in and get ready for a bang-up test.\"    \"Of what--your new aerial fire fighting apparatus?\"    \"Yes. Mr. Baxter and I are going to make up a lot of the chemical  compound that--we discovered through using it on the blazing tree--will  best do the trick. Then I'm going to try it on a pit fire, and after  that on a big blaze with an airship.\"    \"Let me know when you do,\" begged Ned. \"I want to see you do it.\"    \"I'll send you word,\" promised the young inventor.    Then he began several days and nights of hard work. And he was glad to  have the chance to occupy himself, for, though Tom professed not to be  much affected by the departure of Mary Nestor, he really was very  lonesome.    \"How is her uncle, Barton Keith, by the way?\" asked Ned, when he called  on his chum one day, to find him reading a letter which needed but half  an eye to tell was from Mary.    \"About as usual,\" was the answer. \"He sends word by Mary that he'll be  glad to see us any time we want to call. He has some nice offices in  the Landmark Building.\"    \"Those papers proving his right to the oil land, which you recovered  from the sunken ship for him, must have made his fortune.\"    \"Well, yes--that and other things,\" agreed Tom. \"Say, we had some  exciting times on that undersea search, didn't we?\"    \"Did you call on Mr. Keith when you went to Newmarket with Mary?\" Ned  wanted to know, for he and Tom had taken quite a liking to Miss  Nestor's uncle.    \"No, I didn't get a chance. Besides, I wanted to keep away from the  Landmark Building.\"    \"Why?\"    \"Oh, I might run into Field and Melling, and I don't want to see them  until I can accuse them, and prove it, of having taken Mr. Baxter's dye  formulae.\"    \"Oh, yes, they're in the same building with Mr. Keith, aren't they? Why  do they call it the Landmark? Though I suppose the answer is obvious.\"    \"Yes,\" assented Tom. \"It's a big building--the tallest ever erected in  that city, and a fine structure. Though while they were about it I  don't see why they didn't make it fireproof.\"    \"Didn't they?\" asked Ned, in surprise. \"Then the insurance rates must  be unusually high, for the companies are beginning to realize how fire  departments, even in big cities, are hampered in fighting blazes above  the tenth or twelfth stories.\"    \"Yes, it was a mistake not to have the Landmark Building fireproof,\"  admitted Tom. \"And Mr. Keith says the owners are beginning to realize  that now. It is what is called the 'slow burning' construction.\"    \"Insurance companies don't go much on that,\" declared Ned, who was in a  position to know. \"Well, let us hope it never catches fire.\"    These were busy days for the young inventor. He laid aside all his  other activities in order to perfect the plans for manufacturing his  new chemical fire extinguisher on a large scale. For Tom realized that  while a small quantity of chemicals in a compound might act in a  certain way on one occasion, if the bulk should happen to be increased  the experimenter could not always count on invariably the same results.    There appeared to be at times a change engendered when a large quantity  of chemicals were mixed which was not manifest in a small and  experimental batch.    So Tom wanted to mix up a big tank of his new chemical compound and see  if it would work in large quantities as well as it did with the small  amount Ned had dropped on the blazing tree.    To this end Tom worked at night, as well as by day, and finally he  announced to Ned and Mr. Damon, who called one evening, that he  believed he had everything in readiness for an exhaustive test the next  day.    \"There's the stuff!\" exclaimed Tom, not a little proudly, as he waved  his hand toward an immense carboy in the main shop. \"That's what I hope  will do the trick. Just take a--\"    \"Hold on! Stop! That's enough! Bless my hair brush!\" cried Mr. Damon,  holding up a protesting hand. \"If you take that cork out, Tom Swift,  you and I will cease to be friends!\"    \"I wasn't going to open it,\" laughed the young inventor. \"It has a  worse odor and seems to choke you more in a big quantity than when  there's only a little. I was just going to shake the carboy to let you  realize how full it was.\"    \"We'll take your word for it!\" laughed Ned. \"Now about your test. How  are you going to work it?\"    \"There are to be two tests,\" answered Tom. \"The first, and the smaller,  will be in the pit, as before, only this time we shall have what, I  believe, will be the successful combination of chemicals to drop on it.    \"The second test will be the main one. In that I plan to have an old  barn which I have bought set ablaze. Then Ned and I will sail over it  in the airship and drop chemicals on it. The barn will be filled with  empty boxes and barrels, to make as hot a fire as possible. You are  invited to accompany us, Mr. Damon.\"    \"Will there be any smell?\" asked the eccentric man, who seemed to have  a dislike for anything that was not as agreeable as perfume.    \"No, the chemicals will be sealed in containers, which will be dropped  from my airship as bombs were dropped in the war,\" said Tom.    \"On those conditions I'll go along,\" agreed Mr. Damon. \"But bless my  wedding certificate, Tom! don't tell my wife. She thinks I'm crazy  enough now, associating with you and flying occasionally. If she  thought I would help you battle with flames from the air she'd likely  never speak to me again.\"    \"I'll not tell,\" promised Tom, laughing.    Preparations for the test went on rapidly. In the morning a fire was to  be started in the same pit where the experiment had partly failed  before.    From the platform over the blazing hole some of the new combination of  chemicals was to be dropped. If it acted with success, as Tom believed  it would, he proposed to go on with the more important test in the  afternoon.    To this end he had purchased from a farmer the right to set on fire an  old ramshackle barn, standing in the midst of a field about three miles  outside of Shopton. The barn was on an untilled farm, the house having  been destroyed some years before, and it was not near any other  structures, so that, even in a high wind, no damage would result.    Tom had filled the barn with inflammable material, and was going to  spare no effort to have the test as exhaustive as possible.    The time came for the preliminary trial, and there were a few anxious  moments after the oil-soaked boards and boxes in the pit were set  ablaze.    \"Let her go!\" cried Tom to his man on the elevated platform, and down  fell the container of chemicals. It had no sooner struck and burst,  letting loose a mass of flame-choking vapor, than the fire died out.    \"You've struck it, Tom! You've"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/13635"],[0,"New York Times Current History: The European War, Vol 1, No. 1 (#13)"],[1,"be just  even to the War Office. It did _not_ ask the soldiers' wives for forms  of authorization to pay the separation allowance to their bankers every  six months. It actually offered the money monthly!      *Delusive Promises.*    The middle and upper classes are nearly as bad as the War Office. They  talk of keeping every man's place open for him until the end of the war.  Obviously this is flatly impossible. Some places can be kept, and no  doubt are being kept. Some functions are suspended by the war and cannot  be resumed until the troops return to civil life and resume them.  Employers are so hardened to the daily commercial necessity for  discharging men without a thought as to what is to become of them that  they are quite ready to undertake to sack the replacers when the troops  come back. Also the return of peace may be followed by a revival of  trade in which employment may not be hard to find, even by discharged  soldiers, who are always passed over in the labour market in favour of  civilians, as those well know who have the task of trying to find places  for them. But these considerations do not justify an attempt to persuade  recruits that they can go off soldiering for months--they are told by  Lord Kitchener that it will probably be for years--and then come back  and walk to their benches or into their offices and pick up their work  as if they had left only the night before. The very people who are  promising this are raising the cry \"business as usual\" in the same  breath. How can business be carried on as usual, or carried on at all,  on unoccupied office stools and at counters with no men behind them?  Such rubbish is an insult to the recruit's intelligence. These promises  of keeping places open were made to the men who enlisted for South  Africa, and were of course broken, as a promise to supply green cheese  by quarrying the moon would have been broken. New employees must be  found to do the work of the men who are in the field; and these new ones  will not all be thrown into the street when the war is over to make room  for discharged soldiers, even if a good many of these soldiers are not  disqualified by their new training and habits for their old employment.  I repeat, there is only one assurance that can be given to the recruits  without grossly and transparently deluding them; and that is that they  shall not be discharged, except at their own request, until civil  employment is available for them.      *Funking Controversy.*    This is not the only instance of the way in which, under the first scare  of the war, we shut our eyes and opened our mouths to every folly. For  example, there was a cry for the suspension of all controversy in the  face of the national danger. Now the only way to suspend controversial  questions during a period of intense activity in the very departments in  which the controversy has arisen is to allow them all to be begged.  Perhaps I should not object if they were all begged in favour of my own  side, as, for instance, the question of Socialism was begged in favour  of Socialism when the Government took control of the railways; bought up  all the raw sugar; regulated prices; guaranteed the banks; suspended the  operation of private contracts; and did all the things it had been  declaring utterly and eternally Utopian and imposible when Socialists  advocated them. But it is now proposed to suspend all popular liberties  and constitutional safeguards; to muzzle the Press, and actually to have  no contests at bye-elections! This is more than a little too much. We  have submitted to have our letters, our telegrams, our newspapers  censored, our dividends delayed, our trains cut off, our horses and even  our houses commandeered, our streets darkened, our restaurants closed,  and ourselves shot dead on the public highways if we were slow to  realize that some excited person bawling in the distance was a sentry  challenging us. But that we are to be politically gagged and enslaved as  well; that the able-bodied soldier in the trenches, who depends on the  able-minded civilian at home to guard the liberties of his country and  protect him from carelesness or abuse of power by the authorities whom  he must blindly and dumbly obey, is to be betrayed the moment his back  is turned to his fellow-citizens and his face to the foe, is not  patriotism: it is the paralysis of mortal funk: it is the worst kind of  cowardice in the face of the enemy. Let us hear no more of it, but  contest our elections like men, and regain the ancient political  prestige of England at home as our expeditionary force has regained it  abroad.    The Labour Party, then, need have no hesitation in raising all the  standing controversies between Democracy and Junkerism in their acutest  form, and taking advantage of the war emergency to press them to a  series of parliamentary victories for Labour, whether in negotiations  with the Government whips, in divisions on the floor of the House, or in  strenuously contested bye-elections. No doubt our Junkers will try to  disarm their opponents by representing that it would be in the last  degree unfair, un-English, and ungentlemanly on the part of the Labour  members to seize any tactical advantage in parliamentary warfare, and  most treacherous and unpatriotic to attack their country (meaning the  Junker Party) when it is at war. Some Labour members will be easily  enough gulled in this way: it would be laughable, if the consequences  were not so tragic, to see how our parliamentary beginners from the  working class succumb to the charm of the Junker appeal. The Junkers  themselves are not to be coaxed in this manner: it is no use offering  tracts to a missionary, as the poor Kaiser found when he tried it on.  The Labour Party will soon learn the value of these polite  demonstrations that it is always its duty not to hamper the governing  classes in their very difficult and delicate and dangerous task of  safeguarding the interests of this great empire: in short, to let itself  be gammoned by elegant phrases and by adroit practisings on its personal  good-nature, its inveterate proletarian sentimentality, and its secret  misgivings as to the correctness of its manners. The Junkers have  already taken the fullest advantage of the war to paralyze democracy. If  the Labour members do not take a vigorous counter-offensive, and fight  every parliamentary trench to the last division, the Labour Movement  will be rushed back as precipitately as General von Kluck rushed the  Allies back from Namur to the gates of Paris. In truth, the importance  of the war to the immense majority of Englishmen, Frenchmen, and Germans  lies in the possibility that when Junkers fall out common men may come  by their own.          *III.*    *THE TERMS OF PEACE.*      *Natural Limits to Duration of the War.*      So much for the recruiting. Now for the terms of peace. It is time to  take that subject in hand; for Lord Kitchener's notion that we are going  to settle down to years of war as we did a century ago is soldierly, but  not sensible. It is, of course, physically possible for us to continue  for twenty years digging trenches and shelling German troops and shoving  German armies back when they are not shoving us, whilst old women pull  turnips and tend goats in the fire zones across which soldiers run to  shelter. But we cannot afford to withdraw a million male adults who have  passed a strictish health test from the work of parentage for several  years unless we intend to breed our next generation from parents with  short sight, varicose veins, rotten teeth, and deranged internal organs.  Soldiers do not think of these things: \"theirs not to reason why: theirs  but to do and die\"; but sensible civilians have to. And even soldiers  know that you cannot make ammunition as fast as you can burn it, nor  produce men and horses as instantaneously as you can kill them by  machinery. It would be well, indeed, if our papers, instead of writing  of ten-inch shells, would speak of L1,000 shells, and regimental bands  occasionally finish the National Anthem and the Brabanconne and the  Marseillaise with the old strain, \"That's the way the money goes: Pop  goes the Ten Inch.\" It is easy to rebuke Mr. Norman Angell and Herr  Bloch for their sordid references to the cost of war; and Mr. H.G. Wells  is profoundly right in pointing out that the fact that war does not pay  commercially is greatly to its credit, as no high human activity ever  does pay commercially. But modern war does not even pay its way. Already  our men have \"pumped lead\" into retreating Germans who had no lead left  to pump back again; and sooner or later, if we go on indefinitely, we  shall have to finish the job with our fists, and congratulate ourselves  that both Georges Carpentier and Bombardier Wells are on our side. This  war will stop when Germany throws up the sponge, which will happen long  before she is utterly exhausted, but not before we ourselves shall be  glad enough of a rest. Nations are like bees: they cannot kill except at  the cost of their own lives.    The question of terms will raise a fierce controversy. At the extremes  of our public opinion we have two temperaments, first, our gentlemen,  our sportsmen, our daredevils, our _preux chevaliers_. To these the  notion of reviling your enemy when he is up; kicking him when he is  knocked down by somebody else; and gouging out his eyes, cutting out his  tongue, hewing off his right arm, and stealing all his money, is  abhorrent and cowardly. These gallants say, \"It is not enough that we  can fight Germany to-day. We can fight her any day and every day. Let  her come again and again and yet again. We will fight her one to three;  and if she comes on ten to one, as she did at Mons, we will mill on the  retreat, and drive her back again when we have worn her down to our  weight. If her fleet will not come out to fight us because we have too"]]]
