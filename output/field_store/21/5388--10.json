He kept repeating his customary orisons in a low voice, and he  was heard murmuring these broken words: \"Fair Sir God, have mercy on this  people that bideth here, and bring them back to their own land!  Let them  not fall into the hands of their enemies, and let them not be constrained  to deny Thy name!\"  And at the same time that he thus expressed his sad  reflections upon the situation in which he was leaving his army and his  people, he cried from time to time, as he raised himself on his bed,  \"Jerusalem! Jerusalem!  We will go up to Jerusalem!\"  During the night of  the 24th 25th of August he ceased to speak, all the time continuing to  show that he was in full possession of his senses; he insisted upon  receiving extreme unction out of bed, and lying upon a coarse sack-cloth  covered with cinders, with the cross before him; and on Monday, the 25th  of August, 1270, at three P.M., he departed in peace, whilst uttering  these his last words: \"Father, after the example of the Divine Master,  into Thy hands I commend my spirit!\"    [Illustration: The Death of St. Louis----64]          CHAPTER XVIII.----THE KINGSHIP IN FRANCE.    That the kingship occupied an important place and played an important  part in the history of France is an evident and universally recognized  fact.  But to what causes this fact was due, and what particular  characteristics gave the kingship in France that preponderating influence  which, in weal and in woe, it exercised over the fortunes of the country,  is a question which has been less closely examined, and which still  remains vague and obscure.  This question it is which we would now shed  light upon and determine with some approach to precision.  We cannot  properly comprehend and justly appreciate a great historical force until  we have seen it issuing from its primary source and followed it in its  various developments.    At the first glance, two facts strike us in the history of the kingship  in France.  It was in France that it adopted soonest and most  persistently maintained its fundamental principle, heredity.  In the  other monarchical states of Europe--in England, in Germany, in Spain, and  in Italy--divers principles, at one time election, and at another right  of conquest, have been mingled with or substituted for the heredity of  the throne; different dynasties have reigned; and England has had her  Saxon, Danish, and Norman kings, her Plantagenets, her Tudors, her  Stuarts, her Nassaus, her Brunswicks.  In Germany, and up to the  eighteenth century, the Empire, the sole central dignity, was elective  and transferable.  Spain was for a long while parcelled out into several  distinct kingdoms, and since she attained territorial unity the houses of  Austria and Bourbon have both occupied her throne.  The monarchy and the  republic for many a year disputed and divided Italy.  Only in France was  there, at any time during eight centuries, but a single king and a single  line of kings.  Unity and heredity, those two essential principles of  monarchy, have been the invariable characteristics of the kingship in  France.    A second fact, less apparent and less remarkable, but, nevertheless, not  without importance or without effect upon the history of the kingship in  France, is the extreme variety of character, of faculties, of  intellectual and moral bent, of policy and personal conduct amongst the  French kings.  In the long roll of thirty-three kings who reigned in  France from Hugh Capet to Louis XVI. there were kings wise and kings  foolish, kings able and kings incapable, kings rash and kings slothful,  kings earnest and kings frivolous, kings saintly and kings licentious,  kings good and sympathetic towards their people, kings egotistical and  concerned solely about themselves, kings lovable and beloved, kings  sombre and dreaded or detested.  As we go forward and encounter them on  our way, all these kingly characters will be seen appearing and acting in  all their diversity and all their incoherence.  Absolute monarchical  power in France was, almost in every successive reign, singularly  modified, being at one time aggravated and at another alleviated  according to the ideas, sentiments, morals, and spontaneous instincts of  the monarchs.  Nowhere else, throughout the great European monarchies,  has the difference between kingly personages exercised so much influence  on government and national condition.  In that country the free action of  individuals has filled a prominent place and taken a prominent part in  the course of events.    It has been shown how insignificant and inert, as sovereigns, were the  first three successors of Hugh Capet.  The goodness to his people  displayed by King Robert was the only kingly trait which, during that  period, deserved to leave a trace in history.  The kingship appeared once  more with the attributes of energy and efficiency on the accession of  Louis VI., son of Philip I.  He was brought up in the monastery of St.  Denis, which at that time had for its superior a man of judgment, the  Abbot Adam; and he then gave evidence of tendencies and received his  training under influences worthy of the position which awaited him.  He  was handsome, tall, strong, and alert, determined and yet affable.  He  had more taste for military exercises than for the amusements of  childhood and the pleasures of youth.  He was at that time called Louis  the Wide-awake.  He had the good fortune to find in the Monastery of St.  Denis a fellow-student capable of becoming a king's counsellor.  Suger, a  child born at St. Denis, of obscure parentage, and three or four years  younger than Prince Louis, had been brought up for charity's sake in the  abbey, and the Abbot Adam, who had perceived his natural abilities, had  taken pains to develop them.  A bond of esteem and mutual friendship was  formed between the two young people, both of whom were disposed to  earnest thought and earnest living; and when, in 1108, Louis the Wide-  awake ascended the throne, the monk Suger became his adviser whilst  remaining his friend.    A very small kingdom was at that time the domain belonging properly and  directly to the King of France.  Ile-de-France, properly so called, and a  part of Orleanness (_l'Oreanais_), pretty nearly the five departments of  the Seine, Seine-et-Oise, Seineet-Marne, Oise and Loiret, besides,  through recent acquisitions, French Vexin (which bordered on the Ile-de-  France and had for its chief place Pontoise, being separated by the  little River Epte from Norman Vexin, of which Rouen was the capital),  half the countship of Sens and the countship of Bourges--such was the  whole of its extent.  But this limited state was as liable to agitation,  and often as troublous and as toilsome to govern, as the very greatest of  modern states.  It was full of Petty lords, almost sovereigns in their  own estates, and sufficiently strong to struggle against their kingly  suzerain, who had, besides, all around his domains, several neighbors  more powerful than himself in the extent and population of their states.  But lord and peasant, layman and ecclesiastic, castle and country and the  churches of France, were not long discovering that, if the kingdom was  small, it had verily a king.  Louis did not direct to a distance from  home his ambition and his efforts; it was within his own dominion, to  check the violence of the strong against the weak, to put a stop to the  quarrels of the strong amongst themselves, to make an end, in France at  least, of unrighteousness and devastation, and to establish there some  sort of order and some sort of justice, that he displayed his energy and  his perseverance.  \"He was animated,\" says Suger, \"by a strong sense of  equity; to air his courage was his delight; he scorned inaction; he  opened his eyes to see the way of discretion; he broke his rest and was  unwearied in his solicitude.\"  Suger has recounted in detail sixteen of  the numerous expeditions which Louis undertook into the interior, to  accomplish his work of repression or of exemplary chastisement.  Bouchard, Lord of Montmorency, Matthew de Beaumont, Dreux de Mouchy-le-  Chatel, Ebble de Roussi, Leon de Mean, Thomas de Marle, Hugh de Crecy,  William de la Roche-Guyon, Hugh du Puiset, and Amaury de Montfort  learned, to their cost, that the king was not to be braved with impunity.  \"Bouchard, on taking up arms one day against him, refused to accept his  sword from the hands of one of his people who offered it to him, and said  by way of boast to the countess his wife, 'Noble countess, give thou  joyously this glittering sword to the count thy spouse: he who taketh it  from thee as count will bring it back to thee as king.'  \"In this very  campaign, Bouchard,\" by his death,\" says Suger, \"restored peace to the  kingdom, and took away himself and his war to the bottomless pit of  hell.\"  Hugh du Puiset had frequently broken his oaths of peace and  recommenced his devastations and revolts; and Louis resumed his course of  hunting him down, \"destroyed the castle of Puiset, threw down the walls,  dug up the wells, and razed it completely to the ground, as a place  devoted to the curse of Heaven.\"  Thomas de Marle, Lord of Couci, had  been_ committing cruel ravages upon the town and church of Laon, lands  and inhabitants; when \"Louis, summoned by"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/11953"],[0,"A Popular History of France from the Earliest Times, Volume 3 (#13)"],[1,"hundred spearmen and as many archers from Paris, and it  is not quite known how many men-at-arms sent by the Duke of Burgundy,  defended Rouen for more than five months amidst all the usual sufferings  of strictly-besieged cities.  \"As early as the beginning of October,\"  says Monstrelet, \"they were forced to eat horses, dogs, cats, and other  things not fit for human beings;\" but they nevertheless made frequent  sorties, \"rushing furiously upon the enemy, to whom they caused many a  heavy loss.\"  Four gentlemen and four burgesses succeeded in escaping and  going to Beauvais, to tell the king and his council about the deplorable  condition of their city.  The council replied that the king was not in a  condition to raise the siege, but that Rouen would be relieved \"within\"  on the fourth day after Christmas.  It was now the middle of December.  The Rouennese resigned themselves to waiting a fortnight longer; but,  when that period was over, they found nothing arrive but a message from  the Duke of Burgundy recommending them \"to treat for their preservation  with the King of England as best they could.\"  They asked to capitulate.  Henry V. demanded that \"all the men of the town should place themselves  at his disposal.\"  \"When the commonalty of Rouen heard this answer, they  all cried out that it were better to die all together sword in hand  against their enemies than place themselves at the disposal of yonder  king, and they were for shoring up with planks a loosened layer of the  wall inside the city, and, having armed themselves and joined all of them  together, men, women, and children, for setting fire to the city,  throwing down the said layer of wall into the moats, and getting them  gone by night whither it might please God to direct them.\"  Henry V. was  unwilling to confront such heroic despair; and on the 13th of January,  1419, he granted the Rouennese a capitulation, from which seven persons  only were excepted, Robert Delivet, the archbishop's vicar-general, who  from the top of the ramparts had excommunicated the foreign conqueror;  D'Houdetot, baillie of the city; John Segneult, the mayor; Alan  Blanchard, the captain of the militia-crossbowmen, and three other  burgesses.  The last-named, the hero of the siege, was the only one who  paid for his heroism with his life; the baillie, the mayor, and the vicar  bought themselves off.  On the 19th of January, at midday, the English,  king and army, made their solemn entry into the city.  It was two hundred  and fifteen years since Philip Augustus had won Rouen by conquest from  John Lackland, King of England; and happily his successors were not to be  condemned to deplore the loss of it very long.    These successes of the King of England were so many reverses and perils  for the Count of Armagnac.  He had in his hands Paris, the king, and the  _dauphin_; in the people's eyes the responsibility of government and of  events rested on his shoulders; and at one time he was doing nothing,  at another he was unsuccessful in what he did.  Whilst Henry V. was  becoming master of nearly all the towns of Normandy, the constable, with  the king in his army, was besieging Senlis; and he was obliged to raise  the siege.  The legates of Pope Martin V. had set about establishing  peace between the Burgundians and Armagnacs, as well as between France  and England; they had prepared, on the basis of the treaty of Arras, a  new treaty, with which a great part of the country, and even of the  burgesses of Paris, showed themselves well pleased; but the constable had  it rejected on the ground of its being adverse to the interests of the  king and of France; and his friend, the chancellor, Henry de Marle,  declared that, if the king were disposed to sign it, he would have to  seal it himself, for that, as for him, the chancellor, he certainly would  not seal it.  Bernard of Armagnac and his confidential friend, Tanneguy  Duchatel, a Breton nobleman, provost of Paris, were hard and haughty.  When a complaint was made to them of any violent procedure, they would  answer, \"What business had you there?  If it were the Burgundians, you  would make no complaint.\"  The Parisian population was becoming every day  more Burgundian.  In the latter days of May.  1418, a plot was contrived  for opening to the Burgundians one of the gates of Paris.  Perrinet  Leclerc, son of a rich iron-merchant having influence in the quarter of  St. Germain des Pros, stole the keys from under the bolster of his  father's bed; a troop of Burgundian men-at-arms came in, and they were  immediately joined by a troop of Parisians.  They spread over the city,  shouting, \"Our Lady of peace!  Hurrah for the king!  Hurrah for Burgundy!  Let all who wish for peace take arms and follow us!\" The people swarmed  from the houses and followed them accordingly.  The Armagnacs were  surprised and seized with alarm.  Tanneguy Duchatel, a man of prompt and  resolute spirit, ran to the _dauphin_'s, wrapped him in his bed-clothes,  and carried him off to the Bastille, where he shut him up with several of  his partisans.  The Count of Armagnac, towards whose house the multitude  thronged, left by a back-door, and took refuge at a mason's, where he  believed himself secure.  In a few hours the Burgundians were masters of  Paris.  Their chief, the lord of Isle-Adam, had the doors of the hostel  of St. Paul broken in, and presented himself before the king.  \"How fares  my cousin of Burgundy?\" said Charles VI.; \"I have not seen him for some  time.\"  That was all he said.  He was set on horseback and marched  through the streets.  He showed no astonishment at anything; he had all  but lost memory as well as reason, and no longer knew the difference  between Armagnac and Burgundian.  A devoted Burgundian, Sire Guy de Bar,  was named provost of Paris in the place of Tanneguy Duchatel.  The mason  with whom Bernard of Armagnac had taken refuge went and told the new  provost that the constable was concealed at his house.  Thither the  provost hurried, made the constable mount behind him, and carried him off  to prison at the Chatelet, at the same time making honorable exertions to  prevent massacre and plunder.    But factions do not so soon give up either their vengeance or their  hopes.  On the 11th of June, 1418, hardly twelve days after Paris had  fallen into the hands of the Burgundians, a body of sixteen hundred men  issued from the Bastille, and rushed into the street St. Antoine,  shouting, \"Hurrah for the king, the _dauphin_, and the Count of Armagnac!\"  They were Tanneguy Duchatel and some of the chiefs of the Armagnacs who  were attempting to regain Paris, where they had observed that the  Burgundians were not numerous.  Their attempt had no success, and merely  gave the Burgundians the opportunity and the signal for a massacre of  their enemies.  The little band of Tanneguy Duchatel was instantly  repulsed, hemmed in, and forced to re-enter the Bastille with a loss of  four hundred men.  Tanneguy saw that he could make no defence there; so  he hastily made his way out, taking the _dauphin_ with him to Melun.  The  massacre of the Armagnacs had already commenced on the previous evening:  they were harried in the hostelries and houses; they were cut down with  axes in the streets.  On the night between the 12th and 13th of June a  rumor spread about that there were bands of Armagnacs coming to deliver  their friends in prison.  \"They are at the St. Germain gate,\" said some.  No, it is the St. Marceau gate,\" said others.  The mob assembled and made  a furious rush upon the prison-gates.  \"The city and burgesses will have  no peace,\" was the general saying, \"so long as there is one Armagnac  left!  Hurrah for peace!  Hurrah for the Duke of Burgundy!\"  The provost  of Paris, the lord of Isle-Adam, and the principal Burgundian chieftains,  galloped up with a thousand horse, and strove to pacify these madmen,  numbering, it is said, some forty thousand.  They were received with a  stout of, \"A plague of your justice and pity!  Accursed be he whosoever  shall have pity on these traitors of Armagnacs.  They are English; they  are hounds.  They had already made banners for the King of England, and  would fain have planted them upon the gates of the city.  They made us  work for nothing, and when we asked for our due they said, 'You rascals,  haven't ye a sou to buy a cord and go hang yourselves?  In the devil's  name speak no more of it; it will be no use, whatever you say.'\"  The  provost of Paris durst not oppose such fury as this.  \"Do what you  please,\" said he.  The mob ran to look for the constable Armagnac and the  chancellor de Marle in the Palace-tower, in which they had been shut up,  and they were at once torn to pieces amidst ferocious rejoicings.  All  the prisons were ransacked and emptied; the prisoners who attempted  resistance were smoked out; they were hurled down from the windows upon  pikes held up to catch them.  The massacre lasted from four o'clock in  the morning to eleven.  The common report was, that fifteen hundred  persons had perished in it; the account rendered to parliament made the  number eight hundred.  The servants of the Duke of Burgundy mentioned to  him no more than four hundred.    It was not before the 14th of July that he, with Queen Isabel, came back  to the city; and he came with a sincere design, if not of punishing the  cut-throats, at least of putting a stop to all massacre and pillage; but  there is nothing more difficult than to suppress the consequences of a  mischief of which you dare not attack the cause.  One Bertrand, head of  one of the companies of butchers, had been elected captain of St. Denis  because he had saved the abbey from the rapacity of a noble Burgundian  chieftain, Hector de Saveuse.  The lord, to avenge himself, had the  butcher assassinated.  The burgesses went to the duke to demand that the  assassin should be punished; and the duke, who durst neither"]]]
