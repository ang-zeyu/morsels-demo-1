Hearty zeal  To serve reanimates celestial grace.\"    \"O ye, in whom intenser fervency  Haply supplies, where lukewarm erst ye fail'd,  Slow or neglectful, to absolve your part  Of good and virtuous, this man, who yet lives,  (Credit my tale, though strange) desires t' ascend,  So morning rise to light us.  Therefore say  Which hand leads nearest to the rifted rock?\"    So spake my guide, to whom a shade return'd:  \"Come after us, and thou shalt find the cleft.  We may not linger: such resistless will  Speeds our unwearied course.  Vouchsafe us then  Thy pardon, if our duty seem to thee  Discourteous rudeness.  In Verona I  Was abbot of San Zeno, when the hand  Of Barbarossa grasp'd Imperial sway,  That name, ne'er utter'd without tears in Milan.  And there is he, hath one foot in his grave,  Who for that monastery ere long shall weep,  Ruing his power misus'd: for that his son,  Of body ill compact, and worse in mind,  And born in evil, he hath set in place  Of its true pastor.\"  Whether more he spake,  Or here was mute, I know not: he had sped  E'en now so far beyond us.  Yet thus much  I heard, and in rememb'rance treasur'd it.    He then, who never fail'd me at my need,  Cried, \"Hither turn.  Lo! two with sharp remorse  Chiding their sin!\"  In rear of all the troop  These shouted: \"First they died, to whom the sea  Open'd, or ever Jordan saw his heirs:  And they, who with Aeneas to the end  Endur'd not suffering, for their portion chose  Life without glory.\"  Soon as they had fled  Past reach of sight, new thought within me rose  By others follow'd fast, and each unlike  Its fellow: till led on from thought to thought,  And pleasur'd with the fleeting train, mine eye  Was clos'd, and meditation chang'd to dream.          CANTO XIX    It was the hour, when of diurnal heat  No reliques chafe the cold beams of the moon,  O'erpower'd by earth, or planetary sway  Of Saturn; and the geomancer sees  His Greater Fortune up the east ascend,  Where gray dawn checkers first the shadowy cone;  When 'fore me in my dream a woman's shape  There came, with lips that stammer'd, eyes aslant,  Distorted feet, hands maim'd, and colour pale.    I look'd upon her; and as sunshine cheers  Limbs numb'd by nightly cold, e'en thus my look  Unloos'd her tongue, next in brief space her form  Decrepit rais'd erect, and faded face  With love's own hue illum'd. Recov'ring speech  She forthwith warbling such a strain began,  That I, how loth soe'er, could scarce have held  Attention from the song.  \"I,\" thus she sang,  \"I am the Siren, she, whom mariners  On the wide sea are wilder'd when they hear:  Such fulness of delight the list'ner feels.  I from his course Ulysses by my lay  Enchanted drew.  Whoe'er frequents me once  Parts seldom; so I charm him, and his heart  Contented knows no void.\"  Or ere her mouth  Was clos'd, to shame her at her side appear'd  A dame of semblance holy.  With stern voice  She utter'd; \"Say, O Virgil, who is this?\"  Which hearing, he approach'd, with eyes still bent  Toward that goodly presence: th' other seiz'd her,  And, her robes tearing, open'd her before,  And show'd the belly to me, whence a smell,  Exhaling loathsome, wak'd me.  Round I turn'd  Mine eyes, and thus the teacher: \"At the least  Three times my voice hath call'd thee.  Rise, begone.  Let us the opening find where thou mayst pass.\"    I straightway rose.  Now day, pour'd down from high,  Fill'd all the circuits of the sacred mount;  And, as we journey'd, on our shoulder smote  The early ray.  I follow'd, stooping low  My forehead, as a man, o'ercharg'd with thought,  Who bends him to the likeness of an arch,  That midway spans the flood; when thus I heard,  \"Come, enter here,\" in tone so soft and mild,  As never met the ear on mortal strand.    With swan-like wings dispread and pointing up,  Who thus had spoken marshal'd us along,  Where each side of the solid masonry  The sloping, walls retir'd; then mov'd his plumes,  And fanning us, affirm'd that those, who mourn,  Are blessed, for that comfort shall be theirs.    \"What aileth thee, that still thou look'st to earth?\"  Began my leader; while th' angelic shape  A little over us his station took.    \"New vision,\" I replied, \"hath rais'd in me  Surmisings strange and anxious doubts, whereon  My soul intent allows no other thought  Or room or entrance.\"--\"Hast thou seen,\" said he,  \"That old enchantress, her, whose wiles alone  The spirits o'er us weep for?  Hast thou seen  How man may free him of her bonds?  Enough.  Let thy heels spurn the earth, and thy rais'd ken  Fix on the lure, which heav'n's eternal King  Whirls in the rolling spheres.\"  As on his feet  The falcon first looks down, then to the sky  Turns, and forth stretches eager for the food,  That woos him thither; so the call I heard,  So onward, far as the dividing rock  Gave way, I journey'd, till the plain was reach'd.    On the fifth circle when I stood at large,  A race appear'd before me, on the ground  All downward lying prone and weeping sore.  \"My soul hath cleaved to the dust,\" I heard  With sighs so deep, they well nigh choak'd the words.  \"O ye elect of God, whose penal woes  Both hope and justice mitigate, direct  Tow'rds the steep rising our uncertain way.\"    \"If ye approach secure from this our doom,  Prostration--and would urge your course with speed,  See that ye still to rightward keep the brink.\"    So them the bard besought; and such the words,  Beyond us some short space, in answer came.    I noted what remain'd yet hidden from them:  Thence to my liege's eyes mine eyes I bent,  And he, forthwith interpreting their suit,  Beckon'd his glad assent. Free then to act,  As pleas'd me, I drew near, and took my stand  O`er that shade, whose words I late had mark'd.  And, \"Spirit!\"  I said, \"in whom repentant tears  Mature that blessed hour, when thou with God  Shalt find acceptance, for a while suspend  For me that mightier care.  Say who thou wast,  Why thus ye grovel on your bellies prone,  And if in aught ye wish my service there,  Whence living I am come.\"  He answering spake  \"The cause why Heav'n our back toward his cope  Reverses, shalt thou know: but me know first  The successor of Peter, and the name  And title of my lineage from that stream,  That' twixt Chiaveri and Siestri draws  His limpid waters through the lowly glen.  A month and little more by proof I learnt,  With what a weight that robe of sov'reignty  Upon his shoulder rests, who from the mire  Would guard it: that each other fardel seems  But feathers in the balance.  Late, alas!  Was my conversion: but when I became  Rome's pastor, I discern'd at once the dream  And cozenage of life, saw that the heart  Rested not there, and yet no prouder height  Lur'd on the climber: wherefore, of that life  No more enamour'd, in my bosom love  Of purer being kindled.  For till then  I was a soul in misery, alienate  From God, and covetous of all earthly things;  Now, as thou seest, here punish'd for my doting.  Such cleansing from the taint of avarice  Do spirits converted need.  This mount inflicts  No direr penalty.  E'en as our eyes  Fasten'd below, nor e'er to loftier clime  Were lifted, thus hath justice level'd us  Here on the earth.  As avarice quench'd our love  Of good, without which is no working, thus  Here justice holds us prison'd, hand and foot  Chain'd down and bound, while heaven's just Lord shall please.  So long to tarry motionless outstretch'd.\"    My knees I stoop'd, and would have spoke; but he,  Ere my beginning, by his ear perceiv'd  I did him reverence; and \"What cause,\" said he,  \"Hath bow'd thee thus!\"--\"Compunction,\" I rejoin'd.  \"And inward awe of your high dignity.\"    \"Up,\" he exclaim'd, \"brother! upon thy feet  Arise: err not: thy fellow servant I,  (Thine and all others') of one Sovran Power.  If thou hast ever mark'd those holy sounds  Of gospel truth, 'nor shall be given ill marriage,'  Thou mayst discern the reasons of my speech.  Go thy ways now; and linger here no more.  Thy tarrying is a let unto the tears,  With which I hasten that whereof thou spak'st.  I have on earth a kinswoman; her name  Alagia, worthy in herself, so ill  Example of our house corrupt her not:  And she is all remaineth of me there.\"          CANTO XX    Ill strives the will, 'gainst will more wise that strives  His pleasure therefore to mine own preferr'd,  I drew the sponge yet thirsty from the wave.    Onward I mov'd: he also onward mov'd,  Who led me, coasting still, wherever place  Along the rock was vacant, as a man  Walks near the battlements on narrow wall.  For those on th' other part, who drop by drop  Wring out their all-infecting malady,  Too closely press the verge.  Accurst be thou!  Inveterate wolf! whose gorge ingluts more prey,  Than every beast beside, yet is not fill'd!  So bottomless thy maw!--Ye spheres of heaven!  To whom there are, as seems, who attribute  All change in mortal state, when is the day  Of his appearing, for whom fate reserves  To chase her hence?--With wary steps and slow  We pass'd; and I attentive to the shades,  Whom piteously I heard lament and wail;    And, 'midst the wailing, one before us heard  Cry out \"O blessed Virgin!\"  as a dame  In the sharp pangs of childbed; and \"How poor  Thou wast,\" it added, \"witness that low roof  Where thou didst lay thy sacred burden down.  O good Fabricius! thou didst virtue choose  With poverty, before great wealth with vice.\"    The words so pleas'd me, that desire to know  The spirit, from whose lip they seem'd to come,  Did draw me onward.  Yet it spake the gift  Of Nicholas, which on the maidens he  Bounteous bestow'd, to save their youthful prime  Unblemish'd.  \"Spirit! who dost speak of deeds  So worthy, tell me who thou was,\" I said,  \"And why thou dost with single voice renew  Memorial of such praise. That boon vouchsaf'd  Haply shall meet reward; if I return  To finish the Short pilgrimage of life,  Still speeding to its close on restless"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/8800"],[0,"An Index of The Divine Comedy (#12)"],[1,"crowning, well content  To over-canopy the M. mov'd forth,  Following gently the impress of the bird.     Sweet star! what glorious and thick-studded gems  Declar'd to me our justice on the earth  To be the effluence of that heav'n, which thou,  Thyself a costly jewel, dost inlay!  Therefore I pray the Sovran Mind, from whom  Thy motion and thy virtue are begun,  That he would look from whence the fog doth rise,  To vitiate thy beam: so that once more  He may put forth his hand 'gainst such, as drive  Their traffic in that sanctuary, whose walls  With miracles and martyrdoms were built.    Ye host of heaven! whose glory I survey!  O beg ye grace for those, that are on earth  All after ill example gone astray.  War once had for its instrument the sword:  But now 't is made, taking the bread away  Which the good Father locks from none.  --And thou,  That writes but to cancel, think, that they,  Who for the vineyard, which thou wastest, died,  Peter and Paul live yet, and mark thy doings.  Thou hast good cause to cry, \"My heart so cleaves  To him, that liv'd in solitude remote,  And from the wilds was dragg'd to martyrdom,  I wist not of the fisherman nor Paul.\"          CANTO XIX    Before my sight appear'd, with open wings,  The beauteous image, in fruition sweet  Gladdening the thronged spirits.  Each did seem  A little ruby, whereon so intense  The sun-beam glow'd that to mine eyes it came  In clear refraction.  And that, which next  Befalls me to portray, voice hath not utter'd,  Nor hath ink written, nor in fantasy  Was e'er conceiv'd.  For I beheld and heard  The beak discourse; and, what intention form'd  Of many, singly as of one express,  Beginning: \"For that I was just and piteous,  l am exalted to this height of glory,  The which no wish exceeds: and there on earth  Have I my memory left, e'en by the bad  Commended, while they leave its course untrod.\"    Thus is one heat from many embers felt,  As in that image many were the loves,  And one the voice, that issued from them all.  Whence I address them: \"O perennial flowers  Of gladness everlasting! that exhale  In single breath your odours manifold!  Breathe now; and let the hunger be appeas'd,  That with great craving long hath held my soul,  Finding no food on earth.  This well I know,  That if there be in heav'n a realm, that shows  In faithful mirror the celestial Justice,  Yours without veil reflects it.  Ye discern  The heed, wherewith I do prepare myself  To hearken; ye the doubt that urges me  With such inveterate craving.\"  Straight I saw,  Like to a falcon issuing from the hood,  That rears his head, and claps him with his wings,  His beauty and his eagerness bewraying.  So saw I move that stately sign, with praise  Of grace divine inwoven and high song  Of inexpressive joy.  \"He,\" it began,  \"Who turn'd his compass on the world's extreme,  And in that space so variously hath wrought,  Both openly, and in secret, in such wise  Could not through all the universe display  Impression of his glory, that the Word  Of his omniscience should not still remain  In infinite excess.  In proof whereof,  He first through pride supplanted, who was sum  Of each created being, waited not  For light celestial, and abortive fell.  Whence needs each lesser nature is but scant  Receptacle unto that Good, which knows  No limit, measur'd by itself alone.  Therefore your sight, of th' omnipresent Mind  A single beam, its origin must own  Surpassing far its utmost potency.  The ken, your world is gifted with, descends  In th' everlasting Justice as low down,  As eye doth in the sea; which though it mark  The bottom from the shore, in the wide main  Discerns it not; and ne'ertheless it is,  But hidden through its deepness.  Light is none,  Save that which cometh from the pure serene  Of ne'er disturbed ether: for the rest,  'Tis darkness all, or shadow of the flesh,  Or else its poison.  Here confess reveal'd  That covert, which hath hidden from thy search  The living justice, of the which thou mad'st  Such frequent question; for thou saidst--'A man  Is born on Indus' banks, and none is there  Who speaks of Christ, nor who doth read nor write,  And all his inclinations and his acts,  As far as human reason sees, are good,  And he offendeth not in word or deed.  But unbaptiz'd he dies, and void of faith.  Where is the justice that condemns him?  where  His blame, if he believeth not?'--What then,  And who art thou, that on the stool wouldst sit  To judge at distance of a thousand miles  With the short-sighted vision of a span?  To him, who subtilizes thus with me,  There would assuredly be room for doubt  Even to wonder, did not the safe word  Of scripture hold supreme authority.    \"O animals of clay!  O spirits gross I  The primal will, that in itself is good,  Hath from itself, the chief Good, ne'er been mov'd.  Justice consists in consonance with it,  Derivable by no created good,  Whose very cause depends upon its beam.\"    As on her nest the stork, that turns about  Unto her young, whom lately she hath fed,  While they with upward eyes do look on her;  So lifted I my gaze; and bending so  The ever-blessed image wav'd its wings,  Lab'ring with such deep counsel.  Wheeling round  It warbled, and did say: \"As are my notes  To thee, who understand'st them not, such is  Th' eternal judgment unto mortal ken.\"    Then still abiding in that ensign rang'd,  Wherewith the Romans over-awed the world,  Those burning splendours of the Holy Spirit  Took up the strain; and thus it spake again:  \"None ever hath ascended to this realm,  Who hath not a believer been in Christ,  Either before or after the blest limbs  Were nail'd upon the wood.  But lo! of those  Who call 'Christ, Christ,' there shall be many found,   In judgment, further off from him by far,  Than such, to whom his name was never known.  Christians like these the Ethiop shall condemn:  When that the two assemblages shall part;  One rich eternally, the other poor.    \"What may the Persians say unto your kings,  When they shall see that volume, in the which  All their dispraise is written, spread to view?  There amidst Albert's works shall that be read,  Which will give speedy motion to the pen,  When Prague shall mourn her desolated realm.  There shall be read the woe, that he doth work  With his adulterate money on the Seine,  Who by the tusk will perish: there be read  The thirsting pride, that maketh fool alike  The English and Scot, impatient of their bound.  There shall be seen the Spaniard's luxury,  The delicate living there of the Bohemian,  Who still to worth has been a willing stranger.  The halter of Jerusalem shall see  A unit for his virtue, for his vices  No less a mark than million.  He, who guards  The isle of fire by old Anchises honour'd  Shall find his avarice there and cowardice;  And better to denote his littleness,  The writing must be letters maim'd, that speak  Much in a narrow space.  All there shall know  His uncle and his brother's filthy doings,  Who so renown'd a nation and two crowns  Have bastardized.  And they, of Portugal  And Norway, there shall be expos'd with him  Of Ratza, who hath counterfeited ill  The coin of Venice.  O blest Hungary!  If thou no longer patiently abid'st  Thy ill-entreating! and, O blest Navarre!  If with thy mountainous girdle thou wouldst arm thee  In earnest of that day, e'en now are heard  Wailings and groans in Famagosta's streets  And Nicosia's, grudging at their beast,  Who keepeth even footing with the rest.\"          CANTO XX    When, disappearing, from our hemisphere,  The world's enlightener vanishes, and day  On all sides wasteth, suddenly the sky,  Erewhile irradiate only with his beam,  Is yet again unfolded, putting forth  Innumerable lights wherein one shines.  Of such vicissitude in heaven I thought,  As the great sign, that marshaleth the world  And the world's leaders, in the blessed beak  Was silent; for that all those living lights,  Waxing in splendour, burst forth into songs,  Such as from memory glide and fall away.    Sweet love! that dost apparel thee in smiles,  How lustrous was thy semblance in those sparkles,  Which merely are from holy thoughts inspir'd!    After the precious and bright beaming stones,  That did ingem the sixth light, ceas'd the chiming  Of their angelic bells; methought I heard  The murmuring of a river, that doth fall  From rock to rock transpicuous, making known  The richness of his spring-head: and as sound  Of cistern, at the fret-board, or of pipe,  Is, at the wind-hole, modulate and tun'd;  Thus up the neck, as it were hollow, rose  That murmuring of the eagle, and forthwith  Voice there assum'd, and thence along the beak  Issued in form of words, such as my heart  Did look for, on whose tables I inscrib'd them.    \"The part in me, that sees, and bears the sun,,  In mortal eagles,\" it began, \"must now  Be noted steadfastly: for of the fires,  That figure me, those, glittering in mine eye,  Are chief of all the greatest.  This, that shines  Midmost for pupil, was the same, who sang  The Holy Spirit's song, and bare about  The ark from town to town; now doth he know  The merit of his soul-impassion'd strains  By their well-fitted guerdon.  Of the five,  That make the circle of the vision, he  Who to the beak is nearest, comforted  The widow for her son: now doth he know  How dear he costeth not to follow Christ,  Both from experience of this pleasant life,  And of its opposite.  He next, who follows  In the circumference, for the over arch,  By true repenting slack'd the pace of death:  Now knoweth he, that the degrees of heav'n  Alter not, when through pious prayer below  Today's is made tomorrow's destiny.  The other following, with the laws and me,  To yield the shepherd room, pass'd o'er to Greece,  From good intent producing evil fruit:  Now knoweth he, how all the ill, deriv'd  From his well doing, doth not helm him aught,  Though it have brought destruction on the world.  That, which thou seest in "]]]
