Desirable improvements in the course are being advocated by  the directors and supervisors of the work. They are recommending  and introducing, where conditions will permit, the use of games,  athletics, folk dances, and the like. The movement should be promoted  in every possible way.    14. In the elementary schools Cleveland gives more than the average  amount of time to music, but in the high schools the subject is  developed only incidentally and is given no credit. It is a question  whether this arrangement is the right one, and in considering possible  extensions it should be remembered that there are other subjects of  far more pressing immediate necessity.    15. It is impossible in this brief report to discuss adequately so  complicated a matter as that of the teaching of foreign languages in  the high schools, but some of the most important of the questions  at issue have been indicated as matters which the school authorities  should continue to study until satisfactory solutions are reached.    16. Where school work in Cleveland is backward, it is because it has  not yet taken on the social point of view. Where it is progressive, it  is being developed on the basis of human needs. There is much of both  kinds of work in Cleveland.    17. In a city with a population so diversified as is that of  Cleveland, progress should be made steadily and consciously away from  city-wide uniformity in courses of study and methods of teaching.  There should be progressive differentiation of courses to meet the  widely varying needs of the different sorts of children in different  sections of the city.

Then on Greyfell, with the Wrath girt by his side, Sigurd  rode to the hall of Gripir, who told him of deeds to be and of the  fate that would befall him. In no wise was Sigurd troubled, but smiled  as a happy child, and together they talked of the deeds of the kings  of the Earth, of the wonders of Heaven, and of the Queen of the Sea.    And Sigurd told Gripir that he indeed was wise above all men, but for  himself had the Wrath been fashioned, and he was ready to ride to the  Glittering Heath. So they took leave of one another, and as the sky grew  blood-red in the West, and the birds were flying homeward, Sigurd drew  near to Regin's dwelling.      _Sigurd rideth to the Glittering Heath._      Again on the morrow morning doth Sigurd the Volsung ride,    And Regin, the Master of Masters, is faring by his side,    And they leave the dwelling of kings and ride the summer land,    Until at the eve of the day the hills are on either hand;    Then they wend up higher and higher, and over the heaths they fare    Till the moon shines broad on the midnight, and they sleep 'neath the         heavens bare;    And they waken and look behind them, and lo, the dawning of day    And the little land of the Helper and its valleys far away;    But the mountains rise before them, a wall exceeding great.      Then spake the Master of Masters: \"We have come to the garth and the gate;    There is youth and rest behind thee and many a thing to do,    There is many a fond desire, and each day born anew;    And the land of the Volsungs to conquer, and many a people's praise:    And for me there is rest it may be, and the peaceful end of days.    We have come to the garth and the gate; to the hall-door now shall we win,    Shall we go to look on the high-seat and see what sitteth therein?\"      \"Yea, and what else?\" said Sigurd, \"was thy tale but mockeries,    And have I been drifted hither on a wind of empty lies?\"      \"It was sooth, it was sooth,\" said Regin, \"and more might I have told    Had I heart and space to remember the deeds of the days of old.\"           *       *       *       *       *      Day-long they fared through the mountains, and that highway's fashioner,    Forsooth, was a fearful craftsman, and his hands the waters were,    And the heaped-up ice was his mattock, and the fire-blast was his man,    And never a whit he heeded though his walls were waste and wan,    And the guest-halls of that wayside great heaps of the ashes spent.    But, each as a man alone, through the sun-bright day they went,    And they rode till the moon rose upward, and the stars were small and fair,    Then they slept on the long-slaked ashes beneath the heavens bare;    And the cold dawn came and they wakened, and the King of the Dwarf-kind         seemed    As a thing of that wan land fashioned; but Sigurd glowed and gleamed    Amid a shadowless twilight by Greyfell's cloudy flank,    As a little space they abided while the latest star-world shrank;    On the backward road looked Regin and heard how Sigurd drew    The girths of Greyfell's saddle, and the voice of his sword he knew,           *       *       *       *       *      And his war-gear clanged and tinkled as he leapt to the saddle-stead:    And the sun rose up at their backs and the grey world changed to red,    And away to the west went Sigurd by the glory wreathed about,    But little and black was Regin as a fire that dieth out.    Day-long they rode the mountains by the crags exceeding old,    And the ash that the first of the Dwarf-kind found dull and quenched and         cold.    Then the moon in the mid-sky swam, and the stars were fair and pale,    And beneath the naked heaven they slept in an ash-grey dale;    And again at the dawn-dusk's ending they stood upon their feet,    And Sigurd donned his war-gear nor his eyes would Regin meet.      A clear streak widened in heaven low down above the earth;    And above it lay the cloud-flecks, and the sun, anigh its birth,    Unseen, their hosts was staining with the very hue of blood,    And ruddy by Greyfell's shoulder the Son of Sigmund stood.      Then spake the Master of Masters: \"What is thine hope this morn    That thou dightest thee, O Sigurd, to ride this world forlorn?\"      \"What needeth hope,\" said Sigurd, \"when the heart of the Volsungs turns    To the light of the Glittering Heath, and the house where the Waster burns?    I shall slay the Foe of the Gods, as thou badst me a while agone,    And then with the Gold and its wisdom shalt thou be left alone.\"      \"O Child,\" said the King of the Dwarf-kind, \"when the day at last comes         round    For the dread and the Dusk of the Gods, and the kin of the Wolf is unbound,    When thy sword shall hew the fire, and the wildfire beateth thy shield,    Shalt thou praise the wages of hope and the Gods that pitched the field?\"      \"O Foe of the Gods,\" said Sigurd, \"wouldst thou hide the evil thing,    And the curse that is greater than thou, lest death end thy labouring,    Lest the night should come upon thee amidst thy toil for nought?    It is me, it is me that thou fearest, if indeed I know thy thought;    Yea me, who would utterly light the face of all good and ill,    If not with the fruitful beams that the summer shall fulfill,    Then at least with the world a-blazing, and the glare of the grinded sword.           *       *       *       *       *      \"I have hearkened not nor heeded the words of thy fear and thy ruth:    Thou hast told thy tale and thy longing, and thereto I hearkened well:--    Let it lead thee up to heaven, let it lead thee down to hell,    The deed shall be done tomorrow: thou shalt have that measureless Gold,    And devour the garnered wisdom that blessed thy realm of old,    That hath lain unspent and begrudged in the very heart of hate:    With the blood and the might of thy brother thine hunger shalt thou sate;    And this deed shall be mine and thine; but take heed for what followeth         then!    Let each do after his kind! I shall do the deeds of men;    I shall harvest the field of their sowing, in the bed of their strewing         shall sleep;    To them shall I give my life-days, to the Gods my glory to keep.    But them with the wealth and the wisdom that the best of the Gods might         praise,    If thou shall indeed excel them and become the hope of the days,    Then me in turn hast thou conquered, and I shall be in turn    Thy fashioned brand of the battle through good and evil to burn,    Or the flame that sleeps in thy stithy for the gathered winds to blow,    When thou listest to do and undo and thine uttermost cunning to show.    But indeed I wot full surely that thou shalt follow thy kind;    And for all that cometh after, the Norns shall loose and bind.\"      Then his bridle-reins rang sweetly, and the warding-walls of death,    And Regin drew up to him, and the Wrath sang loud in the sheath,    And forth from that trench in the mountains by the westward way they ride;    And little and black goes Regin by the golden Volsung's side;           *       *       *       *       *      So ever they wended upward, and the midnight hour was o'er,    And the stars grew pale and paler, and failed from the heaven's floor,    And the moon was a long while dead, but where was the promise of day?    No change came over the darkness, no streak of the dawning grey;    No sound of the wind's uprising adown the night there ran:    It was blind as the Gaping Gulf ere the first of the worlds began.      Then athwart and athwart rode Sigurd and sought the walls of the pass,    But found no wall before him; and the road rang hard as brass    Beneath the hoofs of Greyfell, as up and up he trod:    --Was it the daylight of Hell, or the night of the doorway of God?    But lo, at the last a glimmer, and a light from the west there came,    And another and another, like points of far-off flame;    And they grew and brightened and gathered; and whiles together they ran    Like the moonwake over the waters; and whiles they were scant and wan,    Some greater and some lesser, like the boats of fishers laid    About the sea of midnight; and a dusky dawn they made,    A faint and glimmering twilight: So Sigurd strains his eyes,    And he sees how a land deserted all round about him lies    More changeless than mid-ocean, as fruitless as its floor:    Then the heart leaps up within him, for he knows that his journey is o'er,    And there he draweth bridle on the first of the Glittering Heath:    And the Wrath is waxen merry and sings in the golden sheath    As he leaps adown from Greyfell, and stands upon his feet,    And wends his ways through the twilight the Foe of the Gods to meet.      _Sigurd slayeth Fafnir the Serpent._      Nought Sigurd seeth of Regin, and nought he heeds of him,    As in watchful might and glory he strides the desert dim,    And behind him paceth Greyfell; but he deems the time o'erlong    Till he meet the great gold-warden, the over-lord of wrong.      So he wendeth midst the silence through the measureless desert place,    And beholds the countless glitter with wise and steadfast face,    Till him-seems in a little season that the flames grown somewhat wan,    And a grey thing glimmers before him, and becomes a mighty man,    One-eyed and ancient-seeming, in cloud-grey raiment clad;    A friendly man and glorious, and of visage smiling-glad:    Then content in Sigurd groweth because of his majesty,    And he heareth him speak in the desert as the wind of the winter sea:      \"Hail Sigurd! Give me thy greeting ere thy ways alone thou wend!\"      Said Sigurd: \"Hail! I greet thee, my friend and my fathers' friend.\"      \"Now whither away,\" said the elder, \"with the Steed and the ancient Sword?\"      \"To the"]]]
