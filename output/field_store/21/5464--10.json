(The obscure origin and history of feminine drawers have been      discussed from time to time in the _Intermediaire des Chercheurs      et Curieux_, especially vols. xxv, lii, and liii.)        Prof. Irving Rosse, of Washington, refers to \"New England      prudishness,\" and \"the colossal modesty of some New York      policemen, who in certain cases want to give written, rather than      oral testimony.\" He adds: \"I have known this sentiment carried to      such an extent in a Massachusetts small town, that a shop-keeper      was obliged to drape a small, but innocent, statuette displayed      in his window.\" (Irving Rosse, _Virginia Medical Monthly_,      October, 1892.) I am told that popular feeling in South Africa      would not permit the exhibition of the nude in the Art      Collections of Cape Town. Even in Italy, nude statues are      disfigured by the addition of tin fig-leaves, and sporadic      manifestations of horror at the presence of nude statues, even      when of most classic type, are liable to occur in all parts of      Europe, including France and Germany. (Examples of this are      recorded from time to time in _Sexual-reform_, published as an      appendix to _Geschlecht und Gesellschaft_.)        Some years ago, (1898), it was stated that the Philadelphia      _Ladies' Home Journal_ had decided to avoid, in future, all      reference to ladies' under-linen, because \"the treatment of this      subject in print calls for _minutiae_ of detail which is extremely      and pardonably offensive to refined and sensitive women.\"        \"A man, married twenty years, told me that he had never seen his      wife entirely nude. Such concealment of the external reproductive      organs, by married people, appears to be common. Judging from my      own inquiry, very few women care to look upon male nakedness, and      many women, though not wanting in esthetic feeling, find no      beauty in man's form. Some are positively repelled by the sight      of nakedness, even that of a husband or lover. On the contrary,      most men delight in gazing upon the uncovered figure of women.      It seems that only highly-cultivated and imaginative women enjoy      the spectacle of a finely-shaped nude man (especially after      attending art classes, and drawing from the nude, as I am told by      a lady artist). Or else the majority of women dissemble their      curiosity or admiration. A woman of seventy, mother of several      children, said to a young wife with whom I am acquainted: 'I have      never seen a naked man in my life.' This old lady's sister      confessed that she had never looked at _her own_ nakedness in the      whole course of her life. She said that it 'frightened' her. She      was the mother of three sons. A maiden woman of the same family      told her niece that women were 'disgusting, because they have      monthly discharges.' The niece suggested that women have no      choice in the matter, to which the aunt replied: 'I know that;      but it doesn't make them less disgusting,' I have heard of a girl      who died from haemorrhage of the womb, refusing, through shame, to      make the ailment known to her family. The misery suffered by some      women at the anticipation of a medical examination, appears to be      very acute. Husbands have told me of brides who sob and tremble      with fright on the wedding-night, the hysteria being sometimes      alarming. E, aged 25, refused her husband for six weeks after      marriage, exhibiting the greatest fear of his approach. Ignorance      of the nature of the sexual connection is often the cause of      exaggerated alarm. In Jersey, I used to hear of a bride who ran      to the window and screamed 'murder,' on the wedding-night.\"      (Private communication.)        At the present day it is not regarded as incompatible with      modesty to exhibit the lower part of the thigh when in swimming      costume, but it is immodest to exhibit the upper part of the      thigh. In swimming competitions, a minimum of clothing must be      combined with the demands of modesty. In England, the regulations      of the Swimming Clubs affiliated to the Amateur Swimming      Association, require that the male swimmer's costume shall extend      not less than eight inches from the bifurcation downward, and      that the female swimmer's costume shall extend to within not more      than three inches from the knee. (A prolonged discussion, we are      told, arose as to whether the costume should come to one, two, or      three inches from the knee, and the proposal of the youngest lady      swimmer present, that the costume ought to be very scanty, met      with little approval.) The modesty of women is thus seen to be      greater than that of men by, roughly speaking, about two inches.      The same difference may be seen in the sleeves; the male sleeve      must extend for two inches, the female sleeve four inches, down      the arm. (Daily Papers, September 26, 1898.)        \"At ----, bathing in a state of Nature was _de rigueur_ for the      _elite_ of the bathers, while our Sunday visitors from the slums      frequently made a great point of wearing bathing costumes; it was      frequently noticed that those who were most anxious to avoid      exposing their persons were distinguished by the foulness of      their language. My impression was that their foul-mindedness      deprived them of the consciousness of safety from coarse jests.      If I were bathing alone among blackguards, I should probably feel      uncomfortable myself, if without costume.\" (Private      communication.)        A lady in a little city of the south of Italy, told Paola      Lombroso that young middle-class girls there are not allowed to      go out except to Mass, and cannot even show themselves at the      window except under their mother's eye; yet they do not think it      necessary to have a cabin when sea-bathing, and even dispense      with a bathing costume without consciousness of immodesty. (P.      Lombroso, _Archivio di Psichiatria_, 1901, p. 306.)        \"A woman mentioned to me that a man came to her and told her in      confidence his distress of mind: he feared he had _corrupted_ his      wife because she got into a bath in his presence, with her baby,      and enjoyed his looking at her splashing about. He was deeply      distressed, thinking he must have done her harm, and destroyed      her modesty. The woman to whom this was said felt naturally      indignant, but also it gave her the feeling as if every man may      secretly despise a woman for the very things he teaches her, and      only meets her confiding delight with regret or dislike.\"      (Private communication.)        \"Women will occasionally be found to hide diseases and symptoms      from a bashfulness and modesty so great and perverse as to be      hardly credible,\" writes Dr. W. Wynn Westcott, an experienced      coroner. \"I have known several cases of female deaths, reported      as sudden, and of cause unknown, when the medical man called in      during the latter hours of life has been quite unaware that his      lady patient was dying of gangrene of a strangulated femoral      hernia, or was bleeding to death from the bowel, or from ruptured      varices of the vulva.\" (_British Medical Journal_, Feb. 29,      1908.)        The foregoing selection of facts might, of course, be      indefinitely enlarged, since I have not generally quoted from any      previous collection of facts bearing on the question of modesty.      Such collections may be found in Ploss and Max Bartels _Das      Weib_, a work that is constantly appearing in new and enlarged      editions; Herbert Spencer, _Descriptive Sociology_ (especially      under such headings as \"Clothing,\" \"Moral Sentiments,\" and      \"AEsthetic Products\"); W.G. Sumner, _Folkways_, Ch. XI;      Mantegazza, _Amori degli Uomini_, Chapter II; Westermarck,      _Marriage_, Chapter IX; Letourneau, _L'Evolution de la Morale_,      pp. 126 et seq.; G. Mortimer, _Chapters on Human Love_, Chapter      IV; and in the general anthropological works of Waitz-Gerland,      Peschel, Ratzel and others.      FOOTNOTES:    [1] The earliest theory I have met with is that of St. Augustine, who  states (_De Civitate Dei_, Bk. XIV, Ch. XVII) that erections of the penis  never occurred until after the Fall of Man. It was the occurrence of this  \"shameless novelty\" which made nakedness indecent. This theory fails to  account for modesty in women.    [2] Guyau, _L'Irreligion de l'Avenir_, Ch. VII.    [3] Timidity, as understood by Dugas, in his interesting essay on that  subject, is probably most remote. Dr. H. Campbell's \"morbid shyness\"  (_British Medical Journal_, September 26, 1896) is, in part, identical  with timidity, in part, with modesty. The matter is further complicated by  the fact that modesty itself has in English (like virtue) two distinct  meanings. In its original form it has no special connection with sex or  women, but may rather be considered as a masculine virtue. Cicero regards  \"modestia\" as the equivalent of the Greek sophrosune. This is the  \"modesty\" which Mary Wollstonecraft eulogized in the last century, the  outcome of knowledge and reflection, \"soberness of mind,\" \"the graceful  calm virtue of maturity.\" In French, it is possible to avoid the  confusion, and _modestie_ is entirely distinct from _pudeur_. It is, of  course, mainly with _pudeur_ that I am here concerned.          II.

Then he      relaxed and added: 'Anyway I love Symonds. Who could fail to love      a man who could write such a letter? I suppose he will yet have      to be answered, damn 'im!'\"    It is clear that these conversations considerably diminish the force of  the declaration in Whitman's letter. We see that the letter which, on the  face of it, might have represented the swift and indignant reaction of a  man who, suddenly faced by the possibility that his work may be  interpreted in a perverse sense, emphatically repudiates that  interpretation, was really nothing of the kind. Symonds for at least  eighteen years had been gently, considerately, even humbly, yet  persistently, asking the same perfectly legitimate question. If the answer  was really an emphatic no, it would more naturally have been made in 1872  than 1890. Moreover, in the face of this ever-recurring question, Whitman  constantly speaks to his friends of his great affection for Symonds and  his admiration for his intellectual cuteness, feelings that would both be  singularly out of place if applied to a man who was all the time  suggesting the possibility that his writings contained inferences that  were \"terrible,\" \"morbid,\" and \"damnable.\" Evidently, during all those  years, Whitman could not decide what to reply. On the one hand he was  moved by his horror of being questioned, by his caution, by his natural  aversion to express approval of anything that could be called unnatural or  abnormal. On the other hand, he was moved by the desire to let his work  speak for itself, by his declared determination to leave everything open,  and possibly by a more or less conscious sympathy with the inferences  presented to him. It was not until the last years of his life, when his  sexual life belonged to the past, when weakness was gaining on him, when  he wished to put aside every drain on his energies, that--being  constitutionally incapable of a balanced scientific statement--he chose  the simplest and easiest solution of the difficulty.[99]    Concerning another great modern writer--Paul Verlaine, the first of modern  French poets--it seems possible to speak with less hesitation. A man who  possessed in fullest measure the irresponsible impressionability of  genius, Verlaine--as his work shows and as he himself admitted--all his  life oscillated between normal and homosexual love, at one period  attracted to women, at another to men. He was without doubt, it seems to  me, bisexual. An early connection with another young poet, Arthur Rimbaud,  terminated in a violent quarrel with his friend, and led to Verlaine's  imprisonment at Mons. In after-years he gave expression to the exalted  passion of this relationship--_mon grand peche radieux_--in _Laeti et  Errabundi_, published in the volume entitled _Parallelement_; and in later  poems he has told of less passionate and less sensual relationships which  yet were more than friendship, for instance, in the poem, \"_Mon ami, ma  plus belle amitie, ma Meilleure_\" in _Bonheur_.[100]    In this brief glance at some of the ethnographical, historical, religious,  and literary aspects of homosexual passion there is one other phenomenon  which may be mentioned. This is the alleged fact that, while the phenomena  exist to some extent everywhere, we seem to find a special proclivity to  homosexuality (whether or not involving a greater frequency of congenital  inversion is not usually clear) among certain races and in certain  regions.[101] In Europe this would be best illustrated by the case of  southern Italy, which in this respect is held to be distinct from northern  Italy, although Italians generally are franker than men of northern race  in admitting their sexual practices.[102] How far the supposed greater  homosexuality of southern Italy may be due to Greek influence and Greek  blood it is not very easy to say.    It must be remembered that, in dealing with a northern country like  England, homosexual phenomena do not present themselves in the same way as  they do in southern Italy today, or in ancient Greece. In Greece the  homosexual impulse was recognized and idealized; a man could be an open  homosexual lover, and yet, like Epaminondas, be a great and honored  citizen of his country. There was no reason whatever why a man, who in  mental and physical constitution was perfectly normal, should not adopt a  custom that was regarded as respectable, and sometimes as even specially  honorable. But it is quite otherwise today in a country like England or  the United States.[103] In these countries all our traditions and all our  moral ideals, as well as the law, are energetically opposed to every  manifestation of homosexual passion. It requires a very strong impetus to  go against this compact social force which, on every side, constrains the  individual into the paths of heterosexual love. That impetus, in a  well-bred individual who leads the normal life of his fellow-men and who  feels the ordinary degree of respect for the social feeling surrounding  him, can only be supplied by a fundamental--usually, it is probable,  inborn--perversion of the sexual instinct, rendering the individual  organically abnormal. It is with this fundamental abnormality, usually  called sexual inversion, that we shall here be concerned. There is no  evidence to show that homosexuality in Greece was a congenital perversion,  although it appears that Coelius Aurelianus affirms that in the opinion of  Parmenides it was hereditary. Aristotle also, in his fragment on physical  love, though treating the whole matter with indulgence, seems to have  distinguished abnormal congenital homosexuality from acquired homosexual  vice. Doubtless in a certain proportion of cases the impulse was organic,  and it may well be that there was an organic and racial predisposition to  homosexuality among the Greeks, or, at all events, the Dorians. But the  state of social feeling, however it originated, induced a large proportion  of the ordinary population to adopt homosexuality as a fashion, or, it may  be said, the environment was peculiarly favorable to the development of  latent homosexual tendencies. So that any given number of homosexual  persons among the Greeks would have presented a far smaller proportion of  constitutionally abnormal individuals than a like number in England.  In a similar manner--though I do not regard the analogy as  complete--infanticide or the exposition of children was practised in some  of the early Greek States by parents who were completely healthy and  normal; in England a married woman who destroys her child is in nearly  every case demonstrably diseased or abnormal. For this reason I am unable  to see that homosexuality in ancient Greece--while of great interest as a  social and psychological problem--throws light on sexual inversion as we  know it in England or the United States.    Concerning the wide prevalence of sexual inversion and of homosexual  phenomena generally, there can be no manner of doubt. This question has  been most fully investigated in Germany. In Berlin, Moll states that he  has himself seen between 600 and 700 homosexual persons and heard of some  250 to 350 others. Hirschfeld states that he has known over 10,000  homosexual persons.    There are, I am informed, several large cafes in Berlin which are almost  exclusively patronized by inverts who come here to flirt and make  acquaintances; as these cafes are frequented by male street prostitutes  (Pupenjunge) the invert risks being blackmailed or robbed if he goes home  or to a hotel with a cafe acquaintance. There are also a considerable  number of homosexual _Kneipen_, small and unpretentious bar-rooms, which  are really male brothels, the inmates being sexually normal working men  and boys, out of employment or in quest of a few marks as pocket money;  these places are regarded by inverts as very safe, as the proprietors  insist on good order and allow no extortion, while the police, though of  course aware of their existence, never interfere. Homosexual cafes for  women are also found in Berlin.    There is some reason for believing that homosexuality is especially  prominent in Germany and among Germans. I have elsewhere referred to the  highly emotional and sentimental traits which have frequently marked  German friendships. Germany is the only country in which there is a  definite and well-supported movement for the defense and social  rehabilitation of inverts. The study of sexual inversion began in Germany,  and the scientific and literary publications dealing with homosexuality  issued from the German press probably surpass in quantity and importance  those issued from all other countries put together. The homosexual  tendencies of Germans outside Germany have been noted in various  countries. Among my English cases I have found that a strain of German  blood occurs much more frequently than we are entitled to expect; Parisian  prostitutes are said to be aware of the homosexual tastes of Germans; it  is significant that (as a German invert familiar with Turkey informed  Naecke), at Constantinople, the procurers, who naturally supply girls as  well as youths, regard Germans and Austrians as more tending to  homosexuality than the foreigners from any other land. Germans usually  deny, however, that there is any special German proclivity to inversion,  and it would not appear that such statistics as are available (though all  such statistics cannot be regarded as more than approximations) show any  pronounced predominance of inversion among Germans. It is to Hirschfeld  that we owe the chief attempt to gain some notion of the percentage of  homosexual persons among the general population.[104] It may be said to  vary in different regions and more especially in different occupations,  from 1 to 10 per cent. But the average when the individuals belonging to a  large number of groups"]]]
