One day, my brother-in-law said he  would pay my expenses to and fro. I thanked him, and took fresh courage,  and still kept on praying. Then the same good brother gave me money for  a dress; then a friend furnished other articles, and soon, I was en  route for the quaint old city by the sea. Every step was accomplished by  the simple way of prayer; and, when I slept, late that night, in a cosy  room at the Methodist parsonage in N.B., I could look back over the last  few weeks, and thank God for the _power of prayer_. But the best of it  all was the lesson I had learned--one which I shall never forget, while  memory holds her magic power--to carry _everything_ to God in prayer; to  trust him in every matter, however small; and this is the whole secret  of the power that lies in prayer.\"    \"I found another lady visitor at my friend's and we were to share the  same bed. This was a little trial; I had to ask the Lord to give me  patience--and He did. One night, I was very restless and nervous; I  could not sleep. I knew I was disturbing my friend--soon she said,  'Annie, I am going to ask the Lord to come and put you to sleep. Now,  lay still, and in five minutes you will be all right'. I did so, also  breathing the words, 'Give me sleep, dear Saviour.' The room seemed to  be full of a soft, soothing influence, and I fell asleep. Once only in  the night I awoke, but soon went asleep. When I awoke in the morning,  rested and refreshed, Tillie, who was dressing near me, looked up with  her pleasant smile and said, 'Annie, how wonderful it was. You were  asleep in less than five minutes. It seemed as though Jesus stood close  by your side; I could _almost see_ Him, I felt so clearly His presence.  He is here now, Annie; can't you feel Him near? He was very good to you  last night.' Yes, indeed, I felt the influence of His presence, and, all  day, whenever I entered the room, I felt it, and it seemed as though I  must tread softly, it was so like holy ground. This feeling lasted  through my stay, and, last Winter, while again visiting the home of my  friends, it all came back to me again. This beautiful influence has ever  kept with me, and I never close my eyes in sleep until I say, 'Oh, Lord,  breathe upon me the sweet spirit of sleep.' However weary, sick or  nervous I may be, I feel that the soothing power will come; and, with my  hand in His, I rest peacefully, at last.\"      PRAYING FOR A NEW HAT.        \"Whatsoever thing ye ask in _My_ name\"--      \"For a long while I had been without money, and my need was very great.  I wanted a new hat so much; and the question arose in my mind, 'What am  I going to do about it?' As I had no human arm to depend on for  anything, of course there was only one way for me to do--ask the Lord  for money to get me a hat. With me, to think is to act, and so I told  the Lord all about it, asking, if it was His will, to send me, in His  own way, money for the article I needed. Day after day passed, and I  felt almost discouraged. One day, a letter came from a lady friend I had  never seen, enclosing one dollar. I bought my hat--neither could I have  used that dollar for another purpose. Soon after this, my physician  ordered something for me. I had no money to get it, but said I would get  it soon as I could. Three weeks passed, and no money came. Then I asked  the Lord for enough to get my medicine. Another letter came from an old  nurse, with a gift of one dollar. I had my medicine. Time after time, I  have not had wherewith to send my letters, and, as I have a large  correspondence, it often is a real trouble. The only way I have to do is  to _pray for it,_ and always, in some way, it comes; not in _my  way_--not just as soon as I ask for it--but in His own way, He always  provides. I have learned to trust and not be afraid, even though the  clouds hang heavy, and I see no ray of light, the promise is there, and  for me, 'I will _never_ leave thee, or forsake thee.' I am so entirely  dependent on Him for everything that sometimes, in little matters, my  faith will, for a brief season, droop. Sometimes I have to plead and  plead over again some particular promises; but these times of waiting on  Him only strengthen me for future conflicts. 'Wait on the Lord, and he  shall renew thy strength,' comes in beautifully on such occasions. No  human being to help me; no one but God. Sometimes, when I sit alone,  such a flood of feelings come over me, I well nigh sink. Loneliness,  homesickness, and the great want in every human heart of sympathy and  love, leave me, for a moment, without hope or faith; but, when the heart  is weakest, and the need greatest, the loving Saviour is nearest. 'Like  as a mother comforteth her child, so does He comfort me;' and then,  soothed by his power and love, how the aching heart rests 'by the still  waters, and in the green pastures.' There is nothing but prayer for the  helpless sinner; nothing else will bring us into loving companionship  with the Lord. We may go to Him always, with every trial, need or  sorrow. He is ever waiting--ever ready to hear and answer.\"      PRAYING FOR A SEWING MACHINE.      \"One day a lady friend said to me: 'Would you like some nice sewing,  easy to do?' I answered, 'Yes.' 'Have you a sewing machine?' 'I have  not, but am praying for one.' 'That is right; so you believe you will  have it by praying for it?' I replied: 'If the Lord thinks I need it, He  will send it.' I had learned to use my sister's, but I wanted one of my  own, to use just when I felt like it. So the thought kept in my heart,  'Why can't I pray for one?' And yet it seemed foolish to go in prayer to  God for such a simple thing, but I had not then learned that _all  things,_ with Him, meant every wish and want of the human heart. But  there was no other way. He must send my machine, or I could have none. I  prayed very earnestly. After a few weeks of waiting, one golden winter  morning it came--my beautiful machine--just what I wanted. This seemed  so wonderful to me, that it seemed to bring me into nearer companionship  with the Lord, and ever after, whatever I needed, I went directly to Him  for. A ministerial friend once asked me what it was I had covered up on  the stand. I told him it was my piano, taking the cover aside and  showing him at once how my beautiful sewing machine worked. _'What tune  do you play oftenest?'_ he asked. _'Rock of Ages_ is its favorite one,  and I never sew without singing it.'\"        MONEY FOR POSTAGE.      \"One day I opened my port-monnaie to get change for some little needful,  when I found I had but ten cents. I used five of it. As visions of six  or seven letters and many little things I needed came up before me, I  said aloud: 'The Lord will have to send me some money pretty soon.' I  think once through the day I prayed for some money, but felt no  uneasiness about it. That evening a lady friend called to say good-by  for the winter, and as she left gave me _fifty cents for postage._ While  I was calling He answered me. About a week before this, I thought I  would ask the Lord for $5 for my physician. He had come so faithfully,  day after day, without ever expecting one dollar, because I had told him  freely my circumstances. But I felt I must give him something for a gift  at least. So I asked for five dollars. Day after day passed away, and I  thought perhaps the Lord did not want me to have it. But still I prayed,  asking it for His will, not mine. One morning a letter came from a very  dear friend, containing a check for the amount for which I had prayed,  and a little beside. It seemed such a signal answer to my prayer, that I  could scarcely speak, and in my heart a glad prayer of thanksgiving went  up to Him, who had told me _to ask and I should receive._ A friend, to  whom I told this, said: 'Now you need this money yourself; I would not  give it to the doctor now--wait awhile.' 'But,' I replied, 'I dare not  do it. I need it, I know, but I asked God for it for my doctor, and I  must give it.' And here let me say, when we ask God for money, it is  sacred, and must be spent only to please Him.\"      PRAYING FOR A BIBLE.      \"For a long while it has been my habit to be entirely guided for the day  by the first verse in the Bible on which my eyes rested. While dressing  for the day, I glance at the open page, or sometimes turning over the  leaves. But my old Bible was poor print and small, and it troubled me  for a long while. So I thought I would ask the Lord to send me a new  one. I told Him all about it. One day, this Summer, the postman brought  me a package of magazines and a letter. I began to undo the package,  eager to scan their welcome pages. My sister laughingly said she would  read my letter, and suiting the action to the word, opened the envelope.  I really did not mind what she was doing, until she said: 'Why there is  some money here, but no letter.' So she handed me the half sheet of  paper, with the money folded inside. I looked it over, and there were  only these words in pencil: 'For a Bible, and three dollars.' We looked  at each other; I could not say a word, until she said, 'What does it all  mean? 'I answered, 'The Lord sent it, I know; where could it come from?'  It was wonderful--wonderful because I could not remember as I ever told  any one that I was praying for a Bible.\"      A SPRING MATTRESS.      \"Last Summer, when I bought my bedstead, I did not have money to get  either springs or a mattress, so I fixed up a clean, straw bed, and  covered it nicely with a thick comfortable. It was pretty hard--I did  not rest well. So, one sleepless night, I said aloud, 'I will just ask  the Lord to send me a set of springs.' I kept on day by day. When I felt  the severe pain which"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/11565"],[0,"Friends, though divided: A Tale of the Civil War (#13)"],[1,"man  stared Harry in the face, and uttered another exclamation, this time of  surprise. Harry, to his dismay, saw that the man with whom he had come  in contact was the preacher whom he had left gagged on the guardroom bed  at Westminster.    \"A traitor! A spy!\" shouted the preacher, at the top of his voice,  seizing Harry by the doublet. The latter shook himself free just as  Jacob, jumping in the air, brought his hand down with all his force on  the top of the steeple hat, wedging it over the eyes of the little man.  Before any further effort could be made to seize them, the two lads  dived through the crowd, and dashed down a lane leading toward the  river.    This sudden interruption to the service caused considerable excitement,  and the little preacher, on being extricated from his hat, furiously  proclaimed that the lad he had seized, dressed as an apprentice, was a  malignant, who had been taken prisoner at Brentford, and who had foully  ill-treated him in a cell in the guardroom at Finsbury. Instantly a  number of men set off in pursuit.    \"What had we best do, Jacob?\" Harry said, as he heard the clattering of  feet behind them.    \"We had best jump into a boat,\" Jacob said, \"and row for it. It is dark  now, and we shall soon be out of their sight.\"    At the bottom of the lane were some stairs, and at these a number of  boats. As it was late in the evening, and the night a foul one, the  watermen, not anticipating fares, had left, and the boys, leaping into a  boat, put out the sculls, and rowed into the stream, just as their  pursuers were heard coming down the lane.    \"Which way shall we go?\" Harry said.    \"We had better shoot the bridge,\" Jacob replied. \"Canst row well?\"    \"Yes,\" Harry said; \"I have practiced at Abingdon with an oar.\"    \"Then take the sculls,\" Jacob said, \"and I will steer. It is a risky  matter going through the bridge, I tell you, at half tide. Sit steady,  whatever you do. Here they come in pursuit, Roger. Bend to the sculls,\"  and in a couple of minutes they reached the bridge.    \"Steady, steady,\" shouted Jacob, as the boat shot a fall, some eight  feet in depth, with the rapidity of an arrow. For a moment it was tossed  and whirled about in the seething waves below, and then, thanks to  Jacob's presence of mind and Harry's obedience to his orders, it emerged  safely into the smooth water below the bridge. Harry now gave up one of  the sculls to Jacob, and the two boys rowed hard down the stream.    \"Will they follow, think you?\" Harry said.    \"I don't think,\" Jacob laughed, \"that any of those black-coated gentry  will care for shooting the bridge. They will run down below, and take  boat there; and as there are sure to be hands waiting to carry fares out  to the ships in the pool, they will gain fast upon us when once they are  under way.\"    The wind was blowing briskly with them, and the tide running strong, and  at a great pace they passed the ships lying at anchor.    \"There is the Tower,\" Jacob said; \"with whose inside we may chance to  make acquaintance, if we are caught. Look,\" he said, \"there is a boat  behind us, rowed by four oars! I fear that it is our pursuers.\"    \"Had we not better land, and take our chance?\" Harry said.    \"We might have done so at first,\" Jacob said; \"it is too late now. We  must row for it. Look,\" he continued, \"there is a bark coming along  after the boat. She has got her sails up already, and the wind is  bringing her along grandly. She sails faster than they row, and if she  comes up to us before they overtake us, it may be that the captain will  take us in tow. These sea-dogs are always kindly.\"    The boat that the boys had seized was, fortunately, a very light and  fast one, while that in pursuit was large and heavy, and the four  watermen had to carry six sitters. Consequently, they gained but very  slowly upon the fugitives. Presently a shot from a pistol whizzed over  the boys' heads.    \"I did not bargain for this, friend Roger,\" Jacob said. \"My head is made  rather for plots and conspiracies than for withstanding the contact of  lead.\"    \"Row away!\" Harry said. \"Here is the ship just alongside now.\"    As the vessel, which was a coaster, came along, the crew looked over the  side, their attention, being called by the sound of the pistol and the  shouts of those in chase.    \"Throw us a rope, sir,\" Jacob shouted. \"We are not malefactors, but have  been up to a boyish freak, and shall be heavily punished if we are  caught.\"    Again the pistol rang out behind, and one of the Sailors threw a rope to  the boys. It was caught, and in a minute the boat was gliding rapidly  along in the wake of the ship. She was then pulled up alongside, the  boys clambered on board, and the boat was sent adrift, The pursuers  continued the chase for a few minutes longer, but seeing the ship  gradually drawing away from them, they desisted, and turned in toward  shore.    \"And who are you?\" the captain of the brig said.    \"We are apprentices, as you see,\" Jacob said. \"We were listening to some  preaching at Paul's Cross. In trying to get out from the throng--being  at length weary of the long-winded talk of the preacher--we trod upon  the feet of a worthy divine. He, refusing to receive our apologies, took  the matter roughly, and seeing that the crowd of Puritans around were  going to treat us as malignant roisterers, we took the liberty of  driving the hat of our assailant over his eyes, and bolting. Assuredly,  had we been caught, we should have been put in the stocks and whipped,  even if worse pains and penalties had not befallen us, for ill-treatment  of one of those who are now the masters of London.\"    \"It was a foolish freak,\" the captain said, \"and in these days such  freaks are treated as crimes. It is well that I came along. What do you  purpose to do now?\"    \"We would fain be put ashore, sir, somewhere in Kent, so that we may  make our way back again. Our figures could not have been observed beyond  that we were apprentices, and we can enter the city quietly, without  fear of detection.\"    The wind dropped in the evening, and, the tide turning, the captain  brought to anchor. In the morning he sailed forward again. When he  neared Gravesend he saw a vessel lying in the stream.    \"That is a Parliament ship,\" he said.    At that moment another vessel of about the same size as that in which  they were was passing her. She fired a gun, and the ship at once dropped  her sails and brought up.    \"What can she be doing now, arresting the passage of ships on their way  down? If your crime had been a serious one, I should have thought that a  message must have been brought down in the night for her to search  vessels coming down stream for the persons of fugitives. What say you,  lads? Have you told me the truth?\"    \"We have told you the truth, sir,\" Harry said; \"but not the whole truth.  The circumstances are exactly as my friend related them. But he omitted  to say that the preacher recognized in me one of a Cavalier family, and  that they may suspect that I was in London on business of the king's.\"    \"Is that so?\" the captain said. \"In that case, your position is a  perilous one. It is clear that they do not know the name of the ship in  which you are embarked, or they would not have stopped the one which we  see far ahead. If they search the ship, they are sure to find you.\"    \"Can you swim, Jacob?\" Harry asked the other.    He nodded.    \"There is a point,\" Harry said, \"between this and the vessel of war, and  if you sail close to that you will for a minute or two be hidden from  the view of those on her deck. If you will take your ship close to that  corner we will jump overboard and swim on shore. If then your vessel is  stopped you can well say that you have no fugitives on board, and let  them search.\"    The captain thought the plan a good one, and at once the vessel's head  was steered over toward the side to which Harry had pointed. As they  neared the corner they for a minute lost sight of the hull of the  man-of-war, and the boys, with a word of thanks and farewell to the  captain, plunged over and swam to the bank, which was but some thirty  yards away. Climbing it, they lay down among the grass, and watched the  progress of the vessel. She, like the one before, was brought up by a  gun from the man-of-war, and a boat from the latter put out and remained  by her side for half an hour. Then they saw the boat return, the vessel  hoist her sails again, and go on her way.    \"This is a nice position into which you have brought me, Master Roger,\"  Jacob said. \"My first step in taking part in plots and conspiracies does  not appear to me to lead to the end which I looked for. However, I am  sick of the shop, and shall be glad of a turn of freedom. Now let us  make our way across the marshes to the high land. It is but twenty miles  to walk to London, if that be really your intent.\"    \"I shall not return to London myself,\" Harry said; \"but shall make my  way back to Oxford. It would be dangerous now for me to appear, and I  doubt not that a sharp hue and cry will be kept up. In your case it is  different, for as you have been long an apprentice, and as your face  will be entirely unknown to any of them, there will be little chance of  your being detected.\"    \"I would much rather go with you to Oxford,\" the lad said. \"I am weary  of velvets and silks, and though I do not know that wars and battles  will be more to my taste, I would fain try them also. You are a  gentleman, and high in the trust of the king and those around him. If  you will take me with you as your servant I will be a faithful knave to  you, and doubt not that as you profit by your advantages, some of the  good will fall to my share also.\"    \"In faith,\" Harry said, \"I should hardly like you to be my servant,  Jacob, although I have no other office to bestow at present. But if you  come with me you shall be rather in the light of a major-domo, though I"]]]
