Milk enough to make  it quite soft; four eggs; a little cinnamon; a spoonful of rose-water,  or lemon-brandy, if you have it; a tea-cupful of molasses, or sugar to  your taste, if you prefer it; a few dry, clean raisins, sprinkled in,  and stirred up thoroughly, is all that is necessary. It should bake or  boil two hours.      RENNET PUDDING.    If your husband brings home company when you are unprepared, rennet  pudding may be made at five minutes' notice; provided you keep a piece  of calf's rennet ready prepared soaking in a bottle of wine. One glass  of this wine to a quart of milk will make a sort of cold custard.  Sweetened with white sugar, and spiced with nutmeg, it is very good.  It should be eaten immediately; in a few hours, it begins to curdle.      CUSTARD PUDDINGS.    Custard puddings sufficiently good for common use can be made with  five eggs to a quart of milk, sweetened with brown sugar, and spiced  with cinnamon, or nutmeg, and very little salt. It is well to boil  your milk, and set it away till it gets cold. Boiling milk enriches it  so much, that boiled skim-milk is about as good as new milk. A little  cinnamon, or lemon peel, or peach leaves, if you do not dislike the  taste, boiled in the milk, and afterwards strained from it, give a  pleasant flavor. Bake fifteen or twenty minutes.      RICE PUDDINGS.    If you want a common rice pudding to retain its flavor, do not soak  it, or put it in to boil when the water is cold. Wash it, tie it in  a bag, leave plenty of room for it to swell, throw it in when the  water boils, and let it boil about an hour and a half. The same sauce  answers for all these kinds of puddings. If you have rice left cold,  break it up in a little warm milk, pour custard over it, and bake it  as long as you should custard. It makes very good puddings and pies.      BIRD'S NEST PUDDING.    If you wish to make what is called 'bird's nest puddings,' prepare  your custard,--take eight or ten pleasant apples, pare them, and dig  out the core, but leave them whole, set them in a pudding dish, pour  your custard over them, and bake them about thirty minutes.      APPLE PUDDING.    A plain, unexpensive apple pudding may be made by rolling out a bit of  common pie-crust, and filling it full of quartered apples; tied up in  a bag, and boiled an hour and a half; if the apples are sweet, it will  take two hours; for acid things cook easily. Some people like little  dumplings, made by rolling up one apple, pared and cored, in a piece  of crust, and tying them up in spots all over the bag. These do not  need to be boiled more than an hour: three quarters is enough, if the  apples are tender.    Take sweet, or pleasant flavored apples, pare them, and bore out the  core, without cutting the apple in two Pill up the holes with washed  rice, boil them in a bag, tied very tight, an hour, or hour and a  half. Each apple should be tied up separately, in different corners of  the pudding bag.      CHERRY PUDDING.    For cherry dumpling, make a paste about as rich as you make  short-cake; roll it out, and put in a pint and a half, or a quart of  cherries, according to the size of your family. Double the crust over  the fruit, tie it up tight in a bag, and boil one hour and a half.      CRANBERRY PUDDING.    A pint of cranberries stirred into a quart of batter, made like a  batter pudding, but very little stiffer, is very nice, eaten with  sweet sauce.      WHORTLEBERRY PUDDING.    Whortleberries are good both in flour and Indian puddings. A pint of  milk, with a little salt and a little molasses, stirred quite stiff  with Indian meal, and a quart of berries stirred in gradually with a  spoon, makes a good-sized pudding. Leave room for it to swell; and let  it boil three hours.    When you put them into flour, make your pudding just like batter  puddings; but considerably thicker, or the berries will sink. Two  hours is plenty long enough to boil No pudding should be put in till  the water boils. Leave room to swell.      PLUM PUDDING.    If you wish to make a really nice, soft, custard-like plum pudding,  pound six crackers, or dried crusts of light bread, fine, and soak  them over night in milk enough to cover them; put them in about three  pints of milk, beat up six eggs, put in a little lemon-brandy, a whole  nutmeg, and about three quarters of a pound of raisins which have been  rubbed in flour. Bake it two hours, or perhaps a little short of that.  It is easy to judge from the appearance whether it is done.    The surest way of making a light, rich plum pudding, is to spread  slices of sweet light bread plentifully with butter; on each side of  the slices spread abundantly raisins, or currants, nicely prepared;  when they are all heaped up in a dish, cover them with milk, eggs,  sugar and spice, well beat up, and prepared just as you do for  custards. Let it bake about an hour.    One sauce answers for common use for all sorts of puddings.  Flour-and-water stirred into boiling water, sweetened to your taste  with either molasses or sugar, according to your ideas of economy; a  great spoonful of rose-water, if you have it; butter half as big as a  hen's egg. If you want to make it very nice, put in a glass of wine,  and grate nutmeg on the top.    When you wish better sauce than common, take a quarter of a pound of  butter and the same of sugar, mould them well together with your hand,  add a little wine, if you choose. Make it into a lump, set it away to  cool, and grate nutmeg over it.      HASTY PUDDING.    Boil water, a quart, three pints, or two quarts, according to the  size of your family; sift your meal, stir five or six spoonfuls of it  thoroughly into a bowl of water; when the water in the kettle boils,  pour into it the contents of the bowl; stir it well, and let it boil  up thick; put in salt to suit your own taste, then stand over the  kettle, and sprinkle in meal, handful after handful, stirring it very  thoroughly all the time, and letting it boil between whiles. When it  is so thick that you stir it with great difficulty, it is about right.  It takes about half an hour's cooking. Eat it with milk or molasses.  Either Indian meal or rye meal may be used. If the system is in a  restricted state, nothing can be better than _rye_ hasty pudding and  _West India_ molasses. This diet would save many a one the horrors of  dyspepsia.           *       *       *       *       *          CHEAP CUSTARDS.      One quart of milk, boiled; when boiling, add three table spoonfuls  of ground rice, or rice that is boiled, mixed smooth and fine in cold  milk, and one egg beaten; give it one boil up, and sweeten to your  taste; peach leaves, or any spice you please, boiled in the milk.           *       *       *       *       *          COMMON PIES.      MINCE PIES.    Boil a tender, nice piece of beef--any piece that is clear from  sinews and gristle; boil it till it is perfectly tender When it is  cold, chop it very fine, and be very careful to get out every particle  of bone and gristle. The suet is sweeter and better to boil half an  hour or more in the liquor the beef has been boiled in; but few people  do this. Pare, core, and chop the apples fine. If you use raisins,  stone them. If you use currants, wash and dry them at the fire. Two  pounds of beef, after it is chopped; three quarters of a pound of  suet; one pound and a quarter of sugar; three pounds of apples; two  pounds of currants, or raisins. Put in a gill of brandy; lemon-brandy  is better, if you have any prepared. Make it quite moist with new  cider. I should not think a quart would be too much; the more moist  the better, if it does not spill out into the oven. A very little  pepper. If you use corn meat, or tongue, for pies, it should be  well soaked, and boiled very tender. If you use fresh beef, salt  is necessary in the seasoning. One ounce of cinnamon, one ounce of  cloves. Two nutmegs add to the pleasantness of the flavor; and a bit  of sweet butter put upon the top of each pie, makes them rich; but  these are not necessary. Baked three quarters of an hour. If your  apples are rather sweet, grate in a whole lemon.      PUMPKIN AND SQUASH PIE.    For common family pumpkin pies, three eggs do very well to a quart of  milk. Stew your pumpkin, and strain it through a sieve, or colander.  Take out the seeds, and pare the pumpkin, or squash, before you stew  it; but do not scrape the inside; the part nearest the seed is the  sweetest part of the squash. Stir in the stewed pumpkin, till it is as  thick as you can stir it round rapidly and easily. If you want to make  your pie richer, make it thinner, and add another egg. One egg to a  quart of milk makes very decent pies. Sweeten it to your taste, with  molasses or sugar; some pumpkins require more sweetening than others.  Two tea-spoonfuls of salt; two great spoonfuls of sifted cinnamon;  one great spoonful of ginger. Ginger will answer very well alone for  spice, if you use enough of it. The outside of a lemon grated in is  nice. The more eggs, the better the pie; some put an egg to a gill  of milk. They should bake from forty to fifty minutes, and even ten  minutes longer, if very deep.      CARROT PIE.    Carrot pies are made like squash pies. The carrots should be boiled  very tender, skinned and sifted. Both carrot pies and squash pies  should be baked without an upper crust, in deep plates. To be baked an  hour, in quite a warm oven.      CHERRY PIE.    Cherry pies should be baked in a deep plate. Take the cherries from  the stalks, lay them in a plate, and sprinkle a little sugar, and  cinnamon, according to the sweetness of the cherries. Baked with a top  and bottom crust, three quarters of an hour.      WHORTLEBERRY PIE.    Whortleberries make a very good common pie, where there is a large  family of children. Sprinkle a little sugar and sifted cloves into  each pie. Baked in the same way, and as "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/13499"],[0,"Two Little Savages (#13)"],[1,"the best part of it seemed satisfied with the interior of the  wigwam, so that in a minute or less both boys scrambled out. Their  eyes were streaming with smoke-tears and their discomfiture was  complete.    \"'Pears to me,\" observed Sam, \"like we got them holes mixed. The dooer  should 'a 'been at the top, sence the smoke has a fancy for usin' it,  an' then _we'd_ had a chance.\"    \"The Indians make it work,\" said Yan; \"a White hunter ought to know  how.\"    \"Now's the Injun's chance,\" said Sam. \"Maybe it wants a dooer to  close, then the smoke would have to go out.\"    They tried this, and of course some of the smoke was crowded out, but  not till long after the boys were.    \"Seems like what does get out by the chinks is sucked back agin by  that there double-action flue,\" said Sam.    It was very disappointing. The romance of sitting by the fire in one's  teepee appealed to both of the boys, but the physical torture of  the smoke made it unbearable. Their dream was dispelled, and Sam  suggested, \"Maybe we'd better try a shanty.\"    \"No,\" said Yan, with his usual doggedness. \"I know it can be done,  because the Indians do it. We'll find out in time.\"    But all their efforts were in vain. The wigwam was a failure, as far  as fire was concerned. It was very small and uncomfortable, too; the  wind blew through a hundred crevices, which grew larger as the Elm  bark dried and cracked. A heavy shower caught them once, and they were  rather glad to be driven into their cheerless lodge, but the rain came  abundantly into the smoke-hole as well as through the walls, and they  found it but little protection.    [Illustration: \"The wigwam was a failure.\"]    \"Seems to me, if anything, a _leetle_ wetter in here than  outside,\" said Sam, as he led in a dash for home.    That night a heavy storm set in, and next day the boys found their  flimsy wigwam blown down--nothing but a heap of ruins.    Some time after, Raften asked at the table in characteristic stern  style, \"Bhoys, what's doin' down to yer camp? Is yer wigwam finished?\"    \"No good,\" said Sam. \"All blowed down.\"    \"How's that?\"    \"I dunno'. It smoked like everything. We couldn't stay in it.\"    \"Couldn't a-been right made,\" said Raften; then with a sudden  interest, which showed how eagerly he would have joined in this forty  years ago, he said, \"Why don't ye make a rale taypay?\"    \"Dunno' how, an' ain't got no stuff.\"    \"Wall, now, yez have been pretty good an' ain't slacked on the wurruk,  yez kin have the ould wagon kiver. Cousin Bert could tache ye how to  make it, if he wuz here. Maybe Caleb Clark knows,\" he added, with a  significant twinkle of his eye. \"Better ask him.\" Then he turned to  give orders to the hired men, who, of course, ate at the family table.    \"Da, do you care if we go to Caleb?\"    \"I don't care fwhat ye do wid him,\" was the reply.    Raften was no idle talker and Sam knew that, so as soon as \"the law  was off\" he and Yan got out the old wagon cover. It seemed like an  acre of canvas when they spread it out. Having thus taken possession,  they put it away again in the cow-house, their own domain, and Sam  said: \"I've a great notion to go right to Caleb; he sho'ly knows more  about a teepee than any one else here, which ain't sayin' much.\"    \"Who's Caleb?\"    \"Oh, he's the old Billy Goat that shot at Da oncet, just after Da beat  him at a horse trade. Let on it was a mistake: 'twas, too, as he  found out, coz Da bought up some old notes of his, got 'em cheap, and  squeezed him hard to meet them. He's had hard luck ever since.    \"He's a mortal queer old duck, that Caleb. He knows heaps about the  woods, coz he was a hunter an' trapper oncet. My! wouldn't he be down  on me if he knowed who was my Da, but he don't have to know.\"          IV    The Sanger Witch      The Sanger Witch dwelt in the bend of the creek,    And neither could read nor write;    But she knew in a day what few knew in a week,    For hers was the second sight.    \"Read?\" said she, \"I am double read;    You fools of the ink and pen    Count never the eggs, but the sticks of the nest,    See the clothes, not the souls of men.\"      --Cracked Jimmy's Ballad of Sanger.      The boys set out for Caleb's. It was up the creek away from the camp  ground. As they neared the bend they saw a small log shanty, with some  poultry and a pig at the door.    \"That's where the witch lives,\" said Sam.    \"Who--old Granny de Neuville?\"    \"Yep, and she just loves me. Oh, yes; about the same way an old hen  loves a Chicken-hawk. 'Pears to me she sets up nights to love me.\"    \"Why?\"    \"Oh, I guess it started with the pigs. No, let's see: first about the  trees. Da chopped off a lot of Elm trees that looked terrible nice  from her windy. She's awful queer about a tree. She hates to see 'em  cut down, an' that soured her same as if she owned 'em. Then there  wuz the pigs. You see, one winter she was awful hard up, an' she had  two pigs worth, maybe, $5.00 each--anyway, she said they was, an' she  ought to know, for they lived right in the shanty with her--an' she  come to Da (I guess she had tried every one else first) an' Da he  squeezed her down an' got the two pigs for $7.00. He al'ays does that.  Then he comes home an' says to Ma, 'Seems to me the old lady is  pretty hard put. 'Bout next Saturday you take two sacks of flour and  some pork an' potatoes around an' see that she is fixed up right.'  Da's al'ays doin' them things, too, on the quiet. So Ma goes with  about $15.00 worth o' truck. The old witch was kinder 'stand off.'  She didn't say much. Ma was goin' slow, not knowin' just whether to  give the stuff out an' out, or say it could be worked for next year,  or some other year, when there was two moons, or some time when the  work was all done. Well, the old witch said mighty little until the  stuff was all put in the cellar, then she grabs up a big stick an'  breaks out at Ma:    \"'Now you git out o' my house, you dhirty, sthuck-up thing. I ain't  takin' no charity from the likes o' you. That thing you call your  husband robbed me o' my pigs, an' we ain't any more'n square now, so  git out an' don't you dar set fut in my house agin'.    \"Well, she was sore on us when Da bought her pigs, but she was five  times wuss after she clinched the groceries. 'Pears like they soured  on her stummick.\"    \"What a shame, the old wretch,\" said Yan, with ready sympathy for the  Raftens.    \"No,\" replied Sam; \"she's only queer. There's lots o' folk takes her  side. But she's awful queer. She won't have a tree cut if she can help  it, an' when the flowers come in the spring she goes out in the woods  and sets down beside 'em for hours an' calls 'em 'Me beauty--me little  beauty,' an' she just loves the birds. When the boys want to rile her  they get a sling-shot an' shoot the birds in her garden an' she just  goes crazy. She pretty near starves herself every winter trying to  feed all the birds that come around. She has lots of 'em to feed right  out o' her hand. Da says they think its an old pine root, but she has  a way o' coaxin' 'em that's awful nice. There she'll stand in freezin'  weather calling them 'Me beauties'.    \"You see that little windy in the end?\" he continued, as they came  close to the witch's hut. \"Well, that's the loft, an' it's full o' all  sorts o' plants an' roots.\"    \"What for?\"    \"Oh, for medicine. She's great on hairbs.\"    \"Oh, yes, I remember now Biddy did say that her Granny was a herb  doctor.\"    \"Doctor? She ain't much of a doctor, but I bet she knows every plant  that grows in the woods, an' they're sure strong after they've been up  there for a year, with the cat sleepin' on them.\"    \"I wish I could go and see her.\"    \"Guess we can,\" was the reply.    \"Doesn't she know you?\"    \"Yes, but watch me fix her,\" drawled Sam. \"There ain't nothin' she  likes better'n a sick pusson.\"    Sam stopped now, rolled up his sleeves and examined both arms,  apparently without success, for he then loosed his suspenders, dropped  his pants, and proceeded to examine his legs. Of course, all boys  have more or less cuts and bruises in various stages of healing. Sam  selected his best, just below the knee, a scratch from a nail in the  fence. He had never given it a thought before, but now he \"reckoned  it would do.\" With a lead pencil borrowed from Yan he spread a hue  of mortification all around it, a green butternut rind added the  unpleasant yellowish-brown of human decomposition, and the result  was a frightful looking plague spot. By chewing some grass he made a  yellowish-green dye and expectorated this on the handkerchief which he  bound on the sore. He then got a stick and proceeded to limp painfully  toward the witch's abode. As they drew near, the partly open door was  slammed with ominous force. Sam, quite unabashed, looked at Yan and  winked, then knocked. The bark of a small dog answered. He knocked  again. A sound now of some one moving within, but no answer. A third  time he knocked, then a shrill voice: \"Get out o' that. Get aff my  place, you dirthy young riff-raff.\"    Sam grinned at Yan. Then drawling a little more than usual, he said:    \"It's a poor boy, Granny. The doctors can't do nothin' for him,\" which  last, at least, was quite true.    There was no reply, so Sam made bold to open the door. There sat the  old woman glowering with angry red eyes across the stove, a cat in her  lap, a pipe in her mouth, and a dog growling toward the strangers.    \"Ain't you Sam Raften?\" she asked fiercely.    \"Yes, marm. I get hurt on a nail in the fence. They say you kin git  blood-p'isinin' that way,\" said Sam, groaning a little and trying to  look interesting. The order to \"get out\" died on the witch's lips. Her  good old Irish heart warmed to the sufferer. After all, it was rather  pleasant to have the enemy thus humbly seek her aid, so she muttered:    \"Le's see it.\"    Sam was trying amid many groans to expose the disgusting mess he had  made around"]]]
