This method is only adopted when  required by the constitution or by-laws of the assembly, or when the  assembly has ordered the vote to be so taken.  The Chairman, in such  cases, appoints at least two tellers, who distribute slips of paper upon  which each member, including the Chairman,* [Should the Chairman neglect  to vote before the ballots are counted, he cannot then vote without the  permission of the assembly.] writes his vote; the votes are then  collected, counted by the tellers, and the result reported to the  Chairman, who announces    === Page 78 ============================================================    it to the assembly.  The Chairman announces the result of the vote, in  case of an election to office, in a manner similar to the following:  \"The whole number of votes cast is --; the number necessary for an  election is --; Mr. A. received --; Mr. B. --; Mr. C. --.  Mr. B. having  received the required number is elected --.\"  Where there is only one  candidate for an office, and the constitution requires the vote to be by  ballot, it is common to authorize the clerk to cast the vote of the  assembly for such and such a person; if any one objects however, it is  necessary to ballot in the usual way.  So when a motion is made to make  a vote unanimous, it fails if any one objects.  In counting the ballots  all blanks are ignored.    The assembly can by a majority vote order that the vote on any question  be taken by Yeas and Nays.* [Taking a vote by yeas and nays, which has  the effect to place on the record how each member votes, is peculiar to  this country, and while it consumes a great deal of time, is rarely  useful in ordinary societies.  By the Constitution, one-fifth of the  members present can, in either house of Congress, order a vote to be  taken by yeas and nays, and to avoid some of the resulting  inconveniences various rules and customs have been established, which  are ignored in this Manual, as according to it the yeas and nays can  only be ordered by a majority, which prevents its being made use of to  hinder business.  In representative bodies it is very useful, especially  where the proceedings are published, as it enables the people to know  how their representatives voted on important measures.  In some small  bodies a vote on a resolution must be taken by yeas and nays, upon the  demand of a single member.] In this method of voting the Chairman states  both sides of the question    === Page 79 ============================================================    at once; the clerk calls the roll and each member as his name is called  rises and answers yes or no, and the clerk notes his answer.  Upon the  completion of the roll call the clerk reads over the names of those who  answered the affirmative, and afterwards those in the negative, that  mistakes may be corrected; he then gives the number voting on each side  to the Chairman, who announces the result.  An entry must be made in the  minutes of the names of all voting in the affirmative, and also of those  in the negative.    The form of putting a question upon which the vote has been ordered to be  taken by yeas and nays, is similar to the following:  \"As many as are in  favor of the adoption of these resolutions will, when their names are  called, answer yes [or aye]--those opposed will answer no.\"  The  Chairman will then direct the clerk to call the roll.  The negative  being put at the same time as the affirmative, it is too late, after the  question is put, to renew the    === Page 80 ============================================================    debate.  After the commencement of the roll call, it is too late to ask  to be excused from voting.  The yeas and nays cannot be ordered in  committee of the whole [Sec. 32].    39. Motions Requiring More than a Majority Vote.* [Where no rule to the  contrary is adopted, a majority vote of the assembly, when a quorum [Sec.  43] is present, is sufficient for the adoption of any motion, except for  the suspension of a rule, which can only be done by general consent, or  unanimously.  Congress requires a two-thirds vote for only the motions  to suspend and to amend the Rules, to take up business out of its proper  order, and to make a special order [see note to Sec. 37].] The following  motions shall require a two-thirds vote for their adoption, as the right  of discussion, and the right to have the rules enforced, should not be  abridged by a mere majority:      An Objection to the Consideration of a Question .............. Sec. 15.    To Take up a Question out of its proper order ................ Sec. 13.    To Suspend the Rules ......................................... Sec. 18.    The Previous Question ........................................ Sec. 20.    To Close or Limit Debate ..................................... Sec. 37.    To Amend the Rules (requires previous notice also) ........... Sec. 43.    To Make a special order ...................................... Sec. 13.    === Page 81 ============================================================    Art. VII.  The Officers and the Minutes.  [Sec.Sec. 40, 41.]    40. Chairman* [In connection with this section read Sec. 44, and also Sec.  40, 41.] or President.  The presiding officer, when no special title has  been assigned him, is ordinarily called the Chairman (or in religious  assemblies more usually the Moderator); frequently the constitution of  the assembly prescribes for him a title, such as President.    His duties are generally as follows:    To open the session at the time at which the assembly is to meet, by  taking the chair and calling the members to order; to announce the  business before the assembly in the order in which it is to be acted  upon [Sec. 44]; to state and to put to vote [Sec. 38] all questions which are  regularly moved, or necessarily arise in the course of proceedings, and  to announce the result of the vote;    To restrain the members, when engaged in    === Page 82 ============================================================    debate, within the rules of order; to enforce on all occasions the  observance of order and decorum [Sec. 36] among the members, deciding all  questions of order (subject to an appeal to the assembly by any two  members, Sec. 14), and to inform the assembly when necessary, or when  referred to for the purpose, on a point of order or practice;    To authenticate, by his signature, when necessary, all the acts, orders  and proceedings of the assembly, and in general to represent and stand  for the assembly, declaring its will, and in all things obeying its  commands.    The chairman shall rise* [It is not customary for the chairman to rise  while putting questions in very small bodies, such as committees,  boards of trustees, &c.] to put a question to vote, but may state it  sitting; he shall also rise from his seat (without calling any one to  the chair), when speaking to a question of order, which he can do in  preference to other members.  In referring to himself he should always  use his official title thus:  \"The Chair decides so and so,\" not \"I  decide, &c.\"  When a member has the floor, the chairman cannot interrupt  him as long as he does not transgress    === Page 83 ============================================================    any of the rules of the assembly, excepting as provided in Sec. 2.    He is entitled to vote when the vote is by ballot,* [But this right is  lost if he does not use it before the tellers have commenced to count  the ballots.  The assembly can give leave to the chairman to vote under  such circumstances.] and in all other cases where the vote would change  the result.  Thus in a case where two-thirds vote is necessary, and his  vote thrown with the minority would prevent the adoption of the  question, he can cast his vote; so also he can vote with the minority  when it will produce a tie vote and thus cause the motion to fail.  Whenever a motion is made referring especially to the chairman, the  maker of the motion should put it to vote.    The chairman can, if it is necessary to vacate the chair, appoint a  chairman pro tem.,** [When there are Vice Presidents, then the first one  on the list that is present, is, by virtue of his office, chairman  during the absence of the President, and should always be called to the  chair when the President temporarily vacates it.] but the first  adjournment puts an end to the appointment, which the assembly can  terminate before, if it pleases, by electing another chairman.  But the  regular chairman, knowing that he will be absent from a future meeting,  cannot authorize another member to act    === Page 84 ============================================================    in his place at such meeting; the clerk [Sec. 41], or in his absence any  member, should in such case call the meeting to order, and a chairman  pro tem. be elected, who would hold office during that session [Sec. 42],  without such office was terminated by the entrance of the regular  chairman.    The chairman sometimes calls a member to the chair, and himself takes  part in the debate.  But this should rarely be done, and nothing can  justify it in a case where much feeling is shown, and there is a  liability to difficulty in preserving order.  If the chairman has even  the appearance of being a partisan, he loses much of his ability to  control those who are on the opposite side of the question.* [The  unfortunate habit many chairmen have of constantly speaking upon  questions before the assembly, even interrupting the member who has the  floor, is unjustified by either the common parliamentary law, or the  practice of Congress.  One who expects to take an active part in debate  should never accept the chair.  \"It is a general rule, in all  deliberative assemblies, that the presiding officer shall not  participate in the debate, or other proceedings, in any other capacity  than as such officer.  He is only allowed,"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/9104"],[0,"The Naval War of 1812 (#12)"],[1,"ll, it may be best  to take each ship in turn. The only ones of which the British could  write authoritatively were, of course, those which they captured.  The first one taken was the _Wasp_. James says many British were  discovered among her crew, instancing especially one sailor named  Jack Lang; now Jack Lang was born in the town of Brunswick, New  Jersey, _but had been impressed and forced to serve in the British  Navy_. The same was doubtless true of the rest of the \"many British\"  seamen of her crew; at any rate, as the only instance James mentions  (Jack Lang) was an American, he can hardly be trusted for those  whom he does not name.    Of the 95 men composing the crew of the _Nautilus_ when she was  captured, \"6 were detained and sent to England to await examination  as being suspected of being British subjects.\" [Footnote: Quoted  from letter of Commodore Rodgers of September 12, 1812 (in Naval  Archives, \"Captains' Letters,\" vol xxv, No. 43), enclosing a \"List  of American prisoners of war discharged out of custody of Lieutenant  William Miller, agent at the port of Halifax,\" in exchange for  some of the British captured by Porter. This list, by the way,  shows the crew of the _Nautilus_ (counting the six men detained  as British) to have been 95 in number, instead of 106, as stated  by James. Commodore Rodgers adds that he has detained 12 men of  the _Guerrière's_ crew as an offset to the 6 men belonging to the  _Nautilus_.] Of the other small brigs, the _Viper_, _Vixen_,  _Rattlesnake_, and _Syren_, James does not mention the composition  of the crew, and I do not know that any were claimed as British.  Of the crew of the _Argus_ \"about 10 or 12 were believed to be  British subjects; the American officers swore the crew contained  none\" (James, \"Naval Occurrences,\" p. 278). From 0 to 10 per cent  can be allowed. When the _Frolic_ was captured \"her crew consisted  of native Americans\" (_do_, p. 340). James speaks (\"History,\" p.  418) of \"a portion of the British subjects on board the _Essex_,\"  but without giving a word of proof or stating his grounds of belief.  One man was claimed as a deserter by the British, but he turned out  to be a New Yorker. There were certainly a certain number of British  aboard, but the number probably did not exceed thirty. Of the  _President's_ crew he says (\"Naval Occurrences,\" p. 448): \"In the  opinion of several British officers there were among them many  British seamen\" but Commodore Decatur, Lieutenant Gallagher, and  the other officers swore that there were none. Of the crew of the  _Chesapeake_, he says, \"about 32\" were British subjects, or about  10 per cent. One or two of these were afterward shot, and some 25,  together with a Portuguese boatswain's mate, entered into the  British service. So that of the vessels captured by the British,  the _Chesapeake_ had the largest number of British (about 10 per  cent. of her crew) on board, the others ranging from that number  down to none at all, as in the case of the _Wasp_. As these eleven  ships would probably represent a fair average, this proportion, of  0 to 10 per cent., should be taken as the proper one. James, however,  is of the opinion that those ships manned by Americans were more  apt to be captured than those manned by the braver British; which  calls for an examination of the crews of the remaining vessels.  Of the American sloop _Peacock_, James says (\"Naval Occurrences,\"  p. 348) that \"several of her men were recognized as British seamen\";  even if this were true, \"several\" could not probably mean more  than sixteen, or 10 per cent. Of the second _Wasp_ he says,  \"Captain Blakely was a native of Dublin, and, along with some  English and Scotch, did not, it may be certain, neglect to have  in his crew a great many Irish.\" Now Captain Blakely left Ireland  when he was but 16 months old, and the rest of James' statement is  avowedly mere conjecture. It was asserted positively in the American  newspapers that the _Wasp_, which sailed from Portsmouth, was  manned exclusively by New Englanders, except a small draft of men  from a Baltimore privateer, and that there was not a foreigner in  her crew. Of the _Hornet_ James states that \"some of her men were  natives of the United Kingdom\"; but he gives no authority, and the  men he refers to were in all probability those spoken of in the  journal of one of the _Hornet's_ officers, which says that \"Many  of our men (Americans) had been impressed in the British service.\"  As regards the gun-boats, James asserts that they were commanded  by \"Commodore Joshua Barney, a native of Ireland.\" This officer,  however, was born at Baltimore on July 6, 1759. As to the  _Constitution_, Brenton, as already mentioned, supposes the number  of British sailors in her crew to have been 200; James makes it  less, or about 150. Respecting this, the only definite statements  I can find in British works are the following: In the \"Naval  Chronicle,\" vol. xxix, p. 452, an officer of the _Java_ states  that most of the _Constitution's_ men were British, many being  from the _Guerrière_; which should be read in connection with  James' statement (vol. vi, p. 156) that but eight of the _Guerrière's_  crew deserted, and but two shipped on board the _Constitution_.  Moreover, as a matter of fact, these eight men were all impressed  Americans. In the \"Naval Chronicle\" it is also said that the  _Chesapeake's_ surgeon was an Irishman, formerly of the British  navy; he was born in Baltimore, and was never in the British navy  in his life. The third lieutenant \"was supposed to be an Irishman\"  (Brenton, ii, 456). The first lieutenant \"was a native of Great  Britain, we have been informed\" (James, vi, 194); he was Mr. George  Parker, born and bred in Virginia. The remaining three citations,  if true, prove nothing. \"One man had served under Mr. Kent\" of the  _Guerrière_ (James, vi, p. 153). \"One had been in the _Achille_\"  and \"one in the _Eurydice_\" (Brenton, ii, 456). These three men  were most probably American seamen who had been impressed on British  ships. From Cooper (in \"Putnam's Magazine,\" vol. I, p. 593) as well  as from several places in the _Constitution's_ log, [Footnote: See  her log-book (vol. ii, Feb. 1, 1812 to Dec. 13, 1813); especially  on July 12th, when twelve men were discharged. In some of Hull's  letters he alludes to the desire of the British part of the crew  to serve on the gun boats or in the ports; and then writes that  \"in accordance with the instructions sent him by the Secretary of  the Navy,\" he had allowed the British-born portion to leave the  ship. The log-books are in the Bureau of Navigation.] we learn  that several of the crew who were British deserters were discharged  from the _Constitution_ before she left port, as they were afraid  to serve in a war against Great Britain. That this fear was  justifiable may be seen by reading James, vol. iv, p. 483. Of the  four men taken by the _Leopard_ from the _Chesapeake_, as deserters,  one was hung and three scourged. In reality the crew of the  _Constitution_ probably did not contain a dozen British sailors;  in her last cruises she was manned almost exclusively by New  Englanders. The only remainder vessel is the _United States_,  respecting whose crew some remarkable statements have been made.  Marshall (vol. ii, p. 1019) writes that Commodore Decatur \"declared  there was not a seaman in his ship who had not served from 5 to 12  years in a British man-of-war,\" from which he concludes that they  were British themselves. It may be questioned whether Decatur ever  made such an assertion; or if he did, it is safe to assume again  that his men were long-impressed Americans. [Footnote: At the  beginning of the war there were on record in the American State  Department 6,257 cases of impressed American seamen. These could  represent but a small part of the whole, which must have amounted  to 20,000 men, or more than sufficient to man our entire navy five  times over. According to the British Admiralty Report to the House  of Commons, February 1, 1815, 2,548 impressed American seamen, who  refused to serve against their country, were imprisoned in 1812.  According to Lord Castlereagh's speech in the House, February 18,  1813, 3,300 men claiming to be American subjects were serving in  the British navy in January, 1811, and he certainly did not give  any thing like the whole number. In the American service the term  of enlistment extended for two years, and the frigate, _United  States_, referred to, had not had her crew for any very great  length of time as yet. If such a crew were selected at random  from American sailors, among them there would be, owing to the  small number serving in our own navy and the enormous number  impressed into the British navy, probably but one of the former  to two of the latter. As already mentioned the American always  left a British man-of-war as soon as he could, by desertion or  discharge; but he had no unwillingness to serve in the home navy,  where the pay was larger, and the discipline far more humane, not  to speak of motives of patriotism. Even if the ex-British  man-of-war's man kept out of service for some time, he would be  very apt to enlist when a war broke out, which his country  undertook largely to avenge his own wrongs.]    Of the _Carolina's_ crew of 70 men, five were British. This fact  was not found out till three deserted, when an investigation was  made and the two other British discharged. Captain Henly, in  reporting these facts, made no concealment of his surprise that  there should be any British at all in his crew. [Footnote: See  his letter in \"Letters of Masters' Commandant,\" 1814, I. No. 116.]    From these facts and citations we may accordingly conclude that  the proportion of British seamen serving on American ships _after  the war broke out_, varied between none, as on the _Wasp_ and  _Constitution_, to ten per cent., as on the _Chesapeake_ and"]]]
