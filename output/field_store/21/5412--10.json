The food of the Negro consists chiefly of rice, millet, &c. seasoned with  palm oil, butter, or the juices of the cocoa-nut tree mixed with herbs of  various kinds. They frequently regale themselves with other dishes,  kous-kous, and country mess, to which they sometimes add fowls, fish, and  flesh, heightened in the flavour by a variety of savory applications.    A contracted system of agriculture, conducted by their women and slaves, in  a very few days prepares the _lugars_, or cultivated fields; and the  harvest is distributed by the elders of the community, according to the  portion and wants of the society of the village, or is stored up to be  portioned out as circumstances may require.    Water is the ordinary drink of the Negroes; they, however, regale  themselves with a wine extracted from the palm tree, as before described,  which, in the luxury of indulgence, they frequently suck through a very  small kind of cane, until inebriety and stupidity absorb them in a perfect  state of apathy. They have also a very pleasant beverage, extracted from  the cocoa nut and banana tree, besides several descriptions of beer,  fermented from various roots and herbs. In the Rio Pongo, and adjacent  countries, especially in the Bashia branch of that river, the Soosees  extract a fermented and intoxicating liquor from a root growing in great  abundance, which they call _gingingey_, something similar to the sweet  potatoe in the West Indies. The distillation is commenced by forming a pit  in the earth, into which a large quantity of the root is put, and covered  with fuel, which is set on fire, and kept burning until the roots are  completely roasted: the roots are then put into paloons, and beat, exposed  afterwards in mats to the sun, by which they acquire a taste similar to  honey; and are afterwards put into hampers for distillation. This is  performed by making a funnel of sticks in a conical form, interwoven  together like basket-work; the funnel is filled with the material, and  water poured upon it; the succulent moisture therefrom passes through a  tube, and yields a liquid similar in colour to coffee, and of a violent  purgative quality. It remains in this state about twenty-four hours, and is  then incorporated with a quantity of the ashes of rice-straw, which excites  a bubbling fermentation like boiling water, after which it becomes fit for  use. In forty-eight hours it returns again to its purgative state, which  interval is employed in drinking most copiously, until overtaken by  insensibility and intoxication. The root, in its roasted state, is an  excellent medicine for colds.    Indigo and cotton grow in wild exuberance almost every where, without  culture, and the women collect such quantities as they consider requisite  for their families, which they prepare and spin upon a distaff; the thread  is woven, by an apparatus of great simplicity, into fillets, or pieces from  six to nine inches broad, which are sewed together to any width, required  for use. The indigo, in its indigenous state, and a variety of other  plants, colour these cloths, an ell of which will serve as a dress for a  Negroe of the lower class.    They manufacture cloths, of a very fanciful pattern, from various  substances. I have some from the rind of the cocoa-nut, of great beauty,  and a fine texture; also cloth, fine mats, baskets, hats, ornaments,  quivers, arrows, &c. which all prove the taste and ingenuity of the  natives.    The Negro is attached by love about his thirteenth year, and from sixteen  to twenty he seeks the object of his affection. This choice generally  continues in his confidence during life; and in proportion as he acquires  wealth, he associates with her several concubines, who generally live  cordially together. From this acquisition to his household, he is  considered rich; and it is a common expression with the Negro to say, \"such  a man be rich, he have much woman.\" When an object excites his desire, he  consults his head woman, who, without any apparent suspicion of rivalry,  gives her assent, and forwards his suit; but she is displeased when not  consulted; and it is not uncommon that the object falls a victim to her  jealousy. Celibacy is a state almost unknown in Africa; and when it does  occur, it is considered as a degradation.    The Negroe's existence is almost a gratuitous gift of nature; his wants are  supplied without laborious exertion, his desires are gratified without  restraint, his soul remains in peaceful indolence and tranquillity, and his  life glides on in voluptuous apathy and tranquil calm: he has few  solicitudes or apprehensions, and he meets the stroke of fate with perfect  resignation.    In the countries which I have visited, and, as I understand from others,  every principal village or town has its _bantaba_, or _palaver-house_,  which I have before described. In this house, or under the shade of some  venerable tree, all ranks occasionally assemble in groups, from sun-rising  to sun-set, and pass the time in chit-chat, or in conversation on public  affairs. Their subjects are inexhaustible, and their tittle-tattle is  carried on with surprising volubility, gaiety, and delight; their time thus  occupied is so seducing, that they separate with great reluctance,  sometimes passing the entire day in this, pratling, smoaking, and  diversion: night, however, terminates these amusements: They assemble in  the open air during the dry season, and under the palaver-houses in the  wet, where they form themselves into dancing companies, generally during  half the night, and not unfrequently the whole of it. Their instruments of  music are upon a very rude construction, consisting of a _tabila_, or drum,  hollowed out from a piece of wood, and covered at each end with a bull's  hide, producing a most barbarous noise, accompanied by a _baba_, or rattle,  loud shouts, palaver, songs, and violent gesticulations, forming a system  of confused uproar, unmusical, and ungraceful. Their motions are irregular,  sometimes in violent contortion, and at others voluptuous and slow. Nothing  can be done without a palaver; and at the change of every dance, he from  whom the proposition originates, makes a solemn harangue over the musical  instruments, which is generally descriptive of some warlike action or  exploit, when they again give themselves up with rapture to the pleasures  of the dance, the females in particular, whose actions and shew of  luxuriant pleasure are highly offensive to delicacy, exhibiting all the  gradations of lascivious attitude and indecency. At this period of unusual  delight, they are applauded by the men with rapturous ardour; but suddenly  a feeling of shame strikes the minds of the young creatures with a  humiliating sense of their display, and amidst these plaudits they hastily  retire to the matrons, who are spectators of the scene, and hide their  blushes in their bosoms. So strongly implanted is this ingenuous and  amiable modesty in youth, which is frequently laid aside when engaged in  the vortex of pleasure, that it is one of the highest charms of beauty; and  wretches only, degraded by debauchery and systematic vice, are capable of  insulting this sentiment. A scrupulous regard to modesty and truth will not  permit me to pursue the description of these amusements farther than  observing, that they prepare them for a profound and tranquil sleep on  their mats, from whence they arise at the dawn of day cheerful and easy.  Thus infancy and youth are singularly happy, and mothers attend their  offspring with maternal feeling and delight; they are neither disturbed by  painful commands or restraint; and it is a picture of perfect happiness to  see these children of nature in sportive groups and infantine diversion.  This happy infancy and gay youth is peculiarly calculated to organise a  vigorous manhood, and a firm old age; and, I am persuaded, that these are  the physical causes why the Negro race are so muscular in body, and  procreative of their species. In some countries innoculation is practised;  but the small pox is not so common, or dreadful in its effects, in these  countries as in Europe. The greatest term of their lives may be computed at  from sixty to seventy years, it seldom or ever happening that life is  prolonged beyond that period in this part of Africa. They retain their  vigour, and enjoy a permanent and regular state of health until the last;  and I have observed a venerable chief of advanced years having the  possession of a dozen of young handsome wives, and the father of a young  progeny, whose legitimacy was never disputed or suspected. In Europe the  last stage of man is a daily anticipation of dissolution; but in Africa,  declining years are only insensible approaches to the termination of a  journey, the event of which he considers as the end of life, unconscious of  the future, but as a fatality equally attached to all the creation.    The picture I have endeavoured to delineate may serve to convey an idea to  the mind of the moral and physical state of Africa, which, undisturbed by  ferocious barbarism, fierce hostilities, and horrid customs, convey a  blissful and happy state of being; but, alas! we must now take another  view, and contemplate these beings in the most degrading state, absorbed in  superstitious idolatry, inhuman customs, and shut out from the civil arts  of life, and the mild principles of Christianity. Their customs, their  hostilities, slavery, and the mode I have conceived requisite to  infranchise this unhappy race of men, I shall attempt to represent in the  following chapter; and happy shall I feel if the description excites the  attention and interference of more capacious minds on this subject,  interesting to so large a portion of the human race, and to the claims of"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/12545"],[0,"Traditions of the Tinguian: a Study in Philippine Folk-Lore (#13)"],[1," girl,\" said Aponitolau to the bird. \"Ala,  Aponitolau, it is best for you to follow me and I will show you the  way to the place where Asibowan lives.\" Not long after they went  and they soon arrived at the town of Gegenawan. \"Ala, Aponitolau,  I leave you now for I have showed you the way,\" said the bird. So  Aponitolau went alone to the house of Asibowan. When he reached the  ladder of her house Asibowan was looking out of the window and she  said, \"Oh, there is a rich gentleman. How are you? Where are you  going?\" Aponitolau said, \"I am going to Nagsingkawan, but I have  lost my way and I thought that this was Nagsingkawan. I saw this  house so I came to get a drink.\" \"This is not Nagsingkawan. Come up  and I will cook and we will eat.\" Aponitolau went up into the house  and the girl gave him water to drink. She cooked and then she called  him. \"I do not want to eat yet. I will rest for awhile and eat when  your husband comes,\" said Aponitolau.    Not long after, while they were talking he saw Asibowan break the fish  stick and put it in the pot and he watched to see what would become of  the stick. He saw that it became a fish. [135] She called often for  Aponitolau to come and eat and he went and he said, \"I want to wait  until your husband comes, for it is not good for us to eat first,  and it is not good for us to be eating when he arrives.\" \"Come, it  will be all right. We will eat now, and he can eat when he comes\" said  Asibowan. So he went to eat with her, for he was very hungry. He saw  that she took all the rice and fish out of the pots, and there were  only dishes for them. \"What is the matter with this woman that she  does not leave any fish for her husband?\" he said to himself. While  they were eating Asibowan told him that she did not have a husband and  Aponitolau smiled. When they finished eating, they cut betel-nut for  them to chew. \"Now be patient for we must chew betel-nut, for it is  not good for us to talk until we know each other's names.\" Asibowan  said, \"How can we chew betel-nut, for I do not chew for I am related  to Kaboniyan?\" [136] \"You must chew anyway for we cannot tell our  names unless we chew,\" said Aponitolau. When Aponitolau urged her  a long time she took the betel-nut and they chewed. \"Since you are  the lady who lives here, it is best that you tell your name first,\"  said Aponitolau. \"No it is not good for a woman to tell her name  first, so you must tell your name,\" said Asibowan. Not long after,  \"My name is Aponitolau of Kadalayapan who is the son of Langa-an and  Pagatipanan, who goes to find a pretty girl who has power like me,\"  said Aponitolau. \"My name is Asibowan of Gegenawan, who lives alone  in the field, who has no neighbors for this is my fortune,\" said  Asibowan. So Aponitolau staid with her nine months and his father  and mother were searching for him. They had many people searching for  him and they killed many animals to feed the people until all their  animals were gone. The bones which they threw away made a pile nine  times as large as the _balaua_.    Asibowan became pregnant and not long after she gave birth. \"What  shall we call our girl?\" said Aponitolau. \"We will call her  Binaklingan.\" When Asibowan bathed the baby it grew one span for  she used magical power. So the baby grew one span every time. [137]  Not long after she could walk, Aponitolau saw the pile of bones which  the searchers had thrown away when they ate, and it was nine times  larger than the _balaua_. \"The best thing for us to do, Asibowan,  is for us to go to Kadalayapan, for my father and mother are still  searching for me and the people who are searching are eating all their  animals.\" \"The best thing for you to do is to go home and find a woman  whom you should marry and then when you are married you make _Sayang_  [138] and I will come to Kadalayapan,\" said Asibowan, for it was  not good for them to be married because she had less magical power  than Aponitolau. \"If you do not wish to go, I will take our daughter  Binaklingan.\" \"Wait awhile until we have commanded that a house be  built for her to live in.\" Not long after they commanded that a house  be made for Binaklingan, and it was all of gold. It was finished in  the middle of the night and she used magic so that the golden house  went to Kadalayapan.    When Aponitolau woke up early in the early morning he heard many  roosters crowing and many people talking. \"My daughter Binaklingan,  how bad your mother is, for she sent us here to Kadalayapan without  telling us,\" said Aponitolau. His daughter was very sorry but she  played on the pan pipe. When it was morning Langa-an saw the golden  house by their house. \"Why there is a different house here. I think  Aponitolau has arrived and maybe he is in that house,\" said Langa-an  to Pagbokasan, [139] and Pagbokasan went outdoors. \"Are you here  Aponitolau? We had sought you for a long time, but did not find  you. None of our animals are left alive,\" said Pagbokasan. \"Why did  you search for me? I told Sinogyaman and Sinagayan that I was going  to fight. Did they not tell you?\" said Aponitolau. \"We thought that  you encountered our old, dangerous enemies, for you have been away  many months. Why do you have a daughter who is a young girl?\" \"Yes,  Binaklingan who is here is my daughter, and her mother Asibowan with  whom I lived for a long time did not want to come here to Kadalyapan,  for she said I must find a girl suitable for me to marry and then we  must make _balaua_ so that she will come to our town.\"    When they had been in Kadalayapan five days, they went to take a  walk in the evening of the sixth day, and they went to the spring  of Lisnayan. As soon as he arrived at the spring he used magic so  that all the pretty girls who never go outdoors felt hot and went  to the spring to bathe. [140] Not long after Aponibolinayen felt  very hot and she went to take a bath at the spring. Aponitolau saw  her taking a bath and she looked like the half of a rainbow, and  Aponitolau went to her, and Aponibolinayen saw him while she was  bathing. \"Do not wound me in more than one place so I will not have  so much to cure.\" \"If I was an enemy I would have killed you at once,\"  said Aponitolau. Soon he cut a betel-nut into two pieces. \"It is best  for us to chew betel-nut for it is bad for us to talk when we do not  know each other's names.\" Aponibolinayen did not wish to chew, but  when Aponitolau urged her she chewed and they told their names. \"My  name is Aponitolau of Kadalayapan who is the son of Pagbokasan and  Langa-an.\" \"My name is Aponibolinayen of Kaodanan who is the sister of  Aponibalagen who put me at the place close to the spring of Lisnayan,  for he does not wish anyone to see me, but you have found me.\" Not  long after, while they were talking, Aponibolinayen used magic so that  she vanished and she went among the betel-nuts on the branch of the  tree. \"Where did the girl go? I did not see her when she vanished,\"  said Aponitolau to himself. Not long after he went home with his  head bent for he was very sorrowful. When he arrived at their house,  \"Why are you bending your head Aponitolau?\" said his mother. \"What are  you bending your head for? you say, and I went to the well of Lisnayan  and talked with Aponibolinayen, but after a while she vanished and I  could not see her anymore.\" \"Did you not give her any betel-nut?\" asked  his mother. \"Yes, I did.\" \"What are you so sorry for if you gave her  betel-nut? you will find her bye and bye,\" said his mother.    On the second night he went again to Lisnayan and he used his power  so that all the young girls, were hot again so that they went to  the spring. When he looked up where there were many betel-nuts he  saw Aponibolinayen taking a bath. \"I did not see you when you left  me Aponibolinayen,\" said Aponitolau. \"Now I am going to take you  home.\" \"No, do not take me for my brother will hate me. I do not want  to go to your house.\" He took her to his town of Kadalayapan and he  sent his mother to Natpangan to tell Aponibalagen that Aponibolinayen  was in Kadalayapan. Not long after his mother Langa-an took her  skirt and her hat which was like a bird and when she arrived at the  gate of Kaodanan Sinogyaman was dipping water from the spring. \"Niece  Sinogyaman, where is the ford?\" \"Look there at the shallow place, for  it is the ford.\" She took off her belt and she spread it on the water,  and she rode on it to the other side, and then she took a bath. When  she finished bathing she stood on a high stone and the drops of  water from her body were agate beads with no holes. \"How strange,  the people of Kadalayapan are. They are very different from us,\"  said the women who were dipping water from the spring. Not long after  Langa-an put on her skirt, and when she finished she said, \"Are you  not finished dipping water, Sinogyaman? I want you to guide me to  the house of my nephew Aponibalagen, for I have forgotten the way,  for I have not been here for a long time.\" \"No, I am not through, but  I will show you the way, Aunt,\" said Sinogyaman, and she guided her.    When they reached the yard of Aponibalagen, \"Good morning,  Nephew.\" \"Good morning, Aunt,\" he said to her. \"Come up.\" Not  long after she went up the stairs. \"What are you coming here for,  Aunt?\" \"What are you coming here for? you say. I come because I wish  to see you.\" Not long after he went to get _basi_, and he had made her  drink. When they had drunk, she said, \"The other reason I came here,  Nephew Aponibalagen, is that Aponitolau sent me, for he wishes to  marry your sister.\" \"I have no sister. I do not know what my mother  did with her,\" he replied. \"We have no daughter. Aponibalagen is our  only child,\" said Ebang. While they were still talking they kept on  drinking the _basi_. When the old woman Langa-an became drunk she  told them that Aponibolinayen was in Kadalayapan, and Aponibalagen  was surprised and his heart jumped. \"I went to hide"]]]
