The effects of Mr. Clare's suavity however, so far as related to Mr.  Tyrrel, had been in a certain degree suspended by considerations of  rivalship between this gentleman and Mr. Falkland. And, now that the  influence of Mr. Clare's presence and virtues was entirely removed, Mr.  Tyrrel's temper broke out into more criminal excesses than ever. The  added gloom which Mr. Falkland's neighbourhood inspired, overflowed upon  all his connections; and the new examples of his sullenness and tyranny  which every day afforded, reflected back upon this accumulated and  portentous feud.          CHAPTER VI.      The consequences of all this speedily manifested themselves. The very  next incident in the story was in some degree decisive of the  catastrophe. Hitherto I have spoken only of preliminary matters,  seemingly unconnected with each other, though leading to that state of  mind in both parties which had such fatal effects. But all that remains  is rapid and tremendous. The death-dealing mischief advances with an  accelerated motion, appearing to defy human wisdom and strength to  obstruct its operation.    The vices of Mr. Tyrrel, in their present state of augmentation, were  peculiarly exercised upon his domestics and dependents. But the  principal sufferer was the young lady mentioned on a former occasion,  the orphan daughter of his father's sister. Miss Melville's mother had  married imprudently, or rather unfortunately, against the consent of her  relations, all of whom had agreed to withdraw their countenance from her  in consequence of that precipitate step. Her husband had turned out to  be no better than an adventurer; had spent her fortune, which in  consequence of the irreconcilableness of her family was less than he  expected, and had broken her heart. Her infant daughter was left without  any resource. In this situation the representations of the people with  whom she happened to be placed, prevailed upon Mrs. Tyrrel, the mother  of the squire, to receive her into her family. In equity, perhaps, she  was entitled to that portion of fortune which her mother had forfeited  by her imprudence, and which had gone to swell the property of the male  representative. But this idea had never entered into the conceptions of  either mother or son. Mrs. Tyrrel conceived that she performed an act of  the most exalted benevolence in admitting Miss Emily into a sort of  equivocal situation, which was neither precisely that of a domestic, nor  yet marked with the treatment that might seem due to one of the family.    She had not, however, at first been sensible of all the mortifications  that might have been expected from her condition. Mrs. Tyrrel, though  proud and imperious, was not ill-natured. The female, who lived in the  family in the capacity of housekeeper, was a person who had seen better  days, and whose disposition was extremely upright and amiable. She early  contracted a friendship for the little Emily, who was indeed for the  most part committed to her care. Emily, on her side, fully repaid the  affection of her instructress, and learned with great docility the few  accomplishments Mrs. Jakeman was able to communicate. But most of all  she imbibed her cheerful and artless temper, that extracted the  agreeable and encouraging from all events, and prompted her to  communicate her sentiments, which were never of the cynical cast,  without modification or disguise. Besides the advantages Emily derived  from Mrs. Jakeman, she was permitted to take lessons from the masters  who were employed at Tyrrel Place for the instruction of her cousin; and  indeed, as the young gentleman was most frequently indisposed to attend  to them, they would commonly have had nothing to do, had it not been for  the fortunate presence of Miss Melville. Mrs. Tyrrel therefore  encouraged the studies of Emily on that score; in addition to which she  imagined that this living exhibition of instruction might operate as an  indirect allurement to her darling Barnabas, the only species of motive  she would suffer to be presented. Force she absolutely forbade; and of  the intrinsic allurements of literature and knowledge she had no  conception.    Emily, as she grew up, displayed an uncommon degree of sensibility,  which under her circumstances would have been a source of perpetual  dissatisfaction, had it not been qualified with an extreme sweetness and  easiness of temper. She was far from being entitled to the appellation  of a beauty. Her person was _petite_ and trivial; her complexion  savoured of the _brunette_; and her face was marked with the small-pox,  sufficiently to destroy its evenness and polish, though not enough to  destroy its expression. But, though her appearance was not beautiful, it  did not fail to be in a high degree engaging. Her complexion was at once  healthful and delicate; her long dark eye-brows adapted themselves with  facility to the various conceptions of her mind; and her looks bore the  united impression of an active discernment and a good-humoured  frankness. The instruction she had received, as it was entirely of a  casual nature, exempted her from the evils of untutored ignorance, but  not from a sort of native wildness, arguing a mind incapable of guile  itself, or of suspecting it in others. She amused, without seeming  conscious of the refined sense which her observations contained; or  rather, having never been debauched with applause, she set light by her  own qualifications, and talked from the pure gaiety of a youthful heart  acting upon the stores of a just understanding, and not with any  expectation of being distinguished and admired.    The death of her aunt made very little change in her situation. This  prudent lady, who would have thought it little less than sacrilege to  have considered Miss Melville as a branch of the stock of the Tyrrels,  took no more notice of her in her will than barely putting her down for  one hundred pounds in a catalogue of legacies to her servants. She had  never been admitted into the intimacy and confidence of Mrs. Tyrrel; and  the young squire, now that she was left under his sole protection,  seemed inclined to treat her with even more liberality than his mother  had done. He had seen her grow up under his eye, and therefore, though  there were but six years difference in their ages, he felt a kind of  paternal interest in her welfare. Habit had rendered her in a manner  necessary to him, and, in every recess from the occupations of the field  and the pleasures of the table, he found himself solitary and forlorn  without the society of Miss Melville. Nearness of kindred, and Emily's  want of personal beauty, prevented him from ever looking on her with the  eyes of desire. Her accomplishments were chiefly of the customary and  superficial kind, dancing and music. Her skill in the first led him  sometimes to indulge her with a vacant corner in his carriage, when he  went to the neighbouring assembly; and, in whatever light he might  himself think proper to regard her, he would have imagined his  chambermaid, introduced by him, entitled to an undoubted place in the  most splendid circle. Her musical talents were frequently employed for  his amusement. She had the honour occasionally of playing him to sleep  after the fatigues of the chase; and, as he had some relish for  harmonious sounds, she was frequently able to soothe him by their means  from the perturbations of which his gloomy disposition was so eminently  a slave. Upon the whole, she might be considered as in some sort his  favourite. She was the mediator to whom his tenants and domestics, when  they had incurred his displeasure, were accustomed to apply; the  privileged companion, that could approach this lion with impunity in the  midst of his roarings. She spoke to him without fear; her solicitations  were always good-natured and disinterested; and when he repulsed her, he  disarmed himself of half his terrors, and was contented to smile at her  presumption.    Such had been for some years the situation of Miss Melville. Its  precariousness had been beguiled by the uncommon forbearance with which  she was treated by her savage protector. But his disposition, always  brutal, had acquired a gradual accession of ferocity since the  settlement of Mr. Falkland in his neighbourhood. He now frequently  forgot the gentleness with which he had been accustomed to treat his  good-natured cousin. Her little playful arts were not always successful  in softening his rage; and he would sometimes turn upon her  blandishments with an impatient sternness that made her tremble. The  careless ease of her disposition, however, soon effaced these  impressions, and she fell without variation into her old habits.    A circumstance occurred about this time which gave peculiar strength to  the acrimony of Mr. Tyrrel, and ultimately brought to its close the  felicity that Miss Melville, in spite of the frowns of fortune, had  hitherto enjoyed. Emily was exactly seventeen when Mr. Falkland returned  from the continent. At this age she was peculiarly susceptible of the  charms of beauty, grace, and moral excellence, when united in a person  of the other sex. She was imprudent, precisely because her own heart was  incapable of guile. She had never yet felt the sting of the poverty to  which she was condemned, and had not reflected on the insuperable  distance that custom has placed between the opulent and the poorer  classes of the community. She beheld Mr. Falkland, whenever he was  thrown in her way at any of the public meetings, with admiration; and,  without having precisely explained to herself the sentiments she  indulged, her eyes followed him through all the changes of the scene,  with"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/11344"],[0,"Scientific American Supplement, No. 415, December 15, 1883 (#13)"],[1,"yridine, oxycinchomeronic acid being a  pyridine-dicarboxylic acid, C_{5}H_{2}N(COOH)_{3}, and cinchomeronic  acid, a pyridine-dicarboxylic acid, C_{5}H_{3}N(COOH)_{2}. When  distilled with potassium hydrate, quinine yields quinoline and its  homologues. The alkaloid has been shown to be a tertiary base.    _Quinidine_ yields with chromic acid the same decomposition products as  quinine.    _Cinchonine_, C_{19}H_{22}N_{2}O, the second most important alkaloid of  these barks, when oxidized with potassium permanganate, yields cinchonic  acid, which is a quinoline-carboxylic acid, C_{9}H_{6}N(COOH),  cinchomeronic acid, which has just been stated to be a pyridine  dicarboxylic acid, and a pyridine tricarboxylic acid. When cinchonine is  treated with potassium hydrate, it is decomposed into quinoline and a  solid body, which on further treatment yields a liquid base,  C_{7}H_{9}N, which is probably lutidine. It has been found, moreover,  that both tetrahydroquinoline and dihydroquinoline, hydrogen addition  products of quinoline, are present. When cinchonine is distilled with  solid potassium hydrate, it yields pyrrol and bases of both the pyridine  and quinoline series.    _Cinchonidine_, when heated with potassium hydrate, yields quinoline  also, and with nitric acid the same products as cinchonine.    _Strychnine_ has been found to be a tertiary amine. When distilled with  potassium hydrate, quinoline is formed.    _Brucine_ is a tertiary diamine, that is, formed by substitution in a  double ammonia molecule. When distilled with potassium hydrate it yields  quinoline, lutidine, and two isomeric collidines.    The alkaloid _atropine_ has been quite thoroughly studied with results  of great interest. When heated with baryta-water or hydrochloric acid,  it takes up a molecule of water and is split into tropine,  C_{8}H_{15}NO, and tropic acid, C_{9}H_{10}O_{3}. This latter is  phenyl-oxypropionic acid. Tropine, when heated to 180 deg.C. with  concentrated hydrochloric acid, splits off a molecule of water, and  yields tropidine, C_{8}H_{13}N, a liquid base, with an odor resembling  conine. When this tropidine is heated with an excess of bromine, it  yields dibrompyridine.    _Piperine_, the alkaloid of pepper, has also been well studied. When  boiled with alcoholic potash solution, it takes up a molecule of water  and splits apart into piperic acid, C_{12}H_{10}O_{4}, and piperidine,  C_{5}H_{11}N. This latter base has been shown to be a hydrogen addition  product of pyridine, C_{5}H_{5}N. When heated with concentrated  sulphuric acid, it is oxidized to pyridine. Piperidine hydrochlorate,  also, when heated with excess of bromine to 180 deg. C., yields  dibrompyridine.    _Sinapine_, the alkaloid which exists as sulphocyanate in white mustard  seed, yields, under the same reaction as that applied to atropine and  piperine, quite different results. When boiled with baryta water,  sinapine decomposes into sinapic acid, C_{11}H_{12}O_{5}, and choline,  C_{5}H_{15}NO_{2}, the latter a well-known constituent of the bile, and  produced also in the decomposition of the lecithin of the brain and yolk  of egg.    _Cocaine_, the alkaloid of coca leaves, is decomposed by heating with  hydrochloric acid into methyl alcohol, benzoic acid, and a crystalline  base, ecgonine, C_{9}H_{15}NO_{3}.    _Caffeine_ and _theobromine_ have also quite different relations.  Caffeine, it will be remembered, is the methyl ester of theobromine, and  can be prepared from it. When caffeine is carefully oxidized with  chlorine, it yields dimethyl-alloxan and methyl-urea. Both theobromine  and caffeine are decomposed by heating to 240 deg. C. in sealed tubes with  hydrochloric acid, identical products being obtained. These products are  carbon dioxide, formic acid, ammonia, methyl-amine, and sarcosine, the  last three being of course in combination with the excess of  hydrochloric acid. The artificial preparation of theobromine and  caffeine from xanthine, and guanine also show clearly their relations.    If, having completed our survey of what has been done in the way of  decomposing the alkaloids by the different classes of reagents, we  review the field, it will be seen that with all the alkaloids mentioned,  except the last four, a more or less immediate connection with the  pyridine and quinoline bases has been indicated. The conviction  accordingly forces itself upon us that, if we want to attack the problem  of building up any of these important alkaloids artificially, we must  turn to these bases as our starting point.    As already stated, both series occur in coal-tar and the pyridine series  also more abundantly in bone-oil. Pyridine, picoline, lutidine, and  collidine, the first four members of the pyridine series, have,  moreover, all been formed synthetically, although the processes are not  such as would yield the products as cheaply as they can be gotten from  Dippel's oil. Quinoline, the first member of the higher series, had been  made synthetically by several chemists, but by expensive and involved  methods, when Skraup, in 1881, effected its synthesis from nitrobenzol  and glycerin, or still better, a mixture of nitrobenzol and aniline with  glycerin. This process allows of its being made on a commercial scale if  desirable. Shortly after, by an application of the same principle,  Dobner and Miller effected the synthesis of lepidine, the second member  of the quinoline series.    At the same time that this general agreement to consider these bases as  the starting point in the endeavor to effect the synthesis of the  natural alkaloids had been arrived at by chemists, it was thought well  to look into the question whether these bases and their immediate  derivatives had any therapeutic value of their own.    Piperidine, the decomposition product of piperine, which we have shown  may be considered to be hexahydropyridine, was examined by Dr.  Kronecker, of Berlin, at the request of Prof. Hofmann, and was found to  have an action upon animals in many respects resembling that of conine.  Prof. Filehne, of Erlangen, who has studied a large number of these  pyridine and quinoline derivatives, found, moreover, that the  hydrochlorate of ethyl-piperidine had a physiological action quite  analogous to that of conine.    The physiological action of quinoline itself has been studied quite  extensively by Donath and others, and it was found that several of its  salts were quite valuable febrifuges, acting very like quinine, and  capable in cases of being used as a substitute for it. In general, the  hydrogen addition products were found to be more active than the simple  base, an observation entirely in accord with the theory formed by  Wischnegradsky, and by Konigs, as the result of the study of the  decomposition products of the alkaloids, viz., the alkaloids are in  general hydrogen addition products of pyridine and quinoline, or of the  two bases combined. Thus Prof. Filehne found that hydrochlorate of  tetrahydroquinoline was much more energetic in its action than  quinoline, but could not be used on account of a too powerful local  effect. The hydrochlorate of dimethyl-tetrahydroquinoline, which was  distinguished by its strong bitter taste, much resembling that of  quinine, had an effect like that of curare poison. The most decided  febrifuge action, however was found by Prof. Filehne to reside in the  hydrochlorate of oxyhydro-methyl-quinoline, introduced to public notice  by Prof. O. Fischer under the name of \"Kairin,\" and in the acid sulphate  of tetrahydro-methylquinoline, introduced under the name of \"Kairolin.\"  These compounds had a very surprising febrifuge action, without any  unpleasant after effects or local disturbances.    The most active workers in the field of synthetic formation of the  alkaloids have been Wischnegradsky, of St. Petersburg--who,  unfortunately for science, died at an untimely age in 1880--Koenigs and  Fischer, of Munich, and Ladenburg, of Kiel. The study of the  decomposition products of the cinchona alkaloids especially points quite  distinctly to the probable existence in quinine of a hydrogen addition  product of pyridine, in combination with a methyl-quinoline group. The  many experiments that are now being made to test this and other  questions that suggest themselves, will not long leave us in the dark.  Whether a practical commercial synthesis of quinine will follow is  another matter, but it is within the bounds of possibility, or perhaps  even of probability.    It must not be supposed that no syntheses of alkaloids have been  effected as yet. By heating butyl-aldehyde with alcoholic ammonia is  formed _paraconine_, an alkaloid isomeric with the natural conine, but  differing in physiological action. By the action of sodium upon pyridine  is produced a compound C_{10}H_{8}N_{2}, known as dipyridyl, and this,  under the influence of nascent hydrogen, takes up six atoms and becomes  _isonicotine_ C_{10}H_{14}N_{2}, a physiologically active alkaloid,  isomeric with the true nicotine. The formation of a series of alkaloids  under the name of _codeines_, by the substitution of other organic  radicals instead of methyl in the codeine reaction, has already been  alluded to. _Atropine_ can be formed by uniting tropine and tropic acid,  the two decomposition products already noted. The latter of these  products is already shown to be capable of synthetical formation, and  the other will no doubt be formed in the same way. The artificial  atropine is identical with the natural alkaloid. Ladenburg has also  formed a series of artificial alkaloids, called _tropeines_, by uniting  the base tropine with different organic acids, as in the case of the  compound of mandelic acid and tropine, known as _homatropine_, an  alkaloid of action similar to atropine, but possessing some decided  advantages in its use. _Piperine_ has also been made by the uniting of  piperidine and piperic acid, and, as piperidine"]]]
