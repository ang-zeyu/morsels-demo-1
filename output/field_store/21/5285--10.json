His father was a goldsmith in the city of Bourges; but so reduced in  circumstances towards the latter years of his life, that he was unable  to pay the necessary fees to procure his son's admission into the guild.  Young Jacques became, however, a workman in the Royal Mint of Bourges,  in 1428, and behaved himself so well, and showed so much knowledge of  metallurgy, that he attained rapid promotion in that establishment. He  had also the good fortune to make the acquaintance of the fair Agnes  Sorel, by whom he was patronized and much esteemed. Jacques had now  three things in his favour--ability, perseverance, and the countenance  of the King's mistress. Many a man succeeds with but one of these to  help him forward: and it would have been strange indeed, if Jacques  Coeur, who had them all, should have languished in obscurity. While  still a young man he was made Master of the Mint, in which he had been  a journeyman, and installed at the same time into the vacant office of  Grand Treasurer of the royal household.    He possessed an extensive knowledge of finance, and turned it  wonderfully to his own advantage as soon as he became intrusted with  extensive funds. He speculated in articles of the first necessity, and  made himself very unpopular by buying up grain, honey, wines, and other  produce, till there was a scarcity, when he sold it again at enormous  profit. Strong in the royal favour, he did not hesitate to oppress the  poor by continual acts of forestalling and monopoly. As there is no  enemy so bitter as the estranged friend, so of all the tyrants and  tramplers upon the poor, there is none so fierce and reckless as the  upstart that sprang from their ranks. The offensive pride of Jacques  Coeur to his inferiors was the theme of indignant reproach in his own  city, and his cringing humility to those above him was as much an object  of contempt to the aristocrats into whose society he thrust himself. But  Jacques did not care for the former, and to the latter he was blind. He  continued his career till he became the richest man in France, and so  useful to the King that no important enterprise was set on foot until he  had been consulted. He was sent in 1446 on an embassy to Genoa, and  in the following year to Pope Nicholas V. In both these missions he  acquitted himself to the satisfaction of his sovereign, and was rewarded  with a lucrative appointment, in addition to those which he already  held.    In the year 1449, the English in Normandy, deprived of their great  general, the Duke of Bedford, broke the truce with the French King, and  took possession of a small town belonging to the Duke of Brittany. This  was the signal for the recommencemerit of a war, in which the French  regained possession of nearly the whole province. The money for this war  was advanced, for the most part, by Jacques Coeur. When Rouen yielded  to the French, and Charles made his triumphal entry into that city,  accompanied by Dunois and his most famous generals, Jacques was among  the most brilliant of his cortege. His chariot and horses vied with  those of the King in the magnificence of their trappings; and his  enemies said of him that he publicly boasted that he alone had driven  out the English, and that the valour of the troops would would have been  nothing without his gold.    Dunois appears, also, to have been partly of the same opinion. Without  disparaging the courage of the army, he acknowledged the utility of  the able financier, by whose means they had been fed and paid, and  constantly afforded him his powerful protection.    When peace returned, Jacques again devoted himself to commerce, and  fitted up several galleys to trade with the Genoese. He also bought  large estates in various parts of France; the chief of which were the  baronies of St. Fargeau, Meneton, Salone, Maubranche, Meaune, St. Gerant  de Vaux, and St. Aon de Boissy; the earldoms or counties of La Palisse,  Champignelle, Beaumont, and Villeneuve la Genet, and the marquisate  of Toucy. He also procured for his son, Jean Coeur, who had chosen the  Church for his profession, a post no less distinguished than that of  Archbishop of Bourges.    Everybody said that so much wealth could not have been honestly  acquired; and both rich and poor longed for the day that should humble  the pride of the man, whom the one class regarded as an upstart and the  other as an oppressor. Jacques was somewhat alarmed at the rumours that  were afloat respecting him, and of dark hints that he had debased the  coin of the realm and forged the King's seal to an important document,  by which he had defrauded the state of very considerable sums. To  silence these rumours, he invited many alchymists from foreign countries  to reside with him, and circulated a counter-rumour, that he had  discovered the secret of the philosopher's stone. He also built a  magnificent house in his native city, over the entrance of which  he caused to be sculptured the emblems of that science. Some time  afterwards, he built another, no less splendid, at Montpellier, which  he inscribed in a similar manner. He also wrote a treatise upon the  hermetic philosophy, in which he pretended that he knew the secret of  transmuting metals.    But all these attempts to disguise his numerous acts of peculation  proved unavailing; and he was arrested in 1452, and brought to trial on  several charges. Upon one only, which the malice of his enemies invented  to ruin him, was he acquitted; which was, that he had been accessory  to the death, by poison, of his kind patroness, Agnes Sorel. Upon the  others, he was found guilty; and sentenced to be banished the kingdom,  and to pay the enormous fine of four hundred thousand crowns. It was  proved that he had forged the King's seal; that, in his capacity of  Master of the Mint of Bourges, he had debased, to a very great extent,  the gold and silver coin of the realm; and that he had not hesitated  to supply the Turks with arms and money to enable them to carry on war  against their Christian neighbours, for which service he had received  the most munificent recompences. Charles VII. was deeply grieved at  his condemnation, and believed to the last that he was innocent. By his  means the fine was reduced within a sum which Jacques Coeur could pay.  After remaining for some time in prison, he was liberated, and left  France with a large sum of money, part of which, it was alleged, was  secretly paid him by Charles out of the produce of his confiscated  estates. He retired to Cyprus, where he died about 1460, the richest and  most conspicuous personage of the island.    The writers upon alchymy all claim Jacques Coeur as a member of  their fraternity, and treat as false and libellous the more rational  explanation of his wealth which the records of his trial afford. Pierre  Borel, in his \"Antiquites Gauloises,\" maintains the opinion that Jacques  was an honest man, and that he made his gold out of lead and copper by  means of the philosopher's stone. The alchymic adepts in general were  of the same opinion; but they found it difficult to persuade even his  contemporaries of the fact. Posterity is still less likely to believe  it.      INFERIOR ADEPTS OF THE FOURTEENTH AND FIFTEENTH CENTURIES.    Many other pretenders to the secrets of the philosopher's stone  appeared in every country in Europe, during the fourteenth and fifteenth  centuries. The possibility of transmutation was so generally admitted,  that every chemist was more or less an alchymist. Germany, Holland,  Italy, Spain, Poland, France, and England produced thousands of obscure  adepts, who supported themselves, in the pursuit of their chimera, by  the more profitable resources of astrology and divination. The monarchs  of Europe were no less persuaded than their subjects of the possibility  of discovering the philosopher's stone. Henry VI. and Edward IV.  of England encouraged alchymy. In Germany, the Emperors Maximilian,  Rodolph, and Frederic II. devoted much of their attention to it; and  every inferior potentate within their dominions imitated their example.  It was a common practice in Germany, among the nobles and petty  sovereigns, to invite an alchymist to take up his residence among them,  that they might confine him in a dungeon till he made gold enough to  pay millions for his ransom. Many poor wretches suffered perpetual  imprisonment in consequence. A similar fate appears to have been  intended by Edward II. for Raymond Lulli, who, upon the pretence that he  was thereby honoured, was accommodated with apartments in the Tower of  London. He found out in time the trick that was about to be played him,  and managed to make his escape, some of his biographers say, by jumping  into the Thames, and swimming to a vessel that lay waiting to receive him.  In the sixteenth century, the same system was pursued, as will be shown  more fully in the life of Seton the Cosmopolite, in the succeeding  chapter.    The following is a catalogue of the chief authors upon alchymy, who  flourished during this epoch, and whose lives and adventures are either  unknown or are unworthy of more detailed notice. John Dowston, an  Englishman, lived in 1315, and wrote two treatises on the philosopher's  stone. Richard, or, as some call him, Robert, also an Englishman, lived  in 1330, and wrote a work entitled \"Correctorium Alchymiae,\" which was  much esteemed till the time of Paracelsus. In the same year lived Peter  of Lombardy, who wrote what he called a \"Complete Treatise upon the  Hermetic Science,\" an abridgement of which was afterwards published by  Lacini, a monk of Calabria. In 1330 the most famous alchymist of Paris  was one Odomare, whose work \"De Practica Magistri\" was, for a long time,  a hand-book among the brethren of the science. John de Rupecissa,  a French monk of the order of St. Francis, flourished in 1357,  and pretended to be a"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/8855"],[0,"Astral Worship (#12)"],[1,"belief that Christ was but one of the prophets.    The cultured adherents to the established form of worship, becoming  alarmed at the growing power and influence of the Christians and at the  prospect of such an ignorant and vicious rabble obtaining control of  the government, regardless of their pledge to keep the Gnosis secret,  publicly announced that the Gods were mythical and the scriptures  allegorical, and engaged in a heated controversy with the Christians  upon the subjects. The character of their discussions is well, although  supposititiously, expressed by Gerald Massey, in his work entitled,  \"The Historical Jesus and the Mythical Christ;\" page 179, American  edition, where he makes the Gnostics say to the Christians, \"You poor  ignorant idiots; you have mistaken the mysteries of old for modern  history, and accepted literally all that was only meant mystically.\" To  which the Christians responded, \"You spawn of Satan, you are making the  mystery by converting our accomplished facts into your miserable  fables; you are dissipating and dispersing into thin air our only bit  of solid foothold in the world, stained with the red drops of Calvary.  You are giving a satanic interpretation of the word of revelation and  falsifying the oracles of God. You are converting the solid facts of  our history into your newfangled allegories;\" to which the Gnostics  replied, \"Nay, it is you who have taken the allegories of Mythology for  historical facts.\"    But it was impossible to stem the rising tide; the lessons which the  priesthood had taught the ignorant masses had been too well learned.  They were sure that their scriptures were historical; that Jesus Christ  was truly the incarnate saviour who had died and rose again for the  salvation of the elect, and that being the elect it would be  pre-eminently just and proper that the old Pagan form of worship should  be abrogated and theirs recognized as the state religion. Thus the  conflict raged until the year 381, when, under the reign of the Emperor  Theodosius the Great, this demand having been formally made, and the  Senate, fearing the tumult a refusal would excite, with a show of fair  dealing ordered the presentation, before that body, of the respective  merits of the two forms of worship. In that memorable discussion, which  lasted a whole week, Symmachus, a senator, advocated the old system,  and Ambrose, Bishop of Milan, the new, which resulting, as a foregone  conclusion, in the triumph of Christianity, a decree to that effect was  promulgated.    Then the long deferred opportunity having arrived, the vengeful  bishops, hounding on a no less vengeful laity, ruthlessly murdered the  priests of the old religion, and, appropriating its emoluments to their  own use, they seized upon its temples, and demolishing some, converted  others into churches. With iconoclastic hands they destroyed some of  the statues representing the ancient divinities, or after mutilation  exposed others in public places to the derision of the populace.  Subjecting the adherents to the older form of worship, whom they  designated as infidels, to the most diabolical indignities and  persecutions, they destroyed their works of art, burned their  libraries, suppressed their schools of learning, and either killed or  exiled their professors. Among the atrocious acts perpetrated by these  fiends in human shape none was more barbarous than the one committed in  Alexandria, in the year 415, when Hypatia, the beautiful and  accomplished daughter of Theon, who had succeeded her father as  professor of mathematics and philosophy in the Alexandrian University,  while on her way to deliver a lecture, was, by order of Bishop Cyril,  dragged from her chariot and murdered in a most revolting manner.    One of the successors of Theodosius justified himself in decreeing the  spoliation of the old religion upon the grounds that \"It was unbecoming  a Christian government to supply the infidels with the means of  persevering in their errors.\" Another one of the Emperors, more zealous  than his predecessors, decreed the death penalty against all persons  discovered practicing any of the rites and ceremonies of the old  religion. Thus the onslaught of Christian savagery obliterated the  civilization of Greece and Rome, and inaugurated that long reign of  intellectual night known as the Dark Ages, which, materially aiding in  effecting the decline and fall of the Roman Empire, made it possible to  erect upon its ruins that Italian Oligarchy, which, since then, has  ruled the greater part of Christendom.    The dogmatic element of the ancient astrolatry, as incorporated into  the Christian creed, underwent no material change until the  inauguration of the dark ages, when the bishops of the several  churches, in the delirium of metaphysical speculation, concocted the  previously unheard of doctrine of pre-existence of spirit, in  conformity to which God was declared to be purely a spiritual deity,  who, existing before matter, created the universe of nothing. Being the  sole custodians of the scriptures; and changing the six periods of a  thousand years each to the six days of creation, they altered Gen. i,  1, to read, \"In the beginning God created the heaven and the earth,\"  which in the original read: \"In the beginning, when the Gods (Elohim or  Alehim) had made (shaped or formed) this heaven and this earth.\" These  radical changes necessitating others, they made two distinct and  independent beings of the principles of Good and Evil personified in  the God Sol; the former they embodied in Jesus the Christ and the  latter in the Christian Devil, thus supplanting old Pluto; the  presiding genius of the under world.    Rejecting the ancient doctrines relative to the soul, and teaching  that, having proceeded from a purely spiritual deity, it would exist  eternally as an independent spiritual entity, they substituted for the  ancient system of limited rewards and punishments the one inculcating  their endless duration. These changes in the creed, which were  confirmed at the general council of Constantinople, in the year 553,  necessitating further alterations of the scriptures, the righteous were  promised \"eternal life\" in the Paradise of God beyond the stars; and,  While consigning great sinners to \"everlasting punishment\" in the  Tartarian fires of the under world, the less venial were to expiate  their crimes in the same old Purgatory. Thus, having invented an  endless heaven and an endless hell for purely spiritual souls, and  neglecting to expunge the doctrines of the resurrection of the body,  the setting up of the kingdom of heaven upon a reorganized earth and  other materialistic teachings of the ancient religion, they made of the  creed and scriptures such a conglomeration of \"things new and old\"  that, without the Astrological key, it would be impossible to determine  what they originally taught.    At the Reformation in the 16th century Luther and his coadjutors, while  projecting into the Protestant creed all the cardinal tenets of  Catholicism, excepting that of Purgatory, made no change in the  verbiage of the scriptures. Thus retaining the awful doctrine of  endless hell, the reformers constructed a creed which they intended for  the government of Protestants for all time; but, doing what had never  been done before in the history of the world, they gave the scriptures  to the laity, and, whether or not they secured the right of private  judgment or individual interpretation, it has been taken all the same;  and thus opening the door to investigation, it must ultimately result  not only in the abrogation of hell, but in the relegation to the limbo  of oblivion of the whole dogmatic element of religion.    As a fitting conclusion to this article, we again direct the attention  of our readers to the subject of the primary source of religious  dogmas. Prior to the establishment of Christianity as the state  religion of the Roman Empire, the philosophers who wrote against it  invariably made the charge that its theology was derived from the  ancient Paganism. After its establishment as the state religion of the  Empire, the hierarchy of the church, knowing that this charge was  unanswerable, instigated the Emperor Theodosius I. to promulgate an  edict decreeing the destruction of all books antagonistic to  Christianity. This edict, directed more particularly against the  writings of Celsus, was carried out so effectually that we know nothing  of what he wrote, only as quoted by Origen, the distinguished church  father of the third century, who attempted to answer in eight books  what Celsus had written in one, entitled \"The True Discourse.\" In one  of his quotations from Celsus' work he makes that philosopher say \"that  the Christian religion contains nothing but what Christians held in  common with heathens, nothing that was new or truly great.\" See  Bellamy's translation, chapter 4. During the earlier centuries the  Christians were divided into numerous sects, entertaining very  divergent views, and each faction, holding all others to be heretical,  charged them with having derived their doctrines from the Pagan  religion. Upon this subject we find that Epiphanius, a celebrated  church father of the 4th century, freely admits that all that differed  from his own were derived from the heathen mythology. Such was the  position of all orthodox writers during the Middle Ages, and since the  Reformation the Protestant clergy have uniformly made the same charge  against the Catholic; a few quotations from their writings we present  for the edification of our readers.    Jean Daille, a French Protestant minister of the 17th century, in his  treatise entitled La Religion Catholique Romaine Institute par Nama  Pompile, demonstrates that \"the Papists took their idolatrous worship  of images, as well as all their ceremonies, from the old heathen  religion.\" Bishop Stillingfleet of the English "]]]
