Since his arrival, the poor Indian  population of the town of Amhala Cantonment has been living under a  regime of horror and tyranny.\" The correspondent adds: \"I use both these  words deliberately for conveying precisely what they mean.\" I cull a few  passage from this illuminating letter to illustrate the meaning of  horror and tyranny. \"In private complaints he never takes the statement  of the complainant. It is taken down by the reader when the court rises  and got signed by the magistrate the following day. Whether the report  received (upon such complaints) is favourable to the complainant or  unfavourable to him, it is never ready by the magistrate, and  complaints are dismissed without proper trial. This is the fate of  private complaints. Now as regards police chellans. Pleaders for the  accused are not allowed to interview under trial prisoners in police  custody. They are not allowed to cross-examine prosecution witnesses....  Prosecution witnesses are examined with leading questions.... Thus a  whole prosecution story is put into the mouth of police, witnesses for  the defence though called in are not allowed to be examined by the  defence counsel.... The accused is silenced if he picks up courage to  say anything in defence.... Any Cantonment servant can write down the  name of any citizen of the Cantonment on a chit of paper and ask him to  appear the next day in court. This is a summons.... If any one does not  appear in court who is thus ordered, criminal warrants of arrest are  issued against him.\" There is much more of this style in the letter  which is worth producing, but I have given enough to illustrate the  writer's meaning. Let me turn for a while to this official's record  during Martial Law. He is the official who tried people in batches and  convicted them after a farcical trial. Witnesses have deposed to his  having assembled people, having asked them to give false evidence,  having removed women's veils, called them 'flies, bitches, she-asses'  and having spat upon them. He it was who subjected the innocent pleaders  of Shokhupura indescribable persecution. Mr. Andrews personally  investigated complaints against this official and came to the conclusion  that no official had behaved worse than Mr. Smith. He gathered the  people of Shokhupura, humiliated them in a variety of ways, called them  'suvarlog,' 'gandi mukkhi.' His evidence before the Hunter Commission  betrays his total disregard for truth and this is the officer who, if  the correspondent in question has given correct facts, has been  promoted. The question however is why, he is at all in Government  service and why he has not been tried for assaulting and abusing  innocent men and women.    I notice a desire for the impeachment of General Dyer and Sir Michael  O'Dwyer. I will not stop to examine whether the course is feasible. I  was sorry to find Mr. Shastriar joining this cry for the prosecution of  General Dyer. If the English people will willingly do so, I would  welcome such prosecution as a sign of their strong disapproval of the  Jallianwalla Bagh atrocity, but I would certainly not spend a single  farthing in a vain pursuit after the conviction of this man. Surely the  public has received sufficient experience of the English mind.  Practically the whole English Press has joined the conspiracy to screen  these offenders against humanity. I would not be party to make heroes of  them by joining the cry for prosecution private or public. If I can only  persuade India to insist upon their complete dismissal, I should be  satisfied. But more than the dismissal, of Sir Michael O'Dwyer and  General Dyer, is necessary the peremptory dismissal, if not a trial, of  Colonel O'Brien, Mr. Bosworth Smith, Rai Shri Ram and others mentioned  in the Congress Sub-Committee's Report. Bad as General Dyer is I  consider Mr. Smith to be infinitely worse and his crimes to be far more  serious than the massacre of Jallianwalla Bugh. General Dyer sincerely  believed that it was a soldierly act to terrorise people by shooting  them. But Mr. Smith was wantonly cruel, vulgar and debased. If all the  facts that have been deposed to against him are true, there is not a  spark of humanity about him. Unlike General Dyer he lacks the courage to  confirm what he has done and he wriggles when challenged. This officer  remains free to inflict himself upon people who have done no wrong to  him, and who is permitted to disgrace the rule he represents for the  time being.    What is the Punjab doing? Is it not the duty of the Punjabis not to rest  until they have secured the dismissal of Mr. Smith and the like? The  Punjab leaders have been discharged in vain if they will not utilise the  liberty they have received, in order to purge the administration of  Messrs. Bosworth Smith and Company. I am sure that if they will only  begin a determined agitation they will have the whole India by their  side. I venture to suggest to them that the best way to qualify for  sending General Dyer to the gallows is to perform the easier and the  more urgent duty of arresting the mischief still continued by the  officials against whom they have assisted in collecting  overwhelming evidence.      GENERAL DYER    The Army Council has found General Dyer guilty of error of judgment and  advised that he should not receive any office under the Crown. Mr.  Montagu has been unsparing in his criticism of General Dyer's conduct.  And yet somehow or other I cannot help feeling that General Dyer is by  no means the worst offender. His brutality is unmistakable. His abject  and unsoldier-like cowardice is apparent in every line of his amazing  defence before the Army Council. He has called an unarmed crowd of men  and children--mostly holiday-makers--'a rebel army.' He believes himself  to be the saviour of the Punjab in that he was able to shoot down like  rabbits men who were penned in an inclosure. Such a man is unworthy of  being considered a soldier. There was no bravery in his action. He ran  no risk. He shot without the slightest opposition and without warning.  This is not an 'error of judgement.' It is paralysis of it in the face  of fancied danger. It is proof of criminal incapacity and  heartlessness. But the fury that has been spent upon General Dyer is, I  am sure, largely misdirected. No doubt the shooting was 'frightful,' the  loss of innocent life deplorable. But the slow torture, degradation and  emasculation that followed was much worse, more calculated, malicious  and soul-killing, and the actors who performed the deeds deserve greater  condemnation that General Dyer for the Jallianwalla Bagh massacre. The  latter merely destroyed a few bodies but the others tried to kill the  soul of a nation. Who ever talks of Col. Frank Johnson who was by far  the worst offender? He terrorised guiltless Lahore, and by his merciless  orders set the tone to the whole of the Martial Law officers. But what I  am concerned with is not even Col. Johnson. The first business of the  people of the Punjab and of India is to rid the service of Col O'Brien,  Mr. Bosworth Smith, Rai Shri Ram and Mr. Malik Khan. They are still  retained in the service. Their guilt is as much proved as that of  General Dyer. We shall have failed in our duty if the condemnation  pronounced upon General Dyer produces a sense of satisfaction and the  obvious duty of purging the administration in the Punjab is neglected.  That task will not be performed by platform rhetoric or resolutions  merely. Stern action is required on out part if we are to make any  headway with ourselves and make any impression upon the officials that  they are not to consider themselves as masters of the people but as  their trusties and servants who cannot hold office if they misbehave  themselves and prove unworthy of the trust reposed in them.      THE PUNJAB SENTENCES    The commissioners appointed by the Congress Punjab Sub Committee have in  their report accused His Excellency the Viceroy of criminal want of  imagination. His Excellency's refusal to commute two death sentences out  of five is a fine illustration of the accusation. The rejection of the  appeal by the Privy Council no more proves the guilt of the condemned  than their innocence would have been proved by quashing the proceedings  before the Martial Law Tribunal. Moreover, these cases clearly come  under the Royal Proclamation in accordance with its interpretation by  the Punjab Government. The murders in Amritsar were not due to any  private quarrel between the murderers and their victims. The offence  grave, though it was, was purely political and committed under  excitement. More than full reparation has been taken for the murders and  arson. In the circumstances commonsense dictates reduction of the death  sentences. The popular belief favours the view that the condemned men  are innocent and have not had a fair trial. The execution has been so  long delayed that hanging at this stage would give a rude shock to  Indian society. Any Viceroy with imagination would have at once  announced commutation of the death sentences--not so Lord Chelmsford. In  his estimation, evidently, the demands of justice will not be satisfied  if at least some of the condemned men are not hanged. Public feeling  with him counts for nothing. We shall still hope that, either the  Viceroy or Mr. Montagu will commute the death sentences.    But if the Government will grievously err, if they carry out the  sentences, the people will equally err if they give way to anger or  grief over the hanging if it has unfortunately to take plane. Before we  become a nation possessing an effective voice in the councils of  nations, we must be prepared to contemplate with equanimity, not a  thousand murders of innocent men and women but many thousands before we"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/10376"],[0,"American Indian Stories (#13)"],[1," Now the maddened creature pitches, with flying heels. The line of men  and women sways outward. Now it is back in place, safe from the kicking,  snorting thing.    \"The pony is fierce, with its large black eyes bulging out of their  sockets. With humped back and nose to the ground, it leaps into the air.  I shut my eyes. I can not see him fall.    \"A loud shout goes up from the hoarse throats of men and women. I look.  So! The wild horse is conquered. My lover dismounts at the doorway of  the centre wigwam. The pony, wet with sweat and shaking with exhaustion,  stands like a guilty dog at his master's side. Here at the entranceway  of the tepee sit the bereaved father, mother, and sister. The old  warrior father rises. Stepping forward two long strides, he grasps the  hand of the murderer of his only son. Holding it so the people can see,  he cries, with compassionate voice, 'My son!' A murmur of surprise  sweeps like a puff of sudden wind along the lines.    \"The mother, with swollen eyes, with her hair cut square with her  shoulders, now rises. Hurrying to the young man, she takes his right  hand. 'My son!' she greets him. But on the second word her voice shook,  and she turned away in sobs.    \"The young people rivet their eyes upon the young woman. She does not  stir. With bowed head, she sits motionless. The old warrior speaks to  her. 'Shake hands with the young brave, my little daughter. He was your  brother's friend for many years. Now he must be both friend and brother  to you,'    \"Hereupon the girl rises. Slowly reaching out her slender hand, she  cries, with twitching lips, 'My brother!' The trial ends.\"    \"Grandmother!\" exploded the girl on the bed of sweet-grass. \"Is this  true?\"    \"Tosh!\" answered the grandmother, with a warmth in her voice. \"It is all  true. During the fifteen winters of our wedded life many ponies passed  from our hands, but this little winner, Ohiyesa, was a constant member  of our family. At length, on that sad day your grandfather died, Ohiyesa  was killed at the grave.\"    Though the various groups of stars which move across the sky, marking  the passing of time, told how the night was in its zenith, the old  Dakota woman ventured an explanation of the burial ceremony.    \"My grandchild, I have scarce ever breathed the sacred knowledge in my  heart. Tonight I must tell you one of them. Surely you are old enough  to understand.    \"Our wise medicine-man said I did well to hasten Ohiyesa after his  master. Perchance on the journey along the ghostpath your grandfather  will weary, and in his heart wish for his pony. The creature, already  bound on the spirit-trail, will be drawn by that subtle wish. Together  master and beast will enter the next camp-ground.\"    The woman ceased her talking. But only the deep breathing of the girl  broke the quiet, for now the night wind had lulled itself to sleep.    \"Hinnu! hinnu! Asleep! I have been talking in the dark, unheard. I did  wish the girl would plant in her heart this sacred tale,\" muttered she,  in a querulous voice.    Nestling into her bed of sweet-scented grass, she dozed away into  another dream. Still the guardian star in the night sky beamed  compassionately down upon the little tepee on the plain.          A WARRIOR'S DAUGHTER      In the afternoon shadow of a large tepee, with red-painted smoke lapels,  sat a warrior father with crossed shins. His head was so poised that his  eye swept easily the vast level land to the eastern horizon line.    He was the chieftain's bravest warrior. He had won by heroic deeds the  privilege of staking his wigwam within the great circle of tepees.    He was also one of the most generous gift givers to the toothless old  people. For this he was entitled to the red-painted smoke lapels on his  cone-shaped dwelling. He was proud of his honors. He never wearied of  rehearsing nightly his own brave deeds. Though by wigwam fires he prated  much of his high rank and widespread fame, his great joy was a wee  black-eyed daughter of eight sturdy winters. Thus as he sat upon the  soft grass, with his wife at his side, bent over her bead work, he was  singing a dance song, and beat lightly the rhythm with his slender  hands.    His shrewd eyes softened with pleasure as he watched the easy movements  of the small body dancing on the green before him.    Tusee is taking her first dancing lesson. Her tightly-braided hair  curves over both brown ears like a pair of crooked little horns which  glisten in the summer sun.    With her snugly moccasined feet close together, and a wee hand at her  belt to stay the long string of beads which hang from her bare neck, she  bends her knees gently to the rhythm of her father's voice.    Now she ventures upon the earnest movement, slightly upward and  sidewise, in a circle. At length the song drops into a closing cadence,  and the little woman, clad in beaded deerskin, sits down beside the  elder one. Like her mother, she sits upon her feet. In a brief moment  the warrior repeats the last refrain. Again Tusee springs to her feet  and dances to the swing of the few final measures.    Just as the dance was finished, an elderly man, with short, thick hair  loose about his square shoulders, rode into their presence from the  rear, and leaped lightly from his pony's back. Dropping the rawhide rein  to the ground, he tossed himself lazily on the grass. \"Hunhe, you have  returned soon,\" said the warrior, while extending a hand to his little  daughter.    Quickly the child ran to her father's side and cuddled close to him,  while he tenderly placed a strong arm about her. Both father and child,  eyeing the figure on the grass, waited to hear the man's report.    \"It is true,\" began the man, with a stranger's accent. \"This is the  night of the dance.\"    \"Hunha!\" muttered the warrior with some surprise.    Propping himself upon his elbows, the man raised his face. His features  were of the Southern type. From an enemy's camp he was taken captive  long years ago by Tusee's father. But the unusual qualities of the slave  had won the Sioux warrior's heart, and for the last three winters the  man had had his freedom. He was made real man again. His hair was  allowed to grow. However, he himself had chosen to stay in the warrior's  family.    \"Hunha!\" again ejaculated the warrior father. Then turning to his little  daughter, he asked, \"Tusee, do you hear that?\"    \"Yes, father, and I am going to dance tonight!\"    With these words she bounded out of his arm and frolicked about in glee.  Hereupon the proud mother's voice rang out in a chiding laugh.    \"My child, in honor of your first dance your father must give a generous  gift. His ponies are wild, and roam beyond the great hill. Pray, what  has he fit to offer?\" she questioned, the pair of puzzled eyes fixed  upon her.    \"A pony from the herd, mother, a fleet-footed pony from the herd!\" Tusee  shouted with sudden inspiration.    Pointing a small forefinger toward the man lying on the grass, she  cried, \"Uncle, you will go after the pony tomorrow!\" And pleased with  her solution of the problem, she skipped wildly about. Her childish  faith in her elders was not conditioned by a knowledge of human  limitations, but thought all things possible to grown-ups.    \"Haehob!\" exclaimed the mother, with a rising inflection, implying by the  expletive that her child's buoyant spirit be not weighted with a denial.    Quickly to the hard request the man replied, \"How! I go if Tusee tells  me so!\"    This delighted the little one, whose black eyes brimmed over with light.  Standing in front of the strong man, she clapped her small, brown hands  with joy.    \"That makes me glad! My heart is good! Go, uncle, and bring a handsome  pony!\" she cried. In an instant she would have frisked away, but an  impulse held her tilting where she stood. In the man's own tongue, for  he had taught her many words and phrases, she exploded, \"Thank you, good  uncle, thank you!\" then tore away from sheer excess of glee.    The proud warrior father, smiling and narrowing his eyes, muttered  approval, \"Howo! Hechetu!\"    Like her mother, Tusee has finely pencilled eyebrows and slightly  extended nostrils; but in her sturdiness of form she resembles her  father.    A loyal daughter, she sits within her tepee making beaded deerskins for  her father, while he longs to stave off her every suitor as all unworthy  of his old heart's pride. But Tusee is not alone in her dwelling. Near  the entrance-way a young brave is half reclining on a mat. In silence he  watches the petals of a wild rose growing on the soft buckskin. Quickly  the young woman slips the beads on the silvery sinew thread, and works  them into the pretty flower design. Finally, in a low, deep voice, the  young man begins:    \"The sun is far past the zenith. It is now only a man's height above the  western edge of land. I hurried hither to tell you tomorrow I join the  war party.\"    He pauses for reply, but the maid's head drops lower over her deerskin,  and her lips are more firmly drawn together. He continues:    \"Last night in the moonlight I met your warrior father. He seemed to  know I had just stepped forth from your tepee. I fear he did not like  it, for though I greeted him, he was silent. I halted in his pathway.  With what boldness I dared, while my heart was beating hard and fast, I  asked him for his only daughter.    \"Drawing himself erect to his tallest height, and gathering his loose  robe more closely about his proud figure, he flashed a pair of piercing  eyes upon me.    \"'Young man,' said he, with a cold, slow voice that chilled me to the  marrow of my bones, 'hear me. Naught but an enemy's scalp-lock, plucked  fresh with your own hand, will buy Tusee for your wife,' Then he turned  on his heel and stalked away.\"    Tusee thrusts her work aside. With earnest eyes she scans her lover's  face.    \"My father's heart is really kind. He would know if you are brave and  true,\" murmured "]]]
