But although I  was persuaded not so much by the hope of supplying what was required, as by  the shame of refusing, yet, as the matter opened itself before me, I  undertook of my own accord a much greater task than had been imposed; that  while I should thus oblige my very good friends by a fuller compliance, I  might not enter a common path and tread only in the footsteps of others.  For most other writers who have treated of the art of speaking, have  proceeded in such a manner as if upon adepts in every other kind of  doctrine they would lay the last touch in eloquence; either despising as  little things the studies which we first learn, or thinking them not to  fall to their share in the division which should be made of the  professions; or, what indeed is next to this, hoping no praise or thanks  for their ingenuity about things which, although necessary, lie far from  ostentation: the tops of buildings make a show, their foundations are  unseen.\"--_Quintiliani de Inst. Orat., Prooemium._    26. But the reader may ask, \"What have all these things to do with English  Grammar?\" I answer, they help to show us whence and what it is. Some  acquaintance with the history of grammar as a science, as well as some  knowledge of the structure of other languages than our own, is necessary to  him who professes to write for the advancement of this branch of  learning--and for him also who would be a competent judge of what is thus  professed. Grammar must not forget her origin. Criticism must not resign  the protection of letters. The national literature of a country is in the  keeping, not of the people at large, but of authors and teachers. But a  grammarian presumes to be a judge of authorship, and a teacher of teachers;  and is it to the honour of England or America, that in both countries so  many are countenanced in this assumption of place, who can read no language  but their mother tongue? English Grammar is not properly an indigenous  production, either of this country or of Britain; because it is but a  branch of the general science of philology--a new variety, or species,  sprung up from the old stock long ago transplanted from the soil of Greece  and Rome.    27. It is true, indeed, that neither any ancient system of grammatical  instruction nor any grammar of an other language, however contrived, can be  entirely applicable to the present state of our tongue; for languages must  needs differ greatly one from an other, and even that which is called the  same, may come in time to differ greatly from what it once was. But the  general analogies of speech, which are the central principles of grammar,  are but imperfectly seen by the man of one language. On the other hand, it  is possible to know much of those general principles, and yet be very  deficient in what is peculiar to our own tongue. Real improvement in the  grammar of our language, must result from a view that is neither partial  nor superficial. \"Time, sorry artist,\" as was said of old, \"makes all he  handles worse.\" And Lord Bacon, seeming to have this adage in view,  suggests: \"If Time of course alter all things to the worse, and Wisdom and  Counsel shall not alter them to the better, what shall be the  end?\"--_Bacon's Essays_, p. 64.    28. Hence the need that an able and discreet grammarian should now and then  appear, who with skillful hand can effect those corrections which a change  of fashion or the ignorance of authors may have made necessary; but if he  is properly qualified for his task, he will do all this without a departure  from any of the great principles of Universal Grammar. He will surely be  very far from thinking, with a certain modern author, whom I shall notice  in an other chapter, that, \"He is bound to take words and explain them as  he finds them in his day, _without any regard to their ancient construction  and application_.\"--_Kirkham's Gram._, p. 28. The whole history of every  word, so far as he can ascertain it, will be the view under which he will  judge of what is right or wrong in the language which he teaches. Etymology  is neither the whole of this view, nor yet to be excluded from it. I concur  not therefore with Dr. Campbell, who, to make out a strong case,  extravagantly says, \"It is _never from an attention to etymology_, which  would frequently mislead us, but from custom, the only infallible guide in  this matter, that the meanings of words in present use must be  learnt.\"--_Philosophy of Rhetoric_, p. 188. Jamieson too, with an  implicitness little to be commended, takes this passage from Campbell; and,  with no other change than that of \"_learnt_\" to \"_learned_\" publishes it as  a corollary of his own.--_Grammar of Rhetoric_, p. 42. It is folly to state  for truth what is so obviously wrong. Etymology and custom are seldom at  odds; and where they are so, the latter can hardly be deemed infallible.          CHAPTER II.    OF GRAMMATICAL AUTHORSHIP.    \"Respondeo, dupliciter aliquem dici grammaticum, arte et professione.  Grammatici vera arte paucissimi sunt: et hi magna laude digni sunt, ut  patuit: hos non vituperant summi viri; quia ipse Plinius ejusmodi  grammaticus fuit, et de arte grammatica libelos edidit. Et Grellius verae  grammaticae fuit diligentissimus doctor; sic et ipse Datus. Alii sunt  grammatici professione, et ii plerumque sunt inceptissimi; quia scribimus  indocti doctique, et indignissimus quisque hanc sibi artem vindicat:----hos  mastigias multis probris docti summo jure insectantur.\"--DESPAUTER.  _Syntaxis_, fol. 1.      1. It is of primary importance in all discussions and expositions of  doctrines, of any sort, to ascertain well the _principles_ upon which our  reasonings are to be founded, and to see that they be such as are immovably  established in the nature of things; for error in first principles is  fundamental, and he who builds upon an uncertain foundation, incurs at  least a _hazard_ of seeing his edifice overthrown. The lover of _truth_  will be, at all times, diligent to seek it, firm to adhere to it, willing  to submit to it, and ready to promote it; but even the truth may be urged  unseasonably, and important facts are things liable to be misjoined. It is  proper, therefore, for every grammarian gravely to consider, whether and  how far the principles of his philosophy, his politics, his morals, or his  religion, ought to influence, or actually do influence, his theory of  language, and his practical instructions respecting the right use of words.  In practice, grammar is so interwoven with all else that is known,  believed, learned, or spoken of among men, that to determine its own  peculiar principles with due distinctness, seems to be one of the most  difficult points of a grammarian's duty.    2. From misapprehension, narrowness of conception, or improper bias, in  relation to this point, many authors have started wrong; denounced others  with intemperate zeal; departed themselves from sound doctrine; and  produced books which are disgraced not merely by occasional oversights, but  by central and radical errors. Hence, too, have sprung up, in the name of  grammar, many unprofitable discussions, and whimsical systems of teaching,  calculated rather to embarrass than to inform the student. Mere collisions  of opinion, conducted without any acknowledged standard to guide the  judgement, never tend to real improvement. Grammar is unquestionably a  branch of that universal philosophy by which the thoroughly educated mind  is enlightened to see all things aright; for philosophy, in this sense of  the term, is found in everything. Yet, properly speaking, the true  grammarian is not a philosopher, nor can any man strengthen his title to  the former character by claiming the latter; and it is certain, that a most  disheartening proportion of what in our language has been published under  the name of Philosophic Grammar, is equally remote from philosophy, from  grammar, and from common sense.    3. True grammar is founded on the authority of reputable custom; and that  custom, on the use which men make of their reason. The proofs of what is  right are accumulative, and on many points there can be no dispute, because  our proofs from the best usage, are both obvious and innumerable. On the  other hand, the evidence of what is wrong is rather demonstrative; for when  we would expose a particular error, we exhibit it in contrast with the  established principle which it violates. He who formed the erroneous  sentence, has in this case no alternative, but either to acknowledge the  solecism, or to deny the authority of the rule. There are disputable  principles in grammar, as there are moot points in law; but this  circumstance affects no settled usage in either; and every person of sense  and taste will choose to express himself in the way least liable to  censure. All are free indeed from positive constraint on their phraseology;  for we do not speak or write by statutes. But the ground of instruction  assumed in grammar, is similar to that upon which are established the  maxims of _common law_, in jurisprudence. The ultimate principle, then, to  which we appeal, as the only true standard of grammatical propriety, is  that species of custom which critics denominate GOOD USE; that is, present,  reputable, general use.    4. Yet a slight acquaintance with the history of grammar will suffice to  show us, that it is much easier to acknowledge this principle, and to  commend it in words, than to ascertain what it is, and abide by it in  practice. Good use is that which is neither ancient nor recent, neither  local nor foreign, neither vulgar nor pedantic; and it will be found that  no"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/11620"],[0,"My Brilliant Career (#13)"],[1," but as he had just recovered from an illness he  was coming up for a change now instead. Having heard much of him, I was  curious to see him. He was grandmamma's adopted son, and was the orphan  of very aristocratic English parents who had left him to the  guardianship of distant relatives. They had proved criminally  unscrupulous. By finding a flaw in deeds, or something which none but  lawyers understand, they had deprived him of all his property and left  him to sink or swim. Grannie had discovered, reared, and educated him.  Among professions he had chosen the bar, and was now one of Sydney's  most promising young barristers. His foster-mother was no end proud of  him, and loved him as her own son.    In due time a telegram arrived from uncle Julius, containing  instructions for the buggy to be sent to Gool-Gool to meet him and  Everard Grey.    By this time I had quite recovered from influenza and my accident, and  as they would not arrive till near nightfall, for their edification I  was to be dressed in full-blown dinner costume, also I was to be  favoured with a look at my reflection in a mirror for the first time  since my arrival.    During the afternoon I was dispatched by grannie on a message some miles  away, and meeting Mr Hawden some distance from the house, he took it  upon himself to accompany me. Everywhere I went he followed after, much  to my annoyance, because grannie gave me many and serious talkings-to  about the crime of encouraging young men.    Frank Hawden had changed his tune, and told me now that it mattered not  that I was not pretty, as pretty or not I was the greatest brick of a  girl he had met. His idea for this opinion was that I was able to talk  theatres with him, and was the only girl there, and because he had  arrived at that overflowing age when young men have to be partial to  some female whether she be ugly or pretty, fat or lean, old or young.  That I should be the object of these puerile emotions in a fellow like  Frank Hawden, filled me with loathing and disgust.    It was late in the afternoon when Hawden and I returned, and the buggy  was to be seen a long way down the road, approaching at the  going-for-the-doctor pace at which uncle Julius always drove.    Aunt Helen hustled me off to dress, but I was only half-rigged when they  arrived, and so was unable to go out and meet them. Uncle Julius  inquired for that youngster of Lucy's, and aunt Helen replied that she  would be forthcoming when they were dressed for dinner. The two  gentlemen took a nip, to put a little heart in them uncle Julius said,  and auntie Helen came to finish my toilet while they were making theirs.    \"There now, you have nothing to complain of in the way of looks,\" she  remarked at the completion of the ceremony. \"Come and have a good look  at yourself.\"    I was decked in my first evening dress, as it was a great occasion. It  was only on the rarest occasion that we donned full war-paint at  Caddagat. I think that evening dress is one of the prettiest and most  idiotic customs extant. What can be more foolish than to endanger one's  health by exposing at night the chest and arms--two of the most vital  spots of the body--which have been covered all day? On the other hand,  what can be more beautiful than a soft white bosom rising and falling  amid a dainty nest of silk and lace? Every woman looks more soft and  feminine in a _decollete_ gown. And is there any of the animal lines  known pleasanter to the eye than the contour of shapely arms? Some there  are who cry down evening dress as being immodest and indecent. These  will be found among those whose chest and arms will not admit of being  displayed, or among those who, not having been reared to the custom,  dislike it with many other things from want of use.    Aunt Helen took me into the wide old drawing-room, now brilliantly  lighted. A heavy lamp was on each of the four brackets in the corners,  and another swung from the centre of the ceiling, and candelabra threw  many lights from the piano. Never before had I seen this room in such a  blaze of light. During the last week or two aunt Helen and I had  occupied it every night, but we never lighted more than a single candle  on the piano. This had been ample light for our purpose. Aunt Helen  would sing in her sweet sad voice all the beautiful old songs I loved,  while I curled myself on a mat at her side and read books--the music  often compelling me to forget the reading, and the reading occasionally  rendering me deaf to the music; but through both ever came the solemn  rush of the stream outside in its weird melancholy, like a wind  ceaselessly endeavouring to outstrip a wild vain regret which  relentlessly pursued.    \"Your uncle Julius always has the drawing-room lighted like this; he  does not believe in shadowy half light--calls it sentimental bosh,\" said  aunt Helen in explanation.    \"Is uncle like that?\" I remarked, but my question remained unanswered.  Leaving a hand-mirror with me, aunt Helen had slipped away.    One wall of the drawing-room was monopolized by a door, a big bookcase,  and a heavy bevelled-edged old-fashioned mirror--the two last-mentioned  articles reaching from floor to ceiling. Since my arrival the face of  the mirror had been covered, but this evening the blue silken curtains  were looped up, and it was before this that I stood.    I looked, and looked again in pleased surprise. I beheld a young girl  with eyes and skin of the clearest and brightest, and lips of brilliant  scarlet, and a chest and pair of arms which would pass muster with the  best. If Nature had been in bad humour when moulding my face, she had  used her tools craftily in forming my figure. Aunt Helen had proved a  clever maid and dressmaker. My pale blue cashmere dress fitted my fully  developed yet girlish figure to perfection. Some of my hair fell in  cunning little curls on my forehead; the remainder, tied simply with a  piece of ribbon, hung in thick waves nearly to my knees. My toilet had  altered me almost beyond recognition. It made me look my age--sixteen  years and ten months--whereas before, when dressed carelessly and with  my hair plastered in a tight coil, people not knowing me would not  believe that I was under twenty. Joy and merriment lit up my face, which  glowed with youth, health, and happiness, which rippled my lips in  smiles, which displayed a splendid set of teeth, and I really believe  that on that night I did not look out of the way ugly.    I was still admiring my reflection when aunt Helen returned to say that  Everard and uncle Julius were smoking on the veranda and asking for me.    \"What do you think of yourself, Sybylla?\"    \"Oh, aunt Helen, tell me that there is something about me not completely  hideous!\"    She took my face between her hands, saying:    \"Silly child, there are some faces with faultless features, which would  receive nothing more than an indifferent glance while beside other faces  which might have few if any pretensions to beauty. Yours is one of those  last mentioned.\"    \"But that does not say I am not ugly.\"    \"No one would dream of calling you plain, let alone ugly; brilliant is  the word which best describes you.\"    Uncle Julius had the upper part of his ponderous figure arrayed in a  frock-coat. He did not take kindly to what he termed \"those skittish  sparrow-tailed affairs\". Frock-coats suited him, but I am not partial to  them on every one. They look well enough on a podgy, fat, or broad man,  but on a skinny one they hang with such a forlorn, dying-duck  expression, that they invariably make me laugh.    Julius John Bossier, better known as J. J. Bossier, and better still as  Jay-Jay--big, fat, burly, broad, a jovial bachelor of forty, too fond of  all the opposite sex ever to have settled his affections on one in  particular--was well known, respected, and liked from Wagga Wagga to  Albury, Forbes to Dandaloo, Bourke to Hay, from Tumut to Monaro, and  back again to Peak Hill, as a generous man, a straight goer in business  matters, and a jolly good fellow all round.    I was very proud to call him uncle.    \"So this is yourself, is it!\" he exclaimed, giving me a tremendous hug.    \"Oh, uncle,\" I expostulated, \"wipe your old kisses off! Your breath  smells horribly of whisky and tobacco.\"    \"Gammon, that's what makes my kisses so nice!\" he answered; and, after  holding me at arm's-length for inspection, \"By George, you're a  wonderful-looking girl! You're surely not done growing yet, though! You  are such a little nipper. I could put you in my pocket with ease. You  aren't a scrap like your mother. I'll give the next shearer who passes a  shilling to cut that hair off. It would kill a dog in the hot weather.\"    \"Everard, this is my niece, Sybylla\" (aunt Helen was introducing us).  \"You will have to arrange yourselves--what relation you are, and how to  address each other.\"    The admiration expressed in his clear sharp eyes gave me a sensation  different to any I had ever experienced previously.    \"I suppose I'm a kind of uncle and brother in one, and as either  relationship entitles me to a kiss, I'm going to take one,\" he said in a  very gallant manner.    \"You may take one if you can,\" I said with mischievous defiance,  springing off the veranda into the flower-garden. He accepted my  challenge, and, being lithe as a cat, a tremendous scamper ensued. Round  and round the flower-beds we ran. Uncle Jay-Jay's beard opened in a  broad smile, which ended in a loud laugh. Everard Grey's coat-tails flew  in the breeze he made, and his collar was too high for athletic  purposes. I laughed too, and was lost, and we returned to the  veranda--Everard in triumph, and I feeling very red and uncomfortable.    Grannie had arrived upon the scene, looking the essence of brisk  respectability in a black silk gown and a white lace cap. She cast on me  a glance of severe disapproval, and denounced my conduct as shameful;  but"]]]
