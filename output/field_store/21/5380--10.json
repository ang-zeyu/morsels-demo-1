Bohemia and thy Palgrave, Rhine,      Give this the feast, and that the wine;[19]          The Arch Electoral Seven,    Like choral stars around the sun,    Gird him whose hand a world has won,          The anointed choice of Heaven.      In galleries raised above the pomp,      Press'd crowd on crowd their panting way,    And with the joy-resounding tromp,      Rang out the millions' loud hurra!    For, closed at last the age of slaughter,    When human blood was pour'd as water--          LAW dawns upon the world![20]    Sharp force no more shall right the wrong,    And grind the weak to crown the strong--          War's carnage-flag is furl'd!      In Rudolf's hand the goblet shines--      And gaily round the board look'd he;    \"And proud the feast, and bright the wines      My kingly heart feels glad to me!    Yet where the Gladness-Bringer--blest    In the sweet art which moves the breast          With lyre and verse divine?    Dear from my youth the craft of song,    And what as knight I loved so long,          As Kaiser, still be mine.\"      Lo, from the circle bending there,      With sweeping robe the Bard appears,    As silver white his gleaming hair,      Bleach'd by the many winds of years;    \"And music sleeps in golden strings--    Love's rich reward the minstrel sings,          Well known to him the ALL    High thoughts and ardent souls desire!    What would the Kaiser from the lyre          Amidst the banquet-hall?\"      The Great One smiled--\"Not mine the sway--      The minstrel owns a loftier power--    A mightier king inspires the lay--      Its hest--THE IMPULSE OF THE HOUR!\"    As through wide air the tempests sweep,    As gush the springs from mystic deep,          Or lone untrodden glen;    So from dark hidden fount within    Comes SONG, its own wild world to win          Amidst the souls of men!      Swift with the fire the minstrel glow'd,      And loud the music swept the ear:--    \"Forth to the chase a Hero rode,      To hunt the bounding chamois-deer;    With shaft and horn the squire behind;--    Through greensward meads the riders wind--          A small sweet bell they hear.    Lo, with the HOST, a holy man--    Before him strides the sacristan,          And the bell sounds near and near.      \"The noble hunter down-inclined      His reverent head and soften'd eye,    And honor'd with a Christian's mind      The Christ who loves humility!    Loud through the pasture, brawls and raves    A brook--the rains had fed the waves,          And torrents from the bill.    His sandal-shoon the priest unbound,    And laid the Host upon the ground,          And near'd the swollen rill!      \"What wouldst thou, priest?\" the Count began,      As, marveling much, he halted there,    \"Sir Count, I seek a dying man,      Sore-hungering for the heavenly fare.    The bridge that once its safety gave,    Rent by the anger of the wave,          Drifts down the tide below.    Yet barefoot now, I will not fear    (The soul that seeks its God, to cheer)          Through the wild wave to go!\"      \"He gave that priest the knightly steed,      He reach'd that priest the lordly reins,    That he might serve the sick man's need,      Nor slight the task that heaven ordains.    He took the horse the squire bestrode;          On to the sick, the priest!    And when the morrow's sun was red,    The servant of the Savior led          Back to its lord the beast.      \"'Now Heaven forfend!' the Hero cried,      'That e'er to chase or battle more    These limbs the sacred steed bestride      That once my Maker's image bore;    If not a boon allow'd to thee,    Thy Lord and mine its Master be,          My tribute to the King,    From whom I hold, as fiefs, since birth,    Honor, renown, the goods of earth,          Life and each living thing!\"      \"'So may the God, who faileth never      To hear the weak and guide the dim,    To thee give honor here and ever,      As thou hast duly honor'd Him!'    Far-famed ev'n now through Swisserland    Thy generous heart and dauntless hand;          And fair from thine embrace    Six daughters bloom,[21] six crowns to bring,    Blest as the daughters of a KING,          The mothers of a RACE!\"      The mighty Kaiser heard amazed!      His heart was in the days of old;    Into the minstrel's heart he gazed,      That tale the Kaiser's own had told.    Yes, in the bard the priest he knew,    And in the purple veil'd from view          The gush of holy tears!    A thrill through that vast audience ran,    And every heart the godlike man          Revering God--reveres!

And as Antaeus was slain at last, when Hercules  lifted him from the earth and strangled him while raised aloft, so can  the soul slay the enemy (the desire, the passion, the evil, the  earth's offspring), when bearing it from earth itself and stifling it  in the higher air.--Translator.]    [Footnote 11: Translated by Edward, Lord Lytton (Permission George  Routledge & Sons.)]    [Footnote 12: \"I call the Living--I mourn the Dead--I break the  Lightning.\" These words are inscribed on the Great Bell of the Minster  of Schaffhausen--also on that of the Church of Art near Lucerne.

The  most controversial district was, of course, Macedonia. Bulgaria claimed  central Macedonia, with Monastir and Okhrida, which was the lion's share,  on ethnical grounds which have been already discussed, and it was expected  that Greece and Serbia, by obtaining other acquisitions elsewhere, would  consent to have their territories separated by the large Bulgarian wedge  which was to be driven between them. The exact future line of demarcation  between Serbian and Bulgarian territory was to be left to arbitration. The  possible creation of an independent Albania was not contemplated.    In August 1912 the twenty-fifth anniversary of King Ferdinand's arrival in  Bulgaria was celebrated with much rejoicing at the ancient capital of  Tirnovo, and was marred only by the news of the terrible massacre of  Bulgars by Turks at Kochana in Macedonia; this event, however, opportune  though mournful, tended considerably to increase the volume of the wave of  patriotism which swept through the country. Later in the same month Count  Berchtold startled Europe with his 'progressive decentralization' scheme  of reform for Macedonia. The manner in which this event led to the final  arrangements for the declaration of war on Turkey by the four Balkan  States is given in full elsewhere (cf. p. 151).    The Bulgarian army was fully prepared for the fray, and the autumn  manoeuvres had permitted the concentration unobserved of a considerable  portion of it, ready to strike when the time came. Mobilisation was  ordered on September 30, 1912. On October 8 Montenegro declared war on  Turkey. On October 13 Bulgaria, with the other Balkan States, replied to  the remonstrances of Russia and Austria by declaring that its patience was  at length exhausted, and that the sword alone was able to enforce proper  treatment of the Christian populations in European Turkey. On October 17  Turkey, encouraged by the sudden and unexpected conclusion of peace with  Italy after the Libyan war, declared war on Bulgaria and Serbia, and on  October 18 King Ferdinand addressed a sentimental exhortation to his  people to liberate their fellow-countrymen, who were still groaning under  the Crescent.    The number of Turkish troops opposing the Bulgarians in Thrace was about  180,000, and they had almost exactly the same number wherewith to oppose  the Serbians in Macedonia; for, although Macedonia was considered by the  Turks to be the most important theatre of war, yet the proximity of the  Bulgarian frontier to Constantinople made it necessary to retain a large  number of troops in Thrace. On October 19 the Bulgarians took the frontier  town of Mustafa Pasha. On October 24 they defeated the Turks at  Kirk-Kilisse (or Lozengrad), further east. From October 28 to November 2  raged the terrific battle of Lule-Burgas, which resulted in a complete and  brilliant victory of the Bulgarians over the Turks. The defeat and  humiliation of the Turks was as rapid and thorough in Thrace as it had  been in Macedonia, and by the middle of November the remains of the  Turkish army were entrenched behind the impregnable lines of Chataldja,  while a large garrison was shut up in Adrianople, which had been invested  by the end of October. The Bulgarian army, somewhat exhausted by this  brilliant and lightning campaign, refrained from storming the lines of  Chataldja, an operation which could not fail to involve losses such as the  Bulgarian nation was scarcely in a position to bear, and on December 3 the  armistice was signed. The negotiations conducted in London for two months  led, however, to no result, and on February 3, 1913, hostilities were  resumed. These, for the Bulgarians, resolved themselves into the more  energetic prosecution of the siege of Adrianople, which had not been  raised during the armistice. To their assistance Serbia, being able to  spare troops from Macedonia, sent 50,000 men and a quantity of heavy siege  artillery, an arm which the Bulgarians lacked. On March 26, 1913, the  fortress surrendered to the allied armies.    The Conference of London, which took place during the spring of that year,  fixed the new Turco-Bulgarian boundary by drawing the famous Enos-Midia  line, running between these two places situated on the shores respectively  of the Aegean and the Black Sea. This delimitation would have given  Bulgaria possession of Adrianople. But meanwhile Greece and especially  Serbia, which latter country had been compelled to withdraw from the  Adriatic coast by Austria, and was further precluded from ever returning  there by the creation of the independent state of Albania, determined to  retain possession of all that part of Macedonia, including the whole  valley of the Vardar with its important railway, which they had conquered,  and thus secure their common frontier. In May 1913 a military convention  was concluded between them, and the Balkan League, the relations between  the members of which had been becoming more strained ever since January,  finally dissolved. Bulgaria, outraged by this callous disregard of the  agreements as to the partition of Macedonia signed a year previously by  itself and its ex-allies, did not wait for the result of the arbitration  which was actually proceeding in Russia, but in an access of indignation  rushed to arms.    This second Balkan war, begun by Bulgaria during the night of June 30,  1913, by a sudden attack on the Serbian army in Macedonia, resulted in its  undoing. In order to defeat the Serbs and Greeks the south-eastern and  northern frontiers were denuded of troops. But the totally unforeseen  happened. The Serbs were victorious, defeating the Bulgars in Macedonia,  the Turks, seeing Thrace empty of Bulgarian troops, re-occupied  Adrianople, and the Rumanian army, determined to see fair play before it  was too late, invaded Bulgaria from the north and marched on Sofia. By the  end of July the campaign was over and Bulgaria had to submit to fate.    By the terms of the Treaty of Bucarest, which was concluded on August 10,  1913, Bulgaria obtained a considerable part of Thrace and eastern  Macedonia, including a portion of the Aegean coast with the seaport of  Dedeagach, but it was forced to 'compensate' Rumania with a slice of its  richest province (the districts of Dobrich and Silistria in north-eastern  Bulgaria), and it lost central Macedonia, a great part of which it would  certainly have been awarded by Russia's arbitration. On September 22,  1913, the Treaty of Constantinople was signed by Bulgaria and Turkey; by  its terms Turkey retained possession of Adrianople and of a far larger  part of Thrace than its series of ignominious defeats in the autumn of  1912 entitled it to.    In the fatal quarrel between Bulgaria and Serbia which caused the  disruption of the Balkan League, led to the tragic second Balkan war of  July 1913, and naturally left behind the bitterest feelings, it is  difficult to apportion the blame. Both Serbia and Bulgaria were  undoubtedly at fault in the choice of the methods by which they sought to  adjust their difference, but the real guilt is to be found neither in  Sofia nor in Belgrade, but in Vicuna and Budapest. The Balkan League  barred the way of the Germanic Powers to the East; its disruption weakened  Bulgaria and again placed Serbia at the mercy of the Dual Monarchy. After  these trying and unremunerative experiences it is not astonishing that the  Bulgarian people and its ambitious ruler should have retired to the remote  interior of their shell.           *       *       *       *       *    _Explanation of Serbian orthography_    c = ts  [)c] = ch (as in _church_)  ['c] =  \"  \"  \"  but softer  [)s] =  sh  [)z] =  zh (as z in _azure_)  gj  = g (as in _George_)  j = y    [Illustration: THE BALKAN PENINSULA]          SERBIA        14    _The Serbs under Foreign Supremacy_, 650-1168      The manner of the arrival of the Slavs in the Balkan peninsula, of that of  the Bulgars, and of the formation of the Bulgarian nationality has already  been described (cf. p. 26). The installation of the Slavs in the lands  between the Danube, the Aegean, and the Adriatic was completed by about  A.D. 650. In the second half of the seventh century the Bulgars settled  themselves in the eastern half of the peninsula and became absorbed by the  Slavs there, and from that time the nationality of the Slavs in the  western half began to be more clearly defined. These latter, split up into  a number of tribes, gradually grouped themselves into three main divisions:  Serbs (or Serbians), Croats (or Croatians), and Slovenes. The Serbs, much  the most numerous of the three, occupied roughly the modern kingdom of  Serbia (including Old Serbia and northern Macedonia), Montenegro, and most  of Bosnia, Hercegovina, and Dalmatia; the Croats occupied the more western  parts of these last three territories and Croatia; the Slovenes occupied  the modern Carniola and southern Carinthia. Needless to say, none of these  geographical designations existed in those days except Dalmatia, on the  coast of which the Latin influence and nomenclature maintained itself. The  Slovenes, whose language is closely akin to but not identical with Serbian  (or Croatian), even to-day only number one and a half million, and do not  enter into this narrative, as they have never played any political role in  the Balkan peninsula.    The Serbs and the Croats were, as regards race and language, originally  one people, the two names having merely geographical signification. In  course of time, for various reasons connected with religion and politics,  the distinction was emphasized, and from a historical point of view the  Serbo-Croatian race has always been divided into two. It is only within  the last few years that a movement has taken place, the object of which is  to reunite Serbs and Croats into one nation and eventually into one state.  The movement originated in Serbia, the Serbs"]]]
