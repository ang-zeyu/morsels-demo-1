But in a sort of passionate whirl, the ensuing events moved swiftly.    Smith hesitated not one instant. With a panther-like leap he hurled  himself into the hall.    \"The lights, Petrie!\" he cried--\"the lights! The switch is near the  street-door!\"    I clenched my fists in a swift effort to regain control of my  treacherous nerves, and, bounding past Smith, and past the foot of the  stair, I reached out my hand to the switch, the situation of which,  fortunately, I knew.    Around I came, in response to a shrill cry from behind me--an inhuman  cry, less a cry than the shriek of some enraged animal....    With his left foot upon the first stair, Nayland Smith stood, his lean  body bent perilously backward, his arms rigidly thrust out, and his  sinewy fingers gripping the throat of an almost naked man--a man whose  brown body glistened unctuously, whose shaven head was apish low, whose  bloodshot eyes were the eyes of a mad dog! His teeth, upper and lower,  were bared; they glistened, they gnashed, and a froth was on his lips.  With both his hands, he clutched a heavy stick, and once--twice, he  brought it down upon Nayland Smith's head!    I leaped forward to my friend's aid; but as though the blows had been  those of a feather, he stood like some figure of archaic statuary, nor  for an instant relaxed the death grip which he had upon his adversary's  throat.    Thrusting my way up the stairs, I wrenched the stick from the hand of  the dacoit--for in this glistening brown man, I recognized one of that  deadly brotherhood who hailed Dr. Fu-Manchu their Lord and Master.                      *       *       *       *       *    I cannot dwell upon the end of that encounter; I cannot hope to make  acceptable to my readers an account of how Nayland Smith, glassy-eyed,  and with consciousness ebbing from him instant by instant, stood there,  a realization of Leighton's \"Athlete,\" his arms rigid as iron bars even  after Fu-Manchu's servant hung limply in that frightful grip.    In his last moments of consciousness, with the blood from his wounded  head trickling down into his eyes, he pointed to the stick which I had  torn from the grip of the dacoit, and which I still held in my hand.    \"Not Aaron's rod, Petrie!\" he gasped hoarsely--\"the rod of  Moses!--Slattin's stick!\"    Even in upon my anxiety for my friend, amazement intruded.    \"But,\" I began--and turned to the rack in which Slattin's favorite cane  at that moment reposed--had reposed at the time of his death.    Yes!--there stood Slattin's cane; we had not moved it; we had disturbed  nothing in that stricken house; there it stood, in company with an  umbrella and a malacca.    I glanced at the cane in my hand. Surely there could not be two such in  the world?    Smith collapsed on the floor at my feet.    \"Examine the one in the rack, Petrie,\" he whispered, almost inaudibly,  \"but do not touch it. It may not be yet....\"    I propped him up against the foot of the stairs, and as the constable  began knocking violently at the street door, crossed to the rack and  lifted out the replica of the cane which I held in my hand.    A faint cry from Smith--and as if it had been a leprous thing, I dropped  the cane instantly.    \"Merciful God!\" I groaned.    Although, in every other particular, it corresponded with that which I  held--which I had taken from the dacoit--which he had come to substitute  for the cane now lying upon the floor--in one dreadful particular it  differed.    Up to the snake's head it was an accurate copy; but the head lived!    Either from pain, fear or starvation, the thing confined in the hollow  tube of this awful duplicate was become torpid. Otherwise, no power  on earth could have saved me from the fate of Abel Slattin; for the  creature was an Australian death-adder.        CHAPTER XI. THE WHITE PEACOCK    Nayland Smith wasted no time in pursuing the plan of campaign which he  had mentioned to Inspector Weymouth. Less than forty-eight hours after  quitting the house of the murdered Slattin, I found myself bound along  Whitechapel Road upon strange enough business.    A very fine rain was falling, which rendered it difficult to see clearly  from the windows; but the weather apparently had little effect upon the  commercial activities of the district. The cab was threading a hazardous  way through the cosmopolitan throng crowding the street. On either side  of me extended a row of stalls, seemingly established in opposition to  the more legitimate shops upon the inner side of the pavement.    Jewish hawkers, many of them in their shirt-sleeves, acclaimed the  rarity of the bargains which they had to offer; and, allowing for the  difference of costume, these tireless Israelites, heedless of climatic  conditions, sweating at their mongery, might well have stood, not in a  squalid London thoroughfare, but in an equally squalid market-street of  the Orient.    They offered linen and fine raiment; from footgear to hair-oil their  wares ranged. They enlivened their auctioneering with conjuring tricks  and witty stories, selling watches by the aid of legerdemain, and fancy  vests by grace of a seasonable anecdote.    Poles, Russians, Serbs, Roumanians, Jews of Hungary, and Italians  of Whitechapel mingled in the throng. Near East and Far East rubbed  shoulders. Pidgin English contested with Yiddish for the ownership of  some tawdry article offered by an auctioneer whose nationality defied  conjecture, save that always some branch of his ancestry had drawn  nourishment from the soil of Eternal Judea.    Some wearing mens' caps, some with shawls thrown over their oily locks,  and some, more true to primitive instincts, defying, bare-headed, the  unkindly elements, bedraggled women--more often than not burdened with  muffled infants--crowded the pavements and the roadway, thronged about  the stalls like white ants about some choicer carrion.    And the fine drizzling rain fell upon all alike, pattering upon the hood  of the taxi-cab, trickling down the front windows; glistening upon the  unctuous hair of those in the street who were hatless; dewing the bare  arms of the auctioneers, and dripping, melancholy, from the tarpaulin  coverings of the stalls. Heedless of the rain above and of the mud  beneath, North, South, East, and West mingled their cries, their bids,  their blandishments, their raillery, mingled their persons in that  joyless throng.    Sometimes a yellow face showed close to one of the streaming windows;  sometimes a black-eyed, pallid face, but never a face wholly sane and  healthy. This was an underworld where squalor and vice went hand in hand  through the beautiless streets, a melting-pot of the world's outcasts;  this was the shadowland, which last night had swallowed up Nayland  Smith.    Ceaselessly I peered to right and left, searching amid that rain-soaked  company for any face known to me. Whom I expected to find there, I know  not, but I should have counted it no matter for surprise had I detected  amid that ungracious ugliness the beautiful face of Karamaneh the  Eastern slave-girl, the leering yellow face of a Burmese dacoit, the  gaunt, bronzed features of Nayland Smith; a hundred times I almost  believed that I had seen the ruddy countenance of Inspector Weymouth,  and once (at which instant my heart seemed to stand still) I suffered  from the singular delusion that the oblique green eyes of Dr. Fu-Manchu  peered out from the shadows between two stalls.    It was mere phantasy, of course, the sick imaginings of a mind  overwrought. I had not slept and had scarcely tasted food for more  than thirty hours; for, following up a faint clue supplied by Burke,  Slattin's man, and, like his master, an ex-officer of New York Police,  my friend, Nayland Smith, on the previous evening had set out in quest  of some obscene den where the man called Shen-Yan--former keeper of an  opium-shop--was now said to be in hiding.    Shen-Yan we knew to be a creature of the Chinese doctor, and only a most  urgent call had prevented me from joining Smith upon this promising,  though hazardous expedition.    At any rate, Fate willing it so, he had gone without me; and  now--although Inspector Weymouth, assisted by a number of C. I. D. men,  was sweeping the district about me--to the time of my departure nothing  whatever had been heard of Smith. The ordeal of waiting finally had  proved too great to be borne. With no definite idea of what I proposed  to do, I had thrown myself into the search, filled with such dreadful  apprehensions as I hope never again to experience.    I did not know the exact situation of the place to which Smith was gone,  for owing to the urgent case which I have mentioned, I had been absent  at the time of his departure; nor could Scotland Yard enlighten me  upon this point. Weymouth was in charge of the case--under Smith's  direction--and since the inspector had left the Yard, early that  morning, he had disappeared as completely as Smith, no report having  been received from him.    As my driver turned into the black mouth of a narrow, ill-lighted  street, and the glare and clamor of the greater thoroughfare died behind  me, I sank into the corner of the cab burdened with such a sense of  desolation as mercifully comes but rarely.    We were heading now for that strange settlement off the West India Dock  Road, which, bounded by Limehouse Causeway and Pennyfields, and narrowly  confined within four streets, composes an unique Chinatown, a miniature  of that at Liverpool, and of the greater one in San Francisco. Inspired  with an idea which promised hopefully, I raised the speaking tube.    \"Take me first to the River Police Station,\" I directed; \"along  Ratcliffe Highway.\"    The man turned and nodded comprehendingly, as I could see through the  wet pane.    Presently we swerved to the right and into an even narrower street. This "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/11870"],[0,"The Country of the Blind, and Other Stories (#13)"],[1," I chucked lumps of coral at him from a safe distance, but he  only swallowed them. I shied my open knife at him and almost lost it,  though it was too big for him to swallow. I tried starving him out and  struck fishing, but he took to picking along the beach at low water after  worms, and rubbed along on that. Half my time I spent up to my neck in the  lagoon, and the rest up the palm-trees. One of them was scarcely high  enough, and when he caught me up it he had a regular Bank Holiday with the  calves of my legs. It got unbearable. I don't know if you have ever tried  sleeping up a palm-tree. It gave me the most horrible nightmares. Think of  the shame of it, too! Here was this extinct animal mooning about my island  like a sulky duke, and me not allowed to rest the sole of my foot on the  place. I used to cry with weariness and vexation. I told him straight that  I didn't mean to be chased about a desert island by any damned  anachronisms. I told him to go and peck a navigator of his own age. But he  only snapped his beak at me. Great ugly bird, all legs and neck!    \"I shouldn't like to say how long that went on altogether. I'd have killed  him sooner if I'd known how. However, I hit on a way of settling him at  last. It is a South American dodge. I joined all my fishing-lines together  with stems of seaweed and things, and made a stoutish string, perhaps  twelve yards in length or more, and I fastened two lumps of coral rock to  the ends of this. It took me some time to do, because every now and then  I had to go into the lagoon or up a tree as the fancy took me. This I  whirled rapidly round my head, and then let it go at him. The first time I  missed, but the next time the string caught his legs beautifully, and  wrapped round them again and again. Over he went. I threw it standing  waist-deep in the lagoon, and as soon as he went down I was out of the  water and sawing at his neck with my knife ...    \"I don't like to think of that even now. I felt like a murderer while I  did it, though my anger was hot against him. When I stood over him and saw  him bleeding on the white sand, and his beautiful great legs and neck  writhing in his last agony ... Pah!    \"With that tragedy loneliness came upon me like a curse. Good Lord! you  can't imagine how I missed that bird. I sat by his corpse and sorrowed  over him, and shivered as I looked round the desolate, silent reef.  I thought of what a jolly little bird he had been when he was hatched, and  of a thousand pleasant tricks he had played before he went wrong.  I thought if I'd only wounded him I might have nursed him round into a  better understanding. If I'd had any means of digging into the coral rock  I'd have buried him. I felt exactly as if he was human. As it was,  I couldn't think of eating him, so I put him in the lagoon, and the little  fishes picked him clean. I didn't even save the feathers. Then one day a  chap cruising about in a yacht had a fancy to see if my atoll still  existed.    \"He didn't come a moment too soon, for I was about sick enough of the  desolation of it, and only hesitating whether I should walk out into the  sea and finish up the business that way, or fall back on the green  things...    \"I sold the bones to a man named Winslow--a dealer near the British  Museum, and he says he sold them to old Havers. It seems Havers didn't  understand they were extra large, and it was only after his death they  attracted attention. They called 'em AEpyornis--what was it?\"    \"_AEpyornis vastus_,\" said I. \"It's funny, the very thing was  mentioned to me by a friend of mine. When they found an AEpyornis, with a  thigh a yard long, they thought they had reached the top of the scale, and  called him _AEpyornis maximus_. Then some one turned up another  thigh-bone four feet six or more, and that they called _AEpyornis  Titan_. Then your _vastus_ was found after old Havers died, in his  collection, and then a _vastissimus_ turned up.\"    \"Winslow was telling me as much,\" said the man with the scar. \"If they get  any more AEpyornises, he reckons some scientific swell will go and burst a  blood-vessel. But it was a queer thing to happen to a man; wasn't it--  altogether?\"            VII.      THE REMARKABLE CASE OF DAVIDSON'S EYES.    I.    The transitory mental aberration of Sidney Davidson, remarkable enough in  itself, is still more remarkable if Wade's explanation is to be credited.  It sets one dreaming of the oddest possibilities of intercommunication in  the future, of spending an intercalary five minutes on the other side of  the world, or being watched in our most secret operations by unsuspected  eyes. It happened that I was the immediate witness of Davidson's seizure,  and so it falls naturally to me to put the story upon paper.    When I say that I was the immediate witness of his seizure, I mean that I  was the first on the scene. The thing happened at the Harlow Technical  College, just beyond the Highgate Archway. He was alone in the larger  laboratory when the thing happened. I was in a smaller room, where the  balances are, writing up some notes. The thunderstorm had completely upset  my work, of course. It was just after one of the louder peals that I  thought I heard some glass smash in the other room. I stopped writing, and  turned round to listen. For a moment I heard nothing; the hail was playing  the devil's tattoo on the corrugated zinc of the roof. Then came another  sound, a smash--no doubt of it this time. Something heavy had been knocked  off the bench. I jumped up at once and went and opened the door leading  into the big laboratory.    I was surprised to hear a queer sort of laugh, and saw Davidson standing  unsteadily in the middle of the room, with a dazzled look on his face. My  first impression was that he was drunk. He did not notice me. He was  clawing out at something invisible a yard in front of his face. He put out  his hand, slowly, rather hesitatingly, and then clutched nothing. \"What's  come to it?\" he said. He held up his hands to his face, fingers spread  out. \"Great Scott!\" he said. The thing happened three or four years ago,  when every one swore by that personage. Then he began raising his feet  clumsily, as though he had expected to find them glued to the floor.    \"Davidson!\" cried I. \"What's the matter with you?\" He turned round in my  direction and looked about for me. He looked over me and at me and on  either side of me, without the slightest sign of seeing me. \"Waves,\" he  said; \"and a remarkably neat schooner. I'd swear that was Bellow's voice.  _Hullo_!\" He shouted suddenly at the top of his voice.    I thought he was up to some foolery. Then I saw littered about his feet  the shattered remains of the best of our electrometers. \"What's up, man?\"  said I. \"You've smashed the electrometer!\"    \"Bellows again!\" said he. \"Friends left, if my hands are gone. Something  about electrometers. Which way _are_ you, Bellows?\" He suddenly came  staggering towards me. \"The damned stuff cuts like butter,\" he said. He  walked straight into the bench and recoiled. \"None so buttery that!\" he  said, and stood swaying.    I felt scared. \"Davidson,\" said I, \"what on earth's come over you?\"    He looked round him in every direction. \"I could swear that was Bellows.  Why don't you show yourself like a man, Bellows?\"    It occurred to me that he must be suddenly struck blind. I walked round  the table and laid my hand upon his arm. I never saw a man more startled  in my life. He jumped away from me, and came round into an attitude of  self-defence, his face fairly distorted with terror. \"Good God!\" he cried.  \"What was that?\"    \"It's I--Bellows. Confound it, Davidson!\"    He jumped when I answered him and stared--how can I express it?--right  through me. He began talking, not to me, but to himself. \"Here in broad  daylight on a clear beach. Not a place to hide in.\" He looked about him  wildly. \"Here! I'm _off_.\" He suddenly turned and ran headlong into  the big electro-magnet--so violently that, as we found afterwards, he  bruised his shoulder and jawbone cruelly. At that he stepped back a pace,  and cried out with almost a whimper, \"What, in Heaven's name, has come  over me?\" He stood, blanched with terror and trembling violently, with his  right arm clutching his left, where that had collided with the magnet.    By that time I was excited and fairly scared. \"Davidson,\" said I, \"don't  be afraid.\"    He was startled at my voice, but not so excessively as before. I repeated  my words in as clear and as firm a tone as I could assume. \"Bellows,\" he  said, \"is that you?\"    \"Can't you see it's me?\"    He laughed. \"I can't even see it's myself. Where the devil are we?\"    \"Here,\" said I, \"in the laboratory.\"    \"The laboratory!\" he answered in a puzzled tone, and put his hand to his  forehead. \"I _was_ in the laboratory--till that flash came, but I'm  hanged if I'm there now. What ship is that?\"    \"There's no ship,\" said I. \"Do be sensible, old chap.\"    \"No ship!\" he repeated, and seemed to forget my denial forthwith. \"I  suppose,\" said he slowly, \"we're both dead. But the rummy part is I feel  just as though I still had a body. Don't get used to it all at once, I  suppose. The old shop was struck by lightning, I suppose. Jolly quick  thing, Bellows--eigh?\"    \"Don't talk nonsense. You're very much alive. You are in the laboratory,  blundering about. You've just smashed a new electrometer. I don't envy you  when Boyce arrives.\"    He stared away from me towards the diagrams of cryohydrates. \"I must be  deaf,\" said he. \"They've fired a gun, for there goes the puff of smoke,  and I never heard a sound.\"    I put my hand on his arm again, and this time he was less alarmed. \"We  seem to have a sort of invisible bodies,\" said he. \"By Jove! there's a  boat coming round the headland. It's very much like the old life after  all--in a different climate.\"    I shook his arm. \"Davidson,\" I cried, \"wake up!\"        II.    It "]]]
