I  associated it with animals rather--horribly. In the history of the  world, no doubt, it has been common enough, alas, but fortunately today  there can be but few who know it, or would recognize it even when heard.  The bones shot back into my body the same instant, but red-hot and  burning; the brief instant of irresolution passed; I was torn between  the desire to break down the door and enter, and to run--run for my life  from a thing I dared not face.    Out of the horrid tumult, then, I adopted neither course. Without  reflection, certainly without analysis of what was best to do for my  sister, myself or Mabel, I took up my action where it had been  interrupted. I turned from the awful door and moved slowly towards the  head of the stairs.    But that dreadful little sound came with me. I believe my own teeth  chattered. It seemed all over the house--in the empty halls that opened  into the long passages towards the music-room, and even in the grounds  outside the building. From the lawns and barren garden, from the ugly  terraces themselves, it rose into the night, and behind it came a  curious driving sound, incomplete, unfinished, as of wailing for  deliverance, the wailing of desperate souls in anguish, the dull and dry  beseeching of hopeless spirits in prison.    That I could have taken the little sound from the bedroom where I  actually heard it, and spread it thus over the entire house and grounds,  is evidence, perhaps, of the state my nerves were in.    The wailing assuredly was in my mind alone. But the longer I hesitated,  the more difficult became my task, and, gathering up my dressing gown,  lest I should trip in the darkness, I passed slowly down the staircase  into the hail below. I carried neither candle nor matches; every switch  in room and corridor was known to me. The covering of darkness was  indeed rather comforting than otherwise, for if it prevented seeing, it  also prevented being seen. The heavy pistol, knocking against my thigh  as I moved, made me feel I was carrying a child's toy, foolishly. I  experienced in every nerve that primitive vast dread which is the Thrill  of darkness. Merely the child in me was comforted by that pistol.    The night was not entirely black; the iron bars across the glass front  door were visible, and, equally, I discerned the big, stiff wooden  chairs in the hall, the gaping fireplace, the upright pillars supporting  the staircase, the round table in the center with its books and  flower-vases, and the basket that held visitors' cards. There, too, was  the stick and umbrella stand and the shelf with railway guides,  directory, and telegraph forms. Clocks ticked everywhere with sounds  like quiet footfalls. Light fell here and there in patches from the  floor above. I stood a moment in the hall, letting my eyes grow more  accustomed to the gloom, while deciding on a plan of search. I made out  the ivy trailing outside over one of the big windows ... and then the  tall clock by the front door made a grating noise deep down inside its  body--it was the Presentation clock, large and hideous, given by the  congregation of his church--and, dreading the booming strike it seemed  to threaten, I made a quick decision. If others beside myself were about  in the night, the sound of that striking might cover their approach.    So I tiptoed to the right, where the passage led towards the dining  room. In the other direction were the morning- and drawing rooms, both  little used, and various other rooms beyond that had been his, generally  now kept locked. I thought of my sister, waiting upstairs with that  frightened woman for my return. I went quickly, yet stealthily.    And, to my surprise, the door of the dining room was open. It had been  opened. I paused on the threshold, staring about me. I think I fully  expected to see a figure blocked in the shadows against the heavy  sideboard, or looming on the other side beneath his portrait. But the  room was empty; I felt it empty. Through the wide bow-windows that gave  on to the verandah came an uncertain glimmer that even shone reflected  in the polished surface of the dinner-table, and again I perceived the  stiff outline of chairs, waiting tenantless all round it, two larger  ones with high carved backs at either end. The monkey trees on the upper  terrace, too, were visible outside against the sky, and the solemn  crests of the wellingtonias on the terraces below. The enormous clock on  the mantelpiece ticked very slowly, as though its machinery were running  down, and I made out the pale round patch that was its face. Resisting  my first inclination to turn the lights up--my hand had gone so far as  to finger the friendly knob--I crossed the room so carefully that no  single board creaked, nor a single chair, as I rested a hand upon its  back, moved on the parquet flooring. I turned neither to the right nor  left, nor did I once look back.    I went towards the long corridor filled with priceless _objets d'art_,  that led through various antechambers into the spacious music-room, and  only at the mouth of this corridor did I next halt a moment in  uncertainty. For this long corridor, lit faintly by high windows on the  left from the verandah, was very narrow, owing to the mass of shelves  and fancy tables it contained. It was not that I feared to knock over  precious things as I went, but, that, because of its ungenerous width,  there would be no room to pass another person--if I met one. And the  certainty had suddenly come upon me that somewhere in this corridor  another person at this actual moment stood. Here, somehow, amid all this  dead atmosphere of furniture and impersonal emptiness, lay the hint of a  living human presence; and with such conviction did it come upon me,  that my hand instinctively gripped the pistol in my pocket before I  could even think. Either some one had passed along this corridor just  before me, or some one lay waiting at its farther end--withdrawn or  flattened into one of the little recesses, to let me pass. It was the  person who had opened the door. And the blood ran from my heart as I  realized it.    It was not courage that sent me on, but rather a strong impulsion from  behind that made it impossible to retreat: the feeling that a throng  pressed at my back, drawing nearer and nearer; that I was already half  surrounded, swept, dragged, coaxed into a vast prison-house where there  was wailing and gnashing of teeth, where their worm dieth not and their  fire is not quenched. I can neither explain nor justify the storm of  irrational emotion that swept me as I stood in that moment, staring down  the length of the silent corridor towards the music-room at the far end,  I can only repeat that no personal bravery sent me down it, but that the  negative emotion of fear was swamped in this vast sea of pity and  commiseration for others that surged upon me.    My senses, at least, were no whit confused; if anything, my brain  registered impressions with keener accuracy than usual. I noticed, for  instance, that the two swinging doors of baize that cut the corridor  into definite lengths, making little rooms of the spaces between them,  were both wide-open--in the dim light no mean achievement. Also that the  fronds of a palm plant, some ten feet in front of me, still stirred  gently from the air of someone who had recently gone past them. The long  green leaves waved to and fro like hands. Then I went stealthily forward  down the narrow space, proud even that I had this command of myself, and  so carefully that my feet made no sound upon the Japanese matting on the  floor.    It was a journey that seemed timeless. I have no idea how fast or slow I  went, but I remember that I deliberately examined articles on each side  of me, peering with particular closeness into the recesses of wall and  window. I passed the first baize doors, and the passage beyond them  widened out to hold shelves of books; there were sofas and small  reading-tables against the wall.    It narrowed again presently, as I entered the second stretch. The  windows here were higher and smaller, and marble statuettes of classical  subject lined the walls, watching me like figures of the dead. Their  white and shining faces saw me, yet made no sign. I passed next between  the second baize doors. They, too, had been fastened back with hooks  against the wall. Thus all doors were open--had been recently opened.    And so, at length, I found myself in the final widening of the corridor  which formed an antechamber to the music-room itself. It had been used  formerly to hold the overflow of meetings. No door separated it from the  great hall beyond, but heavy curtains hung usually to close it off, and  these curtains were invariably drawn. They now stood wide. And here--I  can merely state the impression that came upon me--I knew myself at last  surrounded. The throng that pressed behind me, also surged in front:  facing me in the big room, and waiting for my entry, stood a multitude;  on either side of me, in the very air above my head, the vast assemblage  paused upon my coming. The pause, however, was momentary, for instantly  the deep, tumultuous movement was resumed that yet was silent as a  cavern underground. I felt the agony that was in it, the passionate  striving, the awful struggle to escape. The semi-darkness held  beseeching faces that fought to press themselves upon my vision,  yearning yet hopeless eyes, lips scorched and dry, mouths that opened to  implore but found no craved delivery in actual words, and a fury of  misery and hate that made the life in me stop dead, frozen by the horror  of vain pity. That intolerable, vain Hope was everywhere.    And the multitude, it came to me, was not a single multitude, but many;  for, as soon as one huge division pressed too close upon the edge of"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/11093"],[0,"Trailin'! (#13)"],[1,"me to wake you up?\"    \"Never mind; I wake up automatic. S'long, Bud.\"    He stretched out on the blankets and was instantly asleep.          CHAPTER XIII      A TOUCH OF CRIMSON    At the end of three hours he awoke as sharply as though an alarm were  clamouring at his ear. There was no elaborate preparation for renewed  activities. A single yawn and stretch and he was again on his feet.  Since the boy was not in sight he cooked himself an enormous meal,  devoured it, and went out to the mustang.    The roan greeted him with a volley from both heels that narrowly missed  the head of Nash, but the cowpuncher merely smiled tolerantly.    \"Feelin' fit agin, eh, damn your soul?\" he said genially, and picking up  a bit of board, fallen from the side of the shed, he smote the mustang  mightily along the ribs. The mustang, as if it recognized the touch of  the master, pricked up one ear and side-stepped. The brief rest had  filled it with all the old, vicious energy.    For once more, as soon as they rode clear of the door, there ensued a  furious struggle between man and beast. The man won, as always, and the  roan, dropping both ears flat against its neck, trotted sullenly out  across the hills.    In that monotony of landscape, one mile exactly like the other, no  landmarks to guide him, no trail to follow, however faintly worn, it was  strange to see the cowpuncher strike out through the vast distances of  the mountain-desert with as much confidence as if he were travelling on  a paved street in a city. He had not even a compass to direct him but he  seemed to know his way as surely as the birds know the untracked paths  of the air in the seasons of migration.    Straight on through the afternoon and during the long evening he kept  his course at the same unvarying dog-trot until the flush of the sunset  faded to a stern grey and the purple hills in the distance turned blue  with shadows. Then, catching the glimmer of a light on a hillside, he  turned toward it to put up for the night.    In answer to his call a big man with a lantern came to the door and  raised his light until it shone on a red, bald head and a portly figure.  His welcome was neither hearty nor cold; hospitality is expected in the  mountain-desert. So Nash put up his horse in the shed and came back to  the house.    The meal was half over, but two girls immediately set a plate heaped  with fried potatoes and bacon and flanked by a mighty cup of jetblack  coffee on one side and a pile of yellow biscuits on the other. He nodded  to them, grunted by way of expressing thanks, and sat down to eat.    Beside the tall father and the rosy-faced mother, the family consisted  of the two girls, one of them with her hair twisted severely close to  her head, wearing a man's blue cotton shirt with the sleeves rolled up  to a pair of brown elbows. Evidently she was the boy of the family and  to her fell the duty of performing the innumerable chores of the ranch,  for her hands were thick with work and the tips of the fingers blunted.  Also she had that calm, self-satisfied eye which belongs to the  workingman who knows that he has earned his meal.    Her sister monopolized all the beauty and the grace, not that she was  either very pretty or extremely graceful, but she was instinct with the  challenge of femininity like a rare scent. It lingered about her, it  enveloped her ways; it gave a light to her eyes and made her smile  exquisite. Her clothes were not of much finer material than her  sister's, but they were cut to fit, and a bow of crimson ribbon at her  throat was as effective in that environment as the most costly orchids  on an evening gown.    She was armed in pride this night, talking only to her mother, and then  in monosyllables alone. At first it occurred to Steve that his coming  had made her self-conscious, but he soon discovered that her pride was  directed at the third man at the table. She at least maintained a  pretence of eating, but he made not even a sham, sitting miserably, his  mouth hard set, his eyes shadowed by a tremendous frown. At length he  shoved back his chair with such violence that the table trembled.    \"Well,\" he rumbled, \"I guess this lets me out. S'long.\"    And he strode heavily from the room; a moment later his cursing came  back to them as he rode into the night.    \"Takes it kind of hard, don't he?\" said the father.    And the mother murmured: \"Poor Ralph!\"    \"So you went an' done it?\" said the mannish girl to her sister.    \"What of it?\" snapped the other.    \"He's too good for you, that's what of it.\"    \"Girls!\" exclaimed the mother anxiously. \"Remember we got a guest!\"    \"Oh,\" said she of the strong brown arms, \"I guess we can't tell him  nothin'; I guess he had eyes to be seein' what's happened.\" She turned  calmly to Steve.    \"Lizzie turned down Ralph Boardman--poor feller!\"    \"Sue!\" cried the other girl.    \"Well, after you done it, are you ashamed to have it talked about? You  make me sore, I'll tell a man!\"    \"That's enough, Sue,\" growled the father.    \"What's enough?\"    \"We ain't goin' to have no more show about this. I've had my supper  spoiled by it already.\"    \"I say it's a rotten shame,\" broke out Sue, and she repeated, \"Ralph's  too good for her. All because of a city dude--a tenderfoot!\"    In the extremity of her scorn her voice drawled in a harsh murmur.    \"Then take him yourself, if you can get him!\" cried Lizzie. \"I'm sure I  don't want him!\"    Their eyes blazed at each other across the table, and Lizzie, having  scored an unexpected point, struck again.    \"I think you've always had a sort of hankerin' after Ralph--oh, I've  seen your eyes rollin' at him.\"    The other girl coloured hotly through her tan.    \"If I was fond of him I wouldn't be ashamed to let him know, you can  tell the world that. And I wouldn't keep him trottin' about like a  little pet dog till I got tired of him and give him up for the sake of a  greenhorn who\"--her voice lowered to a spiteful hiss--\"kissed you the  first time he even seen you!\"    In vain Lizzie fought for her control; her lip trembled and her voice  shook.    \"I hate you, Sue!\"    \"Sue, ain't you ashamed of yourself?\" pleaded the mother.    \"No, I ain't! Think of it; here's Ralph been sweet on Liz for two years  an' now she gives him the go-by for a skinny, affected dude like that  feller that was here. And he's forgot you already, Liz, the minute he  stopped laughing at you for bein' so easy.\"    \"Ma, are you goin' to let Sue talk like this--right before a stranger?\"    \"Sue, you shut up!\" commanded the father.    \"I don't see nobody that can make me,\" she said, surly as a grown boy.  \"I can't make any more of a fool out of Liz than that tenderfoot made  her!\"    \"Did he,\" asked Steve, \"ride a piebald mustang?\"    \"D'you know him?\" breathed Lizzie, forgetting the tears of shame which  had been gathering in her eyes.    \"Nope. Jest heard a little about him along the road.\"    \"What's his name?\"    Then she coloured, even before Sue could say spitefully: \"Didn't he even  have to tell you his name before he kissed you?\"    \"He did! His name is--Tony!\"    \"Tony!\"--in deep disgust. \"Well, he's dark enough to be a dago! Maybe  he's a foreign count, or something, Liz, and he'll take you back to live  in some castle or other.\"    But the girl queried, in spite of this badinage: \"Do you know his name?\"    \"His name,\" said Nash, thinking that it could do no harm to betray as  much as this, \"is Anthony Bard, I think.\"    \"And you don't know him?\"    \"All I know is that the feller who used to own that piebald mustang is  pretty mad and cusses every time he thinks of him.\"    \"He didn't steal the hoss?\"    This with more bated breath than if the question had been: \"He didn't  kill a man?\" for indeed horse-stealing was the greater crime.    Even Nash would not make such an accusation directly, and therefore he  fell back on an innuendo almost as deadly.    \"I dunno,\" he said non-committally, and shrugged his shoulders.    With all his soul he was concentrating on the picture of the man who  conquered a fighting horse and flirted successfully with a pretty girl  the same day; each time riding on swiftly from his conquest. The clues  on this trail were surely thick enough, but they were of such a nature  that the pleasant mind of Steve grew more and more thoughtful.          CHAPTER XIV      LEMONADE    In fact, so thoughtful had Nash become, that he slept with extraordinary  lightness that night and was up at the first hint of day. Sue appeared  on the scene just in time to witness the last act of the usual drama of  bucking on the part of the roan, before it settled down to the  mechanical dog-trot with which it would wear out the ceaseless miles of  the mountain-desert all day and far into the night, if need be.    Nash now swung more to the right, cutting across the hills, for he  presumed that by this time the tenderfoot must have gotten his bearings  and would head straight for Eldara. It was a stiff two day journey, now,  the whole first day's riding having been a worse than useless detour; so  the bulldog jaw set harder and harder, and the keen eyes squinted as if  to look into the dim future.    Once each day, about noon, when the heat made even the desert and the  men of the desert drowsy, he allowed his imagination to roam freely,  counting the thousand dollars over and over again, and tasting again the  joys of a double salary. Yet even his hardy imagination rarely rose to  the height of Sally Fortune. That hour of dreaming, however, made the  day of labour almost pleasant.    This time, in the very middle of his dream, he reached the cross-roads  saloon and general merchandise store of Flanders; so he banished his  visions with a compelling shrug of the shoulders and rode for it at a  gallop, a hot dryness growing in his throat at every stride. Quick  service he was sure to get, for there were not more than half a dozen  cattle-ponies"]]]
