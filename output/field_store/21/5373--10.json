Athavle has published some 25 eminently forgettable  novels, and has had a lackluster career in Lok Satta,  the Marathi daily of the Express group.    Athavle gets quite alarmed when someone mentions  'Vishal Gomantak' (Greater Goa), which to him means  'expansionism'. But he has no qualms at all when he  says that Goa should finally merge with Maharashtra  because \"their cultures are the same\".    In his zeal to propagate the interest of Marathi, he  has even neglected the success of his newspaper which  has been falling in circulation. Tarun Bharat,  published from Belgaum in Karnataka, has taken away  6,000 out of the 18,000-odd Gomantak circulation. Yet  Athavle has such a strong grip over the owners, the  Chowgules, that he even overseas recruitment. No  Christians are employed in that daily.    Apart from editing O Heraldo, Rajan Narayan, a former  editor of Imprint, now speaks from political platforms.  Narayan has become more a pamphleteer than a  journalist. He often attends the strategy sessions of  the KPA. He has at times tried to maintain a balance  but has failed because he is viewed suspiciously by the  Hindus and because the Christians patronise him.    Rajan Narayan is a professional doing a job and taken  up with a cause which he would just as well drop like a  hot brick if he got a better challenge somewhere else.  However, the turn he has given to the O Herald has  taken its circulation to 12,000 from the 4,000-odd it  was selling before he took over its editorship. \"I  don't make any pretensions that I'm being objective,\"  says he. \"I'm here to fight for Konkani.\"    Come what may, the two Narayans, both non-Goans, are  slugging it out through reams of newsprint. And both  are accused of polarising Goa's good people as never  before. (The Week, Jan 18-24, 1987)    The figures noted above of the Herald's circulation  don't seem to be very accurate. It was more like a few  hundred in its Portuguese days -- specially towards the  fag end of playing the role of being the \"only  Portuguese language daily published in Asia\". But Row  Kavi raises a point long back which probably didn't get  the attention it deserved.    By the time the 1985-87 language agitation was drawing  to a close, this writer was a chief sub-editor at the  Herald. Perhaps the cynical games visible all round  convinced one about not getting caught up in the  meaningless emotionalism that was ruling both  linguistic camps. Basic questions were not being  raised. What primarily was a caste-fuelled was being  fought out along linguistic lines. Many of those who  took up these issues -- as subsequent events showed --  were more keen on cornering a share of the spoils for  themselves and their kin, rather than really empowering  the commonman (and woman) to utilise a language they  could be more at home in. Rajan's own role was critical  in shaping the language issue the way it worked out.  The average Catholic became a hard-core, if later  disillusioned by the subsequent twist of events,  supporter of the Konkani camp, without quite  understanding the unstated issues involved.    On the language front, like many other controversies in  the state, this one too polarised journalists. The  United News of India news agency, though its then Goa  correspondent Jagdish Wagh, then put out a 10-take  article which echoed the Marathi side of the arguments.  Rajan's first response was to dump it in the  waste-paper basket. To one's mind, it made sense that  both 'camps' knew each other's positions on the issue.  Specially because this was one issue where the average  Catholic reader -- who hardly reads Marathi -- was  largely unable to keep abrest with the thoughts of one  side of the debate. To Rajan's credit, he was quick to  accept a suggestion from a junior, and decided that the  article be carried on the edit page. But if one thought  he did this because of the need for a diversity of  voices, that was simply untrue. Some days later, a  gleeful Rajan informed that it was just as well he had  taken up that suggestion, since the UNI write-up had,  in turn, provoked a series of lengthy polemical  responses from the Panjim-based Konkani hardline  supporter Datta Naik written to project the Konkani  cause. It was a point-by-point attempted refutation,  and more. A whole lot of more grist to the linguistic  mill that ultimately served to build circulation,  allowing Rajan to boost his bargaining power on this  basis.    If Rajan played a crucial role in stoking the language  controversy, he was also vital in bringing it to an  abrupt and unexpected end. On the day the language bill  was passed in the Goa assembly, an angry Churchill Alemao   stomped into the Herald office. He demanded to know  how the screaming headline read something to the  effect: 'Konkani made official language'. Alemao's  criticism (with some validity, even if ironical in the  backdrop of his own exclusivist approach which sought  compltely illegitimise the Marathi demand, in what was  in is more of a caste-defined battle) was that the  headline was not justified when the dialect and script  used by a small minority had been given official acceptance.    Later realties also elaborately demonstrated that the  Rane-Khalap drafted official language bill was  extremely ambivalent, if not wholly unimplementable.  Nobody knows for certain whether Goa has one or two  official languages, or almost-official languages. Each  official purpose for which it is to be used would have  to be specifically notified, leading to further  bickerings. Besides, almost everyone would like to  leave the act unimplemented, since it would open up a  can of worms and endless more problems if anyone went  ahead implementing it. The official invitation cards,  now printed in four languages -- English, Hindi, and  Konkani and Marathi -- are enough of an indication of  what a joke this has become.    Nonetheless, the Konkani experience did not stop Rajan  from subsequently claiming that the paper under his  steering had \"demonstrated dramatically its influence  by succeeding to get more than 75,000 people for the  Konkani language\". Of this, he tried to make a case for  better terms -- service conditions, allowances and  possibly commissions on advertisements \"generated\" for  the paper.    EVEN AS HE ANNOUNCED recently his decision to quit the  Herald and launch his own weekend paper, Rajan is back  to donning his role as a 'protector of the minorities'.  But even as he stokes fears here, a genuine question  could be whether this is anything more than a marketing  strategy. His claims of being committed to secularism  could be dismissed by critics as little more than a  cynical strategy of stoking minority fears, to build a  potent constituency, just as some politicians in Goa  have done -- to convert into a permanent votebank of  sorts a large segment of the Catholic electorate. In  July 1987, Rajan told his staff, this writer then being  one of them: \"Our basic constituency are the Catholics,  whether we like it or not. So much so, anything on the  Pope or developments in Christianity should be  interesting to our readers.\"    Rajan was however quick to understand -- unlike most of  the other editors brought into Goa to head papers here,  who sometimes take years just to understand that this  small state doesn't need a scaled-down version of a  national newspaper -- that local news was of vital  importance. To cite a Rajanism, in the form of a blunt  directive to the news-desk: \"The Rajya Sabha election  in Goa is of much greater consequence to use than a  peaceful Yath Ratra (sic) in Ahmedabad. In Punjab, for  instance, I do not think we should take cognisance  unless the death toll is above 10.\" (This was in times  when the Punjab violence was as Kashmir today.)    Rajan was quick to argue that a new paper in Goa should  address those segments which are significant in size.  One can question his obvious strategy of playing on  minority fears and building up a minority psychosis.  Even when viewed from a very narrow sense, this could  be damaging to the interest of the minorities  themselves.    But Rajan's ability to convince the reader still holds.    In September 2003, some Goan expats across cyberspace  were carefully watching the unfolding drama as Rajan  hurriedly launched his http://www.rajannarayan.com  site. Making his an issue of freedom of expression, and  indicting the man who weeks back graced Rajan's  birthday -- Manoharbab Parrikar -- was bound to strike  a chord. Afterall, haven't we in the Press in Goa been  complaining about increasing pressures from the BJP government?    On September 16, 2003, one expat suggested that  \"perhaps the only way to overcome the muzzling of the  press is for Non-Resident Goans to fund an alternative  newspaper, where the journalists can do what they do  best without their livelihood being threatened.\" He  went on to suggest: \"Now is the time for Non-Resident Goans   who care, to come to the assistance of journalists in  Goa. As an alternative, we could support Rajan  Narayan's new venture and give him the freedom to speak  out. Democracy and freedom are at stake in Goa. It is  time for all Goans who love their motherland, to put  their money where their mouths are, and do something  for Goa.\"    To quite some extent the problem with contemporary  Goa's journalism is governments who don't like  criticism and therefore target certain newspapers or  journalists. But this is not the entire story.  Managements who seek to use their papers to get undue  favours, licences, or whatever are another part of the  problem. So are us journalists who don't carry on our  job neutrally and without quid-pro-quo motives. But the  editors who have long been acting as censors, and  implement the agendas of the first two categories  above, are also part of the problem.

Him Leda's conquering son accosted first:--        POLYDEUCES.      Luck to thee, friend unknown! Who own this shore?        AMYCUS.      Luck, quotha, to see men ne'er seen before!

Lions or cocks, we'll play this game or none.          He spoke, and clutched a hollow shell, and blew      His clarion. Straightway to the shadowy pine      Clustering they came, as loud it pealed and long,      Bebrycia's bearded sons; and Castor too,      The peerless in the lists, went forth and called      From the Magnesian ship the Heroes all.          Then either warrior armed with coils of hide      His hands, and round his limbs bound ponderous bands,      And, breathing bloodshed, stept into the ring.      First there was much manoeuvring, who should catch      The sunlight on his rear: but thou didst foil,      O Polydeuces, valour by address;      And full on Amycus' face the hot noon smote.      He in hot wrath strode forward, threatening war;      Straightway the Tyndarid smote him, as he closed,      Full on the chin: more furious waxed he still,      And, earthward bent, dealt blindly random blows.      Bebrycia shouted loud, the Greeks too cheered      Their champion: fearing lest in that scant space      This Tityus by sheer weight should bear him down.      But, shifting yet still there, the son of Zeus      Scored him with swift exchange of left and right,      And checked the onrush of the sea-god's child      Parlous albeit: till, reeling with his wounds,      He stood, and from his lips spat crimson blood.      Cheered yet again the princes, when they saw      The lips and jowl all seamed with piteous scars,      And the swoln visage and the half-closed eyes.      Still the prince teased him, feinting here or there      A thrust; and when he saw him helpless all,      Let drive beneath his eyelids at his nose,      And laid it bare to the bone. The stricken man      Measured his length supine amid the fern.      Keen was the fighting when he rose again,      Deadly the blows their sturdy gauntlets dealt.      But while Bebrycia's chieftain sparred round chest      And utmost shoulder, the resistless foe      Made his whole face one mass of hideous wounds.      While the one sweated all his bulk away,      And, late a giant, seemed a pigmy now,      The other's limbs waxed ever as he fought      In semblance and in size. But in what wise      The child of Zeus brought low that man of greed,      Tell, Muse, for thine is knowledge: I unfold      A secret not mine own; at thy behest      Speak or am dumb, nor speak but as thou wilt.          Amycus, athirst to do some doughty deed,      Stooping aslant from Polydeuces' lunge      Locked their left hands; and, stepping out, upheaved      From his right hip his ponderous other-arm.      And hit and harmed had been Amyclae's king;      But, ducking low, he smote with one stout fist      The foe's left temple--fast the life-blood streamed      From the grim rift--and on his shoulder fell.      While with his left he reached the mouth, and made      The set teeth tingle; and, redoubling aye      His plashing blows, made havoc of his face      And crashed into his cheeks, till all abroad      He lay, and throwing up his arms disclaimed      The strife, for he was even at death's door.      No wrong the vanquished suffered at thy hands,      O Polydeuces; but he sware an oath,      Calling his sire Poseidon from the depths,      Ne'er to do violence to a stranger more.          Thy tale, O prince, is told. Now sing I thee,      Castor the Tyndarid, lord of rushing horse      And shaking javelin, corsleted in brass.          PART II.        The sons of Zeus had borne two maids away,      Leucippus' daughters. Straight in hot pursuit      Went the two brethren, sons of Aphareus,      Lynceus and Idas bold, their plighted lords.      And when the tomb of Aphareus was gained,      All leapt from out their cars, and front to front      Stood, with their ponderous spears and orbed shields.      First Lynceus shouted loud from 'neath his helm:        \"Whence, sirs, this lust for strife? Why, sword in hand,      Raise ye this coil about your neighbours' wives?      To us Leucippus these his daughters gave,      Long ere ye saw them: they are ours on oath.      Ye, coveting (to your shame) your neighbour's bed      And kine and asses and whatever is his,      Suborned the man and stole our wives by bribes.      How often spake I thus before your face,      Yea I myself, though scant I am of phrase:      'Not thus, fair sirs, do honourable men      Seek to woo wives whose troth is given elsewhere.      Lo, broad is Sparta, broad the hunting-grounds      Of Elis: fleecy Arcady is broad,      And Argos and Messene and the towns      To westward, and the long Sisyphian reach.      There 'neath her parents' roof dwells many a maid      Second to none in godliness or wit:      Wed of all these, and welcome, whom ye will,      For all men court the kinship of the brave;      And ye are as your sires, and they whose blood      Runs in your mother's veins, the flower of war.      Nay, sirs, but let us bring this thing to pass;      Then, taking counsel, choose meet brides for you.'      So I ran on; but o'er the shifting seas      The wind's breath blew my words, that found no grace      With you, for ye defied the charmer's voice.      Yet listen to me now if ne'er before:      Lo! we are kinsmen by the father's side.      But if ye lust for war, if strife must break      Forth among kin, and bloodshed quench our feud,      Bold Polydeuces then shall hold his hands      And his cousin Idas from the abhorred fray:      While I and Castor, the two younger-born,      Try war's arbitrament; so spare our sires      Sorrow exceeding. In one house one dead      Sufficeth: let the others glad their mates,      To the bride-chamber passing, not the grave,      And o'er yon maids sing jubilee. Well it were      At cost so small to lay so huge a strife.\"          He spoke--his words heaven gave not to the winds.      They, the two first-born, disarrayed and piled      Their arms, while Lynceus stept into the ring,      And at his shield's rim shook his stalwart spear.      And Castor likewise poised his quivering lance;      High waved the plume on either warrior's helm.      First each at other thrust with busy spear      Where'er he spied an inch of flesh exposed:      But lo! both spearpoints in their wicker shields      Lodged ere a blow was struck, and snapt in twain.      Then they unsheathed their swords, and framed new modes      Of slaughter: pause or respite there was none.      Oft Castor on broad shield and plumed helm      Lit, and oft keen-eyed Lynceus pierced his shield,      Or grazed his crest of crimson. But anon,      As Lynceus aimed his blade at Castor's knee,      Back with the left sprang Castor and struck off      His fingers: from the maimed limb dropped the sword.      And, flying straightway, for his father's tomb      He made, where gallant Idas sat and saw      The battle of the brethren. But the child      Of Zeus rushed in, and with his broadsword drave      Through flank and navel, sundering with swift stroke      His vitals: Lynceus tottered and he fell,      And o'er his eyelids rushed the dreamless sleep.      Nor did their mother see her elder son      Come a fair bridegroom to his Cretan home.      For Idas wrenched from off the dead man's tomb      A jutting slab, to hurl it at the man      Who had slain his brother. Then did Zeus bring aid,      And struck the marble fabric from his grasp,      And with red lightning burned his frame to dust.      So doth he fight with odds who dares provoke      The Tyndarids, mighty sons of mighty sire.      Now farewell, Leda's children: prosper aye      The songs I sing. What minstrel loves not well      The Tyndarids, and Helen, and the chiefs      That trod Troy down for Menelaeus' sake?      The bard of Chios wrought your royal deeds      Into his lays, who sang of Priam's state,      And fights 'neath Ilion's walls; of sailor Greeks,      And of Achilles towering in the strife.      Yet take from me whate'er of clear sweet song      The Muse accords me, even all my store!      The gods' most precious gift is minstrelsy.          IDYLL XXIII.
