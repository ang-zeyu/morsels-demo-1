The picture of society under the pressure of a murderous epidemic, with  its train of physical torments, wretchedness, and demoralization, has  been drawn by more than one eminent author, but by none with more  impressive fidelity and conciseness than by Thucydides, who had no  predecessor, nor anything but the reality, to copy from. We may remark  that amid all the melancholy accompaniments of the time there are no  human sacrifices, such as those offered up at Carthage during pestilence  to appease the anger of the gods--there are no cruel persecutions  against imaginary authors of the disease, such as those against the  Untori (anointers of doors) in the plague of Milan in 1630.    Three years altogether did this calamity desolate Athens: continuously,  during the entire second and third years of the war--after which  followed a period of marked abatement for a year and a half; but it then  revived again, and lasted for another year, with the same fury as at  first. The public loss, over and above the private misery, which this  unexpected enemy inflicted upon Athens, was incalculable. Out of twelve  hundred horsemen, all among the rich men of the state, three hundred  died of the epidemic; besides forty-four hundred _hoplites_ out of the  roll formally kept, and a number of the poorer population so great as to  defy computation. No efforts of the Peloponnesians could have done so  much to ruin Athens, or to bring the war to a termination such as they  desired: and the distemper told the more in their favor, as it never  spread at all into Peloponnesus, though it passed from Athens to some of  the more populous islands. The Lacedaemonian army was withdrawn from  Attica somewhat earlier than it would otherwise have been, for fear of  taking the contagion.    But it was while the Lacedaemonians were yet in Attica, and during the  first freshness of the terrible malady, that Pericles equipped and  conducted from Piraeus an armament of one hundred triremes and four  thousand hoplites to attack the coasts of Peloponnesus; three hundred  horsemen were also carried in some horse-transports, prepared for the  occasion out of old triremes. To diminish the crowd accumulated in the  city was doubtless of beneficial tendency, and perhaps those who went  aboard might consider it as a chance of escape to quit an infected home.  But unhappily they carried the infection along with them, which  desolated the fleet not less than the city, and crippled all its  efforts. Reenforced by fifty ships of war from Chios and Lesbos, the  Athenians first landed near Epidaurus in Peloponnesus, ravaging the  territory and making an unavailing attempt upon the city; next they made  like incursions on the most southerly portions of the Argolic  peninsula--Troezen, Halieis, and Hermione--and lastly attacked and  captured Prasiae, on the eastern coast of Laconia. On returning to  Athens, the same armament was immediately conducted under Agnon and  Cleopompus, to press the siege of Potidaea, the blockade of which still  continued without any visible progress. On arriving there an attack was  made on the walls by battering engines and by the other aggressive  methods then practised; but nothing whatever was achieved. In fact, the  armament became incompetent for all serious effort, from the aggravated  character which the distemper here assumed, communicated by the soldiers  fresh from Athens even to those who had before been free from it at  Potidaea. So frightful was the mortality that out of the four thousand  hoplites under Agnon no fewer than one thousand and fifty died in the  short space of forty days. The armament was brought back in this  distressed condition to Athens, while the reduction of Potidaea was left  as before, to the slow course of blockade.    On returning from the expedition against Peloponnesus, Pericles found  his countrymen almost distracted with their manifold sufferings. Over  and above the raging epidemic they had just gone over Attica and  ascertained the devastations committed by the invaders throughout all  the territory--except the Marathonian Tetrapolis and Deceleia, districts  spared, as we are told, through indulgence founded on an ancient  legendary sympathy--during their long stay of forty days. The rich had  found their comfortable mansions and farms, the poor their modest  cottages, in the various _demes_, torn down and ruined. Death, sickness,  loss of property, and despair of the future now rendered the Athenians  angry and intractable to the last degree. They vented their feelings  against Pericles as the cause not merely of the war, but also of all  that they were now enduring. Either with or without his consent, they  sent envoys to Sparta to open negotiations for peace, but the Spartans  turned a deaf ear to the proposition. This new disappointment rendered  them still more furious against Pericles, whose long-standing political  enemies now doubtless found strong sympathy in their denunciations of  his character and policy. That unshaken and majestic firmness, which  ranked first among his many eminent qualities, was never more  imperiously required and never more effectively manifested.    In his capacity of _strategus_, or general, Pericles convoked a formal  assembly of the people, for the purpose of vindicating himself publicly  against the prevailing sentiment, and recommending perseverance in his  line of policy. The speeches made by his opponents, assuredly very  bitter, are not given by Thucydides; but that of Pericles himself is set  down at considerable length, and a memorable discourse it is. It  strikingly brings into relief both the character of the man and the  impress of actual circumstances--an impregnable mind conscious not only  of right purposes, but of just and reasonable anticipations, and bearing  up with manliness, or even defiance, against the natural difficulty of  the case, heightened by an extreme of incalculable misfortune. He had  foreseen, while advising the war originally, the probable impatience of  his countrymen under its first hardships, but he could not foresee the  epidemic by which that impatience had been exasperated into madness: and  he now addressed them not merely with unabated adherence to his own  deliberate convictions, but also in a tone of reproachful remonstrance  against their unmerited change of sentiment toward him--seeking at the  same time to combat that uncontrolled despair which for the moment  overlaid both their pride and their patriotism. Far from humbling  himself before the present sentiment, it is at this time that he sets  forth his titles to their esteem in the most direct and unqualified  manner, and claims the continuance of that which they had so long  accorded, as something belonging to him by acquired right.    His main object, through this discourse, is to fill the minds of his  audience with patriotic sympathy for the weal of the entire city, so as  to counterbalance the absorbing sense of private woe. If the collective  city flourishes, he argues, private misfortunes may at least be borne;  but no amount of private prosperity will avail if the collective city  falls--a proposition literally true in ancient times and under the  circumstances of ancient warfare, though less true at present.  \"Distracted by domestic calamity, ye are now angry both with me who  advised you to go to war, and with yourselves who followed the advice.  Ye listened to me, considering me superior to others in judgment, in  speech, in patriotism, and in incorruptible probity--nor ought I now to  be treated as culpable for giving such advice, when in point of fact the  war was unavoidable and there would have been still greater danger in  shrinking from it. I am the same man, still unchanged--but ye in your  misfortunes cannot stand to the convictions which ye adopted when yet  unhurt. Extreme and unforeseen, indeed, are the sorrows which have  fallen upon you: yet inhabiting as ye do a great city, and brought up in  dispositions suitable to it, ye must also resolve to bear up against the  utmost pressure of adversity, and never to surrender your dignity. I  have often explained to you that ye have no reason to doubt of eventual  success in the war, but I will now remind you, more emphatically than  before, and even with a degree of ostentation suitable as a stimulus to  your present unnatural depression, that your naval force makes you  masters not only of your allies, but of the entire sea--one-half of the  visible field for action and employment. Compared with so vast a power  as this, the temporary use of your houses and territory is a mere  trifle, an ornamental accessory not worth considering: and this too, if  ye preserve your freedom, ye will quickly recover. It was your fathers  who first gained this empire, without any of the advantages which ye now  enjoy; ye must not disgrace yourselves by losing what they acquired.    \"Delighting as ye all do in the honor and empire enjoyed by the city, ye  must not shrink from the toils whereby alone that honor is sustained:  moreover, ye now fight, not merely for freedom instead of slavery, but  for empire against loss of empire, with all the perils arising out of  imperial unpopularity. It is not safe for you now to abdicate, even if  ye chose to do so; for ye hold your empire like a despotism--unjust  perhaps in the original acquisition, but ruinous to part with when once  acquired. Be not angry with me, whose advice ye followed in going to  war, because the enemy have done such damage as might be expected from  them: still less on account of this unforeseen distemper: I know that  this makes me an object of your special present hatred, though very  unjustly, unless ye will consent to give me credit also for any  unexpected good-luck which may occur.

To do this the more clearly, we will begin with her earliest  duties, and take her completely through the occupations of a day.    23. HAVING RISEN EARLY, as we have already advised (_see_ 3), and having  given due attention to the bath, and made a careful toilet, it will be  well at once to see that the children have received their proper  ablutions, and are in every way clean and comfortable. The first meal of  the day, breakfast, will then be served, at which all the family should  be punctually present, unless illness, or other circumstances, prevent.    24. AFTER BREAKFAST IS OVER, it will be well for the mistress to make a  round of the kitchen and other offices, to see that all are in order,  and that the morning's work has been properly performed by the various  domestics. The orders for the day should then be given, and any  questions which the domestics desire to ask, respecting their several  departments, should be answered, and any special articles they may  require, handed to them from the store-closet.        In those establishments where there is a housekeeper, it will      not be so necessary for the mistress, personally, to perform the      above-named duties.    25. AFTER THIS GENERAL SUPERINTENDENCE of her servants, the mistress, if  a mother of a young family, may devote herself to the instruction of  some of its younger members, or to the examination of the state of their  wardrobe, leaving the later portion of the morning for reading, or for  some amusing recreation. \"Recreation,\" says Bishop Hall, \"is intended to  the mind as whetting is to the scythe, to sharpen the edge of it, which  would otherwise grow dull and blunt. He, therefore, that spends his  whole time in recreation is ever whetting, never mowing; his grass may  grow and his steed starve; as, contrarily, he that always toils and  never recreates, is ever mowing, never whetting, labouring much to  little purpose. As good no scythe as no edge. Then only doth the work go  forward, when the scythe is so seasonably and moderately whetted that it  may cut, and so cut, that it may have the help of sharpening.\"        Unless the means of the mistress be very circumscribed, and she      be obliged to devote a great deal of her time to the making of      her children's clothes, and other economical pursuits, it is      right that she should give some time to the pleasures of      literature, the innocent delights of the garden, and to the      improvement of any special abilities for music, painting, and      other elegant arts, which she may, happily, possess.    26. THESE DUTIES AND PLEASURES BEING PERFORMED AND ENJOYED, the hour of  luncheon will have arrived. This is a very necessary meal between an  early breakfast and a late dinner, as a healthy person, with good  exercise, should have a fresh supply of food once in four hours. It  should be a light meal; but its solidity must, of course, be, in some  degree, proportionate to the time it is intended to enable you to wait  for your dinner, and the amount of exercise you take in the mean time.  At this time, also, the servants' dinner will be served.        In those establishments where an early dinner is served, that      will, of course, take the place of the luncheon. In many houses,      where a nursery dinner is provided for the children and about      one o'clock, the mistress and the elder portion of the family      make their luncheon at the same time from the same joint, or      whatever may be provided. A mistress will arrange, according to      circumstances, the serving of the meal; but the more usual plan      is for the lady of the house to have the joint brought to her      table, and afterwards carried to the nursery.    27. AFTER LUNCHEON, MORNING CALLS AND VISITS may be made and received.  These may be divided under three heads: those of ceremony, friendship,  and congratulation or condolence. Visits of ceremony, or courtesy, which  occasionally merge into those of friendship, are to be paid under  various circumstances. Thus, they are uniformly required after dining at  a friend's house, or after a ball, picnic, or any other party. These  visits should be short, a stay of from fifteen to twenty minutes being  quite sufficient. A lady paying a visit may remove her boa or  neckerchief; but neither her shawl nor bonnet.        When other visitors are announced, it is well to retire as soon      as possible, taking care to let it appear that their arrival is      not the cause. When they are quietly seated, and the bustle of      their entrance is over, rise from your chair, taking a kind      leave of the hostess, and bowing politely to the guests. Should      you call at an inconvenient time, not having ascertained the      luncheon hour, or from any other inadvertence, retire as soon as      possible, without, however, showing that you feel yourself an      intruder. It is not difficult for any well-bred or even      good-tempered person, to know what to say on such an occasion,      and, on politely withdrawing, a promise can be made to call      again, if the lady you have called on, appear really      disappointed.    28. IN PAYING VISITS OF FRIENDSHIP, it will not be so necessary to be  guided by etiquette as in paying visits of ceremony; and if a lady be  pressed by her friend to remove her shawl and bonnet, it can be done if  it will not interfere with her subsequent arrangements. It is, however,  requisite to call at suitable times, and to avoid staying too long, if  your friend is engaged. The courtesies of society should ever be  maintained, even in the domestic circle, and amongst the nearest  friends. During these visits, the manners should be easy and cheerful,  and the subjects of conversation such as may be readily terminated.  Serious discussions or arguments are to be altogether avoided, and there  is much danger and impropriety in expressing opinions of those persons  and characters with whom, perhaps, there is but a slight acquaintance.  (_See_ 6, 7, and 9.)        It is not advisable, at any time, to take favourite dogs into      another lady's drawing-room, for many persons have an absolute      dislike to such animals; and besides this, there is always a      chance of a breakage of some article occurring, through their      leaping and bounding here and there, sometimes very much to the      fear and annoyance of the hostess. Her children, also, unless      they are particularly well-trained and orderly, and she is on      exceedingly friendly terms with the hostess, should not      accompany a lady in making morning calls. Where a lady, however,      pays her visits in a carriage, the children can be taken in the      vehicle, and remain in it until the visit is over.    29. FOR MORNING CALLS, it is well to be neatly attired; for a costume  very different to that you generally wear, or anything approaching an  evening dress, will be very much out of place. As a general rule, it may  be said, both in reference to this and all other occasions, it is better  to be under-dressed than over-dressed.        A strict account should be kept of ceremonial visits, and notice      how soon your visits have been returned. An opinion may thus be      formed as to whether your frequent visits are, or are not,      desirable. There are, naturally, instances when the      circumstances of old age or ill health will preclude any return      of a call; but when this is the case, it must not interrupt the      discharge of the duty.    30. IN PAYING VISITS OF CONDOLENCE, it is to be remembered that they  should be paid within a week after the event which occasions them. If  the acquaintance, however, is but slight, then immediately after the  family has appeared at public worship. A lady should send in her card,  and if her friends be able to receive her, the visitor's manner and  conversation should be subdued and in harmony with the character of her  visit. Courtesy would dictate that a mourning card should be used, and  that visitors, in paying condoling visits, should be dressed in black,  either silk or plain-coloured apparel. Sympathy with the affliction of  the family, is thus expressed, and these attentions are, in such cases,  pleasing and soothing.        In all these visits, if your acquaintance or friend be not at      home, a card should be left. If in a carriage, the servant will      answer your inquiry and receive your card; if paying your visits      on foot, give your card to the servant in the hall, but leave to      go in and rest should on no account be asked. The form of words,      \"Not at home,\" may be understood in different senses; but the      only courteous way is to receive them as being perfectly true.      You may imagine that the lady of the house is really at home,      and that she would make an exception in your favour, or you may      think that your acquaintance is not desired; but, in either      case, not the slightest word is to escape you, which would      suggest, on your part, such an impression.    31. IN RECEIVING MORNING CALLS, the foregoing description of the  etiquette to be observed in paying them, will be of considerable  service. It is to be added, however, that the occupations of drawing,  music, or reading should be suspended on the entrance of morning  visitors. If a lady, however, be engaged with light needlework, and none  other is appropriate in the drawing-room, it may not be, under some  circumstances, inconsistent with good breeding to quietly continue it  during conversation, particularly if the visit be protracted, or the  visitors be gentlemen.        Formerly the custom was to accompany all visitors quitting the      house to the door, and there take leave of them; but modern      society, which has thrown off a great deal of this kind of      ceremony, now merely requires that the lady of the house should      rise from her seat, shake"]]]
