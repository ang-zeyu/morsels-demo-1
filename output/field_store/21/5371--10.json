This holds in the newer part of the city as well as in the old part. A  number of streets there are, for a part of their length, quite given over  to business. Even the Prado itself is the victim of commercial invasion.  What was once one of the finest residences in the city, the old Aldama  place fronting on the Campo de Marte, is now a cigar factory. A little  beyond it is the Tacon market, occupying an entire block. Stores and shops  surround it. The old avenue leading to the once fashionable Cerro, and  to the only less fashionable Jesus del Monte, is now a business street.  Another business street leads out of the Parque Central, alongside the  former Tacon theatre. The broad Calzada de Galiano, once a fashionable  residence street, is now largely commercial. While less picturesque than  some parts of the old city within the walls, the most attractive part of  Havana is undoubtedly the section of El Vedado, the westward extension  along the shore. Here are broad streets, trees, gardens, and many beautiful  and costly dwellings. This is really the modern Havana. A part of it is  only a little above sea-level, and behind that strip is a hill. A few years  ago, only a small number of houses were on the hillside or the hilltop.  Now, it is well built over with modern houses. The architectural type is  generally retained, and it is rather a pity that there should be even  what variation there is. El Vedado is the region of the wealthy and the  well-to-do, with a large percentage of foreigners. It has its social ways,  very much as other places have, in this country, in France, Hong Kong, or  Honolulu. They are not quite our ways, but they are a result of conditions,  just as ours are.    On the hill, a little back of El Vedado, are two \"points of interest\" for  visitors; the old fortress, el Castillo del Principe, and the cemetery.  In the latter are some notable monuments. One is known as the Firemen's  Monument. For many years, Havana has had, supplementary to its municipal  organization, a volunteer firemen's corps. In various ways the latter  resembles a number of military organizations in the United States. It is at  once a somewhat exclusive social club and a practical force. Membership  is a social distinction. If you are in Havana and see men in admirably  tailored, uniforms and fire helmets, rushing in a particular direction in  cabs, carriages or automobiles, you may know that they are members of the  _Bomberos del Comercio_ on their way to a conflagration. Most excellent  real work they have done again and again in time of fire and flood. On  parade, they look exceedingly dapper with their helmets, uniforms, boots  and equipment, somewhat too dandified even to suggest any smoke other than  that of cigars or cigarettes. But they are the \"real thing in smoke-eaters\"  when they get to work. They have a long list of heroic deeds on their  records. The monument in Colon Cemetery commemorates one of those deeds.  In an extensive and dangerous fire, in May, 1890, thirty of these men  lost their lives. A few years later, this beautiful and costly shaft was  erected, by private subscription, as a tribute to their valor and devotion.  Another shaft, perhaps no less notable, commemorates a deplorable and  unpardonable event. A number of medical students, mere boys, in the  University of Havana, were charged with defacing the tomb of a Spanish  officer who had been killed by a Cuban in a political quarrel. At  its worst, it was a boyish prank, demanding rebuke or even some mild  punishment. Later evidence indicates that while there was a demonstration  there was no defacement of the vault. Forty-two students were arrested as  participants, tried by court-martial, and sentenced to be shot. Eight of  them were shot at La Punta, at the foot of the Prado near the sea-front,  and the remainder sentenced to imprisonment for life. All of these, I  believe, were afterward released. The Students' Monument expresses the  feeling of the Cubans in the matter, a noble memorial. There are numerous  other shafts and memorials that are notable and interesting. A number of  Cuba's leaders, Maximo Gomez, Calixto Garcia, and others, are buried in  this cemetery.    [Illustration: A RESIDENCE IN EL VEDADO]    Further on, to the southeast, are other sections of the new Havana, the  districts of Cerro and Jesus del Monte. El Vedado has largely supplanted  these neighborhoods as the \"court end\" of the city. Many of the fine old  residences of forty or fifty years ago still remain, but most of them are  now closely surrounded by the more modest homes of a less aristocratic  group. A few gardens remain to suggest what they were in the earlier days.  Still further out, in the west-and-south quarter-circle, are little towns,  villages, and hamlets, typically Cuban, with here and there the more  imposing estate of planter or proprietor. But, far the greater number of  visitors, perhaps with greater reason, find more of charm and interest  in the city itself than in the suburbs or the surrounding country. The  enjoyment of unfamiliar places is altogether personal. There are many who  really see nothing; they come away from a brief visit with only a confusion  of vague recollections of sights and sounds, of brief inspection of  buildings about which they knew nothing, of the big, yellow Palace, of this  church and that, of the Morro and the harbor, of sunny days, and of late  afternoons along the Prado and the Malecon. To me, Havana is losing its  greatest charm through an excess of Americanization, slowly but steadily  taking from the place much of the individuality that made it most  attractive. It will be a long time before that is entirely lost, but  five-story office buildings, automobiles in the afternoon parade, steaks  or ham and eggs at an eight or nine o'clock breakfast, and all kinds of  indescribable hats in place of dainty and graceful _mantillas_, seem to  me a detraction, like bay-windows and porticos added to an old colonial  mansion.          VI    _AROUND THE ISLAND_      A hundred years ago, the Cubans travelled from place to place about the  island, just as our ancestors did in this country, by water and over rough  trails few of which could, with any approach to correctness, be described  as roads. It was not until about a hundred years ago that we, in this  country, began to build anything even remotely resembling a modern highway.  Our towns and cities were on the seaboard or on the banks of rivers  navigable for vessels of size sufficient for their purposes. Commodities  carried to or brought from places not so located were dragged in stoutly  built wagons over routes the best of which was worse than the worst to be  found anywhere today. Because real road-making in Cuba is quite a modern  institution, an enterprise to which, in their phrase, the Spanish  Government did not \"dedicate\" itself, the Cuban wagons and carts of today  are chiefly those of the older time. They are heavy, cumbrous affairs with  large wheels, a diameter necessitated by the deep ruts through which a  passage was made. A smaller wheel would soon have been \"hub-deep\" and  hopelessly stuck. So, too, with the carriages of the nabobs. The poorer  people, when they travelled at all, went on foot or on horseback, as our  ancestors did. The nabobs had their _volantes_, still occasionally, but  with increasing rarity, seen in some parts of the island. Forty years ago,  such vehicles, only a little changed from the original type, were common  enough in Havana itself. About that time, or a few years earlier, the  four-wheeler began to supplant them for city use.    There is a technical difference between the original type of _volante_ and  its successor which, though still called a _volante_ was properly called a  _quitrin_. The only real difference was that the top of the _quitrin_ was  collapsible, and could be lowered when desirable, while the top of  the _volante_ was not. I have ridden in these affairs, I cannot say  comfortably, over roads that would have been quite impossible for any other  wheeled vehicle. At the back, and somewhat behind the body were two wheels,  six feet in diameter. From, the axle, two shafts projected for a distance,  if memory serves me, of some twelve or fifteen feet. A little forward of  the axle, the body, not unlike the old-fashioned American chaise, was  suspended on stout leather straps serving as springs. Away off in front, at  the end of the shafts, was a horse on which the driver rode in a heavy and  clumsy saddle. For long-distance travel, or for particularly rough roads,  a second horse was added, alongside the shaft horse, and sometimes a third  animal. The motion was pleasant enough over the occasional smooth places,  but the usual motion was much like that of a cork in a whirlpool, or of a  small boat in a choppy sea. Little attention was paid to rocks or ruts; it  was almost impossible to capsize the thing. One wheel might be two feet or  more higher than the other, whereupon the rider on the upper side would be  piled on top of the rider or riders on the lower side, but there was always  a fair distribution of this favor. The rocks and ruts were not always on  the same side of the road. The safety from overturn was in the long shafts  which allowed free play. In the older days, say sixty or seventy years  ago, the _volante_ or the _quitrin_ was an outward and visible sign of a  well-lined pocket-book. It indicated the possessor as a man of wealth,  probably a rich planter who needed such a vehicle to carry him and his  family from their mansion in the city to their perhaps quite as costly home  on the plantation. The _calisero_, or driver, was dressed in a costume  truly gorgeous, the horses were of the best, and the vehicle itself  may have cost two thousand dollars or more. The operation of such a  contrivance, "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/1149"],[0,"From London to Land's End (#13)"],[1,"up so high eastward as Portland, and not very often so high as  Lyme.    It was in sight of these hills that Queen Elizabeth's fleet, under the  command of the Lord Howard of Effingham (then Admiral), began first to  engage in a close and resolved fight with the invincible Spanish Armada  in 1588, maintaining the fight, the Spaniards making eastward till they  came the length of Portland Race, where they gave it over--the Spaniards  having received considerable damage, and keeping then closer together.  Off of the same place was a desperate engagement in the year 1672 between  the English and Dutch, in which the Dutch were worsted and driven over to  the coast of France, and then glad to make home to refit and repair.    While we stayed here some time viewing this town and coast, we had  opportunity to observe the pleasant way of conversation as it is managed  among the gentlemen of this county and their families, which are, without  reflection, some of the most polite and well-bred people in the isle of  Britain.  As their hospitality is very great, and their bounty to the  poor remarkable, so their generous friendly way of living with, visiting,  and associating one with another is as hard to be described as it is  really to be admired; they seem to have a mutual confidence in and  friendship with one another, as if they were all relations; nor did I  observe the sharping, tricking temper which is too much crept in among  the gaming and horse-racing gentry in some parts of England to be so much  known among them any otherwise than to be abhorred; and yet they  sometimes play, too, and make matches and horse-races, as they see  occasion.    The ladies here do not want the help of assemblies to assist in  matchmaking, or half-pay officers to run away with their daughters, which  the meetings called assemblies in some other parts of England are  recommended for.  Here is no Bury Fair, where the women are scandalously  said to carry themselves to market, and where every night they meet at  the play or at the assembly for intrigue; and yet I observed that the  women do not seem to stick on hand so much in this country as in those  countries where those assemblies are so lately set up--the reason of  which, I cannot help saying, if my opinion may bear any weight, is that  the Dorsetshire ladies are equal in beauty, and may be superior in  reputation.  In a word, their reputation seems here to be better kept,  guarded by better conduct, and managed with more prudence; and yet the  Dorsetshire ladies, I assure you, are not nuns; they do not go veiled  about streets, or hide themselves when visited; but a general freedom of  conversation--agreeable, mannerly, kind, and good--runs through the whole  body of the gentry of both sexes, mixed with the best of behaviour, and  yet governed by prudence and modesty such as I nowhere see better in all  my observation through the whole isle of Britain.  In this little  interval also I visited some of the biggest towns in the north-west part  of this county, as Blandford--a town on the River Stour in the road  between Salisbury and Dorchester--a handsome well-built town, but chiefly  famous for making the finest bone-lace in England, and where they showed  me some so exquisitely fine as I think I never saw better in Flanders,  France, or Italy, and which they said they rated at above 30 pounds  sterling a yard; but I suppose there was not much of this to be had.  But  it is most certain that they make exceeding rich lace in that county,  such as no part of England can equal.    From thence I went west to Stourbridge, vulgarly called Strabridge.  The  town and the country around is employed in the manufacture of stockings,  and which was once famous for making the finest, best, and highest-prize  knit stocking in England; but that trade now is much decayed by the  increase of the knitting-stocking engine or frame, which has destroyed  the hand-knitting trade for fine stockings through the whole kingdom, of  which I shall speak more in its place.    From hence I came to Sherborne, a large and populous town, with one  collegiate or conventual church, and may properly claim to have more  inhabitants in it than any town in Dorsetshire, though it is neither the  county-town, nor does it send members to Parliament.  The church is still  a reverend pile, and shows the face of great antiquity.  Here begins the  Wiltshire medley clothing (though this town be in Dorsetshire), of which  I shall speak at large in its place, and therefore I omit any discourse  of it here.    Shaftesbury is also on the edge of this county, adjoining to Wiltshire  and Dorsetshire, being fourteen miles from Salisbury, over that fine down  or carpet ground which they call particularly or properly Salisbury  Plain.  It has neither house nor town in view all the way; and the road,  which often lies very broad and branches off insensibly, might easily  cause a traveller to lose his way.  But there is a certain never-failing  assistance upon all these downs for telling a stranger his way, and that  is the number of shepherds feeding or keeping their vast flocks of sheep  which are everywhere in the way, and who with a very little pains a  traveller may always speak with.  Nothing can be like it.  The Arcadians'  plains, of which we read so much pastoral trumpery in the poets, could be  nothing to them.    This Shaftesbury is now a sorry town upon the top of a high hill, which  closes the plain or downs, and whence Nature presents you a new scene or  prospect--viz., of Somerset and Wiltshire--where it is all enclosed, and  grown with woods, forests, and planted hedge-rows; the country rich,  fertile, and populous; the towns and houses standing thick and being  large and full of inhabitants, and those inhabitants fully employed in  the richest and most valuable manufacture in the world--viz., the English  clothing, as well the medley or mixed clothing as whites, as well for the  home trade as the foreign trade, of which I shall take leave to be very  particular in my return through the west and north part of Wiltshire in  the latter part of this work.    In my return to my western progress, I passed some little part of  Somersetshire, as through Evil or Yeovil, upon the River Ivil, in going  to which we go down a long steep hill, which they call Babylon Hill, but  from what original I could find none of the country people to inform me.    This Yeovil is a market-town of good resort; and some clothing is carried  on in and near it, but not much.  Its main manufacture at this time is  making of gloves.    It cannot pass my observation here that when we are come this length from  London the dialect of the English tongue, or the country way of  expressing themselves, is not easily understood--it is so strangely  altered.  It is true that it is so in many parts of England besides, but  in none in so gross a degree as in this part.  This way of boorish  country speech, as in Ireland it is called the \"brogue\" upon the tongue,  so here it is called \"jouring;\" and it is certain that though the tongue  be all mere natural English, yet those that are but a little acquainted  with them cannot understand one-half of what they say.  It is not  possible to explain this fully by writing, because the difference is not  so much in the orthography of words as in the tone and diction--their  abridging the speech, \"cham\" for \"I am,\" \"chil\" for \"I will,\" \"don\" for  \"put on,\" and \"doff\" for \"put off,\" and the like.  And I cannot omit a  short story here on this subject.  Coming to a relation's house, who was  a school-master at Martock, in Somersetshire, I went into his school to  beg the boys a play-day, as is usual in such cases (I should have said,  to beg the master a play-day.  But that by the way).  Coming into the  school, I observed one of the lowest scholars was reading his lesson to  the usher, which lesson, it seems, was a chapter in the Bible.  So I sat  down by the master till the boy had read out his chapter.  I observed the  boy read a little oddly in the tone of the country, which made me the  more attentive, because on inquiry I found that the words were the same  and the orthography the same as in all our Bibles.  I observed also the  boy read it out with his eyes still on the book and his head (like a mere  boy) moving from side to side as the lines reached cross the columns of  the book.  His lesson was in the Canticles, v. 3 of chap. v.  The words  these:--\"I have put off my coat.  How shall I put it on?  I have washed  my feet.  How shall I defile them?\"    The boy read thus, with his eyes, as I say, full on the text:--\"Chav a  doffed my cooat.  How shall I don't?  Chav a washed my veet.  How shall I  moil 'em?\"    How the dexterous dunce could form his month to express so readily the  words (which stood right printed in the book) in his country jargon, I  could not but admire.  I shall add to this another piece as diverting,  which also happened in my knowledge at this very town of Yeovil, though  some years ago.    There lived a good substantial family in the town not far from the \"Angel  Inn\"--a well-known house, which was then, and, I suppose, is still, the  chief inn of the town.  This family had a dog which, among his other good  qualities for which they kept him (for he was a rare house-dog), had this  bad one--that he was a most notorious thief, but withal so cunning a dog,  and managed himself so warily, that he preserved a mighty good reputation  among the neighbourhood.  As the family was well beloved in the town, so  was the dog.  He was known to be a very useful servant to them,  especially in the night (when he was fierce as a lion; but in the day the  gentlest, lovingest creature that could be), and, as they said, all the  neighbours had a good word for this dog.    It happened that the good wife or mistress at the \"Angel Inn\" had  frequently missed several pieces of meat out of the pail, as they"]]]
