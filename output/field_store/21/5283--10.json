Instead, he  proffered nothing, and to contradiction he answered nothing, so that  proves nothing.\"    \"But silence is a proverbial form of assent. At all events, we will  have a look at him.\"    \"But that too will prove nothing, since Thragnar goes about his  mischiefs so disguised by enchantments as invariably to resemble  somebody else, and not himself at all.\"    \"Such dishonest habits introduce an element of uncertainty, I grant  you,\" says Jurgen. \"Still, one can rarely err by keeping on the safe  side. This person is, in any event, a very ill-bred fellow, with  probably immoral intentions. Yes, caution is the main thing, and in  justice to ourselves we will keep on the safe side.\"    So without unloosing the helmet, he struck off the strange knight's  head, and left him thus. The Princess was now mounted on the horse  of their deceased assailant.    \"Assuredly,\" says Jurgen then, \"a magic sword is a fine thing, and a  very necessary equipment, too, for a knight errant of my age.\"    \"But you talk as though you were an old man, Messire de Logreus!\"    \"Come now,\" thinks Jurgen, \"this is a princess of rare  discrimination. What, after all, is forty-and-something when one is  well-preserved? This uncommonly intelligent girl reminds me a little  of Marcoueve, whom I loved in Artein: besides, she does not look at  me as women look at an elderly man. I like this princess, in fact, I  adore this princess. I wonder now what would she say if I told her  as much?\"    But Jurgen did not tempt chance that time, for just then they  encountered a boy who had frizzed hair and painted cheeks. He walked  mincingly, in a curious garb of black bespangled with gold lozenges,  and he carried a gilded dung fork.           *       *       *       *       *    Then Jurgen and the Princess came to a black and silver pavilion  standing by the roadside. At the door of the pavilion was an  apple-tree in blossom: from a branch of this tree was suspended  a black hunting-horn, silver-mounted. A woman waited there alone.  Before her was a chess-board, with the ebony and silver pieces set  ready for a game, and upon the table to her left hand glittered  flagons and goblets of silver. Eagerly this woman rose and came  toward the travellers.    \"Oh, my dear Jurgen,\" says she, \"but how fine you look in that new  shirt you are wearing! But there was never a man had better taste in  dress, as I have always said: and it is long I have waited for you  in this pavilion, which belongs to a black gentleman who seems to be  a great friend of yours. And he went into Crim Tartary this morning,  with some missionaries, by the worst piece of luck, for I know how  sorry he will be to miss you, dear. Now, but I am forgetting that  you must be very tired and thirsty, my darling, after your travels.  So do you and the young lady have a sip of this, and then we will be  telling one another of our adventures.\"    For this woman had the appearance of Jurgen's wife, Dame Lisa, and  of none other.    Jurgen regarded her with two minds. \"You certainly seem to be Lisa.  But it is a long while since I saw Lisa in such an amiable mood.\"    \"You must know,\" says she, still smiling, \"that I have learned to  appreciate you since we were separated.\"    \"The fiend who stole you from me may possibly have brought about  that wonder. None the less, you have met me riding at adventure with  a young woman. And you have assaulted neither of us, you have not  even raised your voice. No, quite decidedly, here is a miracle  beyond the power of any fiend.\"    \"Ah, but I have been doing a great deal of thinking, Jurgen dear, as  to our difficulties in the past. And it seems to me that you were  almost always in the right.\"    Guenevere nudged Jurgen. \"Did you note that? This is certainly  Thragnar in disguise.\"    \"I am beginning to think that at all events it is not Lisa.\" Then  Jurgen magisterially cleared his throat. \"Lisa, if you indeed be  Lisa, you must understand I am through with you. The plain truth is  that you tire me. You talk and talk: no woman breathing equals you  at mere volume and continuity of speech: but you say nothing that I  have not heard seven hundred and eighty times if not oftener.\"    \"You are perfectly right, my dear,\" says Dame Lisa, piteously. \"But  then I never pretended to be as clever as you.\"    \"Spare me your beguilements, if you please. And besides, I am in  love with this princess. Now spare me your recriminations, also, for  you have no real right to complain. If you had stayed the person  whom I promised the priest to love, I would have continued to think  the world of you. But you did nothing of the sort. From a cuddlesome  and merry girl, who thought whatever I did was done to perfection,  you elected to develop into an uncommonly plain and short-tempered  old woman.\" And Jurgen paused. \"Eh?\" said he, \"and did you not do  this?\"    Dame Lisa answered sadly: \"My dear, you are perfectly right, from  your way of thinking. However, I could not very well help getting  older.\"    \"But, oh, dear me!\" says Jurgen, \"this is astonishingly inadequate  impersonation, as any married man would see at once. Well, I made no  contract to love any such plain and short-tempered person. I  repudiate the claims of any such person, as manifestly unfair. And I  pledge undying affection to this high and noble Princess Guenevere,  who is the fairest lady that I have ever seen.\"    \"You are right,\" wailed Dame Lisa, \"and I was entirely to blame. It  was because I loved you, and wanted you to get on in the world and  be a credit to my father's line of business, that I nagged you so.  But you will never understand the feelings of a wife, nor will you  understand that even now I desire your happiness above all else.  Here is our wedding-ring, then, Jurgen. I give you back your  freedom. And I pray that this princess may make you very happy, my  dear. For surely you deserve a princess if ever any man did.\"    Jurgen shook his head. \"It is astounding that a demon so much talked  about should be so poor an impersonator. It raises the staggering  supposition that the majority of married women must go to Heaven. As  for your ring, I am not accepting gifts this morning, from anyone.  But you understand, I trust, that I am hopelessly enamored of the  Princess on account of her beauty.\"    \"Oh, and I cannot blame you, my dear. She is the loveliest person I  have ever seen.\"    \"Hah, Thragnar!\" says Jurgen, \"I have you now. A woman might, just  possibly, have granted her own homeliness: but no woman that ever  breathed would have conceded the Princess had a ray of good looks.\"    So with Caliburn he smote, and struck off the head of this thing  which foolishly pretended to be Dame Lisa.    \"Well done! oh, bravely done!\" cried Guenevere. \"Now the enchantment  is dissolved, and Thragnar is slain by my clever champion.\"    \"I could wish there were some surer sign of that,\" said Jurgen. \"I  would have preferred that the pavilion and the decapitated Troll  King had vanished with a peal of thunder and an earthquake and such  other phenomena as are customary. Instead, nothing is changed except  that the woman who was talking to me a moment since now lies at my  feet in a very untidy condition. You conceive, madame, I used to  tease her about that twisted little-finger, in the days before we  began to squabble: and it annoys me that Thragnar should not have  omitted even Lisa's crooked little-finger on her left hand. Yes,  such painstaking carefulness worries me. For you conceive also,  madame, it would be more or less awkward if I had made an error, and  if the appearance were in reality what it seemed to be, because I  was pretty trying sometimes. At all events, I have done that which  seemed equitable, and I have found no comfort in the doing of it,  and I do not like this place.\"          11.    Appearance of the Duke of Logreus      So Jurgen brushed from the table the chessmen that were set there in  readiness for a game, and he emptied the silver flagons upon the  ground. His reasons for not meddling with the horn he explained to  the Princess: she shivered, and said that, such being the case, he  was certainly very sensible. Then they mounted, and departed from  the black and silver pavilion. They came thus without further  adventure to Gogyrvan Gawr's city of Cameliard.    Now there was shouting and the bells all rang when the people knew  their Princess was returned to them: the houses were hung with  painted cloths and banners, and trumpets sounded, as Guenevere and  Jurgen came to the King in his Hall of Judgment. And this Gogyrvan,  that was King of Glathion and Lord of Enisgarth and Camwy and  Sargyll, came down from his wide throne, and he embraced first  Guenevere, then Jurgen.    \"And demand of me what you will, Duke of Logreus,\" said Gogyrvan,  when he had heard the champion's name, \"and it is yours for the  asking. For you have restored to me the best loved daughter that  ever was the pride of a high king.\"    \"Sir,\" replied Jurgen, reasonably, \"a service rendered so gladly  should be its own reward. So I am asking that you do in turn restore  to me the Princess Guenevere, in honorable marriage, do you  understand, because I am a poor lorn widower, I am tolerably  certain, but I am quite certain I love your daughter with my whole  heart.\"    Thus Jurgen, whose periods"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/8789"],[0,"The vision of hell. (#12)"],[1,"  So here, from heel to point, glided the flames.    \"Master! say who is he, than all the rest  Glancing in fiercer agony, on whom  A ruddier flame doth prey?\"  I thus inquir'd.    \"If thou be willing,\" he replied, \"that I  Carry thee down, where least the slope bank falls,  He of himself shall tell thee and his wrongs.\"    I then: \"As pleases thee to me is best.  Thou art my lord; and know'st that ne'er I quit  Thy will: what silence hides that knowest thou.\"  Thereat on the fourth pier we came, we turn'd,  And on our left descended to the depth,  A narrow strait and perforated close.  Nor from his side my leader set me down,  Till to his orifice he brought, whose limb  Quiv'ring express'd his pang.  \"Whoe'er thou art,  Sad spirit! thus revers'd, and as a stake  Driv'n in the soil!\"  I in these words began,  \"If thou be able, utter forth thy voice.\"    There stood I like the friar, that doth shrive  A wretch for murder doom'd, who e'en when fix'd,  Calleth him back, whence death awhile delays.    He shouted: \"Ha! already standest there?  Already standest there, O Boniface!  By many a year the writing play'd me false.  So early dost thou surfeit with the wealth,  For which thou fearedst not in guile to take  The lovely lady, and then mangle her?\"    I felt as those who, piercing not the drift  Of answer made them, stand as if expos'd  In mockery, nor know what to reply,  When Virgil thus admonish'd: \"Tell him quick,  I am not he, not he, whom thou believ'st.\"    And I, as was enjoin'd me, straight replied.    That heard, the spirit all did wrench his feet,  And sighing next in woeful accent spake:  \"What then of me requirest?  If to know  So much imports thee, who I am, that thou  Hast therefore down the bank descended, learn  That in the mighty mantle I was rob'd,  And of a she-bear was indeed the son,  So eager to advance my whelps, that there  My having in my purse above I stow'd,  And here myself.  Under my head are dragg'd  The rest, my predecessors in the guilt  Of simony.  Stretch'd at their length they lie  Along an opening in the rock.  'Midst them  I also low shall fall, soon as he comes,  For whom I took thee, when so hastily  I question'd.  But already longer time  Hath pass'd, since my souls kindled, and I thus  Upturn'd have stood, than is his doom to stand  Planted with fiery feet.  For after him,  One yet of deeds more ugly shall arrive,  From forth the west, a shepherd without law,  Fated to cover both his form and mine.  He a new Jason shall be call'd, of whom  In Maccabees we read; and favour such  As to that priest his king indulgent show'd,  Shall be of France's monarch shown to him.\"    I know not if I here too far presum'd,  But in this strain I answer'd: \"Tell me now,  What treasures from St. Peter at the first  Our Lord demanded, when he put the keys  Into his charge?  Surely he ask'd no more  But, Follow me!  Nor Peter nor the rest  Or gold or silver of Matthias took,  When lots were cast upon the forfeit place  Of the condemned soul.  Abide thou then;  Thy punishment of right is merited:  And look thou well to that ill-gotten coin,  Which against Charles thy hardihood inspir'd.  If reverence of the keys restrain'd me not,  Which thou in happier time didst hold, I yet  Severer speech might use.  Your avarice  O'ercasts the world with mourning, under foot  Treading the good, and raising bad men up.  Of shepherds, like to you, th' Evangelist  Was ware, when her, who sits upon the waves,  With kings in filthy whoredom he beheld,  She who with seven heads tower'd at her birth,  And from ten horns her proof of glory drew,  Long as her spouse in virtue took delight.  Of gold and silver ye have made your god,  Diff'ring wherein from the idolater,  But he that worships one, a hundred ye?  Ah, Constantine! to how much ill gave birth,  Not thy conversion, but that plenteous dower,  Which the first wealthy Father gain'd from thee!\"    Meanwhile, as thus I sung, he, whether wrath  Or conscience smote him, violent upsprang  Spinning on either sole.  I do believe  My teacher well was pleas'd, with so compos'd  A lip, he listen'd ever to the sound  Of the true words I utter'd.  In both arms  He caught, and to his bosom lifting me  Upward retrac'd the way of his descent.    Nor weary of his weight he press'd me close,  Till to the summit of the rock we came,  Our passage from the fourth to the fifth pier.  His cherish'd burden there gently he plac'd  Upon the rugged rock and steep, a path  Not easy for the clamb'ring goat to mount.    Thence to my view another vale appear'd          CANTO XX    AND now the verse proceeds to torments new,  Fit argument of this the twentieth strain  Of the first song, whose awful theme records  The spirits whelm'd in woe.  Earnest I look'd  Into the depth, that open'd to my view,  Moisten'd with tears of anguish, and beheld  A tribe, that came along the hollow vale,  In silence weeping: such their step as walk  Quires chanting solemn litanies on earth.    As on them more direct mine eye descends,  Each wondrously seem'd to be revers'd  At the neck-bone, so that the countenance  Was from the reins averted: and because  None might before him look, they were compell'd  To' advance with backward gait.  Thus one perhaps  Hath been by force of palsy clean transpos'd,  But I ne'er saw it nor believe it so.    Now, reader! think within thyself, so God  Fruit of thy reading give thee! how I long  Could keep my visage dry, when I beheld  Near me our form distorted in such guise,  That on the hinder parts fall'n from the face  The tears down-streaming roll'd.  Against a rock  I leant and wept, so that my guide exclaim'd:  \"What, and art thou too witless as the rest?  Here pity most doth show herself alive,  When she is dead.  What guilt exceedeth his,  Who with Heaven's judgment in his passion strives?  Raise up thy head, raise up, and see the man,  Before whose eyes earth gap'd in Thebes, when all  Cried out, 'Amphiaraus, whither rushest?  'Why leavest thou the war?'  He not the less  Fell ruining far as to Minos down,  Whose grapple none eludes.  Lo! how he makes  The breast his shoulders, and who once too far  Before him wish'd to see, now backward looks,  And treads reverse his path.  Tiresias note,  Who semblance chang'd, when woman he became  Of male, through every limb transform'd, and then  Once more behov'd him with his rod to strike  The two entwining serpents, ere the plumes,  That mark'd the better sex, might shoot again.    \"Aruns, with more his belly facing, comes.  On Luni's mountains 'midst the marbles white,  Where delves Carrara's hind, who wons beneath,  A cavern was his dwelling, whence the stars  And main-sea wide in boundless view he held.    \"The next, whose loosen'd tresses overspread  Her bosom, which thou seest not (for each hair  On that side grows) was Manto, she who search'd  Through many regions, and at length her seat  Fix'd in my native land, whence a short space  My words detain thy audience.  When her sire  From life departed, and in servitude  The city dedicate to Bacchus mourn'd,  Long time she went a wand'rer through the world.  Aloft in Italy's delightful land  A lake there lies, at foot of that proud Alp,  That o'er the Tyrol locks Germania in,  Its name Benacus, which a thousand rills,  Methinks, and more, water between the vale  Camonica and Garda and the height  Of Apennine remote.  There is a spot  At midway of that lake, where he who bears  Of Trento's flock the past'ral staff, with him  Of Brescia, and the Veronese, might each  Passing that way his benediction give.  A garrison of goodly site and strong  Peschiera stands, to awe with front oppos'd  The Bergamese and Brescian, whence the shore  More slope each way descends.  There, whatsoev'er  Benacus' bosom holds not, tumbling o'er  Down falls, and winds a river flood beneath  Through the green pastures.  Soon as in his course  The steam makes head, Benacus then no more  They call the name, but Mincius, till at last  Reaching Governo into Po he falls.  Not far his course hath run, when a wide flat  It finds, which overstretchmg as a marsh  It covers, pestilent in summer oft.  Hence journeying, the savage maiden saw  'Midst of the fen a territory waste  And naked of inhabitants.  To shun  All human converse, here she with her slaves  Plying her arts remain'd, and liv'd, and left  Her body tenantless.  Thenceforth the tribes,  Who round were scatter'd, gath'ring to that place  Assembled; for its strength was great, enclos'd  On all parts by the fen.  On those dead bones  They rear'd themselves a city, for her sake,  Calling it Mantua, who first chose the spot,  Nor ask'd another omen for the name,  Wherein more numerous the people dwelt,  Ere Casalodi's madness by deceit  Was wrong'd of Pinamonte.  If thou hear  Henceforth another origin assign'd  Of that my country, I forewarn thee now,  That falsehood none beguile thee of the truth.\"    I answer'd: \"Teacher, I conclude thy words  So certain, that all else shall be to me  As embers lacking life.  But now of these,  Who here proceed, instruct me, if thou see  Any that merit more especial note.  For thereon is my mind alone intent.\"    He straight replied: \"That spirit, from whose cheek  The beard sweeps o'er his shoulders brown, what time  Graecia was emptied of her males, that scarce  The cradles were supplied, the seer was he  In Aulis, who with Calchas gave the sign  When first to cut the cable.  Him they nam'd  Eurypilus: so sings my tragic strain,  In which majestic measure well thou know'st,  Who know'st it all.
