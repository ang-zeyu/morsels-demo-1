He pulled off a little vase of wine that hung from his girdle and passed  it to Menon, saying:    \"I should be proud if the father of the victor would drink from my  bottle.\"    And Menon took it, smiling proudly. Then he himself opened a little  cloth bag and drew out figs and nuts.    \"Here is something to munch, lad,\" he said to Charmides.    Other people, also, were eating and drinking. They walked about to visit  their friends or sat down to rest. Menon's neighbor sank upon his seat  with a sigh.    \"This is the first time I have sat down since sunrise,\" he laughed.    Then the pentathlon was announced. Everyone leaped to his feet again. A  group of boys stood ready behind a line. One of the judges was softening  the ground with a pick. An umpire made a speech to the lads. Then, at a  word, a boy took up the lead jumping weights. He swung his hands back  and forth, swaying his graceful body with them. Then a backward jerk! He  threw his weights behind him and leaped. The judges quickly measured  and called the distance. Then another boy leaped, and another, and  another--twenty or more. Last Creon took the weights and toed the line.    \"Creon! Creon!\" shouted the crowd: \"The victor! Creon again!\"    He swung and swayed and then sailed through the air.    \"By Herakles!\" shouted a man near Charmides. \"He alights like a  sea-gull.\"    There went up a great roar from the benches even before the judges  called the distance. For any one could see that he had passed the  farthest mark. The first of the five games was over and Creon had won  it.    Now the judges brought a discus. A boy took it and stepped behind the  line. He fitted the lead plate into the crook of his hand. He swung it  back and forth, bending his knees and turning his body. Then it flew  into the air and down the course. Where it stopped rolling an umpire  marked and called the distance.    \"I like this game best of all,\" said a man behind Charmides. \"The whole  body is in it. Every movement is graceful. See the curve of the back,  the beautiful bend of the legs, the muscles working over the chest! The  body moves to and fro as if to music.\"    One after another the boys took their turn. But when Creon threw,  Charmides cried out in sorrow, and Menon groaned. His disc fell short of  the mark. He was third.    \"It was gracefully done,\" Charmides heard some one say, \"but his arms  are not so good as his legs. See the arms and chest of that Timon. No  one can throw against him.\"    After that a judge set up a shield in the middle of the course. Every  boy snatched a spear from a pile on the ground and threw at the central  boss of the shield. Again Creon was beaten. Phormio of Corinth, son of a  famous warrior, won.    Then they paired off for wrestling. Creon and Eudorus of Aegina were  together. Each boy poured oil into his hand from a little vase and  rubbed the body of his antagonist to limber his muscles. Then he took  fine sand from a box and dusted it over his skin for the oiled body  might slip out of his arms in the wrestling match. Then, at a signal,  the pairs of wrestlers faced each other.    Creon held his hands out ready, bent his knees, thrust forward his head,  and stood waiting. Eudorus leaped to and fro around him trying to get a  hold. At last he rushed at him. Creon caught him around the waist and  hurled him to the ground. Charmides laughed and shouted and clapped  his hands. That was one throw. There must be three. Eudorus was up  immediately and was circling around and around again. Suddenly Creon  leaped low and caught him by the leg and threw him. He had won two bouts  out of three and stood victor without a throw.    Soon all the pairs had finished. The eight victors stood forth and cast  lots for new partners. Again they wrestled. This time, also, Creon won.  Then these four winners paired off and wrestled, and at the end Creon  and Timon were left to try it together.    In the first bout the Spartan boy lifted Creon off the ground and threw  him, back down. Then the men on the benches began shouting advice.    \"Look out for his arms!\"    \"Don't let him grapple you!\"    \"Feint, feint!\"    Creon leaped to his feet. He began circling around Timon as Eudorus had  circled around him. He dodged out from under Timon's arms. He wriggled  from between his hands. The benches rang with cheers and laughs.    \"He is an eel,\" cried one man.    Suddenly Creon ducked under Timon's arms, caught him by his legs and  tripped him. The two boys were even.    In the next bout Timon ran at Creon like a wild bull. He caught him  around the waist in his strong arms to whirl him to the ground. But with  a crook of his leg Creon tripped him and wriggled out of his arms before  he fell.    Menon caught up Charmides and threw him to his shoulder laughing and  stamping his feet.    \"Do you see, lad?\" he cried. \"He has won two games. Only the race is  left, and we know how he can run.\"    And how he did run! He threw back his head and leaped out like a deer,  skimming over the ground in long strides and leaving his dust to the  others. He had the three games out of five and was winner of the  pentathlon.    Then there was no holding the crowd. They poured down off the seats and  ran to Creon. Some lifted him upon their shoulders and carried him out  of the stadion, for this was the end of the games for that day. And  those who could not come near Creon and his waving palms crowded around  Menon. So they went, shouting, out of the gate and among the statues and  on to the river. There they put Creon down, and his father and Charmides  led him away to camp.    That was the happiest night of Charmides' life. He heard his wonderful  brother talk for hours of the life in the gymnasium. He heard new tales  of Creon's favorite god, Hermes. He heard of the women's games that were  held once a year at Olympia in honor of Hera. He heard a hundred new  names of boys and cities, for there had been, athletes from every corner  of Greece in training here. He held the victor's palms in his own hands.  He slept beside this double winner of Olympic crowns. He dreamed that  Apollo and Hermes came hand in hand and gazed down at him and Creon as  they lay sleeping and dropped a great garland over them both. It was  twined of Olympic olive leaves and Apollo's own laurel.    On the next day there were games for the men, like those the boys had  played. On the day after that there were chariot races in a wide place  outside the walls. Every night there was still the gay noise of the  fair. But instead of going to see it, Charmides stretched himself under  the trees on Mount Kronion and gazed up at the moon and dreamed.    Then came the last day, with its great procession again and its  sacrifices at every altar. The proud victors walked with their palm  leaves in their hands. In the temple of Zeus, under the eyes of the  glowing god, the priests put the precious olive crowns upon the winners'  heads. They were made from sacred olive leaves. They were cut with a  golden sickle from the very tree that godlike Herakles had brought out  of the far north. That wreath it was which should be more dear than a  chest of gold to Creon's family and Creon's city. That was the crown  which poets should sing about. When the priest set the crown upon  Creon's head, Charmides thought he felt a god's hands upon his own brow.  Menon leaned upon a friend's shoulder and burst into tears.    \"I could die happy now,\" he said. \"I have done enough for Athens in  giving her such a glorious son.\"    As the three walked back to camp, Menon said:    \"Who shall write your chorus of triumph, Creon? Already my messengers  have reached Athens, and the dancers are chosen who shall lead you home.  But the song is not yet made. It must be a glorious one!\"    Then Charmides blushingly whispered,    \"May I sing you something, father? Apollo helped me to make it.\"    His father smiled down in surprise. \"So that is why you have been lying  so quiet under the trees these moonlit nights!\" he said.    Charmides ran ahead and was sitting thrumming a lyre when his father  and Creon came up. He struck a long, ringing chord and raised his clear  voice in a dancing song:      When Creon, son of Menon, bore off the Olympic olive,    Mount Kronion shook with shouting of Hellas' hosts assembled.    They praised his manly beauty, his grace and strength of body.    They praised his eyes' alertness, the smoothness of his muscles.    They blessed his happy father and wished themselves his brothers.    Sweet rang the glorious praises in ears of Creon's lovers.    But I, when upward gazing, beheld a sight more wondrous.    The gates of high Olympos were open wide and clanging,    Deserted ev'ry palace, the golden city empty.    And all the gods were gathered above Olympia's race-course,    They smiled upon my Creon and gifts upon him showered.    From golden Aphrodite dropped half a hundred graces.    Athene made him skillful. Boon Hermes gave him litheness.    Fierce Ares added courage, Queen Hera happy marriage.    Diana's blessed fingers into his soul shed quiet.    Lord Bacchus gave him friendship and graces of the banquet,    Poseidon luck in travel, and Zeus decreed him victor.    Apollo, smiling, watched him and saw his thousand blessings.    \"Enough,\" he said, \"for Creon. I'll bless the empty-handed.\"    He turned to where I trembled, and stepping downward crowned me.    \"To thee my gift,\" he whispered, \"to sing thy brother's glory.\"    \"Well done, little poet!\" cried Menon.    \"A happy man am I. One son is beloved by Hermes, the other by Apollo.  Bring wax tablets, Glaucon, and write down the song. I will prepare a  messenger to hurry with it to Athens.\"    So it happened that a lame boy won a crown. And when Creon stepped  ashore at Pirseus, and all Athens stood shouting his name, a chorus of  boys came dancing toward him singing his "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/9629"],[0,"Ghost Stories of an Antiquary Part 2: More Ghost Stories (#12)"],[1,"before, though not immediately before, the catastrophe.  There were several things; the principal notion he had was that he  thought he was being followed. No doubt he was an impressionable man, but  he never had had such fancies as this before. I cannot get it out of my  mind that there was ill-will at work, and what you tell me about yourself  reminds me very much of my brother. Can you think of any possible  connecting link?'    'There is just one that has been taking shape vaguely in my mind. I've  been told that your brother reviewed a book very severely not long before  he died, and just lately I have happened to cross the path of the man who  wrote that book in a way he would resent.'    'Don't tell me the man was called Karswell.'    'Why not? that is exactly his name.'    Henry Harrington leant back. 'That is final to my mind. Now I must  explain further. From something he said, I feel sure that my brother John  was beginning to believe--very much against his will--that Karswell was  at the bottom of his trouble. I want to tell you what seems to me to have  a bearing on the situation. My brother was a great musician, and used to  run up to concerts in town. He came back, three months before he died,  from one of these, and gave me his programme to look at--an analytical  programme: he always kept them. \"I nearly missed this one,\" he said. \"I  suppose I must have dropped it: anyhow, I was looking for it under my  seat and in my pockets and so on, and my neighbour offered me his; said  'might he give it me, he had no further use for it,' and he went away  just afterwards. I don't know who he was--a stout, clean-shaven man. I  should have been sorry to miss it; of course I could have bought another,  but this cost me nothing.\" At another time he told me that he had been  very uncomfortable both on the way to his hotel and during the night. I  piece things together now in thinking it over. Then, not very long after,  he was going over these programmes, putting them in order to have them  bound up, and in this particular one (which by the way I had hardly  glanced at), he found quite near the beginning a strip of paper with some  very odd writing on it in red and black--most carefully done--it looked  to me more like Runic letters than anything else. \"Why,\" he said, \"this  must belong to my fat neighbour. It looks as if it might be worth  returning to him; it may be a copy of something; evidently someone has  taken trouble over it. How can I find his address?\" We talked it over for  a little and agreed that it wasn't worth advertising about, and that my  brother had better look out for the man at the next concert, to which he  was going very soon. The paper was lying on the book and we were both by  the fire; it was a cold, windy summer evening. I suppose the door blew  open, though I didn't notice it: at any rate a gust--a warm gust it  was--came quite suddenly between us, took the paper and blew it straight  into the fire: it was light, thin paper, and flared and went up the  chimney in a single ash. \"Well,\" I said, \"you can't give it back now.\" He  said nothing for a minute: then rather crossly, \"No, I can't; but why you  should keep on saying so I don't know.\" I remarked that I didn't say it  more than once. \"Not more than four times, you mean,\" was all he said. I  remember all that very clearly, without any good reason; and now to come  to the point. I don't know if you looked at that book of Karswell's which  my unfortunate brother reviewed. It's not likely that you should: but I  did, both before his death and after it. The first time we made game of  it together. It was written in no style at all--split infinitives, and  every sort of thing that makes an Oxford gorge rise. Then there was  nothing that the man didn't swallow: mixing up classical myths, and  stories out of the _Golden Legend_ with reports of savage customs of  today--all very proper, no doubt, if you know how to use them, but he  didn't: he seemed to put the _Golden Legend_ and the _Golden Bough_  exactly on a par, and to believe both: a pitiable exhibition, in short.  Well, after the misfortune, I looked over the book again. It was no  better than before, but the impression which it left this time on my mind  was different. I suspected--as I told you--that Karswell had borne  ill-will to my brother, even that he was in some way responsible for what  had happened; and now his book seemed to me to be a very sinister  performance indeed. One chapter in particular struck me, in which he  spoke of \"casting the Runes\" on people, either for the purpose of gaining  their affection or of getting them out of the way--perhaps more  especially the latter: he spoke of all this in a way that really seemed  to me to imply actual knowledge. I've not time to go into details, but  the upshot is that I am pretty sure from information received that the  civil man at the concert was Karswell: I suspect--I more than  suspect--that the paper was of importance: and I do believe that if my  brother had been able to give it back, he might have been alive now.  Therefore, it occurs to me to ask you whether you have anything to put  beside what I have told you.'    By way of answer, Dunning had the episode in the Manuscript Room at the  British Museum to relate. 'Then he did actually hand you some papers;  have you examined them? No? because we must, if you'll allow it, look at  them at once, and very carefully.'    They went to the still empty house--empty, for the two servants were not  yet able to return to work. Dunning's portfolio of papers was gathering  dust on the writing-table. In it were the quires of small-sized  scribbling paper which he used for his transcripts: and from one of  these, as he took it up, there slipped and fluttered out into the room  with uncanny quickness, a strip of thin light paper. The window was open,  but Harrington slammed it to, just in time to intercept the paper, which  he caught. 'I thought so,' he said; 'it might be the identical thing that  was given to my brother. You'll have to look out, Dunning; this may mean  something quite serious for you.'    A long consultation took place. The paper was narrowly examined. As  Harrington had said, the characters on it were more like Runes than  anything else, but not decipherable by either man, and both hesitated to  copy them, for fear, as they confessed, of perpetuating whatever evil  purpose they might conceal. So it has remained impossible (if I may  anticipate a little) to ascertain what was conveyed in this curious  message or commission. Both Dunning and Harrington are firmly convinced  that it had the effect of bringing its possessors into very undesirable  company. That it must be returned to the source whence it came they were  agreed, and further, that the only safe and certain way was that of  personal service; and here contrivance would be necessary, for Dunning  was known by sight to Karswell. He must, for one thing, alter his  appearance by shaving his beard. But then might not the blow fall first?  Harrington thought they could time it. He knew the date of the concert at  which the 'black spot' had been put on his brother: it was June 18th. The  death had followed on Sept. 18th. Dunning reminded him that three months  had been mentioned on the inscription on the car-window. 'Perhaps,' he  added, with a cheerless laugh, 'mine may be a bill at three months too. I  believe I can fix it by my diary. Yes, April 23rd was the day at the  Museum; that brings us to July 23rd. Now, you know, it becomes extremely  important to me to know anything you will tell me about the progress of  your brother's trouble, if it is possible for you to speak of it.' 'Of  course. Well, the sense of being watched whenever he was alone was the  most distressing thing to him. After a time I took to sleeping in his  room, and he was the better for that: still, he talked a great deal in  his sleep. What about? Is it wise to dwell on that, at least before  things are straightened out? I think not, but I can tell you this: two  things came for him by post during those weeks, both with a London  postmark, and addressed in a commercial hand. One was a woodcut of  Bewick's, roughly torn out of the page: one which shows a moonlit road  and a man walking along it, followed by an awful demon creature. Under it  were written the lines out of the \"Ancient Mariner\" (which I suppose the  cut illustrates) about one who, having once looked round--                      walks on,    And turns no more his head,    Because he knows a frightful fiend    Doth close behind him tread.    The other was a calendar, such as tradesmen often send. My brother paid  no attention to this, but I looked at it after his death, and found that  everything after Sept. 18 had been torn out. You may be surprised at his  having gone out alone the evening he was killed, but the fact is that  during the last ten days or so of his life he had been quite free from  the sense of being followed or watched.'    The end of the consultation was this. Harrington, who knew a neighbour of  Karswell's, thought he saw a way of keeping a watch on his movements. It  would be Dunning's part to be in readiness to try to cross Karswell's  path at any moment, to keep the paper safe and in a place of ready  access.    They parted. The next weeks were no doubt a severe strain upon Dunning's  nerves: the intangible barrier which had seemed to rise about him on the  day when he received the paper, gradually developed into a brooding  blackness that cut him off from the means of escape to which one might  have thought he might resort. No one was at hand who was likely to  suggest them to him, and he seemed robbed of all initiative. He waited  with inexpressible anxiety as May, June, and early July passed on, for a  mandate from Harrington. But all this time Karswell remained immovable at  Lufford.    At last, in less than a week before the date he had "]]]
