No captures were made after the general  surrender, and no further seizures of \"abandoned\" property were made  after Johnson's amnesty proclamation of May 29, 1865. This left only the  \"confiscable\" property to be collected and sold.    For collection purposes the states of the South were divided into  districts, each under the supervision of an agent of the Treasury  Department, who received a commission of about 25 percent. Cotton,  regarded as the root of the slavery evil, was singled out as the  principal object of confiscation. It was known that the Confederate  Government had owned in 1865 about 150,000 bales, but the records were  defective and much of it, with no clear indication of ownership, still  remained with the producers. Secretary Chase, foreseeing the difficulty  of effecting a just settlement, counseled against seizure, but his  judgment was overruled. Secretary McCulloch said of his agents: \"I am  sure I sent some honest cotton agents South; but it sometimes seems  doubtful whether any of them remained honest very long.\" Some of  the natives, even, became cotton thieves. In a report made in 1866,  McCulloch describes their methods: \"Contractors, anxious for gain,  were sometimes guilty of bad faith and peculation, and frequently took  possession of cotton and delivered it under contracts as captured or  abandoned, when in fact it was not such, and they had no right to touch  it.... Residents and others in the districts where these peculations  were going on took advantage of the unsettled condition of the country,  and representing themselves as agents of this department, went  about robbing under such pretended authority, and thus added to the  difficulties of the situation by causing unjust opprobrium and suspicion  to rest upon officers engaged in the faithful discharge of their duties.  Agents,... frequently received or collected property, and sent it  forward which the law did not authorize them to take.... Lawless men,  singly and in organized bands, engaged in general plunder; every species  of intrigue and peculation and theft were resorted to.\"    These agents turned over to the United States about $34,000,000. About  40,000 claimants were subsequently indemnified on the ground that the  property taken from them did not belong to the Confederate Government,  but many thousands of other claimants have been unable to prove that  their property was seized by government agents and hence have received  nothing. It is probable that the actual Confederate property was nearly  all stolen by the agents. One agent in Alabama sold an appointment as  assistant for $25,000, and a few months later both the assistant and the  agent were tried by a military court for stealing and were fined $90,000  and $250,000 respectively in addition to being imprisoned.    Other property, including horses, mules, wagons, tobacco, rice, and  sugar which the natives claimed as their own, was seized. In some places  the agents even collected delinquent Confederate taxes. Much of the  confiscable property was not sold but was turned over to the  Freedmen's Bureau* for its support. The total amount seized cannot be  satisfactorily ascertained. The Ku Klux minority report asserted  that 3,000,000 bales of cotton were taken, of which the United States  received only 114,000. It is certain that, owing to the deliberate  destruction of cotton by fire in 1864-65, this estimate was too  high, but all the testimony points to the fact that the frauds were  stupendous. As a result the United States Government did not succeed  in obtaining the Confederate property to which it had a claim, and the  country itself was stripped of necessities to a degree that left it  not only destitute but outraged and embittered. \"Such practices,\" said  Trowbridge, \"had a pernicious effect, engendering a contempt for the  Government and a murderous ill will which too commonly vented itself  upon soldiers and Negroes.\"         * See pp. 89 et seq.    The South faced the work of reconstruction not only with a shortage of  material and greatly hampered in the employment even of that but still  more with a shortage of men. The losses among the whites are usually  estimated at about half the military population, but since accurate  records are lacking, the exact numbers cannot be ascertained. The best  of the civil leaders, as well as the prominent military leaders, had so  committed themselves to the support of the Confederacy as to be excluded  from participation in any reconstruction that might be attempted.  The business of reconstruction, therefore, fell of necessity to the  Confederate private soldiers, the lower officers, nonparticipants, and  lukewarm individuals who had not greatly compromised themselves. These  politically and physically uninjured survivors included also all the  \"slackers\" of the Confederacy. But though there were such physical and  moral losses on the part of those to whom fell the direction of affairs,  there was also a moral strengthening in the sound element of the people  who had been tried by the discipline of war.    The greatest weakness of both races was their extreme poverty. The crops  of 1865 turned out badly, for most of the soldiers reached home too late  for successful planting, and the Negro labor was not dependable. The  sale of such cotton and farm products as had escaped the treasury agents  was of some help, but curiously enough much of the good money thus  obtained was spent extravagantly by a people used to Confederate rag  money and for four years deprived of the luxuries of life. The poorer  whites who had lost all were close to starvation. In the white counties  which had sent so large a proportion of men to the army, the destitution  was most acute. In many families the breadwinner had been killed in  war. After 1862, relief systems had been organized in nearly all the  Confederate States for the purpose of aiding the poor whites, but these  organizations were disbanded in 1865. A Freedmen's Bureau official  traveling through the desolate back country furnishes a description  which might have applied to two hundred counties, a third of the South:  \"It is a common, an every-day sight in Randolph County, that of women  and children, most of whom were formerly in good circumstances, begging  for bread from door to door. Meat of any kind has been a stranger to  many of their mouths for months. The drought cut off what little crops  they hoped to save, and they must have immediate help or perish. By far  the greater suffering exists among the whites. Their scanty supplies  have been exhausted, and now they look to the Government alone for  support. Some are without homes of any description.\"    Where the armies had passed, few of the people, white or black,  remained; most of them had been forced as \"refugees\" within the Union  lines or into the interior of the Confederacy. Now, along with the  disbanded Confederate soldiers, they came straggling back to their  war-swept homes. It was estimated, in December 1865, that in the states  of Alabama, Mississippi, and Georgia, there were five hundred thousand  white people who were without the necessaries of life; numbers died from  lack of food. Within a few months, relief agencies were at work. In  the North, especially in the border states and in New York, charitable  organizations collected and forwarded great quantities of supplies to  the Negroes and to the whites in the hill and mountain counties. The  reorganized state and local governments sent food from the unravaged  portions of the Black Belt to the nearest white counties, and the  army commanders gave some aid. As soon as the Freedmen's Bureau was  organized, it fed to the limit of its supplies the needy whites as well  as the blacks.    The extent of the relief afforded by the charity of the North and by  the agencies of the United States Government is not now generally  remembered, probably on account of the later objectionable activities  of the Freedmen's Bureau, but it was at the time properly appreciated.  A Southern journalist, writing of what he saw in Georgia, remarked that  \"it must be a matter of gratitude as well as surprise for our people to  see a Government which was lately fighting us with fire and sword and  shell, now generously feeding our poor and distressed. In the immense  crowds which throng the distributing house, I notice the mothers and  fathers, widows and orphans of our soldiers. ... Again, the Confederate  soldier, with one leg or one arm, the crippled, maimed, and broken, and  the worn and destitute men, who fought bravely their enemies then, their  benefactors now, have their sacks filled and are fed.\"    Acute distress continued until 1867; after that year there was no  further danger of starvation. Some of the poor whites, especially in the  remote districts, never again reached a comfortable standard of living;  some were demoralized by too much assistance; others were discouraged  and left the South for the West or the North. But the mass of the people  accepted the discipline of poverty and made the best of their situation.    The difficulties, however, that beset even the courageous and the  competent were enormous. The general paralysis of industry, the breaking  up of society, and poverty on all sides bore especially hard on those  who had not previously been manual laborers. Physicians could get  practice enough but no fees; lawyers who had supported the Confederacy  found it difficult to get back into the reorganized courts because of  the test oaths and the competition of \"loyal\" attorneys; and for  the teachers there were few schools.

CHAPTER II. THE ADVENTURERS    What was this Virginia to which they were bound? In the sixteenth  and early seventeenth centuries the name stood for a huge stretch of  littoral, running southward from lands of long winters and fur-bearing  animals to lands of the canebrake, the fig, the magnolia, the chameleon,  and the mockingbird. The world had been circumnavigated; Drake had  passed up the western coast--and yet cartographers, the learned, and  those who took the word from the learned, strangely visualized the North  American mainland as narrow indeed. Apparently, they conceived it as a  kind of extended Central America. The huge rivers puzzled them. There  existed a notion that these might be estuaries, curling and curving  through the land from sea to sea. India--Cathay--spices and wonders and  Orient wealth--lay beyond the South Sea, and the South Sea was but a few  days' march from Hatteras or Chesapeake. The Virginia familiar to the  mind of the time lay extended, and she was very slender. Her right hand  touched the eastern ocean, and her left hand touched the western.    Contact and experience soon modified this general notion. Wider  knowledge, political and economic considerations, practical reasons of  all kinds, drew a different physical form for old Virginia. Before the  seventeenth century had passed away, they had given to her northern  end a baptism of other names. To the south she was lopped to make the  Carolinas. Only to the west, for a long time, she seemed to grow, while  like a mirage the South Sea and Cathay receded into the distance.    This narrative, moving with the three ships from England, and through a  time span of less than a hundred and fifty years, deals with a region  of the western hemisphere a thousand miles in length, several hundred  in breadth, stretching from the Florida line to the northern edge of  Chesapeake Bay, and from the Atlantic to the Appalachians. Out of this  Virginia there grow in succession the ancient colonies and the modern  States of Virginia, Maryland, South and North Carolina, and Georgia.    But for many a year Virginia itself was the only settlement and the only  name. This Virginia was a country favored by nature. Neither too hot nor  too cold, it was rich-soiled and capable of every temperate growth in  its sunniest aspect. Great rivers drained it, flowing into a great  bay, almost a sea, many-armed as Briareus, affording safe and sheltered  harbors. Slowly, with beauty, the land mounted to the west. The sun set  behind wooded mountains, long wave-lines raised far back in geologic  time. The valleys were many and beautiful, watered by sliding streams.  Back to the east again, below the rolling land, were found the  shimmering levels, the jewel-green marshes, the wide, slow waters, and  at last upon the Atlantic shore the thunder of the rainbow-tinted surf.  Various and pleasing was the country. Springs and autumns were long and  balmy, the sun shone bright, there was much blue sky, a rich flora and  fauna. There were mineral wealth and water power, and breadth and depth  for agriculture. Such was the Virginia between the Potomac and the Dan,  the Chesapeake and the Alleghanies.    This, and not the gold-bedight slim neighbor of Cathay, was now the  lure of the Susan Constant, the Goodspeed, and the Discovery. But those  aboard, obsessed by Spanish America, imperfectly knowing the features  and distances of the orb, yet clung to their first vision. But they knew  there would be forest and Indians. Tales enough had been told of both!    What has to be imaged is a forest the size of Virginia. Here and there,  chiefly upon river banks, show small Indian clearings. Here and there  are natural meadows, and toward the salt water great marshes, the home  of waterfowl. But all these are little or naught in the whole, faint  adornments sewed upon a shaggy garment, green in summer, flame-hued in  autumn, brown in winter, green and flower-colored in the spring. Nor  was the forest to any appreciable extent like much Virginian forest of  today, second growth, invaded, hewed down, and renewed, to hear again  the sound of the axe, set afire by a thousand accidents, burning upon  its own funeral pyres, all its primeval glory withered. The forest of  old Virginia was jocund and powerful, eternally young and eternally old.  The forest was Despot in the land--was Emperor and Pope.    With the forest went the Indian. They had a pact together. The Indians  hacked out space for their villages of twenty or thirty huts, their  maize and bean fields and tobacco patches. They took saplings for poles  and bark to cover the huts and wood for fires. The forest gave canoe and  bow and arrow, household bowls and platters, the sides of the drum that  was beaten at feasts. It furnished trees serviceable for shelter when  the foe was stalked. It was their wall and roof, their habitat. It was  one of the Four Friends of the Indians--the Ground, the Waters, the Sky,  the Forest. The forest was everywhere, and the Indians dwelled in the  forest. Not unnaturally, they held that this world was theirs.    Upon the three ships, sailing, sailing, moved a few men who could speak  with authority of the forest and of Indians. Christopher Newport was  upon his first voyage to Virginia, but he knew the Indies and the South  American coast. He had sailed and had fought under Francis Drake. And  Bartholomew Gosnold had explored both for himself and for Raleigh. These  two could tell others what to look for. In their company there was also  John Smith. This gentleman, it is true, had not wandered, fought, and  companioned with romance in America, but he had done so everywhere else.  He had as yet no experience with Indians, but he could conceive that  rough experiences were rough experiences, whether in Europe, Asia,  Africa, or America. And as he knew there was a family likeness among  dangerous happenings, so also he found one among remedies, and he had a  bag full of stories of strange happenings and how they should be met.    They were going the old, long West Indies sea road. There was time  enough for talking, wondering, considering the past, fantastically  building up the future. Meeting in the ships' cabins over ale tankards,  pacing up and down the small high-raised poop-decks, leaning idle over  the side, watching the swirling dark-blue waters or the stars of night,  lying idle upon the deck, propped by the mast while the trade-winds  blew and up beyond sail and rigging curved the sky--they had time enough  indeed to plan for marvels! If they could have seen ahead, what pictures  of things to come they might have beheld rising, falling, melting one  into another!    Certain of the men upon the Susan Constant, the Goodspeed, and the  Discovery stand out clearly, etched against the sky.    Christopher Newport might be forty years old. He had been of Raleigh's  captains and was chosen, a very young man, to bring to England from the  Indies the captured great carrack, Madre de Dios, laden with fabulous  treasure. In all, Newport was destined to make five voyages to Virginia,  carrying supply and aid. After that, he would pass into the service of  the East India Company, know India, Java, and the Persian Gulf; would be  praised by that great company for sagacity, energy, and good care of his  men. Ten years' time from this first Virginia voyage, and he would die  upon his ship, the Hope, before Bantam in Java.    Bartholomew Gosnold, the captain of the Goodspeed, had sailed with  thirty others, five years before, from Dartmouth in a bark named the  Concord. He had not made the usual long sweep southward into tropic  waters, there to turn and come northward, but had gone, arrow-straight,  across the north Atlantic--one of the first English sailors to make the  direct passage and save many a weary sea league. Gosnold and his men  had seen Cape Ann and Cape Cod, and had built upon Cuttyhunk, among the  Elizabeth Islands, a little fort thatched with rushes. Then, hardships  thronging and quarrels developing, they had filled their ship with  sassafras and cedar, and sailed for home over the summer Atlantic,  reaching England, with \"not one cake of bread\" left but only \"a little  vinegar.\" Gosnold, guiding the Goodspeed, is now making his last voyage,  for he is to die in Virginia within the year.    George Percy, brother of the Earl of Northumberland, has fought bravely  in the Low Countries. He is to stay five years in Virginia, to serve  there a short time as Governor, and then, returning to England, is to  write \"A Trewe Relacyion\", in which he begs to differ from John Smith's  \"Generall Historie.\" Finally, he goes again to the wars in the Low  Countries, serves with distinction, and dies, unmarried, at the age  of fifty-two. His portrait shows a long, rather melancholy face, set  between a lace collar and thick, dark hair.    A Queen and a Cardinal--Mary Tudor and Reginald Pole--had stood sponsors  for the father of Edward-Maria Wingfield. This man, of an ancient and  honorable stock, was older than most of his fellow adventurers to  Virginia. He had fought in Ireland, fought in the Low Countries, had  been a prisoner of war. Now he was presently to become \"the first  president of the first council in the first English colony in America.\"  And then, miseries increasing and wretched men being quick to impute  evil, it was to be held with other assertions against him that he was of  a Catholic family, that he traveled without a Bible, and probably  meant to betray Virginia to the Spaniard. He was to be deposed from his  presidency, return to"]]]
