The  Robin and the Blue Bird are tenderly associated in the memories of most  persons whose childhood was passed on a farm or in the country village.  Before the advent of the English Sparrow, the Blue Bird was sure to  be the first to occupy and the last to defend the little box prepared  for his return, appearing in his blue jacket somewhat in advance of  the plainly habited female, who on her arrival quite often found a  habitation selected and ready for her acceptance, should he find favor  in her sight. And then he becomes a most devoted husband and father,  sitting by the nest and warbling with earnest affection his exquisite  tune, and occasionally flying away in search of food for his mate and  nestlings.    The Blue Bird rears two broods in the season, and, should the weather  be mild, even three. His nest contains three eggs.    In the spring and summer when he is happy and gay, his song is  extremely soft and agreeable, while it grows very mournful and  plaintive as cold weather approaches. He is mild of temper, and a  peaceable and harmless neighbor, setting a fine example of amiability  to his feathered friends. In the early spring, however, he wages war  against robins, wrens, swallows, and other birds whose habitations are  of a kind to take his fancy. A celebrated naturalist says: \"This bird  seems incapable of uttering a harsh note, or of doing a spiteful,  ill-tempered thing.\"    Nearly everybody has his anecdote to tell of the Blue Bird's courage,  but the author of \"Wake Robin\" tells his exquisitely thus: \"A few years  ago I put up a little bird house in the back end of my garden for the  accommodation of the wrens, and every season a pair have taken up their  abode there. One spring a pair of Blue Birds looked into the tenement,  and lingered about several days, leading me to hope that they would  conclude to occupy it. But they finally went away. Late in the season  the wrens appeared, and after a little coquetting, were regularly  installed in their old quarters, and were as happy as only wrens can  be. But before their honeymoon was over, the Blue Birds returned. I  knew something was wrong before I was up in the morning. Instead of that  voluble and gushing song outside the window, I heard the wrens scolding  and crying out at a fearful rate, and on going out saw the Blue Birds in  possession of the box. The poor wrens were in despair and were forced to  look for other quarters.\"          THE SWALLOW.          \"Come, summer visitant, attach        To my reedroof thy nest of clay,      And let my ear thy music catch,      Low twitting underneath the thatch,        At the gray dawn of day.\"    Sure harbingers of spring are the Swallows. They are very common birds,  and frequent, as a rule, the cultivated lands in the neighborhood of  water, showing a decided preference for the habitations of man. \"How  gracefully the swallows fly! See them coursing over the daisy-bespangled  grass fields; now they skim just over the blades of grass, and then with  a rapid stroke of their long wings mount into the air and come hovering  above your head, displaying their rich white and chestnut plumage to  perfection. Now they chase each other for very joyfulness, uttering  their sharp twittering notes; then they hover with expanded wings  like miniature Kestrels, or dart downwards with the velocity of  the sparrowhawk; anon they flit rapidly over the neighboring pool,  occasionally dipping themselves in its calm and placid waters, and  leaving a long train of rings marking their varied course. How easily  they turn, or glide over the surrounding hedges, never resting, never  weary, and defying the eye to trace them in the infinite turnings and  twistings of their rapid shooting flight. You frequently see them glide  rapidly near the ground, and then with a sidelong motion mount aloft, to  dart downwards like an animated meteor, their plumage glowing in the  light with metallic splendor, and the row of white spots on the tail  contrasting beautifully with the darker plumage.\"    The Swallow is considered a life-paired species, and returns to its  nesting site of the previous season, building a new nest close to the  old one. His nest is found in barns and outhouses, upon the beams of  wood which support the roof, or in any place which assures protection to  the young birds. It is cup-shaped and artfully moulded of bits of mud.  Grass and feathers are used for the lining. \"The nest completed, five or  six eggs are deposited. They are of a pure white color, with deep rich  brown blotches and spots, notably at the larger end, round which they  often form a zone or belt.\" The sitting bird is fed by her mate.    The young Swallow is distinguished from the mature birds by the absence  of the elongated tail feathers, which are a mark of maturity alone. His  food is composed entirely of insects. Swallows are on the wing fully  sixteen hours, and the greater part of the time making terrible havoc  amongst the millions of insects which infest the air. It is said that  when the Swallow is seen flying high in the heavens, it is a never  failing indication of fine weather.    A pair of Swallows on arriving at their nesting place of the preceding  Summer found their nest occupied by a Sparrow, who kept the poor birds  at a distance by pecking at them with his strong beak whenever they  attempted to dislodge him. Wearied and hopeless of regaining possession  of their property, they at last hit upon a plan which effectually  punished the intruder. One morning they appeared with a few more  Swallows--their mouths filled with a supply of tempered clay--and, by  their joint efforts in a short time actually plastered up the entrance  to the hole, thus barring the Sparrow from the home which he had stolen  from the Swallows.    [Illustration: BARN SWALLOW.]          THE BROWN THRUSH.          \"However the world goes ill,        The Thrushes still sing in it.\"    The Mocking-bird of the North, as the Brown Thrush has been called,  arrives in the Eastern and Middle States about the 10th of May, at which  season he may be seen, perched on the highest twig of a hedge, or on the  topmost branch of a tree, singing his loud and welcome song, that may be  heard a distance of half a mile. The favorite haunt of the Brown Thrush,  however, is amongst the bright and glossy foliage of the evergreens.  \"There they delight to hide, although not so shy and retiring as the  Blackbird; there they build their nests in greatest numbers, amongst the  perennial foliage, and there they draw at nightfall to repose in warmth  and safety.\" The Brown Thrasher sings chiefly just after sunrise and  before sunset, but may be heard singing at intervals during the day. His  food consists of wild fruits, such as blackberries and raspberries,  snails, worms, slugs and grubs. He also obtains much of his food  amongst the withered leaves and marshy places of the woods and  shrubberies which he frequents. Few birds possess a more varied melody.  His notes are almost endless in variety, each note seemingly uttered at  the caprice of the bird, without any perceptible approach to order.    The site of the Thrush's nest is a varied one, in the hedgerows, under a  fallen tree or fence-rail; far up in the branches of stately trees, or  amongst the ivy growing up their trunks. The nest is composed of the  small dead twigs of trees, lined with the fine fibers of roots. From  three to five eggs are deposited, and are hatched in about twelve days.  They have a greenish background, thickly spotted with light brown,  giving the whole egg a brownish appearance.    The Brown Thrush leaves the Eastern and Middle States, on his migration  South, late in September, remaining until the following May.           *       *       *    THE THRUSH'S NEST.        \"Within a thick and spreading hawthorn bush        That overhung a molehill, large and round,      I heard from morn to morn a merry thrush        Sing hymns of rapture while I drank the sound      With joy--and oft an unintruding guest,        I watched her secret toils from day to day;      How true she warped the moss to form her nest,        And modeled it within with wood and clay.      And by and by, with heath-bells gilt with dew,        There lay her shining eggs as bright as flowers,      Ink-spotted over, shells of green and blue:        And there I witnessed, in the summer hours,      A brood of nature's minstrels chirp and fly,        Glad as the sunshine and the laughing sky.\"          THE BROWN THRUSH.      Dear Readers:    My cousin Robin Redbreast told me that he wrote you a letter last month  and sent it with his picture. How did you like it? He is a pretty  bird--Cousin Robin--and everybody likes him. But I must tell you  something of myself.    Folks call me by different names--some of them nicknames, too.    The cutest one of all is Brown Thrasher. I wonder if you know why they  call me Thrasher. If you don't, ask some one. It is really funny.    Some people think Cousin Robin is the sweetest singer of our family, but  a great many like my song just as well.    Early in the morning I sing among the bushes, but later in the day you  will always find me in the very top of a tree and it is then I sing my  best.    Do you know what I say in my song? Well, if I am near a farmer while he  is planting, I say: \"Drop it, drop it--cover it up, cover it up--pull it  up, pull it up, pull it up.\"    One thing I very seldom do and that is, sing when near my nest. Maybe  you can tell why. I'm not very far from my nest now. I just came down to  the stream to get a drink and am watching that boy on the other side of  the stream. Do you see him?    One dear lady who loves birds has said some very nice things about me in  a book called \"Bird Ways.\" Another lady has written a beautiful poem  about my singing. Ask your mamma or teacher the"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/3013"],[0,"The Birds (#2)"],[1,".(2) That is why we started off with a basket, a  stew-pot and some myrtle boughs(3) and have come to seek a quiet country  in which to settle. We are going to Tereus, the Epops, to learn from  him, whether, in his aerial flights, he has noticed some town of this  kind.    f(1) Literally, 'to go to the crows,' a proverbial expression equivalent  to our 'going to the devil.'    f(2) They leave Athens because of their hatred of lawsuits and  informers; this is the especial failing of the Athenians satirized in  'The Wasps.'    f(3) Myrtle boughs were used in sacrifices, and the founding of every  colony was started by a sacrifice.    PISTHETAERUS Here! look!    EUELPIDES What's the matter?    PISTHETAERUS Why, the crow has been pointing me to something up there  for some time now.    EUELPIDES And the jay is also opening its beak and craning its neck to  show me I know not what. Clearly, there are some birds about here. We  shall soon know, if we kick up a noise to start them.    PISTHETAERUS Do you know what to do? Knock your leg against this rock.    EUELPIDES And you your head to double the noise.    PISTHETAERUS Well then use a stone instead; take one and hammer with it.    EUELPIDES Good idea! Ho there, within! Slave! slave!    PISTHETAERUS What's that, friend! You say, \"slave,\" to summon Epops! It  would be much better to shout, \"Epops, Epops!\"    EUELPIDES Well then, Epops! Must I knock again? Epops!    TROCHILUS Who's there? Who calls my master?    PISTHETAERUS Apollo the Deliverer! what an enormous beak!(1)    f(1) The actors wore masks made to resemble the birds they were supposed  to represent.    TROCHILUS Good god! they are bird-catchers.    EUELPIDES The mere sight of him petrifies me with terror. What a  horrible monster.    TROCHILUS Woe to you!    EUELPIDES But we are not men.    TROCHILUS What are you, then?    EUELPIDES I am the Fearling, an African bird.    TROCHILUS You talk nonsense.    EUELPIDES Well, then, just ask it of my feet.(1)    f(1) Fear had had disastrous effects upon Euelpides' internal economy,  and this his feet evidenced.    TROCHILUS And this other one, what bird is it?    PISTHETAERUS I? I am a Cackling,(1) from the land of the pheasants.    f(1) The same mishap had occurred to Pisthetaerus.    EUELPIDES But you yourself, in the name of the gods! what animal are  you?    TROCHILUS Why, I am a slave-bird.    EUELPIDES Why, have you been conquered by a cock?    TROCHILUS No, but when my master was turned into a peewit, he begged me  to become a bird too, to follow and to serve him.    EUELPIDES Does a bird need a servant, then?    TROCHILUS 'Tis no doubt because he was a man. At times he wants to eat a  dish of loach from Phalerum; I seize my dish and fly to fetch him some.  Again he wants some pea-soup; I seize a ladle and a pot and run to get  it.    EUELPIDES This is, then, truly a running-bird.(1) Come, Trochilus, do us  the kindness to call your master.    f(1) The Greek word for a wren is derived from the same root as 'to  run.'    TROCHILUS Why, he has just fallen asleep after a feed of myrtle-berries  and a few grubs.    EUELPIDES Never mind; wake him up.    TROCHILUS I an certain he will be angry. However, I will wake him to  please you.    PISTHETAERUS You cursed brute! why, I am almost dead with terror!    EUELPIDES Oh! my god! 'twas sheer fear that made me lose my jay.    PISTHETAERUS Ah! you great coward! were you so frightened that you let  go your jay?    EUELPIDES And did you not lose your crow, when you fell sprawling on the  ground? Pray tell me that.    PISTHETAERUS No, no.    EUELPIDES Where is it, then?    PISTHETAERUS It has flown away.    EUELPIDES Then you did not let it go? Oh! you brave fellow!    EPOPS Open the forest,(1) that I may go out!    f(1) No doubt there was some scenery to represent a forest. Besides,  there is a pun intended. The words answering for 'forests' and 'door' in  Greek only differ slightly in sound.    EUELPIDES By Heracles! what a creature! what plumage! What means this  triple crest?    EPOPS Who wants me?    EUELPIDES The twelve great gods have used you ill, meseems.    EPOPS Are you chaffing me about my feathers? I have been a man,  strangers.    EUELPIDES 'Tis not you we are jeering at.    EPOPS At what, then?    EUELPIDES Why, 'tis your beak that looks so odd to us.    EPOPS This is how Sophocles outrages me in his tragedies. Know, I once  was Tereus.(1)    f(1) Sophocles had written a tragedy about Tereus, in which, no doubt,  the king finally appears as a hoopoe.    EUELPIDES You were Tereus, and what are you now? a bird or a peacock?(1)    f(1) (O)ne would expect the question to be \"bird or man.\"--Are you a  peacock? The hoopoe resembles the peacock inasmuch as both have crests.    EPOPS I am a bird.    EUELPIDES Then where are your feathers? For I don't see them.    EPOPS They have fallen off.    EUELPIDES Through illness?    EPOPS No. All birds moult their feathers, you know, every winter, and  others grow in their place. But tell me, who are you?    EUELPIDES We? We are mortals.    EPOPS From what country?    EUELPIDES From the land of the beautiful galleys.(1)    f(1) Athens.    EPOPS Are you dicasts?(1)    f(1) The Athenians were madly addicted to lawsuits. (See 'The Wasps.')    EUELPIDES No, if anything, we are anti-dicasts.    EPOPS Is that kind of seed sown among you?(1)    f(1) As much as to say, 'Then you have such things as anti-dicasts?' And  Euelpides practically replaces, 'Very few.'    EUELPIDES You have to look hard to find even a little in our fields.    EPOPS What brings you here?    EUELPIDES We wish to pay you a visit.    EPOPS What for?    EUELPIDES Because you formerly were a man, like we are, formerly you  had debts, as we have, formerly you did not want to pay them, like  ourselves; furthermore, being turned into a bird, you have when flying  seen all lands and seas. Thus you have all human knowledge as well as  that of birds. And hence we have come to you to beg you to direct us to  some cosy town, in which one can repose as if on thick coverlets.    EPOPS And are you looking for a greater city than Athens?    EUELPIDES No, not a greater, but one more pleasant to dwell in.    EPOPS Then you are looking for an aristocratic country.    EUELPIDES I? Not at all! I hold the son of Scellias in horror.(1)    f(1) His name was Aristocrates; he was a general and commanded a fleet  sent in aid of Corcyra.    EPOPS But, after all, what sort of city would please you best?    EUELPIDES A place where the following would be the most important  business transacted.--Some friend would come knocking at the door quite  early in the morning saying, \"By Olympian Zeus, be at my house early,  as soon as you have bathed, and bring your children too. I am giving a  nuptial feast, so don't fail, or else don't cross my threshold when I am  in distress.\"    EPOPS Ah! that's what may be called being fond of hardships! And what  say you?    PISTHETAERUS My tastes are similar.    EPOPS And they are?    PISTHETAERUS I want a town where the father of a handsome lad will stop  in the street and say to me reproachfully as if I had failed him, \"Ah!  Is this well done, Stilbonides! You met my son coming from the bath  after the gymnasium and you neither spoke to him, nor embraced him, nor  took him with you, nor ever once twitched his parts. Would anyone call  you an old friend of mine?\"    EPOPS Ah! wag, I see you are fond of suffering. But there is a city of  delights, such as you want. 'Tis on the Red Sea.    EUELPIDES Oh, no. Not a sea-port, where some fine morning the  Salaminian(1) galley can appear, bringing a writ-server along. Have you  no Greek town you can propose to us?    f(1) The State galley, which carried the officials of the Athenian  republic to their several departments and brought back those whose time  had expired; it was this galley that was sent to Sicily to fetch back  Alcibiades, who was accused of sacrilege.    EPOPS Why not choose Lepreum in Elis for your settlement?    EUELPIDES By Zeus! I could not look at Lepreum without disgust, because  of Melanthius.(1)    f(1) A tragic poet, who was a leper; there is a play, of course, on the  word Lepreum.    EPOPS Then, again, there is the Opuntian, where you could live.    EUELPIDES I would not be Opuntian(1) for a talent. But come, what is it  like to live with the birds? You should know pretty well.    f(1) An allusion to Opuntius, who was one-eyed.    EPOPS Why, 'tis not a disagreeable life. In the first place, one has no  purse.    EUELPIDES That does away with much roguery.    EPOPS For food the gardens yield us white sesame, myrtle-berries,  poppies and mint.    EUELPIDES Why, 'tis the life of the newly-wed indeed.(1)    f(1) The newly-married ate a sesame-cake, decorated with garlands of  myrtle, poppies and mint.    PISTHETAERUS Ha! I am beginning to see a great plan, which will transfer  the supreme power to the birds, if you will but take my advice.    EPOPS Take your advice? In what way?    PISTHETAERUS In what way? Well, firstly, do not fly in all directions  with open beak; it is not dignified. Among us, when we see a thoughtless  man, we ask, \"What sort of bird is this?\" and Teleas answers, \"'Tis  a man who has no brain, a bird that has lost his head, a creature you  cannot catch, for it never remains in any one place.\"    EPOPS By Zeus himself! your jest hits the mark. What then is to be done?    PISTHETAERUS Found a city.    EPOPS We birds? But what sort of city should we build?    PISTHETAERUS Oh, really, really! 'tis spoken like a fool! Look down.    EPOPS I am looking.    PISTHETAERUS Now look upwards.    EPOPS I am looking.    PISTHETAERUS Turn your head round.    EPOPS Ah! 'twill be pleasant for me, if I end in twisting my neck!    PISTHETAERUS What have you seen?    EPOPS The clouds and the sky.    PISTHETAERUS Very well! is not this the pole of the birds then?    EPOPS How their pole?    PISTHETAERUS Or, if you like it, the land. And"]]]
