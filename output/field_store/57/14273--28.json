Oh, ho! to think there could be   A lady so silly-down-dilly as she!     She goes for a walk on an ocean wave,   She fishes for cats in a coral cave;   She drinks from an empty glass of milk,   And lines her potato trees with silk.   I'm sure that fornever and never was seen   So foolish a thing as the Nonsense Queen!     She ordered a wig for a blue bottle fly,   And she wrote a note to a pumpkin pie;   She makes all the oysters wear emerald rings,   And does dozens of other nonsensible things.   Oh! the scatterbrained, shatterbrained lady so grand,   Her Royal Skyhighness of Nonsense Land!           Opulent Ollie       One Saturday opulent Ollie   Thought he'd go for a ride on the trolley;     But his pennies were few,--     He only had two,--   So he went and made mud-pies with Polly.     [Illustration]           The Two Bears       Prince Curlilocks remarked one day     To Princess Dimplecheek,   \"I haven't had a real good play     For more than 'most a week.\"     Said Princess Dimplecheek, \"My dear,     Your majesty forgets--   This morning we played grenadier     With grandpa's epaulets.     \"And yesterday we sailed to Spain--     We both were pirates bold,   And braved the wild and raging main     To seek for hidden gold.\"     \"True,\" said the prince; \"I mind me well--     Right hardily we fought,   And stormed a massive citadel     To gain the prize we sought.     \"But if your ladyship agrees,     Methinks we'll go upstairs   And build a waste of arctic seas,     And we'll be polar bears.\"     \"Yes, if you'll promise not to bite,\"     Fair Dimplecheek replied,   Already half-way up the flight,     His highness by her side.     \"Princess, on that far window-seat,     Go, sit thee down and wait,   While I ask nursie for a sheet,     Or maybe six or eight.\"     A pile of sheets his highness brought.     \"Dear princess, pray take these;   Although our path with danger's fraught,     We'll reach the polar seas.\"     Two furry rugs his lordship bore,     Two pairs of mittens white;   He threw them on the nursery floor     And shouted with delight.     He spread those sheets--the funny boy--     O'er table, floor, and chair.   \"Princess,\" said he, \"don't you enjoy     This frosty, bracing air?     \"These snowy sheets are fields of ice,     This is an iceberg grim.\"   \"Yes, dear, I think it's very nice,\"     She said, and smiled at him.     And then they donned the rugs of fur,     The mittens, too, they wore;   And Curlilocks remarked to her,     \"Now you must roar and roar.\"     [Illustration]     Dimplecheek looked out from the cowl     Formed by her furry rug.   \"I'm 'fraid of bears that only growl--     I like the kind that hug.\"           The Very Merry Voyage of the Macaroni Man       This figure here before you is a Macaroni Man,   Who is built, as you may notice, on a most ingenious plan.   His skeleton, I beg to state, is made of hairpins three,   Which are bent and curved and twisted to a marvellous degree.   His coat-sleeves and his trouser-legs, his head and eke his waist   Are made of superfine imported macaroni paste.   And if you care to listen, you may hear the thrilling tale   Of the merry Macaroni Man's extraordinary sail.   One sunny day he started for a voyage in his yacht,   His anxious mother called to him, and said, \"You'd better not!   Although the sun is shining bright, I fear that it may rain;   And don't you think, my darling boy, you'd better take the train?\"   \"Oh, no,\" said he, \"no clouds I see,--the sky is blue and clear,   I will return in time for tea--good-by, my mother  dear.\"     [Illustration]     Full merrily he started off, the day was fine and fair,   And to his great delight he found no dampness in the air.   You know if he gets wet, a Macaroni Man is spoiled,   And if he stands too near the steam, of course he may get boiled.   But our hero used precautions,--carefully he shunned the spray,--   And when the steam blew toward him, he just steered the other way.   Now, as the breeze was from the land, his course lay out to sea;   He sailed so far that he felt sure he would be late for tea.   He sailed, and sailed, and sailed, and sailed,--                 he feared the dew would fall--   He tried to turn,--but oh, that steam! it would not do at all!     [Illustration]     A single puff blew toward him, and it nearly cooked his face!   The mournful Macaroni Man felt sadly out of place.   But a happy thought occurred to him, \"Ha, ha,--ho, ho!\" said he,--   \"I'll just sail on around the world,--and then, it seems to me,   I'll reach my home (according to a careful estimate)   In time for tea, although I'll be perhaps a trifle late.\"   Then merrily his gallant ship sped o'er the bounding main,   Quickly he crossed the ocean wide, he flew by France and Spain;   Covered the Mediterranean, spanned the Suez Canal,--   \"I'll reach my home to-night,\" he thought, \"oh, yes, I'm sure I shall.\"   He skimmed the Red Sea like a bird,--the Indian Ocean crossed   (But once, in Oceanica, he feared that he was lost).     [Illustration]     He passed Australia on the fly,--cut over Capricorn,   And as the sunset gun he heard, he swung around Cape Horn.   Still at full speed, he sailed due north, he rounded Cape St. Roque,   Crossed the equator, and found out the Gulf Stream was no joke.   He coasted by the seaboard States. Hurrah! all danger past,   Quickly he sailed the last few miles and reached his home at last;   His mother welcomed him, and said, \"I'm glad there was no shower;   But hurry in, my bonny boy, I've waited tea an hour.\"     [Illustration]           The 4.04 Train       \"There's a train at 4.04,\" said Miss Jenny;   \"Four tickets I'll take. Have you any?\"       Said the man at the door:       \"Not four for 4.04,   For four for 4.04 is too many.\"           [Illustration]     A Valuable Gift       Old Father Time, one day   In his study, so they say,     Was indulging in a surreptitious nap,   When from his drowsy dreams   He was wakened, as it seems,     By a timid but persistent little rap.     He yawned and rubbed his eyes   In indolent surprise,     Then slowly he arose from where he sat;   He opened wide his door,   And nearly tumbled o'er     The figure that stood waiting on the mat.     A tiny little dog,   With excitement all agog,     And angry eyes that seemed to flash and glower.   His manner was polite,   But he said, \"I claim my right!     And I've called, sir, to demand of you my hour.\"     \"Your what?\" the old man said,   As he shook his puzzled head;     And the pertinacious puppy spoke with force:   \"Well, sir, they often say,   'Every dog must have his day,'     So a puppy ought to have an hour, of course!\"     [Illustration]     The old man shook with glee,   But he said obligingly,     \"The dog days are all gone, I grieve to say;   But since you've come so far,   And so mannerly you are,     I'll give you just an hour--to get away.\"           [Illustration]     The Grandiloquent Goat       A very grandiloquent Goat   Sat down to a gay table d'hote;     He ate all the corks,     The knives and the forks,   Remarking: \"On these things I dote.\"     Then, before his repast he began,   While pausing the menu to scan,     He said: \"Corn, if you please,     And tomatoes and pease,   I'd like to have served in the can.\"           How the Cat was Belled       A fable told by La Fontaine,     Two centuries or more ago,   Describes some rats who would arraign     A cat, their direst foe,   Who killed so many rats     And caused the deepest woe,   This Catiline of cats.     The poor rats were at their wits' end   Their homes and families to defend;     And as a last resort     They took the case to court.     It seems they called a caucus wise   Of rats of every age and size,     And then their dean,     With sapient mien,   A very Solon of a rat,   Said it was best to bell the cat.     The quaint old tale goes on to tell   How this plan would have worked quite well,     But, somehow, flaws     Appeared, because   No one would hang the bell.     Though there the ancient fable ends,   Later report the tale extends,     No longer is the truth withheld;       Developments appear,       And so you have it here.         For the first time         Set down in rhyme     Just how that cat was belled.     The council, as 'twas getting late,   Was just about to separate,     When suddenly a rat arose     Who said he could a plan propose       Which would, he thought, succeed       And meet their urgent need.     Now as this rat was very small,   And had no dignity at all,     Although his plan was well advised,     We really need not be surprised   That all the rats of riper years   Expressed the gravest doubts and fears;       Till suddenly       He said, said he,   \"If you will leave it all to me,         I will avow         Three days from now   That you shall all be free.\"   The solemn council then adjourned.   Each rat to home and fireside turned;     But each shook his wise head     And to his neighbor said:   \"It is a dangerous job, in truth,   Though it seems naught to headstrong youth.\"     Now young Sir Rat we next behold,   With manner brave and visage bold,       Go marching down       To London town,   Where wondrous things are sold.       We see him stop       At a large shop,   And with the bland clerk's courteous aid   This was the purchase that he made:   A bicycle of finest make,   With modern gear and patent brake,   Pedometer, pneumatic tire,   And spokes that looked like silver wire,       A lantern bright       To shine at night,   Enamel finish, nickel plate,   And all improvements up to date.   Said sly Sir Rat: \"It suits me well,   Especially that sweet-toned _bell_.\"     [Illustration]     The shades of night were falling fast   When Sir Rat turned toward home at last.

In  that Conference or in the world, there was never a purer or a more  ardent patriot. Those of us who were associated with him politically,  had learned to love and respect him. His opponents admired his  unflinching devotion to his country, and his manly frankness and  candor. He was the type of a true American, able, unselfish, prudent,  unambitious, and good. Other pens will do justice to his memory, but I  thought as I heard the last account of him alive, as he lay within the  rebel lines, his face wearing that calm serenity which grew more  beautiful the nearer death approached, after having given so  abundantly of his goods, now yielding his life to his country in the  hour of her trial, that hereafter the good and true men of the nation  would emulate the illustrious example of his patriotism, and would  prize the blessings of a free government the more highly, as they  remembered that it could only be maintained and perpetuated by such  expensive sacrifices.    L.E.C.    _May_, 1864.          PROCEEDINGS OF THE CONFERENCE,    Washington, D.C.      MONDAY, _February 4th, 1861._    Commissioners representing a number of the States, assembled at  Willard's Hall, in the City of Washington, D.C., on the fourth day of  February, A.D. 1861, at 12 o'clock M., in pursuance of the following  preamble and resolutions, adopted by the General Assembly of the State  of Virginia, on the nineteenth day of January, A.D. 1861:         _Whereas_, It is the deliberate opinion of the General       Assembly of Virginia, that unless the unhappy controversy       which now divides the States of this confederacy, shall be       satisfactorily adjusted, a permanent dissolution of Union is       inevitable; and the General Assembly, representing the       wishes of the people of the commonwealth, is desirous of       employing every reasonable means to avert so dire a       calamity, and determined to make a final effort to restore       the Union and the Constitution, in the spirit in which they       were established by the fathers of the Republic: Therefore,         _Resolved_, That on behalf of the commonwealth of Virginia,       an invitation is hereby extended to all such States, whether       slaveholding or non-slaveholding, as are willing to unite       with Virginia in an earnest effort to adjust the present       unhappy controversies, in the spirit in which the       Constitution was originally formed, and consistently with       its principles, so as to afford to the people of the       slaveholding States adequate guarantees for the security of       their rights, to appoint commissioners to meet on the fourth       day of February next, in the City of Washington, similar       commissioners appointed by Virginia, to consider, and if       practicable, agree upon some suitable adjustment.         _Resolved_, That ex-President JOHN TYLER, WILLIAM C. RIVES,       Judge JOHN W. BROCKENBROUGH, GEORGE W. SUMMERS, and JAMES A.       SEDDON are hereby appointed commissioners, whose duty it       shall be to repair to the City of Washington, on the day       designated in the foregoing resolution, to meet such       commissioners as may be appointed by any of said States, in       accordance with the foregoing resolution.         _Resolved_, That if said commissioners, after full and free       conference, shall agree upon any plan of adjustment       requiring amendments to the Federal Constitution, for the       further security of the rights of the people of the       slaveholding States, they be requested to communicate the       proposed amendments to Congress, for the purpose of having       the same submitted by that body, according to the forms of       the Constitution, to the several States for ratification.         _Resolved_, That if said commissioners cannot agree on such       adjustment, or if agreeing, Congress shall refuse to submit       for ratification, such amendments as may be proposed, then       the commissioners of this State shall immediately       communicate the result to the executive of this       commonwealth, to be by him laid before the convention of the       people of Virginia and the General Assembly: _Provided_,       That the said commissioners be subject at all times to the       control of the General Assembly, or if in session, to that       of the State convention.         _Resolved_, That in the opinion of the General Assembly of       Virginia, the propositions embraced in the resolutions       presented to the Senate of the United States by the Hon.       JOHN J. CRITTENDEN, so modified as that the first article       proposed as an amendment to the Constitution of the United       States, shall apply to all the territory of the United       States now held or hereafter acquired south of latitude       thirty-six degrees and thirty minutes, and provide that       slavery of the African race shall be effectually protected       as property therein during the continuance of the       territorial government, and the fourth article shall secure       to the owners of slaves the right of transit with their       slaves between and through the non-slaveholding States and       territories, constitute the basis of such an adjustment of       the unhappy controversy which now divides the States of this       confederacy, as would be accepted by the people of this       commonwealth.         _Resolved_, That ex-President JOHN TYLER is hereby       appointed, by the concurrent vote of each branch of the       General Assembly, a commissioner to the President of the       United States, and Judge JOHN ROBERTSON is hereby appointed,       by a like vote, a commissioner to the State of South       Carolina, and the other States that have seceded or shall       secede, with instructions respectfully to request the       President of the United States and authorities of such       States to agree to abstain, pending the proceedings       contemplated by the action of this General Assembly, from       any and all acts calculated to produce a collision of arms       between the States and the Government of the United States.         _Resolved_, That copies of the foregoing resolutions be       forthwith telegraphed to the executives of the several       States, and also to the President of the United States, and       the Governor be requested to inform, without delay, the       commissioners of their appointment by the foregoing       resolutions.         [A copy from the rolls.]         WM. F. GORDON, JR.,         _C.H.D. and K.R. of Va._    The Conference was called to order by Mr. MOREHEAD, of Kentucky, who  proposed the name of the honorable JOHN C. WRIGHT, of Ohio, as  temporary Chairman.    The motion of Mr. MOREHEAD was unanimously adopted.    Mr. WRIGHT was conducted to the Chair by Mr. MEREDITH, of  Pennsylvania, and Mr. CHASE, of Ohio, and proceeded to address the  Conference as follows:    My warmest thanks are due to you, Gentlemen, for the undeserved honor  which you have conferred upon me, in selecting me for the purpose of  temporarily presiding over your deliberations. We have come together  to secure a common and at the same time a most important object--to  agree if we can upon some plan for adjusting the unhappy differences  which distract the country, which will be satisfactory to ourselves  and those we represent. We have assembled as friends, as brothers,  each, I doubt not, animated by the most friendly sentiments.    If we enter upon, and with these sentiments carry through, a patient  examination of the difficulties which now surround the Government, the  result will be, it must be, a success, earnestly hoped for by every  lover of his country; a result which will establish the Union  according to the spirit of the Constitution.    For myself, I may say that I have come here with the earnest purpose  of doing justice to all sections of the Union. I will hear with a  patient and impartial mind all that may be said in favor of, or  against such amendments of the Constitution as may be proposed. Such  of them as will give to the Government permanence, strength, and  stability, as will tend to secure to any State, or any number of  States, the quiet and unmolested enjoyment of their rights under it,  shall receive my cordial support. My confidence in republican  institutions, in the capacity of the people for self-government, has  been increased with every year of a life which has been protracted  beyond the term usually allotted to man. That life is now drawing to a  close, and I hope, when it ends, I may leave the Government more  firmly established in the affections of my countrymen than it ever was  before. To this end I have always labored, and shall continue to labor  while I live. I pray GOD that He will be with us during our  deliberations, and that He may guide them to a happy and wise  conclusion.    Mr. BENJAMIN C. HOWARD, a commissioner from the State of Maryland, was  unanimously appointed temporary Secretary.    The Roll of the States was then called over, and commissioners  representing the following were found to be present:    New Hampshire,  Rhode Island,  New Jersey,  Pennsylvania,  Delaware,  Maryland,  Virginia,  North Carolina,  Kentucky,  Ohio,  Indiana.    Mr. PRICE, of New Jersey:--I am informed that a number of Reporters  for the press are at the door of the hall, desiring admittance to this  Conference, for the purpose of reporting our proceedings. Whatever may  be the ultimate action of the Conference in this respect, I can see no  objection to the admission of reporters to-day, for our business will"]]]
