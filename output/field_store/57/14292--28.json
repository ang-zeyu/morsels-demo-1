June First.                                H.C. Walters.    \"Oh, Danny, what does it mean?\"    Dan went and carefully closed the door of Ella May's room before he  replied. His face was pale and his voice shaky.    \"Mean? Well, Mother, it just means that I've been stealing Mr.  Walters's trout all summer--_stealing_ them. That's what it means.\"    \"Oh, Danny! But you didn't know.\"    \"No, but I ought to have remembered that he was the new owner, and  have asked him. I never thought. Mother, what does 'prosecuted  according to law' mean?\"    \"I don't know, I'm sure, Danny. But if this is so, there's only one  thing to be done. You must go straight to Mr. Walters and tell him all  about it.\"    \"Mother, I don't dare to. He is a dreadfully hard man. Sam French's  father says--\"    \"I wouldn't believe a word Sam French's father says about Mr.  Walters!\" said Mrs. Phillips firmly. \"He's got a spite against him  because he was dismissed. Besides, Danny, it's the only right thing to  do. You know that. We're poor, but we have never done anything  underhand yet.\"    \"Yes, Mother, I know,\" said Dan, gulping his fear bravely down. \"I'll  go, of course, right after dinner. I was only scared at first. I'll  tell you what I'll do. I'll clean these trout nicely and take them to  Mr. Walters, and tell him that, if he'll only give me time, I'll pay  him back every cent of money I got for all I sold this summer. Then  maybe he'll let me off, seeing as I didn't know about the notice.\"    \"I'll go with you, Danny.\"    \"No, I'll go alone, Mother. You needn't go with me,\" said Dan  heroically. To himself he said that his mother had troubles enough. He  would never subject her to the added ordeal of an interview with the  stern factory owner. He would beard the lion in his den himself, if it  had to be done.    \"Don't tell Ella May anything about it. It would worry her. And don't  cry, Mother, I guess it'll be all right. Let me have my dinner now and  I'll go straight off.\"    Dan ate his dinner rapidly; then he carefully cleaned his trout, put  them in a long basket, with rhubarb leaves over them, and started with  an assumed cheerfulness very far from his real feelings.    He had barely passed the gate when another boy came shuffling along--a  tall, raw-boned lad, with an insinuating smile and shifty, cunning  eyes. The newcomer nodded familiarly to Dan.    \"Hello, sonny. Going over to the Lake with your catch, are you? You'll  fry up before you get there. There'll be nothing left of you but a  crisp.\"    \"No, I'm not going to the Lake. I'm going up to the factory to see Mr.  Walters.\"    Sam French gave a long whistle of surprise.    \"Why, Dan, what's taking you there? You surely ain't thinking of  trying for that place, are you? Walters wouldn't look at you. Why, he  wouldn't take _me_! You haven't the ghost of a chance.\"    \"No, I'm not going for that. Sam, did you know that Mr. Walters had a  notice in the Lake _Advertiser_ that nobody could fish in his pond  this summer?\"    \"Course I did--the old skinflint! He's too mean to live, that's what.  He never goes near the pond himself. Regular dog in the manger, he is.  Dad says--\"    \"Sam, why didn't you tell me about that notice?\"    \"Gracious, didn't you know? I s'posed everybody did, and here I've  been taking you for the cutest chap this side of sunset--fishing away  up in that creek where no one could see you, and cutting home through  the woods on the sly. You don't mean to tell me you never saw that  notice?\"    \"No, I didn't. Do you think I'd have gone near the pond if I had? I  never saw it till today, and I'm going straight to Mr. Walters now to  tell him about it.\"    Sam French stopped short in the dusty road and stared at Dan in  undisguised amazement.    \"Dan Phillips,\" he ejaculated, \"have you plum gone out of your mind?  Boy alive, you needn't be afraid that I'd peach on you. I'm too blamed  glad to see anyone get the better of that old Walters, smart as he  thinks himself. Gee! To dream of going to him and telling him you've  been fishing in his pond! Why, he'll put you in jail. You don't know  what sort of a man he is. Dad says--\"    \"Never mind what your dad says, Sam. My mind's made up.\"    \"Dan, you chump, listen to me. That notice says 'prosecuted according  to law.' Why, Danny, he'll put you in prison, or fine you, or  something dreadful.\"    \"I can't help it if he does,\" said Danny stoutly. \"You get out of  here, Sam French, and don't be trying to scare me. I mean to be  honest, and how can I be if I don't own up to Mr. Walters that I've  been stealing his trout all summer?\"    \"Stealing, fiddlesticks! Dan, I used to think you were a chap with  some sense, but I see I was mistaken. You ain't done no harm. Walters  will never miss them trout. If you're so dreadful squeamish that you  won't fish no more, why, you needn't. But just let the matter drop and  hold your tongue about it. That's _my_ advice.\"    \"Well, it isn't my mother's, then. I mean to go by _hers_. You needn't  argue no more, Sam. I'm going.\"    \"Go, then!\" said Sam, stopping short in disgust. \"You're a big fool,  Dan, and serve you right if Walters lands you off to jail; but I don't  wish you no ill. If I can do anything for your family after you're  gone, I will, and I'll try and give your remains Christian burial--if  there are any remains. So long, Danny! Give my love to old Walters!\"    Dan was not greatly encouraged by this interview. He shrank more than  ever from the thought of facing the stern factory owner. His courage  had almost evaporated when he entered the office at the factory and  asked shakily for Mr. Walters.    \"He's in his office there,\" replied the clerk, \"but he's very busy.  Better leave your message with me.\"    \"I must see Mr. Walters himself, please,\" said Dan firmly, but with  inward trepidation.    The clerk swung himself impatiently from his stool and ushered Dan  into Mr. Walters's private office.    \"Boy to see you, sir,\" he said briefly, as he closed the ground-glass  door behind him.    Dan, dizzy and trembling, stood in the dreaded presence. Mr. Walters  was writing at a table covered with a businesslike litter of papers.  He laid down his pen and looked up with a frown as the clerk vanished.  He was a stern-looking man with deep-set grey eyes and a square,  clean-shaven chin. There was not an ounce of superfluous flesh on his  frame, and his voice and manner were those of the decided, resolute,  masterful man of business.    He pointed to a capacious leather chair and said concisely, \"What is  your business with me, boy?\"    Dan had carefully thought out a statement of facts beforehand, but  every word had vanished from his memory. He had only a confused,  desperate consciousness that he had a theft to confess and that it  must be done as soon as possible. He did not sit down.    \"Please, Mr. Walters,\" he began desperately, \"I came to tell you--your  notice--I never saw it before--and I've been fishing on your pond all  summer--but I didn't know--honest--I've brought you all I caught  today--and I'll pay back for them all--some time.\"    An amused, puzzled expression crossed Mr. Walters's noncommittal face.  He pushed the leather chair forward.    \"Sit down, my boy,\" he said kindly. \"I don't quite understand this  somewhat mixed-up statement of yours. You've been fishing on my pond,  you say. Didn't you see my notice in the _Advertiser_?\"    Dan sat down more composedly. The revelation was over and he was still  alive.    \"No, sir. We hardly ever see an _Advertiser_, and nobody told me. I'd  always been used to fishing there, and I never thought but what it was  all right to keep on. I know I ought to have remembered and asked you,  but truly, sir, I didn't mean to steal your fish. I used to sell them  over at the hotels. We saw the notice today, Mother and me, and I came  right up. I've brought you the trout I caught this morning, and--if  only you won't prosecute me, sir, I'll pay back every cent I got for  the others--every cent, sir--if you'll give me time.\"    Mr. Walters passed his hand across his mouth to conceal something like  a smile.    \"Your name is Dan Phillips, isn't it?\" he said irrelevantly, \"and you  live with your mother, the Widow Phillips, down there at Carleton  Corners, I understand.\"    \"Yes, sir,\" said Dan, wondering how Mr. Walters knew so much about  him, and if these were the preliminaries of prosecution.    Mr. Walters took up his pen and drew a blank sheet towards him.    \"Well, Dan, I put that notice in because I found that many people who  used to fish on my pond, irrespective of leave or licence, were  accustomed to lunch or camp on my property, and did not a little  damage. I don't care for trouting myself; I've no time for it.  However, I hardly think you'll do much damage. You can keep on  fishing there. I'll give you a written permission, so that if any of  my men see you they won't interfere with you. As for these trout here,  I'll buy them from you at Mosquito Lake prices, and will say no more  about the matter. How will that do?\"    \"Thank you, sir,\" stammered Dan. He could hardly believe his ears. He  took the slip of paper Mr. Walters handed to him and rose to his feet.    \"Wait a minute, Dan. How was it you came to tell me this? You might  have stopped your depredations, and I should not have been any the  wiser.\"    \"That wouldn't have been honest, sir,\" said Dan, looking squarely at  him.    There was a brief silence. Mr. Walters thrummed meditatively on the  table. Dan waited wonderingly.    Finally the factory owner said abruptly, \"There's a vacant place for a  boy down here. I want it filled as soon as possible. Will you take  it?\"    \"Mr. Walters! _Me!_\" Dan thought the world must be turning upside  down.    \"Yes, you. You are rather young, but the duties are not hard or  difficult to learn. I think you'll do. I was"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/24875"],[0,"Lucy Maud Montgomery Short Stories, 1904 (#2)"],[1,"to go home  to him and Jack and our new mother. So I did, although at first I was  very sorry to leave Auntie and the dear old ship and all our lovely  wanderings.\"    \"Oh, tell me all about them,\" demanded Nan. \"Why, Florrie Hamilton, to  think you've never said a word about your wonderful experiences! I  love to hear about foreign countries from people who have really been  there. Please just talk--and I'll listen and ask questions.\"    Florrie did talk. I'm not sure whether she or Nan was the more  surprised to find that she could talk so well and describe her travels  so brightly and humorously. The afternoon passed quickly, and when  Florrie went away at dusk, after a dainty tea served up in Nan's room,  it was with a cordial invitation to come again soon.    \"I've enjoyed your visit so much,\" said Nan sincerely. \"I'm going down  to see you as soon as I can walk. But don't wait for that. Let us be  good, chummy friends without any ceremony.\"    When Florrie, with a light heart and a happy smile, had gone, came  Maude, sunburned and glowing from her picnic.    \"Such a nice time as we had!\" she exclaimed. \"Wasn't I sorry to think  of you cooped up here! Did Florrie come?\"    \"One Florrie did. Maude, you addressed that note to Florrie Hamilton  today instead of Florrie Hastings.\"    \"Nan, surely not! I'm sure--\"    \"Yes, you did. And she came here. Was I not taken aback at first,  Maude!\"    \"I was thinking about her when I addressed it, and I must have put her  name down by mistake. I'm so sorry--\"    \"You needn't be. I haven't been entertained so charmingly for a long  while. Why, Maude, she has travelled almost everywhere--and is so  bright and witty when she thaws out. She didn't seem like the same  girl at all. She is just perfectly lovely!\"    \"Well, I'm glad you had such a nice time together. Do you know, some  of the girls were very much vexed because she wasn't asked to the  picnic. They said that it was sheer rudeness not to ask her, and that  it reflected on us all, even if Patty and Wilhelmina were responsible  for it. I'm afraid we girls at Miss Braxton's have been getting  snobbish, and some of us are beginning to find it out and be ashamed  of it.\"    \"Just wait until school opens,\" said Nan--vaguely enough, it would  seem. But Maude understood.    However, they did not have to wait until school opened. Long before  that time Winboro girlhood discovered that the Wallace girls were  taking Florrie Hamilton into their lives. If the Wallace girls liked  her, there must be something in the girl more than was at first  thought--thus more than one of Miss Braxton's girls reasoned. And  gradually the other girls found, as Nan had found, that Florrie was  full of fun and an all-round good companion when drawn out of her  diffidence. When Miss Braxton's school reopened Florrie was the class  favourite. Between her and Nan Wallace a beautiful and helpful  friendship had been formed which was to grow and deepen through their  whole lives.    \"And all because Maude in a fit of abstraction wrote 'Hamilton' for  'Hastings,'\" said Nan to herself one day. But that is something  Florrie Hamilton will never know.          An Unpremeditated Ceremony      Selwyn Grant sauntered in upon the assembled family at the homestead  as if he were returning from an hour's absence instead of a western  sojourn of ten years. Guided by the sound of voices on the still,  pungent autumnal air, he went around to the door of the dining room  which opened directly on the poppy walk in the garden.    Nobody noticed him for a moment and he stood in the doorway looking at  them with a smile, wondering what was the reason of the festal air  that hung about them all as visibly as a garment. His mother sat by  the table, industriously polishing the best silver spoons, which, as  he remembered, were only brought forth upon some great occasion. Her  eyes were as bright, her form as erect, her nose--the Carston  nose--as pronounced and aristocratic as of yore.    Selwyn saw little change in her. But was it possible that the tall,  handsome young lady with the sleek brown pompadour and a nose  unmistakably and plebeianly Grant, who sat by the window doing  something to a heap of lace and organdy in her lap, was the little  curly-headed, sunburned sister of thirteen whom he remembered? The  young man leaning against the sideboard must be Leo, of course; a  fine-looking, broad-shouldered young fellow who made Selwyn think  suddenly that he must be growing old. And there was the little, thin,  grey father in the corner, peering at his newspaper with nearsighted  eyes. Selwyn's heart gave a bound at the sight of him which not even  his mother had caused. Dear old Dad! The years had been kind to him.    Mrs. Grant held up a glistening spoon and surveyed it complacently.  \"There, I think that is bright enough even to suit Margaret Graham. I  shall take over the whole two dozen teas and one dozen desserts. I  wish, Bertha, that you would tie a red cord around each of the handles  for me. The Carmody spoons are the same pattern and I shall always be  convinced that Mrs. Carmody carried off two of ours the time that  Jenny Graham was married. I don't mean to take any more risks. And,  Father----\"    Something made the mother look around, and she saw her first-born!    When the commotion was over Selwyn asked why the family spoons were  being rubbed up.    \"For the wedding, of course,\" said Mrs. Grant, polishing her  gold-bowed spectacles and deciding that there was no more time for  tears and sentiment just then. \"And there, they're not half done--and  we'll have to dress in another hour. Bertha is no earthly use--she is  so taken up with her bridesmaid finery.\"    \"Wedding? Whose wedding?\" demanded Selwyn, in bewilderment.    \"Why, Leo's, of course. Leo is to be married tonight. Didn't you get  your invitation? Wasn't that what brought you home?\"    \"Hand me a chair, quick,\" implored Selwyn. \"Leo, are _you_ going to  commit matrimony in this headlong fashion? Are you sure you're grown  up?\"    \"Six feet is a pretty good imitation of it, isn't it?\" grinned Leo.  \"Brace up, old fellow. It's not so bad as it might be. She's quite a  respectable girl. We wrote you all about it three weeks ago and broke  the news as gently as possible.\"    \"I left for the East a month ago and have been wandering around  preying on old college chums ever since. Haven't seen a letter. There,  I'm better now. No, you needn't fan me, Sis. Well, no family can get  through the world without its seasons of tribulations. Who is the  party of the second part, little brother?\"    \"Alice Graham,\" replied Mrs. Grant, who had a habit of speaking for  her children, none of whom had the Carston nose.    \"Alice Graham! That child!\" exclaimed Selwyn in astonishment.    Leo roared. \"Come, come, Sel, perhaps we're not very progressive here  in Croyden, but we don't actually stand still. Girls are apt to  stretch out some between ten and twenty, you know. You old bachelors  think nobody ever grows up. Why, Sel, you're grey around your  temples.\"    \"Too well I know it, but a man's own brother shouldn't be the first to  cast such things up to him. I'll admit, since I come to think of it,  that Alice has probably grown bigger. Is she any better-looking than  she used to be?\"    \"Alice is a charming girl,\" said Mrs. Grant impressively. \"She is a  beauty and she is also sweet and sensible, which beauties are not  always. We are all very much pleased with Leo's choice. But we have  really no more time to spare just now. The wedding is at seven o'clock  and it is four already.\"    \"Is there anybody you can send to the station for my luggage?\" asked  Selwyn. \"Luckily I have a new suit, otherwise I shouldn't have the  face to go.\"    \"Well, I must be off,\" said Mrs. Grant. \"Father, take Selwyn away so  that I shan't be tempted to waste time talking to him.\"    In the library father and son looked at each other affectionately.    \"Dad, it's a blessing to see you just the same. I'm a little dizzy  with all these changes. Bertha grown up and Leo within an inch of  being married! To Alice Graham at that, whom I can't think of yet as  anything else than the long-legged, black-eyed imp of mischief she  was when a kiddy. To tell you the truth, Dad, I don't feel in a mood  for going to a wedding at Wish-ton-wish tonight. I'm sure you don't  either. You've always hated fusses. Can't we shirk it?\"    They smiled at each other with chummy remembrance of many a family  festival they had \"shirked\" together in the old days. But Mr. Grant  shook his head. \"Not this time, sonny. There are some things a decent  man can't shirk and one of them is his own boy's wedding. It's a  nuisance, but I must go through with it. You'll understand how it is  when you're a family man yourself. By the way, why aren't you a family  man by this time? Why haven't I been put to the bother and  inconvenience of attending your wedding before now, son?\"    Selwyn laughed, with a little vibrant note of bitterness in the  laughter, which the father's quick ears detected. \"I've been too busy  with law books, Dad, to find me a wife.\"    Mr. Grant shook his bushy grey head. \"That's not the real reason, son.  The world has a wife for every man; if he hasn't found her by the time  he's thirty-five, there's some real reason for it. Well, I don't want  to pry into yours, but I hope it's a sound one and not a mean,  sneaking, selfish sort of reason. Perhaps you'll choose a Madam Selwyn  some day yet. In case you should I'm going to give you a small bit of  good advice. Your mother--now, she's a splendid woman, Selwyn, a  splendid woman. She can't be matched as a housekeeper and she has  improved my finances until I don't know them when I meet them. She's  been a good wife and a good mother. If I were a young man I'd court  her and marry her over again, that I would. But, son, when _you_ pick  a wife pick one with a nice little commonplace"]]]
