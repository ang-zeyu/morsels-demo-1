The old man now went into the other room to fetch preserves, apples,  and nuts;--yes, it was delightful over there in the old house.    \"I cannot bear it any longer!\" said the pewter soldier, who sat on the  drawers; \"it is so lonely and melancholy here! but when one has been  in a family circle one cannot accustom oneself to this life! I cannot  bear it any longer! the whole day is so long, and the evenings are  still longer! here it is not at all as it is over the way at your  home, where your father and mother spoke so pleasantly, and where you  and all your sweet children made such a delightful noise. Nay, how  lonely the old man is!--do you think that he gets kisses? do you think  he gets mild eyes, or a Christmas tree?--He will get nothing but a  grave.--I can bear it no longer!\"    \"You must not let it grieve you so much,\" said the little boy; \"I find  it so very delightful here, and then all the old thoughts, with what  they may bring with them, they come and visit here.\"    \"Yes, it's all very well, but I see nothing of them, and I don't know  them!\" said the pewter soldier, \"I cannot bear it!\"    \"But you must!\" said the little boy.    Then in came the old man with the most pleased and happy face, the  most delicious preserves, apples, and nuts, and so the little boy  thought no more about the pewter soldier.    The little boy returned home happy and pleased, and weeks and days  passed away, and nods were made to the old house, and from the old  house, and then the little boy went over there again.    The carved trumpeters blew, \"trateratra! there is the little boy!  trateratra!\" and the swords and armor on the knights' portraits  rattled, and the silk gowns rustled; the hog's-leather spoke, and the  old chairs had the gout in their legs and rheumatism in their backs:  Ugh!--it was exactly like the first time, for over there one day and  hour was just like another.    \"I cannot bear it!\" said the pewter soldier, \"I have shed pewter  tears! it is too melancholy! rather let me go to the wars and lose  arms and legs! it would at least be a change. I cannot bear it  longer!--Now, I know what it is to have a visit from one's old  thoughts, with what they may bring with them! I have had a visit from  mine, and you may be sure it is no pleasant thing in the end; I was at  last about to jump down from the drawers.    \"I saw you all over there at home so distinctly, as if you really were  here; it was again that Sunday morning; all you children stood before  the table and sung your Psalms, as you do every morning. You stood  devoutly with folded hands; and father and mother were just as pious;  and then the door was opened, and little sister Mary, who is not two  years old yet, and who always dances when she hears music or singing,  of whatever kind it may be, was put into the room--though she ought  not to have been there--and then she began to dance, but could not  keep time, because the tones were so long; and then she stood, first  on the one leg, and bent her head forwards, and then on the other leg,  and bent her head forwards--but all would not do. You stood very  seriously all together, although it was difficult enough; but I  laughed to myself, and then I fell off the table, and got a bump,  which I have still--for it was not right of me to laugh. But the whole  now passes before me again in thought, and everything that I have  lived to see; and these are the old thoughts, with what they may bring  with them.    \"Tell me if you still sing on Sundays? Tell me something about little  Mary! and how my comrade, the other pewter soldier, lives! Yes, he is  happy enough, that's sure! I cannot bear it any longer!\"    \"You are given away as a present!\" said the little boy; \"you must  remain. Can you not understand that?\"    The old man now came with a drawer, in which there was much to be  seen, both \"tin boxes\" and \"balsam boxes,\" old cards, so large and so  gilded, such as one never sees them now. And several drawers were  opened, and the piano was opened; it had landscapes on the inside of  the lid, and it was so hoarse when the old man played on it! and then  he hummed a song.    \"Yes, she could sing that!\" said he, and nodded to the portrait, which  he had bought at the broker's, and the old man's eyes shone so bright!    \"I will go to the wars! I will go to the wars!\" shouted the pewter  soldier as loud as he could, and threw himself off the drawers right  down on the floor.    What became of him? The old man sought, and the little boy sought; he  was away, and he stayed away.    \"I shall find him!\" said the old man; but he never found him. The  floor was too open--the pewter soldier had fallen through a crevice,  and there he lay as in an open tomb.    That day passed, and the little boy went home, and that week passed,  and several weeks too. The windows were quite frozen, the little boy  was obliged to sit and breathe on them to get a peep-hole over to the  old house, and there the snow had been blown into all the carved work  and inscriptions; it lay quite up over the steps, just as if there was  no one at home;--nor was there any one at home--the old man was dead!    In the evening there was a hearse seen before the door, and he was  borne into it in his coffin: he was now to go out into the country, to  lie in his grave. He was driven out there, but no one followed; all  his friends were dead, and the little boy kissed his hand to the  coffin as it was driven away.    Some days afterwards there was an auction at the old house, and the  little boy saw from his window how they carried the old knights and  the old ladies away, the flower-pots with the long ears, the old  chairs, and the old clothes-presses. Something came here, and  something came there; the portrait of her who had been found at the  broker's came to the broker's again; and there it hung, for no one  knew her more--no one cared about the old picture.    In the spring they pulled the house down, for, as people said, it was  a ruin. One could see from the street right into the room with the  hog's-leather hanging, which was slashed and torn; and the green grass  and leaves about the balcony hung quite wild about the falling  beams.--And then it was put to rights.    \"That was a relief,\" said the neighboring houses.       * * * * *      A fine house was built there, with large windows, and smooth white  walls; but before it, where the old house had in fact stood, was a  little garden laid out, and a wild grapevine ran up the wall of the  neighboring house. Before the garden there was a large iron railing  with an iron door, it looked quite splendid, and people stood still  and peeped in, and the sparrows hung by scores in the vine, and  chattered away at each other as well as they could, but it was not  about the old house, for they could not remember it, so many years had  passed,--so many that the little boy had grown up to a whole man, yes,  a clever man, and a pleasure to his parents; and he had just been  married, and, together with his little wife, had come to live in the  house here, where the garden was; and he stood by her there whilst she  planted a field-flower that she found so pretty; she planted it with  her little hand, and pressed the earth around it with her fingers. Oh!  what was that? She had stuck herself. There sat something pointed,  straight out of the soft mould.    It was----yes, guess!--it was the pewter soldier, he that was lost up  at the old man's, and had tumbled and turned about amongst the timber  and the rubbish, and had at last laid for many years in the ground.    The young wife wiped the dirt off the soldier, first with a green  leaf, and then with her fine handkerchief--it had such a delightful  smell, that it was to the pewter soldier just as if he had awaked from  a trance.    \"Let me see him,\" said the young man. He laughed, and then shook his  head. \"Nay, it cannot be he; but he reminds me of a story about a  pewter soldier which I had when I was a little boy!\" And then he told  his wife about the old house, and the old man, and about the pewter  soldier that he sent over to him because he was so very, very lonely;  and he told it as correctly as it had really been, so that the tears  came into the eyes of his young wife, on account of the old house and  the old man.    \"It may possibly be, however, that it is the same pewter soldier!\"  said she, \"I will take care of it, and remember all that you have told  me; but you must show me the old man's grave!\"    \"But I do not know it,\" said he, \"and no one knows it! all his friends  were dead, no one took care of it, and I was then a little boy!\"    \"How very, very lonely he must have been!\" said she.    \"Very, very lonely!\" said the pewter soldier; \"but it is delightful  not to be forgotten!\"    \"Delightful!\" shouted something close by; but no one, except the  pewter soldier, saw that it was a piece of the hog's-leather hangings;  it had lost all its gilding, it looked like a piece of wet clay, but  it had an opinion, and it gave it:        \"The gilding decays,      But hog's leather stays!\"    This the pewter soldier did not believe.      ------------        THE DROP OF WATER.    What a magnifying glass is, you surely know--such a round sort of  spectacle-glass that makes everything full a hundred times larger than  it really is. When one holds it before the eye, and looks at a drop of  water out of the pond, then one sees above a thousand strange  creatures. It looks almost like a whole plateful of shrimps springing  about among each other, and they are so ravenous, they tear one  another's arms and legs, tails and sides, and yet they are glad and  pleased in their way.    Now, there was once an old man, who was called by every body  Creep-and-Crawl; for that was his name. He would always make the best  out of everything, and when he could not make anything out of it he  resorted to witchcraft.    Now, one"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/31111"],[0,"Across Asia on a Bicycle (#2)"],[1," morning early in April the little steamer conveying us across from  Stamboul touched the wharf at Haider Pasha. Amid the rabble of Greeks,  Armenians, Turks, and Italians we trundled our bicycles across the  gang-plank, which for us was the threshold of Asia, the beginning of an  inland journey of seven thousand miles from the Bosporus to the Pacific.  Through the morning fog which enveloped the shipping in the Golden Horn,  the \"stars and stripes\" at a single masthead were waving farewell to two  American students fresh from college who had nerved themselves for nearly  two years of separation from the comforts of western civilization.    Our guide to the road to Ismid was the little twelve-year-old son of an  Armenian doctor, whose guests we had been during our sojourn in Stamboul.  He trotted for some distance by our side, and then, pressing our hands in  both of his, he said with childlike sincerity: \"I hope God will take care  of you\"; for he was possessed with the thought popular among Armenians, of  pillages and massacres by marauding brigands.    The idea of a trip around the world had been conceived by us as a  practical finish to a theoretical education; and the bicycle feature was  adopted merely as a means to that end. On reaching London we had formed  the plan of penetrating the heart of the Asiatic continent, instead of  skirting its more civilized coast-line. For a passport and other  credentials necessary in journeying through Russia and Central Asia we had  been advised to make application to the Czar's representative on our  arrival at Teheran, as we would enter the Russian dominions from Persia;  and to that end the Russian minister in London had provided us with a  letter of introduction. In London the secretary of the Chinese legation, a  Scotchman, had assisted us in mapping out a possible route across the  Celestial empire, although he endeavored, from the very start, to dissuade  us from our purpose. Application had then been made to the Chinese  minister himself for the necessary passport. The reply we received, though  courteous, smacked strongly of reproof. \"Western China,\" he said, \"is  overrun with lawless bands, and the people themselves are very much averse  to foreigners. Your extraordinary mode of locomotion would subject you to  annoyance, if not to positive danger, at the hands of a people who are  naturally curious and superstitious. However,\" he added, after some  reflection, \"if your minister makes a request for a passport we will see  what can be done. The most I can do will be to ask for you the protection  and assistance of the officials only; for the people themselves I cannot  answer. If you go into that country you do so at your own risk.\" Minister  Lincoln was sitting in his private office when we called the next morning  at the American legation. He listened to the recital of our plans, got  down the huge atlas from his bookcase, and went over with us the route we  proposed to follow. He did not regard the undertaking as feasible, and  apprehended that, if he should give his official assistance, he would, in  a measure, be responsible for the result if it should prove unhappy. When  assured of the consent of our parents, and of our determination to make  the attempt at all hazards, he picked up his pen and began a letter to the  Chinese minister, remarking as he finished reading it to us, \"I would much  rather not have written it.\" The documents received from the Chinese  minister in response to Mr. Lincoln's letter proved to be indispensable  when, a year and a half later, we left the last outpost of western  civilization and plunged into the Gobi desert. When we had paid a final  visit to the Persian minister in London, who had asked to see our bicycles  and their baggage equipments, he signified his intention of writing in our  behalf to friends in Teheran; and to that capital, after cycling through  Europe, we were now actually _en route_.    Since the opening of the Trans-Bosporus Railway, the wagon-road to Ismid,  and even the Angora military highway beyond, have fallen rapidly into  disrepair. In April they were almost impassable for the wheel, so that for  the greater part of the way we were obliged to take to the track. Like the  railway skirting the Italian Riviera, and the Patras-Athens line along the  Saronic Gulf, this Trans-Bosporus road for a great distance scarps and  tunnels the cliffs along the Gulf of Ismid, and sometimes runs so close to  the water's edge that the puffing of the _kara vapor_ or \"land steamer,\"  as the Turks call it, is drowned by the roaring breakers. The country  between Scutari and Ismid surpasses in agricultural advantages any part of  Asiatic Turkey through which we passed. Its fertile soil, and the  luxuriant vegetation it supports, are, as we afterward learned, in  striking contrast with the sterile plateaus and mountains of the interior,  many parts of which are as desolate as the deserts of Arabia. In area,  Asia Minor equals France, but the water-supply of its rivers is only one  third.      [Illustration: BICYCLE ROUTE OF Messrs. Allen & Sachtleben ACROSS    ASIA.]    One of the principal agents in the work of transforming Asia Minor is the  railroad, to which the natives have taken with unusual readiness. The  locomotive is already competing with the hundred and sixty thousand camels  employed in the peninsula caravan-trade. At Geiveh, the last station on  the Trans-Bosporus Railway, where we left the track to follow the Angora  highway, the \"ships of the desert\" are beginning to transfer their cargoes  to the \"land steamer,\" instead of continuing on as in former days to the  Bosporus.      [Illustration: THE DONKEY BOYS INSPECT THE \"DEVIL'S CARRIAGE.\"]    The Trans-Bosporus line, in the year of our visit, was being built and  operated by a German company, under the direct patronage of the Sultan. We  ventured to ask some natives if they thought the Sultan had sufficient  funds to consummate so gigantic a scheme, and they replied, with the  deepest reverence: \"God has given the Padishah much property and power,  and certainly he must give him enough money to utilize it.\"    A week's cycling from the Bosporus brought us beyond the Allah Dagh  mountains, among the barren, variegated hills that skirt the Angora  plateau. We had already passed through Ismid, the ancient Nicomedia and  capital of Diocletian; and had left behind us the heavily timbered valley  of the Sakaria, upon whose banks the \"Freebooter of the Bithynian hills\"  settled with his four hundred tents and laid the foundation of the Ottoman  empire. Since leaving Geiveh we had been attended by a mounted guard, or  _zaptieh_, who was sometimes forced upon us by the authorities in their  anxiety to carry out the wishes expressed in the letters of the Grand  Vizir. On emerging from the door of an inn we frequently found this  unexpected guard waiting with a Winchester rifle swung over his shoulder,  and a fleet steed standing by his side. Immediately on our appearance he  would swing into the saddle and charge through the assembled rabble. Away  we would go at a rapid pace down the streets of the town or village, to  the utter amazement of the natives and the great satisfaction of our  vainglorious zaptieh. As long as his horse was fresh, or until we were out  of sight of the village, he would urge us on with cries of \"Gellcha-buk\"  (\"Come on, ride fast\"). When a bad piece of road or a steep ascent forced  us to dismount he would bring his horse to a walk, roll a cigarette, and  draw invidious comparisons between our steeds. His tone, however, changed  when we reached a decline or long stretch of reasonably good road. Then he  would cut across country to head us off, or shout after us at the top of  his voice, \"Yavash-yavash\" (\"Slowly, slowly\"). On the whole we found them  good-natured and companionable fellows, notwithstanding their interest in  _baksheesh_ which we were compelled at last, in self-defense, to fix at  one piaster an hour. We frequently shared with them our frugal, and even  scanty meals; and in turn they assisted us in our purchases and  arrangements for lodgings, for their word, we found, was with the common  people an almost unwritten law. Then, too, they were of great assistance  in crossing streams where the depth would have necessitated the stripping  of garments; although their fiery little steeds sometimes objected to  having an extra rider astride their haunches, and a bicycle across their  shoulders. They seized every opportunity to impress us with the necessity  of being accompanied by a government representative. In some lonely  portion of the road, or in the suggestive stillness of an evening  twilight, our Turkish Don Quixote would sometimes cast mysterious glances  around him, take his Winchester from his shoulder, and throwing it across  the pommel of his saddle, charge ahead to meet the imaginary enemy. But we  were more harmful than harmed, for, despite our most vigilant care, the  bicycles were sometimes the occasion of a stampede or runaway among the  caravans and teams along the highway, and we frequently assisted in  replacing the loads thus upset. On such occasions our pretentious cavalier  would remain on his horse, smoking his cigarette and smiling disdainfully.      [Illustration: HELPING A TURK WHOSE HORSES RAN AWAY AT SIGHT OF OUR    BICYCLES.]    It was in the company of one of these military champions that we emerged  on the morning of April 12 upon the plateau of Angora. On the spring  pasture were feeding several flocks of the famous Angora goats, and the  _karamanli_ or fat-tailed sheep, tended by the Yurak shepherds and their  half-wild and monstrous collies, whose half-savage nature fits them to  cope with the jackals which infest the country. The shepherds did not  check their sudden onslaught upon us until we were pressed to very close  quarters, and had drawn our revolvers in self-defense. These Yuraks"]]]
