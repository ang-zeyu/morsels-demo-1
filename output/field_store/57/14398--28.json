In whatsoever ways I shall find you, in them shall I judge you  entirely: so cries the End of all things. And he who hath at first  lived a virtuous lift, but towards the latter end falls into vice, these  labors by him before endured shall be altogether vain and unprofitable,  even as in a play, brought to an ill catastrophe. Whosoever shall have  lived wickedly and luxuriously may repent; however, there will be need  of much time to conquer an evil habit, and even after repentance his  whole life must be guarded with great care and diligence, after the  manner of a body, which, after it hath been a long time afflicted with a  distemper, requires a stricter diet and method of living; for though  it may be possible, perhaps, to break off the chain of our irregular  affections at once, yet our amendment cannot be secured without the  grace of God, the prayers of good men, the help of the brethren, and our  own sincere repentance and constant care. It is a good thing not to sin  at all; it is also good, having sinned, to repent; as it is best to have  health always, but it is a good thing to recover from a distemper. To  God be glory and dominion for ever and ever Amen."]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/2848"],[0,"Antiquities of the Jews (#2)"],[1,"He Took From Them.    CHAPTER 6.
