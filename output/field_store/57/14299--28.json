CHAPTER I.    OF MATERIALS AND IMPLEMENTS USED IN MODERN EMBROIDERY.      IMPLEMENTS.    _Needles._--The best \"embroidery needles\" for ordinary crewel handwork  are Nos. 5 and 6. For coarse \"sailcloth,\" \"flax,\" or \"oatcake,\" No. 4.  For frame embroidery, or very fine handwork, the higher numbers, from  7 to 10.    It is a mistake to use too fine a needle. The thread of crewel or silk  should always be able to pass loosely into the eye, so as not to  require any pulling to carry it through the material.           *       *       *       *       *    _Scissors_ should be finely pointed, and very sharp.           *       *       *       *       *    _Thimbles_ which have been well worn, and are therefore smooth, are  best. Some workers prefer ivory or vulcanite. Two thimbles should be  used for framework.           *       *       *       *       *    _Prickers_ are necessary for piercing holes in gold embroidery, and  also for arranging the lie of the thread in some forms of couching.    [Decoration]      [Decoration]    MATERIALS.    CREWELS, AND HOW TO USE THEM.    _Crewel_ should be cut into short threads, never more than half the  length of the skein. If a long needleful is used, it is not only apt  to pull the work, but is very wasteful, as the end of it is liable to  become frayed or knotted before it is nearly worked up. If it is  necessary to use it double (and for coarse work, such as screen panels  on sailcloth, or for embroidering on Utrecht velvet, it is generally  better doubled), care should be taken never to pass it through the eye  of the needle, knotting the two ends; but two separate threads of the  length required should be passed together through the needle.    Crewel should not be manufactured with a twist, as it makes the  embroidery appear hard and rigid; and the shades of colour do not  blend into each other so harmoniously as when they are untwisted.    In crewels of the best quality the colours are perfectly fast, and  will bear being repeatedly washed, provided no soda or washing-powder  is used. Directions for cleaning crewel work are given later; but it  should not be sent to an ordinary laundress, who will most certainly  ruin the colours.    Crewel is suitable for embroidery on all kinds of linen--on plain or  diagonal cloth, serge, flannel, &c. It is also very effective when  used in conjunction with embroidery silk, or filoselle, either in  conventional designs, or where flowers are introduced. The leaves may  be worked in crewels, and the flowers in silk, or the effect of the  crewels increased by merely touching up the high lights with silk.           *       *       *       *       *    _Tapestry Wool_ is more than twice the thickness of crewel, and is  used for screen panels, or large curtain borders, where the work is  coarse, and a good deal of ground has to be covered. It is also used  for bath blankets and carriage and sofa rugs. Tapestry wool is not yet  made in all shades.    Fine crewels are used for delicately working small figures, d'oyleys,  &c.; but there is also a difficulty about obtaining these in all  shades, as there is not much demand for them at present.           *       *       *       *       *    _Arrasene_ is a new material. It is a species of worsted chenille, but  is not twisted round fine wire or silk, like ordinary chenille; though  it is woven first into a fabric, and then cut in the same manner. It  serves to produce broad effects for screen panels, or borders, and has  a very soft, rich appearance when carefully used. It is made also in  silk; but this is inferior to worsted arrasene, or the old-fashioned  chenille.      [Decoration]    SILKS.    _\"Embroidery,\" or Bobbin Silk_, which has now almost superseded  floss, is used for working on satin and silk, or for any fine work. It  is made in strands, each of which has a slight twist in it to prevent  its fraying as floss does. As this silk is required in all varieties  of thickness, it is manufactured in what is technically called \"rope,\"  that is, with about twelve strands in each thread. When not \"rope\"  silk, it is in single strands, and is then called \"fine\" silk. As it  is almost always necessary to use several strands, and these in  varying number, according to the embroidery in hand, the rope silk has  to be divided, or the fine doubled or trebled, as the case may be.    If rope silk is being used, the length required for a needleful must  be cut and passed carefully between finger and thumb once or twice,  that it may not be twisted. It should then be carefully separated into  the number of strands most suitable for the embroidery in hand; for  ordinary work three is about the best number.    These must be threaded together through the needle, care being taken  not to tangle the piece of \"rope\" from which they have been detached.  There need be no waste if this operation is carefully done, as good  silk will always divide into strands without fraying.    In using \"fine silk,\" one length must be cut first, then other strands  laid on it,--as many as are needed to form the thickness required.  They should be carefully laid in the same direction as they leave the  reel or card. If placed carelessly backwards and forwards, they are  sure to fray, and will not work evenly together. With silk still more  than with crewel, it is necessary to thread all the strands through  the needle together, never to double one back, and never to make a  knot.    It is intended in future to do away with this distinction between  \"rope\" and \"fine\" silk, and to have it all manufactured of one uniform  thickness, which will consist of eight strands of the same quality as  the \"fine\" silk at present in use. As it will, however, still be  necessary to divide the thread, and even perhaps occasionally to  double it, the directions given above will be useful.           *       *       *       *       *    _Purse Silk_ is used sometimes for diapering, and in rare cases in  ordinary embroidery, where a raised effect is required.           *       *       *       *       *    _Raw_ or _spun silk_ is a soft untwisted cream-coloured silk, used for  daisies and other simple white flowers, or in outlining. It is much  cheaper than embroidery silk or filoselle.           *       *       *       *       *    _Vegetable Silk_ (so-called) is not used or sold by the Royal School.           *       *       *       *       *    _Filoselle_, when of good quality, is not, as some people suppose, a  mixture of silk and cotton. It is pure silk, but of an inferior  quality; and therefore cheaper. It answers many of the purposes of  bobbin silk, but is not suitable for fine embroidery on silk or satin  fabrics. It should be used also in strands, and the same remarks hold  good with regard to its not being doubled, but cut in equal lengths.           *       *       *       *       *    _Tussore._--Interesting experiments have recently been made with the  \"Tussore,\" or \"wild silk\" of India, which bids fair to create a  revolution in embroidery. Not only can it be produced for less than  half the price of the \"cultivated silk\" of Italy, China, or Japan, but  it also takes the most delicate dyes with a softness that gives a  peculiarly charming effect. It can scarcely be said to be in the  market as yet, but in all probability before this work is through the  press it will have become an important element in decorative  needlework. It is much less glossy than cultivated silk.    [Decoration]      [Decoration]    GOLD THREAD, &c.    \"_Japanese gold thread_,\" which has the advantage of never tarnishing,  is now extremely difficult to obtain. Being made of gilt paper twisted  round cotton thread, it cannot be drawn through the material by the  needle; but must in all cases be laid on, and stitched down with a  fine yellow silk, known as \"Maltese,\" or \"Horse-tail.\"           *       *       *       *       *    \"_Chinese gold_\" is manufactured in the same manner as the Japanese;  but being of a much redder colour is not so satisfactory in embroidery  unless a warm shade is desirable for a particular work.           *       *       *       *       *    _Gold and silver passing_, a very fine kind of thread, can either be  used for working through the material, or can be laid on like the  Japanese gold. They are suitable for \"raised gold or silver  embroidery.\"           *       *       *       *       *    _Bullion, or Purl_, is gold or silver wire made in a series of  continuous rings, like a corkscrew. It is used in ecclesiastical work,  for embroidering official and military uniforms, and for heraldic  designs.

The visions are so terribly distinct that I almost  imagine them to be real. Hour after hour I sit while the scenes are  being shifted; and as I gaze upon the panorama of the past, I realize  how crowded with incidents my life has been. Every day seems like a  romance within itself, and the years grow into ponderous volumes. As I  cannot condense, I must omit many strange passages in my history. From  such a wilderness of events it is difficult to make a selection, but as  I am not writing altogether the history of myself, I will confine my  story to the most important incidents which I believe influenced the  moulding of my character. As I glance over the crowded sea of the past,  these incidents stand forth prominently, the guide-posts of memory. I  presume that I must have been four years old when I first began to  remember; at least, I cannot now recall anything occurring previous to  this period. My master, Col. A. Burwell, was somewhat unsettled in his  business affairs, and while I was yet an infant he made several  removals. While living at Hampton Sidney College, Prince Edward County,  Va., Mrs. Burwell gave birth to a daughter, a sweet, black-eyed baby,  my earliest and fondest pet. To take care of this baby was my first  duty. True, I was but a child myself--only four years old--but then I  had been raised in a hardy school--had been taught to rely upon myself,  and to prepare myself to render assistance to others. The lesson was not  a bitter one, for I was too young to indulge in philosophy, and the  precepts that I then treasured and practised I believe developed those  principles of character which have enabled me to triumph over so many  difficulties. Notwithstanding all the wrongs that slavery heaped upon  me, I can bless it for one thing--youth's important lesson of  self-reliance. The baby was named Elizabeth, and it was pleasant to me  to be assigned a duty in connection with it, for the discharge of that  duty transferred me from the rude cabin to the household of my master.  My simple attire was a short dress and a little white apron. My old  mistress encouraged me in rocking the cradle, by telling me that if I  would watch over the baby well, keep the flies out of its face, and not  let it cry, I should be its little maid. This was a golden promise, and  I required no better inducement for the faithful performance of my task.  I began to rock the cradle most industriously, when lo! out pitched  little pet on the floor. I instantly cried out, \"Oh! the baby is on the  floor;\" and, not knowing what to do, I seized the fire-shovel in my  perplexity, and was trying to shovel up my tender charge, when my  mistress called to me to let the child alone, and then ordered that I be  taken out and lashed for my carelessness. The blows were not  administered with a light hand, I assure you, and doubtless the severity  of the lashing has made me remember the incident so well. This was the  first time I was punished in this cruel way, but not the last. The  black-eyed baby that I called my pet grew into a self-willed girl, and  in after years was the cause of much trouble to me. I grew strong and  healthy, and, notwithstanding I knit socks and attended to various kinds  of work, I was repeatedly told, when even fourteen years old, that I  would never be worth my salt. When I was eight, Mr. Burwell's family  consisted of six sons and four daughters, with a large family of  servants. My mother was kind and forbearing; Mrs. Burwell a hard  task-master; and as mother had so much work to do in making clothes,  etc., for the family, besides the slaves, I determined to render her all  the assistance in my power, and in rendering her such assistance my  young energies were taxed to the utmost. I was my mother's only child,  which made her love for me all the stronger. I did not know much of my  father, for he was the slave of another man, and when Mr. Burwell moved  from Dinwiddie he was separated from us, and only allowed to visit my  mother twice a year--during the Easter holidays and Christmas. At last  Mr. Burwell determined to reward my mother, by making an arrangement  with the owner of my father, by which the separation of my parents could  be brought to an end. It was a bright day, indeed, for my mother when it  was announced that my father was coming to live with us. The old weary  look faded from her face, and she worked as if her heart was in every  task. But the golden days did not last long. The radiant dream faded all  too soon.    In the morning my father called me to him and kissed me, then held me  out at arms' length as if he were regarding his child with pride. \"She  is growing into a large fine girl,\" he remarked to my mother. \"I dun no  which I like best, you or Lizzie, as both are so dear to me.\" My  mother's name was Agnes, and my father delighted to call me his \"Little  Lizzie.\" While yet my father and mother were speaking hopefully,  joyfully of the future, Mr. Burwell came to the cabin, with a letter in  his hand. He was a kind master in some things, and as gently as possible  informed my parents that they must part; for in two hours my father must  join his master at Dinwiddie, and go with him to the West, where he had  determined to make his future home. The announcement fell upon the  little circle in that rude-log cabin like a thunderbolt. I can remember  the scene as if it were but yesterday;--how my father cried out against  the cruel separation; his last kiss; his wild straining of my mother to  his bosom; the solemn prayer to Heaven; the tears and sobs--the fearful  anguish of broken hearts. The last kiss, the last good-by; and he, my  father, was gone, gone forever. The shadow eclipsed the sunshine, and  love brought despair. The parting was eternal. The cloud had no silver  lining, but I trust that it will be all silver in heaven. We who are  crushed to earth with heavy chains, who travel a weary, rugged, thorny  road, groping through midnight darkness on earth, earn our right to  enjoy the sunshine in the great hereafter. At the grave, at least, we  should be permitted to lay our burdens down, that a new world, a world  of brightness, may open to us. The light that is denied us here should  grow into a flood of effulgence beyond the dark, mysterious shadows of  death. Deep as was the distress of my mother in parting with my father,  her sorrow did not screen her from insult. My old mistress said to her:  \"Stop your nonsense; there is no necessity for you putting on airs. Your  husband is not the only slave that has been sold from his family, and  you are not the only one that has had to part. There are plenty more men  about here, and if you want a husband so badly, stop your crying and go  and find another.\" To these unfeeling words my mother made no reply. She  turned away in stoical silence, with a curl of that loathing scorn upon  her lips which swelled in her heart.    My father and mother never met again in this world. They kept up a  regular correspondence for years, and the most precious mementoes of my  existence are the faded old letters that he wrote, full of love, and  always hoping that the future would bring brighter days. In nearly every  letter is a message for me. \"Tell my darling little Lizzie,\" he writes,  \"to be a good girl, and to learn her book. Kiss her for me, and tell her  that I will come to see her some day.\" Thus he wrote time and again, but  he never came. He lived in hope, but died without ever seeing his wife  and child.    I note a few extracts from one of my father's letters to my mother,  following copy literally:        \"SHELBYVILE, Sept. 6, 1833.        \"MRS.
