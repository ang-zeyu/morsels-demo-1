Perhaps they were rude--for they cut me dead--      But what if they did?--I kept my head        And turned on my back and laughed in glee        At the thought of the good, good flour I'd be.    [Illustration]        I know I was good, yet the day came at last      When they said I'd be better if soundly thrashed.        Please pardon me here--I can't dwell on this much,        The subject is painful--my feelings are such.      Oh my! but the straw, it flew high in the air      And the chaff chaffed unceasing, but I didn't care,        My laughter rang forth with increased vim and zest,        My chastisement I knew--just meant Pillsbury's Best.    [Illustration]        And then came the time when I journeyed away      To the mills where the \"Roller Mills\" roll all day,        And all of them smiled with a happy grin        And welcomed us poor little wheatlets in;      Oh! the grind of life--I was grasped and seized,      I really can't say I was very much pleased;        But to say the least, I was much impressed,        And when I got through I was Pillsbury's Best.    [Illustration: The mills where the roller mills roll all day.]    [Illustration]        And now in the latest fashions gay      In the big round world I have my say,        For in this most becoming sack,        Please note the hang--both front and back,      I journey far from the land of my birth      To feed the hungry hordes of Earth;        For those who know ne'er fail to say        That Pillsbury's flour o'er the world holds sway.    [Illustration]        To the kitchen I go--to the bakers who bake      The bread and the cookies, the pies and the cake;        It was there that I met the package of yeast        Who raised the dough for the coming feast,      And that's why I sit and talk to-night,      For to-morrow I know I'll be out of sight;        So I'll toast myself ere this tale I close,        To Pillsbury's Best, the flour one knows.

Snails also were  used externally:         \"To anoint the Ricketed Childs Limbs and to recover it in a short       time, though the child be so lame as to go upon crutches:         \"Take a peck of Garden Snailes and bruse them, put them into a       course Canvass bagg, and hang it up, and set a dish under to       receive the liquor that droppeth from them, wherewith anoint the       Childe in every Joynt which you perceive to be weak before the fire       every morning and evening. This I have known make a Patient Childe       that was extream weak to go alone using it only a week time.\"    There were also \"unguents to anoynt the Ricketted Childs breast,\" and  various drinks to be given \"to the patient childe fasting,\" as they  termed him in what appears to us a half-comic, though wholly truthful  appellation.    For worms and fits there were some frightful doses of senna and rhubarb  and snails, with a slight redeeming admixture of prunes; and as for  \"Collick\" and \"Stomack-Ach,\" I feel sure every respectable Puritan  patient child died rather than swallow the disgusting and nauseous  compounds that were offered to him for his relief.    Puritan babies also wore medical ornaments, \"anodyne necklaces.\" I find  them advertised in the _Boston Evening Post_ as late as 1771--\"Anodine  Necklaces for the Easy breeding of Childrens Teeth,\" worn as nowadays  children wear strings of amber beads to avert croup.    Another medicine \"to make children's teeth come without paine\" was this:  \"Take the head of a Hare boyled a walm or two or roahed; and with the  braine thereof mingle Honey and butter and therewith anoynt the Childes  gums as often as you please.\" Still further advice was to scratch the  child's gums with an osprey bone, or to hang fawn's teeth or wolf's  fangs around his neck--an ugly necklace.    The first scene of gayety upon which the chilled baby opened his sad  eyes was when his mother was taken from her great bed and \"laid on a  pallat,\" and the heavy curtains and valances of harrateen or serge were  hung within and freshened with \"curteyns and vallants of cheney or  calico.\" Then, or a day or two later, the midwife, the nurses, and all  the neighboring women who had helped with advice or work in the  household during the first week or two of the child's life, were bidden  to a dinner. This was also a French fashion, as \"_Les Caquets de  l'Accouchee_,\" the popular book of the time of Louis XIII., proves.    Doubtless at this New England amphidromia the \"groaning beer\" was drunk,  though Sewall \"brewed my Wives Groaning Beer\" two months before the  child was born. By tradition, \"groaning cake,\" to be used at the time of  the birth of the child, and given to visitors for a week or two later,  also was made; but I find no allusion to it under that name in any of  the diaries of the times. At this women's dinner good substantial viands  were served. \"Women din'd with rost Beef and minc'd Pyes, good Cheese  and Tarts.\" When another Sewall baby was scarcely two weeks old,  seventeen women were dined at Judge Sewall's on equally solid meats,  \"Boil'd Pork, Beef, Fowls, very good Rost Beef, Turkey, Pye and Tarts.\"  Madam Downing gave her women \"plenty of sack and claret.\" A survival of  this custom existed for many years in the fashion of drinking caudle at  the bedside of the mother.    As might be expected of a man who diverted himself in attending the  dissection of an Indian, which gruesome gayety exhilarated him into  spending a tidy sum--for him--on drinks and feeing \"the maid;\" and in  visiting his family tomb; and who, when he took his wife on a pleasure  trip to Dorchester \"to eat cherries and rasberries,\" spent his entire  day within-doors reading that cheerful book, Calvin on Psalms;--in the  house of such a pleasure-seeker but small provision was made for the  entertainment or amusement of his children. They were sometimes led  solemnly to the house of some old, influential, or pious person, who  formally gave them his blessing. He took them also to some of the  funerals of the endless procession of dead Bostonians that files  sombrely through the pages of his diary, to the funeral of their baby  brother, little Stephen Sewall, when \"Sam and his sisters (who were  about five and six years old) cryed much coming home and at home, so  that I could hardly quiet them. It seems they looked into Tomb, and Sam  said he saw a great Coffin there, his Grandfathers.\" These were not the  only tears that Sam and Betty and Hannah shed through fear of death.  When Betty was a year older her father wrote:         \"It falls to my daughter Elizabeths Share to read the 24 of Isaiah       which she doth with many Tears not being very well, and the       Contents of the Chapter and Sympathy with her draw Tears from me       also.\"    Two days later, Sam, who was then about ten years old, also showed  evidence of the dejection of soul around him.         \"Richard Dumer, a flourishing youth of 9 years old dies of the       Small Pocks. I tell Sam of it and what need he had to prepare for       Death, and therefore to endeavor really to pray, when he said over       the Lord's Prayer: He seemed not much to mind, eating an Aple; but       when he came to say Our Father he burst out into a bitter Cry and       said he was afraid he should die. I pray'd with him and read       Scriptures comforting against Death, as O death where is thy sting,       &c. All things yours. Life and Immortality brought to light by       Christ.\"    In January, 1695, Judge Sewall writes:         \"When I came in, past 7 at night, my wife met me in the Entry and       told me Betty had surprised them. I was surprised with the       Abruptness of the Relation. It seems Betty Sewall had given some       signs of dejection and sorrow; but a little while after dinner she       burst out into an amazing cry, which caus'd all the family to cry       too; Her Mother ask'd the reason, she gave none; at last said she       was afraid she should goe to Hell, her Sins were not pardon'd. She       was first wounded by my reading a sermon of Mr. Norton's Text, Ye       shall seek me and shall not find me. And those words in the sermon,       Ye shall seek me and die in your Sins ran in her mind and terrified       her greatly. And staying at home she read out of Mr. Cotton       Mather--Why hath Satan filled thy Heart, which increased her Fear.       Her Mother asked her whether she pray'd. She answered yes but       fear'd her prayers were not heard because her sins were not       pardon'd.\"    A fortnight later he writes:         \"Betty comes into me as soon as I was up and tells me the disquiet       she had when wak'd; told me she was afraid she should go to Hell,       was like Spira, not Elected. Ask'd her what I should pray for, she       said that God would pardon her Sin and give her a new heart. I       answer'd her Fears as well as I could and pray'd with many Tears on       either part. Hope God heard us.\"    Three months later still he makes this entry:         \"Betty can hardly read her chapter for weeping, tells me she is       afraid she is gon back, does not taste that sweetness in reading       the Word which once she did; fears that what was once upon her is       worn off. I said what I could to her and in the evening pray'd with       her alone.\"    Poor little \"wounded\" Betty! She did not die in childhood as she feared,  but lived to pass through many gloomy hours of morbid introspection and  of overwhelming fear of death, to marry and become the mother of eight  children; but was always buffeted with fears and tormented with doubts,  which she despairingly communicated to her solemn and far from  comforting father; and at last she faced the dread foe Death at the age  of thirty-five. Judge Sewall wrote sadly the day of her funeral: \"I hope  God has delivered her now from all her fears;\" every one reading of her  bewildered and depressed spiritual life must sincerely hope so with him.  In truth, the Puritan children were, as Judge Sewall said, \"stirred up  dreadfully to seek God.\"    Here is the way that one of Sewall's neighbors taught his little  daughter when she was four years old:         \"I took my little daughter Katy into my Study and there I told my       child That I am to Dy Shortly and Shee must, when I am Dead,       Remember every Thing, that I now said unto her. I sett before her       the sinful condition of her Nature and I charged her to pray in       secret places every day. That God for the sake of Jesus Christ       would give her a New Heart. I gave her to understand that when I am       taken from her she must look to meet with more Humbling       Afflictions than she does now she has a Tender Father to provide       for her.\"    I hardly understand why Cotton Mather, who was really very gentle to his  children, should have taken upon himself to trouble this tender little  blossom with dread of his death. He lived thirty years longer, and,  indeed, survived sinful little Katy. Another child of his "]]]
