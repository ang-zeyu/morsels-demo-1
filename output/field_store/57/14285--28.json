Because she wasn't angry, Daniel felt that she would make him a good  wife. Life in the wilderness was often difficult and dangerous. He  wanted a wife who did not become upset easily.    They were married, and soon the first of their many children arrived.  Daniel loved his children. As soon as his son James was old enough, he  taught him to hunt.    In the spring and summer Daniel would farm. In the autumn he hunted,  and in the winter he trapped. He made long trips in the forest and  brought home food for his family and valuable furs and deerskins. Many  of these he sold. He enjoyed exploring as much as he enjoyed hunting.  Once he even went as far south as Florida with the idea of settling  there. But he was disappointed in the land. He longed to explore  Kentucky, but did not want to go alone.    One day the Boone family heard a knock at the door. It was Boone's old  friend, John Finley.    \"Let's go to Kentucky, Daniel!\" he said.    \"Let's!\" Daniel agreed. \"I think about it all the time. You know how  much I love the wilderness. That's the one place I really feel at  home.\"          On to Kentucky      Early in 1769, Daniel Boone, John Finley, and four other strong men  started for Kentucky. One of the men was Daniel's brother-in-law. They  took their guns. They carried animal traps, too. They planned to bring  back skins and furs to sell.    The hunters rode their horses across the mountains. Soon they came to  Cumberland Gap, a narrow mountain valley which led into Kentucky. The  Indians used the Gap also, but the white men did not see any of them at  this time. It was weeks before they saw a single Indian.    But they did see rich green meadows, which stretched ahead for miles.  Silver rivers wound like ribbons through them. In some places there  were low rolling hills and in others great towering mountains. The  woods were thick and still. The sunlight made dancing patterns on the  pine needles. Kentucky was as beautiful as John Finley had said.    Everywhere they went the men found lots of game. There were deer and  buffalo. There were fur-bearing animals, such as mink and otter and  beaver. There were many different kinds of birds.    When the men went hunting, they separated into pairs. One winter day  Boone and his brother-in-law were captured by Indians. The Indians did  not harm them, but they took all the white men's deerskins.    \"Get out of Kentucky and stay out!\" the Indians told them.    Daniel Boone did not scare easily. He and his brother-in-law did not  want to leave Kentucky.    But the other four were afraid. They returned to the settlements. Boone  never saw Finley again. But Boone was soon joined by his brother,  Squire, and a friend named Alexander Neeley. Squire had promised to  harvest the crops back home and then join them in the late autumn with  fresh horses, traps, and gunpowder. Skilled woodsmen that they were,  the brothers somehow found each other in the wilderness.    While they were hunting, the men separated again. They met every two  weeks. One week Boone's brother-in-law did not return to camp. He never  did come back. Five years later a skeleton with a powder horn beside it  was found in a hollow tree. Perhaps he was wounded by an Indian. No one  really knows what happened to him.    Neeley was scared. He decided to go home alone. But Daniel and Squire  stayed on all winter and spring. They hunted and trapped until they had  a lot of skins. Then Squire went home to sell the skins and buy more  gunpowder and traps.    Daniel stayed on in the wilderness. He did not mind being alone. He was  never afraid. With his trusty rifle, Tick-Licker, over his shoulder, he  explored much of Kentucky. He was happy because the wilderness was wide  and he felt free. After a few months, Squire came back. Again the  brothers hunted together.    At last Daniel said to Squire, \"I'll go home with you this time. We  have all the skins we can carry.\"    \"When we sell them, we'll have plenty of money to take to our  families,\" Squire said happily.    It did not happen that way. Indians attacked the brothers when they  were nearly home and took the skins. The Boones were still poor men.    But Daniel was happy. He was glad that he had roamed the wilderness for  nearly two years. He was sorry he had lost the skins, but he was happy  that he had seen Kentucky.          Attacked by Indians      Two years later Daniel Boone decided that he had been away from  Kentucky long enough. \"Pack up, Rebecca,\" he said to his wife. \"Pack  up, children. We Boones can't stay in one spot forever. We're going to  move to Kentucky. It's wild and beautiful there. There'll be plenty of  land for you young ones when you want homes of your own.\"    So the Boones packed up. Six other families joined them. People always  seemed ready to join Daniel in his search for adventure. The household  goods and the farm tools were piled on pack horses. A few of the people  rode horseback. But most of them walked. They drove their pigs and  cattle before them. The rough trails made travel slow, but the families  did not seem to mind.    Just before they reached Cumberland Gap, Daniel Boone sent his  sixteen-year-old son, James, on an errand.    \"Turn back to Captain Russell's cabin and ask him for the farm tools he  and I were talking about,\" he told the boy. \"You can catch up with us  tomorrow.\"    James reached Captain Russell's safely. He camped that night with  several men who planned to join Boone. In the darkness some Indians  crept up and killed them all.    When the families with Boone heard the news, they no longer wanted to  go to Kentucky. They turned and went back over the mountains. The Boone  family was sad because of James' death. But Daniel would not give up  his dream of living in Kentucky. It would just have to wait a little.  He took his wife and children to a spot where they would be safe. But  they did not go all the way back to the Yadkin Valley.    Daniel learned that all through the Kentucky Wilderness the Indians  were fighting the white men.    Too many white men were coming west. Indians wanted to keep their  hunting grounds for themselves. Daniel Boone and another man went into  Kentucky to warn the surveyors who were measuring land there. Nearly  all of them escaped safely. For a time, the Indians stopped fighting  and Kentucky was peaceful again.          The Wilderness Road      Now a rich man named Richard Henderson had a big idea. He would try to  buy Kentucky from the Indians for himself and start another colony. His  own company would sell land to settlers. Henderson was Daniel's friend.  Boone had talked to the Indians about the idea and thought they would  sell the land. Many Indian tribes hunted in Kentucky, but the Cherokees  were the most important. They had conquered the other tribes and ruled  the land. Henderson sent Boone to ask the Cherokees to meet him at  Sycamore Shoals in what is now Tennessee.    Twelve hundred Indian men, women, and children came to the meeting  place. Henderson had all his trading goods spread out. There were yards  and yards of red cloth. There were hundreds of bright new guns. There  were beads and pins and little mirrors for the women. Henderson's  company had paid a great deal of money for the trading goods.    The Indians were like children about the business of trading land for  goods. They loved the bright-colored trinkets. But they knew nothing  about the value of land.    Although they had their own lawyer, they traded Kentucky to Henderson  for a tiny part of what it was worth. The Cherokees warned the white  men of savage Indians who came hunting from the west and the north.  They told Henderson he might have trouble settling the land.    Boone did not go with Henderson to Sycamore Shoals. He waited near  Cumberland Gap with thirty men. When Henderson sent word that he had  bought Kentucky, Boone spoke one word to his men.    \"Start!\" he said.    The men began to make the famous Wilderness Road that was to lead to  Kentucky. Later it would be traveled by settlers with their horses,  wagons, and cattle. Just now Boone's men chose the shortest and easiest  way over the mountains and through the woods. They followed Indian  trails and buffalo paths. They swung their axes. They cut down trees.  They crossed streams. Daniel Boone worked as hard as anyone. And all  the time he kept a sharp lookout for unfriendly Indians.    The men did not stop until they reached the banks of the Kentucky  River. Here they began to build a fort. Boone knew that the Shawnees  and other Indian tribes would not admit that Henderson had bought  Kentucky.    When Henderson came to the settlement, he said, \"We will call this  place Boonesborough. It is right to name it for the man who led us  here.\"    Boone went back to get his family. Some of his children had grown up  and married before the Boones set out for Kentucky the first time.  Thirteen-year-old Jemima was his last unmarried daughter. She and her  mother were the first white women to stand on the bank of the Kentucky  River.          The Rescue      One Sunday afternoon, Jemima and two other girls went for a canoe ride  on the Kentucky River at Boonesborough. They knew they should not go  out of sight of the fort, but they went anyway. They paddled down the  river and around the bend. The current drew them in to the opposite  bank.    \"Let's land and pick some of those bright-colored flowers,\" one of the  girls suggested.    Jemima shook her head. \"I'm afraid of the Indians,\" she said. \"Those  Shawnees are mean.\"    By now the canoe had drifted near the shore. The girl at the bow shoved  with her paddle. The boat would not move. It was stuck fast in the mud.    All at once five Indians leaped from the underbrush. They grabbed the  screaming girls and carried them into the forest. They planned to"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/24737"],[0,"The Children of Odin: The Book of Northern Myths (#2)"],[1,"Stranger.    Now Odin knew that if a great wall could be built around it the Gods  would not have to spend all their time defending their City, Asgard,  from the Giants, and he knew that if Asgard were protected, he himself  could go amongst men and teach them and help them. He thought that no  payment the Stranger could ask would be too much for the building of  that wall.    That day the Stranger came to the Council of the Gods, and he swore that  in a year he would have the great wall built. Then Odin made oath that  the Gods would give him what he asked in payment if the wall was  finished to the last stone in a year from that day.    The Stranger went away and came back on the morrow. It was the first day  of Summer when he started work. He brought no one to help him except a  great horse.    Now the Gods thought that this horse would do no more than drag blocks  of stone for the building of the wall. But the horse did more than this.  He set the stones in their places and mortared them together. And day  and night and by light and dark the horse worked, and soon a great wall  was rising round the palaces that the Gods themselves were building.    \"What reward will the Stranger ask for the work he is doing for us?\" the  Gods asked one another.    Odin went to the Stranger. \"We marvel at the work you and your horse are  doing for us,\" he said. \"No one can doubt that the great wall of Asgard  will be built up by the first day of Summer. What reward do you claim?  We would have it ready for you.\"    The Stranger turned from the work he was doing, leaving the great horse  to pile up the blocks of stone. \"O Father of the Gods,\" he said, \"O  Odin, the reward I shall ask for my work is the Sun and the Moon, and  Freya, who watches over the flowers and grasses, for my wife.\"    Now when Odin heard this he was terribly angered, for the price the  Stranger asked for his work was beyond all prices. He went amongst the  other Gods who were then building their shining palaces within the great  wall and he told them what reward the Stranger had asked. The Gods said,  \"Without the Sun and the Moon the world will wither away.\" And the  Goddesses said, \"Without Freya all will be gloom in Asgard.\"    They would have let the wall remain unbuilt rather than let the Stranger  have the reward he claimed for building it. But one who was in the  company of the Gods spoke. He was Loki, a being who only half belonged  to the Gods; his father was the Wind Giant. \"Let the Stranger build the  wall round Asgard,\" Loki said, \"and I will find a way to make him give  up the hard bargain he has made with the Gods. Go to him and tell him  that the wall must be finished by the first day of Summer, and that if  it is not finished to the last stone on that day the price he asks will  not be given to him.\"    The Gods went to the Stranger and they told him that if the last stone  was not laid on the wall on the first day of the Summer not Sol or Mani,  the Sun and the Moon, nor Freya would be given him. And now they knew  that the Stranger was one of the Giants.    The Giant and his great horse piled up the wall more quickly than  before. At night, while the Giant slept, the horse worked on and on,  hauling up stones and laying them on the wall with his great forefeet.  And day by day the wall around Asgard grew higher and higher.    But the Gods had no joy in seeing that great wall rising higher and  higher around their palaces. The Giant and his horse would finish the  work by the first day of Summer, and then he would take the Sun and the  Moon, Sol and Mani, and Freya away with him.    But Loki was not disturbed. He kept telling the Gods that he would find  a way to prevent him from finishing his work, and thus he would make the  Giant forfeit the terrible price he had led Odin to promise him.    It was three days to Summer time. All the wall was finished except the  gateway. Over the gateway a stone was still to be placed. And the Giant,  before he went to sleep, bade his horse haul up a great block of stone  so that they might put it above the gateway in the morning, and so  finish the work two full days before Summer.    It happened to be a beautiful moonlit night. Svadilfare, the Giant's  great horse, was hauling the largest stone he ever hauled when he saw a  little mare come galloping toward him. The great horse had never seen so  pretty a little mare and he looked at her with surprise.    \"Svadilfare, slave,\" said the little mare to him and went frisking past.    Svadilfare put down the stone he was hauling and called to the little  mare. She came back to him. \"Why do you call me 'Svadilfare, slave'?\"  said the great horse.    \"Because you have to work night and day for your master,\" said the  little mare. \"He keeps you working, working, working, and never lets you  enjoy yourself. You dare not leave that stone down and come and play  with me.\"    \"Who told you I dare not do it?\" said Svadilfare.    \"I know you daren't do it,\" said the little mare, and she kicked up her  heels and ran across the moonlit meadow.    Now the truth is that Svadilfare was tired of working day and night.  When he saw the little mare go galloping off he became suddenly  discontented. He left the stone he was hauling on the ground. He looked  round and he saw the little mare looking back at him. He galloped after  her.    He did not catch up on the little mare. She went on swiftly before him.  On she went over the moonlit meadow, turning and looking back now and  again at the great Svadilfare, who came heavily after her. Down the  mountainside the mare went, and Svadilfare, who now rejoiced in his  liberty and in the freshness of the wind and in the smell of the  flowers, still followed her. With the morning's light they came near a  cave and the little mare went into it. They went through the cave. Then  Svadilfare caught up on the little mare and the two went wandering  together, the little mare telling Svadilfare stories of the Dwarfs and  the Elves.    They came to a grove and they stayed together in it, the little mare  playing so nicely with him that the great horse forgot all about time  passing. And while they were in the grove the Giant was going up and  down, searching for his great horse.    He had come to the wall in the morning, expecting to put the stone over  the gateway and so finish his work. But the stone that was to be lifted  up was not near him. He called for Svadilfare, but his great horse did  not come. He went to search for him, and he searched all down the  mountainside and he searched as far across the earth as the realm of the  Giants. But he did not find Svadilfare.    The Gods saw the first day of Summer come and the gateway of the wall  stand unfinished. They said to each other that if it were not finished  by the evening they need not give Sol and Mani to the Giant, nor the  maiden Freya to be his wife. The hours of the summer day went past and  the Giant did not raise the stone over the gateway. In the evening he  came before them.    \"Your work is not finished,\" Odin said. \"You forced us to a hard  bargain and now we need not keep it with you. You shall not be given Sol  and Mani nor the maiden Freya.\"    \"Only the wall I have built is so strong I would tear it down,\" said the  Giant. He tried to throw down one of the palaces, but the Gods laid  hands on him and thrust him outside the wall he had built. \"Go, and  trouble Asgard no more,\" Odin commanded.    Then Loki returned to Asgard. He told the Gods how he had transformed  himself into a little mare and had led away Svadilfare, the Giant's  great horse. And the Gods sat in their golden palaces behind the great  wall and rejoiced that their City was now secure, and that no enemy  could ever enter it or overthrow it. But Odin, the Father of the Gods,  as he sat upon his throne was sad in his heart, sad that the Gods had  got their wall built by a trick; that oaths had been broken, and that a  blow had been struck in injustice in Asgard.          [Illustration]    IDUNA AND HER APPLES: HOW LOKI PUT THE GODS IN DANGER      In Asgard there was a garden, and in that garden there grew a tree, and  on that tree there grew shining apples. Thou knowst, O well-loved one,  that every day that passes makes us older and brings us to that day when  we will be bent and feeble, gray-headed and weak-eyed. But those shining  apples that grew in Asgard--they who ate of them every day grew never a  day older, for the eating of the apples kept old age away.    Iduna, the Goddess, tended the tree on which the shining apples grew.  None would grow on the tree unless she was there to tend it. No one but  Iduna might pluck the shining apples. Each morning she plucked them and  left them in her basket and every day the Gods and Goddesses came to her  garden that they might eat the shining apples and so stay for ever  young.    Iduna never went from her garden. All day and every day she stayed in  the garden or in her golden house beside it, and all day and every day  she listened to Bragi, her husband, tell a story that never had an end.  Ah, but a time came when Iduna and her apples were lost to Asgard, and  the Gods and Goddesses felt old age approach them. How all that happened  shall be told thee, O well beloved.    Odin, the Father of the Gods, often went into the land of men to watch  over their doings. Once he took Loki with him, Loki, the doer of good  and the doer of evil. For a long time they went traveling through the  world of men. At last they came near Joetunheim, the realm of the Giants.    It was a bleak and empty region. There were no growing things there, not  even trees with berries. There were no birds, there were no animals. As  Odin, the Father of the Gods, and Loki, the doer of good and the doer of  evil, went through this region hunger came upon them. But in all the  land around they saw nothing that they could eat.    Loki, running here and running there, came at last "]]]
