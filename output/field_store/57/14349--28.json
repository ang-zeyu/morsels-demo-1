Through the investments which had taken place, and the yearly  compounding of interest, the status of John Jones's deposit was now as  follows.\" He wrote:        2021   100 years elapsed   $19.10    \"In the following century, many minor changes, of course, took place in  man's mode of living; but the so-called socialists still agitated widely  for the cessation of private ownership of wealth; the First National  Bank still accepted Dollars for safe keeping, and the John Jones Dollar  still continued to grow. With about thirty-four generations yet to come,  the account now stood:        2121   200 years elapsed   $364    \"And by the end of the succeeding hundred years, it had grown to what  constituted an appreciable bit of exchange value in those days--thus:        2221   300 years   $6,920    \"Now the century which followed contains an important date. The date I  am referring to is the year 2299 A.D., or the year in which every human  being born upon the globe was registered under a numerical name at the  central bureau of the National Eugenics Society. In our future lessons  which will treat with that period of detail, I shall ask you to memorize  that date.    \"The socialists still agitated, fruitlessly, but the First National Bank  of Chicago was now the first International Bank of the Earth. And how  great had John Jones's Dollar grown? Let us examine the account, both on  that important historical date, and also at the close of the 400th year  since it was deposited. Look:        2299   378 years    $68,900      2321   400 years   $132,000    \"But gentlemen, it had not reached the point where it could be termed an  unusually large accumulation of wealth. For larger accumulations existed  upon the earth. A descendant of a man once known as John D. Rockefeller  possessed an accumulation of great size, but which, as a matter of  fact, was rapidly dwindling as it passed from generation to generation.  So, let us travel ahead another one hundred years. During this time, as  we learn from our historical and political archives, the socialists  began to die out, since they at last realized the utter futility of  combating the balance of power. The account, though, now stood:        2421   500 years   $2,520,000    \"It is hardly necessary for me to make any comment. Those of you who are  most astute, and others of you who flunked my course before and are now  taking it the second time, of course know what is coming.    \"During the age in which this John Jones lived, there lived also a man,  a so-called scientist called Metchnikoff. We know, from a study of our  vast collection of Egyptian Papyri and Carnegie Library books, that this  Metchnikoff promulgated the theory that old age--or rather senility--was  caused by colon-bacillus. This fact was later verified. But while he was  correct in the etiology of senility, he was crudely primeval in the  therapeutics of it.    \"He proposed, gentlemen, to combat and kill this bacillus by utilizing  the fermented lacteal fluid from a now extinct animal called the cow,  models of which you can see at any time at the Solaris Museum.\"    A chorus of shrill, piping laughter emanated from the brass cylinder.  The professor waited until the merriment had subsided and then  continued:    \"I beg of you, gentlemen, do not smile. This was merely one of the many  similar quaint superstitions existing in that age.    \"But a real scientist, Professor K122B62411Male, again attacked the  problem in the twenty-fifth century. Since the cow was now extinct, he  could not waste his valuable time experimenting with fermented cow  lacteal fluid. He discovered the old _v_-rays of Radium--the rays which  you physicists will remember are not deflected by a magnetic field--were  really composed of two sets of rays, which he termed the _g_ rays and  the _e_ rays. These last named rays--only when isolated--completely  devitalized all colon-bacilli which lay in their path, without in the  least affecting the integrity of any interposed organic cells. The great  result, as many of you already know, was that the life of man was  extended to nearly two hundred years. That, I state unequivocally, was a  great century for the human race.           *       *       *       *       *    \"But I spoke of another happening--one, perhaps, of more interest than  importance. I referred to the bank account of John Jones the fortieth.  It, gentlemen, had grown to such a prodigious sum that a special bank  and board of directors had to be created in order to care for, and  reinvest it. By scanning the following notation, you will perceive the  truth of my statement:        2521   600 years   $47,900,000    \"By the year 2621 A.D., two events of stupendous importance took place.  There is scarcely a man in this class who has not heard of how Professor  P222D29333Male accidentally stumbled upon the scientific fact that the  effect of gravity is reversed upon any body which vibrates  perpendicularly to the plane of the ecliptic with a frequency which is  an even multiple of the logarithm of 2 of the Naperian base 'e.' At  once, special vibrating cars were constructed which carried mankind to  all planets. That discovery of Professor P222D29333Male did nothing less  than open up seven new territories to our inhabitants; namely: Mercury,  Venus, Mars, Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, and Neptune. In the great land  rush that ensued, thousands who were previously poor became rich.    \"But, gentlemen, land which so far had been constituted one of the main  sources of wealth, was shortly to become valuable for individual golf  links only, as it is today, on account of another scientific discovery.    \"This second discovery was in reality, not a discovery, but the  perfection of a chemical process, the principles of which had been known  for many centuries. I am alluding to the construction of the vast  reducing factories, one upon each planet, to which the bodies of all  persons who have died on their respective planets are at once shipped by  Aerial Express. Since this process is used today, all of you understand  the methods employed; how each body is reduced by heat to its component  constituents: hydrogen, oxygen, nitrogen, carbon, calcium, phosphorus,  and so forth; how these separated constituents are stored in special  reservoirs together with the components from thousands of other corpses;  how these elements are then synthetically combined into food tablets for  those of us who are yet alive--thus completing an endless chain from the  dead to the living. Naturally then, agriculture and stock-raising  ceased, since the food problem, with which man had coped from time  immemorial, was solved. The two direct results were, first--that land  lost the inflated values it had possessed when it was necessary for  tillage, and second--that men were at last given enough leisure to enter  the fields of science and art.    \"And as to the John Jones Dollar, which now embraced countless  industries and vast territory on the earth, it stood, in value:        2621   700 years   $912,000,000    \"In truth, gentlemen, it now constituted the largest private fortune on  the terrestrial globe. And in that year, 2621 A.D., there were thirteen  generations yet to come, before John Jones the fortieth would arrive.    \"To continue. In the year 2721 A.D., an important political battle was  concluded in the Solar System Senate and House of Representatives. I am  referring to the great controversy as to whether the Earth's moon was a  sufficient menace to interplanetary navigation to warrant its removal.  The outcome of the wrangle was that the question was decided in the  affirmative. Consequently--    \"But I beg your pardon, young men. I occasionally lose sight of the fact  that you are not so well informed upon historical matters as myself.  Here I am, talking to you about the moon, totally forgetful that many of  you are puzzled as to my meaning. I advise all of you who have not yet  attended the Solaris Museum on Jupiter, to take a trip there some Sunday  afternoon. The Interplanetary Suburban Line runs trains every half hour  on that day. You will find there a complete working model of the old  satellite of the Earth, which, before it was destroyed, furnished this  planet light at night through the crude medium of reflection.    \"On account of this decision as to the inadvisability of allowing the  moon to remain where it was, engineers commenced its removal in the year  2721. Piece by piece, it was chipped away and brought to the Earth in  Interplanetary freight cars. These pieces were then propelled by  Zoodolite explosive, in the direction of the Milky Way, with a velocity  of 11,217 meters per second. This velocity, of course, gave each  departing fragment exactly the amount of kinetic energy it required to  enable it to overcome the backward pull of the Earth from here to  infinity. I dare say those moon-hunks are going yet.    \"At the start of the removal of the moon in 2721 A.D., the accumulated  wealth of John Jones the fortieth, stood:        2721   800 years   $17,400,000,000    \"Of course, with such a colossal sum at their command, the directors of  the fund had made extensive investments on Mars and Venus.    \"By the end of the twenty-eighth century, or the year 2807 A.D., the  moon had been completely hacked away and sent piecemeal into space, the  job having required 86 years. I give, herewith, the result of John  Jones's Dollar, both at the date when the moon was completely removed  and also at the close of the 900th year after its deposit:        2807   886 years   $219,000,000,000      2821   900 years   $332,000,000,000    \"The meaning of those figures, gentlemen, as stated in simple language,  was that the John Jones Dollar now comprised practically all the wealth  on Earth, Mars, and Venus--with the exception of one university site on  each planet, which"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/2688"],[0,"The Clue of the Twisted Candle (#2)"],[1," further, but at the moment dinner was  announced.    It was not a particularly cheerful meal because Grace did not as usual  join in the conversation, and it was left to Kara and to her husband  to supply the deficiencies. She was experiencing a curious sense of  depression, a premonition of evil which she could not define. Again and  again in the course of the dinner she took her mind back to the events  of the day to discover the reason for her unease.    Usually when she adopted this method she came upon the trivial causes  in which apprehension was born, but now she was puzzled to find that a  solution was denied her. Her letters of the morning had been pleasant,  neither the house nor the servants had given her any trouble. She was  well herself, and though she knew John had a little money trouble,  since his unfortunate speculation in Roumanian gold shares, and she half  suspected that he had had to borrow money to make good his losses, yet  his prospects were so excellent and the success of his last book  so promising that she, probably seeing with a clearer vision the  unimportance of those money worries, was less concerned about the  problem than he.    \"You will have your coffee in the study, I suppose,\" said Grace, \"and  I know you'll excuse me; I have to see Mrs. Chandler on the mundane  subject of laundry.\"    She favoured Kara with a little nod as she left the room and touched  John's shoulder lightly with her hand in passing.    Kara's eyes followed her graceful figure until she was out of view,  then:    \"I want to see you, Kara,\" said John Lexman, \"if you will give me five  minutes.\"    \"You can have five hours, if you like,\" said the other, easily.    They went into the study together; the maid brought the coffee  and liqueur, and placed them on a little table near the fire and  disappeared.    For a time the conversation was general. Kara, who was a frank admirer  of the comfort of the room and who lamented his own inability to secure  with money the cosiness which John had obtained at little cost, went on  a foraging expedition whilst his host applied himself to a proof which  needed correcting.    \"I suppose it is impossible for you to have electric light here,\" Kara  asked.    \"Quite,\" replied the other.    \"Why?\"    \"I rather like the light of this lamp.\"    \"It isn't the lamp,\" drawled the Greek and made a little grimace; \"I  hate these candles.\"    He waved his hand to the mantle-shelf where the six tall, white, waxen  candles stood out from two wall sconces.    \"Why on earth do you hate candles?\" asked the other in surprise.    Kara made no reply for the moment, but shrugged his shoulders. Presently  he spoke.    \"If you were ever tied down to a chair and by the side of that chair was  a small keg of black powder and stuck in that powder was a small candle  that burnt lower and lower every minute--my God!\"    John was amazed to see the perspiration stand upon the forehead of his  guest.    \"That sounds thrilling,\" he said.    The Greek wiped his forehead with a silk handkerchief and his hand shook  a little.    \"It was something more than thrilling,\" he said.    \"And when did this occur?\" asked the author curiously.    \"In Albania,\" replied the other; \"it was many years ago, but the devils  are always sending me reminders of the fact.\"    He did not attempt to explain who the devils were or under what  circumstances he was brought to this unhappy pass, but changed the  subject definitely.    Sauntering round the cosy room he followed the bookshelf which filled  one wall and stopped now and again to examine some title. Presently he  drew forth a stout volume.    \"'Wild Brazil',\" he read, \"by George Gathercole-do you know Gathercole?\"    John was filling his pipe from a big blue jar on his desk and nodded.    \"Met him once--a taciturn devil. Very short of speech and, like all men  who have seen and done things, less inclined to talk about himself than  any man I know.\"    Kara looked at the book with a thoughtful pucker of brow and turned the  leaves idly.    \"I've never seen him,\" he said as he replaced the book, \"yet, in a  sense, his new journey is on my behalf.\"    The other man looked up.    \"On your behalf?\"    \"Yes--you know he has gone to Patagonia for me. He believes there is  gold there--you will learn as much from his book on the mountain systems  of South America. I was interested in his theories and corresponded  with him. As a result of that correspondence he undertook to make a  geological survey for me. I sent him money for his expenses, and he went  off.\"    \"You never saw him?\" asked John Lexman, surprised.    Kara shook his head.    \"That was not--?\" began his host.    \"Not like me, you were going to say. Frankly, it was not, but then I  realized that he was an unusual kind of man. I invited him to dine with  me before he left London, and in reply received a wire from Southampton  intimating that he was already on his way.\"    Lexman nodded.    \"It must be an awfully interesting kind of life,\" he said. \"I suppose he  will be away for quite a long time?\"    \"Three years,\" said Kara, continuing his examination of the bookshelf.    \"I envy those fellows who run round the world writing books,\" said John,  puffing reflectively at his pipe. \"They have all the best of it.\"    Kara turned. He stood immediately behind the author and the other  could not see his face. There was, however, in his voice an unusual  earnestness and an unusual quiet vehemence.    \"What have you to complain about!\" he asked, with that little drawl of  his. \"You have your own creative work--the most fascinating branch of  labour that comes to a man. He, poor beggar, is bound to actualities.  You have the full range of all the worlds which your imagination  gives to you. You can create men and destroy them, call into existence  fascinating problems, mystify and baffle ten or twenty thousand people,  and then, at a word, elucidate your mystery.\"    John laughed.    \"There is something in that,\" he said.    \"As for the rest of your life,\" Kara went on in a lower voice, \"I think  you have that which makes life worth living--an incomparable wife.\"    Lexman swung round in his chair, and met the other's gaze, and there was  something in the set of the other's handsome face which took his breath  away.    \"I do not see--\" he began.    Kara smiled.    \"That was an impertinence, wasn't it!\" he said, banteringly. \"But then  you mustn't forget, my dear man, that I was very anxious to marry your  wife. I don't suppose it is secret. And when I lost her, I had ideas  about you which are not pleasant to recall.\"    He had recovered his self-possession and had continued his aimless  stroll about the room.    \"You must remember I am a Greek, and the modern Greek is no philosopher.  You must remember, too, that I am a petted child of fortune, and have  had everything I wanted since I was a baby.\"    \"You are a fortunate devil,\" said the other, turning back to his desk,  and taking up his pen.    For a moment Kara did not speak, then he made as though he would say  something, checked himself, and laughed.    \"I wonder if I am,\" he said.    And now he spoke with a sudden energy.    \"What is this trouble you are having with Vassalaro?\"    John rose from his chair and walked over to the fire, stood gazing down  into its depths, his legs wide apart, his hands clasped behind him, and  Kara took his attitude to supply an answer to the question.    \"I warned you against Vassalaro,\" he said, stooping by the other's side  to light his cigar with a spill of paper. \"My dear Lexman, my fellow  countrymen are unpleasant people to deal with in certain moods.\"    \"He was so obliging at first,\" said Lexman, half to himself.    \"And now he is so disobliging,\" drawled Kara. \"That is a way which  moneylenders have, my dear man; you were very foolish to go to him at  all. I could have lent you the money.\"    \"There were reasons why I should not borrow money from you,\", said John,  quietly, \"and I think you yourself have supplied the principal reason  when you told me just now, what I already knew, that you wanted to marry  Grace.\"    \"How much is the amount?\" asked Kara, examining his well-manicured  finger-nails.    \"Two thousand five hundred pounds,\" replied John, with a short laugh,  \"and I haven't two thousand five hundred shillings at this moment.\"    \"Will he wait?\"    John Lexman shrugged his shoulders.    \"Look here, Kara,\" he said, suddenly, \"don't think I want to reproach  you, but it was through you that I met Vassalaro so that you know the  kind of man he is.\"    Kara nodded.    \"Well, I can tell you he has been very unpleasant indeed,\" said John,  with a frown, \"I had an interview with him yesterday in London and it  is clear that he is going to make a lot of trouble. I depended upon the  success of my play in town giving me enough to pay him off, and I very  foolishly made a lot of promises of repayment which I have been unable  to keep.\"    \"I see,\" said Kara, and then, \"does Mrs. Lexman know about this matter?\"    \"A little,\" said the other.    He paced restlessly up and down the room, his hands behind him and his  chin upon his chest.    \"Naturally I have not told her the worst, or how beastly unpleasant the  man has been.\"    He stopped and turned.    \"Do you know he threatened to kill me?\" he asked.    Kara smiled.    \"I can tell you it was no laughing matter,\" said the other, angrily,  \"I nearly took the little whippersnapper by the scruff of the neck and  kicked him.\"    Kara dropped his hand on the other's arm.    \"I am not laughing at you,\" he said; \"I am laughing at the thought of  Vassalaro threatening to kill anybody. He is the biggest coward in the  world. What on earth induced him to take this drastic step?\"    \"He said he is being hard pushed for money,\" said the other, moodily,  \"and it is possibly true. He was beside himself with anger and anxiety,  otherwise I might have given the little blackguard the"]]]
