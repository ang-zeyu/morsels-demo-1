[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/24776"],[0,"The Brochure Series of Architectural Illustration, Vol. 01, No. 12, December (#2)"],[1," of THE BROCHURE SERIES  have been prepared for the convenience of those who wish to bind their  copies, and they will be mailed free to any subscriber upon request.      Since the introduction to the public of THE BROCHURE SERIES in its  present form a year ago, five-cent magazines have been made fashionable.  Their number is countless, and they are of all degrees of value and  interest. A year ago the experiment was a comparatively untried one  and the policy of THE BROCHURE SERIES was necessarily more or less  experimental, but it has now crystalized into fairly settled shape. In  its main feature, the illustration of historic architecture, it must  appeal to all who have any connection with the architectural profession.  An architect can never have too many photographs, provided they are well  classified and accessible; and it is practically impossible that anyone  shall have _all_ of the one hundred photographs given in a year's  volumes of the magazine, as they are drawn from so many different  sources. The classification of subjects is of itself sufficient reason  for buying THE BROCHURES, even provided they duplicate photographs  already owned.    The educational features of the magazine relating to architectural  societies, schools, and public competitions have proved of unusual  interest to the younger members of the profession, and during the coming  year it is hoped that more importance can be given to this work. The  cooperation of all who are concerned in organizations of this character  is earnestly solicited.    The competitions which have been offered from time to time under the  direction of the magazine have proved so successful that an effort will  be made to establish them as a regular feature, and it is hoped that at  least one competition a month can be looked for in future.      +Wanted+    Draughtsmen's Addresses.    We intend issuing, the coming year, a number of interestingly  illustrated announcements of new architectural publications and  importations. We want to send these to every architectural student  and draughtsman in the United States and Canada. If you are not on our  subscription list, send us your _residence_ address for our circular  mailing list. Address a postal card as below, putting simply your  address on the back. If you are in an office, have the other fellows put  their residence addresses on the same card. We prefer to address mail  matter to your residence, as there is less danger of miscarriage. Do not  get the idea that by sending your address you are ordering something you  will be asked to pay for. All the expense, except the postal card, is  on our side. If we can't get out announcements interesting enough to  attract your attention and occasionally secure an order, it will be our  loss. Address:--      Bates & Guild,    6 Beacon Street,    Boston, Mass.    _For Circular List._        [Illustration: XCVII.    Old Manor House, Lythe Hill, England.]      +Brochure Series Competition No. 3.+    The designs submitted in the competition closing December 20 for the  advertising page of the Boynton Furnace Co. proved of even greater merit  as a whole than those submitted in the first competition, and it has  been difficult to decide which has the best claim to the prize; but the  judges have finally decided to award the first place to Mr. William L.  Welton, of Lynn, Mass., and his design is given on advertising page xiii  of this number. Of the reasons for this award some will be evident at a  glance. The effect of the page as a whole is striking and unique. To  be sure, there is a certain suggestiveness of Mr. Binner's familiar  advertisements for the Pabst Brewing Co., but the similarity goes no  further than the selection of Egyptian motives and the simple, flat,  silhouette-like treatment. Mr. Welton has merely gone to the same  source of inspiration, and his design is just as good in its way as Mr.  Binner's. The idea of connecting the character of the ornament with the  advertisement is carried out in both cases. The Pabst advertisements all  state that the history of brewing begins with Egypt, while Mr. Welton  has very cleverly used the Great Pyramid of Cheops as a graphic  illustration to indicate the area covered by the heaters built by the  Boynton Furnace Company.      [Illustration:    DESIGN BY W. B. OLMSTED.]    If any suggestions were to be offered towards the improvement of this  design, they would be mainly in the direction of refinement in drawing.  The lettering is not what it might be, especially at the top in the name  of the company, which is somewhat confused. The monogram, an unimportant  feature from an advertising point of view, is given the most important  position in the design.      [Illustration:    DESIGN BY PIERRE LIESCH.]    The following competitors, in the opinion of the judges, deserve  honorable mention: W. B. Olmsted, 118 Lake Street, Elmira, N.Y.; Pierre  Liesch, 53 State Street, Boston, Mass.; P. G. Gulbranson, 31 West  Street, Boston, Mass.; F. Chouteau Brown, 31 East Newton Street, Boston,  Mass.; William J. Freethy, 85 Water Street, Boston, Mass.    Mr. Olmsted's design, which is illustrated herewith, is, like the design  which he submitted in the last competition, in many respects distinctly  the best of the collection. It is unfortunate in representing a heater  not made by the Boynton Furnace Company, but very suggestive of a  pattern made by one of their competitors in the trade. If it were not  for this unfortunate slip, it would be given first place. The idea is  good and the treatment all that could be desired. It is good advertising  and meets the conditions directly and well.      [Illustration:    DESIGN BY P. G. GULBRANSON.]    The design of Mr. Liesch has the virtue of being unusual, and would  arrest the attention of many who might not be attracted by the preceding  one. The lettering in this case, although done with exceptional taste,  is not sufficiently clear and readable to be entirely satisfactory as  an advertisement.    Mr. Gulbranson's design is of more interest as a drawing than as an  advertisement. To the readers of THE BROCHURE SERIES this characteristic  would doubtless appeal, while it might be of no value in an  advertisement intended for a different clientage.      [Illustration:    DESIGN BY F. CHOUTEAU BROWN.]    Mr. Brown's design has an interest of a different sort. It is crude in  treatment, purposely so no doubt, but the idea is so unusual, with a  quaint touch of humor, that it would be sure to attract attention. If  space would allow, several of the remaining designs could be reproduced  to advantage, and would give a wider field for comparison.        [Illustration: XCVIII.    Old Manor House, Lythe Hill, England.]      +Notes.+    Attention has already been called in these columns to the efforts of  the Henry F. Miller Piano Co. to foster the designing of artistic piano  cases. Their later designs are a long step away from the conventional  and hopelessly ugly piano cases that have been put out by the piano  trade universally. They reason that the piano, as an artistic  instrument, should have an artistic setting, and it is to draw the  attention of architectural designers to this point that they have  already given prizes for one competition, and purpose offering another  prize, probably of $100, for a second competition. The making of  special designs for piano cases has fallen largely into the hands of  custom-furniture makers simply because the work of piano factories has  for years carried its own condemnation. The furniture maker often is  forced to buy a new piano, from stock, and build it over as best he can,  charging a price that is almost prohibitory. Since the Miller factory  has been equipped with the best facilities for special case work it has  become possible for architects to have their own designs intelligently  executed without unreasonable expense, or to secure unfinished cases  should they wish a cabinet maker to execute their designs. The Miller  Company is one of the few piano companies in a position to undertake  this departure. The character of their pianos as superior instruments  was established years ago, and every succeeding year has added to their  reputation. The fight for a front-rank position as instrument makers has  been won. Now they begin to fight for artistic case building, and they  deserve the sympathy and encouragement of every American architect. The  work of the pioneer is always hard, and it is seldom the pioneer who  gets the benefits from this work. Should this move of the Miller Company  prove that better designed cases will be appreciated by the public,  every piano maker in the country will follow suit, but none seem to have  the courage to strike out independently with the same aim. The piano  shown on this page is the Wagner Grand exhibited at the World's Fair,  while their Colonial design is shown in their advertisement. They are  the two extremes.      [Illustration.]    One could hardly get a more attractive case for ordinary purposes than  the Colonial pattern.        [Illustration: XCIX.    Old Farm House, Lythe Hill, England.]      SHINGLE STAINED HOUSES.    In this number we present to our readers a class of advertisement  that cannot but prove acceptable, owing to the intrinsic interest  of the subjects published in it. The seven pages preceding our first  frontispiece show an attractive collection of country and suburban  residences by Boston architects. The fact that these residences are  stained with Dexter Brothers' English Shingle Stains, which constitutes  the advertising character of the illustrations, adds to rather than  detracts from their value, for each subject is remarkably satisfactory  for its color scheme, and while a photograph does not give the effect,  the selection was made very largely on the basis of good coloring.    No further word concerning the stains is necessary. The fact that they  have been"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/24777"],[0,"Celebrated Travels and Travellers, Part 1.
