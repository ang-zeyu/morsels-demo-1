[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/304"],[0,"Rio Grande's Last Race, and Other Verses (#2)"],[1,"   On beasts that crawl along;    We have to drop the weak and lame,     And try to save the strong;    The wrath of God is on the track,     The drought fiend holds his sway,    With blows and cries and stockwhip crack     We take the stock away.        As they fall we leave them lying,        With the crows to watch them dying,    Grim sextons of the Overland that fasten on their prey;        By the fiery dust-storm drifting,        And the mocking mirage shifting,    In heat and drought and hopeless pain we take the stock away.      In dull despair the days go by     With never hope of change,    But every stage we draw more nigh     Towards the mountain range;    And some may live to climb the pass,     And reach the great plateau,    And revel in the mountain grass,     By streamlets fed with snow.        As the mountain wind is blowing        It starts the cattle lowing,    And calling to each other down the dusty long array;        And there speaks a grizzled drover:        'Well, thank God, the worst is over,    The creatures smell the mountain grass that's twenty miles away.'      They press towards the mountain grass,     They look with eager eyes    Along the rugged stony pass,     That slopes towards the skies;    Their feet may bleed from rocks and stones,     But though the blood-drop starts,    They struggle on with stifled groans,     For hope is in their hearts.        And the cattle that are leading,        Though their feet are worn and bleeding,    Are breaking to a kind of run -- pull up, and let them go!        For the mountain wind is blowing,        And the mountain grass is growing,    They settle down by running streams ice-cold with melted snow.           .    .    .    .    .      The days are done of heat and drought     Upon the stricken plain;    The wind has shifted right about,     And brought the welcome rain;    The river runs with sullen roar,     All flecked with yellow foam,    And we must take the road once more,     To bring the cattle home.        And it's 'Lads! we'll raise a chorus,        There's a pleasant trip before us.'    And the horses bound beneath us as we start them down the track;        And the drovers canter, singing,        Through the sweet green grasses springing,    Towards the far-off mountain-land, to bring the cattle back.      Are these the beasts we brought away     That move so lively now?    They scatter off like flying spray     Across the mountain's brow;    And dashing down the rugged range     We hear the stockwhip crack,    Good faith, it is a welcome change     To bring such cattle back.        And it's 'Steady down the lead there!'        And it's 'Let 'em stop and feed there!'    For they're wild as mountain eagles and their sides are all afoam;        But they're settling down already,        And they'll travel nice and steady,    With cheery call and jest and song we fetch the cattle home.      We have to watch them close at night     For fear they'll make a rush,    And break away in headlong flight     Across the open bush;    And by the camp-fire's cheery blaze,     With mellow voice and strong,    We hear the lonely watchman raise     The Overlander's song:        'Oh! it's when we're done with roving,        With the camping and the droving,    It's homeward down the Bland we'll go, and never more we'll roam;'        While the stars shine out above us,        Like the eyes of those who love us --    The eyes of those who watch and wait to greet the cattle home.      The plains are all awave with grass,     The skies are deepest blue;    And leisurely the cattle pass     And feed the long day through;    But when we sight the station gate,     We make the stockwhips crack,    A welcome sound to those who wait     To greet the cattle back:        And through the twilight falling        We hear their voices calling,    As the cattle splash across the ford and churn it into foam;        And the children run to meet us,        And our wives and sweethearts greet us,    Their heroes from the Overland who brought the cattle home.           The First Surveyor          'The opening of the railway line! -- the Governor and all!    With flags and banners down the street, a banquet and a ball.    Hark to 'em at the station now!  They're raising cheer on cheer!    \"The man who brought the railway through -- our friend the engineer!\"      'They cheer HIS pluck and enterprise and engineering skill!    'Twas my old husband found the pass behind that big Red Hill.    Before the engineer was grown we settled with our stock    Behind that great big mountain chain, a line of range and rock --    A line that kept us starving there in weary weeks of drought,    With ne'er a track across the range to let the cattle out.      ''Twas then, with horses starved and weak and scarcely fit to crawl,    My husband went to find a way across that rocky wall.    He vanished in the wilderness, God knows where he was gone,    He hunted till his food gave out, but still he battled on.    His horses strayed -- 'twas well they did -- they made towards the grass,    And down behind that big red hill they found an easy pass.      'He followed up and blazed the trees, to show the safest track,    Then drew his belt another hole and turned and started back.    His horses died -- just one pulled through with nothing much to spare;    God bless the beast that brought him home, the old white Arab mare!    We drove the cattle through the hills, along the new-found way,    And this was our first camping-ground -- just where I live to-day.      'Then others came across the range and built the township here,    And then there came the railway line and this young engineer.    He drove about with tents and traps, a cook to cook his meals,    A bath to wash himself at night, a chain-man at his heels.    And that was all the pluck and skill for which he's cheered and praised,    For after all he took the track, the same my husband blazed!      'My poor old husband, dead and gone with never feast nor cheer;    He's buried by the railway line! -- I wonder can he hear    When down the very track he marked, and close to where he's laid,    The cattle trains go roaring down the one-in-thirty grade.    I wonder does he hear them pass and can he see the sight,    When through the dark the fast express goes flaming by at night.      'I think 'twould comfort him to know there's someone left to care,    I'll take some things this very night and hold a banquet there!    The hard old fare we've often shared together, him and me,    Some damper and a bite of beef, a pannikin of tea:    We'll do without the bands and flags, the speeches and the fuss,    We know who OUGHT to get the cheers and that's enough for us.      'What's that?  They wish that I'd come down -- the oldest settler here!    Present me to the Governor and that young engineer!    Well, just you tell his Excellence and put the thing polite,    I'm sorry, but I can't come down -- I'm dining out to-night!'          Mulga Bill's Bicycle          'Twas Mulga Bill, from Eaglehawk, that caught the cycling craze;    He turned away the good old horse that served him many days;    He dressed himself in cycling clothes, resplendent to be seen;    He hurried off to town and bought a shining new machine;    And as he wheeled it through the door, with air of lordly pride,    The grinning shop assistant said, 'Excuse me, can you ride?'      'See, here, young man,' said Mulga Bill, 'from Walgett to the sea,    From Conroy's Gap to Castlereagh, there's none can ride like me.    I'm good all round at everything, as everybody knows,    Although I'm not the one to talk -- I HATE a man that blows.    But riding is my special gift, my chiefest, sole delight;    Just ask a wild duck can it swim, a wild cat can it fight.    There's nothing clothed in hair or hide, or built of flesh or steel,    There's nothing walks or jumps, or runs, on axle, hoof, or wheel,    But what I'll sit, while hide will hold and girths and straps are tight:    I'll ride this here two-wheeled concern right straight away at sight.'      'Twas Mulga Bill, from Eaglehawk, that sought his own abode,    That perched above the Dead Man's Creek, beside the mountain road.    He turned the cycle down the hill and mounted for the fray,    But ere he'd gone a dozen yards it bolted clean away.    It left the track, and through the trees, just like a silver streak,    It whistled down the awful slope, towards the Dead Man's Creek.      It shaved a stump by half an inch, it dodged a big white-box:    The very wallaroos in fright went scrambling up the rocks,    The wombats hiding in their caves dug deeper underground,    As Mulga Bill, as white as chalk, sat tight to every bound.    It struck a stone and gave a spring that cleared a fallen tree,    It raced beside a precipice as close as close could be;    And then as Mulga Bill let out one last despairing shriek    It made a leap of twenty feet into the Dead Man's Creek.      'Twas Mulga Bill, from Eaglehawk, that slowly swam ashore:    He said, 'I've had some narrer shaves and lively rides before;    I've rode a wild bull round a yard to win a five pound bet,    But this was the most awful ride that I've encountered yet.    I'll give that two-wheeled outlaw best; it's shaken all my nerve    To feel it whistle through the air and plunge and buck and swerve.    It's safe at rest in Dead Man's Creek, we'll leave it lying still;    A horse's back is good enough henceforth for Mulga Bill.'          The Pearl Diver          Kanzo Makame, the diver, sturdy and small Japanee,    Seeker of pearls and of pearl-shell down in the depths of the sea,    Trudged o'er the bed of the ocean, searching industriously.      Over the pearl-grounds, the lugger drifted -- a little white speck:    Joe Nagasaki, the 'tender', holding the life-line on deck,    Talked through the rope to the diver, knew when to drift or to check.      Kanzo was king of his lugger,"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/30411"],[0,"English as she is spoke; or, a jest in sober earnest (#2)"],[1," I knew to tame hix.\"    After the \"Familiar Dialogues\" we come upon a series of letters from  celebrated personages, who would be puzzled to recognize themselves  in their new dresses; and a collection of anecdotes which may be  taken singly after dinner as a gentle promoter of digestion; the  whole being appropriately concluded with \"Idiotisms and Proverbs,\"  between which it must be confessed the distinction is purely  imaginary; the following are a few gems: \"Its are some blu stories\"  (_contes bleus_); \"Nothing some money, nothing some Swiss,\" \"He sin  in trouble water\" (confusion of _pecher_ and _pecher_). \"A horse  baared don't look him the tooth,\" \"The stone as roll not heap up not  foam,\" _mousse_ meaning both foam and moss, of course the wrong  meaning is essential to a good \"idiotism.\" \"To force to forge,  becomes smith\" (_a force de forger on devient forgeron_). \"To  craunch the marmoset\" and \"To fatten the foot\" may terminate the  list, and are incontestably more idiotic, although scarcely so  idiomatic as \"_Croquer le marmot_\" and \"_Graisser lapatte_.\"    The column in Portuguese which runs throughout the original work is  omitted, and only a sufficient number of the English extracts are  culled to enable the reader to form a just idea of the  unintentionally humorous style that an author may fall into who  attempts to follow the intricacies of \"English as she is spoke\" by  the aid of a French dictionary and a phrasebook.    It is to be trusted the eccentric \"Guide\" to which this short sketch  is intended to serve as Introduction--and, so far as may be,  elucidation--is not a fair specimen of Portuguese or Brazilian  educational literature; if such be the case the schoolmaster is  indeed \"abroad,\" and one may justly fear that his instruction--to  quote once more the Preface--\"only will be for to accustom the  Portuguese pupils, or foreign, to speak very bad any of the mentioned  idioms.\"      ***      Preface.      [Author's]    _A CHOICE of_ familiar dialogues, _clean of gallicisms, and despoiled  phrases, it was missing yet to studious Portuguese and brazilian  Youth; and also to persons of others nations, that wish to know the  Portuguese language. We sought all we may do, to correct that want,  composing and divising the present little work in two parts. The  first includes a greatest vocabulary proper names by alphabetical  order; and the second forty three_ Dialogues _adapted to the usual  precisions of the life. For that reason we did put, with a scrupulous  exactness, a great variety own expressions to english and Portuguese  idioms; without to attach us selves (as make some others) almost at a  literal translation; translation what only will be for to accustom  the Portuguese pupils, or-foreign, to speak very bad any of the  mentioned idioms._    _We were increasing this second edition with a phraseology, in the  first part, and some familiar letters, anecdotes, idiotisms,  proverbs, and to second a coin's index._    _The_ Works _which we were confering for this labour, fond use us for  nothing; but those what were publishing to Portugal, or out, they  were almost all composed for some foreign, or for some national  little acquainted in the spirit of both languages. It was resulting  from that carelessness to rest these_ Works _fill of imperfections,  and anomalies of style; in spite of the infinite typographical faults  which some times, invert the sense of the periods. It increase not to  contain any of those_ Works _the figured pronunciation of the english  words, nor the prosodical accent in the Portuguese; indispensable  object whom wish to speak the english and Portuguese languages  correctly._    _We expect then, who the little book (for the care what we wrote him,  and for her typographical correction) that may be worth the  acceptation of the studious persons, and especially of the Youth, at  which we dedicate him particularly._      ***      _English as she is spoke._      **                           Of the Man.
