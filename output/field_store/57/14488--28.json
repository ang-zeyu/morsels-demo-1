The  Catbird singing from near his last year's home in the thickening  shrubbery, the House Wren whose music bubbles over between bustling  visits to an oft-used bird-box, the Chimney Swift twittering cheerily  from an evening sky, may be heard without even the effort of listening  and each one, with a hundred others, brings us a message if we will but  accept it. And I make no fanciful statement when I say that it is a  message we can ill afford to lose.    [Illustration: \"RED-WINGS WITH SCARLET EPAULETS GO TROOPING BY\"]    With May come the Thrushes--Wood Thrush, Veery, Olive-back and  Gray-cheek, the last two en route to the north--the Orioles, Cuckoos,  Vireos, and the Bobolink who began his four thousand mile journey from  northern Argentina in March. But May is preeminently the Month of  Warblers, \"most beautiful, most abundant, and least known\" of our birds.  To the eight species which have already arrived, there may be added over  twenty more, represented by a number of individuals beyond our power to  estimate. We may hear the Robin, Thrasher, and Wren, without listening,  but we will see few Warblers without looking; and this, in a measure,  accounts for the fascination which attends their study.    After May 15 there is an evident thinning in the ranks of the migrating  army, and by June 1 we shall see only a few stragglers. The Transient  Visitors will have gone to their more northern homes and our bird  population will then consist only of the ever present Permanent  Residents and the Summer Residents which the great northward march of  the birds has brought us from the South.    Although June may be called the Month of Nests, nest-building begins  long before the migration ends. Some Owls and Hawks lay in March, and  the Bluebird, White-breasted Nuthatch and Robin have eggs by April 20,  while most of our birds go to housekeeping during the latter half of  May. Nevertheless, it is in June that their domestic life is at its  height; and to the student of birds' habits this is by far the most  interesting month in the year.    [Illustration: TREE SWALLOWS . . . RESTING IN ROWS ON WAYSIDE WIRES]    Birds that raise two or even three broods will still be occupied with  household affairs in July, but one-brooded birds, having launched their  families, will seek retirement to undergo the trying ordeal of molt,  whereby they will get a complete new costume. Often this will be quite  unlike the one in which they arrived from the South--as the student will  discover, sometimes to his confusion! In August, the Month of Molt, the  seclusion sought by many of our summer birds induces the belief that  they have left us, but toward the latter part of the month they  reappear. The first week in August virtually marks the end of the song  season. The Wood Pewee and Red-eyed Vireo remain in voice throughout the  month, but the great chorus which has made May, June and most of July  vocal, we shall not hear before another spring--so short is the time  when we are blessed by the songs of birds.    Meanwhile the feathered army has begun its retreat to winter quarters.  As early as July 15, Tree Swallows will arrive and by the end of the  month will be seen resting in rows on wayside telegraph wires, or en  route to their roosts in the marshes. In the now heavily leaved forests  the returning Warblers and Flycatchers will not be so easily observed as  they were in May, but in September they become too abundant to be  overlooked. The southward movement grows in strength until late  September, when the greater part of the insect-eating birds have left  us, and it is terminated by the frosts, and consequent falling leaves,  of October.    But just as in the spring some of the northbound migrants drop from the  ranks to spend the summer with us, so in the fall some of the southbound  travelers will remain with us for the winter. The Junco, which we are  wont to think of as only a winter bird, arrives the latter part of  September to remain until April, and with him come the Golden-crowned  Kinglet, Brown Creeper and Winter Wren--all to stay until spring.  October will bring the Horned Lark, Pine Finch, Snow Bunting, Tree  Sparrow and Northern Shrike and these birds with the ones just  mentioned, and the ever faithful Permanent Residents, give us a goodly  winter company.    But the possibilities do not end here; there may be Redpolls, American  and also White-winged Crossbills, perhaps Pine Grosbeaks, and, best of  all, Evening Grosbeaks, who of recent years have been coming to us more  or less regularly from no man knows where.    So from one year's end to the other, there is not a month, a week or day  which has not interests of its own. The bird student may pass his life  in one place, but he can never say \"I have finished\" for the morrow may  bring some new bird or new fact. How immeasurably this association with  the birds adds to the joy of life! What new meanings their comings and  goings give to the changing seasons; the very air is made eloquent by  their calls and songs. Why should we not all \"come at these  enchantments\"?

Another factor to consider  when comparing these two machines is that one was used on metal, the  other probably only on wood. Therefore, it is not surprising to find on  the later machine an outboard or \"tailstock\" support for the work. The  spindle of this support has to travel in unison with the work-driving  spindle so that it is not an unexpected discovery to find that it is  spring-loaded. Figure 5 shows how this spring may be adjusted to  accommodate various lengths of work by moving the attachment screw to  various holes in both the spring and in the frame. Also visible in the  same illustration is a rectangular projection at the other end of the  spring which engages a mating hole in the \"tailstock\" spindle to prevent  its rotation.    [Illustration: Figure 3.--SMALL THREAD-CUTTING LATHE which was made to  be held in a vise during use. It was found as shown here, with only the  operating crank missing. The overall length is approximately 12 inches,  depending on the adjustment of parts. (Smithsonian photo 46525B.)]    Figure 6 shows the traversing spindle and nut removed from the machine.  Provision has been made for doing this so easily that there is every  reason to believe that, originally, there were various different spindle  and nut units which could be interchangeably used in the machine.  Additional evidence tending to support this concept exists in the  cutting tool (fig. 4), which must have been intended for serious work as  it has been carefully fitted in its unsymmetrical socket. The cutting  blade of this tool, which works with a scraping rather than a true  cutting action, is too wide to form a properly proportioned thread when  used with the existing lead screw. This may well indicate that the tool  was made for use with a lead of coarser pitch, now lost.    [Illustration: Figure 4.--THE WORKING AREA of figure 3, showing the tool  and signature. (Smithsonian photo 46525A.)]    Perhaps the most startling feature of this machine when compared with  the machine of the _Hausbuch_, is the absence of a cross-slide for  adjusting the tool. Possibly this can be explained by the blunt scraping  edge on the tool. In actual use, recently, to cut a sample screw, using  a tool similar to the one found in the machine (fig. 7), it was found  advantageous to be free of a cross-slide and thus be able to feed the  tool into the work by feel rather than by rule, as would be done with a  slide rest. In this way, it was possible to thread steel without  tearing, as the cutting pressure could readily be felt and the tool  could release itself from too heavy a cut. Size on several screws could  be repeated by setting the tool to produce the desired diameter when its  supporting arm came to rest against the frame of the machine. The screws  used in the machine itself were apparently made in just such a way. They  were not cut with a die as the thread blends very gradually into the  body of the screw without the characteristic marks left by the cutting  edges of a die. Threads cut with a single-point tool controlled by a  cross-slide usually end even more abruptly than those cut by a die,  while it would be quite simple with a machine of the nature we are  considering to bring the thread to a gentle tapering end as seen in  figure 8 (another view of the screw A in fig. 3) by gradually releasing  the pressure necessary to keep the tool cutting as the end of the  thread was approached.    [Illustration: Figure 5.--SPRING FOR KEEPING THE FOLLOWER SPINDLE  against the work, showing the method and range of adjustment. Note the  rectangular projection to engage a mating socket in the spindle, to  prevent spindle rotation. (Smithsonian photo 46525.)]    [Illustration: Figure 6.--WORK SPINDLE AND ITS NUT removed from the  machine to illustrate how easily another spindle and nut of different  pitch could be substituted. (Smithsonian photo 46525C.)]    That machines of this general type having the lead screw on the axis of  the work were competitive with other methods and other types of machines  over a long period of time may be seen from figures 9 and 10. The  machine, left front in figure 9 and in more intimate detail in figure  10, can be seen to differ little from that shown in _Das  mittelalterliche Hausbuch_ of 1483. The double work-support is, of  course, a great improvement, while the tool-support is regressive since  it lacks a feed screw.    The development of engineering theory, coupled with the rising needs of  industry, particularly with the advent of the Industrial Revolution,  brought about accelerated development of screw-cutting lathes through  the combination of screw-cutting machines with simple lathes as seen in  figure 9 and in detail in figure 11. One important advance shown here  is driving the machine by means of a cord or band so that any means of  rotary power could be applied, not just hand or foot power. Of greater  interest and technical importance to this study is the provision, seen  to better advantage in figure 11, for readily changing from one master  lead screw to another. This had already been achieved in the Manuel  Wetschgi machine, as far as versatility is concerned, although not in  quite such a convenient way.    [Illustration: Figure 7.--THREAD OF MODERN FORM recently cut, using the  old screw and nut but with a new tool. The material threaded is  carbon-steel drill rod. (Smithsonian photo 49276A.)]    Figure 12, the headstock of another and more advanced lathe than shown  in figures 9 and 11 but of the same type, shows \"keys\" (D), each of  which is a partial nut of different pitch to engage with a thread of  mating pitch. The dotted lines in figure 13 show the engaged and  disengaged positions of one of these keys, and figure 14 shows the  spindle with the various leads, C. At D is a grooved collar to be  engaged by the narrow key shown in operating position at the left in  figure 12 for the purpose of controlling the endwise movement of the  spindle when used for ordinary turning instead of thread-cutting. In  return for greater convenience and freedom from the expense of the many  separate spindles, as typified by the Wetschgi machine, a sacrifice has  been made in the length of the thread which can be cut without  interruption.    [Illustration: Figure 8.--BINDING SCREW seen at A in figure 3, showing  the long smooth fadeout of the thread below the shoulder. (Smithsonian  photo 49276.)]    [Illustration: Figure 9.--MAKING SCREWS IN FRANCE in the third quarter  of the 18th century. From _L'Encyclopedie, ou dictionnaire raisonne des  sciences, des arts et des metiers ... receuil de planches sur les  sciences, les arts liberaux, et les arts mechaniques, avec leur  explication_ (Paris: 1762-1772), vol. 9, plate 1.]    [Illustration: Figure 10.--DETAILS OF THE MACHINE in the left foreground  of figure 9, showing the crude tool-support without screw adjustment.  From _L'Encyclopedie_, vol. 9, plate 2.]    This reduction in the length that could conveniently be threaded was no  great drawback on many classes of work. This can be realized from figure  16 which shows a traverse-spindle lathe headstock typical of the  mid-19th century. During the years intervening between the machines of  figures 12 and 16, the general design was greatly improved by removing  the lead screws from the center of the spindle. This made possible a  shorter, much stiffer spindle and supported both ends of the spindle in  one frame or headstock rather than in separate pieces attached to the  bed. The screws were now mounted outside of the spindle-bearings, one at  a time, while the mating nuts were cut partially into the circumference  of a disk which could be turned to bring any particular nut into working  position as required. With this arrangement, a wide variety of leads  either right or left hand could be provided and additional leads could  be fitted at any future time. Screw-cutting lathes of this design were  popular for a very long time with instrument makers and opticians who  had little need to cut screws of great length.    [Illustration: Figure 11.--DETAILS OF THE THREADING LATHE seen in the  right foreground of figure 9 showing the method of drive and support for  the work. From _L'Encyclopedie_, vol. 9, plate 1.]    The demands of expanding industry for greater versatility in the  production of engineering elements late in the 18th century set the  stage for the evolution of more complex machines tending to place the  threaded spindle lathes in eclipse. Maudslay's lathe of 1797-1800 (fig.  15) appeared at this time when industry was receptive to rapid  innovation. Unfortunately, the gearing which once existed to connect the  headstock spindle with the lead screw has long been lost. At this time  it is quite difficult to say with certainty whether the original gear  set offered a variety of ratios, as was true of slightly later Maudslay  lathes, or a fixed ratio. The plausibility of the fixed ratio theory is  supported by the very convenient means, seen in figure 15, for removing  the lead screw in preparation for substitution of one of another pitch.  All that is required is to back off its supporting center at the  tailstock end and withdraw the screw from its split nut[2] and from the  driving clutch near the headstock. This split nut also would have to be  changed to one of a pitch corresponding to that of the screw. While more  expensive than a solid nut, it neatly circumvents the need (and saves  the time involved) to reverse the screw in order to get the tool back to  the point of beginning preliminary to taking another cut. David  Wilkinson's lathe of 1798 (fig. 17) which was developed in Rhode Island  at the same time shows the same method of mounting and driving the  master screw. At least in the United States, this method of changing the  lead screw instead of using change gears remained popular for many  years."]]]
