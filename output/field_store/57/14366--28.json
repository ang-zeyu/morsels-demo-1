[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/2752"],[0,"Martin Guerre (#2)"],[1," but give me water!\"    His tormentor allowed him to swallow a mouthful, then overwhelmed him  with questions as to his family, his friends and fortune, and compelled  him to answer by keeping before his eyes the water which alone could  relieve the fever which devoured him. After this often interrupted  interrogation, the sufferer sank back exhausted, and almost insensible.  But, not yet satisfied, his companion conceived the idea of reviving him  with a few drops of brandy, which quickly brought back the fever, and  excited his brain sufficiently to enable him to answer fresh questions.  The doses of spirit were doubled several times, at the risk of ending  the unhappy man's days then and there: Almost delirious, his head  feeling as if on fire, his sufferings gave way to a feverish excitement,  which took him back to other places and other times: he began to recall  the days of his youth and the country where he lived. But his tongue was  still fettered by a kind of reserve: his secret thoughts, the private  details of his past life were not yet told, and it seemed as though he  might die at any moment. Time was passing, night already coming on, and  it occurred to the merciless questioner to profit by the gathering  darkness. By a few solemn words he aroused the religious feelings of the  sufferer, terrified him by speaking of the punishments of another life  and the flames of hell, until to the delirious fancy of the sick man he  took the form of a judge who could either deliver him to eternal  damnation or open the gates of heaven to him. At length, overwhelmed by  a voice which resounded in his ear like that of a minister of God, the  dying man laid bare his inmost soul before his tormentor, and made his  last confession to him.    Yet a few moments, and the executioner--he deserves no other name--hangs  over his victim, opens his tunic, seizes some papers and a few coins,  half draws his dagger, but thinks better of it; then, contemptuously  spurning the victim, as the other surgeon had done--    \"I might kill you,\" he says, \"but it would be a useless murder; it would  only be hastening your last Sigh by an hour or two, and advancing my  claims to your inheritance by the same space of time.\"    And he adds mockingly:--    \"Farewell, my brother!\"    The wounded soldier utters a feeble groan; the adventurer leaves the  room.    Four months later, a woman sat at the door of a house at one end of the  village of Artigues, near Rieux, and played with a child about nine or  ten years of age. Still young, she had the brown complexion of Southern  women, and her beautiful black hair fell in curls about her face. Her  flashing eyes occasionally betrayed hidden passions, concealed, however,  beneath an apparent indifference and lassitude, and her wasted form  seemed to acknowledge the existence of some secret grief. An observer  would have divined a shattered life, a withered happiness, a soul  grievously wounded.    Her dress was that of a wealthy peasant; and she wore one of the long  gowns with hanging sleeves which were in fashion in the sixteenth  century. The house in front of which she sat belonged to her, so also  the immense field which adjoined the garden. Her attention was divided  between the play of her son and the orders she was giving to an old  servant, when an exclamation from the child startled her.    \"Mother!\" he cried, \"mother, there he is!\"    She looked where the child pointed, and saw a young boy turning the  corner of the street.    \"Yes,\" continued the child, \"that is the lad who, when I was playing  with the other boys yesterday, called me all sorts of bad names.\"    \"What sort of names, my child?\"    \"There was one I did not understand, but it must have been a very bad  one, for the other boys all pointed at me, and left me alone. He called  me--and he said it was only what his mother had told him--he called me a  wicked bastard!\"    His mother's face became purple with indignation. \"What!\" she cried,  \"they dared! . . . What an insult!\"    \"What does this bad word mean, mother?\" asked the child, half frightened  by her anger. \"Is that what they call poor children who have no father?\"    His mother folded him in her arms. \"Oh!\" she continued, \"it is an  infamous slander! These people never saw your father, they have only  been here six years, and this is the eighth since he went away, but this  is abominable! We were married in that church, we came at once to live  in this house, which was my marriage portion, and my poor Martin has  relations and friends here who will not allow his wife to be insulted--\"    \"Say rather, his widow,\" interrupted a solemn voice.    \"Ah! uncle!\" exclaimed the woman, turning towards an old man who had  just emerged from the house.    \"Yes, Bertrande,\" continued the new-comer, \"you must get reconciled to  the idea that my nephew has ceased to exist. I am sure he was not such a  fool as to have remained all this time without letting us hear from him.  He was not the fellow to go off at a tangent, on account of a domestic  quarrel which you have never vouchsafed to explain to me, and to retain  his anger during all these eight years! Where did he go? What did he do?  We none of us know, neither you nor I, nor anybody else. He is assuredly  dead, and lies in some graveyard far enough from here. May God have  mercy on his soul!\"    Bertrande, weeping, made the sign of the cross, and bowed her head upon  her hands.    \"Good-bye, Sanxi,\" said the uncle, tapping the child's,' cheek. Sanxi  turned sulkily away.    There was certainly nothing specially attractive about the uncle: he  belonged to a type which children instinctively dislike, false, crafty,  with squinting eyes which continually appeared to contradict his honeyed  tongue.    \"Bertrande,\" he said, \"your boy is like his father before him, and only  answers my kindness with rudeness.\"    \"Forgive him,\" answered the mother; \"he is very young, and does not  understand the respect due to his father's uncle. I will teach him  better things; he will soon learn that he ought to be grateful for the  care you have taken of his little property.\"    \"No doubt, no doubt,\" said the uncle, trying hard to smile. \"I will give  you a good account of it, for I shall only have to reckon with you two  in future. Come, my dear, believe me, your husband is really dead, and  you have sorrowed quite enough for a good-for-nothing fellow. Think no  more of him.\"    So saying, he departed, leaving the poor young woman a prey to the  saddest thoughts.    Bertrande de Rolls, naturally gifted with extreme sensibility, on which  a careful education had imposed due restraint, had barely completed her  twelfth year when she was married to Martin Guerre, a boy of about the  same age, such precocious unions being then not uncommon, especially in  the Southern provinces. They were generally settled by considerations of  family interest, assisted by the extremely early development habitual to  the climate. The young couple lived for a long time as brother and  sister, and Bertrande, thus early familiar with the idea of domestic  happiness, bestowed her whole affection on the youth whom she had been  taught to regard as her life's companion. He was the Alpha and Omega of  her existence; all her love, all her thoughts, were given to him, and  when their marriage was at length completed, the birth of a son seemed  only another link in the already long existing bond of union. But, as  many wise men have remarked, a uniform happiness, which only attaches  women more and more, has often upon men a precisely contrary effect, and  so it was with Martin Guerre. Of a lively and excitable temperament, he  wearied of a yoke which had been imposed so early, and, anxious to see  the world and enjoy some freedom, he one day took advantage of a  domestic difference, in which Bertrande owned herself to have been  wrong, and left his house and family. He was sought and awaited in vain.  Bertrande spent the first month in vainly expecting his return, then she  betook herself to prayer; but Heaven appeared deaf to her supplications,  the truant returned not. She wished to go in search of him, but the  world is wide, and no single trace remained to guide her. What torture  for a tender heart! What suffering for a soul thirsting for love! What  sleepless nights! What restless vigils! Years passed thus; her son was  growing up, yet not a word reached her from the man she loved so much.  She spoke often of him to the uncomprehending child, she sought to  discover his features in those of her boy, but though she endeavoured to  concentrate her whole affection on her son, she realised that there is  suffering which maternal love cannot console, and tears which it cannot  dry. Consumed by the strength of the sorrow which ever dwelt in her  heart, the poor woman was slowly wasting, worn out by the regrets of the  past, the vain desires of the present, and the dreary prospect of the  future. And now she had been openly insulted, her feelings as a mother  wounded to the quirk; and her husband's uncle, instead of defending and  consoling her, could give only cold counsel and unsympathetic words!    Pierre Guerre, indeed, was simply a thorough egotist. In his youth he  had been charged with usury; no one knew by what means he had become  rich, for the little drapery trade which he called his profession did  not appear to be very profitable.    After his nephew's departure it seemed only natural that he should pose  as the family guardian, and he applied himself to the task of increasing  the little income, but without considering himself bound to give any  account to Bertrande. So, once persuaded that Martin was no more, he was  apparently not unwilling to prolong a situation so much to his own  advantage.    Night was fast coming on; in the dim twilight distant objects became  confused and indistinct. It was the end of autumn, that melancholy  season which suggests so "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/2753"],[0,"Ali Pacha (#2)"],[1,"of  the sixteenth century.    Mouktar Tepeleni, his grandfather, perished in the Turkish expedition  against Corfu, in 1716. Marshal Schullemburg, who defended the island,  having repulsed the enemy with loss, took Mouktar prisoner on Mount San  Salvador, where he was in charge of a signalling party, and with a  barbarity worthy of his adversaries, hung him without trial. It must be  admitted that the memory of this murder must have had the effect of  rendering Ali badly disposed towards Christians.    Mouktar left three sons, two of whom, Salik and Mahomet, were born of  the same mother, a lawful wife, but the mother of the youngest, Veli,  was a slave. His origin was no legal bar to his succeeding like his  brothers. The family was one of the richest in the town of Tepelen,  whose name it bore, it enjoyed an income of six thousand piastres, equal  to twenty thousand francs. This was a large fortune in a poor country,  where, all commodities were cheap. But the Tepeleni family, holding the  rank of beys, had to maintain a state like that of the great financiers  of feudal Europe. They had to keep a large stud of horses, with a great  retinue of servants and men-at-arms, and consequently to incur heavy  expenses; thus they constantly found their revenue inadequate. The most  natural means of raising it which occurred to them was to diminish the  number of those who shared it; therefore the two elder brothers, sons of  the wife, combined against Veli, the son of the slave, and drove him out  of the house. The latter, forced to leave home, bore his fate like a  brave man, and determined to levy exactions on others to compensate him  for the losses incurred through his brothers. He became a freebooter,  patrolling highroads and lanes, with his gun on his shoulder and his  yataghan in his belt, attacking, holding for ransom, or plundering all  whom he encountered.    After some years of this profitable business, he found himself a wealthy  man and chief of a warlike band. Judging that the moment for vengeance  had arrived, he marched for Tepelen, which he reached unsuspected,  crossed the river Vojutza, the ancient Aous, penetrated the streets  unresisted, and presented himself before the paternal house, in which  his brothers, forewarned, had barricaded themselves. He at once besieged  them, soon forced the gates, and pursued them to a tent, in which they  took a final refuge. He surrounded this tent, waited till they were  inside it, and then set fire to the four corners. \"See,\" said he to  those around him, \"they cannot accuse me of vindictive reprisals; my  brothers drove me out of doors, and I retaliate by keeping them at home  for ever.\"    In a few moments he was his father's sole heir and master of Tepelen.  Arrived at the summit of his ambition, he gave up free-booting, and  established himself in the town, of which he became chief ago. He had  already a son by a slave, who soon presented him with another son, and  afterwards with a daughter, so that he had no reason to fear dying  without an heir. But finding himself rich enough to maintain more wives  and bring up many children, he desired to increase his credit by allying  himself to some great family of the country. He therefore solicited and  obtained the hand of Kamco, daughter of a bey of Conitza. This marriage  attached him by the ties of relationship to the principal families of  the province, among others to Kourd Pacha, Vizier of Serat, who was  descended from the illustrious race of Scander Beg. After a few years,  Veli had by his new wife a son named Ali, the subject of this history,  and a daughter named Chainitza.    Ire spite of his intentions to reform, Veli could not entirely give up  his old habits. Although his fortune placed him altogether above small  gains and losses, he continued to amuse himself by raiding from time to  time sheep, goats, and other perquisites, probably to keep his hand in.  This innocent exercise of his taste was not to the fancy of his  neighbours, and brawls and fights recommenced in fine style. Fortune did  not always favour him, and the old mountaineer lost in the town part of  what he had made on the hills. Vexations soured his temper and injured  his health. Notwithstanding the injunctions of Mahomet, he sought  consolation in wine, which soon closed his career. He died in 1754.          CHAPTER II      Ali thus at thirteen years of age was free to indulge in the impetuosity  of his character. From his early youth he had manifested a mettle and  activity rare in young Turks, haughty by nature and self-restrained by  education. Scarcely out of the nursery, he spent his time in climbing  mountains, wandering through forests, scaling precipices, rolling in  snow, inhaling the wind, defying the tempests, breathing out his nervous  energy through every pore. Possibly he learnt in the midst of every kind  of danger to brave everything and subdue everything; possibly in  sympathy with the majesty of nature, he felt aroused in him a need of  personal grandeur which nothing could satiate. In vain his father sought  to calm his savage temper; and restrain his vagabond spirit; nothing was  of, any use. As obstinate as intractable, he set at defiance all efforts  and all precautions. If they shut him up, he broke the door or jumped  out of the window; if they threatened him, he pretended to comply,  conquered by fear, and promised everything that was required, but only  to break his word the first opportunity. He had a tutor specially  attached to his person and charged to supervise all his actions. He  constantly deluded him by fresh tricks, and when he thought himself free  from the consequences, he maltreated him with gross violence. It was  only in his youth, after his father's death, that he became more  manageable; he even consented to learn to read, to please his mother,  whose idol he was, and to whom in return he gave all his affection.    If Kamco had so strong a liking for Ali, it was because she found in  him, not only her blood, but also her character. During the lifetime of  her husband, whom she feared, she seemed only an ordinary woman; but as  soon as his eyes were closed, she gave free scope to the violent  passions which agitated her bosom. Ambitious, bold, vindictive; she  assiduously cultivated the germs of ambition, hardihood, and vengeance  which already strongly showed themselves in the young Ali. \"My son,\" she  was never tired of telling him, \"he who cannot defend his patrimony  richly deserves to lose it. Remember that the property of others is only  theirs so long as they are strong enough to keep it, and that when you  find yourself strong enough to take it from them, it is yours. Success  justifies everything, and everything is permissible to him who has the  power to do it.\"    Ali, when he reached the zenith of his greatness, used to declare that  his success was entirely his mother's work. \"I owe everything to my  mother,\" he said one day to the French Consul; \"for my father, when he  died, left me nothing but a den of wild beasts and a few fields. My  imagination, inflamed by the counsels of her who has given me life twice  over, since she has made me both a man and a vizier, revealed to me the  secret of my destiny. Thenceforward I saw nothing in Tepelen but the  natal air from which I was to spring on the prey which I devoured  mentally. I dreamt of nothing else but power, treasures, palaces, in  short what time has realised and still promises; for the point I have  now reached is not the limit of my hopes.\"    Kamco did not confine herself to words; she employed every means to  increase the fortune of her beloved son and to make him a power. Her  first care was to poison the children of Veli's favourite slave, who had  died before him. Then, at ease about the interior of her family, she  directed her attention to the exterior. Renouncing all the habit of her  sex, she abandoned the veil and the distaff, and took up arms, under  pretext of maintaining the rights of her children. She collected round  her her husband's old partisans, whom she attached to her, service, some  by presents, others by various favours, and she gradually enlisted all  the lawless and adventurous men in Toscaria. With their aid, she made  herself all powerful in Tepelen, and inflicted the most rigorous  persecutions on such as remained hostile to her.    But the inhabitants of the two adjacent villages of Kormovo and Kardiki,  fearing lest this terrible woman, aided by her son, now grown into a  man, should strike a blow against their independence; made a secret  alliance against her, with the object of putting her out of the way the  first convenient opportunity. Learning one day that Ali had started on a  distant expedition with his best soldiers; they surprised Tepelen under  cover of night, and carried off Kamco and her daughter Chainitza  captives to Kardiki. It was proposed to put them to death; and  sufficient evidence to justify their execution was not wanting; but  their beauty saved their lives; their captors preferred to revenge  themselves by licentiousness rather than by murder. Shut up all day in  prison, they only emerged at night to pass into the arms of the men who  had won them by lot the previous morning. This state of things lasted  for a month, at the end of which a Greek of Argyro-Castron, named G.  Malicovo, moved by compassion for their horrible fate, ransomed them for  twenty thousand piastres, and took them back to Tepelen.    Ali had just returned. He was accosted by his mother and sister, pale  with fatigue, shame, and rage. They told him what had taken place, with  cries and tears, and Kamco added, fixing her distracted eyes upon him,  \"My son! my son! my soul will enjoy no peace till Kormovo and Kardikil  destroyed by thy scimitar, will no longer exist to bear witness to my  dishonour.\"    Ali, in whom this sight and this story had aroused, sanguinary passions,  promised a"]]]
