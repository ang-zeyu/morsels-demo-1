As regards life-zones, the  occurrence of _Dipodomys ordii_ in the lower part of the Lower Sonoran  Life-zone on the off-shore beach 88 and 90 miles south of Matamoros is  low zonally and perhaps is at or near the zonal margin of the range of  the species. The crabs and worms conceivably are two of the  environmental features inhospitable to the rats.    _Specimens examined._--Total, 14, all from Tamaulipas, Mexico, as  follows: 88 mi. S and 10 mi. W Matamoros, 7; 90 mi. S and 10 mi. W  Matamoros, 7.    When Setzer (Univ. Kansas Publ., Mus. Nat. Hist., 1:473-573, December  27, 1949) reviewed the subspecies of _Dipodomys ordii_ he lacked  specimens of _Dipodomys ordii compactus_ from the type locality or from  anywhere else on Padre Island. He used as representative of _D. o.  compactus_ specimens from Mustang Island, Texas, the island next  northeast of Padre Island. Through the courtesy of Mr. Stanley P. Young,  Dr. Hartley H.T. Jackson and Miss Viola S. Schantz, of the United  States Biological Surveys Collection, I have examined topotypes of _D.  o. compactus_ from Padre Island. This examination discloses that the  kangaroo rats on Padre Island and Mustang Island are significantly  different. Those from Mustang Island may be named and described as  follows:      MEASUREMENTS (IN MILLIMETERS) OF ADULT MALES OF FOUR SUBSPECIES OF  DIPODOMYS ORDII    Key:  A Total length                         F Breadth across maxillary arches  B Length of tail                       G Width of rostrum  C Length of hind foot                  H Length of nasals  D Greatest length of skull             I Least interorbital width  E Greatest breadth across bullae       J Basilar length  ----------------------------------------------------------------------    _D. o. largus_, type locality (K.U.)

Nat. Hist.,  Univ. Kansas, from Mustang Island, 14 mi. SW Port Aransas, Aransas  County, Texas; obtained 30 June 1948 by W.K. Clark; original No. 543.    _Range._--Known from Mustang Island only.    _Diagnosis._--Size medium (see measurements). Color pale, and as  described for _D. o. parvabullatus_. Skull small; auditory bullae  (actually and relative to remainder of skull) smaller than in any other  known kind of _Dipodomys_, except _D. o. parvabullatus_ in which breadth  across bullae is approximately the same; notably narrow across maxillary  processes of zygomatic arches.    _Comparisons._--From _Dipodomys ordii sennetti_ (J.A. Allen) of the  mainland, _D. o. largus_ differs in: Color paler on pigmented areas;  white areas more extensive; skull averaging smaller except in basilar  length and length of nasals which are approximately the same as in _D.  o. sennetti_. From _Dipodomys ordii compactus_ True of Padre Island, _D.  o. largus_ differs in: Body longer; tail shorter; skull narrower across  tympanic bullae and across maxillary processes of zygomatic arches;  nasals shorter. From _Dipodomys ordii parvabullatus_ of the coastal  island south of Padre Island, along the gulf coast of Tamaulipas, _D. o.  largus_ differs in: Body and tail longer; basilar length of skull  averaging less; breadth across maxillary processes of zygomatic arches  greater; premaxillae not extending so far behind nasals.    _Remarks._--_D. o. largus_ resembles _D. o. compactus_ in external  proportions and _D. o. parvabullatus_ in cranial proportions. The degree  of difference between _D. o. compactus_ and _D. o. largus_ is less than  between _D. o. compactus_ and _D. o. parvabullatus_. To me, the three  subspecies mentioned in the preceding sentence are indistinguishable in  color.    Two of the eleven specimens of _D. o. largus_ are of the light color  phase (upper parts Cartridge Buff) whereas all but two of the eleven  specimens of _D. o. compactus_ are of the light color phase. Each of the  cheek-teeth of the upper jaw of _D. o. largus_ has a complete ring of  enamel around the dentine of the occlusal surface, as described by  Setzer (Univ. Kansas Publ., Mus. Nat. Hist., 1:517, December 27, 1949)  for _D. o. compactus_. The upper dentitions of ten specimens of _D. o.  compactus_ examined by me in this respect reveal a total of only five  teeth (in four individual animals) that have the enamel ring incomplete;  one premolar and three molars are incomplete on the lingual side and one  molar is incomplete on the labial side.    Two specimens from Bagdad, Tamaulipas, in the delta of the Rio Grande  (Nos. 116485 and 11487, U.S.N.M., Biol. Surv. Coll.), are referred to  _D. o. compactus_ on basis of long body and long tail. The specimens,  both Light Ochraceous-Buff, are so young that not all of the enamel is  worn off the crowns of the cheek-teeth. Specimens of _D. o. compactus_,  _D. o. parvabullatus_ and _D. o. sennetti_ of comparable age are not  available, and it, therefore, is impossible to know whether size and  shape of the skull in the population at Bagdad are the same as they are  in _D. o. compactus_ of Padre Island.    _Specimens examined._--Total, 11, all from Texas. Aransas County:  Mustang Island, 14 mi. SW Port Aransas.      Sigmodon hispidus solus new subspecies    Hispid Cotton Rat    _Type._--Male, adult, skull and skin; No. 35468, Mus. Nat. Hist., Univ.  Kansas; from island, 88 mi. S and 10 mi. W Matamoros, Tamaulipas,  Mexico; 22 March 1950; obtained by E.R. Hall and Curt von Wedel;  original No. 6806 E.R. Hall.    _Range._--Known from the type locality only but probably occurring on  most of the chain of islands off the coast of Tamaulipas.    _Diagnosis._--Small; hind foot short; rostrum broad.    _Comparison._--From its nearest relative, geographically and  morphologically, _Sigmodon hispidus berlandieri_ Baird of the adjacent  mainland, _S. h. solus_ differs in smaller size, and a rostrum that is  broader in relation to the length of the skull.    _Remarks._--On the last night of our stay on the island, traps set in  grass approximately 20 inches high, yielded one pair of _Sigmodon_. The  color is lighter than in the average of specimens from the mainland (for  instance those from Victoria and Soto la Marina) but can be matched by  selected specimens. In animals of equal age, the hind foot and basilar  length are shorter in _S. h. solus_ than in _berlandieri_. The  broadening of the rostrum, which occurs with advanced age, is attained  in _solus_ when the skull is yet short; the maximum breadth of the  rostrum in the adults is more, instead of less, than a fourth of the  basilar length.    _Measurements._--The following measurements are of specimens in which  the occlusal face of each molar tooth is worn flat. The first  measurement is of the holotype followed by the corresponding measurement  of a male of _T. b. berlandieri_, No. 116466 from Camargo, Tamaulipas,  in parentheses. The third measurement is that of the female from the  type locality of _S. h. solus_ and it is followed by the corresponding  measurement of a female of _T. b. berlandieri_, No. 116462 from Camargo,  Tamaulipas. Total length, 266 (298),--(293); length of tail, 113  (135),--(137); length of head and body, 153 (163), 155 (156); length of  hind foot, 30 (35), 30 (33); basilar length of Hensel, 28.2 (28.9); 27.9  (29.0); zygomatic breadth, 19.5 (--), 19.0 (20.8); mastoidal breadth,  13.9 (14.4), 13.9 (14.8); greatest breadth of rostrum, 7.2 (7.3), 7.8  (7.2); length of nasals, 14.6 (14.1), 13.4 (14.2); crown length of upper  molar teeth, 6.3 (6.1), 6.3 (5.9).    _Specimens examined._--Two from the type locality.      Lepus californicus curti new subspecies    Black-tailed Jack Rabbit    _Type._--Female, adult, skull and skin, No. 35470, Mus. Nat. Hist.,  Univ. Kansas; from island, 88 miles south and 10 miles west of  Matamoros, Tamaulipas, Mexico; obtained 19 March 1950 by E.R. Hall;  original No. 6783.    _Range._--Islands along coast of Tamaulipas, Mexico.    _Diagnosis._--Color pale; size small; ears short; tympanic bullae small.    _Comparisons._--From _Lepus californicus merriami_ Mearns (specimens  from Fort Clark, Brownsville and intermediate localities), _L. c. curti_  differs in paler color, lesser size except ear that is of almost same  length and except"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/29138"],[0,"The Doorway (#2)"],[1,"desk.
