Cream, that is so delicious when it thickens,  Pleased the Cat best. The Fox liked little chickens.    With stomachs filled, they presently grew prouder,  And each began to try to talk the louder--  Bragging about his skill, and strength, and cunning.  \"Pooh!\" said the Fox. \"You ought to see me running.  Besides, I have a hundred tricks. You Cat, you!  What can you do when Mr. Dog comes at you?\"  \"To tell the truth,\" the Cat said, \"though it grieve me  I've but one trick. Yet that's enough--believe me!\"    There came a pack of fox-hounds--yelping, baying.  \"Pardon me\", said the Cat. \"I can't be staying.  This is my trick.\" And up a tree he scurried,  Leaving the Fox below a trifle worried.    In vain he tried his hundred tricks and ruses  (The sort of thing that Mr. Dog confuses)--  Doubling, and seeking one hole, then another--  Smoked out of each until he thought he'd smother.  At last as he once more came out of cover,  Two nimble dogs pounced on him--All was over!        The Hen With The Golden Eggs.    To this lesson in greed,  Pray, little ones, heed:    Each day, we are told,  A most wonderful Hen  Laid an egg made of gold  For this meanest of men.    So greedy was he,  He was not satisfied.  \"What is one egg to me?  I want all that' inside!\"    He cut off her head,  And began to explore.  But the poor hen was dead.  And could lay eggs no more.        The Dog And His Image.    A foolish Dog, who carried in his jaw  A juicy bone,  Looked down into a stream, and there he saw  Another one,  Splash! In he plunged.. The image disappeared--  The meat he had was gone.  Indeed, he nearly sank,  And barely reached the bank.        The Acorn and the Pumpkin.    Once there was a country bumpkin  Who observed a great big pumpkin  To a slender stem attached;  While upon an oak tree nourished,  Little acorns grew and flourished.  \"Bah!\" said he. \"That's badly matched.\"    \"If, despite my humble station,  I'd a hand in this Creation,  Pumpkins on the oaks would be;  And the acorn, light and little,  On this pumpkin stem so brittle  Would be placed by clever Me.\"    Then, fatigued with so much thought, he  Rest beneath the oak tree sought. He  Soon in slumber found repose  But, alas! An acorn, falling  On the spot where he lay sprawling,  Hit him--plump!--Upon the nose.    Up he jumped--a wiser bumpkin.  \"Gosh!\" he said. \"Suppose a pumpkin  Came a-fallin' on my face!  After all, if I had made things,  I'll allow that I'm afraid things  Might be some what out of place.\"        The Raven And The Fox.    Mr. Raven was perched upon a limb,  And Reynard the Fox looked up at him;  For the Raven held in his great big beak  A morsel the Fox would go far to seek.    Said the Fox, in admiring tones: \"My word!  Sir Raven, you are a handsome bird.  Such feathers! If you would only sing,  The birds of these woods would call you King.\"    The Raven, who did not see the joke,  Forgot that his voice was just a croak.  He opened his beak, in his foolish pride--  And down fell the morsel the Fox had spied.    \"Ha-ha!\" said the Fox. \"And now you see  You should not listen to flattery.  Vanity, Sir is a horrid vice--  I'm sure the lesson is worth the price.\"        The City Mouse And The Country Mouse.    A City Mouse, with ways polite,  A Country Mouse invited  To sup with him and spend the night.  Said Country Mouse: \"De--lighted!\"  In truth it proved a royal treat,  With everything that's good to eat.    Alas! When they had just begun  To gobble their dinner,  A knock was heard that made them run.  The City Mouse seemed thinner.  And as they scampered and turned tail,  He saw the Country Mouse grow pale.    The knocking ceased. A false alarm!  The City Mouse grew braver.  \"Come back!\" he cried. \"No, no! The farm,  Where I'll not quake or quaver,  Suits me,\" replied the Country Mouse.  \"You're welcome to your city house.\"        The Lion And The Gnat.      The Lion once said to the Gnat: \"You brat,  Clear out just as quick as you can, now--s'cat!  If you meddle with me  I will not guarantee  That you won't be slammed perfectly flat--  D'ye see?\"    Said the Gnat: \"Because you're called King--you  thing!--  You fancy that you will make me take wing.  Why, an ox weighs much more,  Yet I drive him before  When I get good and ready to sting.  Now, roar!\"    Then loudly his trumpet he blew. And--whew!  How fiercely and fast at his foe he flew.  From the tail to the toes  He draws blood as he goes.  Then he starts in to sting and to chew  His nose.    Sir Lion was mad with the pain. In vain  He roared and he foamed and he shook his mane.  All the beasts that were nigh  Fled in fear from his cry.  But the Gnat only stung him again--  In the eye.    He looked and laughed as he saw--Haw, Haw!--  The Lion self-torn by his tooth and claw,  So His Majesty's hide  With his own blood was dyed.  Said the Gnat: \"Shall I serve you up raw--  Or fried?\"    It's finished. The Lion's loud roar is o'er.  He's bitten and beaten, he's sick and sore.  But a spider's web spread  Trapped the Gnat as he sped  With the news...He will never fight more--  He's dead!        The Dove And The Ant.    An Ant who in a brook would drink  Fell off the bank. He tried  To swim, and felt his courage sink--  This ocean seemed so wide.  But for a dove who flew above  He would have drowned and died.    The friendly Dove within her beak  A bridge of grass-stem bore:  On this the Ant, though worn and weak.  Contrived to reach the shore  Said he: \"The tact of this kind act  I'll cherish evermore.\"    Behold! A barefoot wretch went by  With slingshot in his hand.  Said he: \"You'll make a pigeon pie  That will be kind of grand.\"  He meant to murder the gentle bird--  Who did not understand.    The Ant then stung him on the heel  (So quick to see the sling).  He turned his head, and missed a meal:  The pigeon pie took wing.  And so the Dove lived on to love--  Beloved by everything.        The Fox And The Grapes.    Rosy and ripe, and ready to box,  The grapes hang high o'er the hungry Fox.--  He pricks up his ears, and his eye he cocks.    Ripe and rosy, yet so high!--  He gazes at them with a greedy eye,  And knows he must eat and drink--or die.    When the jump proves to be beyond his power--  \"Pooh!\" says the Fox. \"Let the pigs devour  Fruit of that sort. Those grapes are sour!\"        The Ass In The Lion's Skin.    An Ass in The Lion's skin arrayed  Made everybody fear.  And this was queer,  Because he was himself afraid.  Yet everywhere he strayed  The people ran like deer.    Ah, ah! He is betrayed:  No lion has that long and hairy ears.    Old Martin spied the tip; and country folk  Who are not in the secret of the joke,  With open mouths and eyes  Stare at old Martin's prize--  A Lion led to mill, with neck in yoke.        The Fox And The Stork.    Old Father Fox, who was known to be mean,  Invited Dame Stork in to dinner.  There was nothing but soup that could scarcely be seen:--  Soup never was served any thinner.  And the worst of it was, as I'm bound to relate,  Father Fox dished it up on a flat china plate.    Dame Stork, as you know, has a very long beak:  Not a crumb or drop could she gather  Had she pecked at the plate every day in the week.  But as for the Fox--sly old Father:  With his tongue lapping soup at a scandalous rate,  He licked up the last bit and polished the plate.    Pretty soon Mistress Stork spread a feast of her own;  Father Fox was invited to share it.  He came, and he saw, and he gave a great groan:  The stork had known how to prepare it.  She had meant to get even, and now was her turn:  Father Fox was invited to eat from an urn.    The urn's mouth was small, and it had a long neck;  The food in it smelled most delightful.  Dame Stork, with her beak in, proceeded to peck;  But the Fox found that fasting is frightful.  Home he sneaked. On his way there he felt his ears burn  When he thought of the Stork and her tall, tricky urn.        The Monkey And The Cat.    Jocko the Monkey, Mouser--his chum, the Cat,  Had the same master. Both were sleek and fat,  And mischievous. If anything went wrong,  The neighbors where not blamed. Be sure of that.    Jocko, 'tis said was something of a thief;  Mouser, if truth be told, would just as lief  Much stolen cheese as chase the midnight mouse.  The praise bestowed on either must be brief.    One day these rogues, stretched flat before the fire,  Saw chestnuts roassting. \"Ah! Could we conspire  To jerk them out,\" said Jocko, \"from the coals,  We'd smash the shells and have our heart's desire.    \"Come, Brother Mouser! This day 'tis your turn  To do some bold and desperate thing to earn  A reputation. You, who are so quick,  Snatch out the nuts before they start to burn.    \"Alas! That I, a Monkey, was not made  To play with fire. But you are not afraid.\"  So Mouser--pleased, like many a cat or man,  With pretty words--sly Jocko's wish obeyed.    Into the fire he put a practiced paw:  Out came a chestnut clinging to his claw--  Another and another. As they dropped  Jocko devoured them, whether roast or raw.    A servant enters. Off the robbers run.  Jocko, you may be sure, enjoyed the fun.  But Mouser's paw is sadly singed--for what?  Just to get nuts for Jocko. He got none.        The Hare And The Tortoise.    Said the Tortoise one day to the Hare:  \"I'll run you a race if you dare.  I'll bet you cannot  Arrive at that spot  As quickly as I can get there.\"    Quoth the Hare: \"You are surely insane.  Pray, what has affected your brain?  You seem pretty sick.  Call a doctor in--quick,  And let him prescribe for your pain.\"    \"Never mind,\" said the Tortoise. \"Let's run!  Will you bet me?\" \"Why, certainly.\" \"Done!\"  While the slow Tortoise creeps  Mr. Hare makes four leaps,  And then loafs around in the sun.    It seemed such a one-sided race,  To win was almost a disgrace.

For these are the subjects of all such. If  we call an individual man 'skilled in grammar', the predicate is  applicable also to the species and to the genus to which he belongs.  This law holds good in all cases.    It is a common characteristic of all substance that it is never present  in a subject. For primary substance is neither present in a subject nor  predicated of a subject; while, with regard to secondary substances, it  is clear from the following arguments (apart from others) that they are  not present in a subject. For 'man' is predicated of the individual  man, but is not present in any subject: for manhood is not present in  the individual man. In the same way, 'animal' is also predicated of the  individual man, but is not present in him. Again, when a thing is  present in a subject, though the name may quite well be applied to that  in which it is present, the definition cannot be applied. Yet of  secondary substances, not only the name, but also the definition,  applies to the subject: we should use both the definition of the  species and that of the genus with reference to the individual man.  Thus substance cannot be present in a subject.    Yet this is not peculiar to substance, for it is also the case that  differentiae cannot be present in subjects. The characteristics  'terrestrial' and 'two-footed' are predicated of the species 'man', but  not present in it. For they are not in man. Moreover, the definition of  the differentia may be predicated of that of which the differentia  itself is predicated. For instance, if the characteristic 'terrestrial'  is predicated of the species 'man', the definition also of that  characteristic may be used to form the predicate of the species 'man':  for 'man' is terrestrial.    The fact that the parts of substances appear to be present in the  whole, as in a subject, should not make us apprehensive lest we should  have to admit that such parts are not substances: for in explaining the  phrase 'being present in a subject', we stated' that we meant  'otherwise than as parts in a whole'.    It is the mark of substances and of differentiae that, in all  propositions of which they form the predicate, they are predicated  univocally. For all such propositions have for their subject either the  individual or the species. It is true that, inasmuch as primary  substance is not predicable of anything, it can never form the  predicate of any proposition. But of secondary substances, the species  is predicated of the individual, the genus both of the species and of  the individual. Similarly the differentiae are predicated of the  species and of the individuals. Moreover, the definition of the species  and that of the genus are applicable to the primary substance, and that  of the genus to the species. For all that is predicated of the  predicate will be predicated also of the subject. Similarly, the  definition of the differentiae will be applicable to the species and to  the individuals. But it was stated above that the word 'univocal' was  applied to those things which had both name and definition in common.  It is, therefore, established that in every proposition, of which  either substance or a differentia forms the predicate, these are  predicated univocally.    All substance appears to signify that which is individual. In the case  of primary substance this is indisputably true, for the thing is a  unit. In the case of secondary substances, when we speak, for instance,  of 'man' or 'animal', our form of speech gives the impression that we  are here also indicating that which is individual, but the impression  is not strictly true; for a secondary substance is not an individual,  but a class with a certain qualification; for it is not one and single  as a primary substance is; the words 'man', 'animal', are predicable of  more than one subject.    Yet species and genus do not merely indicate quality, like the term  'white'; 'white' indicates quality and nothing further, but species and  genus determine the quality with reference to a substance: they signify  substance qualitatively differentiated. The determinate qualification  covers a larger field in the case of the genus that in that of the  species: he who uses the word 'animal' is herein using a word of wider  extension than he who uses the word 'man'.    Another mark of substance is that it has no contrary. What could be the  contrary of any primary substance, such as the individual man or  animal? It has none. Nor can the species or the genus have a contrary.  Yet this characteristic is not peculiar to substance, but is true of  many other things, such as quantity. There is nothing that forms the  contrary of 'two cubits long' or of 'three cubits long', or of 'ten',  or of any such term. A man may contend that 'much' is the contrary of  'little', or 'great' of 'small', but of definite quantitative terms no  contrary exists.    Substance, again, does not appear to admit of variation of degree. I do  not mean by this that one substance cannot be more or less truly  substance than another, for it has already been stated that this is  the case; but that no single substance admits of varying degrees within  itself. For instance, one particular substance, 'man', cannot be more  or less man either than himself at some other time or than some other  man. One man cannot be more man than another, as that which is white  may be more or less white than some other white object, or as that  which is beautiful may be more or less beautiful than some other  beautiful object. The same quality, moreover, is said to subsist in a  thing in varying degrees at different times. A body, being white, is  said to be whiter at one time than it was before, or, being warm, is  said to be warmer or less warm than at some other time. But substance  is not said to be more or less that which it is: a man is not more  truly a man at one time than he was before, nor is anything, if it is  substance, more or less what it is. Substance, then, does not admit of  variation of degree.    The most distinctive mark of substance appears to be that, while  remaining numerically one and the same, it is capable of admitting  contrary qualities. From among things other than substance, we should  find ourselves unable to bring forward any which possessed this mark.  Thus, one and the same colour cannot be white and black. Nor can the  same one action be good and bad: this law holds good with everything  that is not substance. But one and the selfsame substance, while  retaining its identity, is yet capable of admitting contrary qualities.  The same individual person is at one time white, at another black, at  one time warm, at another cold, at one time good, at another bad. This  capacity is found nowhere else, though it might be maintained that a  statement or opinion was an exception to the rule. The same statement,  it is agreed, can be both true and false. For if the statement 'he is  sitting' is true, yet, when the person in question has risen, the same  statement will be false. The same applies to opinions. For if any one  thinks truly that a person is sitting, yet, when that person has risen,  this same opinion, if still held, will be false. Yet although this  exception may be allowed, there is, nevertheless, a difference in the  manner in which the thing takes place. It is by themselves changing  that substances admit contrary qualities. It is thus that that which  was hot becomes cold, for it has entered into a different state.  Similarly that which was white becomes black, and that which was bad  good, by a process of change; and in the same way in all other cases it  is by changing that substances are capable of admitting contrary  qualities. But statements and opinions themselves remain unaltered in  all respects: it is by the alteration in the facts of the case that the  contrary quality comes to be theirs. The statement 'he is sitting'  remains unaltered, but it is at one time true, at another false,  according to circumstances. What has been said of statements applies  also to opinions. Thus, in respect of the manner in which the thing  takes place, it is the peculiar mark of substance that it should be  capable of admitting contrary qualities; for it is by itself changing  that it does so.    If, then, a man should make this exception and contend that statements  and opinions are capable of admitting contrary qualities, his  contention is unsound. For statements and opinions are said to have  this capacity, not because they themselves undergo modification, but  because this modification occurs in the case of something else. The  truth or falsity of a statement depends on facts, and not on any power  on the part of the statement itself of admitting contrary qualities. In  short, there is nothing which can alter the nature of statements and  opinions. As, then, no change takes place in themselves, these cannot  be said to be capable of admitting contrary qualities.    But it is by reason of the modification which takes place within the  substance itself that a substance is said to be capable of admitting  contrary qualities; for a substance admits within itself either disease  or health, whiteness or blackness. It is in this sense that it is said  to be capable of admitting contrary qualities.    To sum up, it is a distinctive mark of substance, that, while remaining  numerically one and the same, it is capable of admitting contrary  qualities, the modification taking place through a change in the  substance itself.    Let these remarks suffice on the subject of substance.        Part 6    Quantity is either discrete or continuous. Moreover, some quantities  are such that each part of the whole has a relative position to the  other parts: others have within them no such relation of part to part.    Instances of "]]]
