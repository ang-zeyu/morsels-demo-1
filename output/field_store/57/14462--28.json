[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/30754"],[0,"The Stones of Venice, Volume 1 (of 3) (#2)"],[1," repair my error by a better one.    I have not, however, written carelessly; nor should I in any wise have  expressed doubt of the security of the following argument, but that it  is physically impossible for me, being engaged quite as much with  mountains, and clouds, and trees, and criticism of painting, as with  architecture, to verify, as I should desire, the expression of every  sentence bearing upon empirical and technical matters. Life is not long  enough; nor does a day pass by without causing me to feel more bitterly  the impossibility of carrying out to the extent which I should desire,  the separate studies which general criticism continually forces me to  undertake. I can only assure the reader, that he will find the certainty  of every statement I permit myself to make, increase with its  importance; and that, for the security of the final conclusions of the  following essay, as well as for the resolute veracity of its account of  whatever facts have come under my own immediate cognizance, I will  pledge myself to the uttermost.    It was necessary, to the accomplishment of the purpose of the work (of  which account is given in the First Chapter), that I should establish  some canons of judgment, which the general reader should thoroughly  understand, and, if it pleased him, accept, before we took cognizance,  together, of any architecture whatsoever. It has taken me more time and  trouble to do this than I expected; but, if I have succeeded, the thing  done will be of use for many other purposes than that to which it is now  put. The establishment of these canons, which I have called \"the  Foundations,\" and some account of the connection of Venetian  architecture with that of the rest of Europe, have filled the present  volume. The second will, I hope, contain all I have to say about Venice  itself.    It was of course inexpedient to reduce drawings of crowded details to  the size of an octavo volume,--I do not say impossible, but inexpedient;  requiring infinite pains on the part of the engraver, with no result  except farther pains to the beholder. And as, on the other hand, folio  books are not easy reading, I determined to separate the text and the  unreducible plates. I have given, with the principal text, all the  illustrations absolutely necessary to the understanding of it, and, in  the detached work, such additional text as has special reference to the  larger illustrations.    A considerable number of these larger plates were at first intended to  be executed in tinted lithography; but, finding the result  unsatisfactory, I have determined to prepare the principal subjects for  mezzotinting,--a change of method requiring two new drawings to be made  of every subject; one a carefully penned outline for the etcher, and  then a finished drawing upon the etching. This work does not proceed  fast, while I am also occupied with the completion of the text; but the  numbers of it will appear as fast as I can prepare them.    For the illustrations of the body of the work itself, I have used any  kind of engraving which seemed suited to the subjects--line and  mezzotint, on steel, with mixed lithographs and woodcuts, at  considerable loss of uniformity in the appearance of the volume, but, I  hope, with advantage, in rendering the character of the architecture it  describes. And both in the plates and the text I have aimed chiefly at  clear intelligibility; that any one, however little versed in the  subject, might be able to take up the book, and understand what it meant  forthwith. I have utterly failed of my purpose, if I have not made all  the essential parts of the essay intelligible to the least learned, and  easy to the most desultory readers, who are likely to take interest in  the matter at all. There are few passages which even require so much as  an acquaintance with the elements of Euclid, and these may be missed,  without harm to the sense of the rest, by every reader to whom they may  appear mysterious; and the architectural terms necessarily employed  (which are very few) are explained as they occur, or in a note; so that,  though I may often be found trite or tedious, I trust that I shall not  be obscure. I am especially anxious to rid this essay of ambiguity,  because I want to gain the ear of all kinds of persons. Every man has,  at some time of his life, personal interest in architecture. He has  influence on the design of some public building; or he has to buy, or  build, or alter his own house. It signifies less whether the knowledge  of other arts be general or not; men may live without buying pictures or  statues: but, in architecture, all must in some way commit themselves;  they _must_ do mischief, and waste their money, if they do not know how  to turn it to account. Churches, and shops, and warehouses, and  cottages, and small row, and place, and terrace houses, must be built,  and lived in, however joyless or inconvenient. And it is assuredly  intended that all of us should have knowledge, and act upon our  knowledge, in matters with which we are daily concerned, and not to be  left to the caprice of architects or mercy of contractors. There is not,  indeed, anything in the following essay bearing on the special forms and  needs of modern buildings; but the principles it inculcates are  universal; and they are illustrated from the remains of a city which  should surely be interesting to the men of London, as affording the  richest existing examples of architecture raised by a mercantile  community, for civil uses, and domestic magnificence.

Ancient"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/30755"],[0,"The Stones of Venice, Volume 2 (of 3), (#2)"],[1,"the prow  turned aside under the mighty cornices that half met over the narrow  canal, where the plash of the water followed close and loud, ringing  along the marble by the boat's side; and when at last that boat darted  forth upon the breadth of silver sea, across which the front of the  Ducal palace, flushed with its sanguine veins, looks to the snowy dome  of Our Lady of Salvation,[2] it was no marvel that the mind should be so  deeply entranced by the visionary charm of a scene so beautiful and so  strange, as to forget the darker truths of its history and its being.  Well might it seem that such a city had owed her existence rather to the  rod of the enchanter, than the fear of the fugitive; that the waters  which encircled her had been chosen for the mirror of her state, rather  than the shelter of her nakedness; and that all which in nature was wild  or merciless,--Time and Decay, as well as the waves and tempests,--had  been won to adorn her instead of to destroy, and might still spare, for  ages to come, that beauty which seemed to have fixed for its throne the  sands of the hour-glass as well as of the sea.    Sec. II. And although the last few eventful years, fraught with change to  the face of the whole earth, have been more fatal in their influence on  Venice than the five hundred that preceded them; though the noble  landscape of approach to her can now be seen no more, or seen only by a  glance, as the engine slackens its rushing on the iron line; and though  many of her palaces are for ever defaced, and many in desecrated ruins,  there is still so much of magic in her aspect, that the hurried  traveller, who must leave her before the wonder of that first aspect has  been worn away, may still be led to forget the humility of her origin,  and to shut his eyes to the depth of her desolation. They, at least, are  little to be envied, in whose hearts the great charities of the  imagination lie dead, and for whom the fancy has no power to repress the  importunity of painful impressions, or to raise what is ignoble, and  disguise what is discordant, in a scene so rich in its remembrances, so  surpassing in its beauty. But for this work of the imagination there  must be no permission during the task which is before us. The impotent  feelings of romance, so singularly characteristic of this century, may  indeed gild, but never save the remains of those mightier ages to which  they are attached like climbing flowers; and they must be torn away from  the magnificent fragments, if we would see them as they stood in their  own strength. Those feelings, always as fruitless as they are fond, are  in Venice not only incapable of protecting, but even of discerning, the  objects to which they ought to have been attached. The Venice of modern  fiction and drama is a thing of yesterday, a mere efflorescence of  decay, a stage dream which the first ray of daylight must dissipate into  dust. No prisoner, whose name is worth remembering, or whose sorrow  deserved sympathy, ever crossed that \"Bridge of Sighs,\" which is the  centre of the Byronic ideal of Venice; no great merchant of Venice ever  saw that Rialto under which the traveller now passes with breathless  interest: the statue which Byron makes Faliero address as of one of his  great ancestors was erected to a soldier of fortune a hundred and fifty  years after Faliero's death; and the most conspicuous parts of the city  have been so entirely altered in the course of the last three centuries,  that if Henry Dandolo or Francis Foscari could be summoned from their  tombs, and stood each on the deck of his galley at the entrance of the  Grand Canal, that renowned entrance, the painter's favorite subject, the  novelist's favorite scene, where the water first narrows by the steps of  the Church of La Salute,--the mighty Doges would not know in what spot  of the world they stood, would literally not recognize one stone of the  great city, for whose sake, and by whose ingratitude, their grey hairs  had been brought down with bitterness to the grave. The remains of  _their_ Venice lie hidden behind the cumbrous masses which were the  delight of the nation in its dotage; hidden in many a grass-grown court,  and silent pathway, and lightless canal, where the slow waves have  sapped their foundations for five hundred years, and must soon prevail  over them for ever. It must be our task to glean and gather them forth,  and restore out of them some faint image of the lost city, more gorgeous  a thousand-fold than that which now exists, yet not created in the  day-dream of the prince, nor by the ostentation of the noble, but built  by iron hands and patient hearts, contending against the adversity of  nature and the fury of man, so that its wonderfulness cannot be grasped  by the indolence of imagination, but only after frank inquiry into the  true nature of that wild and solitary scene, whose restless tides and  trembling sands did indeed shelter the birth of the city, but long  denied her dominion.    Sec. III. When the eye falls casually on a map of Europe, there is no  feature by which it is more likely to be arrested than the strange  sweeping loop formed by the junction of the Alps and Apennines, and  enclosing the great basin of Lombardy. This return of the mountain chain  upon itself causes a vast difference in the character of the  distribution of its debris on its opposite sides. The rock fragments and  sediment which the torrents on the north side of the Alps bear into the  plains are distributed over a vast extent of country, and, though here  and there lodged in beds of enormous thickness, soon permit the firm  substrata to appear from underneath them; but all the torrents which  descend from the southern side of the High Alps, and from the northern  slope of the Apennines, meet concentrically in the recess or mountain  bay which the two ridges enclose; every fragment which thunder breaks  out of their battlements, and every grain of dust which the summer rain  washes from their pastures, is at last laid at rest in the blue sweep of  the Lombardic plain; and that plain must have risen within its rocky  barriers as a cup fills with wine, but for two contrary influences which  continually depress, or disperse from its surface, the accumulation of  the ruins of ages.    Sec. IV. I will not tax the reader's faith in modern science by insisting  on the singular depression of the surface of Lombardy, which appears for  many centuries to have taken place steadily and continually; the main  fact with which we have to do is the gradual transport, by the Po and  its great collateral rivers, of vast masses of the finer sediment to the  sea. The character of the Lombardic plains is most strikingly expressed  by the ancient walls of its cities, composed for the most part of large  rounded Alpine pebbles alternating with narrow courses of brick; and was  curiously illustrated in 1848, by the ramparts of these same pebbles  thrown up four or five feet high round every field, to check the  Austrian cavalry in the battle under the walls of Verona. The finer dust  among which these pebbles are dispersed is taken up by the rivers, fed  into continual strength by the Alpine snow, so that, however pure their  waters may be when they issue from the lakes at the foot of the great  chain, they become of the color and opacity of clay before they reach  the Adriatic; the sediment which they bear is at once thrown down as  they enter the sea, forming a vast belt of low land along the eastern  coast of Italy. The powerful stream of the Po of course builds forward  the fastest; on each side of it, north and south, there is a tract of  marsh, fed by more feeble streams, and less liable to rapid change than  the delta of the central river. In one of these tracts is built RAVENNA,  and in the other VENICE.    Sec. V. What circumstances directed the peculiar arrangement of this  great belt of sediment in the earliest times, it is not here the place to  inquire. It is enough for us to know that from the mouths of the Adige  to those of the Piave there stretches, at a variable distance of from  three to five miles from the actual shore, a bank of sand, divided into  long islands by narrow channels of sea. The space between this bank and  the true shore consists of the sedimentary deposits from these and other  rivers, a great plain of calcareous mud, covered, in the neighborhood of  Venice, by the sea at high water, to the depth in most places of a foot  or a foot and a half, and nearly everywhere exposed at low tide, but  divided by an intricate network of narrow and winding channels, from  which the sea never retires. In some places, according to the run of the  currents, the land has risen into marshy islets, consolidated, some by  art, and some by time, into ground firm enough to be built upon, or  fruitful enough to be cultivated: in others, on the contrary, it has not  reached the sea-level; so that, at the average low water, shallow  lakelets glitter among its irregularly exposed fields of seaweed. In the  midst of the largest of these, increased in importance by the confluence  of several large river channels towards one of the openings in the sea  bank, the city of Venice itself is built, on a crowded cluster of  islands; the various plots of higher ground which appear to the north  and south of this central cluster, have at different periods been also  thickly inhabited, and now bear, according to their size, the remains of  cities, villages, or isolated convents and churches, scattered among  spaces of open ground, partly waste and encumbered by ruins, partly  under cultivation for the supply of the metropolis.    Sec. VI. The average rise and fall of the tide is about three feet  (varying considerably with the seasons[3]); but this fall, on so flat a  shore, is enough to cause continual movement in the waters, and in the  main canals to produce a reflux which frequently runs"]]]
