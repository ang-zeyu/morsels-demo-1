Peace reigned, then Neverwork commenced.    \"Boys, you've been fooled.  Why should you fight for Hengland----\"    \"Britain, please--I'm a Scot,\" interjected Sandy.    \"Well, what has Britain done for Australia?  We don't want Hengland to  hinterfere with our business and get hour boys killed.  We've enough  work 'ere to do.  This is the working man's paradise.  And we can make  it a sight bigger paradise.  We want more men like me.\"    \"'Ave a banana,\" chirped Bill.    \"Yes, mates; we want Socialism.  We're going to get a Republic.  We'll  cut the painter.  Curse England!\"    \"Britain, auld cock!\" interjected Sandy again.    \"Curse Britain--and you, ye porridge-faced hemigrant!  It's the  hemigrants that spoil this country.  Kick them out, I say.  Australia  for Australians.  That's my motto, mates.  I know what I'm talking  about.  I'm Bill Neverwork----\"    \"B.F. for Wearyville,\" interjected Bill as he got up.  \"And now, you  puddin'-headed red flagger, if you'll sit down, I'll have a cut in.\"  The bucolic M.P. collapsed in his seat, wiping the perspiration off his  beetled brow with the aid of a navvy's red handkerchief.    \"Now, boys, you know me.\"    \"Good old Bill--give it him!\"    \"This gent, what is called M.P., is a worm.  I'm a Union man--we're all  Union men.  Andy Fisher's a Union man, and so is Pearce, the chap  that's defending Australia.  But there's Union men and Union men.  They're mainly good, but some are bad.  That's one of the bad ones  there.  His name is Neverwork, and he never worked in his life.  He's a  blowhard, a gasbagger, a balloon full of curses and twaddle.  This  bloke thinks we're fools.  He's kidded his Union on that he's a smart  fellow--a sort of High Priest of Salvation.  He's talked himself into a  job, and he's drawing about five hundred a year out of another fellow's  pockets.  He's called a Socialist to-day, but he'd call himself a Jew,  a nigger, a polecat to-morrow, if, by doing that, he'd get a hundred  more.  In short, mates, he's a politician--you know what that means.  Now, Andy Fisher and Pearce don't shout like this thing here.  They're  men, they're Australians.  They want us to fight side by side with the  boys from the old country.  That's why we're here.  And we'll fight,  and so much for a fat-headed M.P. that couldn't write his own name ten  years ago.  This chap's an insult to Australia.\"    \"Hear, hear!\" chorused all the Bushmen volunteers.    \"Listen, boys!  Listen!\" roared the M.P. above the din; but they simply  howled him down.  In the middle of this row Claud rose up, and putting  up his hand, asked for order.  Again silence reigned.    \"Well, gentlemen--I mean, boys,\" said Claud, fumbling with his  eyeglass, \"I wish to make a motion----\"    \"You're a new chum--sit down,\" roared Neverwork.    \"And that's why I want to speak,\" said Claud, in such a quiet, cynical  way that the M.P. almost choked.  \"I'm a new chum--yes.  And I am,  also, one of the boys.  I'm in the Shearers' Union, too.  I have been  treated well here--don't cher know, and here are my good friends.  And  we're all going to fight, for what----\"    \"For financiers and Jews,\" roared the M.P.    \"No, my apoplectic friend!  We're going to fight for Australia--not  Britain--and we're going to fight to prevent fools like you handing  this land over to German or Yellow men.  It's the proper thing, don't  cher know.  Now, gentlemen----\"    \"Not so much of the gentlemen,\" shouted Neverwork.    \"My dear friend, you were not included in the term.  I am addressing  these gentlemen from the Bush.  You're too beastly dirty and lazy to be  a Bushman,\" said Claud, adjusting his eyeglass and surveying the squat  figure of the M.P. as if he were examining a maggot.    \"My motion, boys, is simply this, that we stop the train by pulling the  communication cord, and hold the driver up for ten minutes.  Meantime,  we might seize our political gasbag, secure him with a few bits of  rope, hoist him out of the carriage, and tie him up to one of the  signal posts, leaving a suitable inscription attached to his  corporation, so that all the world shall know what a delightful idiot  this gentleman--I mean politician--is.\"    \"Carried, be jabers!\" roared Paddy Doolan, pulling the communication  cord, while Bill, Sandy and some more, seized the Socialist.  He  kicked, cursed, bit, screamed and wriggled, but to no purpose.  As the  train slowed down, Bill jumped out, and, running along to the driver,  held him up with a masonic wink and a Scotch refreshment.  The trussed  form of the M.P. was then carried out of the train.  He was still  cursing.  But the Bushmen quietly tied him to a signal post.  This  completed, Claud pinned a great white sheet of paper with an  inscription on it.    \"Good-bye, old cock,\" shouted the Bushmen, jumping into the train  again.  The whistle blew, and as the train went slowly past the enraged  captive, the eyes of all read the notice fixed to his waist:      \"THIS IS NOT AN AUSTRALIAN,      HE'S A D---- FOOL.        (_Signed_) KANGAROO MARINES.\"          CHAPTER II    MELBOURNE VERSUS SYDNEY    Sam Killem, Commanding Officer of the Kangaroo Marines, sat in his  Recruiting Office chewing a cigar in the usual Australian style.  Now  and again he looked at his recruiting figures and smiled.  \"Five  hundred men in three days,\" he mused.  \"Not bad for you, Sam; and good  stuff at that\"--for Sam was a judge of men.  He was a squatter and as  rich as Croesus.  His big, bony frame spoke of strength, while his eye  and face told the tale of shrewdness and resource.  He was forty, and  successful.  Three hundred miles of land was chartered as his own.  His  sheep were counted in thousands, and his brand as familiar as a postage  stamp.  Yet, in all his struggles for success, Sam had found time to be  a patriot.  He had served as a Tommy in the African War, and since then  had commanded a corps of mounted men in the back of beyond.  He was the  fairest yet fiercest, the most faithful and fearless man in the force.  A man who disobeyed his orders always received a knock-out blow, for  Sam boxed like a pro. and hit like a hammer.    \"Some more recruits, sir,\" said his sergeant-major, opening the door.    \"Right, Jones; show them in.\"    The door closed on the now famous quartette--Claud, Bill, Paddy, and  Sandy.  They were still in their rough bush-whacking clothes, while  their eyes told the tale of a merry night before.    \"Well, boys--glad to see you.\"    \"We've met before, Sam,\" said Bill.    \"Guess we have, but cut out the 'Sam,' click your heels together, say  'sir,' when you answer, and salute when you meet me.  I'm bossing this  show.  And we can't have sheep-shearing familiarities--understand!\"    \"Bit sudden like!\" smiled Bill, trying to comply.    \"Not so sudden as death, or a shrapnel.  Now, to business.  You fellows  look fit.  What's your names?\"    \"Bill Buster's mine.\"    \"Age?\"    \"About thirty--that's near enough.\"    \"Religion?\"    \"Ain't got any.\"    \"That means you're officially C. of E.\"    \"What's that, Sam--eh--sir?\"    \"Church of England--they father queer birds like you.\"    \"Now, your father and mother?\"    \"None.\"    \"How's that?\"    \"I was found as a kid on the Woolamaloo Road, with a newspaper for a  bellyband and a rubber tit in my mouth.  The old woman who found me  said I dropped from heaven.\"    \"The other's the most likely place.  Now, sign.    \"Right!  Next.\"    Paddy Doolan described himself as an Irishman, born in Kerry, and an  egg-merchant by trade.    \"Your religion?\" asked Sam.    \"Sure, I'm a Catholic.\"    \"When were you at Confession last?\"    \"It's a long time now, yer riverance; but if yis'll lend me a pound  I'll have something worth confessing by early Mass to-morrow.\"    \"_Your_ name, now?\"    \"Sandy Brown.\"    \"Where from?\"    \"Glesca, sir.\"    \"Where's Glesca?\"    \"The place whaur they mak' gunboats an' bailies.\"    \"Trade?\"    \"Coal merchant--I mean stoker.\"    \"Married?\"    \"Often.\"    A few more questions settled Sandy.  Then Claud came forward, adjusting  his eyeglass.    \"Better take that window out of your face, young fellow.  What's your  name?\"    \"Claud Dufair.\"    \"Father?\"    \"Lord Dufair.\"    \"You're the goods, young fellow.  Now, do you think you can stand up to  me for five rounds?\"    \"Boxing's a beastly bore, sir; but I would have a go--certainly.\"    \"Right!  I'll make you corporal.  We've need of your brains.  By the  way, why did you leave home--women and wine, eh?\"    \"Well--yes, sir.\"    \"Human failing--we're all like that,\" soliloquised Sam, who had been  one of the lads in his day.  \"Now, boys, about turn, and off for your  uniform--good day.\"    \"Good day, sir,\" replied the four, attempting to salute.    \"Good lads--good lads!\" muttered Sam to himself as they stumbled  through the door.    Three days afterwards Sam had his thousand men.  He quartered them in  tents, selected some old soldiers for instructors, and commenced to  train for war.  Sergeant-Major Jones, an ex-Imperial Army man, was the  terror of the show.  This warrant officer realised what he was up  against--a thousand rebels against convention, hypocrisies, and shams.  They called a spade a spade.  \"Red tape\" they cursed, and stupid  officialdom they loathed.  They were freemen, Bohemians of the plains.  In the Bush they had learned to fight, cook, scheme, and generally look  after themselves.  Pioneers of the toughest kind.  The type that has  made our Empire what it is to-day.  In drink they were like savages,  ready to shoot the men they hated, ready to give a drunken embrace to  the men they liked and respected.    And few of them were fools.  Many could rip off Shakespeare by the  yard; others could recite, in a feeling way, the best of Byron,  Tennyson, Kipling, and Burns.  The lonely plains and self-communion had  given each a soul.

Didn't he, Thompson?\"    \"They'll be some ventilatin' under th' table if yu fellows don't lemme  alone; I'm hungry,\" complained Skinny.    \"Say, Hopalong, I bets yu I kin clean up C 80 all by my lonesome,\"  announced Buck, winking at Red.    \"Yah! Yu onct tried to clean up the Bend, Buckie, an' if Pete an' Billy  hadn't afound yu when they come by Eagle Pass that night yu wouldn't be  here eatin' beef by th' pound,\" glancing at the hard-working Hopalong.  \"It was plum lucky fer yu that they was acourtin' that time, wasn't it,  Hopalong?\" suddenly asked Red. Hopalong nearly strangled in his efforts  to speak. He gave it up and nodded his head.    \"Why can't yu git it straight, Connors? I wasn't doin' no courtin', it  was Pete. I runned into him on th' other side o' th' pass. I'd look fine  acourtin', wouldn't I?\" asked the downtrodden Williams.    Pete Wilson skillfully flipped a potato into that worthy's coffee,  spilling the beverage of the questionable name over a large expanse of  blue flannel shirt. \"Yu's all right, yu are. Why, when I meets yu, yu  was lost in th' arms of yore ladylove. All I could see was yore feet.

When I proposed drownin' yore  troubles over at Cowan's, yu went an' got mad over what yu called th'  insinooation. An' yu shore didn't look any too blamed fine, neither.\"    \"All th' same,\" volunteered Thompson, who had taken the edge from his  appetite, \"we better go over an' pay C 80 a call. I don't like what  Shorty said about saltin' our cattle. He'll shore do it, unless I camps  on th' line, which same I hain't hankerin' after.\"    \"Oh, he wouldn't stop th' cows that way, Skinny; he was only afoolin',\"  exclaimed Connors meekly.    \"Foolin' yore gran'mother! That there bunch'll do anything if we wasn't  lookin',\" hotly replied Skinny.    \"That's shore nuff gospel, Thomp. They's sore fer mor'n one thing. They  got aplenty when Buck went on th' warpath, an they's hankerin' to git  square,\" remarked Johnny Nelson, stealing the pie, a rare treat, of his  neighbor when that unfortunate individual was not looking. He had  it halfway to his mouth when its former owner, Jimmy Price, a boy of  eighteen, turned his head and saw it going.    \"Hi-yi! Yu clay-bank coyote, drap thet pie! Did yu ever see such a  son-of-a-gun fer pie?\" he plaintively asked Red Connors, as he grabbed  a mighty handful of apples and crust. \"Pie'll kill yu some day, yu  bob-tailed jack! I had an uncle that died onct. He et too much pie an'  he went an' turned green, an so'll yu if yu don't let it alone.\"    \"Yu ought'r seed th' pie Johnny had down in Eagle Flat,\" murmured Lanky  Smith reminiscently. \"She had feet that'd stop a stampede. Johnny  was shore loco about her. Swore she was the finest blossom that  ever growed.\" Here he choked and tears of laughter coursed down his  weather-beaten face as he pictured her. \"She was a dainty Mexican, about  fifteen han's high an' about sixteen han's around. Johnny used to chalk  off when he hugged her, usen't yu, Johnny? One night when he had got  purty well around on th' second lap he run inter a feller jest startin'  out on his fust. They hain't caught that Mexican yet.\"    Nelson was pelted with everything in sight. He slowly wiped off the  pie crust and bread and potatoes. \"Anybody'd think I was a busted grub  wagon,\" he grumbled. When he had fished the last piece of beef out of  his ear he went out and offered to stand treat. As the round-up was  over, they slid into their saddles and raced for Cowan's saloon at  Buckskin.        CHAPTER II. The Rashness of Shorty    Buckskin was very hot; in fact it was never anything else. Few people  were on the streets and the town was quiet. Over in the Houston hotel  a crowd of cowboys was lounging in the barroom. They were very quiet--a  condition as rare as it was ominous. Their mounts, twelve in all, were  switching flies from their quivering skins in the corral at the rear.  Eight of these had a large C 80 branded on their flanks; the other four,  a Double Arrow.    In the barroom a slim, wiry man was looking out of the dirty window  up the street at Cowan's saloon. Shorty was complaining, \"They shore  oughter be here now. They rounded up last week.\" The man nearest assured  him that they would come. The man at the window turned and said, \"They's  yer now.\"      In front of Cowan's a crowd of nine happy-go-lucky, daredevil riders  were sliding from their saddles. They threw their reins over the heads  of their mounts and filed in to the bar. Laughter issued from the open  door and the clink of glasses could be heard. They stood in picturesque  groups, strong, self-reliant, humorous, virile. Their expensive  sombreros were pushed far back on their heads and their hairy chaps were  covered with the alkali dust from their ride.    Cowan, bottle in hand, pushed out several more glasses. He kicked a dog  from under his feet and looked at Buck. \"Rounded up yet?\" he inquired.    \"Shore, day afore yisterday,\" came the reply. The rest were busy  removing the dust from their throats, and gradually drifted into groups  of two or three. One of these groups strolled over to the solitary card  table, and found Jimmy Price resting in a cheap chair, his legs on the  table.    \"I wisht yu'd extricate yore delicate feet from off'n this hyar table,  James,\" humbly requested Lanky Smith, morally backed up by those with  him.    \"Ya-as, they shore is delicate, Mr. Smith,\" responded Jimmy without  moving.    \"We wants to play draw, Jimmy,\" explained Pete.    \"Yore shore welcome to play if yu wants to. Didn't I tell yu when yu  growed that mustache that yu didn't have to ask me any more?\" queried  the placid James, paternally.    \"Call 'em off, sonny. Pete sez he kin clean me out. Anyhow, yu kin have  the fust deal,\" compromised Lanky.    \"I'm shore sorry fer Pete if he cayn't. Yu don't reckon I has to have  fust deal to beat yu fellers, do yu? Go way an' lemme alone; I never  seed such a bunch fer buttin' in as yu fellers.\"    Billy Williams returned to the bar. Then he walked along it until he  was behind the recalcitrant possessor of the table. While his aggrieved  friends shuffled their feet uneasily to cover his approach, he tiptoed  up behind Jimmy and, with a nod, grasped that indignant individual  firmly by the neck while the others grabbed his feet. They carried him,  twisting and bucking, to the middle of the street and deposited him in  the dust, returning to the now vacant table.    Jimmy rested quietly for a few seconds and then slowly arose, dusting  the alkali from him.    \"Th' wall-eyed piruts,\" he muttered, and then scratched his head for  a way to \"play hunk.\" As he gazed sorrowfully at the saloon he heard a  snicker from behind him. He, thinking it was one of his late tormentors,  paid no attention to it. Then a cynical, biting laugh stung him. He  wheeled, to see Shorty leaning against a tree, a sneering leer on his  flushed face. Shorty's right hand was suspended above his holster,  hooked to his belt by the thumb--a favorite position of his when  expecting trouble.    \"One of yore reg'lar habits?\" he drawled.    Jimmy began to dust himself in silence, but his lips were compressed to  a thin white line.    \"Does they hurt yu?\" pursued the onlooker.    Jimmy looked up. \"I heard tell that they make glue outen cayuses,  sometimes,\" he remarked.    Shorty's eyes flashed. The loss of the horse had been rankling in his  heart all day.    \"Does they git yu frequent?\" he asked. His voice sounded hard.    \"Oh, 'bout as frequent as yu lose a cayuse, I reckon,\" replied Jimmy  hotly.    Shorty's hand streaked to his holster and Jimmy followed his lead.  Jimmy's Colt was caught. He had bucked too much. As he fell Shorty ran  for the Houston House.    Pistol shots were common, for they were the universal method of  expressing emotions. The poker players grinned, thinking their victim  was letting off his indignation. Lanky sized up his hand and remarked  half audibly, \"He's a shore good kid.\"    The bartender, fearing for his new beveled, gilt-framed mirror, gave a  hasty glance out the window. He turned around, made change and remarked  to Buck, \"Yore kid, Jimmy, is plugged.\" Several of the more credulous  craned their necks to see, Buck being the first. \"Judas!\" he shouted,  and ran out to where Jimmy lay coughing, his toes twitching. The saloon  was deserted and a crowd of angry cowboys surrounded their chum-aboy.  Buck had seen Shorty enter the door of the Houston House and he swore.  \"Chase them C 80 and Arrow cayuses behind the saloon, Pete, an' git  under cover.\"    Jimmy was choking and he coughed up blood. \"He's shore--got me. My--gun  stuck,\" he added apologetically. He tried to sit up, but was not able  and he looked surprised. \"It's purty-damn hot-out here,\" he suggested.  Johnny and Billy carried him in the saloon and placed him by the table,  in the chair he had previously vacated. As they stood up he fell across  the table and died.    Billy placed the dead boy's sombrero on his head and laid the refractory  six-shooter on the table. \"I wonder who th' dirty killer was.\" He looked  at the slim figure and started to go out, followed by Johnny. As he  reached the threshold a bullet zipped past him and thudded into the  frame of the door. He backed away and looked surprised. \"That's Shorty's  shootin'--he allus misses 'bout that much.\" He looked out and saw Buck  standing behind the live oak that Shorty had leaned against, firing at  the hotel. Turning around he made for the rear, remarking to Johnny that  \"they's in th' Houston.\" Johnny looked at the quiet figure in the chair  and swore softly. He followed Billy. Cowan, closing the door and taking  a buffalo gun from under the bar, went out also "]]]
