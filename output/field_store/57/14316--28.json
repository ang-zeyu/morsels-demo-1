Then from the midst of the flames arose the  white-bearded old man and spoke thus sternly to the rich man:    \"Woe unto the wilful! Thy brother is virtuous, therefore have I  blessed him. As for thee, thou art wicked, and so shalt not escape our  vengeance.\"    At these words the twelve arose. The first seized the unfortunate man,  struck him, and passed him on to the second; the second also struck  him and passed him on to the third; and so did they all in their turn,  until he was given up to the old man, who disappeared with him into  the fire.    Days, weeks, months went by, but the rich man never returned, and none  knew what had become of him. I think, between you and me, the younger  brother had his suspicions but he very wisely kept them to himself.            [Illustration]    II    TIME AND THE KINGS OF THE ELEMENTS      There was once a married pair who loved each other tenderly. The  husband would not have given up his wife for all the riches in the  world, while her first thought was how best to please him. So they  were very happy, and lived like two grains in one ear of corn.    One day while working in the fields, a great longing came over him to  see her: so without waiting for the hour of sunset he ran home. Alas!  she was not there. He looked high and low, he ran here, there, and  everywhere, he wept, he called to her; in vain! his dear wife was not  to be found.    So heartbroken was he that he no longer cared to live. He could think  of nothing but the loss of his dear wife and how to find her again. At  last he determined to travel all over the world in search of her. So  he began to walk straight on, trusting God to direct his steps. Sad  and thoughtful, he wandered for many days, until he reached a cottage  close by the shores of a large lake. Here he stopped, hoping to find  out news. On entering the cottage he was met by a woman, who tried to  prevent him entering.    \"What do you want here, unlucky wretch?\" said she. \"If my husband sees  you, he will kill you instantly.\"    \"Who is your husband then?\" asked the traveller.    \"What! you do not know him? My husband is the Water-King; everything  under water obeys him. Depart quickly, for if he finds you here he  will certainly devour you.\"    \"Perhaps after all he would take pity on me. But hide me somewhere,  for I am worn and weary, and without shelter for the night.\"    So the Water-Queen was persuaded, and hid him behind the stove. Almost  immediately after the Water-King entered. He had barely crossed the  threshold when he called out, \"Wife, I smell human flesh; give it me  quickly, for I am hungry.\" She dared not disobey him, and so she had  to tell him of the traveller's hiding-place. The poor man became  terribly frightened, and trembled in every limb, and began to stammer  out excuses.    \"I assure you I have done no harm. I came here in search of news of my  poor wife. Oh, do help me to find her; I cannot live without her.\"    \"Well,\" replied the Water-King, \"as you love your wife so tenderly I  will forgive you for coming here, but I cannot help you to find her,  for I do not know where she is. Yet I remember seeing two ducks on the  lake yesterday, perchance she is one of them. But I should advise you  to ask my brother the Fire-King; he may be able to tell you more.\"    Happy to have escaped so easily, he thanked the Water-King and set out  to find the Fire-King. But the latter was unable to help him, and  could only advise him to consult his other brother, the Air-King. But  the Air-King, though he had travelled all over the earth, could only  say he thought he had seen a woman at the foot of the Crystal  Mountain.    But the traveller was cheered at the news, and went to seek his wife  at the foot of the Crystal Mountain, which was close to their cottage.  On reaching it he began at once to climb the mountain by making his  way up the bed of the torrent that came rushing down there. Several  ducks that were in the pools near the waterfall called out, \"My good  man, don't go up there; you'll be killed.\"    But he walked fearlessly on till he came to some thatched cottages, at  the largest of which he stopped. Here a crowd of wizards and witches  surrounded him, screaming at the top of their voices, \"What are you  looking for?\"    \"My wife,\" said he.    \"She is here,\" they cried, \"but you cannot take her away unless you  recognise her among two hundred women all exactly like her.\"    [Illustration]    \"What! Not know my own wife? Why, here she is,\" said he, as he clasped  her in his arms. And she, delighted to be with him again, kissed him  fondly. Then she whispered:    \"Dearest, though you knew me to-day I doubt whether you will  to-morrow, for there will be so many of us all alike. Now I will tell  you what to do. At nightfall go to the top of the Crystal Mountain,  where live the King of Time and his court. Ask him how you may know  me. If you are good and honest he will help you; if not, he will  devour you whole at one mouthful.\"    \"I will do what you advise, dear one,\" he replied, \"but tell me, why  did you leave me so suddenly? If you only knew what I have suffered! I  have sought you all over the world.\"    \"I did not leave you willingly,\" said she. \"A countryman asked me to  come and look at the mountain torrent. When we got there he sprinkled  some water over himself, and at once I saw wings growing out of his  shoulders, and he soon changed his shape entirely into that of a  drake; and I too became a duck at the same time, and whether I would  or no I was obliged to follow him. Here I was allowed to resume my own  form; and now there is but the one difficulty of being recognised by  you.\"    So they parted, she to join the other women, he to continue his way to  the Crystal Mountain. At the top he found twelve strange beings  sitting round a large fire: they were the attendants of the King of  Time. He saluted them respectfully.    \"What dost thou want?\" said they.    \"I have lost my dear wife. Can you tell me how to recognise her among  two hundred other women all exactly alike?\"    \"No,\" said they, \"but perhaps our King can.\"    Then arose from the midst of the flames an old man with bald head and  long white beard, who, on hearing his request, replied: \"Though all  these women be exactly alike, thy wife will have a black thread in the  shoe of her right foot.\"    So saying he vanished, and the traveller, thanking the twelve,  descended the mountain.    Sure it is that without the black thread he would never have  recognised her. And though the Magician tried to hide her, the spell  was broken; and the two returned rejoicing to their home, where they  lived happily ever after.            [Illustration]    III    THE TWELVE MONTHS      There was once a widow who had two daughters, Helen, her own child by  her dead husband, and Marouckla, his daughter by his first wife. She  loved Helen, but hated the poor orphan, because she was far prettier  than her own daughter. Marouckla did not think about her good looks,  and could not understand why her stepmother should be angry at the  sight of her. The hardest work fell to her share; she cleaned out the  rooms, cooked, washed, sewed, spun, wove, brought in the hay, milked  the cow, and all this without any help. Helen, meanwhile, did nothing  but dress herself in her best clothes and go to one amusement after  another. But Marouckla never complained; she bore the scoldings and  bad temper of mother and sister with a smile on her lips, and the  patience of a lamb. But this angelic behaviour did not soften them.  They became even more tyrannical and grumpy, for Marouckla grew daily  more beautiful, while Helen's ugliness increased. So the stepmother  determined to get rid of Marouckla, for she knew that while she  remained her own daughter would have no suitors. Hunger, every kind of  privation, abuse, every means was used to make the girl's life  miserable. The most wicked of men could not have been more mercilessly  cruel than these two vixens. But in spite of it all Marouckla grew  ever sweeter and more charming.    One day in the middle of winter Helen wanted some wood-violets.    \"Listen,\" cried she to Marouckla; \"you must go up the mountain and  find me some violets, I want some to put in my gown; they must be  fresh and sweet-scented--do you hear?\"    \"But, my dear sister, who ever heard of violets blooming in the snow?\"  said the poor orphan.    \"You wretched creature! Do you dare to disobey me?\" said Helen. \"Not  another word; off with you. If you do not bring me some violets from  the mountain forest, I will kill you.\"    The stepmother also added her threats to those of Helen, and with  vigorous blows they pushed Marouckla outside and shut the door upon  her. The weeping girl made her way to the mountain. The snow lay deep,  and there was no trace of any human being. Long she wandered hither  and thither, and lost herself in the wood. She was hungry, and  shivered with cold, and prayed to die. Suddenly she saw a light in the  distance, and climbed towards it, till she reached the top of the  mountain. Upon the highest peak burnt a large fire, surrounded by  twelve blocks of stone, on which sat twelve strange beings. Of these  the first three had white hair, three were not quite so old, three  were young and handsome, and the rest still younger.    There they all sate silently looking at the fire. They were the twelve  months of the year. The great Setchene (January) was placed higher  than the others; his hair and moustache were white as snow, and in his  hand he held a wand. At first Marouckla was afraid, but after a while  her courage returned, and drawing near she said:    \"Men of God, may I warm myself at your fire? I am chilled by the  winter cold.\"    The great Setchene raised his head and answered:    \"What brings thee here, my daughter? What dost thou seek?\"    \"I am looking for violets,\" replied the maiden."]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/25568"],[0,"Domesticated Animals (#2)"],[1,"myriad species which has won its way by powers of mind out  of darkness and the great struggle to the place of command. The way in  which this creature, weak in body and exceedingly dependent on his  surroundings, has in the modern geologic epoch come forth from the mass  of the lower animals, is by far the most impressive and as yet the most  unexplained phenomenon which the geologist has to consider. It is not  likely that the marvellous advancement can be accounted for by any  single cause; it is probably due, as are most of the great evolutions,  to the concurrence of many influences; but among these which make for  advance, we clearly have to reckon the animals and plants which man has  learned to associate with his work of the household and the fields.    Although certain species of insects, particularly the ants, have the  well-developed habit of subjugating certain creatures of their own  family, man is the only vertebrate that has ever adopted the plan of  domesticating a variety of animals and plants. The beginnings of this  custom were made in a very remote time, and for long ages the profit  which was thereby gained appears to have been but slight. Gradually,  however, races, owing to their masterful quality and to the  opportunities which were offered by the wild life about their dwelling  places, obtained flocks and herds. In the group of continents commonly  termed the old world, where there were several ancient primitive peoples  of innate ability, and where there were many species of larger mammals  which were well fitted for domestication, the advance in social  development went on rapidly. In the new world, though the primitive  races contained tribes of much ability, there was practically no chance  for the people to add to their strength by the subjugation of beasts of  burden, or to their food resources by the adoption of various animals  which could be used for the needs of food or raiment. The advance of men  when they have obtained valuable domesticated animals, and their failure  to win a high station where the surrounding nature denied such  opportunities, go far to prove the bearing of this accomplishment in the  development of peoples.    A little consideration makes it evident to us that the advance of  mankind above the original savage state is in several ways favored by  the possession of domesticated animals. In the first place, each  creature which is adopted into the household or the fields usually  brings as its tribute a substantial contribution to the resources which  tend to make the society commercially successful. When we consider the  enlargements of resources and the diversification of industries which  rest upon the adoption of any one of these animals--as, for instance,  the horse--we see in a way what the possession of domesticated animals  and plants really means, and are in a position to conceive, though at  best but dimly, what the scores of these captive species have done for  us. We recognize the fact that while, under almost any conditions, a  certain manner of advance above the most primitive savagery is possible  to a naturally able people, this on-going cannot lead any distance  unless the folk have other help than their own weak bodies can give  them. It is hardly too much to say that civilization has intimately  depended on the subjugation of a great range of useful species.    It would be interesting to trace, if we could, what share the several  domesticated animals have had in the development of the human races; but  this task is not to be done. We can, however, discern that the Arab  without the camel and the horse would not have found the place in  history which he has filled, and that our own race could not have  attained its place save for the aid which the horned cattle, sheep, and  a host of other helpers which we have pressed into service, have  afforded. These economic gains have to be judged in mass, they cannot be  reckoned in detail. When we have made the best account of them we can,  there remains another class of influences, the value of which, though  evidently great, is yet harder to reckon; these arise from the education  which has been attained through the care of these adopted creatures.  Among savages the great need is a training in forethoughtfulness; all  primitive peoples are like children, they live in the interests of the  day; the cares of the seasons to come, or even of the morrow, are not  for them. The possession of domesticated animals certainly did much to  break up this old brutal way of life; it led to a higher sense of  responsibility to the care of the household; it brought about systematic  agriculture; it developed the art of war; it laid the foundations of  wealth and commerce, and so set men well upon their upward way.  Moreover, the use of domesticated animals of the better sort enabled the  more vigorous and care-taking races to gain the strength which led to  their advancement in power to a point where they were able to displace  the lower and feebler tribes. In other words, the system of  domestication has provided a method by which those peoples who were  fitted to develop the qualities which make for civilization could  advance; it has provided the opportunity for selection.    Of all the influences which have been exercised on man by the care of  his flocks, herds, and droves, perhaps the most important is that which  has arisen from the broader development of his sympathies. The savage  may be defined as a man who cares only for his family and his tribe; the  civilized man as one whose kindly interest extends to mankind and beyond  to all sentient beings. In the development of this altruistic motive the  care of the dependent species has evidently been most effective. We note  that the peoples who have attained the first upward step in the  association with domesticated animals are in their quality, so far as  tested by literature and history, much above the mere savage. With the  care of the flocks we find associated poetry, the first notes of higher  religious motives, and a largeness of the sympathetic life which is  favored by the nature of the occupation. Where the nomadic habits of the  original shepherds pass into the more sedentary state of the soil  tiller, the element of personal care and the affection and the  consequent education of the sympathy were increased. Men had now to care  for half a dozen or more kinds of animals; they had to learn their ways,  in a manner to put themselves in their places and conceive their needs.  Thus the life of a farmer is a continual lesson in the art of sympathy;  with the result, certainly in part due to this cause, that there is no  class of people from whom the brutal instincts of the ancient savage  life which we all inherit have been so completely eradicated.    It is perhaps too much to attribute the advance of the agricultural  classes of our civilized peoples, in all that serves to remove them from  the brutality of their savage ancestors, altogether to the nature of  their work--to the very large element of kindly care for which it calls,  and which is the price of success in the occupation. Yet when we note  the immediate way in which the people bred in cities, under  circumstances of excitement are wont to behave like savages of the lower  kind, showing in their conduct a lack of all sympathetic education, and  contrast their behavior with that of their kinsmen from the fields--we  see essential differences in character which cannot well be explained  save by the diverse natures of the training which the men have received.  Thus in the French Revolution, the baser, more inhuman deeds were not  committed by the peasants, who had been the principal sufferers under  the regime which was overthrown, but by the people of the great towns  who had been less oppressed by the iniquities of the old system of  government.    If it be true--as my personal experiences and observations lead me  firmly to believe is the case--that man's contact with the domesticated  animals has been and is ever to be one of the most effective means  whereby his sympathetic, his civilized motives may be broadened and  affirmed, there is clearly reason for giving to this side of life a  larger share of attention than it has received. So far the presence of  these lower creatures in our society has generally been accepted as a  matter of course. Sentimentalists, after the fashion of Laurence Sterne,  have dwelt upon the imaginary woes of the creatures. Associations of  well-meaning people have endeavored to diminish the cruelty which people  of the towns, rarely those bred on the soil, often inflict upon them. It  seems, however, desirable that we should place this consideration upon a  plane more fitting the knowledge of our time. It should be made plain,  not only that the success of our civilization depends now as in the past  on the cooperation which mankind has had from the domesticated animals,  but also that the development of this relation is one of the most  interesting features in all history. On through the ages of the geologic  past comes this great procession of life, in the endless succession of  species whose numbers in the aggregate are to be reckoned by the scores,  if not by the hundreds of millions. Until this modern age, the throng  goes forward blindly, groping its way towards the higher planes of life.  At length certain of the more advanced forms attain to a measure of  intellectual elevation. Still, for all this advance, the life is not  organized so as to attain any large ends; no society arises from it.    Suddenly, in the last geological epoch, man, the descendant of a group  which like all others had led the narrow life of the preparatory ages,  appears upon the scene. At first, and in his lower human estate, his  position was not noticeably higher than that of his kindred, but there  was in him the seed of a great unlikeness, of very new things, in"]]]
