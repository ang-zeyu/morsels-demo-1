She alighted upon a limb a few feet above the former site of  her nest, looked down upon us, uttered a note or two, and then dropped  down confidently to the point in the vacant air where the entrance to  her nest had been but a few moments before. Here she hovered on the wing  a second or two, looking for something that was not there, and then  returned to the perch she had just left, apparently not a little  disturbed. She hammered the beetle rather excitedly upon the limb a few  times, as if it were in some way at fault, then dropped down to try for  her nest again. Only vacant air there! She hovers and hovers, her blue  wings flickering in the checkered light; surely that precious hole  _must_ be there; but no, again she is baffled, and again she returns to  her perch, and mauls the poor beetle till it must be reduced to a pulp.  Then she makes a third attempt, then a fourth, and a fifth, and a  sixth, till she becomes very much excited. \"What could have happened? am  I dreaming? has that beetle hoodooed me?\" she seems to say, and in her  dismay she lets the bug drop, and looks bewilderedly about her. Then she  flies away through the woods, calling. \"Going for her mate,\" I said to  Ted. \"She is in deep trouble, and she wants sympathy and help.\"    In a few minutes we heard her mate answer, and presently the two birds  came hurrying to the spot, both with loaded beaks. They perched upon the  familiar limb above the site of the nest, and the mate seemed to say,  \"My dear, what has happened to you? I can find that nest.\" And he dived  down, and brought up in the empty air just as the mother had done. How  he winnowed it with his eager wings! how he seemed to bear on to that  blank space! His mate sat regarding him intently, confident, I think,  that he would find the clew. But he did not. Baffled and excited, he  returned to the perch beside her. Then she tried again, then he rushed  down once more, then they both assaulted the place, but it would not  give up its secret. They talked, they encouraged each other, and they  kept up the search, now one, now the other, now both together. Sometimes  they dropped down to within a few feet of the entrance to the nest, and  we thought they would surely find it. No, their minds and eyes were  intent only upon that square foot of space where the nest had been. Soon  they withdrew to a large limb many feet higher up, and seemed to say to  themselves, \"Well, it is not there, but it must be here somewhere; let  us look about.\" A few minutes elapsed, when we saw the mother bird  spring from her perch and go straight as an arrow to the nest. Her  maternal eye had proved the quicker. She had found her young. Something  like reason and common sense had come to her rescue; she had taken time  to look about, and behold! there was that precious doorway. She thrust  her head into it, then sent back a call to her mate, then went farther  in, then withdrew. \"Yes, it is true, they are here, they are here!\" Then  she went in again, gave them the food in her beak, and then gave place  to her mate, who, after similar demonstrations of joy, also gave them  his morsel.    Ted and I breathed freer. A burden had been taken from our minds and  hearts, and we went cheerfully on our way. We had learned something,  too; we had learned that when in the deep woods you think of bluebirds,  bluebirds may be nearer you than you think.           *       *       *       *       *    One mid-April morning two pairs of bluebirds were in very active and at  times violent courtship about my grounds. I could not quite understand  the meaning of all the fuss and flutter. Both birds of each pair were  very demonstrative, but the female in each case the more so. She  followed the male everywhere, lifting and twinkling her wings, and  apparently seeking to win him by both word and gesture. If she was not  telling him by that cheery, animated, confiding, softly endearing speech  of hers, which she poured out incessantly, how much she loved him, what  was she saying? She was constantly filled with a desire to perch upon  the precise spot where he was sitting, and if he had not moved away I  think she would have alighted upon his back. Now and then, when she  flitted away from him, he followed her with like gestures and tones and  demonstrations of affection, but never with quite the same ardor. The  two pairs kept near each other, about the house, the bird-boxes, the  trees, the posts and vines in the vineyard, filling the ear with their  soft, insistent warbles, and the eye with their twinkling azure wings.     [Illustration: BLUEBIRD   Upper, male; lower, female]    Was it this constant presence of rivals on both sides that so stimulated  them and kept them up to such a pitch of courtship? Finally, after I had  watched them over an hour, the birds began to come into collision. As  they met in the vineyard, the two males clinched and fell to the  ground, lying there for a moment with wings sprawled out, like birds  brought down by a gun. Then they separated, and each returned to his  mate, warbling and twinkling his wings. Very soon the females clinched  and fell to the ground and fought savagely, rolling over and over each  other, clawing and tweaking and locking beaks and hanging on like bull  terriers. They did this repeatedly; once one of the males dashed in and  separated them, by giving one of the females a sharp tweak and blow.  Then the males were at it again, their blue plumage mixing with the  green grass and ruffled by the ruddy soil. What a soft, feathery,  ineffectual battle it seemed in both cases!--no sound, no blood, no  flying feathers, just a sudden mixing up and general disarray of blue  wings and tails and ruddy breasts, there on the ground; assault but no  visible wounds; thrust of beak and grip of claw, but no feather loosened  and but little ruffling; long holding of one down by the other, but no  cry of pain or fury. It was the kind of battle that one likes to  witness. The birds usually locked beaks, and held their grip half a  minute at a time. One of the females would always alight by the  struggling males and lift her wings and utter her soft notes, but what  she said--whether she was encouraging one of the blue coats or berating  the other, or imploring them both to desist, or egging them on--I could  not tell. So far as I could understand her speech, it was the same that  she had been uttering to her mate all the time.    When my bluebirds dashed at each other with beak and claw, their  preliminary utterances had to my ears anything but a hostile sound.  Indeed, for the bluebird to make a harsh, discordant sound seems out of  the question. Once, when the two males lay upon the ground with  outspread wings and locked beaks, a robin flew down by them and for a  moment gazed intently at the blue splash upon the grass, and then went  his way.    As the birds drifted about the grounds, first the males, then the  females rolling on the grass or in the dust in fierce combat, and  between times the members of each pair assuring each other of undying  interest and attachment, I followed them, apparently quite unnoticed by  them. Sometimes they would lie more than a minute upon the ground, each  trying to keep his own or to break the other's hold. They seemed so  oblivious of everything about them that I wondered if they might not at  such times fall an easy prey to cats and hawks. Let me put their  watchfulness to the test, I said. So, as the two males clinched again  and fell to the ground, I cautiously approached them, hat in hand. When  ten feet away and unregarded, I made a sudden dash and covered them with  my hat. The struggle continued for a few seconds under there, then all  was still. Sudden darkness had fallen upon the field of battle. What did  they think had happened? Presently their heads and wings began to brush  the inside of my hat. Then all was still again. Then I spoke to them,  called to them, exulted over them, but they betrayed no excitement or  alarm. Occasionally a head or a body came in gentle contact with the top  or the sides of my hat.    But the two females were evidently agitated by the sudden disappearance  of their contending lovers, and began uttering their mournful  alarm-note. After a minute or two I lifted one side of my hat and out  darted one of the birds; then I lifted the hat from the other. One of  the females then rushed, apparently with notes of joy and  congratulation, to one of the males, who gave her a spiteful tweak and  blow. Then the other came and he served her the same. He was evidently a  little bewildered, and not certain what had happened or who was  responsible for it. Did he think the two females were in some way to  blame? But he was soon reconciled to one of them again, as was the  other male with the other, yet the two couples did not separate till the  males had come into collision once more. Presently, however, they  drifted apart, and each pair was soon holding an animated conversation  punctuated by those pretty wing gestures, about the two bird-boxes.    These scenes of love and rivalry had lasted nearly all the forenoon, and  matters between the birds apparently remained as they were before--the  members of each pair quite satisfied with each other. One pair occupied  one of the bird-boxes in the vineyard and reared two broods there during  the season, but the other pair drifted away and took up their abode  somewhere else.

The vivid recollection of a back bent down with burdens and lungs at the  limit of their function makes him hesitate to describe this enterprise  as recreation. It was the most laborious undertaking with which he was  ever connected; yet it was done for the pleasure of doing it, and the  pleasure far outweighed the pain. But he is concerned much more with men  than mountains, and would say, since \"out of the fullness of the heart  the mouth speaketh,\" that his especial and growing concern, these ten  years past, is with the native people of Alaska, a gentle and kindly  race, now threatened with a wanton and senseless extermination, and  sadly in need of generous champions if that threat is to be averted.

Denali (Mt. McKinley)        _End of volume_          THE ASCENT OF DENALI          CHAPTER I    PREPARATION AND APPROACH      The enterprise which this volume describes was a cherished purpose  through a number of years. In the exercise of his duties as Archdeacon  of the Yukon, the author has travelled throughout the interior of  Alaska, both winter and summer, almost continuously since 1904. Again  and again, now from one distant elevation and now from another, the  splendid vision of the greatest mountain in North America has spread  before his eyes, and left him each time with a keener longing to enter  its mysterious fastnesses and scale its lofty peaks. Seven years ago,  writing in _The Spirit of Missions_ of a view of the mountain from the  Pedro Dome, in the neighborhood of Fairbanks, he said: \"I would rather  climb that mountain than discover the richest gold-mine in Alaska.\"  Indeed, when first he went to Alaska it was part of the attraction which  the country held for him that it contained an unclimbed mountain of the  first class.    Scawfell and Skiddaw and Helvellyn had given him his first boyish  interest in climbing; the Colorado and Canadian Rockies had claimed one  holiday after another of maturer years, but the summit of Rainier had  been the greatest height he had ever reached. When he went to Alaska he  carried with him all the hypsometrical instruments that were used in the  ascent as well as his personal climbing equipment. There was no definite  likelihood that the opportunity would come to him of attempting the  ascent, but he wished to be prepared with instruments of adequate scale  in case the opportunity should come; and Hicks, of London, made them  nine years ago.    [Illustration: The author and Mr. H. P. Karstens.]    [Sidenote: Members of the Party]    Long ago, also, he had picked out Mr. Harry P. Karstens, of Fairbanks,  as the one colleague with whom he would be willing to make the attempt.  Mr. Karstens had gone to the Klondike in his seventeenth year, during  the wild stampede to those diggings, paying the expenses of the trip by  packing over the Chilkoot Pass, and had been engaged in pioneering and  in travel of an arduous and adventurous kind ever since. He had mined in  the Klondike and in the Seventy-Mile (hence his sobriquet of \"The  Seventy-Mile Kid\"). It was he and his partner, McGonogill, who broke the  first trail from Fairbanks to Valdez and for two years of difficulty and  danger--dogs and men alike starving sometimes--brought the mail  regularly through. When the stampede to the Kantishna took place, and  the government was dilatory about instituting a mail service for the  three thousand men in the camp, Karstens and his partner organized and  maintained a private mail service of their own. He had freighted with  dogs from the Yukon to the Iditarod, had run motor-boats on the Yukon  and the Tanana. For more than a year he had been guide to Mr. Charles  Sheldon, the well-known naturalist and hunter, in the region around the  foot-hills of Denali. With the full vigor of maturity, with all this  accumulated experience and the resourcefulness and self-reliance which  such experience brings, he had yet an almost juvenile keenness for  further adventure which made him admirably suited to this undertaking.    Mr. Robert G. Tatum of Tennessee, just twenty-one years old, a postulant  for holy orders, stationed at the mission at Nenana, had been employed  all the winter in a determined attempt to get supplies freighted over  the ice, by natives and their dog teams, to two women missionaries, a  nurse and a teacher, at the Tanana Crossing. The steamboat had cached  the supplies at a point about one hundred miles below the mission the  previous summer, unable to proceed any farther. The upper Tanana is a  dangerous and difficult river alike for navigation and for ice travel,  and Tatum's efforts were made desperate by the knowledge that the women  were reduced to a diet of straight rabbits without even salt. The famine  relieved, he had returned to Nenana. The summer before he had worked on  a survey party and had thus some knowledge of the use of instruments. By  undertaking the entire cooking for the expedition he was most useful and  helpful, and his consistent courtesy and considerateness made him a very  pleasant comrade.    Of the half-breed boy, Walter Harper, the author's attendant and  interpreter, dog driver in the winter and boat engineer in the summer  for three years previous, no more need be said than that he ran Karstens  close in strength, pluck, and endurance. Of the best that the mixed  blood can produce, twenty-one years old and six feet tall, he took  gleefully to high mountaineering, while his kindliness and invincible  amiability endeared him to every member of the party.    The men were thus all volunteers, experienced in snow and ice, though  not in high-mountain work. But the nature of snow and ice is not  radically changed by lifting them ten or fifteen or even twenty thousand  feet up in the air.    A volunteer expedition was the only one"]]]
