In my perplexity  I spoke from my hammock to one of the elder men in the group before  me:--    \"Grandfather, I wish you would explain to me the meaning of what I saw  yesterday at the He-dhu'-shka Society. Tell me why the Leader put  black on his face.\"    My friend was accustomed to my questionings, and all eyes were turned  toward him as he replied:    \"The Leader put the black cloud over his face, because the black cloud  is worn by Thunder when it comes near to man. The song sung while this  is being done tells that the Leader is making ready and impatiently  awaits the commands of the approaching god of war.\"...    This is the song which accompanied the preparation and the putting on  of the insignia of the thunder god. The music is expressive of the  tremulous movement of the leaves, of the flying of the birds, of the  stir of all nature before the advancing storm, typifying the  stirring of the heart of man when summoned to fight the enemies of his  people.

The words of the song then sung mean:  Wa-ko_n_'-da, we offer this pipe (the symbol of our unity as a  society). Accept it (and us). All the members must join in singing  this prayer, and afterward all must smoke the pipe.\"    [Music: PRAYER OF THE WARRIORS BEFORE SMOKING THE PIPE.    _Omaha. He-dhu'-shka._    Harmonized by PROF.

There is a song with a dance which  must be given at every meeting. It is to keep alive the memory of a  battle that took place while we were migrating westward, and where  defeat would have meant our extermination as a tribe. I will tell you  the story.[2]    [Footnote 2: The translation given is by my collaborator, Mr. Francis  La Flesche.]    \"One morning the tribe, whose country had been invaded by the Ponkas,  made an unexpected assault upon the camp of the invaders. For a time  it seemed as though the Ponkas would fare badly at the hands of their  assailants, who were determined to drive out or destroy the intruders;  but after a desperate struggle the Ponkas pushed their enemies back  from the outskirts of the village, until finally their retreat became  a rout. Both sides suffered great loss. The ground was strewn with the  dead, and the grass stained with the blood of the warriors who fell in  the battle; but the victory was with us, and we had conquered the  right to dwell in that country.    \"At the outset of the conflict a man bent with age emerged slowly from  the door of one of the tents. The breezes played with his long white  hair as he stood leaning on his staff, shading his face with one hand  and looking intently in the direction whence came the noise of battle.  As he recognised the voice of a warrior rushing to the fray, imitating  as he ran the cry of some animal (his tutelary god), the aged man  called after him:    \"'Once more! Once more be the undaunted warrior you have hitherto  been! Utter aloud your mystic cry, and make the enemy to tremble with  fear!'    \"If a youth passed by, singing his death song, the old man would  ask:--    \"'Who is that young man? He promises well.' Upon being told whose son  he was, the aged man shouted: 'Ho-o! You have the spirit of your  father. Be like him: turn not your face from the foe!'    \"All day the old man stood at his door as though rooted to the ground.  As the hours sped on, fainter and fainter grew the shouts and the  cries of the contending men, until finally the sounds died away. Even  then the venerable man moved not from his tent, but still stood  watching. Lower and lower dropped the sun toward the western horizon,  and all through the village anxious faces were turned in the direction  whence the last sound of the fight had been heard. Suddenly a woman  cried,--    \"'There they come!'    \"At her words the old man leaned forward, straining his dim eyes to  discern the distant figures on the far-off hill. In single file, on  the warriors came, one preceding another, according to the grade of  the honours he had won in the battle. The Herald hastened forth from  the village to meet them and to learn their tidings. After a halt he  turned and came on in advance of the men, shouting as he came near  the village the names of those who had fallen in battle. As each name  was called, the wife or mother of the slain man rent the air with  sudden cry and wail, so that the whole village vibrated with the sound  of sorrow as the victorious warriors drew near. In the midst of all  this commotion the aged watcher remained motionless, giving no sign of  emotion as the wailing grew in volume, and stirring not even when he  heard the names of his two sons called in the long death-roll.    \"As the warriors entered the village, the Herald proclaimed the names  of those who had distinguished themselves in that memorable fight.  Slowly the men of valour approached their aged chief, who bowed  acknowledgment as each one spoke and laid at his feet a trophy of war.    \"Among the veterans came a young warrior, who, in this his first  battle, had, in a hand to hand contest, wrenched a club from the grasp  of his antagonist, and had slain the enemy with his own weapon. This  club he presented to the old man, recounting the deed. The chief,  lifting the weapon, exclaimed with a dramatic laugh: 'Ha, ha, ha! It  is thus you should treat your enemies, that they may fear you. My  exhortations to our young men have not fallen on deaf ears. Those who  sought to destroy our people lie scattered and dead on the ground.  Wherever their shadows may wander, even there the fear of you shall  be. The enemy sought to make me weep, but I laugh.' And the old man  danced to his triumphant laugh for the victory of that day.\"    [Music: SONG OF THE LAUGH.    _Ponka. He-dhu'-shka._    Ha, ha, ha ha ha! Ha ha! hi hi! ha ha! hi!]    So this was the meaning of the monotonous song that had accompanied  the opening dance I had seen at the He-dhu'-shka Society, where the  dancer, with body bent and with short rhythmic steps, had kept time to  the dramatic laugh of the song,--a song that had seemed so aimless to  me only the night before.    \"Every song of the Society has its story which is the record of some  deed or achievement of its members,\" said another old man who was  lying beside the fire. \"I will tell you one that was known to our  great-great-grandfathers,\" and rising upon his elbow he began:--          THE STORY AND SONG OF ISH'-I-BUZ-ZHI.      \"Long ago there lived an old Omaha Indian couple who had an only  child, a son named Ish'-i-buz-zhi. From his birth he was peculiar. He  did not play like the other children; and, as he grew older, he kept  away from the boys of his own age, refusing to join in their sports or  to hunt with them for small game. He was silent and reserved with  every one but his mother and her friends. With them he chatted and was  quite at ease. So queer a little boy could not escape ridicule. The  people spoke of him as one 'having no sense,' and it seemed as though  he would have no friends except his parents and a few women intimates  of his mother.    \"During the long winter evenings, when the old men who came to his  father's lodge talked of bygone times and told tales of ancient  heroes, this silent, seemingly heedless boy caught and treasured every  word. He noted that the stories said that the mighty men of early days  were armed only with clubs. He mused on this fact, and determined to  make himself such a weapon. So he fashioned a four-sided club,  practised with it in secret, and kept it constantly with him. He was  well laughed at because he clung always to his club and would not  learn the use of the bow; but he kept his own counsel, and, as the  years went on, no one knew that the Sparrow-hawk had talked to him in  a vision, and that he had become possessed of two of its sacred  feathers.    \"One day when Ish'-i-buz-zhi had grown to be a man, he heard a group  of warriors discussing plans for an expedition against a tribal enemy.  He determined to go with them; but he said nothing, and silently  watched the men depart. That night he stole away and followed the  trail of the warriors. In the morning one of the servants of the war  party discovered him and reported to the Leader, who ordered that he  be brought in. When the men saw that it was Ish'-i-buz-zhi, they joked  him, and asked why he who cared only for the company of old women had  come to them; but the Leader rebuked the warriors and received the  youth kindly, and, when he found that the young man was not properly  provided with clothing, bade his followers to fit him out from their  own supplies. They obeyed, and they also made him a bow of ash and  gave him some arrows.    \"After many days' travel the party drew near to the enemy. A scout  discovered their camp and reported having seen one of their men. At  once the warriors prepared for battle, putting on the sacred paint and"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/25172"],[0,"Moral Principles in Education (#2)"],[1,"for us a source of continual misunderstanding between teachers  in the schools and critics of education outside of the schools. The  latter look through the school programmes, the school courses of study,  and do not find any place set apart for instruction in ethics or for  \"moral teaching.\" Then they assert that the schools are doing nothing,  or next to nothing, for character-training; they become emphatic, even  vehement, about the moral deficiencies of public education. The  schoolteachers, on the other hand, resent these criticisms as an  injustice, and hold not only that they do \"teach morals,\" but that they  teach them every moment of the day, five days in the week. In this  contention the teachers _in principle_ are in the right; if they are in  the wrong, it is not because special periods are not set aside for what  after all can only be teaching _about_ morals, but because their own  characters, or their school atmosphere and ideals, or their methods of  teaching, or the subject-matter which they teach, are not such _in  detail_ as to bring intellectual results into vital union with character  so that they become working forces in behavior. Without discussing,  therefore, the limits or the value of so-called direct moral instruction  (or, better, instruction _about_ morals), it may be laid down as  fundamental that the influence of direct moral instruction, even at its  very best, is _comparatively_ small in amount and slight in influence,  when the whole field of moral growth through education is taken into  account. This larger field of indirect and vital moral education, the  development of character through all the agencies, instrumentalities,  and materials of school life is, therefore, the subject of our present  discussion.          THE MORAL TRAINING GIVEN BY THE SCHOOL COMMUNITY          II    THE MORAL TRAINING GIVEN BY THE SCHOOL COMMUNITY      There cannot be two sets of ethical principles, one for life in the  school, and the other for life outside of the school. As conduct is one,  so also the principles of conduct are one. The tendency to discuss the  morals of the school as if the school were an institution by itself is  highly unfortunate. The moral responsibility of the school, and of those  who conduct it, is to society. The school is fundamentally an  institution erected by society to do a certain specific work,--to  exercise a certain specific function in maintaining the life and  advancing the welfare of society. The educational system which does not  recognize that this fact entails upon it an ethical responsibility is  derelict and a defaulter. It is not doing what it was called into  existence to do, and what it pretends to do. Hence the entire structure  of the school in general and its concrete workings in particular need to  be considered from time to time with reference to the social position  and function of the school.    The idea that the moral work and worth of the public school system as a  whole are to be measured by its social value is, indeed, a familiar  notion. However, it is frequently taken in too limited and rigid a way.  The social work of the school is often limited to training for  citizenship, and citizenship is then interpreted in a narrow sense as  meaning capacity to vote intelligently, disposition to obey laws, etc.  But it is futile to contract and cramp the ethical responsibility of the  school in this way. The child is one, and he must either live his social  life as an integral unified being, or suffer loss and create friction.  To pick out one of the many social relations which the child bears, and  to define the work of the school by that alone, is like instituting a  vast and complicated system of physical exercise which would have for  its object simply the development of the lungs and the power of  breathing, independent of other organs and functions. The child is an  organic whole, intellectually, socially, and morally, as well as  physically. We must take the child as a member of society in the  broadest sense, and demand for and from the schools whatever is  necessary to enable the child intelligently to recognize all his social  relations and take his part in sustaining them.    To isolate the formal relationship of citizenship from the whole system  of relations with which it is actually interwoven; to suppose that there  is some one particular study or mode of treatment which can make the  child a good citizen; to suppose, in other words, that a good citizen is  anything more than a thoroughly efficient and serviceable member of  society, one with all his powers of body and mind under control, is a  hampering superstition which it is hoped may soon disappear from  educational discussion.    The child is to be not only a voter and a subject of law; he is also to  be a member of a family, himself in turn responsible, in all  probability, for rearing and training of future children, thereby  maintaining the continuity of society. He is to be a worker, engaged in  some occupation which will be of use to society, and which will maintain  his own independence and self-respect. He is to be a member of some  particular neighborhood and community, and must contribute to the values  of life, add to the decencies and graces of civilization wherever he is.  These are bare and formal statements, but if we let our imagination  translate them into their concrete details, we have a wide and varied  scene. For the child properly to take his place in reference to these  various functions means training in science, in art, in history; means  command of the fundamental methods of inquiry and the fundamental tools  of intercourse and communication; means a trained and sound body,  skillful eye and hand; means habits of industry, perseverance; in short,  habits of serviceableness.    Moreover, the society of which the child is to be a member is, in the  United States, a democratic and progressive society. The child must be  educated for leadership as well as for obedience. He must have power of  self-direction and power of directing others, power of administration,  ability to assume positions of responsibility. This necessity of  educating for leadership is as great on the industrial as on the  political side.    New inventions, new machines, new methods of transportation and  intercourse are making over the whole scene of action year by year. It  is an absolute impossibility to educate the child for any fixed station  in life. So far as education is conducted unconsciously or consciously  on this basis, it results in fitting the future citizen for no station  in life, but makes him a drone, a hanger-on, or an actual retarding  influence in the onward movement. Instead of caring for himself and for  others, he becomes one who has himself to be cared for. Here, too, the  ethical responsibility of the school on the social side must be  interpreted in the broadest and freest spirit; it is equivalent to that  training of the child which will give him such possession of himself  that he may take charge of himself; may not only adapt himself to the  changes that are going on, but have power to shape and direct them.    Apart from participation in social life, the school has no moral end nor  aim. As long as we confine ourselves to the school as an isolated  institution, we have no directing principles, because we have no object.  For example, the end of education is said to be the harmonious  development of all the powers of the individual. Here no reference to  social life or membership is apparent, and yet many think we have in it  an adequate and thoroughgoing definition of the goal of education. But  if this definition be taken independently of social relationship we have  no way of telling what is meant by any one of the terms employed. We do  not know what a power is; we do not know what development is; we do not  know what harmony is. A power is a power only with reference to the use  to which it is put, the function it has to serve. If we leave out the  uses supplied by social life we have nothing but the old \"faculty  psychology\" to tell what is meant by power and what the specific powers  are. The principle reduces itself to enumerating a lot of faculties like  perception, memory, reasoning, etc., and then stating that each one of  these powers needs to be developed.    Education then becomes a gymnastic exercise. Acute powers of observation  and memory might be developed by studying Chinese characters; acuteness  in reasoning might be got by discussing the scholastic subtleties of the  Middle Ages. The simple fact is that there is no isolated faculty of  observation, or memory, or reasoning any more than there is an original  faculty of blacksmithing, carpentering, or steam engineering. Faculties  mean simply that particular impulses and habits have been coordinated or  framed with reference to accomplishing certain definite kinds of work.  We need to know the social situations in which the individual will have  to use ability to observe, recollect, imagine, and reason, in order to  have any way of telling what a training of mental powers actually means.    What holds in the illustration of this particular definition of  education holds good from whatever point of view we approach the matter.  Only as we interpret school activities with reference to the larger  circle of social activities to which they relate do we find any standard  for judging their moral significance.    The school itself must be a vital social institution to a much greater  extent than obtains at present. I am told that there is a swimming  school in a certain city where youth are taught to swim without going  into the water, being repeatedly drilled in the various movements which  are necessary for swimming. When one of the young men so trained was  asked what he did when he got into the water, he laconically replied,  \"Sunk.\" The story happens to be true; were it not, it"]]]
