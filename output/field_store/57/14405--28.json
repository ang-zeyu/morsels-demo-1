[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/28601"],[0,"The Christian Foundation, Or, Scientific and Religious Journal, June, 1880 (#2)"],[1," proof  is in the Savior's words to his disciples: \"If I go not away, the  Comforter will not come unto you.\" And one of the witnesses said, \"The  Holy Spirit was not yet given because Jesus was not yet glorified.\" During  the long night of apostacy between Malachi and Zechariah, there was a time  when \"all were gone out of the way;\" \"when there were none that did good,  no, not one;\" \"when darkness covered the earth, and gross darkness the  people;\" when they had not so much as \"the dayspring from on high, to give  knowledge of salvation by the remission of sins.\" \"The temple of God was a  den of thieves.\" The commandments of God were made void through the  traditions of men, and there was not a people upon the earth prepared for  the Lord, worthy of his introduction among them AS THE SON OF GOD. The  dignity of his person, consequent upon his being the Son of God, along  with his purity, rendered it improper for him to be manifested, in his  introduction as the Son of God, to a den of thieves. So a people must be  prepared for the occasion. Hence John the Baptist was sent from God to  prepare or make ready a people for the Lord. He was the \"dayspring from on  high,\" sent to give knowledge of salvation unto the people by the  remission of their sins, but the ultimate of his work is expressed in  these words: \"But that he, Christ, might be made manifest unto Israel,  therefore came I baptizing with water.\" Which was as much as to say, He  will not be made manifest to Israel unless a people in Israel is made  ready for him. Therefore John was his forerunner, to prepare the way  before him.    In doing this work he proclaimed the kingdom of God is at hand, and  \"preached the baptism of repentance for the remission of sins.\" And many  people were prepared for the Lord, and finally he is acknowledged, from  the eternal world, as the Son of God, while he is yet in the presence of  all those who were present at his baptism and heard John say, \"Behold the  Lamb of God, who taketh away the sin of the world.\" The Savior now calls  about him twelve disciples, and they make and baptize many more disciples.  John the Baptist and Jesus Christ, as prophets, were under the influence  of the Holy Spirit, and were engaged in the grandest work ever known among  men. But, so far as a wicked world was concerned, it must be redeemed from  moral pollution first, and then await the day of Pentecost for the gift of  the Holy Spirit. Thus keeping before our minds his relations to men, we  ask what was his work and relations from Pentecost and onward? On that day  he came upon the disciples, who were already converted and pardoned; so it  was not for _those purposes_ that they were baptized in the Holy Spirit.  Jesus had said to them, long before this, \"Now ye are clean through the  words which I have spoken unto you.\" And the wicked Jews had \"closed their  eyes and stopped their ears, lest they should see with their eyes and hear  with their ears and understand with their hearts and be converted and  healed.\" And Satan himself took the word out of the hearts of some \"lest  they should believe and be saved.\"    And all this took place before the Holy Spirit was given to any, whether  good or bad. So we must look outside of sinners for the presence and  wonderful work of the Spirit of God, and also outside of their conversion  for its immediate and direct agency. Jesus said to his disciples, \"If I go  away I will send you ANOTHER comforter, even the Spirit of Truth, _whom  the world can not receive_.\" And again, he said, \"Howbeit, when he, the  Spirit of Truth, is come, he shall guide you into all truth.\" \"He will  show you things to come.\" \"He shall take of the things of mine and shall  show them unto you.\" \"He shall testify of me.\" Does this look like  extraordinary work? Was it to be continued? Did it not belong to a  creative period, that was to be followed by the existence of a system, or  government, in which law and order would take the place of the  extraordinary operations of the Spirit of God?    I wish to present the promise of God which relates to the baptism of the  disciples in the Holy Spirit upon Pentecost, that we may discover, upon an  analysis of its terms, its nature and place in the reign of favor. It is  in these words: \"And it shall come to pass in the last days, saith God, I  will pour out of my spirit upon all flesh; and your sons and your  daughters shall prophecy, and your young men shall see visions, and your  old men shall dream dreams; and on my servants and on my handmaidens I  will pour out in those days of my spirit; and they shall prophesy.\" Jesus  gave his disciples the great commission to go into all the world and  preach the Gospel to every creature, but said, \"Tarry ye in Jerusalem  until ye be endued with power from on high.\" After the Savior ascended it  is said that he received the promise of the Father and shed forth that  which was seen and heard on the day of Pentecost. What was the result?  They spake with tongues. They prophesied. They healed the sick. They  raised the dead. They bestowed spiritual gifts. They were guided into all  truth. They \"preached the gospel with the Holy Spirit sent down from  heaven;\" and in this fact we have the beautiful figure of rivers of living  water flowing out of their hearts, for Jesus said, \"He that believeth on  me, as the scripture hath said, out of his belly (From the Heart, inward  part) shall flow rivers of living water.\" This, the historian says, \"He  spake of the spirit which they that believed on him were to receive,  because the Holy Spirit was not yet given, for Jesus was not yet  glorified.\" Hence, we are authorized to look for its fulfillment at  Pentecost, and also in the preaching of the gospel of Christ. Paul says,  \"My speech and my preaching was not with enticing words of man's wisdom,  but in demonstration of the Spirit and of power: that your faith should  not stand in the wisdom of men, but in the power of God.\" Here is the  basis of our faith.    All those who believe on Christ through the words of the apostles have a  faith that stands in the power of God. The apostle further adds, \"Now we  have not received the spirit of the world, but the Spirit which is of God;  that we might know the things that are freely given to us of God. Which  things also we speak, not in the words which man's wisdom teacheth, but  which the Holy Spirit teacheth, comparing spiritual things with  spiritual.\" Before the Savior left the world he breathed upon his apostles  and said, \"Receive ye the Holy Spirit,\" adding, \"Whosesoever sins ye remit  they are remitted unto them, and whosesoever sins ye retain they are  retained.\" So it pleased the Father to \"save men through the foolishness  of preaching.\" And Paul said, \"We preach not ourselves, but Christ Jesus  the Lord; and ourselves your servants for Jesus's sake. For God, who  commanded the light to shine out of darkness, hath shined in our hearts,  to give the light of the knowledge of the glory of God in the face of  Jesus Christ. But we have this treasure in earthen vessels, that the  excellency of the power may be of God, and not of us.\"    The mystery of Christ was revealed to all nations for the obedience of  faith. Paul says, the mystery of God's will was made known according to  his good pleasure which he purposed in himself, and that he was \"made a  minister according to the dispensation of God which was given to him for  us, to fulfill the word of God, even the mystery which had been hid from  ages and from generations, but now is made manifest to his saints. To whom  God would make known what is the riches of the glory of this mystery among  the Gentiles; which is Christ in you, the hope of glory, whom we preach,  warning every man, and teaching every man in all wisdom, that we may  present every man perfect in Christ Jesus.\" \"Whereunto,\" he says, \"I also  labor, striving according to _his working_, which _worketh in me  mightily_.\" From all that we have before us it appears that all things in  the gospel of Jesus Christ constitute, simply, \"the ministration of the  Spirit written upon the hearts of New Testament apostles and prophets, or  teachers, by the Spirit of the living God, and that we have in their  preaching and teaching the rivers of living water, flowing out from the  throne of God to slake the thirst of a famishing world, and that all this  is attributable to the descent of the Holy Spirit upon them.\" Such being  the case, \"the gospel is the power of God unto salvation unto every one  that believes.\" And in it Jesus Christ, the Sun and Lord, in the moral and  spiritual universe, shines forth with all his satellites as the light of  the world. The creative period is now past. The extraordinary efforts of  the divine Spirit are past. \"The darkness is past and the true light now  shineth.\" The ordinary has taken the place of the extraordinary. What good  would it do to have a repetition of the extraordinary? Would it give us  another gospel, and confirm it by signs and wonders and divers miracles?  Would it give us another Christ? Would it give us other rivers of living  water? or another word of reconciliation? What good would be accomplished  by a repetition of the energies of the Divine Spirit, as they are known in  the history of the new creation? Do we need these to dispel the darkness?  \"The darkness is past.\" Do we need them to give us light? \"The true light  now shineth.\" Do we need them to give us more truth? Jesus said of the  Spirit: \"He shall guide you into all truth.\" The Roman Catholic priest, in  his discussion with Mr. Chillingworth, planted himself upon this promise,  made by the Savior to his apostles, as the proof of the claim of Romanists  to the attribute of infallibility. Said he: \"If the attribute of  infallibility is not in the possession of the church, the promise of the  Savior has failed.\" To this Mr. Chillingworth replied: \"It would be well  for us to"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/28613"],[0,"Pioneers of Science (#2)"],[1,"ISAAC NEWTON                                                 200      70.

PIONEERS OF SCIENCE          LECTURE I    COPERNICUS AND THE MOTION OF THE EARTH      The ordinary run of men live among phenomena of which they know nothing  and care less. They see bodies fall to the earth, they hear sounds, they  kindle fires, they see the heavens roll above them, but of the causes  and inner working of the whole they are ignorant, and with their  ignorance they are content.    \"Understand the structure of a soap-bubble?\" said a cultivated literary  man whom I know; \"I wouldn't cross the street to know it!\"    And if this is a prevalent attitude now, what must have been the  attitude in ancient times, when mankind was emerging from savagery, and  when history seems composed of harassments by wars abroad and  revolutions at home? In the most violently disturbed times indeed, those  with which ordinary history is mainly occupied, science is quite  impossible. It needs as its condition, in order to flourish, a fairly  quiet, untroubled state, or else a cloister or university removed from  the din and bustle of the political and commercial world. In such places  it has taken its rise, and in such peaceful places and quiet times true  science will continue to be cultivated.    The great bulk of mankind must always remain, I suppose, more or less  careless of scientific research and scientific result, except in so far  as it affects their modes of locomotion, their health and pleasure, or  their purse.    But among a people hurried and busy and preoccupied, some in the pursuit  of riches, some in the pursuit of pleasure, and some, the majority, in  the struggle for existence, there arise in every generation, here and  there, one or two great souls--men who seem of another age and country,  who look upon the bustle and feverish activity and are not infected by  it, who watch others achieving prizes of riches and pleasure and are not  disturbed, who look on the world and the universe they are born in with  quite other eyes. To them it appears not as a bazaar to buy and to sell  in; not as a ladder to scramble up (or down) helter-skelter without  knowing whither or why; but as a fact--a great and mysterious fact--to  be pondered over, studied, and perchance in some small measure  understood. By the multitude these men were sneered at as eccentric or  feared as supernatural. Their calm, clear, contemplative attitude seemed  either insane or diabolic; and accordingly they have been pitied as  enthusiasts or killed as blasphemers. One of these great souls may have  been a prophet or preacher, and have called to his generation to bethink  them of why and what they were, to struggle less and meditate more, to  search for things of true value and not for dross. Another has been a  poet or musician, and has uttered in words or in song thoughts dimly  possible to many men, but by them unutterable and left inarticulate.  Another has been influenced still more _directly_ by the universe around  him, has felt at times overpowered by the mystery and solemnity of it  all, and has been impelled by a force stronger than himself to study it,  patiently, slowly, diligently; content if he could gather a few crumbs  of the great harvest of knowledge, happy if he could grasp some great  generalization or wide-embracing law, and so in some small measure enter  into the mind and thought of the Designer of all this wondrous frame of  things.    These last have been the men of science, the great and heaven-born men  of science; and they are few. In our own day, amid the throng of  inventions, there are a multitude of small men using the name of science  but working for their own ends, jostling and scrambling just as they  would jostle and scramble in any other trade or profession. These may be  workers, they may and do advance knowledge, but they are never pioneers.  Not to them is it given to open out great tracts of unexplored  territory, or to view the promised land as from a mountain-top. Of them  we shall not speak; we will concern ourselves only with the greatest,  the epoch-making men, to whose life and work we and all who come after  them owe so much. Such a man was "]]]
