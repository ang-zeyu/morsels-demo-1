[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/25282"],[0,"The Jewish State (#2)"],[1,"my present  conception of the Jewish problem.\" While he was in Paris he was  stirred as never before by the feeling that the plight of the Jews was  a problem which would have to have the cooperation of enlightened  statesmanship. What excited him in the strangest way was the  unaccountable indifference of Jews themselves to what seemed to him  the menace of the existing situation. He saw the Jews in every land  encircled by enemies, hostility to them growing with the increase of  their numbers. In his excitement he thought first of Jewish  philanthropists. He sought an interview with Baron Maurice de Hirsch  in May, 1895. He planned an address to the Rothschilds. He talked of  his ideas to friends in literary circles. His mind was obsessed by a  gigantic problem which gave him no rest. He was struggling to pierce  the veils of revelation. He saw a world in which the Jewish people  lacked a fulcrum for national action and therefore had to seek to  create it through beneficence. He had a remarkably resourceful and  agile imagination. He weighed ideas, balanced them, discarded them,  reflected, reconsidered, tried to reconcile contradictions, and  finally came to what seemed to him at the moment the synthesis of the  issue which seemed acceptable to reason and sentiment.           *       *       *       *       *    Obviously, \"The Jewish State\" was not a dogmatic finality. Most of the  plans for settlement and migration are improvisations. The pamphlet  was not a rigid plan or a blueprint. It was not a description of a  Utopia, although some parts of it give that impression. It had an  indicated destiny but was not bound by a rigid line. It was the  illumination of a dynamic thought and followed the light with the hope  that it might lead to fulfillment. There was room for detours and  variations. It was to be rewritten, as he knew, not by its author but  by the Jewish people on their way to freedom.           *       *       *       *       *    In fact, it was revised from the moment the Zionist movement was  organized on an international basis. The \"Society of Jews\" became the  Zionist Organization, with its statutes, its procedures, its public  excitement and controversies. \"The Jewish Company\" became the Bank;  then more specifically, the Jewish Colonial Trust and later the  Anglo-Palestine Bank. The description of the _Gestor_, which appears  in the final chapter of the pamphlet, was never referred to again,  but in effect it was incorporated in the idea of a state  in-the-process-of-becoming. Its legitimate successor is the Jewish  Agency referred to in the Mandate for Palestine. He was first led by  the idea that the way to the charter was through the Sultan and that  the Sultan would be influenced by Kaiser Wilhelm. But both princes  failing him, he turned to England and Joseph Chamberlain, and came to  the Uganda proposal. This was Herzl's one political success although  the project was, in effect, rejected by the Zionist Congress. But  this encounter with England was a precedent which led to much  speculation in Zionist circles and gave a turn to Zionist thought  away from Germany and Turkey. It served to inspire Dr. Chaim Weizman  to make his home in England with the express purpose of seeking  English sympathy for the Zionist ideal. The successor of Joseph  Chamberlain was Arthur James Balfour. When Herzl opened Chamberlain's  door, Zionism had an easier access to the England of Balfour.    When Herzl first appeared on the political scene, he thought of  courtiers and statesmen, of princes and kings. He found that they  could not be relied upon for truth or stability. They were encircled  by favorites and mercenaries. Enormous responsibilities rested upon  their shoulders but they seemed to behave with regard to these  responsibilities as if they were gamblers or amateurs. Herzl soon  realized that these were frail reeds that would break under the  slightest pressure. He came to put his trust in the Jewish people,  the only real source of strength for the purpose of redemption.  Confidence in themselves would give them power to breach their prison  walls. His aristocratic republic had to become a movement of  democracy. Only in \"The Jewish State\" will you find reference to a  movement based upon Jews who endorse a \"fixed program,\" and then  become members under the \"discipline\" of leadership. When Herzl faced  the First Congress, he saw that this conception of Zionism was foreign  to the nature and character of the Jewish people. The shekel was the  registry of a name. It led the way to the elevation of the individual  in Zionist affairs, first as a member of a democratic army \"willing\"  the fulfillment, and then settling in Palestine to become the hands  that built the Homeland.    Arrayed in the armor of democracy, the Zionist movement made the  self-emancipation ideal of Pinsker live in the soul of Herzl. At a  number of Congresses, in his articles in Die Welt, Herzl showed how  that idea had become an integral part of his life, although his first  thoughts ran in quite another direction.    But his analysis of anti-Semitism and how to approach the problem  remains true today after Hitler, as it was true then after Dreyfus.  This was the authentic revelation that in his last days was fixed in  his mind. The homelessness of the Jewish people must come to an end.  That tragedy is a world problem. It is to be solved by world  statesmanship in cooperation with the reawakened Jewish people. It is  to be solved by the establishment of a free Jewish State in their  historic Homeland. Herzl manifested his utter identification with the  destiny of his own people at the Uganda Congress when he faced the  rebellious Russian Zionists, spoke words of consolation to them and  gave them assurances of his fealty to Zion. He died a few months  later.    \"The Jewish State\" was not regarded by Herzl as a piece of literature.  It was a political document. It was to serve as the introduction to  political action. It was to lead to the conversion of leaders in  political life. It was to win converts to the idea of a Jewish State.  Although a shy man at first, he did not hesitate to make his way  through the corridors of the great and suffer the humiliations of the  suppliant. Through that remarkable friend and Christian, the Reverend  William H. Hechler, he met the Grand Duke of Baden; he made the rounds  of German statesmen, Count zu Eulenburg, Foreign Minister, Von Buelow  and Reichschancellor Hohenlohe; then he met the favorites who  encircled Sultan Abdul Hamid and the Sultan himself. He placed the  dramatic personae of his drama on the stage. The plan involved the  Turkish debt, the German interest in the Orient. It involved  stimulating the Russians and visiting the Pope. At first his political  activities were conducted as the author of a startling pamphlet, then  as the leader of his people. He became conscious of his leadership,  and played his part with superb dignity. He had ease of manner and  correct form. He created the impression of a regal personality; his  noble appearance hid his hesitations and fears. With the Sultan he  played the most remarkable game of diplomacy. He believed that once a  mutual interest could be arrived at, he would be able to secure the  funds, although at the time of speaking he had no funds at all.  Adjusting himself to the wily Turk, he had to change and diminish his  demands and finally, when he was dangerously near a disclosure, he was  saved by the Sultan's transferring his interest to the French and  obtaining his funds from them. With Kaiser Wilhelm, he soon  appreciated the fact that he had to deal with a great theatrical  personality who spoke of plans and purpose with great fire, but had  no courage and whose convictions melted away in the face of  obstacles.    The world Herzl dealt with has passed away. The Turkish Empire now  occupies a small part of the Near East. Its former provinces have now  become \"sovereign\" states struggling to establish harmony between  themselves and feeding on their animus towards the Jewish people  returning home. The methods of diplomacy have changed. Loudness of  speech is no longer out of order. Frankness and brutality may be  expected at any international gathering. It is now felt as never  before that behind political leaders, rulers, princes, statesmen, the  people are advancing and soon will be able to push aside those who  make of the relations of peoples a game and a gamble, a struggle for  power, which, when achieved, dissolves into the nothingness of vanity.           *       *       *       *       *    \"The Jewish State\" should be regarded as one of a series of books,  variations on the same theme, composed by the same author. The first  was \"The New Ghetto\" (1894). That was a play which dealt with the  social life of the upper class of Jews in Vienna. Then came the  \"Address to the Rothschilds.\" That was a memorandum which contained a  proposal to Jewish philanthropists. \"The Jewish State\" was the third  effort of an agitated mind, wavering between the projection of a  Utopia or a thesis, and containing the political solution of the  Jewish problem. The final variant of the original theme was the novel  \"Altneuland.\" Here he pictured the Promised Land as it might become  twenty years after the beginning of the Zionist movement. In the  interims, he played on the exciting stage of the Zionist Congresses.  He paid court to princes and their satellites. He led in the  organization of the Jewish Colonial Trust and the Jewish National  Fund. He delivered political addresses and engaged in political  controversy. He began the writing of his \"Diaries\" after he had  written \"The Jewish State.\" His whole personality is reflected in that  remarkable book. There you see his ideas in the process of becoming  clear. There you see his sharp reactions; the reflection of his hopes,  his disappointments, his shifts from untenable"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/2529"],[0,"The Analysis of Mind (#2)"],[1,"\"conscious\" of what we see and hear, of what we remember, and of our own  thoughts and feelings. Most of us believe that tables and chairs are  not \"conscious.\" We think that when we sit in a chair, we are aware  of sitting in it, but it is not aware of being sat in. It cannot for  a moment be doubted that we are right in believing that there is SOME  difference between us and the chair in this respect: so much may be  taken as fact, and as a datum for our inquiry. But as soon as we try to  say what exactly the difference is, we become involved in perplexities.  Is \"consciousness\" ultimate and simple, something to be merely accepted  and contemplated? Or is it something complex, perhaps consisting in our  way of behaving in the presence of objects, or, alternatively, in the  existence in us of things called \"ideas,\" having a certain relation  to objects, though different from them, and only symbolically  representative of them? Such questions are not easy to answer; but until  they are answered we cannot profess to know what we mean by saying that  we are possessed of \"consciousness.\"    Before considering modern theories, let us look first at consciousness  from the standpoint of conventional psychology, since this embodies  views which naturally occur when we begin to reflect upon the subject.  For this purpose, let us as a preliminary consider different ways of  being conscious.    First, there is the way of PERCEPTION. We \"perceive\" tables and chairs,  horses and dogs, our friends, traffic passing in the street--in short,  anything which we recognize through the senses. I leave on one side for  the present the question whether pure sensation is to be regarded as a  form of consciousness: what I am speaking of now is perception, where,  according to conventional psychology, we go beyond the sensation to the  \"thing\" which it represents. When you hear a donkey bray, you not only  hear a noise, but realize that it comes from a donkey. When you see a  table, you not only see a coloured surface, but realize that it is hard.  The addition of these elements that go beyond crude sensation is said to  constitute perception. We shall have more to say about this at a later  stage. For the moment, I am merely concerned to note that perception  of objects is one of the most obvious examples of what is called  \"consciousness.\" We are \"conscious\" of anything that we perceive.    We may take next the way of MEMORY. If I set to work to recall what  I did this morning, that is a form of consciousness different from  perception, since it is concerned with the past. There are various  problems as to how we can be conscious now of what no longer exists.  These will be dealt with incidentally when we come to the analysis of  memory.    From memory it is an easy step to what are called \"ideas\"--not in the  Platonic sense, but in that of Locke, Berkeley and Hume, in which they  are opposed to \"impressions.\" You may be conscious of a friend either  by seeing him or by \"thinking\" of him; and by \"thought\" you can be  conscious of objects which cannot be seen, such as the human race,  or physiology. \"Thought\" in the narrower sense is that form of  consciousness which consists in \"ideas\" as opposed to impressions or  mere memories.    We may end our preliminary catalogue with BELIEF, by which I mean that  way of being conscious which may be either true or false. We say that a  man is \"conscious of looking a fool,\" by which we mean that he believes  he looks a fool, and is not mistaken in this belief. This is a different  form of consciousness from any of the earlier ones. It is the form which  gives \"knowledge\" in the strict sense, and also error. It is, at least  apparently, more complex than our previous forms of consciousness;  though we shall find that they are not so separable from it as they  might appear to be.    Besides ways of being conscious there are other things that would  ordinarily be called \"mental,\" such as desire and pleasure and pain.  These raise problems of their own, which we shall reach in Lecture III.  But the hardest problems are those that arise concerning ways of being  \"conscious.\" These ways, taken together, are called the \"cognitive\"  elements in mind, and it is these that will occupy us most during the  following lectures.    There is one element which SEEMS obviously in common among the different  ways of being conscious, and that is, that they are all directed to  OBJECTS. We are conscious \"of\" something. The consciousness, it seems,  is one thing, and that of which we are conscious is another thing.  Unless we are to acquiesce in the view that we can never be conscious  of anything outside our own minds, we must say that the object of  consciousness need not be mental, though the consciousness must be. (I  am speaking within the circle of conventional doctrines, not expressing  my own beliefs.) This direction towards an object is commonly regarded  as typical of every form of cognition, and sometimes of mental life  altogether. We may distinguish two different tendencies in traditional  psychology. There are those who take mental phenomena naively, just as  they would physical phenomena. This school of psychologists tends not to  emphasize the object. On the other hand, there are those whose primary  interest is in the apparent fact that we have KNOWLEDGE, that there is a  world surrounding us of which we are aware. These men are interested in  the mind because of its relation to the world, because knowledge, if  it is a fact, is a very mysterious one. Their interest in psychology  is naturally centred in the relation of consciousness to its object, a  problem which, properly, belongs rather to theory of knowledge. We may  take as one of the best and most typical representatives of this school  the Austrian psychologist Brentano, whose \"Psychology from the Empirical  Standpoint,\"* though published in 1874, is still influential and was the  starting-point of a great deal of interesting work. He says (p. 115):         * \"Psychologie vom empirischen Standpunkte,\" vol. i, 1874.       (The second volume was never published.)    \"Every psychical phenomenon is characterized by what the scholastics of  the Middle Ages called the intentional (also the mental) inexistence of  an object, and what we, although with not quite unambiguous expressions,  would call relation to a content, direction towards an object (which is  not here to be understood as a reality), or immanent objectivity. Each  contains something in itself as an object, though not each in the same  way. In presentation something is presented, in judgment something is  acknowledged or rejected, in love something is loved, in hatred hated,  in desire desired, and so on.    \"This intentional inexistence is exclusively peculiar to psychical  phenomena. No physical phenomenon shows anything similar. And so we  can define psychical phenomena by saying that they are phenomena which  intentionally contain an object in themselves.\"    The view here expressed, that relation to an object is an ultimate  irreducible characteristic of mental phenomena, is one which I shall be  concerned to combat. Like Brentano, I am interested in psychology, not  so much for its own sake, as for the light that it may throw on the  problem of knowledge. Until very lately I believed, as he did, that  mental phenomena have essential reference to objects, except possibly in  the case of pleasure and pain. Now I no longer believe this, even in  the case of knowledge. I shall try to make my reasons for this rejection  clear as we proceed. It must be evident at first glance that the  analysis of knowledge is rendered more difficult by the rejection; but  the apparent simplicity of Brentano's view of knowledge will be found,  if I am not mistaken, incapable of maintaining itself either against  an analytic scrutiny or against a host of facts in psycho-analysis and  animal psychology. I do not wish to minimize the problems. I will  merely observe, in mitigation of our prospective labours, that thinking,  however it is to be analysed, is in itself a delightful occupation,  and that there is no enemy to thinking so deadly as a false simplicity.  Travelling, whether in the mental or the physical world, is a joy, and  it is good to know that, in the mental world at least, there are vast  countries still very imperfectly explored.    The view expressed by Brentano has been held very generally, and  developed by many writers. Among these we may take as an example his  Austrian successor Meinong.* According to him there are three elements  involved in the thought of an object. These three he calls the act, the  content and the object. The act is the same in any two cases of the same  kind of consciousness; for instance, if I think of Smith or think  of Brown, the act of thinking, in itself, is exactly similar on both  occasions. But the content of my thought, the particular event that  is happening in my mind, is different when I think of Smith and when I  think of Brown. The content, Meinong argues, must not be confounded with  the object, since the content must exist in my mind at the moment when  I have the thought, whereas the object need not do so. The object may  be something past or future; it may be physical, not mental; it may  be something abstract, like equality for example; it may be something  imaginary, like a golden mountain; or it may even be something  self-contradictory, like a round square. But in all these cases, so  he contends, the content exists when the thought exists, and is what  distinguishes it, as an occurrence, from other thoughts.         * See, e.g. his article: \"Ueber Gegenstande hoherer Ordnung       und deren Verhaltniss zur inneren Wahrnehmung,\" \"Zeitschrift       fur Psychologie and Physiologie der Sinnesorgane,\" vol. xxi,       pp. 182-272 (1899), especially pp. 185-8.    To make this theory concrete, let us suppose that you are thinking of  St. Paul's."]]]
