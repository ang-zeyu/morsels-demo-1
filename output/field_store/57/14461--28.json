Bah! But I am hoping that my  turn will come next.\"    \"Your turn for what, Ana?\"    \"To enter the Room of Release. Perhaps, if Aimu approves of you, you,  too, may taste of death.\" Her gentle smile was beatific.    \"Do you speak of Sir Basil Addington?\"    \"He was called that once, before he came to us. Now he has no name. We  can find none holy enough for him; and so we call him Aimu, which means  good friend.\" Her beautiful face was sweet with reverence.    And now, in the distance, Hale saw that the path led into a large  clearing. He slowed his pace, for he wanted to know this lovely girl  better before he joined the Ungapuks.    \"Who are you, Ana?\" he asked suddenly, bending closer to the crinkled,  dull-gold hair.    \"I am Ana, a white woman.\" She looked at him frankly.    \"But who are your parents, and how did you get among the Ungapuks?\"    Ana's red lips curved into a dewy smile. \"I thought all white men were  wise, like Aimu. But you are stupid. How do you think a white woman  could appear in a tribe of Indians who live in the jungle, many weeks'  journey from what you call civilization?\"    Hale looked a little blank and more than a little disconcerted.    \"I suppose I am stupid,\" he said dryly. \"But tell me, Ana, how did you  get here?\"    \"Why,\" she exclaimed, \"he made me!\"    \"Made you? Good Lord! What do you mean?\"    \"Just what I said, Hale Oakham. If he can take a few grains of dust and  make a shoot that will grow into a giant tree like yonder monster  itauba, don't you think he can create a small white girl like me?\" Her  orchid-blue eyes glowed innocently into his.           *       *       *       *       *    The eager questions that he would have asked froze upon his lips, for a  party of Indians approached.    The six nearly naked red men came close and surveyed him, toying  nervously with their primitive, feather-decorated weapons.    A tall, handsome young fellow who possessed something of the picturesque  perfection of the North American plains' Indian stepped forward and, in  perfect English, said:    \"Good morning, white stranger. What is it you wish of the Ungapuks?\"    \"I came to see your white _cacique_,\" said Hale.    \"Aimu? What is it you wish of Aimu? He is ours, white stranger.\"    \"Yes, he is yours. I come as a friend, perhaps to help him in his great  work.\"    \"Perhaps!\" The young Indian folded his bronze, muscular arms over his  broad chest and continued his cool survey of Hale. \"White men before you  have come: spies and thieves. Some we poisoned with curari. Others Aimu  took into the Room of Release.\"    He turned to Ana, who was still standing by Hale, and his expression  softened.    \"What shall we do with him, Ana?\" he asked the question, a fleeting look  of hunger swept his fine, flashing eyes.    Ana flushed beautifully, and, moving closer to Hale, with an impulsive,  almost childish gesture, slipped her arm through his.    \"Let us take him to our village, Unani Assu!\" she suggested. \"I like  him.\"    It was Hale's turn to flush, which he did like a schoolboy.           *       *       *       *       *    Unani Assu's brows drew together in a scowl. The hand holding his  blow-pipe jerked convulsively.    \"Ana! Come away!\" he growled. \"You mustn't touch a stranger!\"    Ana's blue eyes stretched with astonishment. \"But I like to touch him,  Unani Assu!\"    The tall Indian, with a half comical gesture of despair, said:    \"Don't misunderstand her, stranger. She is young, very young, ah! And  she has known only the reborn men of the Ungapuks.\"    He stepped firmly over to Ana, and, taking the girl by the arm, drew her  away.    \"Run ahead,\" he commanded, \"and tell Aimu that we come.\"    Ana, her feathered bamboo anklets clicking together, sped away.    Unani Assu bowed courteously to Hale.    \"Come, stranger. If you are an enemy, it is you who must fear.\" He  motioned for him to proceed down the jungle path.    The path ended at a clearing studded with _moloccas_, the Indian grass  huts made of plaited straw. Altogether the scene was peaceful and sane  and far removed from the strange tales that Hale had heard concerning  the Ungapuks.    Hale was conducted to a long, low stone building, where, in the  doorway, stood a tall and emaciated white man.    \"Aimu!\" said the Indians reverently, and bowed themselves.    Over the bare, brown backs, the white man looked at Hale.    \"Sir Basil Addington?\" asked the young man.    \"Yes. You are welcome. Come in.\"    Hale entered the building.           *       *       *       *       *    He was in a book-filled study, furnished with hand-made chairs and a  desk. Sir Basil asked him to be seated. He offered the young man long,  brown native cigarettes and a very good drink made from yucca.    After several minutes of conversation, Sir Basil suddenly changed his  manner.    \"And now,\" he shot out, eyeing the young man through narrowed lids,  \"will you please state the purpose of this visit?\"    Hale looked squarely at his questioner. \"Frankly, Sir Basil, I have  called on you because I am so intensely interested in your work among  the Ungapuks that I wish to offer my services.\"    He gave in detail his family history, his education, and his experience  as a teacher and a scientist.    Sir Basil tapped his teeth thoughtfully with a pencil.    \"But why do you think you can be of assistance to me?\"    \"That, of course, is for you to decide.\"    Hale thought that the scientist looked like a huge, starved crow in his  loose-fitting coat. He was so fleshless that, when the light fell  strongly on his face as it now did, the bones of his head and hands  showed through the skin with horrible clearness.    Hale, under Sir Basil's scrutiny, decided instantly that he did not like  him.    \"I need a helper,\" the scientist went on, with the air of talking to  himself. \"A white assistant who neither loves nor fears me. Unani Assu  is good enough in his way, but I need a helper who has had technical  training.\" Suddenly he wheeled on Hale and asked sharply, \"How are your  nerves, young man?\"           *       *       *       *       *    Hale started, but managed to answer calmly. \"Excellent. My war record  isn't half bad, and that was surely backed with good nerves.\"    \"And you say you have no close relatives, no ties of any sort to  interfere with work that is dangerous--and something else?\"    \"Not a soul would care if I passed out to-day, Sir Basil.\"    \"Good! And now tell me this: are you one of those scientists whose minds  are so mechanical, so mathematically made, as it were, that your entire  outlook on science is based on old, established beliefs, or do you  belong to that rare but modern type of trained thinker and dreamer who  refuse to permit yesterday's convictions to influence to-day's  visions?\"    Hale smiled quietly. \"I recently lost my chair in a famous university  because of my so-called unscientific teachings regarding ether-drift.\"    Expressing himself in purely scientific terms, he went into an  elaboration of his revolutionary theory. When he had finished, Sir Basil  reached out his clawlike hand to him.    \"Good!\" he approved. \"You have dared to think originally. Now listen to  my theory of mind-electrons which has grown into the established fact  that I have discovered the secret of life and death.\"    The long, thin hands reached into a pocket for a box of pills. He  swallowed one greedily, and immediately his emaciated face seemed  charged with new virility.    He spoke out suddenly. \"Our world, you know, is made up of three powers:  matter, energy and what you call life. I might really say that there are  but two powers, for matter, in its last analysis, is a form of energy.  And what is life? You can't call it a form of energy, for every  inorganic atom has energy without having life. Life, Mr. Oakham, is  mind or consciousness.\"    He began pacing the floor restlessly. \"Everything that lives has this  consciousness, and I say this in defiance of some fixed scientific  views. The amoeba in a stagnant pool, a thallophyte on a bit of old  bread, any of the myriads of trees and plants that you see in the jungle  all have consciousness as well as you. And why?\"           *       *       *       *       *    He brought his fist down upon the table. \"Because they issue from the  same source as you and I, the almighty mind, eternal, indestructible,  which has permitted itself to be enslaved by matter. You are Hale  Oakham. I am Basil Addington, yet we are one and the same. Let me  illustrate.\"    He seized a glass and poured it full of _masata_. \"Look! Two portions of  _masata_. But I pour what is in the glass back into the bottle. The  molecules cohere and the two portions become one again. Some day you and  I--our individual consciousnesses--will flow back to the Whole. That  sounds mystical, but listen.    \"We scientists hold that the electron explains nearly all the physical  and chemical phenomena. I go further and say that it explains _all_.  Matter, electricity, light, heat, magnetism--all can be reduced to the  ultimate unit. So, Mr. Oakham, I am going to make clear to you how life  itself is electronic.\"    His long finger touched Hale's arm. \"You, I, yonder mosquito on your  sleeve, even one of the germs that is causing my malaria, all being  individual living things, are the ultimate units of what I shall  personify as the Mind. When I say _you_ I do not speak of that mound of  flesh in which you exist, and which can be reduced to the same familiar  basic elements and compounds as make up inorganic structures; I speak of  your mind, your consciousness--for that is the real you. Are you  following me?\"    \"Perfectly, Sir Basil.\" Hale reached for another"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/307"],[0,"Three Elephant Power, and Other Stories (#2)"],[1,"car thinks he has the fastest car in  Australia, and when he sees Henery and the old man coming, he tells his  driver to let her out a little; but Henery gives the ninety-horse the  full of the lever, and whips up alongside in one jump. And then he keeps  there just half a length ahead of him, tormentin' him like. And the  owner of the French car he yells out to old John Bull, 'You're going  a nice pace for an old 'un,' he says. Old John has a blink down at  the indicator. 'We're doing twenty-five,' he yells out. 'Twenty-five  grandmothers,' says the bloke; but Henery he put on his accelerator, and  left him. It wouldn't do to let the old man get wise to it, you know.\"    We topped a big hill, and Alfred cut off the engine and let the car  swoop, as swiftly and noiselessly as an eagle, down to the flat country  below.    \"You're a long while coming to the elephant, Alfred,\" I said.    \"Well, now, I'll tell you about the elephant,\" said Alfred, letting his  clutch in again, and taking up the story to the accompaniment of the  rhythmic throb of the engine.    \"One day Henery and the old man were going out a long trip over the  mountain, and down the Kangaroo Valley Road that's all cut out of the  side of the 'ill. And after they's gone a mile or two, Henery sees a  track in the road--the track of the biggest car he ever seen or 'eard  of. An' the more he looks at it, the more he reckons he must ketch that  car and see what she's made of. So he slows down passin' two yokels on  the road, and he says, 'Did you see a big car along 'ere?'    \"'Yes, we did,' they says.    \"'How big is she?' says Henery.    \"'Biggest car ever we see,' says the yokels, and they laughed that silly  way these yokels always does.    \"'How many horse-power do you think she was?' says Henery.    \"'Horse-power,' they says; 'elephant-power, you mean! She was three  elephant-power,' they says; and they goes 'Haw, haw!' and Henery drops  his clutch in, and off he goes after that car.\"    Alfred lit another cigarette as a preliminary to the climax.    \"So they run for miles, and all the time there's the track ahead of 'em,  and Henery keeps lettin' her out, thinkin' that he'll never ketch that  car. They went through a town so fast, the old man he says, 'What house  was that we just passed,' he says. At last they come to the top of the  big 'ill, and there's the tracks of the big car goin' straight down  ahead of 'em.    \"D'you know that road? It's all cut out of the side of the mountain, and  there's places where if she was to side-slip you'd go down 'undreds  of thousands of feet. And there's sharp turns, too; but the surface is  good, so Henery he lets her out, and down they go, whizzin' round the  turns and skatin' out near the edge, and the old cove sittin' there  enjoyin' it, never knowin' the danger. And comin' to one turn Henery  gives a toot on the 'orn, and then he heard somethin' go 'toot, toot'  right away down the mountain.    \"'Bout a mile ahead it seemed to be, and Henery reckoned he'd go another  four miles before he'd ketch it, so he chances them turns more than  ever. And she was pretty hot, too; but he kept her at it, and he hadn't  gone a full mile till he come round a turn about forty miles an hour,  and before he could stop he run right into it, and wot do you think it  was?\"    I hadn't the faintest idea.    \"A circus. One of them travellin' circuses, goin' down the coast; and  one of the elephants had sore feet, so they put him in a big waggon,  and another elephant pulled in front and one pushed behind. Three  elephant-power it was, right enough. That was the waggon wot made the  big track. Well, it was all done so sudden. Before Henery could stop, he  runs the radiator--very near boiling she was--up against the elephant's  tail, and prints the pattern of the latest honeycomb radiator on the  elephant as clear as if you done it with a stencil.    \"The elephant, he lets a roar out of him like one of them bulls  bellerin', and he puts out his nose and ketches Henery round the neck,  and yanks him out of the car, and chucks him right clean over the cliff,  'bout a thousand feet. But he never done nothin' to the old bloke.\"    \"Good gracious!\"    \"Well, it finished Henery, killed him stone dead, of course, and the old  man he was terrible cut up over losin' such a steady, trustworthy man.  'Never get another like him,' he says.\"    We were nearly at our journey's end, and we turned through a gate  into the home paddocks. Some young stock, both horses and cattle, came  frisking and cantering after the car, and the rough bush track took  all Alfred's attention. We crossed a creek, the water swishing from the  wheels, and began the long pull up to the homestead. Over the clamour of  the little-used second speed, Alfred concluded his narrative.    \"The old bloke advertised,\" he said, \"for another driver, a steady,  reliable man to drive a twenty horse-power, four-cylinder touring car.  Every driver in Sydney put in for it. Nothing like a fast car to fetch  'em, you know. And Scotty got it. Him wot used to drive the Napier I was  tellin' you about.\"    \"And what did the old man say when he found he'd been running a racing  car?\"    \"He don't know now. Scotty never told 'im. Why should he? He's drivin'  about the country now, the boss of the roads, but he won't chance  her near a circus. Thinks he might bump the same elephant. And that  elephant, every time he smells a car passin' in the road, he goes near  mad with fright. If he ever sees that car again, do you think he'd know  it?\"    Not being used to elephants, I could not offer an opinion.          THE ORACLE      No tram ever goes to Randwick races without him; he is always fat,  hairy, and assertive; he is generally one of a party, and takes the  centre of the stage all the time--collects and hands over the fares,  adjusts the change, chaffs the conductor, crushes the thin, apologetic  stranger next him into a pulp, and talks to the whole compartment as if  they had asked for his opinion.    He knows all the trainers and owners, or takes care to give the  impression that he does. He slowly and pompously hauls out his  race book, and one of his satellites opens the ball by saying, in a  deferential way:    \"What do you like for the 'urdles, Charley?\"    The Oracle looks at the book and breathes heavily; no one else ventures  to speak.    \"Well,\" he says, at last, \"of course there's only one in it--if he's  wanted. But that's it--will they spin him? I don't think they will.  They's only a lot o' cuddies, any'ow.\"    No one likes to expose his own ignorance by asking which horse he refers  to as the \"only one in it\"; and the Oracle goes on to deal out some more  wisdom in a loud voice.    \"Billy K---- told me\" (he probably hardly knows Billy K---- by sight)  \"Billy K---- told me that that bay 'orse ran the best mile-an'-a-half  ever done on Randwick yesterday; but I don't give him a chance, for all  that; that's the worst of these trainers. They don't know when their  horses are well--half of 'em.\"    Then a voice comes from behind him. It is that of the thin man, who is  crushed out of sight by the bulk of the Oracle.    \"I think,\" says the thin man, \"that that horse of Flannery's ought to  run well in the Handicap.\"    The Oracle can't stand this sort of thing at all. He gives a snort,  wheels half-round and looks at the speaker. Then he turns back to the  compartment full of people, and says: \"No 'ope.\"    The thin man makes a last effort. \"Well, they backed him last night,  anyhow.\"    \"Who backed 'im?\" says the Oracle.    \"In Tattersall's,\" says the thin man.    \"I'm sure,\" says the Oracle; and the thin man collapses.    On arrival at the course, the Oracle is in great form. Attended by  his string of satellites, he plods from stall to stall staring at the  horses. Their names are printed in big letters on the stalls, but the  Oracle doesn't let that stop his display of knowledge.    \"'Ere's Blue Fire,\" he says, stopping at that animal's stall, and  swinging his race book. \"Good old Blue Fire!\" he goes on loudly, as a  little court collects. \"Jimmy B----\" (mentioning a popular jockey) \"told  me he couldn't have lost on Saturday week if he had only been ridden  different. I had a good stake on him, too, that day. Lor', the races  that has been chucked away on this horse. They will not ride him right.\"    A trainer who is standing by, civilly interposes. \"This isn't Blue  Fire,\" he says. \"Blue Fire's out walking about. This is a two-year-old  filly that's in the stall----\"    \"Well, I can see that, can't I,\" says the Oracle, crushingly. \"You  don't suppose I thought Blue Fire was a mare, did you?\" and he moves off  hurriedly.    \"Now, look here, you chaps,\" he says to his followers at last. \"You wait  here. I want to go and see a few of the talent, and it don't do to have  a crowd with you. There's Jimmy M---- over there now\" (pointing to a  leading trainer). \"I'll get hold of him in a minute. He couldn't tell me  anything with so many about. Just you wait here.\"    He crushes into a crowd that has gathered round the favourite's stall,  and overhears one hard-faced racing man say to another, \"What do you  like?\" to which the other answers, \"Well, either this or Royal Scot. I  think I'll put a bit on Royal Scot.\" This is enough for the Oracle. He  doesn't know either of the men from Adam, or either of the horses from  the great original pachyderm, but the information will do to go on with.  He rejoins his followers, and looks very mysterious.    \"Well, did you hear anything?\" they say.    The Oracle talks low and confidentially.    \"The crowd that have got the favourite tell me they're not afraid of  anything but Royal Scot,\" he says. \"I think we'd better put a bit on  both.\"    \"What did the Royal Scot crowd say?\" asks an admirer deferentially.    \"Oh, they're going to try and win. I saw the stable commissioner, and he  told me they were going to put a hundred on him. "]]]
