Cassylia Casino was the playspot of the nearby cluster of star systems.  It was the first time Jason had seen it, though he knew its type well.  He had spent most of his adult life in casinos like this on other  worlds. The decor differed but they were always the same. Gambling and  socialities in public--and behind the scenes all the private vice you  could afford. Theoretically no-limit games, but that was true only up to  a certain point. When the house was really hurt the honest games stopped  being square and the big winner had to watch his step very carefully.  These were the odds Jason dinAlt had played against countless times  before. He was wary but not very concerned.    The dining room was almost empty and the major-domo quickly rushed to  the side of the relaxed stranger in the richly cut clothes. Jason was  lean and dark, looking more like the bored scion of some rich family  than a professional gambler. This appearance was important and he  cultivated it. The cuisine looked good and the cellar turned out to be  wonderful. He had a professional talk with the sommelier while waiting  for the soup, then settled down to enjoy his meal.    He ate leisurely and the large dining room was filled before he was  through. Watching the entertainment over a long cigar killed some more  time. When he finally went to the gaming rooms they were filled and  active.    Moving slowly around the room he dropped a few thousand credits. He  scarcely noticed how he played, giving more attention to the feel of the  games. The play all seemed honest and none of the equipment was rigged.  That could be changed very quickly, he realized. Usually it wasn't  necessary, house percentage was enough to assure a profit.    Once he saw Kerk out of the corner of his eye but he paid him no  attention. The ambassador was losing small sums steadily at  seven-and-silver and seemed to be impatient. Probably waiting for Jason  to begin playing seriously. He smiled and strolled on slowly.    Jason settled on the dice table as he usually did. It was the surest way  to make small winnings. _And if I feel it tonight I can clean this  casino out!_ That was his secret, the power that won for him  steadily--and every once in a while enabled him to make a killing and  move on quickly before the hired thugs came to get the money back.           *       *       *       *       *    The dice reached him and he threw an eight the hard way. Betting was  light and he didn't push himself, just kept away from the sevens. He  made the point and passed a natural. Then he crapped out and the dice  moved on.    Sitting there, making small automatic bets while the dice went around  the table, he thought about the power. _Funny, after all the years of  work we still don't know much about_ psi. _They can train people a bit,  and improve skills a bit--but that's all._    He was feeling strong tonight, he knew that the money in his pocket gave  him the extra lift that sometimes helped him break through. With his  eyes half closed he picked up the dice--and let his mind gently caress  the pattern of sunken dots. Then they shot out of his hand and he stared  at a seven.    It was there.    Stronger than he had felt it in years. The stiff weight of those  million-credit notes had done it. The world all around was sharp-cut  clear and the dice was completely in his control. He knew to the  tenth-credit how much the other players had in their wallets and was  aware of the cards in the hands of the players behind him.    Slowly, carefully, he built up the stakes.    There was no effort to the dice, they rolled and sat up like trained  dogs. Jason took his time and concentrated on the psychology of the  players and the stick man. It took almost two hours to build his money  on the table to seven hundred thousand credits. Then he caught the stick  man signaling they had a heavy winner. He waited until the hard-eyed man  strolled over to watch the game, then he smiled happily, bet all his  table stakes--and blew it on one roll of the dice. The house man smiled  happily, the stick man relaxed--and out of the corner of his eye Jason  saw Kerk turning a dark purple.    Sweating, pale, his hand trembling ever so slightly, Jason opened the  front of his jacket and pulled out one of the envelopes of new bills.  Breaking the seal with his finger he dropped two of them on the table.    \"Could we have a no-limit game?\" he asked, \"I'd like to--win back some  of my money.\"    The stick man had trouble controlling his smile now, he glanced across  at the house man who nodded a quick _yes_. They had a sucker and they  meant to clean him. He had been playing from his wallet all evening, now  he was cracking into a sealed envelope to try for what he had lost. A  thick envelope too, and probably not his money. Not that the house cared  in the least. To them money had no loyalties. The play went on with the  Casino in a very relaxed mood.    Which was just the way Jason wanted it. He needed to get as deep into  them as he could before someone realized _they_ might be on the losing  end. The rough stuff would start and he wanted to put it off as long as  possible. It would be hard to win smoothly then--and his _psi_ power  might go as quickly as it had come. That had happened before.    He was playing against the house now, the two other players were obvious  shills, and a crowd had jammed solidly around to watch. After losing and  winning a bit he hit a streak of naturals and his pile of gold chips  tottered higher and higher. There was nearly a billion there, he  estimated roughly. The dice were still falling true, though he was  soaked with sweat from the effort. Betting the entire stack of chips he  reached for the dice. The stick man reached faster and hooked them away.    \"House calls for new dice,\" he said flatly.    Jason straightened up and wiped his hands, glad of the instant's relief.  This was the third time the house had changed dice to try and break his  winning streak, it was their privilege. The hard-eyed Casino man opened  his wallet as he had done before and drew out a pair at random.  Stripping off their plastic cover he threw them the length of the table  to Jason. They came up a natural seven and Jason smiled.    When he scooped them up the smile slowly faded. The dice were  transparent, finely made, evenly weighted on all sides--and crooked.    The pigment on the dots of five sides of each die was some heavy metal  compound, probably lead. The sixth side was a ferrous compound. They  would roll true unless they hit a magnetic field--that meant the entire  surface of the table could be magnetized. He could never have spotted  the difference if he hadn't _looked_ at the dice with his mind. But what  could he do about it?    Shaking them slowly he glanced quickly around the table. There was what  he needed. An ashtray with a magnet in its base to hold it to the metal  edge of the table. Jason stopped shaking the dice and looked at them  quizzically, then reached over and grabbed the ashtray. He dropped the  base against his hand.    As he lifted the ashtray there was a concerted gasp from all sides. The  dice were sticking there, upside down, box cars showing.    \"Are these what you call honest dice?\" he asked.    The man who had thrown out the dice reached quickly for his hip pocket.  Jason was the only one who saw what happened next. He was watching that  hand closely, his own fingers near his gun butt. As the man dived into  his pocket a hand reached out of the crowd behind him. From its  square-cut size it could have belonged to only one person. The thick  thumb and index finger clamped swiftly around the house man's wrist,  then they were gone. The man screamed shrilly and held up his arm, his  hand dangling limp as a glove from the broken wrist bones.           *       *       *       *       *    With his flank well protected, Jason could go on with the game. \"The old  dice if you don't mind,\" he said quietly.    Dazedly the stick man pushed them over. Jason shook quickly and rolled.  Before they hit the table he realized he couldn't control them--the  transient _psi_ power had gone.    End over end they turned. And faced up seven.    Counting the chips as they were pushed over to him he added up a bit  under two billion credits. They would be winning that much if he left  the game now--but it wasn't the three billion that Kerk needed. Well, it  would have to be enough. As he reached for the chips he caught Kerk's  eye across the table and the other man shook his head in a steady _no_.    \"Let it ride,\" Jason said wearily, \"one more roll.\"    He breathed on the dice, polished them on his cuff, and wondered how he  had ever gotten into this spot. Billions riding on a pair of dice. That  was as much as the annual income of some planets. The only reason there  _could_ be stakes like that was because the planetary government had a  stake in the Casino. He shook as long as he could, reaching for the  control that wasn't there--then let fly.    Everything else had stopped in the Casino and people were standing on  tables and chairs to watch. There wasn't a sound from that large crowd.  The dice bounced back from the board with a clatter loud in the silence  and tumbled over the cloth.    A five and a one. Six. He still had to make his point. Scooping up the  dice Jason talked to them, mumbled the ancient oaths that brought luck  and threw again.    It took five throws before he made the six.    The crowd echoed his sigh and their voices rose quickly. He wanted to  stop, take a deep breath, but he knew he couldn't. Winning the money was  only part of the job--they now had to get away with it. It had to look  casual. A waiter was passing with a tray of drinks. Jason stopped him  and tucked a hundred-credit note in his pocket.    \"Drinks are on me,\" he shouted while he pried the tray out of the  "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/28402"],[0,"The Sexual Life of the Child (#2)"],[1,"dealing with sexual topics published  during recent years is by no means small; but although some of the works  in question have added considerably to our knowledge, the advance of  sexual science as a whole has not been proportionate to the extent of  these contributions. The reason is that insufficient attention has been  paid to special problems; and the majority of writers have either  repeated what has already been said by another, in identical or  equivalent words, or else they have published comprehensive treatises on  the sexual life, which may, perhaps, be of interest to the laity, but do  not in any way enrich our science. Further advances in our knowledge of  the sexual life can be effected only by the investigation of special  problems. Such work is, indeed, laborious; but that it is also fruitful,  has been clearly shown, not only in the first instance by von  Krafft-Ebing, but more recently, above all, by Havelock Ellis, whose  special studies have contributed more to the advance of sexual science  than the work of dozens of other writers.    The recognition of the need for specialised investigations has led me,  in this province of scientific work as in other departments, to devote  myself to the elucidation of certain definite problems. For several  reasons I determined to study the sexual life of the child. In the first  place, I believe that an advance in our knowledge of the sexual life of  the child will indirectly enrich our knowledge also of the sexual life  of the adult. In order to understand the sexual life, the gradual  development of that life must be recognised, and for this purpose it is  essential that we should study the sexual life of the child. Moreover,  the modern movement in favour of the sexual enlightenment of young  persons renders indispensable the possession of precise knowledge of the  sexuality of the child; and such knowledge is no less necessary to all  instructors of youth, especially to those to whom the psychical life of  children is a matter of concern. Judges and magistrates also, as we  shall see in the seventh chapter, are very greatly interested in this  matter: it is, in fact, hardly open to question that erroneous legal  decisions and the unjust condemnation of reputed criminals can only be  avoided by giving our judicial authorities the opportunity of obtaining  sound knowledge concerning the sexual life of children in all its modes  of manifestation. By all these considerations I have been induced to  study the problem of the sexuality of children from the most widely  different points of view. Although other writers, such as Freud, Bell,  and Koetscher, have contributed certain data towards the solution of  these questions, no comprehensive study of the subject has hitherto been  attempted. My material does not consist only of the reports of patients.  In addition, in order to avoid a one-sided dependence upon pathological  considerations, I have accepted with greater confidence the reports  concerning the sexual life of children which I have received from  healthy individuals, both men and women. I take this opportunity of  tendering my most heartfelt thanks to all those who have assisted me in  this manner.    ALBERT MOLL.
