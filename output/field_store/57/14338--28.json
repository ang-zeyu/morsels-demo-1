However, that the ship attacked was the American steamer       Cushing is possible, considering the time and place of the       occurrences. Nevertheless, the German Government accordingly       requests of the American Government that it communicate to       the German Government the material which was submitted for       judgment, in order that, with this as a basis, a further       position can be taken in the matter.         The undersigned leaves it to the Ambassador to bring the       foregoing to the immediate attention of his Government, and       takes this opportunity to renew to him the assurance of his       most distinguished consideration.         VON JAGOW,       Minister for Foreign Affairs.]    In the case of the sinking of the English steamer Falaba, the  commander of the German submarine had the intention of allowing  passengers and crew ample opportunity to save themselves.    It was not until the captain disregarded the order to lay to and took  to flight, sending up rocket signals for help, that the German  commander ordered the crew and passengers by signals and megaphone to  leave the ship within ten minutes. As a matter of fact he allowed them  twenty-three minutes and did not fire the torpedo until suspicious  steamers were hurrying to the aid of the Falaba.    With regard to the loss of life when the British passenger steamer  Lusitania was sunk, the German Government has already expressed its  deep regret to the neutral Governments concerned that nationals of  those countries lost their lives on that occasion. The Imperial  Government must state for the rest the impression that certain  important facts most directly connected with the sinking of the  Lusitania may have escaped the attention of the Government of the  United States. It therefore considers it necessary in the interest of  the clear and full understanding aimed at by either Government  primarily to convince itself that the reports of the facts which are  before the two Governments are complete and in agreement.    The Government of the United States proceeds on the assumption that  the Lusitania is to be considered as an ordinary unarmed merchant  vessel. The Imperial Government begs in this connection to point out  that the Lusitania was one of the largest and fastest English commerce  steamers, constructed with Government funds as auxiliary cruisers, and  is expressly included in the navy list published by British Admiralty.  It is moreover known to the Imperial Government from reliable  information furnished by its officials and neutral passengers that for  some time practically all the more valuable English merchant vessels  have been provided with guns, ammunition and other weapons, and  reinforced with a crew specially practiced in manning guns. According  to reports at hand here, the Lusitania when she left New York  undoubtedly had guns on board which were mounted under decks and  masked.    The Imperial Government furthermore has the honor to direct the  particular attention of the American Government to the fact that the  British Admiralty by a secret instruction of February of this year  advised the British merchant marine not only to seek protection behind  neutral flags and markings, but even when so disguised to attack  German submarines by ramming them. High rewards have been offered by  the British Government as a special incentive for the destruction of  the submarines by merchant vessels, and such rewards have already been  paid out. In view of these facts, which are satisfactorily known to  it, the Imperial Government is unable to consider English merchant  vessels any longer as \"undefended territory\" in the zone of maritime  war designated by the Admiralty Staff of the Imperial German Navy, the  German commanders are consequently no longer in a position to observe  the rules of capture otherwise usual and with which they invariably  complied before this. Lastly, the Imperial Government must specially  point out that on her last trip the Lusitania, as on earlier  occasions, had Canadian troops and munitions on board, including no  less than 5,400 cases of ammunition destined for the destruction of  brave German soldiers who are fulfilling with self-sacrifice and  devotion their duty in the service of the Fatherland. The German  Government believes that it acts in just self-defense when it seeks to  protect the lives of its soldiers by destroying ammunition destined  for the enemy with the means of war at its command. The English  steamship company must have been aware of the dangers to which  passengers on board the Lusitania were exposed under the  circumstances. In taking them on board in spite of this the company  quite deliberately tried to use the lives of American citizens as  protection for the ammunition carried, and violated the clear  provisions of American laws which expressly prohibit, and provide  punishment for, the carrying of passengers on ships which have  explosives on board. The company thereby wantonly caused the death of  so many passengers. According to the express report of the submarine  commander concerned, which is further confirmed by all other reports,  there can be no doubt that the rapid sinking of the Lusitania was  primarily due to the explosion of the cargo of ammunition caused by  the torpedo. Otherwise, in all human probability, the passengers of  the Lusitania would have been saved.    The Imperial Government holds the facts recited above to be of  sufficient importance to recommend them to a careful examination by  the American Government. The Imperial Government begs to reserve a  final statement of its position with regard to the demands made in  connection with the sinking of the Lusitania until a reply is received  from the American Government, and believes that it should recall here  that it took note with satisfaction of the proposals of good offices  submitted by the American Government in Berlin and London with a view  to paving the way for a modus vivendi for the conduct of maritime war  between Germany and Great Britain. The Imperial Government furnished  at that time ample evidence of its good will by its willingness to  consider these proposals. The realization of these proposals failed,  as is known, on account of their rejection by the Government of Great  Britain.    The undersigned requests his Excellency the Ambassador to bring the  above to the knowledge of the American Government and avails himself  of the opportunity to renew, &c.    VON JAGOW.          MR. BRYAN'S RESIGNATION      WASHINGTON, June 8, 1915.    My Dear Mr. President:    It is with sincere regret that I have reached the conclusion that I  should return to you the commission of Secretary of State, with which  you honored me at the beginning of your Administration.    Obedient to your sense of duty and actuated by the highest motives,  you have prepared for transmission to the German Government a note in  which I cannot join without violating what I deem to be an obligation  to my country, and the issue involved is of such moment that to remain  a member of the Cabinet would be as unfair to you as it would be to  the cause which is nearest my heart; namely, the prevention of war.    I, therefore, respectfully tender my resignation, to take effect when  the note is sent, unless you prefer an earlier hour.    Alike desirous of reaching a peaceful solution of the problems,  arising out of the use of submarines against merchantmen, we find  ourselves differing irreconcilably as to the methods which should be  employed.    It falls to your lot to speak officially for the nation; I consider it  to be none the less my duty to endeavor as a private citizen to  promote the end which you have in view by means which you do not feel  at liberty to use.[2]    [Footnote 2: In Washington dispatches of June 8, 1915, Mr. Bryan was  reported to have said at his home, when told of the formal  announcement of his resignation:         In view of the announcement of my resignation, I will say       that letters being made public therewith state my reasons,       but I will have a more complete statement that will be given       out when the American reply to the German note is sent,       which probably will be tomorrow.         My resignation takes effect as soon as the note has been       forwarded.]    In severing the intimate and pleasant relations which have existed  between us during the past two years, permit me to acknowledge the  profound satisfaction which it has given me to be associated with you  in the important work which has come before the State Department, and  to thank you for the courtesies extended.    With the heartiest good wishes for your personal welfare and for the  success of your Administration, I am, my dear Mr. President, very  truly yours,    W.J. BRYAN.    [Illustration: THE HON. WILLIAM JENNINGS BRYAN    Formerly Secretary of State of the United States    (_Photo from Bain News Agency_)]      THE PRESIDENT TO SECRETARY BRYAN.    Washington, June 8, 1915.    My Dear Mr. Bryan:    I accept your resignation only because you insist upon its acceptance;  and I accept it with much more than deep regret, with a feeling of  personal sorrow.    Our two years of close association have been very delightful to me.  Our judgments have accorded in practically every matter of official  duty and of public policy until now; your support of the work and  purposes of the Administration has been generous and loyal beyond  praise; your devotion to the duties of your great office and your  eagerness to take advantage of every great opportunity for service it  offered have been an example to the rest of us; you have earned our  affectionate admiration and friendship. Even now we are not separated  in the object we seek, but only in the method by which we seek it.    It is for these reasons my feeling about your retirement from the"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/26378"],[0,"The Care of Books (#2)"],[1,"CHAPTER IX.      Private libraries.
