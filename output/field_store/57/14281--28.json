Then there are the mountains, which are everywhere;  for, with the exception of Spain, Norway is the most mountainous  country in Europe. And on their summits lie vast fields of eternal  snow, with glaciers pushing down into the green valleys, or even into  the ocean itself. Again, from these mountains flow down rivers and  streams, now forming magnificent waterfalls as they leap over the  edge of the lofty plateau, now rushing wildly over their rock-strewn  torrent beds, until they reach the lake, which, thus gathering the  waters, send them on again in one wide river to the fjord.    Such things lend themselves to create scenery which cannot fail  to charm, and in one day in Norway you may see them all. Take,  for instance, the famous view of the Naerodal from Stalheim, a place  which every visitor to Western Norway knows well. Probably nowhere  in the world is there anything to approach it in grandeur, for not  only are there the great mountains forming the sides of the actual  valley in the foreground, but away beyond appears a succession of  other mountains, stretching far across the Sogne Fjord, even to the  snowy peaks of Jotunheim.    People who live in such a land must needs be proud of it, and the  descendants of the Vikings believe that there exists in the world no  fairer country than their beloved Norge. [1] Maybe they are not far  wrong. But these Northern people are not numerous, and they are not  forced, for want of space, to spoil their landscapes by studding the  country-side with little red-brick cottages, for all Norway contains  not one-half the number of inhabitants found in London. Under such  circumstances the feeling of freedom is great, and the Norwegians  claim that, as a nation, they are the freest of the free. Recent  events would seem to justify the claim. Only the other day Norway  dissolved the Union with Sweden with little difficulty, and of her  own free-will cast herself loose from the light fetters with which,  for nearly a century, she considered that she had been bound.    With Norway time has dealt kindly. In modern ages war has not  ravaged her lands. The oldest living Norseman was born too late to  fight for his country, and it is to be hoped that his grandsons and  great-grandsons may continue to live in ignorance of the horrors which  war entails. Yet are they all prepared to take up arms in defence  of hearth and home, for each able-bodied man serves his time as a  soldier, and doubtless, if occasion should arise, would prove to the  world that the old Viking spirit within him was still alive.    It is, however, the sense of restfulness pervading everything that  is Norway's charm, and even the ordinary bustle of life is unknown  outside the towns. In the summer the beaten tracks of the country  are practically in the hands of the foreign visitors, whose money  helps not a little to support many a Norse family. In the winter  things are different, as, except perhaps in Christiania, very few  foreigners are to be met with, and the Norwegians live their own lives.    The towns are neither numerous nor large, and, with a few exceptions,  are situated on the sea-coast. Perhaps a quarter of the whole  population of Norway is to be found in the towns, the remainder  consisting of country-folk, who live on their farms. What we term  villages barely exist, and the nearest approach to them is a group  of farms with a church in the neighbourhood.    Christiania, the capital of the country, is the largest town, and other  towns of importance are Bergen, Trondhjem, Stavanger, Frederikstad,  Toensberg, and Christiansand, all busy seaports and picturesquely  situated. But the interest of a country such as Norway does not lie  in the towns, which, with their wide streets, stately buildings,  well-stocked shops, hotels, restaurants, places of amusement, and  crowded dwellings, do not differ very greatly from other European  towns, and a townsman's life in his town is much the same all over  the civilized world.    Town-dwellers in all Norway number no more than the inhabitants of  Manchester, and though force of circumstance necessitates their living  in the towns, their thoughts are ever of the country--of the fjeld,  the fjord, the forest, the mountain lake, or the salmon river. In the  summer nothing pleases them better than to tramp, with knapsack on  back, for days on end, in the wilderness of the mountains, obtaining  shelter for the night at some out-of-the-way mountain farm or at one  of the snug little huts of the Norwegian Tourist Club. In the winter  they have their sleighs, snow-shoes, toboggans, and skates to assist  them in taking air and exercise, and in a Norwegian winter one does  not live in a state of uncertainty as to whether the ice will bear or  the snow be still lying on the ground when one wakes up in the morning.    So comfortable has travelling in Norway been made for foreigners that  there is no difficulty in going anywhere. There is a railway from  Christiania to Bergen, and another from Christiania to Trondhjem. There  are regular steamers on all the fjords and along the coast, even up  to the North Cape and beyond. Wherever there are roads there is a  well-appointed service of vehicles and posting-stations, and wherever  anyone is likely to go by steamer, road, or rail there are hotels.            CHAPTER III    THE PEOPLE AND THEIR INDUSTRIES      The greater number of the people are country-folk, who gain a  living by farming, timber-working, or, when living near the sea,  by fishing. Then there are a certain number of men who are soldiers  by profession, and more still who are sailors--not fighting sailors,  but serving on board the 8,000 merchant vessels which Norway possesses.    Everyone who lives in a Norwegian town is connected one way or  another with some sort of trade or profession; and, of course, in  the seaports there are always ships coming and going, unloading and  loading, and so providing plenty of work for a great many men. In  the towns also there are, as in every civilized town, men who follow  regular professions--clergymen, merchants, bankers, lawyers, doctors,  hotel-keepers, shop-keepers, and others, as well as Government  officials, learned professors, literary men, and artists.    As a nation Norway cannot be considered wealthy, but the fact that she  employs so many ships for trading purposes is perhaps a proof that she  is fairly prosperous. There are few really rich Norwegians, and still  fewer who are able to live as independent gentlemen on their estates;  no man can claim the right to be called noble, for the nobility of  the country was abolished by law nearly a century ago, and since  then equality has been the birthright of every Norseman. But no one  can prevent money made in trade gradually finding its way into the  pockets of a few capable men of business, and thus class distinctions  must be created. The majority of the Norwegians, however, are content  to work and earn sufficient to maintain themselves and their families  in fairly comfortable circumstances, and fortunately the products of  the country enable them to do so.    The forests, covering as they do almost one-fourth of the area of  Norway, are of immense value, and the timber trade is a source of  income to a great number of the people. Much of it, of course, is used  in the country itself, as the houses and bridges are mostly built of  wood; but there is plenty left to be exported to England and other  foreign countries, as anyone who visits the ports in the South of  Norway can judge for himself. Between Christiansand and Christiania,  for instance, one may see enormous stores of timber awaiting shipment,  and one wonders how it will ever be shipped. Then, travelling among  the forest-clad mountains, one finds the woodman busy with his axe,  and the great bare tree-trunks being hauled down to the banks of the  torrent or river, so as to float on the waters to the low country,  and thence even to the sea-coast. Again, on lakes like the Randsfjord,  the sight presented by the gathered logs, which have floated down  from the mountains, and which are being rafted for their final voyage,  is an extraordinary one. Acres and acres of floating timber cover the  end of the lake, and the massive trunks are packed so close that you  might wander about on them at your will for hours.    But it is not only timber in a raw state that does so much for the  prosperity of Norway, for a great trade is done also in matches as  well as in wood-pulp. The latter is a comparatively modern industry,  and its development has been rapid. Anyone who visits Christiania  and has the opportunity of taking the little town of Hoenefos in his  travels, should not fail to pay a visit to the pulping works. It is  said that in Chicago one may see a herd of swine driven in at the  front gate of a factory and brought out at another gate in the form  of sausages. At Hoenefos trees go into the works and come out as paper,  or very nearly so.    The waterfall, which gave a name to the place, is at the meeting  of two rivers--one flowing from Spirillen Lake and the other from  the Randsfjord, and was at one time beautiful. Now, however, its  picturesqueness is marred by the presence of a barn-like structure  containing the pulping works, while the fall itself is utilized  to drive the machinery. And, it must be confessed, all this has  been brought about by an Englishman, for here at Hoenefos is made  the paper upon which is printed _Lloyd's Weekly_ and the _Daily  Chronicle_. Neither is the fact concealed, but rather boasted of in  large letters on the outside of the barn. But Norway can well spare  this one scrap from its storehouse of scenery, and the works find  regular employment for upwards of a hundred Norwegians.    The process of pulping is simplicity itself; the trees are felled in  the forests on the hillsides close by, and sawn into blocks.

II    ENGINEERING OPPORTUNITIES      The writer can best illustrate the opportunities for young men which  exist in engineering by a little story. The story is true in every  particular. Nor is the case itself exceptional. Men occupying high  places everywhere in engineering, did they but tell their story, would  repeat in substance what is set forth below. More than any other  profession to-day, engineering holds out opportunities for young men  possessing the requisite \"will to success\" and the physical stamina  necessary to carry them forward to the goal. Opportunities in any walk  of life are not all dead--not all in the past. A young man to-day can go  as far as he wills. He can go farther on less capital invested in  engineering than in any other profession--that's all.    The young man's name was Smith. He was one of seven children--not the  seventh son, either--in a poor family. At the age of sixteen he went to  work in overalls on a section of railroad as a helper--outdoor, rough  work. At seventeen he was transferred to the roundhouse; at nineteen he  apprenticed himself to the machinist trade. Engineering? He did not know  what it was, really. Merely he saw his way clear to earning a livelihood  and went after it. He was miserably educated. His knowledge of  mathematics embraced arithmetic up to fractions, at which point it faded  off into blissful \"nothingness\"--as our New-Thoughtists say. But he had  an inquiring mind and a proper will to succeed. While serving his three  years in the shop he bought a course in a correspondence school and  studied nights, taking up, among other things, the subject of mechanical  drafting. When twenty-two years of age he applied for, and got, a  position as draftsman in a small company developing a motorcycle. He was  well on his way upward.    He spent a year with this company. He learned much of value to him not  only about mathematics, but about engineering as a whole as well. One  day he decided that the field was restricted--at least, too much so for  him--and he left and went with a Westinghouse organization in  Pittsburgh. His salary was in the neighborhood of a hundred and ten  dollars a month. He remained with the company two years as a designer,  and then, having saved up sufficient funds to meet his needs, went to  college, taking special work--physics and chemistry and mathematics. He  remained in school two years. When he came out, instead of returning to  the drafting-room and the theoretical end of the work, he donned  overalls once more and went to work in the shop as an erecting man. Two  years afterward he was chief operating engineer in a small cement-plant  in the Southwest, his salary being three thousand dollars a year. A year  of this and he returned East, at a salary of four thousand dollars a  year, as operating engineer of a larger plant. Then came a better offer,  with one of the largest, if not the very largest, steel-plants in the  country, as superintendent of power, at a salary of five thousand  dollars a year. When the war broke out, or rather when this country  became involved in the war, my friend Smith, at a salary of ten thousand  dollars a year, became associated with a staff of engineers brought  together into a corporation manufacturing shells. And all before he was  barely in his thirties!    A young man still, what lies ahead of him can readily be surmised. Smith  will follow engineering on salary until he is probably forty, when he  will enter upon a consulting practice, and at fifty retire with  sufficient money to keep him in comfort the remainder of his days. Nor  will he be an exception, as I have stated in the opening paragraph. The  profession is crowded with men who have worked up from equally humble  beginnings. Indeed, one of the foremost efficiency engineers in the  country to-day began as an apprentice in a foundry, while another, fully  as well known in efficiency work, began life in the United States navy  as a machinist's mate. Automobile engineers, whose names, many of them,  are household words, in particular have gone big in the profession and  from very obscure beginnings. It is not stretching the obvious to say  that the majority of these men, had they entered upon any other work,  would never have been heard from nor have attained to their present  wealth and affluence. Smith was just one of many in a profession  offering liberal opportunities. The opportunities still exist and in  just as large a proportion as they ever existed. It remains but for the  young man to decide. The profession itself, almost, will take care of  him afterward.    However, not all of our engineers have gone upward by the overalls  route. Nor is it at all necessary to do this in order to attain to  success. The high-school graduate, entering a college of engineering,  has an equal chance. Some maintain that he has a better chance. Certain  it is that he is better qualified to cope with the heavier theoretical  problems which come up every day in the average engineer's work. There  is a place for him, side by side with the practical man, and his  knowledge will be everywhere respected and sought. But a combination of  the theoretical and the practical, as has frequently been declared,  makes for the complete engineer. Some get the practical side first and  the theoretical side later; some get the theoretical side first and the  practical side later. It matters little--save only that he who gets the  practical side first is earning his way while getting it, while the man  who goes to college is in the majority of cases being supported from  outside sources while getting what he wants. But in the end it balances.  Merely, the \"full\" engineer must have both. Having both, he has,  literally, the world within his grasp. For engineering is--to  repeat--the adapting of discoveries in science and art to the uses of  mankind. And both art and science reflect and are drawn from Mother  Nature.    There is still a great scarcity of engineers. All branches feel the  need--civil, mechanical, mining, chemical, automotive, electrical--the  call goes out. It is a call just now, owing to the vast reconstruction  period confronting the world, lifted in strident voice. Engineers  everywhere are needed, which in part accounts for the liberal salaries  offered for experienced men. The demand greatly exceeds the supply, and  gives promise of exceeding it for a number of years to come. All  manufacturing-plants, all mining enterprises, of which of both there are  thousands upon thousands, utilize each from one to many hundreds of  engineers. Some plants make use of three or four different  kinds--mechanical, civil, electrical, industrial--some only one. But not  a plant of any size but that has need for at least one engineer, and  engineers are scarce. Therefore opportunities are ample.    To the young man seeking a profession, provided he be of a certain  type--possessed of certain inherent qualities, the nature of which I  shall set forth in the following chapter--engineering offers  satisfactory money returns and--more satisfactory still--a satisfactory  life. The work is creative from beginning to end; it has to do  frequently with movement--always a source of delight to mankind; a  source having its beginnings in earliest infancy, and it is essentially  a work of service. To build a bridge, to design an automatic machine, to  locate and bring to the surface earth's wealth in minerals--surely this  is service of a most gratifying kind.    And it pays. The arts rarely pay; science always pays. And engineering  being a science, a science in the pursuit of which also man is offered  opportunities for the exercise of his creative instincts, like art, is  therefore doubly gratifying as a life's work. I know--and it will bear  repeating--no other profession that holds so much of bigness and of  fullness of life generally. Engineers themselves reflect it. Usually  robust, always active, generally optimistic, engineers as a group swing  through life--and have swung through life from the beginnings of the  profession--without thought of publicity, for instance, or need or  desire for it. Their work alone engrossed their minds. It was enough--it  is enough--and more. And that which is sufficient unto a man is Nirvana  unto him--if he but knew it. Engineers seem to know it.          III    THE ENGINEERING TYPE      It is becoming more and more an accepted fact that engineers, or  physicians, or lawyers--like our poets--are born and not made. I believe  this to be true. Educators generally are thinking seriously along these  lines, with the result that vocational advisers are springing up,  especially in industrial circles, to establish eventually yet another  profession. Instinct leads young men to enter upon certain callings,  unless turned off by misguided parents or guardians, and as a general  thing the hunch works out successfully. Philosophers from time  immemorial, including Plato and Emerson, have written of this still,  small voice within, and have urged that it be heeded. The thing is  instinct--cumulative yearnings within man of thousands of his  ancestors--and to disobey it is to fling defiance at Nature herself.  Personally, I believe that when this law becomes more generally  understood there will be fewer failures decorating park benches in our  cities and cracker-boxes in our country stores.    The profession of engineering, therefore, has its type. You may be of  this type or you may not. The type is quite pronounced, however, and you  need not go wrong in your decision. All professions and all trades have  their types. Steel-workers--those fearless young men who balance  skilfully on a girder, frequently hundreds of feet in the air--are not  to be"]]]
