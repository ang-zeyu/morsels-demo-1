The rest of us will  eat fresh native foods prepared by Jrann-Pttt.\"    \"But why,\" Miss Anspacher interrupted as she emerged from the airlock  with a large cast-iron skillet, \"should you think Jrann-Pttt wants to  poison us?\"    Both men rose from their stools. \"Stands to reason he'd consider us his  enemies, Miss Anspacher,\" the captain said. \"After all, we--as a group,  that is--captured him.\"    \"Hired him,\" Professor Bernardi contradicted. \"I've telepathically  arranged to pay him an adequate salary. In goods, of course; I don't  suppose our money would be of much use to him. And I think he's rather  glad of the chance to hang around and observe us conveniently.\"    \"Observe us!\" Greenfield exclaimed. \"You mean he's spying out the land  for an attack? Let's prepare our defenses at once!\"    \"I doubt if that's what he has in mind,\" Professor Bernardi said  judiciously.    \"He may be staying because he wants to be near me,\" Miss Anspacher  blurted. Overcome by this unmaidenly admission, she reddened and rushed  from them, calling, \"Yoo-hoo, Jrann-Pttt! Here is the frying pan!\" Algol  woke up instantly and followed her. \"Frying\" was one of the more  important words in his vocabulary.    Captain Greenfield stared across the clearing after them, then turned  back to Bernardi with a frown. \"I don't like to see one of our girls  mixed up with a lizard--and a foreign lizard at that.\" But his face too  clearly betrayed a personal resentment.    \"Don't tell me you have a--a fondness for Miss Anspacher, Captain,\"  Professor Bernardi exclaimed, genuinely surprised. Undeniably Miss  Anspacher--although no longer in her first youth--was a handsome woman,  but he would not have expected her somewhat cerebral type to appeal to  the captain. On the other hand, she was the only unattached woman in the  party and they were a long way from home.    Greenfield picked a fleck of dried violet mud from the side of the ship  and avoided Bernardi's eye. \"One of the reasons I came along,\" he said  almost bashfully. \"Thought I'd have the chance to be alone with her now  and again and impress her with, with....\"    \"Your sterling qualities?\" Bernardi suggested.    The captain flashed him a glance of mingled gratitude and resentment.  \"And now this damned lizard has to come along!\"    \"Cheer up, Captain,\" said the professor. \"I'll back you against a lizard  any time.\"           *       *       *       *       *    Although the long twilight of Venus had deepened into night and it could  never really be cool there by terrestrial standards, the temperature was  almost comfortable. Everything was quite black, except for the pallid  purple campfire glowing through the darkness; the clouds that  perpetually covered the surface of the planet prevented even the light  of the stars from reaching it.    \"Tell me more about the cross-versus the parallel-cousin relationships  in your culture, Jrann-Pttt,\" Miss Anspacher breathed, wriggling her  camp stool closer to the saurian's. \"Anthropology is a great hobby of  mine, you know. How do your people feel about exogamy?\"    \"I'm afraid I'm rather exhausted, dear lady,\" he said, using one arm to  mask a yawn, and one to surreptitiously wave away the saurian head that  was peering out of the underbrush. \"I shouldn't like to give a scientist  like yourself any misinformation that might become a matter of record.\"    \"Of course not,\" she murmured. \"You're so considerate.\"           *       *       *       *       *    A pale face appeared in the firelight like some weird creature of  darkness. Terrestrial and extraterrestrial both started. \"Miss  Anspacher,\" the captain growled, \"I'd like to lock up the ship, so if  you wouldn't mind turning in--\"    Miss Anspacher pouted. \"You've interrupted such an interesting  conversation. And I don't see why you have to lock up the ship. After  all, the night is three hundred and eighty-five hours long. We don't  sleep all that time and it would be a shame to be cooped up.\"    \"I'm going to try to rig up some floodlights,\" Greenfield explained  stiffly, \"so we won't be caught like this again. Nobody bothered to tell  me the day equals thirty-two of ours, so that half of it would be  night.\"    \"Then I won't see you for almost two weeks of our time, Jrann-Pttt? Are  you sure you wouldn't like to spend the rest of the night in our ship?  Plenty of room, you know.\"    \"No, thank you, dear lady. The jungle is my natural habitat. I should  feel stultified by walls and a ceiling. Don't worry--I shan't run away.\"    \"Oh, I'm not worried,\" Miss Anspacher said coyly, throwing a stick of  wood on the fire.    \"Small riddance if he does.\"    \"Captain Greenfield!\"    That part of the captain's face not concealed by his piratical black  beard turned red. \"Well, if he can read our minds, he knows damn well  what I'm thinking, anyway, so why be hypocritical about it?\"    \"That's right--he is a telepath, isn't he?\" Miss Anspacher's face grew  even redder than the captain's. \"I forgot he.... It _is_ getting late. I  really must go. Good night, Jrann-Pttt.\"    \"Good night, dear lady.\" The saurian bowed low over her hand.    Leaning on the captain's brawny arm, Miss Anspacher ploughed through the  mud to the ship, followed by the mosquito-bat and Algol, who had been  toasting themselves more or less companionably at the fire. The door to  the airlock clanged behind all four of them.           *       *       *       *       *    The other saurian's head appeared again from the bush. _Jrann-Pttt_, the  insistent thought came, _shall I rescue you now_?    _Why, Dfar-Lll? I am not a prisoner. I'm quite free to come and go  as I please. But let's get away from the strangers' ship while we  communicate. They do have a certain amount of low-grade perception and  might be able to sense the presence of another personality. At any rate,  they might look out of a port and see you._    Keeping the illuminator on low beam, Dfar-Lll led the way through the  bushes. _Seems to me you're going to an awful lot of trouble just to get  zoo specimens_, the youngster protested, disentangling its arms from the  embrace of an amorous vine. _There's really no reason for carrying on  the work since Lieutenant Merglyt-Ruuu ... passed on._    Jrann-Pttt sat down on a fallen log and, tucking up his graceful tail,  signaled his junior to join him. _In the event that we do decide to  return to base, some handsome specimens might serve to offset the  lieutenant's demise._    _Return to base? But I thought we were...._    _We haven't found swamp life pleasant, have we? After all, there's no  real reason why we shouldn't go back. Is it our fault that Merglyt-Ruuu  happened to meet with a fatal accident?_    _We-ell ... but will the commandant see it that way?_    _On the other hand, if we don't go back, wouldn't it be a good idea to  attach ourselves to an expedition that, no matter how alien, is better  equipped for survival than we? And carrying out our original purpose  seemed the best way of getting to meet these strangers informally, as it  were._    _They are unquestionably intelligent life-forms then?_    _After a fashion._ Jrann-Pttt yawned and rose. _But why are we sitting  here? Let's start back to our camp. We will be able to converse more  comfortably._    They made their way through the jungle--now walking, now wading where  the mud became water. Small creatures with hardly any thoughts scurried  before them as they went.    _The commandant may have already made contact with their rulers_,  Dfar-Lll suggested, springing forward to illuminate the way. _In that  case, we couldn't hope to remain undiscovered for long._    _Oh, these creatures are not Venusians. There's no intelligent life  here. They hail from the third planet of this system and, according to  their thoughts, this is the only vessel that was capable of traversing  interplanetary space. So we needn't worry about extradition treaties or  any other official annoyances._    _If they're friendly, why didn't you spend the night in their ship? It  certainly looks more comfortable than our collapsible moslak--which, by  the way, collapsed while you were gone. I hope we'll be able to put it  up again ourselves. I must say this for the lieutenant--he was good at  that sort of thing._    Jrann-Pttt made a gesture of distaste. _He was unfortunately good at  other things, too. But let's not discuss him. I'm not staying with the  strangers because I want to pick up one or two little things--mostly  some of our food to serve them. I used up all the supplies in my pack  and I want them to think we're living off the land. They believe me to  be a primitive and it's best that they should until I decide just how  I'm going to make most efficient use of them. Besides, I didn't want to  leave you alone._    The younger saurian sniffed skeptically.           *       *       *       *       *    \"Honestly, Pitt,\" Mrs. Bernardi said, keeping to leeward of the  tablecloth the lizard-man was efficiently shaking out of the airlock,  \"I've never had a--an employee as competent as you.\" But the word she  had in mind, of course, was \"servant.\" \"I do wish you'd come back to  Earth with us.\"    \"Perhaps you would compel me to come?\" he suggested, as Algol and the  mosquito-bat entered into hot competition to catch the crumbs before  they sank into the purple ooze.    \"Oh, no! We'd want you to come as our guest--our friend.\" _Naturally_,  her thoughts ran, _a house guest would be expected to help with the  washing up and lend a hand with the cooking--and, of course, we wouldn't  have to pay him. Though my husband, I suppose, would requisition him as  a specimen._    _I fully intend to go to Earth with them_, Jrann-Pttt mused, _but  certainly not in that capacity. Nor would I care to be a specimen. I  must formulate some concrete plan._"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/31732"],[0,"The Sex Side of Life: An Explanation for Young People (#2)"],[1,"mind, and often you don't feel quite like talking  about it freely, even to your father and mother. Sometimes it is  easier to talk with your best friends, because they are your own age,  and are beginning to have these new feelings too.    But remember that young people don't know nearly so much about it as  older people do, and that the older ones really want to help you with  their experience and advice; and yet, they, like you, often feel  rather embarrassed themselves and don't know how to go about it I  suppose it is because it is all so very personal and still remains  somewhat mysterious, in spite of all that people know about it.    If our bodies were just like machines, then we could learn about them  and manage them quite scientifically as we do automobiles, but they  are not like that. They are more than machines that have to be  supplied with fuel (food) and kept clean and oiled (by bathing,  exercise and sleep). They are the homes of our souls and our  feelings, and that makes all the difference in the world in the way  we act, and it makes what we have to learn, not limited to science  only, but it has to include more difficult and complicated things  like psychology and morality.    Maybe I can't make this article help you, but I remember so well what  I wanted to know and how I felt when I was young that I am now going  to try. And I will tell you to start out with that there is a great  deal that nobody knows yet, in spite of the fact that the human race  has been struggling thousands of years to learn.    Life itself is still a mystery, especially human life. Human life, in  many respects, is like plant and animal life, but in many ways it is  entirely different, and the ways in which it is different are almost  more important for us to think about than the ways in which it is  similar. In all life, except in the very lowest forms, new life is  created by the coming together, in a very close and special way, of  the male and female elements. You have studied at school about the  plants and you probably have observed certain of the animals, so you  know something about what this means if you do not understand it  thoroughly.    But what you want to know most of all is just how it is with human  beings. You want to know just what this coming together is, how it is  done, how it starts the new life, the baby, and how the baby is born.  You want to understand the wonderful sex organs, that are different  in men and women, what each part is for and how it works.    If you feel very curious and excited and shy about it, don't let  yourself be a bit worried or ashamed. Your feelings are quite  natural, and most everybody else has felt just the same way at your  age. Remember that strong feelings are immensely valuable to us. All  we need to do is to steer them in the right direction and keep them  well balanced and proportioned.    Now in order to understand something of why this subject stirs us so,  we must notice in what ways we human beings are _different_ from the  plants and animals. About the lowest form of life is the amoeba. It  looks like a little lump of jelly, and it produces its young by  merely separating itself in two. One part drifts off from the other  part and each becomes a separate live being. There is no male and no  female and they didn't _know_ they were doing it. In the plants a  higher stage of development is reached: there is the male and the  female and they join together, not by coming to each other, or  because they _know_ they belong together, but quite unconsciously,  with the aid of the bees and other insects and the wind, the male  part is carried to the female part--they mix, and at once the seed of  a new plant begins to grow.    Then come to the animals. In all higher forms of animal life, the  male creature _comes_ to the female creature and himself places  within her body the germ which, when it meets the egg which is  waiting for it, immediately makes a new life begin to grow. But the  animals come together without _knowing why_. They do it from instinct  only, and they do it in what is called the mating season, which is  usually in the spring. The mating season happens once a year among  most of the higher animals, like birds and wild cattle, but to some  animals it comes several times a year like the rabbits, for instance.  You doubtless know already that the more highly developed the animal,  the longer it takes the young one to grow before it is born, and the  longer the period when it is helpless to provide its own food and  care.    Now we come to human beings, and see how different they are! They  have no regular mating season, and while there is a certain amount of  instinct in men and women which tends to bring them together, the sex  impulse among highly developed people is far more the result of their  feeling of love for each other than mere animal instinct alone. Many  of the animals make no choice at all in their mating. Any near-by  female will do for the male. But among some of the higher animals the  male has a special instinct for a certain female, and the female will  not tolerate any but a certain male. Most of the animals have  different mates every season, though there are a few kinds where the  male and female, once having mated, remain mates for years, sometimes  even for life. But it is _only human beings_ whose mating is what we  call \"falling in love,\" and that is an experience far beyond anything  that the animals know.    It means that a man and a woman feel that they _belong_ to each other  in a way that they belong to no one else; it makes them wonderfully  happy to be together; they find they want to live together, work  together, play together, and to have children together, that is, to  marry each other; and their dream is to be happy together all their  lives. Sometimes the dream does not come true, and there is much  failure and unhappiness, but just the same people go right on trying  to make it a success, because it is what they care most for.    The sex attraction is the strongest feeling that human beings know,  and unlike the animals, it is far more than a mere sensation of the  body. It takes in the emotions and the mind and the soul, and that is  why our happiness is so dependent upon it.    When a man and a woman fall in love so that they really belong to  each other, the physical side of the relation is this: both of them  feel at intervals a peculiar thrill or glow, particularly in the  sexual organs, and it naturally culminates after they have gone to  bed at night. The man's special sex organ or penis, becomes enlarged  and stiffened, instead of soft and limp as ordinarily, and thus it  easily enters the passage in the woman's body called the vagina or  birth-canal, which leads to the uterus or womb, which as perhaps you  already know is the sac in which the egg or embryo grows into a baby.  The penis and the vagina are about the same size, as Nature intended  them to fit each other. By a rhythmic movement of the penis in and  out, the sex act reaches an exciting climax or orgasm, when there is  for the woman a peculiarly satisfying contraction of the muscles of  the passage and for the man, the expulsion of the semen, the liquid  which contains the germs of life. This is followed by a sensation of  peaceful happiness and sleepy relaxation. It is the very greatest  physical pleasure to be had in all human experience, and it helps  very much to increase all other kinds of pleasure also. It is at this  time that married people not only are closest to each other  physically, but they feel closer to each other in every other way  too. It is then most of all that they feel _sure_ they belong to each  other.    The sex act is called by various names, such as coitus, coition,  copulation, cohabitation, sex-intercourse, the sex-embrace, etc. But  all these terms refer to the same thing. The first coitus is apt to  be somewhat painful for the woman, as there is usually a thin  membrane, called the hymen, partly closing the vagina which has to be  broken through, but all women do not have it and it varies in size  and thickness with different people.    Without the sex act, no babies could be created, for it is by this  means only that the semen which contains the male part of the germ of  life can meet the ovum or the female part of the germ of life. When  the two parts come together in the woman's body under just the right  conditions, a baby begins to grow--at first so tiny that it could  hardly be seen without a microscope, and finally, after nine months'  growth in the uterus or womb of the mother till it weighs about seven  or eight pounds, it is born, a live human being. The birth process is  called _labor_, and it is indeed labor, for it usually means much  pain and struggle for the mother, although the baby's journey from  the uterus to the world is only a few inches. It takes anywhere from  an hour to two days for a baby to be born. Doctors are learning more  and more how to lessen the pain, and by the end of another generation  it ought to be possible for child-birth to be practically painless  for most women. By that time people will more generally understand  how to have babies _only_ when they want them and can afford them. At  present, unfortunately, it is against the law to give people  information as to how to manage their sex relations so that no baby  will be created unless the father and mother are ready and glad to  have it happen.    Now you must understand something about this intricate sexual  machinery. Plate I shows the woman's organs and Plate 2 the man's.
