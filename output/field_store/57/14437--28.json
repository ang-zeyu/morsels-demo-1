If  we can imagine a time arriving when all the possible phenomena are  known, and the existing hypothesis still explains them, nothing  henceforth can overturn it, the science is completed. That is the  simple case in which a theory has been victorious; but if it is  contradicted by a single well-authenticated fact it must fall or  become modified. The more things a theory explains in the present the  more chance it has of success in the future. It is still only a matter  of chances, for the theory is always at the mercy of unforeseen  observation, which may rudely overthrow it.    There is no theory which must not be modified constantly, at least in  its details. To render it more and more general by successive  improvements is the aim to be pursued. A collection of studies  constitutes a science when a hypothesis has arisen already  sufficiently strong to oblige us to refer to it all new acquisitions,  and to compel us to see if they fortify or oppose it.    It would indeed be a narrow conception if we were to consider as  scientific the partisans of the theory alone; more than anywhere else  discussion is fruitful in the natural sciences; and if it is necessary  to be constantly preoccupied with the general ideas of the day, it is  not at all necessary to adhere to them servilely. The naturalists of  to-day are in possession of a formula with which we must always  preoccupy ourselves; in other words, there are natural sciences.    _The theory of Evolution._--This hypothesis which comes before all  others is the theory of evolution. This is not the place to expound  it, to go over the proofs which have been amassed to build it up, nor  the criticisms which have been directed against it. It has to-day come  out of the struggle victoriously. A prodigious quantity of facts, of  comparative anatomy and of embryology, inexplicable without it, emerge  from the chaos and constitute a whole, truly and marvellously  homogeneous. Issued from the natural sciences, the doctrine of  evolution now overflows them and tends to embrace everything that  concerns man: history, sociology, political economy, psychology. The  moralists seek, and will surely find, compromises permitting ethical  laws to endure the rule of this overwhelming hypothesis.    Without going too far back into history, let us look towards the end  of the last century and the beginning of this. Cuvier, Lamarck,[2] and  Geoffroy Saint-Hilaire,[3] all preoccupied with general ideas, were  each trying to build up a doctrine. The theory of evolution was born  beneath the pen of Lamarck, but immediately fell under the attacks of  Cuvier.[4] It is to Darwin that the honour belongs of having rescued  it from oblivion and of having initiated the movement which to-day  rules the natural sciences. Studies in embryology and anatomy are  rising without number beneath this impulse; and perhaps it may be said  that these new sciences, so fruitful in results, absorb a little too  much attention and leave in the shade subjects longer known, but  which, however, gain new interest by the way they fit into present  scientific theories.

I wish to speak of the manners of animals; the facts regarding them  are of sufficient interest if we consider them one by one, and they  become much more interesting when we attempt to show the close way in  which they are bound together. Volumes would not suffice to exhaust  the subject; but if the entire task is too considerable, I may at  least hope to accomplish a part of it by treating of those facts which  may be brought together under the common title of Animal Industries.  Taken separately, they may be reproached with a certain anecdotal  character, but we cannot fail to agree that taken altogether they  constitute an important chapter in the sciences of life.    _The chief industries of Man._--Let us first throw a rapid glance at  the various stages which the civilisation and industry of Man have  gone through before arriving at their present condition. To make clear  these phases we might either follow the state of civilisation in any  given country by tracing back the course of centuries, or else at a  given epoch find out in different parts of the earth all the stages of  human evolution. The savage men of to-day are not further advanced in  their evolution than our own ancestors who have now gone to fossil.  However it may be, Man, at first frugivorous, as his dentition shows  as well as his zoological affinities, in consequence of a famine of  fruit or from whatever other cause, gradually began to nourish himself  with the flesh of other animals. To search for this fleeing prey  developed in him the art of hunting and fishing. His intelligence,  still feeble, was entirely concentrated on this one point: to seize on  an animal and to feed on it, although neither his nails nor his teeth  nor his muscles make it natural to him. To hunt, to fish, to defend  his territory against the wild beasts who attacked it and himself, to  drive back tribes of his fellows who would diminish his provisions,  these were the first rudiments of the industry of Man. Having become  more skilful, he obtained in an expedition more game than he could  consume at once; he then kept near him living beasts in order to  sacrifice them when hunger came. His reserve of animals increased;  they became accustomed to live near him; and he took care of his  larder. A flock was gradually constituted, and the owner learnt to  profit from all the resources which it offered him, from milk to wool.  Henceforth he became economical with his beasts, and moved about in  order to procure for them abundance of grass and water. He was still  always hunting and fighting; but there were now accessory industries,  and he was especially occupied in the domestication of animals. Then  it happened that he acquired a taste for a graminaceous grain--corn.  To seek the blades one by one is not a very fruitful labour, and  decidedly troublesome. Man collected a supply of them, cultivated  them, possessed fields which he sowed and harvested. He was henceforth  obliged to renounce his herds, which had become immense; for he could  not leave the soil where his corn was ripening, if he wished to gather  it himself, and his cattle were lacking pasture. The number of beasts  diminished; bread had killed milk. Man only kept near him a small  flock capable of feeding on a moderate territory. He abandoned his  temporary shelters, tents of skin or of woven wool, and since he must  henceforth live on the same piece of land, he constructed there a  fixed dwelling. Such is, taken altogether, the genesis of the industry  of the dwelling connected with the culture of the soil; to earlier  periods corresponded the natural or hollowed cave and the woven tent.    _The chief industries of Animals._--In a more or less perfect degree  we find the same industries among animals generally. In order to make  just comparisons, we ought especially to consider the methods of those  who are not endowed with specially appropriated organs, for in this  case their task is rendered too simple. To take an example. The Lion  is certainly an incomparable hunter; but his whole organisation tends  to facilitate the capture of living prey. His agility and the strength  of his muscles enable him to seize it at the first leap before it can  escape. With his sharp claws he holds it; his teeth are so keen and  his jaw so strong that he kills it immediately; with such natural  advantages what need has he of ingenuity? But in the case of the Wolf  or the Fox it is quite another matter; they hunt with a veritable art  which Man himself has not disdained, since he has taken as his  associate their relative, the Dog. It is the same with the Eagle and  the Crow. The latter, in order to seize the prey which he desires,  needs much more varied resources than the great bird of rapine for  whom nature has done everything.    We find among animals not only hunting and fishing but the art of  storing in barns, of domesticating various species, of harvesting and  reaping--the rudiments of the chief human industries. Certain animals  in order to shelter themselves take advantage of natural caverns in  the same way as many races of primitive men. Others, like the Fox and  the Rodents, dig out dwellings in the earth; even to-day there are  regions where Man does not act otherwise, preparing himself a lodging  by excavations in the chalk or the tufa. Woven dwellings, constructed  with materials entangled in one another, like the nests of birds,  proceed from the same method of manufacture as the woollen stuffs of  which nomad tribes make their tents. The Termites who construct vast  dwellings of clay, the Beavers who build huts of wood and of mud, have  in this industry reached the same point as Man. They do not build so  well, no doubt, nor in so complex a fashion as modern architects and  engineers, but they work in the same way. All these ingenious artisans  operate without organs specially adapted to accomplish the effect  which they reach. It is with such genuine industries that we have to  deal, for the most part neglecting other productions, more marvellous  in certain ways, which are formed by particular organs, or are  elaborated within the organism, and are not the result of the  intelligent effort of the individual. To this category belong the  threads which the Spider stretches, and the cocoon with which the  Caterpillar surrounds himself to shelter his metamorphosis.    _Intelligence "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/29839"],[0,"The House in the Water: A Book of Animal Stories (#2)"],[1,"with  expectancy. His purpose was to gain a point where he could crouch in  ambush behind the dam, and perhaps get a view of the lake-dwellers  actually at work. He was within six or eight feet of the dam,  crouching low (for the dam was not more than three feet in height),  when his trained and cunning ear caught a soft swirling sound in the  water on the other side of the barrier. Instantly he stiffened to a  statue, just as he was, his mouth open so that not a pant of his  quickened breath might be audible. The next moment the head of a  beaver appeared over the edge of the dam, not ten feet away, and  stared him straight in the face.    The beaver had a stick of alder in its mouth, to be used, no doubt, in  some repairing of the dam. The Boy, all in gray as he was, and  absolutely motionless, trusted to be mistaken for one of the gnarled,  gray stumps with which the open space below the dam was studded. He  had read that the beaver was very near-sighted, and on that he based  his hopes, though he was so near, and the moonlight so clear, that he  could see the bright eyes of the newcomer staring straight into his  with insistent question. Evidently, the story of that near-sightedness  had not been exaggerated. He saw the doubt in the beaver's eye fade  gradually into confidence, as the little animal became convinced that  the strange gray figure was in reality just one of the stumps. Then,  the industrious dam-builder began to climb out upon the crest of the  dam, dragging his huge and hairless tail, and glancing along as if to  determine where the stick which he carried would do most good. At this  critical moment, when the eager watcher felt that he was just about to  learn the exact methods of these wonderful architects of the wild, a  stick in the slowly settling mud beneath his feet broke with a soft,  thick-muffled snap.    [Illustration: \"BEGAN TO CLIMB OUT UPON THE CREST OF THE DAM.\"]    So soft was the sound that it barely reached the Boy's ears. To the  marvellously sensitive ears of the beaver, however, it was a warning  more than sufficient. It was a noisy proclamation of peril. Swift as a  wink of light, the beaver dropped his stick and dived head first into  the pond. The Boy straightened up just in time to see him vanish. As  he vanished, his broad, flat, naked tail hit the water with a cracking  slap which resounded over the pond like a pistol-shot. It was reechoed  by four or five more splashes from the upper portion of the pond.  Then all was silence again, and the Boy realized that there would be  no more chance that night for him to watch the little people of the  House in the Water. Mounting the firm-woven face of the dam and  casting his eyes all over the pond, he satisfied himself that two  houses which he had first seen were all that it contained. Then,  resisting the impulse of his excitement, which was to explore all  around the pond's borders at once, he resolutely turned his face back  to camp, full of thrilling plans for the morrow.          CHAPTER II    The Battle in the Pond      AT breakfast, in the crisp of the morning, while yet the faint  mists clung over the brook and the warmth of the camp-fire was  attractive, the Boy proclaimed his find. Jabe had asked no questions,  inquisitiveness being contrary to the backwoodsman's code of  etiquette; but his silence had been full of interrogation. With his  mouth half-full of fried trout and cornbread, the Boy remarked:    \"That was no windfall, Jabe, that noise we heard last night!\"    \"So?\" muttered the woodsman, rather indifferently.    Without a greater show of interest than that the Boy would not divulge  his secret. He helped himself to another flaky pink section of trout,  and became seemingly engrossed in it. Presently the woodsman spoke  again. He had been thinking, and had realized that his prestige had  suffered some kind of blow.    \"Of course,\" drawled the woodsman sarcastically, \"it wa'n't no  windfall. I jest said that to git quit of bein' asked questions when I  was sleepy. I knowed all the time it was beaver!\"    \"Yes, Jabe,\" admitted the Boy, \"it was beavers. I've found a big  beaver-pond just up the brook a ways--a pond with two big beaver-houses  in it. I've found it--so I claim it as mine, and there ain't to be  any trapping on that pond. Those are my beavers, Jabe, every one of  them, and they sha'n't be shot or trapped!\"    \"I don't know how fur yer injunction'd hold in law,\" said Jabe dryly,  as he speared a thick slab of bacon from the frying-pan to his tin  plate. \"But fur as I'm concerned, it'll hold. An' I reckon the boys of  the camp this winter'll respect it, too, when I tell 'em as how it's  your own partic'lar beaver pond.\"    \"Bless your old heart, Jabe!\" said the Boy. \"That's just what I was  hoping. And I imagine anyway there's lots more beaver round this  region to be food for the jaws of your beastly old traps!\"    \"Yes,\" acknowledged Jabe, rising to clear up, \"I struck three likely  ponds yesterday, as I was cruisin over to west'ard of the camp. I  reckon we kin spare you the sixteen or twenty beaver in 'Boy's  Pond!'\"    The Boy grinned appreciation of the notable honour done him in the  naming of the pond, and a little flush of pleasure deepened the red of  his cheeks. He knew that the name would stick, and eventually go upon  the maps, the lumbermen being a people tenacious of tradition and not  to be swerved from their own way.    \"Thank you, Jabe!\" he said simply. \"But how do you know there are  sixteen or twenty beaver in my pond?\"    \"You said there was two houses,\" answered the woodsman. \"Well, we  reckon always from eight to ten beaver to each house, bein' the old  couple, and then three or four yearlin's not yet kicked out to set up  housekeeping fer themselves, and three or four youngsters of the  spring's whelping. Beavers' good parents, an' the family holds  together long's the youngsters needs it. Now I'm off. See you here at  noon, fer grub!\" and picking up his axe he strode off to southwestward  of the camp to investigate a valley which he had located the day  before.    Left alone, the Boy hurriedly set the camp in order, rolled up the  blankets, washed the dishes, and put out the last of the fire. Then,  picking up his little Winchester, which he always carried,--though he  never used it on anything more sensitive than a bottle or a tin  can,--he retraced his steps of the night before, up-stream to the  beaver pond.    Knowing that the beavers do most of their work, or, at least, most of  their above-water work, at night, he had little hope of catching any  of them abroad by daylight. He approached the dam, nevertheless, with  that noiseless caution which had become a habit with him in the woods,  a habit which rendered the woods populous for him and teeming with  interest, while to more noisy travellers they seemed quite empty of  life. One thing his study of the wilderness had well taught him, which  was that the wild kindreds do not by any means always do just what is  expected of them, but rather seem to delight in contradicting the  naturalists.    When he reached the edge of the open, however, and peered out across  the dam, there was absolutely nothing to break the shining morning  stillness. In the clear sunlight the dam, and the two beaver-houses  beyond, looked larger and more impressive than they had looked the  night before. There was no sign of life anywhere about the pond,  except a foraging fish-hawk winging above it, with fierce head  stretched low in the search for some basking trout or chub.    [Illustration: \"A FORAGING FISH-HAWK WINGING ABOVE.\"]    Following the usual custom of the wild kindreds themselves, the Boy  stood motionless for some minutes behind his thin screen of bushes  before revealing himself frankly in the open. His patient watch being  unrewarded, he was on the very verge of stepping forth, when from the  tail of his eye he caught a motion in the shallow bed of the brook,  and ducked himself. He was too wary to turn his head; but a moment  later a little brown sinuous shape came into his field of view. It was  an otter, making his way up-stream.    The otter moved with unusual caution, glancing this way and that  and seeming to take minute note of all he saw. At the foot of the  dam he stopped, and investigated the structure with the air of one  who had never seen it before. So marked was this air that the Boy  concluded he was a stranger to that region,--perhaps a wanderer  from the head of the Ottanoonsis, some fifteen miles southward,  driven away by the operations of a crew of lumbermen who were  building a big lumber-camp there. However that might be, it was  evident that the brown traveller was a newcomer, an outsider. He  had none of the confident, businesslike manner which a wild animal  wears in moving about his own range.    When he had stolen softly along the whole base of the dam, and back  again, nosing each little rivulet of overflow, the otter seemed  satisfied that this was much like all other beaver dams. Then he  mounted to the crest and took a prolonged survey of the stretch of  water beyond. Nothing unusual appearing, he dived cleanly into the  pond, about the point where, as the Boy guessed, there would be the  greatest depth of water against the dam. He was apparently heading  straight up for the inlet of the pond, on a path which would take him  within about twenty-five or thirty yards of the main beaver-house on  the island. As soon as he had vanished under the water the Boy ran  forward, mounted the crest of the dam, and peered with shaded eyes to  see if he could mark the swimmer's progress.    [Illustration: \"THE OTTER MOVED WITH UNUSUAL CAUTION.\"]    For a couple of minutes, perhaps, the surface of the pond gave no  indication of the otter's whereabouts. Then, just opposite the main  beaver-house, there was a commotion in the water, the surface curled  and eddied, and the otter appeared in great"]]]
