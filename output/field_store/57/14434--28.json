The first day of thaw usually ends tracking because the  investigator loses the trail when it crosses a patch of bare ground.  The use of a dye on the feet of the individual to be trailed eliminates  much of the difficulty of determining which tracks are to be followed.  One or more feet can be dyed when the investigator handles the animal  in releasing it from the trap. The trail of dyed footprints is  distinguishable from all other rabbit tracks in the area. Even when  only patches of snow remain, the animal can be followed by checking the  edges of the snow for the emerging footprints of the marked rabbit. The  same dye is used to color the tails. The color persists in the  footprints for about three hours, over a distance of 600 to 800 yards.  The animal leaves only a small spot in each footprint, but when it  pauses, the mark is large. Red dye makes the most conspicuous mark in  the snow.    Thirty-one rabbits were trailed 68 times with one to six records for  different individuals. Almost two-thirds of the trailing records  pertain to males, which were caught more easily than females while snow  was on the ground.    The trail, for both sexes, in those individuals released and followed  immediately was longer than in individuals released and allowed to move  away before they were followed. The area ranged over by a trailed  individual was not significantly greater in either case. The area  ranged over was greater by day than by night. Individuals continued to  move while being followed in the day, but stopped to forage and look  about at night.    Records were obtained by identifying cottontails that I flushed from  forms as I walked through the study area, sometimes using a  noise-making device or dragging a rope. Regular search was made along  the hilltop rock outcrops, under which hiding cottontails could be  identified with the aid of a flashlight. Forms in brush piles, and  thickets were visited and the inhabitants identified. Other persons,  working on the study area, supplied some of the records of cottontails  that were seen alive or found dead. Also through binoculars or a  telescope I watched movements of undisturbed individuals. Twenty-three  individuals were identified 59 times. Nine females were seen 28 times  and 14 males were seen 31 times. Sixty-five other individuals were  seen, but could not be identified in the field.      MOTIVATION AND EXTENT OF MOVEMENTS    The home range is an area in which an animal carries on its normal  activities of eating, resting, mating, caring for young, and escaping  from predators. The cottontail establishes a definite home range and  may live its entire life within this area, which permits familiarity  with food sources, hiding places, and escape routes.    The cottontail usually establishes its home range in the area where it  was born, being semi-gregarious and tolerant of crowding. Eight  cottontails that were captured and marked as young remained in the area  of original capture after becoming adults. Two of them lived 17 months  in the same area, two lived 14 months, two lived 13 months, one lived  12 months and one lived eight months. No young were observed to have  moved to another home range after they matured, although some may have  moved off the study area and thereby escaped observation.    Young become independent and are seen foraging and moving about by the  time they weigh 200 to 300 grams, at an age of four to six weeks. They  associate with other young of the same litter and neighboring litters,  and frequently frolic together. When two to three months old and  weighing 400 to 700 grams they begin to live a more solitary life and  usually rest alone in forms. Fourteen young between one and six weeks  of age never were recorded to have moved more than 150 feet.    The population reaches its peak in August or September; home ranges  varying in size from one-half acre (in young ranging in size from 150  grams to 800 grams) to 12 acres, in adults, are superimposed upon each  other. In a woodland area of approximately 21 acres 33 cottontails were  living together in September, 1955.    As the growing season ends and winter approaches, the amount of food  available to the cottontail decreases and the cover becomes sparser  (Pls. 45 and 46); predators, disease, and weather take their toll of  the young. The survivors must move farther to find adequate food and  cover. The home range of the cottontail in the first winter is  overlapped by the home ranges of the other members of the same litter,  and members of other litters, as the home range is enlarged to  approximately its full size. By April the population reached its annual  low point; nine of the original 33 cottontails were known to have  survived on the 21-acre area of northwest-facing wooded slope south of  the pond.    Foremost among the needs of the cottontail are food and cover. Daily  movements motivated by these needs are the most frequent and most  extensive that it makes. Movements such as are associated with courting  and mating, escaping severe weather, escaping from predators, and  caring for young are seasonal or irregular in occurrence.    Because the abundant vegetation of summer provides adequate food and  cover, movements made while foraging and seeking concealment are less  extensive than those made in winter when leafy vegetation is absent and  food is scarce. The average length of trails of foraging cottontails  was 175 feet per day in summer (11 individuals observed without  disturbance) and 325 feet per day in winter (22 individuals trailed or  observed without disturbance).    In the spring and summer cottontails forage mostly near woodland edges  for grass and herbs, and usually wander no more than 40 feet into the  grasslands from the protection of woodland edges and thickets. In  autumn and winter cottontails forage in woods and along woodland edges  for bark of trees and shrubs and for fallen fruits of trees. Ninety-two  per cent of all fecal pellets found in grassland were within 40 feet of  cover suitable for cottontails.    Movements made by the cottontail while foraging appear aimless; typical  behavior consists of progression with a hesitant gait of two or three  hops, a stop to eat, another series of hops and another stop.  Footprints made by this movement are about 12 inches apart. With  occasional spurts of hopping the individual moves perhaps ten to twelve  feet where it stops and begins to eat again. The area in which the  individual forages is usually elongated with its long axis parallel to  the edge except in areas of uniform habitat (such as large patches of  coralberry) where the area covered tends to be more nearly circular.  Cottontails observed foraging were estimated to utilize 10 to 20 per  cent of the home range area in one evening. Paths or runways are not  ordinarily utilized by foraging cottontails.    In seeking protection from predators or from the weather, cottontails  move farther in winter than in summer. The average length of trails of  cottontails flushed by me in the study area was 80 feet in summer and  210 feet in winter.    When cottontails were released from live-traps they ran an average of  30 feet before stopping to look about. Cottontails always ran toward  the densest cover within 50 feet of the point of release. Ten per cent  of the cottontails released from live-traps did not stop running until  out of sight (always more than 30 feet).    Movements made by cottontails escaping from predators differ from  movements made while foraging. The gait is a full run, often eight to  ten feet between footprints in snow; the trail is either straight or  slightly zig-zag. If possible, the individual will take refuge in a  hiding place such as a rock outcrop, brush pile, or thicket. Eight  cottontails emerged from such hiding places an average of 22 minutes  after the disturbance ceased.    If unable to find a hiding place a pursued cottontail will run 600 to  1200 feet while circling and returning to the area from which it ran.  If not closely pursued, it will usually (in 68 per cent of the  instances) not enter hiding places, but continue to run ahead of the  pursuer. Of 70 released from live-traps and followed, 23 sought refuge  in hiding places. The others ran slowly (4 to 7 feet between footprints  in the snow) with frequent pauses to look and listen; they usually  succeeded in keeping out of my sight. Twelve times the trails of  cottontails followed in this manner passed near a form, or other  resting place; always the cottontails had paused at the resting place,  and twice the individual went into the resting place and ran out again  when I approached. Resulting trails were almost circular, covering most  (70-90 per cent) of the home range; sometimes three or four complete  circuits were made. The trails made when I pursued cottontails ranged  in length from 800 to 3,000 feet. A trail recorded for an individual on  one night was almost identical with another trail for the same  individual recorded another night. The cottontail is not easily driven  out of its home range. Paths or runways are used by cottontails  escaping from predators in dense vegetation along fence lines, in  thickets, or brush piles, or in snow that is eight or more inches deep.    Most of the year cottontails rest in forms of grass or brush near  woodland edges but in extremely cold or hot weather they seek the  greater protection of the woods. Movements are limited to the woodlands  in severe weather, especially when deep snow makes travel difficult.    Hilltop rock outcrops on the area provide excellent protection for the  cottontail especially from low temperatures and freezing rain or  blowing snow. Eighty per cent of the cottontails resting under the rock  outcrops were found in severe winter weather. Fifteen per "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/29691"],[0,"Taxidermy (#2)"],[1,"of things, will address the preparing  and mounting of a fresh bird specimen. To many people of long experience  in the art of taxidermy this task never ceases to be a delightful  operation, one of the pleasantest of many interesting bits of work that  may result from a day spent afield.    Figuratively, the specimen lies before us, upon the bench. Make it any  native bird your fancy desires. The following notes will be found to  cover the ground:    A pencil and a sheet of wrapping paper will first be brought into  service. With these make outlines of the specimen, top and side views,  laying the bird upon the paper and drawing the pencil around it while  looking straight down upon it.    After the skinning, outline the body, top, and side views, upon same  sheet, with position of shoulder joint, hip joint, knee, and tail  marked in black spots.    This system of wrapping paper sketches will be found of great value in  all work, from mounting a bird to setting up a deer head.    [Illustration: Fig. 1.]    To begin skinning, lay the bird upon a newspaper, head to left of you,  on the bench. Have cornmeal handy. Part the belly and breast feathers up  middle. With a scalpel make an incision (see Fig. 1) from within one  inch of front end of breast bone back to a quarter-inch forward of the  vent in large birds, and to the vent in small ones. Use care not to cut  through abdominal wall, which is usually very thin and may easily be  confused as a part of the skin, being closely bound to it. The two are  easily separated, however.    The primary incision made, lift an edge of the skin with finger and  thumb nail and carefully tear skin free from body, using scalpel when  necessary to help.    When thigh of a leg is exposed, take hold of leg outside of skin and  push knee forward so it is uncovered inside of skin. Sever knee joint  with scalpel or scissors, using care not to cut through skin on outside  of joint. Repeat on other leg. Apply cornmeal or fine sawdust if blood  or juice starts.    Next set bird on end, tail up. Bend tail over backward and cut through  vent lining, tail muscles, and vertebrae forward of the large quills.  Use care not to cut skin around tail, as at knee.    With bird still held on end, start peeling skin down over back and  sides. Use scalpel if skin adheres tightly.    When pelvis is uncovered, if a small bird, take rump between two  forefingers and thumb of left hand; if a large bird, hang up on a wire  hook and cord, and skin down to shoulders.    Press wings forward strongly to loosen joint muscles. Cut through one  shoulder joint and then other, going carefully as at knee and tail, so  as not to cut skin on opposite side.    Plug with cotton or dry with meal wherever necessary to stop flowing  blood.    Next peel the neck skin down over head to bill, pulling out ear linings  when met with and using care to work close to skull when cutting eyelids  free.    When this is done, cut off base of skull. With this the skin is free  from the body and inside out.    If the specimen is of a species with neck skin too small to peel over  the head, turn head and neck back right side out when neck is only  partly skinned down. Make an incision from middle of back of head down  nearly half length of neck, alongside where nape is bare of feathers.  Through this incision turn and clean the head.    With the skin removed, turn attention to details of cleaning away leg,  wing, and tail muscles, removing eyes, brain, and jaw muscles from skull  and scraping out whatever fat is in the skin.    To clean leg bones, skin out the thick, meaty shins, using thumb nail  and scalpel to aid where necessary, down to heel joint or upper end of  tarsus. Just above this joint sever the tendons, front and back, and  peel leg muscles off.    In owls skin on down the tarsus to as near foot, or toes, as possible  and clean out tarsus muscles.    In large birds, next split ball of foot, insert point of a steel spindle  under base of tarsus tendons beside hind toe and draw these cords out.  This will sometimes require a strong pull.    Always do this after the leg above has been cleaned. In small birds it  is not necessary to split ball of foot nor to remove these tendons.    Next remove the wing muscles. Peel skin down to elbow. Cut tendons free  just above elbow and strip muscles off. To clean forearm in a small  bird, use the thumb nail to shove skin forward toward wrist, on front of  wing, without breaking union of large, secondary flight feathers with  wing bone.    With scalpel cut and lift out elbow ends of forearm muscles, strip them  out down to as near wrist as possible and cut off.    In a large bird, split skin of forearm and hand along under side after  carefully separating feathers over bare strips of skin. Peel skin back  both ways and remove flesh neatly. Scrape out whatever flesh is in  evidence on hand bones in same way. In a bird with no fat adhering to  the skin, the skull and tail only remain to be cleaned in order to  complete the skinning operation.    To clean skull, remove eyes with a scalpel, scrape brains out through  cut-off skull base, and trim away jaw muscles and a portion of roof of  mouth.    To clean tail, peel it out carefully and scrape and cut away fat and  meat adhering to bone and base of quills.    If you have a specimen with fat adhering to the skin in more or less  loose patches, as in hawks and owls, simply scrape or peel the fat off  with a knife and thumb and finger.    If a fat duck skin is to be prepared the inside layer of skin over the  fat tracts must be sheared off carefully with scissors and the fat then  removed with a skin scraper or dull knife blade, care being exercised  not to tear the outer skin or to pull through feathers with the grease.    To clean and degrease a bird skin which requires such treatment to  prepare for mounting, wash it first in lukewarm ammonia water with mild  soap. Squeeze from this washing and put through a bath of half-and-half  alcohol and spirits of turpentine. Squeeze from this thoroughly and run  through benzine. Compress and relax the skin repeatedly while immersed  in both these baths. When squeezed from the benzine, dry the plumage by  first burying the skin for some minutes in dry plaster of paris.    When nearly all the moisture is drawn out dust skin in the plaster until  natural fluffiness is restored. Do this last out of doors, where the  skin may be beaten well when thoroughly dry, to free it of plaster dust.  Lay skin, right side out, over the left hand and beat with the right,  giving an occasional shaking, the better to loosen plaster dust.    [Illustration: Fig. 2.]    An A1 duster may be made from the brush of an ox tail. Nail this on a  short piece of broomstick and square ends of hair with scissors. This  duster is used instead of beating the plumage with the hand and does the  work much quicker and better. When the dusting is done turn the skin  inside out again (see Fig. 2) and brush arsenic-water into all inner  surfaces, then turn skin right side out and brush a little of the  solution upon the feet, under side of wings, and inside the bill.    When poisoning the head, with skin inside out, one step in preparation  for mounting is to be taken. After the arsenic-water is applied to skull  and scalp, fill eye sockets with chopped tow or fine excelsior, put a  light layer of cotton smoothly around the skull, forward edge close down  to bill. Turn skin carefully back over skull and finish poisoning skin.    It is best, if possible to do without risk of decay, to fold the freshly  prepared skin in a clean paper, wrap in damp cloth, and lay over one  night in a cool place, before mounting. This allows arsenic-water to  penetrate through into base of plumage, thus becoming more effective  against moths than if skin were immediately filled with absorbent  material which would tend to draw out the freshly applied solution.    With the skin preparation completed, construction of an artificial body  is the next step. In all bird work, upholstery excelsior or \"wood wool\"  will be found most satisfactory for body making and neck, wing, and leg  wrapping. This may be found at almost any upholstery shop, as is also  tow, a fine grade of which is needed in making bird necks, as chopped,  soft filling, etc.    A good grade of long-fiber cotton is needed for wrapping skulls and  wing and leg bones in small birds, etc.    Various sizes of strong thread, both black and white, and some small,  strong, ball twine will be needed for wrapping and sewing.    When making the artificial body, lay the outline sketches before you and  copy Nature's lines throughout the work of assembling the specimen.    To make a firm core for the body, take a thick wisp of excelsior twice  the length of the natural body and small or large according to specimen.  Hold this tightly in the left hand, wrapping it very hard with thread or  cord. Wrap the squeezed excelsior where it protrudes from between thumb  and forefinger of left hand, drawing cord tight at each round, paying  out the wisp until all is wrapped hard (see Fig. 3).    [Illustration: Fig. 3.]    Now double this \"stick\" of excelsior in the middle and bind it together  tightly. This forms a solid core the length of the body.    The body is finished around this base by firmly binding upon it wisps or  handfuls of loose excelsior until the shape of the natural body is  approximated. To be correct this form should appear oval from side view  and pear-shaped from end view (see Fig. 4).    [Illustration: Fig. 4.]    All body wrapping must be firm so that wires set in it will not be loose  and cause the specimen to wobble.    Next cut the neck, wing, and leg wires. Cut neck wire three times  natural length, wing wires twice natural length, and leg wires three  times natural length. In the neck use a size wire that will support the  head firmly and still be easy to manipulate.    If the wings are to be"]]]
