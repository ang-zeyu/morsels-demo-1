Until  more evidence on the interspecific relationships is acquired, the  maintenance of the current classification is desirable.      DISCUSSION    Noble (1931) considered the species of _Phyllomedusa_ having opposable  digits, reduced terminal discs, and no webbing to be advanced and such  species as _Agalychnis moreleti_, _calcarifer_, and _spurrelli_ to be  primitive. Funkhouser (1957) followed Noble's suggestion and attempted  to explain the evolution of the species of _Phyllomedusa_ (_sensu lato_)  by assuming that they evolved from an advanced _Hyla_-like ancestor.  Therefore, she placed those species having large, fully webbed hands and  feet near the base of her phylogenetic scheme and hypothesized that  evolutionary sequences involved stages of reduction and eventual loss of  webbing, followed by the development of grasping toes. Such an  evolutionary history is highly unlikely. The _Agalychnis_ phyletic line  has one kind of specialization for an arboreal existence. It is contrary  to evolutionary theory that a specialized group would evolve into a  generalized form and then evolve new kinds of specializations to meet  the needs imposed by the same environmental conditions affecting the  earlier specialized group. A more reasonable hypothesis is that the  evolution of opposable digits took place in a phyletic line that had as  its ancestral stock a frog with generalized hands and feet. If this  assumption is correct, _Phyllomedusa_ and _Agalychnis_ represent  different phyletic lines; each exhibits divergent modes of adaptation  for arboreal habits, whereas _Pachymedusa_ probably remains relatively  little changed from the basic phyllomedusine stock.    On the basis of modern distribution and areas of diversification alone  (no fossils are known), it is evident that _Phyllomedusa_ underwent its  adaptive radiation in South America, _Agalychnis_ evolved in Central  America, and _Pachymedusa_ ended up in western Mexico. If we follow the  Matthewsian concepts of the American herpetofauna outlined by Dunn  (1931) and modified by Schmidt (1943) and Stuart (1950), _Pachymedusa_  represents a \"hanging-relict\" of a group that moved southward. According  to Savage's (1966) interpretation of the origins and history of the  American herpetofauna, _Agalychnis_ and _Pachymedusa_ are members of the  Mesoamerican fauna, and _Phyllomedusa_ is part of the Neotropical fauna.  Perhaps the phyllomedusines arose in South America; from there a  primitive stock spread northward and survived as _Pachymedusa_ in  Mexico, whereas the stock in Central America and South America evolved  into _Agalychnis_ and _Phyllomedusa_, respectively.    Evidently the primitive phyllomedusines evolved the habit of arboreal  egg deposition and a walking gait; the latter is best developed in the  small, highly specialized species of _Phyllomedusa_ (Lutz, 1966).  Probably the other divergent arboreal adaptations resulted from  environmental stresses and competition. The generalized _Pachymedusa_  inhabits relatively dry areas characterized by low forest. Throughout  its range it coexists with no more than five other arboreal hylids. The  species of _Agalychnis_ live in rain forests and humid montane forests.  In any given area one species of _Agalychnis_ occurs sympatrically with  no more than a dozen other arboreal hylids. With few exceptions the  species of _Agalychnis_ are more arboreal in their habits than are other  hylids. The species of _Phyllomedusa_ live in the same kinds of habitats  as do those of _Agalychnis_, but throughout the ranges of most of the  species of _Phyllomedusa_ the diversity of arboreal hylids is much  greater than in Central America. In the upper Amazon Basin as many as 35  hylids occur sympatrically. Many groups of _Hyla_ in this area (for  example, the _Hyla boans_ and _Hyla marmorata_ groups) are equally as  arboreal in their habits as are the species of _Agalychnis_ in Central  America. Conceivably, competition within this array of tree frogs  resulted in selection for modification of the extremities, thereby  bringing about a different mode of climbing in _Phyllomedusa_. The  walking gait already present in phyllomedusines provided a source for  further modification, which resulted in the development of opposable  digits and the associated lemuroid manner of climbing.    The known life histories of most species of _Phyllomedusa_, all species  of _Agalychnis_, and that of _Pachymedusa_ are similar.  Characteristically the tadpoles are generalized pelagic types that  develop in ponds, but at least some of the small specialized  _Phyllomedusa_ in southeastern Brazil have stream-adapted tadpoles with  funnel-shaped mouths (Cochran, 1955; Bokermann, 1966). Knowledge of the  life histories of the other species of _Phyllomedusa_ should aid in the  interpretation of the phylogenetic relationships of the several groups  of frogs now assigned to that genus.

I think the most convenient form in which I could attempt to supply the  need would be by addressing a letter to you embracing these topics,  which letter, should you esteem it worthy, could be printed with your  Preface.    In turning, then, to your first question, I have to premise that the  life and progress of any institution are very largely affected by  attendant circumstances and surroundings for which perhaps the leaders  of the institution itself are not responsible. Thus, with reference to  our Provincial Church at the period you mention, she was weakened by the  loss of not a few of those upon whom she had leaned for counsel and  stimulating influence. Bishops Hobhouse and Abraham, Sir William Martin  and Mr. Swainson, besides other prominent churchmen, such as Sir George  Arney, and others less known, speedily followed their great leader,  Bishop Selwyn, to England, or were removed by other causes. Without any  surrender to the weakness of a mere _laudator temporis acti_, I look  back to the time of my arrival in New Zealand with a feeling that there  were giants in the earth in those days. Many whom we have more recently  lost were also with us then--men like Messrs. Acland and Hanmer and  Maude and Sewell, Col. Haultain, Mr. Hunter-Brown, and, of course,  Bishop Hadfield and Dean Jacobs. Many of these were men of marked  ability, men who made the synod halls ring with their forcible  utterances, men full of knowledge of the Church and love for her, full  of self-sacrificing spirit and determination to make her a praise in  the faithful guardian of our Church's influence, Primate Harper. The  loss of such fathers of the Church has been felt in the interval under  review, and could not but affect the life and progress of the Church. It  is not for me to say anything of those by whom their places have been  filled.    Another adverse circumstance which must be called to mind in such a  review is the long period of commercial depression which followed a  short period of fictitious prosperity and inflated values. Misled by the  apparently fair prospect of making money rapidly--of which prospect a  shoal of interested persons sprang up to make the most--undertakings  were entered upon on borrowed capital and properties were bought at  prices which could not be realised upon them perhaps twenty years  afterwards. The consequence of all this was a widespread desolation. My  diocesan visitations were in those days largely made on horseback, and  in a journey of perhaps many hundred miles I had to look upon stations  and homesteads at which I had formerly been hospitably received, whether  their owners belonged to our communion or not, either closed altogether  or left in charge of a shepherd.    Many of the proprietors of these sheep stations had been liberal  supporters of the Church, and their ruin spelt disaster to the  authorities of the nearest clerical charge, if not also the weakness of  diocesan institutions. During those long, long years, diocesan  management was a weariness indeed, and not the less so because it was so  hard to keep up the courage even of our church-workers themselves. I am  thankful to say that no organised charge within my own diocese was  closed in that period, but it was manifestly impossible to subdivide  districts and so to introduce additional clergy. Little else could be  thought of than holding on.    By these circumstances, then, the life of the Church was affected and  her progress hindered. New conditions were developed, and the rulers of  the Church had to accept and provide for these new conditions. I am far  from saying that the large displacement of the pastoral industry by the  agricultural was a misfortune either to the country or the Church: as  regards the latter, the large increase of the population upon the land  has given the Church more scope for the exercise of her ministerial  activities; but for vestries and church committees the work is harder,  demanding, as it does, so much closer attention to details. In the old  days one man might ride round the eight or ten stations within a  district, and by collecting L10 to L20 from each would thus easily raise  a large part of the stipend of the clergyman, and at the same time enjoy  a pleasant visit to his friends. The collecting from a large number of  scattered persons is a different matter, and means many workers and much  patience. It is not unnatural, therefore, that this outlying work is  avoided, and that the church officials rely too much upon the residents  in towns and villages. This is a danger of the present, and needs close  attention. A vestry easily becomes content so soon as in one way or  another it has got together enough money wherewith to discharge its  obligations; but there can be no free and elastic expansion unless the  interest of all her members is enlisted by the Church, and each is  willing to do his part in the establishment of the kingdom of Christ.    I think the progress of the Church of late years has been satisfactory.  We have a body of clergy who, in devotion to their work and ability for  the performance of it, need not fear comparison with those of other  countries, not excluding the average of the English clergy themselves;  and I think it high time that that insulting enactment known as the  \"Colonial Clergy Act\" was rescinded. It is an unworthy bar to full  inter-communion between areas of the Church which profess to be at one.  As to our lay people I can only say that I often stand amazed at the  willing and patient sacrifice they make of time and effort in the  management of church affairs in synods, on vestries, and committees of  every kind for the promotion of her work.    As to the future, the great task of the Church is, to my mind, the  instruction both of the young clergy and the young laity as to the  Divine Commission and real nature of the Church. Since union through the  truth is the only method authorised by Holy Scripture, we must teach and  teach and teach. That is the task of our divinity schools and of the  clergy in preparing their candidates for confirmation: line upon line  and precept upon precept, definite and clear instruction should be given  so that the future heads of families may know and value their  privileges, and the whole population will be impressed by the strength  of our convictions.    I am afraid I have allowed my pen to run beyond the limits you had in  view, but you must do what you think well with this letter, and believe  me to remain,          Faithfully yours,           S.
