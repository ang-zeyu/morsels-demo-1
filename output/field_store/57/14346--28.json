The reasons that have led to the production in modern times of  bindings that fail to last for a reasonable time, are twofold. The  materials are badly selected or prepared, and the method of binding is  faulty. Another factor in the decay of bindings, both old and new, is  the bad conditions under which they are often kept.    The object of this text-book is to describe the best methods of  bookbinding, and of keeping books when bound, taking into account the  present-day conditions. No attempt has been made to describe all  possible methods, but only such as appear to have answered best on old  books. The methods described are for binding that can be done by hand  with the aid of simple appliances. Large editions of books are now  bound, or rather cased, at an almost incredible speed by the aid of  machinery, but all work that needs personal care and thought on each  book, is still done, and probably always will be done, by hand.  Elaborate machinery can only be economically employed when very large  numbers of books have to be turned out exactly alike.    The ordinary cloth \"binding\" of the trade, is better described as  casing. The methods being different, it is convenient to distinguish  between casing and binding. In binding, the slips are firmly attached  to the boards before covering; in casing, the boards are covered  separately, and afterwards glued on to the book. Very great efforts  have been made in the decoration of cloth covers, and it is a pity  that the methods of construction have not been equally considered. If  cloth cases are to be looked upon as a temporary binding, then it  seems a pity to waste so much trouble on their decoration; and if they  are to be looked upon as permanent binding, it is a pity the  construction is not better.    For books of only temporary interest, the usual cloth cases answer  well enough; but for books expected to have permanent value, some  change is desirable.    Valuable books should either be issued in bindings that are obviously  temporary, or else in bindings that are strong enough to be considered  permanent. The usual cloth case fails as a temporary binding, because  the methods employed result in serious damage to the sections of the  book, often unfitting them for rebinding, and it fails as a permanent  binding on account of the absence of sound construction.    In a temporary publisher's binding, nothing should be done to the  sections of a book that would injure them. Plates should be guarded,  the sewing should be on tapes, without splitting the head and tail, or  \"sawing in\" the backs, of the sections; the backs should be glued up  square without backing. The case may be attached, as is now usual. For  a permanent publisher's binding, something like that recommended for  libraries (page 173) is suggested, with either leather or cloth on the  back.    At the end of the book four specifications are given (page 307). The  first is suggested for binding books of special interest or value,  where no restriction as to price is made. A binding under this  specification may be decorated to any extent that the nature of the  book justifies. The second is for good binding, for books of reference  and other heavy books that may have a great deal of wear. All the  features of the first that make for the strength of the binding are  retained, while those less essential, that only add to the appearance,  are omitted. Although the binding under this specification would be  much cheaper than that carried out under the first, it would still be  too expensive for the majority of books in most libraries; and as it  would seem to be impossible to further modify this form of binding,  without materially reducing its strength, for cheaper work, a somewhat  different system is recommended. The third specification is  recommended for the binding of the general run of small books in most  libraries. The fourth is a modification of this for pamphlets and  other books of little value, that need to be kept together tidily for  occasional reference.    Thanks, in a great measure, to the work of Mr. Cobden-Sanderson,  there is in England the germ of a sound tradition for the best  binding. The Report of the Committee appointed by the Society of Arts  to investigate the cause of the decay of modern leather bindings,  should tend to establish a sound tradition for cheaper work. The third  specification at the end of this book is practically the same as that  given in their Report, and was arrived at by selection, after many  libraries had been examined, and many forms of binding compared.    Up to the end of the eighteenth century the traditional methods of  binding books had altered very little during three hundred years.  Books were generally sewn round five cords, the ends of all of these  laced into the boards, and the leather attached directly to the back.  At the end of the eighteenth century it became customary to pare down  leather until it was as thin as paper, and soon afterwards the use of  hollow backs and false bands became general, and these two things  together mark the beginning of the modern degradation of binding, so  far as its utility as a protection is concerned.    The Society of Arts Committee report that the bookbinders must share  with the leather manufacturers and librarians the blame for the  premature decay of modern bindings, because--    \"1. Books are sewn on too few, and too thin cords, and the slips are  pared down unduly (for the sake of neatness), and are not in all cases  firmly laced into the boards. This renders the attachment of the  boards to the book almost entirely dependent on the strength of the  leather.    \"2. The use of hollow backs throws all the strain of opening and  shutting on the joints, and renders the back liable to come right off  if the book is much used.    \"3. The leather of the back is apt to become torn through the use of  insufficiently strong headbands, which are unable to stand the strain  of the book being taken from the shelf.    \"4. It is a common practice to use far too thin leather; especially to  use large thick skins very much pared down for small books.    \"5. The leather is often made very wet and stretched a great deal in  covering, with the result that on drying it is further strained,  almost to breaking point, by contraction, leaving a very small margin  of strength to meet the accidents of use.\"    The history of the general introduction of hollow backs is probably  somewhat as follows: Leather was doubtless first chosen for covering  the backs of books because of its toughness and flexibility; because,  while protecting the back, it would bend when the book was opened and  allow the back to \"throw up\" (see fig. 1, A). When gold tooling became  common, and the backs of books were elaborately decorated, it was  found that the creasing of the leather injured the brightness or the  gold and caused it to crack. To avoid this the binders lined up the  back until it was as stiff as a block of wood. The back would then not  \"throw up\" as the book was opened, the leather would not be creased,  and the gold would remain uninjured (see fig. 1, B). This was all very  well for the gold, but a book so treated does not open fully, and  indeed, if the paper is stiff, can hardly be got to open at all. To  overcome both difficulties the hollow back was introduced, and as  projecting bands would have been in the way, the sewing cord was sunk  in saw cuts made across the back of the book.        [Illustration: FIG. 1.]    The use of hollow backs was a very ingenious way out of the  difficulty, as with them the backs could be made to \"throw up,\" and at  the same time the leather was not disturbed (see fig. 1, C). The  method of \"sawing in\" bands was known for a long time before the  general use of hollow backs. It has been used to avoid the raised  bands on books covered with embroidered material.    If a book is sewn on tapes, and the back lined with leather, there is  no serious objection to a carefully-made hollow back without bands.  The vellum binders use hollow backs made in this way for great account  books that stand an immense amount of wear. They make the \"hollow\"  very stiff, so that it acts as a spring to throw the back up.    But although, if carefully done, satisfactory bindings may be made  with hollow backs, their use has resulted in the production of  worthless bindings with little strength, and yet with the appearance  of better work.    The public having been accustomed to raised bands on the backs of  books, and the real bands being sunk in the back, the binders put  false ones over the \"hollow.\" To save money or trouble, the bands  being out of sight, the book would be sewn on only three or sometimes  only two cords, the usual five false ones still showing at the back.  Often only two out of the three bands would be laced into the board,  and sometimes the slips would not be laced in at all. Again, false  headbands worked by the yard by machinery would be stuck on at the  head and tail, and a \"hollow\" made with brown paper. Then leather so  thin as to have but little strength, but used because it is easy to  work and needs no paring, would be stuck on. The back would often be  full gilt and lettered, and the sides sprinkled or marbled, thus  further damaging the leather.    In every large library hundreds of books bound somewhat on these lines  may be seen. When they are received from the binder they have the  appearance of being well bound, they look smart on the shelf, but in a  few years, whether they are used or not, the leather will have  perished and the boards become detached, and they will have to be  rebound.    As long as librarians expect the appearance of a guinea binding for  two or three shillings, such shams will be produced. The librarian  generally gets his money's worth, for it would be impossible for the  binder to do better"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/26679"],[0,"Wit and Mirth: or Pills to Purge Melancholy, Vol. 5 of 6 (#2)"],[1,"away_,             42    _There was a Lass of_ Islington,                 46    _There was a Lord of worthy Fame_,               53    _There was a Jovial Tinker_,                     62    _There is a fine Doctor now come_,               71    _There was a Knight and he_,                    112    _Think wretched Mortal, think_,                 134    _To the Wars I must alass_,                     137    _Though the Pride of my Passion fair_,          156    _Tell me ye_ Sicilian _Swains_,                 175    _To the Grove, gentle Love, let_,               182    _Tell me no more of Flames in_,                 183    _Tho' Fortune and Love may be_,                 186    _That little Patch upon your Face_,             197    _Tho' over all Mankind, besides my_,            233    _There lives an Ale-draper near_,               259    _The Caffalier was gone, and the_,              274    _The_ Devil _he pull'd off his Jacket_,         278    _The Jolly, Jolly Breeze_,                      347    _The Jolly, Jolly Bowl_,                        ib.

VOL. V.          _The_ FOUR-LEGG'D ELDER: _Or a Horrible Relation of a_ DOG _and an_  Elder's MAID.      _By Sir_ John Burtonhead.    [Music]    All Christians and _Lay-Elders_ too,    For Shame amend your Lives;  I'll tell you of a Dog-trick now,    Which much concerns you Wives:  An _Elder's_ Maid near _Temple-Bar_,    (Ah! what a Quean was she?)  Did take an ugly Mastiff Cur,    Where Christians use to be.      _Help House of Commons, House of Peers,_        _Oh now or never help!_      _Th' Assembly hath not sat Four Years,_        _Yet hath brought forth a Whelp._    One Evening late she stept aside,    Pretending to fetch Eggs;  And there she made her self a Bride,    To one that had four Legs:  Her Master heard a Rumblement,    And wonder she did tarry;  Not dreaming (without his consent)    His Dog would ever Marry.      _Help House of Commons_, &c.    He went to peep, but was afraid,    And hastily did run,  To fetch a Staff to help his Maid,    Not knowing what was done:  He took his _Ruling Elders_ Cane,    And cry'd out _help, help, here_;  For _Swash_ our Mastiff, and poor _Jane_,    Are now fight Dog, fight Bear.      _Help House of Commons_, &c.    But when he came he was full sorry,    For he perceiv'd their Strife;  That according to the _Directory_,    They Two were Dog and Wife:  Ah! (then said he) thou cruel Quean,    Why hast thou me beguil'd?  I wonder _Swash_ was grown so lean,    Poor Dog he's almost spoil'd.      _Help House of Commons_, &c.    I thought thou hadst no Carnal Sense,    But what's in our Lasses:  And could have quench'd thy Cupiscence,    According to the _Classes_:  But all the Parish see it plain,    Since thou art in this pickle;  Thou art an INDEPENDENT Quean,    And lov'st a CONVENTICLE.      _Help House of Commons_, &c.    Alas now each _Malignant_ Rogue,    Will all the World perswade;  That she that's Spouse unto a Dog,    May be an _Elder's_ Maid:  They'll jeer us if abroad we stir,    Good Master _Elder_ stay;  Sir, of what _Classis_ is your Cur?    And then what can we say?      _Help House of Commons_, &c.    They'll many graceless Ballads sing,    Of a PRESBYTERIAN;  That a _Lay Elder_ is a thing    Made up half Dog, half Man:  Out, out, said he, (and smote her down)    Was Mankind grown so scant?  There's scarce another Dog in Town,    Had took the COVENANT.      _Help House of Commons_, &c.    Then _Swash_ began to look full grim,    And _Jane_ did thus reply;  Sir, you thought nought too good for him,    You fed your Dog too high:  'Tis true he took me in the lurch,    And leap'd into my Arms;  But (as I hope to come at Church)    I did your Dog no harm.      _Help House of Commons_, &c.    Then she was brought to _Newgate_ Gaol,    And there was Naked stripp'd;  They whipp'd her till the Cords did fail,    As Dogs us'd to be whipp'd:  Poor City Maids shed many a Tear,    When she was lash'd and bang'd;  And had she been a _Cavalier_,    Surely she had been hang'd.      _Help House of Commons_, &c.    Hers was but _Fornication_ found,    For which she felt the Lash:  But his was _Bugg'ry_ presum'd,    Therefore they hanged _Swash_:  What will become of _Bishops_ then,    Or _Independency_?  For now we find both Dogs and Men,    Stand up for PRESBYTRY.      _Help House of Commons_, &c.    She might have took a _Sow-gelder_,    With _Synod-men_ good store,  But she would have a _Lay-Elder_,    With Two Legs and Two more:  Go tell the _Assembly_ of Divines,    Tell Adoniram blue;  Tell _Burgess_, _Marshall_, _Case_ and _Vines_,    Tell _Now-and-Anon_ too.      _Help House of Commons_, &c.    Some say she was a _Scottish_ Girl,    Or else (at least) a Witch;  But she was born in _Colchester_,    Was ever such a Bitch:  Take heed all Christian Virgins now,    The _Dog-Star_ now prevails;  Ladys beware your Monkeys too,    For Monkeys have long Tails.      _Help House of Commons_, &c.    Bless _King_ and _Queen_, and send us Peace,    As we had Seven Years since:  For we remember no _Dog-days_,    While we enjoy'd our Prince:  Bless sweet Prince _Charles_, Two _Dukes_, Three Girls,    Lord save his _Majesty_;  Grant that his _Commons_, _Lords_, and _Earls_,    May lead such lives as _He_.      _Help House of Commons_, &c.          _Plain Proof Ruin'd: Or, a Grand_ CHEAT _Discover'd._      [Music]    Bold Impudent _Fuller_ invented a Plot,  And all to discover the Devil knows what;  About a young Bantling strangely begot.    _Which no body can deny._    The better to cheat both the Fools and the Wise,  He Impos'd on a Nation a Hundred of Lies;  That none but a Knight of the Post could devise.    _Which no body can deny._    He tells us he had the Honour to peep,  In the Warming-pan where the _Welch_ Infant did sleep;  And found out a Plot which was Damnable deep,    _Which no Body can believe._    Then to the Wise Senate he suddenly went,  Where he told all the Lies that he then could invent,  For which he was Voted a Rogue by consent,    _Which no Body can deny._    And tho' he was Punish'd for that his Offence,  He has almost forgot it, it was so long since,  Therefore the whole Game he began to Commence,    _Which no Body can deny._    Then he to the Lords his bold Letters did send,  And told the high Peers, that the Plot he could mend,  And make it as plain, as he first did pretend,    _Which no Body can deny._    He told them his Witnesses were mighty Men,  That wou'd come to the Town, tho' the Devil knows when,  And make _William Fuller_ once famous agen,    _Which no Body can deny._    The Lords they were Generous, Noble and Kind,  And allowed him Freedom his 'Squires to find,  The which he will do when the Devil is Blind,    _Which no Body can deny._    So the Peers they declared him a scandalous Sot,  And none thinks him fit to manage a Plot,  If _Newgate_ and _Tyburn_ does fall to his Lot,    _There's no Body will deny._    They gave him no more time than himself did require,  To find out his _Jones_ and the wandering 'Squire,  But the time being come, they were never the nigher,    _Which no Body can deny._    The brave House of _Commons_ next for him did send,  To hear what the Block-headly Fool wou'd pretend,  Who humbly request, that they wou'd him befriend,    _Which no Body can deny._    One day he declar'd they were near _London_ Town,  But the very next Day into _Wales_ they were flown,  Such nimble Heel'd Witnessess never were known,    _Which no Body can deny._    When being Examin'd about his sham Plot,  He answer'd as though he had minded them not,  Perhaps the Young Rogue had his Lesson forgot,    _Which no Body can deny._    But after some Study and impudent Tales,  Ask'd for a Commission to march into _Wales_,  And be Chang'd to a Herse, as Rogues goes to Gaols,    _Which no Body can deny._    But seeing his Impudence still to abound,  To go search for the Men who were not to be found,  They immediately sent him back to _Fleet_ Pound,    _Which no Body can deny._    From the _Fleet_ to the Cart may he quickly advance  To learn the true Steps of old _Oates's_ New Dance,  And something beside, or it is a great Chance,    _Which no Body can deny._    He has made it a Trade to be doing of Wrong,  In Swearing, and Lying, and Cheating so long,  For all his Life time, he's been at it ding dong,    _Which"]]]
