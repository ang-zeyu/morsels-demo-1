But the benefit that  will accrue to mankind is well worth the slight inconvenience to the  dumb creatures and the infrequent loss of their lives.\"           *       *       *       *       *    Old Crompton regarded him dubiously. \"You are trying to find?\" he  interrogated.    \"The secret of life!\" Tom Forsythe's eyes took on the stare of  fanaticism. \"Before I have finished I shall know the nature of the vital  force--how to produce it. I shall prolong human life indefinitely;  create artificial life. And the solution is more closely approached with  each passing day.\"    The hermit blinked in pretended mystification. But he understood  perfectly, and he bitterly envied the younger man's knowledge and  ability that enabled him to delve into the mysteries of nature which had  always been so attractive to his own mind. And somehow, he acquired a  sudden deep hatred of the coolly confident young man who spoke so  positively of accomplishing the impossible.    During the winter months that followed, the strange acquaintance  progressed but little. Tom did not invite his neighbor to visit him,  nor did Old Crompton go out of his way to impose his presence on the  younger man, though each spoke pleasantly enough to the other on the few  occasions when they happened to meet.    With the coming of spring they encountered one another more frequently,  and Tom found considerable of interest in the quaint, borrowed  philosophy of the gloomy old man. Old Crompton, of course, was  desperately interested in the things that were hidden in Tom's  laboratory, but he never requested permission to see them. He hid his  real feelings extremely well and was apparently content to spend as much  time as possible with the feathered and furred subjects for experiment,  being very careful not to incur Tom's displeasure by displaying too  great interest in the laboratory itself.           *       *       *       *       *    Then there came a day in early summer when an accident served to draw  the two men closer together, and Old Crompton's long-sought opportunity  followed.    He was starting for the village when, from down the road, there came a  series of tremendous squawkings, then a bellow of dismay in the voice of  his young neighbor. He turned quickly and was astonished at the sight of  a monstrous rooster which had escaped and was headed straight for him  with head down and wings fluttering wildly. Tom followed close behind,  but was unable to catch the darting monster. And monster it was, for  this rooster stood no less than three feet in height and appeared more  ferocious than a large turkey. Old Crompton had his shopping bag, a  large one of burlap which he always carried to town, and he summoned  enough courage to throw it over the head of the screeching, over-sized  fowl. So tangled did the panic-stricken bird become that it was a  comparatively simple matter to effect his capture, and the old man rose  to his feet triumphant with the bag securely closed over the struggling  captive.    \"Thanks,\" panted Tom, when he drew alongside. \"I should never have  caught him, and his appearance at large might have caused me a great  deal of trouble--now of all times.\"    \"It's all right, Forsythe,\" smirked the old man. \"Glad I was able to do  it.\"    Secretly he gloated, for he knew this occurrence would be an open sesame  to that laboratory of Tom's. And it proved to be just that.           *       *       *       *       *    A few nights later he was awakened by a vigorous thumping at his door,  something that had never before occurred during his nearly sixty years  occupancy of the tumbledown hut. The moon was high and he cautiously  peeped from the window and saw that his late visitor was none other than  young Forsythe.    \"With you in a minute!\" he shouted, hastily thrusting his rheumatic old  limbs into his shabby trousers. \"Now to see the inside of that  laboratory,\" he chuckled to himself.    It required but a moment to attire himself in the scanty raiment he wore  during the warm months, but he could hear Tom muttering and impatiently  pacing the flagstones before his door.    \"What is it?\" he asked, as he drew the bolt and emerged into the  brilliant light of the moon.    \"Success!\" breathed Tom excitedly. \"I have produced growing, living  matter synthetically. More than this, I have learned the secret of the  vital force--the spark of life. Immortality is within easy reach. Come  and see for yourself.\"    They quickly traversed the short distance to the two-story building  which comprised Tom's workshop and living quarters. The entire ground  floor was taken up by the laboratory, and Old Crompton stared aghast at  the wealth of equipment it contained. Furnaces there were, and retorts  that reminded him of those pictured in the wood cuts in some of his  musty books. Then there were complicated machines with many levers and  dials mounted on their faces, and with huge glass bulbs of peculiar  shape with coils of wire connecting to knoblike protuberances of their  transparent walls. In the exact center of the great single room there  was what appeared to be a dissecting table, with a brilliant light  overhead and with two of the odd glass bulbs at either end. It was to  this table that Tom led the excited old man.    \"This is my perfected apparatus,\" said Tom proudly, \"and by its use I  intend to create a new race of supermen, men and women who will always  retain the vigor and strength of their youth and who can not die  excepting by actual destruction of their bodies. Under the influence of  the rays all bodily ailments vanish as if by magic, and organic defects  are quickly corrected. Watch this now.\"           *       *       *       *       *    He stepped to one of the many cages at the side of the room and returned  with a wriggling cottontail in his hands. Old Compton watched anxiously  as he picked a nickeled instrument from a tray of surgical appliances  and requested his visitor to hold the protesting animal while he covered  its head with a handkerchief.    \"Ethyl chloride,\" explained Tom, noting with amusement the look of  distaste on the old man's face. \"We'll just put him to sleep for a  minute while I amputate a leg.\"    The struggles of the rabbit quickly ceased when the spray soaked the  handkerchief and the anaesthetic took effect. With a shining scalpel and  a surgical saw, Tom speedily removed one of the forelegs of the animal  and then he placed the limp body in the center of the table, removing  the handkerchief from its head as he did so. At the end of the table  there was a panel with its glittering array of switches and electrical  instruments, and Old Crompton observed very closely the manipulations of  the controls as Tom started the mechanism. With the ensuing hum of a  motor-generator from a corner of the room, the four bulbs adjacent to  the table sprang into life, each glowing with a different color and each  emitting a different vibratory note as it responded to the energy  within.    \"Keep an eye on Mr. Rabbit now,\" admonished Tom.    From the body of the small animal there emanated an intangible though  hazily visible aura as the combined effects of the rays grew in  intensity. Old Crompton bent over the table and peered amazedly at the  stump of the foreleg, from which blood no longer dripped. The stump was  healing over! Yes--it seemed to elongate as one watched. A new limb was  growing on to replace the old! Then the animal struggled once more, this  time to regain consciousness. In a moment it was fully awake and, with a  frightened hop, was off the table and hobbling about in search of a  hiding place.           *       *       *       *       *    Tom Forsythe laughed. \"Never knew what happened,\" he exulted, \"and  excepting for the temporary limp is not inconvenienced at all. Even that  will be gone in a couple of hours, for the new limb will be completely  grown by that time.\"    \"But--but, Tom,\" stammered the old man, \"this is wonderful. How do you  accomplish it?\"    \"Ha! Don't think I'll reveal my secret. But this much I will tell you:  the life force generated by my apparatus stimulates a certain gland  that's normally inactive in warm blooded animals. This gland, when  active, possesses the function of growing new members to the body to  replace lost ones in much the same manner as this is done in case of the  lobster and certain other crustaceans. Of course, the process is  extremely rapid when the gland is stimulated by the vital rays from my  tubes. But this is only one of the many wonders of the process. Here is  something far more remarkable.\"    He took from a large glass jar the body of a guinea pig, a body that was  rigid in death.    \"This guinea pig,\" he explained, \"was suffocated twenty-four hours ago  and is stone dead.\"    \"Suffocated?\"    \"Yes. But quite painlessly, I assure you. I merely removed the air from  the jar with a vacuum pump and the little creature passed out of the  picture very quickly. Now we'll revive it.\"    Old Crompton stretched forth a skinny hand to touch the dead animal, but  withdrew it hastily when he felt the clammy rigidity of the body. There  was no doubt as to the lifelessness of this specimen.           *       *       *       *       *    Tom placed the dead guinea pig on the spot where the rabbit had been  subjected to the action of the rays. Again his visitor watched carefully  as he manipulated the controls of the apparatus.    With the glow of the tubes and the ensuing haze of eery light that  surrounded the little body, a marked change was apparent. The inanimate  form relaxed suddenly and it seemed that the muscles pulsated with an  accession of energy. Then one leg was stretched forth spasmodically.  There was a convulsive "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/2865"],[0,"Otto of the Silver Hand (#2)"],[1,"fed noisily at the table, moving  here and there behind the men with wooden or pewter dishes of food, now  and then laughing at the jests that passed or joining in the talk. A  huge fire blazed and crackled and roared in the great open fireplace,  before which were stretched two fierce, shaggy, wolfish-looking hounds.  Outside, the rain beat upon the roof or ran trickling from the eaves,  and every now and then a chill draught of wind would breathe through the  open windows of the great black dining-hall and set the fire roaring.    Along the dull-gray wall of stone hung pieces of armor, and swords and  lances, and great branching antlers of the stag. Overhead arched the  rude, heavy, oaken beams, blackened with age and smoke, and underfoot  was a chill pavement of stone.    Upon Baron Conrad's shoulder leaned the pale, slender, yellow-haired  Baroness, the only one in all the world with whom the fierce lord of  Drachenhausen softened to gentleness, the only one upon whom his savage  brows looked kindly, and to whom his harsh voice softened with love.    The Baroness was talking to her husband in a low voice, as he looked  down into her pale face, with its gentle blue eyes.    \"And wilt thou not, then,\" said she, \"do that one thing for me?\"    \"Nay,\" he growled, in his deep voice, \"I cannot promise thee never more  to attack the towns-people in the valley over yonder. How else could I  live an' I did not take from the fat town hogs to fill our own larder?\"    \"Nay,\" said the Baroness, \"thou couldst live as some others do, for all  do not rob the burgher folk as thou dost. Alas! mishap will come upon  thee some day, and if thou shouldst be slain, what then would come of  me?\"    \"Prut,\" said the Baron, \"thy foolish fears\" But he laid his rough, hairy  hand softly upon the Baroness' head and stroked her yellow hair.    \"For my sake, Conrad,\" whispered the Baroness.    A pause followed. The Baron sat looking thoughtfully down into the  Baroness' face. A moment more, and he might have promised what she  besought; a moment more, and he might have been saved all the bitter  trouble that was to follow. But it was not to be.    Suddenly a harsh sound broke the quietness of all into a confusion of  noises. Dong! Dong!--it was the great alarm-bell from Melchior's Tower.    The Baron started at the sound. He sat for a moment or two with his hand  clinched upon the arm of his seat as though about to rise, then he sunk  back into his chair again.    All the others had risen tumultuously from the table, and now stood  looking at him, awaiting his orders.    \"For my sake, Conrad,\" said the Baroness again.    Dong! Dong! rang the alarm-bell. The Baron sat with his eyes bent upon  the floor, scowling blackly.    The Baroness took his hand in both of hers. \"For my sake,\" she pleaded,  and the tears filled her blue eyes as she looked up at him, \"do not go  this time.\"    From the courtyard without came the sound of horses' hoofs clashing  against the stone pavement, and those in the hall stood watching and  wondering at this strange delay of the Lord Baron. Just then the door  opened and one came pushing past the rest; it was the one-eyed Hans.  He came straight to where the Baron sat, and, leaning over, whispered  something into his master's ear.    \"For my sake,\" implored the Baroness again; but the scale was turned.  The Baron pushed back his chair heavily and rose to his feet. \"Forward!\"  he roared, in a voice of thunder, and a great shout went up in answer as  he strode clanking down the hall and out of the open door.    The Baroness covered her face with her hands and wept.    \"Never mind, little bird,\" said old Ursela, the nurse, soothingly; \"he  will come back to thee again as he has come back to thee before.\"    But the poor young Baroness continued weeping with her face buried in  her hands, because he had not done that thing she had asked.    A white young face framed in yellow hair looked out into the courtyard  from a window above; but if Baron Conrad of Drachenhausen saw it from  beneath the bars of his shining helmet, he made no sign.    \"Forward,\" he cried again.    Down thundered the drawbridge, and away they rode with clashing hoofs  and ringing armor through the gray shroud of drilling rain.    The day had passed and the evening had come, and the Baroness and her  women sat beside a roaring fire. All were chattering and talking and  laughing but two--the fair young Baroness and old Ursela; the one sat  listening, listening, listening, the other sat with her chin resting in  the palm of her hand, silently watching her young mistress. The night  was falling gray and chill, when suddenly the clear notes of a bugle  rang from without the castle walls. The young Baroness started, and the  rosy light flashed up into her pale cheeks.    \"Yes, good,\" said old Ursela; \"the red fox has come back to his den  again, and I warrant he brings a fat town goose in his mouth; now we'll  have fine clothes to wear, and thou another gold chain to hang about thy  pretty neck.\"    The young Baroness laughed merrily at the old woman's speech. \"This  time,\" said she, \"I will choose a string of pearls like that one my aunt  used to wear, and which I had about my neck when Conrad first saw me.\"    Minute after minute passed; the Baroness sat nervously playing with a  bracelet of golden beads about her wrist. \"How long he stays,\" said she.    \"Yes,\" said Ursela; \"but it is not cousin wish that holds him by the  coat.\"    As she spoke, a door banged in the passageway without, and the ring of  iron footsteps sounded upon the stone floor. Clank! Clank! Clank!    The Baroness rose to her feet, her face all alight. The door opened;  then the flush of joy faded away and the face grew white, white, white.  One hand clutched the back of the bench whereon she had been sitting,  the other hand pressed tightly against her side.    It was Hans the one-eyed who stood in the doorway, and black trouble sat  on his brow; all were looking at him waiting.    \"Conrad,\" whispered the Baroness, at last. \"Where is Conrad? Where is  your master?\" and even her lips were white as she spoke.    The one-eyed Hans said nothing.    Just then came the noise of men s voices in the corridor and the shuffle  and scuffle of feet carrying a heavy load. Nearer and nearer they came,  and one-eyed Hans stood aside. Six men came struggling through the  doorway, carrying a litter, and on the litter lay the great Baron  Conrad. The flaming torch thrust into the iron bracket against the wall  flashed up with the draught of air from the open door, and the light  fell upon the white face and the closed eyes, and showed upon his body  armor a great red stain that was not the stain of rust.    Suddenly Ursela cried out in a sharp, shrill voice, \"Catch her, she  falls!\"    It was the Baroness.    Then the old crone turned fiercely upon the one-eyed Hans. \"Thou fool!\"  she cried, \"why didst thou bring him here? Thou hast killed thy lady!\"    \"I did not know,\" said the one-eyed Hans, stupidly.          III. How the Baron came Home Shorn.    But Baron Conrad was not dead. For days he lay upon his hard bed, now  muttering incoherent words beneath his red beard, now raving fiercely  with the fever of his wound. But one day he woke again to the things  about him.    He turned his head first to the one side and then to the other; there  sat Schwartz Carl and the one-eyed Hans. Two or three other retainers  stood by a great window that looked out into the courtyard beneath,  jesting and laughing together in low tones, and one lay upon the heavy  oaken bench that stood along by the wall snoring in his sleep.    \"Where is your lady?\" said the Baron, presently; \"and why is she not  with me at this time?\"    The man that lay upon the bench started up at the sound of his voice,  and those at the window came hurrying to his bedside. But Schwartz Carl  and the one-eyed Hans looked at one another, and neither of them spoke.  The Baron saw the look and in it read a certain meaning that brought  him to his elbow, though only to sink back upon his pillow again with a  groan.    \"Why do you not answer me?\" said he at last, in a hollow voice; then  to the one-eyed Hans, \"Hast no tongue, fool, that thou standest gaping  there like a fish? Answer me, where is thy mistress?\"    \"I--I do not know,\" stammered poor Hans.    For a while the Baron lay silently looking from one face to the other,  then he spoke again. \"How long have I been lying here?\" said he.    \"A sennight, my lord,\" said Master Rudolph, the steward, who had come  into the room and who now stood among the others at the bedside.    \"A sennight,\" repeated the Baron, in a low voice, and then to Master  Rudolph, \"And has the Baroness been often beside me in that time?\"  Master Rudolph hesitated. \"Answer me,\" said the Baron, harshly.    \"Not--not often,\" said Master Rudolph, hesitatingly.    The Baron lay silent for a long time. At last he passed his hands over  his face and held them there for a minute, then of a sudden, before  anyone knew what he was about to do, he rose upon his elbow and then sat  upright upon the bed. The green wound broke out afresh and a dark red  spot grew and spread upon the linen wrappings; his face was drawn and  haggard with the pain of his moving, and his eyes wild and bloodshot.  Great drops of sweat gathered and stood upon his forehead as he sat  there swaying slightly from side to side.    \"My shoes,\" said he, hoarsely.    Master Rudolph stepped forward. \"But, my Lord Baron,\" he began and then  stopped short, for the Baron shot him such a look that his tongue stood  still in his head.    Hans saw that look out of his one eye. Down he dropped upon his knees  and, fumbling under the bed, brought forth a pair of soft leathern  shoes, which he slipped upon the Baron's feet and then laced the thongs  above the instep.    \"Your shoulder,\" said the Baron. He rose slowly to his feet, gripping  Hans in the stress of his "]]]
