I do not know any character of design which may be more easily  recognized at a glance than this over-lusciousness; and yet it seems to  me that at the present day there is nothing so little understood as the  essential difference between chasteness and extravagance, whether in  color, shade, or lines. We speak loosely and inaccurately of  \"overcharged\" ornament, with an obscure feeling that there is indeed  something in visible Form which is correspondent to Intemperance in  moral habits; but without any distinct detection of the character which  offends us, far less with any understanding of the most important lesson  which there can be no doubt was intended to be conveyed by the  universality of this ornamental law.    Sec. VII. In a word, then, the safeguard of highest beauty, in all visible  work, is exactly that which is also the safeguard of conduct in the  soul,--Temperance, in the broadest sense; the Temperance which we have  seen sitting on an equal throne with Justice amidst the Four Cardinal  Virtues, and, wanting which, there is not any other virtue which may not  lead us into desperate error. Now, observe: Temperance, in the nobler  sense, does not mean a subdued and imperfect energy; it does not mean a  stopping short in any good thing, as in Love or in Faith; but it means  the power which governs the most intense energy, and prevents its acting  in any way but as it ought. And with respect to things in which there  may be excess, it does not mean imperfect enjoyment of them; but the  regulation of their quantity, so that the enjoyment of them shall be  greatest. For instance, in the matter we have at present in hand,  temperance in color does not mean imperfect or dull enjoyment of color;  but it means that government of color which shall bring the utmost  possible enjoyment out of all hues. A bad colorist does not _love_  beautiful color better than the best colorist does, nor half so much.  But he indulges in it to excess; he uses it in large masses, and  unsubdued; and then it is a law of Nature, a law as universal as that of  gravitation, that he shall not be able to enjoy it so much as if he had  used it in less quantity. His eye is jaded and satiated, and the blue  and red have life in them no more. He tries to paint them bluer and  redder, in vain: all the blue has become grey, and gets greyer the more  he adds to it; all his crimson has become brown, and gets more sere and  autumnal the more he deepens it. But the great painter is sternly  temperate in his work; he loves the vivid color with all his heart; but  for a long time he does not allow himself anything like it, nothing but  sober browns and dull greys, and colors that have no conceivable beauty  in them; but these by his government become lovely: and after bringing  out of them all the life and power they possess, and enjoying them to  the uttermost,--cautiously, and as the crown of the work, and the  consummation of its music, he permits the momentary crimson and azure,  and the whole canvas is in a flame.    Sec. VIII. Again, in curvature, which is the cause of loveliness in all  form; the bad designer does not enjoy it more than the great designer,  but he indulges in it till his eye is satiated, and he cannot obtain  enough of it to touch his jaded feeling for grace. But the great and  temperate designer does not allow himself any violent curves; he works  much with lines in which the curvature, though always existing, is long  before it is perceived. He dwells on all these subdued curvatures to the  uttermost, and opposes them with still severer lines to bring them out  in fuller sweetness; and, at last, he allows himself a momentary curve  of energy, and all the work is, in an instant, full of life and grace.    The curves drawn in Plate VII. of the first volume, were chosen entirely  to show this character of dignity and restraint, as it appears in the  lines of nature, together with the perpetual changefulness of the  degrees of curvature in one and the same line; but although the purpose  of that plate was carefully explained in the chapter which it  illustrates, as well as in the passages of \"Modern Painters\" therein  referred to (vol. ii. pp. 43, 79), so little are we now in the habit of  considering the character of abstract lines, that it was thought by many  persons that this plate only illustrated Hogarth's reversed line of  beauty, even although the curve of the salvia leaf, which was the one  taken from that plate for future use, in architecture, was not a  reversed or serpentine curve at all. I shall now, however, I hope, be  able to show my meaning better.    Sec. IX. Fig. 1 in Plate I., opposite, is a piece of ornamentation from  a Norman-French manuscript of the thirteenth century, and fig. 2 from an  Italian one of the fifteenth. Observe in the first its stern moderation  in curvature; the gradually united lines _nearly straight_, though none  quite straight, used for its main limb, and contrasted with the bold but  simple offshoots of its leaves, and the noble spiral from which it  shoots, these in their turn opposed by the sharp trefoils and thorny  cusps. And see what a reserve of resource there is in the whole; how  easy it would have been to make the curves more palpable and the foliage  more rich, and how the noble hand has stayed itself, and refused to  grant one wave of motion more.    [Illustration: Plate I.                 TEMPERANCE AND INTEMPERANCE.                 IN CURVATURE.]    Sec. X. Then observe the other example, in which, while the same idea is  continually repeated, excitement and interest are sought for by means of  violent and continual curvatures wholly unrestrained, and rolling hither  and thither in confused wantonness. Compare the character of the  separate lines in these two examples carefully, and be assured that  wherever this redundant and luxurious curvature shows itself in  ornamentation, it is a sign of jaded energy and failing invention. Do  not confuse it with fulness or richness. Wealth is not necessarily  wantonness: a Gothic moulding may be buried half a foot deep in thorns  and leaves, and yet will be chaste in every line; and a late Renaissance  moulding may be utterly barren and poverty-stricken, and yet will show  the disposition to luxury in every line.    Sec. XI. Plate XX., in the second volume, though prepared for the special  illustration of the notices of capitals, becomes peculiarly interesting  when considered in relation to the points at present under  consideration. The four leaves in the upper row are Byzantine; the two  middle rows are transitional, all but fig. 11, which is of the formed  Gothic; fig. 12 is perfect Gothic of the finest time (Ducal Palace,  oldest part), fig. 13 is Gothic beginning to decline, fig. 14 is  Renaissance Gothic in complete corruption.    Now observe, first, the Gothic naturalism advancing gradually from the  Byzantine severity; how from the sharp, hard, formalized conventionality  of the upper series the leaves gradually expand into more free and  flexible animation, until in fig. 12 we have the perfect living leaf as  if fresh gathered out of the dew. And then, in the last two examples and  partly in fig. 11, observe how the forms which can advance no longer in  animation, advance, or rather decline, into luxury and effeminacy as the  strength of the school expires.    Sec. XII. In the second place, note that the Byzantine and Gothic schools,  however differing in degree of life, are both alike in _temperance_,  though the temperance of the Gothic is the nobler, because it consists  with entire animation. Observe how severe and subtle the curvatures are  in all the leaves from fig. 1 to fig. 12, except only in fig. 11; and  observe especially the firmness and strength obtained by the close  approximation to the straight line in the lateral ribs of the leaf, fig.  12. The longer the eye rests on these temperate curvatures the more it  will enjoy them, but it will assuredly in the end be wearied by the  morbid exaggeration of the last example.    [Illustration: Plate II.                 GOTHIC CAPITALS.]    Sec. XIII. Finally, observe--and this is very important--how one and the  same character in the work may be a sign of totally different states of  mind, and therefore in one case bad, and in the other good. The  examples, fig. 3. and fig. 12., are both equally pure in line; but one  is subdivided in the extreme, the other broad in the extreme, and both  are beautiful. The Byzantine mind delighted in the delicacy of  subdivision which nature shows in the fern-leaf or parsley-leaf; and so,  also, often the Gothic mind, much enjoying the oak, thorn, and thistle.  But the builder of the Ducal Palace used great breadth in his foliage,  in order to harmonize with the broad surface of his mighty wall, and  delighted in this breadth as nature delights in the sweeping freshness  of the dock-leaf or water-lily. Both breadth and subdivision are thus  noble, when they are contemplated or conceived by a mind in health; and  both become ignoble, when conceived by a mind jaded and satiated. The  subdivision in fig. 13 as compared with the type, fig. 12, which it was  intended to improve, is the sign, not of a mind which loved intricacy,  but of one which could not relish simplicity, which had not strength  enough to enjoy the broad masses of the earlier leaves, and cut them to  pieces idly, like a child tearing the book which, in its weariness, it  cannot read. And on the other hand, we shall continually find, in other  examples of work of the same period, an unwholesome breadth or  heaviness, which results from the mind having no longer any care for  refinement or precision, nor taking any delight in delicate forms, but  making all things blunted, cumbrous, and dead, losing at the same"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/30760"],[0,"My Private Menagerie (#2)"],[1,"the roofs, the yard, and the garden. Her  thoughts were reflected in her shifting glance, and I was able to read  in it the result of her examination: \"It is unmistakably a chicken.\"    Having reached this conclusion, she sprang from the table on which she  had posted herself to make her investigations, and crouched down in one  corner of the room, flat on her stomach, her elbows out, her head low,  her muscular backbone on the stretch, like the black panther in Gerome's  painting, watching gazelles on their way to the drinking-place.    The parrot followed her movements with feverish anxiety, fluffing out  its feathers, rattling its chain, lifting its foot, and moving its  claws, and sharpening its beak upon the edge of its seed-box. Its  instinct warned it that an enemy was preparing to attack it.    The eyes of the cat, fixed upon the bird with an intensity that had  something of fascination in it, plainly said in a language well  understood of the parrot and absolutely intelligible: \"Green though it  is, that chicken must be good to eat.\"    I watched the scene with much interest, prepared to interfere at the  proper time. Madame-Theophile had gradually crawled nearer; her pink  nose was working, her eyes were half closed, her claws were protruded  and then drawn in. She thrilled with anticipation like a gourmet sitting  down to enjoy a truffled pullet; she gloated over the thought of the  choice and succulent meal she was about to enjoy, and her sensuality was  tickled by the idea of the exotic dish that was to be hers.    Suddenly she arched her back like a bow that is being drawn, and a swift  leap landed her right on the perch. The parrot, seeing the danger upon  him, unexpectedly called out in a deep, sonorous bass voice: \"Have you  had your breakfast, Jack?\"    The words filled the cat with indescribable terror; and she leapt back.  The blast of a trumpet, the smash of a pile of crockery, or a  pistol-shot fired by her ear would not have dismayed the feline to such  an extent. All her ornithological notions were upset.    \"And what did you have?--A royal roast,\" went on the bird.    The cat's expression clearly meant: \"This is not a bird; it's a man; it  speaks.\"        \"When of claret I've drunk my fill,      The pot-house whirls and is whirling still,\"    sang out the bird with a deafening voice, for it had at once perceived  that the terror inspired by its speech was its surest means of defence.    The cat looked at me questioningly, and my reply proving unsatisfactory,  she sneaked under the bed, and refused to come out for the rest of the  day.    Those of my readers who have not been in the habit of having animals to  keep them company, and who see in them, as did Descartes, merely  machines, will no doubt think I am attributing intentions to the bird  and the quadruped, but as a matter of fact, I have merely translated  their thoughts into human speech. The next day, Madame-Theophile, having  somewhat overcome her fright, made another attempt, and was routed in  the same fashion. That was enough for her, and henceforth she remained  convinced that the bird was a man.    This dainty and lovely creature adored perfumes. She would go into  ecstasies on breathing in the patchouli and vetiver used for Cashmere  shawls. She had also a taste for music. Nestling upon a pile of scores,  she would listen most attentively and with every mark of satisfaction to  the singers who came to perform at the critic's piano. But high notes  made her nervous, and she never failed to close the singer's mouth with  her paw if the lady sang the high A. We used to try the experiment for  the fun of the thing, and it never failed once. It was quite impossible  to fool my dilettante cat on that note.          II    THE WHITE DYNASTY      Let me come to more recent times. A cat brought from Havana by Mlle.  Aita de la Penuela, a young Spanish artist whose studies of white angora  cats used to adorn and still adorn the show-windows of the  print-sellers, gave birth to the daintiest little kitten, exactly like  the puffs used for the application of face powder, which kitten was  presented to me. Its immaculate whiteness caused it to be named Pierrot,  and this appellation, when it grew up, developed into Don Pierrot of  Navarre, which was infinitely more majestic and smacked of a grandee of  Spain.    Don Pierrot, like all animals that are fondled and petted, became  delightfully amiable, and shared the life of the household with that  fulness of satisfaction cats derive from close association with the  fireside. Seated in his customary place, close to the fire, he really  looked as if he understood the conversation and was interested in it.  He followed the speakers with his eyes, and every now and then would  utter a little cry, exactly as if to object and give his own opinion  upon literature, which formed the staple of our talks. He was very fond  of books, and when he found one open on the table, he would lie down by  it, gaze attentively at the page and turn the leaves with his claws;  then he ended by going to sleep, just as if he had really been reading a  fashionable novel. As soon as I picked up my pen, he would leap upon the  desk, and watch attentively the steel nib scribbling away on the paper,  moving his head every time I began a new line. Sometimes he endeavoured  to collaborate with me, and would snatch the pen out of my hand, no  doubt with the intention of writing in his turn, for he was as aesthetic  a cat as Hoffmann's Murr. Indeed, I strongly suspect that he was in the  habit of inditing his memoirs, at night, in some gutter or another, by  the light of his own phosphorescent eyes. Unfortunately, these  lucubrations are lost.    Don Pierrot of Navarre always sat up at night until I came home, waiting  for me on the inside of the door, and as soon as I stepped into the  antechamber he would come rubbing himself against my legs, arching his  back and purring in gladsome, friendly fashion. Then he would start to  walk in front of me, preceding me like a page, and I am sure that if I  had asked him to do so, he would have carried my candle. In this way he  would escort me to my bedroom, wait until I had undressed, jump up on  the bed, put his paws round my neck, rub his nose against mine, lick me  with his tiny red tongue, rough as a file, and utter little inarticulate  cries by way of expressing unmistakably the pleasure he felt at seeing  me again. When he had sufficiently caressed me and it was time to sleep  he used to perch upon the backboard of his bed and slept there like a  bird roosting on a branch. As soon as I woke in the morning, he would  come and stretch out beside me until I rose.    Midnight was the latest time allowed for my return home. On this point  Pierrot was as inflexible as a janitor. Now, at that time I had founded,  along with a few friends, a little evening reunion called \"The Four  Candles Society,\" the place of meeting happening to be lighted by four  candles stuck in silver candlesticks placed at each corner of the table.  Occasionally the conversation became so absorbing that I would forget  the time, even at the risk of seeing, like Cinderella, my carriage turn  into a pumpkin and my coachman into a big rat. Twice or thrice Pierrot  sat up for me until two o'clock in the morning, but presently he took  offence at my conduct and went to bed without waiting for me. I was  touched by this mute protest against my innocently disorderly way of  life, and thereafter I regularly returned home at midnight. Pierrot,  however, proved hard to win back; he wanted to make sure that my  repentance was no mere passing matter, but once he was convinced that I  had really reformed, he deigned to restore me to his good graces and  again took up his nightly post in the antechamber.    It is no easy matter to win a cat's love, for cats are philosophical,  sedate, quiet animals, fond of their own way, liking cleanliness and  order, and not apt to bestow their affection hastily. They are quite  willing to be friends, if you prove worthy of their friendship, but they  decline to be slaves. They are affectionate, but they exercise free  will, and will not do for you what they consider to be unreasonable.  Once, however, they have bestowed their friendship, their trust is  absolute, and their affection most faithful. They become one's  companions in hours of solitude, sadness, and labour. A cat will stay on  your knees a whole evening, purring away, happy in your company and  careless of that of its own species. In vain do mewings sound on the  roofs, inviting it to one of the cat parties where red herring brine  takes the place of tea; it is not to be tempted and spends the evening  with you. If you put it down, it is back in a jiffy with a kind of  cooing that sounds like a gentle reproach. Sometimes, sitting up in  front of you, it looks at you so softly, so tenderly, so caressingly,  and in so human a way that it is almost terrifying, for it is impossible  to believe that there is no mind back of those eyes.    Don Pierrot of Navarre had a mate of the same breed just as white as  himself. All the expressions I have accumulated in the \"Symphony in  White Major\" for the purpose of rendering the idea of snowy whiteness  would be insufficient to give an idea of the immaculate coat of my cat,  by the side of which the ermine's fur would have looked yellow. I called  her Seraphita, after Balzac's Swedenborgian novel. Never did the heroine  of that wondrous legend, when ascending with Minna the snow-covered  summits of the Falberg, gleam more purely white. Seraphita was of a  dreamy and contemplative disposition. She would remain for hours on a  cushion, wide-awake and following with her eyes, with intensest  attention, sights invisible to ordinary mortals. She liked to be petted,  but returned caresses in a very reserved way, and only in the case of  persons whom she honoured with her approbation, "]]]
