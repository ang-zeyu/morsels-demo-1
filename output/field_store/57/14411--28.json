If _medicine_ be ranked among those arts which dignify their professors,  _cookery_ may lay claim to an equal, if not a superior, distinction; to  _prevent_ diseases is surely a more advantageous art to mankind than to  _cure_ them. \"Physicians should be good cooks, at least in theory.\"--Dr.  MANDEVILLE _on Hypochondriasis_, p. 316.    The learned Dr. ARBUTHNOT observes, in page 3 of the preface to his  _Essay on Aliment_, that \"the choice and measure of the materials of  which our body is composed, what we take daily by _pounds_, is at least  of as much importance as what we take seldom, and only by _grains_ and  spoonfuls.\"    Those in whom the organ of taste is obtuse, or who have been brought up  in the happy habit of being content with humble fare, whose health is so  firm, that it needs no artificial adjustment; who, with the appetite of  a cormorant, have the digestion of an ostrich, and eagerly devour  whatever is set before them without asking any questions about what it  is, or how it has been prepared--may perhaps imagine that the Editor has  sometimes been rather over-much refining the business of the kitchen.        \"Where ignorance is bliss, 'tis folly to be wise.\"    But as few are so fortunate as to be trained up to understand how well  it is worth their while to cultivate such habits of Spartan forbearance,  we cannot perform our duty in registering wholesome precepts, in a  higher degree, than by disarming luxury of its sting, and making the  refinements of Modern Cookery minister not merely to sensual  gratification, but at the same time support the substantial excitement  of \"mens sana in corpore sano.\"    _Delicate and nervous invalids_, who have unfortunately a sensitive  palate, and have been accustomed to a luxurious variety of savoury  sauces, and highly seasoned viands; those who, from the infirmity of  age, are become incapable of correcting habits created by absurd  indulgence in youth, are entitled to some consideration; and, for their  sake, the _Elements of Opsology_ are explained in the most intelligent  manner; and I have assisted the memory of young cooks, by annexing to  each dish the various sauces which usually accompany it, referring to  their numbers in the work.    Some idle idiots have remarked to the Author, that \"there were really so  many _references_ from one receipt to another, that it is exceedingly  troublesome indeed; they are directed sometimes to turn to half a dozen  numbers:\" this is quite true. If the Author had not adopted this plan of  _reference_, his book, to be equally explicit, must have been ten times  as big; his object has been to give as much information as possible in  as few pages, and for as few pence, as possible.    By reducing culinary operations to something like a certainty,  _invalids_ will no longer be entirely indebted to chance, whether they  shall recover and live long, and comfortably, or speedily die of  starvation in the midst of plenty.    These rules and orders for the regulation of the business of the kitchen  have been extremely beneficial to the Editor's own health and comfort.  He hopes they will be equally so to others: they will help those who  enjoy health to preserve it; teach those who have delicate and irritable  stomachs how to keep them in good temper; and, with a little  discretion, enable them to indulge occasionally, not only with impunity,  but with advantage, in all those alimentary pleasures which a rational  epicure can desire.    There is no question more frequently asked, or which a medical man finds  more difficulty in answering, to the satisfaction of himself and his  patient, than--_What do you wish me to eat?_    The most judicious choice of aliment will avail nothing, unless the  culinary preparation of it be equally judicious. How often is the skill  of a pains-taking physician counteracted by want of corresponding  attention to the preparation of food; and the poor patient, instead of  deriving nourishment, is distressed by indigestion!    PARMENTIER, in his _Code Pharmaceutique_, has given a chapter on the  preparation of food: some of the following receipts are offered as an  humble attempt to form a sort of _Appendix to the Pharmacopoeia_, and  like pharmaceutic prescriptions, they are precisely adjusted by _weight_  and _measure_. The author of a cookery book, first published in 1824,  has claimed this act of industry of mine as his own original invention;  the only notice I shall take of his pretensions is to say, that the  first edition of \"_The Cook's Oracle_\" appeared in 1817.    By ordering such receipts of the _Cook's Oracle_ as appear adapted to  the case, the recovery of the patient and the credit of the physician,  as far as relates to the administration of aliment, need no longer  depend on the discretion of the cook. For instance: _Mutton Broth_, No.  490, or No. 564; _Toast and Water_, No. 463; _Water Gruel_, No. 572;  _Beef Tea_, No. 563; and _Portable Soup_, No. 252. This concentrated  _Essence of Meat_ will be found a great acquisition to the comfort of  the army, the navy, the traveller, and the invalid. By dissolving half  an ounce of it in half a pint of hot water, you have in a few minutes  _half a pint of good Broth for three halfpence_. The utility of such  accurate and precise directions for preparing food, is to _travellers_  incalculable; for, by translating the receipt, any person may prepare  what is desired as perfectly as a good English cook.    He has also circumstantially detailed the easiest, least expensive, and  most salubrious methods of preparing those highly finished soups,  sauces, ragouts, and _piquante_ relishes, which the most ingenious  \"officers of the mouth\" have invented for the amusement of thorough-bred  \"_grands gourmands_.\"    It has been his aim to render food acceptable to the palate, without  being expensive to the purse, or offensive to the stomach; nourishing  without being inflammatory, and savoury without being surfeiting;  constantly endeavouring to hold the balance equal, between the agreeable  and the wholesome, the epicure and the economist.    _He has not presumed to recommend one receipt that has not been  previously and repeatedly proved in his own kitchen_, which has not been  approved by the most accomplished cooks; and has, moreover, been eaten  with unanimous applause by _a Committee of Taste_, composed of some of  the most illustrious gastropholists of this luxurious metropolis.    The Editor has been materially assisted by Mr. Henry Osborne, the  excellent cook to the late Sir Joseph Banks; that worthy President of  the Royal Society was so sensible of the importance of the subject the  Editor was investigating, that he sent his cook to assist him in his  arduous task; and many of the receipts in this edition are much improved  by his suggestions and corrections. See No. 560.    _This is the only English Cookery Book_ which has been written from the  real experiments of a _housekeeper_ for the benefit of _housekeepers_;  which the reader will soon perceive by the minute attention that has  been employed to elucidate and improve the _Art of Plain Cookery_;  detailing many particulars and precautions, which may at first appear  frivolous, but which experience will prove to be essential: to teach a  common cook how to provide, and to prepare, common food so frugally, and  so perfectly, that _the plain every-day family fare of the most  economical housekeeper_, may, with scarcely additional expense, or any  additional trouble, be _a satisfactory entertainment for an epicure or  an invalid_.    By an attentive consideration of \"_the Rudiments of Cookery_,\" and the  respective receipts, the most _ignorant novice_ in the business of the  kitchen, may work with the utmost facility and certainty of success, and  soon become _a good cook_.    Will all the other books of cookery that ever were printed do this? To  give his readers an idea of the immense labour attendant upon this Work,  it may be only necessary for the Author to state, that he has patiently  pioneered through more than _two hundred cookery books_ before he set  about recording these results of his own experiments! The table of _the  most economical family_ may, by the help of this book, be entertained  with as much elegance as that of _a sovereign prince_.    LONDON, 1829.

The Yellow Handkerchief hesitated; but I repeated  the order fiercely (much more fiercely than I felt), at the same time  sending my hand to my hip. Again the Yellow Handkerchief was overawed,  and with surly looks he led three of his men aboard the _Reindeer_. I  cast off at once, and, leaving the jib down, steered a course for  George's junk. Here it was easier, for there were two of us, and George  had a pistol to fall back on if it came to the worst. And here, as with  my junk, four Chinese were transferred to the sloop and one left behind  to take care of things.    Four more were added to our passenger list from the third junk. By this  time the salmon boat had collected its twelve prisoners and came  alongside, badly overloaded. To make matters worse, as it was a small  boat, the patrolmen were so jammed in with their prisoners that they  would have little chance in case of trouble.    \"You'll have to help us out,\" said Le Grant.    I looked over my prisoners, who had crowded into the cabin and on top  of it. \"I can take three,\" I answered.    \"Make it four,\" he suggested, \"and I'll take Bill with me.\" (Bill was  the third patrolman.) \"We haven't elbow room here, and in case of a  scuffle one white to every two of them will be just about the right  proportion.\"    The exchange was made, and the salmon boat got up its spritsail and  headed down the bay toward the marshes off San Rafael. I ran up the jib  and followed with the _Reindeer_. San Rafael, where we were to turn our  catch over to the authorities, communicated with the bay by way of a  long and tortuous slough, or marshland creek, which could be navigated  only when the tide was in. Slack water had come, and, as the ebb was  commencing, there was need for hurry if we cared to escape waiting half  a day for the next tide.    But the land breeze had begun to die away with the rising sun, and now  came only in failing puffs. The salmon boat got out its oars and soon  left us far astern. Some of the Chinese stood in the forward part of  the cockpit, near the cabin doors, and once, as I leaned over the  cockpit rail to flatten down the jib-sheet a bit, I felt some one brush  against my hip pocket. I made no sign, but out of the corner of my eye  I saw that the Yellow Handkerchief had discovered the emptiness of the  pocket which had hitherto overawed him.    To make matters serious, during all the excitement of boarding the  junks the _Reindeer_ had not been bailed, and the water was beginning  to slush over the cockpit floor. The shrimp-catchers pointed at it and  looked to me questioningly.    \"Yes,\" I said. \"Bime by, allee same dlown, velly quick, you no bail  now. Sabbe?\"    No, they did not \"sabbe,\" or at least they shook their heads to that  effect, though they chattered most comprehendingly to one another in  their own lingo. I pulled up three or four of the bottom boards, got a  couple of buckets from a locker, and by unmistakable sign-language  invited them to fall to. But they laughed, and some crowded into the  cabin and some climbed up on top.    Their laughter was not good laughter. There was a hint of menace in it,  a maliciousness which their black looks verified. The Yellow  Handkerchief, since his discovery of my empty pocket, had become most  insolent in his bearing, and he wormed about among the other prisoners,  talking to them with great earnestness.    Swallowing my chagrin, I stepped down into the cockpit and began  throwing out the water. But hardly had I begun, when the boom swung  overhead, the mainsail filled with a jerk, and the _Reindeer_ heeled  over. The day wind was springing up. George was the veriest of  landlubbers, so I was forced to give over bailing and take the tiller.  The wind was blowing directly off Point Pedro and the high mountains  behind, and because of this was squally and uncertain, half the time  bellying the canvas out, and the other half flapping it idly.    George was about the most all-round helpless man I had ever met. Among  his other disabilities, he was a consumptive, and I knew that if he  attempted to bail, it might bring on a hemorrhage. Yet the rising water  warned me that something must be done. Again I ordered the  shrimp-catchers to lend a hand with the buckets. They laughed defiantly,  and those inside the cabin, the water up to their ankles, shouted back  and forth with those on top.    \"You'd better get out your gun and make them bail,\" I said to George.    But he shook his head and showed all too plainly that he was afraid.  The Chinese could see the funk he was in as well as I could, and their  insolence became insufferable. Those in the cabin broke into the food  lockers, and those above scrambled down and joined them in a feast on  our crackers and canned goods.    \"What do we care?\" George said weakly.    I was fuming with helpless anger. \"If they get out of hand, it will be  too late to care. The best thing you can do is to get them in check  right now.\"    The water was rising higher and higher, and the gusts, forerunners of a  steady breeze, were growing stiffer and stiffer. And between the gusts,  the prisoners, having gotten away with a week's grub, took to crowding  first to one side and then to the other till the _Reindeer_ rocked like  a cockle-shell. Yellow Handkerchief approached me, and, pointing out  his village on the Point Pedro beach, gave me to understand that if I  turned the _Reindeer_ in that direction and put them ashore, they, in  turn, would go to bailing. By now the water in the cabin was up to the  bunks, and the bed-clothes were sopping. It was a foot deep on the  cockpit floor. Nevertheless I refused, and I could see by George's face  that he was disappointed.    \"If you don't show some nerve, they'll rush us and throw us overboard,\"  I said to him. \"Better give me your revolver, if you want to be safe.\"    \"The safest thing to do,\" he chattered cravenly, \"is to put them  ashore. I, for one, don't want to be drowned for the sake of a handful  of dirty Chinamen.\"    \"And I, for another, don't care to give in to a handful of dirty  Chinamen to escape drowning,\" I answered hotly.    \"You'll sink the _Reindeer_ under us all at this rate,\" he whined. \"And  what good that'll do I can't see.\"    \"Every man to his taste,\" I retorted.    He made no reply, but I could see he was trembling pitifully. Between  the threatening Chinese and the rising water he was beside himself with  fright; and, more than the Chinese and the water, I feared him and what  his fright might impel him to do. I could see him casting longing  glances at the small skiff towing astern, so in the next calm I hauled  the skiff alongside. As I did so his eyes brightened with hope; but  before he could guess my intention, I stove the frail bottom through  with a hand-axe, and the skiff filled to its gunwales.    \"It's sink or float together,\" I said. \"And if you'll give me your  revolver, I'll have the _Reindeer_ bailed out in a jiffy.\"    \"They're too many for us,\" he whimpered. \"We can't fight them all.\"    I turned my back on him in disgust. The salmon boat had long since  passed from sight behind a little archipelago known as the Marin  Islands, so no help could be looked for from that quarter. Yellow  Handkerchief came up to me in a familiar manner, the water in the  cockpit slushing against his legs. I did not like his looks. I felt that  beneath the pleasant smile he was trying to put on his face there was an  ill purpose. I ordered him back, and so sharply that he obeyed.    \"Now keep your distance,\" I commanded, \"and don't you come closer!\"    \"Wha' fo'?\" he demanded indignantly. \"I t'ink-um talkee talkee heap  good.\"    \"Talkee talkee,\" I answered bitterly, for I knew now that he had  understood all that passed between George and me. \"What for talkee  talkee? You no sabbe talkee talkee.\"    He grinned in a sickly fashion. \"Yep, I sabbe velly much. I honest  Chinaman.\"    \"All right,\" I answered. \"You sabbe talkee talkee, then you bail water  plenty plenty. After that we talkee talkee.\"    He shook his head, at the same time pointing over his shoulder to his  comrades. \"No can do. Velly bad Chinamen, heap velly bad. I t'ink-um--\"    \"Stand back!\" I shouted, for I had noticed his hand disappear beneath  his blouse and his body prepare for a spring.    Disconcerted, he went back into the cabin, to hold a council,  apparently, from the way the jabbering broke forth. The _Reindeer_ was  very deep in the water, and her movements had grown quite loggy. In a  rough sea she would have inevitably swamped; but the wind, when it did  blow, was off the land, and scarcely a ripple disturbed the surface of  the bay.    \"I think you'd better head for the beach,\" George said abruptly, in a  manner that told me his fear had forced him to make up his mind to some  course of action.    \"I think not,\" I answered shortly.    \"I command you,\" he said in a bullying tone.    \"I was commanded to bring these prisoners into San Rafael,\" was my  reply.    Our voices were raised, and the sound of the altercation brought the  Chinese out of the cabin.    \"Now will you head for the beach?\"    This from George, and I found myself looking into the muzzle of his  revolver--of the revolver he dared to use on me, but was too cowardly  to use on the prisoners.    My brain seemed smitten with a dazzling brightness. The whole situation,  in all its bearings, was focussed sharply before me--the shame of  losing the prisoners, the worthlessness and cowardice of George, the  meeting with Le Grant and the other patrol-men and the lame explanation;  and then there was the fight I had fought so hard, victory wrenched  from me just as I thought I had it within my grasp. And out of the tail  of my eye I could see the Chinese crowding together by the cabin doors  and leering triumphantly. It"]]]
