[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/2442"],[0,"History of the Impeachment of Andrew Johnson, President of the United States, (#2)"],[1," already lasted twenty  months, and there had been many conflicts on both land and sea, with  varying results. The rebellion had been pressed back into reduced  limits; yet the tone of public feeling and opinion, at home and abroad,  was not satisfactory. With other signs, the popular elections, then just  past, indicated uneasiness among ourselves, while, amid much that was  cold and menacing, the kindest words coming from Europe were uttered in  accents of pity that we were too blind to surrender a hopeless cause.  Our commerce was suffering greatly by a few armed vessels built upon  and furnished from foreign shores; and we were threatened with such  additions from the same quarter as would sweep our trade from the  sea and raise our blockade. We had failed to elicit from European  Governments anything hopeful upon this subject. The preliminary  Emancipation Proclamation, issued in September, was running its assigned  period to the beginning of the new year. A month later that final  proclamation came, including the announcement that colored men of  suitable condition would be received into the army service. The policy  of emancipation, and of employing black soldiers, gave to the future a  new aspect, about which hope and fear and doubt contended in uncertain  conflict. According to our political system, as a matter of civil  administration, the General Government had no lawful power to effect  emancipation in any State; and for a long time it had been hoped that  the rebellion could be suppressed without resorting to it as a military  measure. It was all the while deemed possible that the necessity for it  might come, and that, if it should, the crisis of the contest would then  be presented. It came, and, as was anticipated, was followed by dark and  doubtful days. Eleven months have now passed, and we are permitted to  take another review. The rebel borders are pressed still further back,  and by the complete opening of the Mississippi the country dominated  by the rebellion is divided into distinct parts, with no practical  communication between them. Tennessee and Arkansas have been  substantially cleared of insurgent control, and influential citizens in  each, owners of slaves and advocates of slavery at the beginning of  the rebellion, now declare openly for emancipation in their respective  States. Of those States not included in the Emancipation Proclamation,  Maryland and Missouri, neither of which three years ago would tolerate  any restraint upon the extension of slavery into the new Territories,  only dispute now as to the best mode of removing it within their own  limits.    Of those who were slaves at the beginning of the rebellion, full one  hundred thousand are now in the United States military service; about  one half of which number actually bear arms in the ranks; thus giving  the double advantage of taking so much labor from the insurgent cause,  and supplying the places which must otherwise be filled with so many  white men. So far as tested, it is difficult to say they are not as good  soldiers as any. No servile insurrection, or tendency to violence or  cruelty, has marked the measure of emancipation and arming the  blacks. Those measures have been discussed in foreign countries, and  contemporary with such discussion the tone of sentiment there is much  improved. At home the same measures have been fully discussed, and  supported, criticised, and denounced, and the annual elections following  are highly encouraging to those whose official duty it is to bear the  country through this great trial. Thus we have the new reckoning. The  crisis which threatened to divide the friends of the Union is past.    Looking now to the present, and future, and with reference to a  resumption of national authority within the States wherein that  authority has been suspended, I have thought fit to issue a  Proclamation, a copy of which is herewith transmitted. On examination  of this Proclamation it will appear, as is believed, that nothing is  attempted beyond what is amply justified by the Constitution. True, the  form of an oath is given, but no man is coerced to take it. The man  is only promised a pardon in case he voluntarily takes the oath. The  Constitution authorizes the Executive to grant or withhold the pardon  at his own absolute discretion, and this includes the power to grant on  terms, as is fully established by judicial and other authorities.    It is also proffered that, if in any of the States named a State  Government shall be, in the mode prescribed, set up, such Government  shall be recognized and guaranteed by the United States, and that under  it the State shall, on the constitutional conditions, be protected  against invasion and domestic violence. The constitutional obligation of  the United States to guarantee to every State in the Union a republican  form of government, and to protect the State, in the cases stated, is  explicit and full. But why tender the benefits of this provision only  to a State Government set up in this particular way? This section  contemplates a case wherein the element within a State favorable to a  republican government, in the Union, may be too feeble for an opposite  and hostile external to or even within the State; and such are precisely  the cases with which we are dealing.    Any attempt to guaranty and protect a revived State Government,  constituted in whole, or in preponderating part, from the very element  against whose hostility it is to be protected, is simply absurd. There  must be a test by which to separate the opposing elements, so as to  build only from the sound; and that test is a sufficiently liberal one  which accepts as sound whoever will make a sworn recantation of his  former unsoundness.    But if it be proper to require, as a test of admission to the political  body, an oath of allegiance to the Constitution of the United States,  and to the Union under it, why also to the laws and Proclamation in  regard to slavery? Those laws and Proclamations were enacted and put  forth for the purpose of aiding in the suppression of the rebellion.  To give them their fullest effect, there had to be a pledge--for their  maintenance. In my judgment they have aided, and will further aid, the  cause for which they were intended. To now abandon them would be not  only to relinquish a lever of power, but would also be a cruel and an  astounding breach of faith. I may add at this point, that while I remain  in my present position, I shall not attempt to retract or modify the  Emancipation Proclamation; nor shall I return to slavery any person  who is free by the terms of the Proclamation, or by any of the acts of  Congress. For these and other reasons it is thought best that support  of these measures shall be included in the oath; and it is believed the  Executive may lawfully claim it in return for pardon and restoration  of forfeited rights, when he has clear constitutional power to withhold  altogether or grant upon terms which he shall deem wisest for the public  interest. It should be observed, also, that this part of the oath is  subject to the modifying and abrogating power of legislation and supreme  judicial decision.    The proposed acquiescence of the National Executive in any reasonable  temporary State arrangement for the freed people is made with the view  of possibly modifying the confusion and destitution which must, at  best, attend all classes by a total revolution of labor throughout whole  States. It is hoped that the already deeply afflicted people of  those States may be somewhat more ready to give up the cause of their  affliction, if, to this extent, this vital matter be left to themselves;  while no power of the National Executive to prevent an abuse is abridged  by the proposition.    The suggestion in the Proclamation as to maintaining the political  frame-work of those States on what is called reconstruction, is made in  the hope that it may do good without danger of harm. It will save labor  and avoid great confusion.    But why any proclamation on this subject? This question is beset with  the conflicting views that the step might be delayed too long or taken  too soon. In some States the elements for resumption seem ready for  action, but remain inactive apparently for want of a rallying point. Why  shall A. adopt the plan of B., rather than B. that of A.? And if A. and  B. should agree, how can they know but that the General Government here  will reject their plan? By the Proclamation a plan is presented which  may be accepted by them as a rallying point, and which they may be  assured in advance will not be rejected here. This may bring them to act  sooner than they otherwise would.    The objection to a premature presentation of a plan by the National  Executive consists in the danger of committals on points which could  be more safely left to further developments. Care has been taken to so  shape the document as to avoid embarrassment from this source. Saying  that, on certain terms, certain classes will be pardoned, with rights  restored, it is not said that other classes on other terms will never be  included. Saying that reconstruction will be accepted if presented in  a specified way, it is not saying it will not be accepted in any other  way.    The movements, by State action, for emancipation in several of the  States not included in the Emancipation Proclamation, are matters of  profound gratulation, and while I do not repeat in detail what I have  heretofore so earnestly urged upon this subject, my general views and  feelings remain unchanged, and I trust that Congress will omit no fair  opportunity of aiding these important steps to a great consummation.    In the midst of other cares, however important, we must not lose sight  of the fact that the war power is still our main reliance. To that power  alone can we look, for a time, to give confidence to the people in the  contested regions that"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/24420"],[0,"The Story of Frithiof the Bold (#2)"],[1,"Baldur's Meads and  to Ingibiorg's bower, and there she sat with eight maidens, and the new  comers were eight also.    But when they came there, lo, all the place was hung with cloth of pall  and precious webs.    Then Ingibiorg arose and said:    \"Why art thou so overbold, Frithiof, that thou art come here without the  leave of my brethren to make the gods angry with thee?\"    Frithiof says: \"Howsoever that may be, I hold thy love of more account  than the gods' hate.\"    Ingibiorg answered: \"Welcome art thou here, thou and thy men!\"    Then she made place for him to sit beside her, and drank to him in the  best of wine; and thus they sat and were merry together.    Then beheld Ingibiorg the goodly ring on his arm, and asked him if that  precious thing were his own.    Frithiof said Yea, and she praised the ring much. Then Frithiof said:    \"I will give thee the ring if thou wilt promise to give it to no one,  but to send it to me when thou no longer shalt have will to keep it: and  hereon shall we plight troth each to other.\"    So with this troth-plighting they exchanged rings.    Frithiof was oft at Baldur's Meads a-night time, and every day between  whiles would he go thither to be glad with Ingibiorg.          CHAPTER V.     Those Brethren come Home again.    Now tells the tale of those brethren, that they met King Ring, and he  had more folk than they: then went men betwixt them, and sought to make  peace, so that no battle should be: thereto King Ring assented on such  terms that the brethren should submit them to him, and give him in  marriage Ingibiorg their sister, with the third part of all their  possessions.    The kings said Yea thereto, for they saw that they had to do with  overwhelming might: so the peace was fast bound by oaths, and the  wedding was to be at Sogn whenas King Ring should go see his betrothed.    So those brethren fare home with their folk, right ill content with  things. But Frithiof, when he deemed that the brethren might be looked  for home again, spake to the king's daughter:    \"Sweetly and well have ye done to us, neither has goodman Baldur been  wroth with us; but now as soon as ye wot of the kings' coming home,  spread the sheets of your beds abroad on the Hall of the Goddesses, for  that is the highest of all the garth, and we may see it from our stead.\"    The king's daughter said: \"Thou dost not after the like of any other:  but certes, we welcome dear friends whenas ye come to us.\"    So Frithiof went home; and the next morning he went out early, and when  he came in then he spake and sang:              \"Now must I tell            To our good men            That over and done            Are our fair journeys;            No more a-shipboard            Shall we be going,            For there are the sheets            Spread out a-bleaching.\"    Then they went out, and saw that the Hall of the Goddesses was all  thatched with white linen. Biorn spake and said: \"Now are the kings come  home, and but a little while have we to sit in peace, and good were it,  meseems, to gather folk together.\"    So did they, and men came flocking thither.    Now the brethren soon heard of the ways of Frithiof and Ingibiorg, and  of the gathering of men. So King Helgi spake:    \"A wondrous thing how Baldur will bear what shame soever Frithiof and  she will lay on him! Now will I send men to him, and wot what atonement  he will offer us, or else will I drive him from the land, for our  strength seemeth to me not enough that we should fight with him as now.\"    So Hilding, their fosterer, bare the king's errand to Frithiof and his  friends, and spake in such wise: \"This atonement the kings will have of  thee, Frithiof, that thou go gather the tribute of the Orkneys, which  has not been paid since Beli died, for they need money, whereas they are  giving Ingibiorg their sister in marriage, and much of wealth with her.\"    Frithiof said: \"This thing only somewhat urges us to peace, the good  will of our kin departed; but no trustiness will those brethren show  herein. But this condition I make, that our lands be in good peace while  we are away.\" So this was promised and all bound by oaths.    Then Frithiof arrays him for departing, and is captain of men brave and  of good help, eighteen in company.    Now his men asked him if he would not go to King Helgi and make peace  with him, and pray himself free from Baldur's wrath.    But he answered: \"Hereby I swear that I will never pray Helgi for  peace.\"    Then he went aboard Ellidi, and they sailed out along the Sognnrth.    But when Frithiof was gone from home, King Halfdan spake to Helgi his  brother: \"Better lordship and more had we if Frithiof had payment for  his masterful deed: now therefore let us burn his stead, and bring on  him and his men such a storm on the sea as shall make an end of them.\"    Helgi said it was a thing meet to be done.    So then they burned up clean all the stead at Foreness and robbed it of  all goods; and after that sent for two witch-wives, Heidi and Hamglom,  and gave them money to raise against Frithiof and his men so mighty a  storm that they should all be lost at sea. So they sped the witch-song,  and went up on the witch-mount with spells and sorcery.          CHAPTER VI.     Frithiof Sails for the Orkneys.    SO when Frithiof and his men were come out of the Sognfirth there fell  on them great wind and storm, and an exceeding heavy sea: but the ship  drave on swiftly, for sharp built she was, and the best to breast the  sea.    So now Frithiof sang:--              \"Oft let I swim from Sogn            My tarred ship sooty-sided,            When maids sat o'er the mead-horn            Amidst of Baldur's Meadows;            Now while the storm is wailing            Farewell I bid you maidens,            Still shall ye love us, sweet ones,            Though Ellidi the sea fill.\"    Said Biorn: \"Thou mightest well find other work to do than singing songs  over the maids of Baldur's Meadows.\"    \"Of such work shall I not speedily run dry, though,\" said Frithiof.  Then they bore up north to the sounds nigh those isles that are called  Solundir, and therewith was the gale at its hardest.    Then sang Frithiof:              \"Now is the sea a-swelling,            And sweepeth the rack onward;            Spells of old days cast o'er us            Make ocean all unquiet;            No more shall we be striving            Mid storm with wash of billows,            But Solundir shall shelter            Our ship with ice-beat rock-walls.\"    So they lay to under the lee of the isles hight Solundir, and were  minded to abide there; but straightway thereon the wind fell: then they  turned away from under the lee of the islands, and now their voyage  seemed hopeful to them, because the wind was fair awhile: but soon it  began to freshen again.    Then sang Frithiof:              \"In days foredone            From Foreness strand            I rowed to meet            Maid Ingibiorg;            But now I sail            Through chilly storm            And wide away            My long-worm driveth.\"    And now when they were come far out into the main, once more the sea  waxed wondrous troubled, and a storm arose with so great drift of snow,  that none might see the stem from the stern; and they shipped seas, so  that they must be ever a-baling. So Frithiof sang:              \"The salt waves see we nought            As seaward drive we ever            Before the witch-wrought weather,            We well-famed kings'-defenders:            Here are we all a-standing,            With all Solundir hull-down,            Eighteen brave lads a-baling            Black Ellidi to bring home.\"    Said Biorn: \"Needs must he who fareth far fall in with diverse hap.\"    \"Yea, certes, foster-brother,\" said Frithiof. And he sang withal:              \"Helgi it is that helpeth            The white-head billows' waxing;            Cold time unlike the kissing            In the close of Baldut's Meadow!            So is the hate of Helgi            To that heart's love she giveth.            O would that here I held her,            Gift high above all giving!\"    \"Maybe,\" said Biorn, \"she is looking higher than thou now art: what  matter when all is said?\"    \"Well,\" says Frithiof, \"now is the time to show ourselves to be men of  avail, though blither tide it was at Baldur's Meadows.\"    So they turned to in manly wise, for there were the bravest of men come  together in the best ship of the Northlands. But Frithiof sang a stave:              \"So come in the West-sea,            Nought see I the billows,            The sea-water seemeth            As sweeping of wild-fire.            Topple the rollers,            Toss the hills swan-white,            Ellidi wallows            O'er steep of the wave-hills.\"    Then they shipped a huge sea, so that all stood a-baling. But Frithiof  sang:              \"With love-moved mouth the maiden            Mepledgeth though I founder.            Ah! bright sheets lay a-bleaching,            East there on brents the swan loves.\"    Biorn said: \"Art thou of mind belike that the maids of Sogn will weep  many tears over thee?\"    Said Frithiof: \"Surely that was in my mind.\"    Therewith so great a sea broke over the bows, that the water came in  like the in-falling of a river; but it availed them much that the ship  was so good, and the crew aboard her so hardy.    Now sang Biorn:              \"No widow, methinks,            To thee or me drinks;            No ring-bearer fair            Biddeth draw near;            Salt are our eyne            Soaked in the brine;            Strong our arms are no more,            And our eyelids smart sore.\"    Quoth Asmund: \"Small harm though your arms be tried somewhat, for no  pity we had from you when we rubbed our eyes whenas ye must needs rise  early a-mornings to go to Baldu's Meadows.\"    \"Well,\" said Frithiof, \"why singest thou not, Asmund?\"    \"Not I,\" said"]]]
