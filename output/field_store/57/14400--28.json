This indifference may be attributed to many causes, but it was due  first to the fact that the religious beliefs of our pagan ancestors  were not held with any real tenacity. Hence the success of the  more or less considered policy of the early Christian missionaries  to confuse the heathen beliefs, and merge them in the new faith,  an interesting example of which is to be seen in the transference  to the Christian festival of Easter of the attributes of the pagan  goddess Eastre, from whom it took even the name. Northern mythology  was in this way arrested ere it had attained its full development,  and the progress of Christianity eventually relegated it to the limbo  of forgotten things. Its comprehensive and intelligent scheme, however,  in strong contrast with the disconnected mythology of Greece and Rome,  formed the basis of a more or less rational faith which prepared the  Norseman to receive the teaching of Christianity, and so helped to  bring about its own undoing.    The religious beliefs of the North are not mirrored with any  exactitude in the Elder Edda. Indeed only a travesty of the faith of  our ancestors has been preserved in Norse literature. The early poet  loved allegory, and his imagination rioted among the conceptions of  his fertile muse. \"His eye was fixed on the mountains till the snowy  peaks assumed human features and the giant of the rock or the ice  descended with heavy tread; or he would gaze at the splendour of the  spring, or of the summer fields, till Freya with the gleaming necklace  stepped forth, or Sif with the flowing locks of gold.\" [4]    We are told nothing as to sacrificial and religious rites, and  all else is omitted which does not provide material for artistic  treatment. The so-called Northern Mythology, therefore, may be regarded  as a precious relic of the beginning of Northern poetry, rather than  as a representation of the religious beliefs of the Scandinavians,  and these literary fragments bear many signs of the transitional stage  wherein the confusion of the old and new faiths is easily apparent.    But notwithstanding the limitations imposed by long neglect it is  possible to reconstruct in part a plan of the ancient Norse beliefs,  and the general reader will derive much profit from Carlyle's  illuminating study in \"Heroes and Hero-worship.\" \"A bewildering,  inextricable jungle of delusions, confusions, falsehoods and  absurdities, covering the whole field of Life!\" he calls them,  with all good reason. But he goes on to show, with equal truth,  that at the soul of this crude worship of distorted nature was a  spiritual force seeking expression. What we probe without reverence  they viewed with awe, and not understanding it, straightway deified  it, as all children have been apt to do in all stages of the world's  history. Truly they were hero-worshippers after Carlyle's own heart,  and scepticism had no place in their simple philosophy.    It was the infancy of thought gazing upon a universe filled with  divinity, and believing heartily with all sincerity. A large-hearted  people reaching out in the dark towards ideals which were better than  they knew. Ragnarok was to undo their gods because they had stumbled  from their higher standards.    We have to thank a curious phenomenon for the preservation of so much  of the old lore as we still possess. While foreign influences were  corrupting the Norse language, it remained practically unaltered in  Iceland, which had been colonised from the mainland by the Norsemen  who had fled thither to escape the oppression of Harold Fairhair after  his crushing victory of Hafrsfirth. These people brought with them the  poetic genius which had already manifested itself, and it took fresh  root in that barren soil. Many of the old Norse poets were natives  of Iceland, and in the early part of the Christian era, a supreme  service was rendered to Norse literature by the Christian priest,  Saemund, who industriously brought together a large amount of pagan  poetry in a collection known as the Elder Edda, which is the chief  foundation of our present knowledge of the religion of our Norse  ancestors. Icelandic literature remained a sealed book, however,  until the end of the eighteenth century, and very slowly since that  time it has been winning its way in the teeth of indifference, until  there are now signs that it will eventually come into its own. \"To  know the old Faith,\" says Carlyle, \"brings us into closer and clearer  relation with the Past--with our own possessions in the Past. For  the whole Past is the possession of the Present; the Past had always  something true, and is a precious possession.\"    The weighty words of William Morris regarding the Volsunga Saga  may also be fitly quoted as an introduction to the whole of this  collection of \"Myths of the Norsemen\": \"This is the great story of  the North, which should be to all our race what the Tale of Troy was  to the Greeks--to all our race first, and afterwards, when the change  of the world has made our race nothing more than a name of what has  been--a story too--then should it be to those that come after us no  less than the Tale of Troy has been to us.\"              CHAPTER I: THE BEGINNING      Myths of Creation    Although the Aryan inhabitants of Northern Europe are supposed by some  authorities to have come originally from the plateau of Iran, in the  heart of Asia, the climate and scenery of the countries where they  finally settled had great influence in shaping their early religious  beliefs, as well as in ordering their mode of living.    The grand and rugged landscapes of Northern Europe, the midnight  sun, the flashing rays of the aurora borealis, the ocean continually  lashing itself into fury against the great cliffs and icebergs of  the Arctic Circle, could not but impress the people as vividly as  the almost miraculous vegetation, the perpetual light, and the blue  seas and skies of their brief summer season. It is no great wonder,  therefore, that the Icelanders, for instance, to whom we owe the most  perfect records of this belief, fancied in looking about them that the  world was originally created from a strange mixture of fire and ice.    Northern mythology is grand and tragical. Its principal theme is the  perpetual struggle of the beneficent forces of Nature against the  injurious, and hence it is not graceful and idyllic in character,  like the religion of the sunny South, where the people could bask  in perpetual sunshine, and the fruits of the earth grew ready to  their hand.    It was very natural that the dangers incurred in hunting and fishing  under these inclement skies, and the suffering entailed by the long  cold winters when the sun never shines, made our ancestors contemplate  cold and ice as malevolent spirits; and it was with equal reason that  they invoked with special fervour the beneficent influences of heat  and light.    When questioned concerning the creation of the world, the Northern  scalds, or poets, whose songs are preserved in the Eddas and Sagas,  declared that in the beginning, when there was as yet no earth, nor  sea, nor air, when darkness rested over all, there existed a powerful  being called Allfather, whom they dimly conceived as uncreated as  well as unseen, and that whatever he willed came to pass.    In the centre of space there was, in the morning of time, a great  abyss called Ginnunga-gap, the cleft of clefts, the yawning gulf,  whose depths no eye could fathom, as it was enveloped in perpetual  twilight. North of this abode was a space or world known as Nifl-heim,  the home of mist and darkness, in the centre of which bubbled the  exhaustless spring Hvergelmir, the seething cauldron, whose waters  supplied twelve great streams known as the Elivagar. As the water of  these streams flowed swiftly away from its source and encountered  the cold blasts from the yawning gulf, it soon hardened into huge  blocks of ice, which rolled downward into the immeasurable depths of  the great abyss with a continual roar like thunder.    South of this dark chasm, and directly opposite Nifl-heim, the realm  of mist, was another world called Muspells-heim, the home of elemental  fire, where all was warmth and brightness, and whose frontiers were  continually guarded by Surtr, the flame giant. This giant fiercely  brandished his flashing sword, and continually sent forth great showers  of sparks, which fell with a hissing sound upon the ice-blocks in  the bottom of the abyss, and partly melted them by their heat.          \"Great Surtur, with his burning sword,      Southward at Muspel's gate kept ward,      And flashes of celestial flame,      Life-giving, from the fire-world came.\"                Valhalla (J. C. Jones).        Ymir and Audhumla    As the steam rose in clouds it again encountered the prevailing cold,  and was changed into rime or hoarfrost, which, layer by layer, filled  up the great central space. Thus by the continual action of cold and  heat, and also probably by the will of the uncreated and unseen,  a gigantic creature called Ymir or Orgelmir (seething clay), the  personification of the frozen ocean, came to life amid the ice-blocks  in the abyss, and as he was born of rime he was called a Hrim-thurs,  or ice-giant.          \"In early times,      When Ymir lived,      Was sand, nor sea,      Nor cooling wave;      No earth was found,      Nor heaven above;      One chaos all,      And nowhere grass.\"                Saemund's Edda (Henderson's tr.).      Groping about in the gloom in search of something to eat, Ymir  perceived a gigantic cow called Audhumla (the nourisher), which  had been created by the same agency as himself, and out of the same  materials. Hastening towards her, Ymir noticed with pleasure that  from her"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/2850"],[0,"The Wars of the Jews; Or, The History of the Destruction of Jerusalem (#2)"],[1,"off, thence shall I take my rise, and begin my  history. Now as to what concerns that war which happened in my own time,  I will go over it very largely, and with all the diligence I am able;  but for what preceded mine own age, that I shall run over briefly.    7. [For example, I shall relate] how Antiochus, who was named Epiphanes,  took Jerusalem by force, and held it three years and three months, and  was then ejected out of the country by the sons of Asamoneus: after  that, how their posterity quarreled about the government, and brought  upon their settlement the Romans and Pompey; how Herod also, the son of  Antipater, dissolved their government, and brought Sosins upon them; as  also how our people made a sedition upon Herod's death, while Augustus  was the Roman emperor, and Quintilius Varus was in that country; and  how the war broke out in the twelfth year of Nero, with what happened to  Cestius; and what places the Jews assaulted in a hostile manner in the  first sallies of the war.    8. As also [I shall relate] how they built walls about the neighboring  cities; and how Nero, upon Cestius's defeat, was in fear of the entire  event of the war, and thereupon made Vespasian general in this war; and  how this Vespasian, with the elder of his sons 4 made an expedition into  the country of Judea; what was the number of the Roman army that he made  use of; and how many of his auxiliaries were cut off in all Galilee;  and how he took some of its cities entirely, and by force, and others  of them by treaty, and on terms. Now, when I am come so far, I shall  describe the good order of the Romans in war, and the discipline of  their legions; the amplitude of both the Galilees, with its nature, and  the limits of Judea. And, besides this, I shall particularly go over  what is peculiar to the country, the lakes and fountains that are in  them, and what miseries happened to every city as they were taken; and  all this with accuracy, as I saw the things done, or suffered in them.  For I shall not conceal any of the calamities I myself endured, since I  shall relate them to such as know the truth of them.    9. After this, [I shall relate] how, When the Jews' affairs were  become very bad, Nero died, and Vespasian, when he was going to attack  Jerusalem, was called back to take the government upon him; what signs  happened to him relating to his gaining that government, and what  mutations of government then happened at Rome, and how he was  unwillingly made emperor by his soldiers; and how, upon his departure to  Egypt, to take upon him the government of the empire, the affairs of  the Jews became very tumultuous; as also how the tyrants rose up against  them, and fell into dissensions among themselves.    10. Moreover, [I shall relate] how Titus marched out of Egypt into Judea  the second time; as also how, and where, and how many forces he got  together; and in what state the city was, by the means of the seditious,  at his coming; what attacks he made, and how many ramparts he cast up;  of the three walls that encompassed the city, and of their measures;  of the strength of the city, and the structure of the temple and holy  house; and besides, the measures of those edifices, and of the altar,  and all accurately determined. A description also of certain of  their festivals, and seven purifications of purity, 5 and the sacred  ministrations of the priests, with the garments of the priests, and  of the high priests; and of the nature of the most holy place of the  temple; without concealing any thing, or adding any thing to the known  truth of things.    11. After this, I shall relate the barbarity of the tyrants towards the  people of their own nation, as well as the indulgence of the Romans in  sparing foreigners; and how often Titus, out of his desire to preserve  the city and the temple, invited the seditious to come to terms of  accommodation. I shall also distinguish the sufferings of the people,  and their calamities; how far they were afflicted by the sedition, and  how far by the famine, and at length were taken. Nor shall I omit to  mention the misfortunes of the deserters, nor the punishments inflicted  on the captives; as also how the temple was burnt, against the consent  of Caesar; and how many sacred things that had been laid up in the  temple were snatched out of the fire; the destruction also of the entire  city, with the signs and wonders that went before it; and the taking the  tyrants captives, and the multitude of those that were made slaves,  and into what different misfortunes they were every one distributed.  Moreover, what the Romans did to the remains of the wall; and how they  demolished the strong holds that were in the country; and how Titus  went over the whole country, and settled its affairs; together with his  return into Italy, and his triumph.    12. I have comprehended all these things in seven books, and have left  no occasion for complaint or accusation to such as have been acquainted  with this war; and I have written it down for the sake of those that  love truth, but not for those that please themselves [with fictitious  relations]. And I will begin my account of these things with what I call  my First Chapter.    WAR PREFACE FOOTNOTES    1 (return) [ I have already observed more than once, that this History  of the Jewish War was Josephus's first work, and published about A.D.  75, when he was but thirty-eight years of age; and that when he wrote  it, he was not thoroughly acquainted with several circumstances of  history from the days of Antiochus Epiphanes, with which it begins, till  near his own times, contained in the first and former part of the  second book, and so committed many involuntary errors therein. That he  published his Antiquities eighteen years afterward, in the thirteenth  year of Domitian, A.D. 93, when he was much more completely acquainted  with those ancient times, and after he had perused those most authentic  histories, the First Book of Maccabees, and the Chronicles of the  Priesthood of John Hyrcanus, etc. That accordingly he then reviewed  those parts of this work, and gave the public a more faithful, complete,  and accurate account of the facts therein related; and honestly  corrected the errors he had before run into.]      2 (return) [ Who these Upper Barbarians, remote from the sea, were,  Josephus himself will inform us, sect. 2, viz. the Parthians and  Babylonians, and remotest Arabians [of the Jews among them]; besides the  Jews beyond Euphrates, and the Adiabeni, or Assyrians. Whence we also  learn that these Parthians, Babylonians, the remotest Arabians, [or at  least the Jews among them,] as also the Jews beyond Euphrates, and  the Adiabeni, or Assyrians, understood Josephus's Hebrew, or rather  Chaldaic, books of The Jewish War, before they were put into the Greek  language.]      3 (return) [ That these calamities of the Jews, who were our Savior's  murderers, were to be the greatest that had ever been since the beginning  of the world, our Savior had directly foretold, Matthew 24:21; Mark  13:19; Luke 21:23, 24; and that they proved to be such accordingly,  Josephus is here a most authentic witness.]      4 (return) [ Titus.]      5 (return) [ These seven, or rather five, degrees of purity, or  purification, are enumerated hereafter, B.

From The Taking Of Jerusalem By Antiochus Epiphanes,       To The Death Of Herod The Great.            CHAPTER 1.           How The City Jerusalem Was Taken, And The Temple Pillaged       [By Antiochus Epiphanes]. As Also Concerning The Actions Of       The Maccabees, Matthias And Judas; And Concerning The Death       Of Judas.    1. At the same time that Antiochus, who was called Epiphanes, had a  quarrel with the sixth Ptolemy about his right to the whole country of  Syria, a great sedition fell among the men of power in Judea, and they  had a contention about obtaining the government; while each of those  that were of dignity could not endure to be subject to their equals.  However, Onias, one of the high priests, got the better, and cast the  sons of Tobias out of the city; who fled to Antiochus, and besought  him to make use of them for his leaders, and to make an expedition into  Judea. The king being thereto disposed beforehand, complied with them,  and came upon the Jews with a great army, and took their city by force,  and slew a great multitude of those that favored Ptolemy, and sent out  his soldiers to plunder them without mercy. He also spoiled the temple,  and put a stop to the constant practice of offering a daily sacrifice  of expiation for three years and six months. But Onias, the high  priest, fled to Ptolemy, and received a place from him in the Nomus of  Heliopolis, where he built a city resembling Jerusalem, and a temple  that was like its temple 1 concerning which we shall speak more in its  proper place hereafter.    2. Now Antiochus was not satisfied either with his unexpected taking  the city, or with its pillage, or with the great slaughter he had made  there; but being overcome with his violent passions, and remembering  what he had suffered during the siege, he compelled the Jews to dissolve  the laws of their country, and to keep their infants uncircumcised,  and to sacrifice swine's flesh upon the altar; against which they all  opposed themselves, and the most approved among them were put to death.  Bacchides also, who was sent to keep the fortresses, having these wicked  commands, joined to his own natural barbarity, indulged all sorts of the  extremest wickedness, and tormented the worthiest of the inhabitants,  man by man, and threatened their city every day with open destruction,  till at length he provoked the poor sufferers by the extremity of his  wicked"]]]
