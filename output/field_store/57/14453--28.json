Interest  waning abruptly when the lecturers started to learn it, too.    I never paid much attention not expecting to be in Solitary  confinement much; this just shows you; next moment Ram opens a door  and pushes me through it, the door clicks behind me and Solitary  confinement is what I am in.    I remember this code is really called Remorse which is what I feel for  not learning when I had the chance.    However I do not have long for it, a speaker in the wall requests  everyone to lie down as acceleration is about to begin. I strap down  on the couch which fills half the compartment, countdown begins and at  zero the floor is suddenly _down_ once more.    I wait till my stomach settles, then rise to explore.           *       *       *       *       *    I am in an oblong room about eight by twelve, it looks as though it  had been hastily partitioned off from a larger space. The walls are  prefab plastic sheet, the rest is standard fittings slung in and  bolted down with the fastenings showing.    How many of my classmates are on this ship? _Remorse_ again as  tapping starts on either side of me.    Discarding such Hypotheses as that Ram and Peter are going to hold us  to ransom--which might work for me, since my Dad somehow got to be a  millionaire, but not for B because her parents think money is  vulgar--or that we are being carried off to found an ideal Colony  somewhere--any first-year student can tell you why that won't  work--only one idea seems plausible.    This is that Finals were not final and we are in for a Test of some  sort.    After ten minutes I get some evidence; a Reading Machine is trundled  in, the door immediately slamming shut so I do not see who trundles  it.    I prowl round it looking for tricks but it seems standard; I take a  seat in it, put on the headset and turn the switch.    Hypothesis confirmed, I suppose.    There is a reel in place and it contains background information on a  problem in Cultural Engineering all set out the way we are taught to  do it in Class. The Problem concerns developments on a planet got  settled by two groups during the Exodus and been isolated ever since.    Well while a Reading Machine is running there is no time to think, it  crams in data at full speed and evaluation has to wait. However my  subconscious goes into action and when the reel stops it produces a  Suspicion full grown.    The thing is too tidy.    When we were First Year we dreamed up situations like this and argued  like mad over them, but they were a lot too neat for real life and too  dramatic as well.    However one thing M'Clare said to us, and every other lecturer too,  just before the Finals, was Do not spend time trying to figure what  the examiner was after but answer the question as set; I am more than  halfway decided this is some mysterious Oriental idea of a joke but I  get busy thinking in case it is not.           *       *       *       *       *    The Problem goes like this:    The planet is called Incognita in the reel and it is right on the edge  of the known volume of space, it got settled by two groups somewhere  between three and three and a half centuries ago. The rest of the  human race never heard of it till maybe three years back.    (Well it happens that way, inhabited planets are still turning up  eight or ten a century, on account of during the Exodus some folk were  willing to travel a year or more so as to get away from the rest).    The ship that spotted the planet as inhabited did not land, but  reported to Central Government, Earth, who shipped observers out to  take a look.    (There was a rumor circulating at Russett that the Terry Government  might employ some of us on that kind of job, but it never got  official. I do not know whether to believe this bit or not.)    It is stated the observers landed secretly and mingled with the  natives unobserved.    (This is not physically impossible but sounds too like a Field Trip to  be true.)    The observers are not named but stated to be graduates of the Cultural  Engineering Class.    They put in a few months' work and sent home unanimous Crash Priority  reports the situation is _bad_, getting worse and the prognosis is  War.    Brother.    I know people had wars, I know one reason we do not have them now is  just that with so many planets and cheap transportation, pressure has  other outlets; these people scrapped their ships for factories and  never built more.    But.    There are only about ten million of them and surely to goodness a  whole planet gives room enough to keep out of each other's hair?    Well this is not Reasoning but a Reaction, I go back to the data for  another look.    The root trouble is stated to be that two groups landed on the planet  without knowing the others were there, when they met thirty years  later they got a disagreeable shock.    I cannot see there was any basic difference between them, they were  very similar, especially in that neither lot wanted anything to do  with people they had not picked themselves.    So they divided the planet along a Great Circle which left two of the  main land-masses in one hemisphere and two in another.    They agree each to keep to its own section and leave the other alone.    Twenty years later, trading like mad; each has certain minerals the  other lacks; each has certain agricultural products the other finds it  difficult to grow.    You think this leads to Co-operation Friendship and ultimate  Federation?    I will not go into the incidents that make each side feel it is being  gypped, it is enough that from time to time each has a scarcity or  hold-up on deliveries that upsets the other's economy; and they start  experimenting to become self-sufficient: and the exporter's economy is  upset in turn. And each thinks the other did it on purpose.    This sort of situation reacts internally leading to Politics.    There are troubles about a medium-sized island on the dividing line,  and the profits from interhemispherical transport, and the laws of  interhemispherical trade.    It takes maybe two hundred years, but finally each has expanded the  Police into an army with a whole spectrum of weapons not to be used on  any account except for Defense.    This situation lasts seventy years getting worse all the time, now  Rumors have started on each side that the other is developing an  Ultimate Weapon, and the political parties not in power are agitating  to move first before the thing is complete.    The observers report War not maybe this year or the next but within  ten, and if neither side was looking for an Ultimate Weapon to begin  with they certainly are now.    Taking all this at face value there seems an obvious solution.    I am thinking this over in an academic sort of way when an itchy  trickle of sweat starts down my vertebrae.    Who is going to apply this solution? Because if this is anything but  another Test, or the output of a diseased sense of humor, I would be  sorry for somebody.    I dial black coffee on the wall servitor and wish B were here so we  could prove to each other the thing is just an exercise; I do not do  so well at spotting proofs on my own.    Most of our class exercises have concerned something that happened,  once.           *       *       *       *       *    After about ninety minutes the speaker requests me to write not more  than one thousand words on any scheme to improve the situation and the  equipment required for it.    I spent ten minutes verbalizing the basic idea and an hour or so on  \"equipment\"; the longer I go on the more unlikely it all seems. In the  end I have maybe two hundred words which acting on instructions I post  through a slit in the door.    Five minutes later I realize I have forgotten the Time Factor.    [Illustration]    If the original ship took a year to reach Incognita, it will take at  least four months now; therefore it is more than four months since  that report was written and will be more than a year before anyone  arrives and War may have started already.    I sit back and by transition of ideas start to wonder where this ship  is heading? We are still at one gee and even on Mass-Time you cannot  juggle apparent acceleration and spatial transition outside certain  limits; we are not just orbiting but must be well outside the Solar  System by now.    The speaker announces Everyone will now get some rest; I smell  sleep-gas for one moment and have just time to lie down.    I guess I was tired, at that.    When I wake I feel more cheerful than I have for weeks; analysis  indicates I am glad something is _happening_ even if it is another  Exam.    I dial breakfast but am too restless to eat; I wonder how long this  goes on or whether I am supposed to show Initiative and break out; I  am examining things with this in mind when the speaker comes to life  again.    It says, \"Ladies and gentlemen. You have not been told whether the  problem that you studied yesterday concerned a real situation or an  imaginary one. You have all outlined measures which you think would  improve the situation described. Please consider, seriously, whether  you would be prepared to take part yourself in the application of your  plan.\"    Brother.    There is no way to tell whether those who say No will be counted  cowardly or those who say Yes rash idiots or what, the owner of that  voice has his inflections too well trained to give anything away  except intentionally.    D. J. M'Clare.    Not in person but a recording, anyway M'Clare is on Earth surrounded  by exam papers.    I sit back and try to think, honestly, if that crack-brained notion I  wrote out last night were going to be tried in dead earnest, would I  take a hand in it?    The trouble is, hearing M'Clare's voice has convinced me it is a Test,  I don't know whether it is testing my courage or my prudence in fact I  might as well toss for it.

At last he found himself at the age  of thirty-six with his father dead, and a debt due from the Crown of  16,000 pounds for services which his distinguished father, the admiral,  had rendered the Government.    Here was the accident that brought into being the great Quaker colony,  by a combination of circumstances which could hardly have happened  twice. Young Penn was popular at Court. He had inherited a valuable  friendship with Charles II and his heir, the Duke of York. This  friendship rested on the solid fact that Penn's father, the admiral,  had rendered such signal assistance in restoring Charles and the whole  Stuart line to the throne. But still 16,000 pounds or $80,000, the  accumulation of many deferred payments, was a goodly sum in those days,  and that the Crown would pay it in money, of which it had none too much,  was unlikely. Why not therefore suggest paying it instead in wild land  in America, of which the Crown had abundance? That was the fruitful  thought which visited Penn. Lord Berkeley and Lord Carteret had been  given New Jersey because they had signally helped to restore the Strait  family to the throne. All the more therefore should the Stuart family  give a tract of land, and even a larger tract, to Penn, whose father  had not only assisted the family to the throne but had refrained so long  from pressing his just claim for money due.    So the Crown, knowing little of the value of it, granted him the most  magnificent domain of mountains; lakes, rivers, and forests, fertile  soil, coal, petroleum, and iron that ever was given to a single  proprietor. In addition to giving Penn the control of Delaware and, with  certain other Quakers, that of New Jersey as well, the Crown placed  at the disposal of the Quakers 55,000 square miles of most valuable,  fertile territory, lacking only about three thousand square miles of  being as large as England and Wales. Even when cut down to 45,000 square  miles by a boundary dispute with Maryland, it was larger than Ireland.  Kings themselves have possessed such dominions, but never before a  private citizen who scorned all titles and belonged to a hunted sect  that exalted peace and spiritual contemplation above all the wealth and  power of the world. Whether the obtaining of this enormous tract of  the best land in America was due to what may be called the eternal  thriftiness of the Quaker mind or to the intense desire of the British  Government to get rid of these people--at any cost might be hard to  determine.    Penn received his charter in 1681, and in it he was very careful to  avoid all the mistakes of the Jersey proprietary grants. Instead of  numerous proprietors, Penn was to be the sole proprietor. Instead  of giving title to the land and remaining silent about the political  government, Penn's charter not only gave him title to the land but  a clearly defined position as its political head, and described the  principles of the government so clearly that there was little room for  doubt or dispute.    It was a decidedly feudal charter, very much like the one granted to  Lord Baltimore fifty years before, and yet at the same time it secured  civil liberty and representative government to the people. Penn owned  all the land and the colonists were to be his tenants. He was compelled,  however, to give his people free government. The laws were to be made by  him with the assent of the people or their delegates. In practice this  of course meant that the people were to elect a legislature and Penn  would have a veto, as we now call it, on such acts as the legislature  should pass. He had power to appoint magistrates, judges, and some other  officers, and to grant pardons. Though, by the charter, proprietor of  the province, he usually remained in England and appointed a deputy  governor to exercise authority in the colony. In modern phrase,  he controlled the executive part of the government and his people  controlled the legislative part.    Pennsylvania, besides being the largest in area of the proprietary  colonies, was also the most successful, not only from the proprietor's  point of view but also from the point of view of the inhabitants. The  proprietorships in Maine, New Hampshire, New Jersey, and the Carolinas  were largely failures. Maryland was only partially successful; it was  not particularly remunerative to its owner, and the Crown deprived him  of his control of it for twenty years. Penn, too, was deprived of the  control of Pennsylvania by William III but for only about two years.  Except for this brief interval (1692-1694), Penn and his sons after him  held their province down to the time of the American Revolution in 1776,  a period of ninety-four years.    A feudal proprietorship, collecting rents from all the people, seems  to modern minds grievously wrong in theory, and yet it would be very  difficult to show that it proved onerous in practice. Under it the  people of Pennsylvania flourished in wealth, peace, and happiness. Penn  won undying fame for the liberal principles of his feudal enterprise.  His expenses in England were so great and his quitrents always so much  in arrears that he was seldom out of debt. But his children grew rich  from the province. As in other provinces that were not feudal there were  disputes between the people and the proprietors; but there was not  so much general dissatisfaction as might have been expected. The  proprietors were on the whole not altogether disliked. In the American  Revolution, when the people could have confiscated everything in  Pennsylvania belonging to the proprietary family, they not only  left them in possession of a large part of their land, but paid them  handsomely for the part that was taken.    After Penn had secured his charter in 1681, he obtained from the Duke of  York the land now included in the State of Delaware. He advertised for  colonists, and began selling land at 100 pounds for five thousand acres  and annually thereafter a shilling quitrent for every hundred acres. He  drew up a constitution or frame of government, as he called it, after  wide and earnest consultation with many, including the famous Algernon  Sydney. Among the Penn papers in the Historical Society of Pennsylvania  is a collection of about twenty preliminary drafts. Beginning with one  which erected a government by a landed aristocracy, they became more  and more liberal, until in the end his frame was very much like the most  liberal government of the other English colonies in America. He had  a council and an assembly, both elected by the people. The council,  however, was very large, had seventy-two members, and was more like  an upper house of the Legislature than the usual colonial governor's  council. The council also had the sole right of proposing legislation,  and the assembly could merely accept or reject its proposals. This was  a new idea, and it worked so badly in practice that in the end the  province went to the opposite extreme and had no council or upper house  of the Legislature at all.    Penn's frame of government contained, however, a provision for its own  amendment. This was a new idea and proved to be so happy that it is now  found in all American constitutions. His method of impeachment by which  the lower house was to bring in the charge and the upper house was  to try it has also been universally adopted. His view that an  unconstitutional law is void was a step towards our modern system. The  next step, giving the courts power to declare a law unconstitutional,  was not taken until one hundred years after his time. With the advice  and assistance of some of those who were going out to his colony he  prepared a code of laws which contained many of the advanced ideas  of the Quakers. Capital punishment was to be confined to murder and  treason, instead of being applied as in England to a host of minor  offenses. The property of murderers, instead of being forfeited to the  State, was to be divided among the next of kin of the victim and of  the criminal. Religious liberty was established as it had been in Rhode  Island and the Jerseys. All children were to be taught a useful trade.  Oaths in judicial proceedings were not required. All prisons were to  be workhouses and places of reformation instead of dungeons of dirt,  idleness, and disease. This attempt to improve the prisons inaugurated  a movement of great importance in the modern world in which the part  played by the Quakers is too often forgotten.    Penn had now started his \"Holy Experiment,\" as he called his enterprise  in Pennsylvania, by which he intended to prove that religious liberty  was not only right, but that agriculture, commerce, and all arts and  refinements of life would flourish under it. He would break the delusion  that prosperity and morals were possible only under some one particular  faith established by law. He, would prove that government could  be carried on without war and without oaths, and that primitive  Christianity could be maintained without a hireling ministry, without  persecution, without ridiculous dogmas or ritual, sustained only by its  own innate power and the inward light.        Chapter II. Penn Sails For The Delaware    The framing of the constitution and other preparations consumed the year  following Penn's receipt of his charter in 1681. But at last, on  August 30, 1682, he set sail in the ship Welcome, with about a hundred  colonists. After a voyage of about six weeks, and the loss of thirty of  their number by smallpox, they arrived in the Delaware. June would have  been a somewhat better month in which to see the rich luxuriance of  the green meadows and forests of this beautiful river. But the autumn  foliage and bracing air of October must have been inspiring enough.  The ship slowly beat her way for three days up the bay and river in  the silence and "]]]
