How did you manage to keep out of the clutches  of Reddy Fox all the long winter?\"    Peter chuckled.  \"I didn't have much trouble with Reddy during  the winter,\" said he, \"but this very morning he so nearly caught  me that it is a wonder that my hair is not snow white from fright.\"  Then he told Jenny all about his narrow escape.  \"Had it not been  for that handy hole of Grandfather Chuck, I couldn't possibly  have escaped,\" concluded Peter.    Jenny Wren cocked her pert little head on one side, and her sharp  little eyes snapped.  \"Why don't you learn to swim, Peter, like  your cousin down in the Sunny South?\" she demanded.  \"If he had  been in your place, he would simply have plunged into the Smiling  Pool and laughed at Reddy Fox.\"    Peter sat bolt upright with his eyes very wide open.  In them was  a funny look of surprise as he stared up at Jenny Wren.  \"What are  you talking about, Jenny Wren?\" he demanded.  \"Don't you know that  none of the Rabbit family swim unless it is to cross the Laughing  Brook when there is no other way of getting to the other side, or  when actually driven into the water by an enemy from whom there is  no other escape?  I can swim a little if I have to, but you don't  catch me in the water when I can stay on land.  What is more, you  won't find any other members of my family doing such a thing.\"    \"Tut, tut, tut, tut, Peter!\" exclaimed Jenny Wren in her sharp,  scolding voice.  \"Tut, tut, tut, tut!  For a fellow who has been  so curious about the ways of his feathered neighbors, you know  very little about your own family.  If I were in your place I  would learn about my own relatives before I became curious about  my neighbors.  How many relatives have you, Peter?\"    \"One,\" replied Peter promptly, \"my big cousin, Jumper the Hare.\"    Jenny Wren threw back her head and laughed and laughed and laughed.  It was a most irritating and provoking laugh.  Finally Peter began  to lose patience.  \"What are you laughing at?\" he demanded crossly.  \"You know very well that Jumper the Hare is the only cousin I have.\"    Jenny Wren laughed harder that ever.    \"Peter!\" she gasped.  \"Peter, you will be the death of me.  Why,  down in the Sunny South, where I spent the winter, you have a  cousin who is more closely related to you than Jumper the Hare.  And what is more, he is almost as fond of the water as Jerry  Muskrat.  He was called the Marsh Rabbit or Marsh Hare, and many a  time I have watched him swimming about by the hour.\"    \"I don't believe it!\" declared Peter angrily.  \"I don't believe a  word of it.  You are simply trying to fool me, Jenny Wren.  There  never was a Rabbit and there never will be a Rabbit who would go  swimming for the fun of it.  I belong to the Cottontail branch of  the Hare family, and it is a fine family if I do say so.  My  cousin Jumper is a true Hare, and the only difference between us  is that he is bigger, has longer legs and ears, changes the color  of his coat in winter, and seldom, if ever, goes into holes in  the ground.  The idea of trying to tell me I don't know about my  own relatives.\"    Jenny Wren suddenly became sober.  \"Peter,\" said she very earnestly,  \"take my advice and go to school to Old Mother Nature for awhile.  What I have told you is true, every word of it.  You have a cousin  down in the Sunny South who spends half his time in the water.  What is more, I suspect that you and Jumper have other relatives  of whom you've never heard.  Such ignorance would be laughable if  it were not to be pitied.  This is what comes of never having  traveled.  Go to school to Old Mother Nature for a while, Peter.  It will pay you.\"  With this, Jenny Wren flew away to hunt for  Mr. Wren that they might decide where to make their home for  the summer.    Peter tried to believe that what Jenny Wren had told him was nothing  but a story, but do what he would, he couldn't rid himself of a  little doubt.  He tried to interest himself in the affairs of the  other little people of Old Orchard, but it was useless.  That little  doubt kept growing and growing.  Could it be possible that Jenny  Wren had spoken the truth?  Could it be that he really didn't  know what relatives he had or anything about them?  Of course Old  Mother Nature could tell him all he wanted to know.  And he knew  that whatever she might tell him would be true.    Finally that growing doubt, together with the curiosity which has  led poor Peter to do so many queer things, proved too much for him  and he started for the Green Forest to look for Old Mother Nature.  It didn't take long to find her.  She was very busy, for there is  no time in all the year when Old Mother Nature has quite so much  to do as in the spring.    \"If you please, Old Mother Nature,\" said Peter timidly but very  politely, \"I've some questions I want to ask you.\"    Old Mother Nature's eyes twinkled in a kindly way.  \"All right,  Peter,\" she replied.  \"I guess I can talk and work at the same  time.  What is it you want to know?\"    \"I want to know if it is true that there are any other members of  the Rabbit and the Hare family besides my big cousin, Jumper, who  lives here in the Green Forest, and myself.\"    Old Mother Nature's eyes twinkled more than ever.  \"Why, of course,  Peter,\" she replied.  \"There are several other members.  You ought  to know that.  But then, I suppose you don't because you never  have traveled.  It is surprising how little some folks know about  the very things they ought to know most about.\"    Peter looked very humble and as if he felt a little bit foolish.  \"Is--is--is it true that way down in the Sunny South I have a  cousin who loves to spend his time in the water?\" stammered Peter.    \"It certainly is, Peter,\" replied Old Mother Nature.  \"He is called  the Marsh Rabbit, and he is more nearly your size, and looks more  like you, than any of your other cousins.\"    Peter gulped as if he were swallowing something that went down  hard.  \"That is what Jenny Wren said, but I didn't believe her,\"  replied Peter meekly.  \"She said she had often watched him  swimming about like Jerry Muskrat.\"    Old Mother Nature nodded.  \"Quite true.  Quite true,\" said she.  \"He is quite as much at home in the water as on land, if anything  a little more so.  He is one member the family who takes to the  water, and he certainly does love it.  Is there anything else you  want to know, Peter?\"    Peter shifted about uneasily and hesitated.  \"What is it, Peter?\"  asked Old Mother Nature kindly.  \"There is nothing in the Great  World equal to knowledge, and if I can add to your store of it I  will be very glad to.\"    Peter took heart.  \"If--if you please, Mother Nature, I would like  to learn all about my family.  May come to school to you every day?\"    Old Mother Nature laughed right out.  \"Certainly you may go to  school to me, old Mr. Curiosity,\" said she.  \"It is a good idea;  a very good idea.  I'm very busy, as you can see, but I'm never  too busy to teach those who really want to learn.  We'll have a  lesson here every morning just at sun-up.  I can't be bothered  any more to-day, because it is late.  Run along home to the dear  Old Briar-patch and think up some questions to ask me to-morrow  morning.  And, by the way, Peter, I will ask YOU some questions.  For one thing I shall ask you to tell me all you know about your  own family.  Now scamper along and be here to-morrow morning  at sun-up.\"    \"May I bring my cousin, Jumper the Hare, if he wants to come?\"  asked Peter, as he prepared to obey Old Mother Nature.    \"Bring him along and any one else who wants to learn,\" replied Old  Mother Nature kindly.    Peter bade her good-by in his most polite manner and then scampered  as fast as he could go, lipperty-lipperty-lip, to the dear Old  Briar-patch.  There he spent the remainder of the day thinking up  questions and also trying to find out how much he really did know  about his own family.        CHAPTER II  Peter and Jumper go to School    Hardly had jolly, round, red Mr. Sun thrown off his rosy blankets  and begun his daily climb up in the blue, blue sky when Peter  Rabbit and his cousin, Jumper the Hare, arrived at the place in  the Green Forest where Peter had found Old Mother Nature the day  before.  She was waiting for them, ready to begin the first lesson.    \"I am glad you are so prompt,\" said she.  \"Promptness is one of  the most important things in life.  Now I am very, very busy these  days, as you know, so we will begin school at once.  Before either  of you ask any questions, I am going to ask some myself.  Peter,  what do you look like?  Where do you live?  What do you eat?  I  want to find out just how much you really know about yourself.\"    Peter scratched one ear with a long hind foot and hesitated as  if he didn't know just how to begin.  Old Mother Nature waited  patiently.  Finally Peter began rather timidly.    \"Of course,\" said he, \"the only way I know how I look is by the  way the other members of my family look, for I've never seen  myself.  I suppose in a way I look like all the rest of the Rabbit  family.  I have long hind legs and short front ones.  I suppose  this is so I can make long jumps when I am in a hurry.\"    Old Mother Nature nodded, and Peter, taking courage, continued.  \"My  hind legs are stout and strong, but my front ones are rather weak.  I guess this is because I do not have a great deal of use for them,  except for running.  My coat is a sort of mixture of brown and gray,  more brown in summer and more gray in winter.  My ears are longer for  my size than are those of most animals, but really not very long after  all, not nearly as long for my size as my cousin Jumper's are for his  size.  My tail doesn't amount to much because it is so short that it  is hardly "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/24416"],[0,"Life and Work in Benares and Kumaon, 1839-1877 (#2)"],[1,"ebruary,  1857.
