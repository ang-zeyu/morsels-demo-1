I. LABORATORY REGULATIONS.      The following regulations are laid down for observance in the  Bacteriological Laboratories under the direction of the author. Similar  regulations should be enforced in all laboratories where pathogenic  bacteria are studied.         _Guy's Hospital._           ~BACTERIOLOGICAL DEPARTMENT.~         HANDLING OF INFECTIVE MATERIALS.         The following Regulations have been drawn up in the interest       of those working in the Laboratory as well as the public at       large, and will be strictly enforced.         Their object is to avoid the dangers of infection which may       arise from neglect of necessary precautions or from       carelessness.         Everyone must note that by neglecting the general rules laid       down he not only runs grave risk himself, but is a danger to       others.         REGULATIONS.         1. Each worker must wear a gown or overall, provided at his       own expense, which must be kept in the Laboratory.         2. The hands must be disinfected with lysol 2 per cent.       solution, carbolic acid 5 per cent. solution, or corrosive       sublimate 1 per mille solution, after dealing with       infectious material, and ~before using towels~.         3. On no account must Laboratory towels or dusters be used       for wiping up infectious material, and if such towels or       dusters do become soiled, they must be immediately       sterilised by boiling.         4. Special pails containing disinfectant are provided to       receive any waste material, and nothing must be thrown on       the floor.         5. All instruments must be flamed, boiled, or otherwise       disinfected immediately after use.         6. Labels must be moistened with water, and not by the       mouth.         7. All disused cover-glasses, slides, and pipettes after use       in handling infectious material, etc., must be placed in 2       per cent. lysol solution. A vessel is supplied on each bench       for this purpose.         8. All plate and tube cultures of pathogenic organisms when       done with, must be placed for immediate disinfection in the       boxes provided for the purpose.         9. No fluids are to be discharged into sinks or drains       unless previously disinfected.         10. Animals are to be dissected only after being nailed out       on the wooden boards, and their skin thoroughly washed with       disinfectant solution.         11. Immediately after the post-mortem examination is       completed each cadaver must be placed in the zinc       animal-box--_without removing the carcase from the       post-mortem board_--and the cover of the box replaced, ready       for carriage to the destructor.         12. Dead animals, when done with, are cremated in the       destructor, and the laboratory attendant must be notified       when the bodies are ready for cremation.         13. None of the workers in the laboratory are allowed to       enter the animal houses unless accompanied by the special       attendant in charge, who must scrupulously observe the same       directions regarding personal disinfection as the workers in       the laboratories.         14. No cultures are to be taken out of the laboratory       without the permission of the head of the Department.         15. All accidents, such as spilling infected material,       cutting or pricking the fingers, must be at once reported to       the bacteriologist in charge.          II. GLASS APPARATUS IN COMMON USE.      The equipment of the bacteriological laboratory, so far as the glass  apparatus is concerned, differs but little from that of a chemical  laboratory, and the cleanliness of the apparatus is equally important.  The glassware comprised in the following list, in addition to being  clean, must be stored in a sterile or germ-free condition.    ~Test-tubes.~--It is convenient to keep several sizes of test-tubes in  stock, to meet special requirements, viz.:    1. ~18 x 1.5~ cm., to contain media for ordinary tube cultivations.    2. ~18 x 1.3~ cm., to contain media used for pouring plate cultivations,  and also for holding sterile \"swabs.\"    3. ~18 x 2~ cm., to contain wedges of potato, beetroot, or other vegetable  media.    4. ~13 x 1.5~ cm., to contain inspissated blood-serum.    The tubes should be made from the best German potash glass,  \"blue-lined,\" stout and heavy, with the edge of the mouth of the tube  _slightly_ turned over, but not to such an extent as to form a definite  rim. (Cost about $1.50, or 6 shillings per gross.) Such tubes are  expensive it is true, but they are sufficiently stout to resist rough  handling, do not usually break if accidentally allowed to drop (a point  of some moment when dealing with cultures of pathogenic bacteria), can  be cleaned, sterilised, and used over and over again, and by their  length of life fully justify their initial expense.    A point be noted is that the manufacturers rarely turn out such tubes as  these absolutely uniform in calibre, and a batch of 18 by 1.5 cm. tubes  usually contains such extreme sizes as 18 by 2 cm. and 18 by 1.3 cm.  Consequently, if a set of standard tubes is kept for comparison or  callipers are used each new supply of so-called 18 by 1.5 cm. tubes may  be easily sorted out into these three sizes, and so simplify ordering.    5. ~5 x 0.7~ cm., for use in the inverted position inside the tubes  containing carbohydrate media, as gas-collecting tubes.    These tubes, \"unrimmed,\" may be of common thin glass as less than two  per cent. are fit for use a second time.    [Illustration: FIG. 1.--Bohemian flask.]    [Illustration: FIG. 2.--Pear-shaped flask.]    [Illustration: FIG. 3.--Erlenmeyer flask (narrow neck).]    ~Bohemian Flasks~ (Fig. 1).--These are the ordinary flasks of the chemical  laboratory. A good variety, ranging in capacity from 250 to 3000 c.c.,  should be kept on hand. A modified form, known as the \"pear-shaped\"  (Fig. 2), is preferable for the smaller sizes--i. e., 250 and 500 c.c.    ~Erlenmeyer's Flasks~ (Fig. 3).--Erlenmeyer's flasks of 75, 100, and 250  c.c. capacity are extremely useful. For use as culture flasks care  should be taken to select only such as have a narrow neck of about 2 cm.  in length.    ~Kolle's Culture Flasks~ (Fig. 4).--These thin, flat flasks (to contain  agar or gelatine, which is allowed to solidify in a layer on one side)  are extremely useful on account of the large nutrient surface available  for growth. A surface cultivation in one of these will yield as much  growth as ten or twelve \"oblique\" tube cultures. The wide mouth,  however, is a disadvantage, and for many purposes thin, flat culture  bottles known as ~Roux's bottles~ (Fig. 5) are to be preferred.    [Illustration: FIG. 4.--Kolle's culture flask.]    [Illustration: FIG. 5.--Roux's culture bottle.]    [Illustration: FIG. 6.--Guy's culture bottle.]    [Illustration: FIG. 7.--Filter flask.]    An even more convenient pattern is that used in the author's laboratory  (Fig. 6), as owing to the greater depth of medium which it is possible  to obtain in these flasks an exceedingly luxuriant growth is possible;  the narrow neck reduces the chance of accidental contamination to a  minimum and the general shape permits the flasks to be stacked one upon  the other.    ~Filter Flasks or Kitasato's Serum Flasks~ (Fig. 7).--Various sizes, from  250 to 2000 c.c. capacity. These must be of stout glass, to resist the  pressure to which they are subjected, but at the same time must be  thoroughly well annealed, in order to withstand the temperature  necessary for sterilisation.    All flasks should be either of Jena glass or the almost equally  well-known Resistance or R glass, the extra initial expense being  justified by the comparative immunity of the glass from breakage.    ~Petri's Dishes or \"Plates\"~ (Fig. 8, a).--These have now completely  replaced the rectangular sheets of glass introduced by Koch for the  plate method of cultivation. Each \"plate\" consists of a pair of circular  discs of glass with sharply upturned edges, thus forming shallow dishes,  one of slightly greater diameter than the other, and so, when inverted,  forming a cover or cap for the smaller. Plates having an outside  diameter of 10 cm. and a height of 1.5 cm. are the most generally  useful. A batch of eighteen such plates is sterilised and stored in a  cylindrical copper box (30 cm. high by 12 cm. diameter) provided with a  \"pull-off\" lid. Inside each box is a copper stirrup with a circular  bottom, upon which the plates rest, and by means of which each can be  raised in turn to the mouth of the box (Fig. 9) for removal.    ~Capsules~ (Fig. 8, b and c).--These are Petri's dishes of smaller  diameter but greater depth than those termed plates. Two sizes will be  found especially useful--viz., 4 cm. diameter by 2 cm. high, capacity  about 14 c.c.; and 5 cm. diameter by 2 cm. high, capacity about 25 c.c.  These are stored in copper cylinders of similar construction to those  used for plates, but measuring 20 by 6 cm. and 20 by 7 cm.,  respectively.    [Illustration: FIG. 8.--Petri dish (a), and capsules (b, c).]    [Illustration: FIG. 9.--Plate box with stirrup.]    ~Graduated Pipettes.~--Several varieties of these are required, viz.:    1. Pipettes"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/27748"],[0,"Popular Lectures on Zoonomia (#2)"],[1,"this time he wrote the essay,  which, in the year 1797, he published under the title of a Lecture on  Health, which very neatly and perspicuously explains the fundamental  parts of the Brunonian theory of medicine: in September 1788, he  published his inaugural dissertation de Visu, and obtained the degree  of M.D. Very soon afterwards he went to London, to pursue his  professional studies, which he continued to do with the greatest  perseverance: he attended with unceasing diligence the lectures of  the most eminent lecturers, and he sought practical knowledge in the  chief hospitals of the metropolis with the most ardent zeal; so that  whilst he gained information to himself, he set an impressive example  to his contemporary medical students, who in the delusive pursuits of  a great city, are too apt to neglect the objects their parents had in  view in sending them to the capital. Having finished his studies in  London, Dr. Garnett, in 1789, returned to his parents. At the time he  left London, he had lost none of his ardour; still he continued  indefatigable and observant. He had been flattered and respected by  his fellow students, and praised by his seniors; and his previous  success animated him with the strongest expectation of future  advancement. At this time, it is supposed, he wrote the justly  admired Treatise on Optics, which is in the Encyclopaedia Britannica.  Soon after his establishment as a physician, at Bradford, in  Yorkshire, which took place in the year 1790, he began to give  private lectures on philosophy and chemistry. He wrote his treatise  on the Horley Green Spa; and in a short time, gained a deserved  character of ingenuity and skill as a chemist, a physician, and a  benevolent member of society. Bradford did not afford scope for his  practice as a physician, equal to the sanguine expectations he had  formed; and he was induced to change his situation.    In the year 1791, therefore, he removed to Knaresborough, intending  to reside at that place during the winter, and at Harrowgate during  the summer. This plan he put in execution till the year 1794; his  reputation rapidly increased, and his future prospects appeared  cheering and bright. He continued to apply himself very closely to  chemistry, which was now decidedly his most pleasant and interesting  study. He endeavoured to apply his various knowledge to practical  purposes, and in many instances was peculiarly successful. No sooner  had he arrived at Knaresborough, than anxious to investigate every  thing in the neighbourhood, which could at all affect the health of  the inhabitants, he began to analyse the Crescent Water at  Harrowgate; which he did, with all the accuracy a subject so  difficult could admit of; and in 1791, he published his treatise upon  it. The same spirit led him, in 1792, to analyse the other mineral  waters at the same place of fashionable and general resort, the  detail of which he published in the same year. These publications  became generally read, and gained him a very extensive reputation.  The late Dr. Withering, whose knowledge on these subjects could not  be disputed, before he had seen his general analysis of the  Harrowgate Waters, said, that \"excepting only the few examples given  us by Bergman, the analysis of the Crescent Waters was one of the  neatest and most satisfactory accounts he had ever read of any  mineral water.\" But his exertions were not confined to professional  and scientific pursuits; laudably desirous of advancing knowledge  amongst every branch of the community, he formed the plan of a  subscription library, which has, since 1791, been of great  convenience and utility to the inhabitants of Knaresborough. Far from  joining in the opinion which has so much prevailed in modern times,  that it was sufficient to aim at general utility, he lost no  opportunity of doing good to every member of society. He greatly  promoted and encouraged the making of the pleasure grounds and  building on the rock, called Fort Montague; and he instructed and  assisted the poor man, who is called the Governor, to institute a  bank, and to print and issue small bills of the value of a few  halfpence, in imitation of the notes of the country bankers, but  drawn and signed with a reference of humour to the fort, the flag,  the hill, and the cannon. These notes, the nobility and gentry, who  during the Harrowgate season crowd to visit this remarkable place,  take in exchange for their silver, and by these means the governor,  who is a man of gentle and inoffensive manners, has been enabled,  with the assistance of his loom, to support himself and a numerous  family, and to ameliorate their condition, by giving education to his  children.    No station in life escaped his benevolent attentions. In order to  benefit John Metcalf, who is perhaps more generally known by the name  of Blind Jack of Knaresborough, he assisted him to publish an account  of the very singular and remarkable occurrences of his life, during a  long series of years, under the heavy affliction of total blindness;  by the sale of which, this venerable old man derived a considerable  contribution towards his subsistence.    Whilst at Harrowgate, Dr. Garnett obtained the patronage and  protection of the Earl of Rosslyn, then Lord Loughborough, who in the  year 1794 built a house for him, which for the future Dr. Garnett  meant should be his only residence; it was not long however before he  discovered that his situation at Harrowgate was but ill calculated to  forward his liberal and extended views. At this place he had small  opportunities of attaching himself to his favourite sciences; in the  winter months he was without literary society, and it was not for his  ardent spirit to remain inactive. About this time also, he formed the  idea of going to America, where he thought he might live both  honourably and profitably as a teacher of chemistry and natural  philosophy. All these circumstances were floating in his mind, when  in the year 1794, about the end of July, at the instance of a medical  friend, who resided in London, he received as boarders into his  house, which was kept by his sister, Miss Catharine Grace Cleveland,  daughter of the late Mr. Cleveland, of Salisbury Square, Fleet  Street, who was recommended to the use of the Harrowgate waters,  together with her friend Miss Worboys. To all who were acquainted  with the prepossessing exterior of Dr. Garnett, the liveliness of his  conversation, the urbanity of his manners, and his general desire of  communicating knowledge to whomever he saw desirous of gaining  information, it will be no surprise, that a mutual attachment grew up  between him and his inmate, Miss Cleveland, a young lady possessing,  in all respects, a mind similar to his own, and who must have felt a  natural gratification in the zeal with which the company of the  person, on whom she had placed her affections, was sought by all  ranks resorting to this fashionable watering place, where every one  thought himself most fortunate who sat nearest to him at the table,  and where he enlivened the circle around him with his conversation,  which was not only instructive, but playfully gay, and entertaining,  ever striving to amuse, and always successful in his attempts. The  Doctor now began to project plans of happiness, which he had only  before held in idea. Previous to his visitors leaving Harrowgate,  which was towards the latter end of December, he communicated to Miss  Cleveland his intention of going to America. At first she hesitated  about accompanying him; but finding his resolution fixed, she at  length consented. From this time, till the beginning of March 1795,  he continued deliberating upon and maturing his plan. He now departed  from Harrowgate, and followed the object of his affection to her  mother's residence at Hare Hatch, Berks. He was married to her on the  16th of March, and a fortnight afterwards returned to Harrowgate, to  dispose of the lease of his house, and his furniture. Having again  joined his wife, he then went to London, where he purchased apparatus  for his lectures, and after visiting his parents, he proceeded to  Liverpool, in order to obtain a passage to America.    Whilst he was thus waiting for the opportunity of a vessel to  transport him across the Atlantic, he was solicited by the medical  gentlemen at Liverpool, to unpack his apparatus, and give a public  course of lectures on chemistry and experimental philosophy. At all  times desirous of diffusing the knowledge he had acquired, and eager  to fulfil the wishes of his friends, he complied with their request,  and entered upon a plan, which in the end completely overturned the  scheme he had for several months been contemplating with such ardent  hopes of happiness and prosperity. No sooner had he been prevailed  upon, than he set about getting every thing ready for his lectures,  and after a single week's preparation; he commenced his course. The  deep interest he took in his subject, the anxiety he showed to make  himself understood, and the enthusiastic hope he constantly expressed  of the advancement of science, had a remarkable effect upon his  audience; and his lectures were received with the most flattering  marks of attention, and excited the most general applause and  satisfaction. In a short time, he received a pressing invitation from  the most eminent characters at Manchester, to repeat his course in  that town. This invitation he accepted, and, encouraged by the  success he had just experienced, he postponed the idea of leaving his  country. He arrived at Manchester about the middle of January 1796,  and began his lectures on the 22nd of that month. Before his arrival,  not less than sixty subscribers had put down their names, the more  strongly to induce him to comply with their wishes, and many more had  promised to do it, as soon as his proposals were published.  Notwithstanding he was thus"]]]
