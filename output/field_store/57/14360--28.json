St. Lawrence said that the treasures of the Church were the  Church's poor, but he spoke according to the usage of the word in his  own time.    60. Without rashness we say that the keys of the Church, given by  Christ's merit, are that treasure;    61. For it is clear that for the remission of penalties and of reserved  cases, the power of the pope is of itself sufficient.    62. The true treasure of the Church is the Most Holy Gospel of the  glory and the grace of God.    63. But this treasure is naturally most odious, for it makes the first  to be last.    64. On the other hand, the treasure of indulgences is naturally most  acceptable, for it makes the last to be first.    65. Therefore the treasures of the Gospel are nets with which they  formerly were wont to fish for men of riches.    66. The treasures of the indulgences are nets with which they now fish  for the riches of men.    67. The indulgences which the preachers cry as the \"greatest graces\"  are known to be truly such, in so far as they promote gain.    68. Yet they are in truth the very smallest graces compared with the  grace of God and the piety of the Cross.    69. Bishops and curates are bound to admit the commissaries of  apostolic pardons, with all reverence.    70. But still more are they bound to strain all their eyes and attend  with all their ears, lest these men preach their own dreams instead of  the commission of the pope.    71. He who speaks against the truth of apostolic pardons, let him be  anathema and accursed!    72. But he who guards against the lust and license of the  pardon-preachers, let him be blessed!    73. The pope justly thunders against those who, by any art, contrive  the injury of the traffic in pardons.    74. But much more does he intend to thunder against those who use the  pretext of pardons to contrive the injury of holy love and truth.    75. To think the papal pardons so great that they could absolve a man  even if he had committed an impossible sin and violated the Mother of  God--this is madness.    76. We say, on the contrary, that the papal pardons are not able to  remove the very least of venial sins, so far as its guilt is concerned.    77. It is said that even St. Peter, if he were now Pope, could not  bestow greater graces; this is blasphemy against St. Peter and against  the pope.    78. We say, on the contrary, that even the present pope, and any pope  at all, has greater graces at his disposal; to wit, the Gospel, powers,  gifts of healing, etc., as it is written in I. Corinthians xii.    79. To say that the cross, emblazoned with the papal arms, which is set  up [by the preachers of indulgences], is of equal worth with the Cross  of Christ, is blasphemy.    80. The bishops, curates and theologians who allow such talk to be  spread among the people, will have an account to render.  81. This  unbridled preaching of pardons makes it no easy matter, even for  learned men, to rescue the reverence due to the pope from slander, or  even from the shrewd questionings of the laity.    82. To wit:--\"Why does not the pope empty purgatory, for the sake of  holy love and of the dire need of the souls that are there, if he  redeems an infinite number of souls for the sake of miserable money  with which to build a Church? The former reasons would be most just;  the latter is most trivial.\"    83. Again:--\"Why are mortuary and anniversary masses for the dead  continued, and why does he not return or permit the withdrawal of the  endowments founded on their behalf, since it is wrong to pray for the  redeemed?\"    84. Again:--\"What is this new piety of God and the pope, that for money  they allow a man who is impious and their enemy to buy out of purgatory  the pious soul of a friend of God, and do not rather, because of that  pious and beloved soul's own need, free it for pure love's sake?\"    85. Again:--\"Why are the penitential canons long since in actual fact  and through disuse abrogated and dead, now satisfied by the granting of  indulgences, as though they were still alive and in force?\"    86. Again:--\"Why does not the pope, whose wealth is to-day greater than  the riches of the richest, build just this one church of St. Peter with  his own money, rather than with the money of poor believers?\"    87. Again:--\"What is it that the pope remits, and what participation  does he grant to those who, by perfect contrition, have a right to full  remission and participation?\"    88. Again:--\"What greater blessing could come to the Church than if the  pope were to do a hundred times a day what he now does once, and bestow  on every believer these remissions and participations?\"    89. \"Since the pope, by his pardons, seeks the salvation of souls  rather than money, why does he suspend the indulgences and pardons  granted heretofore, since these have equal efficacy?\"    90. To repress these arguments and scruples of the laity by force  alone, and not to resolve them by giving reasons, is to expose the  Church and the pope to the ridicule of their enemies, and to make  Christians unhappy.    91. If, therefore, pardons were preached according to the spirit and  mind of the pope, all these doubts would be readily resolved; nay, they  would not exist.    92. Away, then, with all those prophets who say to the people of  Christ, \"Peace, peace,\" and there is no peace!    93. Blessed be all those prophets who say to the people of Christ,  \"Cross, cross,\" and there is no cross!    94. Christians are to be exhorted that they be diligent in following  Christ, their Head, through penalties, deaths, and hell;    95. And thus be confident of entering into heaven rather through many  tribulations, than through the assurance of peace.        ======================================================================      This text was converted to ASCII format for Project Wittenberg by    Allen Mulvey and is in the public domain.

In nomine domini nostri Hiesu Christi.  Amen.    1. Dominus et magister noster Iesus Christus dicendo 'Penitentiam agite  &c.' omnem vitam fidelium penitentiam esse voluit.  2. Quod verbum de  penitentia sacramentali (id est confessionis et satisfactionis, que  sacerdotum ministerio celebratur) non potest intelligi.    3. Non tamen solam intendit interiorem, immo interior nulla est, nisi  foris operetur varias carnis mortificationes.    4. Manet itaque pena, donec manet odium sui (id est penitentia vera  intus), scilicet usque ad introitum regni celorum.    5. Papa non vult nec potest ullas penas remittere preter eas, quas  arbitrio vel suo vel canonum imposuit.    6. Papa non potest remittere ullam culpam nisi declarando, et  approbando remissam a deo Aut certe remittendo casus reservatos sibi,  quibus contemptis culpa prorsus remaneret.    7. Nulli prorus remittit deus culpam, quin simul eum subiiciat  humiliatum in omnibus sacerdoti suo vicario.    8. Canones penitentiales solum viventibus sunt impositi nihilque  morituris secundum eosdem debet imponi.    9. Inde bene nobis facit spiritussanctus in papa excipiendo in suis  decretis semper articulum mortis et necessitatis.    10. Indocte et male faciunt sacerdotes ii, qui morituris penitentias  canonicas in purgatorium reservant.    11. Zizania illa de mutanda pena Canonica in penam purgatorii videntur  certe dormientibus episcopis seminata.    12. Olim pene canonice non post, sed ante absolutionem imponebantur  tanquam tentamenta vere contritionis.    13. Morituri per mortem omnia solvunt et legibus canonum mortui iam  sunt, habentes iure earum relaxationem.    14. Imperfecta sanitas seu charitas morituri necessario secum fert  magnum timorem, tantoque maiorem, quanto minor fuerit ipsa.    15. Hic timor et horror satis est se solo (ut alia taceam) facere penam  purgatorii, cum sit proximus desperationis horrori.    16. Videntur infernus, purgaturium, celum differre, sicut desperatio,  prope desperatio, securitas differunt.    17. Necessarium videtur animabus in purgatorio sicut minni horrorem ita  augeri charitatem.    18. Nec probatum videtur ullis aut rationibus aut scripturis, quod sint  extra statum meriti seu augende charitatis.    19.

Igitur papa  per remissionem plenariam omnium"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/2742"],[0,"Cenci (#2)"],[1,"on, inherited this fortune.    His youth was spent under popes so occupied with the schism of Luther  that they had no time to think of anything else. The result was, that  Francesco Cenci, inheriting vicious instincts and master of an immense  fortune which enabled him to purchase immunity, abandoned himself to all  the evil passions of his fiery and passionate temperament. Five times  during his profligate career imprisoned for abominable crimes, he only  succeeded in procuring his liberation by the payment of two hundred  thousand piastres, or about one million francs. It should be explained  that popes at this time were in great need of money.    The lawless profligacy of Francesco Cenci first began seriously to  attract public attention under the pontificate of Gregory XIII. This  reign offered marvellous facilities for the development of a reputation  such as that which this reckless Italian Don Juan seemed bent on  acquiring. Under the Bolognese Buoncampagno, a free hand was given to  those able to pay both assassins and judges. Rape and murder were so  common that public justice scarcely troubled itself with these trifling  things, if nobody appeared to prosecute the guilty parties. The good  Gregory had his reward for his easygoing indulgence; he was spared to  rejoice over the Massacre of St. Bartholomew.    Francesco Cenci was at the time of which we are speaking a man of  forty-four or forty-five years of age, about five feet four inches in  height, symmetrically proportioned, and very strong, although rather  thin; his hair was streaked with grey, his eyes were large and  expressive, although the upper eyelids drooped somewhat; his nose was  long, his lips were thin, and wore habitually a pleasant smile, except  when his eye perceived an enemy; at this moment his features assumed a  terrible expression; on such occasions, and whenever moved or even  slightly irritated, he was seized with a fit of nervous trembling, which  lasted long after the cause which provoked it had passed. An adept in  all manly exercises and especially in horsemanship, he sometimes used to  ride without stopping from Rome to Naples, a distance of forty-one  leagues, passing through the forest of San Germano and the Pontine  marshes heedless of brigands, although he might be alone and unarmed  save for his sword and dagger. When his horse fell from fatigue, he  bought another; were the owner unwilling to sell he took it by force; if  resistance were made, he struck, and always with the point, never the  hilt. In most cases, being well known throughout the Papal States as a  free-handed person, nobody tried to thwart him; some yielding through  fear, others from motives of interest. Impious, sacrilegious, and  atheistical, he never entered a church except to profane its sanctity.  It was said of him that he had a morbid appetite for novelties in crime,  and that there was no outrage he would not commit if he hoped by so  doing to enjoy a new sensation.    At the age of about forty-five he had married a very rich woman, whose  name is not mentioned by any chronicler. She died, leaving him seven  children--five boys and two girls. He then married Lucrezia Petroni, a  perfect beauty of the Roman type, except for the ivory pallor of her  complexion. By this second marriage he had no children.    As if Francesco Cenci were void of all natural affection, he hated his  children, and was at no pains to conceal his feelings towards them: on  one occasion, when he was building, in the courtyard of his magnificent  palace, near the Tiber, a chapel dedicated to St. Thomas, he remarked to  the architect, when instructing him to design a family vault, \"That is  where I hope to bury them all.\" The architect often subsequently  admitted that he was so terrified by the fiendish laugh which  accompanied these words, that had not Francesco Cenci's work been  extremely profitable, he would have refused to go on with it.    As soon as his three eldest boys, Giacomo, Cristoforo, and Rocco, were  out of their tutors' hands, in order to get rid of them he sent them to  the University of Salamanca, where, out of sight, they were out of mind,  for he thought no more about them, and did not even send them the means  of subsistence. In these straits, after struggling for some months  against their wretched plight, the lads were obliged to leave Salamanca,  and beg their way home, tramping barefoot through France and Italy, till  they made their way back to Rome, where they found their father harsher  and more unkind than ever.    This happened in the early part of the reign of Clement VIII, famed for  his justice. The three youths resolved to apply to him, to grant them an  allowance out of their father's immense income. They consequently  repaired to Frascati, where the pope was building the beautiful  Aldobrandini Villa, and stated their case. The pope admitted the justice  of their claims, and ordered Francesco, to allow each of them two  thousand crowns a year. He endeavoured by every possible means to evade  this decree, but the pope's orders were too stringent to be disobeyed.    About this period he was for the third time imprisoned for infamous  crimes. His three sons them again petitioned the pope, alleging that  their father dishonoured the family name, and praying that the extreme  rigour of the law, a capital sentence, should be enforced in his case.  The pope pronounced this conduct unnatural and odious, and drove them  with ignominy from his presence. As for Francesco, he escaped, as on the  two previous occasions, by the payment of a large sum of money.    It will be readily understood that his sons' conduct on this occasion  did not improve their father's disposition towards them, but as their  independent pensions enabled them to keep out of his way, his rage fell  with all the greater intensity on his two unhappy daughters. Their  situation soon became so intolerable, that the elder, contriving to  elude the close supervision under which she was kept, forwarded to the  pope a petition, relating the cruel treatment to which she was  subjected, and praying His Holiness either to give her in marriage or  place her in a convent. Clement VIII took pity on her; compelled  Francesco Cenci to give her a dowry of sixty thousand crowns, and  married her to Carlo Gabrielli, of a noble family of Gubbio. Francesco  driven nearly frantic with rage when he saw this victim released from  his clutches.    About the same time death relieved him from two other encumbrances: his  sons Rocco and Cristoforo were killed within a year of each other; the  latter by a bungling medical practitioner whose name is unknown; the  former by Paolo Corso di Massa, in the streets of Rome. This came as a  relief to Francesco, whose avarice pursued his sons even after their  death, far he intimated to the priest that he would not spend a farthing  on funeral services. They were accordingly borne to the paupers' graves  which he had caused to be prepared for them, and when he saw them both  interred, he cried out that he was well rid of such good-for-nothing  children, but that he should be perfectly happy only when the remaining  five were buried with the first two, and that when he had got rid of the  last he himself would burn down his palace as a bonfire to celebrate the  event.    But Francesco took every precaution against his second daughter,  Beatrice Cenci, following the example of her elder sister. She was then  a child of twelve or thirteen years of age, beautiful and innocent as an  angel. Her long fair hair, a beauty seen so rarely in Italy, that  Raffaelle, believing it divine, has appropriated it to all his Madonnas,  curtained a lovely forehead, and fell in flowing locks over her  shoulders. Her azure eyes bore a heavenly expression; she was of middle  height, exquisitely proportioned; and during the rare moments when a  gleam of happiness allowed her natural character to display itself, she  was lively, joyous, and sympathetic, but at the same time evinced a firm  and decided disposition.    To make sure of her custody, Francesco kept her shut up in a remote  apartment of his palace, the key of which he kept in his own possession.  There, her unnatural and inflexible gaoler daily brought her some food.  Up to the age of thirteen, which she had now reached, he had behaved to  her with the most extreme harshness and severity; but now, to poor  Beatrice's great astonishment, he all at once became gentle and even  tender. Beatrice was a child no longer; her beauty expanded like a  flower; and Francesco, a stranger to no crime, however heinous, had  marked her for his own.    Brought up as she had been, uneducated, deprived of all society, even  that of her stepmother, Beatrice knew not good from evil: her ruin was  comparatively easy to compass; yet Francesco, to accomplish his  diabolical purpose, employed all the means at his command. Every night  she was awakened by a concert of music which seemed to come from  Paradise. When she mentioned this to her father, he left her in this  belief, adding that if she proved gentle and obedient she would be  rewarded by heavenly sights, as well as heavenly sounds.    One night it came to pass that as the young girl was reposing, her head  supported on her elbow, and listening to a delightful harmony, the  chamber door suddenly opened, and from the darkness of her own room she  beheld a suite of apartments brilliantly illuminated, and sensuous with  perfumes; beautiful youths and girls, half clad, such as she had seen in  the pictures of Guido and Raffaelle, moved to and fro in these  apartments, seeming full of joy and happiness: these were the ministers  to the pleasures of Francesco, who, rich as a king, every night revelled  in the orgies of Alexander, the wedding revels of Lucrezia, and the  excesses of Tiberius at Capri. After an hour, the door closed, and the  seductive vision vanished, leaving Beatrice full of "]]]
