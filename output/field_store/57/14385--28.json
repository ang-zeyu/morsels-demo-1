The prolonged slavery of woman is the darkest page in human history. A  survey of the condition of the race through those barbarous periods,  when physical force governed the world, when the motto, \"might makes  right,\" was the law, enables one to account, for the origin of woman's  subjection to man without referring the fact to the general  inferiority of the sex, or Nature's law.    Writers on this question differ as to the cause of the universal  degradation of woman in all periods and nations.    One of the greatest minds of the century has thrown a ray of light on  this gloomy picture by tracing the origin of woman's slavery to the  same principle of selfishness and love of power in man that has thus  far dominated all weaker nations and classes. This brings hope of  final emancipation, for as all nations and classes are gradually, one  after another, asserting and maintaining their independence, the path  is clear for woman to follow. The slavish instinct of an oppressed  class has led her to toil patiently through the ages, giving all and  asking little, cheerfully sharing with man all perils and privations  by land and sea, that husband and sons might attain honor and success.  Justice and freedom for herself is her latest and highest demand.    Another writer asserts that the tyranny of man over woman has its  roots, after all, in his nobler feelings; his love, his chivalry, and  his desire to protect woman in the barbarous periods of pillage, lust,  and war. But wherever the roots may be traced, the results at this  hour are equally disastrous to woman. Her best interests and happiness  do not seem to have been consulted in the arrangements made for her  protection. She has been bought and sold, caressed and crucified at  the will and pleasure of her master. But if a chivalrous desire to  protect woman has always been the mainspring of man's dominion over  her, it should have prompted him to place in her hands the same  weapons of defense he has found to be most effective against wrong and  oppression.    It is often asserted that as woman has always been man's  slave--subject--inferior--dependent, under all forms of government and  religion, slavery must be her normal condition. This might have some  weight had not the vast majority of men also been enslaved for  centuries to kings and popes, and orders of nobility, who, in the  progress of civilization, have reached complete equality. And did we  not also see the great changes in woman's condition, the marvelous  transformation in her character, from"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/28026"],[0,"Great Pianists on Piano Playing (#2)"],[1,"like ordinary  mortals who have to content themselves at the foot of Parnassus. It has  been my privilege to know thirty or more of the most eminent artists,  and some have become good personal friends. It is interesting to observe  how several very different types of individuals may succeed in winning  public favor as virtuosos. Indeed, except for the long-haired caricature  which the public accepts as the conventional virtuoso there is no  \"virtuoso type.\" Here is a business man, here an artist, here an  engineer, here a jurist, here an actor, here a poet and here a freak,  all of them distinguished performers. Perhaps the enthusiastic  music-lover will resent the idea of a freak becoming famous as a  pianist, but I have known no less than three men who could not possibly  be otherwise described, but who have nevertheless made both fame and  fortune as virtuosos.      FREAK PIANISTS    The anthropologist who chooses to conduct special investigations of  freaks can find no more entertaining field than that of the remarkable  freaks of the brain, shown in the cases of some astonishing performers  whose intelligence and mental capacity in other ways has been  negligible. The classic case of Blind Tom, for instance, was that of a  freak not so very far removed in kind from the Siamese Twins, or General  Tom Thumb. Born a slave in Georgia, and wholly without what teachers  would term a musical education, Blind Tom amazed many of the most  conservative musicians of his time. It was possible for him to repeat  difficult compositions after hearing them played only once. I conversed  with him a number of years ago in New York, only to find that  intellectually and physically he was allied to the _cretin_.    Blind Tom's peculiar ability has led many hasty commentators to conclude  that music is a wholly separate mental faculty to be found particularly  in a more or less shiftless and irresponsible class of gifted but  intellectually limited human beings. The few cases of men and women  whose musical talent seems to eclipse their minds so that they remain in  utter darkness to everything else in life, should not be taken as a  basis for judging other artists of real genius and undisputed mental  breadth. I have in mind, however, the case of one pianist who is very  widely known and highly lauded, but who is very slightly removed from  the class of Blind Tom. A trained alienist, one acquainted with the  difference between the eccentricities which frequently accompany  greatness and the unconscious physical and psychical evidences of idiocy  which so clearly agree with the antics of the chimpanzee or the droll  Capuchin monkeys, might find in the performer to whom I refer a subject  for some very interesting, not to say startling reflections. Few have  ever been successful in inducing this pianist to talk upon any other  subject than music for more than a few minutes at a time. Another  pianist, who was distinguished as a Liszt pupil, and who toured America  repeatedly, seemed to have a hatred for the piano that amounted to an  obsession. \"Look,\" he exclaimed, \"I am its slave. It has sent me round  and round the world, night after night, year after year. It has cursed  me like a wandering Jew. No rest, no home, no liberty. Do you wonder  that I drink to forget it?\"      A PATHETIC EXAMPLE    And drink he did in Bacchanalian measure! One time he gave an  unconscious exhibition of his technical ability that, while regrettable,  would have been of immense interest to psychologists who are seeking to  prove that music depends upon a separate operation of a special  \"faculty.\" During his American tours I called frequently upon this  virtuoso for the purpose of investigating his method of playing. He was  rarely free from the influence of alcohol for more than a few hours at  a time. One morning it was necessary for me to see him professionally,  and when I found him at his hotel he was in a truly disgraceful  condition. I remember that he was unable to stand, from the fact that he  fell upon me while I was sitting in a Morris chair. He was barely able  to talk, and just prior to my leaving he insisted upon scrawling upon  his visiting card, \"Zur freundlichen Errinerung, auf einen sehr spaeten  Abend.\" (Friendly remembrances of a very late evening.) Since it was  still very early in the morning, it may be realized that he had lost all  idea of his whereabouts. Nevertheless, he sat at the piano keyboard and  played tremendously difficult compositions by Liszt and  Brahms--compositions which compelled his hands to leap from one part of  the keyboard to the other as in the case of the Liszt _Campanella_. He  never missed a note until he lost his balance upon the piano stool and  fell to the floor. Disgusting and pathetic as the exhibition was, I  could not help feeling that I was witnessing a marvelous instance of  automatism, that wonderful power of the mind working through the body to  reproduce, apparently without effort or thought, operations which have  been repeated so many times that they have become \"second nature.\" More  than this, it indicated clearly that while the better part of the man's  body was \"dead to the world,\" the faculty he had cultivated to the  highest extent still remained alive. Some years later this man succumbed  to alcoholism.      THE PIANIST OF TO-DAY    Contrasted with a type of this kind may be mentioned such men as Sauer,  Rachmaninov, d'Albert, Paderewski, Godowsky, Bachaus, Rosenthal, Pauer,  Joseffy, Stojowski, Scharwenka, Gabrilowitsch, Hofmann, Bauer, Lhevinne,  to say nothing of the ladies, Bloomfield-Zeisler, Carreno, Goodson, _et  al._, many of whom are intellectual giants. Most all are exceedingly  regular in their habits, and at least two are strong temperance  advocates. Intellectually, pianists of this class represent a very  remarkable kind of mentality. One is impressed with the surprising  quickness with which their brains operate even in ordinary conversation.  Speaking in alien languages, they find comparatively little difficulty  in expressing themselves with rapidity and fluency. Very few great  singers ever acquire a similar ease. These pianists are wonderfully well  read, many being acquainted with the literature of three or more tongues  in the original. Indeed, it is not unusual to find them skipping through  several languages during ordinary conversation without realizing that  they are performing linguistic feats that would put the average college  graduate to shame. They are familiar with art, science, politics,  manufactures, even in their most recent developments. \"What is your  favorite type of aeroplane?\" asked one some years ago in the  kindergarten days of cloud navigation. I told him that I had made no  choice, since I had never seen a flying machine, despite the fact that  I was a native of the country that gave it birth. He then vouchsafed his  opinions and entered into a physical and mechanical discussion of the  matter, indicating that he had spent hours in getting the whole subject  straightened out in his mind. This same man, a German, knew whole cantos  of the _Inferno_ by heart, and could repeat long scenes from _King Lear_  with a very creditable English accent.    The average American \"tired business man\" who is inclined to look upon  the touring virtuoso as \"only a pianist\" would be immensely surprised if  he were called upon to compare his store of \"universal\" information with  that of the performer. He would soon see that his long close confinement  behind the bars of the dollar sign had made him the intellectual  inferior of the musician he almost ignores. But it is hardly fair to  compare these famous interpreters with the average \"tired business man.\"  They are the Cecil Rhodes, the Thomas Edisons, the Maurice Maeterlincks  of their fields. It is easy enough to find musicians of smaller life  opportunities basking in their ignorance and conceit.    While the virtuoso may be described as intellectual in the broader sense  of the term, he usually has a great fear of becoming academic. He  aspires to be artistic rather than scholarly. He strives to elevate  rather than to teach--in the strictly pedagogical sense. Some of the  greatest performers have been notoriously weak as teachers. They do not  seek the walls of the college, neither do they long for the cheap  _Bohemianism_ that so many of the French feuilletonists delight in  describing. (Why should the immorality of the artist's life be laid at  the doors of fair Bohemia?) The artist's life is wrapped up in making  his readings of master works more significant, more eloquent, more  beautiful. He is interested in everything that contributes to his  artistry, whether it be literature, science, history, art or the technic  of his own interpretative development. He penetrates the various mystic  problems which surround piano playing by the infallible process of  persistent study and reflection. The psychical phase of his work  interests him immensely, particularly the phenomena of personal  attraction--often called magnetism.      THE MAGIC OF MAGNETISM    Magnetism is surely one of the most enviable possessions of the  successful pianist. Just what magnetism is and how it comes to be, few  psychologists attempt to relate. We all have our theories, just why one  pianist who often blunders as readily as a Rubinstein, or who displays  his many shortcomings at every concert can invariably draw larger  audiences and arouse more applause than his confrere with weaker vital  forces, although he be admittedly a better technician, a more highly  educated gentleman and perhaps a more sensitive musician.    Charles Frohman, keenest of theatrical producers, attributed the actor's  success to \"vitality,\" and in doing this he merely chose one of the  weaker synonyms of magnetism. Vitality in this sense does not imply  great bodily strength. It is rather soul-strength, mind-strength,  life-strength."]]]
