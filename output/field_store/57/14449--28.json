It was only  by taking advantage of these breaks that the wolves had succeeded at all  in wounding the selected cow, but she was far from being disabled, and  it seemed that Lobo at length lost patience with his followers, for he  left his position on the hill, and, uttering a deep roar, dashed toward  the herd. The terrified rank broke at his charge, and he sprang in among  them. Then the cattle scattered like the pieces of a bursting bomb. Away  went the chosen victim, but ere she had gone twenty-five yards Lobo was  upon her. Seizing her by the neck, he suddenly held back with all his  force and so threw her heavily to the ground. The shock must have been  tremendous, for the heifer was thrown heels over head. Lobo also turned  a somersault, but immediately recovered himself, and his followers  falling on the poor cow, killed her in a few seconds. Lobo took no part  in the killing--after having thrown the victim, he seemed to say, \"Now,  why could not some of you have done that at once without wasting so much  time?\"    The man now rode up shouting, the wolves as usual retired, and he,  having a bottle of strychnine, quickly poisoned the carcass in three  places, then went away, knowing they would return to feed, as they had  killed the animal themselves. But next morning, on going to look for  his expected victims, he found that, although the wolves had eaten the  heifer, they had carefully cut out and thrown aside all those parts that  had been poisoned.    The dread of this great wolf spread yearly among the ranchmen, and  each year a larger price was set on his head, until at last it reached  $1,000, an unparalleled wolf-bounty, surely; many a good man has been  hunted down for less, Tempted by the promised reward, a Texan ranger  named Tannerey came one day galloping up the canyon of the Currumpaw. He  had a superb outfit for wolf-hunting--the best of guns and horses, and a  pack of enormous wolf-hounds. Far out on the plains of the Panhandle,  he and his dogs had killed many a wolf, and now he never doubted that,  within a few days, Old Lobo's scalp would dangle at his saddlebow.    Away they went bravely on their hunt in the gray dawn of a summer  morning, and soon the great dogs gave joyous tongue to say that they  were already on the track of their quarry. Within two miles, the grizzly  band of Currumpaw leaped into view, and the chase grew fast and furious.  The part of the wolf-hounds was merely to hold the wolves at bay till  the hunter could ride up and shoot them, and this usually was easy on  the open plains of Texas; but here a new feature of the country came  into play, and showed how well Lobo had chosen his range; for the rocky  canyons of the Currumpaw and its tributaries intersect the prairies in  every direction. The old wolf at once made for the nearest of these  and by crossing it got rid of the horseman. His band then scattered and  thereby scattered the dogs, and when they reunited at a distant point  of course all of the dogs did not turn up, and the wolves, no longer  outnumbered, turned on their pursuers and killed or desperately wounded  them all. That night when Tannerey mustered his dogs, only six of them  returned, and of these, two were terribly lacerated. This hunter made  two other attempts to capture the royal scalp, but neither of them was  more successful than the first, and on the last occasion his best horse  met its death by a fall; so he gave up the chase in disgust and went  back to Texas, leaving Lobo more than ever the despot of the region.    Next year, two other hunters appeared, determined to win the promised  bounty. Each believed he could destroy this noted wolf, the first by  means of a newly devised poison, which was to be laid out in an entirely  new manner; the other a French Canadian, by poison assisted with certain  spells and charms, for he firmly believed that Lobo was a veritable  \"loup-garou,\" and could not be killed by ordinary means. But cunningly  compounded poisons, charms, and incantations were all of no avail  against this grizzly devastator. He made his weekly rounds and daily  banquets as aforetime, and before many weeks had passed, Calone and  Laloche gave up in despair and went elsewhere to hunt.    In the spring of 1893, after his unsuccessful attempt to capture Lobo,  Joe Calone had a humiliating experience, which seems to show that the  big wolf simply scorned his enemies, and had absolute confidence in  himself. Calone's farm was on a small tributary of the Currumpaw, in a  picturesque canyon, and among the rocks of this very canyon, within a  thousand yards of the house, Old Lobo and his mate selected their den  and raised their family that season. There they lived all summer and  killed Joe's cattle, sheep, and dogs, but laughed at all his poisons and  traps and rested securely among the recesses of the cavernous cliffs,  while Joe vainly racked his brain for some method of smoking them out,  or of reaching them with dynamite. But they escaped entirely unscathed,  and continued their ravages as before. \"There's where he lived all last  summer,\" said Joe, pointing to the face of the cliff, \"and I couldn't do  a thing with him. I was like a fool to him.\"    II    This history, gathered so far from the cowboys, I found hard to  believe until, in the fall of 1893, I made the acquaintance of the wily  marauder, and at length came to know him more thoroughly than anyone  else. Some years before, in the Bingo days, I had been a wolf-hunter,  but my occupations since then had been of another sort, chaining me to  stool and desk. I was much in need of a change, and when a friend, who  was also a ranch-owner on the Currumpaw, asked me to come to New Mexico  and try if I could do anything with this predatory pack, I accepted the  invitation and, eager to make the acquaintance of its king, was as soon  as possible among the mesas of that region. I spent some time riding  about to learn the country, and at intervals my guide would point to the  skeleton of a cow to which the hide still adhered, and remark, \"That's  some of his work.\"    It became quite clear to me that, in this rough country, it was useless  to think of pursuing Lobo with hounds and horses, so that poison or  traps were the only available expedients. At present we had no traps  large enough, so I set to work with poison.    I need not enter into the details of a hundred devices that I employed  to circumvent this 'loup-garou'; there was no combination of strychnine,  arsenic, cyanide, or prussic acid, that I did not essay; there was no  manner of flesh that I did not try as bait; but morning after morning,  as I rode forth to learn the result, I found that all my efforts had  been useless. The old king was too cunning for me. A single instance  will show his wonderful sagacity. Acting on the hint of an old trapper,  I melted some cheese together with the kidney fat of a freshly killed  heifer, stewing it in a china dish, and cutting it with a bone knife to  avoid the taint of metal.    When the mixture was cool, I cut it into lumps, and making a hole in one  side of each lump, I inserted a large dose of strychnine and cyanide,  contained, in a capsule that was impermeable by any odor; finally I  sealed the holes up with pieces of the cheese itself. During the whole  process, I wore a pair of gloves steeped in the hot blood of the heifer,  and even avoided breathing on the baits. When all was ready, I put them  in a raw-hide bag rubbed all over with blood, and rode forth dragging  the liver and kidneys of the beef at the end of a rope. With this I  made a ten-mile circuit, dropping a bait at each quarter of a mile, and  taking the utmost care, always, not to touch any with my hands.    Lobo, generally, came into this part of the range in the early part of  each week, and passed the latter part, it was supposed, around the base  of Sierra Grande. This was Monday, and that same evening, as we were  about to retire, I heard the deep bass howl of his majesty. On hearing  it one of the boys briefly remarked, \"There he is, we'll see.\"    The next morning I went forth, eager to know the result. I soon came  on the fresh trail of the robbers, with Lobo in the lead--his track was  always easily distinguished. An ordinary wolf's forefoot is 4 1/2 inches  long, that of a large wolf 4 3/4 inches, but Lobo's, as measured a  number of times, was 5 1/2 inches from claw to heel; I afterward found  that his other proportions were commensurate, for he stood three feet  high at the shoulder, and weighed 150 pounds. His trail, therefore,  though obscured by those of his followers, was never difficult to trace.  The pack had soon found the track of my drag, and as usual followed it.  I could see that Lobo had come to the first bait, sniffed about it, and  finally had picked it up.    Then I could not conceal my delight. \"I've got him at last,\" I  exclaimed; \"I shall find him stark within a mile,\" and I galloped on  with eager eyes fixed on the great broad track in the dust. It led me to  the second bait and that also was gone. How I exulted--I surely have  him now and perhaps several of his band. But there was the broad pawmark  still on the drag; and though I stood in the stirrup and scanned the  plain I saw nothing that looked like a dead wolf. Again I followed--to  find now that the third bait was gone--and the king-wolf's track led  on to the fourth, there to learn that he had not really taken a bait  at all, but had merely carried them in his mouth, Then having piled the  three on the fourth, he scattered filth over them to express his utter  contempt for my devices. After this he left my drag and went about his  business with the pack he guarded so effectively.

D.      Medicines may be administered to cattle in many ways. The channel and  method of administration depend on whether a general or local effect is  desired, the condition of the animal, and the nature of the medicine that  is to be given. The easiest method, and therefore the most common, is to  give ordinary remedies by the mouth with the food, with drink, or  separately. There, are, however, some conditions in which medicines  administered in this way will not act promptly enough, or wherein a desired  effect of the medicine on a distant part of the body is wholly lacking  unless it is applied in some other way.    The various methods of administering medicines to cattle will be considered  below.    BY THE MOUTH.--The simplest way to give medicines by the mouth is to mix  them with the food or water. This can be done when the medicine is in the  form of a powder or fluid, if but a small quantity is to be given, if it  does not have a taste that is disagreeable to the animal and is not so  irritant as to injure the lining membranes of the mouth and throat.    The usual method of administering bulky or unpalatable doses is to mix them  with a fluid vehicle, such as water, milk, molasses, or broth, and give  from a bottle. A dose given in this way is known as a \"drench.\" In  administering a drench the head of the animal should be elevated a little  by an assistant. This is best accomplished when standing on the left side  of the cow's head and by grasping the nose with the thumb and fingers of  the right hand inserted in the nostrils; with the left hand beneath the  chin the head is further raised and supported. If the animal is unruly, it  may be tied in a stall or placed in a stanchion. The medicine can now be  poured into the mouth by inserting the neck of the bottle between the lips  on the right side. Care must be taken to avoid getting the bottle between  the back teeth. The mouth of the bottle should be inserted as far as the  middle of the tongue and the contents poured slowly. If the cow coughs, the  head must at once be lowered to permit the fluid to escape from the larynx.  If medicine is given during coughing, some of the dose may pass down the  windpipe to the lungs and cause a severe or a fatal pneumonia. This is  especially to be guarded against when the throat is partly paralyzed or  insensitive, as in parturient paresis (milk fever). In this disease it has  often happened that drenches have been poured into the lungs, thus killing  the cow.    The quantity of fluid to be given in a drench depends upon the effect  desired and the nature of the medicine. In impactions of the stomach very  large quantities of fluid may be given--as much as a gallon or several  gallons at a time. Usually, however, it is not customary or desirable to  give more than from 1 to 2 quarts at a dose, and not more than a pint  unless it is necessary on account of the irritant quality of the drug that  has to be shielded with a large quantity of the vehicle.    Soluble medicines should be completely dissolved before they are given;  insoluble ones should be finely divided by powdering or by shaking, and  should be well agitated and mixed immediately before they are given. In the  latter case a menstruum with considerable body, such as molasses or  flaxseed tea or milk, will help to hold solids or oils in suspension until  swallowed.    _Balls_ are large pills adapted for the larger animals. Powders or gums are  sometimes mixed with an adhesive substance and rolled into balls for the  purpose of convenience of administration. Balls are not used so much and  are not so well adapted to the medication of cattle as of horses. The  process of solution is slower in the paunch of a cow than in the stomach of  a horse; if the cow is so sick as to have stopped ruminating, a ball may  get covered up and lost in the mass of material in the paunch and so lie  for days, producing no effect whatever.    _Capsules_ are shells or envelopes made of soluble gelatin in which powders  or liquids may be inclosed. Capsules and balls are administered by being  placed on the tongue well back in the mouth while the tongue is drawn  forward and the mouth is held open by a block of wood between the back  teeth. The ball should be dropped, the tongue released, and the block  removed as nearly simultaneously as possible, so that the backward carriage  of the tongue will throw the ball into the throat and lead to its being  swallowed. In introducing the ball care must be taken to avoid having the  hand cut or crushed. After a little experience it is possible to do away  with the block of wood.    BY THE STOMACH.--Medicines are introduced directly into the first stomach  by the use of an esophageal tube or through the cannula of a trocar passed  into the paunch through the side. This method is used in the treatment of  diseases of digestion.    BY THE RECTUM.--Medicines are usually administered by the rectum for the  purpose of controlling the bowels and for the treatment of local diseases.  Sometimes, however, medicines that have a general effect are given in this  way when, for any reason, it is not possible or convenient to give them  through the mouth. Only drugs that are readily absorbed should be given per  rectum for a general effect and in somewhat larger dose or more frequently  than when given by the mouth. Such stimulants as ether, alcohol, or the  aromatic spirits of ammonia, diluted with from four to six times their bulk  of warm water, may be used in this way.    Rectal injections, or enemata, are used in the treatment of constipation.  If it is the purpose of the injection to soften hardened fecal masses, the  water should be comfortably warm and may have a little clean soap in it. If  it is the purpose of the injection to stimulate sluggish bowels to  contraction, the water may be cold.    In giving rectal injections a rectal syringe may be used, or, better, a  piece of one-half to three-quarter inch rubber hose 5 feet long with a tin  funnel attached to one end. The hose is soaped or oiled and introduced  slowly and gently into the rectum 2 or 3 feet. The fluid is then slowly  poured into the funnel and allowed to gravitate into the rectum. The same  apparatus may be used for feeding by the rectum.    BY THE VAGINA.--Medicines are inserted into the vagina, and through the  vagina into the womb, in a manner similar to that of rectal administration.  Most of the medication made use of in this way is for the local treatment  of these organs. Following calving, during outbreaks of abortion, and in an  infectious disease of the vagina, such injections become necessary.    BY THE UDDER.--Injections into the udder are now regularly made in the  treatment of parturient paresis (milk fever). For this purpose a 1 per cent  solution of iodid of potassium is commonly employed, although some other  solutions and oxygen gas are also used. In making this injection so many  precautions are necessary in relation to the sterilization of the apparatus  and the teats and skin that this work should be left to a skilled  veterinarian. The introduction of even a minute quantity of infectious dirt  may cause the loss of the udder. For making this injection one may use one  of the prepared sets of apparatus or a milking tube and funnel connected by  a piece of small rubber hose. The apparatus should be boiled and kept  wrapped in a clean towel until needed. The udder and teats and the hands of  the operator must be well disinfected, and the solution must be freshly  made with recently boiled water kept in a sterile bottle. The udder should  be emptied of milk before the injection is made. After all these  precautions have been observed the milking tube may be inserted and through  it one-half pint of solution introduced by gravity air pressure or by  syringe. There is practically no danger in this mode of treatment if it is  properly carried out.    Injections into the udder are sometimes made in the treatment of garget,  but so far with indifferent success.    BY THE NOSTRILS.--An animal may be caused to inhale medicine in the form of  gas or vapor or to snuff up a fine powder. Sometimes, for the purpose of  local treatment, fluids are injected into the nose.    A medicine inhaled may have either a local or a general effect.    Medicated steam, carrying the volatile products of compound cresol  solution, carbolic acid, balsam of Peru, compound tincture of benzoin,  tincture of iodin, etc., may be liberated beneath the nostrils of a cow so  that she must inhale these soothing vapors; but such treatment is not so  common for cattle as for horses. In producing general anesthesia, or  insensibility to pain, the vapor of chloroform or ether is administered by  the nostrils. As a preliminary to this it is necessary to cast and confine  the animal. Great care is necessary to avoid complete stoppage of the heart  or breathing.    BY THE TRACHEA.--Medicines are injected into the trachea, or windpipe, in  the treatment of some forms of diseases of the lungs, and especially in  that form of bronchitis or pneumonia that is caused by lungworms. For this  injection a large hypodermic syringe, fitted with a very thick, strong  needle, is used. The needle is to be inserted about the middle of the neck  "]]]
