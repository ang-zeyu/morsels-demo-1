I guess they'll pull through somehow. The  porcupines are all right, as you will presently see if you read this  book. They don't have to worry. Down in the bed of the trout stream the  trout eggs are getting ready--getting ready. And out on the lake itself  the frost is at work, and the ice-sheet is forming, and under that cold,  white lid the Glimmerglass will wait till another year brings round  another spring-time--the spring-time that will surely come to all of us  if only we hold on long enough._    _Chicago, December, 1901._          THE BIOGRAPHY OF A BEAVER      A BROAD, flat tail came down on the water with a whack that sent the  echoes flying back and forth across the pond, and its owner ducked his  head, arched his back, and dived to the bottom. It was a very curious  tail, for besides being so oddly paddle-shaped it was covered with what  looked like scales, but were really sections and indentations of hard,  horny, blackish-gray skin. Except its owner's relations, there was no  one else in all the animal kingdom who had one like it. But the  strangest thing about it was the many different ways in which he used  it. Just now it was his rudder--and a very good rudder, too.    In a moment his little brown head reappeared, and he and his brothers  and sisters went chasing each other round and round the pond, ducking  and diving and splashing, raising such a commotion that they sent the  ripples washing all along the grassy shores, and having the jolliest  kind of a time. It isn't the usual thing for young beavers to be out in  broad daylight, but all this happened in the good old days before the  railways came, when northern Michigan was less infested with men than  it is now.    When the youngsters wanted a change they climbed up onto a log, and  nudged and hunched each other, poking their noses into one another's fat  little sides, and each trying to shove his brother or sister back into  the water. By and by they scrambled out on the bank, and then, when  their fur had dripped a little, they set to work to comb it. Up they sat  on their hind legs and tails--the tail was a stool now, you see--and  scratched their heads and shoulders with the long brown claws of their  small, black, hairy hands. Then the hind feet came up one at a time, and  combed and stroked their sides till the moisture was gone and the fur  was soft and smooth and glossy as velvet. After that they had to have  another romp. They were not half as graceful on land as they had been in  the water. In fact they were not graceful at all, and the way they stood  around on their hind legs, and shuffled, and pranced, and wheeled like  baby hippopotami, and slapped the ground with their tails, was one of  the funniest sights in the heart of the woods. And the funniest and  liveliest of them all was the one who owned that tail--the tail which,  when I last saw it, was lying on the ground in front of Charlie Roop's  shack. He was the one whom I shall call the Beaver--with a big B.    But even young beavers will sometimes grow tired of play, and at last  they all lay down on the grass in the warm, quiet sunshine of the autumn  afternoon. The wind had gone to sleep, the pond glittered like steel in  its bed of grassy beaver-meadow, the friendly woods stood guard all  around, the enemy was far away, and it was a very good time for five  furry little babies to take a nap.    The city in which the tail first made its appearance was a very ancient  one, and may have been the oldest town on the North American continent.  Nobody knows when the first stick was laid in the dam that changed a  small natural pond into a large artificial one, and thus opened the way  for further municipal improvements; but it was probably centuries ago,  and for all we can tell it may have been thousands of years back in the  past. Generation after generation of beavers had worked on that dam,  building it a little higher and a little higher, a little longer and a  little longer, year after year; and raising their lodges as the pond  rose around them. Theirs was a maritime city, for most of its streets  were of water, like those of Venice; rich cargoes of food-stuffs came  floating to its very doors, and they themselves were navigators from  their earliest youth, and took to the water as naturally as ducks or  Englishmen. They were lumbermen, too, and when the timber was all cut  from along the shores of the pond they dug canals across the low, level,  marshy ground, back to the higher land where the birch and the poplar  still grew, and floated the branches and the smaller logs down the  artificial water-ways. And there were land roads, as well as canals, for  here and there narrow trails crossed the swamp, showing where  generations of busy workers had passed back and forth between the felled  tree and the water's edge. Streets, canals, public works, dwellings,  commerce, lumbering, rich stores laid up for the winter--what more do  you want to constitute a city, even if the houses are few in number, and  the population somewhat smaller than that of London or New York?    [Illustration: \"_On the grass in the warm, quiet sunshine of an autumn  afternoon._\"]    There was a time, not very long before the Beaver was born, when for a  few years the city was deserted. The trappers had swept through the  country, and the citizens' skulls had been hung up on the bushes, while  their skins went to the great London fur market. Few were left alive,  and those few were driven from their homes and scattered through the  woods. The trappers decided that the ground was worked out, and most of  them pushed on to the north and west in search of regions not yet  depopulated. Then, one by one, the beavers came back to their old  haunts. The broken dam was repaired; new lodges were built, and new  beavers born in them; and again the ancient town was alive with the play  of the babies and the labors of the civil engineers. Not as populous,  perhaps, as it had once been, but alive, and busy, and happy. And so it  was when our Beaver came into the world.    The first year of his life was an easy one, especially the winter, when  there was little for anyone to do except to eat, to sleep, and now and  then to fish for the roots of the yellow water-lily in the soft mud at  the bottom of the pond. During that season he probably accomplished more  than his parents did, for if he could not toil he could at least grow.  Of course they may have been growing, too, but it was less noticeable in  them than in him. Not only was he increasing in size and weight, but he  was storing up strength and strenuousness for the work that lay before  him. It would take much muscle to force those long yellow teeth of his  through the hard, tough flesh of the maple or the birch or the poplar.  It would take vigor and push and enterprise to roll the heavy billets  of wood over the grass-tufts to the edge of the water. And, most of all,  it would take strength and nerve and determination to tear himself away  from a steel trap and leave a foot behind. So it was well for the  youngster that for a time he had nothing to do but grow.    Spring came at last, and many of the male beavers prepared to leave home  for a while. The ladies seemed to prefer not to be bothered by the  presence of men-folk during the earliest infancy of the children; so the  men, probably nothing loath, took advantage of the opportunity to see  something of the world, wandering by night up and down the streams, and  hiding by day in burrows under the banks. For a time they enjoyed it,  but as the summer dragged by they came straggling home one after  another. The new babies who had arrived in their absence had passed the  most troublesome age, and it was time to begin work again. The dam and  the lodges needed repairs, and there was much food to be gathered and  laid up for the coming winter.    Now, on a dark autumn night, behold the young Beaver toiling with might  and main. His parents have felled a tree, and it is his business to help  them cut up the best portions and carry them home. He gnaws off a small  branch, seizes the butt end between his teeth, swings it over his  shoulder, and makes for the water, keeping his head twisted around to  the right or left so that the end of the branch may trail on the ground  behind him. Sometimes he even rises on his hind legs, and walks almost  upright, with his broad, strong tail for a prop to keep him from tipping  over backward if his load happens to catch on something. Arrived at the  canal or at the edge of the pond, he jumps in and swims for town, still  carrying the branch over his shoulder, and finally leaves it on the  growing pile in front of his father's lodge. Or perhaps the stick is too  large and too heavy to be carried in such a way. In that case it must be  cut into short billets and rolled, as a cant-hook man rolls a log down a  skidway. Only the Beaver has no cant-hook to help him, and no skidway,  either. All he can do is to push with all his might, and there are so  many, many grass-tufts and little hillocks in the way! And sometimes the  billet rolls down into a hollow, and then it is very hard to get it out  again. He works like a beaver, and pushes and shoves and toils with  tremendous energy, but I am afraid that more than one choice stick never  reaches the water.    These were his first tasks. Later on he learned to fell trees himself.  Standing up on his hind legs and tail, with his hands braced against the  trunk, he would hold his head sidewise, open his mouth wide, set his  teeth against the bark, and bring his jaws together with a savage nip  that left a deep gash in the side of the tree. A second nip deepened the  gash, and gave it more of a downward slant, and two or three more  carried it still farther into the tough wood. Then he would choose a new  spot a little farther down, and start a second gash,"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/27975"],[0,"Delineations of the Ox Tribe: The Natural History of Bulls, Bisons, and (#2)"],[1,"          32    13.

Alderney Cow, after Howitt                               189          INTRODUCTION.      Ruminantia is the term used by naturalists to designate those  mammiferous quadrupeds which chew the cud; or, in other words, which  swallow their food, in the first instance, with a very slight  mastication, and afterwards regurgitate it, in order that it may undergo  a second and more complete mastication: this second operation is called  ruminating, or chewing the cud. The order of animals which possess this  peculiarity, is divided into nine groups or genera, namely:--        CAMELS.      LLAMAS.      MUSKS.      DEER.      GIRAFFES.      ANTELOPES.      GOATS.      SHEEP.      OXEN.    The last named forms the subject of the following pages, and is called,  in zoological language, the _Genus Bos_, in popular language, the OX  TRIBE.    One of the most interesting occupations which the wide field of Zoology  offers to the naturalist, is the investigation of those remarkable  adaptations of organs to functions, and of these again to the  necessities and well-being of the entire animal. Nor does it in the  least diminish our interest in the investigation of individual  adaptations, or our admiration on becoming acquainted with them, that we  know, _a priori_, this universal truth, that all the constituents of  every organised body, be that organisation what it may, are invariably  adapted, in the most perfect manner, to each other, and to the whole.    It is by a knowledge of this exact harmony in the animal economy, that  the comparative anatomist can determine, with almost unerring precision,  the genus, or even species of an animal, by an examination of any  important part of its organisation, as the teeth, stomach, bones, or  extremities. In some cases, a single bone, or even the fragment of a  bone, is sufficient to convey an idea of the entire animal to which it  belonged.    In illustration of this:--if the viscera of an animal are so organised  as only to be fitted for the digestion of recent flesh, we find that the  jaws are so contracted as to fit them for devouring prey; the claws for  seizing and tearing it to pieces; the teeth for cutting and dividing its  flesh; the entire system of the limbs, or organs of motion, for pursuing  and overtaking it; and the organs of sense for discovering it at a  distance. Moreover, the brain of the animal is also endowed with  instincts sufficient for concealing itself, and for laying plans to  catch its necessary prey.    Again, we are well aware that all _hoofed_ animals must necessarily be  herbivorous, or vegetable feeders, because they are possessed of no  means of seizing prey. It is also evident, having no other use for their  fore-legs than to support their bodies, that they have no occasion for  a shoulder so vigorously organised as that of carnivorous animals; owing  to which they have no clavicles, and their shoulder-blades are  proportionally narrow. Having also no occasion to turn their forearms,  their radius is joined by ossification to the ulna, or is at least  articulated by gynglymus with the humerus. Their food being entirely  herbaceous, requires teeth with flat surfaces, on purpose to bruise the  seeds and plants on which they feed. For this purpose, also, these  surfaces require to be unequal, and are, consequently, composed of  alternate perpendicular layers of enamel and softer bone. Teeth of this  structure necessarily require horizontal motions to enable them to  triturate, or grind down the herbaceous food; and accordingly the  condyles of the jaw could not be formed into such confined joints as in  the carnivorous animals, but must have a flattened form, correspondent  to sockets in the temporal bones. The depressions, also, of the temporal  bones, having smaller muscles to contain, are narrower and not so deep;  and so on, throughout the whole organisation.    The digestive system of the ruminantia is more complicated in structure  than that of any other class of animals; and, owing to this complexity,  and the consequent difficulty of investigating it, its nature and  functions have been less perfectly understood.    The stomach of the Manilla Buffalo, which will serve as an example of  all the other species, is divided into four cavities or ventricles,  which are usually (but improperly) considered as four distinct  stomachs.    The following figure represents the form, relative size, and position of  these four cavities when detached from the animal, and fully inflated.    [Illustration: _a._ First cavity, called the paunch.    _b._ Second ditto, the honeycomb bag.    _c._ Third ditto, the many-plies.    _d._ Fourth ditto, the reed, or rennet.    _e._ A portion of the oesophagus, showing its connection with the  stomach.    _f._ The pylorus, or opening into the intestines.]    The interior of those cavities present some remarkable differences in  point of structure, which, in the present work, can only be alluded to  in a very general manner. For a particular account of the internal  anatomy of these complicated organs, the reader is referred to the  interesting work on 'Cattle,' by W. Youatt.    The paunch is lined with a thick membrane, presenting numerous prominent  and hard papillae. The inner surface of the second cavity is very  artificially divided into angular cells, giving it somewhat the  appearance of honeycomb, whence its name \"honeycomb-bag.\" The lining  membrane of the third cavity forms numerous deep folds, lying upon each  other like the leaves of a book, and beset with small hard tubercles.  These folds vary in breadth in a regular alternate order, a narrow fold  being placed between each of the broader ones. The fourth cavity is  lined with a velvety mucous membrane disposed in longitudinal folds. It  is this part of the stomach that furnishes the gastric juice, and,  consequently, it is in this cavity "]]]
