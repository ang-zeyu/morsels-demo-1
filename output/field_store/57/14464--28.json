[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/30775"],[0,"Elements of Chemistry, (#2)"],[1,"the Memoir which I read at the public meeting of the  Academy of Sciences in the month of April 1787, on the necessity of  reforming and completing the Nomenclature of Chemistry. While engaged in  this employment, I perceived, better than I had ever done before, the  justice of the following maxims of the Abbe de Condillac, in his System  of Logic, and some other of his works.    \"We think only through the medium of words.--Languages are true  analytical methods.--Algebra, which is adapted to its purpose in every  species of expression, in the most simple, most exact, and best manner  possible, is at the same time a language and an analytical method.--The  art of reasoning is nothing more than a language well arranged.\"    Thus, while I thought myself employed only in forming a Nomenclature,  and while I proposed to myself nothing more than to improve the chemical  language, my work transformed itself by degrees, without my being able  to prevent it, into a treatise upon the Elements of Chemistry.    The impossibility of separating the nomenclature of a science from the  science itself, is owing to this, that every branch of physical science  must consist of three things; the series of facts which are the objects  of the science, the ideas which represent these facts, and the words by  which these ideas are expressed. Like three impressions of the same  seal, the word ought to produce the idea, and the idea to be a picture  of the fact. And, as ideas are preserved and communicated by means of  words, it necessarily follows that we cannot improve the language of  any science without at the same time improving the science itself;  neither can we, on the other hand, improve a science, without improving  the language or nomenclature which belongs to it. However certain the  facts of any science may be, and, however just the ideas we may have  formed of these facts, we can only communicate false impressions to  others, while we want words by which these may be properly expressed.    To those who will consider it with attention, the first part of this  treatise will afford frequent proofs of the truth of the above  observations. But as, in the conduct of my work, I have been obliged to  observe an order of arrangement essentially differing from what has been  adopted in any other chemical work yet published, it is proper that I  should explain the motives which have led me to do so.    It is a maxim universally admitted in geometry, and indeed in every  branch of knowledge, that, in the progress of investigation, we should  proceed from known facts to what is unknown. In early infancy, our ideas  spring from our wants; the sensation of want excites the idea of the  object by which it is to be gratified. In this manner, from a series of  sensations, observations, and analyses, a successive train of ideas  arises, so linked together, that an attentive observer may trace back to  a certain point the order and connection of the whole sum of human  knowledge.    When we begin the study of any science, we are in a situation,  respecting that science, similar to that of children; and the course by  which we have to advance is precisely the same which Nature follows in  the formation of their ideas. In a child, the idea is merely an effect  produced by a sensation; and, in the same manner, in commencing the  study of a physical science, we ought to form no idea but what is a  necessary consequence, and immediate effect, of an experiment or  observation. Besides, he that enters upon the career of science, is in a  less advantageous situation than a child who is acquiring his first  ideas. To the child, Nature gives various means of rectifying any  mistakes he may commit respecting the salutary or hurtful qualities of  the objects which surround him. On every occasion his judgments are  corrected by experience; want and pain are the necessary consequences  arising from false judgment; gratification and pleasure are produced by  judging aright. Under such masters, we cannot fail to become well  informed; and we soon learn to reason justly, when want and pain are the  necessary consequences of a contrary conduct.    In the study and practice of the sciences it is quite different; the  false judgments we form neither affect our existence nor our welfare;  and we are not forced by any physical necessity to correct them.  Imagination, on the contrary, which is ever wandering beyond the bounds  of truth, joined to self-love and that self-confidence we are so apt to  indulge, prompt us to draw conclusions which are not immediately derived  from facts; so that we become in some measure interested in deceiving  ourselves. Hence it is by no means to be wondered, that, in the science  of physics in general, men have often made suppositions, instead of  forming conclusions. These suppositions, handed down from one age to  another, acquire additional weight from the authorities by which they  are supported, till at last they are received, even by men of genius, as  fundamental truths.    The only method of preventing such errors from taking place, and of  correcting them when formed, is to restrain and simplify our reasoning  as much as possible. This depends entirely upon ourselves, and the  neglect of it is the only source of our mistakes. We must trust to  nothing but facts: These are presented to us by Nature, and cannot  deceive. We ought, in every instance, to submit our reasoning to the  test of experiment, and never to search for truth but by the natural  road of experiment and observation. Thus mathematicians obtain the  solution of a problem by the mere arrangement of data, and by reducing  their reasoning to such simple steps, to conclusions so very obvious, as  never to lose sight of the evidence which guides them.    Thoroughly convinced of these truths, I have imposed upon myself, as a  law, never to advance but from what is known to what is unknown; never  to form any conclusion which is not an immediate consequence necessarily  flowing from observation and experiment; and always to arrange the  facts, and the conclusions which are drawn from them, in such an order  as shall render it most easy for beginners in the study of chemistry  thoroughly to understand them. Hence I have been obliged to depart from  the usual order of courses of lectures and of treatises upon chemistry,  which always assume the first principles of the science, as known, when  the pupil or the reader should never be supposed to know them till they  have been explained in subsequent lessons. In almost every instance,  these begin by treating of the elements of matter, and by explaining the  table of affinities, without considering, that, in so doing, they must  bring the principal phenomena of chemistry into view at the very outset:  They make use of terms which have not been defined, and suppose the  science to be understood by the very persons they are only beginning to  teach. It ought likewise to be considered, that very little of chemistry  can be learned in a first course, which is hardly sufficient to make the  language of the science familiar to the ears, or the apparatus familiar  to the eyes. It is almost impossible to become a chemist in less than  three or four years of constant application.    These inconveniencies are occasioned not so much by the nature of the  subject, as by the method of teaching it; and, to avoid them, I was  chiefly induced to adopt a new arrangement of chemistry, which appeared  to me more consonant to the order of Nature. I acknowledge, however,  that in thus endeavouring to avoid difficulties of one kind, I have  found myself involved in others of a different species, some of which I  have not been able to remove; but I am persuaded, that such as remain do  not arise from the nature of the order I have adopted, but are rather  consequences of the imperfection under which chemistry still labours.  This science still has many chasms, which interrupt the series of facts,  and often render it extremely difficult to reconcile them with each  other: It has not, like the elements of geometry, the advantage of being  a complete science, the parts of which are all closely connected  together: Its actual progress, however, is so rapid, and the facts,  under the modern doctrine, have assumed so happy an arrangement, that we  have ground to hope, even in our own times, to see it approach near to  the highest state of perfection of which it is susceptible.    The rigorous law from which I have never deviated, of forming no  conclusions which are not fully warranted by experiment, and of never  supplying the absence of facts, has prevented me from comprehending in  this work the branch of chemistry which treats of affinities, although  it is perhaps the best calculated of any part of chemistry for being  reduced into a completely systematic body. Messrs Geoffroy, Gellert,  Bergman, Scheele, De Morveau, Kirwan, and many others, have collected a  number of particular facts upon this subject, which only wait for a  proper arrangement; but the principal data are still wanting, or, at  least, those we have are either not sufficiently defined, or not  sufficiently proved, to become the foundation upon which to build so  very important a branch of chemistry. This science of affinities, or  elective attractions, holds the same place with regard to the other  branches of chemistry, as the higher or transcendental geometry does  with respect to the simpler and elementary part; and I thought it  improper to involve those simple and plain elements, which I flatter  myself the greatest part of my readers will easily understand, in the  obscurities and difficulties which still attend that other very useful  and necessary branch of chemical science.    Perhaps a sentiment of self-love may, without my perceiving it, have  given additional force to these reflections. Mr de Morveau is at  present engaged in publishing the article"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/308"],[0,"Three Men in a Boat (To Say Nothing of the Dog) (#2)"],[1,"time being.  I have known one clump on the head have  more effect upon my liver, and make me feel more anxious to go straight  away then and there, and do what was wanted to be done, without further  loss of time, than a whole box of pills does now.    You know, it often is so--those simple, old-fashioned remedies are  sometimes more efficacious than all the dispensary stuff.    We sat there for half-an-hour, describing to each other our maladies.  I  explained to George and William Harris how I felt when I got up in the  morning, and William Harris told us how he felt when he went to bed; and  George stood on the hearth-rug, and gave us a clever and powerful piece  of acting, illustrative of how he felt in the night.    George _fancies_ he is ill; but there's never anything really the matter  with him, you know.    At this point, Mrs. Poppets knocked at the door to know if we were ready  for supper.  We smiled sadly at one another, and said we supposed we had  better try to swallow a bit.  Harris said a little something in one's  stomach often kept the disease in check; and Mrs. Poppets brought the  tray in, and we drew up to the table, and toyed with a little steak and  onions, and some rhubarb tart.    I must have been very weak at the time; because I know, after the first  half-hour or so, I seemed to take no interest whatever in my food--an  unusual thing for me--and I didn't want any cheese.    This duty done, we refilled our glasses, lit our pipes, and resumed the  discussion upon our state of health.  What it was that was actually the  matter with us, we none of us could be sure of; but the unanimous opinion  was that it--whatever it was--had been brought on by overwork.    \"What we want is rest,\" said Harris.    \"Rest and a complete change,\" said George.  \"The overstrain upon our  brains has produced a general depression throughout the system.  Change  of scene, and absence of the necessity for thought, will restore the  mental equilibrium.\"    George has a cousin, who is usually described in the charge-sheet as a  medical student, so that he naturally has a somewhat family-physicianary  way of putting things.    I agreed with George, and suggested that we should seek out some retired  and old-world spot, far from the madding crowd, and dream away a sunny  week among its drowsy lanes--some half-forgotten nook, hidden away by the  fairies, out of reach of the noisy world--some quaint-perched eyrie on  the cliffs of Time, from whence the surging waves of the nineteenth  century would sound far-off and faint.    Harris said he thought it would be humpy.  He said he knew the sort of  place I meant; where everybody went to bed at eight o'clock, and you  couldn't get a _Referee_ for love or money, and had to walk ten miles to  get your baccy.    \"No,\" said Harris, \"if you want rest and change, you can't beat a sea  trip.\"    I objected to the sea trip strongly.  A sea trip does you good when you  are going to have a couple of months of it, but, for a week, it is  wicked.    You start on Monday with the idea implanted in your bosom that you are  going to enjoy yourself.  You wave an airy adieu to the boys on shore,  light your biggest pipe, and swagger about the deck as if you were  Captain Cook, Sir Francis Drake, and Christopher Columbus all rolled into  one.  On Tuesday, you wish you hadn't come.  On Wednesday, Thursday, and  Friday, you wish you were dead.  On Saturday, you are able to swallow a  little beef tea, and to sit up on deck, and answer with a wan, sweet  smile when kind-hearted people ask you how you feel now.  On Sunday, you  begin to walk about again, and take solid food.  And on Monday morning,  as, with your bag and umbrella in your hand, you stand by the gunwale,  waiting to step ashore, you begin to thoroughly like it.    I remember my brother-in-law going for a short sea trip once, for the  benefit of his health.  He took a return berth from London to Liverpool;  and when he got to Liverpool, the only thing he was anxious about was to  sell that return ticket.    It was offered round the town at a tremendous reduction, so I am told;  and was eventually sold for eighteenpence to a bilious-looking youth who  had just been advised by his medical men to go to the sea-side, and take  exercise.    \"Sea-side!\" said my brother-in-law, pressing the ticket affectionately  into his hand; \"why, you'll have enough to last you a lifetime; and as  for exercise! why, you'll get more exercise, sitting down on that ship,  than you would turning somersaults on dry land.\"    He himself--my brother-in-law--came back by train.  He said the  North-Western Railway was healthy enough for him.    Another fellow I knew went for a week's voyage round the coast, and,  before they started, the steward came to him to ask whether he would pay  for each meal as he had it, or arrange beforehand for the whole series.    The steward recommended the latter course, as it would come so much  cheaper.  He said they would do him for the whole week at two pounds  five.  He said for breakfast there would be fish, followed by a grill.  Lunch was at one, and consisted of four courses.  Dinner at six--soup,  fish, entree, joint, poultry, salad, sweets, cheese, and dessert.  And a  light meat supper at ten.    My friend thought he would close on the two-pound-five job (he is a  hearty eater), and did so.    Lunch came just as they were off Sheerness.  He didn't feel so hungry as  he thought he should, and so contented himself with a bit of boiled beef,  and some strawberries and cream.  He pondered a good deal during the  afternoon, and at one time it seemed to him that he had been eating  nothing but boiled beef for weeks, and at other times it seemed that he  must have been living on strawberries and cream for years.    Neither the beef nor the strawberries and cream seemed happy,  either--seemed discontented like.    At six, they came and told him dinner was ready.  The announcement  aroused no enthusiasm within him, but he felt that there was some of that  two-pound-five to be worked off, and he held on to ropes and things and  went down.  A pleasant odour of onions and hot ham, mingled with fried  fish and greens, greeted him at the bottom of the ladder; and then the  steward came up with an oily smile, and said:    \"What can I get you, sir?\"    [Picture: Man feeling ill] \"Get me out of this,\" was the feeble reply.    And they ran him up quick, and propped him up, over to leeward, and left  him.    For the next four days he lived a simple and blameless life on thin  captain's biscuits (I mean that the biscuits were thin, not the captain)  and soda-water; but, towards Saturday, he got uppish, and went in for  weak tea and dry toast, and on Monday he was gorging himself on chicken  broth.  He left the ship on Tuesday, and as it steamed away from the  landing-stage he gazed after it regretfully.    \"There she goes,\" he said, \"there she goes, with two pounds' worth of  food on board that belongs to me, and that I haven't had.\"    He said that if they had given him another day he thought he could have  put it straight.    So I set my face against the sea trip.  Not, as I explained, upon my own  account.  I was never queer.  But I was afraid for George.  George said  he should be all right, and would rather like it, but he would advise  Harris and me not to think of it, as he felt sure we should both be ill.  Harris said that, to himself, it was always a mystery how people managed  to get sick at sea--said he thought people must do it on purpose, from  affectation--said he had often wished to be, but had never been able.    Then he told us anecdotes of how he had gone across the Channel when it  was so rough that the passengers had to be tied into their berths, and he  and the captain were the only two living souls on board who were not ill.  Sometimes it was he and the second mate who were not ill; but it was  generally he and one other man.  If not he and another man, then it was  he by himself.    It is a curious fact, but nobody ever is sea-sick--on land.  At sea, you  come across plenty of people very bad indeed, whole boat-loads of them;  but I never met a man yet, on land, who had ever known at all what it was  to be sea-sick.  Where the thousands upon thousands of bad sailors that  swarm in every ship hide themselves when they are on land is a mystery.    If most men were like a fellow I saw on the Yarmouth boat one day, I  could account for the seeming enigma easily enough.  It was just off  Southend Pier, I recollect, and he was leaning out through one of the  port-holes in a very dangerous position.  I went up to him to try and  save him.    \"Hi! come further in,\" I said, shaking him by the shoulder.  \"You'll be  overboard.\"    \"Oh my! I wish I was,\" was the only answer I could get; and there I had  to leave him.    Three weeks afterwards, I met him in the coffee-room of a Bath hotel,  talking about his voyages, and explaining, with enthusiasm, how he loved  the sea.    \"Good sailor!\" he replied in answer to a mild young man's envious query;  \"well, I did feel a little queer _once_, I confess.  It was off Cape  Horn.  The vessel was wrecked the next morning.\"    I said:    \"Weren't you a little shaky by Southend Pier one day, and wanted to be  thrown overboard?\"    \"Southend Pier!\" he replied, with a puzzled expression.    \"Yes; going down to Yarmouth, last Friday three weeks.\"    \"Oh, ah--yes,\" he answered, brightening up; \"I remember now.  I did have  a headache that afternoon.  It was the pickles, you know.  They were the  most disgraceful pickles I ever tasted in a respectable boat.  Did _you_  have any?\"    For myself, I have discovered an excellent preventive against  sea-sickness, in balancing myself.  You stand in the centre of the deck,  and, as the ship heaves and pitches, you move your body about, so as to  keep it always straight.  When the front of the ship rises, you lean  forward, till the deck almost"]]]
