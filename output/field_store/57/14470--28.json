From near-topotypes of _C. g. inclarus_ from the Sierra       Nevada de Colima, _C. g. atratus_ differs in: Body slightly       smaller; hind foot smaller (averaging 42 compared with 49);       color of upper parts near the same, underparts paler; skull       smaller, narrower, weaker in construction; zygomatic breadth       less; nasals relatively longer, but actually shorter       (averaging 19.7 compared with 20.3); upper incisors       projecting anteriorly rather than being recurved; maxillary       teeth smaller.         _Measurements._--The type and an adult female (its       measurements in parentheses) yield measurements as follows:       Total length, 300 (299); length of tail, 78 (83); length of       hind foot, 43 (40); occipitonasal length of skull, 56.3       (55.5); basilar length, 49.3 (47.8); zygomatic breadth, 37.9       (36.5); interorbital breadth, 8.7 (8.1); greatest height of       cranium, as explained above, 21.6 (20.7); least depth of       rostrum, 9.2 (8.8); breadth of rostrum, 12.8 (12.7); length       of nasals, 19.4 (20.0); width across mastoid processes of       squamosal, 38.2 (37.1); height of occiput, 16.9 (17.3);       length of maxillary tooth-row, 11.9 (11.3).         _Remarks._--_Cratogeomys gymnurus atratus_ is the smallest       subspecies known for the species, and is so distinct from       other described subspecies, that it is difficult to select       one as the closest relative. In color, _C. g. atratus_       closely resembles _C. g. inclarus_, which occurs at       comparable elevations in the Sierra Nevada, but the skulls       are unlike. Among named subspecies of _C. gymnurus_, the       skull of _tellus_ most closely resembles that of _atratus_,       and, although they differ greatly in size, _C. g. tellus_       seems to be the closest relative of _C. g. atratus_.         This newly described subspecies is known only from Cerro       Viejo and is probably restricted to the higher elevations on       this mountain.         _Specimens examined._--Seven, Top of Cerro Viejo de Cuyutlan,       19 mi.

The       skulls of females are especially small and delicate in       structure; the males are larger with more massive skulls.       _C. z. zodius_ is known to occur in the foot hills north of       the Cerro Viejo, the mountain from which _C. g. atratus_ was       described above.         _Specimens examined._--Seven, 13 mi.

Alcorn, original No. 10889.         _Range._--Known only from the type locality in central       Jalisco.         _Diagnosis._--Size large (see measurements); tail short;       hind foot large; upper parts Fuscous-Black, strongly mixed       with Walnut Brown, underparts Cinnamon-Buff, bases of all       hairs Plumbeous; skull large, broad, rugose; outline of       dorsal profile slightly concave, almost flat; zygomata       strongly constructed, maxillary arm almost touching       squamosal arm over jugal; wide across zygomata; nasals       actually and relatively long; rostrum relatively narrow;       auditory bullae inflated, relatively large; maxillary teeth       relatively large.         _Comparisons._--From topotypes of _C. z. zinseri_ from       Lagos, Jalisco, _C. z. morulus_ differs in: Tail shorter       (averaging 96 in females compared with 101, 94 in males       compared with 115); color darker above, Fuscous-Black       instead of Cinnamon-Rufous, underparts paler; skull larger       (occipitonasal length 63.7 rather than averaging 58.5 in       females and 68.6 rather than 63.1 in males); wide across       zygomata; nasals actually and relatively longer; rostrum       relatively narrower; wider across mastoid processes of       squamosal; auditory bullae inflated, relatively larger;       maxillary teeth larger.         From _C. z. zodius_, that occurs to the northeast, _C. z.       morulus_ differs in: Body larger (see measurements); hind       foot larger; color of upper parts darker, underparts paler;       skull much larger, broader, more rugose; dorsal profile of       skull slightly concave rather than convex; wider across       zygomata; nasals actually and relatively longer; rostrum       broader, more massive; wider across mastoid processes of       squamosal; auditory bullae larger; maxillary teeth larger.         _Measurements._--The type and an adult female (her       measurements in parentheses) from the type locality measure:       Total length, 358 (338); length of tail, 94 (97); length of       hind foot, 49 (45); occipitonasal length of skull, 68.6       (63.7); basilar length, 58.0 (55.6); zygomatic breadth, 49.3       (45.0); interorbital breadth, 9.6 (8.9); greatest height of       cranium, as explained above, 26.1 (24.6); least depth of       rostrum, 12.5 (10.8); breadth of rostrum, 14.5 (13.7);       length of nasals, 25.9 (22.5); width across mastoid       processes of squamosal, 47.7 (42.8); height of occiput, 19.8       (17.8); length of maxillary tooth-row, 13.9 (13.8).         _Remarks._--_Cratogeomys zinseri morulus_ is the darkest       subspecies known of _C. zinseri_. It differs widely from       other subspecies of this species in color and the large size       of the skull.         _Cratogeomys zinseri_ occurs over the same general area as       _C. gymnurus_ in central Jalisco, although these two species       seemingly do not share the same local habitat. _C. zinseri_       differs from _C. gymnurus_ as follows: Tail relatively       longer; skull wider across zygomatic arches than across       mastoid processes of squamosal (reverse true in _C.       gymnurus_); zygomata strongly bowed outward anteriorly;       maxillary arm of zygomata almost touching squamosal arm       (instead of widely separated from each other) above jugal;       rostrum relatively narrower, less massive; border of nasals       parallel or laterally swollen instead of gradually tapering.         _Specimens examined._--Four, N end of Lago Sayula, 9 mi.

To the       moralist, the student, the physiologist, they are subjects       deserving of careful scrutiny and thoughtful observation; while       to those whose highest motive is the gratification of       curiosity, but especially to children, they must be objects of       vivid interest.\"          A DAY AT CHATSWORTH.    THE PRISON OF MARY, QUEEN OF SCOTS, AND PALACE OF THE DUKES OF  DEVONSHIRE.    [Illustration: THE ENTRANCE GATES.]      Among the most magnificent of the palatial homes of England--indeed one  of the most rich and splendid residences occupied in all the world by an  uncrowned master--is Chatsworth, in Derbyshire, the most beautiful  district in the British islands. With some abridgment we transfer to the  _International_ an account of a recent visit to Chatsworth, by Mrs. S.  C. HALL, with the illustrations by Mr. FINHALT, from the January number  of the London _Art-Journal_. Our agreeable authoress, after some general  observations respecting the attractions of the neighborhood, proceeds:         \"We are so little proud of the beauties of England, that the       foreigner only hears of Derbyshire as the casket which contains       the rich jewel of CHATSWORTH. The setting is worthy of the gem.       It ranks foremost among proudly beautiful English mansions; and       merits its familiar title of the Palace of the Peak. It was the       object of our pilgrimage; and we recalled the history of the       nobles of its House. The family of Cavendish is one of our       oldest descents; it may be traced lineally from Robert de       Gernon, who entered England with the Conqueror, and whose       descendant, Roger Gernon, of Grimston, in Suffolk, marrying the       daughter and sole heiress of Lord Cavendish in that county, in       the reign of Edward II., gave the name of that estate as a       surname to his children, which they ever after bore. The study       of the law seems to have been for a long period the means of       according position and celebrity to the family, Sir William       Cavendish, in whose person all the estates conjoined, was Privy       Councillor to Henry VIII., Edward VI., and Mary; he had been       Gentleman-Usher to Wolsey; and after the fall of the great       Cardinal, was retained in the service of Henry VIII. He       accumulated much wealth, but chiefly by his third marriage,       with Elizabeth, the wealthy widow of Robert Barley, at whose       instigation he sold his estates in other parts of England, to       purchase lands in Derbyshire, where her great property lay.       Hardwick Hall was her paternal residence, but Sir William began       to build another at Chatsworth, which he did not live to       finish. Ultimately, Elizabeth became the wife of George Talbot,       Earl of Shrewsbury; she was one of the most remarkable women of       her time, and the foundress of the two houses of Devonshire and       Newcastle. Her second son, William, by the death of his elder       brother in 1616, after being created Baron Cavendish, of       Hardwick, was in 1618 created Earl of Devonshire. It was       happily said of him, 'his learning operated on his conduct, but       was seldom shown in his discourse.' His son, the third Earl,       was a zealous loyalist; like his father, remarkable for his       cultivated taste and learning, perfected under the       superintendence of the famous Hobbes of Malmesbury. His eldest       son, William, was the first Duke of Devonshire; the friend of       Lord Russell, and one of the few who fearlessly testified to       his honor on his memorable trial. Wearied of courts, he retired       to Chatsworth, which at that time was a quadrangular building,       with turrets in the Elizabethan taste; and then, 'as if his       mind rose upon the depression of his fortune,' says Kennett,       'he first projected the now glorious pile of Chatsworth;' he       pulled down the south side of 'that good old seat,' and rebuilt       it on a plan 'so fair an august, that it looked like a model       only of what might be done in after ages.' After seven years,       he added the other sides, 'yet the building was his least       charge, if regard be had to his gardens, water-works, statues,       pictures, and other the finest pieces of Art and Nature that       could be obtained abroad or at home.' He was highly honored       with the favor and confidence of William III. and his successor       Anne. Dying in 1707, his son William, who was Lord Lieutenant       of Ireland, spent the latter part of his life at Chatsworth,       dying there in 1755. It is now the favorite country residence       of his great grandson, the sixth Duke and ninth Earl of       Devonshire.         \"The Duke's tastes, as evinced at Chatsworth, are of the purest       and happiest order;--and are to be found in the adornments of       his rooms, the shelves of his library, the riches of his       galleries of art, and the rare and beautiful exotic marvels of       his gardens and conservatories. Charles Cotton, in his poem,       the _Wonders of the Peak_, wrote, two centuries ago, of the       then Earl of Devonshire--and no language can apply with       greater truth to the Duke who is now master of Chatsworth:             \"But that which crowns all this, and does impart           A lustre far beyond the pow'r of Art,           Is the great Owner; He, whose noble mind           For such a Fortune only was design'd.           Whose bounties, as the Ocean's bosom wide,           Flow in a constant, unexhausted tide           Of Hospitality, and free access,           Liberal Condescension, cheerfulness,           Honor and Truth, as ev'ry of them strove           At once to captivate Respect and Love:           And with such order all perform'd, and grace,          As rivet wonder to the stately place.\"    [Illustration: THE EMPEROR FOUNTAIN.]         \"Although carriages are permitted to drive from the railway       terminus at Rowsley, to the pretty and pleasant inn at Edenson,       by a road which passes directly under the house, the stranger       should receive his first impressions of Chatsworth from one of       the surrounding heights. It is impossible to convey a just idea       of its breadth and dignity; the platform upon which it stands       is a fitting base for such a structure; the trees, that at       intervals relieve and enliven the vast space, are of every rich       variety, the terraces nearly twelve hundred feet in       extent--'the emperor fountain' throwing its jet two hundred and       seventy feet into the air, far overtopping the avenue of       majestic trees, of which it forms the centre. The dancing       fountain, the great cascade, even the smaller fountains       (wonderful objects any where, except here, where there are so       many more wonderful) sparkle through the foliage; while all is       backed by magnificent hanging woods, and the high lands of       Derbyshire, extending from the hills of Matlock to Stony       Middleton. And the foreground of the picture is, in its way,       equally beautiful; the expansive view, the meadows now broken       into green hills and mimic valleys, the groups of fallow deer,       and herds of cattle, reposing beneath the shade of       wide-spreading chestnuts, or the stately beech--all is harmony       to perfection; nothing is wanting to complete the fascination       of the whole. The enlarged and cultivated minds which conceived       these vast yet minute arrangements, did not consider minor       details as unimportant; every tree, and brake, and bush; every       ornament, every path, is exactly in its right place, and seems       to have ever been there. Nothing, however great, or however       small, has escaped consideration; there are no bewildering       effects, such as are frequently seen in large domains, and       which render it difficult to recall what at the time may have       been much admired; all is arranged with the dignity of order;       all, however graceful, is substantial; the ornaments sometimes       elaborate, never descend into prettiness; the character of the       scenery has been borne in mind, and its beauty never outraged       by extravagance. All is in harmony with the character which       nature in her most generous mood gave to the hills and valleys;       God has been gracious to the land, and man has followed in the       pathway He has made.    [Illustration: THE TEMPLE CASCADE.]    [Illustration: THE WELLINGTON ROCK AND CASCADE.]         \"A month at Chatsworth would hardly suffice to count its       beauties; but much may be done in a day, when eyes and ears are       open, and the heart beats in sympathy with the beauties of       Nature and of Art. It is, perhaps, best to visit the gardens of       Chatsworth first; they are little more than half a mile to the       north of the park; and there Sir Joseph Paxton is building his       new dwelling, or rather adding considerably to the beauty and       convenience of the old. In the Kitchen-Gardens, containing       twelve acres, there are houses for every species of plant, but       the grand attraction is the house which contains the Royal Lily       (Victoria Regia), and other lilies and water-plants from       various countries. It will be readily believed that the       flower-gardens are among the most exquisitely beautiful in       Europe; they have been arranged by one of the master minds of       the age, and bear evidence of matured knowledge, skill, and       taste; the nicest judgment seems to have been exercised over       even the smallest matter of detail, while the whole is as       perfect a combination as can be conceived of grandeur and       loveliness. The walks, lawns, and parterres are lavishly, but       unobtrusively, decorated with vases and statues; terraces occur       here and there, from which are to be obtained the"]]]
