Let us now try to think his pure  thoughts after him. If there are two sexes created by the Almighty he  must have a pure purpose in creating them. We seldom think how much of  beauty and melody and loveliness is due to sex.    \"It is because of sex that we are gathered in families and enjoy all the  delights of home. It is because of sex that we have ties of kindred,  brothers, sisters, father, mother, uncles, aunts and cousins. Think of  the pleasant home gatherings at Christmas or Thanksgiving, or upon  family birthdays, with all the relatives, old and young, meeting in love  and sympathy; think of the sweet prattle of children in the home; think  of the tender ministrations of mother or sister in times of sorrow or  illness or death, and remember that these are possible because of sex.  Men may build themselves fine club houses where they congregate to smoke  or drink or eat together, but these are not homes. Women may go away by  themselves into a convent and give up the world, but in so doing they  give up the home; for in a real true home there must be parents and  children, and this comes through sex. We may go even farther and say  with Mr. Grant Allen that everything high and ennobling in our nature  springs directly from the fact of sex. He claims that to it 'we owe our  love of color, of graceful forms, of melodious sound, of rhythmical  motion, the evolution of music, of poetry, of romance, of painting, of  sculpture, of decorative art, of dramatic entertainment. From it,' he  says, 'springs the love of beauty, around it all beautiful arts circle  as their centre. Its subtle aroma pervades all literature, and to it we  owe the heart and all that is best within it.'    \"We read of knights of old fighting for 'fayre ladye,' of heroes who  died to save wives and children; we cannot take up a book of poetry  without realizing how love of men and women has been the inspiration of  the poet in all ages. And this is not all that we owe to sex. In all  organic life we find the same force at work. The song of the nightingale  is a call to his mate, the chirp of cricket, the song of the thrush, the  note of the grasshopper, every charming voice in wild nature are notes  of love, and were it not for these, field and forest would be silent.  Among the animals we can trace the beauty of form and of covering to the  same source. And even in the inanimate world of plants and trees we find  sex as the source of life and beauty. The bright tinted flowers are the  homes of the father and mother and babies of the plant and without the  male and female principle in plants there would be no bud or blossom and  no fruit. Remember when you see the beauty of the apple orchard in the  spring and the glowing fruit in the autumn that these are the expression  of sex-life in the tree.\"    \"My!\" exclaimed Carl, \"I never thought of all that before.\"    \"I presume not, and many who are older than you have no thoughts of sex  but those which are low and vile. But when you consider how the same  principle reaches through all nature, and upon it depends so much that  is beautiful and charming you cannot believe that is in itself vile and  unholy, can you? If we are to think God's thoughts after him we must  come to look upon sex as something to be thought of and spoken of only  with reverence, never to be jested about or debased in any way. You  begin to see that more is involved in the coming into manhood than you  had supposed. But we have not gone over the whole matter yet. You have  read the first chapter of Genesis how that God made man in his own  image, and out of the dust of the earth. We do not suppose that he made  him out of dirt and water, as a child makes mud-pies, but we may accept  this as a statement of the scientific fact that in man are found the  same elements as in the earth, such as iron, soda, lime, etc. What we  want to think of now is the statement that God created man by his direct  power. Then we are told he made woman also. These are the first living  human beings of whom we have record. Who is the third?\"    \"Cain.\"    \"And who made Cain?\"    \"God,\" answered Carl glibly, as if that must be the only orthodox  answer.    \"In the same way that he made Adam and Eve?\"    Carl blushed and was silent.    \"You were not embarrassed when I spoke of the creation of Adam and Eve,  you have no reason to be embarrassed when I speak of the creation of  Cain. All was in accordance with the divine will, and must therefore be  right. We cannot say positively that God thought this or that, but we  have a right to judge from his acts what his purposes were. We have a  right to suppose that he created the earth intending to people it with  human beings. Of course every possible plan for doing this was open to  him. He might have created each individual as he did Adam, but what  would have been the result? We should have stood, each one alone, in  selfish solitariness, like a lot of ten-pins, able to knock each other  down but not to help each other up. Each one would have been thinking  only of himself and his own selfish interests. This plan could not  commend itself to a compassionate Creator, and we can imagine that he  would say to himself: 'That would never do. I must put these, my  children, in such relation to each other that they will have love for  each other; that they will be bound by ties so strong that nothing can  break them; they must be created in such a way that they will also  understand their relation to me and love me as their life-giver. To do  this I will share with them my greatest power, that of creation. I will  let them help me people the world. By this creative power they shall  come to understand how I, their heavenly Father, love them, and yearn  over them, and by their dependence as children upon their parents they  shall learn to depend upon and trust me.' From the plan God adopted for  peopling the earth we may suppose this to have been his process of  thought. So you see that sex comes as a wondrous gift from God, a gift  endowed with a marvelous power, and therefore to be held most sacred.  When I spoke of you as being almost a man it was with the thought that  now is being conferred upon you this gift of sex.\"    Carl looked up with some surprise. \"Why, I have always been a boy.\"    \"True. And a boy is a being who will become a man. But he is not endowed  with the functions of sex until he is about fourteen years old. Then sex  begins to make itself felt in his whole being. He grows taller rapidly;  he gains in breadth; he begins to see the long-looked-for mustache; he  notices the growth of the special organs of sex; he begins to feel more  manly; to enjoy the society of girls as never before; and desires to  treat them with more attention. This is a time when, if he is wrongly  taught, he may fall into great wrong-doing and injure himself, and not  that alone, but those who are to come after him. I have not yet told you  of the great responsibilities that come with this gift of sex.\"    Dr. Barrett rose and, bringing a book from the shelves, opened it and  showed Carl an illustration, saying; \"Did you ever see such a picture as  this?\"    [Illustration]    \"What are they?\" asked he. \"They look like pollywogs.\"    \"As much like them as anything. But they are not pollywogs. They have a  bigger sounding name than that. They are called _spermatozoa_, or each  one is a _spermatozoon_. They are so tiny that they are not visible  except with the aid of a microscope, and yet they are alive and very  active. They live and move in a fluid called _semen_, and they are the  living principle contributed by the male to the formation of a new  creature. Each one contains in itself all the particular traits,  characteristics or talents which the father would confer on the child of  which this spermatozoon would form a part. You are like your father in  some things, I suppose.\"    \"Yes, I am like papa in size and in my love for mathematics. He says I  have his quick temper, too.\"    \"That leads me to speak of another fact. You see that you were a part of  your father during his whole life, and you were affected by all that  affected him. You were changed or modified by his habits. If he tried to  curb his quick temper, it has made it easier for you to control  yourself; but if he allowed it full sway, it has made it harder for you.  If he were truthful and honest, it has made it easy for you to be the  same; but if he were wild and dissipated, it would make it easier for  you to yield to the same temptations.\"    \"Was that what he meant when he said he was not surprised that Will Grey  was so bad a boy, for his father was a very wild young man?\"    \"Yes, that was exactly what he meant.\"    \"If that is so why don't fathers tell their boys about it so that they  can behave better when they are young?\"    \"That is just what I think they ought to do, but unfortunately people  have thought they must not talk of these things to young folks for fear  it will make them bad instead of good.\"    \"Well, I guess that would depend upon the way they told it. Now they  don't tell it right, but leave the boys to be told in wrong ways, and  that really does lead them to be bad. No one ever talked to me as you  have to-night, and I am sure it makes me want to be better.\"    [Illustration]    \"That ought to be the effect, and I believe it would be if boys were  only 'told right,' as you say. But I have told you only half the story.  Here is another picture. These are called _ova_. One is an _ovum_, and  these are the principle the mother gives to the future child. They are  greatly magnified. It would take 240 of them lying side by side to make  a row an inch long, so we say they are 1/240 of an inch in  diameter, but tiny as they are, each ovum contains all the traits or  talents that the"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/29070"],[0,"Brighter Britain! (Volume 1 of 2) (#2)"],[1,"away before the revivifying breath of colonial life, yet sometimes \"Mrs.  Grundy's\" awful features will show themselves, hiding the old foolish  face under a new and somewhat strange aspect.    It would be interesting to note how many of the most prominent and  influential citizens of a colony came there originally in the humblest  possible way; and how many of the dregs of colonial society--the  occupiers of the lowest rung on the colonial ladder--reached their new  home with all the pomp and circumstance of quarter-deck sublimity, and  all the humbug and pretension of real or fancied aristocracy. Is the  result we see--for these contrasts are to be found plentifully in all  the colonies at the Antipodes--what it ought to be, or not? That is the  question.    In the colonies, and particularly in the younger and newer among them, a  man must perforce be the sole architect of his own fortunes. Industry  and energy, enterprise and perseverance pave the pathway to success, and  yield a real and lasting benefit to him who holds such endowments. A man  must prove what he _is_, not what he _was_; his antecedents go for but  little, and his \"forbears\" for nothing at all. In the Antipodean  colonies of Great Britain is realized, perhaps, the nearest approach to  true freedom; and, in a wide social sense, the closest approximation to  the ideal republic.    However, we are still on board ship, and, after an easy and not too  eventful voyage of some three months, are looking eagerly out for the  first sight of the promised land. Bound to Auckland, New Zealand, our  vessel is one of the largest that has yet sailed from Gravesend to that  port; and she carries some three hundred emigrants and passengers on  board. We have grown so accustomed to our good ship, and to our life on  board of her, that we have got a strange feeling that this voyaging will  never end; nor does the idea altogether arouse our discontent.    We have had one or two births, and, alas! one poor child has been taken  from our little company. There have, of course, been no weddings on  board, but the prevailing opinion is that several have been arranged to  take place as soon as we get on shore. And the time is very near now.    At last, late one afternoon, as the ship is bowling steadily along with  a ten-knot breeze on the port quarter, the deck is hailed from aloft,  and the cheery, long-expected, and long-wished-for cry of \"land ho!\" is  taken up by a hundred voices, and rings out across the sea. But there is  nothing to be seen for all that; and though more than three hundred  pairs of eyes keep anxious ward and watch, darkness falls before an  almost imperceptible cloud upon the far horizon is pronounced  oracularly by the mate to be Cape Maria Van Diemen, New Zealand's  north-western-most promontory.    One may easily imagine that it is difficult to \"turn in\" on a night when  such a fresh excitement fills every mind, but, I suppose, most of us do  contrive to get to sleep eventually. With the first break of dawn in the  morning there is a stir and commotion all through the ship. Rules are  forgotten, and etiquette broken through, as men, women, and children  rush hastily on deck to take their first look at our future home.    It is a beautiful summer morning. There is only a slight ripple on the  surface of the water, and not a cloud in the blue sky overhead. The  gentle breeze that just keeps us in motion blows off the land, bearing  with it a subtle perfume of trees and flowers and herbage; how  unspeakably grateful to our nostrils none can tell so well as we, who  inhale it with ardour after so many weeks at sea.    Yonder, a mile or two to starboard, and seeming within a stone's throw,  is the land we have come so far to seek. A wall of rock, the northern  cliff of New Zealand rises abrupt and imposing from the sea, broken here  and there into groups of pillared, pinnacled islets, nobly irregular in  outline, piled and scarred, indented and projected, uplifted and  magnificent. On the summit of the cliffs, on ledges and terraces, down  at the bottom of the rocks, filling every little bay, and sweeping down  the gullies and ravines, is everywhere abundant the wild foliage of the  evergreen forest. Glorifying the rich and splendid scene, diversifying  with numberless effects of light and shadow the whole panorama, shining  upon the glowing sea, touching the topmost crags with sparkling  grandeur, and bathing in beauty the thousand-tinted green of the forest,  is the sun, which, on the eastern horizon, is rising clear and bright  and steady. And so we gaze rapturously on the wide and beautiful  picture--a picture the remembrance of which will remain with us long:  our first sight of the new land of hope and promise.    Varied are the emotions that take possession of the individuals of our  company; but I think there are some among us, more thoughtful or  sentimental, perhaps, who, unconsciously to themselves, draw a kind of  inspiration from the noble scene. To such there seems, in those majestic  cliffs, sea-swept and forest-crowned, first seen as lighted by the  rising sun, a nameless sermon preached, a wordless lesson taught, an  everlasting poem sung. And our minds and spirits are calmed, refreshed,  and invigorated; while in some dim way we grasp ideas that the silent  scene irresistibly conveys to us. Rising within us, as we gaze, comes  with fresh new force the knowledge of the qualities that should be ours:  the high-hoping courage, the unshrinking energy, the dauntless  resolution, and the unfailing industry that must animate the colonist,  and be the best endowments of an inceptive nation!    Later in the day we round the North Cape, and go sailing on down the  coast, with light and rather baffling winds that eventually bring us to  port on the following evening.    Among our passengers are several old colonists, who are returning from a  visit \"home.\" In the colonies Great Britain is always spoken of as  \"home,\" even by colonial-born people. Talk about the raptures at  returning to \"my own, my native land!\" that is nothing to the transports  of joy that now infect our colonists. They laugh, they sing, they dance  about the decks, they chatter \"sixteen to the dozen,\" and display every  eccentricity of unbounded delight and satisfaction.    Probably a good deal of this is put on for the edification of us new  chums, but there is no question that most of it is an expression of real  feeling. All through the voyage these good people have been in great  force, relating numberless yarns of their past experiences, more or less  truthful in detail. But now their self-importance is overwhelming and  superior to all considerations. Every headland, bay, or island that we  pass is expatiated upon, and its especial story told, in which, I note,  the narrator generally seems to have been the most prominent figure  himself. No one is allowed to remain below, even for meals, scarcely for  sleeping; he or she must be up on deck to hear strange-sounding names  applied to every place we sight.    Cape Kara-Kara is a name to us and nothing more. Whangaroa Heads, that  guard the harbour of that name, with its settlements and saw-mills, is  but little better, though some few, who have been industriously reading  up, remember Whangaroa as the scene of the ghastly massacre of the crew  of the _Boyd_, half a century ago. Capes Wiwiki and Brett we have no  previous acquaintance with, though we have heard of the Bay of Islands,  over whose wide entrance they are the twin sentinels. And then in slow  succession we sight the Poor Knights Islands, Bream Head, the Hen and  Chickens, the Barrier Islands--Great and Little, Cape Colville, Rodney  Point, and the Kawau, Sir George Grey's island home.    And now, on the afternoon of the second day, we are running closer and  closer to the shore; islands and islets are becoming more numerous, and  the seas are getting narrower. Right ahead a conical mountain top is  perceived, Tiri-Tiri is close to, and it is high time the pilot came  aboard. That mountain top is Rangitoto, an extinct volcanic cone upon a  small island that protects the entrance to Auckland Harbour. Presently  we shall see the similar elevations of Mount Eden and Mount Hobson, that  look down on Auckland from the mainland.    Of course, we are all on the _qui vive_ of expectation, looking out for  the first signs of life. Hitherto we have seen nothing to rob us of the  notion that we are a veritable cargo of Columbuses, coming to colonize  some new and virgin land, until now utterly unknown to the rest of the  world. The shores we have passed along have presented to us every  possible variety of savage wilderness, rocks and bush and scrub and  fern, but no appearance of settlement at all, not even any signs of  aboriginal life have we descried.    There is a growing idea getting the better of our common sense--an  impression that there has been some sort of mistake somewhere or other.  For, how can it be possible that we are just outside the harbour of a  considerable city, with the shores of mainland and island as far as we  can see, just as wild as Nature made them, wilder than anything most of  us have ever seen before. The utmost recesses of Scotland, or Ireland,  or Wales would look quite tame and domesticated contrasted with these  rugged solitudes. Not a house nor a hut anywhere, not a trace of the  presence of man, not even--so it chanced--another sail upon the sea!    It is close upon sunset, the foresail is backed, the pilot's signal is  flying, and the foghorn sounding, and soon we shall see if there is any  life or not in this weird new land. Presently, comes a shout of \"Ship  ahoy! ahoy!\" apparently from the sea, and a little boat emerges from the  shadow of the shore and makes its way alongside.    Of course every one rushes to the side to see the pilot come aboard. It  being more than three months since we saw a strange face, we are  "]]]
