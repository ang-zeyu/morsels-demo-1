I walked around  the farther wing, went up some disjointed steps, and entered the deep  twilight of a narrow and incredibly old box-walk. The walk was just wide  enough for one person to slip through, and its branches met overhead. It  was like the ghost of a box-walk, its lustrous green all turning to  the shadowy greyness of the avenues. I walked on and on, the branches  hitting me in the face and springing back with a dry rattle; and at  length I came out on the grassy top of the _chemin de ronde_. I walked  along it to the gate-tower, looking down into the court, which was just  below me. Not a human being was in sight; and neither were the dogs. I  found a flight of steps in the thickness of the wall and went down them;  and when I emerged again into the court, there stood the circle of dogs,  the golden-brown one a little ahead of the others, the black greyhound  shivering in the rear.    \"Oh, hang it--you uncomfortable beasts, you!\" I exclaimed, my voice  startling me with a sudden echo. The dogs stood motionless, watching me.  I knew by this time that they would not try to prevent my approaching  the house, and the knowledge left me free to examine them. I had a  feeling that they must be horribly cowed to be so silent and inert. Yet  they did not look hungry or ill-treated. Their coats were smooth and  they were not thin, except the shivering greyhound. It was more as if  they had lived a long time with people who never spoke to them or looked  at them: as though the silence of the place had gradually benumbed their  busy inquisitive natures. And this strange passivity, this almost human  lassitude, seemed to me sadder than the misery of starved and beaten  animals. I should have liked to rouse them for a minute, to coax them  into a game or a scamper; but the longer I looked into their fixed and  weary eyes the more preposterous the idea became. With the windows of  that house looking down on us, how could I have imagined such a thing?  The dogs knew better: _they_ knew what the house would tolerate and what  it would not. I even fancied that they knew what was passing through  my mind, and pitied me for my frivolity. But even that feeling probably  reached them through a thick fog of listlessness. I had an idea that  their distance from me was as nothing to my remoteness from them. The  impression they produced was that of having in common one memory so deep  and dark that nothing that had happened since was worth either a growl  or a wag.    \"I say,\" I broke out abruptly, addressing myself to the dumb circle, \"do  you know what you look like, the whole lot of you? You look as if you'd  seen a ghost--that's how you look! I wonder if there _is_ a ghost here,  and nobody but you left for it to appear to?\" The dogs continued to gaze  at me without moving....    *****    It was dark when I saw Lanrivain's motor lamps at the cross-roads--and I  wasn't exactly sorry to see them. I had the sense of having escaped from  the loneliest place in the whole world, and of not liking loneliness--to  that degree--as much as I had imagined I should. My friend had brought  his solicitor back from Quimper for the night, and seated beside a fat  and affable stranger I felt no inclination to talk of Kerfol....    But that evening, when Lanrivain and the solicitor were closeted in the  study, Madame de Lanrivain began to question me in the drawing-room.    \"Well--are you going to buy Kerfol?\" she asked, tilting up her gay chin  from her embroidery.    \"I haven't decided yet. The fact is, I couldn't get into the house,\" I  said, as if I had simply postponed my decision, and meant to go back for  another look.    \"You couldn't get in? Why, what happened? The family are mad to sell the  place, and the old guardian has orders--\"    \"Very likely. But the old guardian wasn't there.\"    \"What a pity! He must have gone to market. But his daughter--?\"    \"There was nobody about. At least I saw no one.\"    \"How extraordinary! Literally nobody?\"    \"Nobody but a lot of dogs--a whole pack of them--who seemed to have the  place to themselves.\"    Madame de Lanrivain let the embroidery slip to her knee and folded her  hands on it. For several minutes she looked at me thoughtfully.    \"A pack of dogs--you _saw_ them?\"    \"Saw them? I saw nothing else!\"    \"How many?\" She dropped her voice a little. \"I've always wondered--\"    I looked at her with surprise: I had supposed the place to be familiar  to her. \"Have you never been to Kerfol?\" I asked.    \"Oh, yes: often. But never on that day.\"    \"What day?\"    \"I'd quite forgotten--and so had Herve, I'm sure. If we'd remembered, we  never should have sent you to-day--but then, after all, one doesn't half  believe that sort of thing, does one?\"    \"What sort of thing?\" I asked, involuntarily sinking my voice to  the level of hers. Inwardly I was thinking: \"I _knew_ there was  something....\"    Madame de Lanrivain cleared her throat and produced a reassuring smile.  \"Didn't Herve tell you the story of Kerfol? An ancestor of his was mixed  up in it. You know every Breton house has its ghost-story; and some of  them are rather unpleasant.\"    \"Yes--but those dogs?\"    \"Well, those dogs are the ghosts of Kerfol. At least, the peasants say  there's one day in the year when a lot of dogs appear there; and that  day the keeper and his daughter go off to Morlaix and get drunk. The  women in Brittany drink dreadfully.\" She stooped to match a silk; then  she lifted her charming inquisitive Parisian face. \"Did you _really_ see  a lot of dogs? There isn't one at Kerfol.\" she said.          II    Lanrivain, the next day, hunted out a shabby calf volume from the back  of an upper shelf of his library.    \"Yes--here it is. What does it call itself? _A History of the Assizes  of the Duchy of Brittany. Quimper, 1702_. The book was written about a  hundred years later than the Kerfol affair; but I believe the account  is transcribed pretty literally from the judicial records. Anyhow, it's  queer reading. And there's a Herve de Lanrivain mixed up in it--not  exactly _my_ style, as you'll see. But then he's only a collateral.  Here, take the book up to bed with you. I don't exactly remember the  details; but after you've read it I'll bet anything you'll leave your  light burning all night!\"    I left my light burning all night, as he had predicted; but it was  chiefly because, till near dawn, I was absorbed in my reading. The  account of the trial of Anne de Cornault, wife of the lord of Kerfol,  was long and closely printed. It was, as my friend had said, probably an  almost literal transcription of what took place in the court-room; and  the trial lasted nearly a month. Besides, the type of the book was very  bad....    At first I thought of translating the old record. But it is full of  wearisome repetitions, and the main lines of the story are forever  straying off into side issues. So I have tried to disentangle it, and  give it here in a simpler form. At times, however, I have reverted to  the text because no other words could have conveyed so exactly the sense  of what I felt at Kerfol; and nowhere have I added anything of my own.          III    It was in the year 16-- that Yves de Cornault, lord of the domain  of Kerfol, went to the _pardon_ of Locronan to perform his religious  duties. He was a rich and powerful noble, then in his sixty-second year,  but hale and sturdy, a great horseman and hunter and a pious man. So all  his neighbours attested. In appearance he was short and broad, with a  swarthy face, legs slightly bowed from the saddle, a hanging nose and  broad hands with black hairs on them. He had married young and lost his  wife and son soon after, and since then had lived alone at Kerfol. Twice  a year he went to Morlaix, where he had a handsome house by the river,  and spent a week or ten days there; and occasionally he rode to Rennes  on business. Witnesses were found to declare that during these absences  he led a life different from the one he was known to lead at Kerfol,  where he busied himself with his estate, attended mass daily, and found  his only amusement in hunting the wild boar and water-fowl. But these  rumours are not particularly relevant, and it is certain that among  people of his own class in the neighbourhood he passed for a stern and  even austere man, observant of his religious obligations, and keeping  strictly to himself. There was no talk of any familiarity with the women  on his estate, though at that time the nobility were very free with  their peasants. Some people said he had never looked at a woman since  his wife's death; but such things are hard to prove, and the evidence on  this point was not worth much.    Well, in his sixty-second year, Yves de Cornault went to the _pardon_ at  Locronan, and saw there a young lady of Douarnenez, who had ridden over  pillion behind her father to do her duty to the saint. Her name was Anne  de Barrigan, and she came of good old Breton stock, but much less  great and powerful than that of Yves de Cornault; and her father had  squandered his fortune at cards, and lived almost like a peasant in his  little granite manor on the moors.... I have said I would add nothing  of my own to this bald statement of a strange case; but I must interrupt  myself here to describe the young lady who rode up to the lych-gate  of Locronan at the very moment when the Baron de Cornault was also  dismounting there. I take my description from a faded drawing in red  crayon, sober and truthful enough to be by a late pupil of the Clouets,  which hangs in Lanrivain's study, and is said to be a portrait of Anne  de Barrigan. It is unsigned and has no mark of identity but the initials  A. B., and the date 16--, the year after her marriage. It represents a  young woman with a small oval face, almost pointed, yet wide enough for  a full mouth with a tender depression at the corners.

Take a loaf of bread, cut off the crusts, dig out the centre, making a  box of it, brush it all over with melted butter and put into the oven to  brown. Fill with creamed oysters, cover the top with fried bread crumbs,  put into the oven for a minute and serve. Garnish with parsley.      2.--Broiled Sweetbreads.    For these use veal sweetbreads.

Turn into an omelet pan, in which two  tablespoonfuls of butter have been melted. Spread evenly in the pan and  let cook until \"set\" on the bottom, then put into the oven. When a knife  cut down into the omelet comes out clean, score across the top at right  angles to the handle of the pan. Fold and turn onto a heated  dish.--Janet M. Hill, in \"Boston Cooking School Magazine.\"      6.--Liver Rolls.    Have 1/2 a lb. of calf's liver cut in thin slices, parboil for 5  minutes, wipe each piece dry, lay a thin slice of bacon on each slice of  liver, season with salt and pepper, roll up and fasten with a wooden  toothpick, dredge with flour and fry until done in bacon fat or  drippings. When done take out the rolls and thicken the gravy with a  little brown flour. If there is not gravy enough add a little boiling  water. A teaspoonful of mushroom catsup added to the gravy is an  improvement or a squeeze of onion juice.      7.--A Box of Chestnuts.    Shell 1 qt. of chestnuts and cover with boiling water; leave them for  fifteen minutes, then rub off the brown skins. Put them into a  saucepan, cover them with soup stock and let them boil 1/2 an hour; when  done, drain. Save the stock. Into a frying pan put 1 tablespoonful of  butter and when melted add 1 of flour; cook until browned, then add the  stock and stir until it boils; add salt and pepper to taste. Lay the  chestnuts in a box made of fried bread and pour the sauce over.    To make the box, take a loaf of bread, cut off the crust and leave the  sides as smooth as possible. Cut out the centre, leaving a box shaped  piece. Fry this in deep fat.      8.--Curried Hare.    Clean and cut the hare or rabbit as for fricassee.

When you have shad for dinner scald the roes ten minutes in boiling  water (salted), drain, throw into cold water, leave them there three  minutes, wipe dry, and set in a cold place until you wish to use them.  Cut them across into pieces an inch or more wide, roll them in flour,  and fry to a fine brown. Scramble a dish of eggs, pile the roes in the  centre of a heated platter, and dispose the eggs in a sort of hedge all  around them.--From \"The National Cook Book,\" by Marion Harland and  Christine Terhune Herrick.      10.--Chicken in Celery Sauce.    Take the roots of a bunch of celery, clean and cut it into small pieces,  put them into a saucepan and cover with cold water, about a pint, stew  slowly and when tender put through a vegetable press. Into a saucepan  put 1 tablespoonful each of flour and butter. When melted and rubbed  smooth add 1/2 a cup of milk and the celery. Stir well and when it boils  add salt and pepper. Have 1 pt. of cold chicken cut into dice, and add  them to the boiling sauce when all is hot. Serve with toast points.      11.--Fig Ice Cream.    Put 3-1/2 cupfuls of milk in a double boiler and as soon as it comes to  a boil stir in two tablespoonfuls of corn-starch that has been mixed  with 1/2 a cupful of cold milk. Cook for ten minutes. Beat together 3  eggs and a cup and a half of sugar. Pour the cooked corn-starch and milk  on this, stirring all the time. Put back again on the fire, and add 1  tablespoonful of gelatine which has been dissolved in 4 tablespoonfuls  of cold water. Cook three minutes. Set away to cool. When cold add 1 pt.  of cream and 1 tablespoonful of vanilla and freeze. When the mixture has  been freezing for ten minutes, take off the cover and add 2 cupfuls of  chopped figs. Cover again and freeze hard.      12.--Souffle Biscuit.    Rub 4 ozs. of butter with a qt. of wheat flour, add a little salt. Make  it into a paste with 1/2 a pt. of milk.

Into a saucepan put a layer of potatoes, a layer of fish,  then a few slices of the onion and bacon, then season. Continue until  all has been used. Add 1 qt. of water, cover and let simmer 20 minutes  without stirring. In a double boiler put 1 pt. of milk and break into it  6 water crackers; let it stand a few minutes then add to the chowder.  Let it boil up once and serve. Use 3 lbs. of chopped fish and 3 potatoes  for this.      14.--Cold Duck and Chestnut-Border.    Arrange slices of cold duck on a platter. Shell and blanch 1 qt. of  chestnuts, then boil until soft, drain and put them through a colander.  Add a tablespoonful of butter, salt and pepper to taste, arrange around  the cold duck.
