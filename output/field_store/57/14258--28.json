These kindred  phenomena are technically known as \"Transits\" and \"Occultations.\"  Putting these two matters entirely aside for the present, we will  confine our attention in the first instance to eclipses; and as eclipses  of the Sun do not stand quite on the same footing as eclipses of the  Moon, we will, after stating the general circumstances of the case, put  the eclipses of the Moon aside for a while.                                        CHAPTER II.                                GENERAL IDEAS.      The primary meaning of the word \"Eclipse\" ([Greek: ekleipsis]) is a  forsaking, quitting, or disappearance. Hence the covering over of  something by something else, or the immersion of something in something;  and these apparently crude definitions will be found on investigation to  represent precisely the facts of the case.    Inasmuch as the Earth and the Moon are for our present purpose  practically \"solid bodies,\" each must cast a shadow into space as the  result of being illuminated by the Sun, regarded as a source of light.  What we shall eventually have to consider is: What results arise from  the existence of these shadows according to the circumstances under  which they are viewed? But before reaching this point, some other  preliminary considerations must be dealt with.    The various bodies which together make up the Solar system, that is to  say, in particular, those bodies called the \"planets\"--some of them  \"primary,\" others \"secondary\" (_alias_ \"Satellites\" or \"Moons\")--are  constantly in motion. Consequently, if we imagine a line to be drawn  between any two at any given time, such a line will point in a different  direction at another time, and so it may occasionally happen that three  of these ever-moving bodies will come into one and the same straight  line. Now the consequences of this state of things were admirably well  pointed out nearly half a century ago by a popular writer, who in his  day greatly aided the development of science amongst the masses. \"When  one of the extremes of the series of three bodies which thus assume a  common direction is the Sun, the intermediate body deprives the other  extreme body, either wholly or partially, of the illumination which it  habitually receives. When one of the extremes is the Earth, the  intermediate body intercepts, wholly or partially, the other extreme  body from the view of the observers situate at places on the Earth which  are in the common line of direction, and the intermediate body is seen  to pass over the other extreme body as it enters upon or leaves the  common line of direction. The phenomena resulting from such  contingencies of position and direction are variously denominated  _Eclipses_, _Transits_, and _Occultations_, according to the relative  apparent magnitudes of the interposing and obscured bodies, and  according to the circumstances which attend them.\"[1]    The Earth moves round the Sun once in every year; the Moon moves round  the Earth once in every lunar month (27 days). I hope everybody  understands those essential facts. Then we must note that the Earth  moves round the Sun in a certain plane (it is nothing for our present  purpose what that plane is). If the Moon as the Earth's companion moved  round the Earth in the same plane, an eclipse of the Sun would happen  regularly every month when the Moon was in \"Conjunction\" (\"New Moon\"),  and also every month at the intermediate period there would be a total  eclipse of the Moon on the occasion of every \"Opposition\" (or \"Full  Moon\"). But inasmuch as the Moon's orbit does not lie in quite the same  plane as the Earth's, but is inclined thereto at an angle which may be  taken to average about 5-1/8 deg., the actual facts are different; that is to  say, instead of there being in every year about 25 eclipses (solar and  lunar in nearly equal numbers), which there would be if the orbits had  identical planes, there are only a very few eclipses in the year, never,  under the most favourable circumstances, more than 7, and sometimes as  few as 2. Nor are the numbers equally apportioned. In years where there  are 7 eclipses, 5 of them _may_ be of the Sun and 2 of the Moon; where  there are only 2 eclipses, both _must_ be of the Sun. Under no  circumstances can there be in any one year more than 3 eclipses of the  Moon, and in some years there will be none. The reasons for these  diversities are of a technical character, and a full elucidation of them  would not be of interest to the general reader. It may here be added,  parenthetically, that the occasions will be very rare of there being 5  solar eclipses in one year. This last happened in 1823,[2] and will  only happen once again in the next two centuries, namely in 1935. If a  total eclipse of the Sun happens early in January there may be another  in December of the same year, as in 1889 (Jan. 1 and Dec. 22). This will  not happen again till 2057, when there will be total eclipses on Jan. 5  and Dec. 26. There is one very curious fact which may be here  conveniently stated as a bare fact, reserving the explanation of it for  a future page, namely, that eclipses of the Sun and Moon are linked  together in a certain chain or sequence which takes rather more than 18  years to run out when the sequence recurs and recurs _ad infinitum_. In  this 18-year period, which bears the name of the \"Saros,\" there usually  happen 70 eclipses, of which 41 are of the Sun and 29 of the Moon.  Accordingly, eclipses of the Sun are more numerous than those of the  Moon in the proportion of about 3 to 2, yet at any given place on the  Earth more lunar eclipses are visible than solar eclipses, because the  former when they occur are visible over the whole hemisphere of the  Earth which is turned towards the Moon whilst the area over which a  total eclipse of the Sun is visible is but a belt of the Earth no more  than about 150 to 170 miles wide. Partial eclipses of the Sun, however,  are visible over a very much wider area on either side of the path  traversed by the Moon's shadow.    [Illustration: FIG. 2.--THEORY OF A TOTAL ECLIPSE OF THE SUN.]    Confining our attention in the first instance to eclipses of the Sun,  the diagrams fig. 2 and fig. 3 will make clear, with very little verbal  description, the essential features of the two principal kinds of  eclipses of the Sun. In these figures S represents the Sun, M the Moon  and E the Earth. They are not, of course, even approximately drawn to  scale either as to the size of the bodies or their relative distances,  but this is a matter of no moment as regards the principles involved. M  being in sunshine receives light on, as it were, the left hand side,  which faces S the Sun. The shadow of the Moon cast into space is, in the  particular case, thrown as regards its tip on to the Earth and is  intercepted by the Earth. Persons at the moment situated on the Earth  within the limits of this shadow will not see any part of the Sun at  all; they will see, in fact, nothing but the Moon as a black disc with  only such light behind and around it as may be reflected back on to the  sky by the illuminated (but to the Earth invisible) hemisphere of the  Moon, or as may proceed from the Sun's Corona (to be described  presently). The condition of things therefore is that known as a \"total\"  eclipse of the Sun so far as regards the inhabitants of the narrow strip  of Earth primarily affected.    [Illustration: FIG. 3.--THEORY OF AN ANNULAR ECLIPSE OF THE SUN.]    Fig. 3 represents nearly but not quite the same condition of things.  Here the Earth and the Moon are in those parts of their respective  orbits which put the two bodies at or near the maximum distance  possible from the Sun and from one another. The Moon casts its usual  shadow, but the tip does not actually reach any part of the Earth's  surface. Or, in other words, to an observer on the Earth the Moon is not  big enough to conceal the whole body of the Sun. The result is this; at  the instant of central coincidence the Moon covers up only the centre of  the Sun, leaving the outer edge all round uncovered.    This outer edge shows as a bright ring of light, and the eclipse is of  the sort known as an \"annular\" eclipse of the Sun.[3] As the greatest  breadth of the annulus can never exceed 11/2 minutes of arc, an annular  eclipse may sometimes, in some part of its track, become almost or quite  total, and _vice versa_.    [Illustration: FIG. 4.--ANNULAR ECLIPSE OF THE SUN.]    The idea will naturally suggest itself, what exactly does happen to the  inhabitants living outside (on the one side or the other) of the strip  of the Earth where the central line of shadow falls? This depends in  every case on circumstances, but it may be stated generally that the  inhabitants outside the central line but within 1000 to 2000 miles on  either side, will see a larger or smaller part of the Sun concealed by  the Moon's solid body, simultaneously with the total concealment of the  Sun to the favoured individuals who live, or who for the moment are  located, within the limits of the central zone.    [Illustration: FIG. 5.--PARTIAL ECLIPSE OF THE SUN.]    Now we must advance one stage in our conceptions of the movements of the  Earth and the Moon, so far as regards the bearing of those movements on  the question of eclipses. The Earth moves in a plane which is called the  \"Plane of the Ecliptic,\" and correspondingly, the Sun has an _apparent_  annual motion in the same plane. The Moon moving in a different plane,  inclined to the first mentioned one to the extent of rather more than  5 deg., the Moon's orbit will evidently intersect the ecliptic in two  places. These places of intersection are called \"Nodes,\" and the line  which may be imagined to join these Nodes is called the \"Line of Nodes.\"  When the Moon is crossing the ecliptic from the S. to the N. side  thereof, the Moon is said to be passing through"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/24236"],[0,"Time and Tide: A Romance of the Moon (#2)"],[1,"the relative ranges of spring tides and neap  tides; and as the spring tides are produced by moon plus sun, while  the neap tides are produced by moon minus sun, we obtain a means of  actually weighing the relative masses of the sun and moon. This is one  of the remarkable facts which can be deduced from a prolonged study of  the tides.    The demonstration of the law of the tide-producing force is of a  mathematical character, and I do not intend in these lectures to enter  into mathematical calculations. There is, however, a simple line of  reasoning which, though it falls far short of actual demonstration,  may yet suffice to give a plausible reason for the law.    The tides really owe their origin to the fact that the tide-producing  agent operates more powerfully on those parts of the tide-exhibiting  body which are near to it, than on the more distant portions of the  same. The nearer the two bodies are together, the larger  proportionally will be the differences in the distances of its various  parts from the tide-producing body; and on this account the leverage,  so to speak, of the action by which the tides are produced is  increased. For instance, if the two bodies were brought within half  their original distance of each other, the relative size of each body,  as viewed from the other, will be doubled; and what we have called the  leverage of the tide-producing ability will be increased twofold. The  gravitation also between the two bodies is increased fourfold when the  distance is halved, and consequently, the tide-producing ability is  doubled for one reason, and increased fourfold again by another;  hence, the tides will be increased eightfold when the distance is  reduced to one half. Now, as eight is the cube of two, this  illustration may be taken as a verification of the law, that the  efficiency of a body as a tide-producer varies inversely as the cube  of the distance between it and the body on which the tides are being  raised.    For simplicity we may make the assumption that the whole of the earth  is buried beneath the ocean, and that the moon is placed in the plane  of the equator. We may also entirely neglect for the present the tides  produced by the sun, and we shall also make the further assumption  that friction is absent. What friction is capable of doing we shall,  however, refer to later on. The moon will act on the ocean and deform  it, so that there will be high tide along one meridian, and high tide  also on the opposite meridian. This is indeed one of the paradoxes by  which students are frequently puzzled when they begin to learn about  the tides. That the moon should pull the water up in a heap on one  side seems plausible enough. High tide will of course be there; and  the student might naturally think that the water being drawn in this  way into a heap on one side, there will of course be low tide on the  opposite side of the earth. A natural assumption, perhaps, but  nevertheless a very wrong one. There are at every moment two opposite  parts of the earth in a condition of high water; in fact, this will  be obvious if we remember that every day, or, to speak a little more  accurately, in every twenty-four hours and fifty one minutes, we have  on the average two high tides at each locality. Of course this could  not be if the moon raised only one heap of high water, because, as the  moon only appears to revolve around the earth once a day, or, more  accurately, once in that same average period of twenty-four hours and  fifty-one minutes, it would be impossible for us to have high tides  succeeding each other as they do in periods a little longer than  twelve hours, if only one heap were carried round the earth.    The first question then is, as to how these two opposite heaps of  water are placed in respect to the position of the moon. The most  obvious explanation would seem to be, that the moon should pull the  waters up into a heap directly underneath it, and that therefore there  should be high water underneath the moon. As to the other side, the  presence of a high tide there was, on this theory, to be accounted for  by the fact that the moon pulled the earth away from the waters on the  more remote side, just as it pulled the waters away from the more  remote earth on the side underneath the moon. It is, however,  certainly not the case that the high tide is situated in the simple  position that this law would indicate, and which we have represented  in Fig. 1, where the circular body is the earth, the ocean surrounding  which is distorted by the action of the tides.    [Illustration: FIG. 1.]    We have here taken an oval to represent the shape into which the water  is supposed to be forced or drawn by the tidal action of the  tide-producing body. This may possibly be a correct representation of  what would occur on an ideal globe entirely covered with a  frictionless ocean. But as our earth is not covered entirely by water,  and as the ocean is very far from being frictionless, the ideal tide  is not the tide that we actually know; nor is the ideal tide  represented by this oval even an approximation to the actual tides to  which our oceans are subject. Indeed, the oval does not represent the  facts at all, and of this it is only necessary to adduce a single fact  in demonstration. I take the fundamental issue so often debated, as to  whether in the ocean vibrating with ideal tides the high water or the  low water should be under the moon. Or to put the matter otherwise;  when we represent the displaced water by an oval, is the long axis of  the oval to be turned to the moon, as generally supposed, or is it to  be directed at right angles therefrom? If the ideal tides were in any  degree representative of the actual tides, so fundamental a question  as this could be at once answered by an appeal to the facts of  observation. Even if friction in some degree masked the phenomena,  surely one would think that the state of the actual tides should still  enable us to answer this question.    But a study of the tides at different ports fails to realize this  expectation. At some ports, no doubt, the tide is high when the moon  is on the meridian. In that case, of course, the high water is under  the moon, as apparently ought to be the case invariably, on a  superficial view. But, on the other hand, there are ports where there  is often low water when the moon is crossing the meridian. Yet other  ports might be cited in which every intermediate phase could be  observed. If the theory of the tides was to be the simple one so often  described, then at every port noon should be the hour of high water on  the day of the new moon or of the full moon, because then both  tide-exciting bodies are on the meridian at the same time. Even if the  friction retarded the great tidal wave uniformly, the high tide on the  days of full or change should always occur at fixed hours; but,  unfortunately, there is no such delightful theory of the tides as this  would imply. At Greenock no doubt there is high water at or about noon  on the day of full or change; and if it could be similarly said that  on the day of full or change there was high water everywhere at local  noon, then the equilibrium theory of the tides, as it is called,  would be beautifully simple. But this is not the case. Even around our  own coasts the discrepancies are such as to utterly discredit the  theory as offering any practical guide. At Aberdeen the high tide does  not appear till an hour later than the doctrine would suggest. It is  two hours late at London, three at Tynemouth, four at Tralee, five at  Sligo, and six at Hull. This last port would be indeed the haven of  refuge for those who believe that the low tide ought to be under the  moon. At Hull this is no doubt the case; and if at all other places  the water behaved as it does at Hull, why then, of course, it would  follow that the law of low water under the moon was generally true.  But then this would not tally with the condition of affairs at the  other places I have named; and to complete the cycle I shall add a few  more. At Bristol the high water does not get up until seven hours  after the moon has passed the meridian, at Arklow the delay is eight  hours, at Yarmouth it is nine, at the Needles it is ten hours, while  lastly, the moon has nearly got back to the meridian again ere it has  succeeded in dragging up the tide on which Liverpool's great commerce  so largely depends.    Nor does the result of studying the tides along other coasts beside  our own decide more conclusively on the mooted point. Even ports in  the vast ocean give a very uncertain response. Kerguelen Island and  Santa Cruz might seem to prove that the high tide occurs under the  moon, but unfortunately both Fiji and Ascension seem to present us  with an equally satisfactory demonstration, that beneath the moon is  the invariable home of low water.    I do not mean to say that the study of the tides is in other respects  such a confused subject as the facts I have stated would seem to  indicate. It becomes rather puzzling, no doubt, when we compare the  tides at one port with the tides elsewhere. The law and order are,  then, by no means conspicuous, they are often hardly discernible. But  when we confine our attention to the tides at a single port, the  problem becomes at once a very intelligible one. Indeed, the  investigation of the tides is an easy subject, if we are contented  with a reasonably approximate solution; should, however, it be  necessary to discuss fully the tides at any port, the theory of the  method necessary for doing so is available, and a most interesting and  beautiful theory it certainly is.    Let us then speak for a few moments about the methods by which we can  study the tides at a particular port. The principle on which it is  based is a very simple one.    It is the month of August, the 18th, we shall suppose, and we are  going to enjoy a"]]]
