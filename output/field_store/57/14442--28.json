The grey-green  German hordes had overwhelmed the greater part of Belgium and were  sweeping down into France whose people and military establishment  were all unprepared for attack from that quarter. For days the  little British army of perhaps 100,000 men, that forlorn hope which  the Germans scornfully called \"contemptible,\" but which man for man  probably numbered more veteran fighters than any similar unit on  either side, had been stoutly holding back the enemy's right wing  and fighting for the delay that alone could save Paris. At Mons they  had halted, hoping that here was the spot to administer to von  Kluck, beating upon their front, the final check. The hope was  futile. Looking back upon the day with knowledge of what General  French's army faced--a knowledge largely denied to him--it seems  that the British escape from annihilation was miraculous. And indeed  it was due to a modern miracle--the conquest of the air by man in  the development of the airplane.    General French was outnumbered and in danger of being flanked on his  left flank. His right he thought safe, for it was in contact with  the French line which extended eastward along the bank of the Somme  to where the dark fortress of Namur frowned on the steeps formed by  the junction of that river with the Meuse. At that point the French  line bent to the south following the course of the latter river.    Namur was expected to hold out for weeks. Its defence lasted but  three days! As a matter of fact it did not delay the oncoming  Germans a day, for they invested it and drove past in their fierce  assault upon Joffre's lines. Enormously outnumbered, the French were  broken and forced to retreat. They left General French's right flank  in the air, exposed to envelopment by von Kluck who was already  reaching around the left flank. The German troops were ample in  number to surround the British, cut them off from all support, and  crush or capture them all. This indeed they were preparing to do  while General French, owing to some mischance never yet explained,  was holding his ground utterly without knowledge that his allies had  already retired leaving his flank without protection.    [Illustration: Photo by Peter A. Juley.    _Dropping a Depth Bomb._    _From the Painting by Lieutenant Farre._]    When that fatal information arrived belatedly at the British  headquarters it seemed like a death warrant. The right of the line  had already been exposed for more than half-a-day. It was  inexplicable that it had not already been attacked. It was  unbelievable that the attack would not fall the next moment. But how  would it be delivered and where, and what force would the enemy  bring to it? Was von Kluck lulling the British into a false sense  of security by leaving the exposed flank unmenaced while he gained  their rear and cut off their retreat? Questions such as these  demanded immediate answer. Ten years before the most dashing scouts  would have clattered off to the front and would have required a day,  perhaps more, to complete the necessary reconnaissance. But though  of all nations, except of course the utterly negligent United  States, Great Britain had least developed her aviation corps, there  were attached to General French's headquarters enough airmen to meet  this need. In a few minutes after the disquieting news arrived the  beat of the propellers rose above the din of the battlefield and the  airplanes appeared above the enemy's lines. An hour or two sufficed  to gather the necessary facts, the fliers returned to headquarters,  and immediately the retreat was begun.    It was a beaten army that plodded back to the line of the Marne. Its  retreat at times narrowly approached a rout. But the army was not  crushed, annihilated. It remained a coherent, serviceable part of  the allied line in the successful action speedily fought along the  Marne. But had it not been for the presence of the airmen the  British expeditionary force would have been wiped out then and  there.    The battle of Mons gave the soldiers a legend which still  persists--that of the ghostly English bowmen of the time of Edward  the Black Prince who came back from their graves to save that field  for England and for France. Thousands of simple souls believe that  legend to-day. But it is no "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/3005"],[0,"Tom Swift and His Airship (#2)"],[1,"it, Tom Swift! You'll never build an airship;  even if you have a balloonist to help you!\"    \"I won't, eh?\" and Tom was a trifle nettled at the sneering manner of  his rival.    \"No, you won't! It takes a smarter fellow than you are to build an  airship that will sail. I believe I could beat you at it myself.\"    \"Oh, you think you could?\" asked Tom, and this time he had mastered his  emotions. He was not going to let Andy Foger make him angry.  \"Maybe  you can beat me at racing, too?\" he went on. \"If you think so, bring  out your Red Streak and I'll try the Arrow against her. I beat you  twice, and I can do it again!\"    This unexpected taunt disconcerted Andy. It was the truth, for, more  than once had Tom, in his motor-boat, proved more than a match for the  squint-eyed bully and his cronies.    \"Go back at him, Andy,\" advised Sam, in a low voice. \"Don't take any of  his guff!\"    \"I don't intend to,\" spluttered Andy. \"Maybe you did beat me in the  races, because my motor wasn't working right,\" he conceded, \"but you  can't do it again. Anyhow, that's got nothing to do with an airship.  I'll bet you can't make one!\"    \"I don't bet,\" replied Tom calmly, \"but if you wait a few weeks you'll  see me in an airship, and then, if you want to race the Red Streak  against that, I'll accommodate you. Or, if you want to enter into a  competition to build a dirigible balloon or an aeroplane I'm willing.\"    \"Huh! Think you're smart, don't you? Just because you helped save that  balloonist from being killed when his balloon caught fire,\" went on  Andy, for want of something better to say. \"But you'll never build an  airship!\"    \"Of course he won't!\" added Sam and Pete, bound to side with their  crony, to whom they were indebted for many automobile and motor-boat  rides.    \"Just wait,\" advised Tom, with a tantalizing smile. \"Meanwhile, if you  want to try the Red Streak against the Arrow, I'm willing. I have an  hour or so to spare.\"    \"Aw, keep still!\" muttered Andy, much discomfited, for the defeat of  his speedy boat, by a much smaller and less powerful one, was a sore  point with him. \"You just wait, that's all. I'll get even with you!\"    \"Look here!\" cried Tom, suddenly. \"You always say that whenever I get  the best of you. I'm sick of hearing it. I consider that a threat, and  I don't like it. If you don't look out, Andy Foger, you'll have trouble  with me, and at no very distant date!\"    Tom, with flashing eyes, and clenched fists, took a step forward. Andy  shrank back.    \"Don't be afraid of him,\" advised Sam. \"We'll stand by you, Andy.\"    \"I ain't afraid,\" muttered the red-haired lad, but it was noticed that  he shuffled off. \"You just wait, I'll fix you,\" he added to Tom. The  bully was plainly in a rage.    The young inventor was about to reply, and, possibly would have made a  more substantial rejoinder to Andy than mere words, when the gate  opened, and Mr. Sharp stepped out.    \"The fumes have all cleared away, Tom,\" he said. \"We can go in the  shop, now.\"    Without further notice of Andy Foger, Tom Swift turned aside, and  followed the aeronaut into the enclosed yard.          Chapter 2    Ned Sees Mysterious Men      \"Who were those fellows?\" asked the balloonist, of his companion.    \"Oh, some chaps who think we'll never build our airship, Mr. Sharp.  Andy Foger, and his crowd.\"    \"Well, we'll show them whether we will or not,\" rejoined the man.  \"I've just thought of one point where we made a mistake. Your father  suggested it to me. We need a needle valve in the gas tank. Then we can  control the flow of vapor better.\"    \"Of course!\" cried Tom. \"Why didn't I think of that? Let's try it.\" And  the pair hurried into the machine shop, eager to make another test,  which they hoped would be more successful.    The young inventor, for Tom Swift was entitled to that title, having  patented several machines, lived with his father, Barton Swift, on the  outskirts of the small town of Shopton, in New York State. Mr. Swift  was quite wealthy, having amassed a considerable fortune from several  of his patents, as he was also an inventor. Tom's mother had been dead  since he was a small child, and Mrs. Baggert kept house for the widower  and his son. There was also, in their household, an aged engineer,  named Garret Jackson, who attended to the engine and boilers that  operated machinery and apparatus in several small shops that surrounded  the Swift homestead; for Mr. Swift did most of his work at home.    As related in the first volume of this series, entitled \"Tom Swift and  His Motor-Cycle,\" the lad had passed through some strenuous adventures.  A syndicate of rich men, disappointed in a turbine motor they had  acquired from a certain inventor, hired a gang of scoundrels to get  possession of a turbine Mr. Swift had invented. Just before they made  the attempt, however, Tom became possessed of a motor-cycle.  It had  belonged to a wealthy man, Mr. Wakefield Damon, of Waterford, near Lake  Carlopa, which body of water adjoined the town of Shopton; but Mr.  Damon had two accidents with the machine, and sold it to Tom cheap. Tom  was riding his motorcycle to Albany, to deliver his father's model of  the turbine motor to a lawyer, in order to get a patent on it, when he  was attacked by the gang of bad men. These included Ferguson Appleson,  Anson Morse, Wilson Featherton, alias Simpson, Jake Burke, alias Happy  Harry, who sometimes masqueraded as a tramp, and Tod Boreck, alias  Murdock. These men knocked Tom unconscious, stole the valuable model  and some papers, and carried the youth away in their automobile.    Later the young inventor, following a clue given him by Eradicate  Sampson, an aged colored man, who, with his mule, Boomerang, went about  the country doing odd jobs, got on the trail of the thieves in a  deserted mansion in the woods at the upper end of the lake. Our hero,  with the aid of Mr. Damon, and some friends of the latter, raided the  old house, but the men escaped.    In the second book of the series, called \"Tom Swift and His  Motor-Boat,\" there was related the doings of the lad, his father and  his chum, Ned Newton, on Lake Carlopa. Tom bought at auction, a  motor-boat the thieves had stolen and damaged, and, fixing it up, made  a speedy craft of it so speedy, in fact that it beat the racing-boat  Red Streak--owned by Andy Foger. But Tom did more than race in his  boat. He took his father on a tour for his health, and, during Mr.  Swift's absence from home, the gang of bad men stole some of the  inventor's machinery. Tom set out after them in his motor boat, but the  scoundrels even managed to steal that, hoping to get possession of a  peculiar and mysterious treasure in it, and Tom had considerable  trouble.    Among other things he did when he had his craft, was to aid a Miss Mary  Nestor, who, in her cousin's small boat, the Dot, was having trouble  with the engine, and you shall hear more of Miss Nestor presently, for  she and Tom became quite friendly. Events so shaped themselves that  Andy Foger was glad to loan Tom the Red Streak in which to search for  the stolen Arrow, and it was in the later craft that Tom, his father  and Ned Newton had a most thrilling adventure.    They were on their way down the lake when, in the air overhead they saw  a balloon on fire, with a man clinging to the trapeze. They managed to  save the fellow's life, after a strenuous endeavor. The balloonist,  John Sharp, was destined to play quite a part in Tom's life.    Mr. Sharp was more than an aeronaut--he was the inventor of an  airship--that is, he had plans drawn for the more important parts, but  he had struck a \"snag of clouds,\" as he expressed it, and could not  make the machine work. His falling in with Mr. Swift and his son seemed  providential, for Tom and his father were at once interested in the  project for navigating the upper air. They began a study of Mr. Sharp's  plans, and the balloonist was now in a fair way to have the difficulty  solved.    His airship was, primarily an aeroplane, but with a sustaining aluminum  container, shaped like a cigar, and filled with a secret gas, made  partly of hydrogen, being very light and powerful. It was testing the  effect of this gas on a small model of the aluminum container that the  explosion, told of in the first chapter, occurred. In fact it was only  one of several explosions, but, as Tom said, all the while they were  eliminating certain difficulties, until now the airship seemed almost a  finished thing. But a few more details remained to be worked out, and  Mr. Swift and his son felt that they could master these.    So it was with a feeling of no little elation, that the young inventor  followed Mr. Sharp into the shop. The balloonist, it may be explained,  had been invited to live with the Swifts pending the completion of the  airship.    \"Do you think we'll get on the right track if we put the needle valve  in?\" asked Tom, as he noted with satisfaction that the damage from the  explosion was not great.    \"I'm sure we will,\" answered the aeronaut. \"Now let's make another  model container, and try the gas again.\"    They set to work, with Mr. Swift helping them occasionally, and Garret  Jackson, the engineer, lending a hand whenever he was needed. All that  afternoon work on the airship progressed. The joint inventors of it  wanted to be sure that the sustaining gas bag, or aluminum container,  would do its work properly, as this would hold them in the air, and  prevent accidents, in case of a stoppage of the engine or propellers.    The aeroplane part of the airship was all but finished, and the motor,  a powerful machine, of new design, built by Mr. Swift, was ready to be  installed.    All that afternoon Tom, his father and Mr. Sharp labored in the shop.  As it grew dusk there sounded from the house the ringing of a bell.    \"Supper time,\" remarked Tom, laying aside a wrench. \"I wish Mrs.  Baggert would wait about an hour. I'd"]]]
