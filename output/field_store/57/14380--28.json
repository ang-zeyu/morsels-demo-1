Now I am going to toast you well, and try to get rid of  that ugly cough. How long have you had it, dear?\" asked Mrs. Bhaer, as  she rummaged in her big basket for a strip of flannel.    \"All winter. I got cold, and it wouldn't get better, somehow.\"    \"No wonder, living in that damp cellar with hardly a rag to his poor  dear back!\" said Mrs. Bhaer, in a low tone to her husband, who was  looking at the boy with a skillful pair of eyes that marked the thin  temples and feverish lips, as well as the hoarse voice and frequent fits  of coughing that shook the bent shoulders under the patched jacket.    \"Robin, my man, trot up to Nursey, and tell her to give thee the  cough-bottle and the liniment,\" said Mr. Bhaer, after his eyes had  exchanged telegrams with his wife's.    Nat looked a little anxious at the preparations, but forgot his fears in  a hearty laugh, when Mrs. Bhaer whispered to him, with a droll look:    \"Hear my rogue Teddy try to cough. The syrup I'm going to give you has  honey in it; and he wants some.\"    Little Ted was red in the face with his exertions by the time the bottle  came, and was allowed to suck the spoon after Nat had manfully taken a  dose and had the bit of flannel put about his throat.    These first steps toward a cure were hardly completed when a great bell  rang, and a loud tramping through the hall announced supper. Bashful Nat  quaked at the thought of meeting many strange boys, but Mrs. Bhaer held  out her hand to him, and Rob said, patronizingly, \"Don't be 'fraid; I'll  take care of you.\"    Twelve boys, six on a side, stood behind their chairs, prancing with  impatience to begin, while the tall flute-playing youth was trying to  curb their ardor. But no one sat down till Mrs. Bhaer was in her place  behind the teapot, with Teddy on her left, and Nat on her right.    \"This is our new boy, Nat Blake. After supper you can say how do you do?  Gently, boys, gently.\"    As she spoke every one stared at Nat, and then whisked into their seats,  trying to be orderly and failing utterly. The Bhaers did their best to  have the lads behave well at meal times, and generally succeeded pretty  well, for their rules were few and sensible, and the boys, knowing that  they tried to make things easy and happy, did their best to obey.  But there are times when hungry boys cannot be repressed without real  cruelty, and Saturday evening, after a half-holiday, was one of those  times.    \"Dear little souls, do let them have one day in which they can howl and  racket and frolic to their hearts' content. A holiday isn't a holiday  without plenty of freedom and fun; and they shall have full swing once  a week,\" Mrs. Bhaer used to say, when prim people wondered why  banister-sliding, pillow-fights, and all manner of jovial games were  allowed under the once decorous roof of Plumfield.    It did seem at times as if the aforesaid roof was in danger of flying  off, but it never did, for a word from Father Bhaer could at any time  produce a lull, and the lads had learned that liberty must not be  abused. So, in spite of many dark predictions, the school flourished,  and manners and morals were insinuated, without the pupils exactly  knowing how it was done.    Nat found himself very well off behind the tall pitchers, with Tommy  Bangs just around the corner, and Mrs. Bhaer close by to fill up plate  and mug as fast as he could empty them.    \"Who is that boy next the girl down at the other end?\" whispered Nat to  his young neighbor under cover of a general laugh.    \"That's Demi Brooke. Mr. Bhaer is his uncle.\"    \"What a queer name!\"    \"His real name is John, but they call him Demi-John, because his  father is John too. That's a joke, don't you see?\" said Tommy, kindly  explaining. Nat did not see, but politely smiled, and asked, with  interest:    \"Isn't he a very nice boy?\"    \"I bet you he is; knows lots and reads like any thing.\"    \"Who is the fat one next him?\"    \"Oh, that's Stuffy Cole. His name is George, but we call him Stuffy  'cause he eats so much. The little fellow next Father Bhaer is his boy  Rob, and then there's big Franz his nephew; he teaches some, and kind of  sees to us.\"    \"He plays the flute, doesn't he?\" asked Nat as Tommy rendered himself  speechless by putting a whole baked apple into his mouth at one blow.    Tommy nodded, and said, sooner than one would have imagined possible  under the circumstances, \"Oh, don't he, though? And we dance sometimes,  and do gymnastics to music. I like a drum myself, and mean to learn as  soon as ever I can.\"    \"I like a fiddle best; I can play one too,\" said Nat, getting  confidential on this attractive subject.    \"Can you?\" and Tommy stared over the rim of his mug with round eyes,  full of interest. \"Mr. Bhaer's got an old fiddle, and he'll let you play  on it if you want to.\"    \"Could I? Oh, I would like it ever so much. You see, I used to go round  fiddling with my father, and another man, till he died.\"    \"Wasn't that fun?\" cried Tommy, much impressed.    \"No, it was horrid; so cold in winter, and hot in summer. And I got  tired; and they were cross sometimes; and I didn't get enough to eat.\"  Nat paused to take a generous bite of gingerbread, as if to assure  himself that the hard times were over; and then he added regretfully:  \"But I did love my little fiddle, and I miss it. Nicolo took it away  when father died, and wouldn't have me any longer, 'cause I was sick.\"    \"You'll belong to the band if you play good. See if you don't.\"    \"Do you have a band here?\" Nat's eyes sparkled.    \"Guess we do; a jolly band, all boys; and they have concerts and things.  You just see what happens to-morrow night.\"    After this pleasantly exciting remark, Tommy returned to his supper, and  Nat sank into a blissful reverie over his full plate.    Mrs. Bhaer had heard all they said, while apparently absorbed in filling  mugs, and overseeing little Ted, who was so sleepy that he put his spoon  in his eye, nodded like a rosy poppy, and finally fell fast asleep, with  his cheek pillowed on a soft bun. Mrs. Bhaer had put Nat next to Tommy,  because that roly-poly boy had a frank and social way with him, very  attractive to shy persons. Nat felt this, and had made several small  confidences during supper, which gave Mrs. Bhaer the key to the new  boy's character, better than if she had talked to him herself.    In the letter which Mr. Laurence had sent with Nat, he had said:    \"DEAR JO: Here is a case after your own heart. This poor lad is an  orphan now, sick and friendless. He has been a street-musician; and  I found him in a cellar, mourning for his dead father, and his lost  violin. I think there is something in him, and have a fancy that between  us we may give this little man a lift. You cure his overtasked body,  Fritz help his neglected mind, and when he is ready I'll see if he is  a genius or only a boy with a talent which may earn his bread for him.  Give him a trial, for the sake of your own boy,    \"TEDDY.\"    \"Of course we will!\" cried Mrs. Bhaer, as she read the letter; and when  she saw Nat she felt at once that, whether he was a genius or not, here  was a lonely, sick boy who needed just what she loved to give, a home  and motherly care. Both she and Mr. Bhaer observed him quietly; and in  spite of ragged clothes, awkward manners, and a dirty face, they saw  much about Nat that pleased them. He was a thin, pale boy, of twelve,  with blue eyes, and a good forehead under the rough, neglected hair; an  anxious, scared face, at times, as if he expected hard words, or blows;  and a sensitive mouth that trembled when a kind glance fell on him;  while a gentle speech called up a look of gratitude, very sweet to see.  \"Bless the poor dear, he shall fiddle all day long if he likes,\" said  Mrs. Bhaer to herself, as she saw the eager, happy expression on his  face when Tommy talked of the band.    So, after supper, when the lads flocked into the schoolroom for more  \"high jinks,\" Mrs. Jo appeared with a violin in her hand, and after a  word with her husband, went to Nat, who sat in a corner watching the  scene with intense interest.    \"Now, my lad, give us a little tune. We want a violin in our band, and I  think you will do it nicely.\"    She expected that he would hesitate; but he seized the old fiddle at  once, and handled it with such loving care, it was plain to see that  music was his passion.    \"I'll do the best I can, ma'am,\" was all he said; and then drew the bow  across the strings, as if eager to hear the dear notes again.    There was a great clatter in the room, but as if deaf to any sounds but  those he made, Nat played softly to himself, forgetting every thing in  his delight. It was only a simple Negro melody, such as street-musicians  play, but it caught the ears of the boys at once, and silenced them,  till they stood listening with surprise and pleasure. Gradually they got  nearer and nearer, and Mr. Bhaer came up to watch the boy; for, as if he  was in his element now, Nat played away and never minded any one, while  his eyes shone, his cheeks reddened, and his thin fingers flew, as he  hugged the old fiddle and made it speak to all their hearts the language  that he loved.    A hearty round of applause rewarded him better than a shower of pennies,  when he stopped and glanced about him, as if to say:    \"I've done my best; please like it.\"    \"I say, you do that first rate,\" cried Tommy, who considered Nat his  protege.    \"You shall be the first fiddle in my band,\" added Franz, with an  approving smile.    Mrs. Bhaer whispered to her husband:    \"Teddy is right: there's something in the child.\" And Mr. Bhaer nodded  his head emphatically, as he clapped Nat on the shoulder, saying,  heartily:    \"You play well, my son. Come now and play something which we can sing.\"    It was the proudest, happiest minute of the poor boy's life when he was  led to the place of honor by the piano, and the lads"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/27887"],[0,"Wild Animals at Home (#2)"],[1,"The Rabbit Dance                                          160            The Ghost Rabbit                                          163        A Narrow-gauge Mule--The Prairie Hare                         164        The Bump of Moss that Squeaks                                 165            The Weatherwise Coney                                     169            His Safety Is in the Rocks                                171      =X.

He is even yet found in every part of it, but, unlike his big  brother the Wolf, he never frequented the region known as Eastern  America.    This is one of the few wild creatures that you can see from the train.  Each time I have come to the Yellowstone Park I have discovered the  swift gray form of the Coyote among the Prairie-dog towns along the  River flat between Livingstone and Gardiner, and in the Park itself have  seen him nearly every day, and heard him every night without exception.    [Illustration]    Coyote (pronounced _Ky-o'-tay_, and in some regions _Ky-ute_) is a  native Mexican contribution to the language, and is said to mean  \"halfbreed,\" possibly suggesting that the Coyote looks like a cross  between the Fox and the Wolf. Such an origin would be a very  satisfactory clue to his character, for he does seem to unite in himself  every possible attribute in the mental make-up of the other two that can  contribute to his success in life.    He is one of the few Park animals not now protected, for the excellent  reasons, first that he is so well able to protect himself, second he is  even already too numerous, third he is so destructive among the  creatures that he can master. He is a beast of rare cunning; some of the  Indians call him God's dog or Medicine dog. Some make him the embodiment  of the Devil, and some going still further, in the light of their larger  experience, make the Coyote the Creator himself seeking amusement in  disguise among his creatures, just as did the Sultan in the \"Arabian  Nights.\"    [Illustration]    The naturalist finds the Coyote interesting for other reasons. When you  see that sleek gray and yellow form among the mounds of the Prairie-dog,  at once creating a zone of blankness and silence by his very presence as  he goes, remember that he is hunting for something to eat; also, that  there is another, his mate, not far away. For the Coyote is an  exemplary and moral little beast who has only one wife; he loves her  devotedly, and they fight the life battle together. Not only is there  sure to be a mate close by, but that mate, if invisible, is likely to be  playing a game, a very clever game as I have seen it played.    Furthermore, remember there is a squealing brood of little Coyotes in  the home den up on a hillside a mile or two away. Father and mother must  hunt continually and successfully to furnish their daily food. The  dog-towns are their game preserves, but how are they to catch a  Prairie-dog! Every one knows that though these little yapping  Ground-squirrels will sit up and bark at an express train but twenty  feet away, they scuttle down out of sight the moment a man, dog or  Coyote enters into the far distant precincts of their town; and  downstairs they stay in the cyclone cellar until after a long interval  of quiet that probably proves the storm to be past. Then they poke their  prominent eyes above the level, and, if all is still, will softly hop  out and in due course, resume their feeding.      THE PRAIRIE-DOG OUTWITTED    [Illustration]    This is how the clever Coyote utilizes these habits. He and his wife  approach the dog-town unseen. One Coyote hides, then the other walks  forward openly into the town. There is a great barking of all the  Prairie-dogs as they see their enemy approach, but they dive down when  he is amongst them. As soon as they are out of sight the second Coyote  rushes forward and hides near any promising hole that happens to have  some sort of cover close by. Meanwhile, Coyote number one strolls on.  The Prairie-dogs that he scared below come up again. At first each puts  up the top of his head merely, with his eyes on bumps, much like those  of a hippopotamus, prominent and peculiarly suited for this observation  work from below, as they are the first things above ground. After a  brief inspection, if all be quiet, he comes out an inch more. Now he can  look around, the coast is clear, so he sits up on the mound and scans  his surroundings.    [Illustration]    Yes! Ho! Ho! he sees his enemy, that hated Coyote, strolling away off  beyond the possibility of doing harm. His confidence is fully restored  as the Coyote gets smaller in the distance and the other Prairie-dogs  coming out seem to endorse his"]]]
