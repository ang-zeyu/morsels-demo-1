In fact, it is known among the jungle folks as the _Elephant  Path_; for no other animal would dare to use it before the elephants  did.    The elephants, being the biggest of all animals, are the _lords of the  jungle_; so they have the right to come first to drink. They are also the  wisest of all animals. You have seen many kinds of animals--elephants,  horses, dogs, monkeys, and others--do funny tricks in a circus. Now, all  these animals except the elephant have to be _taught_ to do tricks; the  elephant is the only animal that can think out a trick for itself.    Of course in a circus there is always a teacher, or trainer, to show  even the elephant how to do tricks; but in the jungle the elephant can  find out how to do things for itself.    Very soon I shall tell you about the tricks which the elephant  actually does in the jungle; and as you hear about them, you must  _think_! Why? Because then you will know _why_ the elephant does these  things--and that will show you how clever _you_ can be!      _Elephants Drink First--but Down Stream_    First let us watch the elephants as they come to the river through the  gap in the jungle.    See! They come one at a time, _one behind another;_ for the gap is not  big enough for more than one at the same time. The elephant is so big  that it can get through the jungle only in this way.    First come a number of _bull elephants_. They are the Papa elephants;  you can always tell them by the _huge tusks_ they have. The bulls  come first, in case there are any enemies waiting to hurt their  children; for then the bulls can drive off the enemies.    As each bull elephant comes through the gap, you see him turn to our  right, which is _down_ the stream--that is, the way the water flows.  You see the first one walk along the bank that way, and the second  comes after him, then the third, and so on.    But why do they walk along the bank? To make room, of course, for all  their friends who are still coming from behind. In this way about a  dozen bull elephants come ahead of all the others.    After them you see the _cow elephants_, also in a line, one behind  another. They are the Mamma elephants; and nearly every one of them  has a baby elephant trotting in _front_ of her. You have often seen  the ordinary cow that gives you milk; when she goes to graze in the  field, her baby, or calf, trots by her side.    But the Mamma elephant is much wiser, and always tells her baby to  toddle in _front_ of her, in case any one comes suddenly to hurt or  steal the baby. For a tiger sometimes wants to pounce on the baby from  the side, grab it quickly, and carry it away. But he cannot do it if  the baby is right in front of its Mamma; for then she will drive him  off with her tusks, even if they are not quite so big as the tusks  that the Papa elephants have.    As the Mammas reach the bank, each with her baby, you see them also  walk along the bank down stream in a long line.    After all the Mammas and babies have come, you see another set of bull  elephants coming out of the jungle. Why? Because some enemy might try  to attack the Mammas and the babies from the _back_; so these bull  elephants are there to guard them. You see, the Mammas and the babies  are _always in the middle_, safe from all harm.    When all the elephants have reached the stream, they stand in line and  face the water. All these elephants belong to _one herd_; you can  count about a hundred. A herd of elephants is really a _republic_,  like the United States of America, and has a President, who is the  wisest bull in the herd.    In another book I shall tell you how the elephants choose their  President, and make laws, and keep order in the herd; how they choose  some strong bulls among them to act as _policemen_ in the herd, and  catch and punish any naughty elephant who becomes a _rogue_; and how,  if two elephants start quarrelling and fighting like naughty boys, the  police elephants have to catch and punish both of them. Also, I shall  tell you how the President has to lead the herd every day when they go  in search of food, so that they will have plenty to eat.    And in the jungle, as there are other elephant herds and sometimes two  herds find the same feeding ground, and then start quarrelling and  fighting as to who found it first, it is the duty of the President to  keep his own herd away from the two that are fighting, and not mix in  the fight in any way. All these wonderful things and many others you  will read in the other book, when you are a little older.    But let us see what the President has to do when the whole herd is  standing in line, facing the water. He is at the bottom of the line,  far down stream; so he looks up along the line to see that all are  ready. Then he gives the signal for them to begin drinking; he does  this by dipping his trunk into the water. Then the second one sees him  do it, and does the same; in that way each elephant higher up the line  sees that the next one below him has started drinking, so he too does  the same. Soon they are all drinking, as you see in the picture at the  beginning of this book.    But why does the President have to give the signal to begin? Why is it  that any elephant, anywhere along the line, cannot start drinking,  just as he or she pleases? Think!    Because if any one along the line started drinking too soon, he might  muddy the water for those that stood _below_ him along the line,  because the water flows down that way. But if the lower ones drank a  little before, it would not matter if they _did_ muddy the water, for  the higher ones would still have clear water to drink. That is why the  lowest one drinks first, then the next, and so on up the line. Is not  that very wise, and very fair to all?      _How the Elephant Drinks_    But you must not think that an elephant actually drinks _through_ his  trunk! He does not! The elephant's trunk is really his nose, though it  is a very long nose. What he does is to dip the trunk into the stream  and suck in the water about halfway up the trunk; then he curls up the  tip of the trunk and gets it near his mouth; then he _blows_ through  the nose, and _squirts_ the water into his mouth. Of course he has to  do that many times, to get enough to drink. But he tries each time to  dip only the tip of the trunk into the stream, so as not to muddy the  water willfully!      _Why the Elephant Drinks with His Trunk_    But, you may say, why cannot he drink like other animals, by going  right into the stream till he gets his _mouth_ into the water? Because  his mouth is so high up, and his neck is so stiff, that he would have  to go quite two or three yards deep into the stream before he could  get his mouth into the water, and then his heavy feet would stir up  the mud in the stream where he was standing, and so dirty the very  water he was drinking.    Now you see what a wise animal the elephant is! The only way he could  get clear water to drink was by having a long nose! And that is  exactly what happened many, many years ago--his nose became long  enough to reach the water from the bank. How that happened I shall  tell you in another book, as you will not understand it till you are a  year or two older.    All the grown-up elephants drink in this way, and also some of the  elephant children whose trunks have grown long enough to reach the  stream. But what about a baby elephant? Why, its Mamma fills her own  trunk with water, puts the tip into the baby's mouth and squirts the  water into it.    But now after watching the elephants--who are on our right, down the  stream--let us turn our eyes to the left, and look _up_ the stream.          CHAPTER II    The Law of the Jungle      Hush! Here come all the animals! The _buffaloes_, the _blue deer_, the  _red deer_, the _wild pigs_, the _hyenas_, the _wolves_, the _red  dogs_, and many others. Watch and see how each kind of animal comes;  it is not always in the same way. The moon is now shining clear above  the trees, and we can see a long way up the stream.    See the _buffaloes!_ They come a little _above the elephants_. But  they do not come one behind another in a line, like the elephants.  They come three or four together. They also have beaten down the  bushes there years ago, to make a drinking place; and it is wide  enough for three or four of them to drink at the same time, side by  side.      _How Buffaloes Come to Drink--in Rows_    But why must they drink three or four at the same time? Because the  buffaloes are like a body of soldiers, one row behind another.  Sometimes twenty or thirty rows make up a herd. We see only the first  row drinking now, but soon we shall see the others behind.    And why do the buffaloes come like a body of soldiers? Because they  are afraid of their enemy--the tiger! Once upon a time the buffaloes  lived scattered about, and many of them got eaten by the tiger, one at  a time. Then those that escaped from the tiger became wise; they  joined together like a body of soldiers, so that they could beat off  the tiger. How they came to do that, I shall tell you at another time.    But now let us watch the first row drinking. They are all _bull  buffaloes_, the Papas of the herd; you can tell that by their _huge  horns_, a yard long on each side of the head. You see how the  buffaloes stand side by side, so that their horns almost touch one  another. That is the way the buffaloes have marched to the stream from  their feeding place--horn to horn. Why? Because no prowling tiger can  get past those horns.    Watch the first row as it finishes drinking; the whole row wheels  around to the side like soldiers. Then the buffaloes that have had  their drink march to the back of the herd, and stand there in a row  facing the jungle.    Meanwhile the second row in the front has stepped to the water to  drink. These also are bull buffaloes. When they finish drinking, they  also wheel, march to the"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/24855"],[0,"Concrete Construction: Methods and Costs (#2)"],[1,"Reinforced Piles by Rolling.

Concrete is an artificial stone produced by mixing cement mortar with  broken stone, gravel, broken slag, cinders or other similar fragmentary  materials. The component parts are therefore hydraulic cement, sand and  the broken stone or other coarse material commonly designated as the  aggregate.      CEMENT.    At least a score of varieties of hydraulic cement are listed in the  classifications of cement technologists. The constructing engineer and  contractor recognize only three varieties: Portland cement, natural  cement and slag or puzzolan cement. All concrete used in engineering  work is made of either Portland, natural or slag cement, and the great  bulk of all concrete is made of Portland cement. Only these three  varieties of cement are, therefore, considered here and they only in  their aspects having relation to the economics of construction work. For  a full"]]]
