This book contains a  record of many ugly, dark and wicked deeds, known in the lives of wicked  men and nations, with imperfections and apostacies of individuals in  high places. This is what we must look for in a book of its pretensions.  It professes to contain a revelation of God and his will to man. The  ugly, wicked, licentious, and bloody things constitute the background of  the picture, representing man in all his ways. It is also shaded with  all there was, and is, of moral and noble character in the human. God  with his attributes, as the true, grand and glorious Bible picture,  shines out through this human background. The justice of God, with his  love, long suffering and tender mercies, his approbation and  disapprobation, must in the very nature of things be revealed in  connection with human character as it presents itself in iniquity and  crime, in piety and virtue, both individual and national, in order that  the revelation may be complete, full and perfect. The history of men and  nations must also be true, sufficiently full to call out, in the divine  dealings, all there is in the divine character; otherwise, the  revelation would be partial and imperfect.    No physician ever revealed his skill without his patients. No court has  ever revealed its justice without its cases. The doctor's dealings with  his patients measure the extent of his known skill. Allowing that he  understands himself and the conditions of his patients perfectly, and  does his whole duty, the revelation of his skill must be perfect, to the  full extent of its connection with the diseases treated. So it is with  the revealed justice of the court. This rule is a necessary law,  governing all revelations of character, both human and divine; otherwise  we are left in the dark with reference to the true character of the one  who makes the revelation. Our common sense is such that we are always  led astray by improper action, unless our superior wisdom enables us to  know that the action is improper. Improper action upon the part of a  doctor reveals imperfect skill; on the part of the court it reveals  imperfect justice, if it is not an entire want of skill and justice.    No such imperfection belongs to our God; therefore the revelation which  he made needs only to be understood and it will never mislead us. These  great principles of common sense are to be applied in the revelations of  God to the nations as the God of nations. Such being the case, we have a  very interesting field of thought before us in the bloody scenes that  are known in the history of nations, as it is given in the Bible. Where  is the morality and righteousness of the wars of which we read? Where is  the justice and goodness of God in the bloody wars of Israel? Where is  the righteousness of capital punishment? A great many persons say, in  their ignorance, there is no righteousness in those things. Friend,  travel slowly over this ground. \"Take the shoes off thy feet, for it is  holy ground.\" Go into the Bible and look! God is there. You knew it not.  Principles never change. Circumstances change and necessitate changes of  law, but that which was right at any time in the history of our race is  right at all times, under the same circumstances. Is there such a thing  as morality carried into public relations? Is there such a thing as  jurisprudence? Yes; jurisprudence is morality carried into public  relations in the following law: \"That course of conduct which pertains  to the greatest good of the greatest number is right.\" This law is of  universal application. It belongs to men in all their relations, both  public and private, collectively and individually. In the relation of  the State to its citizens it taxes them for the support of government,  it fines, imprisons and puts them to death for crime. In the relation of  nation to nation it imposes tariffs and declares war, filling history  with scenes of blood and woe. The common sense of mankind approves this  law, and the Bible declares it just. Wars were approved of God, when  they were for the greatest good of the greater number. It was upon the  same principle that all the divine judgments were administered, from the  destruction of the Antediluvians down to the overthrow of Jerusalem by  Titus.    This law is the substratum in moral righteousness, underlying all that  is right. Such is its wonderful latitude and longitude that, in order to  carry it out, it sometimes becomes necessary to tilt a nation into a  sea of blood and replace it with a better people. Unbelievers and  skeptics who admit this are guilty of wresting Bible facts from their  proper places and testing them upon the plane of morality, regardless of  the laws of jurisprudence.    This erroneous method of reasoning leads the minds of many ignorant and  unsuspecting persons away from the right ways of God. The guilty  reasoner justifies taxation, fines, imprisonment and wars in the history  of his own country.    It sometimes seems cruel to carry out this great moral principle of  which we are treating; it is nevertheless right, and men who abuse its  facts and turn things upside down are guilty of opposing the right.    Unbelievers are guilty of selecting from the Bible all that can be  tortured out of its place in the laws of jurisprudence and made to look  ugly out of its proper relations, and are continually holding such  things up before the people, turning them into ridicule, and at the same  time they have been through all the bloody scenes of war and justify  themselves, wishing to be known in many instances as Major, General or  Colonel. We have some such in our own country. They seem to have never  learned that many things which are good for humanity are very ugly out  of their proper relations. I am glad that God has revealed himself in  the jurisprudence of nations, for the facts given inspire confidence in  rulers and officials, strength to judges upon the bench, and nerve to  warriors who are acting with direct reference to the \"greatest good of  the greatest number.\"    A history of God in his dealings with states and nations in order to a  perfect revelation of himself necessitates a history of states and  nations so far as it is necessary to make known the approbation and  disapprobation of God in connection with all that may ever enter into  national or state character. Without this we would find states and  nations where God did not see fit to show himself. We must find him  wherever we find man, approving or disapproving. This is just what we do  in the Bible. We do it in no other book. But let us ever remember that  all that is wicked had its origin with wicked men and demons, and that  the Divine Being, with all his attributes, appears in the foreground in  all his relations to men and their conduct, as the grand Bible picture  shining out through all the darkness and gloom, surrounded with the  virtues and noble deeds of all his worshipers, and that he is building  up and throwing down as his righteous judgment approves or disapproves.  This revelation of God is like the sun at noonday bursting through dark  and heavy clouds and blessing the earth with its rays. In making this  revelation, which is related negatively or affirmatively to all there is  in human history, God saw fit to communicate his will through man, and  in his own language, except in the gift of the great charter of the  national existence of the children of Israel and the great foundation  truth of the church of God. These he uttered with his own wonderful  voice.    Was it reasonable to expect a revelation from God? Is it necessary to  the greatest good of the greatest number? If so, it is a thought at once  involving the moral character of God and necessitating a revelation of  himself. In answering these questions intelligently we must look after  the demands for such a communication. Where shall we find them? Answer,  in the wants of our humanity. Here two kinds of light are needed for two  pair of eyes in order that we may be happy in two respects. First,  physical light for the physical eyes, in order to the enjoyment of  physical life in a material world. Second, the light of knowledge for  the eyes of the understanding, in order to the enjoyment of spiritual  life in a spiritual world. It is universally conceded that there are  means provided in nature to meet man's physical wants and adaptations  that manifest the wisdom that belongs to God; also, that it would have  been the work of a demon to create man with these wants, like so many  empty vessels, without any provision to satisfy or fill them. Without  those supplies our suffering would be great and our wretchedness  unendurable. Is there no liability to mental suffering? Are there no  spiritual wants consequent upon the nature of mind?    Is it not unreasonable to allow that \"Infinite wisdom\" provided for all  our physical wants and left our spirits with all their demands, like so  many children away out in the darkness without hope, uneasy, restless,  always dissatisfied, and ever trying to get into the possession of the  knowledge of the unseen and future, without one ray of mental light  shining out from the heavens upon our relations to perfect our condition  and declare the glorious goodness of an all-wise Creator? Volney says,  \"Provident nature having endowed the heart of man with inexhaustible  hope, he set about finding happiness in this world, and failing in his  efforts, he set out in his imagination and created a world for himself,  where, free from tyrants, he could have all his wrongs redressed and  enjoy unsullied bliss.\" This is Volney's account of the origin of  religion, the tap-root of the tree. It contains a most wonderful  concession, one that "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/26323"],[0,"The Suffrage Cook Book (#2)"],[1,"Bellevue, Pa.
