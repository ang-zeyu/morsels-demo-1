The prince was dressed out for the occasion in a  sufficiently grotesque costume, which he wore with ironic gravity and  cavalier ease. A black satin doublet, knee breeches, embroidered  stockings, and shoes with gold buckles, formed the main portions of his  dress, over which trailed a long brocaded open-sleeved robe lined with  ermine, and a magnificent diamond-hilted sword. On account of his rank  he enjoyed the rare distinction of carrying one of the six gilded staves  that supported the plumed and embroidered canopy.    As soon as the procession moved on again, Eligi of Brancaleone gave a  side glance to a little man as red as a lobster, who was walking almost  at his side, and carrying in his right hand, with all the solemnity that  he could muster, his excellency's hat. He was a footman in gold-laced  livery, and we beg leave to give a brief sketch of his history. Trespolo  was the child of poor but thieving parents, and on that account was  early left an orphan. Being at leisure, he studied life from an  eminently social aspect. If we are to believe a certain ancient sage, we  are all in the world to solve a problem: as to Trespolo, he desired to  live without doing anything; that was his problem. He was, in turn, a  sacristan, a juggler, an apothecary's assistant, and a cicerone, and he  got tired of all these callings. Begging was, to his mind, too hard  work, and it was more trouble to be a thief than to be an honest man.  Finally he decided in favour of contemplative philosophy. He had a  passionate preference for the horizontal position, and found the  greatest pleasure in the world in watching the shooting of stars.  Unfortunately, in the course of his meditations this deserving man came  near to dying of hunger; which would have been a great pity, for he was  beginning to accustom himself not to eat anything. But as he was  predestined by nature to play a small part in our story, God showed him  grace for that time, and sent to his assistance--not one of His angels,  the rogue was not worthy of that, but--one of Brancaleone's hunting  dogs. The noble animal sniffed round the philosopher, and uttered a  little charitable growl that would have done credit to one of the  brethren of Mount St. Bernard. The prince, who was returning in triumph  from hunting, and who, by good luck, had that day killed a bear and  ruined a countess, had an odd inclination to do a good deed. He  approached the plebeian who was about to pass into the condition of a  corpse, stirred the thing with his foot, and seeing that there was still  a little hope, bade his people bring him along.    From that day onward, Trespolo saw the dream of his life nearly  realised. Something rather above a footman and rather below a house  steward, he became the confidant of his master, who found his talents  most useful; for this Trespolo was as sharp as a demon and almost as  artful as a woman. The prince, who, like an intelligent man as he was,  had divined that genius is naturally indolent, asked nothing of him but  advice; when tiresome people wanted thrashing, he saw to that matter  himself, and, indeed, he was the equal of any two at such work. As  nothing in this lower world, however, is complete, Trespolo had strange  moments amid this life of delights; from time to time his happiness was  disturbed by panics that greatly diverted his master; he would mutter  incoherent words, stifle violent sighs, and lose his appetite. The root  of the matter was that the poor fellow was afraid of going to hell. The  matter was very simple: he was afraid of everything; and, besides, it  had often been preached to him that the Devil never allowed a moment's  rest to those who were ill-advised enough to fall into his clutches.  Trespolo was in one of his good moods of repentance, when the prince,  after gazing on the young girl with the fierce eagerness of a vulture  about to swoop upon its prey, turned to speak to his intimate adviser.  The poor servant understood his master's abominable design, and not  wishing to share the guilt of a sacrilegious conversation, opened his  eyes very wide and turned them up to heaven in ecstatic contemplation.  The prince coughed, stamped his foot, moved his sword so as to hit  Trespolo's legs, but could not get from him any sign of attention, so  absorbed did he appear in celestial thoughts. Brancaleone would have  liked to wring his neck, but both his hands were occupied by the staff  of the canopy; and besides, the king was present.    At last they were drawing nearer to the church of St. Clara, where the  Neapolitan kings were buried, and where several princesses of the blood,  exchanging the crown for the veil, have gone to bury themselves alive.  The nuns, novices, and abbess, hidden behind shutters, were throwing  flowers upon the procession. A bunch fell at the feet of the Prince of  Brancaleone.    \"Trespolo, pick up that nosegay,\" said the prince, so audibly that his  servant had no further excuse. \"It is from Sister Theresa,\" he added, in  a low voice; \"constancy is only to be found, nowadays, in a convent.\"    Trespolo picked up the nosegay and came towards his master, looking like  a man who was being strangled.    \"Who is that girl?\" the latter asked him shortly.    \"Which one?\" stammered the servant.    \"Forsooth! The one walking in front of us.\"    \"I don't know her, my lord.\"    \"You must find out something about her before this evening.\"    \"I shall have to go rather far afield.\"    \"Then you do know her, you intolerable rascal! I have half a mind to  have you hanged like a dog.\"    \"For pity's sake, my lord, think of the salvation of your soul, of your  eternal life.\"    \"I advise you to think of your temporal life. What is her name?\"    \"She is called Nisida, and is the prettiest girl in the island that she  is named after. She is innocence itself. Her father is only a poor  fisherman, but I can assure your excellency that in his island he is  respected like a king.\"    \"Indeed!\" replied the prince, with an ironical smile. \"I must own, to my  great shame, that I have never visited the little island of Nisida. You  will have a boat ready for me to-morrow, and then we will see.\"    He interrupted himself suddenly, for the king was looking at him; and  calling up the most sonorous bass notes that he could find in the depths  of his throat, he continued with an inspired air, \"Genitori genitoque  laus et jubilatio.\"    \"Amen,\" replied the serving-man in a ringing voice.    Nisida, the beloved daughter of Solomon, the fisherman, was, as we have  said, the loveliest flower of the island from which she derived her  name. That island is the most charming spot, the most delicious nook  with which we are acquainted; it is a basket of greenery set delicately  amid the pure and transparent waters of the gulf, a hill wooded with  orange trees and oleanders, and crowned at the summit by a marble  castle. All around extends the fairy-like prospect of that immense  amphitheatre, one of the mightiest wonders of creation. There lies  Naples, the voluptuous syren, reclining carelessly on the seashore;  there, Portici, Castellamare, and Sorrento, the very names of which  awaken in the imagination a thousand thoughts of poetry and love; there  are Pausilippo, Baiae, Puozzoli, and those vast plains, where the  ancients fancied their Elysium, sacred solitudes which one might suppose  peopled by the men of former days, where the earth echoes under foot  like an empty grave, and the air has unknown sounds and strange  melodies.    Solomon's hut stood in that part of the island which, turning its back  to the capital, beholds afar the blue crests of Capri. Nothing could be  simpler or brighter. The brick walls were hung with ivy greener than  emeralds, and enamelled with white bell-flowers; on the ground floor was  a fairly spacious apartment, in which the men slept and the family took  their meals; on the floor above was Nisida's little maidenly room, full  of coolness, shadows, and mystery, and lighted by a single casement that  looked over the gulf; above this room was a terrace of the Italian kind,  the four pillars of which were wreathed with vine branches, while its  vine-clad arbour and wide parapet were overgrown with moss and wild  flowers. A little hedge of hawthorn, which had been respected for ages,  made a kind of rampart around the fisherman's premises, and defended his  house better than deep moats and castellated walls could have done. The  boldest roisterers of the place would have preferred to fight before the  parsonage and in the precincts of the church rather than in front of  Solomon's little enclosure. Otherwise, this was the meeting place of the  whole island. Every evening, precisely at the same hour, the good women  of the neighbourhood came to knit their woollen caps and tell the news.  Groups of little children, naked, brown, and as mischievous as little  imps, sported about, rolling on the grass and throwing handfuls of sand  into the other's eyes, heedless of the risk of blinding, while their  mothers were engrossed in that grave gossip which marks the dwellers in  villages. These gatherings occurred daily before the fisherman's house;  they formed a tacit and almost involuntary homage, consecrated by  custom, and of which no one had ever taken special account; the envy  that rules in small communities would soon have suppressed them. The  influence which old Solomon had over his equals had grown so simply and  naturally, that no one found any fault with it, and it had only  attracted notice when everyone was benefiting by it, like those fine  trees whose growth is only observed when we profit by their shade. If  any dispute arose in the island, the two opponents preferred to abide by  the judgment of the fisherman instead of going before the court; he was  fortunate enough or clever enough to send away both parties satisfied.

Large temperature changes will not affect the speed of the clock.  A large number of the chronographs are in use and have given excellent  satisfaction.    [Illustration: A 702]    #A702. Prof. G. W. Hough's Printing Chronograph.# The instrument consists  of two carefully and accurately constructed clock movements, which are  driven by gravity and controlled electrically by the sidereal clock. The  movements revolve three type wheels. One of these turns once per second,  its edge is divided in 50 parts and it is driven by a separate movement.  The second wheel turns once per minute and the third once per hour and they  will print the seconds and minutes, while the first will give the  hundredths of seconds. A strip of paper is carried over these wheels and  moved forward by the same electro-magnet, which operates the printing  hammers. The paper is sufficiently long for 1200 observations including  spacing between records. The operation of the printing hammers is such that  the uniform motion of the type wheel is not disturbed in the act of  printing. The whole instrument is mounted on a heavy slate plate 45 cm. by  60 cm., and protected by a glass cover.    The manipulation of the apparatus is extremely simple and convenient and  the records obtained are perfectly reliable and accurate within about 0.01  of a second. The saving of time and labor by the printing chronograph is  very considerable and the filing of the records very convenient.
