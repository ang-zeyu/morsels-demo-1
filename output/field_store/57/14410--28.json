These all entered into Christ--the door, while those disciples who had  entered a good while before Pentecost were put into the offices of  apostles and prophets by the baptism of the spirit. No man should wait  to be _put_ into the open door, to be put into Christ, but should do as  all the disciples of Christ did in the days of Christ and of his  apostles--flee for refuge into an open door--not wait to be put in, but  enter. You can be saved in heaven without being put into the office of  an apostle or prophet, but you can not enter heaven without being  sanctified and cleansed. Will you come and enter by the Lord Jesus,  become a child of God by faith in Jesus Christ, being baptized into  Christ? Do you say this is not the way? Then, why? O, why should the  pages of this book of books be burthened with such things? Were those  disciples who received the baptism of repentance for the remission of  sins before Pentecost out of Christ--uncleansed--unwashed? No! They were  clean through the word spoken unto them. They were converted--pardoned.  Will you enter Christ, or wait to be put into Christ? Why is it that all  men are not put into Christ? I answer, men are not put into Christ, they  enter in--they come to Christ--they come to God--God is in Christ. The  spirit and the bride say, come! And let him that heareth say, Come! And  let him that is athirst come! And whosoever will let him take the water  of life freely.\"    \"Many of the Corinthians hearing believed and were baptized.\" \"When the  Samaritans believed, they were baptized, both men and women.\" This is  our entrance into the door. We have now just entered into the church of  Christ--into the family of God--it is God's house--we are at home in the  Father's house, and naught will harm us if we live at home, if we are  \"obedient children not fashioning ourselves after our former lusts.\" The  injunction comes to us here: \"Add to your faith virtue, to virtue  knowledge, to knowledge temperance, to temperance patience, to patience  brotherly kindness, to brotherly kindness godliness, and to godliness  charity, and if these things be in you and abound, they make you that ye  shall neither be barren nor unfruitful in the knowledge of our Lord and  Savior Jesus Christ. But he that lacketh these things is blind and can  not see afar off, and had forgotten that he was purged from his old  sins. Wherefore the rather, brethren, give diligence to make your  calling and election sure, for if ye do these things ye shall never  fall. For _so_ an entrance shall be ministered unto you abundantly into  the everlasting kingdom of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ.\" \"Blessed  are they that do his commandments, that they may have right to the tree  of life and enter through the gates into the city.\" Men in disobedience  to the gospel feel, when they approach the cold Jordan of death, that  every thing upon which they built their hopes is being swept away. Their  thoughts, their treasures, their grandeur, their honors, their little  world, their all, fails them here. They have lived at a distance from  God, and now they tremble at the thought of approaching before him whose  great mercy they have rejected. Death is a terror to sinful man--his  afflictions are his darkest hours. It is not so with the Christian. To  him death has no sting; over him the grave has no victory to boast, nor  has the second death any power. He has unshaken confidence that every  thing is safe in the hands of Jesus. What but obedience to the gospel of  the blessed God will enable the child of faith, when flesh and heart  fail to say, \"Thou wilt show me the path of life; in thy presence is  fullness of joy, and at thy right hand are pleasures forevermore.\" What  then must be the happiness of fixing the heart on God, where there is  nothing unlovely, nothing fickle, nothing false or dying. We may place  our affections on the things of earth, and sooner or later we are  severed from them. Here all is change, disappointment and consequent  sorrow. It is not so in Heaven where all, is pure and immutable. From  our best affections towards creatures up to the love of God there is a  height as lofty as his ways and attributes are above the attributes and  ways of mortals. No fear can haunt the mind that he may change in his  character of love. He is beyond the reach of accident or change, perfect  in goodness and power, and to those who trust in him, he is a sure and  never-ending, and ever-increasing source of joy. \"Blessed are all they  that put their trust in '_Emanuel_.'\" Their very sacrifices are more  than compensated. If we give up self it is for the love of God. If we  give up time it is for eternity, and in the exchange our happiness is  not diminished either here or hereafter.          OUR INDEBTEDNESS TO REVELATION.--No. V.    LANGUAGE AND RELIGION.    BY P.T. RUSSELL.      _Christian._ Having in my last article traced language and religion to  their necessary and only possible source, I am now ready to hear any  objections that may be entertained. Mr. Skeptic, if you have any,  present them.    _Skeptic._ Suppose that I admit all that you say, it would, in the  nature of the case, account for the origin of one language only, while  facts show that there are an unnumbered variety. So your argument is at  fault. The same difficulty belongs to your conclusion concerning the  origin of religion. Can you remove this difficulty?    _Christian._ Yes but while I am pleased with your frankness, I must say,  the difficulty is only apparent, not real. Look at yonder tree. There is  but one main stem, or trunk, and many leading branches. These principal  branches are each also divided into several minor branches, and these  also throw out many lesser limbs and twigs. So it is with languages. As  the smallest twig at the extreme end of either of those limbs can be  traced to the trunk through the main branches, so all the various  languages that are in use to-day, can and may be traced to a few older  ones, and these, again, to one principal or parent language. The English  language of the present time differs widely from the English of three or  four centuries ago. Its number of words have more than doubled. And this  has not been the result of the creation of new words, but of borrowing  from other and older languages. So extensively has this been carried on,  that Dr. Webster says, that in gathering and arranging material for his  dictionary, he found himself under the necessity of consulting thirty  European and Asiatic languages. Our language may be called an  amalgamation from a great many other languages. It is not an original  language. We, like the ancient Greeks, have been borrowing extensively,  and, like them, we have been careful to keep all that we borrowed. What  is true of our language is equally true of all modern languages.  Wherever there is commercial or other free intercourse, each party is  found borrowing words from the other, and thus their vocabularies are  lapping and continually increasing. _I am now ready to introduce the  important consideration_, it is this, all modern languages are shaded by  a few ancient ones. The English, German, French, Spanish, Italian, etc.,  are deeply shaded through borrowing from the Latin, Greek, Hebrew, and  ancient languages, while these last, as well as other ancient languages,  have never borrowed from the former. This shows that Greek, Latin and  Hebrew are older than the others. I shall now take for granted _that_  which all real linguists declare to be true, viz: that the smaller  number of languages from which we and our contemporaries have so freely  borrowed, are all shaded by their borrowings from one; and, as the  younger always borrows from the older, that one must of necessity be the  parent language of all languages. This conclusion accounts for the word  \"babel\" in our language, and its equivalent in all others, as well as  for the existence of a multitude of words too tedious to mention.      RELIGION AND ITS ORIGIN.    The word is from \"religo,\" and signifies _to bind over_. Webster says,  \"This word seems originally to have signified an oath or vow to the  gods, or an obligation of such oath or vow.\" Religion, in its  comprehensive sense, includes a belief in the being and perfections of  God, in the revelation of his will to man, in man's obligation to obey  his commands--any religion consisting in a belief of a supreme power or  powers, governing the world, and in the worshiping of such power or  powers. That men have the power to become religious is too evident to  require a word in argument; even Tyndal admitted that there was a place  in man's psychological nature for religion. Now, since man possesses  this, and as all his other powers and faculties were made for use, it is  but reasonable that this faculty should also have its proper sphere of  action.      TWO QUESTIONS.    They are these: First, was Polytheism or Monotheism the primitive  religion? Second, is religion human or Divine in its origin? In  answering these questions I shall gather facts, and from them deduce my  conclusion, after the inductive method. First, universal history and  tradition as far back as they can be traced, without one dissenting  voice, locate the"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/28678"],[0,"The Christian Foundation, Or, Scientific and Religious Journal, Volume I, No. (#2)"],[1," to convert a barren waste into a fruitful field; to convert a  wilderness into a garden; to convert rude savages into civilized men; to  change or turn from one party or sect to another--as to convert Pagans  to Christianity, to turn from a bad life to a good one, to change the  heart and moral character from enmity to God and from vicious habits to  the love of God and to a holy life.\" Hence the ancient commandment:  \"Make you a new heart and a new spirit, for why will you die.\" Eze.  xviii, 32. \"Thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thy heart, and  with all thy mind, and with all thy strength.\" Is this out of your  power? Then who is to blame? Does the blessed Father command you to do  what you can not? Are you thus lost without remedy? Does the Lord mock  you with commandments that you can not obey? The importance of  conversion is in the fact that it is the turning point or dividing line  between those who serve God and those who serve him not.    I. The Lord commands sinners to convert.    II. The Lord's commandments are duties that sinners owe to God.    Therefore, conversion is a duty that the sinner owes to God. It is the  sinner's duty; then he must perform it. We have seen that the Lord  commands it, and that sinners did perform it. Do you say it is a work  begun upon them and accomplished by them? Then sinners must be passive  in the beginning of this work, and the beginning is most essential, for  unless the thing is begun it will never be accomplished. Is this  beginning the work of God wrought upon the sinner by a special operation  of the Holy Spirit? If this be so it follows that the entire Christian  life is of necessity, and not of choice, for the root always bears the  tree, and not the tree the root. If the cause is the unconditioned power  of God, the effects growing out of that cause are the fruits of  necessity; and so the Christian is a necessitated creature, and entitled  to neither praise or reward, for it was not he that did it, _but God_.  And in this case the sinner is not a moral agent, for in moral agency  the sinner, with a knowledge of the right and the wrong, begins the work  _himself_ and does it himself. This does not exclude the instrumentality  of Christ, the Apostles, prophets and Christians, who, by the words of  the Holy Spirit, have placed before sinners all the knowledge necessary  to give them correct ideas of duty, and also the motives to be accepted.  An agent is one who has power to begin action, and moral agency in  conversion is the exercise of that power, with a knowledge of the right  and the wrong, and so it comes to pass that conversion to God always  makes a Christian, provided, however, that the man, knowing what to turn  from and what to turn to, honestly turned from the wrong to the right,  which is the same as to say that he was a moral agent in his conversion.  A man may _turn_ without a knowledge of the right and the wrong, but it  is turning _round_ and _round_ and remaining in the same place, _i.e._  in ignorance of God's will, and so remaining in disobedience. Such may  be and often is.    In all such cases the person has been the creature of passion, wrought  upon by excitement, and left in ignorance of duty in disobedience to the  gospel of Christ. A good rule by which to determine when such is the  case, and it is the Master's rule, is the unwillingness of the person to  do the commandments of God, and to receive for instruction upon the  subject of duty, his word, an unteachable disposition, which not only  refuses to obey when the commandments are presented, but absolutely  persists in opposing them. A man in this condition is worse than  ignorant, his heart is irreconciled to the government of God, and he may  turn around and around and die in sin and transgression. Do you object  that God controls in conversion, and, therefore, the man is illuminated  in a mysterious manner, and necessitated aright--that he is a  necessitated moral agent? Necessitated moral agency and free slavery are  identical. There is no such thing as necessitated moral agency. What I  am compelled to do is not mine, but his who compelled me. All that we  call moral or immoral, virtuous or vicious, praiseworthy or blameworthy,  in our conduct, depends wholly upon the will. It begins in us and is  done by us. It is ours and we will answer for it. No man is to be blamed  or praised for that which he neither had power to do or avoid. This, in  harmony with the words _agent_ and _action_, is saying no more than that  a man is to be praised or blamed for actions done by himself and not by  another. It is the gospel rule, \"that every man shall receive according  to that which he bath done; that every man shall give account of  _himself_ to God.\"    If the sinner is to blame for remaining in an unconverted state, then of  necessity conversion is his own voluntary act; a duty imperatively  enjoined upon him, in the performance of which he needs to be guided by  the knowledge of the right and the wrong, as much as in any other duty.  On the other hand, if it is a work wrought upon the man by a special  effort of the Holy Spirit, then the man is free from all responsibility  in the premises, for he will answer only for his _own work_.    \"Keep thy heart with all diligence, for out of it are the issues of  life.\" Prov. iv, 23. \"He taught me also, and said unto me: Let thine  heart retain my words; keep my commandments and live.\" Prov. iv, 4.  \"Hear thou, my son, and be wise, and guide thine heart in the way.\"  Prov. xxiii, 19.      \"Man, with naught in charge, could betray no trust,    And if he fell, would fall because he must.    If love reward him, or vengeance strike,    His recompense in both would be unjust _alike_.\"    If the sinner is passive in his conversion he can claim no reward, for  it is the act of another. All action is the work of an agent, of a being  who acts. And every being who acts is the beginner of the motion which  constitutes the action. The bullet that kills the man, the explosion  that makes it fly, the sparkles from the cap which produce the  explosion, are not agents, all being equally passive; nor is it the  finger operating upon the trigger that begins the motion; that also is a  passive instrument; it is the mind giving to the finger direction and  energy which is the mover in this business, and as such, is, properly  speaking, the agent. But if we were super-naturally informed that the  mind thus exerted was made to do so by the mysterious and irresistible  impulse of a superior being, we should instantly declare _that being_  the agent, and the mind irresistibly influenced only a passive  instrument, and no more to blame than the gunpowder. Now, if the sinner  is passive he is no more to blame or praise than the passive instruments  employed by the murderer. And if he is not passive, but active, then the  thing is begun and done by himself _as the real agent_. Action implies  motion, and where there is no power to begin motion there can not be  action, _but rest_. If the sinner has power to begin that action called  conversion, then he is a moral agent in his conversion, provided that he  begins it with a knowledge of the right and the wrong in their relations  to the subject, for action without knowledge of duty is not conversion  to the service of God. In this case the moral element is wanting, the  man acts blindly from impulse or passion; which is no more than saying  that men must know what to _convert from_, and what to _convert to_,  before they can act intelligently as rational moral agents. As such, the  thing of first importance is to teach men the will of God upon the  subject of conversion, that they may know what to do. Anciently men were  told what to do. And the gospel of Christ tells men the same story yet.  If the sinner is the agent in his conversion then he should give himself  no rest until he learns his duty and does it. But if he is not, then he  might just as well rest contented, for the passive stone that has no  power to change its place _must rest_. To say that the sinner has the  power to change is giving up the question. And when this is once given  up all good people will go to work upon sinners to teach them their  duty, and persuade them to turn, convert, to God. And the Lord will no  longer be regarded by sensible skeptics as a very changeable being.    The ancient Christians did not wrestle with God in the work of saving  sinners. He was always willing that men should be saved, and is yet  willing. If we were to wrestle with him in solemn prayer all our days he  would not be more willing than he is at this moment.    Why is it that _all men_ are not _saved_? Ans.--The Lord commands men to  convert, turn and live. Turn from what? Ans.--From the will of the flesh  and from the will of man. To what? Ans.--To the gospel of Christ. And  they refuse to do it. To say the sinner has not the power is to relieve  him, forever, of all responsibility for his continuance in an  unconverted state, and throw it, forever, upon God. To say the sinner  has not the power, and in the next breath tell him that he has, is a  square contradiction and a self-evident falsehood, only equaled by the  statement that a thing is a round square, or that ice is red hot. Let  whatever fall that may, it is true that a thing can not _be_, _exist_,  and _not_ be, not _exist_, at the same time. The sinner is either  passive or active in his conversion. He can not be both. If he has not  the power to begin and _convert_, it follows that all who have died in  sin were fated to ruin without remedy. Philosophers have said, \"that the  will is determined by motives, purposes, intentions, or reasons.\"  Granting this to be true, we _can not_ admit that the will is  _necessarily_ determined by motives and purposes; for it is the  self-determining power of the mind that gives a motive, or reason, that  weight and influence whereby our course is"]]]
