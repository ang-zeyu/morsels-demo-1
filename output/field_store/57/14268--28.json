It would be monstrous if it  were not so. For the only education given in this country is through the  English language. The fact, however, is that the results are not all  proportionate to the time we give to our education. We have not reacted  on the masses. But I must not anticipate Dr. Mehta. He is in earnest. He  writes feelingly. He has examined the pros and cons and collected a mass  of evidence in support of his arguments. The latest pronouncement on the  subject is that of the Viceroy. Whilst His Excellency is unable to offer  a solution, he is keenly alive to the necessity of imparting instruction  in our schools through the vernaculars. The Jews of Middle and Eastern  Europe, who are scattered in all parts of the world, finding it  necessary to have a common tongue for mutual intercourse, have raised  Yiddish to the status of a language, and have succeeded in translating  into Yiddish the best books to be found in the world's literature. Even  they could not satisfy the soul's yearning through the many foreign  tongues of which they are masters; nor did the learned few among them  wish to tax the masses of the Jewish population with having to learn a  foreign language before they could realise their dignity. So they have  enriched what was at one time looked upon as a mere jargon--but what the  Jewish children learnt from their mothers--by taking special pains to  translate into it the best thought of the world. This is a truly  marvellous work. It has been done during the present generation, and  Webster's Dictionary defines it as a polyglot jargon used for  inter-communication by Jews from different nations.    But a Jew of Middle and Eastern Europe would feel insulted if his mother  tongue were now so described. If these Jewish scholars have succeeded,  within a generation, in giving their masses a language of which they may  feel proud, surely it should be an easy task for us to supply the needs  of our own vernaculars which are cultured languages. South Africa  teaches us the same lesson. There was a duel there between the Taal, a  corrupt form of Dutch, and English. The Boer mothers and the Boer  fathers were determined that they would not let their children, with  whom they in their infancy talked in the Taal, be weighed down with  having to receive instruction through English. The case for English here  was a strong one. It had able pleaders for it. But English had to yield  before Boer patriotism. It may be observed that they rejected even the  High Dutch. The school masters, therefore, who are accustomed to speak  the published Dutch of Europe, are compelled to teach the easier Taal.  And literature of an excellent character is at the present moment  growing up in South Africa in the Taal, which was only a few years ago,  the common medium of speech between simple but brave rustics. If we have  lost faith in our vernaculars, it is a sign of want of faith in  ourselves; it is the surest sign of decay. And no scheme of  self-government, however benevolently or generously it may be bestowed  upon us, will ever make us a self-governing nation, if we have no  respect for the languages our mothers speak.    FOOTNOTE:    [2] Introduction to Dr. Mehta's \"Self-Government Series\".          SWADESHI[3]      It was not without great diffidence that I undertook to speak to you at  all. And I was hard put to it in the selection of my subject. I have  chosen a very delicate and difficult subject. It is delicate because of  the peculiar views I hold upon Swadeshi, and it is difficult because I  have not that command of language which is necessary for giving adequate  expression to my thoughts. I know that I may rely upon your indulgence  for the many shortcomings you will no doubt find in my address, the more  so when I tell you that there is nothing in what I am about to say that  I am not either already practising or am not preparing to practise to  the best of my ability. It encourages me to observe that last month you  devoted a week to prayer in the place of an address. I have earnestly  prayed that what I am about to say may bear fruit and I know that you  will bless my word with a similar prayer.    After much thinking I have arrived at a definition of Swadeshi that,  perhaps, best illustrates my meaning. Swadeshi is that spirit in us  which restricts us to the use and service of our immediate surroundings  to the exclusion of the more remote. Thus, as for religion, in order to  satisfy the requirements of the definition, I must restrict myself to my  ancestral religion. That is the use of my immediate religious  surrounding. If I find it defective, I should serve it by purging it of  its defects. In the domain of politics I should make use of the  indigenous institutions and serve them by curing them of their proved  defects. In that of economics I should use only things that are produced  by my immediate neighbours and serve those industries by making them  efficient and complete where they might be found wanting. It is  suggested that such Swadeshi, if reduced to practice, will lead to the  millennium. And, as we do not abandon our pursuit after the millennium,  because we do not expect quite to reach it within our times, so may we  not abandon Swadeshi even though it may not be fully attained for  generations to come.    Let us briefly examine the three branches of Swadeshi as sketched above.  Hinduism has become a conservative religion and, therefore, a mighty  force because of the Swadeshi spirit underlying it. It is the most  tolerant because it is non-proselytising, and it is as capable of  expansion today as it has been found to be in the past. It has succeeded  not in driving out, as I think it has been erroneously held, but in  absorbing Buddhism. By reason of the Swadeshi spirit, a Hindu refuses to  change his religion, not necessarily because he considers it to be the  best, but because he knows that he can complement it by introducing  reforms. And what I have said about Hinduism is, I suppose, true of the  other great faiths of the world, only it is held that it is specially so  in the case of Hinduism. But here comes the point I am labouring to  reach. If there is any substance in what I have said, will not the great  missionary bodies of India, to whom she owes a deep debt of gratitude  for what they have done and are doing, do still better and serve the  spirit of Christianity better by dropping the goal of proselytising  while continuing their philanthropic work? I hope you will not consider  this to be an impertinence on my part. I make the suggestion in all  sincerity and with due humility. Moreover I have some claim upon your  attention. I have endeavoured to study the Bible. I consider it as part  of my scriptures. The spirit of the Sermon on the Mount competes almost  on equal terms with the Bhagavad Gita for the domination of my heart. I  yield to no Christian in the strength of devotion with which I sing  \"Lead kindly light\" and several other inspired hymns of a similar  nature. I have come under the influence of noted Christian missionaries  belonging to different denominations. And enjoy to this day the  privilege of friendship with some of them. You will perhaps, therefore,  allow that I have offered the above suggestion not as a biased Hindu,  but as a humble and impartial student of religion with great leanings  towards Christianity. May it not be that \"Go ye unto all the world\"  message has been somewhat narrowly interpreted and the spirit of it  missed? It will not be denied, I speak from experience, that many of the  conversions are only so-called. In some cases the appeal has gone not to  the heart but to the stomach. And in every case a conversion leaves a  sore behind it which, I venture to think, is avoidable. Quoting again  from experience, a new birth, a change of heart, is perfectly possible  in every one of the great faiths. I know I am now treading upon thin  ice. But I do not apologise in closing this part of my subject, for  saying that the frightful outrage that is just going on in Europe,  perhaps shows that the message of Jesus of Nazareth, the Son of Peace,  had been little understood in Europe, and that light upon it may have to  be thrown from the East.    I have sought your help in religious matters, which it is yours to give  in a special sense. But I make bold to seek it even in political  matters. I do not believe that religion has nothing to do with politics.  The latter divorced from religion is like a corpse only fit to be  buried. As a matter of fact, in your own silent manner, you influence  politics not a little. And I feel that, if the attempt to separate  politics from religion had not been made as it is even now made, they  would not have degenerated as they often appear to have done. No one  considers that the political life of the country is in a happy state.  Following out the Swadeshi spirit, I observe the indigenous institutions  and the village panchayats hold me. India is really a republican  country, and it is because it is that, that it has survived every shock  hitherto delivered. Princes and potentates, whether they were Indian  born or foreigners, have hardly touched the vast masses except for  collecting revenue. The latter in their turn seem to have rendered unto  Caesar what was Caesar's and for the rest have done much as they have  liked. The vast organisation of caste answered not only the religious  wants of the community, but it answered to its political needs. The  villagers managed their internal affairs through the caste system, and  through it they dealt with any oppression from the ruling power or  powers. It is not possible to deny of a nation that was capable of  producing the caste system its wonderful power of organisation.

And he  underwent another religious experience: he read Paley's Evidences. 'I  took in the whole argument,' wrote Manning, when he was over seventy,  'and I thank God that nothing has ever shaken it.' Yet on the whole he  led the unspiritual life of an ordinary schoolboy. We have glimpses of  him as a handsome lad, playing cricket, or strutting about in tasselled  Hessian top-boots. And on one occasion at least he gave proof of a  certain dexterity of conduct which deserved to be remembered. He went  out of bounds, and a master, riding by and seeing him on the other side  of a field, tied his horse to a gate, and ran after him. The astute  youth outran the master, fetched a circle, reached the gate, jumped on  to the horse's back and rode off. For this he was very properly  chastised; but, of what use was chastisement? No whipping, however  severe, could have eradicated from little Henry's mind a quality at  least as firmly planted in it as his fear of Hell and his belief in the  arguments of Paley.    It had been his father's wish that Manning should go into the Church;  but the thought disgusted him; and when he reached Oxford, his tastes,  his ambitions, his successes at the Union, all seemed to mark him out  for a political career. He was a year junior to Samuel Wilberforce, and  a year senior to Gladstone. In those days the Union was the  recruiting-ground for young politicians; Ministers came down from London  to listen to the debates; and a few years later the Duke of Newcastle  gave Gladstone a pocket borough on the strength of his speech at the  Union against the Reform Bill. To those three young men, indeed, the  whole world lay open. Were they not rich, well-connected, and endowed  with an infinite capacity for making speeches? The event justified the  highest expectations of their friends; for the least distinguished of  the three died a bishop. The only danger lay in another direction.    'Watch, my dear Samuel,' wrote the elder Wilberforce to his son, 'watch  with jealousy whether you find yourself unduly solicitous about  acquitting yourself; whether you are too much chagrined when you fail,  or are puffed up by your success. Undue solicitude about popular  estimation is a weakness against which all real Christians must guard  with the utmost jealous watchfulness. The more you can retain the  impression of your being surrounded by a cloud of witnesses of the  invisible world, to use the scripture phrase, the more you will be armed  against this besetting sin.'    But suddenly it seemed as if such a warning could, after all, have very  little relevance to Manning; for, on his leaving Oxford, the brimming  cup was dashed from his lips. He was already beginning to dream of  himself in the House of Commons, the solitary advocate of some great  cause whose triumph was to be eventually brought about by his  extraordinary efforts, when his father was declared a bankrupt, and all  his hopes of a political career came to an end forever.    It was at this time that Manning became intimate with a pious lady, the  sister of one of his College friends, whom he used to describe as his  Spiritual Mother. He made her his confidante; and one day, as they  walked together in the shrubbery, he revealed the bitterness of the  disappointment into which his father's failure had plunged him. She  tried to cheer him, and then she added that there were higher aims open  to him which he had not considered. 'What do you mean?' he asked. 'The  kingdom of Heaven,' she answered; 'heavenly ambitions are not closed  against you.' The young man listened, was silent, and said at last that  he did not know but she was right. She suggested reading the Bible  together; and they accordingly did so during the whole of that Vacation,  every morning after breakfast. Yet, in spite of these devotional  exercises, and in spite of a voluminous correspondence on religious  subjects with his Spiritual Mother, Manning still continued to indulge  in secular hopes. He entered the Colonial Office as a supernumerary  clerk, and it was only when the offer of a Merton Fellowship seemed to  depend upon his taking orders that his heavenly ambitions began to  assume a definite shape. Just then he fell in love with Miss Deffell,  whose father would have nothing to say to a young man without prospects,  and forbade him the house. It was only too true; what WERE the prospects  of a supernumerary clerk in the Colonial Office? Manning went to Oxford  and took orders. He was elected to the Merton Fellowship, and obtained  through the influence of the Wilberforces a curacy in Sussex. At the  last moment he almost drew back. 'I think the whole step has been too  precipitate,' he wrote to his brother-in-law. 'I have rather allowed the  instance of my friends, and the allurements of an agreeable curacy in  many respects, to get the better of my sober judgment.' His vast  ambitions, his dreams of public service, of honours, and of power, was  all this to end in a little country curacy 'agreeable in many respects'?  But there was nothing for it; the deed was done; and the Fates had  apparently succeeded very effectively in getting rid of Manning. All he  could do was to make the best of a bad business.    Accordingly, in the first place, he decided that he had received a call  from God 'ad veritatem et ad seipsum'; and, in the second, forgetting  Miss Deffell, he married his rector's daughter. Within a few months the  rector died, and Manning stepped into his shoes; and at least it could  be said that the shoes were not uncomfortable. For the next seven years  he fulfilled the functions of a country clergyman. He was energetic and  devout; he was polite and handsome; his fame grew in the diocese. At  last he began to be spoken of as the probable successor to the old  Archdeacon of Chichester. When Mrs. Manning prematurely died, he was at  first inconsolable, but he found relief in the distraction of redoubled  work. How could he have guessed that one day he would come to number  that loss among 'God's special mercies? Yet so it was to be. In after  years, the memory of his wife seemed to be blotted from his mind; he  never spoke of her; every letter, every record, of his married life he  destroyed; and when word was sent to him that her grave was falling into  ruin: 'It is best so,' the Cardinal answered, 'let it be. Time effaces  all things.' But, when the grave was yet fresh, the young Rector would  sit beside it, day after day, writing his sermons.      II    IN the meantime, a series of events was taking place in another part of  England, which was to have a no less profound effect upon Manning's  history than the merciful removal of his wife. In the same year in which  he took up his Sussex curacy, the Tracts for the Times had begun to  appear at Oxford. The 'Oxford Movement', in fact, had started on its  course. The phrase is still familiar; but its meaning has become  somewhat obscured both by the lapse of time and the intrinsic ambiguity  of the subjects connected with it. Let us borrow for a moment the wings  of Historic Imagination, and, hovering lightly over the Oxford of the  thirties, take a rapid bird's-eye view.    For many generations the Church of England had slept the sleep of the  ...comfortable. The sullen murmurings of dissent, the loud battle-cry of  Revolution, had hardly disturbed her slumbers. Portly divines subscribed  with a sigh or a smile to the Thirty-nine Articles, sank quietly into  easy living, rode gaily to hounds of a morning as gentlemen should, and,  as gentlemen should, carried their two bottles of an evening. To be in  the Church was in fact simply to pursue one of those professions which  Nature and Society had decided were proper to gentlemen and gentlemen  alone. The fervours of piety, the zeal of Apostolic charity, the  enthusiasm of self-renunciation--these things were all very well in  their way and in their place; but their place was certainly not the  Church of England. Gentlemen were neither fervid nor zealous, and above  all they were not enthusiastic. There were, it was true, occasionally to  be found within the Church some strait-laced parsons of the high Tory  school who looked back with regret to the days of Laud or talked of the  Apostolical Succession; and there were groups of square-toed  Evangelicals who were earnest over the Atonement, confessed to a  personal love of Jesus Christ, and seemed to have arranged the whole of  their lives, down to the minutest details of act and speech, with  reference to Eternity. But such extremes were the rare exceptions. The  great bulk of the clergy walked calmly along the smooth road of ordinary  duty. They kept an eye on the poor of the parish, and they conducted the  Sunday Services in a becoming manner; for the rest, they differed  neither outwardly nor inwardly from the great bulk of the laity, to whom  the Church was a useful organisation for the maintenance of Religion, as  by law established.    The awakening came at last, however, and it was a rude one. The liberal  principles of the French Revolution, checked at first in the terrors of  reaction, began to make their way into England. Rationalists lifted up  their heads; Bentham and the Mills propounded Utilitarianism; the Reform  Bill was passed; and there were rumours abroad of disestablishment. Even  Churchmen seemed to have caught the infection. Dr. Whately was so bold  as to assert that, in the interpretation of Scripture, different  opinions might be permitted upon matters of doubt; and, Dr. Arnold drew  up a disquieting scheme for allowing Dissenters into the Church, though  it is true that he did not go quite so far as to contemplate the  admission of Unitarians.    At this time, there was living in a country parish, a young clergyman of  the name of John Keble. He had gone to Oxford at the age of fifteen,  where, after a successful academic"]]]
