The present condition of practical bee-keeping in this country, is known  to be deplorably low. From the great mass of agriculturists, and others  favorably situated for obtaining honey, it receives not the slightest  attention. Notwithstanding the large number of patent hives which have  been introduced, the ravages of the bee-moth have increased, and success  is becoming more and more precarious. Multitudes have abandoned the  pursuit in disgust, while many of the most experienced, are fast  settling down into the conviction that all the so-called \"Improved  Hives\" are delusions, and that they must return to the simple box or  hollow log, and \"_take up_\" their bees with sulphur, in the  old-fashioned way.    In the present state of public opinion, it requires no little courage to  venture upon the introduction of a new hive and system of management;  but I feel confident that a _new era_ in bee-keeping has arrived, and  invite the attention of all interested, to the reasons for this belief.  A perusal of this Manual, will, I trust, convince them that there is a  better way than any with which they have yet been acquainted. They will  here find many hitherto mysterious points in the physiology of the  honey-bee, clearly explained, and much valuable information never before  communicated to the public.    It is now nearly fifteen years since I first turned my attention to the  cultivation of bees. The state of my health having compelled me to live  more and more in the open air, I have devoted a large portion of my  time, of late years, to a careful investigation of their habits, and to  a series of minute and thorough experiments in the construction of  hives, and the best methods of managing them, so as to secure the  largest practical results.    Very early in my Apiarian studies, I procured an imported copy of the  work of the celebrated Huber, and constructed a hive on his plan, which  furnished me with favorable opportunities of verifying some of his most  valuable discoveries; and I soon found that the prejudices existing  against him, were entirely unfounded. Believing that his discoveries  laid the foundation for a more extended and profitable system of  bee-keeping, I began to experiment with hives of various construction.    The result of all these investigations fell far short of my  expectations. I became, however, most thoroughly convinced that no hives  were fit to be used, unless they furnished _uncommon protection_ against  _extremes_ of _heat_ and more especially of COLD. I accordingly  discarded all thin hives made of inch stuff, and constructed my hives of  _doubled_ materials, enclosing a \"dead air\" space all around.    These hives, although more expensive in the first cost, proved to be  much cheaper in the end, than those I had previously used. The bees  _wintered_ remarkably well in them, and swarmed _early_ and with unusual  _regularity_. My next step in advance, was, while I secured my surplus  honey in the most convenient, beautiful and salable forms, so to  facilitate the entrance of the bees into the honey receptacles, as to  secure the largest fruits from their labors.    Although I felt confident that my hive possessed some valuable  peculiarities, I still found myself unable to remedy many of the  casualties to which bee-keeping is liable. I now perceived that no hive  could be made to answer my expectations unless it gave me the _complete  control of the combs_, so that I might remove any, or all of them at  pleasure. The use of the Huber hive had convinced me that with proper  precautions, the combs might be removed without _enraging_ the bees, and  that these insects were capable of being domesticated or _tamed_, to a  most surprising degree. A knowledge of these facts was absolutely  necessary to the further progress of my invention, for without it, I  should have regarded a hive designed to allow of the removal of the  combs, as too dangerous in use, to be of any practical value. At first,  I used movable slats or bars placed on rabbets in the front and back of  the hive. The bees were induced to build their combs upon these bars,  and in carrying them down, to fasten them to the sides of the hive. By  severing the attachments to the sides, I was able, at any time, to  remove the combs suspended from the bars. There was nothing _new_ in the  use of movable _bars_; the invention being probably, at least, a hundred  years old; and I had myself used such hives on Bevan's plan, very early  in the commencement of my experiments. The chief peculiarity in my  hives, as now constructed, was the facility with which these bars could  be removed without enraging the bees, and their combination with my new  mode of obtaining the surplus honey.    With hives of this construction I commenced experimenting on a larger  scale than ever, and soon arrived at results which proved to be of the  very first importance. I found myself able, if I wished it, to _dispense  entirely_ with _natural swarming_, and yet to multiply colonies with  much greater _rapidity_ and _certainty_ than by the common methods. I  could, in a _short time, strengthen my feeble colonies_, and furnish  those which had _lost their Queen_ with the means of _obtaining  another_. If I suspected that any thing was the matter with a hive, I  could _ascertain_ its _true condition_, by making a thorough examination  of every part, and if the _worms had gained a lodgment_, I could quickly  _dispossess_ them. In short, I could perform all the operations which  will be explained in this treatise, and I now believed that bee-keeping  could be made _highly profitable_, and as much a matter of _certainty_,  as any other branch of rural economy.    I perceived, however, that one thing was _yet_ wanting. The _cutting_ of  the combs from their attachments to the _sides_ of the hive, in order to  remove them, was attended with much loss of _time_ to myself and to the  bees, and in order to _facilitate_ this operation, the construction of  my hive was necessarily _complicated_. This led me to invent a method by  which the combs were attached to MOVABLE FRAMES, and suspended in the  hives, _so as to touch neither the top, bottom, nor sides_. By this  device, I was able to remove the combs at pleasure, and if desired, I  could speedily transfer them, bees and all, _without any cutting_, to  another hive. I have experimented largely with hives of this  construction, and find that they answer most admirably, all the ends  proposed in their invention.    While experimenting in the summer of 1851, with some observing hives of  a peculiar construction, I discovered that bees could be made to work in  glass hives, _exposed to the full light of day_. The notice, in a  Philadelphia newspaper, of this discovery, procured me the pleasure of  an acquaintance with Rev. Dr. Berg, pastor of a Dutch Reformed church in  that city. From him, I first learned that a Prussian clergyman, of the  name of Dzierzon, (pronounced Tseertsone,) had attracted the attention  of crowned heads, by his important discoveries in the management of  bees. Before he communicated the particulars of these discoveries, I  explained to Dr. Berg, my system of management, and showed him my hive.  He expressed the greatest astonishment at the wonderful similarity in  our methods of management, both of us having carried on our  investigations without the slightest knowledge of each other's labors.  Our hives, he found to differ in some very important respects. In the  Dzierzon hive, the combs are not attached to _movable frames_, but to  _bars_, so that they cannot, _without cutting_, be removed from the  hive. In my hive, which is opened _from the top_, any comb may be taken  out, without at all disturbing the others; whereas, in the Dzierzon  hive, which is opened from one of the ends, it is often necessary to  _cut_ and _remove many_ combs, in order to get access to a particular  one; thus, if the _tenth_ comb from the end is to be removed, _nine_  combs must be first _cut and taken out_. All this consumes a large  amount of time. The German hive does not furnish the surplus honey in a  form which would be found most salable in our markets, or which would  admit of safe transportation in the comb. Notwithstanding these  disadvantages, it has achieved a _great triumph_ in Germany, and given a  _new impulse_ to the cultivation of bees.    The following letter from Samuel Wagner, Esq., cashier of the bank in  York, Pennsylvania, will show the results which have been obtained in  Germany, by the new system of management, and his estimate of the  superior value of my hive to those in use there.                                          YORK, PA., DEC. 24, 1852.      DEAR SIR,    The Dzierzon theory and the system of bee-management based thereon, were  originally promulgated, _hypothetically_, in the \"Eichstadt  Bienenzeitung\" or Bee-journal, in 1845, and at once"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/24586"],[0,"The Story of My Life (#2)"],[1,"every public question which was discussed, and every prominent  event which took place in Upper Canada from 1825 to 1875-78.    Public men of the present day looked upon Dr. Ryerson practically as one  of their own contemporaries--noted for his zeal and energy in the  successful management of a great Public Department, and as the founder  of a system of Popular Education which, in his hands, became the pride  and glory of Canadians, and was to those beyond the Dominion, an ideal  system--the leading features of which they would gladly see incorporated  in their own. In this estimate of Dr. Ryerson's labours they were quite  correct. And in their appreciation of the statesmanlike qualities of  mind, which devised and developed such a system in the midst of  difficulties which would have appalled less resolute hearts, they were  equally correct.    But, after all, how immeasurably does this partial view of his character  and labours fall short of a true estimate of that character and of those  labours!    As a matter of fact, Dr. Ryerson's great struggle for the civil and  religious freedom which we now enjoy, was almost over when he assumed  the position of Chief Director of our Educational System. No one can  read the record of his labours from 1825 to 1845, as detailed in the  following pages, without being impressed with the fact that, had he done  no more for his native country than that which is therein recorded, he  would have accomplished a great work, and have earned the gratitude of  his fellow-countrymen.    It was my good fortune to enjoy Dr. Ryerson's warm, personal friendship  since 1841. It has also been my distinguished privilege to be associated  with him in the accomplishment of his great educational work since 1844.  I have been able, therefore, to turn my own personal knowledge of most  of the events outlined in this volume to account in its preparation. In  regard to what transpired before 1841, I have frequently heard many  narratives in varied forms from Dr. Ryerson's lips.    My own intimate relations with Dr. Ryerson, and the character of our  close personal friendship are sufficiently indicated in his private  letters to me, published in various parts of the book, but especially in  Chapter liii. And yet they fail to convey the depth and sincerity of his  personal attachment, and the feeling of entire trust and confidence  which existed between us.    I am glad to say that I was not alone in this respect. Dr. Ryerson had  the faculty, so rare in official life, of attaching his assistants and  subordinates of every grade to himself personally. He always had a  pleasant word for them, and made them feel that their interests were  safe in his hands. They therefore respected and trusted him fully, and  he never failed to acknowledge their fidelity and devotion in the public  service.    I had, for some time before he ceased to be the Head of the Education  Department, looked forward with pain and anxiety to that inevitable  event. Pain, that he and I were at length to be separated in the  carrying forward of the great work of our lives, in which it had been my  pride and pleasure to be his principal assistant. Anxiety at what, from  my knowledge of him, I feared would be the effect of release from the  work on fully accomplishing which he had so earnestly set his heart. Nor  were my fears groundless. To a man of his application and ardent  temperament, the feeling that his work was done sensibly affected him.  He lost a good deal of his elasticity, and during the last few years of  his life, very perceptibly failed.    The day on which he took official leave of the Department was indeed a  memorable one. As he bade farewell to each of his assistants in the  office, he and they were deeply moved. He could not, however, bring  himself to utter a word to me at our official parting, but as soon as he  reached home he wrote to me the following tender and loving note:--         171 Victoria Street, Toronto,         Monday Evening, February 21st, 1876.         My Dear Hodgins,--I felt too deeply to-day when parting with you in       the Office to be able to say a word. I was quite overcome with the       thought of severing our official connection, which has existed       between us for thirty-two years, during the whole of which time,       without interruption, we have laboured as one mind and heart in two       bodies, and I believe with a single eye to promote the best       interests of our country, irrespective of religious sect or       political party--to devise, develop, and mature a system of       instruction which embraces and provides for every child in the land       a good education; good teachers to teach; good inspectors to       oversee the Schools; good maps, globes, and text-books; good books       to read; and every provision whereby Municipal Councils and       Trustees can provide suitable accommodation, teachers, and       facilities for imparting education and knowledge to the rising       generation of the land.         While I devoted the year 1845 to visiting educating countries and       investigating their system of instruction, in order to devise one       for our country, you devoted the same time in Dublin in mastering,       under the special auspices of the Board of Education there, the       several different branches of their Education Office, in       administering the system of National Education in Ireland, so that       in the details of our Education Office here, as well as in our       general school system, we have been enabled to build up the most       extensive establishment in the country, leaving nothing, as far as       I know, to be devised in the completeness of its arrangements, and       in the good character and efficiency of its officers. Whatever       credit or satisfaction may attach to the accomplishment of this       work, I feel that you are entitled to share equally with myself.       Could I have believed that I might have been of any service to you,       or to others with whom I have laboured so cordially, or that I       could have advanced the school system, I would not have voluntarily       retired from office. But all circumstances considered, and entering       within a few days upon my 74th year, I have felt that this was the       time for me to commit to other hands the reins of the government of       the public school system, and labour during the last hours of my       day and life, in a more retired sphere.         But my heart is, and ever will be, with you in its sympathies and       prayers, and neither you nor yours will more truly rejoice in your       success and happiness, than         Your old life-long Friend         And Fellow-labourer,         E. Ryerson.    Dr. Ryerson was confessedly a man of great intellectual resources. Those  who read what he has written on the question--perilous to any writer in  the early days of the history of this Province--of equal civil and  religious rights for the people of Upper Canada, will be impressed with  the fact that he had thoroughly mastered the great principles of civil  and religious liberty, and expounded them not only with courage, but  with clearness and force. His papers on the clergy reserve question, and  the rights of the Canadian Parliament in the matter, were statesmanlike  and exhaustive.    His exposition of a proposed system of education for his native country  was both philosophical and eminently practical. As a Christian Minister,  he was possessed of rare gifts, both in the pulpit and on the platform;  while his warm sympathies and his deep religious experience, made him  not only a \"son of consolation,\" but a beloved and welcome visitor in  the homes of the sorrowing and the afflicted. Among his brethren he  exercised great personal influence; and in the counsels of the  Conference he occupied a trusted and foremost place.    Thus we see that Dr. Ryerson's character was a many-sided one; while his  talents were remarkably versatile. He was an able writer on public  affairs; a noted Wesleyan Minister, and a successful and skilful leader  among his brethren. But his fame in the future will mainly rest upon the  fact that he was a distinguished Canadian Educationist, and the Founder  of a great system of Public Education for Upper Canada. What makes this  widely conceded excellence in his case the more marked, was the fact  that the soil on which he had to labour was unprepared, and the social  condition of the country was unpropitious. English ideas of schools for  the poor, supported by subscriptions and voluntary offerings, prevailed  in Upper Canada; free schools were unknown; the very principle on which  they rest--that is, that the rateable property of the country is  responsible for the education of the youth of the land--was denounced as  communistic, and an invasion of the rights of property; while  \"compulsory education\"--the proper and necessary complement of free  schools--was equally denounced as the essence of \"Prussian despotism,\"  and an impertinent and unjustifiable interference with \"the rights of  British subjects.\"    It was a reasonable boast at the time that only systems of popular  education, based upon the principle of free schools, were possible in  the republican American States, where the wide diffusion of education  was regarded as a prime necessity for the stability and success of  republican institutions, and, therefore, was fostered with unceasing  care. It was the theme on which the popular orator loved to dilate to a  people on whose sympathies with the subject he could always confidently  reckon. The practical mind of Dr. Ryerson, however, at once saw that the  American idea of free schools was the true one. He moreover perceived  that by giving his countrymen facilities for freely discussing the  question among the ratepayers once a year, they would educate themselves  into the idea, without any interference from"]]]
