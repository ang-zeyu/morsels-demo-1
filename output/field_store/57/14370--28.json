Gregory uttered another shriek,  and Ivan counted \"Two.\" The blood now began to colour the skin.    At the third stroke several drops of blood appeared; at the fourth the  blood spurted out; at the fifth some drops spattered the young officer's  face; he drew back, and wiped them away with his handkerchief. Ivan  profited by his distraction, and counted seven instead of six: the  captain took no notice. At the ninth stroke Ivan stopped to change the  lash, and in the hope that a second fraud might pass off as luckily as  the first, he counted eleven instead of ten.    At that moment a window opposite to Vaninka's opened, and a man about  forty-five or fifty in general's uniform appeared. He called out in a  careless tone, \"Enough, that will do,\" and closed the window again.    Immediately on this apparition the young aide-de-camp had turned towards  his general, saluting, and during the few seconds that the general was  present he remained motionless. When the window had been shut again, he  repeated the general's words, so that the raised whip fell without  touching the culprit.    \"Thank his excellency, Gregory,\" said Ivan, rolling the knout's lash  round his hand, \"for having spared you two strokes;\" and he added,  bending down to liberate Gregory's hand, \"these two with the two I was  able to miss out make a total of eight strokes instead of twelve. Come,  now, you others, untie his other hand.\"    But poor Gregory was in no state to thank anybody; nearly swooning with  pain, he could scarcely stand.    Two moujiks took him by the arms and led him towards the serfs'  quarters, followed by Ivan. Having reached the door, however, Gregory  stopped, turned his head, and seeing the aide-de-camp gazing pitifully  at him, \"Oh sir,\" he cried, \"please thank his excellency the general for  me. As for the lady Vaninka,\" he added in a low tone, \"I will certainly  thank her myself.\"    \"What are you muttering between your teeth?\" cried the young officer,  with an angry movement; for he thought he had detected a threatening  tone in Gregory's voice.    \"Nothing, sir, nothing,\" said Ivan. \"The poor fellow is merely thanking  you, Mr. Foedor, for the trouble you have taken in being present at his  punishment, and he says that he has been much honoured, that is all.\"    \"That is right,\" said the young man, suspecting that Ivan had somewhat  altered the original remarks, but evidently not wishing to be better  informed. \"If Gregory wishes to spare me this trouble another time, let  him drink less vodka; or else, if he must get drunk, let him at least  remember to be more respectful.\"    Ivan bowed low and followed his comrades, Foedor entered the house  again, and the crowd dispersed, much dissatisfied that Ivan's trickery  and the general's generosity had deprived them of four strokes of the  knout--exactly a third of the punishment.    Now that we have introduced our readers to some of the characters in  this history, we must make them better acquainted with those who have  made their appearance, and must introduce those who are still behind the  curtain.    General Count Tchermayloff, as we have said, after having been governor  of one of the most important towns in the environs of Pultava, had been  recalled to St. Petersburg by the Emperor Paul, who honoured him with  his particular friendship. The general was a widower, with one daughter,  who had inherited her mother's fortune, beauty, and pride. Vaninka's  mother claimed descent from one of the chieftains of the Tartar race,  who had invaded Russia, under the leadership of D'Gengis, in the  thirteenth century. Vaninka's naturally haughty disposition had been  fostered by the education she had received. His wife being dead, and not  having time to look after his daughter's education himself, General  Tchermayloff had procured an English governess for her. This lady,  instead of suppressing her pupil's scornful propensities, had encouraged  them, by filling her head with those aristocratic ideas which have made  the English aristocracy the proudest in the world. Amongst the different  studies to which Vaninka devoted herself, there was one in which she was  specially interested, and that one was, if one may so call it, the  science of her own rank. She knew exactly the relative degree of  nobility and power of all the Russian noble families--those that were a  grade above her own, and those of whom she took precedence. She could  give each person the title which belonged to their respective rank, no  easy thing to do in Russia, and she had the greatest contempt for all  those who were below the rank of excellency. As for serfs and slaves,  for her they did not exist: they were mere bearded animals, far below  her horse or her dog in the sentiments which they inspired in her; and  she would not for one instant have weighed the life of a serf against  either of those interesting animals.    Like all the women of distinction in her nation, Vaninka was a good  musician, and spoke French, Italian, German, and English equally well.    Her features had developed in harmony with her character. Vaninka was  beautiful, but her beauty was perhaps a little too decided. Her large  black eyes, straight nose, and lips curling scornfully at the corners,  impressed those who saw her for the first time somewhat unpleasantly.  This impression soon wore off with her superiors and equals, to whom she  became merely an ordinary charming woman, whilst to subalterns and such  like she remained haughty and inaccessible as a goddess. At seventeen  Vaninka's education was finished, and her governess who had suffered in  health through the severe climate of St. Petersburg, requested  permission to leave. This desire was granted with the ostentatious  recognition of which the Russian nobility are the last representatives  in Europe. Thus Vaninka was left alone, with nothing but her father's  blind adoration to direct her. She was his only daughter, as we have  mentioned, and he thought her absolutely perfect.    Things were in this state in the-general's house when he received a  letter, written on the deathbed of one of the friends of his youth.  Count Romayloff had been exiled to his estates, as a result of some  quarrel with Potemkin, and his career had been spoilt. Not being able to  recover his forfeited position, he had settled down about four hundred  leagues from St. Petersburg; broken-hearted, distressed probably less on  account of his own exile and misfortune than of the prospects of his  only son, Foedor. The count feeling that he was leaving this son alone  and friendless in the world, commended the young man, in the name of  their early friendship, to the general, hoping that, owing to his being  a favourite with Paul I, he would be able to procure a lieutenancy in a  regiment for him. The general immediately replied to the count that his  son should find a second father in himself; but when this comforting  message arrived, Romayloff was no more, and Foedor himself received the  letter and carried it back with him to the general, when he went to tell  him of his loss and to claim the promised protection. So great was the  general's despatch, that Paul I, at his request, granted the young man a  sub-lieutenancy in the Semonowskoi regiment, so that Foedor entered on  his duties the very next day after his arrival in St. Petersburg.    Although the young man had only passed through the general's house on  his way to the barracks, which were situated in the Litenoi quarter, he  had remained there long enough for him to have seen Vaninka, and she had  produced a great impression upon him. Foedor had arrived with his heart  full of primitive and noble feelings; his gratitude to his protector,  who had opened a career for him, was profound, and extended to all his  family. These feelings caused him perhaps to have an exaggerated idea of  the beauty of the young girl who was presented to him as a sister, and  who, in spite of this title, received him with the frigidity and hauteur  of a queen. Nevertheless, her appearance, in spite of her cool and  freezing manner, had left a lasting impression upon the young man's  heart, and his arrival in St. Petersburg had been marked by feelings  till then never experienced before in his life.    As for Vaninka, she had hardly noticed Foedor; for what was a young  sub-lieutenant, without fortune or prospects, to her? What she dreamed  of was some princely alliance, that would make her one of the most  powerful ladies in Russia, and unless he could realise some dream of the  Arabian Nights, Foedor could not offer her such a future.    Some time after this first interview, Foedor came to take leave of the  general. His regiment was to form part of a contingent that  Field-Marshal Souvarow was taking to Italy, and Foedor was about to die,  or show himself worthy of the noble patron who had helped him to a  career.    This time, whether on account of the elegant uniform that heightened  Foedor's natural good looks, or because his imminent departure, glowing  with hope and enthusiasm, lent a romantic interest to the young man,  Vaninka was astonished at the marvellous change in him, and deigned, at  her father's request, to give him her hand when he left. This was more  than Foedor had dared to hope. He dropped upon his knee, as though in  the presence of a queen, and took Vaninka's between his own trembling  hands, scarcely daring to touch it with his lips. Light though the kiss  had been, Vaninka started as though she had been burnt; she felt a  thrill run through her, and she blushed violently. She withdrew her hand  so quickly, that Foedor, fearing this adieu, respectful though it was,  had offended her, remained on his knees, and clasping his hands, raised  his eyes with such an expression of fear in them, that Vaninka,"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/2758"],[0,"Marquise De Ganges (#2)"],[1,"a  painter of the finest taste, around a well proportioned brow; her large,  well opened eyes were of the same hue as her hair, and shone with a soft  and piercing flame that rendered it impossible to gaze upon her  steadily; the smallness, the shape, the turn of her mouth, and, the  beauty of her teeth were incomparable; the position and the regular  proportion of her nose added to her beauty such an air of dignity, as  inspired a respect for her equal to the love that might be inspired by  her beauty; the rounded contour of her face, produced by a becoming  plumpness, exhibited all the vigour and freshness of health; to complete  her charms, her glances, the movements of her lips and of her head,  appeared to be guided by the graces; her shape corresponded to the  beauty of her face; lastly, her arms, her hands, her bearing, and her  gait were such that nothing further could be wished to complete the  agreeable presentment of a beautiful woman.\"    [Note: All her contemporaries, indeed, are in agreement as to her  marvellous beauty; here is a second portrait of the marquise, delineated  in a style and manner still more characteristic of that period:--    \"You will remember that she had a complexion smoother and finer than a  mirror, that her whiteness was so well commingled with the lively blood  as to produce an exact admixture never beheld elsewhere, and imparting  to her countenance the tenderest animation; her eyes and hair were  blacker than jet; her eyes, I say, of which the gaze could scarce, from  their excess of lustre, be supported, which have been celebrated as a  miracle of tenderness and sprightliness, which have given rise, a  thousand times, to the finest compliments of the day, and have been the  torment of many a rash man, must excuse me, if I do not pause longer to  praise them, in a letter; her mouth was the feature of her face which  compelled the most critical to avow that they had seen none of equal  perfection, and that, by its shape, its smallness, and its brilliance,  it might furnish a pattern for all those others whose sweetness and  charms had been so highly vaunted; her nose conformed to the fair  proportion of all her features; it was, that is to say, the finest in  the world; the whole shape of her face was perfectly round, and of so  charming a fullness that such an assemblage of beauties was never before  seen together. The expression of this head was one of unparalleled  sweetness and of a majesty which she softened rather by disposition than  by study; her figure was opulent, her speech agreeable, her step noble,  her demeanour easy, her temper sociable, her wit devoid of malice, and  founded upon great goodness of heart.\"]    It is easy to understand that a woman thus endowed could not, in a court  where gallantry was more pursued than in any other spot in the world,  escape the calumnies of rivals; such calumnies, however, never produced  any result, so correctly, even in the absence of her husband, did the  marquise contrive to conduct herself; her cold and serious conversation,  rather concise than lively, rather solid than brilliant, contrasted,  indeed, with the light turn, the capricious and fanciful expressions  employed by the wits of that time; the consequence was that those who  had failed to succeed with her, tried to spread a report that the  marquise was merely a beautiful idol, virtuous with the virtue of a  statue. But though such things might be said and repeated in the absence  of the marquise, from the moment that she appeared in a drawing-room,  from the moment that her beautiful eyes and sweet smile added their  indefinable expression to those brief, hurried, and sensible words that  fell from her lips, the most prejudiced came back to her and were forced  to own that God had never before created anything that so nearly touched  perfection.    She was thus in the enjoyment of a triumph that backbiters failed to  shake, and that scandal vainly sought to tarnish, when news came of the  wreck of the French galleys in Sicilian waters, and of the death of the  Marquis de Castellane, who was in command. The marquise on this  occasion, as usual, displayed the greatest piety and propriety: although  she had no very violent passion for her husband, with whom she had spent  scarcely one of the seven years during which their marriage had lasted,  on receipt of the news she went at once into retreat, going to live with  Madame d'Ampus, her mother-in-law, and ceasing not only to receive  visitors but also to go out.    Six months after the death of her husband, the marquise received letters  from her grandfather, M. Joannis de Nocheres, begging her to come and  finish her time of mourning at Avignon. Having been fatherless almost  from childhood, Mademoiselle de Chateaublanc had been brought up by this  good old man, whom she loved dearly; she hastened accordingly to accede  to his invitation, and prepared everything for her departure.    This was at the moment when la Voisin, still a young woman, and far from  having the reputation which she subsequently acquired, was yet beginning  to be talked of. Several friends of the Marquise de Castellane had been  to consult her, and had received strange predictions from her, some of  which, either through the art of her who framed them, or through some  odd concurrence of circumstances, had come true. The marquise could not  resist the curiosity with which various tales that she had heard of this  woman's powers had inspired her, and some days before setting out for  Avignon she made the visit which we have narrated. What answer she  received to her questions we have seen.    The marquise was not superstitious, yet this fatal prophecy impressed  itself upon her mind and left behind a deep trace, which neither the  pleasure of revisiting her native place, nor the affection of her  grandfather, nor the fresh admiration which she did not fail to receive,  could succeed in removing; indeed, this fresh admiration was a weariness  to the marquise, and before long she begged leave of her grandfather to  retire into a convent and to spend there the last three months of her  mourning.    It was in that place, and it was with the warmth of these poor  cloistered maidens, that she heard a man spoken of for the first time,  whose reputation for beauty, as a man, was equal to her own, as a woman.  This favourite of nature was the sieur de Lenide, Marquis de Ganges,  Baron of Languedoc, and governor of Saint-Andre, in the diocese of Uzes.  The marquise heard of him so often, and it was so frequently declared to  her that nature seemed to have formed them for each other, that she  began to allow admission to a very strong desire of seeing him.  Doubtless, the sieur de Lenide, stimulated by similar suggestions, had  conceived a great wish to meet the marquise; for, having got M. de  Nocheres who no doubt regretted her prolonged retreat--to entrust him  with a commission for his granddaughter, he came to the convent parlour  and asked for the fair recluse. She, although she had never seen him,  recognised him at the first glance; for having never seen so handsome a  cavalier as he who now presented himself before her, she thought this  could be no other than the Marquis de Ganges, of whom people had so  often spoken to her.    That which was to happen, happened: the Marquise de Castellane and the  Marquis de Ganges could not look upon each other without loving. Both  were young, the marquis was noble and in a good position, the marquise  was rich; everything in the match, therefore, seemed suitable: and  indeed it was deferred only for the space of time necessary to complete  the year of mourning, and the marriage was celebrated towards the  beginning of the year 1558. The marquis was twenty years of age, and the  marquise twenty-two.    The beginnings of this union were perfectly happy; the marquis was in  love for the first time, and the marquise did not remember ever to have  been in love. A son and a daughter came to complete their happiness. The  marquise had entirely forgotten the fatal prediction, or, if she  occasionally thought of it now, it was to wonder that she could ever  have believed in it. Such happiness is not of this world, and when by  chance it lingers here a while, it seems sent rather by the anger than  by the goodness of God. Better, indeed, would it be for him who  possesses and who loses it, never to have known it.    The Marquis de Ganges was the first to weary of this happy life. Little  by little he began to miss the pleasures of a young man; he began to  draw away from the marquise and to draw nearer to his former friends. On  her part, the marquise, who for the sake of wedded intimacy had  sacrificed her habits of social life, threw herself into society, where  new triumphs awaited her. These triumphs aroused the jealousy of the  marquis; but he was too much a man of his century to invite ridicule by  any manifestation; he shut his jealousy into his soul, and it emerged in  a different form on every different occasion. To words of love, so sweet  that they seemed the speech of angels, succeeded those bitter and biting  utterances that foretell approaching division. Before long, the marquis  and the marquise only saw each other at hours when they could not avoid  meeting; then, on the pretext of necessary journeys, and presently  without any pretext at all, the marquis would go away for three-quarters  of a year, and once more the marquise found herself widowed. Whatever  contemporary account one may consult, one finds them all agreeing to  declare that she was always the same--that is to say, full of patience,  calmness, and becoming behaviour--and it is rare to find such a  unanimity of opinion about a young and beautiful woman.    About this time the marquis, finding it unendurable to be alone with his  wife during the short spaces of time which he spent at home, invited his  two brothers, the chevalier"]]]
