Behind the Count and his companions rose the white glistening walls of  the Hotel Dieu, and farther off the tall tower of the newly-restored  Cathedral, the belfry of the Recollets, and the roofs of the ancient  College of the Jesuits. An avenue of old oaks and maples shaded the  walk, and in the branches of the trees a swarm of birds fluttered and  sang, as if in rivalry with the gay French talk and laughter of the  group of officers, who waited the return of the Governor from the  bastion where he stood, showing the glories of Quebec to his friend.    The walls of the city ran along the edge of the cliff upwards as they  approached the broad gallery and massive front of the Castle of St.  Louis, and ascending the green slope of the broad glacis, culminated in  the lofty citadel, where, streaming in the morning breeze, radiant  in the sunshine, and alone in the blue sky, waved the white banner  of France, the sight of which sent a thrill of joy and pride into the  hearts of her faithful subjects in the New World.    The broad bay lay before them, round as a shield, and glittering like  a mirror as the mist blew off its surface. Behind the sunny slopes of  Orleans, which the river encircled in its arms like a giant lover his  fair mistress, rose the bold, dark crests of the Laurentides, lifting  their bare summits far away along the course of the ancient river,  leaving imagination to wander over the wild scenery in their midst--the  woods, glens, and unknown lakes and rivers that lay hid far from human  ken, or known only to rude savages, wild as the beasts of chase they  hunted in those strange regions.    Across the broad valley of the St. Charles, covered with green fields  and ripening harvests, and dotted with quaint old homesteads, redolent  with memories of Normandy and Brittany, rose a long mountain ridge  covered with primeval woods, on the slope of which rose the glittering  spire of Charlebourg, once a dangerous outpost of civilization. The  pastoral Lairet was seen mingling its waters with the St. Charles in  a little bay that preserves the name of Jacques Cartier, who with his  hardy companions spent their first winter in Canada on this spot, the  guests of the hospitable Donacana, lord of Quebec and of all the lands  seen from its lofty cape.    Directly beneath the feet of the Governor, on a broad strip of land that  lay between the beach and the precipice, stood the many-gabled Palace  of the Intendant, the most magnificent structure in New France. Its long  front of eight hundred feet overlooked the royal terraces and gardens,  and beyond these the quays and magazines, where lay the ships of  Bordeaux, St. Malo, and Havre, unloading the merchandise and luxuries of  France in exchange for the more rude, but not less valuable, products of  the Colony.    Between the Palace and the Basse Ville the waves at high tide washed  over a shingly beach where there were already the beginnings of a  street. A few rude inns displayed the sign of the fleur-de-lis or the  imposing head of Louis XV. Round the doors of these inns in summer-time  might always be found groups of loquacious Breton and Norman sailors in  red caps and sashes, voyageurs and canoemen from the far West in half  Indian costume, drinking Gascon wine and Norman cider, or the still  more potent liquors filled with the fires of the Antilles. The Batture  kindled into life on the arrival of the fleet from home, and in the  evenings of summer, as the sun set behind the Cote a Bonhomme, the  natural magnetism of companionship drew the lasses of Quebec down to  the beach, where, amid old refrains of French ditties and the music of  violins and tambours de Basque, they danced on the green with the jovial  sailors who brought news from the old land beyond the Atlantic.    \"Pardon me, gentlemen, for keeping you waiting,\" said the Governor, as  he descended from the bastion and rejoined his suite. \"I am so proud of  our beautiful Quebec that I can scarcely stop showing off its charms  to my friend Herr Kalm, who knows so well how to appreciate them. But,\"  continued he, looking round admiringly on the bands of citizens  and habitans who were at work strengthening every weak point in the  fortifications, \"my brave Canadians are busy as beavers on their dam.  They are determined to keep the saucy English out of Quebec. They  deserve to have the beaver for their crest, industrious fellows that  they are! I am sorry I kept you waiting, however.\"    \"We can never count the moments lost which your Excellency gives to the  survey of our fair land,\" replied the Bishop, a grave, earnest-looking  man. \"Would that His Majesty himself could stand on these walls and see  with his own eyes, as you do, this splendid patrimony of the crown of  France. He would not dream of bartering it away in exchange for petty  ends and corners of Germany and Flanders, as is rumored, my Lord.\"    \"True words and good, my Lord Bishop,\" replied the Governor; \"the  retention of all Flanders now in the strong hands of the Marshal de Saxe  would be a poor compensation for the surrender of a glorious land like  this to the English.\"    Flying rumors of some such proposal on the part of France had reached  the Colony, with wild reports arising out of the endless chaffering  between the negotiators for peace, who had already assembled at Aix la  Chapelle. \"The fate of America will one day be decided here,\" continued  the Governor; \"I see it written upon this rock, 'Whoever rules Quebec  will sway the destinies of the continent.' May our noble France be wise,  and understand in time the signs of empire and of supremacy!\"    The Bishop looked upwards with a sigh. \"Our noble France has not yet  read those tokens, or she misunderstands them. Oh, these faithful  subjects of hers! Look at them, your Excellency.\" The Bishop pointed  toward the crowd of citizens hard at work on the walls. \"There is not  a man of them but is ready to risk life and fortune for the honor and  dominion of France, and yet they are treated by the Court with such  neglect, and burdened with exactions that take from life the sweet  reward of labor! They cannot do the impossible that France requires of  them--fight her battles, till her fields, and see their bread taken from  them by these new ordinances of the Intendant.\"    \"Well, my Lord,\" replied the Governor, affecting a jocularity he did not  feel, for he knew how true were the words of the Bishop, \"we must all  do our duty, nevertheless: if France requires impossibilities of us, we  must perform them! That is the old spirit! If the skies fall upon our  heads, we must, like true Gauls, hold them up on the points of our  lances! What say you, Rigaud de Vaudreuil? Cannot one Canadian surround  ten New Englanders?\" The Governor alluded to an exploit of the gallant  officer whom he turned to address.    \"Probatum est, your Excellency! I once with six hundred Canadians  surrounded all New England. Prayers were put up in all the churches of  Boston for deliverance when we swept the Connecticut from end to end  with a broom of fire.\"    \"Brave Rigaud! France has too few like you!\" remarked the Governor with  a look of admiration.    Rigaud bowed, and shook his head modestly. \"I trust she has ten thousand  better;\" but added, pointing at his fellow-officers who stood conversing  at a short distance, \"Marshal de Saxe has few the equals of these in his  camp, my Lord Count!\" And well was the compliment deserved: they were  gallant men, intelligent in looks, polished in manners, and brave to a  fault, and all full of that natural gaiety that sits so gracefully on a  French soldier.    Most of them wore the laced coat and waistcoat, chapeau, boots, lace  ruffles, sash, and rapier of the period--a martial costume befitting  brave and handsome men. Their names were household words in every  cottage in New France, and many of them as frequently spoken of in the  English Colonies as in the streets of Quebec.    There stood the Chevalier de Beaujeu, a gentleman of Norman family, who  was already famed upon the frontier, and who, seven years later, in the  forests of the Monongahela, crowned a life of honor by a soldier's death  on the bloody field won from the unfortunate Braddock, defeating an army  ten times more numerous than his own.    Talking gayly with De Beaujeu were two gallant-looking young men of  a Canadian family which, out of seven brothers, lost six slain in the  service of their King--Jumonville de Villiers, who was afterwards, in  defiance of a flag of truce, shot down by order of Colonel Washington,  in the far-off forests of the Alleghenies, and his brother, Coulon  de Villiers, who received the sword of Washington when he surrendered  himself and garrison prisoners of war, at Fort Necessity, in 1754.    Coulon de Villiers imposed ignominious conditions of surrender upon  Washington, but scorned to take other revenge for the death of his  brother. He spared the life of Washington, who lived to become the  leader and idol of his nation, which, but for the magnanimity of the  noble Canadian, might have never struggled into independence.    There stood also the Sieur de Lery, the King's engineer, charged with  the fortification of the Colony, a man of Vauban's genius in the art of  defence. Had the schemes which he projected, and vainly urged upon the  heedless Court of Versailles, been carried into effect, the conquest of  New France would have been an impossibility.    Arm in arm with De Lery, in earnest conversation, walked the handsome  Claude de Beauharnais,--brother of a former Governor of the Colony,--a  graceful, gallant-looking soldier.

He was apprenticed to a second-hand furniture dealer  down the road, but he had his meals at home, and he was naturally  annoyed to find no dinner ready.    But, when he heard of the loss of the crystal, he forgot his meal, and  his anger was diverted from his mother to his step-father. Their first  idea, of course, was that he had hidden it. But Mr. Cave stoutly denied  all knowledge of its fate--freely offering his bedabbled affidavit in  the matter--and at last was worked up to the point of accusing, first,  his wife and then his step-son of having taken it with a view to a  private sale. So began an exceedingly acrimonious and emotional  discussion, which ended for Mrs. Cave in a peculiar nervous condition  midway between hysterics and amuck, and caused the step-son to be  half-an-hour late at the furniture establishment in the afternoon. Mr.  Cave took refuge from his wife's emotions in the shop.    In the evening the matter was resumed, with less passion and in a  judicial spirit, under the presidency of the step-daughter. The supper  passed unhappily and culminated in a painful scene. Mr. Cave gave way at  last to extreme exasperation, and went out banging the front door  violently. The rest of the family, having discussed him with the freedom  his absence warranted, hunted the house from garret to cellar, hoping to  light upon the crystal.    The next day the two customers called again. They were received by Mrs.  Cave almost in tears. It transpired that no one _could_ imagine all  that she had stood from Cave at various times in her married  pilgrimage.... She also gave a garbled account of the disappearance. The  clergyman and the Oriental laughed silently at one another, and said it  was very extraordinary. As Mrs. Cave seemed disposed to give them the  complete history of her life they made to leave the shop. Thereupon Mrs.  Cave, still clinging to hope, asked for the clergyman's address, so  that, if she could get anything out of Cave, she might communicate it.  The address was duly given, but apparently was afterwards mislaid. Mrs.  Cave can remember nothing about it.    In the evening of that day, the Caves seem to have exhausted their  emotions, and Mr. Cave, who had been out in the afternoon, supped in a  gloomy isolation that contrasted pleasantly with the impassioned  controversy of the previous days. For some time matters were very badly  strained in the Cave household, but neither crystal nor customer  reappeared.    Now, without mincing the matter, we must admit that Mr. Cave was a liar.  He knew perfectly well where the crystal was. It was in the rooms of Mr.  Jacoby Wace, Assistant Demonstrator at St. Catherine's Hospital,  Westbourne Street. It stood on the sideboard partially covered by a  black velvet cloth, and beside a decanter of American whisky. It is from  Mr. Wace, indeed, that the particulars upon which this narrative is  based were derived. Cave had taken off the thing to the hospital hidden  in the dog-fish sack, and there had pressed the young investigator to  keep it for him. Mr. Wace was a little dubious at first. His  relationship to Cave was peculiar. He had a taste for singular  characters, and he had more than once invited the old man to smoke and  drink in his rooms, and to unfold his rather amusing views of life in  general and of his wife in particular. Mr. Wace had encountered Mrs.  Cave, too, on occasions when Mr. Cave was not at home to attend to him.  He knew the constant interference to which Cave was subjected, and  having weighed the story judicially, he decided to give the crystal a  refuge. Mr. Cave promised to explain the reasons for his remarkable  affection for the crystal more fully on a later occasion, but he spoke  distinctly of seeing visions therein. He called on Mr. Wace the same  evening.    He told a complicated story. The crystal he said had come into his  possession with other oddments at the forced sale of another curiosity  dealer's effects, and not knowing what its value might be, he had  ticketed it at ten shillings. It had hung upon his hands at that price  for some months, and he was thinking of \"reducing the figure,\" when he  made a singular discovery.    At that time his health was very bad--and it must be borne in mind that,  throughout all this experience, his physical condition was one of  ebb--and he was in considerable distress by reason of the negligence,  the positive ill-treatment even, he received from his wife and  step-children. His wife was vain, extravagant, unfeeling, and had a  growing taste for private drinking; his step-daughter was mean and  over-reaching; and his step-son had conceived a violent dislike for him,  and lost no chance of showing it. The requirements of his business  pressed heavily upon him, and Mr. Wace does not think that he was  altogether free from occasional intemperance. He had begun life in a  comfortable position, he was a man of fair education, and he suffered,  for weeks at a stretch, from melancholia and insomnia. Afraid to disturb  his family, he would slip quietly from his wife's side, when his  thoughts became intolerable, and wander about the house. And about  three o'clock one morning, late in August, chance directed him into the  shop.    The dirty little place was impenetrably black except in one spot, where  he perceived an unusual glow of light. Approaching this, he discovered  it to be the crystal egg, which was standing on the corner of the  counter towards the window. A thin ray smote through a crack in the  shutters, impinged upon the object, and seemed as it were to fill its  entire interior.    It occurred to Mr. Cave that this was not in accordance with the laws of  optics as he had known them in his younger days. He could understand the  rays being refracted by the crystal and coming to a focus in its  interior, but this diffusion jarred with his physical conceptions. He  approached the crystal nearly, peering into it and round it, with a  transient revival of the scientific curiosity that in his youth had  determined his choice of a calling. He was surprised to find the light  not steady, but writhing within the substance of the egg, as though that  object was a hollow sphere of some luminous vapour. In moving about to  get different points of view, he suddenly found that he had come between  it and the ray, and that the crystal none the less remained luminous.  Greatly astonished, he lifted it out of the light ray and carried it to  the darkest part of the shop. It remained bright for some four or five  minutes, when it slowly faded and went out. He placed it in the thin  streak of daylight, and its luminousness was almost immediately  restored.    So far, at least, Mr. Wace was able to verify the remarkable story of  Mr. Cave. He has himself repeatedly held this crystal in a ray of light  (which had to be of a less diameter than one millimetre). And in a  perfect darkness, such as could be produced by velvet wrapping, the  crystal did undoubtedly appear very faintly phosphorescent. It would  seem, however, that the luminousness was of some exceptional sort, and  not equally visible to all eyes; for Mr. Harbinger--whose name will be  familiar to the scientific reader in connection with the Pasteur  Institute--was quite unable to see any light whatever. And Mr. Wace's  own capacity for its appreciation was out of comparison inferior to that  of Mr. Cave's. Even with Mr. Cave the power varied very considerably:  his vision was most vivid during states of extreme weakness and fatigue.    Now, from the outset this light in the crystal exercised a curious  fascination upon Mr. Cave. And it says more for his loneliness of soul  than a volume of pathetic writing could do, that he told no human being  of his curious observations. He seems to have been living in such an  atmosphere of petty spite that to admit the existence of a pleasure  would have been to risk the loss of it. He found that as the dawn  advanced, and the amount of diffused light increased, the crystal became  to all appearance non-luminous. And for some time he was unable to see  anything in it, except at night-time, in dark corners of the shop.    But the use of an old velvet cloth, which he used as a background for a  collection of minerals, occurred to him, and by doubling this, and  putting it over his head and hands, he was able to get a sight of the  luminous movement within the crystal even in the daytime. He was very  cautious lest he should be thus discovered by his wife, and he practised  this occupation only in the afternoons, while she was asleep upstairs,  and then circumspectly in a hollow under the counter. And one day,  turning the crystal about in his hands, he saw something. It came and  went like a flash, but it gave him the impression that the object had  for a moment opened to him the view of a wide and spacious and strange  country; and, turning it about, he did, just as the light faded, see  the same vision again.    Now, it would be tedious and unnecessary to state all the phases of Mr.  Cave's discovery from this point. Suffice that the effect was this: the  crystal, being peered into at an angle of about 137 degrees from the  direction of the illuminating ray, gave a clear and consistent picture  of a wide and peculiar countryside. It was not dream-like at all: it  produced a definite impression of reality, and the better the light the  more real and solid it seemed. It was a moving picture: that is to say,  certain objects moved in it, but slowly in an orderly manner like real  things, and, according as the direction of the lighting and vision  changed, the picture changed also. It must, indeed, have been like  looking through an oval glass at a view, "]]]
