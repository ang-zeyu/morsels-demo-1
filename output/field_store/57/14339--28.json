To  experiment is to employ unknown remedies of unknown virtues and  properties.    In this treatise I am not attempting to fix the indications for this  or that product, but simply make known the diseases in which the  Filipinos and the natives of other countries employ the products. Any  physician has a perfect right to prescribe these drugs, as have also  the \"curanderos\" and even the laity, with this difference, however,  that the physician is capable of observing results and guiding  himself by the physiologic action of the drugs. His knowledge of  the physiologic and anatomo-pathologic problems of the human body,  will enable the physician to make scientific inferences that would  be hidden from the common \"curandero.\"    As neither the Manila nor the provincial physicians keep these  medicinal plants in stock, with the exception of those that are  official in the European and American pharmacopoeias, it will be  necessary for the physician who wishes to use them, to busy himself  with seeking them and laying in a sufficient stock to serve him when  the opportunity presents itself. It is necessary to preserve them by  drying and this is best done by exposing them several days to the fresh  air in a dry place--for example, the corridors of the house--being  careful not to expose them to the rays of the sun, in which latter  event the fleshy and juicy plants which do not desiccate rapidly,  putrefy or ferment.    A convenient way to get them is to visit the Binondo Square where there  has been market for native drugs from time immemorial. The gardeners  from the neighboring towns, especially those from Pasay and Singalon,  regularly offer the plants for sale and will undertake to supply you  with any that may not be on hand. Inasmuch as the common names of the  plants lead to many mistakes and much confusion, it is indispensable to  acquaint one's self with the description of the plant and be sure that  the actual product conforms in all respects to the description. For  this purpose it is well to obtain flowering specimens, and bearing  this fact in mind I have been careful to indicate the flowering  season of each plant. By making excursions to the towns of San Mateo  and Angono I have obtained an abundance of whatever I sought and  at the same time have learned by talking with the mountaineers and  \"curanderos,\" what uses they make of their plants. The \"curanderos\"  know a great deal concerning these uses, but become very reticent  as soon as they are questioned about them. Whether it is dread of  ridicule or selfishness or fear that silences them, the fact remains  that it is no easy matter to glean any useful facts from them. And  yet by tact and friendliness one may elicit much more information  from them than first impressions would lead one to hope.    Leaves should be gathered when fully developed, rejecting the old,  dried and worm-eaten ones.    The best time to gather bark is one month before the period of  inflorescence, when it is rich in sap. The flowers are best gathered  when about half expanded. The fruit is gathered green or ripe according  to the active principle sought. The seeds should always be mature.    Not all parts of the plant are equally provided with the active  principle which may be localized in the root or the flower; or distinct  principles may exist in different parts of the same plant. Therefore  the part indicated, and only that part, should be employed.    In the root the active substance usually resides in the bark, sometimes  in the parenchyma that envelopes the woody tissue and rarely in the  woody tissue itself, as, for example, in \"rhubarb\" and \"pareira brava.\"    The stem bark is also a frequent seat of the active principle, of  which the outer portion contains the greater amount, according to  the valuable experiments of Howard.    Some plants owe their therapeutic importance to their wood, others to  their leaves or flowers, and regarding the localization of the active  principle in these parts we have nothing especial to indicate. The  fruit, however, may have a pericarp consisting of mucilage, starch,  sugar and gum, etc., while the seeds contain fatty matter, fixed or  essential oils or alkaloids, as is the case with coffee and cacao. In  view of these facts, we repeat that it is indispensable to use that  part of each plant which I have indicated as applicable to a determined  case or condition.    I earnestly hope that the physicians and pharmacists practising in  the Philippines may undertake investigations and experiments regarding  the therapeutic properties of the plants of my native land, and that  my endeavors may have acted as a stimulus or inspiration to the loyal  and earnest study of the subjects that are now awakening such interest,  not only in Europe and America, but in India and Japan.    I should be pleased to receive notes, plants or reports of researches  from any one interested in the subject matter of this book, and I  shall consider it a pleasure, as well as a duty, to devote my forces,  small as they may be, to aiding any one who may do me the honor to  claim my assistance.

She hastened after her cousin, who had already disappeared through the  curtains--curtains which smote one in the face, and seemed heavy with  more than cloth. Beyond them stood the unreliable Signora, bowing  good-evening to her guests, and supported by 'Enery, her little boy, and  Victorier, her daughter. It made a curious little scene, this attempt  of the Cockney to convey the grace and geniality of the South. And even  more curious was the drawing-room, which attempted to rival the solid  comfort of a Bloomsbury boarding-house. Was this really Italy?    Miss Bartlett was already seated on a tightly stuffed arm-chair, which  had the colour and the contours of a tomato. She was talking to Mr.  Beebe, and as she spoke, her long narrow head drove backwards and  forwards, slowly, regularly, as though she were demolishing some  invisible obstacle. \"We are most grateful to you,\" she was saying.  \"The first evening means so much. When you arrived we were in for a  peculiarly mauvais quart d'heure.\"    He expressed his regret.    \"Do you, by any chance, know the name of an old man who sat opposite us  at dinner?\"    \"Emerson.\"    \"Is he a friend of yours?\"    \"We are friendly--as one is in pensions.\"    \"Then I will say no more.\"    He pressed her very slightly, and she said more.    \"I am, as it were,\" she concluded, \"the chaperon of my young cousin,  Lucy, and it would be a serious thing if I put her under an obligation  to people of whom we know nothing. His manner was somewhat unfortunate.  I hope I acted for the best.\"    \"You acted very naturally,\" said he. He seemed thoughtful, and after  a few moments added: \"All the same, I don't think much harm would have  come of accepting.\"    \"No harm, of course. But we could not be under an obligation.\"    \"He is rather a peculiar man.\" Again he hesitated, and then said gently:  \"I think he would not take advantage of your acceptance, nor expect you  to show gratitude. He has the merit--if it is one--of saying exactly  what he means. He has rooms he does not value, and he thinks you would  value them. He no more thought of putting you under an obligation than  he thought of being polite. It is so difficult--at least, I find it  difficult--to understand people who speak the truth.\"    Lucy was pleased, and said: \"I was hoping that he was nice; I do so  always hope that people will be nice.\"    \"I think he is; nice and tiresome. I differ from him on almost every  point of any importance, and so, I expect--I may say I hope--you will  differ. But his is a type one disagrees with rather than deplores. When  he first came here he not unnaturally put people's backs up. He has no  tact and no manners--I don't mean by that that he has bad manners--and  he will not keep his opinions to himself. We nearly complained about  him to our depressing Signora, but I am glad to say we thought better of  it.\"    \"Am I to conclude,\" said Miss Bartlett, \"that he is a Socialist?\"    Mr. Beebe accepted the convenient word, not without a slight twitching  of the lips.    \"And presumably he has brought up his son to be a Socialist, too?\"    \"I hardly know George, for he hasn't learnt to talk yet. He seems a nice  creature, and I think he has brains. Of course, he has all his father's  mannerisms, and it is quite possible that he, too, may be a Socialist.\"    \"Oh, you relieve me,\" said Miss Bartlett. \"So you think I ought to  have accepted their offer? You feel I have been narrow-minded and  suspicious?\"    \"Not at all,\" he answered; \"I never suggested that.\"    \"But ought I not to apologize, at all events, for my apparent rudeness?\"    He replied, with some irritation, that it would be quite unnecessary,  and got up from his seat to go to the smoking-room.    \"Was I a bore?\" said Miss Bartlett, as soon as he had disappeared. \"Why  didn't you talk, Lucy? He prefers young people, I'm sure. I do hope I  haven't monopolized him. I hoped you would have him all the evening, as  well as all dinner-time.\"    \"He is nice,\" exclaimed Lucy. \"Just what I remember. He seems to see  good in everyone. No one would take him for a clergyman.\"    \"My dear Lucia--\"    \"Well, you know what I mean. And you know how clergymen generally laugh;  Mr. Beebe laughs just like an ordinary man.\"    \"Funny girl! How you do remind me of your mother. I wonder if she will  approve of Mr. Beebe.\"    \"I'm sure she will; and so will Freddy.\"    \"I think everyone at Windy Corner will approve; it is the fashionable  world. I am used to Tunbridge Wells, where we are all hopelessly behind  the times.\"    \"Yes,\" said Lucy despondently.    There was a haze of disapproval in the air, but whether the disapproval  was of herself, or of Mr. Beebe, or of the fashionable world at Windy  Corner, or of the narrow world at Tunbridge Wells, she could not  determine. She tried to locate it, but as usual she blundered. Miss  Bartlett sedulously denied disapproving of any one, and added \"I am  afraid you are finding me a very depressing companion.\"    And the girl again thought: \"I must have been selfish or unkind; I must  be more careful. It is so dreadful for Charlotte, being poor.\"    Fortunately one of the little old ladies, who for some time had been  smiling very benignly, now approached and asked if she might be allowed  to sit where Mr. Beebe had sat. Permission granted, she began to chatter  gently about Italy, the plunge it had been to come there, the gratifying  success of the plunge, the improvement in her sister's health, the  necessity of closing the bed-room windows at night, and of thoroughly  emptying the water-bottles in the morning. She handled her subjects  agreeably, and they were, perhaps, more worthy of attention than  the high discourse upon Guelfs and Ghibellines which was proceeding  tempestuously at the other end of the room. It was a real catastrophe,  not a mere episode, that evening of hers at Venice, when she had found  in her bedroom something that is one worse than a flea, though one  better than something else.    \"But here you are as safe as in England. Signora Bertolini is so  English.\"    \"Yet our rooms smell,\" said poor Lucy. \"We dread going to bed.\"    \"Ah, then you look into the court.\" She sighed. \"If only Mr. Emerson was  more tactful! We were so sorry for you at dinner.\"    \"I think he was meaning to be kind.\"    \"Undoubtedly he was,\" said Miss Bartlett.    \"Mr. Beebe has just been scolding me for my suspicious nature. Of  course, I was holding back on my cousin's account.\"    \"Of course,\" said the little old lady; and they murmured that one could  not be too careful with a young girl.    Lucy tried to look demure, but could not help feeling a great fool. No  one was careful with her at home; or, at all events, she had not noticed  it.    \"About old Mr. Emerson--I hardly know. No, he is not tactful; yet, have  you ever noticed that there are people who do things which are most  indelicate, and yet at the same time--beautiful?\"    \"Beautiful?\" said Miss Bartlett, puzzled at the word. \"Are not beauty  and delicacy the same?\"    \"So one would have thought,\" said the other helplessly. \"But things are  so difficult, I sometimes think.\"    She proceeded no further into things, for Mr. Beebe reappeared, looking  extremely pleasant.    \"Miss Bartlett,\" he cried, \"it's all right about the rooms. I'm so glad.  Mr. Emerson was talking about it in the smoking-room, and knowing what  I did, I encouraged him to make the offer again. He has let me come and  ask you. He would be so pleased.\"    \"Oh, Charlotte,\" cried Lucy to her cousin, \"we must have the rooms now.  The old man is just as nice and kind as he can be.\"    Miss Bartlett was silent.    \"I fear,\" said Mr. Beebe, after a pause, \"that I have been officious. I  must apologize for my interference.\"    Gravely displeased, he turned to go. Not till then did Miss Bartlett  reply: \"My own wishes, dearest Lucy, are unimportant in comparison with  yours. It would be hard indeed if I stopped you doing as you liked at  Florence, when I am only here through your kindness. If you wish me to  turn these gentlemen out of their rooms, I will do it. Would you then,  Mr. Beebe, kindly tell Mr. Emerson that I accept his kind offer, and  then conduct him to me, in order that I may thank him personally?\"    She raised her voice as she spoke; it was heard all over the  drawing-room, and silenced the Guelfs and the Ghibellines. The  clergyman, inwardly cursing the female sex, bowed, and departed with her  message.    \"Remember, Lucy, I alone am implicated in this. I do not wish the  acceptance to come from you. Grant me that, at all events.\"    Mr. Beebe was back, saying rather nervously:    \"Mr. Emerson is engaged, but here is his son instead.\"    The young man gazed down on the three ladies, who felt seated on the  floor, so low were their chairs.    \"My father,\" he said, \"is in his bath, so you cannot thank him  personally. But any message given by you to me will be given by me to  him as soon as he comes out.\"    Miss Bartlett was unequal to the bath. All her barbed civilities came  forth wrong end first. Young Mr. Emerson scored a notable triumph to the  delight of Mr. Beebe and to the secret delight of Lucy.    \"Poor young man!\" said Miss Bartlett, as soon as he had gone.    \"How angry he is with his father about the rooms! It is all he can do to  keep polite.\"    \"In half an hour or so your rooms will be ready,\" said Mr. Beebe. Then  looking rather thoughtfully at the two cousins, he retired to his own  rooms, to write up his philosophic diary.    \"Oh, dear!\" breathed the little old lady, and shuddered as if all the  winds of heaven had entered the apartment. \"Gentlemen sometimes do not  realize--\" Her voice faded away, but Miss Bartlett seemed to understand  and a conversation developed, in which gentlemen who did not thoroughly  realize played a principal part. Lucy, not realizing either,"]]]
