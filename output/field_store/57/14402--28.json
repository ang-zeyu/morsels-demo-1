Dr.  DIBDINS BIBLIOMANIA, 1840.          [Illustration]    =The Bibliomania.=      MY DEAR SIR,    When the poetical Epistle of Dr. Ferriar, under the popular title of  \"THE BIBLIOMANIA,\" was announced for publication, I honestly confess  that, in common with many of my book-loving acquaintance, a strong  sensation of fear and of hope possessed me: of fear, that I might have  been accused, however indirectly, of having contributed towards the  increase of this Mania; and of hope, that the true object of  book-collecting, and literary pursuits, might have been fully and  fairly developed. The perusal of this elegant epistle dissipated alike  my fears and my hopes; for, instead of caustic verses, and satirical  notes,[3] I found a smooth, melodious, and persuasive panegyric;  unmixed, however, with any rules for the choice of books, or the  regulation of study.         [Footnote 3: There are, nevertheless, some satirical       allusions which one could have wished had been suppressed.       For instance:              He turns where PYBUS rears his atlas-head            Or MADOC'S mass conceals its veins of lead;         What has Mr. Pybus's gorgeous book in praise of the late       Russian Emperor Paul I. (which some have called the       chef-d'oeuvre of Bensley's press[A]) to do with Mr.       Southey's fine Poem of Madoc?--in which, if there are \"veins       of lead,\" there are not a few \"of silver and gold.\" Of the       extraordinary talents of Mr. Southey, the indefatigable       student in ancient lore, and especially in all that regards       Spanish Literature and Old English Romances, this is not the       place to make mention. His \"_Remains of Henry Kirk White_,\"       the sweetest specimen of modern biography, has sunk into       every heart, and received an eulogy from every tongue. Yet       is his own life              \"The more endearing song.\"         Dr. Ferriar's next satirical verses are levelled at Mr.       THOMAS HOPE.              \"The lettered fop now takes a larger scope,            With classic furniture, design'd by HOPE.            (HOPE, whom upholsterers eye with mute despair,            The doughty pedant of an elbow chair.\")         It has appeared to me that Mr. Hope's magnificent volume on       \"_Household Furniture_\" has been generally misunderstood,       and, in a few instances, criticised upon false       principles.--The first question is, does the _subject_ admit       of illustration? and if so, has Mr. Hope illustrated it       properly? I believe there is no canon of criticism which       forbids the treating of such a subject; and, while we are       amused with archaeological discussions on Roman tiles and       tesselated pavements, there seems to be no absurdity in       making the decorations of our sitting rooms, including       something more than the floor we walk upon, a subject at       least of temperate and classical disquisition. Suppose we       had found such a treatise in the volumes of Gronovius and       Montfaucon? (and are there not a few, apparently, as       unimportant and confined in these rich volumes of the       Treasures of Antiquity?) or suppose something similar to Mr.       Hope's work had been found among the ruins of Herculaneum?       Or, lastly, let us suppose the author had printed it only as       a _private_ book, to be circulated as a present! In each of       these instances, should we have heard the harsh censures       which have been thrown out against it? On the contrary, is       it not very probable that a wish might have been expressed       that \"so valuable a work ought to be made public.\"         Upon what principle, _a priori_, are we to ridicule and       condemn it? I know of none. We admit Vitruvius, Inigo Jones,       Gibbs, and Chambers, into our libraries: and why not Mr.       Hope's book? Is decoration to be confined only to the       exterior? and, if so, are works, which treat of these only,       to be read and applauded? Is the delicate bas-relief, and       beautifully carved column, to be thrust from the cabinet and       drawing room, to perish on the outside of a smoke-dried       portico? Or, is not _that_ the most deserving of       commendation which produces the most numerous and pleasing       associations of ideas? I recollect, when in company with the       excellent DR. JENNER,              ----[clarum et venerabile nomen            Gentibus, et multum nostrae quod proderat urbi]         and a half dozen more friends, we visited the splendid       "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/28553"],[0,"How it Works (#2)"],[1,"ement--The lever escapement--Compensated balance-wheels--Keyless  winding mechanism for watches--The hour hand  train.

WHAT IS STEAM?    If ice be heated above 32 deg. Fahrenheit, its molecules lose their  cohesion, and move freely round one another--the ice is turned into  water. Heat water above 212 deg. Fahrenheit, and the molecules exhibit a  violent mutual repulsion, and, like dormant bees revived by spring  sunshine, separate and dart to and fro. If confined in an air-tight  vessel, the molecules have their flights curtailed, and beat more and  more violently against their prison walls, so that every square inch of  the vessel is subjected to a rising pressure. We may compare the action  of the steam molecules to that of bullets fired from a machine-gun at a  plate mounted on a spring. The faster the bullets came, the greater  would be the continuous compression of the spring.      THE MECHANICAL ENERGY OF STEAM.    If steam is let into one end of a cylinder behind an air-tight but  freely-moving piston, it will bombard the walls of the cylinder and the  piston; and if the united push of the molecules on the one side of the  latter is greater than the resistance on the other side opposing its  motion, the piston must move. Having thus partly got their liberty, the  molecules become less active, and do not rush about so vigorously. The  pressure on the piston decreases as it moves. But if the piston were  driven back to its original position against the force of the steam, the  molecular activity--that is, pressure--would be restored. We are here  assuming that no heat has passed through the cylinder or piston and been  radiated into the air; for any loss of heat means loss of energy, since  heat _is_ energy.      THE BOILER.    The combustion of fuel in a furnace causes the walls of the furnace to  become _hot_, which means that the molecules of the substance forming  the walls are thrown into violent agitation. If the walls are what are  called \"good conductors\" of heat, they will transmit the agitation  through them to any surrounding substance. In the case of the ordinary  house stove this is the air, which itself is agitated, or grows warm. A  steam-boiler has the furnace walls surrounded by water, and its function  is to transmit molecular movement (heat, or energy) through the furnace  plates to the water until the point is reached when steam generates. At  atmospheric pressure--that is, if not confined in any way--steam would  fill 1,610 times the space which its molecules occupied in their watery  formation. If we seal up the boiler so that no escape is possible for  the steam molecules, their motion becomes more and more rapid, and  _pressure_ is developed by their beating on the walls of the boiler.  There is theoretically no limit to which the pressure may be raised,  provided that sufficient fuel-combustion energy is transmitted to the  vaporizing water.    To raise steam in large quantities we must employ a fuel which develops  great heat in proportion to its weight, is readily procured, and cheap.  Coal fulfils all these conditions. Of the 800 million tons mined  annually throughout the world, 400 million tons are burnt in the  furnaces of steam-boilers.    A good boiler must be--(1) Strong enough to withstand much higher  pressures than that at which it is worked; (2) so designed as to burn  its fuel to the greatest advantage.    Even in the best-designed boilers a large part of the combustion heat  passes through the chimney, while a further proportion is radiated from  the boiler. Professor John Perry[1] considers that this waste amounts,  under the best conditions at present obtainable, to eleven-twelfths of  the whole. We have to burn a shillingsworth of coal to capture the  energy stored in a pennyworth. Yet the steam-engine of to-day is three  or four times as efficient as the engine of fifty years ago. This is due  to radical improvements in the design of boilers and of the machinery  which converts the heat energy of steam into mechanical motion.      CIRCULATION OF WATER IN A BOILER.    If you place a pot filled with water on an open fire, and watch it when  it boils, you will notice that the water heaves up at the sides and  plunges down at the centre. This is due to the water being heated most  at the sides, and therefore being lightest there. The rising  steam-bubbles also carry it up. On reaching the surface, the bubbles  burst, the steam escapes, and the water loses some of its heat, and  rushes down again to take the place of steam-laden water rising.    [Illustration: FIG. 1.]    [Illustration: FIG. 2.]    If the fire is very fierce, steam-bubbles may rise from all points at  the bottom, and impede downward currents (Fig. 1). The pot then \"boils  over.\"    Fig. 2 shows a method of preventing this trouble. We lower into our pot  a vessel of somewhat smaller diameter, with a hole in the bottom,  arranged in such a manner as to leave a space between it and the pot  all round. The upward currents are then separated entirely from the  downward, and the fire can be forced to a very much greater extent than  before without the water boiling over. This very simple arrangement is  the basis of many devices for producing free circulation of the water in  steam-boilers.    We can easily follow out the process of development. In Fig. 3 we see a  simple U-tube depending from a vessel of water. Heat is applied to the  left leg, and a steady circulation at once commences. In order to  increase the heating surface we can extend the heated leg into a long  incline (Fig. 4), beneath which three lamps instead of only one are  placed. The direction of the circulation is the same, but its rate is  increased.    [Illustration: FIG. 3.]    A further improvement results from increasing the number of tubes (Fig.  5), keeping them all on the slant, so that the heated water and steam  may rise freely.      THE ENCLOSED FURNACE.    [Illustration: FIG. 4.]    [Illustration: FIG. 5.]    Still, a lot of the heat gets away. In a steam-boiler the burning fuel  is enclosed either by fire-brick or a \"water-jacket,\" forming part of  the boiler. A water-jacket signifies a double coating of metal plates  with a space between, which is filled with water (see Fig. 6). The fire  is now enclosed much as it is in a kitchen range. But our boiler must  not be so wasteful of the heat as is that useful household fixture. On  their way to the funnel the flames and hot gases should act on a very  large metal or other surface in contact with the water of the boiler, in  order to give up a due proportion of their heat.    [Illustration: FIG. 6.--Diagrammatic sketch of a locomotive type of  boiler. Water indicated by dotted lines. The arrows show the direction  taken by the air and hot gases from the air-door to the funnel.]      THE MULTITUBULAR BOILER.    [Illustration: FIG. 7.--The Babcock and Wilcox water-tube boiler. One  side of the brick seating has been removed to show the arrangement of  the water-tubes and furnace.]    To save room, boilers which have to make steam very quickly and at high  pressures are largely composed of pipes. Such boilers we call  multitubular. They are of two kinds--(1) _Water_-tube boilers; in which  the water circulates through tubes exposed to the furnace heat. The  Babcock and Wilcox boiler (Fig. 7) is typical of this variety. (2)  _Fire_-tube boilers; in which the hot gases pass through tubes  surrounded by water. The ordinary locomotive boiler (Fig. 6) illustrates  this form.    The Babcock and Wilcox boiler is widely used in mines, power stations,  and, in a modified form, on shipboard. It consists of two main  parts--(1) A drum, H, in the upper part of which the steam collects; (2)  a group of pipes arranged on the principle illustrated by Fig. 5. The  boiler is seated on a rectangular frame of fire-bricks. At one end is  the furnace door; at the other the exit to the chimney. From the furnace  F the flames and hot gases rise round the upper end of the sloping tubes  TT into the space A, where they play upon the under surface of H before  plunging downward again among the tubes into the space B. Here the  temperature is lower. The arrows indicate further journeys upwards into  the space C on the right of a fire-brick division, and past the down  tubes SS into D, whence the hot gases find an escape into the chimney  through the opening E. It will be noticed that the greatest heat is  brought to bear on TT near their junction with UU, the \"uptake\" tubes;  and that every succeeding passage of the pipes brings the gradually  cooling gases nearer to the \"downtake\" tubes SS.    The pipes TT are easily brushed and scraped after the removal of plugs  from the \"headers\" into which the tube ends are expanded.    Other well-known water-tube boilers are the Yarrow, Belleville,  Stirling, and Thorneycroft, all used for driving marine engines.      FIRE-TUBE BOILERS.    Fig. 6 shows a locomotive boiler in section. To the right is the  fire-box, surrounded on all sides by a water-jacket in direct  communication with the barrel of the boiler. The inner shell of the  fire-box is often made of copper, which withstands the fierce heat  better than steel; the outer, like the rest of the boiler, is of steel  plates from"]]]
