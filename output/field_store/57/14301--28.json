[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/25012"],[0,"The Case of Wagner, Nietzsche Contra Wagner, and Selected Aphorisms. (#2)"],[1,"in the first place, have  been so fully rectified since, thanks to the publication of the English  translations of Daniel Halevy's and Henri Lichtenberger's works, \"The Life  of Friedrich Nietzsche,\"(2) and \"The Gospel of Superman,\"(3) respectively,  that, were it not for the fact that the truth about this matter cannot be  repeated too often, I should have refrained altogether from including any  fresh remarks of my own in this Third Edition.    In the works just referred to (pp. 129 _et seq._ in Halevy's book, and pp.  78 _et seq._ in Lichtenberger's book), the statement I made in my preface  to \"Thoughts out of Season,\" vol. i., and which I did not think it  necessary to repeat in my first preface to these pamphlets, will be found  to receive the fullest confirmation.    The statement in question was to the effect that many long years before  these pamphlets were even projected, Nietzsche's apparent _volte-face_ in  regard to his hero Wagner had been not only foreshadowed but actually  stated in plain words, in two works written during his friendship with  Wagner,--the works referred to being \"The Birth of Tragedy\" (1872), and  \"Wagner in Bayreuth\" (1875) of which Houston Stuart Chamberlain declares  not only that it possesses \"undying classical worth\" but that \"a perusal  of it is indispensable to all who wish to follow the question [of Wagner]  to its roots.\"(4)    The idea that runs through the present work like a leitmotif--the idea that  Wagner was at bottom more of a mime than a musician--was so far an ever  present thought with Nietzsche that it is ever impossible to ascertain the  period when it was first formulated.    In Nietzsche's wonderful autobiography (_Ecce Homo_, p. 88), in the  section dealing with the early works just mentioned, we find the following  passage--\"In the second of the two essays [Wagner in Bayreuth] with a  profound certainty of instinct, I already characterised the elementary  factor in Wagner's nature as a theatrical talent which, in all his means  and aspirations, draws its final conclusions.\" And as early as 1874,  Nietzsche wrote in his diary--\"Wagner is a born actor. Just as Goethe was  an abortive painter, and Schiller an abortive orator, so Wagner was an  abortive theatrical genius. His attitude to music is that of the actor;  for he knows how to sing and speak, as it were out of different souls and  from absolutely different worlds (_Tristan_ and the _Meistersinger_).\"    There is, however, no need to multiply examples, seeing, as I have said,  that in the translations of Halevy's and Lichtenberger's books the reader  will find all the independent evidence he could possibly desire,  disproving the popular, and even the learned belief that, in the two  pamphlets before us we have a complete, apparently unaccountable, and  therefore \"demented\" _volte-face_ on Nietzsche's part. Nevertheless, for  fear lest some doubt should still linger in certain minds concerning this  point, and with the view of adding interest to these essays, the Editor  considered it advisable, in the Second Edition, to add a number of  extracts from Nietzsche's diary of the year 1878 (ten years before \"The  Case of Wagner,\" and \"Nietzsche _contra_ Wagner\" were written) in order to  show to what extent those learned critics who complain of Nietzsche's  \"morbid and uncontrollable recantations and revulsions of feeling,\" have  overlooked even the plain facts of the case when forming their  all-too-hasty conclusions. These extracts will be found at the end of  \"Nietzsche _contra_ Wagner.\" While reading them, however, it should not be  forgotten that they were never intended for publication by Nietzsche  himself--a fact which accounts for their unpolished and sketchy form--and  that they were first published in vol. xi. of the first German Library  Edition (pp. 99-129) only when he was a helpless invalid, in 1897. Since  then, in 1901 and 1906 respectively, they have been reprinted, once in the  large German Library Edition (vol. xi. pp. 181-202), and once in the  German Pocket Edition, as an appendix to \"Human-All-too-Human,\" Part II.    An altogether special interest now attaches to these pamphlets; for, in  the first place we are at last in possession of Wagner's own account of  his development, his art, his aspirations and his struggles, in the  amazing self-revelation entitled _My Life_;(5) and secondly, we now have  _Ecce Homo_, Nietzsche's autobiography, in which we learn for the first  time from Nietzsche's own pen to what extent his history was that of a  double devotion--to Wagner on the one hand, and to his own life task, the  Transvaluation of all Values, on the other.    Readers interested in the Nietzsche-Wagner controversy will naturally look  to these books for a final solution of all the difficulties which the  problem presents. But let them not be too sanguine. From first to last  this problem is not to be settled by \"facts.\" A good deal of instinctive  choice, instinctive aversion, and instinctive suspicion are necessary  here. A little more suspicion, for instance, ought to be applied to  Wagner's _My Life_, especially in England, where critics are not half  suspicious enough about a continental artist's self-revelations, and are  too prone, if they have suspicions at all, to apply them in the wrong  place.    An example of this want of _finesse_ in judging foreign writers is to be  found in Lord Morley's work on Rousseau,--a book which ingenuously takes  for granted everything that a writer like Rousseau cares to say about  himself, without considering for an instant the possibility that Rousseau  might have practised some hypocrisy. In regard to Wagner's life we might  easily fall into the same error--that is to say, we might take seriously  all he says concerning himself and his family affairs.    We should beware of this, and should not even believe Wagner when he  speaks badly about himself. No one speaks badly about himself without a  reason, and the question in this case is to find out the reason. Did  Wagner--in the belief that genius was always immoral--wish to pose as an  immoral Egotist, in order to make us believe in his genius, of which he  himself was none too sure in his innermost heart? Did Wagner wish to  appear \"sincere\" in his biography, in order to awaken in us a belief in  the sincerity of his music, which he likewise doubted, but wished to  impress upon the world as \"true\"? Or did he wish to be thought badly of in  connection with things that were not true, and that consequently did not  affect him, in order to lead us off the scent of true things, things he  was ashamed of and which he wished the world to ignore--just like Rousseau  (the similarity between the two is more than a superficial one) who  barbarously pretended to have sent his children to the foundling hospital,  in order not to be thought incapable of having had any children at all? In  short, where is the bluff in Wagner's biography? Let us therefore be  careful about it, and all the more so because Wagner himself guarantees  the truth of it in the prefatory note. If we were to be credulous here, we  should moreover be acting in direct opposition to Nietzsche's own counsel  as given in the following aphorisms (Nos. 19 and 20, p. 89):--    \"It is very difficult to trace the course of Wagner's development,--no  trust must be placed in his own description of his soul's experiences. He  writes party-pamphlets for his followers.    \"It is extremely doubtful whether Wagner is able to bear witness about  himself.\"    While on p. 37 (the note), we read:--\"He [Wagner] was not proud enough to  be able to suffer the truth about himself. Nobody had less pride than he.  Like Victor Hugo he remained true to himself even in his biography,--he  remained an actor.\"    However, as a famous English judge has said--\"Truth will come out, even in  the witness box,\" and, as we may add in this case, even in an  autobiography. There is one statement in Wagner's _My Life_ which sounds  true to my ears at least--a statement which, in my opinion, has some  importance, and to which Wagner himself seems to grant a mysterious  significance. I refer to the passage on p. 93 of vol i., in which Wagner  says:--\"Owing to the exceptional vivacity and innate susceptibility of my  nature {~HORIZONTAL ELLIPSIS~} I gradually became conscious of a certain power of transporting  or bewildering my more indolent companions.\"    This seems innocent enough. When, however, it is read in conjunction with  Nietzsche's trenchant criticism, particularly on pp. 14, 15, 16, 17 and 18  of this work, and also with a knowledge of Wagner's music, it becomes one  of the most striking passages in Wagner's autobiography, for it records  how soon he became conscious of his dominant instinct and faculty.    I know perfectly well that the Wagnerites will not be influenced by these  remarks. Their gratitude to Wagner is too great for this. He has supplied  the precious varnish wherewith to hide the dull ugliness of our  civilisation. He has given to souls despairing over the materialism of  this world, to souls despairing of themselves, and longing to be rid of  themselves, the indispensable hashish and morphia wherewith to deaden  their inner discords. These discords are everywhere apparent nowadays.  Wagner is therefore a common need, a common benefactor. As such he is  bound to be worshipped and adored in spite of all egotistical and  theatrical autobiographies.    Albeit, signs are not wanting--at least among his Anglo-Saxon worshippers  who stand even more in need of romanticism than their continental  brethren,--which show that, in order to uphold Wagner, people are now  beginning to draw distinctions between the man and the artist. They  dismiss the man as \"human-all-too-human,\" but they still maintain that  there are divine qualities in his music. However distasteful the task of  disillusioning these psychological tyros may be, they should be "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/25016"],[0,"The House of Souls (#2)"],[1,"side whiskers and dark  moustache and a look of amiable vacuity. His wife was oddly bedizened in  black satin, with a wide spreading hat, not ill-looking, simply  unmeaning. I fancy that she had at times, not too often, \"a temper of  her own.\" And the very small baby sat upon her knee. The party was  probably going forth to spend the Sunday evening with relations or  friends._    _And yet, I said to myself, these two have partaken together of the  great mystery, of the great sacrament of nature, of the source of all  that is magical in the wide world. But have they discerned the  mysteries? Do they know that they have been in that place which is  called Syon and Jerusalem?--I am quoting from an old book and a strange  book._    _It was thus that, remembering the old story of the \"Resurrection of the  Dead,\" I was furnished with the source of \"A Fragment of Life.\" I was  writing \"Hieroglyphics\" at the time, having just finished \"The White  People\"; or rather, having just decided that what now appears in print  under that heading was all that would ever be written, that the Great  Romance that should have been written--in manifestation of the  idea--would never be written at all. And so, when Hieroglyphics was  finished, somewhere about May 1899, I set about \"A Fragment of Life\" and  wrote the first chapter with the greatest relish and the utmost ease.  And then my own life was dashed into fragments. I ceased to write. I  travelled. I saw Syon and Bagdad and other strange places--see \"Things  Near and Far\" for an explanation of this obscure passage--and found  myself in the lighted world of floats and battens, entering L. U. E.,  crossing R and exiting R 3; and doing all sorts of queer things._    _But still, in spite of all these shocks and changes, the \"notion\" would  not leave me. I went at it again, I suppose in 1904; consumed with a  bitter determination to finish what I had begun. Everything now had  become difficult. I tried this way and that way and the other way. They  all failed and I broke down on every one of them; and I tried and tried  again. At last I cobbled up some sort of an end, an utterly bad one, as  I realized as I wrote every single line and word of it, and the story  appeared, in 1904 or 1905, in Horlick's Magazine under the editorship of  my old and dear friend, A. E. Waite._    _Still; I was not satisfied. That end was intolerable and I knew it.  Again, I sat down to the work, night after night I wrestled with it. And  I remember an odd circumstance which may or may not be of some  physiological interest. I was then living in a circumscribed \"upper  part\" of a house in Cosway Street, Marylebone Road. That I might  struggle by myself, I wrote in the little kitchen; and night after night  as I fought grimly, savagely, all but hopelessly for some fit close for  \"A Fragment of Life,\" I was astonished and almost alarmed to find that  my feet developed a sensation of most deadly cold. The room was not  cold; I had lit the oven burners of the little gas cooking stove. I was  not cold; but my feet were chilled in a quite extraordinary manner, as  if they had been packed in ice. At last I took off my slippers with a  view of poking my toes into the oven of the stove, and feeling my feet  with my hand, I perceived that, in fact, they were not cold at all! But  the sensation remained; there, I suppose, you have an odd case of a  transference of something that was happening in the brain to the  extremities. My feet were quite warm to the palm of my hand, but to my  sense they were frozen. But what a testimony to the fitness of the  American idiom, \"cold feet,\" as signifying a depressed and desponding  mood! But, somehow or other, the tale was finished and the \"notion\" was  at last out of my head. I have gone into all this detail about \"A  Fragment of Life\" because I have been assured in many quarters that it  is the best thing that I have ever done, and students of the crooked  ways of literature may be interested to hear of the abominable labours  of doing it._    _\"The White People\" belongs to the same year as the first chapter of \"A  Fragment of Life,\" 1899, which was also the year of \"Hieroglyphics.\" The  fact was I was in high literary spirits, just then. I had been harassed  and worried for a whole year in the office of Literature, a weekly paper  published by The Times, and getting free again, I felt like a prisoner  released from chains; ready to dance in letters to any extent. Forthwith  I thought of \"A Great Romance,\" a highly elaborate and elaborated piece  of work, full of the strangest and rarest things. I have forgotten how  it was that this design broke down; but I found by experiment that the  great romance was to go on that brave shelf of the unwritten books, the  shelf where all the splendid books are to be found in their golden  bindings. \"The White People\" is a small piece of salvage from the wreck.  Oddly enough, as is insinuated in the Prologue, the mainspring of the  story is to be sought in a medical textbook. In the Prologue reference  is made to a review article by Dr. Coryn. But I have since found out  that Dr. Coryn was merely quoting from a scientific treatise that case  of the lady whose fingers became violently inflamed because she saw a  heavy window sash descend on the fingers of her child. With this  instance, of course, are to be considered all cases of stigmata, both  ancient and modern: and then the question is obvious enough: what limits  can we place to the powers of the imagination? Has not the imagination  the potentiality at least of performing any miracle, however marvelous,  however incredible, according to our ordinary standards? As to the  decoration of the story, that is a mingling which I venture to think  somewhat ingenious of odds and ends of folk lore and witch lore with  pure inventions of my own. Some years later I was amused to receive a  letter from a gentleman who was, if I remember, a schoolmaster somewhere  in Malaya. This gentleman, an earnest student of folklore, was writing  an article on some singular things he had observed amongst the Malayans,  and chiefly a kind of were-wolf state into which some of them were able  to conjure themselves. He had found, as he said, startling resemblances  between the magic ritual of Malaya and some of the ceremonies and  practices hinted at in \"The White People.\" He presumed that all this was  not fancy but fact; that is that I was describing practices actually in  use among superstitious people on the Welsh border; he was going to  quote from me in the article for the Journal of the Folk Lore Society,  or whatever it was called, and he just wanted to let me know. I wrote in  a hurry to the folklore journal to bid them beware: for the instances  selected by the student were all fictions of my own brain!_    _\"The Great God Pan\" and \"The Inmost Light\" are tales of an earlier  date, going back to 1890, '91, '92. I have written a good deal about  them in \"Far Off Things,\" and in a preface to an edition of \"The Great  God Pan,\" published by Messrs. Simpkin, Marshall in 1916, I have  described at length the origins of the book. But I must quote anew some  extracts from the reviews which welcomed \"The Great God Pan\" to my  extraordinary entertainment, hilarity and refreshment. Here are a few of  the best:_    _\"It is not Mr. Machen's fault but his misfortune, that one shakes with  laughter rather than with dread over the contemplation of his  psychological bogey.\"--Observer._    _\"His horror, we regret to say, leaves us quite cold ... and our flesh  obstinately refuses to creep.\"--Chronicle._    _\"His bogies don't scare.\"--Sketch._    _\"We are afraid he only succeeds in being ridiculous.\"--Manchester  Guardian._    _\"Gruesome, ghastly and dull.\"--Lady's Pictorial._    _\"Incoherent nightmare of sex ... which would soon lead to insanity if  unrestrained ... innocuous from its absurdity.\"--Westminster Gazette._    _And so on, and so on. Several papers, I remember, declared that \"The  Great God Pan\" was simply a stupid and incompetent rehash of Huysmans'  \"La-Bas\" and \"A Rebours.\" I had not read these books so I got them both.  Thereon, I perceived that my critics had not read them either._          A Fragment of Life      I    Edward Darnell awoke from a dream of an ancient wood, and of a clear  well rising into grey film and vapour beneath a misty, glimmering heat;  and as his eyes opened he saw the sunlight bright in the room, sparkling  on the varnish of the new furniture. He turned and found his wife's  place vacant, and with some confusion and wonder of the dream still  lingering in his mind, he rose also, and began hurriedly to set about  his dressing, for he had overslept a little, and the 'bus passed the  corner at 9.15. He was a tall, thin man, dark-haired and dark-eyed, and  in spite of the routine of the City, the counting of coupons, and all  the mechanical drudgery that had lasted for ten years, there still  remained about him the curious hint of a wild grace, as if he had been  born a creature of the antique wood, and had seen the fountain rising  from the green moss and the grey rocks.    The breakfast was laid in the room on the ground floor, the back room  with the French windows looking on the garden, and before he sat down to  his fried bacon he kissed his wife seriously and dutifully. She had  brown hair and brown eyes, and though her lovely face was grave and  quiet, one would have said that she might have awaited her husband under  the old trees, and bathed in the pool hollowed out of the rocks.    They had a good deal to talk over while the coffee was poured out and  the bacon eaten, and Darnell's egg brought in by the stupid, staring  servant-girl of the dusty face. They had been married for a year, and  they had got on excellently, rarely sitting silent for more than an  hour, but for the past few weeks Aunt Marian's present had afforded a  subject for conversation which seemed"]]]
