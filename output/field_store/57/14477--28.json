The longnose gar is      abundant in most large rivers of Kansas. The scarcity in the      Wakarusa is probably attributable to the small size of the stream.        _Lepisosteus platostomus_ Rafinesque. UMMZ 2. The shortnose gar is      common in the Kansas River but seems less inclined than the      longnose gar to ascend small streams.        _Dorosoma cepedianum_ (LeSueur). UMMZ 2; DM 1. Gizzard shad.        _Carpiodes velifer_ (Rafinesque). UMMZ 2. This record for the      highfin carpsucker is based on a single specimen (UMMZ 63182). It      was re-examined by Bernard Nelson who stated (personal      communication) \"The dorsal fin is broken and the 'pea-lip' smashed.      A trace of the 'pea' is still discernible. The body is deeply      compressed and other measurements agree with [those of] _C.      velifer_. It was identified as _C. cyprinus_ at first, but later      changed by Hubbs.\" _C. velifer_ probably was more abundant in      Kansas during and before the early 1900's than at present. Several      early records of the species are available, but the only specimen      obtained in Kansas in recent years was captured in the Neosho River      by Deacon in 1958.        Moore (1957:80) states that _C. velifer_ occurs in the clearer      rivers and lakes of the Mississippi valley, westward to Nebraska      and Oklahoma. The almost complete disappearance of this species      from Kansas probably resulted from an increase in turbidity, of the      rivers, accompanying settlement and cultivation of the land.        _Carpiodes carpio carpio_ (Rafinesque). KU 5, 12, 15; DM 1, 16, 21,      37. The river carpsucker occurred at stations scattered throughout      the drainage, except in the smallest creeks. The largest numbers      were found in the lower mainstream.        _Ictiobus cyprinella_ (Valenciennes). KU 10; UMMZ 2; DM 1. The      big-mouth buffalo was taken only near the mouth of the river; black      buffalo, _Ictiobus niger_ (Rafinesque) and smallmouth buffalo,      _Ictiobus bubalus_ (Rafinesque), possibly also occur there but were      not taken in our survey.        _Catostomus commersonnii commersonnii_ (Lacepede). KU 4, 8, 14;      UMMZ 1, 5; DM 10, 11, 15, 16, 21, 23, 25, 26, 27, 29, 34, 42. The      white sucker occurs primarily in upstream-habitats in the Wakarusa      Basin.        _Moxostoma aureolum_ (LeSueur). KU 15; DM 1. The northern redhorse      was taken only in downstream portions of the basin. Minckley and      Cross (1960) regard specimens from the Wakarusa River as      intergrades between _M. a. aureolum_ and _M. a. pisolabrum_.        _Cyprinus carpio_ Linnaeus. KU 9, 12, 15; DM 1, 2. The carp, though      most abundant in downstream situations, probably occurs throughout      the drainage and is a potential pest in all impoundments likely to      be constructed in the basin.        _Notemigonus crysoleucas_ (Mitchill). KU 9; DM 9, 27, 33, 41. The      golden shiner was found only in tributaries.        _Semotilus atromaculatus_ (Mitchill). KU 2, 3, 5, 6, 7, 8, 10, 12,      13, 14; UMMZ 4, 5; DM 3, 9, 10, 11, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 23,      24, 25, 26, 29, 30, 31, 32, 33. The creek chub was usually abundant      in small upland tributaries.        _Hybopsis biguttata_ (Kirtland). KU 1, 3; UMMZ 4. The hornyhead      chub seemingly was common in early collections but has not been      found since 1924. The fish characteristically inhabits clear      streams having gravel-bottom. Disappearance of the species from the      Wakarusa may have resulted from increased siltation and      intermittency of flow.        _Hybopsis storeriana_ (Kirtland). KU 10; UMMZ 3.        _Hybopsis aestivalis_ (Girard). KU 10; UMMZ 3; DM 1. This species      and the preceding one are common in the Kansas River but do not      ascend far up the Wakarusa. _Hybopsis gelida_ (Girard) and      _Hybopsis gracilis_ (Richardson) occur in the Kansas River and may      be expected in the lowermost portion of the mainstream of the      Wakarusa.        _Notropis percobromus_ (Cope). KU 12; DM 1, 2. The plains shiner      shows little tendency to move far upstream from the Kansas River,      where it is abundant.        _Notropis umbratilis_ (Girard). KU 5, 11, 14; UMMZ 1, 4, 5; DM 9,      10, 11, 16, 17, 18, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 29, 32, 33, 34, 35, 37,      38, 39, 41. In our survey the redfin shiner was the most abundant      species at several stations, especially at those in the lower and      middle portions of tributaries to the mainstream.        _Notropis cornutus frontalis_ (Agassiz). KU 1, 2, 3, 8, 11, 14; DM      16. Judging from the numbers preserved in early collections, the      common shiner was more abundant and widespread in the 1890's than      in 1959. A watershed improvement program effecting more stable flow      and decreased turbidity might benefit this shiner.        _Notropis lutrensis_ (Baird and Girard). KU 1, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11,      12, 13, 14, 15; UMMZ 1, 2, 3, 4, 5; DM all stations _except_ 5, 11,      12, 13, 14, 19, 35. The red shiner was ubiquitous, and was the      dominant species at a majority of stations.        _Notropis stramineus_ (Cope). KU 7, 8, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15; DM      1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 7, 9, 10, 15, 16, 17, 24, 25, 31, 37. The sand      shiner was most common in two environments: (1) near the mouth of      the Wakarusa where abundance of the species may be attributed to      the close proximity of a large population of _N. stramineus_ in the      Kansas River, and (2) in upland tributaries that drain areas in      which sand is found (especially in Cole Creek).        _Notropis topeka_ (Gilbert). KU 1, 14; UMMZ 1, 4, 5; DM 22, 25, 27,      33. Minckley and Cross (1959) describe the habitat of the Topeka      shiner as pools of clear upland tributaries with slight flow. We      found the Topeka shiner in such habitat in Deer Creek, Strowbridge      Creek and Burys Creek. The largest population occurred in a      tributary of Strowbridge Creek. This stream probably was      intermittent in 1958, and Deer and Burys creeks may have been      intermittent at some time in 1957-1959. Although Minckley and Cross      (1959:215) have stated that Rock Creek is \"unsuitable for this      species,\" we suspect that Rock Creek served as a refugium for _N.      topeka_ in time of drought. It was found there (KU 14) in 1952, and      again (DM 16) on April 8, 1960.        _Notropis buchanani_ Meek. UMMZ 3. Inclusion of the ghost shiner is      based on two specimens (UMMZ 63107) collected by C. W. Creaser in      1924.        _Phenacobius mirabilis_ (Girard). KU 6, 7, 8, 10, 11, 12, 13, 15;      UMMZ 4; DM 3, 6, 16, 18, 21, 22, 34. The suckermouth minnow      occurred in several collections but was nowhere dominant. The      largest populations were at DM 3, 6, and 22.        _Hybognathus nuchalis_ Agassiz. KU 8, 15; UMMZ 3; DM 1, 6. The      silvery minnow was taken only in the downstream portion of the      Wakarusa and its lower tributaries.        _Pimephales promelas_ Rafinesque. KU 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 13, 14,      15; UMMZ 1, 4, 5; DM all stations _except_ 1, 8, 10, 11, 13, 14,      30. The fathead minnow was ubiquitous, and was dominant at several      stations on the smallest creeks.        _Pimephales notatus_ (Rafinesque). KU 1, 6, 11, 12, 14, 15; UMMZ 1,      4, 5; DM 6, 8, 10, 12, 16, 17, 18, 24, 25, 26, 37, 41. The      bluntnose minnow occurred at several stations on tributaries but      was not common.        _Campostoma anomalum_ (Rafinesque)."]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/31529"],[0,"Modern marriage and how to bear it (#2)"],[1,"eyes? On every side one hears it vilified  and its very necessity called in question. From the pulpit, the clergy  endeavour to uphold the sanctity of the institution, and unceasingly  exhort their congregations to respect it and abide by its laws. But the  Divorce Court returns make ominous reading; every family solicitor will  tell you his personal experience goes to prove that happy unions are  considerably on the decrease, and some of the greatest thinkers of our  day join in a chorus of condemnation against latter-day marriage.    Tolstoy says: 'The relations between the sexes are searching for a new  form, the old one is falling to pieces.' Among the manuscript 'remains'  of Ibsen, that profound student of human nature, the following  noteworthy passage occurs: '\"Free-born men\" is a phrase of rhetoric.  They do not exist, for marriage, the relation between man and wife, has  corrupted the race and impressed the mark of slavery upon all.' Not long  ago, too, our greatest living novelist, George Meredith, created an  immense sensation by his suggestion that marriage should become a  temporary arrangement, with a minimum lease of, say, ten years.    That the time has not yet come for any such revolutionary change is  obvious, but if the signs and portents of the last decade or two do not  lie, we may safely assume that the time _will_ come, and that the  present legal conditions of wedlock will be altered in some way or  other.    Fifteen years ago there was a sudden wave of rebellion against these  conditions, and a renewed interest in the sex question showed itself in  an outbreak of problem novels--a term which later came to be used as one  of reproach. Perhaps the most important of these was Grant Allen's _The  Woman Who Did_. I can recall as a schoolgirl the excitement it aroused  and my acute disappointment when it was forcibly commandeered from me by  an irate governess who apparently took no interest in these enthralling  subjects. A host of imitators followed _The Woman Who Did_; some of them  entirely illiterate, all of them offering some infallible key to the  difficult maze of marriage.    Worse still was the reaction that inevitably followed, when realism was  tabooed in fiction, and sickly romance possessed the field. _The Yellow  Book_ and similar strange exotics of the first period withered and died,  and the cult of literature (!) for the British Home was shortly  afterwards in full blast. There followed an avalanche of insufferably  dull and puerile magazines, in which the word _Sex_ was strictly taboo,  and the ideal aimed at was apparently the extreme opposite to real life.  It was odd how suddenly the sex note--(as I will call it for want of a  better word)--disappeared from the press. Psychology was pronounced  'off,' and plots were the order of the day. Many names well-known at  that time and associated with a _flair_ for delicate delineation of  character, disappeared from the magazine contents bill and the  publisher's list, whilst facile writers who could turn out mild  detective yarns or tales of adventure and gore were in clover.    Signs are not wanting that the pendulum of public interest has now swung  back again, and another wave of realism in fiction and inquiry into the  re-adjustment of the conjugal bond is imminent. But the pendulum will  have to swing back and forth a good many times however, before the  relations between the sexes succeed in finding that new form of which  Tolstoy speaks. What the revival I have foretold will accomplish remains  to be seen. What did the last agitation achieve? Practically nothing;  a few women may have been impelled to follow in the footsteps of Grant  Allen's Herminia to their undying sorrow, and possibly a good many  precocious young girls, who read the literature of that day, may have  given their parents some anxiety by their revolutionary ideas on the  value of the holy estate. But when that trio so irresistible to the  feminine heart came along--the Ring, the Trousseau, and the House of My  Own, to say nothing of the solid, twelve-stone, prospective  husband--which among these advanced damsels remembered the sermon on the  hill-top?    Yet in the fourteen years that have elapsed since the publication of  _The Woman Who Did_, there have certainly been some changes. For one  thing, it is still harder apparently to earn a decent living. Times  are bad and money scarce; men are even more reluctant than before to  'domesticate the recording angel' by marrying, and a type of woman has  sprung up amongst us who is shy of matrimony and honestly reluctant to  risk its many perils for the sake of its problematical joys. Most  noticeable of all is the growing dissatisfaction of the sexes with each  other. Men do not shun marriage only because of unfavourable financial  conditions, or because the restrictions of wedlock are any more irksome  to them than formerly, but because they cannot find a wife sufficiently  near their ideal. Woman has progressed to such an extent within the  last generation or two: her outlook has so broadened, her intellect  so developed that she has strayed very far from man's ideal and,  consequently, man hesitates to marry her. There is something comic about  the situation, and at Olympian dinner-tables I feel sure the gods would  laugh at this twentieth-century conjugal deadlock.    Another reason why men fall in love so much less than they used to do is  largely due to the decay of the imaginative faculty. As for women,  although they are in the main as anxious to marry as ever, although it  is universally acknowledged that the modern young woman does cultivate  the modern young man unduly, their reasons for doing so are less and  less concerned with the time-honoured motives of love. Marriage brings  independence and a certain social importance; for these reasons women  desire it. H. B. Marriot Watson has put the case neatly thus: 'Women  desire to marry _a_ man; men to marry _the_ woman.' Nevertheless women  are even now more prone to fall in love than are men, because they have  better preserved this imaginative faculty, which is possibly also the  cause of the disillusionment and discontent of wives after marriage.    The upshot of it all is that men and women appear to have become  antagonistic to each other. However much they love the individual of  their fancy, a kind of veiled distrust seems to obtain between the sexes  collectively, but more especially on the part of men--perhaps because  man is more necessary to woman than woman is to man. This hostility  towards woman is particularly noticeable in the pages of the press.  Scarcely a week passes but some journalist of the nobler sex pours out  his scorn for the inferior one of his mother in columns of masterly  abuse on one score or another. Each article is followed by a passionate  correspondence in which 'Disgusted Dad,' 'Hopeless Hubby,' 'Browbeaten  Brother,' and the inevitable 'Cynicus' express high approval of the  writer, whilst 'Happy Mother of Seven Girls' and 'Lover of the Sex'  write to demand his instant execution and public disgrace.    The range of men's fault-finding is endless; one will assert that women  are mere domestic machines, unfit companions for any intelligent man,  and with no soul above conversation about their servants and children;  another that they are mere blue-stockings striving after an unattainable  intellectuality; a third that they are mere frivolous dolls without  brain or heart, engrossed in the pursuit of pleasure, a fourth that they  are sexless, slangy, misclad masculine monsters.    Judged by the assertions of newspaper correspondents, women are at one  and the same time preposterously masculine, contemptibly feminine,  ridiculously intellectual, repulsively athletic, and revoltingly  frivolous. In appearance they are either lank, gaunt, flat-footed  lamp-posts, or else over-dressed, unnaturally-shaped, painted dolls.  Their extravagance exhausts expletive! When they belong to the class of  society generally denoted with a capital S, they invariably smoke,  drink, gamble and swear. They neglect their homes and their children.  They have little principle and less sense, no morals, no heart and  absolutely _no_ sense of humour!    'But,' the observant reader may possibly exclaim, 'there is nothing new  about this. Woman has ever been man's favourite grumble-vent, from the  day when the first man got out of his first scrape by blaming the only  available woman!' True enough, age cannot stale the infinite variety of  women's misdemeanours, as viewed by men; tradition has hallowed the  subject, custom carries it on; and probably when the last trump shall  sound, the last living man will be found grumbling loudly at the  abominable selfishness of woman for leaving him alone, and the last dead  man to rise will awake cursing because his wife did not call him sooner!    But formerly man's fault-finding was more of the nature of genial chaff,  as when we affectionately laugh at those we love. There was nearly  always a certain good humour about his diatribes, which now is lacking.  In its stead can be noted a bitterness, a distinct animus. Men  apparently take with an ill-grace women's rebellion against the old  man-made conditions, and they retaliate by falling in love less  frequently, and showing still more reluctance to enter the arena of  matrimony.    Nevertheless, they get there all the same, albeit in a different spirit.  Timorous and trembling, our faint-hearted modern lovers gird on their  new frock-coats and step shrinkingly into the arena where awaits  them--radiant and triumphant--the determined being whose will has  brought them thither. No, not _her_ will, but the mysterious will of  Nature which remains steadfast and of unswerving purpose, indifferent  to our sex-warfare and the progress of our petty loves and hates.
