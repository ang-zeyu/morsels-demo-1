We must, in order to do him justice, give  full consideration to his temperament and to the condition of things around  him. We are here in touch with an untutored but fervent mind, trying to  realise itself and to assimilate certain great truths which have been  powerfully borne in upon him, in order to impart them in a convincing form to  his fellow-tribesmen. He is surrounded by obstacles of every kind, yet he  manfully struggles on with the message that is within him. Learning he has  none, or next to none. His chief objects of knowledge are floating stories  and traditions largely picked up from hearsay, and his over-wrought mind is  his only teacher. The literary compositions to which he had ever listened  were the half-cultured, yet often wildly powerful rhapsodies of early Arabian  minstrels, akin to Ossian rather than to anything else within our knowledge.  What wonder then that his Koran took a form which to our colder temperaments  sounds strange, unbalanced, and fantastic?    Yet the Moslems themselves consider the book the finest that ever appeared  among men. They find no incongruity in the style. To them the matter is all  true and the manner all perfect. Their eastern temperament responds readily  to the crude, strong, and wild appeal which its cadences make to them, and  the jingling rhyme in which the sentences of a discourse generally end adds  to the charm of the whole. The Koran, even if viewed from the point of view  of style alone, was to them from the first nothing less than a miracle, as  great a miracle as ever was wrought.    But to return to our own view of the case. Our difficulty in appreciating the  style of the Koran even moderately is, of course, increased if, instead of  the original, we have a translation before us. But one is happy to be able to  say that Rodwell's rendering is one of the best that have as yet been  produced. It seems to a great extent to carry with it the atmosphere in which  Muhammed lived, and its sentences are imbued with the flavour of the East.  The quasi-verse form, with its unfettered and irregular rhythmic flow of the  lines, which has in suitable cases been adopted, helps to bring out much of  the wild charm of the Arabic. Not the least among its recommendations is,  perhaps, that it is scholarly without being pedantic that is to say, that it  aims at correctness without sacrificing the right effect of the whole to  over-insistence on small details.    Another important merit of Rodwell's edition is its chronological arrangement  of the Suras or chapters. As he tells us himself in his preface, it is now in  a number of cases impossible to ascertain the exact occasion on which a  discourse, or part of a discourse, was delivered, so that the system could  not be carried through with entire consistency. But the sequence adopted is  in the main based on the best available historical and literary evidence; and  in following the order of the chapters as here printed, the reader will be  able to trace the development of the prophet's mind as he gradually advanced  from the early flush of inspiration to the less spiritual and more equivocal  r\\oc\\le of warrior, politician, and founder of an empire.

LATE CHIEF JUSTICE OF NEW ZEALAND,    THIS VOLUME IS DEDICATED,    WITH SINCERE FEELINGS OF ESTEEM FOR HIS PRIVATE WORTH,    PUBLIC SERVICES,    AND EMINENT LITERARY ATTAINMENTS,    BY        THE TRANSLATOR.        PREFACE    It is necessary that some brief explanation should be given with reference to  the arrangement of the Suras, or chapters, adopted in this translation of the  Koran. It should be premised that their order as it stands in all Arabic  manuscripts, and in all hitherto printed editions, whether Arabic or  European, is not chronological, neither is there any authentic tradition to  shew that it rests upon the authority of Muhammad himself. The scattered  fragments of the Koran were in the first instance collected by his immediate  successor Abu Bekr, about a year after the Prophet's death, at the suggestion  of Omar, who foresaw that, as the Muslim warriors, whose memories were the  sole depositaries of large portions of the revelations, died off or were  slain, as had been the case with many in the battle of Yemâma, A.H. 12, the  loss of the greater part, or even of the whole, was imminent. Zaid Ibn  Thâbit, a native of Medina, and one of the Ansars, or helpers, who had been  Muhammad's amanuensis, was the person fixed upon to carry out the task, and  we are told that he \"gathered together\" the fragments of the Koran from every  quarter, \"from date leaves and tablets of white stone, and from the breasts  of men.\"1 The copy thus formed by Zaid probably remained in the possession of  Abu Bekr during the remainder of his brief caliphate, who committed it to the  custody of Haphsa, one of Muhammad's widows, and this text continued during  the ten years of Omar's caliphate to be the standard. In the copies made from  it, various readings naturally and necessarily sprung up; and these, under  the caliphate of Othman, led to such serious disputes between the faithful,  that it became necessary to interpose, and in accordance with the warning of  Hodzeifa, \"to stop the people, before they should differ regarding their  scriptures, as did the Jews and Christians.\"2 In accordance with this advice,  Othman determined to establish a text which should be the sole standard, and  entrusted the redaction to the Zaid already mentioned, with whom he  associated as colleagues, three, according to others, twelve3 of the  Koreisch, in order to secure the purity of that Meccan idiom in which  Muhammad had spoken, should any occasions arise in which the collators might  have to decide upon various readings. Copies of the text formed were thus  forwarded to several of the chief military stations in the new empire, and  all previously existing copies were committed to the flames.    Zaid and his coadjutors, however, do not appear to have arranged the  materials which came into their hands upon any system more definite than that  of placing the longest and best known Suras first, immediately after the  Fatthah, or opening chapter (the eighth in this edition); although even this  rule, artless and unscientific as it is, has not been adhered to with  strictness. Anything approaching to a chronological arrangement was entirely  lost sight of. Late Medina Suras are often placed before early Meccan Suras;  the short Suras at the end of the Koran are its earliest portions; while, as  will be seen from the notes, verses of Meccan origin are to be found embedded  in Medina Suras, and verses promulged at Medina scattered up and down in the  Meccan Suras. It would seem as if Zaid had to a great extent put his  materials together just as they came to hand, and often with entire disregard  to continuity of subject and uniformity of style. The text, therefore, as  hitherto arranged, necessarily assumes the form of a most unreadable and  incongruous patchwork; \"une assemblage,\" says M. Kasimirski in his Preface,  \"informe et incohérent de préceptes moraux, religieux, civils et politiques,  mêlés d'exhortations, de promesses, et de menaces\"-and conveys no idea  whatever of the development and growth of any plan in the mind of the founder  of Islam, or of the circumstances by which he was surrounded and influenced.  It is true that the manner in which Zaid contented himself with simply  bringing together his materials and transcribing them, without any attempt to  mould them into shape or sequence, and without any effort to supply  connecting links between adjacent verses, to fill up obvious chasms, or to  suppress details of a nature discreditable to the founder of Islam, proves  his scrupulous honesty as a compiler, as well as his reverence for the sacred  text, and to a certain extent guarantees the genuineness and authenticity of  the entire volume. But it is deeply to be regretted that he did not combine  some measure of historical criticism with that simplicity and honesty of  purpose which forbade him, as it certainly did, in any way to tamper with the  sacred text, to suppress contradictory, and exclude or"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/28019"],[0,"Birds in the Bush (#2)"],[1,"revengeful--that at a certain time of the year he could  scarcely read his Bible on Sunday mornings, because of the racket which  this woodpecker made hammering on the tin roof overhead.    Another of my acquaintances was of a very different type, a female  Maryland yellow-throat. This lovely creature, a most exquisite, dainty  bit of bird flesh, was in the Garden all by herself on the 6th of  October, when the great majority of her relatives must have been already  well on their way toward the sunny South. She appeared to be perfectly  contented, and allowed me to watch her closely, only scolding mildly now  and then when I became too inquisitive. How I did admire her bravery and  peace of mind; feeding so quietly, with that long, lonesome journey  before her, and the cold weather coming on! No wonder the Great Teacher  pointed his lesson of trust with the injunction, \"Behold the fowls of  the air.\"    A passenger even worse belated than this warbler was a chipping sparrow  that I found hopping about the edge of the Beacon Street Mall on the 6th  of December, seven or eight weeks after all chippers were supposed to be  south of Mason and Dixon's line. Some accident had detained him  doubtless; but he showed no signs of worry or haste, as I walked round  him, scrutinizing every feather, lest he should be some tree sparrow  traveling in disguise.    There is not much to attract birds to the Common in the winter, since we  offer them neither evergreens for shelter nor weed patches for a  granary. I said to one of the gardeners that I thought it a pity, on  this account, that some of the plants, especially the zinnias and  marigolds, were not left to go to seed. A little untidiness, in so good  a cause, could hardly be taken amiss by even the most fastidious  taxpayer. He replied that it would be of no use; we hadn't any birds  now, and we shouldn't have any so long as the English sparrows were here  to drive them away. But it would be of use, notwithstanding; and  certainly it would afford a pleasure to many people to see flocks of  goldfinches, red-poll linnets, tree sparrows, and possibly of the  beautiful snow buntings, feeding in the Garden in midwinter.    Even as things are, however, the cold season is sure to bring us a few  butcher-birds. These come on business, and are now welcomed as public  benefactors, though formerly our sparrow-loving municipal authorities  thought it their duty to shoot them. They travel singly, as a rule, and  sometimes the same bird will be here for several weeks together. Then  you will have no trouble about finding here and there in the hawthorn  trees pleasing evidences of his activity and address. Collurio is  brought up to be in love with his work. In his Mother Goose it is  written,--        Fe, fi, fo, farrow!      I smell the blood of an English sparrow;    and however long he may live, he never forgets his early training. His  days, as the poet says, are \"bound each to each by natural piety.\" Happy  lot! wherein duty and conscience go ever hand in hand; for whose  possessor            \"Love is an unerring light,      And joy its own security.\"    In appearance the shrike resembles the mocking-bird. Indeed, a policeman  whom I found staring at one would have it that he _was_ a mocking-bird.  \"Don't you _see_ he is? And he's been singing, too.\" I had nothing to  say against the singing, since the shrike will often twitter by the  half hour in the very coldest weather. But further discussion concerning  the bird's identity was soon rendered needless; for, while we were  talking, along came a sparrow, and dropped carelessly into a hawthorn  bush, right under the shrike's perch. The latter was all attention  instantly, and, after waiting till the sparrow had moved a little out of  the thick of the branches, down he pounced. He missed his aim, or the  sparrow was too quick for him, and although he made a second swoop, and  followed that by a hot chase, he speedily came back without his prey.  This little exertion, however, seemed to have provoked his appetite;  for, instead of resuming his coffee-tree perch, he went into the  hawthorn, and began to feed upon the carcass of a bird which, it seemed,  he had previously laid up in store. He was soon frightened off for a few  moments by the approach of a third man, and the policeman improved the  opportunity to visit the bush and bring away his breakfast. When the  fellow returned and found his table empty, he did not manifest the  slightest disappointment (the shrike never does; he is a fatalist, I  think); but in order to see what he would do, the policeman tossed the  body to him. It lodged on one of the outer twigs, and immediately the  shrike came for it; at the same time spreading his beautifully bordered  tail and screaming loudly. Whether these demonstrations were intended to  express delight, or anger, or contempt, I could not judge; but he seized  the body, carried it back to its old place, drove it again upon the  thorn, and proceeded to devour it more voraciously than ever, scattering  the feathers about in a lively way as he tore it to pieces. The third  man, who had never before seen such a thing, stepped up within reach of  the bush, and eyed the performance at his leisure, the shrike not  deigning to mind him in the least. A few mornings later the same bird  gave me another and more amusing exhibition of his nonchalance. He was  singing from the top of our one small larch-tree, and I had stopped near  the bridge to look and listen, when a milkman entered at the  Commonwealth Avenue gate, both hands full of cans, and, without noticing  the shrike, walked straight under the tree. Just then, however, he heard  the notes overhead, and, looking up, saw the bird. As if not knowing  what to make of the creature's assurance, he stared at him for a moment,  and then, putting down his load, he seized the trunk with both hands,  and gave it a good shake. But the bird only took a fresh hold; and when  the man let go, and stepped back to look up, there he sat, to all  appearance as unconcerned as if nothing had happened. Not to be so  easily beaten, the man grasped the trunk again, and shook it harder than  before; and this time Collurio seemed to think the joke had been carried  far enough, for he took wing, and flew to another part of the Garden.  The bravado of the butcher-bird is great, but it is not unlimited. I saw  him, one day, shuffling along a branch in a very nervous, unshrikely  fashion, and was at a loss to account for his unusual demeanor till I  caught sight of a low-flying hawk sweeping over the tree. Every  creature, no matter how brave, has some other creature to be afraid of;  otherwise, how would the world get on?    The advent of spring is usually announced during the first week of  March, sometimes by the robins, sometimes by the bluebirds. The latter,  it should be remarked, are an exception to the rule that our spring and  autumn callers arrive and depart in the night. My impression is that  their migrations are ordinarily accomplished by daylight. At all events  I have often seen them enter the Common, alight for a few minutes, and  then start off again; while I have never known them to settle down for a  visit of two or three days, in the manner of most other species. This  last peculiarity may be owing to the fact that the European sparrows  treat them with even more than their customary measure of incivility,  till the poor wayfarers have literally no rest for the soles of their  feet. They breed by choice in just such miniature meeting-houses as our  city fathers have provided so plentifully for their foreign _proteges_;  and probably the latter, being aware of this, feel it necessary to  discourage at the outset any idea which these blue-coated American  interlopers may have begun to entertain of settling in Boston for the  summer.    The robins may be said to be abundant with us for more than half the  year; but they are especially numerous for a month or two early in the  season. I have counted more than thirty feeding at once in the lower  half of the parade ground, and at nightfall have seen forty at roost in  one tree, with half as many more in the tree adjoining. They grow  extremely noisy about sunset, filling the air with songs, cackles, and  screams, till even the most stolid citizen pauses a moment to look up at  the authors of so much clamor.    By the middle of March the song sparrows begin to appear, and for a  month after this they furnish delightful music daily. I have heard them  caroling with all cheerfulness in the midst of a driving snow-storm. The  dear little optimists! They never doubt that the sun is on their side.  Of necessity they go elsewhere to find nests for themselves, where they  may lay their young; for they build on the ground, and a lawn which is  mowed every two or three days would be quite out of the question.    At the best, a public park is not a favorable spot in which to study  bird music. Species that spend the summer here, like the robin, the  warbling vireo, the red-eyed vireo, the chipper, the goldfinch, and the  Baltimore oriole, of course sing freely; but the much larger number  which merely drop in upon us by the way are busy feeding during their  brief sojourn, and besides are kept in a state of greater or less  excitement by the frequent approach of passers-by. Nevertheless, I once  heard a bobolink sing in our Garden (the only one I ever saw there), and  once a brown thrush, although neither was sufficiently at home to do  himself justice. The \"Peabody\" song of the white-throated sparrows is to  be heard occasionally during both migrations. It is the more welcome in  such a place, because, to my ears at least, it is one of the wildest of  all bird notes; it is among the last to be heard at night in the White  Mountain woods, as well as one of the last to die away beneath you as  you climb the higher peaks.
