[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/24858"],[0,"The Story of Wool (#2)"],[1," while these arrangements were being  made.    At last dawned that clear April morning when the East was left behind  and the journey to the West--that unknown land--was begun. Donald had  never been West. The vastness of the country, the newness of the scenery  surprised and delighted him. Geography had never seemed so real before.  No longer were the various states pink, green, or purple splotches on  the map; they were real living places with people, sunshine, and fresh  air.    \"I had no idea America was so big!\" he gasped to his father.    \"It's the finest country in the world, Don! Be proud and thankful that  you are an American. No other land does so much for her people. Be  humble, too. Never let a chance go by to do your part in helping the  country that does so much for you.\"    They were standing in the glassed-in rear of the train, and as Mr.  Clark spoke he pointed to vast tracts of forest land that sped past  them.    \"I am afraid I can't do anything for a great country like this, father,\"  said Donald, a little quiver in his voice.    \"There is one thing we can all do--that is be good citizens. Every law  we have was made for the good of our people. In so far as you keep these  laws you will be aiding in building up a more perfect America. Bear your  share in that work--do not be a hindrance, Don.\"    \"I'll try, father,\" was the boy's grave reply.    To help in the progress of such a land as this! More than once Donald  thought of his father's words as the train threaded its way along the  banks of mighty rivers, rolled through great woodlands, or skirted  cities which throbbed with the life of mighty industries.    And all this vast-reaching land was his country--his!    On every hand there were wonders!    As the express thundered along he poured out question after question.    Why did people go way to Idaho to raise sheep? Why didn't his father  raise his sheep in the East? Certainly there was room enough, plenty of  room, that was much nearer than Idaho. How did sheep get into the  mountains of Idaho anyway?    Mr. Clark ducked his head under the torrent of queries.    \"You will drown me with questions!\" he exclaimed laughing. \"Well, I  shall do my best to answer you. New Mexico was the first sheep center in  our country. Herds were originally brought from Spain, and these flocks  worked their way up from Mexico through New Mexico and California; here  the hills supplied the coolness necessary to animals with such thick  coats, and furnished them at the same time with plentiful grass for  food. During the day the herds grazed, and at night they were driven  into corrals of cedar built by the shepherds. These sheep were mostly  Merinos, a variety raised in Spain. Afterward, in 1853, a man named  William W. Hollister brought three hundred ewes across our continent to  the West. Think what a journey it must have been!\"    \"Wasn't the railroad built?\"    \"No. Neither were there any bridges. There were rivers to swim and  mountains to climb; furthermore there was many a search for water-holes,  because Mr. Hollister was not well enough acquainted with the country to  know where to find water for himself and the herd.\"    \"I should not think a sheep would have lived through such a journey!\"  cried Donald.    \"Many of them did, however,\" answered his father, \"and that is how our  western sheep-raising industry began. Now it is one of the great  occupations of our land, and soon you and I are to know more about it.\"    \"And about Sandy McCulloch, too, I hope,\" put in the boy.    \"I hope so; only remember--not a word of that telegram to any one at the  ranch. We shall get into Glen City this noon if our train is on time and  we must trust to luck in getting to Crescent Ranch. It is fifteen miles  from the station, up in the foot-hills of the Rockies.\"    \"The--the--you don't mean the Rocky Mountains!\" gasped Donald, his eyes  very wide open.    \"Certainly. Have you forgotten your geography?\"    \"Of course I know that a spur of the Rocky Mountains does run diagonally  across Idaho; but somehow I never thought of really being in the Rocky  Mountains!\"    Mr. Clark enjoyed the outburst.    \"To be where there are bears and bob-cats and----\"    \"Maybe, after all, you would rather have stayed at home and finished out  your school year.\"    \"I rather guess not!\" was the lad's emphatic reply.    So impatient was he to see the marvels of this magic land that the last  few hours of the journey seemed unending.    But they did end.    Toward noon the heavy train pulled into Glen City and they bundled out  on to the platform. They were the only passengers, but there was a  great deal of freight--boxes, barrels, and cases of provisions. As they  stood hesitating as to what they had better do a tall, bony young fellow  approached the station agent and called with a decided suggestion of the  Highlander in his accent:    \"I dinna see those kegs of lime for Crescent Ranch, Mitchell.\"    \"They're here. You will find them at the end of the platform. Come, and  I'll help you pile them on your wagon.\"    Mr. Clark turned to the Scotchman.    \"Are you going to Crescent Ranch?\"    \"Aye, I be, sir.\"    \"Can you take my son and me along?\"    The Scotchman studied him carefully.    \"Have you business at the ranch?\" he asked, looking keenly into the eyes  of the speaker.    Mr. Clark met his gaze good-naturedly.    \"We might possibly have,\" he answered. \"At any rate we want to go up  there. My name is Clark and I come from Boston.\"    \"Clark, did you say, sir?\"    \"Yes.\"    The stolid stare of the Scotchman did not waver.    \"Mayhap you're the owner, sir.\"    \"Yes, I am.\"    A gleam of something very like satisfaction passed over the tanned  features of the young man. Then his face settled back into its wonted  calmness.    \"It's welcome you are, sir,\" he said heartily. \"I dinna think there'll  be trouble about taking you and your son to Crescent.\"    He wheeled and led the way to a wagon, where he piled up some sacks of  grain for his guests to sit upon. Then he lifted in their luggage and  the freight for which he had come, and gathered the lines over the backs  of his horses.    As the wagon toiled up the long, low hills Mr. Clark began asking  questions about the ranch--he asked many questions concerning the  country and the flocks. To all of these he received terse answers.    Presently the Scotchman turned.    \"It's little you be knowin' of sheepin', sir.\"    The remark was made with so much simplicity that it could not have been  mistaken for rudeness.    \"Very little.\"    \"Keep it to yourself, man,\" was the laconic advice the Highlander tossed  over his shoulder as he transferred his attention to his horses.    Mr. Clark bit his lip to hide a smile.    \"What is your name, my lad?\" he asked suddenly.    \"Sandy McCulloch, sir,\" was the quiet answer.    Donald waited, listening eagerly to every turn of the conversation that  followed, but to his astonishment neither his father nor Sandy McCulloch  spoke one word regarding the mysterious telegram.    It was nightfall when the wagon that had brought them turned into a  muddy drive and stopped before a bare looking house situated in a  meadow, and surrounded by a number of vast barns and sheep-pens. Out of  this house came a broad-shouldered, bronzed man who stood on the steps,  waiting their approach. He wore trousers of sheepskin, a soiled flannel  shirt, and round his neck--knotted in the back--was a red handkerchief.  Donald noticed that into his belt of Mexican leather was tucked a  revolver. He stared at the strangers inquiringly.    Mr. Clark jumped out as soon as the wagon stopped, and extended his  hand.    \"I do not know your name,\" he said pleasantly, \"but mine is Clark. My  son Donald and I have come from Boston to see the ranch.\"    The man sprang forward.    \"I'm Tom Thornton, sir. What a pleasure to have a visit from you! Such  an unexpected visit, too.\"    He slapped Mr. Clark heartily on the shoulder and took Donald's hand in  a tight grip.    But though he talked loudly, and laughed a great deal while carrying in  their luggage, for some reason Donald felt certain that really Tom  Thornton was not glad to see them at all.    [Illustration]          Chapter II    WHO SANDY WAS      The next morning both Donald and his father were astir early.    There was nothing to keep them within the great chilly house, and  everything to lure them into the sunshine. The sky was without a cloud,  and into its blueness stretched distant ranges of hazy mountains at  whose feet nestled lower hills covered with faint green. Near at hand  patches of meadow were toned to grayish white by grazing bands of sheep.  On the still air came the flat, metallic note of herd-bells, and the  bleating of numberless unseen flocks within the pens and barns.    What a novel scene it was!    The newcomers found their way to a sheltered corner where they could  look out before them into the vastness.    It was all so strange, so interesting!    Somewhere in the ravine below they could catch the rushing music of a  stream which wove itself in and out a maze of rolling hills and was lost  at last in the shadows of the green valleys.    As they stood silent and drank in the beauty about them, an angry voice  broke the stillness.    It came from the interior of the barn near which they were standing.    \"I tell you what, Tom Thornton, I'm with Sandy McCulloch. The sheep  always were washed after shearing in Old Angus's day, and in Johnson's  as well. That is how Crescent Ranch came to have the good name it now  holds. There were no scabby sheep here to infect the rest of the herd.\"    \"What's that to you, Jack Owen? You are here to mind the boss, ain't  you? What's the use of our working like beavers for ten days to dip the  flock if we don't have to? Dipping is a dirty, tiresome job. You are not  in for making work for yourself, are you?\"    \"The flocks will be ruined!\"    \"What do you care--the"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/24869"],[0,"The Rámáyan of Válmíki, translated into English verse (#2)"],[1,"peech.
