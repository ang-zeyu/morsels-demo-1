The decrees of the Convention were  everywhere received with submission. London, true during fifty eventful  years to the cause of civil freedom and of the reformed religion, was  foremost in professing loyalty to the new Sovereigns. Garter King at  arms, after making proclamation under the windows of Whitehall, rode in  state along the Strand to Temple Bar. He was followed by the maces of  the two Houses, by the two Speakers, Halifax and Powle, and by a long  train of coaches filled with noblemen and gentlemen. The magistrates  of the City threw open their gates and joined the procession. Four  regiments of militia lined the way up Ludgate Hill, round Saint Paul's  Cathedral, and along Cheapside. The streets, the balconies, and the very  housetops were crowded with gazers. All the steeples from the Abbey to  the Tower sent forth a joyous din. The proclamation was repeated, with  sound of trumpet, in front of the Royal Exchange, amidst the shouts of  the citizens.    In the evening every window from Whitechapel to Piccadilly was lighted  up. The state rooms of the palace were thrown open, and were filled by a  gorgeous company of courtiers desirous to kiss the hands of the King and  Queen. The Whigs assembled there, flushed with victory and prosperity.  There were among them some who might be pardoned if a vindictive feeling  mingled with their joy. The most deeply injured of all who had survived  the evil times was absent. Lady Russell, while her friends were crowding  the galleries of Whitehall, remained in her retreat, thinking of one  who, if he had been still living, would have held no undistinguished  place in the ceremonies of that great day. But her daughter, who had a  few months before become the wife of Lord Cavendish, was presented to  the royal pair by his mother the Countess of Devonshire. A letter is  still extant in which the young lady described with great vivacity  the roar of the populace, the blaze in the streets, the throng in the  presence chamber, the beauty of Mary, and the expression which ennobled  and softened the harsh features of William. But the most interesting  passage is that in which the orphan girl avowed the stern delight with  which she had witnessed the tardy punishment of her father's murderer.  [1]    The example of London was followed by the provincial towns. During three  weeks the Gazettes were filled with accounts of the solemnities by which  the public joy manifested itself, cavalcades of gentlemen and yeomen,  processions of Sheriffs and Bailiffs in scarlet gowns, musters of  zealous Protestants with orange flags and ribands, salutes, bonfires,  illuminations, music, balls, dinners, gutters running with ale and  conduits spouting claret. [2]    Still more cordial was the rejoicing among the Dutch, when they learned  that the first minister of their Commonwealth had been raised to a  throne. On the very day of his accession he had written to assure the  States General that the change in his situation had made no change in  the affection which he bore to his native land, and that his new dignity  would, he hoped, enable him to discharge his old duties more efficiently  than ever. That oligarchical party, which had always been hostile to the  doctrines of Calvin and to the House of Orange, muttered faintly that  His Majesty ought to resign the Stadtholdership. But all such mutterings  were drowned by the acclamations of a people proud of the genius and  success of their great countryman. A day of thanksgiving was appointed.  In all the cities of the Seven Provinces the public joy manifested  itself by festivities of which the expense was chiefly defrayed by  voluntary gifts. Every class assisted. The poorest labourer could help  to set up an arch of triumph, or to bring sedge to a bonfire. Even the  ruined Huguenots of France could contribute the aid of their ingenuity.  One art which they had carried with them into banishment was the art of  making fireworks; and they now, in honour of the victorious champion of  their faith, lighted up the canals of Amsterdam with showers of splendid  constellations. [3]    To superficial observers it might well seem that William was, at this  time, one of the most enviable of human beings. He was in truth one of  the most anxious and unhappy. He well knew that the difficulties of his  task were only beginning. Already that dawn which had lately been so  bright was overcast; and many signs portended a dark and stormy day.    It was observed that two important classes took little or no part in  the festivities by which, all over England, the inauguration of the  new government was celebrated. Very seldom could either a priest or  a soldier be seen in the assemblages which gathered round the market  crosses where the King and Queen were proclaimed. The professional pride  both of the clergy and of the army had been deeply wounded. The doctrine  of nonresistance had been dear to the Anglican divines. It was their  distinguishing badge. It was their favourite theme. If we are to judge  by that portion of their oratory which has come down to us, they had  preached about the duty of passive obedience at least as often and as  zealously as about the Trinity or the Atonement. [4] Their attachment to  their political creed had indeed been severely tried, and had, during  a short time, wavered. But with the tyranny of James the bitter feeling  which that tyranny had excited among them had passed away. The parson  of a parish was naturally unwilling to join in what was really a triumph  over those principles which, during twenty-eight years, his flock had  heard him proclaim on every anniversary of the Martyrdom and on every  anniversary of"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/2613"],[0,"The History of England, from the Accession of James II â€” Volume 4 (#2)"],[1,"Meetings of Portland and Boufflers  Terms of Peace between France and England settled  Difficulties caused by Spain and the Emperor  Attempts of James to prevent a general Pacification  The Treaty of Ryswick signed; Anxiety in England  News of the Peace arrives in England  Dismay of the Jacobites  General Rejoicing  The King's Entry into London  The Thanksgiving Day            CHAPTER XVII     William's Voyage to Holland--William's Entrance into the Hague--Congress   at the Hague--William his own Minister for Foreign Affairs--William   obtains a Toleration for the Waldenses; Vices inherent in the Nature of   Coalitions--Siege and Fall of Mons--William returns to England; Trials   of Preston and Ashton--Execution of Ashton--Preston's Irresolution   and Confessions--Lenity shown to the Conspirators--Dartmouth--Turner;   Penn--Death of George Fox; his Character--Interview between Penn and   Sidney--Preston pardoned--Joy of the Jacobites at the Fall of Mons--The   vacant Sees filled--Tillotson Archbishop of Canterbury--Conduct of   Sancroft--Difference between Sancroft and Ken--Hatred of Sancroft to the   Established Church; he provides for the episcopal Succession among the   Nonjurors--The new Bishops--Sherlock Dean of Saint Paul's--Treachery   of some of William's Servants--Russell--Godolphin--Marlborough--William   returns to the Continent--The Campaign of 1691 in Flanders--The War   in Ireland; State of the English Part of Ireland--State of the Part   of Ireland which was subject to James--Dissensions among the Irish at   Limerick--Return of Tyrconnel to Ireland--Arrival of a French Fleet at   Limerick; Saint Ruth--The English take the Field--Fall of Ballymore;   Siege and Fall of Athlone--Retreat of the Irish Army--Saint Ruth   determines to fight--Battle of Aghrim--Fall of Galway--Death   of Tyrconnel--Second Siege of Limerick--The Irish desirous to   capitulate--Negotiations between the Irish Chiefs and the Besiegers--The   Capitulation of Limerick--The Irish Troops required to make their   Election between their Country and France--Most of the Irish Troops   volunteer for France--Many of the Irish who had volunteered for   France desert--The last Division of the Irish Army sails from Cork for   France--State of Ireland after the War    ON the eighteenth of January 1691, the King, having been detained some  days by adverse winds, went on board at Gravesend. Four yachts had  been fitted up for him and for his retinue. Among his attendants were  Norfolk, Ormond, Devonshire, Dorset, Portland, Monmouth, Zulestein, and  the Bishop of London. Two distinguished admirals, Cloudesley Shovel  and George Rooke, commanded the men of war which formed the convoy. The  passage was tedious and disagreeable. During many hours the fleet was  becalmed off the Godwin Sands; and it was not till the fifth day that  the soundings proved the coast of Holland to be near. The sea fog was  so thick that no land could be seen; and it was not thought safe for  the ships to proceed further in the darkness. William, tired out by the  voyage, and impatient to be once more in his beloved country, determined  to land in an open boat. The noblemen who were in his train tried to  dissuade him from risking so valuable a life; but, when they found that  his mind was made up, they insisted on sharing the danger. That danger  proved more serious than they had expected. It had been supposed that  in an hour the party would be on shore. But great masses of floating  ice impeded the progress of the skiff; the night came on; the fog grew  thicker; the waves broke over the King and the courtiers. Once the  keel struck on a sand bank, and was with great difficulty got off. The  hardiest mariners showed some signs of uneasiness. But William, through  the whole night, was as composed as if he had been in the drawingroom at  Kensington. \"For shame,\" he said to one of the dismayed sailors \"are  you afraid to die in my company?\" A bold Dutch seaman ventured to spring  out, and, with great difficulty, swam and scrambled through breakers,  ice and mud, to firm ground. Here he discharged a musket and lighted  a fire as a signal that he was safe. None of his fellow passengers,  however, thought it prudent to follow his example. They lay tossing in  sight of the flame which he had kindled, till the first pale light of a  January morning showed them that they were close to the island of Goree.  The King and his Lords, stiff with cold and covered with icicles, gladly  landed to warm and rest themselves. [1]    After reposing some hours in the hut of a peasant, William proceeded to  the Hague. He was impatiently expected there for, though the fleet which  brought him was not visible from the shore, the royal salutes had been  heard through the mist, and had apprised the whole coast of his arrival.  Thousands had assembled at Honslaerdyk to welcome him with applause  which came from their hearts and which went to his heart. That was one  of the few white days of a life, beneficent indeed and glorious, but  far from happy. After more than two years passed in a strange land, the  exile had again set foot on his native soil. He heard again the language  of his nursery. He saw again the scenery and the architecture which were  inseparably associated in his mind with the recollections of childhood  and the sacred feeling of home; the dreary mounds of sand, shells and  weeds, on which the waves of the German Ocean broke; the interminable  meadows intersected by trenches; the straight canals; the villas bright  with paint and adorned with quaint images and inscriptions. He had lived  during many weary months among a people who did not love him, who did  not understand him, who could never forget that he was a foreigner.  Those Englishmen who served him most faithfully served him without  enthusiasm, without personal attachment, and merely from a sense of  public duty. In their hearts they were sorry that they had no choice but  between an English tyrant and a Dutch deliverer. All was now changed.  William was among a population by which he was adored, as Elizabeth had  been adored when she rode through her army at Tilbury, as Charles the  Second had been adored when he landed at Dover. It is true that the old  enemies of the House of Orange had not been inactive during the absence  of the Stadtholder. There had been, not indeed clamours, but mutterings  against him. He had, it was said, neglected his native land for his  new kingdom. Whenever the dignity of the English flag, whenever the  prosperity of the English trade was concerned, he forgot that he was a  Hollander. But, as soon as his well remembered face was again seen,  all jealousy, all coldness, was at an end. There was not a boor, not  a fisherman, not an artisan, in the crowds which lined the road from  Honslaerdyk to the Hague, whose heart did not swell with pride at the  thought that the first minister of Holland had become a great King,  had freed the English, and had conquered the Irish. It would have been  madness in William to travel from Hampton Court to Westminster without  a guard; but in his own land he needed no swords or carbines to defend  him. \"Do not keep the people off;\" he cried: \"let them come close to  me; they are all my good friends.\" He soon learned that sumptuous  preparations were making for his entrance into the Hague. At first he  murmured and objected. He detested, he said, noise and display. The  necessary cost of the war was quite heavy enough. He hoped that his kind  fellow townsmen would consider him as a neighbour, born and bred  among them, and would not pay him so bad a compliment as to treat him  ceremoniously. But all his expostulations were vain. The Hollanders,  simple and parsimonious as their ordinary habits were, had set their  hearts on giving their illustrious countryman a reception suited to his  dignity and to his merit; and he found it necessary to yield. On the day  of his triumph the concourse was immense. All the wheeled carriages  and horses of the province were too few for the multitude of those who  flocked to the show. Many thousands came sliding or skating along the  frozen canals from Amsterdam, Rotterdam, Leyden, Haarlem, Delft. At ten  in the morning of the twenty-sixth of January, the great bell of the  Town House gave the signal. Sixteen hundred substantial burghers, well  armed, and clad in the finest dresses which were to be found in  the recesses of their wardrobes, kept order in the crowded streets.  Balconies and scaffolds, embowered in evergreens and hung with tapestry,  hid the windows. The royal coach, escorted by an army of halberdiers  and running footmen, and followed by a long train of splendid equipages,  passed under numerous arches rich with carving and painting, amidst  incessant shouts of \"Long live the King our Stadtholder.\" The front of  the Town House and the whole circuit of the marketplace were in a blaze  with brilliant colours. Civic crowns, trophies, emblems of arts, of  sciences, of commerce and of agriculture, appeared every where. In one  place William saw portrayed the glorious actions of his ancestors. There  was the silent prince, the founder of the Batavian commonwealth, passing  the Meuse with his warriors. There was the more impetuous Maurice  leading the charge at Nieuport. A little further on, the hero might  retrace the eventful story of his own life. He was a child at his  widowed mother's knee. He was at the altar with Diary's hand in his. He  was landing at Torbay. He was swimming through the Boyne. There, too,  was a boat amidst the ice and the breakers; and above it was most  appropriately inscribed, in the majestic language of Rome, the saying of  the great Roman, \"What dost thou fear? Thou hast Caesar on board.\" The  task of furnishing the Latin mottoes had been intrusted to two men,  who, till Bentley appeared, held the highest place among the classical  scholars of that age.
