[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/26457"],[0,"New observations on the natural history of bees (#2)"],[1,"obtained  exactly the same results as in the thinnest. Thus, I think, already to  have obviated any objections that may arise concerning the supposed  inconvenience of flat hives. Besides, I cannot regret the repetition of  my labours; by going over the same course several times, I am much more  certain of having avoided error; and it also appears, that some  advantages are found in these which may be called _Book_ or  _Leaf-hives_, as they prove extremely useful in the economical treatment  of bees, which shall afterwards be detailed.    I now come to the particular object of this letter, the fecundation of  the queen bee; and I shall, in a few words, examine the different  opinions of naturalists on this singular problem. Next I shall state the  most remarkable observations which their conjectures have induced me to  make, and then describe the new experiments by which I think I have  solved the problem{C}.    Swammerdam, who studied bees with unremitting attention, and who never  could see a real copulation between a drone and a queen, was satisfied  that copulation was unnecessary for fecundation of the eggs: but having  remarked that, at certain times, the drones exhaled a very strong odour,  he thought this odour was an emanation of the _aura seminalis_, or the  _aura seminalis_ itself, which operated fecundation by penetrating the  body of the female. His conjecture was confirmed on dissecting the male  organs of generation; for he was so much struck with the disproportion  between them and those of the female, that he did not believe copulation  possible. His opinion, concerning the influence of the odour, had this  farther advantage, that it afforded a good reason for the prodigious  number of the males. There are frequently fifteen hundred or two  thousand in a hive; and, according to Swammerdam, it is necessary they  should be numerous, that the emanation proceeding from them may have an  intensity or energy sufficient to effect impregnation.    Though M. de Reaumur has refuted this hypothesis by just and conclusive  reasoning, he has failed to make the sole experiment that could support  or overturn it. This was to confine all the drones of a hive in a tin  case, perforated with minute holes, which might allow the emanation of  the odour to escape, but prevent the organs of generation from passing  through. Then, this case should have been placed in a hive well  inhabited, but completely deprived of males, both of large and small  size, and the consequence attended to. It is evident, had the queen laid  eggs after matters were thus disposed, that Swammerdam's hypothesis  would have acquired probability; and on the contrary it would have been  confuted had she produced no eggs, or only sterile ones. However the  experiment has been made by us, and the queen remained barren;  therefore, it is undoubted, that the emanation of the odour of the males  does not impregnate bees.    M. de Reaumur was of a different opinion. He thought that the queen's  fecundation followed actual copulation. He confined several drones in a  glass vessel along with a virgin queen: he saw the female make many  advances to the males; but, unable to observe any union so intimate  that it could be denominated copulation, he leaves the question  undecided. We have repeated this experiment: we have frequently confined  virgin queens with drones of all ages: we have done so at every season,  and witnessed all their advances and solicitations to the males: we have  even believed we saw a kind of union between them, but so short and  imperfect that it was unlikely to effect impregnation. Yet, to neglect  nothing, we confined the virgin queen, that had suffered the approaches  of the male, to her hive. During a month that her imprisonment  continued, she did not lay a single egg; therefore, these momentary  junctions do not accomplish fecundation.    In the _Contemplation de la Nature_, you have cited the observations of  the English naturalist Mr Debraw. They appear correct, and at last to  elucidate the mystery. Favoured by chance, the observer one day  perceived at the bottom of cells containing eggs, a whitish fluid,  apparently spermatic, at least, very different from the substance or  jelly which bees commonly collect around their new hatched worms.  Solicitous to learn its origin, and conjecturing that it might be the  male prolific fluid, he began to watch the motions of every drone in the  hive, on purpose to seize the moment when they would bedew the eggs. He  assures us, that he saw several insinuate the posterior part of the body  into the cells, and there deposit the fluid. After frequent repetition  of the first, he entered on a long series of experiments. He confined a  number of workers in glass bells along with a queen and several males.  They were supplied with pieces of comb containing honey, but no brood.  He saw the queen lay eggs, which were bedewed by the males, and from  which larvae were hatched, consequently, he could not hesitate advancing  as a fact demonstrated, that male bees fecundate the queen's eggs in  the manner of frogs and fishes, that is, after they are produced.    There was something very specious in this explanation: the experiments  on which it was founded seemed correct; and it afforded a satisfactory  reason for the prodigious number of males in a hive. At the same time,  the author had neglected to answer one strong objection. Larvae appear  when there are no drones. From the month of September until April, hives  are generally destitute of males, yet, notwithstanding their absence,  the queen then lays fertile eggs. Thus, the prolific fluid cannot be  required to impregnate them, unless we can suppose that it is necessary  at a certain time of the year, while at every other season it is  useless.    To discover the truth amidst these facts apparently so contradictory, I  wished to repeat Mr Debraw's experiments, and to observe more precaution  than he himself had done. First, I sought for the fluid, which he  supposes the seminal, in cells containing eggs. Several were actually  found with that appearance; and, during the first days of observation,  neither my assistant nor myself doubted the reality of the discovery.  But we afterwards found it an illusion arising from the reflection of  the light, for nothing like a fluid was visible, except when the solar  rays reached the bottom of the cells. Fragments of the coccoons of  worms, successively hatched, commonly cover the bottom; and, as they are  shining, it may easily be conceived that, when much illuminated, an  illusory effect results from the light. We proved it by the strictest  examination, for no vestiges of a fluid were perceptible when the cells  were detached and cut asunder.    Though the first observation inspired us with some distrust of Mr  Debraw's discovery, we repeated his other experiments with the utmost  care. On the 6. of August 1787, we immersed a hive, and, with scrupulous  attention, examined the whole bees while in the bath. We ascertained  that there was no male, either large or small; and having examined all  the combs, we found neither male nymph, nor worm. When the bees were  dry, we replaced them all, along with the queen, in their habitation,  and transported them into my cabinet. They were allowed full liberty;  therefore, they flew about, and made their usual collections; but, it  being necessary that no male should enter the hive during the  experiment, a glass tube was adapted to the entrance, of such dimensions  that two bees only could pass at once; and we watched the tube  attentively during the four or five days that the experiment continued.  We should have instantly observed and removed any male that appeared,  that the result of the experiment might be undisturbed, and I can  positively affirm that not one was seen. However, from the first day,  which was the sixth of August, the queen deposited fourteen eggs in the  workers cells; and all these were hatched on the tenth of the same  month.    This experiment is decisive, since the eggs laid by the queen of a hive  where there were no males, and where it was impossible one could be  introduced, since these eggs, I say, were fertile, it becomes  indubitable that the fluid of the males is not required for their  exclusion.    Though it did not appear that any reasonable objection could be started  against this conclusion, yet, as I had been accustomed in all my  experiments to seek for the most trifling difficulties that could arise,  I conceived that Mr Debraw's partisans might maintain, that the bees,  deprived of drones, perhaps would search for those in other hives, and  carry the fecundative fluid to their own habitations for depositing it  on the eggs.    It was easy to appreciate the force of this objection, for all that was  necessary was a repetition of the former experiments, and to confine the  bees so closely to their hives that none could possibly escape. You  very well know, Sir, that these animals can live three or four months  confined in a hive well stored with honey and wax, and if apertures are  left for circulation of the air. This experiment was made on the tenth  of August; and I ascertained, by means of immersion, that no male was  present. The bees were confined four days in the closest manner, and  then I found forty young larvae.    I extended the precautions so far as to immerse this hive a second time,  to assure myself that no male had escaped my researches. Each of the  bees was separately examined, and none was there that did not display  its sting. The coincidence of this experiment with the other, proved  that the eggs were not externally fecundated.    In terminating the confutation of Mr Debraw's opinion, I have only to  explain what led him into error; and that was, his using queens whose  history he was unacquainted with from their origin. When he observed  the eggs produced by a queen, confined along with "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/26477"],[0,"Observations on the Florid Song; Or, Sentiments on the Ancient and Modern (#2)"],[1,"Canentium  Cithara & Organo_, the Father of all such as handle the Harp and Organ;  Instruments, in all Probability consisting of several harmonious Sounds;  from whence one may infer, Musick to have had its Birth very soon after  the World.    Sec. 2. To secure her from erring, she called to her Assistance many  Precepts of the Mathematicks; and from the Demonstrations of her  Beauties, by Means of Lines, Numbers, and Proportions, she was adopted  her Child, and became a Science.    Sec. 3. It may reasonably be supposed that, during the Course of several  thousand Years, Musick has always been the Delight of Mankind; since the  excessive Pleasure, the _Lacedemonians_ received from it, induced that  Republick to exile the abovementioned _Milesian_, that the _Spartans_,  freed from their Effeminacy, might return again to their old Oeconomy.    Sec. 4. But, I believe, she never appeared with so much Majesty as in the  last Centuries, in the great Genius of _Palestrina_, whom she left as an  immortal Example to Posterity. And, in Truth, Musick, with the Sweetness  of _his_ Harmony, arrived at so high a Pitch (begging Pardon of the  eminent Masters of our Days), that if she was ranked only in the Number  of Liberal Arts, she might with Justice contest the Pre-eminence[1].    Sec. 5. A strong Argument offers itself to me, from that wonderful  Impression, that in so distinguished a Manner is made upon our Souls by  Musick, beyond all other Arts; which leads us to believe that it is part  of that Blessedness which is enjoyed in Paradise.    Sec. 6. Having premised these Advantages, the Merit of the Singer should  likewise be distinguished, by reason of the particular Difficulties that  attend him: Let a Singer have a Fund of Knowledge sufficient to perform  readily any of the most difficult Compositions; let him have, besides,  an excellent Voice, and know how to use it artfully; he will not, for  all that, deserve a Character of Distinction, if he is wanting in a  prompt Variation; a Difficulty which other Arts are not liable to.    Sec. 7. Finally, I say, that Poets[2], Painters, Sculptors, and even  Composers of Musick, before they expose their Works to the Publick, have  all the Time requisite to mend and polish them; but the Singer that  commits an Error has no Remedy; for the Fault is committed, and past  Correction.    Sec. 8. We may then guess at but cannot describe, how great the Application  must be of one who is obliged not to err, in unpremeditated Productions;  and to manage a Voice, always in Motion, conformable to the Rules of an  Art that is so difficult. I confess ingeniously, that every time I  reflect on the Insufficiency of many Masters, and the infinite Abuses  they introduce, which render the Application and Study of their Scholars  ineffectual, I cannot but wonder, that among so many Professors of the  first Rank, who have written so amply on Musick in almost all its  Branches, there has never been one, at least that I have heard of, who  has undertaken to explain in the Art of Singing, any thing more than the  first Elements, known to all, concealing the most necessary Rules for  Singing well. It is no Excuse to say, that the Composers intent on  Composition, the Performers on Instruments intent on their Performance,  should not meddle with what concerns the Singer; for I know some very  capable to undeceive those who may think so. The incomparable _Zarlino_,  in the third part of his Harmonick Institution, chap. 46, just began to  inveigh against those, who in his time sung with some Defects, but he  stopped; and I am apt to believe had he gone farther, his Documents,  though grown musty in two Centuries, might be of Service to the refined  Taste of this our present time. But a more just Reproof is due to the  Negligence of many celebrated Singers, who, having a superior Knowledge,  can the less justify their Silence, even under the Title of Modesty,  which ceases to be a Virtue, when it deprives the Publick of an  Advantage. Moved therefore, not by a vain Ambition, but by the Hopes of  being of Service to several Professors, I have determined, not without  Reluctance, to be the first to expose to the Eye of the World these my  few Observations; my only End being (if I succeed) to give farther  Insight to the Master, the Scholar, and the Singer.    Sec. 9. I will in the first Place, endeavour to shew the Duty of a Master,  how to instruct a Beginner well; secondly, what is required of the  Scholar; and, lastly, with more mature Reflections, to point out the way  to a moderate Singer, by which he may arrive at greater Perfection.  Perhaps my Enterprize may be term'd rash, but if the Effects should not  answer my Intentions, I shall at least incite some other to treat of it  in a more ample and correct Manner.    Sec. 10. If any should say, I might be dispensed with for not publishing  Things already known to every Professor, he might perhaps deceive  himself; for among these Observations there are many, which as I have  never heard them made by anybody else, I shall look upon as my own; and  such probably they are, from their not being generally known. Let them  therefore take their Chance, for the Approbation of those that have  Judgment and Taste.    Sec. 11. It would be needless to say, that verbal Instructions can be of no  Use to Singers, any farther than to prevent 'em from falling into  Errors, and that it is Practice only can set them right. However, from  the Success of these, I shall be encouraged to go on to make new  Discoveries for the Advantage of the Profession, or (asham'd, but not  surpriz'd) I will bear it patiently, if Masters with their Names to  their Criticism should kindly publish my Ignorance, that I may be  undeceiv'd, and thank them.    Sec. 12. But though it is my Design to Demonstrate a great Number of  Abuses and Defects of the Moderns to be met with in the Republick of  Musick, in order that they may be corrected (if they can); I would not  have those, who for want of Genius, or through Negligence in their  Study, could not, or would not improve themselves, imagine that out of  Malice I have painted all their Imperfections to the Life; for I  solemnly protest, that though from my too great Zeal I attack their  Errors without Ceremony, I have a Respect for their Persons; having  learned from a _Spanish_ Proverb, that Calumny recoils back on the  Author. But Christianity says something more. I speak in general; but if  sometimes I am more particular, let it be known, that I copy from no  other Original than myself, where there has been, and still is Matter  enough to criticize, without looking for it elsewhere.          CHAP. I.    OBSERVATIONS _for one who teaches a_ Soprano.[3]      The Faults in Singing insinuate themselves so easily into the Minds of  young Beginners, and there are such Difficulties in correcting them,  when grown into an Habit that it were to be wish'd, the ablest Singers  would undertake the Task of Teaching, they best knowing how to conduct  the Scholar from the first Elements to Perfection. But there being none,  (if I mistake not) but who abhor the Thoughts of it, we must reserve  them for those Delicacies of the Art, which enchant the Soul.    Sec. 2. Therefore the first Rudiments necessarily fall to a Master of a  lower Rank, till the Scholar can sing his part at Sight; whom one would  at least wish to be an honest Man, diligent and experienced, without the  Defects of singing through the Nose, or in the Throat, and that he have  a Command of Voice, some Glimpse of a good Taste, able to make himself  understood with Ease, a perfect Intonation, and a Patience to endure the  severe Fatigue of a most tiresome Employment.    Sec. 3. Let a Master thus qualified before he begins his Instructions, read  the four Verses of _Virgil_, _Sic vos non vobis_, &c.[5] for they seem  to be made[4] on Purpose for him, and after having considered them  well, let him consult his Resolution; because (to speak plainly) it is  mortifying to help another to Affluence, and be in want of it himself.  If the Singer should make his Fortune, it is but just the Master, to  whom it has been owing, should be also a Sharer in it.    Sec. 4. But above all, let him hear with a disinterested Ear, whether the  Person desirous to learn hath a Voice, and a Disposition; that he may  not be obliged to give a strict Account to God, of the Parent's Money  ill spent, and the Injury done to the Child, by the irreparable Loss of  Time, which might have been more profitably employed in some other  Profession. I do not speak at random. The ancient Masters made a  Distinction between the Rich, that learn'd Musick as an Accomplishment,  and the Poor, who studied it for a Livelihood. The first they instructed  out of Interest, and the latter out of Charity, if they discovered a  singular Talent. Very few modern Masters refuse Scholars; and, provided  they are paid, little do they care if their greediness ruins the  Profession.    Sec. 5. Gentlemen Masters! _Italy_ hears no more such exquisite Voices as  in Times past, particularly among the Women, and to the Shame of the  Guilty I'll tell the Reason: The Ignorance of the Parents does not let  them perceive the Badness of the Voice of their Children, as their  Necessity makes them believe, that to sing and grow rich is one and the  same Thing, and to learn Musick, it is enough to have a pretty Face:  \"_Can you make anything of her?_\"    Sec. 6. You may, perhaps, teach them with their Voice----Modesty will not  permit me to explain myself farther.    Sec. 7. The Master must want Humanity, if he advises a Scholar to do any  thing to the Prejudice of the Soul.    Sec. 8. From the first Lesson to the last, let the Master remember, that he  is answerable for any Omission in his Instructions, and for the Errors  he did not correct.    Sec. 9. Let him be moderately severe, making himself fear'd, but not hated.  I know, it is not easy to find "]]]
