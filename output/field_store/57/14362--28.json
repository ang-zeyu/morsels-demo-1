[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/2745"],[0,"Karl Ludwig Sand (#2)"],[1," the character of the child what was that of the man. Besides, we  shall see him develop, always calm and superior amid small events as  amid large ones.    About the same time Sand escaped almost miraculously from two dangers.  One day a hod full of plaster fell from a scaffold and broke at his  feet. Another day the Price of Coburg, who during the King of Prussia's  stay at the baths of Alexander, was living in the house of Sand's  parents, was galloping home with four horses when he came suddenly upon  young Karl in a gateway; he could not escape either on the right or the  left, without running the risk of being crushed between the wall and the  wheels, and the coachman could not, when going at such a pace, hold in  his horses: Sand flung himself on his face, and the carriage passed over  him without his receiving so much as a single scratch either from the  horses or the wheels. From that moment many people regarded him as  predestined, and said that the hand of God was upon him.    Meanwhile political events were developing themselves around the boy,  and their seriousness made him a man before the age of manhood. Napoleon  weighed upon Germany like another Sennacherib. Staps had tried to play  the part of Mutius Scaevola, and had died a martyr. Sand was at Hof at  that time, and was a student of the gymnasium of which his good tutor  Salfranck was the head. He learned that the man whom he regarded as the  antichrist was to come and review the troops in that town; he left it at  once and went home to his parents, who asked him for what reason he had  left the gymnasium.    \"Because I could not have been in the same town with Napoleon,\" he  answered, \"without trying to kill him, and I do not feel my hand strong  enough for that yet.\"    This happened in 1809; Sand was fourteen years old. Peace, which was  signed an the 15th of October, gave Germany some respite, and allowed  the young fanatic to resume his studies without being distracted by  political considerations; but in 1811 he was occupied by them again,  when he learned that the gymnasium was to be dissolved and its place  taken by a primary school. To this the rector Salfranck was appointed as  a teacher, but instead of the thousand florins which his former  appointment brought him, the new one was worth only five hundred. Karl  could not remain in a primary school where he could not continue his  education; he wrote to his mother to announce this event and to tell her  with what equanimity the old German philosopher had borne it. Here is  the answer of Sand's mother; it will serve to show the character of the  woman whose mighty heart never belied itself in the midst of the  severest suffering; the answer bears the stamp of that German mysticism  of which we have no idea in France:--    \"MY DEAR KARL,--You could not have given me a more grievous piece of  news than that of the event which has just fallen upon your tutor and  father by adoption; nevertheless, terrible though it may be, do not  doubt that he will resign himself to it, in order to give to the virtue  of his pupils a great example of that submission which every subject  owes to the king wham God has set over him. Furthermore, be well assured  that in this world there is no other upright and well calculated policy  than that which grows out of the old precept, 'Honour God, be just and  fear not.' And reflect also that when injustice against the worthy  becomes crying, the public voice makes itself heard, and uplifts those  who are cast down.    \"But if, contrary to all probability, this did not happen,--if God  should impose this sublime probation upon the virtue of our friend, if  the world were to disown him and Providence were to became to that,  degree his debtor,--yet in that case there are, believe me, supreme  compensations: all the things and all the events that occur around us  and that act upon us are but machines set in motion by a Higher Hand, so  as to complete our education for a higher world, in which alone we shall  take our true place. Apply yourself, therefore, my dear child, to watch  over yourself unceasingly and always, so that you may not take great and  fine isolated actions for real virtue, and may be ready every moment to  do all that your duty may require of you. Fundamentally nothing is  great, you see, and nothing small, when things are, looked at apart from  one another, and it is only the putting of things together that produces  the unity of evil or of good.    \"Moreover, God only sends the trial to the heart where He has put  strength, and the manner in which you tell me that your master has borne  the misfortune that has befallen him is a fresh proof of this great and  eternal truth. You must form yourself upon him, my dear child, and if  you are obliged to leave Hof for Bamberg you must resign yourself to it  courageously. Man has three educations: that which he receives from his  parents, that which circumstances impose upon him, and lastly that which  he gives himself; if that misfortune should occur, pray to God that you  may yourself worthily complete that last education, the most important  of all.    \"I will give you as an example the life and conduct of my father, of  whom you have not heard very much, for he died before you were born, but  whose mind and likeness are reproduced in you only among all your  brothers and sisters. The disastrous fire which reduced his native town  to ashes destroyed his fortune and that of his relatives; grief at  having lost everything--for the fire broke out in the next house to  his--cost his father his life; and while his mother, who for six years  had been stretched an a bed of pain, where horrible convulsions held her  fast, supported her three little girls by the needlework that she did in  the intervals of suffering, he went as a mere clerk into one of the  leading mercantile houses of Augsburg, where his lively and yet even  temper made him welcome; there he learned a calling, for which, however,  he was not naturally adapted, and came back to the home of his birth  with a pure and stainless heart, in order to be the support of his  mother and his sisters.    \"A man can do much when he wishes to do much: join your efforts to my  prayers, and leave the rest in the hands of God.\"    The prediction of this Puritan woman was fulfilled: a little time  afterwards rector Salfranck was appointed professor at Richembourg,  whither Sand followed him; it was there that the events of 1813 found  him. In the month of March he wrote to his mother:--    \"I can scarcely, dear mother, express to you how calm and happy I begin  to feel since I am permitted to believe in the enfranchisement of my  country, of which I hear on every side as being so near at hand,--of  that country which, in my faith in God, I see beforehand free and  mighty, that country for whose happiness I would undergo the greatest  sufferings, and even death. Take strength for this crisis. If by chance  it should reach our good province, lift your eyes to the Almighty, then  carry them back to beautiful rich nature. The goodness of God which  preserved and protected so many men during the disastrous Thirty Years'  War can do and will do now what it could and did then. As for me, I  believe and hope.\"    Leipzig came to justify Sand's presentiments; then the year 1814  arrived, and he thought Germany free.    On the 10th of December in the same year he left Richembourg with this  certificate from his master:--    \"Karl Sand belongs to the small number of those elect young men who are  distinguished at once by the gifts of the mind and the faculties of the  soul; in application and work he surpasses all his fellow-students, and  this fact explains his rapid progress in all the philosophical and  philological sciences; in mathematics only there are still some further  studies which he might pursue. The most affectionate wishes of his  teacher follow him on his departure.    \"J. A. KEYN, \"Rector, and master of the first class. \"Richembourg, Sept.  15, 1814\"    But it was really the parents of Sand, and in particular his mother, who  had prepared the fertile soil in which his teachers had sowed the seeds  of learning; Sand knew this well, for at the moment of setting out for  the university of Tubingen, where he was about to complete the  theological studies necessary for becoming a pastor, as he desired to  do, he wrote to them:--    \"I confess that, like all my brothers and sisters, I owe to you that  beautiful and great part of my education which I have seen to be lacking  to most of those around me. Heaven alone can reward you by a conviction  of having so nobly and grandly fulfilled your parental duties, amid many  others.\"    After having paid a visit to his brother at St. Gall, Sand reached  Tubingen, to which he had been principally attracted by the reputation  of Eschenmayer; he spent that winter quietly, and no other incident  befell than his admission into an association of Burschen, called the  Teutonic; then came tester of 1815, and with it the terrible news that  Napoleon had landed in the Gulf of Juan. Immediately all the youth of  Germany able to bear arms gathered once more around the banners of 1813  and 1814. Sand followed the general example; but the action, which in  others was an effect of enthusiasm, was in him the result of calm and  deliberate resolution. He wrote to Wonsiedel on this occasion:--    \"April 22, 1813    \"MY DEAR PARENTS,--Until now you have found me submissive to your  parental lessons and to the advice of my excellent masters; until now I  have made efforts to render myself worthy of the education that God has  sent me through you, and have applied myself to become capable of  spreading the word of the Lord through my native land; and for this  reason I can to-day declare to you sincerely the decision that I lave  taken, assured that as tender and affectionate parents you will calm  yourselves, and as German parents"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/2746"],[0,"Urbain Grandier (#2)"],[1," every one of whom was  absorbed in the attempt to make himself so agreeable that his name would  appear in Barot's will. This being so, the mocking words which were  rained down on Barot spattered not only himself but also all those who  had sided with him in the quarrel, and thus added considerably to the  tale of Urbain's enemies.    About this epoch a still graver event took place. Amongst the most  assiduous frequenters of the confessional in his church was a young and  pretty girl, Julie by name, the daughter of the king's attorney,  Trinquant--Trinquant being, as well as Barot, an uncle of Mignon. Now it  happened that this young girl fell into such a state of debility that  she was obliged to keep her room. One of her friends, named Marthe  Pelletier, giving up society, of which she was very fond, undertook to  nurse the patient, and carried her devotion so far as to shut herself up  in the same room with her. When Julie Trinquant had recovered and was  able again to take her place in the world, it came out that Marthe  Pelletier, during her weeks of retirement, had given birth to a child,  which had been baptized and then put out to nurse. Now, by one of those  odd whims which so often take possession of the public mind, everyone in  Loudun persisted in asserting that the real mother of the infant was not  she who had acknowledged herself as such--that, in short, Marthe  Pelletier had sold her good name to her friend Julie for a sum of money;  and of course it followed as a matter about which there could be no  possible doubt, that Urbain was the father.    Trinquant hearing of the reports about his daughter, took upon himself  as king's attorney to have Marthe Pelletier arrested and imprisoned.  Being questioned about the child, she insisted that she was its mother,  and would take its maintenance upon herself. To have brought a child  into the world under such circumstances was a sin, but not a crime;  Trinquant was therefore obliged to set Marthe at liberty, and the abuse  of justice of which he was guilty served only to spread the scandal  farther and to strengthen the public in the belief it had taken up.    Hitherto, whether through the intervention of the heavenly powers, or by  means of his own cleverness, Urbain Grandier had come out victor in  every struggle in which he had engaged, but each victor had added to the  number of his enemies, and these were now so numerous that any other  than he would have been alarmed, and have tried either to conciliate  them or to take precautions against their malice; but Urbain, wrapped in  his pride, and perhaps conscious of his innocence, paid no attention to  the counsels of his most faithful followers, but went on his way  unheeding.    All the opponents whom till now Urbain had encountered had been entirely  unconnected with each other, and had each struggled for his own  individual ends. Urbain's enemies, believing that the cause of his  success was to be found in the want of cooperation among themselves, now  determined to unite in order to crush him. In consequence, a conference  was held at Barot's, at which, besides Barot himself, Meunier,  Trinquant, and Mignon took part, and the latter had also brought with  him one Menuau, a king's counsel and his own most intimate friend, who  was, however, influenced by other motives than friendship in joining the  conspiracy. The fact was, that Menuau was in love with a woman who had  steadfastly refused to show him any favour, and he had got firmly fixed  in his head that the reason for her else inexplicable indifference and  disdain was that Urbain had been beforehand with him in finding an  entrance to her heart. The object of the meeting was to agree as to the  best means of driving the common enemy out of Loudon and its  neighbourhood.    Urbain's life was so well ordered that it presented little which his  enemies could use as a handle for their purpose. His only foible seemed  to be a predilection for female society; while in return all the wives  and daughters of the place, with the unerring instinct of their sex,  seeing, that the new priest was young, handsome, and eloquent, chose  him, whenever it was possible, as their spiritual director. As this  preference had already offended many husbands and fathers, the decision  the conspirators arrived at was that on this side alone was Grandier  vulnerable, and that their only chance of success was to attack him  where he was weakest. Almost at once, therefore, the vague reports which  had been floating about began to attain a certain definiteness: there  were allusions made, though no name was mentioned, to a young girl in  Loudun; who in spite of Grandier's frequent unfaithfulness yet remained  his mistress-in-chief; then it began to be whispered that the young  girl, having had conscientious scruples about her love for Urbain, he  had allayed them by an act of sacrilege--that is to say, he had, as  priest, in the middle of the night, performed the service of marriage  between himself and his mistress. The more absurd the reports, the more  credence did they gain, and it was not long till everyone in Loudun  believed them true, although no one was able to name the mysterious  heroine of the tale who had had the courage to contract a marriage with  a priest; and considering how small Loudun was, this was most  extraordinary.    Resolute and full of courage as was Grandier, at length he could not  conceal from himself that his path lay over quicksands: he felt that  slander was secretly closing him round, and that as soon as he was well  entangled in her shiny folds, she would reveal herself by raising her  abhorred head, and that then a mortal combat between them would begin.  But it was one of his convictions that to draw back was to acknowledge  one's guilt; besides, as far as he was concerned, it was probably too  late for him to retrace his steps. He therefore went on his way, as  unyielding, as scornful, and as haughty as ever.    Among those who were supposed to be most active in spreading the  slanders relative to Urbain was a man called Duthibaut, a person of  importance in the province, who was supposed by the townspeople to hold  very advanced views, and who was a \"Sir Oracle\" to whom the commonplace  and vulgar turned for enlightenment. Some of this man's strictures on  Grandier were reported to the latter, especially some calumnies to which  Duthibaut had given vent at the Marquis de Bellay's; and one day,  Grandier, arrayed in priestly garments, was about to enter the church of  Sainte-Croix to assist in the service, he encountered Duthibaut at the  entrance, and with his usual haughty disdain accused him of slander.  Duthibaut, who had got into the habit of saying and doing whatever came  into his head without fear of being called to account, partly because of  his wealth and partly because of the influence he had gained over the  narrow-minded, who are so numerous in a small provincial town, and who  regarded him as being much above them, was so furious at this public  reprimand, that he raised his cane and struck Urbain.    The opportunity which this affront afforded Grandier of being revenged  on all his enemies was too precious to be neglected, but, convinced,  with too much reason, that he would never obtain justice from the local  authorities, although the respect due to the Church had been infringed,  in his person he decided to appeal to King Louis XIII, who deigned to  receive him, and deciding that the insult offered to a priest robed in  the sacred vestments should be expiated, sent the cause to the high  court of Parliament, with instructions that the case against Duthibaut  should be tried and decided there.    Hereupon Urbain's enemies saw they had no time to lose, and took  advantage of his absence to make counter accusations against him. Two  worthies beings, named Cherbonneau and Bugrau, agreed to become  informers, and were brought before the ecclesiastical magistrate at  Poitiers. They accused Grandier of having corrupted women and girls, of  indulging in blasphemy and profanity, of neglecting to read his breviary  daily, and of turning God's sanctuary into a place of debauchery and  prostitution. The information was taken down, and Louis Chauvet, the  civil lieutenant, and the archpriest of Saint-Marcel and the Loudenois,  were appointed to investigate the matter, so that, while Urbain was  instituting proceedings against Duthibaut in Paris, information was laid  against himself in Loudun. This matter thus set going was pushed forward  with all the acrimony so common in religious prosecutions; Trinquant  appeared as a witness, and drew many others after him, and whatever  omissions were found in the depositions were interpolated according to  the needs of the prosecution. The result was that the case when fully  got up appeared to be so serious that it was sent to the Bishop of  Poitiers for trial. Now the bishop was not only surrounded by the  friends of those who were bringing the accusations against Grandier, but  had himself a grudge against him. It had happened some time before that  Urbain, the case being urgent, had dispensed with the usual notice of a  marriage, and the bishop, knowing this, found in the papers laid before  him, superficial as they were, sufficient evidence against Urbain to  justify him in issuing a warrant for his apprehension, which was drawn  up in the following words:    \"Henri-Louis, Chataignier de la Rochepezai, by divine mercy Bishop of  Poitiers, in view of the charges and informations conveyed to us by the  archpriest of Loudun against Urbain Grandier, priest-in-charge of the  Church of Saint-Pierre in the Market-Place at Loudun, in virtue of a  commission appointed by us directed to the said archpriest, or in his  absence to the Prior of Chassaignes, in view also of the opinion given  by our attorney upon the said charges, have ordered and do hereby order  that Urbain Grandier, the "]]]
