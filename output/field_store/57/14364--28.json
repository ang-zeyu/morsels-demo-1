See here!\" and he fastened together several pieces  strong string which had tied some of the other boys' books, piled the  latter together, and standing on tiptoe on this very insecure basis,  fastened one end of the cord to a horizontal bough, and put his neck  into a running knot at the other end, endeavouring to imitate the  contortions of an actual sufferer. Shouts of laughter greeted him, and  the victim laughed loudest of all. Three archers went to call the rest  to behold this amusing spectacle; one, tired out, remained with the  prisoner.    \"Ah, Hangman,\" said Pierre, putting out his tongue at him, \"are the  books firm? I thought I felt them give way.\"    \"No,\" replied Antoine; it was he who remained. \"Don't be afraid,  Pierre.\"    \"It is a good thing; for if they fell I don't think the cord is long  enough.\"    \"Don't you really think so?\"    A horrible thought showed itself like a flash on the child's face. He  resembled a young hyena scenting blood for the first time. He glanced at  the pile of books Pierre was standing on, and compared it with the  length of the cord between the branch and his neck. It was already  nearly dark, the shadows were deepening in the wood, gleams of pale  light penetrated between the trees, the leaves had become black and  rustled in the wind. Antoine stood silent and motionless, listening if  any sound could be heard near them.    It would be a curious study for the moralist to observe how the first  thought of crime develops itself in the recesses of the human heart, and  how this poisoned germ grows and stifles all other sentiments; an  impressive lesson might be gathered from this struggle of two opposing  principles, however weak it may be, in perverted natures. In cases where  judgment can discern, where there is power to choose between good and  evil, the guilty person has only himself to blame, and the most heinous  crime is only the action of its perpetrator. It is a human action, the  result of passions which might have been controlled, and one's mind is  not uncertain, nor one's conscience doubtful, as to the guilt. But how  can one conceive this taste for murder in a young child, how imagine it,  without being tempted to exchange the idea of eternal sovereign justice  for that of blind-fatality? How can one judge without hesitation between  the moral sense which has given way and the instinct which displays  itself? how not exclaim that the designs of a Creator who retains the  one and impels the other are sometimes mysterious and inexplicable, and  that one must submit without understanding?    \"Do you hear them coming?\" asked Pierre.    \"I hear nothing,\" replied Antoine, and a nervous shiver ran through all  his members.    \"So much the worse. I am tired of being dead; I shall come to life and  run after them. Hold the books, and I will undo the noose.\"    \"If you move, the books will separate; wait, I will hold them.\"    And he knelt down, and collecting all his strength, gave the pile a  violent push.    Pierre endeavoured to raise his hands to his throat. \"What are you  doing?\" he cried in a suffocating voice.    \"I am paying you out;\" replied Antoine, folding his arms.    Pierre's feet were only a few inches from the ground, and the weight of  his body at first bent the bough for a moment; but it rose again, and  the unfortunate boy exhausted himself in useless efforts. At every  movement the knot grew tighter, his legs struggled, his arms sought  vainly something to lay hold of; then his movements slackened, his limbs  stiffened, and his hands sank down. Of so much life and vigour nothing  remained but the movement of an inert mass turning round and round upon  itself.    Not till then did Antoine cry for help, and when the other boys hastened  up they found him crying and tearing his hair. So violent indeed were  his sobs and his despair that he could hardly be understood as he tried  to explain how the books had given way under Pierre, and how he had  vainly endeavoured to support him in his arms.    This boy, left an orphan at three years old, had been brought up at  first by a relation who turned him out for theft; afterwards by two  sisters, his cousins, who were already beginning to take alarm at his  abnormal perversity. This pale and fragile being, an incorrigible thief,  a consummate hypocrite, and a cold-blooded assassin, was predestined to  an immortality of crime, and was to find a place among the most  execrable monsters for whom humanity has ever had to blush; his name was  Antoine-Francois Derues.    Twenty years had gone by since this horrible and mysterious event, which  no one sought to unravel at the time it occurred. One June evening,  1771, four persons were sitting in one of the rooms of a modestly  furnished, dwelling on the third floor of a house in the rue  Saint-Victor. The party consisted of three women and an ecclesiastic,  who boarded, for meals only, with the woman who tenanted the dwelling;  the other two were near neighbours. They were all friends, and often met  thus in the evening to play cards. They were sitting round the  card-table, but although it was nearly ten o'clock the cards had not yet  been touched. They spoke in low tones, and a half-interrupted confidence  had, this evening, put a check on the usual gaiety.    Someone knocked gently at the door, although no sound of steps on the  creaking wooden staircase had been heard, and a wheedling voice asked  for admittance. The occupier of the room, Madame Legrand, rose, and  admitted a man of about six-and-twenty, at whose appearance the four  friends exchanged glances, at once observed by the new-comer, who  affected, however, not to see them. He bowed successively to the three  women, and several times with the utmost respect to the abbe, making  signs of apology for the interruption caused by his appearance; then,  coughing several times, he turned to Madame Legrand, and said in a  feeble voice, which seemed to betoken much suffering--    \"My kind mistress, will you and these other ladies excuse my presenting  myself at such an hour and in such a costume? I am ill, and I was  obliged to get up.\"    His costume was certainly singular enough: he was wrapped in a large  dressing-gown of flowered chintz; his head was adorned by a nightcap  drawn up at the top and surmounted by a muslin frill. His appearance did  not contradict his complaint of illness; he was barely four feet six in  height, his limbs were bony, his face sharp, thin, and pale. Thus  attired, coughing incessantly, dragging his feet as if he had no  strength to lift them, holding a lighted candle in one hand and an egg  in the other, he suggested a caricature-some imaginary invalid just  escaped from M. Purgon. Nevertheless, no one ventured to smile,  notwithstanding his valetudinarian appearance and his air of affected  humility. The perpetual blinking of the yellow eyelids which fell over  the round and hollow eyes, shining with a sombre fire which he could  never entirely suppress, reminded one of a bird of prey unable to face  the light, and the lines of his face, the hooked nose, and the thin,  constantly quivering, drawn-in lips suggested a mixture of boldness and  baseness, of cunning and sincerity. But there is no book which can  instruct one to read the human countenance correctly; and some special  circumstance must have roused the suspicions of these four persons so  much as to cause them to make these observations, and they were not as  usual deceived by the humbug of this skilled actor, a past master in the  art of deception.    He continued after a moment's silence, as if he did not wish to  interrupt their mute observation--    \"Will you oblige me by a neighbourly kindness?\"    \"What is it, Derues?\" asked Madame Legrand. A violent cough, which  appeared to rend his chest, prevented him from answering immediately.  When it ceased, he looked at the abbe, and said, with a melancholy  smile--    \"What I ought to ask in my present state of health is your blessing, my  father, and your intercession for the pardon of my sins. But everyone  clings to the life which God has given him. We do not easily abandon  hope; moreover, I have always considered it wrong to neglect such means  of preserving our lives as are in our power, since life is for us only a  time of trial, and the longer and harder the trial the greater our  recompense in a better world. Whatever befalls us, our answer should be  that of the Virgin Mary to the angel who announced the mystery of the  Incarnation: 'Behold the handmaid of the Lord; be it unto me according  to Thy word.'\"    \"You are right,\" said the abbe, with a severe and inquisitorial look,  under which Derues remained quite untroubled; \"it is an attribute of God  to reward and to punish, and the Almighty is not deceived by him who  deceives men. The Psalmist has said, 'Righteous art Thou, O Lord, and  upright are Thy judgments.'\"    \"He has said also, 'The judgments of the Lord are true and righteous  altogether,'\" Derues promptly replied. This exchange of quotations from  Scripture might have lasted for hours without his being at a loss, had  the abbe thought fit to continue in this strain; but such a style of  conversation, garnished with grave and solemn words, seemed almost  sacrilegious in the mouth of a man of such ridiculous appearance--a  profanation at once sad and grotesque. Derues seemed to comprehend the  impression it produced, and tuning again to Madame Legrand, he said--    \"We have got a long way from what I came to ask you, my kind friend. I  was so ill that I went early to bed, but I cannot sleep, and I have no  fire.

Do you imagine that a woman who insists on her lover carrying  her off can so easily turn away from the man of her choice? I know her  well; I have had long talks with her, she and I alone: she is  feather-brained, given to pleasure, entirely without prejudices and  those stupid scruples which spoil the lives of other women; but a good  sort on the whole; devoted to my uncle, with no deception about her; but  at the same time extremely jealous, and has no notion of letting herself  be sacrificed to a rival. If ever she finds herself deceived, good-bye  to prudence and reserve, and then--\"    A look and a touch of the commander's knee cut this panegyric short, to  which the treasurer was listening with open-eyed astonishment.    \"What enthusiasm!\" he exclaimed. \"Well, and then----\"    \"Why, then,\" went on the young man, with a laugh, \"if my uncle behaves  badly, I, his nephew, will try to make up for his wrong-doing: he can't  blame me then. But until then he may be quite easy, as he well knows.\"    \"Oh yes, and in proof of that I am going to take Moranges with me  to-night. He is young and inexperienced, and it will be a good lesson  for him to see how a gallant whose amorous intrigues did not begin  yesterday sets about getting even with a coquette. He can turn it to  account later on.    \"On my word,\" said Jeannin, \"my notion is that he is in no great need of  a teacher; however, that's your business, not mine. Let us return to  what we were talking about just now. Are we agreed; and shall we amuse  ourselves by paying out the lady in, her own coin?\"    \"If you like.\"    \"Which of us is to begin?\"    De Jars struck the table with the handle of his dagger.    \"More wine, gentlemen?\" said the drawer, running up.    \"No, dice; and be quick about it.\"    \"Three casts each and the highest wins,\" said Jeannin. \"You begin.\"    \"I throw for myself and nephew.\" The dice rolled on the table.    \"Ace and three.\"    \"It's my turn now. Six and five.\"    \"Pass it over. Five and two.\"    \"We're equal. Four and two.\"    \"Now let me. Ace and blank.\"    \"Double six.\"    \"You have won.\"    \"And I'm off at once,\" said Jeannin, rising, and muffling himself in his  mantle, \"It's now half-past seven. We shall see each other again at  eight, so I won't say good-bye.\"    \"Good luck to you!\"    Leaving the tavern and turning into the rue Pavee, he took the direction  of the river.          CHAPTER II      In 1658, at the corner of the streets Git-le-Coeur and Le Hurepoix (the  site of the latter being now occupied by the Quai des Augustins as far  as Pont Saint-Michel), stood the great mansion which Francis I had  bought and fitted up for the Duchesse d'Etampes. It was at this period  if not in ruins at least beginning to show the ravages of time. Its rich  interior decorations had lost their splendour and become antiquated.  Fashion had taken up its abode in the Marais, near the Place Royale, and  it was thither that profligate women and celebrated beauties now enticed  the humming swarm of old rakes and young libertines. Not one of them all  would have thought of residing in the mansion, or even in the quarter,  wherein the king's mistress had once dwelt. It would have been a step  downward in the social scale, and equivalent to a confession that their  charms were falling in the public estimation. Still, the old palace was  not empty; it had, on the contrary, several tenants. Like the provinces  of Alexander's empire, its vast suites of rooms had been subdivided; and  so neglected was it by the gay world that people of the commonest  description strutted about with impunity where once the proudest nobles  had been glad to gain admittance. There in semi-isolation and despoiled  of her greatness lived Angelique-Louise de Guerchi, formerly companion  to Mademoiselle de Pons and then maid of honour to Anne of Austria. Her  love intrigues and the scandals they gave rise to had led to her  dismissal from court. Not that she was a greater sinner than many who  remained behind, only she was unlucky enough or stupid enough to be  found out. Her admirers were so indiscreet that they had not left her a  shred of reputation, and in a court where a cardinal is the lover of a  queen, a hypocritical appearance of decorum is indispensable to success.  So Angelique had to suffer for the faults she was not clever enough to  hide. Unfortunately for her, her income went up and down with the number  and wealth of her admirers, so when she left the court all her  possessions consisted of a few articles she had gathered together out of  the wreck of her former luxury, and these she was now selling one by one  to procure the necessaries of life, while she looked back from afar with  an envious eye at the brilliant world from which she had been exiled,  and longed for better days. All hope was not at an end for her. By a  strange law which does not speak well for human nature, vice finds  success easier to attain than virtue. There is no courtesan, no matter  how low she has fallen, who cannot find a dupe ready to defend against  the world an honour of which no vestige remains. A man who doubts the  virtue of the most virtuous woman, who shows himself inexorably severe  when he discovers the lightest inclination to falter in one whose  conduct has hitherto been above reproach, will stoop and pick up out of  the gutter a blighted and tarnished reputation and protect and defend it  against all slights, and devote his life to the attempt to restore  lustre to the unclean thing dulled by the touch of many fingers. In her  days of prosperity Commander de Jars and the king's treasurer had both  fluttered round Mademoiselle de Guerchi, and neither had fluttered in  vain. Short as was the period necessary to overcome her scruples, in as  short a period it dawned on the two candidates for her favour that each  had a successful rival in the other, and that however potent as a reason  for surrender the doubloons of the treasurer had been, the personal  appearance of the commander had proved equally cogent. As both had felt  for her only a passing fancy and not a serious passion, their  explanations with each other led to no quarrel between them; silently  and simultaneously they withdrew from her circle, without even letting  her know they had found her out, but quite determined to revenge,  themselves on her should a chance ever offer. However, other affairs of  a similar nature had intervened to prevent their carrying out this  laudable intention; Jeannin had laid siege to a more inaccessible  beauty, who had refused to listen to his sighs for less than 30 crowns,  paid in advance, and de Jars had become quite absorbed by his adventure  with the convent boarder at La Raquette, and the business of that young  stranger whom he passed off as his nephew. Mademoiselle de Guerchi had  never seen them again; and with her it was out of sight out of mind. At  the moment when she comes into our story she was weaving her toils round  a certain Duc de Vitry, whom she had seen at court, but whose  acquaintance she had never made, and who had been absent when the  scandalous occurrence which led to her disgrace came to light. He was a  man of from twenty-five to twenty-six years of age, who idled his life  away: his courage was undoubted, and being as credulous as an old  libertine, he was ready to draw his sword at any moment to defend the  lady whose cause he had espoused, should any insolent slanderer dare to  hint there was a smirch on her virtue. Being deaf to all reports, he  seemed one of those men expressly framed by heaven to be the consolation  of fallen women; such a man as in our times a retired opera-dancer or a  superannuated professional beauty would welcome with open arms. He had  only one fault--he was married. It is true he neglected his wife,  according to the custom of the time, and it is probably also true that  his wife cared very little about his infidelities. But still she was an  insurmountable obstacle to the fulfilment of Mademoiselle de Guerchi's  hopes, who but for her might have looked forward to one day becoming a  duchess.    For about three weeks, however, at the time we are speaking of, the duke  had neither crossed her threshold nor written. He had told her he was  going for a few days to Normandy, where he had large estates, but had  remained absent so long after the date he had fixed for his return that  she began to feel uneasy. What could be keeping him? Some new flame,  perhaps. The anxiety of the lady was all the more keen, that until now  nothing had passed between them but looks of languor and words of love.  The duke had laid himself and all he possessed at the feet of Angelique,  and Angelique had refused his offer. A too prompt surrender would have  justified the reports so wickedly spread against her; and, made wise by  experience, she was resolved not to compromise her future as she had  compromised her past. But while playing at virtue she had also to play  at disinterestedness, and her pecuniary resources were consequently  almost exhausted. She had proportioned the length of her resistance to  the length of her purse, and now the prolonged absence of her lover  threatened to disturb the equilibrium which she had established between  her virtue and her money. So it happened that the cause of the lovelorn  Duc de Vitry was in great peril just at the moment when de Jars and  Jeannin resolved to approach the fair one anew. She was sitting lost in  thought, pondering in all good faith on the small profit it was to a  woman to be virtuous, when she heard voices in the antechamber. Then her  door opened, and the king's treasurer walked in.    As this interview and those which follow took place in the presence of  witnesses, we are obliged to ask the reader to accompany us for a time  to another part of the same house.    We have said "]]]
