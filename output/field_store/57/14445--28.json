I.    NATURE OF FUNGI.      The most casual observer of Nature recognizes in almost every instance  that comes under his notice in every-day life, without the aid of  logical definition, the broad distinctions between an animal, a plant,  and a stone. To him, the old definition that an animal is possessed of  life and locomotion, a plant of life without locomotion, and a mineral  deficient in both, seems to be sufficient, until some day he travels  beyond the circuit of diurnal routine, and encounters a sponge or a  zoophyte, which possesses only one of his supposed attributes of  animal life, but which he is assured is nevertheless a member of the  animal kingdom. Such an encounter usually perplexes the neophyte at  first, but rather than confess his generalizations to have been too  gross, he will tenaciously contend that the sponge must be a plant,  until the evidence produced is so strong that he is compelled to  desert his position, and seek refuge in the declaration that one  kingdom runs into the other so imperceptibly that no line of  demarcation can be drawn between them. Between these two extremes of  broad distinction, and no distinction, lies the ground occupied by the  scientific student, who, whilst admitting that logical definition  fails in assigning briefly and tersely the bounds of the three  kingdoms, contends that such limits exist so positively, that the  universal scientific mind accepts the recognized limit without  controversy or contradiction.    In like manner, if one kingdom be made the subject of inquiry, the  same difficulties will arise. A flowering plant, as represented by a  rose or a lily, will be recognized as distinct from a fern, a seaweed,  or a fungus. Yet there are some flowering plants which, at first  sight, and without examination, simulate cryptogams, as, for example,  many _Balanophorae_, which the unscientific would at once class with  fungi. It is nevertheless true that even the incipient botanist will  accurately separate the phanerogams from the cryptogams, and by means  of a little more, but still elementary knowledge, distribute the  latter amongst ferns, mosses, fungi, lichens, and algae, with  comparatively few exceptions. It is true that between fungi and  lichens there exists so close an affinity that difficulties arise, and  doubts, and disputations, regarding certain small groups or a few  species; but these are the exception, and not the rule. Botanists  generally are agreed in recognizing the five principal groups of  Cryptogamia, as natural and distinct. In proportion as we advance from  comparison of members of the three kingdoms, through that of the  primary groups in one kingdom, to a comparison of tribes, alliances,  and orders, we shall require closer observation, and more and more  education of the eye to see, and the mind to appreciate, relationships  and distinctions.    We have already assumed that fungi are duly and universally admitted,  as plants, into the vegetable kingdom. But of this fact some have even  ventured to doubt. This doubt, however, has been confined to one order  of fungi, except, perhaps, amongst the most illiterate, although now  the animal nature of the _Myxogastres_ has scarcely a serious advocate  left. In this order the early condition of the plant is pulpy and  gelatinous, and consists of a substance more allied to sarcode than  cellulose. De Bary insinuated affinities with _Amoeba_,[A] whilst  Tulasne affirmed that the outer coat in some of these productions  contained so much carbonate of lime that strong effervescence took  place on the application of sulphuric acid. Dr. Henry Carter is well  known as an old and experienced worker amongst amoeboid forms of  animal life, and, when in Bombay, he devoted himself to the  examination of the _Myxogastres_ in their early stage, and the result  of his examinations has been a firm conviction that there is no  relationship whatever between the _Myxogastres_ and the lower forms of  animal life. De Bary has himself very much modified, if not wholly  abandoned, the views once propounded by him on this subject. When  mature, and the dusty spores, mixed with threads, sometimes spiral,  are produced, the _Myxogastres_ are so evidently close allies of the  _Lycoperdons_, or Puffballs, as to leave no doubt of their affinities.  It is scarcely necessary to remark that the presence of zoospores is  no proof of animal nature, for not only do they occur in the white  rust (_Cystopus_), and in such moulds as _Peronospora_,[B] but are  common in algae, the vegetable nature of which has never been  disputed.    There is another equally important, but more complicated subject to  which we must allude in this connection. This is the probability of  minute fungi being developed without the intervention of germs, from  certain solutions. The observations of M. Trecul, in a paper laid  before the French Academy, have thus been summarized:--1. Yeast cells  may be formed in the must of beer without spores being previously  sown. 2. Cells of the same form as those of yeast, but with different  contents, arise spontaneously in simple solution of sugar, or to which  a little tartrate of ammonia has been added, and these cells are  capable of producing fermentation in certain liquids under favourable  conditions. 3. The cells thus formed produce _Penicillium_ like the  cells of yeast. 4. On the other hand, the spores of _Penicillium_ are  capable of being transformed into yeast.[C] The interpretation of this  is, that the mould _Penicillium_ may be produced from a sugar  solution by \"spontaneous generation,\" and without spore or germ of any  kind. The theory is, that a molecular mass which is developed in  certain solutions or infusions, may, under the influence of different  circumstances, produce either animalcules or fungi. \"In all these  cases, no kind of animalcule or fungus is ever seen to originate from  preexisting cells or larger bodies, but always from molecules.\"[D] The  molecules are said to form small masses, which soon melt together to  constitute a globular body, from which a process juts out on one side.  These are the so-called _Torulae_,[E] which give off buds which are  soon transformed into jointed tubes of various diameters, terminating  in rows of sporules, _Penicillium_, or capsules containing numerous  globular seeds, _Aspergillus_ (_sic_).    This is but another mode of stating the same thing as above referred  to by M. Trecul, that certain cells, resembling yeast cells (_Torula_),  are developed spontaneously, and that these ultimately pass through the  form of mould called _Penicillium_ to the more complex _Mucor_ (which  the writer evidently has confounded with _Aspergillus_, unless he  alludes to the ascigerous form of _Aspergillus_,"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/30221"],[0,"Birds, Illustrated (#2)"],[1,"sits almost  motionless on its perch, the body remaining in the same position, the  head only moving from side to side. The tail does not hang quite  perpendicularly, the angle between the true tail and the vertical being  perhaps as much as fifteen or twenty degrees. The tail is occasionally  jerked open and closed again, and now and then slightly raised, causing  the long tail coverts to vibrate gracefully. I have not seen all. A ripe  fruit catches the quesal's eye and he darts from his perch, plucks the  berry, and returns to his former position. This is done with a degree of  elegance that defies description. A low whistle from Capriano calls the  bird near, and a moment afterward it is in my hand--the first quesal I  have seen and shot.\"    The above anecdote is very beautiful and graphic, but we read the last  sentence with pain. We wish to go on record with this our first number  as being unreconciled to the _ruthless_ killing of the birds. He who  said, not a sparrow \"shall fall on the ground without your Father,\" did  not intend such birds to be killed, but to beautify the earth.    The cries of the quesal are various. They consist principally of a low  note, _whe-oo_, _whe-oo_, which the bird repeats, whistling it softly at  first, then gradually swelling it into a loud and not unmelodious cry.  This is often succeeded by a long note, which begins low and after  swelling dies away as it began. Other cries are harsh and discordant.  The flight of the Trogon is rapid and straight. The long tail feathers,  which never seem to be in the way, stream after him. The bird is never  found except in forests of the loftiest trees, the lower branches of  which, being high above the ground, seem to be its favorite resort. Its  food consists principally of fruit, but occasionally a caterpillar is  found in its stomach.          THE MANDARIN DUCK.    A Letter from China.      Quack! Quack! I got in just in time.    I came as fast as I could, as I was afraid of being whipped. You see I  live in a boat with a great many other ducks.    My master and his family live in the boat too. Isn't that a funny place  to live in?    We stay in all night. Waking up early in the morning, we cry Quack!  Quack! until we wake the master.    He gets up and opens the gate for us and out we tumble into the water.  We are in such a hurry that we fall over each other. We swim about  awhile and then we go to shore for breakfast.    There are wet places near the shore where we find worms, grubs, and  roots. When evening comes the master blows a whistle. Then we know it is  time to come home.    We start as soon as we hear it, and hurry, because the last duck in gets  a whipping. It does not hurt much but we do not like it, so we all try  to get home first.    I have web feet, but I perch like other birds on the branches of the  trees near the river.    My feathers are beautiful in the sunlight. My wife always sits near me.  Her dress is not like mine. It is brown and grey.    From May to August I lose my bright feathers, then I put on a dress like  my wife's.    My master's family are Chinese, and they are very queer. They would not  sell me for anything, as they would not like to have me leave China.    Sometimes a pair of us are put in a gay cage and carried to a wedding.  After the wedding we are given to the bride and groom.    I hear the master's whistle again. He wants me to come in and go to bed.  Quack! Quack! Good bye!    [Illustration: MANDARIN DUCK.]          THE MANDARIN DUCK.      \"A more magnificently clothed bird,\" says Wood, \"than the male Chinese  Mandarin Duck, can hardly be found, when in health and full nuptial  plumage. They are natives of China and Japan, and are held in such high  esteem by the Chinese that they can hardly be obtained at any price, the  natives having a singular dislike to seeing the birds pass into the  possession of Europeans.\"    Though web-footed, the birds have the power of perching and it is  a curious sight to watch them on the branches of trees overhanging  the pond in which they live, the male and female being always close  together, the one gorgeous in purple, green, white, and chestnut, and  the other soberly appareled in brown and grey. This handsome plumage  the male loses during four months of the year, from May to August, when  he throws off his fine crest, his wing-fans, and all his brilliant  colors, assuming the sober tinted dress of his mate. The Summer Duck of  America bears a close resemblance to the Mandarin Duck, both in plumage  and manners, and at certain times of the year is hardly to be  distinguished from that bird.    The foreign duck has been successfully reared in Zoological Gardens,  some being hatched under the parent bird and others under a domestic  hen, the latter hatching the eggs three days in advance of the former.    \"The Chinese,\" says Dr. Bennett, \"highly esteem the Mandarin Duck, which  exhibits, as they think, a most striking example of conjugal attachment  and fidelity. A pair of them are frequently placed in a gaily decorated  cage and carried in their marriage processions, to be presented to the  bride and groom as worthy objects of emulation.\"    \"I could more easily,\" wrote a friend of Dr. Bennett's in China to whom  he had expressed his desire for a pair of these birds, \"send you two  live Mandarins than a pair of Mandarin Ducks.\"    Concerning their attachment and fidelity to one another, Dr. Bennett  recites the following:    \"Mr. Beale's aviary at Maceo one day was broken open and the male bird  stolen from the side of its mate. She refused to be comforted, and,  retiring to the farthest part of the aviary, sat disconsolate, rarely  partaking of food, and giving no attention to her soiled and rumpled  plumage. In vain did another handsome drake endeavor to console her for  her loss. After some time the stolen bird was found in the quarters of  a miserable Chinaman, and at once restored to its mate. As soon as he  recognized his abode he began to flap his wings and quack vehemently.  She heard his voice and almost quacked to screaming with ecstasy, both  expressing their joy by crossing necks and quacking in concert. The next  morning he fell upon the unfortunate drake who had made consolatory  advances to his mate, pecked out his eyes and so injured him that the  poor fellow died in the course of a few days.\"    According to Schrenck, this species appears in the countries watered by  the Amoor about May, and departs again at the end of August; at this  season it is always met with in small or large flocks, which are so  extremely shy that they rarely come within gunshot. Whilst on the wing  these parties crowd closely together in front, the birds in the rear  occupying a comparatively free space.          THE GOLDEN PHEASANT      They call me the Golden Pheasant, because I have a golden crest. It is  like a king's crown. Don't you think my dress is beautiful enough for a  king?    See the large ruff around my neck. I can raise and lower it as I please.    I am a very large bird. I am fourteen inches tall and twenty-eight  inches long. I can step right over your little robins and meadow larks  and blue jays and not touch them.    Sometimes people get some of our eggs and put them under an old hen. By  and by little pheasants hatch out, and the hen is very good to them. She  watches over them and feeds them, but they do not wish to stay with her;  they like their wild life. If they are not well fed they will fly away.    I have a wife. Her feathers are beginning to grow like mine. In a few  years she will look as I do. We like to have our nests by a fallen  tree.           *       *       *    The well-known Chinese Pheasant, which we have named the Golden  Pheasant, as well as its more sober-colored cousin, the Silver Pheasant,  has its home in Eastern Asia.    China is pre-eminently the land of Pheasants; for, besides those just  mentioned, several other species of the same family are found there.  Japan comes next to China as a pheasant country and there are some in  India.    In China the Golden Pheasant is a great favorite, not only for its  splendid plumage and elegant form, but for the excellence of its flesh,  which is said to surpass even that of the common pheasant. It has been  introduced into Europe, but is fitted only for the aviary.    For purposes of the table it is not likely to come into general use, as  there are great difficulties in the way of breeding it in sufficient  numbers, and one feels a natural repugnance to the killing of so  beautiful a bird for the sake of eating it. The magnificent colors  belong only to the male, the female being reddish brown, spotted and  marked with a darker hue. The tail of the female is short. The statement  is made, however, that some hens kept for six years by Lady Essex  gradually assumed an attire like that of the males.    Fly-fishers highly esteem the crest and feathers on the back of the neck  of the male, as many of the artificial baits owe their chief beauty to  the Golden Pheasant.    According to Latham, it is called by the Chinese Keuki, or Keukee, a  word which means gold flower fowl.           *       *       *        \"A merry welcome to thee, glittering bird!         Lover of summer flowers and sunny things!       A night hath passed since my young buds have heard         The music of thy rainbow-colored wings--       Wings that flash spangles out where'er they quiver,         Like sunlight rushing o'er a river.\"    [Illustration: GOLDEN PHEASANT.]          THE NONPAREIL.      So full of fight is this little bird, that the bird trappers take  advantage of his disposition to make him a prisoner. They place a  decoy bird on a cage trap in the attitude of defense, and when it is  discovered by the bird an attack at once follows, and the fighter soon  finds himself caught.    They are a great favorite for the cage, being preferred by many to the  Canary. Whatever he may lack as a "]]]
