[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/26978"],[0,"Salem Witchcraft and Cotton Mather: A Reply (#2)"],[1," I hail with satisfaction the criticisms that may be  offered upon my book, without regard to their personal character or  bearing, as continuing and heightening the interest felt in the subject;  and avail myself of the opportunity, tendered to me without solicitation  and in a most liberal spirit, by the proprietor of this Magazine, to  meet the obligations which historical truth and justice impose.    The principle charge, and it is repeated in innumerable forms through  the sixty odd pages of the article in the _North American_, is that I  have misrepresented the part borne by Cotton Mather in the proceeding  connected with the Witchcraft Delusion and prosecutions, in 1692.  Various other complaints are made of inaccuracy and unfairness,  particularly in reference to the position of Increase Mather and the  course of the Boston Ministers of that period, generally. Although the  discussion, to which I now ask attention, may appear, at first view, to  relate to questions merely personal, it will be found, I think, to lead  to an exploration of the literature and prevalent sentiments, relating  to religious and philosophical subjects, of that period; and, also, of  an instructive passage in the public history of the Province of  Massachusetts Bay.    I now propose to present the subject more fully than was required, or  would have been appropriate, in my work on Witchcraft.          I.    THE CONNECTION OF THE MATHERS WITH THE SUPERSTITIONS OF THEIR TIME.      In the first place, I venture to say that it can admit of no doubt, that  Increase Mather and his son, Cotton Mather, did more than any other  persons to aggravate the tendency of that age to the result reached in  the Witchcraft Delusion of 1692. The latter, in the beginning of the  Sixth Book of the _Magnalia Christi Americana_, refers to an attempt  made, about the year 1658, \"among some divines of no little figure  throughout England and Ireland, for the faithful registering of  remarkable providences. But, alas,\" he says, \"it came to nothing that  was remarkable. The like holy design,\" he continues, \"was, by the  Reverend Increase Mather, proposed among the divines of New England, in  the year 1681, at a general meeting of them; who thereupon desired him  to begin and publish an Essay; which he did in a little while; but  there-withal declared that he did it only as a specimen of a larger  volume, in hopes that this work being set on foot, posterity would go on  with it.\" Cotton Mather did go on with it, immediately upon his entrance  to the ministry; and by their preaching, publications, correspondence at  home and abroad, and the influence of their learning, talents, industry,  and zeal in the work, these two men promoted the prevalence of a passion  for the marvelous and monstrous, and what was deemed preternatural,  infernal, and diabolical, throughout the whole mass of the people, in  England as well as America. The public mind became infatuated and,  drugged with credulity and superstition, was prepared to receive every  impulse of blind fanaticism. The stories, thus collected and put  everywhere in circulation, were of a nature to terrify the imagination,  fill the mind with horrible apprehensions, degrade the general  intelligence and taste, and dethrone the reason. They darken and  dishonor the literature of that period. A rehash of them can be found in  the Sixth Book of the _Magnalia_. The effects of such publications were  naturally developed in widespread delusions and universal credulity.  They penetrated the whole body of society, and reached all the  inhabitants and families of the land, in the towns and remotest  settlements. In this way, the Mathers, particularly the younger, made  themselves responsible for the diseased and bewildered state of the  public mind, in reference in supernatural and diabolical agencies, which  came to a head in the Witchcraft Delusion. I do not say that they were  culpable. Undoubtedly they thought they were doing God service. But the  influence they exercised, in this direction, remains none the less an  historical fact.    Increase Mather applied himself, without delay, to the prosecution of  the design he had proposed, by writing to persons in all parts of the  country, particularly clergymen, to procure, for publication, as many  marvelous stories as could be raked up. In the eighth volume of the  Fourth Series of the _Collections of the Massachusetts Historical  Society_, consisting of _The Mather Papers_, the responses of several of  his correspondents may be seen. [_Pp. 285, 360, 361, 367, 466, 475, 555,  612._] He pursued this business with an industrious and pertinacious  zeal, which nothing could slacken. After the rest of the world had been  shocked out of such mischievous nonsense, by the horrid results at  Salem, on the fifth of March, 1694, as President of Harvard College, he  issued a Circular to \"The Reverend Ministers of the Gospel, in the  several Churches in New England,\" signed by himself and seven others,  members of the Corporation of that institution, urging it, as the  special duty of Ministers of the Gospel, to obtain and preserve  knowledge of notable occurrences, described under the general head of  \"_Remarkables_,\" and classified as follows:    \"The things to be esteemed memorable are, especially, all unusual  accidents, in the heaven, or earth, or water; all wonderful deliverances  of the distressed; mercies to the godly; judgments to the wicked; and  more glorious fulfilments of either the promises or the threatenings, in  the Scriptures of truth; with apparitions, possessions, inchantments,  and all extraordinary things wherein the existence and agency of the  invisible world is more sensibly demonstrated.\"--_Magnalia Christi  Americana._ Edit. London, 1702. Book VI., p. 1.    All communications, in answer to this missive were to be addressed to  the \"President and Fellows\" of Harvard College.    The first article is as follows: \"To observe and record the more  illustrious discoveries of the Divine Providence, in the government of  the world, is a design so holy, so useful, so justly approved, that the  too general neglect of it in the Churches of God, is as justly to be  lamented.\" It is important to consider this language in connection with  that used by Cotton Mather, in opening the Sixth Book of the _Magnalia_:  \"To regard the illustrious displays of that Providence, wherewith our  Lord Christ governs the world, is a work than which there is none more  needful or useful for a Christian; to record them is a work than which  none more proper for a Minister; and perhaps the great Governor of the  world will ordinarily do the most notable things for those who are most  ready to take a wise notice of what he does. Unaccountable, therefore,  and inexcusable, is the sleepiness, even upon the most of good men  throughout the world, which indisposes them to observe and, much more,  to preserve, the remarkable dispensations of Divine Providence, towards  themselves or others. Nevertheless there have been raised up, now and  then, those persons, who have rendered themselves worthy of everlasting  remembrance, by their wakeful zeal to have the memorable providences of  God remembered through all generations.\"    These passages from the Mathers, father and son, embrace, in their  bearings, a period, eleven years before and two years after the Delusion  of 1692. They show that the Clergy, generally, were indifferent to the  subject, and required to be aroused from \"neglect\" and \"sleepiness,\"  touching the duty of flooding the public mind with stories of \"wonders\"  and \"remarkables;\" and that the agency of the Mathers, in giving  currency, by means of their ministry and influence, to such ideas, was  peculiar and pre-eminent. However innocent and excusable their motives  may have been, the laws of cause and effect remained unbroken; and the  result of their actions are, with truth and justice, attributable to  them--not necessarily, I repeat, to impeach their honesty and integrity,  but their wisdom, taste, judgment, and common sense. Human  responsibility is not to be set aside, nor avoided, merely and wholly by  good intent. It involves a solemn and fearful obligation to the use of  reason, caution, cool deliberation, circumspection, and a most careful  calculation of consequences. Error, if innocent and honest, is not  punishable by divine, and ought not to be by human, law. It is covered  by the mercy of God, and must not be pursued by the animosity of men.  But it is, nevertheless, a thing to be dreaded and to be guarded  against, with the utmost vigilance. Throughout the melancholy annals of  the Church and the world, it has been the fountain of innumerable woes,  spreading baleful influences through society, paralysing the energies of  reason and conscience, dimming, all but extinguishing, the light of  religion, convulsing nations, and desolating the earth. It is the duty  of historians to trace it to its source; and, by depicting faithfully  the causes that have led to it, prevent its recurrence. With these  views, I feel bound, distinctly, to state that the impression given to  the popular sentiments of the period, to which I am referring, by  certain leading minds, led to, was the efficient cause of, and, in this  sense, may be said to have originated, the awful superstitions long  prevalent in the old world and the new, and reaching a final catastrophe  in 1692; and among these leading minds, aggravating and intensifying, by  their writings, this most baleful form of the superstition of the age,  Increase and Cotton Mather stand most conspicuous.    This opinion was entertained, at the time, by impartial observers.  Francis Hutchinson, D.D., \"Chaplain in ordinary to his Majesty, and  Minister of St. James's Parish, in St. Edmund's Bury,\" in the life-time  of both the Mathers, published, in London, an _Historical Essay  concerning Witchcraft_, dedicated to the \"Lord"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/26981"],[0,"Pan-Islam (#2)"],[1,"explosives that it caused a panic in Haifa. Yet it did not sufficiently  impress our Levantine Vice-Consul there for him to report it, though the  German Consul's remarkable activity to get the stuff landed might have  given him the hint.    At Jeddah our Khedivial Mail Agency, under the good old English name of  Robinson, was a perfect nest of Germans and pro-German Dutchmen when I  called there in 1912. They were very active early in the War, but had  wisely disappeared before my last visit, when Jeddah fell to our  blockade and bombardment.    As for Hodeidah, the chief port of Yamen, it was the happy  hunting-ground of a great German firm, and the American Consul was  himself a German.    Decidedly, for people who believed that they had a monopoly of Divine  assistance, they had taken a lot of pains that their Holy War should be  a success.    To grasp the world-wide conspiracy which hatched out so many formidable  events during the War and to appreciate the causes which contributed to  its final collapse we must take a comprehensive glance at the Ottoman  Caliphate and how it came about.    Remember, the Ottoman Turks are not Semitic, as is the bulk of the  Moslem world. Tradition derives them from Turk, son of Japhet, and they  are a Turco-Mongol blend which most people agree to call Tartar. Their  language is closely allied to Mongolian, though written in Arabic, or  rather Persian, character, and its Arabic words are pronounced  unintelligibly to an Arab. A true Turk learns Arabic with difficulty,  and a far higher percentage of Britons in India speak Hindustani than  Turks do Arabic in Turkish Arabia.    Then, again, look at their early history. Their Mongol-Turkish ancestors  were driven westward because they made Mongolia too hot for them, and we  hear of Turks smelting iron for their Mongol masters in what is now  Eastern Turkestan until they threw off the Mongol yoke in A.D. 552, when  Turkish history begins.    At the dawn of Islam (A.D. 632) Turks and Mongols were harrying each  other all over the Caspian countries like rival wolf-packs, sometimes  combining for a raid on their neighbours and then fighting over the  loot. That is why you find racial Turks in such outlandish places as  Merv, Khiva, Samarcand, Bokhara and Cabul, for the Turkish race is not  confined to Asia Minor and Turkey in Europe, but is scattered over parts  of Russia and China and Afghanistan.    Now to consider the Ottoman Turks, with whom we are chiefly concerned.  They were superior to their Mongol fellow-wolves in that they could  smelt iron and had some idea of constructive enterprise. They had also  adopted Islam, which was a great advance from the Shamanistic wizardry  and totem-worship they used to practise, and their contact with the  Arabs who raided them and afterwards accepted their military service to  the Caliphate had civilised them considerably. Their Seljouk cousins  were already ruling in Asia Minor, whither they had been driven by the  Mongols when a wandering Turkish band sought similar asylum there in the  earlier part of the thirteenth century and intervened most opportunely  to help the Seljouks repulse a Mongol raid; in return, the Seljouk  Emperor gave them a grant of land in Bithynia.    In 1300 the Seljouk Empire was finally smashed by the Mongols, who  withdrew eastward without occupying the country, for they were merely  predatory and destructive and had no gift or desire for permanent  colonisation. So it came about that the Ottoman Empire began in 1326  under Othman I in Bithynia and grew by absorption and lack of effective  opposition until, in 1517, we find it spreading under Selim I (the  Magnificent) to the gates of Vienna and extending from Germany to Persia  and from Arabia to the Atlantic.    The benign sun of the Arabian Caliphate, under which learning and  industry flourished securely, had long since set in blood under  circumstances of treachery and murder which have hardly been surpassed  even in the late war.    Under the later Abbasides, when the glories of the Caliphate were  waning, there were bitter dissensions between Sunnis and Shiahs (the  main orthodox and schismatic sects of Islam) which culminated in fierce  rioting at Baghdad in 1258. The then Caliph was foolish enough to appeal  for assistance against the schismatic seditionists to his Mongol  neighbours. It had been done before under similar conditions, and even  in these days such a manoeuvre seems still to appeal to some types of  religious fanaticism, judging by certain passages between our sister  isle and the modern Hun. On the above occasion, however, it was  practised once too often. Hulaku Khan, the fierce Mongol chief, had long  had his eye on Baghdad as holding princely loot in all too slack a grip,  for the Caliphate had been relying on Tartar mercenaries for years.    He approached that queen of cities, as she then was, with a great host,  lured the Caliph out to meet him by the promise of an alliance, and  murdered the whole party, the Caliph being trampled to death. Then  Baghdad was given over to sack and massacre for more than a month, by  which time 1,800,000 people are said to have perished.    The Caliphate was transplanted to Cairo, where it dragged out an anaemic  existence until Selim I seized it, with the person of the then Caliph,  by right of conquest, and it has been an appanage of the Ottoman  reigning house ever since.    Selim the Magnificent may be called the Turkish top-note. After him the  Ottoman Empire gradually declined. It has generally taken advantage of  disaster or dissension to extend its borders--a precarious method of  empire-building unless consolidated by benevolent and sound  administration, which is not a feature of Turkish rule. Add to this the  facts that Turks are slack Moslems, that the national party which ousted  Abdul Hamid (himself most orthodox) is not religious at all, with all  its barbarian, totemistic nonsense of the \"White Wolf,\" and that they  _would_ pose as conquerors on insufficient grounds, and we begin to see  why they have been kicked out of their Asiatic empire bit by bit.    If Turk and Mongol had been capable of dynastic evolution and  co-ordinate policy they might have shared most of the Eastern Hemisphere  between them. We have seen the high-water mark of the Ottoman Empire;  Marco Polo has told us of Kubla Khan's Chinese Empire, and the Moguls  did much for India in their prime. But the wolf-taint was in their  blood, and just as a pet wolf gets fat and degenerate, so it has been  with these Tartars. Their undoubted soldierly qualities are sapped by  luxury, and they possess no constructive gifts which peace and  prosperity might develop. Hence it is that every empire they have  founded has risen to a culminating point of conquest and then dwindled  away in sloth and corruption.    The Turk is not fit to be put in charge of any race but his own, for he  is at heart a bitter wolf who will turn and rend without ruth or  warning. I have met Turks who have shown tact, humanity, and ability  under trying conditions, and I have met well-mannered wolves in  captivity, but would not trust the pack ranging in its native forest. I  once heard a member of our Ottoman Embassy who has unique experience of  the Turk size him up as follows: \"The Turk can be a suave and cultured  gentleman till his time comes, and then he will tear your guts out and  _dance_ on them.\" It was the Seljouk Turks whose persecutions caused  the Crusades. Before them, Arab rule in Palestine was tolerant enough,  and the Caliph Omar was scrupulously careful when he entered Jerusalem  as a conqueror to respect Christian prejudices and the monuments of our  creed.    So it came about that their empire was dropping from them piecemeal even  before the War, for a race that can no longer conquer and has never  learned to conciliate must draw in its borders or cease to exist as a  State.    When war broke out Turkey was just hanging on to the last scrap of her  empire in Europe and had lost all but the shadow of sovereignty in  Egypt, while Arabia was seething with discontent, where not in actual  revolt, and regarded the belated efforts of local officials to govern  tactfully as signs of weakness.    The colossal brigandage of Germany appealed to her freebooting  instincts, although it took a corrupt, self-seeking Government and a  final push from the \"Goeben\" and the \"Breslau\" to plunge her into war  against her best friends.    To proclaim a _jihad_ was her obvious course, if only to keep Arabia  moderately quiet, apart from its value as a weapon against her Christian  foes. We will now see how she fared in the \"Holy War.\"          CHAPTER II    ITS BEARING ON THE WAR      Quite early in the War those of us who had to deal with pan-Islamic  propaganda realised that the widespread organisation which Germany had  grafted on to the original Turkish movement must have existed some time  before the outbreak of actual hostilities.    For example, there was a snug, smooth-running concern at San Francisco  which spread its tentacles all over the Moslem world, but specialised in  a seditious newspaper called _El'-Ghadr_, which means treachery or  mutiny. This was particularly directed at our Indian Army, but Egypt was  not forgotten. A gifted censor sent us an early copy, but had,  unfortunately, lost the wrapper, so our earnest desire to make the  addressee's closer acquaintance was thwarted.    Stamboul was naturally an active centre, and, before the Turks entered  the War, Turkish officers in full uniform, and sometimes even wearing  swords, permeated Cairo cafes with espionage and verbal propaganda,  trying to fan into flame the military ardour of Egyptian students and  men about town. This last activity was wasted effort, as anyone who knew  the type could have told them; the effendis abstained from the crudities  of personal service and confined themselves to stirring up the town"]]]
