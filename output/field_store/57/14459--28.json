It has become a universal custom to obtain and preserve the likenesses  of one's friends. Photographs are the most popular form of these  likenesses, as they give the true exterior outlines and appearance,  (except coloring) of the subjects. But how much more popular and  useful does photography become, when it can be used as a means of  securing plates from which to print photographs in a regular printing  press, and, what is more astonishing and delightful, to produce the  REAL COLORS of nature as shown in the subject, no matter how brilliant  or varied.    We quote from the December number of the Ladies' Home Journal:    \"_An excellent_ suggestion was recently made by the Department of  Agriculture at Washington that the public schools of the country shall  have a new holiday, to be known as Bird Day. Three cities have already  adopted the suggestion, and it is likely that others will quickly  follow. Of course, Bird Day will differ from its successful  predecessor, Arbor Day. We can plant trees but not birds. It is  suggested that Bird Day take the form of bird exhibitions, of bird  exercises, of bird studies--any form of entertainment, in fact, which  will bring children closer to their little brethren of the air, and  in more intelligent sympathy with their life and ways. There is a  wonderful story in bird life, and but few of our children know it. Few  of our elders do, for that matter. A whole day of a year can well and  profitably be given over to the birds. Than such study, nothing can be  more interesting. The cultivation of an intimate acquaintanceship with  our feathered friends is a source of genuine pleasure. We are under  greater obligations to the birds than we dream of. Without them the  world would be more barren than we imagine. Consequently, we have some  duties which we owe them. What these duties are only a few of us know  or have ever taken the trouble to find out. Our children should not be  allowed to grow to maturity without this knowledge. The more they know  of the birds the better men and women they will be. We can hardly  encourage such studies too much.\"    Of all animated nature, birds are the most beautiful in coloring, most  graceful in form and action, swiftest in motion and most perfect  emblems of freedom.    They are withal, very intelligent and have many remarkable traits, so  that their habits and characteristics make a delightful study for all  lovers of nature. In view of the facts, we feel that we are doing  a useful work for the young, and one that will be appreciated by  progressive parents, in placing within the easy possession of children  in the homes these beautiful photographs of birds.    The text is prepared with the view of giving the children as clear an  idea as possible, of haunts, habits, characteristics and such other  information as will lead them to love the birds and delight in their  study and acquaintance.

JUNE, 1897.                     No. 6.   ======================================================================      BIRD SONG.        \"I cannot love the man who doth not love,      As men love light, the song of happy birds.\"      It is indeed fitting that the great poets have ever been the  best interpreters of the songs of birds. In many of the plays of  Shakespeare, especially where the scene is laid in the primeval  forest, his most delicious bits of fancy are inspired by the flitting  throng. Wordsworth and Tennyson, and many of the minor English poets,  are pervaded with bird notes, and Shelley's masterpiece, The Skylark,  will long survive his greater and more ambitious poems. Our own poet,  Cranch, has left one immortal stanza, and Bryant, and Longfellow, and  Lowell, and Whittier, and Emerson have written enough of poetic  melody, the direct inspiration of the feathered inhabitants of the  woods, to fill a good-sized volume. In prose, no one has said finer  things than Thoreau, who probed nature with a deeper ken than any of  his contemporaries. He is to be read, and read, and read.    But just what meaning should be attached to a bird's notes--some of  which are \"the least disagreeable of noises\"--will probably never be  discovered. They do seem to express almost every feeling of which the  human heart is capable. We wonder if the Mocking Bird understands what  all these notes mean. He"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/30667"],[0,"The Tale of Old Dog Spot (#2)"],[1," afraid of me.\"    \"Nonsense!\" said the old horse Ebenezer. But he couldn't make Spot  believe there was the slightest danger in teasing Miss Kitty Cat.    \"She always runs up a tree after I've been pointing at her,\" Spot went  on.    \"You'd better look out!\" Ebenezer cautioned him. \"She'll have you  climbing a tree the first thing you know.\"    Well, that made Spot laugh. And he went out of the barn feeling even  more pleased with himself than ever. He was sorry that Miss Kitty Cat  wasn't in the yard. He felt just like bothering her.    \"I'll go up to the pasture and find me a woodchuck to chase,\" Spot said  to himself, for he was in such high spirits that he simply had to have  fun of some sort.    First, however, he decided to stop and dig up a bone that he had buried  in the flower garden. So he trotted across the yard. And as he drew near  the farmhouse he changed his plans all at once. He forgot his bone and  he forgot his woodchuck, too. For he caught sight of something that had  escaped his eye before. Stretched on the ledge outside one of the  kitchen windows Miss Kitty Cat was enjoying a nap in the sunshine.    \"Aha!\" said Spot very softly. \"Aha! Here's a bit of luck.\" And he turned  sharply aside and hurried towards the house, to come to a dead stop  beneath the window and stand there motionless with his nose pointing at  the sleeping form of Miss Kitty.    Though Spot didn't make the slightest noise the sleeper suddenly opened  her eyes.    \"_Tchah!_\" she exclaimed, springing to her feet and glaring at her  annoyer.    If the window hadn't been closed no doubt Miss Kitty would have slipped  through it into the kitchen. But there was no escape that way.    \"It's a pity,\" she muttered, \"that a person can't take a cat nap without  being stared at by this old dog. I think it's about time I took my  neighbor's advice and taught him to keep his eyes and his nose where  they belong.\"    Then Miss Kitty Cat jumped. She jumped off the window ledge straight at  old dog Spot, who was still gazing up at her from below.    When he saw her coming he gave a startled yelp and tried to dodge her.  But he was too slow. Miss Kitty Cat landed squarely on his back and  clawed him savagely.    Old Spot dashed half way across the farmyard, then dropped suddenly and  rolled over and over on the ground.    The next instant he was on his feet again and tearing toward the barn.  Though Miss Kitty had dropped off his back and was already on her way to  the house he did not look around to see what had become of her.    Spot bolted through the barn door and scurried into an empty stall,  where he jumped into the manger and cowered down in the hay that half  filled it, and moaned.    [Illustration: Spot Bolted Through the Barn Door.    (_Page 16_)]    It was the stall next to the old horse Ebenezer's. And that mild fellow  peered over at him in wonder. \"What has happened?\" he inquired.    \"The cat scratched me,\" Spot told him. \"I was teasing her and she wasn't  at all nice about it.\"    \"What were you doing--pointing at her?\" Ebenezer asked him.    \"Yes!\"    \"I suppose it made her wild,\" the old horse remarked. \"And a wild cat is  a dangerous creature.\"    Spot whined fretfully. He wished he could lick his wounds. But how can  one lick scratches when they are behind one's ears?    \"I was a wild dog for a few moments,\" he groaned. \"I never dreamed she  would plump down on me like that.\"    \"Haven't you ever heard of it's raining cats and dogs?\" Ebenezer said.  \"Well, to-day it rained cats.\"          IV    THE WOODPILE      Farmer Green always had a woodpile in the back yard. Sometimes it was  big. Sometimes it was little. Sometimes it was mostly made up of  four-foot logs. Sometimes the logs were all split and sawed, ready to  burn.    When Farmer Green and the hired man had nothing more pressing to do they  set to work on the woodpile. It was surprising how fast the big sticks  grew into firewood under their axes and saws.    One day they started sawing and splitting when Johnnie Green and old dog  Spot were roaming through the woods. And when Johnnie and Spot came  back home, just in time for dinner, they found a great heap of firewood  lying on the ground where there had been nothing but dirt when they  started for the woods some hours before.    Old dog Spot ran straight to the woodpile and began sniffing and  scratching and whining.    If Johnnie Green hadn't been hungry he would have paid more heed to  Spot's behavior. But the men had already gone into the house. And  Johnnie hurried after them, leaving Spot to nose about the woodpile as  he pleased.    \"Humph!\" Spot growled. \"Seems to me Johnnie Green might stay here a  while and help me. I've been chasing woodchucks and squirrels for him  all the morning. And I showed him a few birds, too.\"    Spot never once left the woodpile while Johnnie was eating his dinner.  When Johnnie and his father and the hired man came out of the house  later old Spot began to yelp. He made frantic efforts to burrow down  beneath the pile of firewood, stopping now and then to run up to his  young master and bark.    Now that he had had his dinner, Johnnie Green was all ready for any sort  of fun.    \"Spot smells some kind of game in the woodpile!\" Johnnie exclaimed.    \"Perhaps he does,\" said his father. \"But I don't see how he's going to  get hold of it unless we move the woodpile. And I don't believe we'll  quit work to help the old dog catch a chipmunk--or maybe a rat.\"    \"Come on!\" Spot begged Johnnie, as plainly as he could bark. \"Move some  of this wood for me! There's something under it that I want to get my  teeth on.\"    \"All right! All right!\" Johnnie told him. And to his father Johnnie  said, \"Do you care if I throw some of the stove wood over on the other  side of the pile?\"    \"If you're going to move any wood--\" Farmer Green replied with a wink at  the hired man--\"if you're going to move any wood you might as well move  it into the woodshed and pile it up neatly.\"    When he heard that suggestion Johnnie Green looked very glum. For a  minute or two he thought he wouldn't bother to help old Spot find what  he was looking for. But Spot teased and teased. And Johnnie couldn't  help being curious to know what it was that Spot was after.    \"Maybe there's a muskrat here,\" he said to himself. \"If there is, I'll  have his skin to pay me for my trouble.\"          V    A DEEP SECRET      Old Spot wouldn't let Johnnie Green alone. He kept jumping against him  and whining, begging him to move some of the wood, because there was  something very, very interesting beneath it.    Still Johnnie hesitated. He hadn't intended to do any work that  afternoon.    \"After all,\" he thought, \"I'll have to help carry in this wood sooner or  later. Really, I might as well take some of it into the woodshed now.\"    To Spot's delight he bent over and began gathering an armful of wood.    \"Wow! Wow!\" Spot howled. \"Thank goodness I'm going to get what's under  this pile, after all.\"    Johnnie Green carried armful after armful of wood from the yard and  piled it in the shed back of the kitchen. All the time old dog Spot was  urging him with yelps and barks and whines and moans to move faster. And  all the time Johnnie Green was working as spryly as he could.    Whatever it might be that Spot wanted to get under the woodpile in the  yard, Johnnie hoped it wouldn't escape through the crevices between the  sticks.    \"I don't want to get myself all tired out for nothing,\" Johnnie said to  himself. \"I was going fishing this afternoon.\"    While Johnnie hurried back and forth between the woodpile and the shed  Spot clawed away at the edge of the pile. He thrust his nose beneath  loose sticks and pushed them about. He uttered pitiful sounds.    \"I never saw that dog take on so,\" Farmer Green remarked.    \"And I never saw Johnnie work so hard,\" said the hired man. \"When  there's wood to be carried in he's usually a mile away.\"    Farmer Green laughed.    \"He'll quit as soon as Spot gets what he wants,\" he replied. \"It's too  bad this sort of thing doesn't happen oftener. Except for driving the  cows home, this is the first time I ever knew a boy and a dog to do much  besides play, when they're together.\"    Turkey Proudfoot, the huge gobbler, came hurrying around the corner of  the barn to see what was going on. He had an idea that he ruled the  farmyard.    \"What's all this row about?\" he gobbled at old Spot. \"Have you lost  something?\"    \"Yes!\" Spot told him. \"Johnnie Green's helping me to find it. We're  moving part of the woodpile.\"    \"What did you lose?\" Turkey Proudfoot demanded.    Old Spot pretended not to hear him. He began barking again at Johnnie  Green.    Mr. Catbird, who loved to play jokes on everybody, started mewing from  his hiding place under the lilac bushes. He had noticed Spot's antics.  And he hoped to fool him into thinking there was a strange cat around  the place. For Spot was a famous chaser of all cats--so long as they  kept running away from him and didn't turn around and try to scratch  him.    To Mr. Catbird's astonishment old Spot paid no heed to his catcalls.    \"This is queer,\" Mr. Catbird muttered. \"Whenever I've mewed before he  has always come a-running. There must be something uncommonly  interesting under that woodpile.\"          VI    BURIED TREASURE      Henrietta Hen, who was one of the busiest busybodies on the farm, came  along and stood and watched old dog Spot while he dug and scratched and  howled about the woodpile.    \"What on earth is the matter with you?\" she asked him. \"I don't make  half that fuss when I've just laid an egg and really have something to  cackle about.\"    \"I've no time to talk with you now,\" Spot told Henrietta Hen. \"Can't you  see that Johnnie Green and I are moving the woodpile?\"    \"Why are you doing that?\" Henrietta inquired.    \"There's something beneath it that I want,\" he said hurriedly.    Henrietta Hen gave a sudden start.    \"I"]]]
