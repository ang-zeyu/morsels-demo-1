This is no poet's dream, but the stern reality of a young  surgeon's work in hospital, extending over three memorable years of  achievement in a virgin field. Dr. Brinkley has worked out his problem  alone, save for the devoted aid of his wife, who is also a licensed  physician. He is today a poor man, and expects to remain so, because he  has refused every alluring offer made him looking to the establishment  of this Goat-Gland operation as a commercial proposition on a big scale.  He is governed by his ethical vows, and retains his independence, but  the world would call him a fool for not turning his discovery to his  greatest pecuniary profit. Since he prefers to remain true to his ideals  in this matter it is for us at least to be thankful, and accord him the  recognition to which the scientist is entitled who puts his work above  his profits.    Chicago, April, 1921.          CHAPTER I    DR. BRINKLEY'S THEORY      We are not privileged to be discursive in a little book which seeks to  hit the nail on the head in every paragraph, drive it home in every  page, and clinch it in every chapter, and there would be no excuse,  therefore, for sketching, even in brief outline, the history of the  various attempts that have been made, from Brown-Sequard, with his  Elixir, to Metchnikoff, with his benevolent bacteria of the intestinal  tract, to extract from Life its secret of human longevity. It has been a  long quest, and, in the main, fruitless, though it might be said in  fairness that Brown-Sequard's method of using the expressed testicular  juice as a medicine, by mouth or injection, for the renewal of youth,  was probably the true parent of the present familiar method of using the  extracts of various glands, or the pulverized substance of the glands  themselves, notably the thyroid and the adrenal, as medicines to be  taken internally for the relief of various diseased conditions. The  constant objection to such form of medication is, of course, that when  the medicine is stopped the good results stop, so that a temporary  relief is the utmost that can be hoped for from the method. Genius is  synthetic, elliptic, sudden, but always clear and sure. Dr. Brinkley  began with a theory, and by no means a new theory. From the theory he  deduced rapidly, and acted. The results of the acts proved the truth of  the theory. That theory has been variously stated, its most familiar  form being, \"In all living forms the basis of all energy is sex-energy.\"    Looking about for facts to confirm or disprove this assertion all  investigators have been faced with similar phenomena, such as:    When the male fowl is sterilized in order that he may grow big and fat  for the market later he loses his cock's plumage and gains in weight. In  the psychic domain the changes are still more marked. The capon is a  coward, shunning the contest for supremacy. He does not forage for the  hens, inviting them to feed upon what he has found, but looks after  himself first and last. He is lazy, sluggish, and selfish.    The stallion is a proud and beautiful animal, and Job's description of  the war-horse \"He paweth in the valley and rejoiceth in his strength, He  goeth on to meet the armed men!\" with its context, is still the best  word-painting we have of the majesty of the horse in full possession of  his sexual powers. The gelding is tractable and useful, and the absence  of the fiery impatience of the stallion fits the gelding for man's use.    When men are castrated, as in the East, in youth, where they are prized  as custodians of the harem, they are fat, usually large of frame, but  short-lived. The growth of hair on the head is often scant; on the face  and body it is altogether missing. The voice is high, partaking of a  treble quality. When through surgical operation or accident it happens  that a man is deprived of the testicular glands in youth, early manhood,  or even middle-age, the same changes follow as in the case of the  eunuch, the hair on face and body disappears, the voice changes from  deep to high tone, and mentally the man develops inertia and cowardice.  Physically, he puts on fat almost immediately.    When women have, for any reason, had their ovaries removed by surgical  operation, marked changes follow, which vary much in detail, but carry  certain general similarities. The face and body age rapidly in  appearance, and there is a slowing up of functions of the organs, with a  tendency to masculinity in tastes, behavior, feelings.    Noting these and many other phenomena, as many had done before him, Dr.  Brinkley concluded that the testes of the male and the ovaries of the  female performed corresponding offices for each sex, generating the  vital fluids which, when not fulfilling their primary object of  reproducing the species, were turned back into the blood and absorbed by  the tissues for the benefit of the individual's physical and mental  processes. Normal activity of the secretions of the sex-glands,  therefore, meant, in Dr. Brinkley's opinion, right nourishment for all  the cells of the body, and right functioning of all the organs of the  body. The strength and speed of the stallion in health were as much due  to the right action of the sex-glands as his full-arched neck, his  blazing eye, or his thick mane and tail. And since the capon and the  eunuch acquired a cowardice that avoided fatigue, effort, or conflict,  it was clear that the mental qualities were as directly influenced by  the testicular secretion as the physical. It followed that the  well-nourished brain, capable of sustained concentration and clear  thinking, must necessarily be the brain that was fed by the normal  activity of the sex-glands, and it also followed that since youth in man  and woman is the time of matured beauty of face and form in man and  woman, when sexual secretions are of normal activity, therefore, the  sexual secretions were mainly responsible for the development of matured  beauty of face and form. From this it was clear and evident that the  haggard face, the lined face, the over-thin or the over-fat body,  phemonena familiar to all of us in men and women who have passed their  youth, were due in the main to lack of nourishment of the body-cells by  the seminal fluid, with lack of proper functioning of the organs, and  resultant lack of proper elimination of waste matter from the system,  producing that condition of slowing-down of the machine which is a part  of the aging process of the body and mind of man and woman, as seen in  all men and all women today.    It is important always that you realize that though we may seem to  stress the physical improvement in human beings brought about by this  gland-transplantation, the more important change of the two is the  mental, and Dr. Brinkley's theory that ALL ENERGY IS SEX-ENERGY means  exactly that the powerful brain equally with the beautiful face owes its  strength and vigor exactly to the right functioning of the sex-glands.    We must not be accused here of running to extravagance. It is not stated  that all human brains are of equal power or can be developed to equal  power. It is stated that all human brains of unusual power are brains  that are well-nourished by the testicular secretions, and it is implied,  with full understanding of what this statement leads to, that if, for  any reason, there is an interference with this sex-gland activity, the  unusual brain will cease in a short time to be unusual in its power,  grasp, and faculty of clear, continuous thought. Similarly it is stated  that if this unusual brain, after losing its power of sustained  thinking, is again fed by the renewed activities of the sex-glands, it  will re-establish its power, and the mind will display its former  brilliance.    You see how amazing and far-reaching is the application of this  apparently simple theory that sex-energy is the basis of all human  energy.    It is, after all, only another way of saying that all things proceed  from a common source, that Life is One, that Mind and Body derive from  the same source, that energy is so much an integral of matter, that in  the final analysis matter is only static energy; since the atom is made  of molecules, and molecules of electrons, and electrons of electricity,  or energy.    In saying, therefore, that sex-energy is at the basis of all human  energy we may quite possibly be trending towards a solution of the  world-old question of what Life itself is. Some day, without a doubt, we  shall surprise this secret at its source. At present we are fortunate to  have discovered, through Dr. Brinkley's careful proving of his theory,  that human energy, no matter whether its manifestation be physical or  mental, has a common base of supply, the sex-glands, and that their  activity determines a brilliant mentality, or a dull brain; a state of  health, or a state of disease; beauty of form and feature and skin, or  wrinkles, sallowness and ugliness. These appearances and qualities are  phenomena which have the same source, or base. Many have felt this to be  true. Dr. Brinkley alone has had the wit and skill to find the means to  solve the problem as it should be solved to be of any value to humanity,  namely, to discover how the inactivity can be changed to activity, how  the blood of man and woman can be charged anew with the life-giving  hormones, perhaps, or whatever may be the name of that substance  secreted by the sex-glands and used by the blood to nourish all the  cells of the body, which MUST be present in the system if body and mind  are to continue to function at their best.

MEN      Dr. Brinkley"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/2938"],[0,"Yeast (#2)"],[1,", to the  ascertained facts relating to the barm or the yeast; secondly, what has  come of the attempt to ascertain distinctly what is the nature of the  products which are produced by fermentation; then what has come of the  attempt to understand the relation between the yeast and the products;  and lastly, what very curious side issues if I may so call them--have  branched out in the course of this inquiry, which has now occupied  somewhere about two centuries.    The first thing was to make out precisely and clearly what was the  nature of this substance, this apparently mere scum and mud that we  call yeast. And that was first commenced seriously by a wonderful old  Dutchman of the name of Leeuwenhoek, who lived some two hundred years  ago, and who was the first person to invent thoroughly trustworthy  microscopes of high powers. Now, Leeuwenhoek went to work upon this  yeast mud, and by applying to it high powers of the microscope, he  discovered that it was no mere mud such as you might at first suppose,  but that it was a substance made up of an enormous multitude of minute  grains, each of which had just as definite a form as if it were a grain  of corn, although it was vastly smaller, the largest of these not being  more than the two-thousandth of an inch in diameter; while, as you  know, a grain of corn is a large thing, and the very smallest of  these particles were not more than the seven-thousandth of an inch in  diameter. Leeuwenhoek saw that this muddy stuff was in reality a liquid,  in which there were floating this immense number of definitely shaped  particles, all aggregated in heaps and lumps and some of them separate.  That discovery remained, so to speak, dormant for fully a century, and  then the question was taken up by a French discoverer, who, paying  great attention and having the advantage of better instruments than  Leeuwenhoek had, watched these things and made the astounding discovery  that they were bodies which were constantly being reproduced and  growing; than when one of these rounded bodies was once formed and had  grown to its full size, it immediately began to give off a little bud  from one side, and then that bud grew out until it had attained the  full size of the first, and that, in this way, the yeast particle was  undergoing a process of multiplication by budding, just as effectual and  just as complete as the process of multiplication of a plant by  budding; and thus this Frenchman, Cagniard de la Tour, arrived at  the conclusion--very creditable to his sagacity, and which has been  confirmed by every observation and reasoning since--that this apparently  muddy refuse was neither more nor less than a mass of plants, of minute  living plants, growing and multiplying in the sugary fluid in which the  yeast is formed. And from that time forth we have known this substance  which forms the scum and the lees as the yeast plant; and it has  received a scientific name--which I may use without thinking of it,  and which I will therefore give you--namely, \"Torula.\" Well, this was a  capital discovery. The next thing to do was to make out how this torula  was related to the other plants. I won't weary you with the whole course  of investigation, but I may sum up its results, and they are these--that  the torula is a particular kind of a fungus, a particular state  rather, of a fungus or mould. There are many moulds which under certain  conditions give rise to this torula condition, to a substance which is  not distinguishable from yeast, and which has the same properties as  yeast--that is to say, which is able to decompose sugar in the curious  way that we shall consider by-and-by. So that the yeast plant is a plant  belonging to a group of the Fungi, multiplying and growing and living in  this very remarkable manner in the sugary fluid which is, so to speak,  the nidus or home of the yeast.    That, in a few words, is, as far as investigation--by the help of one's  eye and by the help of the microscope--has taken us. But now there is an  observer whose methods of observation are more refined than those of men  who use their eye, even though it be aided by the microscope; a man who  sees indirectly further than we can see directly--that is, the chemist;  and the chemist took up this question, and his discovery was not less  remarkable than that of the microscopist. The chemist discovered that  the yeast plant being composed of a sort of bag, like a bladder, inside  which is a peculiar soft, semifluid material--the chemist found that  this outer bladder has the same composition as the substance of wood,  that material which is called \"cellulose,\" and which consists of the  elements carbon and hydrogen and oxygen, without any nitrogen. But then  he also found (the first person to discover it was an Italian chemist,  named Fabroni, in the end of the last century) that this inner matter  which was contained in the bag, which constitutes the yeast plant, was a  substance containing the elements carbon and hydrogen and oxygen and  nitrogen; that it was what Fabroni called a vegeto-animal substance, and  that it had the peculiarities of what are commonly called \"animal  products.\"    This again was an exceedingly remarkable discovery. It lay neglected  for a time, until it was subsequently taken up by the great chemists of  modern times, and they, with their delicate methods of analysis, have  finally decided that, in all essential respects, the substance which  forms the chief part of the contents of the yeast plant is identical  with the material which forms the chief part of our own muscles, which  forms the chief part of our own blood, which forms the chief part of  the white of the egg; that, in fact, although this little organism is  a plant, and nothing but a plant, yet that its active living contents  contain a substance which is called \"protein,\" which is of the same  nature as the substance which forms the foundation of every animal  organism whatever.    Now we come next to the question of the analysis of the products, of  that which is produced during the process of fermentation. So far back  as the beginning of the 16th century, in the times of transition between  the old alchemy and the modern chemistry, there was a remarkable man,  Von Helmont, a Dutchman, who saw the difference between the air which  comes out of a vat where something is fermenting and common air. He was  the man who invented the term \"gas,\" and he called this kind of gas \"gas  silvestre\"--so to speak gas that is wild, and lives in out of the way  places--having in his mind the identity of this particular kind of air  with that which is found in some caves and cellars. Then, the gradual  process of investigation going on, it was discovered that this  substance, then called \"fixed air,\" was a poisonous gas, and it was  finally identified with that kind of gas which is obtained by burning  charcoal in the air, which is called \"carbonic acid.\" Then the  substance alcohol was subjected to examination, and it was found to be  a combination of carbon, and hydrogen, and oxygen. Then the sugar which  was contained in the fermenting liquid was examined and that was found  to contain the three elements carbon, hydrogen, and oxygen. So that  it was clear there were in sugar the fundamental elements which are  contained in the carbonic acid, and in the alcohol. And then came that  great chemist Lavoisier, and he examined into the subject carefully,  and possessed with that brilliant thought of his which happens to be  propounded exactly apropos to this matter of fermentation--that no  matter is ever lost, but that matter only changes its form and changes  its combinations--he endeavoured to make out what became of the sugar  which was subjected to fermentation. He thought he discovered that the  whole weight of the sugar was represented by the carbonic acid produced;  that in other words, supposing this tumbler to represent the sugar, that  the action of fermentation was as it were the splitting of it, the one  half going away in the shape of carbonic acid, and the other half going  away in the shape of alcohol. Subsequent inquiry, careful research with  the refinements of modern chemistry, have been applied to this problem,  and they have shown that Lavoisier was not quite correct; that what he  says is quite true for about 95 per cent. of the sugar, but that the  other 5 per cent., or nearly so, is converted into two other things;  one of them, matter which is called succinic acid, and the other  matter which is called glycerine, which you all know now as one of the  commonest of household matters. It may be that we have not got to the  end of this refined analysis yet, but at any rate, I suppose I may  say--and I speak with some little hesitation for fear my friend  Professor Roscoe here may pick me up for trespassing upon his  province--but I believe I may say that now we can account for 99 per  cent. at least of the sugar, and that 99 per cent. is split up into  these four things, carbonic acid, alcohol, succinic acid, and glycerine.  So that it may be that none of the sugar whatever disappears, and  that only its parts, so to speak, are re-arranged, and if any of it  disappears, certainly it is a very small portion.    Now these are the facts of the case. There is the fact of the growth of  the yeast plant; and there is the fact of the splitting up of the sugar.  What relation have these two facts to one another?    For a very long time that was a great matter of dispute. The early  French observers, to do them justice, discerned the real state of the  case, namely, that there was a very close connection between the actual  life of the yeast plant and this operation of the splitting up of the  sugar; and that one was in some way or other connected with the other.  All investigation subsequently has confirmed this original idea. It has  been shown that if you take any measures by which other plants of"]]]
