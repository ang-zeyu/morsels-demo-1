Then they said: \"We must go and  tell our King all that has befallen the mice. We must not fail to tell  him this calamity.\"    Whereupon they all rose up and went their way in deep sorrow; one  beating the muffled drum, one tolling the bell; all had shawls around  their necks; their tears the while running in little streams down their  whiskers.    Arrived where the King was sitting on his throne, the mice paid homage  to him, saying: \"Master, we are subjects and thou art King. Behold the  cat has treated us cruelly since he became a pious follower of Mahomet.  Whereas, before his conversion he was wont to catch only one of us in a  year, now that he is a sincere Mussulman his appetite has so increased  that only five at a time will satisfy him.\"    Whereupon the King fell into such a violent rage that he resembled a  saucepan boiling over. But to the deputation of mice he spoke very  kindly, calling them his newly-arrived and welcome guests, and to  comfort them vowed that he would give the cat such a chastisement that  the news of it should circulate through the world.    Then, observing their grief, he commanded that the dead mouse should be  buried with all pomp and ceremony. Accordingly they made lamentation  for a whole week, as though it had been for one of royal degree; and  having prepared delicious sweetmeats, they placed them in baskets and  carried them with streaming eyes to the grave.    After the burial service, the King ordered the army to assemble on a  given day on the great sandy plain that stretches as far as the eye can  see around the city. Then he addressed them, saying:    \"Oh, men and soldiers, inasmuch as the cat has so cruelly ill-treated  our countrymen, he being a heretic and an evil doer, and brutal in  nature, we must now go to the city of Kerman and fight him.\"    So three hundred and thirty thousand mice went forth, armed with  swords, guns, and spears; and with flags and pennons bravely flying. A  passing Arab from the desert, skilfully balancing himself on the back  of a swift-traveling camel by means of a long pole, spied the great  army in motion, and was so overcome with astonishment that he lost his  balance and fell off. Several regiments of mice were put out of action  by his fall; but nothing daunted, the army pressed on.    When the army was ready for battle, the King again addressed them  saying: \"O young men, an ambassador must be sent to the cat, one who is  able, discreet, and eloquent.\" Then they all shouted: \"The King's  orders shall be carried out! Upon our heads be it.\"    Now, there was present a learned and eloquent mouse, the ruler of a  province, and he it was that the King commanded to go as an ambassador  to the cat in the city of Kerman. Almost before his name was out of the  King's mouth, he had jumped out of his place in the ranks, and,  traveling swiftly as the winds of the desert, he went in boldly before  the cat and said:    \"As an ambassador from the King of the Mice am I come, bowed down with  grief and fatigue. Know this, my master has determined to wage war, and  is even now come with his army to take off your head.\"    The cat roared out in reply, \"Go tell your King to eat dust! I come not  out of this city except at my good pleasure!\" Then he sent messengers  to bring up quickly some fighting and hunting cats from Khorassan--the  land of the sun--to Kerman.    As soon as the cat's army was ready, the King of the Cats gave them  marching orders, promising to come himself to the battle on the next  day. The cats came out on horseback, each one like a hungry tiger. The  mice also mounted their steeds, armed to the teeth, and boiling with  rage. Shouting \"Allah! Allah!\" the armies fell upon each other with  unsheathed swords.    So many cats and mice were killed that there was no room for the  horses' feet. The cats fought valiantly, their fierce attacks carrying  them through the first line of the mice, then through the second, and  many Ameers and chiefs were killed. The mice, thinking the battle lost,  turned to flee, crying out:    \"Throw dust upon your heads, young men!\"    But afterwards, rallying again, they faced their pursuers and attacked  the right wing of the cat's army, shouting their battle cry of \"Allah!  Allah!\"    In the thickest of the fray a mounted mouse speared the King of the  Cats, so that he fell fainting to the ground. Before he could rise, the  mouse leaped upon him and brought him captive to the King. So the cats  were defeated on that day and sullenly retreated to the city of Kerman.    Having bound the cat, the mice beat him until he became unconscious.  Then the plain echoed with the beating of tom-toms and shouts of joy.  Then the King of the Mice seated himself on his throne and ordered the  cat to be brought before him.    \"Scoundrel!\" he said to him, \"Why hast thou eaten up my army? Hear now  the King of the Mice.\" The cat hung his head in fear, and remained  silent. After a few minutes, he said: \"I am thy servant, even to  death.\" Then the King replied:    \"Carry this black-faced dog to the execution ground. I will come in  person without delay to kill him in revenge for the blood of my  slaughtered subjects.\"    So he mounted his elephant, and his guard marched proudly before him.  The cat, with his hands tied together, stood weeping. Upon arriving at  the execution grounds and discerning that the cat was not yet executed,  the King said angrily to the hangman: \"Why is it this prisoner is still  alive? Hang him immediately!\"    At that very moment a horseman came galloping furiously from the city  and besought the King, saying: \"Forgive this miserable cat; in future  he will do us no harm.\" However, the King turned a deaf ear to his  entreaties, ordering that the cat be killed at once. The mice  hesitated, being unwilling, through fear, to carry out the order.    Of course, this made the King very angry. \"O foolish mice!\" he cried,  \"Ye will all take pity on the cat, in order that he may again make a  sacrifice of you.\"    Directly the cat saw the horseman, his courage revived. With one bound  he sprang from his place as does the tiger on his prey, burst his bonds  asunder, and seized five unfortunate mice. The other mice, filled with  dismay and terror, ran hither and thither, crying wildly:    \"Allah! Allah! Shoot him! Cut off his head, as did Rastam his enemies  on the day of battle!\"    When the King of the Mice saw what, had happened, he fainted; whereupon  the cat leaped on him, pulled off his crown, and placing the rope over  his head, hanged him, so that he died immediately.    Then he darted here and there, seizing and slaying, and dashing mice to  the earth, till the whole army of mice was routed, and there was none  left to oppose him.          THE SON OF THE SOAP SELLER      PERSIAN FAIRY TALES      The Son of the Soap Seller      Cleverly proving that a princess with a necklace can frustrate the  intentions of a Ghool, and that every king should have near his person  the owner of a crystal cup.      THERE once dwelt a poor but worthy man named Abdullah in Meshed, the  Holy City, the place of pilgrimage, whose beautiful mosque with the  golden dome is the glory of the kingdom of Persia. He barely managed to  get a living by the sale of soap.    All day long, from sunrise to sunset, he tramped the city, crying out:  \"O brothers, buy my pure soap. There is none better in the city, as  every one knows. Even the little babes would say so if they could but  speak.\"    Still, if you looked closely at it, you would never guess it to be  soap; it was black and coarse, and more like wood than anything else.  If any unlucky pilgrim used it on his face or hands, it would make his  skin burn like fire. But this did not often happen, for the people in  Persia do not use much soap on themselves, or their clothes, and sand  does very well for cleaning cooking pots and pans. So it was that there  were many days when poor Abdullah did not sell enough to buy sufficient  bread for himself and his little boy Ahmed.    At such times, the father would creep sadly into his wretched mud-built  hovel, and bury his face in his hands, so that he might not see his son  trying to keep back the tears caused by hunger. The little fellow,  however, now ten years of age, would comfort his father by saying:    \"Inshallah\"--if God wills--\"to-morrow you will sell more soap than you  have done for weeks past.\" And the father, looking into the bright,  open face of his boy, would take courage, and pray that this might be  so.    But the days went on and things became blacker and blacker, when one  day an adventure befell little Ahmed. He was on his way to school, and  as the sun was very hot, he sought the shelter of the big plane-trees  that lined the banks of the stream flowing down the center of the  principal street.    Women were filling their water jugs, or washing clothes; a string of  camels were drinking; several donkeys were rolling playfully over and  over in the water, and some dyers were wringing out newly-dyed  garments, causing waves of many colors to flow past.    Just as Ahmed had stopped to look, a dervish, leading a fine lion by a  chain, and some runners with curious hats and coats rushed past,  shouting:    \"Make way for the King! Turn your faces to the wall!\" And there was the  great King, seated on a beautiful Arabian horse, surrounded by  soldiers. Then there passed a palanquin borne on the backs of four  mules.    The party stopped just opposite to Ahmed, and from the palanquin there  alighted a lady closely veiled, evidently wishing to inspect some  beautiful Meshed silver work. Before she could reach the shop, a great  tumult arose among the people. The lion had broken his chain and was  madly leaping here and there, tearing and rending and dashing people to  the ground. Women fainted, men fled, little children stood still and  cried pitifully, some jumped into"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/2449"],[0,"The Common Law (#2)"],[1,"se; and then perhaps the  reason is shifted, and it is said that there ought to be a remedy  against some one who can pay the damages, or that such wrongful  acts as by ordinary human laws are likely to happen in the course  of the service are imputable to the service.    Next, take a case where a limit has been set to liability which  had previously been unlimited. In 1851, Congress passed a law,  which is still in force, and by which the owners of ships in all  the more common cases of maritime loss can surrender the vessel  and her freight then pending to the losers; and it is provided  that, thereupon, further proceedings against the owners shall  cease. The legislators to whom we owe this act argued that, if a  merchant embark a portion of his property upon a hazardous  venture, it is reasonable that his stake should be confined to  what [7] he puts at risk,--a principle similar to that on which  corporations have been so largely created in America during the  last fifty years.    It has been a rule of criminal pleading in England down into the  present century, that an indictment for homicide must set forth  the value of the instrument causing the death, in order that the  king or his grantee might claim forfeiture of the deodand, \"as an  accursed thing,\" in the language of Blackstone.    I might go on multiplying examples; but these are enough to show  the remoteness of the points to be brought together.--As a first  step towards a generalization, it will be necessary to consider  what is to be found in ancient and independent systems of law.    There is a well-known passage in Exodus, /1/ which we shall have  to remember later: \"If an ox gore a man or a woman, that they  die: then the ox shall be surely stoned, and his flesh shall not  be eaten; but the owner of the ox shall be quit.\" When we turn  from the Jews to the Greeks, we find the principle of the passage  just quoted erected into a system. Plutarch, in his Solon, tells  us that a dog that had bitten a man was to be delivered up bound  to a log four cubits long. Plato made elaborate provisions in his  Laws for many such cases. If a slave killed a man, he was to be  given up to the relatives of the deceased. /2/ If he wounded a  man, he was to be given up to the injured party to use him as he  pleased. /3/ So if he did damage to which the injured party did  not contribute as a joint cause. In either case, if the owner [8]  failed to surrender the slave, he was bound to make good the  loss. /1/ If a beast killed a man, it was to be slain and cast  beyond the borders. If an inanimate thing caused death, it was to  be cast beyond the borders in like manner, and expiation was to  be made. /2/ Nor was all this an ideal creation of merely  imagined law, for it was said in one of the speeches of  Aeschines, that \"we banish beyond our borders stocks and stones  and steel, voiceless and mindless things, if they chance to kill  a man; and if a man commits suicide, bury the hand that struck  the blow afar from its body.\" This is mentioned quite as an  every-day matter, evidently without thinking it at all  extraordinary, only to point an antithesis to the honors heaped  upon Demosthenes. /3/ As late as the second century after Christ  the traveller Pausanias observed with some surprise that they  still sat in judgment on inanimate things in the Prytaneum. /4/  Plutarch attributes the institution to Draco. /5/    In the Roman law we find the similar principles of the noxoe  deditio gradually leading to further results. The Twelve Tables  (451 B.C.) provided that, if an animal had done damage, either  the animal was to be surrendered or the damage paid for. /6/ We  learn from Gains that the same rule was applied to the torts of  children or slaves, /7/ and there is some trace of it with regard  to inanimate things.    The Roman lawyers, not looking beyond their own [9] system or  their own time, drew on their wits for an explanation which would  show that the law as they found it was reasonable. Gaius said  that it was unjust that the fault of children or slaves should be  a source of loss to their parents or owners beyond their own  bodies, and Ulpian reasoned that a fortiori this was true of  things devoid of life, and therefore incapable of fault. /1/ This  way of approaching the question seems to deal with the right of  surrender as if it were a limitation of a liability incurred by a  parent or owner, which would naturally and in the first instance  be unlimited. But if that is what was meant, it puts the cart  before the horse. The right of surrender was not introduced as a  limitation of liability, but, in Rome and Greece alike, payment  was introduced as the alternative of a failure to surrender.    The action was not based, as it would be nowadays, on the fault  of the parent or owner. If it had been, it would always have been  brought against the person who had control of the slave or animal  at the time it did the harm complained of, and who, if any one,  was to blame for not preventing the injury. So far from this  being the course, the person to be sued was the owner at the time  of suing. The action followed the guilty thing into whosesoever  hands it came. /2/ And in curious contrast with the principle as  inverted to meet still more modern views of public policy, if the  animal was of a wild nature, that is, in the very case of the  most ferocious animals, the owner ceased to be liable the moment  it escaped, because at that moment he ceased to be owner. /3/  There [10] seems to have been no other or more extensive  liability by the old law, even where a slave was guilty with his  master's knowledge, unless perhaps he was a mere tool in his  master's hands. /1/ Gains and Ulpian showed an inclination to cut  the noxoe deditio down to a privilege of the owner in case of  misdeeds committed without his knowledge; but Ulpian is obliged  to admit, that by the ancient law, according to Celsus, the  action was noxal where a slave was guilty even with the privity  of his master. /2/    All this shows very clearly that the liability of the owner was  merely a way of getting at the slave or animal which was the  immediate cause of offence. In other words, vengeance on the  immediate offender was the object of the Greek and early Roman  process, not indemnity from the master or owner. The liability of  the owner was simply a liability of the offending thing. In the  primitive customs of Greece it was enforced by a judicial process  expressly directed against the object, animate or inanimate. The  Roman Twelve Tables made the owner, instead of the thing itself,  the defendant, but did not in any way change the ground of  liability, or affect its limit. The change was simply a device to  allow the owner to protect his interest. /3/    But it may be asked how inanimate objects came to be [11] pursued  in this way, if the object of the procedure was to gratify the  passion of revenge. Learned men have been ready to find a reason  in the personification of inanimate nature common to savages and  children, and there is much to confirm this view. Without such a  personification, anger towards lifeless things would have been  transitory, at most. It is noticeable that the commonest example  in the most primitive customs and laws is that of a tree which  falls upon a man, or from which he falls and is killed. We can  conceive with comparative ease how a tree might have been put on  the same footing with animals. It certainly was treated like  them, and was delivered to the relatives, or chopped to pieces  for the gratification of a real or simulated passion. /1/    In the Athenian process there is also, no doubt, to be traced a  different thought. Expiation is one of the ends most insisted on  by Plato, and appears to have been the purpose of the procedure  mentioned by Aeschines. Some passages in the Roman historians  which will be mentioned again seem to point in the same  direction. /2/    Another peculiarity to be noticed is, that the liability seems to  have been regarded as attached to the body doing the damage, in  an almost physical sense. An untrained intelligence only  imperfectly performs the analysis by which jurists carry  responsibility back to the beginning of a chain of causation. The  hatred for anything giving us pain, which wreaks itself on the  manifest cause, and which leads even civilized man to kick a door  when it pinches his finger, is embodied in the noxoe deditio and  [12] other kindred doctrines of early Roman law. There is a  defective passage in Gaius, which seems to say that liability may  sometimes be escaped by giving up even the dead body of the  offender. /1/ So Livy relates that, Brutulus Papins having caused  a breach of truce with the Romans, the Samnites determined to  surrender him, and that, upon his avoiding disgrace and  punishment by suicide, they sent his lifeless body. It is  noticeable that the surrender seems to be regarded as the natural  expiation for the breach of treaty, /2/ and that it is equally a  matter of course to send the body when the wrong-doer has  perished. /3/    The most curious examples of this sort occur in the region of  what we should now call contract. Livy again furnishes an  example, if, indeed, the last is not one. The Roman Consul  Postumius concluded the disgraceful peace of the Caudine Forks  (per sponsionem, as Livy says, denying the common story that it  was per feedus), and he was sent to Rome to obtain the sanction  of the people. When there however, he proposed that the persons  who had made the [13] contract, including himself, should be  given up in satisfaction of it. For, he said, the Roman people  not having sanctioned the agreement, who is so ignorant of the  jus fetialium as not to know that they are released from  obligation by surrendering us? The formula of surrender seems to  bring the case within the noxoe deditio. /1/ Cicero narrates a  similar surrender of Mancinus"]]]
