If a lady has never been accustomed while single to  think of family management, let her not on that account fear that she  cannot attain it. She may consult others who are experienced, and  acquaint herself with the necessary quantities of the several articles  of family expenditure, in proportion to the number it consists of,  together with the value of the articles it may be necessary to procure.  A minute account of the annual income, and the times of payment, should  be taken in writing; likewise an estimate of the supposed amount of each  item of expense. Those who are early accustomed to calculations of this  kind, will acquire so accurate a knowledge of what their establishment  demands, as will suggest the happy medium between prodigality and  parsimony, without in the least subjecting themselves to the charge of  meanness.    Few branches of female education are so useful as great readiness at  figures, though nothing is more commonly neglected. Accounts should be  regularly kept, and not the smallest item be omitted to be entered. If  balanced every week, or month at longest, the income and outgoings will  easily be ascertained, and their proportions to each other be duly  observed. Some people fix on stated sums to be appropriated to each  different article, and keep the money separate for that purpose; as  house, clothes, pocket, education of children, &c. Whichever way  accounts be entered, a certain mode should be adopted, and strictly  adhered to. Many women are unfortunately ignorant of the state of their  husband's income; and others are only made acquainted with it when some  speculative project, or profitable transaction, leads them to make a  false estimate of what can be afforded. It too often happens also that  both parties, far from consulting each other, squander money in ways  that they would even wish to forget: whereas marriage should be a state  of mutual and perfect confidence, with a similarity of pursuits, which  would secure that happiness it was intended to bestow.    There are so many valuable women who excel as wives, that it is fair to  infer there would be few extravagant ones, if they were consulted by  their husbands on subjects that concern the mutual interest of both  parties. Many families have been reduced to poverty by the want of  openness in the man, on the subject of his affairs; and though on these  occasions the women are generally blamed, it has afterwards appeared  that they never were allowed to make particular enquiries, nor suffered  to reason upon what sometimes appeared to them imprudent. Many families  have fully as much been indebted to the propriety of female management,  for the degree of prosperity they have enjoyed, as to the knowledge and  activity of the husband and the father.    Ready money should be paid for all such things as come not into weekly  bills, and even for them some sort of check is necessary. The best  places for purchasing goods should also be attended to. On some articles  a discount of five per cent is allowed in London and other large cities,  and those who thus pay are usually best served. Under an idea of buying  cheap, many go to new shops; but it is safest to deal with people of  established credit, who do not dispose of goods by underselling. To make  tradesmen wait for their money is very injurious, besides that a higher  price must be paid: and in long bills, articles never bought are often  charged. If goods are purchased at ready-money price, and regularly  entered, the exact state of the expenditure will be known with ease; for  it is delay of payment that occasions so much confusion. A common-place  book should always be at hand, in which to enter such hints of useful  knowledge, and other observations, as are given by sensible experienced  people. Want of attention to what is advised, or supposing things to be  too minute to be worth regarding, are the causes why so much ignorance  prevails on necessary subjects, among those who are not backward in  frivolous ones.    It is very necessary for the mistress of a family to be informed of the  price and quality of all articles in common use, and of the best times  and places for purchasing them. She should also be acquainted with the  comparative prices of provisions, in order that she may be able to  substitute those that are most reasonable, when they will answer as  well, for others of the same kind, but which are more costly. A false  notion of economy leads many to purchase as bargains, what is not  wanted, and sometimes never is used. Were this error avoided, more money  would remain of course for other purposes. It is not unusual among lower  dealers to put off a larger quantity of goods, by assurances that they  are advancing in price; and many who supply fancy articles are so  successful in persuasion, that purchasers not unfrequently go beyond  their original intention, and suffer inconvenience by it. Some things  are certainly better for keeping, and should be laid in accordingly; but  this applies only to articles in constant consumption. Unvarying rules  cannot be given, for people ought to form their conduct on their  circumstances. Some ladies charge their account with giving out to a  superintending servant such quantities of household articles, as by  observation and calculation they know to be sufficient, reserving for  their own key the large stock of things usually laid in for extensive  families in the country. Should there be more visitors than usual, they  can easily account for an increased consumption, and vice versa. Such a  degree of judgment will be respectable even in the eye of domestics, if  not interested in the ignorance of their employers; and if they are,  their services will not compensate the want of honesty.    A bill of parcels and receipt should be required, even if the money be  paid at the time of purchase; and to avoid mistakes, let the goods be  compared with these when brought home. Though it is very disagreeable to  suspect any one's honesty, and perhaps mistakes are often unintentional;  yet it is proper to weigh meat and grocery articles when brought in, and  compare them with the charge. The butcher should be ordered to send the  weight with the meat, and the checks regularly filed and examined. A  ticket should be exchanged for every loaf of bread, which when returned  will shew the number to be paid for, as tallies may be altered, unless  one is kept by each party. Those who are served with brewer's beer, or  any other articles not paid for weekly or on delivery, should keep a  book for entering the dates: which will not only serve to prevent  overcharges, but will show the whole year's consumption at one view.  `Poole's complete Housekeeper's Account book,' is very well adapted to  this purpose.    An inventory of furniture, linen, and china, should be kept, and the  things examined by it twice a year, or oftener if there be a change of  servants; into each of whose care the articles are to be entrusted, with  a list, the same as is done with plate. Tickets of parchment with the  family name, numbered, and specifying what bed it belongs to, should be  sewed on each feather bed, bolster, pillow, and blanket. Knives, forks,  and house cloths are often deficient: these accidents might be obviated,  if an article at the head of every list required the former to be  produced whole or broken, and the marked part of the linen, though all  the others should be worn out. Glass is another article that requires  care, though a tolerable price is given for broken flint-glass. Trifle  dishes, butter stands, &c. may be had at a lower price than cut glass,  made in moulds, of which there is a great variety that look extremely  well, if not placed near the more beautiful articles.      _Choice and Treatment of Servants._    The regularity and good management of a family will very much depend on  the character of the servants who are employed in it, and frequently one  of base and dishonest principles will corrupt and ruin all the rest. No  orders, however wise or prudent, will be duly carried into effect,  unless those who are to execute them are to be depended on. It behoves  every mistress therefore to be extremely careful whom she takes into her  service; to be very minute in investigating character, and equally  cautious and scrupulously just in giving recommendations of others. Were  this attended to, many bad people would be incapacitated for doing  mischief, by abusing the trust reposed in them. It may fairly be  asserted that the robbery, or waste, which is only a milder term for the  unfaithfulness of a servant, will be laid to the charge of that master  or mistress, who knowing or having well-founded suspicions of such  faults, is prevailed upon by false pity, or entreaty, to slide such  servant into another place. There are however some who are unfortunately  capricious, and often refuse to give a character because they are  displeased with the servant leaving; but this is an unpardonable  violation of the right of a servant, who having no inheritance, is  dependant on her fair name for employment. To refuse countenance to the  evil, and to encourage the good servant, are equally due to society at  large; and such as are honest, frugal, and attentive to their duties,  should be liberally rewarded, which would encourage merit, and stimulate  servants to acquit themselves with propriety. The contrary conduct is  often visited with a kind of retributive justice in the course of a few  years. The extravagant and idle in servitude are ill prepared for the  industry and sobriety on which their own future welfare so essentially  depends. Their faults, and the attendant punishment come home, when they  have children of their own; and sometimes much sooner.

No pains have been spared to get as representative specimens as it was  possible to find. A careful study of the illustrations of the plants  will, in most cases, very greatly assist the student in determining the  classification of the plant when found; but the illustration should not  be wholly relied upon, especially in the study of Boleti. The  description should be carefully studied to see if it tallies with the  characteristics of the plant in hand.    In many plants where notes had not been taken or had been lost, the  descriptions given by the parties naming the plants were used. This is  notably so of many of the Boleti. The author felt that Dr. Peck's  descriptions would be more accurate and complete, hence they were used,  giving him credit.    Care has been taken to give the translation of names and to show why the  plant was so called. It is always a wonder to the uninitiated how the  Latin name is remembered, but when students see that the name includes  some prominent characteristic of the plant and thus discover its  applicability, its recollection becomes comparatively easy.    The habitat and time of growth of each plant is given, also its  edibility. The author was urged by his many friends throughout the  state, while in institute work and frequently talking upon this subject,  to give them a book that would assist them in becoming familiar with the  common mushrooms of their vicinity. The request has been complied with.    It is hoped that the work will be as helpful as it has been pleasant to  perform.      M. E. H.    Chillicothe, Ohio, January 11, 1908.

It was my practice to go out every day after flowers, especially  the rarer ones, of which there were many in this county, and bring in  specimens for the classes. There was in the city a wire nail mill,  running day and night, whose proprietors brought over, from time to  time, large numbers of Bohemians as workers in the mill. Very  frequently, when driving to the country early in the morning, I found  the boys and girls of these Bohemian families searching the woods,  fields and pastures at some distance from town, although they had not  been in this country more than a week or two and could not speak a word  of English. I soon found that they were gathering mushrooms of various  kinds and taking them home for food material. They could not tell me how  they knew them, but I quickly learned that they knew them from their  general characteristics,--in fact, they knew them as we know people and  flowers.    I resolved to know something of the subject myself. I had no literature  on mycology, and, at that time, there seemed to be little obtainable.  About that time there appeared in Harper's Monthly an article by W.  Hamilton Gibson upon Edible Toadstools and Mushrooms--an article which I  thoroughly devoured, soon after purchasing his book upon the subject.    Salem, Ohio, was a very fertile locality for mushrooms and it was not  long till I was surprised at the number that I really knew. I remembered  that where there is a will there is a way.    In 1897 I moved to Bowling Green, Ohio; there I found many species which  I had found about Salem, Ohio, but the extremely rich soil, heavy timber  and numerous old lake beaches seemed to furnish a larger variety, so  that I added many more to my list. After remaining three years in  Bowling Green, making delightful acquaintance with the good people of  that city as well as with the flowers and mushrooms of Wood county,  Providence placed me in Sidney, Ohio, where I found many new species of  fungi and renewed my acquaintance with many of those formerly met.    Since coming to Chillicothe I have tried to have the plants photographed  as I have found them, but having to depend upon a photographer I could  not always do this. I have not found in this vicinity many that I have  found elsewhere in the state, although I have found many new things  here, a fact which I attribute to the hilly nature of the county. For  prints of many varieties of fungi obtained before coming here, I am  indebted to my friends. I should advise any one intending to make a  study of this subject to have all specimens photographed as soon as they  are identified, thus fixing the species for future reference.    It seems to me that every school teacher should know something of  mycology. Some of my teachers have during the past year made quite a  study of this interesting subject, and I have found that their pupils  kept them busy in identifying their finds. Their lists of genera and  species, as exhibited on the blackboards at the close of the season were  quite long. I found from my Bohemian boys and girls that their teachers  in their native country had opened for them the door to this very useful  knowledge. Observation has proven to me conclusively that there is a  large and increasing interest in this subject throughout the greater  part of Ohio.    Every professional man needs a hobby which he may mount in his hours of  relaxation, and I am quite sure there is no field that offers better  inducement for a canter than the subject of botany, and especially this  particular department of botanical work.    I have a friend, a professional man who has an eye and a heart for all  the beauties of nature. After hours of confinement in his office at  close and critical work he is always anxious for a ramble over the  hillsides and through the woods, and when we find anything new he seems  to enjoy it beyond measure.    Many ministers of the gospel have become famous in the mycological  world. The names of Rev. Lewis Schweiwitz, of Bethlehem, Pa.; Rev. M. J.  Berkeley and Rev. John Stevenson, of England, will live as long as  botany is known to mankind. Their influence for good and helpfulness to  their fellowmen will be everlasting.    With such an inspiration, how quickly one is lost to all business cares,  and how free and life-giving are the fields, the meadows and the woods,  so that one must exclaim with Prof. Henry Willey in his \"Introduction to  the Study of the Lichen\":        \"If I could put my woods in song,        And tell what's there enjoyed,      All men would to my garden throng,        And leave the cities void.      In my lot no tulips blow;        Snow-loving pines and oaks instead;      And rank the savage maples grow,        From Spring's first flush to Autumn red;      My garden is a forest ledge,        Which older forests bound.\"      MUSHROOMS AND TOADSTOOLS    =HOW TO TELL MUSHROOMS FROM TOADSTOOLS.= In all probability no student  of mycology has any one query more frequently or persistently pressed  upon his attention than the question, \"How do you tell a toadstool from  a mushroom?\"--or if in the woods or fields, in search for new species,  with an uninitiated comrade, he has frequently to decide whether a  certain specimen \"is a mushroom or a toadstool,\" so firmly fixed is the  idea that one class of fungi--the toadstools--are poisonous, and the  other--the mushrooms--are edible and altogether desirable; and these  inquiring minds frequently seem really disappointed at being told that  they are one and the same thing; that there are edible toadstools and  mushrooms, and poisonous mushrooms and toadstools; that in short a  toadstool is really a mushroom and a mushroom is only a toadstool after  all.    Hence the questions with the beginner is, how he may tell a poisonous  fungus from an edible one. There is but one answer to this question, and  that is that he must thoroughly learn both genera and species, studying  each till he knows its special features as he does those of his "]]]
