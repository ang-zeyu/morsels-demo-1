Neither shalt thou commit adultery. Neither  shalt thou steal. Neither shalt thou bear false-witness against thy  neighbor. Neither shalt thou desire thy neighbor's wife. Neither shalt  thou covet thy neighbor's house, his field, or his man-servant, or  maid-servant, his ox, or his ass, or anything that is thy neighbor's.  These words the Lord spake unto all your assembly, in the mount out of the  midst of the fire, of the cloud and of the thick darkness, with a great  voice; and he added no more, and he wrote them upon two tables of stone,  and delivered them unto you.\"    Thus we have a _fac simile_ of the law upon the tables of stone. The terms  employed in this law limit it to the Jewish people, a people who were  servants in Egypt. This was the \"testament,\" \"institution,\" or \"covenant\"  given at Sinai, and it was after the _tenor_ of all the rest that was  given. It is worthy of notice, that there is not a penalty in all that was  written upon those tables. And yet there were terrible penalties inflicted  for a violation of its precepts. How is this? Was it all there was of  God's law? If so, where shall we go to find its penalties? This covenant  is spoken of in Galatians, the fourth chapter. It is called \"the bond  woman,\" that was cast out. In the third chapter of Corinthians it is  termed \"the ministration of condemnation,\" and \"the ministration of death  written and engraven in stones, which was done away.\" Which Zechariah said  was broken by the Lord in the day of the terrible tragedy of the cross of  Christ.    The multiplicity of passages in the New Testament bearing upon this great  fact, causes our legalists in religion to shift about most wonderfully. At  one time, the people's agreement to keep the law was the covenant that was  done away. At another, it was the act of executing the penalty of death  that was set aside. At another, it was the glory of Moses' face that was  done away. And at another, it was none of all these, but it was the  ceremonial law of Moses that was done away.    All these positions were taken by one man, in one discussion with the  writer of these lines. All such turns are cheap; it requires no great  wisdom to accommodate yourself in this manner to the force of  circumstances. The fact that the \"first covenant\" was a \"testament,\" or a  body of laws with certain promises annexed, as well as penalties, is  evident from Paul's statement in the ninth chapter of his letter to the  Hebrews. He says, \"Then verily the first covenant had also ordinances of  divine service, and a worldly sanctuary, for there was a tabernacle made;  the first wherein was the candlestick, and the table, and the show-bread;  which is called the sanctuary.\" The distinction which our friends make  between \"Moses' law\" and \"God's law,\" as they are pleased to express it,  is not only unscriptural, the two phrases being inter-changeable, but also  _absurd_. Moses gave all, that these men are pleased to term his law, in  the name of the Lord. The law of the passover, found in the twelfth  chapter of Exodus, is prefaced with these words: \"And the Lord God said  unto Moses.\" In the twenty-fifth chapter of the same book we have the laws  concerning the ark, the tabernacle, the priestly service, and all are  introduced with this saying: \"And the Lord spake unto Moses.\" Moses never  gave a law in his own name. Neither did he give one of his own in the name  of the Lord, because it would have cost him his life. The Lord had guarded  this point in the following: \"But the prophet which presumes to speak a  word in my name, which I have not commanded him to speak, or that shall  speak in the name of other gods, even that prophet shall die.\" Now one of  two things is evident: first, all the laws that Moses gave in the name of  the Lord were His; or, secondly, Moses violated the law governing the  prophet. And if the record is false on this account, how can we trust it  in other respects? It is as easy to turn God out of all the pentateuch,  and put Moses into it, as to maintain the proposition that Moses had a law  of his own. Sabbatarians act the part of the unbeliever in getting the  Lord out of the law that was done away, and Moses into it. All that is  accredited to the Lord was His, otherwise the record is untrustworthy. If  our friend's position is true, it follows that Moses is the sole author of  the sacrificial system of blood, without which there was no remission, and  thus the ancient remedial scheme falls, being without divine sanction. But  the Lord claims all that our friends hand over to Moses. The following  phrases are uttered with reference to the priests and other things: \"My  priest,\" \"My sacrifice,\" \"Mine altar,\" \"Mine offering,\" 1st Samuel, ii,  27-29; \"The Lord's pass-over,\" Exodus, xii, 11; \"The feasts of the Lord,\"  Lev. xxiii; \"My sanctuary and my Sabbaths,\" Ezekiel, xxiii, 38. The manner  in which Sabbatarians emphasize the phrase \"My Sabbath,\" and \"My holy  day,\" is well calculated to mislead the unsuspecting, but those who are  schooled in biblical literature will regard it as mere _rant_, _cheap  theology_, _mere display_! All that Moses gave, as law, was from the Lord,  _was His_. \"The Lord came down upon Sinai, and spake to them from heaven,  and gave them right judgments, and true laws, good statutes and  commandments, and made known to them His holy Sabbath, and commanded  precepts, statutes and laws, by the hand of His servant Moses.\" Nehemiah,  ix, 13, 14.    The seventh-day Sabbath was not given to the Gentile world. It would  require just as plain and positive legislation to bind it upon us as it  did to establish it in Israel. It was a sign between God and the Hebrews.  Ezek. xxxi, 13-18. \"Moreover, also, I gave them my Sabbaths, to be a sign  between me and them, that they might know that I am Jehovah that doth  sanctify them.\" If there are any Gentile Christians upon the earth who  think it is essential to know that it was the Lord that sanctified the  children of Israel, set them apart from the surrounding nations, I would  say to such, It is sufficient to your salvation that you know the Lord, as  manifested in the flesh in the person of Christ Jesus, and that you love  and obey him. I can not see that the seventh-day Sabbath, as a sign upon a  Gentile, would tell the truth, for the Lord never sanctified the Gentiles  in the sense of setting them apart from the surrounding nations. Again, if  our friends could succeed in making it universal, it would _cease to be a  sign_. It was a national badge, or sign, between God and the Hebrews. Its  object was to keep in their memory that which was true of them _alone_.  \"Remember that thou wast a servant in the land of Egypt, and that the Lord  thy God brought thee out thence with a mighty hand and a stretched out  arm, therefore the Lord thy God hath commanded thee to keep the Sabbath  day.\" Deut. v. Can any Gentile obey this instruction? It is impossible!  Moses said, \"Behold I have taught you statutes and judgments, even as the  Lord my God commanded me, that ye should do so in the land whither ye go  to possess it. Keep, therefore, and do them, for this is your wisdom and  your understanding, in the sight of the nations which shall hear all these  statutes and say, Surely this great nation is a wise and understanding  people. For what nation is there so great, that hath statutes and  judgments so righteous as all this law which I set before you this day.\"  Deut. iv, 5. The authority and glory of Christ forbid all such Judaizing  as that which we speak against. \"He was given of God to be head over all  things to the church.\" \"And He is head of all principality and power.\" The  Father put all things under Him. The prophet Isaiah said, \"He shall not  fail, nor be discouraged till He hath set judgment in the earth, and the  isles shall wait for His law.\" Ch. xlii, 4. And Paul said, \"Bear ye one  another's burdens, and so fulfill the law of Christ.\" Gal. vi, 2.    The object of law is to regulate the exemplification of principles. Some  principle is exemplified in every act that man performs. And one principle  may be in a great variety of acts. The principle of hatred is exemplified  in a great many different actions; and the principle of love to God is  manifested, or exemplified, in every act of obedience to God. So the  spiritual may be brought out under different dispensations, and by  different laws, while it remains always the same. Indeed, principles are  unchangeable; they belong to the nature of things. Covenants, priesthoods,  dispensations and laws have changed, but principles, _never_. So the moral  objective of every law is the same, viz., to bring out and develop the  spiritual in man. To accomplish this great end it is necessary that the  evil principles of a carnal, or fleshly nature, should be restrained by  the penal sanctions of law, and the principles of man's higher nature  brought out by its motives of good. Such being the nature of principles,  and the facts of law, Paul says, \"We know that the law is spiritual.\" And  again, \"The law is fulfilled in us who walk not after the flesh, but after  the Spirit.\" \"Do we then make void law through faith? God forbid; yea, we  establish law.\"    I have left the article out of this text because it is not in the  original. B. Wilson translates the verse in these words: \"Do we then  nullify law through the FAITH. By no means; but we establish law.\" The  negative use of law is to restrain the evil; and the affirmative is to  bring out the good, the spiritual. So, without any interference with _the  spiritual_ of any law that ever was, either divine or human, we have a  better covenant, or testament, than the old testament; one that is  established upon better promises, which contains \"A new and living way  into the Holiest,\" which Paul says, \"Is heaven itself.\" This new way was  consecrated through the flesh of"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/2832"],[0,"Myth, Ritual and Religion, Vol. 1 (of 2) (#2)"],[1,"a book  on their beliefs and institutions, and Mr. N. W. Thomas is engaged on  a volume on Australian institutions. In this place the author can only  direct attention to these novel sources, and to the promised third  edition of Mr. Frazer's The Golden Bough.    A. L.          PREFACE TO NEW EDITION.      The original edition of Myth, Ritual and Religion, published in 1887,  has long been out of print. In revising the book I have brought it  into line with the ideas expressed in the second part of my Making of  Religion (1898) and have excised certain passages which, as the book  first appeared, were inconsistent with its main thesis. In some cases  the original passages are retained in notes, to show the nature of the  development of the author's opinions. A fragment or two of controversy  has been deleted, and chapters xi. and xii., on the religion of the  lowest races, have been entirely rewritten, on the strength of more  recent or earlier information lately acquired. The gist of the book as  it stands now and as it originally stood is contained in the following  lines from the preface of 1887: \"While the attempt is made to show that  the wilder features of myth survive from, or were borrowed from, or were  imitated from the ideas of people in the savage condition of  thought, the existence--even among savages--of comparatively pure, if  inarticulate, religious beliefs is insisted on throughout\". To that  opinion I adhere, and I trust that it is now expressed with more  consistency than in the first edition. I have seen reason, more  and more, to doubt the validity of the \"ghost theory,\" or animistic  hypothesis, as explanatory of the whole fabric of religion; and I  present arguments against Mr. Tylor's contention that the higher  conceptions of savage faith are borrowed from missionaries.(1) It is  very possible, however, that Mr. Tylor has arguments more powerful than  those contained in his paper of 1892. For our information is not yet  adequate to a scientific theory of the Origin of Religion, and probably  never will be. Behind the races whom we must regard as \"nearest the  beginning\" are their unknown ancestors from a dateless past, men as  human as ourselves, but men concerning whose psychical, mental and moral  condition we can only form conjectures. Among them religion arose, in  circumstances of which we are necessarily ignorant. Thus I only venture  on a surmise as to the germ of a faith in a Maker (if I am not to say  \"Creator\") and Judge of men. But, as to whether the higher religious  belief, or the lower mythical stories came first, we are at least  certain that the Christian conception of God, given pure, was presently  entangled, by the popular fancy of Europe, in new Marchen about the  Deity, the Madonna, her Son, and the Apostles. Here, beyond possibility  of denial, pure belief came first, fanciful legend was attached after.  I am inclined to surmise that this has always been the case, and, in the  pages on the legend of Zeus, I show the processes of degeneration, of  mythical accretions on a faith in a Heaven-God, in action. That \"the  feeling of religious devotion\" attests \"high faculties\" in early man  (such as are often denied to men who \"cannot count up to seven\"), and  that \"the same high mental faculties... would infallibly lead him,  as long as his reasoning powers remained poorly developed, to various  strange superstitions and customs,\" was the belief of Mr. Darwin.(2)  That is also my view, and I note that the lowest savages are not yet  guilty of the very worst practices, \"sacrifice of human beings to a  blood-loving God,\" and ordeals by poison and fire, to which Mr. Darwin  alludes. \"The improvement of our science\" has freed us from misdeeds  which are unknown to the Andamanese or the Australians. Thus there was,  as regards these points in morals, degeneracy from savagery as society  advanced, and I believe that there was also degeneration in religion.  To say this is not to hint at a theory of supernatural revelation to the  earliest men, a theory which I must, in limine disclaim.      (1) Tylor, \"Limits of Savage Religion.\" Journal of the Anthropological  Institute, vol. xxi.    (2) Descent of Man, p. 68, 1871.      In vol. ii. p. 19 occurs a reference, in a note, to Mr. Hartland's  criticism of my ideas about Australian gods as set forth in the Making  of Religion. Mr. Hartland, who kindly read the chapters on Australian  religion in this book, does not consider that my note on p. 19 meets the  point of his argument. As to the Australians, I mean no more than that,  AMONG endless low myths, some of them possess a belief in a \"maker  of everything,\" a primal being, still in existence, watching conduct,  punishing breaches of his laws, and, in some cases, rewarding the  good in a future life. Of course these are the germs of a sympathetic  religion, even if the being thus regarded is mixed up with immoral or  humorous contradictory myths. My position is not harmed by such myths,  which occur in all old religions, and, in the middle ages, new myths  were attached to the sacred figures of Christianity in poetry and  popular tales.    Thus, if there is nothing \"sacred\" in a religion because wild or wicked  fables about the gods also occur, there is nothing \"sacred\" in almost  any religion on earth.    Mr. Hartland's point, however, seems to be that, in the Making of  Religion, I had selected certain Australian beliefs as especially  \"sacred\" and to be distinguished from others, because they are  inculcated at the religious Mysteries of some tribes. His aim, then, is  to discover low, wild, immoral myths, inculcated at the Mysteries, and  thus to destroy my line drawn between religion on one hand and myth or  mere folk-lore on the other. Thus there is a being named Daramulun, of  whose rites, among the Coast Murring, I condensed the account of Mr.  Howitt.(1) From a statement by Mr. Greenway(2) Mr. Hartland learned  that Daramulun's name is said to mean \"leg on one side\" or \"lame\". He,  therefore, with fine humour, speaks of Daramulun as \"a creator with a  game leg,\" though when \"Baiame\" is derived by two excellent linguists,  Mr. Ridley and Mr. Greenway, from Kamilaroi baia, \"to make,\" Mr.  Hartland is by no means so sure of the sense of the name. It happens to  be inconvenient to him! Let the names mean what they may, Mr. Hartland  finds, in an obiter dictum of Mr. Howitt (before he was initiated), that  Daramulun is said to have \"died,\" and that his spirit is now aloft.  Who says so, and where, we are not informed,(3) and the question is  important.      (1) J. A. I., xiii. pp. 440-459.    (2) Ibid., xxi. p. 294.    (3) Ibid., xiii. p. 194.      For the Wiraijuri, IN THEIR MYSTERIES, tell a myth of cannibal conduct  of Daramulun's, and of deceit and failure of knowledge in Baiame.(1)  Of this I was unaware, or neglected it, for I explicitly said that I  followed Mr. Howitt's account, where no such matter is mentioned. Mr.  Howitt, in fact, described the Mysteries of the Coast Murring, while  the narrator of the low myths, Mr. Matthews, described those of a  remote tribe, the Wiraijuri, with whom Daramulun is not the chief, but  a subordinate person. How Mr. Matthews' friends can at once hold that  Daramulun was \"destroyed\" by Baiame (their chief deity), and also that  Daramulun's voice is heard at their rites, I don't know.(2) Nor do I  know why Mr. Hartland takes the myth of a tribe where Daramulun is \"the  evil spirit who rules the night,\"(3) and introduces it as an argument  against the belief of a distant tribe, where, by Mr. Howitt's account,  Daramulun is not an evil spirit, but \"the master\" of all, whose abode  is above the sky, and to whom are attributed powers of omnipotence  and omnipresence, or, at any rate, the power \"to do anything and to  go anywhere.... To his direct ordinances are attributed the social and  moral laws of the community.\"(4) This is not \"an evil spirit\"! When Mr.  Hartland goes for scandals to a remote tribe of a different creed  that he may discredit the creed of the Coast Murring, he might as well  attribute to the Free Kirk \"the errors of Rome\". But Mr. Hartland does  it!(5) Being \"cunning of fence\" he may reply that I also spoke loosely  of Wiraijuri and Coast Murring as, indifferently, Daramulunites. I did,  and I was wrong, and my critic ought not to accept but to expose my  error. The Wiraijuri Daramulun, who was annihilated, yet who is \"an evil  spirit that rules the night,\" is not the Murring guardian and founder of  recognised ethics.      (1) J. A. I., xxv. p. 297.    (2) Ibid., May, 1895, p. 419.    (3) Ibid.    (4) Ibid., xiii. pp. 458, 459.    (5) Folk-Lore, ix., No. iv., p. 299.      But, in the Wiraijuri mysteries, the master, Baiame, deceives the women  as to the Mysteries! Shocking to US, but to deceive the women as to  these arcana, is, to the Australian mind in general, necessary for the  safety of the world. Moreover, we have heard of a lying spirit sent  to deceive prophets in a much higher creed. Finally, in a myth of  the Mystery of the Wiraijuri, Baiame is not omniscient. Indeed, even  civilised races cannot keep on the level of these religious conceptions,  and not to keep on that level is--mythology. Apollo, in the hymn to  Hermes, sung on a sacred occasion, needs to ask an old vine-dresser  for intelligence. Hyperion \"sees all and hears all,\" but needs to be  informed, by his daughters, of the slaughter of his kine. The Lord, in  the Book of Job, has to ask Satan, \"Whence comest thou?\" Now for the  sake of dramatic effect, now from pure inability to live on the level of  his highest thought, man mythologises and anthropomorphises, in Greece  or Israel, as in Australia.    It does not follow that there is \"nothing sacred\" in his religion. Mr.  Hartland offers me a case in point. In Mrs. Langloh Parker's Australian  Legendary Tales (pp. 11, 94), are myths of low adventures of Baiame. In  her More"]]]
