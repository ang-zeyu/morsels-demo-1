Bread for sandwiches must be baked in rather large  square pans, and must be just a little lighter and softer than bread for  the table. The following recipes will, I am sure, help the \"out of town\"  housewife. Nut bread is usually made into simple bread and butter  sandwiches; the nuts in the bread are quite sufficient filling.      Yeast      4 good sized potatoes    1 quart of boiling water    2 tablespoonfuls of sugar    1 tablespoonful of salt    Pare and grate the potatoes into the hot water, stir over the fire  until it reaches boiling point, and simmer gently for five minutes. Take  from the fire, add the sugar and salt, and when lukewarm add a cupful of  yeast, or two dry yeast cakes that have been moistened in a little  water, or one cake of compressed yeast. Turn the mixture into a jar and  cover with a saucer. Stir it down as fast as it comes to the top of the  jar. When it falls, or ceases to be very light, which will be five or  six hours, pour it into a bottle, put the cork in very loosely and stand  it in a cold place. Use one cupful of this to each two loaves of bread.      German Potato Bread    Boil one potato until tender; mash it through a sieve, add to it a half  pint of warm water and a teaspoonful of sugar. Stir in one cupful of  flour and one cupful of yeast; let this stand for two hours, or until  very light. It is better to make this at seven o'clock, so the bread may  be sponged at nine or ten. Scald a pint of milk, add to it a pint of  water, beat in a quart and a pint of flour. The batter should be thick  enough to drop, rather than pour from the spoon. Then stir in the potato  starter, and stand in a place about 65° Fahr. over night. Next morning  knead thoroughly, adding flour. Put this aside until very light, about  two hours, then mold into loaves, put it into square greased pans, and  when light bake in a moderately quick oven three-quarters of an hour.    This recipe will make two box loaves and a dozen rolls.      Nineteenth Century Bread    Scald a pint of milk, add a pint of water, a teaspoonful of salt, and  when lukewarm, one compressed yeast cake moistened in a little warm  water. Add sufficient whole wheat flour to make a batter, beat  thoroughly, cover and stand aside two and a half hours; then stir,  adding more whole wheat flour until you have a dough. Knead quickly,  separate into loaves, put each in a square greased pan, cover and stand  in a warm place about one hour, until very light. Slash the top with a  sharp knife, brush with water and bake in a moderate oven three-quarters  of an hour.      White Bread    Add a pint of water to a pint of scalded milk; when lukewarm add one  compressed yeast cake, moistened, and a teaspoonful of salt. Add  sufficient flour gradually, beating all the while, to make a dough.  Knead this dough until it is soft and elastic, and free from stickiness.  Put it into a greased bowl, stand it in a warm place three hours.  Separate it into loaves, knead five minutes, put the loaves in square  greased pans and stand aside until very light. Slash the top with a  sharp knife, brush with water, and bake in a moderate oven  three-quarters of an hour. This should make two loaves, or a dozen bread  sticks and a dozen rolls.      Nut Bread       1 quart of flour     4 level teaspoonfuls of baking powder     1 teaspoonful of salt     1 cupful of chopped nuts    1½ cupfuls of milk    Add the baking powder and salt to the flour and sift them. Add the nuts,  mix thoroughly and gradually add the milk. Knead this into a loaf, put  it into a square pan, brush the top with melted butter, let it stand  twenty minutes, and bake in a moderate oven three-quarters of an hour.      Anchovy Sandwiches    Beat a quarter of a pound of butter to a cream, adding gradually two  tablespoonfuls of lemon juice, a saltspoonful of paprika, two  tablespoonfuls of anchovy paste. Spread this on thin slices of bread,  put two together, trim off the crusts, and cut into triangles.      Anchovy and Egg Sandwiches    Mash the yolks of four hard-boiled eggs with two tablespoonfuls of  melted butter or olive oil, add a half teaspoonful of salt, a dash of  paprika and a tablespoonful of anchovy paste or two mashed anchovies.  Spread this between thin slices of buttered bread, press the slices  together, trim off the crusts and cut into triangles.    Sardines may be used in the place of anchovies.      Cold Beef Sandwiches    Take the remains of cold roasted beef, and chop very fine; put it into  a bowl; to each half pint of meat, add a half teaspoonful of salt, a  tablespoonful of tomato catsup, a teaspoonful of Worcestershire sauce  and a teaspoonful of melted butter; work this together. Cut the crust  from the ends of a loaf of whole wheat bread; butter lightly and slice;  so continue until you have the desired number of slices; spread the  slices with a layer of the seasoned meat; put two slices together, and  cut into desired shapes.      Caviar Sandwiches No. 1    Beat a quarter of a pound of butter to a cream; add two tablespoonfuls  of onion juice, the same of lemon, a saltspoonful of paprika, and  gradually four tablespoonfuls of caviar. Spread this on thin slices of  brown bread or pumpernickel, put two together, press lightly and cut  into long, narrow shapes.      Caviar Sandwiches No. 2    Cut slices of bread in crescent-shaped pieces, butter one side and  toast. Have ready two hard-boiled eggs, remove yolks, put them through  sieve, chop whites very fine, and spread toast with layer of caviar;  then sprinkle over first a little of whites, then a little of the yolks  of the eggs. Put over in the form of a ring a piece of onion, the onion  having first been cut into thin slices, and then separated.      Celery Sandwiches    Cut slices of bread, butter one side and toast. Cut the white part of  celery into thin slices, cover it over the bread, then cover this with a  layer of mayonnaise dressing, cover with another piece of toast, cut  into squares and serve. All sandwiches of this kind must be used as soon  as made.      Celery Salad Sandwiches    Put four eggs into warm water; bring to the boiling point, and keep  there, without boiling, for fifteen minutes. Take the white portion from  one head of celery; wash and chop it very fine. Remove the shells from  the hard-boiled eggs, and either chop them very fine or put through a  vegetable press, and mix with them the celery; add a half teaspoonful of  salt and a dash of pepper. Butter the bread before you cut it from the  loaf. After you have a sufficient quantity cut, put over each slice a  layer of the mixed egg and celery; put right in the center of this a  teaspoonful of mayonnaise dressing, and sort of smooth it all over. Put  two pieces together and press them lightly. Trim off the crusts, and cut  the sandwiches into pieces about two inches wide and the length of the  slices.      Rolled Bread and Butter Sandwiches    Beat the butter to a cream. Remove the crusts from the loaf, butter each  slice before you cut it off, and roll at once. These may be tied with  narrow baby ribbon or wrapped at once in waxed paper, fringing and  twisting the ends.      Rolled Chicken Sandwiches    Trim the crusts from the entire loaf, butter each slice and cut it off  as thin as possible; spread it quickly with the mixture, roll and wrap  it at once in waxed paper. If the bread is home-made and cracks in the  rolling, put a colander over a kettle of boiling water, throw in it a  few slices at a time, as soon as they have softened spread them with  soft butter, then cover with the mixture, roll and wrap in waxed paper.    To make the mixture, chop sufficient cold boiled chicken to make a  pint. Rub together two level tablespoonfuls of butter and two of flour,  add slowly a half cupful of hot milk, stir over the fire for a minute,  then add the chicken, a level teaspoonful of salt, a half teaspoonful of  celery seed, a saltspoonful of white pepper, a dash of red pepper, a  teaspoonful of onion juice and a grating of nutmeg; mix and cool. This  will make four dozen rolled sandwiches.      Sandwiches à la Rorer    Chop sufficient white meat of cooked chicken to make a half pint.  Select two fine bunches of cress, and with a sharp knife shave it very  fine. Wash and dry the crisp portion from a head of lettuce. Put the  yolks of two eggs into a saucepan, add the juice from two lemons and  stir over hot water until the mixture is thick; take from the fire and  add slowly two tablespoonfuls of olive oil; add this to the chicken and  season with a half teaspoonful of salt and a dash of pepper. Butter a  slice of white bread, put over a rather thick layer of the chicken  mixture, then a slice of brown bread, buttered on both sides; cover this  with a thick layer of cress, dust it lightly with salt and pepper, then  another slice of white bread, buttered; press these firmly together,  trim the crusts and cut into fingers.      Chicken and Almond Sandwiches    Chop sufficient cold cooked chicken to make a half pint. Chop a quarter  of a pound of blanched almonds, add them to the chicken, add four  tablespoonfuls of cream, a half teaspoonful of salt and a dash of  pepper; mix thoroughly, put between thin slices of buttered bread and  cut into crescents or rounds.      Chicken and Lettuce à la Kendall    Put sufficient cold boiled chicken through the meat chopper to make a  half pint, pound it in a mortar or rub it in a bowl with the hard-boiled  yolks of four eggs, four tablespoonfuls of thick cream, a half  teaspoonful of salt, a dash of pepper, and if you have it, two  saltspoonfuls of celery seed; in the winter you may add a half cupful of  finely chopped celery. Butter thin slices of white bread, cover them  with this mixture, place on top a slice of brown bread buttered on both  sides, then a thick layer of shredded celery, with a tablespoonful of"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/29349"],[0,"Creatures of the Night: A Book of Wild Life in Western Britain (#2)"],[1,"to food--A poacher's ruse              261-277      III.

I.    THE HOLT AMONG THE ALDERS.      I first saw Lutra, the otter-cub, while I was fishing late one summer  night. Slow-moving clouds, breaking into fantastic shapes and spreading  out great, threatening arms into the dark, ascended from the horizon and  sailed northward under the moon and stars. Ever and anon, low down in  the sky, Venus, like a clear-cut diamond suspended from one of its many  twinkling points, glittered between the fringes of the clouds, or the  white moon diffused soft light among the wreathing vapours that twisted  and rolled athwart the heavens. In the shelter of the pines on the  margin of the river, a ringdove, awakened by a bickering mate,  fluttered from bough to bough; and his angry, muffled coo of defiance  marred the stillness of the night. The gurgling call of a moorhen,  mingling with the ripple of the stream over the ford, came from the  reeds at a distant bend of the river. Nearer, the river, with varying  cadence, rose and fell in uneven current over a rocky shelf, and then  came on to murmur around me while I waded towards the edge of a deep,  forbidding pool. In the smooth back-wash beyond the black cup of the  pool a mass of gathered foam gleamed weirdly in the dark; and, further  away, broad tangles of river-weed, dotted with the pale petals of  countless flowers, floated on the shallow trout-reach extending from the  village gardens to the cornfields below the old, grey church.    In one of the terraced gardens behind me a cottager was burning garden  refuse; tongues of flame leaped up amid billows of smoke, and from the  crackling heap a myriad sparks shot out on every side. While the  cottager moved about by the fire, his shadow lengthened across the  river, which, reflecting the lurid glare, became strangely suggestive  of unfathomable depths. The moorhen called again from the reeds near the  ford, then flew away over the fire-flushed river and disappeared into  the gloom; and a water-vole dropped with a gentle plash into the pool.    Casting a white moth quietly over the stream, I noticed beyond the  shadows a round mass rising from the centre of the current, moving  against the flood, and sinking noiselessly out of sight. There could be  no doubt that the shape and motion were those of an otter. To continue  my sport would have been in vain with such a master-fisher in the pool,  so I reeled in my line, and stood still among the ripples as they  circled, muttering, around my knees. Presently the dim form of the otter  reappeared a little further up-stream, and I caught sight of a  glistening trout in the creature's mouth.    The otter swam, with head just above water, towards the alders skirting  the opposite bank, and then, turning sharply, was lost to sight near the  overhanging roots of a sycamore. Immediately afterwards, a strange,  flute-like whistle--as if some animal, having ascended from the depths  of the river, had blown water through its nostrils in a violent effort  to breathe--came from the whirlpool in the dense shadows of the pines:  the otter's mate was hunting in the quiet water beyond the shelf of  rock. Then a slight, rattling sound on the pebbly beach of a little bay  near the sycamore indicated that the animal had landed and was probably  devouring the captured fish. The leaping flames of the cottager's fire  had been succeeded by a fitful glow, but the moon glided from behind the  clouds and revealed a distinct picture of the parent otter standing on  the shingle, in company with Lutra, her little cub.           *       *       *       *       *    A deserted mansion--to whose history, like the aged ivy to its crumbling  walls, clung many a fateful legend--nestled under the precipitous woods  in the valley. Time, taking advantage of neglect, had made a wilderness  of the gardens, the lawns, and the orchards, which, less than a century  ago, surrounded with quiet beauty this home of a typical old country  squire. A few garden flowers still lingered near the porch; but the once  well tended borders were overgrown with grass, or occupied with wild  blossoms brought from the fields by the hundred agents employed by  Nature to scatter seed. Owls inhabited the outhouses, and bats the  chinks beneath the eaves. A fox had his \"earth\" in the shrubbery beyond  the moss-grown pathway leading from the door to the gate at the end of  the drive. A timid wood-pigeon often flew across from the pines and  walked about the steps before the long-closed door. Near the warped  window of the dismantled gun-room the end of a large water-pipe formed a  convenient burrow for some of the rabbits that played at dusk near the  margin of the shrubbery. This water-pipe led to the river's brink; and  there, having been broken by landslips resulting from the ingress of the  stream during flood, one of the severed parts of the tube formed,  beneath the surface of the water, an outlet to a natural chamber high  and dry in the bank. The upper portion of the pipe was choked with  earth and leaves washed down from the fields by the winter rains.    In this hollow \"oven,\" on a heap of hay, moss, and leaves, brought"]]]
