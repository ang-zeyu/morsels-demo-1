So wide is the divergence of opinions on the subject  that two learned critics, Ewald and Hitzig, differ in the date assigned  to a certain biblical passage by no less than a thousand years!    Bible archaeology, Bible exegesis, and discussions of grammatical  niceties, were confounded with the history of biblical literature, and  naturally it was the latter that suffered by the lack of  differentiation. Orthodoxy assumed a purely divine origin for the Bible,  while sceptics treated the holy book with greater levity than they would  dare display in criticising a modern novel. The one party raised a hue  and cry when Moses was spoken of as the first author; the other  discovered \"obscene, rude, even cannibalistic traits\"[2] in the sublime  narratives of the Bible. It should be the task of coming generations,  successors by one remove of credulous Bible lovers, and immediate heirs  of thorough-going rationalists, to reconcile and fuse in a higher  conception of the Bible the two divergent theories of its purely divine  and its purely human origin. Unfortunately, it must be admitted that  Ernest Meier is right, when he says, in his \"History of the National  Poetry of the Hebrews,\" that this task wholly belongs to the future; at  present it is an unsolved problem.    The aesthetic is the only proper point of view for a full recognition of  the value of biblical literature. It certainly does not rob the sacred  Scriptures, the perennial source of spiritual comfort, of their exalted  character and divine worth to assume that legend, myth, and history  have combined to produce the perfect harmony which is their imperishable  distinction. The peasant dwelling on inaccessible mountain-heights, next  to the record of Abraham's shepherd life, inscribes the main events of  his own career, the anniversary dates sacred to his family. The young  count among their first impressions that of \"the brown folio,\" and more  vividly than all else remember        \"The maidens fair and true,        The sages and the heroes bold,      Whose tale by seers inspired        In our Book of books is told.        The simple life and faith        Of patriarchs of ancient day      Like angels hover near,        And guard, and lead them on the way.\"[3]    Above all, a whole nation has for centuries been living with, and only  by virtue of, this book. Surely this is abundant testimony to the  undying value of the great work, in which the simplest shepherd tales  and the naivest legends, profound moral saws and magnificent images, the  ideals of a Messianic future and the purest, the most humane conception  of life, alternate with sublime descriptions of nature and the sweet  strains of love-poems, with national songs breathing hope, or trembling  with anguish, and with the dull tones of despairing pessimism and the  divinely inspired hymns of an exalted theodicy--all blending to form  what the reverential love of men has named the Book of books.    It was natural that a book of this kind should become the basis of a  great literature. Whatever was produced in later times had to submit to  be judged by its exalted standard. It became the rule of conduct, the  prophetic mirror reflecting the future work of a nation whose fate was  inextricably bound up with its own. It is not known how and when the  biblical scriptures were welded into one book, a holy canon, but it is  probably correct to assume that it was done by the _Soferim_, the  Scribes, between 200 and 150 B.C.E. At all events, it is certain that  the three divisions of the Bible--the Pentateuch, the Prophets, and the  miscellaneous writings--were contained in the Greek version, the  Septuagint, so called from the seventy or seventy-two Alexandrians  supposed to have done the work of translation under Ptolemy  Philadelphus.    The Greek translation of the Bible marks the beginning of the second  period of Jewish literature, the Judaeo-Hellenic. Hebrew ceased to be the  language of the people; it was thenceforth used only by scholars and in  divine worship. Jewish for the first time met Greek intellect. Shem and  Japheth embraced fraternally. \"But even while the teachings of Hellas  were pushing their way into subjugated Palestine, seducing Jewish  philosophy to apostasy, and seeking, by main force, to introduce  paganism, the Greek philosophers themselves stood awed by the majesty  and power of the Jewish prophets. Swords and words entered the lists as  champions of Judaism. The vernacular Aramaean, having suffered the Greek  to put its impress upon many of its substantives, refused to yield to  the influence of the Greek verb, and, in the end, Hebrew truth, in the  guise of the teachings of Jesus, undermined the proud structure of the  heathen.\" This is a most excellent characterization of that literary  period, which lasted about three centuries, ending between 100 and 150  C. E. Its influence upon Jewish literature can scarcely be said to have  been enduring. To it belong all the apocryphal writings which,  originally composed in the Greek language, were for that reason not  incorporated into the Holy Canon. The centre of intellectual life was no  longer in Palestine, but at Alexandria in Egypt, where three hundred  thousand Jews were then living, and thus this literature came to be  called Judaeo-Alexandrian. It includes among its writers the last of the  Neoplatonists, particularly Philo, the originator of the allegorical  interpretation of the Bible and of a Jewish philosophy of religion;  Aristeas, and pseudo-Phokylides. There were also Jewish _litterateurs_:  the dramatist Ezekielos; Jason; Philo the Elder; Aristobulus, the  popularizer of the Aristotelian philosophy; Eupolemos, the historian;  and probably the Jewish Sybil, who had to have recourse to the oracular  manner of the pagans to proclaim the truths of Judaism, and to Greek  figures of speech for her apocalyptic visions, which foretold, in  biblical phrase and with prophetic ardor, the future of Israel and of  the nations in contact with it.    Meanwhile the word of the Bible was steadily gaining importance in  Palestine. To search into and expound the sacred text had become the  inheritance of the congregation of Jacob, of those that had not lent ear  to the siren notes of Hellenism. Midrash, as the investigations of the  commentators were called, by and by divided into two streams--Halacha,  which establishes and systematizes the statutes of the Law, and Haggada,  which uses the sacred texts for homiletic, historical, ethical, and  pedagogic discussions. The latter is the poetic, the former, the  legislative, element in the Talmudic writings, whose composition,  extending over a thousand years, constitutes the third, the most  momentous, period of Jewish literature. Of course, none of these periods  can be so sharply defined as a rapid survey might lead one to suppose.  For instance, on the threshold of this third epoch stands the figure of  Flavius Josephus, the famous Jewish historian, who, at once an  enthusiastic Jew and a friend of the Romans, writes the story of his  nation in the Greek language--a character as peculiar as his age, which,  listening to the mocking laughter of a Lucian, saw Olympus overthrown  and its gods dethroned, the Temple at Jerusalem pass away in flame and  smoke, and the new doctrine of the son of the carpenter at Nazareth  begin its victorious course.    By the side of this Janus-faced historian, the heroes of the Talmud  stand enveloped in glory. We meet with men like Hillel and Shammai,  Jochanan ben Zakkai, Gamaliel, Joshua ben Chananya, the famous Akiba,  and later on Yehuda the Prince, friend of the imperial philosopher  Marcus Aurelius, and compiler of the Mishna, the authoritative code of  laws superseding all other collections. Then there are the fabulist  Meir; Simon ben Yochai, falsely accused of the authorship of the  mystical Kabbala; Chiya; Rab; Samuel, equally famous as a physician and  a rabbi; Jochanan, the supposed compiler of the Jerusalem Talmud; and  Ashi and Abina, the former probably the arranger of the Babylonian  Talmud. This latter Talmud, the one invested with authority among Jews,  by reason of its varying fortunes, is the most marvellous literary  monument extant. Never has book been so hated and so persecuted, so  misjudged and so despised, on the other hand, so prized and so honored,  and, above all, so imperfectly understood, as this very Talmud.    For the Jews and their literature it has had untold significance. That  the Talmud has been the conservator of Judaism is an irrefutable  statement. It is true that the study of the Talmud unduly absorbed the  great intellectual force of its adherents, and brought about a somewhat  one-sided mental development in the Jews; but it also is true, as a  writer says,[4] that \"whenever in troublous times scientific inquiry was  laid low; whenever, for any reason, the Jew was excluded from  participation in public life, the study of the Talmud maintained the  elasticity and the vigor of the Jewish mind, and rescued the Jew from  sterile mysticism and spiritual apathy. The Talmud, as a rule, has been  inimical to mysticism, and the most brilliant Talmudists, in propitious  days, have achieved distinguished success in secular science. The Jew  survived ages of bitterness, all the while clinging loyally to his faith  in the midst of hostility, and the first ray of light that penetrated  the walls of the Ghetto found him ready to take part in the intellectual  work of his time. This admirable elasticity of mind he owes, first and  foremost, to the study of the Talmud.\"    From this much abused Talmud, as from its contemporary the Midrash in  the restricted sense, sprouted forth the blossoms of the Haggada--that"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/27911"],[0,"The Giraffe Hunters (#2)"],[1,"go, stole forth to take a look at the surrounding country.    They directed their course down the river.  On reaching the place where  they had crossed it, they chanced upon a tableau that even a hunter, who  is supposed to take delight in the destruction of animals, could not  look upon without unpleasant emotions.    Within the space of a hundred yards were lying five dead antelopes, of a  species Willem had never seen before.  Feeding on the carcasses were  several hyenas.  On the approach of the hunters, they slowly moved away,  each laughing like a madman who has just committed some horrible  atrocity.    By the \"spoors\" seen upon the river-banks, it was evident that both  elephants and lions had visited the place during the night.  While  making these and other reconnoissances, Groot Willem was joined by Hans,  who had already commenced his favourite study by making an examination  of the floral treasures in his immediate locality.  Arriving up with  Groot Willem, the attention of Hans was at once directed to an  examination of the antelopes, which he pronounced to be elands, but  believed them to be of a new and undescribed variety of this animal.  They were elands; but each was marked with small white stripes across  the body, in this respect resembling \"koodoos.\"    After a short examination of the spoor, Congo asserted that a troop of  elands had first visited the watering-place, and that while they were  there four bull elephants, also in search of water, had charged with  great speed upon the antelopes.  Three or four lions had also joined in  the strife, in which the only victims had been the unfortunate elands.    \"I think we are in a place where we had better make a regular enclosure,  and stop for a few days,\" suggested Groot Willem, on his return to the  camp.  \"There is plenty of feed for the horses, and we have proof that  the `drift' where we crossed is a great resort for all kinds of game.\"    \"I'm of the same opinion,\" assented Hendrik; \"but I don't wish to encamp  quite so close to the crossing as this is.  We had better move some  distance off.  Then we shall not prevent game from seeking the drift, or  be ourselves hindered from getting sleep.  Don't you think we'd better  move little farther up the river?\"    \"Yes, yes,\" was the unanimous answer.    It was therefore decided that search should be made for a better  camping-ground, where they could build themselves a proper enclosure, or  \"kraal.\"    After partaking of their first breakfast upon the Limpopo, Groot Willem,  Hans, and Hendrik mounted their horses and rode off up the river,  accompanied by the full pack of dogs, leaving Arend, with Swartboy and  Congo, to take care of the camp.    For nearly three miles, the young hunters rode along the bank of the  river, without finding any spot where access to the water could be  readily obtained.  The banks were high and steep, and therefore but  little visited by such animals as they wished to hunt.  At this point  the features of the landscape began to change, presenting an appearance  more to their satisfaction.  Light timber, such as would be required for  the construction of a stockade, was growing near the river, which was no  longer inaccessible, though its banks appeared but little frequented by  game.    \"I think this place will suit admirably,\" said Groot Willem.  \"We are  only half an hour's ride from the drift, and probably we may find good  hunting-ground farther up stream.\"    \"Very likely,\" rejoined Hendrik; \"but before taking too much trouble to  build ourselves a big kraal, we had better be sure about what sort of  game is to be got here.\"    \"You are right about that,\" answered Willem; \"we must take care to find  out whether there are hippopotami and giraffes.  We cannot go home  without a pair of the latter.  Our friends would be disappointed, and  some I know would have a laugh at us.\"    \"And you for one would deserve it,\" said Hans.  \"Remember how you  ridiculed the other hunters who returned unsuccessful.\"    Having selected a place for the kraal, should they decide on staying  awhile in the neighbourhood, the young hunters proceeded farther up the  river, for the purpose of learning something more of the hunting-ground  before finally determining to construct the enclosure.        CHAPTER THREE.    A TWIN TRAP.    Not long after the departure of Groot Willem and his companions, Arend,  looking towards a thicket about half a mile from the river, perceived a  small herd of antelopes quietly browsing upon the plain.  Mounting his  horse, he rode off, with the intention of bagging one or more of them  for the day's dinner.    Having ridden to the leeward of the herd, and getting near them, he saw  that they were of the species known as \"Duyker,\" or Divers (_Antelope  grimmia_).  Near them was a small \"motte\" of the _Nerium oleander_, a  shrub about twelve feet high, loaded with beautiful blossoms.  Under the  cover of these bushes, he rode up close enough to the antelopes to  insure a good shot, and, picking out one of the largest of the herd, he  fired.    All the antelopes but one rushed to the edge of the thicket, made a  grand leap, and dived out of sight over the tops of the bushes,--thus  affording a beautiful illustration of that peculiarity to which they are  indebted for their name of Divers.  Riding up to the one that had  remained behind, and which was that at which he had fired, the young  hunter made sure that it was dead; he then trotted back to the camp, and  despatched Congo and the Bushman to bring it in.  They soon returned  with the carcass, which they proceeded to skin and make ready for the  spit.    While thus engaged, Swartboy appeared to notice some thing out upon the  plain.    \"Look yonner, Baas Arend,\" said he.    \"Well, what is it, Swart?\"    \"You see da pack-horse dare?  He gone too much off from de camp.\"    Arend turned and looked in the direction the Bushman was pointing.  One  of the horses, which had strayed from its companions, was now more than  half a mile off, and was wandering onwards.    \"All right, Swart.  You go on with your cooking.  I'll ride after it  myself, and drive it in.\"    Arend, again mounting his horse, trotted off in the direction of the  animal that had strayed.    For cooking the antelope, Congo and Swartboy saw the necessity of  providing themselves with some water; and taking a vessel for that  purpose, they set out for the drift,--that being the nearest place where  they could obtain it.    They kept along the bank of the river, and just before reaching a place  where they would descend to the water, Congo, who was in the advance,  suddenly disappeared!  He had walked on to a carefully concealed pit,  dug for the purpose of catching hippopotami or elephants.    The hole was about nine feet deep; and after being astonished by  dropping into it, the Kaffir was nearly blinded by the sand, dust, and  other materials that had formed the covering of the pit.    Congo was too well acquainted with this South African device for killing  large game to be anyways disconcerted by what had happened; and after  becoming convinced that he was uninjured by the fall, he turned his  glance upward, expecting assistance from his companion.    But Swartboy's aid could not just then be given.  The Bushman, amused by  the ludicrous incident that had befallen his rival, was determined to  enjoy the fun for a little longer.  Uttering a wild shout of laughter  that was a tolerable imitation of an enraged hyena, Swartboy seemed  transported into a heaven of unadulterated joy.  Earth appeared hardly  able to hold him as he leaped and danced around the edge of the pit.    Never had his peculiar little mind been so intensely delighted; but the  manifestations of that delight were more suddenly terminated than  commenced; for in the midst of his eccentric capers he, too, suddenly  disappeared into the earth as if swallowed up by an earthquake!  His  misfortune was similar to that which had befallen his companion.  Two  pitfalls had been constructed close together, and Swartboy now occupied  the second.    It is a common practice among the natives of South Africa to trap the  elephant in these twin pitfalls; as the animals, too hastily avoiding  the one, run the risk of dropping into the other.    Swartboy and the Kaffir had unexpectedly found a place where this plan  had been adopted; and, much to their discomfiture, without the success  anticipated by those who had taken the trouble to contrive it.    The cavity into which Congo had fallen contained about two feet of mud  on the bottom.  The sides were perpendicular, and of a soapy sort of  clay, so that his attempts at climbing out proved altogether  unsuccessful, thus greatly increasing the chagrin of his unphilosophic  mind.  He had heard the Bushman's screams of delight, and the sounds had  contributed nothing to reconcile him to the mischance that had befallen  him.  Several minutes passed and he heard nothing of Swartboy.    He was not surprised at the Bushman's having been amused as well as  gratified by his misfortune.  Still, he expected that in time he would  lend assistance and pull him out of the pit.  But as this assistance was  not given, and as Swartboy, not satisfied with laughing at his  misfortune appeared also to have gone off and left him to his fate, the  Kaffir became frantic with rage.    Several more minutes passed, which to Congo seemed hours, and still  nothing was seen or heard of his companion.  Had Swartboy returned to  the camp?  If so, why had not Arend, on ascertaining what was wrong,  hastened to the relief of his faithful servant?  As some addition to the  discomforts of the place, the pit contained many reptiles and insects  that had in some manner obtained admittance, and, like himself, could  not escape.  There were toads, frogs, large ants called \"soldiers,\" and  other creatures whose company he had no relish to keep.    In vain he called, \"Swartbo"]]]
