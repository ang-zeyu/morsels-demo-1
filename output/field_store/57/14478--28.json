The fat should be hot at first,  that it may not penetrate; then reduce the heat, that the food may cook  till done, without burning.    Crumbed food is usually arranged in a croquette basket before placing it  in the hot fat. This prevents the food from moving about, which  sometimes causes the crust to loosen from the food, allowing it to  absorb the fat.    Never let the fat heat to smoking point, for then it is burning hot, and  the food will burn on the outside while the inside remains raw and  uncooked. Cook only three or four pieces at once, for more will chill  the fat and prevent perfect frying.    After the food has been cooked by this frying method it should be  carefully removed at once from the fat and drained on brown paper.      Care of Cottolene After Frying    After the frying is done, the fat should be allowed to stand in a cool  place to permit any sediment to settle. When cool, pour the fat  carefully through a double fold of cheesecloth, or through a fine  strainer. It is then ready for use.    Cottolene does not retain the taste or odor from any article whatever  that may be fried in it, and it may be used over and over again. You may  from time to time, add fresh Cottolene to it as your quantity  diminishes, but the frying qualities of the Cottolene are not affected  by the shrinkage of the fat.          What Noted Cooking Experts Think of Cottolene.      THE high regard in which Cottolene is held by all those who have made a  careful study of food preparation and food values is conclusively shown  by the following testimonials received from famous authorities on  Domestic Science:      Mrs. Sarah Tyson Rorer    Principal Philadelphia Cooking School and Culinary Editor \"The Ladies'  Home Journal.\"              \"_I use Cottolene in every and all the ways that            one would use lard, also in the preparation of            sweet cakes. I consider it an important frying            medium and a much more healthful product than            lard._\"           *       *       *       *       *    Marion Harland    Author of the famous \"Marion Harland Cook Book.\"              \"_Many years ago I discontinued the use of lard in            my kitchen and substituted for it--as an            experiment--Cottolene, then comparatively a new            product. Since my first trial of it I can truly            say that it has given complete satisfaction,            whether it is used alone, as 'shortening,' or in            combination with butter in pastry, biscuit, etc.,            or in frying. I honestly believe it to be the very            best thing of its kind ever offered to the            American housekeeper._\"           *       *       *       *       *    Mrs. Janet M.

As a shortening agent in pastry, biscuit,            etc., it has proved all that you claim for it, and            as a frying agent it is entirely satisfactory._\"           *       *       *       *       *    Miss Mary Arline Zurhorst    Principal National School Domestic Arts and Science, Washington, D.

The chief cause of indigestion is food  prepared with lard. The following are but brief extracts from letters  received, showing the high esteem in which Cottolene is regarded as a  cooking medium by physicians ranking among the highest in the  profession.

This preparation is both            economical and convenient, free from adulteration            and impurities, and dietetic experiments            conclusively show that incorporated in food it            yields to the body available nourishment._\"           *       *       *       *       *    R.

HOW TO MEASURE      ONE cup, or one tablespoon, or one teaspoon, means a full measure--all  it will hold of liquid, and even with the rim, or edge, of dry material.  All measurements in this book are level unless otherwise stated, and  _the quantities indicated are designed for a family of six persons_.    Stir up all packed materials, like mustard in its box, and sift flour  before measuring. Fill cup without shaking down, and dip spoon in  material, taking up a heaped measure, then with a knife scrape off  toward the tip till you have level measure. Pack butter or Cottolene in  cup so there will be no air spaces. A scant cup means one-eighth less  and a heaped cup about one-eighth more than a level cup.    Divide a level spoon lengthwise for a half measure, and a half spoon  crosswise for quarters or eighths. A pinch means about one-eighth, so  does a saltspoon; less means a dash or a few grains.    A rounded tablespoon means filled above the rim as much as the spoon  hollow below, and equals two of level measure. It also equals one ounce  in weight, and two rounded tablespoons if put together would heap a  tablespoon about as high as would an egg, giving us the old-time measure  of \"butter size of an egg,\" or two ounces, or one-fourth the cup.    Except in delicate cake, or where it is creamed with sugar, and in  pastry--where it should be chilled to make a flaky crust, COTTOLENE or  butter may be most quickly and economically measured after it is melted.  Keep a small supply in a granite cup, and when needed, stand the cup in  hot water, and when melted, pour the amount desired into the spoon or  cup. For all kinds of breakfast cakes, it is especially helpful to  measure it in this way.    Soda, baking powder, spices, etc., are generally measured with a  teaspoon, level measure, for this gives the proportional amount needed  for the cup measure of other materials.

The race goes nowhere but  after all, there is nowhere to go. _They_ proved that. The men who built  the road. I will speak with your visitors as I agreed, if they come. But  I think I will only ask them to go.\"    \"The race is not going nowhere,\" said the Astronomer, earnestly. \"It is  going toward final destruction. My university has a smaller student body  each year. Fewer books are written. Less work is done. An old man sleeps  in the sun and his days are peaceful and unchanging, but each day finds  him nearer death all the same.\"    \"Well, well,\" said the Industrialist.    \"No, don't dismiss it. Listen. Before I wrote you, I investigated your  position in the planetary economy.\"    \"And you found me solvent?\" interrupted the Industrialist, smiling.    \"Why, yes. Oh, I see, you are joking. And yet--perhaps the joke is not  far off. You are less solvent than your father and he was less solvent  than his father. Perhaps your son will no longer be solvent. It becomes  too troublesome for the planet to support even the industries that still  exist, though they are toothpicks to the oak trees of Beforethewars. We  will be back to village economy and then to what? The caves?\"    \"And the infusion of fresh technological knowledge will be the changing  of all that?\"    \"Not just the new knowledge. Rather the whole effect of change, of a  broadening of horizons. Look, sir, I chose you to approach in this  matter not only because you were rich and influential with government  officials, but because you had an unusual reputation, for these days, of  daring to break with tradition. Our people will resist change and you  would know how to handle them, how to see to it that--that--\"    \"That the youth of the race is revived?\"    \"Yes.\"    \"With its atomic bombs?\"    \"The atomic bombs,\" returned the Astronomer, \"need not be the end of  civilization. These visitors of mine had their atomic bomb, or whatever  their equivalent was on their own worlds, and survived it, because they  didn't give up. Don't you see? It wasn't the bomb that defeated us, but  our own shell shock. This may be the last chance to reverse the  process.\"    [Illustration]    \"Tell me,\" said the Industrialist, \"what do these friends from space  want in return?\"    The Astronomer hesitated. He said, \"I will be truthful with you. They  come from a denser planet. Ours is richer in the lighter atoms.\"    \"They want magnesium? Aluminum?\"    \"No, sir. Carbon and hydrogen. They want coal and oil.\"    \"Really?\"    The Astronomer said, quickly, \"You are going to ask why creatures who  have mastered space travel, and therefore atomic power, would want coal  and oil. I can't answer that.\"    The Industrialist smiled. \"But I can. This is the best evidence yet of  the truth of your story. Superficially, atomic power would seem to  preclude the use of coal and oil. However, quite apart from the energy  gained by their combustion they remain, and always will remain, the  basic raw material for all organic chemistry. Plastics, dyes,  pharmaceuticals, solvents. Industry could not exist without them, even  in an atomic age. Still, if coal and oil are the low price for which  they would sell us the troubles and tortures of racial youth, my answer  is that the commodity would be dear if offered gratis.\"    The Astronomer sighed and said, \"There are the boys!\"    They were visible through the open window, standing together in the  grassy field and lost in animated conversation. The Industrialist's son  pointed imperiously and the Astronomer's son nodded and made off at a  run toward the house.    The Industrialist said, \"There is the Youth you speak of. Our race has  as much of it as it ever had.\"    \"Yes, but we age them quickly and pour them into the mold.\"    Slim scuttled into the room, the door banging behind him.    The Astronomer said, in mild disapproval, \"What's this?\"    Slim looked up in surprise and came to a halt. \"I beg your pardon. I  didn't know anyone was here. I am sorry to have interrupted.\" His  enunciation was almost painfully precise.    The Industrialist said, \"It's all right, youngster.\"    But the Astronomer said, \"Even if you had been entering an empty room,  son, there would be no cause for slamming a door.\"    \"Nonsense,\" insisted the Industrialist. \"The youngster has done no harm.  You simply scold him for being young. You, with your views!\"    He said to Slim, \"Come here, lad.\"    Slim advanced slowly.    \"How do you like the country, eh?\"    \"Very much, sir, thank you.\"    \"My son has been showing you about the place, has he?\"    \"Yes, sir. Red--I mean--\"    \"No, no. Call him Red. I call him that myself. Now tell me, what are you  two up to, eh?\"    Slim looked away. \"Why--just exploring, sir.\"    The Industrialist turned to the Astronomer. \"There you are, youthful  curiosity and adventure-lust. The race has not yet lost it.\"    Slim said, \"Sir?\"    \"Yes, lad.\"    The youngster took a long time in getting on with it. He said, \"Red sent  me in for something good to eat, but I don't exactly know what he meant.  I didn't like to say so.\"    \"Why, just ask cook. She'll have something good for young'uns to eat.\"    \"Oh, no, sir. I mean for animals.\"    \"For animals?\"    \"Yes, sir. What do animals eat?\"    The Astronomer said, \"I am afraid my son is city-bred.\"    \"Well,\" said the Industrialist, \"there's no harm in that. What kind of  an animal, lad?\"    \"A small one, sir.\"    \"Then try grass or leaves, and if they don't want that, nuts or berries  would probably do the trick.\"    \"Thank you, sir.\" Slim ran out again, closing the door gently behind  him.    The Astronomer said, \"Do you suppose they've trapped an animal alive?\"  He was obviously perturbed.    \"That's common enough. There's no shooting on my estate and it's tame  country, full of rodents and small creatures. Red is always coming home  with pets of one sort or another. They rarely maintain his interest for  long.\"    He looked at the wall clock. \"Your friends should have been here by now,  shouldn't they?\"      III    The swaying had come to a halt and it was dark. The Explorer was not  comfortable in the alien air. It felt as thick as soup and he had to  breathe shallowly. Even so--    He reached out in a sudden need for company. The Merchant was warm to  the touch. His breathing was rough, he moved in an occasional spasm, and  was obviously asleep. The Explorer hesitated and decided not to wake  him. It would serve no real purpose.    There would be no rescue, of course. That was the penalty paid for the  high profits which unrestrained competition could lead to. The Merchant  who opened a new planet could have a ten year monopoly of its trade,  which he might hug to himself or, more likely, rent out to all comers at  a stiff price. It followed that planets were searched for in secrecy  and, preferably, away from the usual trade routes. In a case such as  theirs, then, there was little or no chance that another ship would come  within range of their subetherics except for the most improbable of  coincidences. Even if they were in their ship, that is, rather than in  this--this--_cage_.    The Explorer grasped the thick bars. Even if they blasted those away, as  they could, they would be stuck too high in open air for leaping.    It was too bad. They had landed twice before in the scout-ship. They had  established contact with the natives who were grotesquely huge, but mild  and unaggressive. It was obvious that they had once owned a flourishing  technology, but hadn't faced up to the consequences of such a  technology. It would have been a wonderful market.    And it was a tremendous world. The Merchant, especially, had been taken  aback. He had known the figures that expressed the planet's diameter,  but from a distance of two light-seconds, he had stood at the visi-plate  and muttered, \"Unbelievable!\"    \"Oh, there are larger worlds,\" the Explorer said. It wouldn't do for an  Explorer to be too easily impressed.    \"Inhabited?\"    \"Well, no.\"    \"Why, you could drop your planet into that large ocean and drown it.\"    The Explorer smiled. It was a gentle dig at his Arcturian homeland,  which was smaller than most planets. He said, \"Not quite.\"    The Merchant followed along the line of his thoughts. \"And the  inhabitants are large in proportion to their world?\" He sounded as  though the news struck him less favorably now.    \"Nearly ten times our height.\"    \"Are you sure they are friendly?\"    \"That is hard to say. Friendship between alien intelligences is an  imponderable. They are not dangerous, I think. We've come across other  groups that could not maintain equilibrium after the atomic war stage  and you know the results. Introversion. Retreat. Gradual decadence and  increasing gentleness.\"    \"Even if they are such monsters?\"    \"The principle remains.\"    It was about then that the Explorer felt the heavy throbbing of the  engines.    He frowned and said, \"We are descending a bit too quickly.\"    There had been some speculation on the dangers of landing some hours  before. The planetary target was a huge one for an oxygen-water world.  Though it lacked the size of the uninhabitable hydrogen-ammonia planets  and its low density made its surface gravity fairly normal, its  gravitational forces fell off but slowly with distance. In short, its  gravitational potential was high and the ship's Calculator was a  run-of-the-mill model not designed to plot landing trajectories at that  potential range. That meant the Pilot would have to use manual controls.    It would have been wiser to install a more high-powered model, but that  would have meant a trip to some outpost of civilization; lost time;  perhaps a lost secret. The Merchant demanded an immediate landing.    The Merchant felt it necessary to defend his position now. He said  angrily to the Explorer, \"Don't you think the Pilot knows his job? He  landed you safely twice before.\"    Yes, thought the Explorer, in a"]]]
