His brilliant discoveries, the man of science regards as his peculiar  property; the means by which they were made, and the development of his  intellectual character, belong to the logician and to the philosopher;  but the triumphs and the reverses of his eventful life must be claimed  for our common nature, as a source of more than ordinary instruction.    The lengthened career which Providence assigned to Galileo was filled up  throughout its rugged outline with events even of dramatic interest. But  though it was emblazoned with achievements of transcendent magnitude,  yet his noblest discoveries were the derision of his contemporaries, and  were even denounced as crimes which merited the vengeance of Heaven.  Though he was the idol of his friends, and the favoured companion of  princes, yet he afterwards became the victim of persecution, and spent  some of his last hours within the walls of a prison; and though the  Almighty granted him, as it were, a new sight to descry unknown worlds  in the obscurity of space, yet the eyes which were allowed to witness  such wonders, were themselves doomed to be closed in darkness.    Such were the lights and shadows in which history delineates        \"The starry Galileo with his woes.\"[1]          [1] Childe Harold, canto iv. stanza liv.      But, however powerful be their contrasts, they are not unusual in  their proportions. The balance which has been struck between his days of  good and evil, is that which regulates the lot of man, whether we study  it in the despotic sway of the autocrat, in the peaceful inquiries of  the philosopher, or in the humbler toils of ordinary life.    Galileo Galilei was born at Pisa, on the 15th of February, 1564, and was  the eldest of a family of three sons and three daughters. Under the name  of Bonajuti, his noble ancestors had filled high offices at Florence;  but about the middle of the 14th century they seem to have abandoned  this surname for that of Galileo. Vincenzo Galilei, our author's father,  was himself a philosopher of no mean powers; and though his talents seem  to have been exercised only in the composition of treatises on the  theory and practice of music, yet he appears to have anticipated even  his son in a just estimate of the philosophy of the age, and in a  distinct perception of the true method of investigating truth.[2]         [2] Life of Galileo, Library of Useful Knowledge, p. 1.    The early years of Galileo were, like those of almost all great  experimental philosophers, spent in the construction of instruments and  pieces of machinery, which were calculated chiefly to amuse himself and  his schoolfellows. This employment of his hands, however, did not  interfere with his regular studies; and though, from the straitened  circumstances of his father, he was educated under considerable  disadvantages, yet he acquired the elements of classical literature, and  was initiated into all the learning of the times. Music, drawing, and  painting were the occupations of his leisure hours; and such was his  proficiency in these arts, that he was reckoned a skilful performer on  several musical instruments, especially the lute; and his knowledge of  pictures was held in great esteem by some of the best artists of his  day.    Galileo seems to have been desirous of following the profession of a  painter: but his father had observed decided indications of early  genius; and, though by no means able to afford it, he resolved to send  him to the university to pursue the study of medicine. He accordingly  enrolled himself as a scholar in arts at the university of Pisa, on the  5th of November, 1581, and pursued his medical studies under the  celebrated botanist Andrew Caesalpinus, who filled the chair of medicine  from 1567 to 1592.    In order to study the principles of music and drawing, Galileo found it  necessary to acquire some knowledge of geometry. His father seems to  have foreseen the consequences of following this new pursuit, and though  he did not prohibit him from reading Euclid under Ostilio Ricci, one of  the professors at Pisa, yet he watched his progress with the utmost  jealousy, and had resolved that it should not interfere with his medical  studies. The demonstrations, however, of the Greek mathematician had too  many charms for the ardent mind of Galileo. His whole attention was  engrossed with the new truths which burst upon his understanding; and  after many fruitless attempts to check his ardour and direct his  thoughts to professional objects, his father was obliged to surrender  his parental control, and allow the fullest scope to the genius of his  son.    From the elementary works of geometry, Galileo passed to the writings of  Archimedes; and while he was studying the hydrostatical treatise[3] of  the Syracusan philosopher, he wrote his essay on the hydrostatical  balance,[4] in which he describes the construction of the instrument,  and the method by which Archimedes detected the fraud committed by the  jeweller in the composition of Hiero's crown. This work gained for its  author the esteem of Guido Ubaldi, who had distinguished himself by his  mechanical and mathematical acquirements, and who engaged his young  friend to investigate the subject of the centre of gravity in solid  bodies. The treatise on this subject, which Galileo presented to his  patron, proved the source of his future success in life.         [3] De Insidentibus in Fluido.         [4] Opere di Galileo. Milano, 1810, vol. iv. p. 248-257.    Through the Cardinal del Monte, the brother-in-law of Ubaldi, the  reigning Duke of Tuscany, Ferdinand de Medici was made acquainted with  the merits of our young philosopher; and, in 1589, he was appointed  lecturer on mathematics at Pisa. As the salary, however, attached to  this office was only sixty crowns, he was compelled to enlarge this  inadequate income by the additional occupation of private teaching, and  thus to encroach upon the leisure which he was anxious to devote to  science.    With this moderate competency, Galileo commenced his philosophical  career. At the early age of eighteen, when he had entered the  university, his"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/26005"],[0,"Armour's Monthly Cook Book, Volume 2, No. 12, October 1913 (#2)"],[1,"singing lips of dreams into the rose.

Soak the silk in this until the yellow tinge disappears. This will take  about an hour in ordinary cases.    Rinse immediately in several clear waters.          The Subject of Desserts      [Illustration]    Although a meal satisfies your hunger you should have dessert, because  the educated palate craves that particular spice as a proper finish.  Scientists tell us that a dinner digests better because of a tasty  dessert, which, they say, gives the final stimulus necessary to dispose  of the food previously received.    The simple desserts are the best desserts, and none is more pleasing to  the eye and the palate or so easily made or so frequently served in an  imperfect manner, than custards.    With a supply of good eggs in the pantry the housewife need never be at  a loss for a tasty custard, and if she is wise enough to buy Armour's  Fancy Selects when she orders eggs from her market man their goodness  will be reflected in her desserts. Aside from their goodness their extra  large size will always recommend their use to the wise housewife. They  come packed in an extra large carton.      Custard Puddings    These being the more easily made may be considered first. They may  either be steamed or baked but the mixture is the same in either case.  Allow two eggs and a teaspoonful of sugar to each half pint of milk.  Beat the eggs with sugar thoroughly, but do not froth them, as the  custard must be as smooth and free from holes as possible. Add the milk  slowly, also a few drops of flavoring essence--vanilla, almonds or  lemon. Pour into a buttered mould (or into individual moulds), set in a  pan of hot water and bake until firm. Chill thoroughly and turn out on  serving dish. Serve with sugar and cream. A pleasing addition to the  above is made by garnishing the sides of the mould with strips of Canton  ginger before pouring in the custard.      Coffee Custard    Make an infusion of coffee by pouring half a pint of boiling milk on a  heaping tablespoonful of powdered coffee. Put it aside to settle, and  when cold strain off the milk and use with the eggs as in previous  recipe.    Boiled Custard    This is also made from milk and eggs and is usually served instead of  cream with stewed or preserved fruit. \"Boiled\" custard is rather a  misnomer as on no account must the boiling point be reached in cooking,  for if the custard bubbles it curdles. As soon as the custard begins to  thicken the saucepan must be taken from the fire and the stirring  continued for a second or two longer. If the cooking is done in a double  boiler the risk of boiling is very much lessened.          Everyday Uses of Armour's Grape Juice    Give your family Armour's Grape Juice as an everyday beverage and their  bodies will be kept healthy without drugs.    Instead of serving fruit in the morning serve a wineglassful of Armour's  Grape Juice undiluted. If taken at the beginning of breakfast do not add  ice. For children, water may be added if desired.    In moistening mincemeat use Armour's Grape Juice instead of jelly or  wine. In making \"Brown Betty\" use Armour's Grape Juice instead of water  and molasses and you will find it richer and more delicious.    In making sauce for all kinds of fruit puddings, use Armour's Grape  Juice, hot or cold, thickened when necessary with a little cornstarch.    When making fruit salad to be served as a dessert, pour over the mixed  fruits, immediately before serving, a cup of Armour's Grape Juice.    In serving grape fruit, after carefully removing the white pith, pour  over each portion a wineglassful of Armour's Grape Juice.    Many people find it difficult to take raw eggs when recommended by their  doctor. This difficulty is removed by breaking the egg into a glass of  Armour's Grape Juice. The egg is swallowed easily and in addition to the  nourishment obtained there is the tonic value of the rich fruit from  which the grape juice is taken.    _VERIBEST CANNED MEATS--save work and worry_          Informal Porch Suppers    [Illustration]      If you are fortunate enough to possess a wide porch or a stretch of lawn  do not forget your less fortunate friends, and give an occasional  informal party there while the weather is still fine. Food always tastes  so much better in the fresh air and when friends are present it makes  the affair nothing more than a kind of glorified picnic. There are few  more pleasant ways of entertaining than by giving a porch party. It is  very little trouble to arrange an affair of this kind--less than the  average picnic indeed--and grown people usually enjoy it more as it is  much more comfortable to sit in a chair before a real table than to  perch on a log or rock while eating. A porch party is an ideal way of  entertaining for the woman who has to do her own work. Most of the  dishes can be prepared the day before, making the serving easier.    If not convenient to have a large table a number of small card tables  placed close together will answer the purpose. Charming table sets of  white crepe paper can be bought for very little and save very materially  in the doing up of the linen.    Prepare as much as possible early in the day. If you have sandwiches  wrap them in a damp napkin; if cold drinks are wanted have them well  chilled, your glasses and straws handy, have your silver and china ready  at hand so that when your guests arrive you may devote your time and  attention to them. The following menus are not hard to prepare and the  dishes will be found most palatable and suited to every purse: Veribest  Canned Meats, the standby of the housewife who combines economy of time  with excellence of quality, are used in many of them. There is a wide  range of these meats delicious and many ways of using them. Every pantry  should have at least one shelf devoted to them so that the housewife  need never be at a loss for the basis of a good meal.        FRUIT COCKTAIL        HAM MOUSSE, POTATO CHIPS      or      CREAMED CHICKEN, served in roll,      or      TONGUE TOAST, CREAM SAUCE      or      CHICKEN IN ASPIC IN INDIVIDUAL MOULDS        POTATOES AU GRATIN        TOMATO WAFFLES        SALAD ROLLS        CHILLED CUCUMBERS        MARSHMALLOW PUDDING      or      FIG CUSTARD        COFFEE FRAPPE ICED COCOA      GRAPE JUICE.      Ham Mousse    One tablespoonful granulated gelatine, one half cup hot water, one can  Veribest Deviled Ham, teaspoonful mustard (mixed), one half cup rich  cream.    Dissolve the gelatine in the hot water, and add to the ham; season with  the mustard, add the cream beaten stiff and pour into a mould which has  been previously wet with cold water. Chill. Turn out to serve and  garnish with parsley.      Creamed Chicken    Make a plain white sauce of one tablespoonful butter, one tablespoonful  flour and one cup of milk with seasoning of salt and pepper. When this  is ready add the contents of a can of Veribest Boned Chicken, gently  pulling apart the flakes of meat with a fork. When thoroughly heated  serve in a roll which has been hollowed out for the purpose, with a  garnish of cooked asparagus stalks.      Tongue Toast    Remove the contents of a can of Veribest Lunch Tongue and cut in dice.  Add a little cream and the beaten yolk of one egg. Simmer for a few  minutes and serve on squares of toast.      Potatoes au Gratin    Dice enough cold boiled potatoes to measure one pint. Put one  tablespoonful of butter and the same amount of flour in a saucepan with  a little salt and pepper. Cook till well mixed, then add one cupful of  milk and stir until smooth and thick. Add the potatoes and simmer five  minutes, then pour into a buttered, shallow baking dish. Mix one scant  cupful of fine, dry bread crumbs with one tablespoonful of melted  butter, spread over the potatoes and place in a hot oven until the  crumbs are a golden brown, then serve hot.      Marshmallow Pudding    Make a plain lemon jelly, adding a little sherry wine if desired. Put a  layer of sliced marshmallows in the bottom of the mold, and when the  jelly has begun to set spread a little of it over them. Continue with  jelly and marshmallows till the mold is full, then put away to harden.  Serve with whipped cream.      A Dainty Dessert    Lemon and grape juice frappe is another cool dessert that is also light.  To make it, boil a pint of water with two cupfuls of granulated sugar  for ten minutes and cool it. Then add a little cinnamon and half a  cupful of lemon juice, and lastly a quart of Armour's grape juice.  Freeze and serve in cups, with a little of the grape juice.           *       *       *       *       *    Shelving Responsibility    \"I'll ask my husband.\"    \"I don't think my husband would allow me to do that.\"    \"I'm sure Jack would say 'No.'\"    Do you know the wife who, whenever she does not want to do anything,  always places the responsibility on her husband's shoulders?    She knows quite well that she can do almost anything she likes with her  husband, and that there are really precious few things that he _would_  say \"No\" to her doing, but she finds that to say her husband would never  allow her to do this, or that, is a very easy way of saying \"No\" to  people without offending them.
