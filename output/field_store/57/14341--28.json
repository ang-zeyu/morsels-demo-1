He was much respected by all the state authorities,  and was carefully watching over the two young sons of another future  Confederate leader, General Beauregard. William Tecumseh Sherman  had retired from the Army without seeing any war service, unlike  Haskins, who was a one-armed veteran of the Mexican campaign. But  Sherman was determined to stand by the Union, come what might.  Yet he was equally determined to wind up the affairs of the State  Academy so as to hand them over in perfect order. A few days after  the seizure of the Arsenal, and before the formal secession of  the State, he wrote to the Governor:    \"Sir: As I occupy a _quasi_-military position under the laws of  the State, I deem it proper to acquaint you that I accepted such  position when Louisiana was a State of the Union, and when the motto  of this seminary was inserted in marble over the main door: \"By  the liberality of the General Government of the United States. The  Union--_esto perpetua_.\" Recent events foreshadow a great change, and  it becomes all men to choose.... I beg you to take immediate steps  to relieve me as superintendent, the moment the State determines to  secede, for on no earthly account will I do any act or think any  thought hostile to, or in defiance of, the old Government of the  United States.\"    Then, to the lasting credit of all concerned, the future political  enemies parted as the best of personal friends. Sherman left everything  in perfect order, accounted for every cent of the funds, and received  the heartiest thanks and best wishes of all the governing officials,  who embodied the following sentence in their final resolution of  April 1, 1861: \"They cannot fail to appreciate the manliness of  character which has always marked the actions of Colonel Sherman.\"  Long before this Louisiana had seceded, and Sherman had gone north  to Lancaster, Ohio, where he arrived about the time of Lincoln's  inauguration.    Meanwhile, on the eighteenth of February, the greatest of all surrenders  had taken place in Texas, where nineteen army posts were handed  over to the State by General Twiggs. San Antonio was swarming with  Secessionist rangers. Unionist companies were marching up and down.  The Federal garrison was leaving the town on parole, with the band  playing Union airs and Union colors flying. The whole place was  at sixes and sevens, and anything might have happened.    In the midst of this confusion the colonel commanding the Second  Regiment of United States Cavalry arrived from Fort Mason. He was  on his way to Washington, where Winfield Scott, the veteran  General-in-Chief, was anxiously waiting to see him; for this colonel  was no ordinary man. He had been Scott's Chief of Staff in Mexico,  where he had twice won promotion for service in the field. He had  been a model Superintendent at West Point and an exceedingly good  officer of engineers before he left them, on promotion, for the  cavalry. Very tall and handsome, magnificently fit in body and in  mind, genial but of commanding presence, this flower of Southern  chivalry was not only every inch a soldier but a leader born and  bred. Though still unknown to public fame he was the one man to  whom the most insightful leaders of both sides turned, and rightly  turned; for this was Robert Lee, Lee of Virginia, soon to become  one of the very few really great commanders of the world.    As Lee came up to the hotel at San Antonio he was warmly greeted  by Mrs. Darrow, the anxious wife of the confidential clerk to Major  Vinton, the staunch Union officer in charge of the pay and quartermaster  services. \"Who are those men?\" he asked, pointing to the rangers,  who wore red flannel shoulder straps. \"They are McCulloch's,\" she  answered; \"General Twiggs surrendered everything to the State this  morning.\" Years after, when she and her husband and Vinton had  suffered for one side and Lee had suffered for the other, she wrote  her recollection of that memorable day in these few, telling words:  \"I shall never forget his look of astonishment, as, with his lips  trembling and his eyes full of tears, he exclaimed, 'Has it come  so soon as this?' In a short time I saw him crossing the plaza on  his way to headquarters and noticed particularly that he was in  citizen's dress. He returned at night and shut himself into his  room, which was over mine; and I heard his footsteps through the  night, and sometimes the murmur of his voice, as if he was praying.  He remained at the hotel a week and in conversations declared that  the position he held was a neutral one.\"    Three other Union witnesses show how Lee agonized over the fateful  decision he was being forced to make. Captain R. M. Potter says:  \"I have seldom seen a more distressed man. He said, 'When I get  to Virginia I think the world will have one soldier less. I shall  resign and go to planting corn.'\" Colonel Albert G. Brackett says:  \"Lee was filled with sorrow at the condition of affairs, and, in a  letter to me, deploring the war in which we were about to engage,  made use of these words: 'I fear the liberties of our country will  be buried in the tomb of a great nation.'\" Colonel Charles Anderson,  quoting Lee's final words in Texas, carries us to the point of parting:  \"I still think my loyalty to Virginia ought to take precedence  over that which is due to the Federal Government; and I shall so  report myself in Washington. If Virginia stands by the old Union,  so will I. But if she secedes (though I do not believe in secession  as a constitutional right, nor that there is sufficient cause for  revolution) then I will still follow my native State with my sword,  and, if need be, with my life. I know you think and feel very  differently. But I can't help it. These are my principles; and I  must follow them.\"    Lee reached Washington on the first of March. Lincoln, delivering  his Inaugural on the fourth, brought the country one step nearer  war by showing the neutrals how impossible it was to reconcile  his principles as President of the whole United States with those  of Jefferson Davis as President of the seceding parts. \"The power  confided to me will be used to hold, occupy, and possess the property  and places belonging to the government.\" Three days later the  provisional Confederate Congress at Montgomery in Alabama passed  an Army Act authorizing the enlistment of one hundred thousand  men for one year's service. Nine days later again, having adopted  a Constitution in the meantime, this Congress passed a Navy Act,  authorizing the purchase or construction of ten little gunboats.    In April the main storm center went whirling back to Charleston,  where Sherman's old friend Beauregard commanded the forces that  encircled Sumter. Sumter, still unfinished, had been designed for  a garrison of six hundred and fifty combatant men. It now contained  exactly sixty-five. It was to have been provisioned for six months.  The actual supplies could not be made to last beyond two weeks.  Both sides knew that Anderson's gallant little garrison must be  starved out by the fifteenth. But the excited Carolinians would  not wait, because they feared that the arrival of reinforcements  might balk them of their easy prey. On the eleventh Beauregard,  acting under orders from the Confederate Government, sent in a  summons to surrender. Anderson refused. At a quarter to one the  next morning the summons was repeated, as pilots had meanwhile  reported a Federal vessel approaching the harbor. Anderson again  refused and again admitted that he would be starved out on the  fifteenth. Thereupon Beauregard's aides declared immediate surrender  the only possible alternative to a bombardment and signed a note  at 3:20 A.M. giving Anderson formal warning that fire would be  opened in an hour.    Fort Sumter stood about half a mile inside the harbor mouth, fully  exposed to the converging fire of four relatively powerful batteries,  three about a mile away, the fourth nearly twice as far. At the northern  side of the harbor mouth stood Fort Moultrie; at the southern stood  the batteries on Cummings Point; and almost due west of Sumter stood  Fort Johnson. Near Moultrie was a four-gun floating battery with an  iron shield. A mile northwest of Moultrie, farther up the harbor,  stood the Mount Pleasant battery, nearly two miles off from Sumter.  At half-past four, in the first faint light of a gray morning,  a sudden spurt of flame shot out from Fort Johnson, the dull roar  of a mortar floated through the misty air, and the big shell--the  first shot of the real war--soared up at a steep angle, its course  distinctly marked by its burning fuse, and then plunged down on  Sumter. It was a capital shot, right on the center of the target,  and was followed by an admirable burst. Then all the converging  batteries opened full; while the whole population of perfervid  Charleston rushed out of doors to throng their beautiful East Battery,  a flagstone marine parade three miles in from Sumter, of which and  of the attacking batteries it had a perfect view.    But Sumter remained as silent as the grave. Anderson decided not to  return the fire till it was broad daylight. In the meantime all ranks  went to breakfast, which consisted entirely of water and salt pork.  Then the gun crews went to action stations and fired back steadily  with solid shot. The ironclad battery was an exasperating target;  for the shot bounced off it like dried peas. Moultrie seemed more  vulnerable. But appearances were deceptive; for it was thoroughly  quilted with bales of cotton, which the solid shot simply rammed  into an impenetrable mass. Wishing to save his men, in which he was  quite successful, Anderson had forbidden the use of the shell-guns,  which were mounted on the upper works and therefore more exposed.  Shell fire would have burst the bales and set the cotton flaming.  This was "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/26490"],[0,"Lord Milner's Work in South Africa (#2)"],[1,"to sanction the proposals of the commander, and, as  its own were impracticable, nothing was done. The Beechranger tribe  escaped with impunity, and the Hottentots, as a whole, were emboldened  to make fresh attacks upon the European settlers.    [Sidenote: The Afrikander stock.]    This simple narrative is a lantern that sheds a ray of light upon an  obscure subject. Two points are noticeable in the attitude of the home  authority. First, there is its inability to grasp the local  conditions; and second, the underlying assumption that a moral  judgment based upon the conditions of the home country, if valid, must  be equally valid in South Africa. By the time that the home authority  had become Downing Street instead of the peripatetic Chamber of  Seventeen, the field of mischievous action over which these  misconceptions operated had become enlarged. The natives were there,  as before; but, in addition to the natives, there had grown up a  population of European descent, some thirty thousand in number, whose  manner of life and standards of thought and conduct were scarcely more  intelligible to the British, or indeed to the European mind, than  those of the yellow-skinned Hottentot or the brown-skinned Kafir. A  century and a half of the Dutch East India Company's government--a  government \"in all things political purely despotic, in all things  commercial purely monopolist\"--had produced a people unlike any other  European community on the face of the earth. Of the small original  stock from which the South African Dutch are descended, one-quarter  were Huguenot refugees from France, an appreciable section were  German, and the institution of slavery had added to this admixture the  inevitable strain of non-Aryan blood. But this racial change was by no  means all that separated the European population in the Cape Colony  from the Dutch of Holland. A more potent agency had been at work. The  corner-stone of the policy of the Dutch East India Company was the  determination to debar the settlers from all intercourse--social,  intellectual, commercial, and political--with their kinsmen in Europe.  One fact will suffice to show how perfectly this object was attained.  Incredible as it may seem, it is the case that at the end of the  eighteenth century no printing-press was to be found in the Cape  Colony, nor had this community of twenty thousand Europeans the means  of knowing the nature of the laws and regulations of the Government by  which it was ruled. So long and complete an isolation from European  civilisation produced a result which is as remarkable in itself as it  is significant to the student of South African history. This  phenomenon was the existence, in the nineteenth century, of a  community of European blood whose moral and intellectual standards  were those of the seventeenth.    [Sidenote: The nationality difficulty.]    Our dip into the early history of South Africa is not purposeless. It  does not, of course, explain the failure of British administration;  but it brings us into touch with circumstances that were bound to make  the task of governing the Cape Colony--a task finally undertaken by  England in 1806--one of peculiar difficulty. The native population was  strange, but the European population was even more strange and  abnormal. If we had been left to deal with the native population alone  we should have experienced no serious difficulty in rendering them  harmless neighbours, and have been able to choose our own time for  entering upon the responsibilities involved in the administration of  their territories. But, coming second on the field, we were bound to  modify our native policy to suit the conditions of a preexisting  relationship between the white and black races that was not of our  creation, and one, moreover, that was in many respects repugnant to  British ideas of justice. Nor was this all. The old European  population, which should have been, naturally, our ally and  fellow-worker in the task of native administration, gradually changed  from its original position of a subject nationality to that of a  political rival; and, as such, openly bid against us for the  mastership of the native African tribes.    Now when two statesmen are pitted against each other, of whom one is a  man whose methods of attack are limited by nineteenth-century ideas,  while the morality of the other, being that of the seventeenth  century, permits him greater freedom of action, it is obvious that the  first will be at a disadvantage. And this would be the case more than  ever if the nineteenth-century statesman was under the impression that  his political antagonist was a man whose code of morals was identical  with his own. When once he had learnt that the moral standard of the  other was lower than, or different from, his own, he would of course  make allowance for the circumstance, and he would then be able to  contest the position with him upon equal terms. But until he had  grasped this fact he would be at a disadvantage.    Generally speaking, the representatives of the British Government,  both Governors and High Commissioners, soon learnt that neither the  natives nor the Dutch population could be dealt with on the same  footing as a Western European. But the British Government cannot be  said to have thoroughly learnt the same lesson until, in almost the  last week of the nineteenth century, the three successive defeats of  Stormberg, Magersfontein, and Colenso aroused it to a knowledge of the  fact that we had been within an ace of losing South Africa. Many,  indeed, would question whether even now the lesson had been thoroughly  learnt. But, however this may be, it is certain that throughout the  nineteenth century the Home Government wished to treat both the  natives and the Dutch in South Africa on a basis of British ideas; and  that by so doing it constantly found itself in conflict with its own  local representatives, who knew that the only hope of success lay in  dealing with both alike on a basis of South African ideas.    As the result of this chronic inability of British statesmen to  understand South Africa, it follows that the most instructive manner  of regarding our administration of that country during the nineteenth  century is to get a clear conception of the successive divergences of  opinion between the home and the local authorities.    At the very outset of British administration--during the temporary  occupation of the Cape from 1795 to 1808--we find a theoretically  perfect policy laid down for the guidance of the early English  Governors in their treatment of the Boers, or Dutch frontier farmers.  It is just as admirable, in its way, as were the instructions for the  treatment of the Hottentots furnished by the Directors of the Dutch  East India Company to Van Riebeck. In a despatch of July, 1800, the  third Duke of Portland, who was then acting as Secretary for the  Colonies, writes:    [Sidenote: Non-interference.]         \"Considering the tract of country over which these border       inhabitants are dispersed, the rude and uncultivated state in       which they live, and the wild notions of independence which       prevail among them, I am afraid any attempts to introduce       civilisation and a strict administration of justice will be slow       in their progress, and likely, if not proceeded upon with caution       and management, rather to create a spirit of resistance, or to       occasion them to emigrate still further from the seat of       government, than answer the beneficent views with which they       might be undertaken. In fact, it seems to me the proper system of       policy to observe to them is to interfere as little as possible       in their domestic concerns and interior economy; to consider them       rather as distant communities dependent upon the Government than       as subjects necessarily amenable to the laws and regulations       established within the precincts of Government. Mutual advantages       arising from barter and commerce, and a strict adherence to good       faith and justice in all arrangements with them, joined to       efficient protection and occasional acts of kindness on the part       of the Government, seem likely to be the best means of securing       their attachment.\"    Who would have thought that this statement of policy, admirable as it is  at first sight, contained in itself the germ of a political heresy of  the first magnitude? Yet so it was. The principle of non-interference,  here for the first time enunciated and subsequently followed with fatal  effect, could not be applied by a nineteenth-century administration to  the case of a seventeenth-century community without its virtually  renouncing the functions of government. Obviously this was not the  intention of the home authority. There remained the difficulty of  knowing when to apply, and when not to apply, the principle; and  directly a specific case arose there was the possibility that, while the  local authority, with a full knowledge of the local conditions, might  think interference necessary, the home authority, without such  knowledge, might take an opposite view.    [Sidenote: Slaghter's Nek.]    A very few years sufficed to show that the most ordinary exercise of  the functions of government might be regarded as an \"interference with  the domestic concerns and interior economy\" of the European subjects  of the British Crown in South Africa. At the time of the permanent  occupation of the Cape (1806) the population of the colony consisted  of three classes: 26,720 persons of European descent, 17,657  Hottentots, and 29,256 returned as slaves. One of the first measures  of the British Governor, Lord Caledon, was the enactment of a series  of regulations intended to confer civil rights on the Hottentots,  while at the same time preventing them from using their freedom at the  expense of the European population.
