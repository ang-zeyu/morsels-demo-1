When they rise to  sing, he rises; and when they sit, he lies down. One day, shortly before  my visit, a stranger-clergyman was preaching, and the sermon was longer  than usual. The dog grew tired and restless, and at last a thought  occurred to him, upon which he at once acted. He had observed that one  of the elder Indian boys was accustomed to hand round a plate for alms,  after which the service at once concluded. He evidently thought that if  he could persuade this boy to take up the collection, the sermon must  naturally end. He ran down to the back seat occupied by the boy, seated  himself in the aisle, and gazed steadfastly in the boy's face. Finding  that no notice was taken, he sat up and \"begged\" persistently for some  time, to Mr. Ashton's great amusement. Finally, as this also failed, the  dog put his nose under the lad's knee, and tried with all his strength  to force him out of his place, continuing this at intervals till the  sermon was concluded.    Did not this prove a distinct power of consecutive reasoning?              A. H. A.      A COMMERCIAL TREATY BETWEEN A DOG AND A HEN.              [_July 7, 1888._]    Your dog-loving readers may be interested in the following instance of  animal sagacity. Bob is a fine two-year-old mastiff, with head and face  of massive strength, heightened by great mildness of expression. One day  he was seen carrying a hen, very gently, in his mouth, to the kennel.  Placing her in one corner, he stood sentry while she laid an egg, which  he at once devoured. From that day the two have been fast friends, the  hen refusing to lay anywhere but in \"Bob's\" kennel, and getting her  reward in the dainty morsels from his platter. There must have been a  bit of canine reasoning here. \"Bob\" must have found eggs to his liking,  that they were laid by hens, and that he could best secure a supply by  having a hen to himself.              THOMAS HAMER.      A DOG NURSE.              [_Feb. 20, 1875._]    A patient recently consulted me who was blind and subject to fits. I  pointed out to her friends the danger to which she was exposed in case a  fit came on when she was in the vicinity of a fire, and they informed me  that she incurred little or no risk, because a favourite dog ran at once  and fetched assistance the moment a fit came on. This intelligent animal  would rush into the next house barking eagerly, would seize the dress of  the woman who lived there, and drag her to the assistance of his  mistress. If one did not go, he would seize another, and exhibited the  most lively symptoms of distress until his object was accomplished.              CHARLES BELL TAYLOR, M.D., F.R.C.S.      INSTINCT, OR REASON?              [_Sept. 1, 1888._]    The following incident in dog-life may perhaps find a place in the  _Spectator_. I quote from a letter received a few days ago from my  nephew, \"T. G. T.,\" resident in South Africa:--\"Johannesburg,  Traansvaal.--My dog Cherry has had three great pups, and I had to leave  her behind at the Grange. When I was going away, Cherry and the pups  were located in some stables. She came out and watched the tent-truck  and my things packed up. Presently I went away, and when I came back I  found Cherry had carried all the pups on to the top of my luggage, and  evidently had not the least intention of staying behind.\"              T. W. T.      HOSPITAL DOGS.              [_June 26, 1875._]    Dr. Walter F. Atlee writes to the editor of the _Philadelphia Medical  Times_:--    \"In a letter recently received from Lancaster, where my father resides,  it is said:--'A queer thing occurred just now. Father was in the office,  and heard a dog yelping outside the door; he paid no attention until a  second and louder yelp was heard, when he opened it, and found a little  brown dog standing on the step upon three legs. He brought him in, and  on examining the fourth leg, found a pin sticking in it. He drew out the  pin, and the dog ran away again.' The office of my father, Dr. Atlee, is  not directly on the street, but stands back, having in front of it some  six feet of stone wall with a gate. I will add, that it has not been  possible to discover anything more about this dog.    \"This story reminds me of something similar that occurred to me while  studying medicine in this same office nearly thirty years ago. A man,  named Cosgrove, the keeper of a low tavern near the railroad station,  had his arm broken, and came many times to the office to have the  dressings arranged. He was always accompanied by a large, most  ferocious-looking bull-dog, that watched me most attentively, and most  unpleasantly to me, while bandaging his master's arm. A few weeks after  Cosgrove's case was discharged, I heard a noise at the office door, as  if some animal was pawing it, and on opening it, saw there this huge  bull-dog, accompanied by another dog that held up one of its front legs,  evidently broken. They entered the office. I cut several pieces of wood,  and fastened them firmly to the leg with adhesive plaster, after  straightening the limb. They left immediately. The dog that came with  Cosgrove's dog I never saw before nor since.\"    Do not these stories adequately show that the dogs reasoned and drew new  inferences from a new experience?              B.                [_April 6, 1889._]    Knowing your interest in dogs, I venture to send you the following  story. A week or two ago, the porter of the Bristol Royal Infirmary was  disturbed one morning about 6.30 by the howling of a dog outside the  building. Finding that it continued, he went out and tried to drive it  away; but it returned and continued to howl so piteously, that he was  obliged to go out to it again. This time he observed that one of its  paws was injured. He therefore brought it in and sent for two nurses,  who at once dressed the paw, and were rewarded by every canine sign of  gratitude, including much licking of their hands. The patient was  \"retained\" for two days, during which time he received every attention  from those inside the house, and from the neighbours outside, who  quickly heard of the case. As no one appeared to claim the dog, he was  sent to the Home for Lost Dogs in the city, where so interesting an  animal was, of course, not long in finding a purchaser. The dog was one  of those called \"lurchers.\"    I have myself called on the porter of the infirmary for confirmation of  the story, and am assured by him of its truth. How did an apparently  friendless dog know where to go for surgical aid? The case differs from  that of the dog which took its friend for treatment to King's College  Hospital in London, for I understand that the King's College dog had  previously been taken to the hospital for treatment itself; but in this  case there is no such clue.              HELEN M. STURGE.      FEATURES IN THE CHARACTER OF A DOG.              [_June 10, 1876._]    For some time past I have noticed in your journal letters and articles  referring to the wonderful powers of dogs. As I was myself much struck  by many features in the character of a dog which I knew, illustrating,  as I think, not only affection, but reasoning faculties, I shall  acquaint you with a few of these, believing that they may be  _interesting_, at least to all admirers of that noble animal.    The dog of which I speak was a terrier. It showed its affection in the  most marked manner in several ways. Every morning, as soon as it got out  of the kitchen, it came to its master's door, and if not admitted and  caressed about the usual hour, gave evident signs of impatience. It  would lie quiet till it thought the time had arrived, but never longer.  Afterwards it went to the breakfast-room, and occupied its master's  chair till he arrived. On one occasion a visitor was in the house, who,  coming first into the room, ordered the dog to come off the best chair.  To this it paid no attention, and when threatened with expulsion, at  once prepared for defence. But as soon as its master appeared it  resigned its place voluntarily, and quietly stretched itself on the rug  at his feet.    At another time it was left for three weeks during its master's absence  from home. It saw him leave in a steamer, and every day until his return  it repaired to the quay upon the arrival of the same boat, expecting him  to come again in the one by which he had gone. It distinguished between  a number of boats, always selecting the right one and the right hour.    One evening it accompanied its master when he went to gather mussels for  bait. As the tide was far in, few mussels remained uncovered; and after  collecting all within reach, more were required. A large bunch lay a few  feet from the water's edge, but beyond reach; yet as the dog was not one  of those who take the water to fetch, its master had no expectation that  it would prove useful on the present occasion. Seeing him looking at  the mussels, however, it first took a good look at those in the basket,  and then, without being directed at all, went into the water. Selecting  the right bunch from amongst the stones and wreck with which it was  surrounded, it brought it to land, and laid it at its master's feet.  This, I think, is a proof of _reason_, rather than of instinct. The dog  had never been trained to go into the sea, and would not probably have  brought out the mussels had it not seen that they were wanted.    It showed wonderful instinct, however, just before the death of one of  its pups, and before its own death. Its pup had not been thriving, and  the mother gave unmistakable proof that she foresaw its death. She dug a  grave for it and put it in. Nor, when it was removed, would she let it  lie beside her, but immediately dug another grave, where she was less  likely to be disturbed. Upon the day of her own death, also, she used  what strength she had to dig her grave, in which she lay, preferring to  die in it, than in"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/31856"],[0,"Führer für Pilzfreunde (#2)"],[1,"             22    Schüppling, Stock-                       32    Schwärzlicher Bovist                     39    Schwefelkopf, Büschliger                 34    Schwindlinge                           8, 9    Semmelpilz                               36    Semmel-Porling                           36    Speise-Lorchel                            2    Speise-Morchel                            3    Spitzmorchel                              1    Stacheling, Habichts-                    35    Steinpilz (Herrenpilz)                   11    Stein-Röhrling                           11    Stock-Morchel                             2    Stock-Schüppling                         32    Stockschwämmchen                         32    Täublinge                            26, 27    Tannenpilz                               12    Trauben-Ziegenbart                        5    Wacholder-Milchling                      23    Wulstlinge                           19, 20    Ziegenbärte                      4, 5, 6, 7    Ziegenlippe                              16        B.

So alt, als es Menschen und Pilze gibt, ist wohl die Verwertung der  Pilze als Nahrungs- und Genußmittel. Früher wurden von unseren vielen  eßbaren Sorten nur hier und da einzelne als Volksnahrungsmittel benutzt,  obgleich sie sich in pilzreichen Jahren in ungeheurer Menge so mühe- und  kostenlos sammeln ließen, daß Tausende von armen Menschen vorzüglich  schmeckende und nährstoffreiche Mahlzeiten hätten haben können. In  neuerer Zeit hat die Verbreitung der Pilzkenntnisse durch Pilzbücher,  Schulunterricht und behördliche Hinweise erfreulich zugenommen und ist  in weiterem Fortschritte begriffen.    Über den Nährwert der Pilze hat die Ansicht in wissenschaftlichen Kreisen  sehr gewechselt. Einst wurde er besonders hoch eingeschätzt, weil die durch  chemische Untersuchungen gefundenen Stickstoffverbindungen als zum größten  Teil verdaulich angenommen wurden. Später wurde diese Ansicht als unrichtig  bestritten, weil ein beträchtlicher Teil der Stickstoffverbindungen  unlöslich sei. Diese Feststellungen gründeten sich indessen nicht auf  Verdauungsversuche beim Menschen selbst, sondern auf künstliche chemische  Verdauungsversuche im Laboratorium. Hierzu kommt, daß bis jetzt eine  einheitliche Art und Weise für die chemische Untersuchung der Pilze noch  nicht gefunden ist und deshalb die betreffenden Ergebnisse der Chemiker  sehr verschieden ausfallen. In dem Werke von Dr. _J. Zeller_, welches alle  Untersuchungen über die chemische Zusammensetzung der Pilze enthält, wird  auf Seite 218 darauf hingewiesen, wie wenig Wert den bisherigen  Untersuchungen nach der wissenschaftlichen Seite hin beizumessen sei. Diese  Behauptung wird begründet mit den zur Zeit noch nicht einheitlich  festgestellten Untersuchungsweisen, dem außerordentlich schwankenden  Wassergehalte der Pilze, dem verschiedenen Einflusse der  Ernährungsverhältnisse, der Mannigfaltigkeit der Bodenarten und anderen  Lebens- und Entwicklungsbedingungen. Aus diesen Gründen kann an dieser  Stelle von der Aufführung der Untersuchungstabellen bezüglich des  Eiweißgehaltes der Pilze Abstand genommen werden; es dürfte genügen, nur  die Durchschnittszahlen anzugeben. Nach Zeller sollen die Pilze im frischen  Zustande 2-3 Prozent, im trockenen 20-30 Prozent Proteinkörper  (Stickstoffverbindungen) enthalten, während die nicht proteinartigen  stickstoffhaltigen Körper etwa 5-20 Prozent betragen; ferner sind 60-80  Prozent der stickstoffhaltigen Bestandteile und 45-71 Prozent der  eigentlichen Eiweißkörper verdaulich.
