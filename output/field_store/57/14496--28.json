The landscape was dead. Nothing stirred. He could see for miles,  endless ash and slag, ruins of buildings. A few trees without leaves  or branches, only the trunks. Above him the eternal rolling clouds of  gray, drifting between Terra and the sun.    Major Hendricks went on. Off to the right something scuttled,  something round and metallic. A claw, going lickety-split after  something. Probably after a small animal, a rat. They got rats, too.  As a sort of sideline.    He came to the top of the little hill and lifted his fieldglasses. The  Russian lines were a few miles ahead of him. They had a forward  command post there. The runner had come from it.    A squat robot with undulating arms passed by him, its arms weaving  inquiringly. The robot went on its way, disappearing under some  debris. Hendricks watched it go. He had never seen that type before.  There were getting to be more and more types he had never seen, new  varieties and sizes coming up from the underground factories.    Hendricks put out his cigarette and hurried on. It was interesting,  the use of artificial forms in warfare. How had they got started?  Necessity. The Soviet Union had gained great initial success, usual  with the side that got the war going. Most of North America had been  blasted off the map. Retaliation was quick in coming, of course. The  sky was full of circling disc-bombers long before the war began; they  had been up there for years. The discs began sailing down all over  Russia within hours after Washington got it.           *       *       *       *       *    But that hadn't helped Washington.    The American bloc governments moved to the Moon Base the first year.  There was not much else to do. Europe was gone; a slag heap with dark  weeds growing from the ashes and bones. Most of North America was  useless; nothing could be planted, no one could live. A few million  people kept going up in Canada and down in South America. But during  the second year Soviet parachutists began to drop, a few at first,  then more and more. They wore the first really effective  anti-radiation equipment; what was left of American production moved  to the moon along with the governments.    All but the troops. The remaining troops stayed behind as best they  could, a few thousand here, a platoon there. No one knew exactly where  they were; they stayed where they could, moving around at night,  hiding in ruins, in sewers, cellars, with the rats and snakes. It  looked as if the Soviet Union had the war almost won. Except for a  handful of projectiles fired off from the moon daily, there was almost  no weapon in use against them. They came and went as they pleased. The  war, for all practical purposes, was over. Nothing effective opposed  them.           *       *       *       *       *    And then the first claws appeared. And overnight the complexion of the  war changed.    The claws were awkward, at first. Slow. The Ivans knocked them off  almost as fast as they crawled out of their underground tunnels. But  then they got better, faster and more cunning. Factories, all on  Terra, turned them out. Factories a long way under ground, behind the  Soviet lines, factories that had once made atomic projectiles, now  almost forgotten.    The claws got faster, and they got bigger. New types appeared, some  with feelers, some that flew. There were a few jumping kinds.    The best technicians on the moon were working on designs, making them  more and more intricate, more flexible. They became uncanny; the Ivans  were having a lot of trouble with them. Some of the little claws were  learning to hide themselves, burrowing down into the ash, lying in  wait.    And then they started getting into the Russian bunkers, slipping down  when the lids were raised for air and a look around. One claw inside a  bunker, a churning sphere of blades and metal--that was enough. And  when one got in others followed. With a weapon like that the war  couldn't go on much longer.    Maybe it was already over.    Maybe he was going to hear the news. Maybe the Politburo had decided  to throw in the sponge. Too bad it had taken so long. Six years. A  long time for war like that, the way they had waged it. The automatic  retaliation discs, spinning down all over Russia, hundreds of  thousands of them. Bacteria crystals. The Soviet guided missiles,  whistling through the air. The chain bombs. And now this, the robots,  the claws--    The claws weren't like other weapons. They were _alive_, from any  practical standpoint, whether the Governments wanted to admit it or  not. They were not machines. They were living things, spinning,  creeping, shaking themselves up suddenly from the gray ash and darting  toward a man, climbing up him, rushing for his throat. And that was  what they had been designed to do. Their job.    They did their job well. Especially lately, with the new designs  coming up. Now they repaired themselves. They were on their own.  Radiation tabs protected the UN troops, but if a man lost his tab he  was fair game for the claws, no matter what his uniform. Down below  the surface automatic machinery stamped them out. Human beings stayed  a long way off. It was too risky; nobody wanted to be around them.  They were left to themselves. And they seemed to be doing all right.  The new designs were faster, more complex. More efficient.    Apparently they had won the war.           *       *       *       *       *    Major Hendricks lit a second cigarette. The landscape depressed him.  Nothing but ash and ruins. He seemed to be alone, the only living  thing in the whole world. To the right the ruins of a town rose up, a  few walls and heaps of debris. He tossed the dead match away,  increasing his pace. Suddenly he stopped, jerking up his gun, his body  tense. For a minute it looked like--    From behind the shell of a ruined building a figure came, walking  slowly toward him, walking hesitantly.    Hendricks blinked. \"Stop!\"    The boy stopped. Hendricks lowered his gun. The boy stood silently,  looking at him. He was small, not very old. Perhaps eight. But it was  hard to tell. Most of the kids who remained were stunted. He wore a  faded blue sweater, ragged with dirt, and short pants. His hair was  long and matted. Brown hair. It hung over his face and around his  ears. He held something in his arms.    \"What's that you have?\" Hendricks said sharply.    The boy held it out. It was a toy, a bear. A teddy bear. The boy's  eyes were large, but without expression.    Hendricks relaxed. \"I don't want it. Keep it.\"    The boy hugged the bear again.    \"Where do you live?\" Hendricks said.    \"In there.\"    \"The ruins?\"    \"Yes.\"    \"Underground?\"    \"Yes.\"    \"How many are there?\"    \"How--how many?\"    \"How many of you. How big's your settlement?\"    The boy did not answer.    Hendricks frowned. \"You're not all by yourself, are you?\"    The boy nodded.    \"How do you stay alive?\"    \"There's food.\"    \"What kind of food?\"    \"Different.\"    Hendricks studied him. \"How old are you?\"    \"Thirteen.\"           *       *       *       *       *    It wasn't possible. Or was it? The boy was thin, stunted. And probably  sterile. Radiation exposure, years straight. No wonder he was so  small. His arms and legs were like pipecleaners, knobby, and thin.  Hendricks touched the boy's arm. His skin was dry and rough; radiation  skin. He bent down, looking into the boy's face. There was no  expression. Big eyes, big and dark.    \"Are you blind?\" Hendricks said.    \"No. I can see some.\"    \"How do you get away from the claws?\"    \"The claws?\"    \"The round things. That run and burrow.\"    \"I don't understand.\"    Maybe there weren't any claws around. A lot of areas were free. They  collected mostly around bunkers, where there were people. The claws  had been designed to sense warmth, warmth of living things.    \"You're lucky.\" Hendricks straightened up. \"Well? Which way are you  going? Back--back there?\"    \"Can I come with you?\"    \"With _me_?\" Hendricks folded his arms. \"I'm going a long way. Miles.  I have to hurry.\" He looked at his watch. \"I have to get there by  nightfall.\"    \"I want to come.\"    Hendricks fumbled in his pack. \"It isn't worth it. Here.\" He tossed  down the food cans he had with him. \"You take these and go back.  Okay?\"    The boy said nothing.    \"I'll be coming back this way. In a day or so. If you're around here  when I come back you can come along with me. All right?\"    \"I want to go with you now.\"    \"It's a long walk.\"    \"I can walk.\"    Hendricks shifted uneasily. It made too good a target, two people  walking along. And the boy would slow him down. But he might not come  back this way. And if the boy were really all alone--    \"Okay. Come along.\"           *       *       *       *       *    The boy fell in beside him. Hendricks strode along. The boy walked  silently, clutching his teddy bear.    \"What's your name?\" Hendricks said, after a time.    \"David Edward Derring.\"    \"David? What--what happened to your mother and father?\"    \"They died.\"    \"How?\"    \"In the blast.\"    \"How long ago?\"    \"Six years.\"    Hendricks slowed down. \"You've been alone six years?\"    \"No. There were other people for awhile. They went away.\"    \"And you've been alone since?\"    \"Yes.\"    Hendricks glanced down. The boy was strange, saying very little.  Withdrawn. But that was the way they were, the children who had  survived. Quiet. Stoic. A strange kind of fatalism gripped them.  Nothing came as a surprise. They accepted anything that came along.  There was no longer any _normal_, any natural course of things, moral  or physical, for them to expect. Custom, habit, all the determining  forces of learning were gone; only brute experience remained.    \"Am I walking too fast?\" Hendricks said.    \"No.\"    \"How did you happen to see me?\"    \"I was"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/32069"],[0,"Letters from a Cat (#2)"],[1,"  that I think my mother was frightened; for she said quickly:--    \"Never mind, dear; it shall not be done, unless it is necessary. You  would not want Pussy to live, if she were very uncomfortable all the  time.\"    \"She isn't uncomfortable,\" I cried; \"she is only sleepy. If people would  let her alone, she would sleep all day. It would be awful to kill her.  You might as well kill me!\"    After that, I kept a very close eye on Pussy; and I carried her up to  bed with me every night for a long time.    But Pussy's days were numbered. One morning, before I was up, my mamma  came into my room, and sat down on the edge of my bed.    \"Helen,\" she said, \"I have something to tell you which will make you  feel very badly; but I hope you will be a good little girl, and not make  mamma unhappy about it. You know your papa and mamma always do what they  think is the very best thing.\"    \"What is it, mamma?\" I asked, feeling very much frightened, but never  thinking of Pussy.    \"You will never see your Pussy any more,\" she replied. \"She is dead.\"    \"Oh, where is she?\" I cried. \"What killed her? Won't she come to life  again?\"    \"No,\" said my mother; \"she is drowned.\"    Then I knew what had happened.    \"Who did it?\" was all I said.    \"Cousin Josiah,\" she replied; \"and he took great care that Pussy did not  suffer at all. She sank to the bottom instantly.\"    \"Where did he drown her?\" I asked.    \"Down by the mill, in Mill Valley, where the water is very deep,\"  answered my mother; \"we told him to take her there.\"    At these words I cried bitterly.    \"That's the very place I used to go with her to play,\" I exclaimed.  \"I'll never go near that bridge as long as I live, and I'll never speak  a word to Cousin Josiah either--never!\"    My mother tried to comfort me, but it was of no use; my heart was nearly  broken.    When I went to breakfast, there sat my cousin Josiah, looking as  unconcerned as possible, reading a newspaper. He was a student in the  college, and boarded at our house. At the sight of him all my  indignation and grief broke forth afresh. I began to cry again; and  running up to him, I doubled up my fist and shook it in his face.    \"I said I'd never speak to you as long as I lived,\" I cried; \"but I  will. You're just a murderer, a real murderer; that's what you are! and  when you go to be a missionary, I hope the cannibals'll eat you! I hope  they'll eat you alive raw, you mean old murderer!\"    \"Helen Maria!\" said my father's voice behind me, sternly. \"Helen Maria!  leave the room this moment!\"    I went away sullenly, muttering, \"I don't care, he is a murderer; and I  hope he'll be drowned, if he isn't eaten! The Bible says the same  measure ye mete shall be meted to you again. He ought to be drowned.\"    For this sullen muttering I had to go without my breakfast; and after  breakfast was over, I was made to beg Cousin Josiah's pardon; but I did  not beg it in my heart--not a bit--only with my lips, just repeating the  words I was told to say; and from that time I never spoke one word to  him, nor looked at him, if I could help it.    My kind mother offered to get another kitten for me, but I did not want  one. After a while, my sister Ann had a present of a pretty little gray  kitten; but I never played with it, nor took any notice of it at all. I  was as true to my Pussy as she was to me; and from that day to this, I  have never had another Pussy!          I.      My Dear Helen:    That is what your mother calls you, I know, for I jumped up on  writing-table just now, and looked, while she was out of the room; and I  am sure I have as much right to call you so as she has, for if you were  my own little kitty, and looked just like me, I could not love you any  more than I do. How many good naps I have had in your lap! and how many  nice bits of meat you have saved for me out of your own dinner! Oh, I'll  never let a rat, or a mouse, touch any thing of yours so long as I live.    I felt very unhappy after you drove off yesterday, and did not know what  to do with myself. I went into the barn, and thought I would take a nap  on the hay, for I do think going to sleep is one of the very best things  for people who are unhappy; but it seemed so lonely without old Charlie  stamping in his stall that I could not bear it, so I went into the  garden, and lay down under the damask rose-bush, and caught flies. There  is a kind of fly round that bush which I like better than any other I  ever ate. You ought to see that there is a very great difference between  my catching flies and your doing it. I have noticed that you never eat  them, and I have wondered that when you were always so kind to me you  could be so cruel as to kill poor flies for nothing: I have often wished  that I could speak to you about it: now that your dear mother has taught  me to print, I shall be able to say a great many things to you which I  have often been unhappy about because I could not make you understand. I  am entirely discouraged about learning to speak the English language,  and I do not think anybody takes much trouble to learn ours; so we cats  are confined entirely to the society of each other, which prevents our  knowing so much as we might; and it is very lonely too, in a place where  there are so few cats kept as in Amherst. If it were not for Mrs.  Hitchcock's cat, and Judge Dickinson's, I should really forget how to  use my tongue. When you are at home I do not mind it, for although I  cannot talk to you, I understand every word that you say to me, and we  have such good plays together with the red ball. That is put away now in  the bottom drawer of the little workstand in the sitting-room. When your  mother put it in, she turned round to me, and said, \"Poor pussy, no more  good plays for you till Helen comes home!\" and I thought I should  certainly cry. But I think it is very foolish to cry over what cannot be  helped, so I pretended to have got something into my left eye, and  rubbed it with my paw. It is very seldom that I cry over any thing,  unless it is \"spilt milk.\" I must confess, I have often cried when that  has happened: and it always is happening to cats' milk. They put it into  old broken things that tip over at the least knock, and then they set  them just where they are sure to be most in the way. Many's the time  Josiah has knocked over that blue saucer of mine, in the shed, and when  you have thought that I had had a nice breakfast of milk, I had nothing  in the world but flies, which are not good for much more than just a  little sort of relish. I am so glad of a chance to tell you about this,  because I know when you come home you will get a better dish for me.    I hope you found the horse-chestnuts which I put in the bottom of the  carriage for you. I could not think of any thing else to put in, which  would remind you of me: but I am afraid you will never think that it was  I who put them there, and it will be too bad if you don't, for I had a  dreadful time climbing up over the dasher with them, and both my jaws  are quite lame from stretching them so, to carry the biggest ones I  could find.    There are three beautiful dandelions out on the terrace, but I don't  suppose they will keep till you come home. A man has been doing  something to your garden, but though I watched him very closely all the  time, I could not make out what he was about. I am afraid it is  something you will not like; but if I find out more about it, I will  tell you in my next letter. Good by.         Your affectionate Pussy.         [Illustration: \"I felt very unhappy after you drove off yesterday.\"       Page 28.]         [Illustration: \"I hope you found the horse-chestnuts which I put in       the carriage for you. I had a dreadful time climbing up over the       dasher with them.\"--Page 33.]          II.      My Dear Helen:    I do wish that you and your father would turn around directly, wherever  you are, when you get this letter, and come home as fast as you can. If  you do not come soon there will be no home left for you to come into. I  am so frightened and excited, that my paws tremble, and I have upset the  ink twice, and spilled so much that there is only a little left in the  bottom of the cup, and it is as thick as hasty pudding; so you must  excuse the looks of this letter, and I will tell you as quickly as I can  about the dreadful state of things here. Not more than an hour after I  finished my letter to you, yesterday, I heard a great noise in the  parlor, and ran in to see what was the matter. There was Mary with her  worst blue handkerchief tied over her head, her washing-day gown on, and  a big hammer in her hand. As soon as she saw me, she said, \"There's that  cat! Always in my way,\" and threw a cricket at me, and then shut the  parlor door with a great slam. So I ran out and listened under the  front windows, for I felt sure she was in some bad business she did not  want to have known. Such a noise I never heard: all the things were  being moved; and in a few minutes, what do you think--out came the whole  carpet right on my head! I was nearly stifled with dust, and felt as if  every bone in my body must be broken; but I managed to creep out from  under it, and heard Mary say, \"If there isn't that torment of a cat  again! I wish to goodness Helen had taken her along!\" Then I felt surer  than ever that some mischief was on foot: and ran out into the garden,  and climbed up the old apple-tree at the foot of the steps, and crawled  out on a branch, from which I could look directly into the parlor  windows. Oh! my dear Helen, you can fancy how I felt, to see all the  chairs and tables and bookshelves in a pile in the middle of the floor,  the books all packed in big baskets, and Mary taking out window after  window as fast as she could. I forgot to tell you that your mother went  away last night. I think she has gone to Hadley to make a visit, and it  looks to me very much as if Mary meant to run"]]]
