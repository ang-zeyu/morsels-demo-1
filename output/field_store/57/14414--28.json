Every one gave the credit of this remarkable  conduct to the Countess Mazzaras. Balfe had pianos carried up to the  sleeping rooms of great singers before they got out of bed, and thus  made them listen to his newly composed tunes. He sometimes announced  himself by the titles of his famous tunes, as, \"We May Be Happy Yet,\"  and was admitted, and received as readily as if he had resorted to  pasteboard politeness.    In short, Balfe was never a great musician, yet he had all the  eccentricities that one might expect a great musician to have, and he  succeeded quite as well as if he had had genius.

First sung at London, England, Her Majesty's Theatre, Drury Lane, Nov.  27, 1843.      ACT I    Many years ago, when noblemen, warriors, gipsies, lovers, enemies and  all sorts and conditions of men fraternized without drawing very fine  distinctions except when it came to levying taxes, a company of rich  nobles met in the gardens of the Count Arnheim to go hunting together.  The Count was the Governor of Presburg, and a very popular man, except  with his inferiors.    They began their day's sport with a rather highfalutin song sung by  the Count's retainers:         \"Up with the banner and down with the slave,         Who shall dare dispute the right,       Wherever its folds in their glory wave,         Of the Austrian eagle's flight?\"    The verses were rather more emotional than intelligent, but the  singers were all in good spirits and prepared for a fine day's sport.    After this preliminary all the party--among whom was the young  daughter of the Count, whose name was Arline, and a girlie sort of  chap, Florestein, who was the Count's nephew--came from the castle,  with huntsmen and pages in their train; and what with pages running  about, and the huntsmen's bright colours, and the horns echoing, and  the horses that one must feel were just without, stamping with  impatience to be off, it was a gay scene. The old Count was in such  high feather that he, too, broke into song and, while singing that         \"Bugles shake the air,\"    he caught up his little daughter in his arms and told how dear she was  to him. It was not a proper thing for so young a girl to go on a hunt,  but Arline was a spoiled young countess. When a huntsman handed a  rifle to Florestein, that young man shuddered and rejected it--which  left one to wonder just what he was going to do at a hunt without a  rifle, but the others were less timid, and all separated to go to  their various posts, Arline going by a foot-path in charge of a  retainer.    These gay people had no sooner disappeared than a handsome young  fellow, dishevelled, pursued, rushed into the garden. He looked  fearfully behind him, and stopped to get his breath.    \"I can run no farther,\" he gasped, looking back upon the road he had  come; and then suddenly at his side, he saw a statue of the Austrian  Emperor. He was even leaning against it.    \"Here I am, in the very midst of my foes!--a statue of the Emperor  himself adorning these grounds!\" and he became even more alarmed.  While he stood thus, hesitating what to do next, a dozen dusky forms  leaped the wall of the garden and stood looking at him. Thaddeus was  in a soldier's dress and looked like a soldier. Foremost among the  newcomers, who huddled together in brilliant rags, was a great  brigand-looking fellow, who seemed to lead the band.    \"Hold on! before we undertake to rob this chap, let us make sure of  what we are doing,\" he cautioned the others. \"If he is a soldier, we  are likely to get the worst of it\"--showing that he had as much wisdom  as bravado. After a moment's hesitation they decided that caution was  the better part of valour, and since it was no harm to be a gipsy, and  there was a penalty attached to being a robber, they nonchalantly  turned suspicion from themselves by beginning to sing gaily of their  gipsy life. Frequently when they had done this, they had received  money for it. If they mayn't rob this soldier chap, at least he might  be generous and toss them a coin. During this time, Thaddeus was not  napping. The Austrian soldiery were after him, and at best he could  not expect to be safe long. The sight of the vagabonds inspired him  with hope, although to most folks they would have seemed to be a  rather uninspiring and hopeless lot. He went up to the leader,  Devilshoof:    \"My friend, I have something to say to you. I am in danger. You seem  to be a decent sort--gay and friendly enough. The Austrian soldiers  are after me. I am an exile from Poland. If I am caught, my life will  be forfeited. I am young and you may count upon my good will. If you  will take me along with you as one of you, I may stand a chance of  escaping with my life--what do you say?\"    The gipsies stared at him; and Devilshoof did so in no unfriendly  manner. The leader was a good-natured wanderer, whose main fault was  stealing--but that was a fault he shared in common with all gipsies.  He was quite capable of being a good friend.    \"Just who are you?\" he asked, wanting a little more information.    \"A man without country, friends, hope--or money.\"    \"Well, you seem able to qualify as a gipsy pretty well. So come  along.\" Just as he spoke, another gipsy, who was reconnoitering, said  softly:    \"Soldiers are coming----\"    \"Good--we'll give them something to do. Here, friend, we'll get ready  for them,\" he cried, delighted with the new adventure.    At that the gipsies fell to stripping off Thaddeus's soldier clothes,  and exchanging them for a gipsy's smock; but as this was taking place,  a roll of parchment fell at Devilshoof's feet.    \"What's this?\" he asked, taking it up.    \"It is my commission as a soldier of Poland--the only thing I have of  value in the world. I shall never part with it,\" and Thaddeus snatched  it and hid it in his dress and then mixed with the gipsies just as the  Emperor's soldiers came up.    \"Ho, there! You vagabonds--have you seen anything of a stranger who  has passed this way?\"    \"What--a Polish soldier?\"    \"That's our man.\"    \"Young?\"    \"Yes, yes--where did he go?\"    \"A handsome fellow?\"    \"Have done there, and answer--where did he go?\"    \"I guess that may be the one?\" Devilshoof reflected, consulting his  comrades with a deliberation which made the officer wish to run his  sword through him.    \"Speak up--or----\"    \"Yes, yes--that's right--we have the right man! Up those rocks there,\"  pointing. \"That is the way he went. I shouldn't wonder if you might  catch him.\"    The officer didn't wait to hear any more of this elaborate  instruction, but rushed away with his men.    \"Now, comrade,\" Devilshoof said to Thaddeus: \"It is time for us to be  off, while our soldier friends are enjoying the hunt. Only you lie  around here while we explore a little; this gipsy life means a deal of  wear and tear, if a fellow would live. There is likely to be something  worth picking up about the castle, and after we have done the picking,  we'll all be off.\"    As the gipsies and Thaddeus went away, the huntsmen rushed on,  shouting to each other, and sounding their horns. Florestein came  along in their wake. He was about the last man on earth to go on a  hunt. He made this known without any help, by singing:         Is no succour near at hand?         For my intellect so reels,       I am doubtful if I stand         On my head or on my heels.       No gentleman, it's very clear,         Such a shock should ever know,       And when once I become a peer,       They shall not treat me so----    That seemed to suggest that something serious had happened, but no one  knew what till Thaddeus and a crowd of peasants rushed wildly in.    \"The Count's child, Arline, is attacked by an infuriated animal, and  we fear she is killed,\"--that is what Florestein had been bemoaning,  instead of hurrying to the rescue! The Count Arnheim ran in then,  distraught with horror. But Thaddeus had not remained idle; he had  rushed after the huntsmen. Presently he hurried back, bearing the  child in his arms. The retainer whose business it was to care for  Arline fell at the Count's feet.    \"Oh, great sir, just as we were entering the forest a wild deer rushed  at us, and only for the bravery of this young gipsy,\"--indicating  Thaddeus--\"the child would have been torn in pieces. As it is, she is  wounded in the arm.\"    The Count took his beloved daughter in his arms.    \"Her life is safe and the wound is not serious, thank God. Take her  within and give her every care. And you, young man--you will remain  with us and share our festivities--and ask of me anything that you  will: I can never repay this service.\"    \"Humph! Thaddeus is a fool,\" Devilshoof muttered. \"First he served his  enemy and now has to stand his enemy's thanks.\"    Thaddeus refused at first to remain, but when his refusal seemed to  draw too much attention to the gipsy band, he consented, as a matter  of discretion. So they all seated themselves at the table which had  been laid in the garden, and while they were banqueting, the gipsies  and peasants danced to add to the sport; and little Arline could be  seen in the nurse's arms, at a window of the castle,"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/2872"],[0,"The Variation of Animals and Plants under Domestication — Volume 2 (#2)"],[1,"TIES--BETWEEN THE SKIN AND  DERMAL APPENDAGES--BETWEEN THE ORGANS OF SIGHT AND HEARING--CORRELATED  MODIFICATIONS IN THE ORGANS OF PLANTS--CORRELATED MONSTROSITIES--CORRELATION  BETWEEN THE SKULL AND EARS--SKULL AND CREST OF FEATHERS--SKULL AND HORNS--  CORRELATION OF GROWTH COMPLICATED BY THE ACCUMULATED EFFECTS OF NATURAL  SELECTION--COLOUR AS CORRELATED WITH CONSTITUTIONAL PECULIARITIES.

PELORIC FLOWERS DUE IN SOME CASES TO REVERSION.    The great principle of inheritance to be discussed in this chapter has been  recognised by agriculturists and authors of various nations, as shown by the  scientific term ATAVISM, derived from atavus, an ancestor; by the English  terms of REVERSION, or THROWING-BACK; by the French PAS-EN-ARRIERE; and by the  German RUCKSCHLAG, or RUCKSCHRITT. When the child resembles either grandparent  more closely than its immediate parents, our attention is not much arrested,  though in truth the fact is highly remarkable; but when the child resembles  some remote ancestor or some distant member in a collateral line,--and in the  last case we must attribute this to the descent of all the members from a  common progenitor,--we feel a just degree of astonishment. When one parent  alone displays some newly-acquired and generally inheritable character, and  the offspring do not inherit it, the cause may lie in the other parent having  the power of prepotent transmission. But when both parents are similarly  characterised, and the child does not, whatever the cause may be, inherit the  character in question, but resembles its grandparents, we have one of the  simplest cases of reversion. We continually see another and even more simple  case of atavism, though not generally included under this head, namely, when  the son more closely resembles his maternal than his paternal grand-sire in  some male attribute, as in any peculiarity in the beard of man, the horns of  the bull, the hackles or comb of the cock, or, as in certain diseases  necessarily confined to the male sex; for as the mother cannot possess or  exhibit such male attributes, the child must inherit them, through her blood,  from his maternal grandsire.    The cases of reversion may be divided into two main classes which, however, in  some instances, blend into one another; namely, first, those occurring in a  variety or race which has not been crossed, but has lost by variation some  character that it formerly possessed, and which afterwards reappears. The  second class includes all cases in which an individual with some  distinguishable character, a race, or species, has at some former period been  crossed, and a character derived from this cross, after having disappeared  during one or several generations, suddenly reappears. A third class,  differing only in the manner of reproduction, might be formed to include all  cases of reversion effected by means of buds, and therefore independent of  true or seminal generation. Perhaps even a fourth class might be instituted,  to include reversions by segments in the same individual flower or fruit, and  in different parts of the body in the same individual animal as it grows old.  But the two first main classes will be sufficient for our purpose.    REVERSION TO LOST CHARACTERS BY PURE OR UNCROSSED FORMS.    Striking instances of this first class of cases were given in the sixth  chapter, namely, of the occasional reappearance, in variously-coloured breeds  of the pigeon, of blue birds with all the marks characteristic of the wild  Columba livia. Similar cases were given in the case of the fowl. With the  common ass, as the legs of the wild progenitor are almost always striped, we  may feel assured that the occasional appearance of such stripes in the  domestic animal is a case of simple reversion. But I shall be compelled to  refer again to these cases, and therefore here pass them over.    The aboriginal species from which our domesticated cattle and sheep are  descended, no doubt possessed horns; but several hornless breeds are now well  established. Yet in these--for instance, in Southdown sheep--\"it is not  unusual to find among the male lambs some with small horns.\" The horns, which  thus occasionally reappear in other polled breeds, either \"grow to the full  size,\" or are curiously attached to the skin alone and hang \"loosely down, or  drop off.\" (13/1. 'Youatt on Sheep' pages 20, 234. The same fact of loose  horns occasionally appearing in hornless breeds has been observed in Germany;  Bechstein 'Naturgesch. Deutschlands.' b. 1 s. 362.) The Galloways and Suffolk  cattle have been hornless for the last 100 or 150 years, but a horned calf,  with the horn often loosely attached, is occasionally produced. (13/2. 'Youatt  on Cattle' pages 155, 174.)    There is reason to believe that sheep in their early domesticated condition  were \"brown or dingy black;\" but even in the time of David certain flocks were  spoken of as white as snow. During the classical period the sheep of Spain are  described by several ancient authors as being black, red, or tawny. (13/3.  'Youatt on Sheep' 1838 pages 17, 145.) At the present day, notwithstanding the  great care which is taken to prevent it, particoloured lambs and some entirely  black are occasionally, or even frequently, dropped by our most highly  improved and valued breeds, such as the Southdowns. Since the time of the  famous Bakewell, during the last century, the Leicester sheep have been bred  with the most scrupulous care; yet occasionally grey-faced, or black-spotted,  or wholly black lambs appear. (13/4. I have been informed of this fact through  the Rev. W.D. Fox on the excellent authority of Mr. Wilmot: see also remarks  on this subject in an article in the 'Quarterly Review' 1849 page 395.) This  occurs still more frequently with the less improved breeds, such as the  Norfolks. (13/5. Youatt pages 19, 234.) As bearing on this tendency in sheep  to revert to dark colours, I may state (though in doing so I trench on the  reversion of crossed breeds, and likewise on the subject of prepotency) that  the Rev. W.D. Fox was informed that seven white Southdown ewes were put to a  so-called Spanish ram, which had two small black spots on his sides, and they  produced thirteen lambs, all perfectly black. Mr. Fox believes that this ram  belonged to a breed which he has himself kept, and which is always spotted  with black and white; and he finds that Leicester sheep crossed by rams of  this breed always produce black lambs: he has gone on recrossing these crossed  sheep with pure white Leicesters during three successive generations, but  always with the same result. Mr. Fox was also told by the friend from whom the  spotted breed was procured, that he likewise had gone on for six or seven  generations crossing with white sheep, but still black lambs were invariably  produced.    Similar facts could be given with respect to tailless breeds of various  animals. For instance, Mr. Hewitt (13/6. 'The Poultry Book' by Mr. Tegetmeier  1866 page 231.) states that chickens bred from some rumpless fowls, which were  reckoned so good that they won a prize at an exhibition, \"in a considerable  number of instances were furnished with fully developed tail-feathers.\" On  inquiry, the original breeder of these fowls stated that, from the time when  he had first kept them, they had often produced fowls furnished with tails;  but that these latter would again reproduce rumpless chickens.    Analogous cases of reversion occur in the vegetable kingdom; thus \"from seeds  gathered from the finest cultivated varieties of Heartsease (Viola tricolor),  plants perfectly wild both in their foliage and their flowers are frequently  produced;\" (13/7. Loudon's 'Gardener's Mag.' volume 10 1834 page 396: a  nurseryman, with"]]]
