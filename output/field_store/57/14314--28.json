Unless he exercises a wise discrimination  and has some system of selection, he becomes lost in the mazes of as  enchanted a land,        \"Where Truth and Dream walk hand in hand,\"[1]    as ever bewildered knights of old in days of romance. Down all the  dimly lighted pathways of mediaeval literature mystical figures beckon  him in every direction; fairies, goblins, witches, knights and ladies  and giants entice him, and unless, like Theseus of old, he follows  closely his guiding clue, he will find that he reaches no goal,  attains to no clear vision, achieves no quest. He will remain  spell-bound, captivated by the Middle Ages--        \"The life, the delight, and the sorrow      Of troublous and chivalrous years      That knew not of night nor of morrow,      Of hopes or of fears.      The wars and the woes and the glories      That quicken, and lighten, and rain      From the clouds of its chronicled stories      The passion, the pride, and the pain.\"[2]    Such a golden clue to guide the modern seeker through the labyrinths  of the mediaeval mind is that which I have tried to suggest in the  title \"_Hero_-Myths and Legends of the British Race\"--the pursuit and  representation of the ideal hero as the mind of Britain and of early  and mediaeval England imagined him, together with the study of the  characteristics which made this or that particular person, mythical or  legendary, a hero to the century which sang or wrote about him. The  interest goes deeper when we study, not merely        \"Old heroes who could grandly do      As they could greatly dare,\"[3]    but        \"Heroes of our island breed      And men and women of our British birth.\"[4]    \"Hero-worship endures for ever while man endures,\" wrote Thomas  Carlyle, and this fidelity of men to their admiration for great heroes  is one of the surest tokens by which we can judge of their own  character. Such as the hero is, such will his worshippers be; and the  men who idolised Robin Hood will be found to have been men who were  themselves in revolt against oppressive law, or who, finding law  powerless to prevent tyranny, glorified the lawless punishment of  wrongs and the bold denunciation of perverted justice. The warriors  who listened to the saga of Beowulf looked on physical prowess as the  best of all heroic qualities, and the Normans who admired Roland saw  in him the ideal of feudal loyalty. To every age, and to every nation,  there is a peculiar ideal of heroism, and in the popular legends of  each age this ideal may be found.    Again, these legends give not only the hero as he seemed to his age;  they also show the social life, the virtues and vices, the  superstitions and beliefs, of earlier ages embedded in the tradition,  as fossils are found in the uplifted strata of some ancient ocean-bed.  They have ceased to live; but they remain, tokens of a life long past.  So in the hero-legends of our nation we may find traces of the  thoughts and religions of our ancestors many centuries ago; traces  which lie close to one another in these romances, telling of the  nations who came to these Islands of the West, settled, were conquered  and driven away to make room for other races whose supremacy has been  as brief, till all these superimposed races have blended into one, to  form the British nation, the most widespread race of modern times. For        \"Britain's might and Britain's right      And the brunt of British spears\"[5]    are not the boast of the English race alone. No man in England now can  boast of unmixed descent, but must perforce trace his family back  through many a marriage of Frank, and Norman, and Saxon, and Dane, and  Roman, and Celt, and even Iberian, back to prehistoric man--        \"Scot and Celt and Norman and Dane,      With the Northman's sinew and heart and brain,      And the Northman's courage for blessing or bane,      Are England's heroes too.\"[6]    When Tennyson sang his greeting at the coming of Alexandra,        \"Saxon or Dane or Norman we,      Teuton or Celt or whatever we be,\"    he was only recognising a truth which no boast of pure birth can  cover--the truth that the modern Englishman is a compound of many  races, with many characteristics; and if we would understand him, we  must seek the clue to the riddle in early England and Scotland and  Ireland and Wales, while even France adds her share of enlightenment  towards the solution of the riddle.        \"The Saxon force, the Celtic fire,      These are thy manhood's heritage.\"[7]    Britain, as far as we can trace men in our island, was first inhabited  by cave-men, who have left no history at all. In the course of ages  they passed away before the Iberians or Ivernians, who came from the  east, and bore a striking resemblance to the Basques. It may be that  some Mongolian tribe, wandering west, drawn by the instinct which has  driven most race-migrations westward, sent offshoots north and  south--one to brave the dangers of the sea and inhabit Britain and  Ireland, one to cross the Pyrenees and remain sheltered in their deep  ravines; or it may be that Basques from the Pyrenees, daring the  storms of the Bay of Biscay in their frail coracles, ventured to the  shores of Britain. Short and dark were these sturdy voyagers,  harsh-featured and long-headed, worshipping the powers of Nature with  mysterious and cruel rites of human sacrifice, holding beliefs in  totems and ancestor-worship and in the superiority of high descent  claimed through the mother to that claimed through the father. When  the stronger and more civilised Celt came he drove before him these  little dark men, he enslaved their survivors or wedded their women,  and in his turn fell into slavery to the cruel Druidic religion of his  subjects. To these Iberians, and to the Celtic dread of them, we  probably owe all the stories of dwarfs, goblins, elves, and  earth-gnomes which fill our fairy-tale books; and if we examine  carefully the descriptions of the abodes of these beings we shall find  them not inconsistent with the earth-dwellings, caves, circle huts, or  even with the burial mounds, of the Iberian race.    The race that followed the Iberians, and drove them out or subdued  them, so that they served as slaves where they had once ruled as  lords, was the proud Aryan Celtic race. Of different tribes, Gaels,  Brythons, and Belgae, they were all one in spirit, and one in physical  feature.    Tall, blue-eyed, with fair or red hair, they overpowered in every way  the diminutive Iberians, and their tattooing, while it gave them a  name which has often been mistaken for a national designation (Picts,  or painted men), made them dreadful to their enemies in battle, and  ferocious-looking even in time of peace. Their civilisation was of a  much higher type than that of the Iberians; their weapons, their  war-chariots, their mode of life and their treatment of women, are all  so closely similar to that of the Greeks of Homer that a theory has  been advanced and ably defended, that the Homeric Greeks were really  invading Celts--Gaelic or Gaulish tribes from the north of Europe. If  it indeed be so, we owe to the Celts a debt of imperishable culture  and civilisation. To them belongs more especially, in our national  amalgam, the passion for the past, the ardent patriotism, the longing  for spiritual beauty, which raises and relieves the Saxon materialism.        \"Though fallen the state of Erin and changed the Scottish land,      Though small the power of Mona, though unwaked Llewellyn's band,      Though Ambrose Merlin's prophecies are held as idle tales,      Though Iona's ruined cloisters are swept by northern gales,                      One in name and in fame                      Are the sea-divided Gaels.        \"In Northern Spain and Italy our brethren also dwell,      And brave are the traditions of their fathers that they tell;      The Eagle or the Crescent in the dawn of history pales      Before the advancing banners of the great Rome-conquering Gaels:                      One in name and in fame                      Are the sea-divided Gaels.\"[8]    It is almost impossible to overestimate the value of the Celtic  contribution to our national literature and character: the race that  gave us Ossian, and Finn, and Cuchulain, that sang of the sorrowful  love and doom of Deirdre, that told of the pursuit of Diarmit and  Grania, till every dolmen and cromlech in Ireland was associated with  these lovers; the race that preserved for us        \"That grey king whose name, a ghost,      Streams like a cloud, man-shaped, from mountain-peak      And cleaves to cairn and cromlech still,\"[9]    the King Arthur whose Arthur's Seat overhangs Edinburgh, whose  presence haunts the Lakes, and Wales, and Cornwall, and the forests of  Brittany; the race that held up for us the image of the Holy  Grail--t"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/25529"],[0,"The Adventures of Danny Meadow Mouse (#2)"],[1,"nds, but Danny always  keeps his eyes open when they are around and always begins to  play hide-and-seek. Peter Rabbit and Jimmy Skunk and Striped  Chipmunk and Happy Jack Squirrel are all friends whom he can  trust, but he always has a bright twinkling eye open for Reddy  Fox and Billy Mink and Shadow the Weasel and old Whitetail the  Marsh Hawk, and several more, especially Hooty the Owl at night.    Now Danny Meadow Mouse is a stouthearted little fellow, and when  rough Brother North Wind came shouting across the Green Meadows,  tearing to pieces the snow clouds and shaking out the snowflakes  until they covered the Green Meadows deep, deep, deep, Danny just  snuggled down in his warm coat in his snug little house of grass  and waited. Danny liked the snow. Yes, Sir, Danny Meadow Mouse  liked the snow. He just loved to dig in it and make tunnels.  Through those tunnels in every direction he could go where he  pleased and when he pleased without being seen by anybody. It was  great fun!    Every little way he made a little round doorway up beside a stiff  stalk of grass. Out of this he could peep at the white world,  and he could get the fresh, cold air. Sometimes, when he was  quite sure that no one was around, he would scamper across on top  of the snow from one doorway to another, and when he did this, he  made the prettiest little footprints.    Now Reddy Fox knew all about those doorways and who made them.  Reddy was having hard work to get enough to eat this cold  weather, and he was hungry most of the time. One morning, as he  came tiptoeing softly over the meadows, what should he see just  ahead of him but the head of Danny Meadow Mouse pop out of one  of those little round doorways! Reddy's mouth watered, and he  stole forward more softly than ever. When he got within jumping  distance, he drew his stout hind legs under him and made ready to  spring. Presto! Danny Meadow Mouse had disappeared! Reddy Fox  jumped just the same and began to dig as fast as he could make  his paws go. He could smell Danny Meadow Mouse and that made him  almost frantic.    All the time Danny Meadow Mouse was scurrying along one of his  little tunnels, and when finally Reddy Fox stopped digging  because he was quite out of breath, Danny popped his head out of  another little doorway and laughed at Reddy. Of course Reddy saw  him, and of course Reddy tried to catch him there, and dug  frantically just as before. And of course Danny Meadow Mouse  wasn't there.    [Illustration: _Danny popped his head out of another little  doorway and laughed at Reddy_]    After a while Reddy Fox grew tired of this kind of a game and  tried another plan. The next time he saw Danny Meadow Mouse stick  his head out, Reddy pretended not to see him. He stretched  himself out on the ground and made believe that he was very  tired and sleepy. He closed his eyes. Then he opened them just  the tiniest bit, so that he could see Danny Meadow Mouse and yet  seem to be asleep. Danny watched him for a long time. Then he  chuckled to himself and dropped out of sight.    No sooner was he gone than Reddy Fox stole over close to the  little doorway and waited. \"He'll surely stick his head out again  to see if I'm asleep, and then I'll have him,\" said Reddy to  himself. So he waited and waited and waited. By and by he turned  his head. There was Danny Meadow Mouse at another little doorway,  laughing at him!                                       IV             Old Granny Fox Tries for Danny Meadow Mouse      Danny Meadow Mouse had not enjoyed anything so much for a long  time as he did that game of hide-and-seek. He tickled and  chuckled all the afternoon as he thought about it. Of course,  Reddy had been \"it.\" He had been \"it\" all the time, for never  once had he caught Danny Meadow Mouse. If he had--well, there  wouldn't have been any more stories about Danny Meadow Mouse,  because there wouldn't have been any Danny Meadow Mouse any more.    But Danny never let himself think about this. He had enjoyed the  game all the more because it had been such a dangerous game. It  had been such fun to dive into one of his little round doorways  in the snow, run along one of his own little tunnels, and then  peep out at another doorway and watch Reddy Fox digging as fast  as ever he could at the doorway Danny had just left. Finally  Reddy had given up in disgust and gone off muttering angrily to  try to find something else for dinner. Danny had sat up on the  snow and watched him go. In his funny little squeaky voice Danny  shouted:        \"_Though Reddy Fox is smart and sly,          Hi-hum-diddle-de-o!      I'm just as smart and twice as spry.          Hi-hum-diddle-de-o!_\"    That night Reddy Fox told old Granny Fox all about how he had  tried to catch Danny Meadow Mouse. Granny listened with her head  cocked on one side. When Reddy told how fat Danny Meadow Mouse  was, her mouth watered. You see, now that snow covered the Green  Meadows and the Green Forest, Granny and Reddy Fox had hard work  to get enough to eat, and they were hungry most of the time.    \"I'll go with you down on the meadows tomorrow morning, and then  we'll see if Danny Meadow Mouse is as smart as he thinks he is,\"  said Granny Fox.    So, bright and early the next morning, old Granny Fox and Reddy  Fox went down on the meadows where Danny Meadow Mouse lives.  Danny had felt in his bones that Reddy would come back, so he was  watching, and he saw them as soon as they came out of the Green  Forest. When he saw old Granny Fox, Danny's heart beat a little  faster than before, for he knew that Granny Fox is very smart and  very wise, and has learned most of the tricks of all the other  little meadow and forest people.    \"This is going to be a more exciting game than the other,\" said  Danny to himself, and scurried down out of sight to see that all  his little tunnels were clear so that he could run fast through  them if he had to. Then he peeped out of one of his little  doorways hidden in a clump of tall grass.    Old Granny Fox set Reddy to hunting for Danny's little round  doorways, and as fast as he found them, Granny came up and  sniffed at each. She knew that she could tell by the smell which  one he had been at last. Finally she came straight toward the  tall bunch of grass. Danny ducked down and scurried along one of  his little tunnels. He heard Granny Fox sniff at the doorway he  had just left. Suddenly something plunged down through the snow  right at his very heels. Danny didn't have to look to know that  it was Granny Fox herself, and he squeaked with fright.                                        V                 What Happened on the Green Meadows      Thick and fast, things were happening to Danny Meadow Mouse down  on the snow-covered Green Meadows. Rather, they were almost  happening. He hadn't minded when Reddy Fox all alone tried to  catch him. Indeed, he had made a regular game of hide-and-seek of  it and had enjoyed it immensely. But now it was different.  Granny Fox wasn't so easily fooled as Reddy Fox. Just Granny  alone would have made the game dangerous for Danny Meadow Mouse.  But Reddy was with her, and so Danny had two to look out for, and  he got so many frights that it seemed to him as if his heart had  moved right up into his mouth and was going to stay there. Yes,  Sir, that is just how it seemed.    Down in his little tunnels underneath the snow Danny Meadow Mouse  felt perfectly safe from Reddy Fox, who would stop and dig  frantically at the little round doorway where he had last seen  Danny. But old Granny Fox knew all about those little tunnels,  and she didn't waste any time digging at the doorways. Instead  she cocked her sharp little ears and listened with all her might.  Now Granny Fox has very keen ears, oh, very keen ears, and she  heard just what she hoped she would hear. She heard Danny Meadow  Mouse running along one of his little tunnels under the snow.    Plunge! Old Granny Fox dived right into the snow and right  through into the tunnel of Danny Meadow Mouse. Her two black  paws actually touched Danny's tail. He was glad then that it was  no longer.    \"Ha!\" cried Granny Fox, \"I almost got him that time!\"    Then she ran ahead a little way over the snow, listening as  before. Plunge! Into the snow she went again. It was lucky for  him that Danny had just turned into another tunnel, for otherwise  she would surely have caught him.    Granny Fox blew the snow out of her nose. \"Next time I'll get  him!\" said she.    Now Reddy Fox is quick to learn, especially when it is a way to  get something to eat. He watched Granny Fox, and when he  understood what she was doing, he made up his mind to have a try  himself, for he was afraid that if she caught Danny Meadow Mouse,  she would think that he was not big enough to divide. Perhaps  that was because Reddy is very selfish himself. So the next time  Granny plunged into the snow and missed Danny Meadow Mouse just  as before, Reddy rushed in ahead of her, and the minute he heard  Danny running down below, he plunged in just as he had seen  Granny do. But he didn't take the pains to make sure of just  where Danny was, and so of course he didn't come anywhere near  him. But he frightened Danny still more and made old Granny Fox  lose her temper.    Poor Danny Meadow Mouse! He had never been so frightened in all  his life. He didn't know which way to turn or where to run. And  so he sat still, which, although he didn't know it, was the very  best thing he could do. When he sat still he made no noise, and  so of course Granny and Reddy Fox could not tell where he was.  Old Granny Fox sat and listened and listened and listened, and  wondered where Danny Meadow Mouse was. And down under the snow  Danny Meadow Mouse sat and listened and listened and listened,  and wondered where Granny and Reddy Fox were.    \"Pooh!\" said Granny Fox after a while, \"that Meadow Mouse thinks  he can fool me by sitting still. I'll give"]]]
