He makes no  regular migrations at certain seasons, but, unless disturbed, will live  out his life close to his favorite haunts. His wings show him to be  unfitted for extended flight.    Jays are most easily discovered in the morning about sunrise on the tops  of young live oaks. Their notes are varied. Later in the day it is more  difficult to find them, as they are more silent, and not so much on the  tree tops as among the bushes.    The Jays breed in woods, forests, orchards, preferring old and very  shady trees, placing their nests in the center against the body, or at  the bifurcation of large limbs. The nest is formed of twigs and roots;  the eggs are from four to six.      THE BLUE JAY.        Something glorious, something gay,      Flits and flashes this-a-way!      'Thwart the hemlock's dusky shade,      Rich in color full displayed,      Swiftly vivid as a flame--      Blue as heaven and white as snow--      Doth this lovely creature go.      What may be his dainty name?      \"Only this\"--the people say--      \"Saucy, chattering, scolding Jay!\"          THE SWALLOW-TAILED INDIAN ROLLER.      Swallow-tailed Indian Rollers are natives of Northeastern Africa and  Senegambia, and also the interior of the Niger district. The bird is  so called from its way of occasionally rolling or turning over in its  flight, somewhat after the fashion of a tumbler pigeon. A traveller in  describing the habits of the Roller family, says:    \"On the 12th of April I reached Jericho alone, and remained there in  solitude for several days, during which time I had many opportunities  of observing the grotesque habits of the Roller. For several successive  evenings, great flocks of Rollers mustered shortly before sunset on some  dona trees near the fountain, with all the noise but without the decorum  of Rooks. After a volley of discordant screams, from the sound of which  it derives its Arabic name of \"schurkrak,\" a few birds would start from  their perches and commence overhead a series of somersaults. In a moment  or two they would be followed by the whole flock, and these gambols  would be repeated for a dozen times or more.    \"Everywhere it takes its perch on some conspicuous branch or on the top  of a rock, where it can see and be seen. The bare tops of the fig trees,  before they put forth their leaves, are in the cultivated terraces, a  particularly favorite resort. In the barren Ghor I have often watched it  perched unconcernedly on a knot of gravel or marl in the plain, watching  apparently for the emergence of beetles from the sand. Elsewhere I have  not seen it settle on the ground.    \"Like Europeans in the East, it can make itself happy without chairs and  tables in the desert, but prefers a comfortable easy chair when it is to  be found. Its nest I have seen in ruins, in holes in rocks, in burrows,  in steep sand cliffs, but far more generally in hollow trees. The colony  in the Wady Kelt used burrows excavated by themselves, and many a hole  did they relinquish, owing to the difficulty of working it. So cunningly  were the nests placed under a crumbling, treacherous ledge, overhanging  a chasm of perhaps one or two hundred feet, that we were completely  foiled in our siege. We obtained a nest of six eggs, quite fresh, in  a hollow tree in Bashan, near Gadara, on the 6th of May.    \"The total length of the Roller is about twelve inches. The  Swallow-tailed Indian Roller, of which we present a specimen, differs  from the Europeon Roller only in having the outer tail feathers  elongated to an extent of several inches.\"    [Illustration: SWALLOW-TAILED INDIAN ROLLER.]          THE RED HEADED WOODPECKER.      Perhaps no bird in North America is more universally known than the Red  Headed Woodpecker. He is found in all parts of the United States and is  sometimes called, for short, by the significant name of Red Head. His  tri-colored plumage, red, white and black, glossed with steel blue, is  so striking and characteristic, and his predatory habits in the orchards  and cornfields, and fondness for hovering along the fences, so very  notorious, that almost every child is acquainted with the Red Headed  Woodpecker. In the immediate neighborhood of large cities, where the old  timber is chiefly cut down, he is not so frequently found. Wherever  there is a deadening, however, you will find him, and in the dead tops  and limbs of high trees he makes his home. Towards the mountains,  particularly in the vicinity of creeks and rivers, these birds are  extremely numerous, especially in the latter end of summer. It is  interesting to hear them rattling on the dead leaves of trees or see  them on the roadside fences, where they flit from stake to stake. We  remember a tremendous and quite alarming and afterwards ludicrous  rattling by one of them on some loose tin roofing on a neighbor's house.  This occurred so often that the owner, to secure peace, had the roof  repaired.    They love the wild cherries, the earliest and sweetest apples, for,  as is said of him, \"he is so excellent a connoisseur in fruit, that  whenever an apple or pear is found broached by him, it is sure to be  among the ripest and best flavored. When alarmed he seizes a capital one  by striking his open bill into it, and bears it off to the woods.\" He  eats the rich, succulent, milky young corn with voracity. He is of a  gay and frolicsome disposition, and half a dozen of the fraternity are  frequently seen diving and vociferating around the high dead limbs of  some large trees, pursuing and playing with each other, and amusing the  passerby with their gambols. He is a comical fellow, too, prying around  at you from the bole of a tree or from his nesting hole therein.    Though a lover of fruit, he does more good than injury. Insects are his  natural food, and form at least two thirds of his subsistence. He  devours the destructive insects that penetrate the bark and body of a  tree to deposit their eggs and larvae.    About the middle of May, he begins to construct his nest, which is  formed in the body of large limbs of trees, taking in no material but  smoothing it within to the proper shape and size. The female lays six  eggs, of a pure white. The young appear about the first of June. About  the middle of September the Red Heads begin to migrate to warmer  climates, travelling at night time in an irregular way like a disbanded  army and stopping for rest and food through the day.    The black snake is the deadly foe of the Red Head, frequently entering  his nest, feeding upon the young, and remaining for days in possession.    \"The eager school-boy, after hazarding his neck to reach the  Woodpecker's hole, at the triumphant moment when he thinks the nestlings  his own, strips his arm, launches it down into the cavity, and grasping  what he conceives to be the callow young, starts with horror at the  sight of a hideous snake, almost drops from his giddy pinnacle, and  retreats down the tree with terror and precipitation.\"          THE WOODPECKER.    The Drummer Bird.      My dear girls and boys:    The man who told me to keep still and look pleasant while he took my  picture said I might write you a letter to send with it. You say I  always keep on the other side of the tree from you. That is because  someone has told you that I spoil trees, and I am afraid that you will  want to punish me for it. I do not spoil trees. The trees like to have  me come to visit them, for I eat the insects that are killing them.  Shall I tell you how I do this?    I cling to the tree with my strong claws so sharply hooked. The pointed  feathers of my tail are stiff enough to help hold me against the bark.  Then my breast bone is quite flat, so that I may press close to the  tree. When I am all ready you hear my r-r-rap--just like a rattle. My  head goes as quickly as if it were moved by a spring. Such a strong,  sharp bill makes the chips fly! The tiny tunnel I dig just reaches the  insect.    Then I thrust out my long tongue. It has a sharp, horny tip, and has  barbs on it too. Very tiny insects stick to a liquid like glue that  covers my tongue. I suppose I must tell you that I like a taste of the  ripest fruit and grain. Don't you think I earn a little when I work so  hard keeping the trees healthy?    I must tell you about the deep tunnel my mate and I cut out of a tree.  It is just wide enough for us to slip into. It is not straight down, but  bent, so that the rain cannot get to the bottom. There we make a nest of  little chips for our five white eggs.    I should like to tell you one of the stories that some boys and girls  tell about my red head. You will find it on another page of the book.  Now I must fly away to peck for more bugs.                                   Your loving friend,                                              WOODPECKER.    [Illustration: RED HEADED WOODPECKER.]          MEXICAN MOT MOT.      Mot mots are peculiar to the new world, being found from Mexico  throughout the whole of Central America and the South American  continent. The general plumage is green, and the majority of the species  have a large racket at the end of the center tail feathers, formed by  the bird itself.    The Houton, (so called from his note,) according to Waterson, ranks high  in beauty among the birds of Demerara. This beautiful creature seems to  suppose that its beauty can be increased by trimming its tail, which  undergoes the same operation as one's hair in a barber shop, using its  own beak, which is serrated, in lieu of a pair of scissors. As soon as  its tail is fully grown, he begins about an inch from the extremity of  the two longest feathers in it and cuts away the web on both sides of  the shaft, making a gap about an inch long. Both male and female wear  their tails in this manner, which gives them a remarkable appearance  among all other birds.    To observe this bird in his native haunts, one must be in"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/3066"],[0,"The Red Man's Continent: A Chronicle of Aboriginal America (#2)"],[1,"common to all men. If we find that all men live and  thrive best under certain climatic conditions, it is fair to assume that  those conditions prevailed in man's original home, and this conclusion  will enable us to cast out of the reckoning the regions where they do  not prevail. A study of the relations of millions of deaths to weather  conditions indicates that the white race is physically at its best when  the average temperature for night and day ranges from about 50 to 73  degrees F. and when the air is neither extremely moist nor extremely  dry. In addition to these conditions there must be not only seasonal  changes but frequent changes from day to day. Such changes are possible  only where there is a distinct winter and where storms are of frequent  occurrence. The best climate is, therefore, one where the temperature  ranges from not much below the freezing-point at night in winter to  about 80 degrees F. by day in summer, and where the storms which bring  daily changes are frequent at all seasons.    Surprising as it may seem, this study indicates that similar conditions  are best for all sorts of races. Finns from the Arctic Circle and  Italians of sunny Sicily have the best health and greatest energy under  practically the same conditions; so too with Frenchmen, Japanese, and  Americans. Most surprising of all, the African black man in the United  States is likewise at his best in essentially the same kind of weather  that is most favorable for his white fellow-citizens, and for Finns,  Italians, and other races. For the red race, no exact figures are  available, but general observation of the Indian's health and activity  suggests that in this respect he is at one with the rest of mankind.    For the source of any characteristic so widespread and uniform as this  adaptation to environment we must go back to the very beginning of the  human race. Such a characteristic must have become firmly fixed in the  human constitution before primitive man became divided into races, or at  least before any of the races had left their original home and started  on their long journey to America. On the way to this continent one race  took on a dark reddish or brownish hue and its hair grew straight and  black; another became black skinned and crinkly-haired, while a  third developed a white skin and wavy blonde hair. Yet throughout the  thousands of years which brought about these changes, all the races  apparently retained the indelible constitutional impress of the climate  of their common birthplace. Man's physical adaptation to climate seems  to be a deep-seated physiological fact like the uniformity of the  temperature of the blood in all races. Just as a change in the  temperature of the blood brings distress to the individual, so a change  of climate apparently brings distress to a race. Again and again, to be  sure, on the way to America, and under many other circumstances, man has  passed through the most adverse climates and has survived, but he has  flourished and waxed strong only in certain zones.    Curiously enough man's body and his mind appear to differ in their  climatic adaptations. Moreover, in this respect the black race, and  perhaps the red, appears to be diverse from the white. In America an  investigation of the marks of students at West Point and Annapolis  indicates that the best mental work is done when the temperature  averages not much above 40 degrees F. for night and day together. Tests  of school children in Denmark point to a similar conclusion. On the  other hand, daily tests of twenty-two Negroes at Hampton Institute for  sixteen months suggest that their mental ability may be greatest at a  temperature only a little lower than that which is best for the most  efficient physical activity. No tests of this sort have ever been made  upon Indians, but such facts as the inventiveness of the Eskimo, the  artistic development of the people of northern British Columbia and  southern Alaska, and the relatively high civilization of the cold  regions of the Peruvian plateau suggest that the Indian in this respect  is more like the white race than the black. Perhaps man's mental powers  underwent their chief evolution after the various races had left the  aboriginal home in which the physical characteristics became fixed.  Thus the races, though alike in their physical response to climate,  may possibly be different in their mental response because they have  approached America by different paths.    Before we can understand how man may have been modified on his way from  his original home to America, we must inquire as to the geographical  situation of that home. Judging by the climate which mankind now finds  most favorable, the human race must have originated in the temperate  regions of Europe, Asia, or North America. We are not entirely without  evidence to guide to a choice of one of the three continents. There is  a scarcity of indications of preglacial man in the New World and an  abundance of such indications in the Old. To be sure, several skulls  found in America have been supposed to belong to a time before the last  glacial epoch. In every case, however, there has been something to throw  doubt on the conclusion. For instance, some human bones found at Vero  in Florida in 1915 seem to be very old. Certain circumstances, however,  suggest that possibly they may not really belong to the layers of gravel  in which they were discovered but may have been inserted at some later  time. In the Old World, on the contrary, no one doubts that many human  skulls and other parts of skeletons belong to the interglacial epoch  preceding the last glacial epoch, while some appear to date from still  more remote periods. Therefore no matter at what date man may have  come to America, it seems clear that he existed in the Old World much  earlier. This leaves us to choose between Europe and Asia. The evidence  points to central Asia as man's original home, for the general movement  of human migrations has been outward from that region and not inward.  So, too, with the great families of mammals, as we know from fossil  remains. From the earliest geological times the vast interior of Asia  has been the great mother of the world, the source from which the most  important families of living things have come.    Suppose, then, that we place in central Asia the primitive home of  the thin-skinned, hairless human race with its adaptation to a highly  variable climate with temperatures ranging from freezing to eighty  degrees. Man could not stay there forever. He was bound to spread to  new regions, partly because of his innate migratory tendency and partly  because of Nature's stern urgency. Geologists are rapidly becoming  convinced that the mammals spread from their central Asian point of  origin largely because of great variations in climate. * Such variations  have taken place on an enormous scale during geological times. They  seem, indeed, to be one of the most important factors in evolution.  Since early man lived through the successive epochs of the glacial  period, he must have been subject to the urgency of vast climatic  changes. During the half million years more or less of his existence,  cold, stormy, glacial epochs lasting tens of thousands of years have  again and again been succeeded by warm, dry, interglacial epochs of  equal duration.          * W. D. Matthew. \"Climate and Evolution,\" N. Y. Acad. Sci., 1915.      During the glacial epochs the interior of Asia was well watered and full  of game which supplied the primitive human hunters. With the advent  of each interglacial epoch the rains diminished, grass and trees  disappeared, and the desert spread over enormous tracts. Both men  and animals must have been driven to sore straits for lack of food.  Migration to better regions was the only recourse. Thus for hundreds  of thousands of years there appears to have been a constantly recurring  outward push from the center of the world's greatest land mass. That  push, with the consequent overcrowding of other regions, seems to have  been one of the chief forces impelling people to migrate and cover the  earth.    Among the primitive men who were pushed outward from the Asian deserts  during a period of aridity, one group migrated northeastward toward  the Kamchatkan corner of Asia. Whether they reached Bering Sea and the  Kamchatkan shore before the next epoch of glaciation we do not know.  Doubtless they moved slowly, perhaps averaging only a few score or  a hundred miles per generation, for that is generally the way with  migrations of primitive people advancing into unoccupied territory. Yet  sometimes they may have moved with comparative rapidity. I have seen a  tribe of herdsmen in central Asia abandon its ancestral home and start  on a zigzag march of a thousand miles because of a great drought. The  grass was so scanty that there was not enough to support the animals.  The tribe left a trail of blood, for wherever it moved it infringed upon  the rights of others and so with conflict was driven onward. In some  such way the primitive wanderers were kept in movement until at  last they reached the bleak shores of the North Pacific. Even there  something--perhaps sheer curiosity--still urged them on. The green  island across the bay may have been so enticing that at last a raft of  logs was knotted together with stout withes. Perhaps at first the men  paddled themselves across alone, but the hunting and fishing proved so  good that at length they took the women and children with them, and so  advanced another step along the route toward America. At other times  distress, strife, or the search for game may have led the primitive  nomads on and on along the coast until a day came when the Asian home  was left and the New World was entered. The route by which primitive  man entered America is important because it determined the surroundings  among which the first Americans"]]]
