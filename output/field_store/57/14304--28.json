[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/25049"],[0,"My Reminiscences of the Anglo-Boer War (#2)"],[1,"I read circumstantial  reports of my death, and once a long, and by no means flattering,  obituary (extending over several columns of a newspaper) in which I  was compared to Garibaldi, \"Jack the Ripper,\" and Aguinaldo. On  another occasion I learned from British newspapers of my capture,  conviction, and execution in the Cape Colony for wearing the insignia  of the Red Cross. I read that I had been brought before a military  court at De Aar and sentenced to be shot, and what was worse, the  sentence was duly confirmed and carried out. A very lurid picture was  drawn of the execution. Bound to a chair, and placed near my open  grave, I had met my doom with \"rare stoicism and fortitude.\" \"At  last,\" concluded my amiable biographer, \"this scoundrel, robber, and  guerilla leader, Viljoen, has been safely removed, and will trouble  the British Army no longer.\" I also learned with mingled feelings of  amazement and pride that, being imprisoned at Mafeking at the  commencement of hostilities, General Baden-Powell had kindly  exchanged me for Lady Sarah Wilson.    To be honest, none of the above-mentioned reports were strictly  accurate. I can assure the reader that I was never killed in action or  executed at De Aar, I was never in Mafeking or any other prison in my  life (save here at St. Helena), nor was I in the Cape Colony during  the War. I never masqueraded with a Red Cross, and I was never  exchanged for Lady Sarah Wilson. Her ladyship's friends would have  found me a very poor exchange.    It is also quite inaccurate and unfair to describe me as a \"thief\" and  \"a scoundrel\". It was, indeed, not an heroic thing to do, seeing that  the chivalrous gentlemen of the South African Press who employed the  epithets were safely beyond my view and reach, and I had no chance of  correcting their quite erroneous impressions. I could neither refute  nor defend myself against their infamous libels, and for the rest, my  friend \"Mr. Atkins\" kept us all exceedingly busy.    That which is left of Ben Viljoen after the several \"coups de grace\"  in the field and the tragic execution at De Aar, still \"pans\" out at a  fairly robust young person--quite an ordinary young fellow, indeed,  thirty-four years of age, of middle height and build. Somewhere in the  Marais Quartier of Paris--where the French Huguenots came from--there  was an ancestral Viljoen from whom I am descended. In the War just  concluded I played no great part of my own seeking. I met many  compatriots who were better soldiers than myself; but on occasions I  was happily of some small service to my Cause and to my people.    The chapters I append are, like myself, simple in form. If I have  become notorious it is not my fault; it is the fault of the newspaper  paragraphist, the snap-shooter, and the autograph fiend; and in these  pages I have endeavoured, as far as possible, to leave the stage to  more prominent actors, merely offering myself as guide to the many  battlefields on which we have waged our unhappy struggle.    I shall not disappoint the reader by promising him sensational or  thrilling episodes. He will find none such in these pages; he will  find only a naked and unembellished story.                             BEN J. VILJOEN.

THE WAR CLOUDS GATHER.      In 1895 the political clouds gathered thickly and grew threatening.  They were unmistakable in their portent. War was meant, and we heard  the martial thunder rumbling over our heads.    The storm broke in the shape of an invasion from Rhodesia on our  Western frontiers, a raid planned by soldiers of a friendly power.    However one may endeavour to argue the chief cause of the South  African war to other issues, it remains an irrebuttable fact that the  Jameson Raid was primarily responsible for the hostilities which  eventually took place between Great Britain and the Boer Republics.    Mr. Rhodes, the sponsor and _deus ex machina_ of the Raid, could not  agree with Mr. Paul Kruger, and had failed in his efforts to establish  friendly relations with him. Mr. Kruger, quite as stubborn and  ambitious as Mr. Rhodes, placed no faith in the latter's amiable  proposals, and the result was that fierce hatred was engendered  between the two Gideons, a racial rancour spreading to fanatical  lengths.    Dr. Jameson's stupid raid is now a matter of history; but from that  fateful New Year's Day of 1896 we Boers date the terrible trials and  sufferings to which our poor country has been exposed. To that  mischievous incident, indeed, we directly trace the struggle now  terminated.    This invasion, which was synchronous with an armed rebellion at  Johannesburg, was followed by the arrest and imprisonment of the  so-called gold magnates of the Witwatersrand. Whether these  exceedingly wealthy but extremely degenerate sons of Albion and  Germania deserved the death sentence pronounced upon their leaders at  Pretoria for high treason it is not for me to judge.    I do recall, however, what an appeal for mercy there went up, how  piteously the Transvaal Government was petitioned and supplicated, and  finally moved \"to forgive and forget.\" The same faction who now press  so obdurately for \"no mercy\" upon the Colonial Afrikanders who joined  us, then supplicated all the Boer gods for forgiveness.    Meantime the Republic was plagued by the rinderpest scourge, which  wrought untold havoc throughout the country. This scourge was preceded  by the dynamite disaster at Vrededorp (near Johannesburg) and the  railway disaster at Glencoe in Natal. It was succeeded by a smallpox  epidemic, which, in spite of medical efforts, grew from sporadic to  epidemic and visited all classes of the Rand, exacting victims  wherever it travelled. During the same period difficulties occurred in  Swaziland necessitating the despatch of a strong commando to the  disaffected district and the maintenance of a garrison at Bremersdorp.  The following year hostilities were commenced against the Magato  tribe in the north of the Republic.    After an expensive expedition, lasting six months, the rebellion was  quelled. There was little doubt that the administration of unfaithful  native commissioners was in part responsible for the difficulties, but  there is less doubt that external influences also contributed to the  rebellion. This is not the time, however, to tear open old wounds.    Mr. Rhodes has disappeared from the stage for ever; he died as he had  lived. His relentless enemy Mr. Kruger, who was pulling the strings at  the other end, is still alive. Perhaps the old man may be spared to  see the end of the bloody drama; it was undoubtedly he and Mr. Rhodes  who played the leading parts in the prologue.    Which of these two \"Big Men\" took the greatest share in bringing about  the Disaster which has drenched South Africa with blood and draped it  in mourning, it would be improper for me at this period to suggest.  Mr. Rhodes has been summoned before a Higher Tribunal; Mr. Kruger has  still to come up for judgment before the people whose fate, and very  existence as a nation, are, at the time of writing, wavering in the  balance.    We have been at one another's throats, and for this we have to thank  our \"statesmen.\" It is to be hoped that our leaders of the future will  attach more value to human lives, and that Boer and Briton will be  enabled to live amicably side by side.    A calm and statesmanlike government by men free from ambition and  racial rancour, by men of unblemished reputation, will be the only  means of pacifying South Africa and keeping South Africa pacified.          CHAPTER II.    AND THE WAR STORM BREAKS.      It was during a desultory discussion of an ordinary sessions of the  Second Volksraad, in which I represented Johannesburg, that one day in  September, 1899--to be precise, the afternoon of the 28th--the  messenger of the House came to me with a note, and whispered, \"A  message from General Joubert, Sir; it is urgent, and the General says  it requires your immediate attention.\"    I broke the seal of the envelope with some trepidation. I guessed its  contents, and a few of my colleagues in the Chamber hung over me  almost speechless with excitement, whispering curiously, \"Jong, is dit  fout?\"--\"Is this correct. Is it war?\"    Everybody knew, of course, that we were in for a supreme crisis, that  the relations between Great Britain and our Republic were strained to  the bursting point, that bitter diplomatic notes had been exchanged  between the governments of the two countries for months past, and that  a collision, an armed collision, was sooner or later inevitable.    Being \"Fighting-Commandant\" of the Witwatersrand goldfields, and,  therefore, an officer of the Transvaal army, my movements on that day  excited great interest among my colleagues in the Chamber. After  reading General Joubert's note I said, as calmly as possible: \"Yes,  the die is cast; I am leaving for the Natal frontier. Good-bye. I must  now quit the house. Who knows, perhaps for ever!\"    General Joubert's mandate was couched as follows:--         \"You are hereby ordered to proceed with the Johannesburg       commando to Volksrust to-morrow, Friday evening, at 8       o'clock. Your field cornets have already received       instructions to commandeer the required number of burghers       and the necessary horses, waggons, and equipment.       Instructions have also been given for the necessary railway       conveyances to be held ready. Further instructions will       reach you.\"    Previous to my departure next morning I made a hurried"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/25063"],[0,"The Beggar's Opera; to Which is Prefixed the Musick to Each Song (#2)"],[1,"   NOTE ON THE SCENE AND COSTUMES AT THE LYRIC THEATRE, HAMMERSMITH      Superficially the task of staging _The Beggar's Opera_ was one of  supreme ease. Indeed, so easy was it that it became a matter of some  embarrassment to prune and select the required amount of data. Here was  Hogarth and his actual scene of Newgate with Macheath in chains; here  was Laroon's _Cries of London_ falling, in its edition of 1733, pat into  the period; here was the National Portrait Gallery and, added to these,  here was the benefit of all Mr. Charles E. Pearce's research.[1] After a  month or two of work in designing, the ease became so marked and  apparent that it engendered in me the beginnings of mistrust. Still,  I persevered in scene and costume with historically accurate  reproduction and, until three weeks before the actual work was due to be  carried out at the costumier's and in the painting shops, I felt  comparatively cheerful. Then I reviewed my forces--the little scale  models of the scenes, the characters in painted cardboard--all exact and  accurate. Something was wrong and the result was, I confess, appalling.  I had not made allowances either for my theatre or for my audience.  I had forgotten that it required a spacious Georgian theatre, the  intimacy of the side-boxes, the great personages sitting on the stage.  The Duke of Bolton, Major Pauncefoot and Sir Robert Fagg were not in  their places as in Hogarth's painting; the pit would not be filled with  tye-wigs and hoops and there would be a sharper line of division between  the actors and the spectators than ever existed in 1728. Something else  had to be done. As reproduction was a failure one would try to give an  impression of the same thing. Impressionism proved even worse than  accuracy. It was neither one thing nor the other. It merged into \"making  a picture of it\"--a crime that is without parallel in the staging of a  play. To make a pretty picture at the expense of drama is merely to  pander to the voracity of the costumier and scene-painter.        [Footnote 1: _Polly Peachum and The Beggar's Opera_, by      Charles E. Pearce. Messrs. Stanley Paul & Company, 1913.]    What was then to be done? Added to all these objections was the  important fact that I had designed scenes that would have seriously  hampered the resources at Hammersmith. The theatre would have required  more space for storage than could possibly have been given and, in  addition, an army of stage hands would be wanted for whom there was not  in this little theatre the accommodation.    The solution was, of course, to forget one's past work, to scrap the  models, and to start feverishly afresh. The only method left untried was  the symbolic. That is to say, to hint at the eighteenth century and to  suggest that through the doors on the stage existed the London of 1728.  The scene demanded to be simple and one which, with slight modifications  in doors and windows, remained before the audience for the whole action  of the play. It was, therefore, to be a scene of which people did not  easily tire and that remained interesting, unobtrusive and formally  neat. To find such a scene it is necessary to refer back to days when  the Comic and the Tragic scenes were architectural and permanent. This I  did and, taking Palladio's magnificent scene at Vicenza, by a shameless  process of _reductio ad absurdum_, evolved the scene that is now in use  at Hammersmith. Palladio and Gay have much to forgive.    So far the scene, but it called for a corresponding treatment in the  dresses. In _The Beggar's Opera_ no one is in the height of fashion.  Macheath and certain Ladies of the Town alone \"keep Company with  Lords and Gentlemen,\" and even then there must have been apparent a  distinction. Macheath is unaltered. Here it was essential to keep to  tradition. Macheath in a blue coat is unthinkable. The rest of the  characters are frankly in the neighbourhood of Newgate. The clothes  of Peachum and Lockit would be as equally unfashionable and just as  possible thirty years before as thirty years after 1728, whilst the  footpads are clad in whatever Georgian rags that happened to come their  way. With the women I have taken greater licence. I have kept faithfully  to the outlines of the age, the close-fitting bodice, the flat hoops,  the square-toed shoes, but I have taken considerable liberties in the  manner in which I have shorn them of ribbons and laces and--for the sake  of dramatic simplicity, be it remembered--I have eliminated yards of  trimming.    Just so much explanation is, I consider, due to the public, but whether  I have been justified by results or whether, under the sacred mask of  Drama, I have erred unpardonably, are points which, so long as this  revival draws attention to a forgotten masterpiece, can be of no very  great importance.

If Poverty be a Title to Poetry, I am sure no-body can dispute mine.  I own myself of the Company of Beggars; and I make one at their Weekly  Festivals at _St. Giles's_. I have a small Yearly Salary for my Catches,  and am welcome to a Dinner there whenever I please, which is more than  most Poets can say.    _Player._ As we live by the Muses, it is but Gratitude in us to  encourage Poetical Merit wherever we find it. The Muses, contrary to all  other Ladies, pay no Distinction to Dress, and never partially mistake  the Pertness of Embroidery for Wit, nor the Modesty of Want for Dulness.  Be the Author who he will, we push his Play as far as it will go. So  (though you are in Want) I wish you success heartily.    _Beggar._ This piece I own was originally writ for the celebrating the  Marriage of _James Chaunter_ and _Moll Lay_, two most excellent  Ballad-Singers. I have introduced the Similes that are in all your  celebrated _Operas_: The _Swallow_, the _Moth_, the _Bee_, the _Ship_,  the _Flower_, &c. Besides, I have a Prison-Scene, which the Ladies  always reckon charmingly pathetic. As to the Parts, I have observed such  a nice Impartiality to our two Ladies, that it is impossible for either  of them to take Offence. I hope I may be forgiven, that I have not made  my Opera throughout unnatural, like those in vogue; for I have no  Recitative; excepting this, as I have consented to have neither Prologue  nor Epilogue, it must be allowed an Opera in all its Forms. The Piece  indeed hath been heretofore frequently represented by ourselves in our  Great Room at _St. Giles's_, so that I cannot too often acknowledge your  Charity in bringing it now on the Stage.    _Player._ But I see it is time for us to withdraw; the Actors are  preparing to begin. Play away the Overture.        [Exeunt.      OVERTURE    [Illustration]          [Illustration]      ACT I. SCENE I.    _SCENE, _Peachum's_ House._      _Peachum_ sitting at a Table with a large Book of Accounts before him.      AIR I. An old Woman clothed in Gray, &c.    [Music]      Through all the Employments of Life      Each Neighbour abuses his Brother;    Whore and Rogue they call Husband and Wife:      All Professions be-rogue one another:    The Priest calls the Lawyer a Cheat,      The Lawyer be-knaves the Divine:    And the Statesman, because he's so great,      Thinks his Trade as honest as mine.    A Lawyer is an honest Employment, so is mine. Like me too he acts in a  double Capacity, both against Rogues and for 'em; for 'tis but fitting  that we should protect and encourage Cheats, since we live by them.      Enter _Filch_.    _Filch._ Sir, _Black Moll_ hath sent word her Trial comes on in the  Afternoon, and she hopes you will order Matters so as to bring her off.    _Peachum._ As the Wench is very active and industrious, you may satisfy  her that I'll soften the Evidence.    _Filch._ _Tom Gagg_, Sir, is found guilty.    _Peachum._ A lazy Dog! When I took him the time before, I told him what  he would come to if he did not mend his Hand. This is Death without  Reprieve. I may venture to Book him [writes.] For _Tom Gagg_, forty  Pounds. Let _Betty Sly_ know that I'll save her from Transportation, for  I can get more by her staying in _England_.    _Filch._ _Betty_ hath brought more Goods into our Lock to-year than any  five of the Gang; and in truth, 'tis a pity to lose so good a Customer.    _Peachum._ If none of the Gang take her off, she may, in the common  course of Business, live a Twelve-month longer. I love to let Women  scape. A good Sportsman always lets the Hen Partridges fly, because the  Breed of the Game depends upon them. Besides, here the Law allows us no  Reward; there is nothing to be got by the Death of Women-- except our  Wives.    _Filch._ Without dispute, she is a fine Woman! 'Twas to her I was  obliged for my Education, and (to say a bold Word) she hath trained up  more young Fellows to the Business than the Gaming table.    _Peachum._ Truly, _Filch_, thy Observation is right. We and the Surgeons  are more beholden to Women than all the Professions besides.      AIR II. The bonny gray-ey'd Morn, &c.    [Music]      _Filch._ 'Tis Woman that seduces all Mankind,      By her we first were taught the wheedling Arts:    Her very Eyes can cheat; when most she's kind,      She tricks us of our Money with our Hearts."]]]
