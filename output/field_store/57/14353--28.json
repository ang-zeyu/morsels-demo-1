Some of these  victims were crippled for life and died as a result thereof.    When it became known that the W. F. M. continued to stand erect,  regardless of brutal attacks, it was decided to strike the last violent  blow against it.    Orchard, the man of honor, confessed, and the lawbreakers appealed to  the law against Haywood, Moyer and Pettibone.    This time the government did not hesitate. The eight-hour and protective  labor law was too insignificant to enforce, but to bring the officers of  the W. F. M. to account, that, of course, is the duty and the function  of the State.    There is not the slightest hope that the authorities who, for a number  of years, have permitted the violation of the law, will be put on  trial, but the crime they have perpetrated is a weighty argument in  favor of those who maintain that the State is not an independent  institution, but a tool of the possessing class.

Anything rather than arouse too much public condemnation! The lives they  lead are dependent upon the opinion of the Philistines. They are  revolutionists in theory, reactionists in practice.

We are not confronted by one czar  of the size of an elephant, but by a hundred thousand czars, as small as  mosquitoes, but equally disagreeable and annoying.

EMMA GOLDMAN,                                        Box 217, Madison Square Station.          THE CHILD AND ITS ENEMIES.    By EMMA GOLDMAN.      Is the child to be considered as an individuality, or as an object to be  moulded according to the whims and fancies of those about it? This seems  to me to be the most important question to be answered by parents and  educators. And whether the child is to grow from within, whether all  that craves expression will be permitted to come forth toward the light  of day; or whether it is to be kneaded like dough through external  forces, depends upon the proper answer to this vital question.    The longing of the best and noblest of our times makes for the strongest  individualities. Every sensitive being abhors the idea of being treated  as a mere machine or as a mere parrot of conventionality and  respectability, the human being craves recognition of his kind.    It must be borne in mind that it is through the channel of the child  that the development of the mature man must go, and that the present  ideas of the educating or training of the latter in the school and the  family--even the family of the liberal or radical--are such as to stifle  the natural growth of the child.    Every institution of our day, the family, the State, our moral codes,  sees in every strong, beautiful, uncompromising personality a deadly  enemy; therefore every effort is being made to cramp human emotion and  originality of thought in the individual into a straight-jacket from its  earliest infancy; or to shape every human being according to one  pattern; not into a well-rounded individuality, but into a patient work  slave, professional automaton, tax-paying citizen, or righteous  moralist. If one, nevertheless, meets with real spontaneity (which, by  the way, is a rare treat,) it is not due to our method of rearing or  educating the child: the personality often asserts itself, regardless of  official and family barriers. Such a discovery should be celebrated as  an unusual event, since the obstacles placed in the way of growth and  development of character are so numerous that it must be considered a  miracle if it retains its strength and beauty and survives the various  attempts at crippling that which is most essential to it.    Indeed, he who has freed himself from the fetters of the  thoughtlessness and stupidity of the commonplace; he who can stand  without moral crutches, without the approval of public opinion--private  laziness, Friedrich Nietzsche called it--may well intone a high and  voluminous song of independence and freedom; he has gained the right to  it through fierce and fiery battles. These battles already begin at the  most delicate age.    The child shows its individual tendencies in its plays, in its  questions, in its association with people and things. But it has to  struggle with everlasting external interference in its world of thought  and emotion. It must not express itself in harmony with its nature, with  its growing personality. It must become a thing, an object. Its  questions are met with narrow, conventional, ridiculous replies, mostly  based on falsehoods; and, when, with large, wondering, innocent eyes, it  wishes to behold the wonders of the world, those about it quickly lock  the windows and doors, and keep the delicate human plant in a hothouse  atmosphere, where it can neither breathe nor grow freely.    Zola, in his novel \"Fecundity,\" maintains that large sections of people  have declared death to the child, have conspired against the birth of  the child,--a very horrible picture indeed, yet the conspiracy entered  into by civilization against the growth and making of character seems to  me far more terrible and disastrous, because of the slow and gradual  destruction of its latent qualities and traits and the stupefying and  crippling effect thereof upon its social well-being.    Since every effort in our educational life seems to be directed toward  making of the child a being foreign to itself, it must of necessity  produce individuals foreign to one another, and in everlasting  antagonism with each other.    The ideal of the average pedagogist is not a complete, well-rounded,  original being; rather does he seek that the result of his art of  pedagogy shall be automatons of flesh and blood, to best fit into the  treadmill of society and the emptiness and dulness of our lives. Every  home, school, college and university stands for dry, cold  utilitarianism, overflooding the brain of the pupil with a tremendous  amount of ideas, handed down from generations past. \"Facts and data,\"  as they are called, constitute a lot of information, well enough perhaps  to maintain every form of authority and to create much awe for the  importance of possession, but only a great handicap to a true  understanding of the human soul and its place in the world.    Truths dead and forgotten long ago, conceptions of the world and its  people, covered with mould, even during the times of our grandmothers,  are being hammered into the heads of our young generation. Eternal  change, thousandfold variations, continual innovation are the essence of  life. Professional pedagogy knows nothing of it, the systems of  education are being arranged into files, classified and numbered. They  lack the strong fertile seed which, falling on rich soil, enables them  to grow to great heights, they are worn and incapable of awakening  spontaneity of character. Instructors and teachers, with dead souls,  operate with dead values. Quantity is forced to take the place of  quality. The consequences thereof are inevitable.    In whatever direction one turns, eagerly searching for human beings who  do not measure ideas and emotions with the yardstick of expediency, one  is confronted with the products, the herdlike drilling instead of the  result of spontaneous and innate characteristics working themselves out  in freedom.           \"No traces now I see       Whatever of a spirit's agency.       'Tis drilling, nothing more.\"      These words of Faust fit our methods of pedagogy perfectly. Take, for  instance, the way history is being taught in our schools. See how the  events of the world become like a cheap puppet show, where a few  wire-pullers are supposed to have directed the course of development of  the entire human race.    And the history of _our own_ nation! Was it not chosen by Providence to  become the leading nation on earth? And does it not tower mountain high  over other nations? Is it not the gem of the ocean? Is it not  incomparably virtuous, ideal and brave? The result of such ridiculous  teaching is a dull, shallow patriotism, blind to its own limitations,  with bull-like stubbornness, utterly incapable of judging of the  capacities of other nations. This is the way the spirit of youth is  emasculated, deadened through an over-estimation of one's own value. No  wonder public opinion can be so easily manufactured.    \"Predigested food\" should be inscribed over every hall of learning as a  warning to all who do not wish to lose their own personalities and their  original sense of judgment, who, instead, would be content with a large  amount of empty and shallow shells. This may suffice as a recognition of  the manifold hindrances placed in the way of an independent mental  development of"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/27137"],[0,"The Scholfield Wool-Carding Machines (#2)"],[1,"examples; most of the woolen mills of this period were like the  one built in 1792 by John Manning in Ipswich, Massachusetts, where all  the work of carding, spinning, and weaving was still performed by hand.    The Scholfields' knowledge of mechanical wool-processing was to find a  welcome reception in this young nation now struggling for economic  independence. The exact reason for their decision to embark for America  is unknown. However, it may well be that they, like Samuel Slater[9]  some three years earlier, had learned of the bounties being offered by  several state legislatures for the successful introduction of new  textile machines.    Both John and Arthur were experienced in the manufacture of woolens.  They were the sons of a clothier (during the 18th century, a person who  performed the several operations in finishing cloth) and had been  apprenticed to the trade. Arthur was 36 and a bachelor; John, a little  younger, was married and had six children. Arthur and John, with his  family, sailed from Liverpool in March 1793 and arrived in Boston some  two months later. Upon arrival, their immediate concern was to find a  dwelling place for John's family. Finally they were accommodated by  Jedediah Morse, well-known author of _Morse's geography and gazetteer_,  in a lodging in Charlestown, near Bunker Hill. In less than a month John  began to build a spinning jenny and a hand loom, and soon the  Scholfields started to produce woolen cloth. The two brothers were  joined in the venture by John Shaw, a spinner and weaver who had  migrated from England with them. Morse, being much impressed with some  of the broadcloth they produced, was especially interested to find that  John and Arthur understood the actual construction of the textile  machines. Morse immediately recommended the Scholfields to some wealthy  persons of Newburyport (see fig. 7), who were interested in sponsoring a  new textile mill.    [Illustration: Figure 8.--CROSS-SECTION OF A SCHOLFIELD WOOL-CARDING  MACHINE. The wool was fed into the machine from a moving apron, locked  in by a pair of rollers, and passed from the taker-in roller to the  angle stripper. This latter roller transferred the wool on to the main  cylinder and acted as a stripper for the first worker roller. After  passing through two more workers and strippers, the wool was prepared  for leaving the main cylinder by the fancy, a roller with longer wire  teeth set to reach into the card clothing of the large cylinder. Then  the doffer roller picked up the carded fibers from the main cylinder in  4-inch widths the length of the roller. These sections were freed by the  comb plate, passed between the fluted wooden cylinder and an under  board, where they were converted into slivers, and deposited into a  small wooden trough.]      The Newburyport Woolen Manufactory    A Newburyport philanthropist, Timothy Dexter, contributed the use of his  stable. There, beginning in December 1793, the Scholfields built a  24-inch, single-cylinder, wool-carding machine. They completed it early  in 1794, the first Scholfield wool-carding machine in America. The group  was so impressed that they organized the Newburyport Woolen Manufactory.  Arthur was hired as overseer of the carding and John as overseer of the  weaving and also as company agent for the purchase of raw wool. A site  was chosen on the Parker River in Byfield Parish, Newbury, where a  building 100 feet long, about half as wide, and three stories high was  constructed. To the new factory were moved the first carding machine,  two double-carding machines, as well as spinning, weaving and fulling  machines. The carding machines were built by Messrs. Standring,  Armstrong, and Guppy, under the Scholfields' immediate direction. All  the machinery with the exception of the looms was run by water-power;  the weaving was done by hand. The enterprise was in full operation by  1795.    John and Arthur Scholfield (and John's 11-year-old son, James) worked at  the Byfield factory for several years. During a wool-buying trip to  Connecticut in 1798, John observed a valuable water-power site at the  mouth of the Oxoboxo River, in the town (i.e., township) of Montville,  Connecticut. Here, the brothers decided, would be a good place to set up  their own mill, and on April 19, 1799, they signed a 14-year lease for  the water site, a dwelling house, a shop, and 17 acres of land. As soon  as arrangements could be completed, Arthur, John, and the latter's  family left for Montville.    [Illustration: Figure 9.--IN THE COLLECTION OF THE HENRY FORD MUSEUM,  DEARBORN, MICHIGAN, IS THIS ORIGINAL SCHOLFIELD WOOL-CARDING MACHINE of  the early 19th century. (_Photo courtesy of the Henry Ford Museum._)]    The Scholfields quite probably did not take any of the textile machinery  from the Byfield factory with them to Connecticut--first because the  machines were built while the brothers were under hire and so were the  property of the sponsors, and second because their knowledge of how to  build the machines would have made it unnecessary to incur the  inconvenience and expense of transporting machines the hundred odd miles  to Montville. However, John Scholfield's sons reported[10] that they had  taken a carding engine with them when they moved to Connecticut in 1799  and had later transferred it to a factory in Stonington. The sons  claimed that the frame, cylinders, and lags of the machine were made of  mahogany and that it had originally been imported from England. However,  it would have been most uncommon for a textile machine, even an English  one, to have been constructed of mahogany; and having built successful  carding machines, the men at Byfield would have found it unnecessary to  attempt the virtually impossible feat of importing an English one. If it  ever existed and was taken to Connecticut, therefore, this machine was  probably not a carding machine manufactured by the Scholfields. It is  more probable that the first Scholfield carding machine remained in the  Byfield mill as the property of the Newburyport Woolen Manufactory.    [Illustration: Figure 10.--AN ORIGINAL SCHOLFIELD WOOL-CARDING MACHINE  AT OLD STURBRIDGE VILLAGE, STURBRIDGE, MASSACHUSETTS. It is now run by  electricity. (_Photo courtesy of Old Sturbridge Village._)]    During the next half century, this mill was held by a number of  individuals. William Bartlett and Moses Brown, two of the leading  stockholders of the company, sold it in 1804 to John Lees, the English  overseer who succeeded the Scholfields, and he continued to operate it  for about 20 years. On August 24, 1824, the mill was purchased at a  Sheriff's sale by Gorham Parsons, who sold a part interest to Paul  Moody, a machinist from the textile town of Lowell. Moody operated the  mill for the next 5 years and at his death in 1831 his heirs sold their  interest back to Parsons. In 1832 it was leased for 7 years by William  N. Cleveland and Solomon Wilde under the name of William N. Cleveland &  Co. Following the expiration of the lease in 1839, a portion of the mill  was occupied for 3 or 4 years by Enoch Pearson, believed to have been a  descendant of the John Pearson who had been a clothier in Rowley in  1643, and subsequently various industries occupied other portions and  later the entire building, which burned with all its contents on October  29, 1859.    If the first Scholfield carding machine remained a part of the property,  therefore it must have been lost in that fire. However, the Scholfields'  importance to American wool manufacture was not contingent on the  building of one successful carding machine, regardless of whether it was  the first. It was the change in the scope of their business ventures  after their move to Connecticut that synonymized the name of Scholfield  with mechanical wool carding in America.    John and Arthur had built their woolen mill at Uncasville, a village in  the town of Montville, and there Arthur remained with his brother until  1801, when he married, sold his interest to John, and moved to  Pittsfield, Massachusetts. John and his sons continued to operate the  mill until 1806, when difficulties over water privileges spurred him to  purchase property in Stonington, Connecticut, where he built a new mill  containing two double-cylinder carding machines.[11] In 1813, leaving  one son in charge at Stonington, John returned to Montville and  purchased another factory and water privileges. He continued in the  woolen manufacture until his death in 1820.    Arthur, soon after arriving in Pittsfield, constructed a carding machine  and opened a Pittsfield mill. The following advertisement appeared in  the _Pittsfield Sun_, November 2, 1801:         Arthur Scholfield respectfully informs the inhabitants of       Pittsfield and the neighboring towns, that he has a carding-machine       half a mile west of the meeting-house, where they may have their       wool carded into rolls for 12-1/2 cents per pound; mixed 15-1/2       cents per pound. If they find the grease, and pick and grease it,       it will be 10 cents per pound, and 12-1/2 cents mixed. They are       requested to send their wool in sheets as they will serve to bind       up the rolls when done. Also a small amount of woolens for sale.    The people around Pittsfield soon realized that the mechanically carded  wool was not only much easier to spin but enabled them to produce twice  as much yarn from the same amount of wool. Although many brought their  wool to be carded at his factory, Arthur was not without problems. These  were evident in his advertisement of May 1802, in which he stated that  if the wool was not properly \"sorted, clipped, and cleansed\" he would  charge an extra penny per pound. He also added that he would issue no  credit. Shortly after this, recognizing the need for additional carding  machines in other localities, Arthur Scholfield undertook the work of  manufacturing such machines"]]]
