Dear reader, study this little work with a simple and sincere heart,  with lowliness of mind, without wishing to criticise it, and you will  find it of good to you. Receive it with the same spirit as that in which  it is given, which is no other than the longing that you may be led to  _give yourself unreservedly to God_. My desire is that it may be the  means of leading the simple ones and the children to their Father, who  loves their humble confidence, and to whom distrust is so displeasing.  Seek nothing but _the love of God_; have a sincere desire for your  salvation, and you will assuredly find it, following this little  unmethodical method.    I do not pretend to elevate my sentiments above those of others, but I  relate simply what has been my own experience as well as that of  others, and the advantage which I have found in this simple and natural  manner of going to God.    If this book treats of nothing else but the _short and easy method of  prayer_, it is because, being written only for that, it cannot speak of  other things. It is certain that, if it be read in the spirit in which  it has been written, there will be found nothing in it to shock the  mind. Those who will make the experience of it will be the most certain  of the truth which it contains.    It is to Thee, O Holy Child Jesus, who lovest simplicity and innocence,  and who findest Thy delight in the children of men, that is to say, with  those amongst men who are willing to become children;--it is to Thee, I  say, to give worth and value to this little work, impressing it on the  heart, and leading those who read it to seek Thee within themselves,  where Thou wilt take Thy rest, receiving the tokens of their love, and  giving them proofs of Thine.    It is Thy work, O Divine Child! O uncreated Love! O silent Word! to make  Thyself beloved, tasted, and heard. Thou art able to do it; and I even  dare to say that Thou wilt do it, by means of this little work, which is  all to Thee, all of Thee, and all for Thee.          A SHORT METHOD OF PRAYER.          CHAPTER I.    ALL ARE COMMANDED TO PRAY--PRAYER THE GREAT MEANS OF SALVATION, AND  POSSIBLE AT ALL TIMES BY THE MOST SIMPLE.      Prayer is nothing else but the _application of the heart to God_, and  the interior exercise of love. St Paul commands us to \"pray without  ceasing\" (1 Thess. v. 17). Our Lord says: \"Take ye heed, watch and  pray.\" \"And what I say unto you, I say unto all\" (Mark xiii. 33, 37).  All, then, are capable of prayer, and it is the duty of all to engage in  it.    But I do not think that all are fit for meditation; and, therefore, it  is not that sort of prayer which God demands or desires of them.    My dear friends, whoever you may be, who desire to be saved, come unto  God in prayer. \"I counsel thee to buy of me gold tried in the fire, that  thou mayest be rich\" (Rev. iii. 18). It is easily to be obtained, far  more easily than you could ever imagine.    Come, all ye that are athirst, and take this water of life freely (see  Rev. xxii. 17). Do not amuse yourselves by hewing out to yourselves  \"broken cisterns that can hold no water\" (Jer. ii. 13). Come, hungry  souls, who find nothing that can satisfy you, and you shall be _filled_.  Come, poor afflicted ones, weighed down with griefs and sorrows, and you  shall be comforted. Come, sick ones, to the great Physician, and do not  fear to approach Him because you are so weak and diseased: expose all  your diseases to Him, and they shall be healed.    Come, children, to your Father; He will receive you with open arms of  love. Come, wandering and scattered sheep, to your Shepherd. Come,  sinners, to your Saviour. Come, ignorant and foolish ones, who believe  yourselves incapable of prayer; it is you who are the most fitted for  it. Come all without exception; Jesus Christ calls you all.    Let those only refuse to come who have no heart. The invitation is not  for them; for we must have a heart in order to love. But who is indeed  without heart? Oh, come and give that heart to God, and learn in the  place of prayer how to do it! All those who long for prayer are capable  of it, who have ordinary grace and the gift of the Holy Spirit, which is  freely promised to all who ask it.    Prayer is the key of perfection and of sovereign happiness; it is the  efficacious means of getting rid of all vices and of acquiring all  virtues; for the way to become perfect is to live in the presence of  God. He tells us this Himself: \"Walk before me, and be thou perfect\"  (Gen. xvii. 1). Prayer alone can bring you into His presence, and keep  you there continually.    What we need, then, is an attitude of prayer, in which we can  _constantly_ abide, and out of which exterior occupations cannot draw  us; a prayer which can be offered alike by princes, kings, prelates,  magistrates, soldiers, children, artisans, labourers, women, and the  sick. This prayer is not mental, but _of the heart_.    It is not a prayer of thought alone, because the mind of man is so  limited, that while it is occupied with one thing it cannot be thinking  of another. But it is the PRAYER OF THE HEART, which cannot be  interrupted by the occupations of the mind. Nothing can interrupt the  prayer of the heart but unruly affections; and when once we have tasted  of the love of God, it is impossible to find our delight in anything but  Himself.    Nothing is easier than to have God and to live upon Him. He is more  truly in us than we are in ourselves. He is more anxious to give Himself  to us than we are to possess Him. All that we want is to know the way to  seek Him, which is so easy and so natural, that breathing itself is not  more so.    Oh, you who imagine yourselves incapable of religious feeling, you may  live in prayer and in God as easily and as continuously as you live by  the air you breathe. Will you not, then, be inexcusable if you neglect  to do it, after you have learned the way?          CHAPTER II.    FIRST DEGREE OF PRAYER--MEDITATION AND MEDITATIVE READING--THE LORD'S  PRAYER--PASSAGE FROM THE FIRST DEGREE TO THE SECOND.      There are two means by which we may be led into the higher forms of  prayer. One is _Meditation_, the other is _Meditative Reading_. By  meditative reading I mean the taking of some truths, either doctrinal or  practical--the latter rather than the former--and reading them in this  way:--Take the truth which has presented itself to you, and read two or  three lines, seeking to enter into the full meaning of the words, and go  on no further so long as you find satisfaction in them; leave the place  only when it becomes insipid. After that, take another passage, and do  the same, not reading more than half a page at once.    It is not so much from the amount read that we derive profit, as from  the manner of reading. Those people who get through so much do not  profit from it; the bees can only draw the juice from the flowers by  resting on them, not by flying round them. Much reading is more for  scholastic than for spiritual science; but in order to derive profit  from spiritual books, we should read them in this way; and I am sure  that this manner of reading accustoms us gradually to prayer, and gives  us a deeper desire for it. The other way is _Meditation_, in which we  should engage at a chosen time, and not in the hour given to reading. I  think the way to enter into it is this:--After having brought ourselves  into the presence of God by a definite act of faith, we should read  something substantial, not so much to reason upon it, as to fix the  attention, observing that the principal exercise should be the presence  of God, and that the subject should rather fix the attention than  exercise reason.    This _faith in the presence of God within our hearts_ must lead us to  enter within ourselves, collecting our thoughts, and preventing their  wandering; this is an effectual way of getting rid of distracting  thoughts, and of losing sight of outward things, in order to draw near  to God, who can only be found in the secret place of our hearts, which  is the _sancta-sanctorum_ in which He dwells.    He has promised that if any one keeps His commandments, He will come to  him, and _make His abode_ with him (John xiv. 23). St Augustine  reproaches himself for the time he lost through not having sought God at  first in this way.    When, then, we are thus buried in ourselves, and deeply penetrated with  the presence of God within us--when the senses are all drawn from the  circumference to the centre, which, though it is not easily accomplished  at first, becomes quite natural afterwards--when the soul is thus  gathered up within itself, and is sweetly occupied with the truth read,  not in reasoning upon it, but in feeding upon it, and exciting the will  by the affection rather than the understanding by consideration: the  _affection_ being thus touched, must be suffered to _repose_ sweetly and  at peace, _swallowing_ what it has tasted.    As a person who only masticated an excellent meat would not be nourished  by it, although he would be sensible of its taste, unless he ceased this  movement in order to swallow it; so when the affection is stirred, if we  seek continually to stir it, we extinguish its fire, and thus deprive  the soul of its nourishment. We must swallow by a _loving repose_ (full  of respect and confidence) what we have masticated and tasted. This  method is very necessary, and would advance the soul in a short time  more than any other would do in several years.    But as I said that the direct and principal exercise should be the  _sense of the presence of God_, we must most faithfully _recall the  senses_ when they"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/25"],[0,"The 1991 CIA World Factbook (#2)"],[1,"of Yemen [Yemen                      (Aden) or South Yemen]; used for information                        dated before 22 May 1990 or CY91              UAE       United Arab Emirates            UK        United Kingdom            US        United States            USSR      Union of Soviet Socialist Republics (Soviet Union)            YAR       Yemen Arab Republic [Yemen (Sanaa) or North Yemen];                        used for information dated before 22 May 1990 or                        CY91      _#_Administrative divisions: The numbers, designatory terms, and  first-order administrative divisions are generally those approved by the  United States Board on Geographic Names (BGN). Changes that have been  reported but not yet acted upon by BGN are noted.      _#_Area: Total area is the sum of all land and water areas delimited  by international boundaries and/or coastlines. Land area is the  aggregate of all surfaces delimited by international boundaries and/or  coastlines, excluding inland water bodies (lakes, reservoirs, rivers).  Comparative areas are based on total area equivalents. Most entities  are compared with the entire US or one of the 50 states. The smaller  entities are compared with Washington, DC (178 km2, 69 miles2) or  The Mall in Washington, DC (0.59 km2, 0.23 miles2, 146 acres).      _#_Birth rate: The average annual number of births during a year  per 1,000 population at midyear. Also known as crude birth rate.      _#_Dates of information: In general, information available as of 1  January 1991 was used in the preparation of this edition. Population  figures are estimates for 1 July 1991, with population growth rates  estimated for mid-1991 through mid-1992. Major political events have  been updated through 30 June 1991. Military age figures are average  annual estimates for 1991-95.      _#_Death rate: The average annual number of deaths during a year  per l,000 population at midyear. Also known as crude death rate.      _#_Diplomatic representation: The US Government has diplomatic  relations with 162 nations. There are only 144 US embassies, since some  nations have US ambassadors accredited to them, but no physical US  mission exists. The US has diplomatic relations with 151 of the 159 UN  members--the exceptions are Angola, Belorussia (Byelorussia;  constituent republic of the Soviet Union), Cambodia, Cuba, Iran, Vietnam,  Ukraine (constituent republic of the Soviet Union) and, obviously, the US  itself. In addition, the US has diplomatic relations with 12 nations that  are not in the UN--Andorra, Federated States of Micronesia, Kiribati,  Marshall Islands, Monaco, Nauru, San Marino, South Korea, Switzerland,  Tonga, Tuvalu, and the Vatican City. North Korea is not in the UN and the  US does not have diplomatic relations with that nation. The US has not  recognized the incorporation of Estonia, Latvia, and Lithuania into the  Soviet Union and continues to accredit the diplomatic representatives of  their last free governments.      _#_Disputes: This category includes a wide variety of situations  that range from traditional bilateral boundary disputes to unilateral  claims of one sort or another. Every international land boundary  dispute in the \"Guide to International Boundaries,\" a map published  by the Department of State, is included. References to other situations  may also be included that are border- or frontier-relevant, such as  maritime disputes, geopolitical questions, or irredentist issues.  However, inclusion does not necessarily constitute official acceptance  or recognition by the US Government.      _#_Economic aid: This entry refers to bilateral commitments of:    Official Development Assistance (ODA), which is defined as government  grants that (a) are administered with the promotion of economic  development and welfare of LDCs as their main objective and (b) are  concessional in character and contain a grant element of at least 25%;  and    Other Official Flows (OOF) or transactions by the official sector  whose main objective is other than development-motivated or whose  grant element is below the 25% threshold for ODA. OOF transactions  include official export credits (such as Eximbank credits), official  equity and portfolio investment, and debt reorganization by the  official sector that does not meet concessional terms.    Aid is considered to have been committed when agreements are  initialed by the parties involved and constitute a formal declaration  of intent.      _#_Entities: Some of the nations, dependent areas, areas of special  sovereignty, and governments included in this publication are not  independent, and others are not officially recognized by the US  Government. Nation refers to a people politically organized into a  sovereign state with a definite territory. Dependent area refers to a  broad category of political entities that are associated in some way  with a nation. Names used for page headings are usually the short-form  names as approved by the US Board on Geographic Names. The  long-form name is included in the Government section and an entry  of \"none\" indicates a long-form name does not exist. In some  instances, no short-form name exists--then the long-form name must  serve for all usages.

Those Baltic states are not members of the  UN and are not included in the list of nations. The US Government does  not recognize the four so-called \"independent\" homelands of  Bophuthatswana, Ciskei, Transkei, and Venda in South Africa.      _#_Gross domestic product (GDP): The value of all goods and  services produced domestically.      _#_Gross national product (GNP): The value of all goods and  services produced domestically, plus income earned abroad, minus  income earned by foreigners from domestic production.      _#_GNP/GDP methodology: In the Economy section, GNP/GDP dollar  estimates for the OECD countries, the USSR, and the East European  countries are derived from purchasing power parity (PPP)  calculations rather than from conversions at official currency exchange  rates. The PPP method normally involves the use of international  dollar price weights, which are applied to the quantities of goods and  services produced in a given economy. In addition to the lack of  reliable data from the majority of countries, the statistician faces  a major difficulty in specifying, identifying, and allowing for the  quality of goods and services. The division of a PPP GNP/GDP estimate  in dollars by the corresponding estimate in the local currency gives  the PPP conversion rate. One thousand dollars will buy the  same market basket of goods in the US as one thousand dollars, converted  to the local currency at the PPP conversion rate, will buy in the other  country. GNP/GDP estimates for the LDCs, on the other hand, are based on  the conversion of GNP/GDP estimates in local currencies to dollars at  the official currency exchange rates. One caution: the proportion of,  say, defense expenditures as a percent of GNP/GDP in local currency  accounts may differ substantially from the proportion when GNP/GDP  accounts are expressed in PPP terms, as, for example, when an observer  estimates the dollar level of Soviet or Japanese military expenditures;  similar problems exist when components are expressed in dollars under  currency exchange rate procedures. Finally, as academic research  moves forward on the PPP method, we hope to convert all GNP/GDP  estimates to this method in future editions of the Factbook.      _#_Growth rate (population): The annual percent change in the  population, resulting from a surplus (or deficit) of births over  deaths and the balance of "]]]
