[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/26196"],[0,"The International Magazine, Volume 2, No. 3, February, 1851 (#2)"],[1,"we practise to deceive!\"    Despite his marvellous talents, his industry, his knowledge, his  magnitude of mind, his glorious imagination, his bold satire, his  independence, his devotional love of his mother and sister--if he had  lived through a long age of prosperity, Chatterton could never have been  trusted, nor esteemed, _from his total want of truth_. His is the most  striking example upon record of the necessity for uprightness in word  and deed. Where a great end is to be achieved--there must be  consistency, a union between noble daring and noble deeds--there must be  Truth! No man has ever deviated from it without losing not only the  respect of the thinking, but even the confidence of the unwise.  Chatterton's earliest idea seems to have been how to deceive; and, were  it possible to laugh at youthful fraud, there would be something  irresistibly ludicrous in the lad bewildering the old pewterer, Burgum.  Imagine the fair-haired rosy boy, the brightness of his extraordinary  eyes increased by the covert mischief which urged him forward--fancy his  presenting himself to Master Burgum, who, dull as his own pewter, had  the ambition, which the cunning youth fostered, of being thought of an  \"ancient family\"--fancy Chatterton in his poor-school dress presenting  himself to this man, whose business, Chatterton's biographer, Mr. Dix,  tells us, was carried on in the house now occupied by Messrs. Sander,  Bristol Bridge,[2] and informing him that he had made a  discovery--presenting to him various documents, with a parchment  painting of the De Burgham arms, in proof of his royal descent from the  Conqueror.    [Illustration: BRISTOL BRIDGE.]    Mr. Dix assures us, \"that never once doubting the validity of the  record, in which his own honors were so deeply implicated, he presented  the poor bluecoat-boy, who had been so fortunate in _finding_ so much,  and so assiduous in his endeavors to collect the remainder, with _five  shillings_!\" Blush, Bristol, blush at this record of a citizen's  meanness; the paltry remuneration could have hardly tempted even so poor  a lad as Thomas Chatterton to continue his labors for the love of gain;  yet he furnished Burgum with further information, loving the indulgence  of his mystifying powers, and secretly satirizing the folly he duped.    It is quite impossible to trace back any circumstance which could, to  speak advisedly, have led to such a course of deception as was practised  by this boy; born of obscure parents, his father, a man of dissolute  habits, was sub-chanter of the Cathedral, and also master of the free  school in Pyle-street; this clever, but harsh, and dissolute man died in  August, 1752, and the poet was born on the 20th of the following  November.[3] Such a parent could not be a loss; he would have been, in  all human probability, as careless of his son as he was of his wife;  and, at all events, Chatterton had not the misery of early cruelty to  complain of, for he had a mother, tender and affectionate, although  totally unfit to guide and manage his wayward nature. Her first grief  with him arose, strange as it may seem, from his inaptitude for  learning--as a child he disdained A B C, and indulged himself with his  own thoughts. When nearly seven years old he \"fell in love,\" to use his  mother's phrase, \"with an illuminated French manuscript,\" and thus  learned his letters from the very sort of thing he spent his early days  in counterfeiting. His progress was wonderful, both as to rapidity and  extent, and his pride kept pace therewith. A friend, wishing to give the  boy and his sister a present of china-ware, asked him what device he  would choose to ornament his with. \"Paint me,\" he said, \"an angel with  wings and a trumpet, to trumpet my name over the world.\" Here was a  proof of innate ambition; if his mother had had an understanding mind,  this observation would have taught her to read his character. Such  ambition could have been directed,--and directed to noble deeds.    [Illustration: BIRTHPLACE OF CHATTERTON.]    [Illustration: CHATTERTON AS DOORKEEPER.]    He was admitted into the Blue Coat School, commonly called \"Colston's  School,\"[4] before he was eight years old, and his enthusiastic joy at  the prospect of learning so much, was damped by finding that, to quench  his thirst for knowledge, \"there were not books enough.\" When he took in  rotation the post of doorkeeper at the school, he used to indulge  himself in making verses,[5] and his sister, who loved him tenderly,  presented him with a pocket-book, in which he wrote verses, and gave it  back to her the following year. There was nothing in this species of  tuition or companionship to create or foster either the imitations or  the satire he indulged in, he had neither correction nor assistance from  any one. Even before his apprenticeship to Mr. John Lambert, he felt he  was not appreciated or understood; perhaps no one ever _acted_ a greater  satire upon his own profession than this harsh attorney, who deemed his  apprentice on a level with his footboy. He must have been a man utterly  devoid of perception and feeling; his insulting contempt of what he  could not understand added considerably to the sarcastic bitterness of  Chatterton's nature, and it is easy to picture the boy's feelings when  his productions were torn by this tyrant and scattered on the office  floor! He has his reward. John Lambert, the scrivener, is only  remembered as the insulter of Thomas Chatterton![6]    [Illustration: TOMB OF CANYNGE.]    It is impossible not to pause at every page of this boy's brief but  eventful life, and lament that he had no friend; reading, as we do, by  the light of other days, we can see so many passages where judicious  counsel, given with the intelligent affection that would at once have  opened his heart, _must_ have saved him; his heart, once laid bare to  friendship, would have been purified by the air of truth; it was its  _closeness_ which infected his nature. And yet the scrivener considered  him a good apprentice. His industry was amazing; his frequent employment  was to copy precedents, and one volume, in his handwriting, which is  still extant, consists of three hundred and forty-four closely-written  folio pages. There was in that gloomy office an edition of Camden's  \"Britannia,\" and, having borrowed from Mr. Green, a bookseller,  Speight's \"Chaucer,\" he compiled therefrom an ingenious glossary, for  his own use, in two parts. \"The first,\" Mr. Dix says, \"contained old  words, with the modern English--the second, the modern English, with the  old words; this enabled him to turn modern English into old, as an  English and Latin dictionary enables the student to turn English into  Latin.\" How miserable it is, amongst these evidences of his industry and  genius, to find that all his ingenuity turned to the furtherance of a  fraud. He seems to have been morally dead to every thing like the  disgrace attending falsehood; for, when struggling afterwards in London  to appear prosperous while starving, he wrote home to Mr. Catcott, and  concludes his letter by stating that he intended going abroad as a  _surgeon_, adding, \"Mr. Barrett has it in his power to assist me  greatly, by _his giving me a physical character_; I hope he will.\" He  seems to have had no idea that he was asking Mr. Barrett to do a  dishonest action.    But the grand fraud of his short life was boldly dared by this boy in  his sixteenth year. Why he should have ever descended to forge when he  felt the high pressure of genius so strong within him, is inexplicable.  Why, with his daring pride, he should have submitted to be considered a  transcriber, where he originated, is more than marvellous. The spell of  a benighting antiquity seemed around him; it might lead one to a belief  in \"Gramarie\"--that some fake spirit had issued forth from the \"cofre of  Mr. Canynge,\"[7] so long preserved in the room over the north porch of  this Bristol church of Redcliffe--a \"_cofre_\" secured by six keys, all  of which being lost or mislaid, the vestry ordered the \"_cofre_\" to be  opened; and not only \"Canynge's _cofre_,\" but all the \"_cofres_,\" in the  mysterious chamber: not from any love of antiquity, but because of the  hope of obtaining certain title-deeds supposed to be contained therein.  Well, these intelligent worthies, having found what concerned  themselves, took them away, leaving behind, _and open_, parchments and  documents which might have enriched our antiquarian literature beyond  all calculation.[8] Chatterton's father used to carry these parchments  away wholesale, and covered with the precious relics, bibles, and  school-books: most likely other officers of the church did the same.  After his death, his widow conveyed many of them, with her children and  furniture, to her new residence, and, woman-like, formed them into dolls  and thread-papers. In process of time, the child's attention being  aroused by the illuminated manuscripts, he conveyed every bit of  parchment he could find to a small den of a room in his mother's house,  which he called his own: and, when he grew a little older, set forth,  with considerable tact, in answer to all questions asked of him as to  how he obtained the poems and information, that he himself had searched  the old \"_cofres_,\"[9] and discovered the poems of the Monk Rowley.  Certainly he could not have had a better person to trumpet his discovery  than \"a talkative fool\" like Burgum, who was so proud of his pedigree as  to torment the officers of the Herald's College about his ancestors; and  he was not the only one imposed on by Chatterton's talent. His  simple-minded mother bore testimony to his joy at discovering those  \"written parchments upon the covered books:\" and, of course, each  discovery added to his antiquarian knowledge; for, though no trace  exists of the Monk Rowley's originals, there is little doubt that on  some of those parchments he found"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/26198"],[0,"South Africa and the Transvaal War, Vol. 2 (of 8) (#2)"],[1,"at Besters brilliantly taken by         cavalry.
