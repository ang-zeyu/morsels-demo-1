Shrubs.\"    The door to the cottage flew open. \"A shrub, am I!\" Phyllis brandished  an axe which, James winced to recall, was an item of the equipment he  had ordered from Earth before the scout team had learned that the trees  were intelligent. \"I'll shrub you!\"    \"Phyllis!\" He wrested the axe from her grip. \"That would be murder!\"    \"'Woodman,' as the Terrestrial poem goes,\" the tree remarked, \"'spare  that tree! Touch not a single bough! In youth it sheltered me and I'll  protect it now!'\"    Good of her to take the whole thing so calmly--rather, to pretend to  take it so calmly, for he knew how sensitive Magnolia really was--but he  was afraid this show of moral courage would not diminish Phyllis's  dislike for her; those without self-control seldom appreciate those who  have it.    \"If you'll excuse us,\" he said, putting his arm around his wife's  heaving shoulders, \"I'd better see to Phyllis; she's a little upset.  Holdover from spacesickness, I expect. Poor girl, she's a long way from  home and frightened.\"    \"I understand, Jim,\" Magnolia told him, \"and, remember, whatever  happens, you can always count on me.\"           *       *       *       *       *    \"I must say you're not a very admirable representative of Terrestrial  womanhood!\" James snapped, as soon as the door had slammed behind him  and his wife, leaving them alone together in the principal room of the  cottage. \"Insulting the very first native you meet!\"    \"I did not either insult her. All I said was, 'What beautiful  flowers--do you suppose the fruit is edible?' How was I to know  it--_she_ could understand? Naturally I wouldn't dream of eating her  fruit now. It would probably taste nasty anyway. And how do you think  _I_ felt when a _tree_ answered me back? You don't care that I fainted  dead away, and I've never fainted before in my life. All you care about  is that old vegetable's feelings! It was bad enough, feeling for five  months that someone had come between us, but to find out it wasn't  some_one_ but some_thing_--!\"    \"Phyllis,\" he said coldly, \"I'll thank you to keep a civil tongue in  your head.\"    Dropping into the overstuffed chair, his wife dabbed at her eyes with a  handkerchief. \"She wasn't so very polite to me!\"    \"Look, Phyllis--\" he strove to make his voice calm, adult,  reasonable--\"you happened to have hit on rather a touchy point with her.  Those trees are dioecious, you know, like us, and she isn't mated. And,  well, she has rather a lot of xylem zones--rings, you know.\"    \"Are you trying to tell me she's old?\"    \"Well, she's no sapling any more. And, consideration aside, you know  it's government's policy for us to establish good relations with any  intelligent life-form we have to share a planet with. You weren't in  there trying.\"    Phyllis put away her handkerchief with what he hoped would be a final  sniff. \"I suppose I shouldn't have acted that way,\" she conceded.    \"Now you're talking like my own dear Phyllis,\" James said tenderly,  though, as a matter of fact, he had a very remote idea of what his own  dear Phyllis was like. He had met her only a couple of months before the  scout mission was scheduled, and so their courtship had been brief, and  the actual weeks of marriage even briefer. He had remembered Phyllis as  beautiful--and she was beautiful. He had not, however, remembered her as  pig-headed--and pig-headed she was, too.    \"How come she hasn't a mate? I didn't think trees were choosy.\"           *       *       *       *       *    He wouldn't take exception to that statement, uncharitable though it  was; after all, someone whose only acquaintance with trees had been with  the Terrestrial variety would naturally be incapable of appreciating the  total tree at its highest development.    \"It's a great tragedy,\" he told her in a hushed tone. \"There was a  blight some years back and most of the male trees died off, except for a  few on the other side of the planet--well out of bee-shot, even if the  females there would let the females here have any pollen, which they  absolutely won't.\"    \"I don't blame them,\" Phyllis said coldly. Of course she would identify  at once with the trees whose domestic lives seemed to be threatened.    \"It's not that so much. It's that the male trees produce so little  pollen.\"    \"This would be a good place for people with hay fever then, wouldn't  it?\"    \"And even when there is fruit, so much of it tends to be  parthenocarpous--no seeds.\" He sighed. \"The entire race is dying out.\"    \"How is it you know so much about botany?\" she asked suspiciously. \"It's  not your field.\"    \"I don't know so very much, really,\" he smiled. \"I had to learn a  little, if I wanted to work the land, so I borrowed an elementary text  from Cutler.\" Had he been a trifle idealistic in quitting his snug, if  uninspiring, job on the faculty to join in this Utopian venture? So many  of the other men at the university had enrolled, it had seemed a  splendid idea until Phyllis's arrival.    \"Daddy never had any trouble working his land and he doesn't know a  thing about botany. You've been boning up on it just to please _her_!\"    \"Phyllis! How can you jump to conclusions without a shred of evidence?\"  Not that she wouldn't be able to collect such evidence later, because  the allegation happened to be correct. _If, instead of coming to  Elysium, I had merely gone to China, would she have thought it so odd  that I studied Chinese? Then why, where the natives are trees, shouldn't  I study botany? The woman is unreasonable._           *       *       *       *       *    \"And will her--people let you farm?\"    Now he could show her how cogently and comprehensively he could answer a  logical question. \"That aspect of the situation will be all right, dear,  because only the trees are an intelligent species and, even of them,  some aren't so bright. They won't have any more objection to our eating  the other fruit and vegetables than we would have to an  extraterrestrial's eating our eggs and chickens, for example. We're  going to try to introduce some Earth plants here, though, as the higher  forms of vegetation are dying out and we're afraid the lower might  follow. Pity it's too late for a sound conservation program.\"           *       *       *       *       *    Phyllis said grimly, \"She doesn't think it's too late for a sound  conservation program. She still has hopes--far-fetched, maybe, and I'm  not so sure they are. Mark my words, James, she's got designs on _you_.\"    \"Don't be idiotic,\" he protested. \"That would be--\" he attempted to  introduce a light note--\"it would be miscegenation.\"    \"These foreigners can't be expected to have our standards.\" And she  burst into tears again. \"A fine thing to go through that miserable  five-month trip only to find out a tree has alienated my husband's  affections.\"    \"Oh, come on, Phyl!\" He still was trying for a smile. \"What would a tree  see in me?\"    \"I'm beginning to wonder what I saw in you. You never loved me; you just  wanted a wife to come out and colonize with you and b-b-breed.\"    What could he say? It was almost true. Phyllis was a beautiful girl and  he loved her, but, if he had planned to remain as an instructor with the  Romance Languages Department instead of joining the scout mission, he  knew he would never have asked her to be his wife ... for her sake, of  course, as well as his own. He should say something to reassure her, but  the words wouldn't come.    \"I don't like it here,\" Phyllis sobbed. \"I don't like blue leaves. I  don't like blue grass. I like them green, the way they're supposed to  be. I hate this nasty planet. It's all wrong. I want to go home.\"    She was very young--less than eight years younger than he, true, but he  was mature for his age. They didn't know each other very well. And,  finally, there were more men than women on the planet and he had noticed  that the bachelors had seemed readily disposed, upon her arrival the day  before, to overlook the fact that she had no college degree. So he must  be patient with her.    \"There's nothing wrong about it, dear. The plants here synthesize  cyanophyll instead of chlorophyll; that's why the leaves are blue  instead of green. And, of course, there are different mineral  constituents of the soil--more aluminum and copper, for instance, than  on Earth, and some elements we haven't quite isolated yet. So, you see,  they're bound to be a little different from Terrestrial trees.\"    \"A little different I wouldn't mind,\" she said sulkily, \"but they're a  lot different without being nearly alien enough.\"    \"Look, Phyllis--_dear_--those trees have been very hospitable, very  kind. We owe them a lot. They themselves suggested that we come here and  live with them in, so to speak, symbiosis.\"    \"That's a fine idea!\"           *       *       *       *       *    He beamed. \"I knew you'd understand after I had explained it to you.\"    \"We provide the brains and they provide the furniture.\"    \"Phyllis! What a thing to say!\"    \"I've heard of man-eating trees before. I suppose there could be  man-loving ones, too.\"    \"Phyllis, these trees are as gentle and sweet as--as--\" He didn't know  how he could explain it to her. No one who had never been friends with a  tree could appreciate the true beauty of the xylemic character. \"Why, we  even offered to go over to the other side of the planet and fetch some  pollen for them, but they wouldn't hear of it. Unfortunately, they'd  rather die than be mated to anyone they had never met.\"    \"What a perfectly disgusting idea!\"    \"I don't think so. Trees can be idealistic--\"    \"You fetching pollen for her, I mean. Naturally she wouldn't want pollen  from a tree on the other side of the planet. She wants _you_!\"    \"Don't be silly. Incompatibility usually exists between the pollen of  one species and the stigmata of another."]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/316"],[0,"The Golden Road (#2)"],[1,"ily, reproachfully, \"haven't you anything for Sara Ray to  do? She'll feel awful bad if she is left out.\"    I had forgotten Sara Ray. Nobody, except Cecily, ever did remember  Sara Ray unless she was on the spot. But we decided to put her in as  advertising manager. That sounded well and really meant very little.    \"Well, we'll go ahead then,\" I said, with a sigh of relief that the  project had been so easily launched. \"We'll get the first issue out  about the first of January. And whatever else we do we mustn't let Uncle  Roger get hold of it. He'd make such fearful fun of it.\"    \"I hope we can make a success of it,\" said Peter moodily. He had been  moody ever since he was entrapped into being fiction editor.    \"It will be a success if we are determined to succeed,\" I said. \"'Where  there is a will there is always a way.'\"    \"That's just what Ursula Townley said when her father locked her in her  room the night she was going to run away with Kenneth MacNair,\" said the  Story Girl.    We pricked up our ears, scenting a story.    \"Who were Ursula Townley and Kenneth MacNair?\" I asked.    \"Kenneth MacNair was a first cousin of the Awkward Man's grandfather,  and Ursula Townley was the belle of the Island in her day. Who do you  suppose told me the story--no, read it to me, out of his brown book?\"    \"Never the Awkward Man himself!\" I exclaimed incredulously.    \"Yes, he did,\" said the Story Girl triumphantly. \"I met him one day  last week back in the maple woods when I was looking for ferns. He was  sitting by the spring, writing in his brown book. He hid it when he saw  me and looked real silly; but after I had talked to him awhile I just  asked him about it, and told him that the gossips said he wrote poetry  in it, and if he did would he tell me, because I was dying to know. He  said he wrote a little of everything in it; and then I begged him to  read me something out of it, and he read me the story of Ursula and  Kenneth.\"    \"I don't see how you ever had the face,\" said Felicity; and even Cecily  looked as if she thought the Story Girl had gone rather far.    \"Never mind that,\" cried Felix, \"but tell us the story. That's the main  thing.\"    \"I'll tell it just as the Awkward Man read it, as far as I can,\" said  the Story Girl, \"but I can't put all his nice poetical touches in,  because I can't remember them all, though he read it over twice for me.\"          CHAPTER II. A WILL, A WAY AND A WOMAN      \"One day, over a hundred years ago, Ursula Townley was waiting for  Kenneth MacNair in a great beechwood, where brown nuts were falling  and an October wind was making the leaves dance on the ground like  pixy-people.\"    \"What are pixy-people?\" demanded Peter, forgetting the Story Girl's  dislike of interruptions.    \"Hush,\" whispered Cecily. \"That is only one of the Awkward Man's  poetical touches, I guess.\"    \"There were cultivated fields between the grove and the dark blue gulf;  but far behind and on each side were woods, for Prince Edward Island a  hundred years ago was not what it is today. The settlements were few and  scattered, and the population so scanty that old Hugh Townley boasted  that he knew every man, woman and child in it.    \"Old Hugh was quite a noted man in his day. He was noted for  several things--he was rich, he was hospitable, he was proud, he was  masterful--and he had for daughter the handsomest young woman in Prince  Edward Island.    \"Of course, the young men were not blind to her good looks, and she had  so many lovers that all the other girls hated her--\"    \"You bet!\" said Dan, aside--    \"But the only one who found favour in her eyes was the very last man she  should have pitched her fancy on, at least if old Hugh were the  judge. Kenneth MacNair was a dark-eyed young sea-captain of the next  settlement, and it was to meet him that Ursula stole to the beechwood on  that autumn day of crisp wind and ripe sunshine. Old Hugh had forbidden  his house to the young man, making such a scene of fury about it that  even Ursula's high spirit quailed. Old Hugh had really nothing against  Kenneth himself; but years before either Kenneth or Ursula was born,  Kenneth's father had beaten Hugh Townley in a hotly contested election.  Political feeling ran high in those days, and old Hugh had never  forgiven the MacNair his victory. The feud between the families dated  from that tempest in the provincial teapot, and the surplus of votes  on the wrong side was the reason why, thirty years after, Ursula had to  meet her lover by stealth if she met him at all.\"    \"Was the MacNair a Conservative or a Grit?\" asked Felicity.    \"It doesn't make any difference what he was,\" said the Story Girl  impatiently. \"Even a Tory would be romantic a hundred years ago. Well,  Ursula couldn't see Kenneth very often, for Kenneth lived fifteen miles  away and was often absent from home in his vessel. On this particular  day it was nearly three months since they had met.    \"The Sunday before, young Sandy MacNair had been in Carlyle church. He  had risen at dawn that morning, walked bare-footed for eight miles along  the shore, carrying his shoes, hired a harbour fisherman to row him over  the channel, and then walked eight miles more to the church at Carlyle,  less, it is to be feared, from a zeal for holy things than that he might  do an errand for his adored brother, Kenneth. He carried a letter which  he contrived to pass into Ursula's hand in the crowd as the people came  out. This letter asked Ursula to meet Kenneth in the beechwood the  next afternoon, and so she stole away there when suspicious father and  watchful stepmother thought she was spinning in the granary loft.\"    \"It was very wrong of her to deceive her parents,\" said Felicity primly.    The Story Girl couldn't deny this, so she evaded the ethical side of the  question skilfully.    \"I am not telling you what Ursula Townley ought to have done,\" she said  loftily. \"I am only telling you what she DID do. If you don't want to  hear it you needn't listen, of course. There wouldn't be many stories to  tell if nobody ever did anything she shouldn't do.    \"Well, when Kenneth came, the meeting was just what might have been  expected between two lovers who had taken their last kiss three months  before. So it was a good half-hour before Ursula said,    \"'Oh, Kenneth, I cannot stay long--I shall be missed. You said in your  letter that you had something important to talk of. What is it?'    \"'My news is this, Ursula. Next Saturday morning my vessel, The Fair  Lady, with her captain on board, sails at dawn from Charlottetown  harbour, bound for Buenos Ayres. At this season this means a safe and  sure return--next May.'    \"'Kenneth!' cried Ursula. She turned pale and burst into tears. 'How can  you think of leaving me? Oh, you are cruel!'    \"'Why, no, sweetheart,' laughed Kenneth. 'The captain of The Fair Lady  will take his bride with him. We'll spend our honeymoon on the high  seas, Ursula, and the cold Canadian winter under southern palms.'    \"'You want me to run away with you, Kenneth?' exclaimed Ursula.    \"'Indeed, dear girl, there's nothing else to do!'    \"'Oh, I cannot!' she protested. 'My father would--'    \"'We'll not consult him--until afterward. Come, Ursula, you know there's  no other way. We've always known it must come to this. YOUR father will  never forgive me for MY father. You won't fail me now. Think of the  long parting if you send me away alone on such a voyage. Pluck up your  courage, and we'll let Townleys and MacNairs whistle their mouldy feuds  down the wind while we sail southward in The Fair Lady. I have a plan.'    \"'Let me hear it,' said Ursula, beginning to get back her breath.    \"'There is to be a dance at The Springs Friday night. Are you invited,  Ursula?'    \"'Yes.'    \"'Good. I am not--but I shall be there--in the fir grove behind the  house, with two horses. When the dancing is at its height you'll steal  out to meet me. Then 'tis but a fifteen mile ride to Charlottetown,  where a good minister, who is a friend of mine, will be ready to marry  us. By the time the dancers have tired their heels you and I will be on  our vessel, able to snap our fingers at fate.'    \"'And what if I do not meet you in the fir grove?' said Ursula, a little  impertinently.    \"'If you do not, I'll sail for South America the next morning, and many  a long year will pass ere Kenneth MacNair comes home again.'    \"Perhaps Kenneth didn't mean that, but Ursula thought he did, and it  decided her. She agreed to run away with him. Yes, of course that was  wrong, too, Felicity. She ought to have said, 'No, I shall be married  respectably from home, and have a wedding and a silk dress and  bridesmaids and lots of presents.' But she didn't. She wasn't as prudent  as Felicity King would have been.\"    \"She was a shameless hussy,\" said Felicity, venting on the long-dead  Ursula that anger she dare not visit on the Story Girl.    \"Oh, no, Felicity dear, she was just a lass of spirit. I'd have done the  same. And when Friday night came she began to dress for the dance with  a brave heart. She was to go to The Springs with her uncle and aunt,  who were coming on horseback that afternoon, and would then go on to The  Springs in old Hugh's carriage, which was the only one in Carlyle then.  They were to leave in time to reach The Springs before nightfall, for  the October nights were dark and the wooded roads rough for travelling.    \"When Ursula was ready she looked at herself in the glass with a good  deal of satisfaction. Yes, Felicity, she was a vain baggage, that same  Ursula, but that kind didn't all die out a hundred years ago. And she  had good reason for being vain. She wore the sea-green silk which had  been brought out from England a year before and worn but once--at the  Christmas ball at Government House. A fine, stiff, rustling silk it was,  and over it shone Ursula's crimson cheeks and gleaming eyes, and masses  of nut brown hair. "]]]
