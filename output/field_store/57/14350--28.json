"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/26912"],[0,"Report of the Juvenile Delinquency Committee (#2)"],[1,"Superintendent of Child      Welfare would be enhanced if he were recognized as the head of his      own independent Department.    The arguments on the other side may be summarized in the following way:        (1) Child welfare by itself would make a relatively small      Department and as such it might tend to become inbred and to      stagnate.        (2) A separate Department of Child Welfare would cost more than at      present because it would not be able to rely upon some of the      staffing and administrative facilities of the Department of      Education.        (3) Some of the institutions now conducted or controlled by child      welfare are really schools and as such they would always need to be      under the real control of the Department of Education.        (4) In actual practice no one could define with precision where the      functions of child welfare could be separated from those of      education.        (5) Over the years child welfare and education have worked out      their own joint policy of administration. They have in fact worked      along in harmony and with effective co-operation, and there      appeared to be no sound reason for disturbing a set-up which was in      fact efficient, economical, and harmonious.    We were completely satisfied that the present arrangement has the full  support of the Director of Education and the Superintendent of Child  Welfare. This view has also the support of the Public Service  Commission. After a study of the evidence that was placed before us we  came to the unanimous conclusion that matters should be left as they  are.    If it was decided by Government that child welfare should remain linked  with the Department of Education it would be advisable that some form  of administrative procedure should be worked out to define the  relations between the Director of Education and the Superintendent of  Child Welfare in so far as their respective approaches to the Minister  of Education and the Minister of Social Welfare are concerned. It was  clear to us that the present set-up is both efficient and harmonious. A  detailed plan for the due performance of the various duties was worked  out and agreed to by all interested parties. As it is a purely  administrative matter, we have not felt that it was necessary to embody  it in this report. Suffice it to say that in our opinion child welfare  should remain a part of the Department of Education, that its  Superintendent should have a right of direct reference to the Minister  of Social Welfare, that the Minister of Social Welfare should be  directly responsible for the administration of the vote applicable to  the Child Welfare Division, and that the administrative plan placed  before us should be adopted and applied unless and until varied by  agreement between the Ministers concerned.      _Page 59, paragraph (c)_    Dr Beeby said:        \"It is true that no regulations have ever been gazetted prescribing      the duties of Child Welfare Officers. The provisions for them under      the Act are merely permissive, and we think it would be a      retrograde step to gazette any. The duties of the Superintendent      are adequately defined in the Act, and, as in other parts of the      Public Service, he delegates such of those powers as he thinks fit      to his subordinates. The Division's work has been done on this      basis since the passing of the Act, and we can recall no incident      where the absence of regulations has caused any difficulty. To      define the powers might well be to restrict them and to interfere      with the very preventive work we all desire.        \"There should, as the Committee suggests, be some mention of      Honorary Child Welfare Officers in the Act, but their powers,      again, are better given by delegation than by legislation. It is      very desirable that the extent to which use is made of an Honorary      Officer's services be allowed to vary with the requirements of the      district and the ability of the officer.\"    We agree with the views expressed above by Dr Beeby.      _Page 59, paragraph (d)_    The Mazengarb Committee pointed out that the practice and procedure of  the Children's Court may tend to vary from place to place throughout  the Dominion because the Court was not presided over by its own  specially appointed Magistrate.    On this point the Director of Education said:        \"This comment is true. The position has arisen because of the      practical difficulties of having the work carried out by specially      appointed Magistrates. The volume of work involved could justify      the appointment of only a few such Magistrates, and, because of the      geographical spread of the work, they could not handle it      expeditiously.\"    On this point we have no recommendations to make. We feel that the best  possible results are being secured by the Magistrates having regard to  their numbers and to the conditions under which they work.      _Page 59, paragraph (e)_    The Mazengarb Committee felt that it was a pity that proceedings in the  Children's Court were not conducted in a separate and distinct building.  It should at least be possible, said the report, to hear and determine  the cases in a room other than the ordinary Court room of a Magistrate's  Court. This was rather in the nature of a counsel of perfection. In  less-densely populated districts it would not be easy or economic to  provide separate accommodation of the kind envisaged. In larger and  busier centres it was often necessary to study the convenience of the  Magistrates themselves. The present Committee has no specific  recommendation to make in this connection.    The best that can be done is in fact being done.      _Page 60, paragraph (f)_    On the subject of the publicity to be given to proceedings in the  Children's Court the Mazengarb Committee said:        \"There may be reasons why a Children's Court should be open to the      public ... The public has a right to know how child offenders have      been dealt with. The Committee does not recommend any alteration in      the provision prohibiting the publication of the name of any child,      or of any name or particulars likely to lead to identification.      Subject to this, it is desirable that reporters should be allowed      to attend.\"    With these views we find ourselves to be in complete agreement.      _Page 60, paragraph (g)_    The Mazengarb Committee appeared to hold the view that when children  have been placed under supervision there was no adequate \"follow up\"  procedure.    The following is Dr Beeby's comment upon this paragraph:        \"It is a little difficult to see just what the Committee are      suggesting in this paragraph. If they are proposing that a Child      Welfare Officer be required to report progress to a Magistrate for      his personal information and to enable him to check on the      correctness of his judgment, there can be no possible objection.      When asked for, indeed, this is already done. If, on the other      hand, it is proposed that the Magistrate have continuing authority      over the child, then it would turn the Court into a social work      agency and would run counter to the whole trend in the development      of Children's Court and child welfare work from the beginning of      this century. The Magistrate would be compelled to take on      responsibilities for which he is not trained, and Child Welfare      Officers would tend to become merely junior probation officers      attached to the Court. One of the advantages of the present system      is that the Superintendent, being the final authority, can ensure      uniform standards of case work throughout New Zealand. If it were      left to each individual Magistrate to decide exactly what should be      done with children, it is certain that wide variations in      principles and procedures would occur. Experience has shown, for      example, that some Magistrates, with no first-hand knowledge of our      institutions, would send to them children for whom they are not      established to cater.        \"With regard to the Committee's suggestion that there 'should be      some person or body apart from the departmental officers to whom a      child could turn for help ...', we would agree that something like      the Visiting Justice system of the Justice Department might apply      to our institutions as a guarantee to the public and as a      protection to both children and officers. However, to extend such a      system to children boarded out in private homes would be to ask for      endless trouble. People would be loath to accept State wards into      their homes if it laid them open to official visits from laymen      whose sole function was to hear complaints from the children. The      visits of Child Welfare Officers and of Inspectors of the Division      must, we feel, be accepted as the main guarantee to the public of      fair treatment.\"    Without expressing any decided opinion, the Committee felt that  what the Director of Education has to say is worthy of consideration  by Government.      Certain Specific Changes Proposed by the Mazengarb Committee    In clause (5) on pages 60 to 63, both inclusive, of the report the  Mazengarb Committee recommended that certain specific changes be  made as soon as possible in the legislation relating to proceedings in  the Children's Court. It was our duty to examine and report upon  each of these suggestions. Our comments are as follow:        _Paragraph (a), page 61_ (creation of a new offence) and _paragraph      (b), page 61_ (the compulsory attendance of parents at a Children's      Court)    Both of these recommendations have been given effect to, and they  are provided for in the legislation enacted late in the session of 1954.          _Paragraph (c). page 61_ (power of Court to make orders against the      parents of offending or delinquent"]]]
