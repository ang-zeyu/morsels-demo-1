Under Louis XV the drama had been transformed into parades--parades  which were of as much importance to the people as to those who took  part in them. The spectators, hitherto silent, now began to hiss and be  moved. The scene of the comedy was changed, and the play was continued  among the spectators. The old theatre became an ante-chamber or a  dressing-room, and was no longer important except in connection with the  Cardinal de Bernis and the Duc de Richelieu, or Madame de Pompadour and  Madame du Barry.    The monarchy had still a step to take towards its downfall. It had  already created the _Pare aux Cerfs_ (Louis XV's seraglio), but had  not yet descended to the Parisian house of prostitution. It made this  descent leaning on the arm of Madame du Barry. Madame du Barry was a  moral sister to Manon Lescaut, but instead of taking herself off to  Louisiana to repent, she plunged into the golden whirlpool at Versailles  as a finish to her career. Could the coaches of a King mean more than  the ordinary carriage of an abandoned girl?    Jeanne Vaubernier--known in the bagnios by the name of Mademoiselle  Lange--was born at Vaucouleurs, as was Jeanne d'Arc. Better still, this  later Jeanne said openly at Versailles--dared she say otherwise?--that  she was descended in a straight line from the illustrious, the  venerated, the august, sacred, national maid, Jeanne. \"Why did Du Barry  come to Paris?'\" says Leon Gozlan in that account of the Chateau de  Lucienne which makes a brilliant and learned chapter in the history of  France. \"Does one ever know precisely why things are done? She obeyed  the magnet which attracts to Paris all who in themselves have a title to  glory, to celebrity, or to misfortune. Du Barry had a pretty, provincial  face, bright and charming, a face astonished at everything, hair soft  and ash-colored, blue eyes, veiled and half open, and a skin fair with  rose tints. She was a child of destiny. Who could have said, when she  crossed the great town in her basket cart, which rolled lazily along  on its massive, creaking wheels, that some day she would have equipages  more beautiful than any of those which covered her with mud in passing,  and on her arms more laces and diamonds than any of these ladies  attended by footmen in liveries?\"    When Jeanne left the provinces to come to Paris, she found her native  country. She was granted the freedom of the city, and expanded in  her joy like a delicate plant transplanted into a hothouse. She found  herself at home for the first time; and felt that she could rule as a  despot over all frequenters of the streets. She learned fashion and  love at one and the same time. Gourdan had a hat made for her, and, as  a reward, initiated her into the customs. But she was called to other  destinies.    One day, when she was walking in the Tuileries, a lunatic--and lunatics  have second sight--asked her favor when she should become queen. Du  Barry said to herself: \"This man is mad.\" But then she thought of the  Pompadour, blushed--it was the only time--and turned her eyes towards  Versailles.    But Versailles was an unhoped-for shore to such a girl as this, a girl  known to all Paris. Would the King care to be the lover of one who had  ruled all his courtesans? Who could say? The King often wearied of what  he had. Had not a poet already been found who compared her to Venus:         O Jeanne, thy beauty seduces       And charms the whole world;       In vain does the duchess redden       And the princess growl;       They know that Venus rides proudly       The foam of the wave.    The poet, while not Voltaire, was no less a man than Bouffiers.    While the King was seeking a mistress--a nocturnal reverse of Diogenes,  fleeing from the lanterns of the wise--he found Jeanne Vaubernier. He  thought he could love her for one evening. \"Not enough,\" said she, \"you  must love me until"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/25646"],[0,"Child's Health Primer For Primary Classes (#2)"],[1,"into shape. In this way, you may grow  round-shouldered or hump-backed.    This bending over, also cramps the lungs, so that they do not have all  the room they need for breathing. While you are young, your bones are  easily bent. One shoulder or one hip gets higher than the other, if you  stand unevenly. This is more serious, because you are growing, and you  may grow crooked before you know it.    Now that you know how soft your bones are, and how easily they bend, you  will surely be careful to sit and stand erect. Do not twist your legs,  or arms, or shoulders; for you want to grow into straight and graceful  men and women, instead of being round-shouldered, or hump-backed, or  lame, all your lives.    When people are old, their bones contain more lime, and, therefore,  break more easily.    You should be kindly helpful to old people, so that they may not fall,  and possibly break their bones.      CARE OF THE FEET.    Healthy children are always out-growing their shoes, and sometimes  faster than they wear them out. Tight shoes cause corns and in-growing  nails and other sore places on the feet. All of these are very hard to  get rid of. No one should wear a shoe that pinches or hurts the foot.      OUGHT A BOY TO USE TOBACCO?    Perhaps some boy will say: \"Grown people are always telling us, 'this  will do for men, but it is not good for boys.'\"    Tobacco is not good for men; but there is a very good reason why it is  worse for boys.    If you were going to build a house, would it be wise for you to put into  the stone-work of the cellar something that would make it less strong?    Something into the brick-work or the mortar, the wood-work or the nails,  the walls or the chimneys, that would make them weak and tottering,  instead of strong and steady?    It would he had enough if you should repair your house with poor  materials; but surely it must be built in the first place with the best  you can get.    You will soon learn that boys and girls are building their bodies, day  after day, until at last they reach full size.    Afterward, they must be repaired as fast as they wear out.    It would be foolish to build any part in a way to make it weaker than  need be.    Wise doctors have said that the boy who uses tobacco while he is  growing, makes every part of his body less strong than it otherwise  would be. Even his bones will not grow so well.    Boys who smoke can not become such large, fine-looking men as they would  if they did not smoke.    Cigarettes are small, but they are very poisonous. Chewing tobacco is a  worse and more filthy habit even than smoking. The frequent spitting it  causes is disgusting to others and hurts the health of the chewer.  Tobacco in any form is a great enemy to youth. It stunts the growth,  hurts the mind, and cripples in every way the boy or girl who uses it.    Not that it does all this to every youth who smokes, but it is always  true that no boy of seven to fourteen can begin to smoke or chew and  have so fine a body and mind when he is twenty-one years old as he would  have had if he had never used tobacco. If you want to be strong and well  men and women, do not use tobacco in any form.      REVIEW QUESTIONS.              1. What two kinds of joints have you?              2.

[Illustration: W]HAT makes the limbs move?    You have to take hold of the door to move it back and forth; but you  need not take hold of your arm to move that.    What makes it move?    Sometimes a door or gate is made to shut itself, if you leave it open.    This can be done by means of a wide rubber strap, one end of which is  fastened to the frame of the door near the hinge, and the other end to  the door, out near its edge.    When we push open the door, the rubber strap is stretched; but as soon  as we have passed through, the strap tightens, draws the door back, and  shuts it.    If you stretch out your right arm, and clasp the upper part tightly with  your left hand, then work the elbow joint strongly back and forth, you  can feel something under your hand draw up, and then lengthen out again,  each time you bend the joint.    What you feel, is a muscle (m[)u]s'sl), and it works your joints very  much as the rubber strap works the hinge of the door.    One end of the muscle is fastened to the bone just below the elbow  joint; and the other end, higher up above the joint.    When it tightens, or contracts, as we say, it bends the joint. When the  arm is straightened, the muscle returns to its first shape.    There is another muscle on the outside of the arm which stretches when  this one shortens, and so helps the working of the joint.    Every joint has two or more muscles of its own to work it.    Think how many there must be in our fingers!    If we should undertake to count all the muscles that move our whole  bodies, it would need more counting than some of you could do.      TENDONS.    You can see muscles on the dinner table; for they are only lean meat.    [Illustration: _Tendons of the hand._]    They are fastened to the bones by strong cords, called tendons  (t[)e]n'd[)o]nz). These tendons can be seen in the leg of a chicken or  turkey. They sometimes hold the meat so firmly that it is hard for you  to get it off. When you next try to pick a \"drum-stick,\" remember that  you are eating the strong muscles by which the chicken or turkey moved  his legs as he walked about the yard. The parts that have the most work  to do, need the strongest muscles.    Did you ever see the swallows flying about the eaves of a barn?    Do they have very stout legs? No! They have very small legs and feet,  because they do not need to walk. They need to fly.    The muscles that move the wings are fastened to the breast. These breast  muscles of the swallow must be large and strong.      EXERCISE OF THE MUSCLES.    People who work hard with any part of the body make the muscles of that  part very strong.    The blacksmith has big, strong muscles in his arms because he uses them  so much.    You are using your muscles every day, and this helps them to grow.    Once I saw a little girl who had been very sick. She had to lie in bed  for many weeks. Before her sickness she had plenty of stout muscles in  her arms and legs and was running about the house from morning till  night, carrying her big doll in her arms.    After her sickness, she could hardly walk ten steps, and would rather  sit and look at her playthings than try to lift them. She had to make  new muscles as fast as possible.    Running, coasting, games of ball, and all brisk play and work, help to  make strong muscles.    Idle habits make weak muscles. So idleness is an enemy to the muscles.    There is another enemy to the muscles about which I must tell you.      WHAT ALCOHOL WILL DO TO THE MUSCLES.    Muscles are lean meat. Fat meat could not work your joints for you as  the muscles do. Alcohol often changes a part of the muscles to fat, and  so takes away a part of their strength. In this way, people often grow  very fleshy from drinking beer, because it contains alcohol, as you will  soon learn. But they can not work any better on account of having this  fat. They are not really any stronger for it.      REVIEW QUESTIONS.              1. How are the joints moved?              2. Where are the muscles in your arms, which help            you to move your elbows?              3. Show why joints must have muscles.              4.

What makes the muscles of the blacksmith's arm            so strong?              9. What will make your muscles strong?              10. What will make them weak?              11.
