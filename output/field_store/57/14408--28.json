Such a life is necessarily a happy one, because  it is one _full_ of goodness. There is daily joy in such daily activity.  No man can be wretched while acting from the principle of communicative  goodness. Such are happy whatever their sphere or occupation may be.  Their aims are high. Their objects sustain them and their impulses  encourage or strengthen them. Their anticipations are joyous and their  reflections are tranquil. They look backward with delight and forward  with hope. Their conscience approves them. They have not buried their  talents. They are not encumberers of the ground.    They live to bless the children of men. When they die they will to them  their counsel, their example and prayers. Benevolent habits are a great  source of happiness, for which we are indebted to the religion of  Christ.    It is vain to attempt to persuade ourselves that human misery does not  exist. We can not get away from it by arming ourselves with stoical  insensibility. Evils lie all about us; we ourselves are made to feel  them. If we open our eyes upon the pages of time we see a continuous  series of beings who appear for a short time and then pass away. Their  beds are bedewed with tears, and soon the emblems of death are hung  about their doors. O, what wonderful scenes lie between the cradle and  the grave! What hours of sadness and gloom! Here, in the midst of life,  we realize disappointments, losses, painful diseases and heart-rending  discouragements, defeated hopes and withered honors. Here are good  reasons for the interposition of redeeming love. Does the God who loves  us sympathize with us in our woes? We are liable at every step in life  to great individual and domestic calamities. No hour can be free from  the fear that what we value the most on the earth may be snatched away  to-morrow.    Trees and flowers grow to their full stature, fill up their measure of  time, and pass away. Beasts and birds are more rarely cut off with  disease. Their lives are not embittered with the expectation of death;  the knowledge of the past and the present is all they have; they have no  knowledge of the morrow; they live contented in their ignorance and  indifference, and, at last, sink into the deep, unending night, \"being  made to be taken and destroyed.\"    But this is not the history of man. He perishes from the cradle to the  tomb--\"suffers a hundred deaths in fearing one.\" He is conscious of the  dangers that beset him. He is hedged in on every side. Death is  constantly destroying his fondest hopes and causing him the sorest  grief. It bursts the ties that bind heart to heart, and the dearest  fellowships are severed, and the joys of a blessed life are wrapped in  the gloom of death. All there was of earthly bliss in the bygone now  makes up his anguish. Is it possible that life and death walk  \"arm-in-arm?\" Yes; even while we are happy in the enjoyment of one, the  other comes and casts the fearful mantle over all our earthly prospects.  Seal up this blessed volume of life, and I know not from whence the  light is to spring which would cheer this gloomy picture. Without this,  man would be in a grade of blessedness beneath the brutes that perish.  It would be better to be anything than rational without the religion of  Jesus Christ and the intelligence of the Bible. The Scriptures inform us  that these things have a cause, that they come from God's dealings with  his creatures, that the unseen hand which permits these trials is  benevolent and wise. Sorrow has its design, and it is neither unkind nor  malignant. These things have a moral cause; they are the great rebuke of  God for sin. They are also a part of the discipline of a Heavenly  Father, designed to co-operate with the Gospel in bringing back all  those who are intelligently exercised thereby to their forsaken God.    The antidote for all these ills culminating in death was the tree of  life. When man sinned against his God he was put away from the tree of  life. If he had remained with it he would have been beyond the reach of  the motive of life, and beyond the restraining power of the fear of  death. He would have lived forever, subject, like fallen angels, to  mental suffering during the ages to come. But being placed beyond the  reach of the tree of life he may be redeemed by the love of life to a  higher state. When the rebellious see and realize this great truth,  being exercised by the chastening hand of God, they are often subdued to  submission, to peace, and under the heaviest calamities they often look  upward and say, \"It is the Lord, let his will be done.\" And this, of  itself, is a source of unbounded bliss.    We often submit to present pain when counseled to do so by those in  whose wisdom and goodness we trust. As Christians we extend this  principle to all the sufferings of this life. Doing so, we have that  feeling of quiet submission growing out of permanent confidence in God  which supports us under all the trials to which we have been subjected  by an all-wise Father. This principle is wonderfully fruitful in  consolations to the bereaved and mourning--it is the joy of all  Christian hearts. \"The Lord reigneth, let the earth rejoice.\" What shall  we say of the hopes and prospects of bereaved souls? Is it blind  conjecture that there is an existence beyond the shadows? Is there no  life to come? No great resurrection? No comforter to arrest the current  of mourning and lamentation?    How natural it is, when reminded of our loss, to exclaim, Shall we not  meet them again? Is this parting to last forever? Is there a God? Has he  not answered this agonizing inquiry? When we sit down upon the brink of  those waters which have swallowed up our living treasures and weep and  call upon the waves of eternity to give back our dear ones, when, from  the shores of time, we look and gaze and listen, does no voice reach us?  _Yes!_ To the ear of faith there is a voice. It is the voice of our God.  We listen. The words come ringing in our hearts, \"For if we believe that  Jesus died and rose again, even so them also which sleep in Jesus will  God bring with him.\" _Our grief is allayed._ We believe and are  comforted. We look forward to a happy meeting. A reunion for eternity  hovers before us like a bright star, lights up our pathway, and leads us  forward in a living hope.    Nowhere in the Bible is human sorrow clothed with cold indifference. The  counsels of that book and its promises are so adapted to the sorrowing  that those who have passed through the furnace of affliction know best  their value. There is no such relief from sorrow found away from the  faith of God and the Bible.    There is an hour when we _ourselves_ must die? Shall we trifle with the  will of God till then? Can we trifle with death when it comes? \"The  sting of death is sin.\" Death never fails to bring along with it a keen  sense of guilt to the guilty unless they are cut off in a moment, and  then who knows the anguish that may be experienced just beyond? What is  there to soothe the sorrow of the dying sinner?--of that wicked soul who  never obeyed his God nor did anything to make the world better for his  existence? Let none of us live at a distance from our God. Let none of  us approach death without the necessary preparation for mutual  association with him. Let none of us bear the burden of a guilty  conscience in that hour. May none of us be so cruel as to leave the  hearts that love us in doubt respecting our condition in death. May we  never tread its dark waters without the light of the glorious promises  and facts of the religion of Jesus the Christ. Let us keep our souls  pure in obeying the truth through the Spirit. Let us live with and obey  God, do good and be happy.          INDEBTEDNESS TO REVELATION--No. II.    BY P. T. RUSSELL.      Thought, Thinkers, Things--realities with their qualities or attributes.  These are all connected. If the first and second are present the others  are not far away. We only think when we perceive, and only perceive  realities. Nonentities are not perceivable, and therefore not thinkable.  Thoughts may be, and are, transferable from one to another by words, or  signs equivalent to words, yet we are only able to impart to another  ideas already in our possession.    We have no thoughts of our own but those which are the result of our  perceiving. We have no thought of color without the eye, nor of sound  without the ear, etc. Now, if we have in our possession thoughts of  persons or things beyond the reach of our powers of observation, _i.e._,  beyond the reach of the five senses--seeing, hearing, feeling, tasting  and smelling--then those thoughts can not be ours; we could not be the  first to think them; they were too high for us; they were out of our  reach. Who, then, could and did reach them and give them to us? This  ought to be the question of questions with us. Thoughts of foreign  countries have been given to us by the men who have seen those  countries. But they could only give us ideas of what they had seen or  others had told them. A man visiting England only could give us no  thought of Russia, unless instructed by some one who has seen that land;  then, and not till then, could he give us thoughts of Russia. I am now  ready for the statement of this proposition, viz: The following trio of  thoughts are beyond our reach. They are not our thoughts; we did not  think them, but we have them; then, some being who could see higher and  look farther than we must have given them to us. Those thoughts are the  following: First, the existence of God; second, the use of words; third,  the origin of religion. These I will"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/28669"],[0,"The Christian Foundation, Or, Scientific and Religious Journal, Volume I, No. 8, (#2)"],[1,"eature\"--a creature living by  a faith, which worketh by love. It is not simply wishing you were a new  creature; not simply wishing for a working faith; nor sorrowing because  you are not a Christian; but \"keeping the commandments of God,\" that  will permit you to enter heaven.    In the final closing of the New Testament writings it is said: \"Blessed  are they who do his commandments, that they may have right to the tree  of life and enter in through the gates into the city.\"    Paul says, \"Follow peace with all men and holiness, without which no man  shall see the Lord.\" And Peter says, \"Add to your faith virtue, and to  virtue knowledge, and to knowledge temperance, and to temperance  patience, and to patience godliness, and to godliness brotherly  kindness, and to brotherly kindness charity\"--and finally says, if ye do  these things ye shall never fall, for so an abundant entrance shall be  ministered unto you into the everlasting kingdom of our Lord and Savior  Jesus Christ. And John says, speaking of the Christian's hope, \"Every  man that hath this hope in him purifieth himself even as he is pure;\"  then the impure may flatter themselves, and presume upon the favor of  God without \"purifying their souls in obeying the truth,\" but they are  without hope in the world. And again he says, \"Little children let no  man deceive you, he that doth righteousness is righteous, even as he is  righteous.\"    So all the writers and teachers of the New Testament, with one consent,  proclaim the necessity of obeying the commandments of the gospel. What a  vain whim it is to think that sorrow and mere intention without  reformation of life will admit you into heaven. This golden dream of  heaven has sent thousands out of this world unpardoned and unsaved.    A great many persons satisfy themselves with a mere confession and  acknowledgement of their sins. They seem to think they have done enough,  if to confession of sins they add some sorrow for it. They think all is  well if, when their fit of sinning is past and they are returned to  themselves, the sting remains, breeding some remorse of conscience, some  complaints against their wickedness and folly for having done so, and  some intentions to forsake it, though never carried into effect. There  are many persons in the churches of our country who seem to think the  church is a stage, whereon they must play their parts, who make a  profession every day of confessing their sins with humble hearts, and  yet, after having spent twenty, thirty or forty years in this manner,  their hearts are as stubborn as ever, and they as impenitent and  disobedient to the gospel of Jesus Christ. If giving thanks to God for  the blessing received at his hands is performed with words only, with  simple hosannas, and hallelujahs, and \"_gloria patris_,\" and psalms, and  hymns, then I presume it is done very efficiently, (?) though our lives  are provoking to his majesty. _It is not the office of a friend (?) to  bewail a friend with vain lamentation._ To be thankful to God is not to  say God be praised, or God be thanked, but it is to remember what he  desires and execute what he commands. A dying Roman once said, \"It is  not the office of a friend to bewail a dead friend with vain  lamentations, but to remember what he desires and execute his commands.  It is the office of the friends of Christ to remember his desires and  carry out his instructions. If we do so we are thankful, and if we do  not our thankfulness is nothing more than mere talk.\"    Jesus said to his disciples: \"Ye are my friends if ye do what I command  you.\" And again: \"If a man love me he will keep my words; he that loveth  me not, keepeth not my sayings.\" Again: \"If ye continue in my word, then  are ye my disciples indeed, and ye shall know the truth, and the truth  shall make you free.\"    Those who love God love his cause. When that cause prospers they  rejoice; when it declines they are hurt. When clouds and darkness are  round about the church it is time to double our diligence and pray to  God for help. Circumstances, over which no human being can have control,  sometimes cause sluggishness in the character of a church. The hearts of  God's people are often deeply affected by witnessing the indifference  and carelessness of the people, and still more affected by a falling off  in their numbers. When the godly man ceaseth and the faithful fail from  among the children of men, it is distressing; but such is the lot of man  that we are often called upon to witness the truthfulness of the  prophet's statement. All true Christians love the godly because they are  faithful. The term _faithful_ implies truth, sincerity and fidelity.  Christ, our great example, is called the faithful and true witness. The  use of the term in our religion indicates believers in Christ--_obedient  believers_--_faithful brethren in Christ_. Col. i: 2. Sometimes it is  equivalent to the word _true_, as in 2d Tim., ii: 2--\"Faithful men;\" the  fidelity of the persons alluded to had been tried--_proven_. And again,  it means a Christian, in opposition to an infidel, as in 2d Cor. vi:  15--\"What part hath he that believeth with an infidel?\" A good man is  faithful in his business transactions; faithful to his _profession_,  adhering to the principles of the gospel and laboring to be faithful to  death; faithful in the discharge of his duties; faithful in the  employment of his talents; faithful in all things committed to his  trust; faithful to his promises; faithful in his friendship. These men  fail and cease by means of death. The fathers, where are they? And the  teachers, do they live forever? The visitations of death are often  mysterious to us. Sometimes the most brilliant in intellect and the most  useful in talent, also the most pious and useful in the church, are cut  down, while mere cumberers of the ground remain.    The profession of some is only transient; they soon disappear from the  assembly of the saints. Some improper motive, some peculiar excitement  may have moved them, or their goodness of heart may have left them. They  have possibly been stony ground hearers or thorny ground hearers. The  world allures thousands and kills the vitality of their religion.    Judas betrayed his master from the love of worldly gain; and Demas, an  acceptable preacher and companion of Paul, abandoned his profession,  \"having loved the present world.\"    Many fail by endeavoring to unite the world and their religion,  maintaining a good moral character, but are destitute of energy in  Christianity.    When this spirit gets hold of a man, and he is disposed to secularize  his religion, or subordinate it to his worldly interests, he is sure to  fail sooner or later. Some fail by falling into temptations of various  kinds, and disgrace their profession; and some fail through  intemperance. Many fail through the influence of error and the enemies  of Christianity. These frequently beguile the unwary.    There never was a time in our history when unbelief and skepticism was  more determined in its opposition to the Christian religion than at the  present. There is an incessant attempt to instill into the minds of the  young principles in opposition to, and destructive of Christianity. Many  have split upon the rocks of infidelity, and stranded upon the  quicksands of doubt and skepticism, in spite of the fact that  Christianity presented them an example, which is the light and life of  men--a character without a blot! And this example is the only foundation  upon which to build a moral and pious temple in which the Lord does, and  the creature may dwell.          OUR INDEBTEDNESS TO REVELATION--THE TEN ATHEISTS IN COUNCIL--No. II.    BY P.T. RUSSEL.      A rap is heard at the door. It being opened, Christian enters. \"Good  morning, gentlemen. I am very glad to find you all here. Since our  former interview I have been very anxious to continue our investigation  of the evidence of the existence of God. I presume, as you are  '_Free-thinkers_' and lovers of truth, you are by this time ready to  give a scientific reason for the existence of the idea of God, and, as  you agree with me that we only obtain ideas through the aid of the five  senses, our only idea of color by the eye, of sound by the ear, etc., I  wish to ask you to account for the idea of God. Will you oblige me?\"    _Atheists_--Certainly. We have consulted on this theme since our last  interview, and now declare it to be the work or nature of the  imagination. It is a scientific truth, as you will readily admit, that  imagination can and does get up some singular and unreal forms. We now  assume that the idea of a God is but the thought of an imaginary being.    _Christian_--True, gentlemen. Fancy, or imagination, does, in active  moments, bring for our amusement some fantastic pictures. Her work,  however, is never simple, but always complex. This that we are in search  of is the idea of a simple being--a being that is single, and not  duplex. I will now illustrate the extent of the power of the  imagination. Taking a walk through nature's flower garden, we gather one  of every variety, and examining them closely, one by one, we notice  their difference in form, color and size by the eye. Their fragrance we  note by the smell. Thus, by the aid of the senses, we note all their  sensible properties. Now, allowing that memory is perfect, we have in  store all the peculiarities of each and every individual flower.  Gentlemen atheists, am I correct in this conclusion?    _Atheists_--Well, yes.    _Christian_--Very well; then I'll proceed. Having learned, by what we  saw, the art of combining, we can and will imagine all these single  flowers blended in one large conglomerated flower, containing all the  peculiarities of each and every single flower. Now, gentlemen, is not  this all that the imagination can do?    _Atheists_--It is.    _Christian_--Very well. Is this a simple or compound"]]]
