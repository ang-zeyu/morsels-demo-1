There was now riding off in all directions to the doctor's, to the  farrier's, and no doubt to Squire Gordon's, to let him know about his  son. When Mr. Bond, the farrier, came to look at the black horse that  lay groaning on the grass, he felt him all over, and shook his head; one  of his legs was broken. Then some one ran to our master's house and came  back with a gun; presently there was a loud bang and a dreadful shriek,  and then all was still; the black horse moved no more.    My mother seemed much troubled; she said she had known that horse for  years, and that his name was \"Rob Roy\"; he was a good horse, and  there was no vice in him. She never would go to that part of the field  afterward.    Not many days after we heard the church-bell tolling for a long time,  and looking over the gate we saw a long, strange black coach that was  covered with black cloth and was drawn by black horses; after that came  another and another and another, and all were black, while the bell kept  tolling, tolling. They were carrying young Gordon to the churchyard to  bury him. He would never ride again. What they did with Rob Roy I never  knew; but 'twas all for one little hare.          03 My Breaking In      I was now beginning to grow handsome; my coat had grown fine and soft,  and was bright black. I had one white foot and a pretty white star on my  forehead. I was thought very handsome; my master would not sell me till  I was four years old; he said lads ought not to work like men, and colts  ought not to work like horses till they were quite grown up.    When I was four years old Squire Gordon came to look at me. He examined  my eyes, my mouth, and my legs; he felt them all down; and then I had  to walk and trot and gallop before him. He seemed to like me, and said,  \"When he has been well broken in he will do very well.\" My master said  he would break me in himself, as he should not like me to be frightened  or hurt, and he lost no time about it, for the next day he began.    Every one may not know what breaking in is, therefore I will describe  it. It means to teach a horse to wear a saddle and bridle, and to carry  on his back a man, woman or child; to go just the way they wish, and to  go quietly. Besides this he has to learn to wear a collar, a crupper,  and a breeching, and to stand still while they are put on; then to have  a cart or a chaise fixed behind, so that he cannot walk or trot without  dragging it after him; and he must go fast or slow, just as his driver  wishes. He must never start at what he sees, nor speak to other horses,  nor bite, nor kick, nor have any will of his own; but always do his  master's will, even though he may be very tired or hungry; but the worst  of all is, when his harness is once on, he may neither jump for joy nor  lie down for weariness. So you see this breaking in is a great thing.    I had of course long been used to a halter and a headstall, and to be  led about in the fields and lanes quietly, but now I was to have a bit  and bridle; my master gave me some oats as usual, and after a good deal  of coaxing he got the bit into my mouth, and the bridle fixed, but it  was a nasty thing! Those who have never had a bit in their mouths cannot  think how bad it feels; a great piece of cold hard steel as thick as  a man's finger to be pushed into one's mouth, between one's teeth, and  over one's tongue, with the ends coming out at the corner of your mouth,  and held fast there by straps over your head, under your throat, round  your nose, and under your chin; so that no way in the world can you get  rid of the nasty hard thing; it is very bad! yes, very bad! at least I  thought so; but I knew my mother always wore one when she went out, and  all horses did when they were grown up; and so, what with the nice oats,  and what with my master's pats, kind words, and gentle ways, I got to  wear my bit and bridle.    Next came the saddle, but that was not half so bad; my master put it  on my back very gently, while old Daniel held my head; he then made the  girths fast under my body, patting and talking to me all the time; then  I had a few oats, then a little leading about; and this he did every  day till I began to look for the oats and the saddle. At length, one  morning, my master got on my back and rode me round the meadow on the  soft grass. It certainly did feel queer; but I must say I felt rather  proud to carry my master, and as he continued to ride me a little every  day I soon became accustomed to it.    The next unpleasant business was putting on the iron shoes; that too was  very hard at first. My master went with me to the smith's forge, to see  that I was not hurt or got any fright. The blacksmith took my feet in  his hand, one after the other, and cut away some of the hoof. It did not  pain me, so I stood still on three legs till he had done them all. Then  he took a piece of iron the shape of my foot, and clapped it on, and  drove some nails through the shoe quite into my hoof, so that the shoe  was firmly on. My feet felt very stiff and heavy, but in time I got used  to it.    And now having got so far, my master went on to break me to harness;  there were more new things to wear. First, a stiff heavy collar just  on my neck, and a bridle with great side-pieces against my eyes called  blinkers, and blinkers indeed they were, for I could not see on either  side, but only straight in front of me; next, there was a small saddle  with a nasty stiff strap that went right under my tail; that was the  crupper. I hated the crupper; to have my long tail doubled up and poked  through that strap was almost as bad as the bit. I never felt more like  kicking, but of course I could not kick such a good master, and so  in time I got used to everything, and could do my work as well as my  mother.    I must not forget to mention one part of my training, which I have  always considered a very great advantage. My master sent me for a  fortnight to a neighboring farmer's, who had a meadow which was skirted  on one side by the railway. Here were some sheep and cows, and I was  turned in among them.    I shall never forget the first train that ran by. I was feeding quietly  near the pales which separated the meadow from the railway, when I heard  a strange sound at a distance, and before I knew whence it came--with  a rush and a clatter, and a puffing out of smoke--a long black train of  something flew by, and was gone almost before I could draw my breath. I  turned and galloped to the further side of the meadow as fast as I could  go, and there I stood snorting with astonishment and fear. In the course  of the day many other trains went by, some more slowly; these drew up  at the station close by, and sometimes made an awful shriek and groan  before they stopped. I thought it very dreadful, but the cows went  on eating very quietly, and hardly raised their heads as the black  frightful thing came puffing and grinding past.    For the first few days I could not feed in peace; but as I found that  this terrible creature never came into the field, or did me any harm, I  began to disregard it, and very soon I cared as little about the passing  of a train as the cows and sheep did.    Since then I have seen many horses much alarmed and restive at the sight  or sound of a steam engine; but thanks to my good master's care, I am as  fearless at railway stations as in my own stable.    Now if any one wants to break in a young horse well, that is the way.    My master often drove me in double harness with my mother, because she  was steady and could teach me how to go better than a strange horse. She  told me the better I behaved the better I should be treated, and that  it was wisest always to do my best to please my master; \"but,\" said she,  \"there are a great many kinds of men; there are good thoughtful men like  our master, that any horse may be proud to serve; and there are bad,  cruel men, who never ought to have a horse or dog to call their own.  Besides, there are a great many foolish men, vain, ignorant, and  careless, who never trouble themselves to think; these spoil more horses  than all, just for want of sense; they don't mean it, but they do it for  all that. I hope you will fall into good hands; but a horse never knows  who may buy him, or who may drive him; it is all a chance for us; but  still I say, do your best wherever it is, and keep up your good name.\"          04 Birtwick Park      At this time I used to stand in the stable and my coat was brushed every  day till it shone like a rook's wing. It was early in May, when there  came a man from Squire Gordon's, who took me away to the hall. My master  said, \"Good-by, Darkie; be a good horse, and always do your best.\" I  could not say \"good-by\", so I put my nose into his hand; he patted me  kindly, and I left my first home. As I lived some years with Squire  Gordon, I may as well tell something about the place.    Squire Gordon's park skirted the village of Birtwick. It was entered by  a large iron gate, at which stood the first lodge, and then you trotted  along on a smooth road between clumps of large old trees; then another  lodge and another gate, which brought you to the house and the gardens.  Beyond this lay the home paddock, the old orchard, and the stables.  There was accommodation for many horses and carriages; but I need only  describe the stable into which I was taken; this was very roomy, with  four good stalls; a large swinging window opened into the yard, which  made it pleasant and airy.    The first stall was a large square one, shut in behind with a wooden  gate; the others were common stalls, good stalls, but not nearly so  large; it had a low rack for hay and a low manger for corn; it was  called a loose box, because the horse that was put into it was not tied  up, but left loose, to do as he liked.

Fouquet rushes to the king, and gives him Belle-Isle as a  present, thus allaying any suspicion, and at the same time humiliating  Colbert, just minutes before the usher announces someone else seeking an  audience with the king.    Ten Years Later (Etext 2681): As 1661 approaches, Princess Henrietta of  England arrives for her marriage, and throws the court of France into  complete disorder. The jealousy of the Duke of Buckingham, who is  in love with her, nearly occasions a war on the streets of Le Havre,  thankfully prevented by Raoul's timely and tactful intervention. After  the marriage, though, Monsieur Philip becomes horribly jealous of  Buckingham, and has him exiled. Before leaving, however, the duke  fights a duel with M. de Wardes at Calais. De Wardes is a malicious and  spiteful man, the sworn enemy of D'Artagnan, and, by the same token,  that of Athos, Aramis, Porthos, and Raoul as well. Both men are  seriously wounded, and the duke is taken back to England to recover.  Raoul's friend, the Comte de Guiche, is the next to succumb to  Henrietta's charms, and Monsieur obtains his exile as well, though De  Guiche soon effects a reconciliation. But then the king's eye falls on  Madame Henrietta during the comte's absence, and this time Monsieur's  jealousy has no recourse. Anne of Austria intervenes, and the king and  his sister-in-law decide to pick a young lady with whom the king  can pretend to be in love, the better to mask their own affair. They  unfortunately select Louise de la Valliere, Raoul's fiancee. While the  court is in residence at Fontainebleau, the king unwitting overhears  Louise confessing her love for him while chatting with her friends  beneath the royal oak, and the king promptly forgets his affection for  Madame. That same night, Henrietta overhears, at the same oak, De  Guiche confessing his love for her to Raoul. The two embark on their  own affair. A few days later, during a rainstorm, Louis and Louise  are trapped alone together, and the whole court begins to talk of the  scandal while their love affair blossoms. Aware of Louise's attachment,  the king arranges for Raoul to be sent to England for an indefinite  period.    Meanwhile, the struggle for power continues between Fouquet and Colbert.  Although the Belle-Isle plot backfired, Colbert prompts the king to ask  Fouquet for more and more money, and without his two friends to raise it  for him, Fouquet is sorely pressed. The situation gets so bad that his  new mistress, Madame de Belliere, must resort to selling all her jewels  and her gold and silver plate. Aramis, while this is going on, has grown  friendly with the governor of the Bastile, M. de Baisemeaux, a fact that  Baisemeaux unwittingly reveals to D'Artagnan while inquiring of him  as to Aramis's whereabouts. This further arouses the suspicions of the  musketeer, who was made to look ridiculous by Aramis. He had ridden  overnight at an insane pace, but arrived a few minutes after Fouquet  had already presented Belle-Isle to the king. Aramis learns from the  governor the location of a mysterious prisoner, who bears a remarkable  resemblance to Louis XIV--in fact, the two are identical. He uses  the existence of this secret to persuade a dying Franciscan monk, the  general of the society of the Jesuits, to name him, Aramis, the new  general of the order. On Aramis's advice, hoping to use Louise's  influence with the king to counteract Colbert's influence, Fouquet also  writes a love letter to La Valliere, unfortunately undated. It never  reaches its destination, however, as the servant ordered to deliver it  turns out to be an agent of Colbert's.    Porthos, in the meantime, has been recovering from his midnight ride  from Belle-Isle at Fouquet's residence at Saint-Mande. Athos has  retired, once again to La Fere. D'Artagnan, little amused by the court's  activities at Fontainebleau, and finding himself with nothing to do, has  returned to Paris, and we find him again in Planchet's grocery shop.    And so, the story continues in this, the third etext of The Vicomte de  Bragelonne. Enjoy!    John Bursey          Chapter I. Malaga.    During all these long and noisy debates between the opposite ambitions  of politics and love, one of our characters, perhaps the one least  deserving of neglect, was, however, very much neglected, very much  forgotten, and exceedingly unhappy. In fact, D'Artagnan--D'Artagnan,  we say, for we must call him by his name, to remind our readers of his  existence--D'Artagnan, we repeat, had absolutely nothing whatever to do,  amidst these brilliant butterflies of fashion. After following the king  during two whole days at Fontainebleau, and critically observing  the various pastoral fancies and heroi-comic transformations of his  sovereign, the musketeer felt that he needed something more than this to  satisfy the cravings of his nature. At every moment assailed by  people asking him, \"How do you think this costume suits me, Monsieur  d'Artagnan?\" he would reply to them in quiet, sarcastic tones, \"Why,  I think you are quite as well-dressed as the best-dressed monkey to  be found in the fair at Saint-Laurent.\" It was just such a compliment  D'Artagnan would choose where he did not feel disposed to pay any other:  and, whether agreeable or not, the inquirer was obliged to be satisfied  with it. Whenever any one asked him, \"How do you intend to dress  yourself this evening?\" he replied, \"I shall undress myself;\" at which  the ladies all laughed, and a few of them blushed. But after a couple  of days passed in this manner, the musketeer, perceiving that nothing  serious was likely to arise which would concern him, and that the king  had completely, or, at least, appeared to have completely forgotten  Paris, Saint-Mande, and Belle-Isle--that M. Colbert's mind was occupied  with illuminations and fireworks--that for the next month, at least,  the ladies had plenty of glances to bestow, and also to receive in  exchange--D'Artagnan asked the king for leave of absence for a matter of  private business. At the moment D'Artagnan made his request, his majesty  was on the point of going to bed, quite exhausted from dancing.    \"You wish to leave me, Monsieur d'Artagnan?\" inquired the king, with an  air of astonishment; for Louis XIV. could never understand why any one  who had the distinguished honor of being near him could wish to leave  him.    \"Sire,\" said D'Artagnan, \"I leave you simply because I am not of the  slightest service to you in anything. Ah! if I could only hold the  balancing-pole while you were dancing, it would be a very different  affair.\"    \"But, my dear Monsieur d'Artagnan,\" said the king, gravely, \"people  dance without balancing-poles.\"    \"Ah! indeed,\" said the musketeer, continuing his imperceptible tone of  irony, \"I had no idea such a thing was possible.\"    \"You have not seen me dance, then?\" inquired the king.    \"Yes; but I always thought dancers went from easy to difficult acrobatic  feats. I was mistaken; all the more greater reason, therefore, that I  should leave for a time. Sire, I repeat, you have no present occasion  for my services; besides, if your majesty should have any need of me,  you would know where to find me.\"    \"Very well,\" said the king, and he granted him leave of absence.    We shall not look for D'Artagnan, therefore, at Fontainebleau, for to do  so would be useless; but, with the permission of our readers, follow him  to the Rue des Lombards, where he was located at the sign of the Pilon  d'Or, in the house of our old friend Planchet. It was about eight  o'clock in the evening, and the weather was exceedingly warm; there  was only one window open, and that one belonging to a room on the  _entresol_. A perfume of spices, mingled with another perfume less  exotic, but more penetrating, namely, that which arose from the street,  ascended to salute the nostrils of the musketeer. D'Artagnan, reclining  in an immense straight-backed chair, with his legs not stretched out,  but simply placed upon a stool, formed an angle of the most obtuse form  that could possibly be seen. Both his arms were crossed over his head,  his head reclining upon his left shoulder, like Alexander the Great.  His eyes, usually so quick and intelligent in their expression, were  now half-closed, and seemed fastened, as it were, upon a small corner of  blue sky that was visible behind the opening of the chimneys; there was  just enough blue, and no more, to fill one of the sacks of lentils, or  haricots, which formed the principal furniture of the shop on the  ground floor. Thus extended at his ease, and sheltered in his place of  observation behind the window, D'Artagnan seemed as if he had ceased  to be a soldier, as if he were no longer an officer belonging to the  palace, but was, on the contrary, a quiet, easy-going citizen in a state  of stagnation between his dinner and supper, or between his supper and  his bed; one of those strong, ossified brains, which have no more room  for a single idea, so fiercely does animal matter keep watch at the  doors of intelligence, narrowly inspecting the contraband trade which  might result from the introduction into the brain of a symptom of  thought. We have already said night was closing in, the shops were being  lighted, while the windows of the upper apartments were being closed,  and the rhythmic steps of a patrol of soldiers forming the night watch  could be heard retreating. D'Artagnan continued, however, to think  of nothing, except the blue corner of the sky. A few paces from him,  completely in the shade, lying on his stomach, upon a sack of Indian  corn, was Planchet, with both his arms under his chin, and his eyes  fixed on D'Artagnan, who was either thinking, dreaming, or sleeping,  with his eyes open. Planchet had been watching him for a tolerably long  time, and, by way of interruption, he"]]]
