It is reason for [20]  rejoicing that the _vox populi_ is inclined to grant us peace,  together with pardon for the preliminary battles that  purchased it.    With tender tread, thought sometimes walks in memory,  through the dim corridors of years, on to old battle- [25]  grounds, there sadly to survey the fields of the slain and  the enemy's losses. In compiling this work, I have tried    [Page xii.]    to remove the pioneer signs and ensigns of war, and to [1]  retain at this date the privileged armaments of peace.    With armor on, I continue the march, command and  countermand; meantime interluding with loving thought  this afterpiece of battle. Supported, cheered, I take my [5]  pen and pruning-hook, to \"learn war no more,\" and with  strong wing to lift my readers above the smoke of conflict  into light and liberty.    Mary Baker Eddy    CONCORD, N.H.  January, 1897            CHAPTER I. INTRODUCTORY.          Prospectus.      [Page 1.]    The ancient Greek looked longingly for the Olym- [1]  piad. The Chaldee watched the appearing of a  star; to him, no higher destiny dawned on the dome  of being than that foreshadowed by signs in the heav- [5]  ens. The meek Nazarene, the scoffed of all scoffers,  said, \"Ye can discern the face of the sky; but can ye  not discern the signs of the times?\"--for he forefelt  and foresaw the ordeal of a perfect Christianity, hated  by sinners. [10]    To kindle all minds with a gleam of gratitude, the  new idea that comes welling up from infinite Truth needs  to be understood. The seer of this age should be a  sage.    Humility is the stepping-stone to a higher recognition [15]  of Deity. The mounting sense gathers fresh forms and  strange fire from the ashes of dissolving self, and drops  the world. Meekness heightens immortal attributes  only by removing the dust that dims them. Goodness  reveals another scene and another self seemingly rolled [20]  up in shades, but brought to light by the evolutions of    [Page 2.]    advancing thought, whereby we discern the power of [1]  Truth and Love to heal the sick.    Pride is ignorance; those assume most who have the  least wisdom or experience; and they steal from their  neighbor, because they have so little of their own. [5]    The signs of these times portend a long and strong  determination of mankind to cleave to the world, the  flesh, and evil, causing great obscuration of Spirit.  When we remember that God is just, and admit the  total depravity of mortals, _alias_ mortal mind,--and that [10]  this Adam legacy must first be seen, and then must be  subdued and recompensed by justice, the eternal attri-  bute of Truth,--the outlook demands labor, and the  laborers seem few. To-day we behold but the first  faint view of a more spiritual Christianity, that embraces [15]  a deeper and broader philosophy and a more rational and  divine healing. The time approaches when divine Life,  Truth, and Love will be found alone the remedy for sin,  sickness, and death; when God, man's saving Principle,  and Christ, the spiritual idea of God, will be revealed. [20]    Man's probation after death is the necessity of his  immortality; for good dies not and evil is self-destruc-  tive, therefore evil must be mortal and self-destroyed.  If man should not progress after death, but should re-  main in error, he would be inevitably self-annihilated. [25]  Those upon whom \"the second death hath no power\"  are those who progress here and hereafter out of evil,  their mortal element, and into good that is immortal;  thus laying off the material beliefs that war against  Spirit, and putting on the spiritual elements in divine [30]  Science.    While we entertain decided views as to the best method    [Page 3.]    for elevating the race physically, morally, and spiritually, [1]  and shall express these views as duty demands, we  shall claim no especial gift from our divine origin, no  supernatural power. If we regard good as more natural  than evil, and spiritual understanding--the true knowl- [5]  edge of God--as imparting the only power to heal the  sick and the sinner, we shall demonstrate in our lives the  power of Truth and Love.    The lessons we learn in divine Science are applica-  ble to all the needs of man. Jesus taught them for this [10]  very purpose; and his demonstration hath taught us  that \"through his stripes\"--his life-experience--and  divine Science, brought to the understanding through  Christ, the Spirit-revelator, is man healed and saved.  No opinions of mortals nor human hypotheses enter this [15]  line of thought or action. Drugs, inert matter, never are  needed to aid spiritual power. Hygiene, manipulation,  and mesmerism are not Mind's medicine. The Principle  of all cure is God, unerring and immortal Mind.  We have learned that the erring or mortal thought holds [20]  in itself all sin, sickness, and death, and imparts these  states to the body; while the supreme and perfect Mind,  as seen in the truth of being, antidotes and destroys these  material elements of sin and death.    Because God is supreme and omnipotent, _materia_ [25]  _medica_, hygiene, and animal magnetism are impotent;  and their only supposed efficacy is in apparently delud-  ing reason, denying revelation, and dethroning Deity.  The tendency of mental healing is to uplift mankind; but  this method perverted, is \"Satan let loose.\" Hence the [30]  deep demand for the Science of psychology to meet sin,  and uncover it; thus to annihilate hallucination.    [Page 4.]    Thought imbued with purity, Truth, and Love, in- [1]  structed in the Science of metaphysical healing, is the  most potent and desirable remedial agent on the earth.  At this period there is a marked tendency of mortal  mind to plant mental healing on the basis of hypnotism, [5]  calling this method \"mental science.\" All _Science_ is  _Christian_ Science; the Science of the Mind that is God,  and of the universe as His idea, and their relation to each  other. Its only power to heal is its power to do good,  not evil.          A Timely Issue.      At this date, 1883, a newspaper edited and published  by the Christian Scientists has become a necessity. Many  questions important to be disposed of come to the Col-  lege and to the practising students, yet but little time [15]  has been devoted to their answer. Further enlight-  enment is necessary for the age, and a periodical de-  voted to this work seems alone adequate to meet the  requirement. Much interest is awakened and expressed  on the subject of metaphysical healing, but in many [20]  minds it is confounded with isms, and even infidelity, so  that its religious specialty and the vastness of its worth  are not understood.    It is often said, \"You must have a very strong will-  power to heal,\" or, \"It must require a great deal of faith [25]  to make your demonstrations.\" When it is answered  that there is no will-power required, and that something  more than faith is necessary, we meet with an expression  of incredulity. It is not alone the mission of Christian  Science to heal the sick, but to destroy sin in mortal [30]    [Page 5.]    thought. This work well done will elevate and purify [1]  the race. It cannot fail to do this if we devote our best  energies to the work.    Science reveals man as spiritual, harmonious, and eter-  nal. This should be understood. Our College should [5]  be crowded with students who are willing to consecrate  themselves to this Christian work. Mothers should be  able to produce perfect health and perfect morals in their  children--and ministers, to heal the sick--by study-  ing this scientific method of practising Christianity. [10]  Many say, \"I should like to study, but have not suffi-  cient faith that I have the power to heal.\" The healing  power is Truth and Love, and these do not fail in the  greatest emergencies.    _Materia medica_ says, \"I can do no more. I have [15]  done all that can be done. There is nothing to build  upon. There is no longer any reason for hope.\" Then  metaphysics comes in, armed with the power of Spirit,  not matter, takes up the case hopefully and builds on  the stone that the builders have rejected, and is suc- [20]  cessful.    Metaphysical therapeutics can seem a miracle and a  mystery to those only who do not understand the grand  reality that Mind controls the body. They acknowledge  an erring or mortal mind, but believe it to be brain mat- [25]  ter. That man is the idea of infinite Mind, always perfect  in God, in Truth, Life, and Love, is something not easily  accepted, weighed down as is mortal thought with mate-  rial beliefs. That which never existed, can seem solid  substance to this thought. It is much easier for people [30]  to believe that the body affects the mind, than that the  mind affects the body.    [Page 6.]    We hear from the pulpits that sickness is sent as a [1]  discipline to bring man nearer to God,--even though  sickness often leaves mortals but little time free from  complaints and fretfulness, and Jesus cast out disease as  evil. [5]    The most of our Christian Science practitioners have  plenty to do, and many more are needed for the ad-  vancement of the age. At present the majority of the  acute cases are given to the M. D.'s, and only those  cases that are pronounced incurable are passed over to [10]  the Scientist. The healing of such cases should cer-  tainly prove to all minds the power of metaphysics over  physics; and it surely does, to many thinkers, as the  rapid growth of the work shows. At no distant day,  Christian healing will rank far in advance of allopathy [15]  and homoeopathy; for Truth must ultimately succeed  where error fails.    Mind governs all. That we exist in God, perfect,  there is no doubt, for the conceptions of Life, Truth, and  Love must be perfect; and with that basic truth we con- [20]  quer sickness, sin, and death. Frequently it requires  time to overcome the "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/31458"],[0,"Additional Records and Extensions of Known Ranges of Mammals from Utah (#2)"],[1,":572) and by Durrant  (1952:142). The grayish color of these specimens and the reduction of  ochraceous pigments constitute basis for referring the specimens to _E.  u. umbrinus_, and not to _E. u. adsitus_ or _E. u. montanus_. _E. u.  umbrinus_ on the West Tavaputs Plateau is separated from _E. u.  montanus_ on the East Tavaputs Plateau by the Green River and its deep  chasm.    _=Perognathus formosus incolatus=_ Hall. Long-tailed Pocket  Mouse.--Prior to the description of this subspecies by Hall (1941:56),  animals of this species had not been reported from within the basin of  the Pleistocene Lake Bonneville. When Durrant (1952) prepared his  manuscript he had but a single specimen from western Millard County and  one nearby record (Fautin, 1946:280). Additional specimens are known  from the following localities: junction of Trout Creek and Birch Creek,  Deep Creek Mountains, Tooele County; six miles north of Ibapah, Tooele  County; five miles south of Timpie, Tooele County; north end of  Newfoundland Mountains, Boxelder County; and Groome, Boxelder County.  These occurrences show that the species is not restricted to the  extreme western part of the state, but occurs in suitable habitats  throughout the basin of Pleistocene Lake Bonneville. The known range is  extended approximately 150 miles north and 40 miles east.    _=Perognathus parvus trumbullensis=_ Benson. Great Basin Pocket  Mouse.--Durrant (1952:477), suspecting that this mouse occurred in  Utah, included the subspecies _P. p. trumbullensis_ in his hypothetical  list. Numerous specimens are now available from the following  localities: Pine Valley Mountains, Enterprise Reservoir, and 19 miles  west of Enterprise, Washington County; Bown's Reservoir, Snow Ranch,  Hall Ranch, Steep Creek, Garfield County; Aquarius Guard Station,  Aquarius Plateau, Wayne County. Insofar as we are aware, these  occurrences are the first to be recorded from Utah, and extend the  known range of this subspecies 150 miles northward.    The specimens from Washington County are paler than those from Garfield  County, and this pallor indicates intergradation with the subspecies  _P. p. olivaceus_. Of animals from the Aquarius Plateau, those from the  eastern and southern localities are pale and have a marked suffusion of  ochraceous in the upper parts, whereas those from the western and  northern localities are extremely dark owing to a heavy suffusion of  black in the upper parts. The skulls of animals from the Aquarius  Plateau resemble those of _P. p. trumbullensis_ in the majority of  diagnostic characters. In some few characters, nevertheless, the skulls  resemble those of _P. p. olivaceus_, and in other characters are  intermediate between these two named subspecies. In shape and size of  the interparietal, in slightly longer nasals, and in slightly greater  alveolar length of upper molariform teeth, animals from the Aquarius  Plateau differ from either of the aforementioned subspecies. All  characters considered, we deem it best to refer these specimens to the  subspecies _P. p. trumbullensis_.    _=Thomomys talpoides bridgeri=_ Merriam. Northern Pocket Gopher.--An  adult female, Catalogue No. 25667 of the Museum of Natural History of  the University of Kansas, skin with skull, was trapped, on 30 June  1948, 14 miles south and 2 miles east of Robertson, 9,300 feet, in  Summit County, Utah, by James O. Lonnquist (original number 146). This  is the first record of this subspecies from Utah, and raises to 37 the  named kinds of pocket gophers known from Utah.    _=Reithrodontomys megalotis megalotis=_ (Baird). Western Harvest  Mouse.--Durrant (1952:295) reported no harvest mice from the Uinta  Basin in northeastern Utah. One specimen, No. 10,239, was obtained from  two miles east of Duchesne, Duchesne County. This specimen extends the  known range in Utah 50 miles northward, and indicates that the harvest  mouse of the subspecies _R. m. megalotis_ occurs throughout the Uinta  Basin.    _=Onychomys leucogaster pallescens=_ Merriam. Northern Grasshopper  Mouse.--Hansen obtained specimens (in alcohol) from Kennedys Hole,  junction of the White and Green rivers, Uintah County. The northernmost  specimens available to Durrant (1952:328) were from one mile east of  Greenriver, Grand County. These specimens from Uintah County extend the  known range 80 miles to the north, and substantiate Durrant's  conclusion that this subspecies occurs east of the Green and Colorado  rivers.    _=Clethrionomys gapperi uintaensis=_ Doutt. Red-backed  Mouse.--Previously, the red-backed mouse in Utah was known only from  the Uinta and Wasatch mountains. The southernmost localities from which  specimens were available were in northern Wasatch County and southern  Salt Lake County. Durrant (1952:355) supposed that the species ranged  southward to Mount Timpanogos in Utah County. One specimen, No. 10,075,  from the summit, 18 miles east of Mayfield, Sanpete County, and 4 from  Ephraim Canyon, 15 miles east of Ephraim, Sanpete County, show that  this subspecies occurs also on the Wasatch Plateau of central Utah.  These latter specimens extend the known range of the red-backed mouse  in Utah approximately 100 miles southward. Owing to the practically  continuous nature of the central mountain ranges of Utah, students of  mammals of Utah usually suspect that most montane mammals occur  throughout these mountain ranges. The red-backed mouse has been sought  for in vain in the mountains south of the Wasatch Plateau. Suitable  habitats for this mouse occur throughout the Fishlake Mountains,  Thousand Lake Mountains and the Aquarius Plateau, but despite intensive  collecting, none has been obtained from these areas.    _=Phenacomys intermedius intermedius=_ Merriam. Heather Vole.--The  heather vole, while not rare, is uncommon in Utah. Durrant (1952:360)  had but eight specimens from various localities in Summit, Wasatch,  Salt Lake and Utah counties and supposed that the species was  restricted to the western Uinta Mountains and southern Wasatch  Mountains. In the summers of 1952 and 1953, intensive collecting of  mammals was carried out on Boulder Mountain and the Aquarius Plateau,  in Wayne and Garfield counties. Two specimens, nos. 8956 and 9074, were  obtained from Spectacle Lake, Boulder Mountain, Garfield County. These  specimens extend the known area of occurrence 175 miles southward in  Utah. No specimens are known from the areas between Mount Timpanogos in  Utah County, and Boulder Mountain in Garfield County. We suspect,  however, that when this intervening area has been thoroughly studied,  the heather vole, like many other montane mammals, will be found  throughout the entire length of the central mountain ranges.    _=Microtus pennsylvanicus modestus=_ (Baird). Pennsylvanian Meadow  Mouse.--In Utah this mouse was known only from wet meadows in valleys  immediately west of the Wasatch Mountains, as far south as a place 2  miles south of Provo (Hall and Cockrum, 1953:410). Norman V.  Chamberlain collected several specimens \"near\" Koosharem Reservoir,  Sevier County. These extend the known range of this subspecies 110  miles southward, and suggest that Pennsylvanian meadow mice occur, in  suitable habitat, all along the eastern margin of the Great Basin in  Utah, at least as far south as Sevier County. All northern specimens  are from the drainages of Utah Lake and Great Salt Lake, but these  specimens from Sevier County are from the Sevier River Drainage. This  species requires a fairly moist environment, and such habitat exists  between the aforementioned drainages which are practically  interconnected by Mona Reservoir and its adjacent areas of springs.    _=Zapus princeps utahensis=_ Hall. Big Jumping Mouse.--Durrant  (1952:388) reported a specimen from Puffer Lake, Beaver Mountains,  Beaver County. He supposed that this mouse occurred also at high  elevations still farther south in Utah. Subsequently, two specimens  were obtained from Garfield County; No. 9006 from Steep Creek, 12 miles  north of Boulder and No. 9071 from East Fork of Boulder Creek, 10 miles  north of Boulder. These two specimens extend the known range of jumping  mice in Utah 75 miles southeastward. Several specimens have been  obtained also from the Fishlake Plateau, and further bear out Durrant's  supposition that these mammals occur on all of the high mountains of  central Utah, at least as far south as the Aquarius Plateau.    _=Urocyon cinereoargenteus scottii=_ Mearns. Gray Fox.--One skull, No.  10,240, from mouth of Birch Creek, Deep Creek Mountains, Juab County,  extends the known geographic range 50 miles east from Cherry Creek  Canyon, Nevada (see Hall, 1946:241). This record indicates that the  species occurs in the mountainous areas on the western margins of  Pleistocene Lake Bonneville, and extends the known range in Utah  approximately 150 miles northward. Furthermore, this record proves that  the gray fox occurs as far north in western Utah as it does in eastern  Nevada, but to date none has been obtained from the mountains within  the basin of the ancient lake, even though some of them are not far  removed from the Deep Creek Mountains.    _=Lutra canadensis nexa=_ Goldman. River Otter.--River otters are rare  in a semi-arid state like Utah, and few have been preserved as  scientific specimens. Durrant (1952:436) had access to but one skull  from an immature animal from the Raft River Mountain area in  northwestern Boxelder County. At present there are two complete  specimens (skins, skulls and skeletons) in the collection of the  University of Utah. They were trapped by an employee of the Utah State  Fish and Game Department, and were donated to the University of Utah by  J. Perry Egan, Director of the above mentioned department. They are  nos. 8854 and 8855, and are from the Raft River, 2 miles south of the  Utah-Idaho border, Boxelder County.    _=Alces americanus shirasi=_ Nelson. Moose.--The moose "]]]
