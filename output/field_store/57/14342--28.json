Astronomy, indeed, owes much more to  the notions of believers in astrology than is commonly supposed.  Astrology bears the same relation to modern astronomy that alchemy bears  to modern chemistry. As it is probable that nothing but the hope of  gain, literally in this case _auri sacra fames_, would have led to those  laborious researches of the alchemists which first taught men how to  analyse matter into its elementary constituents, and afterwards to  combine these constituents afresh into new forms, so the belief that, by  carefully studying the stars, men might acquire the power of predicting  future events, first directed attention to the movements of the  celestial bodies. Kepler's saying, that astrology, though a fool, was  the daughter of a wise mother,[3] does not by any means present truly  the relationship between astrology and astronomy. Rather we may say that  astrology and alchemy, though foolish mothers, gave birth to those wise  daughters, astronomy and chemistry. Even this way of speaking scarcely  does justice to the astrologers and alchemists of old times. Their views  appear foolish in the light of modern scientific knowledge, but they  were not foolish in relation to what was known when they were  entertained. Modern analysis goes far to demonstrate the immutability,  and, consequently, the non-transmutability of the metals, though it is  by no means so certain as many suppose that the present position of the  metals in the list of _elements_ is really correct. Certainly a chemist  of our day would be thought very unwise who should undertake a series of  researches with the object of discovering a mineral having such  qualities as the alchemists attributed to the philosopher's stone. But  when as yet the facts on which the science of chemistry is based were  unknown, there was nothing unreasonable in supposing that such a mineral  might exist, or the means of compounding it be discovered. Nay, many  arguments from analogy might be urged to show that the supposition was  altogether probable. In like manner, though the known facts of astronomy  oppose themselves irresistibly to any belief in planetary influences  upon the fates of men and nations, yet before those facts were  discovered it was not only not unreasonable, but was in fact, highly  reasonable to believe in such influences, or at least that the sun, and  moon, and stars moved in the heavens in such sort as to indicate what  would happen. If the wise men of old times rejected the belief that 'the  stars in their courses fought' for or against men, they yet could not  very readily abandon the belief that the stars were for signs in the  heavens of what was to befall mankind.    If we consider the reasoning now commonly thought valid in favour of the  doctrine that other orbs besides our earth are inhabited, and compare it  with the reasoning on which judicial astrology was based, we shall not  find much to choose between the two, so far as logical weight is  concerned. Because the only member of the solar system which we can  examine closely is inhabited, astronomers infer a certain degree of  probability for the belief that the other planets of the system are also  inhabited. And because the only sun we know much about is the centre of  a system of planets, astronomers infer that probably the stars, those  other suns which people space, are also the centres of systems; although  no telescope which man can make would show the members of a system like  ours, attending on even the nearest of all the stars. The astrologer had  a similar argument for his belief. The moon, as she circles around the  earth, exerts a manifest influence upon terrestrial matter--the tidal  wave rising and sinking synchronously with the movements of the moon,  and other consequences depending directly or indirectly upon her  revolution around the earth. The sun's influence is still more manifest;  and, though it may have required the genius of a Herschel or of a  Stephenson to perceive that almost every form of terrestrial energy is  derived from the sun, yet it must have been manifest from the very  earliest times that the greater light which rules the day rules the  seasons also, and, in ruling them, provides the annual supplies of  vegetable food, on which the very existence of men and animals depends.  If these two bodies, the sun and moon, are thus potent, must it not be  supposed, reasoned the astronomers of old, that the other celestial  bodies exert corresponding influences? _We_ know, but they did not know,  that the moon rules the tides effectually because she is near to us, and  that the sun is second only to the moon in tidal influence because of  his enormous mass and attractive energy. We know also that his position  as fire, light, and life of the earth and its inhabitants, is due  directly to the tremendous heat with which the whole of his mighty  frame is instinct. Not knowing this, the astronomers of old times had no  sufficient reason for distinguishing the sun and moon from the other  celestial bodies, so far at least as the general question of celestial  influences was concerned.    So far as particulars were concerned, it was not altogether so clear to  them as it is to us, that the influence of the sun must be paramount in  all respects save tidal action, and that of the moon second only to the  sun's in other respects, and superior to his in tidal sway alone. Many  writers on the subject of life in other worlds are prepared to show (as  Brewster attempts to do, for example) that Jupiter and Saturn are far  nobler worlds than the earth, because superior in this or that  circumstance. So the ancient astronomers, in their ignorance of the  actual conditions on which celestial influences depend, found abundant  reasons for regarding the feeble influences exerted by Saturn, Jupiter,  and Mars, as really more potent than those exerted by the sun himself  upon the earth. They reasoned, as Milton afterwards made Raphael reason,  that 'great or bright infers not excellence,' that Saturn or Jupiter,  though 'in comparison so small, nor glist'ring' to like degree, may yet  'of solid good contain more plenty than the sun.' Supposing the  influence of a celestial body to depend on the magnitude of its sphere,  in the sense of the old astronomy (according to which each planet had  its proper sphere, around the earth as centre), then the influence of  the sun would be judged to be inferior to that of either Saturn,  Jupiter, or Mars; while the influences of Venus and Mercury, though  inferior to the influence of the sun, would still be held superior to  that of the moon. For the ancients measured the spheres of the seven  planets of their system by the periods of the apparent revolution of  those bodies around the celestial dome, and so set the sphere of the  moon innermost, enclosed by the sphere of Mercury, around which in turn  was the sphere of Venus, next the sun's, then, in order, those of Mars,  Jupiter, and Saturn. We can readily understand how they might come to  regard the slow motions of the sphere of Saturn and Jupiter, taking  respectively some thirty and twelve years to complete a revolution, as  indicating power superior to the sun's, whose sphere seemed to revolve  once in a single year. Many other considerations might have been urged,  before the Copernican theory was established, to show that, possibly,  some of the planets exert influences more effective than those of the  sun and moon.    It is, indeed, clear that the first real shock sustained by astrology  came from the arguments of Copernicus. So long as the earth was regarded  as the centre round which all the celestial bodies move, it was hopeless  to attempt to shake men's faith in the influences of the stars. So far  as I know, there is not a single instance of a believer in the old  Ptolemaic system who rejected astrology absolutely. The views of  Bacon--the last of any note who opposed the system of  Copernicus[4]--indicate the extreme limits to which a Ptolemaist could  go in opposition to astrology. It may be worth while to quote Bacon's  opinion in this place, because it indicates at once very accurately the  position held by believers in astrology in his day, and the influence  which the belief in a central fixed earth could not fail to exert on the  minds of even the most philosophical reasoners.    'Astrology,' he begins, 'is so full of superstition that scarce anything  sound can be discovered in it; though we judge it should rather be  purged than absolutely rejected. Yet if any one shall pretend that this  science is founded not in reason and physical contemplations, but in the  direct experience and observation of past ages, and therefore not to be  examined by physical reasons, as the Chaldaeans boasted, he may at the  same time bring back divination, auguries, soothsaying, and give in to  all kinds of fables; for these also were said to descend from long  experience. But we receive astrology as a part of physics, without  attributing more to it than reason and the evidence of things allow, and  strip it of its superstition and conceits. Thus we banish that empty  notion about the horary reign of the planets, as if each resumed the  throne thrice in twenty-four hours, so as to leave three hours  supernumerary; and yet this fiction produced the division of the  week,[5] a thing so ancient and so universally received. Thus likewise  we reject as an idle figment the doctrine of horoscopes, and the  distribution of the houses, though these are the darling inventions of  astrology, which have kept revel, as it were, in the heavens. And  lastly, for the calculation of nativities, fortunes, good or bad hours  of business, and the like fatalities, they are mere levities, that have  little in them of certainty and solidity, and may be plainly confuted by  physical reasons. But here we judge it proper to lay down some rules for  the examination of astrological"]]]
