The moment of separation is a temporary period,  a brief journey of the soul. It begins, it ends. The wanderer returns to  land and race....\"    The door opened. The wub stopped, turning its great head.    Captain Franco came into the room, the men behind him. They hesitated at  the door.    \"Are you all right?\" French said.    \"Do you mean me?\" Peterson said, surprised. \"Why me?\"    Franco lowered his gun. \"Come over here,\" he said to Peterson. \"Get up  and come here.\"    There was silence.    \"Go ahead,\" the wub said. \"It doesn't matter.\"    Peterson stood up. \"What for?\"    \"It's an order.\"    Peterson walked to the door. French caught his arm.    \"What's going on?\" Peterson wrenched loose. \"What's the matter with  you?\"    Captain Franco moved toward the wub. The wub looked up from where it lay  in the corner, pressed against the wall.    \"It is interesting,\" the wub said, \"that you are obsessed with the idea  of eating me. I wonder why.\"    \"Get up,\" Franco said.    \"If you wish.\" The wub rose, grunting. \"Be patient. It is difficult for  me.\" It stood, gasping, its tongue lolling foolishly.    \"Shoot it now,\" French said.    \"For God's sake!\" Peterson exclaimed. Jones turned to him quickly, his  eyes gray with fear.    \"You didn't see him--like a statue, standing there, his mouth open. If  we hadn't come down, he'd still be there.\"    \"Who? The Captain?\" Peterson stared around. \"But he's all right now.\"    They looked at the wub, standing in the middle of the room, its great  chest rising and falling.    \"Come on,\" Franco said. \"Out of the way.\"    The men pulled aside toward the door.    \"You are quite afraid, aren't you?\" the wub said. \"Have I done anything  to you? I am against the idea of hurting. All I have done is try to  protect myself. Can you expect me to rush eagerly to my death? I am a  sensible being like yourselves. I was curious to see your ship, learn  about you. I suggested to the native--\"    The gun jerked.    \"See,\" Franco said. \"I thought so.\"    The wub settled down, panting. It put its paw out, pulling its tail  around it.    \"It is very warm,\" the wub said. \"I understand that we are close to the  jets. Atomic power. You have done many wonderful things with  it--technically. Apparently, your scientific hierarchy is not equipped  to solve moral, ethical--\"    Franco turned to the men, crowding behind him, wide-eyed, silent.    \"I'll do it. You can watch.\"    French nodded. \"Try to hit the brain. It's no good for eating. Don't hit  the chest. If the rib cage shatters, we'll have to pick bones out.\"    \"Listen,\" Peterson said, licking his lips. \"Has it done anything? What  harm has it done? I'm asking you. And anyhow, it's still mine. You have  no right to shoot it. It doesn't belong to you.\"    Franco raised his gun.    \"I'm going out,\" Jones said, his face white and sick. \"I don't want to  see it.\"    \"Me, too,\" French said. The men straggled out, murmuring. Peterson  lingered at the door.    \"It was talking to me about myths,\" he said. \"It wouldn't hurt anyone.\"    He went outside.    Franco walked toward the wub. The wub looked up slowly. It swallowed.    \"A very foolish thing,\" it said. \"I am sorry that you want to do it.  There was a parable that your Saviour related--\"    It stopped, staring at the gun.    \"Can you look me in the eye and do it?\" the wub said. \"Can you do that?\"    The Captain gazed down. \"I can look you in the eye,\" he said. \"Back on  the farm we had hogs, dirty razor-back hogs. I can do it.\"    Staring down at the wub, into the gleaming, moist eyes, he pressed the  trigger.           *       *       *       *       *    The taste was excellent.    They sat glumly around the table, some of them hardly eating at all. The  only one who seemed to be enjoying himself was Captain Franco.    \"More?\" he said, looking around. \"More? And some wine, perhaps.\"    \"Not me,\" French said. \"I think I'll go back to the chart room.\"    \"Me, too.\" Jones stood up, pushing his chair back. \"I'll see you later.\"    The Captain watched them go. Some of the others excused themselves.    \"What do you suppose the matter is?\" the Captain said. He turned to  Peterson. Peterson sat staring down at his plate, at the potatoes, the  green peas, and at the thick slab of tender, warm meat.    He opened his mouth. No sound came.    The Captain put his hand on Peterson's shoulder.    \"It is only organic matter, now,\" he said. \"The life essence is gone.\"  He ate, spooning up the gravy with some bread. \"I, myself, love to eat.  It is one of the greatest things that a living creature can enjoy.  Eating, resting, meditation, discussing things.\"    Peterson nodded. Two more men got up and went out. The Captain drank  some water and sighed.    \"Well,\" he said. \"I must say that this was a very enjoyable meal. All  the reports I had heard were quite true--the taste of wub. Very fine.  But I was prevented from enjoying this pleasure in times past.\"    He dabbed at his lips with his napkin and leaned back in his chair.  Peterson stared dejectedly at the table.    The Captain watched him intently. He leaned over.    \"Come, come,\" he said. \"Cheer up! Let's discuss things.\"    He smiled.    \"As I was saying before I was interrupted, the role of Odysseus in the  myths--\"    Peterson jerked up, staring.    \"To go on,\" the Captain said. \"Odysseus, as I understand him--\"          Transcriber's Note:        This etext was produced from _Planet Stories_ July 1952.

They make little cuts in the bark  of the tree, stick on with a bit of clay a tiny cup underneath each  cut, and move on through the forest to the next tree. Sometimes they  make narrow V-shaped cuts in the bark, one above another, but all  coming into a perpendicular channel leading to the foot of the tree.  Later in the day the collectors empty the cups into great jugs and  carry them to the camp.    When the rubber juice reaches the camp, it is poured into a great  bowl. The men build a fire of sticks, and always add a great many palm  nuts, which are oily and make a good deal of smoke. Over the fire they  place an earthen jar shaped like a cone, but without top or bottom.  Now work begins. It is fortunate that it can be done in the open air,  and that the man can sit on the windward side, for the smoke rises  through the smaller hole thick and black and suffocating. The man  takes a stick shaped like a paddle, dips it into the bowl, and holds  it in the smoke and heat, turning it rapidly over and over till the  water is nearly dried out of the rubber and it is no longer milky, but  dark-colored. Then he dips this paddle in again and again. It grows  heavier at each dipping, but he keeps on till he has five or six  pounds of rubber. With a wet knife he cuts this off, making what are  called \"biscuits.\" After many years of this sort of work, some one  found that by resting one end of a pole in a crotched stick and  holding the other in his hand, a man could make a much larger biscuit.    For a long time people thought that rubber trees could not be  cultivated. One difficulty in taking them away from their original  home to plant is that the seeds are so rich in oil as to become rancid  unusually soon. At length, however, a consignment of them was packed  in openwork baskets between layers of dried wild banana leaves and  slung up on deck in openwork crates so as to have plenty of air. By  this means seven thousand healthy little plants were soon growing in  England, and from there were carried to Ceylon and the East.    On the rubber plantations collecting juice from trees standing near  together and in open ground is an altogether different matter from  cutting a narrow path and forcing one's way through a South American  or African jungle. The bark of the trees is cut in herringbone  fashion. The collector simply slices a thin piece off the bark and at  once milk begins to ooze out.    On the great plantations of the East the rubber is collected chiefly  by Chinese and Indians. They are carefully taught just how to tap the  trees. They begin four or five feet from the ground, and work down,  cutting the thinnest possible slice at each visit. When they have  almost reached the ground, they begin on the opposite side of the  trunk; and by the time they have reached the ground on that side the  bark on the first side has renewed itself. The latex is strained and  mixed with some acid, usually acetic, in order to coagulate or thicken  it. It is then run between rollers, hung in a drying house, and  generally in a smokehouse.    The rubber arrives at the factory in bales or cases. First of all  it must be thoroughly washed in order to get rid of sand or bits of  leaves and wood. A machine called a \"washer\" does this work. It forces  the rubber between grooved rolls which break it up; and as this is  done under a spray of water, the rubber is much cleaner when it comes  out. Another machine makes it still cleaner and forms it into long  sheets about two feet wide.    Having thoroughly wet the rubber, the next step is to dry it  thoroughly. The old way was to hang it up for several weeks. The new  way is to cut it into strips, lay it upon steel trays, and place it  in a vacuum dryer. This is kept hot, and whatever moisture is in the  rubber is either evaporated or sucked out by a vacuum pump. It now  passes through another machine much like the washer, and is formed  into sheets. The square threads from which elastic webbing is made may  be cut from these sheets, though sometimes the sheet is wound on an  iron drum, vulcanized by being put into hot water, lightly varnished  with shellac to stiffen it, then wound on a wooden cylinder, and cut  into square threads. Boiling these in caustic soda removes the  shellac. To make round threads, softened rubber is forced through a  die. Rubber bands are made by cementing a sheet of rubber into a tube  and then cutting them off at whatever width may be desired. Toy  balloons are made of such rubber. Two pieces are stamped out and  joined by a particularly noisy machine, and then the balloon is blown  out by compressed air.    Early in the nineteenth century it was known that rubber would keep  out water, but it was sticky and unmanageable. After a while a Scotch  chemist named McIntosh succeeded in dissolving rubber in naphtha and  spreading it between two thicknesses of cloth. That is why his name  is given to raincoats made in this way. Overshoes, too, were made of  pure rubber poured over clay lasts which were broken after the rubber  had dried. These overshoes were waterproof,--there was no denying  that; but they were heavy and clumsy and shapeless. When they were  taken off, they did not stand up, but promptly fell over. In hot  weather they became so sticky that they had to be kept in the cellar;  and in winter they became stiff and inelastic, but they never wore  out. How to get rid of the undesirable qualities and not lose the  desirable ones was the question. It was found out that if sulphur was  mixed with rubber, the disagreeable stickiness would vanish; but the  rubbers continued to melt and to freeze by turns until an American  named Charles Goodyear discovered that if rubber mixed with sulphur  was exposed to about 300 deg. F. of heat for a number of hours, the  rubber would remain elastic, but would not be sticky and would no longer  be affected by heat or cold. This is why you often see the name Goodyear  on the bottom of rubbers.    Rubber overshoes were improved at once. As they now are made, the  rubber is mixed with sulphur, whiting, litharge, and several other  substances. An honest firm will add only those materials that will be  of service in making the rubber more easy to mould or will improve it  in some way. Unfortunately, substances are often added, not for this  purpose, but to increase the weight and apparent value of the  articles. That is why some rubber overshoes, for instance, wear out  so much faster than others.    To make an overshoe, the rubber is run through rollers and formed into  thick sheets for soles and thinner sheets for uppers. Another machine  coats with gum the cloth used for lining and stays. Rubber and  rubber-lined cloth go to the cutting-room, where all the different  parts of the shoes are cut out. They are then put together and  varnished. While still on the last, they are dipped into a tank of  varnish and vulcanized--a very simple matter now that Goodyear has  shown us how, for they are merely left in large, thoroughly heated  ovens for eight or ten hours. The rubber shoe or boot is now elastic,  strong, waterproof, ready for any temperature, and so firmly cemented  together with rubber cement that it is practically all in one piece.    During the last few years there have been frequent calls from various  charities for old rubber overshoes, pieces of rubber hose, etc. These  are of considerable value in rubber manufacturing. They are run  through a machine which tears them to shreds, then through a sort of  fanning-mill which blows away the bits of lining. Tiny pieces of iron  may be present from nails or rivets; but these are easily removed by  magnets. This \"reclaimed\" rubber is powdered and mixed with the new,  and for some purposes the mixture answers very well. Imitation rubber  has been made by heating oil of linseed, hemp, maize, etc., with  sulphur; but no substitute for rubber is a success for all uses.    [Illustration: _Courtesy U. S. Tire Co._    HOW RUBBER GOES THROUGH THE FACTORY    Splitting Para biscuits, mixing the rubber, rolling the rubber fabric  on cylinders, and building tires on the tire machines.]    There are many little conveniences made of rubber which we should  greatly miss, such as the little tips put into pencil ends for erasing  pencil marks. These are made by filling a mould with rubber. Rubber  corks are made in much the same manner. Tips for the legs of chairs  are made in a two-piece mould larger at the bottom than at the top,  and with a plunger that nearly fits the small end. Often on chair tips  and in the cup-shaped eraser that goes over the ends of some pencils  you can see the \"fin,\" as the glassworkers call it, where the two  pieces of the mould did not exactly fit. Rubber cannot be melted and  cast in moulds like iron, but it can be gently heated and softened,  and then pressed into a mould. Rubber stamps are made in this way. The  making of rubber heels and soles is now a large industry; hose for  watering and for vacuum and Westinghouse brakes is made in increasing  quantities. The making of rubber tires for automobiles and carriages  is an important industry. The enormous and increasing use of  electricity requires much use of rubber as an insulator. Rubber gloves  will protect an electrical workman from shock and a surgeon from  infection. Rubber beds and cushions filled with air are a great  comfort in illness. Rubber has great and important uses; but we should  perhaps miss quite as much the little comforts and conveniences which  it has made possible.    Rubber and gutta-percha are not the same substance by any means.  Both of them are made of the milky juice of trees, but of entirely  different trees. The gutta-percha milk is collected in an absurdly  wasteful manner, namely, by cutting down the trees and scraping up  the juice. When this juice reaches the market, it is in large reddish  lumps which"]]]
