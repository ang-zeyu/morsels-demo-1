My soul is racked and shivers with fear.            (Healer of Delos, hear!)  Hast thou some pain unknown before,  Or with the circling years renewest a penance of yore?  Offspring of golden Hope, thou voice immortal, O tell me.    (Ant. 1)  First on Athene I call; O Zeus-born goddess, defend!            Goddess and sister, befriend,  Artemis, Lady of Thebes, high-throned in the midst of our mart!            Lord of the death-winged dart!              Your threefold aid I crave       From death and ruin our city to save.  If in the days of old when we nigh had perished, ye drave  From our land the fiery plague, be near us now and defend us!    (Str. 2)       Ah me, what countless woes are mine!       All our host is in decline;       Weaponless my spirit lies.       Earth her gracious fruits denies;       Women wail in barren throes;       Life on life downstriken goes,       Swifter than the wind bird's flight,       Swifter than the Fire-God's might,       To the westering shores of Night.    (Ant. 2)       Wasted thus by death on death       All our city perisheth.       Corpses spread infection round;       None to tend or mourn is found.       Wailing on the altar stair       Wives and grandams rend the air--       Long-drawn moans and piercing cries       Blent with prayers and litanies.       Golden child of Zeus, O hear       Let thine angel face appear!    (Str. 3)  And grant that Ares whose hot breath I feel,            Though without targe or steel  He stalks, whose voice is as the battle shout,  May turn in sudden rout,  To the unharbored Thracian waters sped,            Or Amphitrite's bed.       For what night leaves undone,       Smit by the morrow's sun  Perisheth.  Father Zeus, whose hand  Doth wield the lightning brand,  Slay him beneath thy levin bold, we pray,            Slay him, O slay!    (Ant. 3)  O that thine arrows too, Lycean King,            From that taut bow's gold string,  Might fly abroad, the champions of our rights;            Yea, and the flashing lights  Of Artemis, wherewith the huntress sweeps            Across the Lycian steeps.  Thee too I call with golden-snooded hair,            Whose name our land doth bear,  Bacchus to whom thy Maenads Evoe shout;            Come with thy bright torch, rout,                 Blithe god whom we adore,                 The god whom gods abhor.    [Enter OEDIPUS.]  OEDIPUS  Ye pray; 'tis well, but would ye hear my words  And heed them and apply the remedy,  Ye might perchance find comfort and relief.  Mind you, I speak as one who comes a stranger  To this report, no less than to the crime;  For how unaided could I track it far  Without a clue?  Which lacking (for too late  Was I enrolled a citizen of Thebes)  This proclamation I address to all:--  Thebans, if any knows the man by whom  Laius, son of Labdacus, was slain,  I summon him to make clean shrift to me.  And if he shrinks, let him reflect that thus  Confessing he shall 'scape the capital charge;  For the worst penalty that shall befall him  Is banishment--unscathed he shall depart.  But if an alien from a foreign land  Be known to any as the murderer,  Let him who knows speak out, and he shall have  Due recompense from me and thanks to boot.  But if ye still keep silence, if through fear  For self or friends ye disregard my hest,  Hear what I then resolve; I lay my ban  On the assassin whosoe'er he be.  Let no man in this land, whereof I hold  The sovereign rule, harbor or speak to him;  Give him no part in prayer or sacrifice  Or lustral rites, but hound him from your homes.  For this is our defilement, so the god  Hath lately shown to me by oracles.  Thus as their champion I maintain the cause  Both of the god and of the murdered King.  And on the murderer this curse I lay  (On him and all the partners in his guilt):--  Wretch, may he pine in utter wretchedness!  And for myself, if with my privity  He gain admittance to my hearth, I pray  The curse I laid on others fall on me.  See that ye give effect to all my hest,  For my sake and the god's and for our land,  A desert blasted by the wrath of heaven.  For, let alone the god's express command,  It were a scandal ye should leave unpurged  The murder of a great man and your king,  Nor track it home.  And now that I am lord,  Successor to his throne, his bed, his wife,  (And had he not been frustrate in the hope  Of issue, common children of one womb  Had forced a closer bond twixt him and me,  But Fate swooped down upon him), therefore I  His blood-avenger will maintain his cause  As though he were my sire, and leave no stone  Unturned to track the assassin or avenge  The son of Labdacus, of Polydore,  Of Cadmus, and Agenor first of the race.  And for the disobedient thus I pray:  May the gods send them neither timely fruits  Of earth, nor teeming increase of the womb,  But may they waste and pine, as now they waste,  Aye and worse stricken; but to all of you,  My loyal subjects who approve my acts,  May Justice, our ally, and all the gods  Be gracious and attend you evermore.    CHORUS  The oath thou profferest, sire, I take and swear.  I slew him not myself, nor can I name  The slayer.  For the quest, 'twere well, methinks  That Phoebus, who proposed the riddle, himself  Should give the answer--who the murderer was.    OEDIPUS  Well argued; but no living man can hope  To force the gods to speak against their will.    CHORUS  May I then say what seems next best to me?    OEDIPUS  Aye, if there be a third best, tell it too.    CHORUS  My liege, if any man sees eye to eye  With our lord Phoebus, 'tis our prophet, lord  Teiresias; he of all men best might guide  A searcher of this matter to the light.    OEDIPUS  Here too my zeal has nothing lagged, for twice  At Creon's instance have I sent to fetch him,  And long I marvel why he is not here.    CHORUS  I mind me too of rumors long ago--  Mere gossip.    OEDIPUS                 Tell them, I would fain know all.    CHORUS  'Twas said he fell by travelers.    OEDIPUS                                     So I heard,  But none has seen the man who saw him fall.    CHORUS  Well, if he knows what fear is, he will quail  And flee before the terror of thy curse.    OEDIPUS  Words scare not him who blenches not at deeds.    CHORUS  But here is one to arraign him.  Lo, at length  They bring the god-inspired seer in whom  Above all other men is truth inborn.  [Enter TEIRESIAS, led by a boy.]    OEDIPUS  Teiresias, seer who comprehendest all,  Lore of the wise and hidden mysteries,  High things of heaven and low things of the earth,  Thou knowest, though thy blinded eyes see naught,  What plague infects our city; and we turn  To thee, O seer, our one defense and shield.  The purport of the answer that the God  Returned to us who sought his oracle,  The messengers have doubtless told thee--how  One course alone could rid us of the pest,  To find the murderers of Laius,  And slay them or expel them from the land.  Therefore begrudging neither augury  Nor other divination that is thine,  O save thyself, thy country, and thy king,  Save all from this defilement of blood shed.  On thee we rest.  This is man's highest end,  To others' service all his powers to lend.    TEIRESIAS  Alas, alas, what misery to be wise  When wisdom profits nothing!  This old lore  I had forgotten; else I were not here.    OEDIPUS  What ails thee?  Why this melancholy mood?    TEIRESIAS  Let me go home; prevent me not; 'twere best  That thou shouldst bear thy burden and I mine.    OEDIPUS  For shame! no true-born Theban patriot  Would thus withhold the word of prophecy.    TEIRESIAS  _Thy_ words, O king, are wide of the mark, and I  For fear lest I too trip like thee...    OEDIPUS                                          Oh speak,  Withhold not, I adjure thee, if thou know'st,  Thy knowledge.  We are all thy suppliants.    TEIRESIAS  Aye, for ye all are witless, but my voice  Will ne'er reveal my miseries--or thine. [2]    OEDIPUS  What then, thou knowest, and yet willst not speak!  Wouldst thou betray us and destroy the State?    TEIRESIAS  I will not vex myself nor thee.  Why ask  Thus idly what from me thou shalt not learn?    OEDIPUS  Monster! thy silence would incense a flint.  Will nothing loose thy tongue?  Can nothing melt thee,  Or shake thy dogged taciturnity?    TEIRESIAS  Thou blam'st my mood and seest not thine own  Wherewith thou art mated; no, thou taxest me.    OEDIPUS  And who could stay his choler when he heard  How insolently thou dost flout the State?    TEIRESIAS  Well, it will come what will, though I be mute.    OEDIPUS  Since come it must, thy duty is to tell me.    TEIRESIAS  I have no more to say; storm as thou willst,  And give the rein to all thy pent-up rage.    OEDIPUS  Yea, I am wroth, and will not stint my words,  But speak my whole mind.  Thou methinks thou art he,  Who planned the crime, aye, and performed it too,  All save the assassination; and if thou  Hadst not been blind, I had been sworn to boot  That thou alone didst do the bloody deed.    TEIRESIAS  Is it so?  Then I charge thee to abide  By thine own proclamation; from this day  Speak not to these or me.  Thou art the man,  Thou the accursed polluter of this land.    OEDIPUS  Vile slanderer, thou blurtest forth these taunts,  And think'st forsooth as seer to go scot free.    TEIRESIAS  Yea, I am free, strong in the strength of truth.    OEDIPUS  Who was thy teacher? not methinks thy art.    TEIRESIAS  Thou, goading me against my will to speak.    OEDIPUS  What speech? repeat it and resolve my doubt.    TEIRESIAS  Didst miss my sense wouldst thou goad me on?    OEDIPUS  I but half caught thy meaning; say it again.    TEIRESIAS  I say thou art the murderer of the man  Whose murderer thou pursuest.    OEDIPUS                                Thou shalt rue it  Twice to repeat so gross a calumny.    TEIRESIAS  Must I say more to aggravate thy rage?    OEDIPUS  Say all thou wilt; it will be but "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/31035"],[0,"Mammals of Mesa Verde National Park, Colorado (#2)"],[1,"and Oak Tree Ruin; (12) Square Tower House; (13) Balcony House;  (14) Indian Cornfield, \"Cornfield,\" or \"Garden.\"]    The first mammals from the Mesa to be preserved for scientific study  were seven specimens in the United States National Museum (designated  USNM in lists of specimens examined) obtained by Merritt Cary in 1907,  and mentioned in his \"Biological Survey of Colorado\" (Cary, 1911). In  1931 and 1932, R.L. Landberg obtained a few specimens that are in the  Denver Museum of Natural History. In 1935, C.W. Quaintance, Lloyd White,  Harold P. Pratt, and A.E. Borell prepared specimens, some of which  remain in the museum at the Park (all specimens in the museum at the  Park are designated by \"MV\" for Mesa Verde and by their catalogue  numbers), and some are in the Museum of Vertebrate Zoology at the  University of California at Berkeley (designated \"MVZ\" in the following  accounts). Specimens in The University of Kansas Museum of Natural  History are referred to by catalogue numbers only. Specimens prepared by  D. Watson bear dates from 1936 until 1955. In 1938, Raymond F. Harlow  prepared some specimens; his Student Technician's Report of 7 typescript  pages, for July 8 to September 9, 1938, is on file at Mesa Verde  National Park. In 1944 and 1945, Dr. D.A. Sutton, then a student at the  University of Colorado, collected chipmunks for his own study, and also  some other specimens that are in the University of Colorado Museum and  the Park Museum. In 1949, Dr. R.B. Finley, then a student at The  University of Kansas, collected in and near the Park and obtained a few  specimens preserved in The University of Kansas Museum of Natural  History. Rodents preserved by Harold R. Shepherd have been mentioned. I  have examined 244 specimens that were collected by the above persons.  Between August 8 and September 4, 1956, and on July 17, 1960, I  collected 216 mammals from Mesa Verde National Park. Between November 3,  and 12, 1957, J.R. Alcorn collected 275 mammals from the Mesa. The total  of specimens examined is 735.    Written reports by C.W. Quaintance, H.P. Pratt, and R. Harlow have been  of considerable use. A typescript report of 13 pages by Wildlife  Technician H.P. Pratt for the period from September 9 to October 15,  1935, and monthly reports comprising 40 typescript pages and 4 pages  with photographs by C.W. Quaintance for the period from February 18  through July 17, 1935, are on file at offices of Region Four, National  Park Service, 180 New Montgomery Street, San Francisco 5, California.  Chief Ranger Wade has kindly made available the files in his office,  including reports of the Superintendent and reports of the Chief Ranger  in earlier years, and Annual or Biennial Animal Census Reports since  1930. Special reports on prairie dogs, porcupines, and deer are in the  files. These reports, and random reports that were regarded as reliable,  are recorded on card files in both the Chief Ranger's office and Park  Archeologist's office. Most of the information reported here on the  larger mammals was gleaned from the above sources. A study of population  fluctuations in porcupines by Donald A. Spencer and perhaps a study of  movements of porcupines by Spencer, Wade and Fitch are to be published  elsewhere. Other studies still in progress are mentioned in the  following accounts.          ACCOUNTS OF SPECIES      Sorex merriami leucogenys Osgood Merriam's Shrew         _Specimen_: MV 7898/507, head of Navajo Canyon (locality No. 7 in       Fig. 2), October 21, 1954.    This was the third reported specimen of the rare Merriam's shrew from  Colorado (Rodeck and Anderson, 1956:436).      Sorex vagrans obscurus Merriam Wandering Shrew         _Specimens examined._--Total, 8: Morfield Canyon, 7600 ft., 75972,       75973; Upper Well, Prater Canyon, 7575 ft., 69235-69238; 1/4 mi. N       Middle Well, Prater Canyon, 7500 ft., 69239-69240.    The specimens from Prater Canyon were trapped in the grasses and sedges  of the meadow comprising the floor of the canyon. The ground and  vegetation were dry at the time of capture, September 2, 3, and 4, 1956.  _Microtus montanus_ was the only other species taken in the mouse traps  in the sedge and grass. Five of the six specimens from Prater Canyon are  young, having slightly worn teeth; the sixth is an old adult male the  teeth of which are so much worn that only a few traces of the  reddish-brown pigment remain. His testes were 5 mm. long. These  specimens are from an area of intergradation between _S. v. obscurus_  and _S. v. monticola_. The length of the maxillary tooth-row in these  six specimens averaged 6.23 (6.1-6.4) millimeters. Comparison with  average measurements of 6.6 and 6.8 in samples of _S. v. obscurus_, and  of 5.9 in a sample of _S. v. monticola_ (Findley, 1955:64, 65) reveals  the intermediate size of the specimens from the Mesa Verde. The gap  between habitat suitable for _Sorex vagrans_ on the Mesa Verde and the  nearest record-station for _S. v. monticola_ to the south and west in  the Chuska Mountains is wider than the gap between the Mesa Verde and  the nearest record-station for _S. v. obscurus_ to the north and east,  one mile west of Mancos, 75971, 7000 feet, or at Silverton. On  geographic grounds the specimens from the Mesa Verde are referred to _S.  v. obscurus_. The two specimens from Morfield Canyon were trapped on  November 4, 1957, and are grayish above and silvery below. Their pelage  contrasts markedly with the dorsally brownish and ventrally buffy pelage  of the September-taken specimens from Prater Canyon.      Myotis californicus stephensi Dalquest California Myotis         _Specimens examined._---Total, 3: Rock Springs, 7400 ft., 69243,       69246, August 21 and 22, 1956; 4505 Denver Museum, within the Park       (exact locality not recorded), R.L. Landberg, July 27, 1931.    The specimens from Rock Springs were an adult male and a non-pregnant  adult female. Both were shot over the road in pinyon and juniper. The  specimens are referred to _M. c. stephensi_ on account of their  paleness, _stephensi_ being paler than _M. c. californicus_ from east of  Mesa Verde in Colorado.      Myotis evotis evotis (H. Allen) Long-eared Myotis         _Specimens examined._--Total, 4: Chickaree Draw, Prater Canyon,       8200 ft., MV 7841/507, probably in the summer of 1935; Rock       Springs, 7400 ft., 69241, August 23, 1956, and 69249, August 18,       1956; Museum, Headquarters, 6950 ft., 69251, August 24, 1956.    An adult male (69241) was taken in a Japanese mist net stretched fifteen  feet across a dirt road where it entered the stand of pinyon and juniper  at the south edge of the burn on Wetherill Mesa between 7:20 and 8:30  p.m.; at the same place and time I captured five other bats of four  species: _Myotis thysanodes_, _Myotis subulatus_, _Eptesicus fuscus_,  and _Plecotus townsendii_. A piece of mist net attached to an aluminum  hoop-net two and one half feet in diameter was used to good advantage in  capturing bats rebounding from the larger mist net, and in frightening  bats into the larger net when they approached closely. An adult male  (69249) was shot at 7:20 p.m. while flying six to eight feet from the  ground between pinyon trees up to 20 feet high; the air temperature was  70 deg. F. A female (69251) was found seemingly exhausted on the floor in  the museum at Park Headquarters in the daytime, and was immature as  indicated by small size, open basicranial sutures, unworn teeth, weakly  ossified zygoma, and open epiphyseal sutures of phalanges.      Myotis subulatus melanorhinus (Merriam) Small-footed Myotis         _Specimens examined._--Total, 8: Rock Springs, 7400 ft., 69242,       69244, 69245, 69247, 69248, August 21 to 23, 1956; Hospital, Park       Headquarters, MV 7886/507, [Male], July 12, 1939; Headquarters,       MV 7877/507, [Female], August 30, 1938; 4504 Denver Museum,       within the Park (exact locality not recorded), R.L. Landberg, July       27, 1931.    The specimens from Rock Springs are two adult males that were shot, and  one adult male, one adult female, and one young male that were netted  at the place described in the account of _Myotis evotis_. The three  adult males are near the average color of _M. s. melanorhinus_, and  distinctly darker than the _Myotis californicus_ from the Mesa Verde. In  the female the pelage is paler and brighter, and the ears and membranes  are darker, than in _M. californicus_.      Myotis thysanodes thysanodes Miller Fringed Myotis         _Specimen_: Rock Springs, 7400 ft., 69250, ad. [Female], August       23, 1956; taken in net as noted in account of _Myotis evotis_.      Myotis volans interior Miller Long-legged Myotis         _Specimen_: Rock Springs, 7400 ft., 69252, ad. [Female], August       21, 1956; shot over road.      Eptesicus fuscus pallidus Young Big Brown Bat         _Specimen_: Rock Springs, 7400 ft., 69253, ad. [Female], August       23, 1956; taken in net as noted in account of _Myotis evotis_.      Plecotus townsendii pallescens (Miller) Townsend's Big-eared Bat         _Specimens examined._--Total, 5: Rock Springs, 7400 ft., 69254, ad.       [Female], non-pregnant, August 23, 1956; Square Tower House,       6700 ft., 69255-69258, March, 1955.    The specimen from Rock Springs was taken in a net as noted in the  account of _Myotis evotis_. The specimens from Square Tower House were  obtained by D. Watson in a dimly lighted chamber formed by fracture in  the rocks at the bottom of the canyon wall, above the talus slope. The  bats were suspended from the wall of the chamber, which was at least six  feet wide and fifteen feet long.      Tadarida brasiliensis mexicana (Saussure) Brazilian Free-tailed Bat         _Specimens examined._--Total, 2: Cliff Palace, 6800 ft., MV       7862/507 and 7863/507, males, both collected by A.E. Borell, on       August 23, 1936.      Lepus californicus texianus Waterhouse Black-tailed Jackrabbit    The black-ta"]]]
