There, denuded of its tinsel trappings, your  civilization stands revealed in all the evil reality of its unadorned  shame; and 'tis a ghastly sight, a mass of corruption, an ever-spreading  cancer. Your false civilization is a disease, and capitalism is its most  malignant form; 'tis the acute stage which is breeding into the world a  race of cowards, weaklings and imbeciles; a race of mannikins, lacking  the physical courage and mental initiative to think the thought and do  the deed not inscribed in the book of practice; a race of pigmies,  slaves to tradition and superstition, lacking all force of individuality  and rushing, like wild maniacs, toward the treacherous eddies of that  social cataclysm which has swallowed the far mightier and greater  nations of the ancient world.    It is because of these things that I address myself to you, fellow-men.  Society has not changed during my absence, and yet, to be saved, it  needs to be changed. It needs, above all, real men, men and women of  originality and individuality; men and women, not afraid to brave the  scornful contempt of the conventional mob, men and women brave enough to  break from the ranks of custom and lead into new paths, men and women  strong enough to smash the fatal social lock-step and lead us into new  and happier ways.    And because society has not changed, neither will I. Though the  bloodthirsty hyena of the law has, in its wild revenge, despoiled me of  the fourteen most precious blossoms in the garden of my life, yet I  will, henceforth as heretofore, consecrate what days are left to me in  the service of that grand ideal, the wonderful power of which has  sustained me through those years of torture; and I will devote all my  energies and whatever ability I may have to that noblest of all causes  of a new, regenerated and free humanity; and it shall be more than my  sufficient reward to know that I have added, if ever so little, in  breaking the shackles of superstition, ignorance and tradition, and  helped to turn the tide of society from the narrow lane of its blind  selfishness and self-sufficient arrogance into the broad, open road  leading toward a true civilization, to the new and brighter day of  Freedom in Brotherhood.    [Illustration]          HENRIK IBSEN.    M. B.      I SHALL not attempt to confine him within the rigid lines of any  literary circle; nor shall I press him into the narrow frame of school  or party; nor stamp upon him the distinctive label of any particular  ism. He would break such fetters; his free spirit, his great  individuality would overflow the arbitrary confines of \"the _sole_  Truth,\" \"the _only_ true principle.\" The waves of his soul would break  down all artificial barriers and rush out to join the ever-moving  currents of life.    A seer has died.    He carried the flaming torch of his art behind the scenes of society--he  found there nothing but corruption. He tested the strength of our social  foundations--its pillars shook: they were rotten.    The rays of his genius penetrated the darkness of popular ideals; the  hollow pretences of Philistinism filled his ardent soul with disgust,  and pain. In this mood he wrote \"The League of Youth,\" in which he  exposed the pettiness of bourgeois aspirations and the poverty of their  ideals.    In \"The Enemy of the People\" Ibsen thunders his powerful protest against  the democracy of stupidity, the tyrannous vulgarity of majority rule.  Doctor Stockmann--that is Ibsen himself. How willing and eager the  pigmies and yahoos would have been to stone him.    \"What shameless unconventionality, what shocking daring!\" cried the  Philistines when they beheld the characters portrayed in \"Nora\" (The  Doll's House), \"Wild Duck,\" and in \"The Ghosts\"--living pictures  revealing all the evil hidden by the mask of \"our sacred institutions,\"  \"our holy hearthstone.\" In \"Rosmersholm\" Ibsen ignored even the  inviolability of conscience; for there Ibsen showed how the sick  conscience of Rosmer worked the ruin of Rebecca and himself, by robbing  them of the joy of life.    The moralists howled long and loud.    \"Has Ibsen no ideals? Does the accursed Midas-touch of his mind dissolve  everything, one very Holy of Holies, into the ashes of nothing?\"    Thus spoke self-sufficient arrogance.    But can one read \"Brand\" or \"Peer Gynt\" and ask such questions? No heart  so overflowed with human yearning, no soul ever breathed grander, nobler  ideals than Henrik Ibsen. True, he did not prostrate himself before the  idols of the conventional mob, nor did his sacrificial fires burn on the  altar of mediocrity and cretinism. He did not bow the proud head before  the craven images that the State and Church have created for the  subjugation of the masses. To Ibsen's free soul the morality of slaves  was a nightmare.    His ideal was Individuality, the development of character. He loved the  man that was brave enough to be himself. He immeasurably hated all that  was false; he abhorred all that was petty and small. He loved that true  naturalness which, when most real, requires no effort.    The most severe critic of Ibsen and his art was Ibsen himself. His  attitude towards himself in his last work, \"When We Dead Awaken,\" is  that of the most unprejudiced judge.    What is the result?    We long for life; yet we are eternally chasing will-o'-the-wisps. We  sacrifice ourselves for things which rob us of our Self. The castles we  build prove houses made of cards, upon the first touch falling down.  Instead of living, we philosophize. Our life is an esthetic counterfeit.    A mind of great depth, a soul of prophetic vision has passed away; yet  not without leaving its powerful impress--for Henrik Ibsen stood upon  the heights, and from their loftiest peaks we beheld, with him, the  heavy fogs of the present, and through the rifts we saw the bright rays  of a new sun, the promise of the dawn of a freer, stronger Humanity.    [Illustration]          OBSERVATIONS AND COMMENTS.      Schopenhauer's advice to ignore fools and knaves and not to speak to  them, as the best method of keeping them at a distance, does not seem  drastic enough in these days of the modern newspaper-reporter nuisance.  One may throw them out of the house, nail all the doors and windows, and  stuff up all key-holes; still he will come; he will slide down through  the chimney, squeeze through the sewer-pipes--which, by the way, is the  real field of activity of the journalistic profession.    We Anarchists are usually poor business men, with a few \"happy\"  exceptions, of course; still, we shall have to form an insurance company  against the slugging system of the reporters.    Alexander Berkman barely had a chance to breathe free air, when the  newspaper scarecrows were let loose at his heels. Every  suspicious-looking man, woman and child in New York was assailed as to  Berkman's whereabouts, without avail. Finally these worthy gentlemen  hit upon 210 East Thirteenth street--there the reporters made some  miraculous discoveries. Two lonely hermits, utterly innocent of the ways  of the world and the impertinence of reporters, were marked by the  latter. They triumphed. Never before had they hit upon such simpletons,  of whom they could so easily learn all the secrets of the fraternity of  the Reds.    \"Is it not the custom of your clan to delegate every three days one of  your members to take the life of some ruler?\" they asked.    One of the Reds smiled, knowingly. \"Only one insignificant life in three  days?! How little you know the Anarchists. I want you to understand,  sirs, it is our wont to use just five minutes for each act, which means  864 lives in three days.\"    This was more than the most hardened press detective could stand. They  fled in terror.    [Illustration]    Carl Schurz, politician and career hunter by profession, died May 14th.  He was met at the gate of Hell by the secretary of that institution with  the following question, \"Were you not one of the enthusiasts for the  battle of freedom, in your young days?\"    \"Yes,\" said Carl.    \"If the reports of my men are correct--and I am confident my men are  more reliable than the majority of the newspaper men on your planet--you  were even a Revolutionist?\"    Carl Schurz nodded.    \"And why have you thrown your ideals and convictions overboard?\"    \"There was no money in them,\" Carl replied, sulkily.    The Satanic Secretary nodded to one of his stokers, saying, \"Add 5,000  tons of hard coal to our fires. Here we have a man that sold his soul  for money. He deserves to roast a thousand times more than the ordinary  sinner.\"    [Illustration]    No one considers a thief the patron saint of honesty, nor is a liar  expected to champion the truth. The hangman is not elected as president  of a society for the preservation of human life; why, then, in the name  of common sense, do people continue to see in the State the seat of  justice and the patron saint of those whom it wrongs and outrages daily?    If people would only look closer into the elements of the State, they  would soon behold this trinity--the thief, the liar, and the hangman.    [Illustration]    Free love is condemned; prostitution flourishes. The moralist, who is  the best patron of the dens of prostitution, loudly proclaims the  sanctity and purity of monogamy. The free expression of life's greatest  force--love--must never be tolerated. On the other hand, it is perfectly  respectable to receive a large sum of money from a millionaire  father-in-law for marrying his daughter.    [Illustration]    Rudolph von Jhering, one of the most distinguished theoreticians of  jurisprudence in Europe, wrote, many years ago, \"The way in which one  utilizes his wealth is the best criterion of his character and degree of  culture. The purpose that prompts the investment of his money is the "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/27348"],[0,"The 2007 CIA World Factbook (#2)"],[1," 2156    HIV/AIDS - people living with HIV/AIDS  2157    HIV/AIDS - deaths  2172    Distribution of family income - Gini index  2173    Oil - production  2174    Oil - consumption  2175    Oil - imports  2176    Oil - exports  2177    Median age  2178    Oil - proved reserves  2179    Natural gas - proved reserves  2180    Natural gas - production  2181    Natural gas - consumption  2182    Natural gas - imports  2183    Natural gas - exports  2184    Internet hosts  2185    Investment (gross fixed)  2186    Public debt  2187    Current account balance  2188    Reserves of foreign exchange and gold  2193    Major infectious diseases  2194    Refugees and internally displaced persons  2195    GDP (official exchange rate)  2196    Trafficking in persons        =====================================================================        Rank Orders      [Transcriber's note: To search on a rank order in this file, prefix  the rank's name with \"@\", e.g. \"@Population\".  \"Population\" will find  all occurrences; prefixing it with \"@\" will find the correct location.]        Rank Order pages are presorted lists of data from selected Factbook  data fields. Rank Order pages are generally given in descending order -  highest to lowest - such as Population and Area. The two exceptions are  Unemployment Rate and Inflation Rate, which are in ascending - lowest  to highest - order. Rank Order pages are available for the following 47  fields in six of the nine Factbook categories.

Not all Rank Order pages include the same number of entries because  information for a particular field is not available for all countries.  In addition, not all data fields are suitable for displaying as Rank  Order pages, such as those containing textual information. Textual  information is more readily viewed by clicking on the Field Listing  icon next to the Data field title. The other icon next to the data  field title provides the definition of the field.    All of the 'Rank Order' pages can be downloaded as tab-delimited data  files and can be opened in other applications such as spreadsheets and  databases.

In the Government category, the  \"Capital\" entry has been greatly expanded and now contains up to four  subfields, including significant new information having to do with  time. The subfields consist of the name of the capital itself, its  geographic coordinates, the time difference at the capital from  coordinated universal time (UTC), and, if applicable, information on  daylight saving time (DST). Where appropriate, a special note has been  added to highlight those countries that have multiple time zones. The  Transnational issues category now has a \"Trafficking in persons\" entry.  Human trafficking connotes modern-day slavery and this important new  field will include information on the most egregious countries (Tier 2  Watch List and Tier 3) as listed in the US State Department's annual  report.        Abbreviations:  This information is included in Appendix A:  Abbreviations, which includes all abbreviations and acronyms used in  the Factbook, with their expansions.    Acronyms:  An acronym is an abbreviation coined from the initial letter  of each successive word in a term or phrase. In general, an acronym  made up solely from the first letter of the major words in the expanded  form is rendered in all capital letters (NATO from North Atlantic  Treaty Organization; an exception would be ASEAN for Association of  Southeast Asian Nations). In general, an acronym made up of more than  the first letter of the major words in the expanded form is rendered  with only an initial capital letter (Comsat from Communications  Satellite Corporation; an exception would be NAM from Nonaligned  Movement). Hybrid forms are sometimes used to distinguish between  initially identical terms (WTO: for World Trade Organization and WToO  for World Tourism Organization.)    Administrative divisions:  This entry generally gives the numbers,  designatory terms, and first-order administrative divisions as approved  by the US Board on Geographic Names (BGN). Changes that have been  reported but not yet acted on by BGN are noted.    Age structure:  This entry provides the distribution of the population  according to age. Information is included by sex and age group (0-14  years, 15-64 years, 65 years and over). The age structure of a  population affects a nation's key socioeconomic issues. Countries with  young populations (high percentage under age 15) need to invest more in  schools, while countries with older populations (high percentage ages  65 and over) need to invest more in the health sector. The age  structure can also be used to help predict potential political issues.  For example, the rapid growth of a young adult population unable to  find employment can lead to unrest.    Agriculture - products:  This entry is an ordered listing of major  crops and products starting with the most important.    Airports:  This entry gives the total number of airports or airfields  recognizable from the air. The runway(s) may be paved (concrete or  asphalt surfaces) or unpaved (grass, earth, sand, or gravel surfaces)  but may include closed or abandoned installations. Airports or  airfields that are no longer recognizable (overgrown, no facilities,  etc.) are not included. Note that not all airports have accomodations  for refueling, maintenance, or air traffic control.    Airports - with paved runways:  This entry gives the total number of  airports with paved runways (concrete or asphalt surfaces) by length.  For airports with more than one runway, only the longest runway is  included according to the following five groups - (1) over 3,047 m, (2)  2,438 to 3,047 m, (3) 1,524 to 2,437 m, (4) 914 to 1,523 m, and (5)  under 914 m. Only airports with usable runways are included in this  listing. Not all airports have facilities for refueling, maintenance,  or air traffic control.    Airports - with unpaved runways:  This entry gives the total number of  airports with unpaved runways (grass, dirt, sand, or gravel surfaces)  by length. For airports with more than one runway, only the longest  runway is included according to the following five groups - (1) over  3,047 m, (2) 2,438 to 3,047 m, (3) 1,524 to 2,437 m, (4) 914 to 1,523  m, and (5) under 914 m. Only airports with usable runways are included  in this listing. Not all airports have facilities for refueling,  maintenance, or air traffic control.    Appendixes:  This section includes Factbook-related material by topic.    Area:  This entry includes three subfields. Total area is the sum of  all land and water areas delimited by international boundaries and/or  coastlines. Land area is the aggregate of all surfaces delimited by  international boundaries and/or coastlines, excluding inland water  bodies (lakes, reservoirs, rivers). Water area is the sum of the  surfaces of all inland water bodies, such as lakes, reservoirs, or  rivers, as delimited by international boundaries and/or coastlines.    Area - comparative:  This entry provides an area comparison based on  total area equivalents. Most entities are compared with the entire US  or one of the 50 states based on area measurements (1990 revised)  provided by the US Bureau of the Census. The smaller entities are  compared with Washington, DC (178 sq km, 69 sq mi) or The Mall in  Washington, DC (0.59 sq km, 0.23 sq mi, 146 acres).
