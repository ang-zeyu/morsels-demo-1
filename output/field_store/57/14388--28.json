The  structure has been incomplete, resting upon no solid basis, and only  imperfectly cemented together. Such a state of society has always been a  proper object for the modifying and controlling influences of a purer  system of morality, founded upon a pure religion.    What has been the state of society in times past without the light of  revealed religion? There are evils in the social state where the Christian  religion exists, but they were there before the Gospel of Christ visited  those places. It is very common for unbelievers to charge the calamities  of the social state to the Christian religion, but it is a dishonorable  mode of argumentation. The proper question is this: Has humanity ever been  well organized in the social state without the presence and influence of  the Bible? Has it ever been well governed under such circumstances? Have  men respected the social rights and obligations or properly understood  them in the absence of revealed religion? Has the religion of Christ been  a disturber of the social organization where social rights were properly  understood and regarded? or has it set aside the rights and obligations of  men in social life where men were enjoying peaceable, happy relations?  Does its legitimate influence make men more wicked and miserable? An  honest answer to these questions will commend the religion of Jesus  Christ, and do honor to him as our Lord and Master. The Scriptures have  been the means of establishing institutions which have stood for  centuries. Where society has been disjointed and out of order, without  bonds or adhesiveness, the Scriptures have been introduced, banishing  disorder and bringing peace and good will to man. They have silently  operated in the social surroundings and gradually elevated Pagan lands out  of Paganism. They refine and cleanse the cruel, giving them habits which  make them at once superior to all Pagans.    Look at Rome and Persia in comparison with England and America. The  Persian's religion was the best of all the uninspired religions. They  worshiped their unknown god in the sun, moon and stars. In two reigning  principles they sought for an explanation of the present state of good and  evil mixed, which is the perplexing problem that has always confounded  unenlightened reason. The Persian's creed only exercised his intellect and  gratified his curiosity. It brought no power to bear upon his social  relations. Persian history is a mass of crimes, suffering and intolerance.  The government was a despotism, and polygamy gave laws to the domestic and  private relations of the citizens.    Ancient Rome stands foremost in all that moral culture and philosophy  alone can do for social institutions. Its religion was gross in the  extreme, exerting an unhappy influence upon the masses, while it was  disregarded by the priests who taught it, their sole object being to  terrify the multitude and keep them in subjection to the authorities of  the state. It was said by a Roman, \"Our nation exists more by religion  than by the sword.\" But upon an examination of Roman history you will find  servitude, despotism, tumult, revolt, revolution and slaughter, peace and  war. The ambitions of rivals to the throne, and new schemes of rulers,  often deluged the country with blood and carried the sword to remote and  peaceable nations, till the horrors of civil war were realized in almost  every part of the world. Every now and then the powers of some great mind,  irritated by his calamities, having all the vices and none of the virtues  of his species, would rise up and wreak vengeance in deeds which can not  be thought of without sadness of heart.    How much better was ancient Greece? How much better are modern Pagan  nations? These evils have been extinguished in the ratio of the  circulation and influence of the Bible. The relation between the state and  its citizens the Bible recognizes as of divine appointment; the foundation  of civil government is the will of God. Government is an ordinance of God.  \"The powers that be are ordained of God.\" The great author of our rights,  life, liberty, peace, order, public morals and religion, has not left  these interests to chance, anarchy or the social compact. Rulers were  ordained of God, and are rulers, not for their own exaltation, but for the  tranquility, virtue and peace of the governed. Where are the Pagan rulers  who were taught this great lesson so as to feel its importance? When have  they respected the rights of the people? Where have anti-Christian or  Pagan nations, in a single instance, been actuated by any motive save the  restless, factious determination to sink one tyrant for the sake of  elevating another? In Christian lands a free and virtuous people limit the  authority of rulers and assert the rights of citizens. In our country a  mass of public virtue and a weight of moral influence, that restrains the  wrath of man, keeps us from being involved in an ocean of blood at every  popular election. We are not repeating the history of Rome in this  respect. We have been taught to \"Render unto Caesar the things which belong  to Caesar.\" The apostles of Christ have enjoined upon us the duty of being  subject to the rulers of our land, to submit ourselves to every ordinance  of man for the Lord's sake. We have been taught to pray for our rulers.  While we do this we can not be rebellious. Who is so blind as to not see  that the Scriptures will control our citizens with more benevolence than  any other book or any other maxims or set of opinions. When the Christian  Scriptures are duly regarded and their divine authenticity respected  designing, ambitious, corrupting and aspiring politicians will have but  little power to plunge us into crimes and sufferings.    The most important of all our social institutions is the marriage. It is  the paternal source of all other relations. There is no exhibition of the  divine goodness in conditioning our race that is more significant and  lovely. By it our world is a collection of families in which the tenderest  affections are cherished and the worst generally subdued. Here there is a  community of interests. Here we experience the highest motives to a  virtuous influence, especially in forming the character of the youth of  our country. The race is continually multiplying and enlarging. What  wonderful wisdom was it that consulted its honor, its virtue and eternal  destiny by the appointment of the marriage relation? It was the best  method upon which human society could be organized. There are  narrow-hearted, lustful bigots who would do away the social family  compact. They talk about \"free thought,\" \"free love,\" no restraints of  law, no protection of the mother save the voluntary. Such has been the  custom in a few heathen lands; such is the doctrine of a few modern  infidels; such are the habits of a few gregarious communities in Christian  countries. In these communities the sexes are taught from the cradle to  hate the marriage bond. Such a state of society is poisoned and polluted;  is a fearful mass of corruption and rottenness. All moral safeguards are  removed. The offspring are thrown out upon the world with no restraints of  paternal love and wisdom; no obligations of filial love and reverence;  monsters in iniquity, and in a short time equal in crime to those who were  swept from the earth by the waters of the deluge or the flames of Sodom.  Look then for one moment after the evil of polygamy. It existed for awhile  among the ancient Hebrews. Moses suffered it for the hardness of their  hearts. From the beginning it was not so. It was a perversion of the  ancient institution of matrimony. All the evils of that idolatrous age  could not be remedied in a moment; nothing was made perfect until the  appearance of that wonderful counselor--_Christ_. He restored the primitive  integrity of the marriage institution by revoking polygamy and divorce.  Polygamy was never friendly to the physical and mental character of its  population. It is demonstrated beyond the possibility of a doubt that it  is debasing and brutalizing. The Turks and Asiatics are polygamists, but  they are much inferior to the old Greeks and Romans; yet ancient Rome was  a long ways from Heaven's will in respect of marriage ties.    The matrimonial institution of Rome was a compromise between the right and  the wrong. The institution was considered in the light of a civil  contract, entered into for expediency, and protected by the magistrates  because it was deemed a blessing to society; by the law of the twelve  tables it continued during the pleasure of the husband. The result was  that frequent, and often, rapid succession of divorces and marriages took  the place of polygamy, and introduced many of its evils.    The private history of Roman ladies of first rank is a succession of  marriages and divorces, each new marriage giving way to one more recent.  Octavia, the daughter of the Emperor Claudus, married Nero, was repudiated  by him for the sake of Poppaea; this woman was first married to Rufus  Crispinus; then to Otho; and at length to Nero, by whom she was killed.    Nero murdered Thessalina's husband, and married her for his third wife.  Julia, the daughter of Augustus, was first the wife of Marcellus, then the  wife of Agrippa, and then the wife of Tiberius. Such examples are found  almost without number in the annals of Tacitus. The extent to which this  evil was carried may be learned from the poet Martial, who informs us,  that, when the Julian law against adultery was revived as a prevention of  the corruption of the times, Thessalina married her tenth husband within  thirty days, thus evading all the restraints which the law imposed against  her licentiousness. What is the marriage bond worth in such a state of  society?    Where is the state of society essentially better in the absence of the  Christian religion?"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/2808"],[0,"Treatises on Friendship and Old Age (#2)"],[1,"the constant \"said I\" and \"said he\" of a narrative, and to give  the discourse the air of being orally delivered in our hearing.    You have often urged me to write something on Friendship, and I  quite acknowledged that the subject seemed one worth everybody's  investigation, and specially suited to the close intimacy that has  existed between you and me. Accordingly I was quite ready to benefit the  public at your request.    As to the _dramatis personae_. In the treatise on Old Age, which I  dedicated to you, I introduced Cato as chief speaker. No one, I thought,  could with greater propriety speak on old age than one who had been an  old man longer than any one else, and had been exceptionally vigorous  in his old age. Similarly, having learnt from tradition that of all  friendships that between Gaius Laelius and Publius Scipio was the most  remarkable, I thought Laelius was just the person to support the chief  part in a discussion on friendship which Scaevola remembered him to have  actually taken. Moreover, a discussion of this sort gains somehow in  weight from the authority of men of ancient days, especially if they  happen to have been distinguished. So it comes about that in reading  over what I have myself written I have a feeling at times that it is  actually Cato that is speaking, not I.    Finally, as I sent the former essay to you as a gift from one old man to  another, so I have dedicated this _On Friendship_ as a most affectionate  friend to his friend. In the former Cato spoke, who was the oldest and  wisest man of his day; in this Laelius speaks on friendship--Laelius,  who was at once a wise man (that was the title given him) and eminent  for his famous friendship. Please forget me for a while; imagine Laelius  to be speaking.    Gaius Fannius and Quintus Mucius come to call on their father-in-law  after the death of Africanus. They start the subject; Laelius answers  them. And the whole essay on friendship is his. In reading it you will  recognise a picture of yourself.    2. _Fannius_. You are quite right, Laelius! there never was a better or  more illustrious character than Africanus. But you should consider that  at the present moment all eyes are on you. Everybody calls you \"the  wise\" _par excellence_, and thinks you so. The same mark of respect was  lately paid Cato, and we know that in the last generation Lucius Atilius  was called \"the wise.\" But in both cases the word was applied with  a certain difference. Atilius was so called from his reputation as a  jurist; Cato got the name as a kind of honorary title and in extreme old  age because of his varied experience of affairs, and his reputation  for foresight and firmness, and the sagacity of the opinions which he  delivered in senate and forum. You, however, are regarded as wise in  a somewhat different sense not alone on account of natural ability and  character, but also from your industry and learning; and not in the  sense in which the vulgar, but that in which scholars, give that title.  In this sense we do not read of any one being called wise in Greece  except one man at Athens; and he, to be sure, had been declared by the  oracle of Apollo also to be \"the supremely wise man.\" For those who  commonly go by the name of the Seven Sages are not admitted into the  category of the wise by fastidious critics. Your wisdom people believe  to consist in this, that you look upon yourself as self-sufficing and  regard the changes and chances of mortal life as powerless to affect  your virtue. Accordingly they are always asking me, and doubtless also  our Scaevola here, how you bear the death of Africanus. This curiosity  has been the more excited from the fact that on the Nones of this month,  when we augurs met as usual in the suburban villa of Decimus Brutus for  consultation, you were not present, though it had always been your  habit to keep that appointment and perform that duty with the utmost  punctuality.    _Scaevola_. Yes, indeed, Laelius, I am often asked the question  mentioned by Fannius. But I answer in accordance with what I have  observed: I say that you bear in a reasonable manner the grief which  you have sustained in the death of one who was at once a man of the most  illustrious character and a very dear friend. That of course you could  not but be affected--anything else would have been wholly unnatural in a  man of your gentle nature--but that the cause of your non-attendance at  our college meeting was illness, not melancholy.    _Laelius_. Thanks, Scaevola! You are quite right; you spoke the exact  truth. For in fact I had no right to allow myself to be withdrawn from  a duty which I had regularly performed, as long as I was well, by any  personal misfortune; nor do I think that anything that can happen will  cause a man of principle to intermit a duty. As for your telling me,  Fannius, of the honourable appellation given me (an appellation to  which I do not recognise my title, and to which I make no claim), you  doubtless act from feelings of affection; but I must say that you seem  to me to do less than justice to Cato. If any one was ever \"wise,\"--of  which I have my doubts,--he was. Putting aside everything else, consider  how he bore his son's death! I had not forgotten Paulus; I had seen with  my own eyes Gallus. But they lost their sons when mere children; Cato  his when he was a full-grown man with an assured reputation. Do not  therefore be in a hurry to reckon as Cato's superior even that same  famous personage whom Apollo, as you say, declared to be \"the wisest.\"  Remember the former's reputation rests on deeds, the latter's on words.    3. Now, as far as I am concerned (I speak to both of you now), believe  me the case stands thus. If I were to say that I am not affected by  regret for Scipio, I must leave the philosophers to justify my conduct,  but in point of fact I should be telling a lie. Affected of course I am  by the loss of a friend as I think there will never be again, such as  I can fearlessly say there never was before. But I stand in no need of  medicine. I can find my own consolation, and it consists chiefly in my  being free from the mistaken notion which generally causes pain at the  departure of friends. To Scipio I am convinced no evil has befallen: mine  is the disaster, if disaster there be; and to be severely distressed at  one's own misfortunes does not show that you love your friend, but that  you love yourself.    As for him, who can say that all is not more than well? For, unless he  had taken the fancy to wish for immortality, the last thing of which he  ever thought, what is there for which mortal man may wish that he did  not attain? In his early manhood he more than justified by extraordinary  personal courage the hopes which his fellow-citizens had conceived of  him as a child. He never was a candidate for the consulship, yet was  elected consul twice: the first time before the legal age; the second at  a time which, as far as he was concerned, was soon enough, but was near  being too late for the interests of the State. By the overthrow of two  cities which were the most bitter enemies of our Empire, he put an end  not only to the wars then raging, but also to the possibility of others  in the future. What need to mention the exquisite grace of his manners,  his dutiful devotion to his mother, his generosity to his sisters, his  liberality to his relations, the integrity of his conduct to every  one? You know all this already. Finally, the estimation in which his  fellow-citizens held him has been shown by the signs of mourning which  accompanied his obsequies. What could such a man have gained by the  addition of a few years? Though age need not be a burden,--as I remember  Cato arguing in the presence of myself and Scipio two years before he  died,--yet it cannot but take away the vigour and freshness which Scipio  was still enjoying. We may conclude therefore that his life, from the  good fortune which had attended him and the glory he had obtained, was  so circumstanced that it could not be bettered, while the suddenness  of his death saved him the sensation of dying. As to the manner of his  death it is difficult to speak; you see what people suspect. Thus much,  however, I may say: Scipio in his lifetime saw many days of supreme  triumph and exultation, but none more magnificent than his last, on  which, upon the rising of the Senate, he was escorted by the senators  and the people of Rome, by the allies, and by the Latins, to his own  door. From such an elevation of popular esteem the next step seems  naturally to be an ascent to the gods above, rather than a descent to  Hades.    4. For I am not one of these modern philosophers who maintain that our  souls perish with our bodies, and that death ends all. With me ancient  opinion has more weight: whether it be that of our own ancestors, who  attributed such solemn observances to the dead, as they plainly would  not have done if they had believed them to be wholly annihilated; or  that of the philosophers who once visited this country, and who by their  maxims and doctrines educated Magna Graecia, which at that time was in a  flourishing condition, though it has now been ruined; or that of the man  who was declared by Apollo's oracle to be \"most wise,\" and who used to  teach without the variation which is to be found in most philosophers  that \"the souls of men are divine, and that when they have quitted the  body a return to heaven is open to them, least difficult to those who  have been most virtuous and just.\" This opinion was shared by Scipio.  Only a few days before his death--as though he had a presentiment  of what was coming--he discoursed for three days on the state of the  republic. The company consisted of Philus and Manlius and several  others, and I had brought you, Scaevola, along with me. The last part of  his discourse referred principally to the immortality of the soul; for  he told us"]]]
