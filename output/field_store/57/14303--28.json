REFERENCE INQUIRIES    Once again there has been an increase in the reference questions to  which the Library staff has had to attend. One thousand seven hundred  and seventy-seven inquiries were made, an increase of 322 over the  previous year. Of these, 563 were answered in less than five minutes,  569 took between five and 15 minutes, and the remainder, 645, took over  15 minutes to answer. This statement of times does not record the fact  that many of the inquiries took much longer than 15 minutes. Indeed  some had several days spent on them by one or more members of the  reference staff. Such questions are not answered by merely marking a  passage in a book or two; they require the material to be abstracted  and rewritten ready for use by the member making the inquiry. This  service is becoming increasingly popular with members who cannot  themselves afford the time needed to do all the research involved.    Seventy-eight new research students registered for the first time  during the year, the largest number yet to have done so in any one  year. Some are university students working on theses; others are  engaged on research for publication. The use of the Library in this way  shows how valuable its resources are for many students.                              INTERNATIONAL EXCHANGE    Twenty-four cases were received by the Library for its own use during  the year, while 5,823 packets were received from abroad, 3,685 being  posted, the remainder being forwarded by Internal Affairs messenger.                                 ACKNOWLEDGMENTS    I should once again like to thank the Library Committee for its great  help and interest, and in particular to thank the former Speaker and  Chairman of the Committee, who has recently retired, for his invaluable  assistance in Library matters. We are also indebted to the overseas  agents of the New Zealand Government in many countries for their aid in  obtaining books. They have helped considerably in adding many valuable  books to the Library.    I am also grateful to the Assistant Chief Librarian, Mr Jess, and the  staff for their loyal and efficient service.    Attached is the statement of receipts and expenditure of the General  Assembly Library Fund Account, together with the Auditor-General's  certificate.

THE GENERAL ASSEMBLY LIBRARY                      LIBRARY SERVICE TO PARLIAMENT                                1858-1958                                  THE BEGINNINGS    Today there are few legislatures without a library of some kind.  Parliament works best when its members are well briefed and have access  to good sources of information. The shortest speech often requires the  verification of facts to be found in books, and the most economical and  satisfactory solution is a library. The General Assembly of New  Zealand, to give Parliament its more correct title, was not long in  deciding this. It met first in 1854 and again in 1855 without a  library. At the beginning of the session of 1856, however, the need  seems to have been evident for on 6 June Mr W. T. L. Travers from  Waimea moved in the House that a library should at once be formed, and  a Select Committee set up to consider the best means of establishing  one. Three weeks later the Legislative Council followed suit with a  similar motion, though here it is interesting to note that Dr  Richardson stated that the Councillors had been using the library of  the Attorney-General.    The Assembly shared its meeting place with the Auckland Provincial  Council, which had in 1853 formed its own library. It was decided that  it would be to the advantage of both legislatures to possess a joint  library, and on the motion of the chairman the Council was approached  to find if it had any objections. The Council did not have any, and in  addition offered to provide the librarian and an equal grant for books  as well as fittings if the Assembly would provide a room.    On 28 July 1856 the report was laid on the tables of the two Houses, a  list of books for purchase given to the Speakers, and a recommendation  made that the sum of L100 be placed on the estimates for books. The  money was voted, after which Parliament was adjourned, not to meet  again until 1858.    The Committee was once again set up, and the situation was such that  once again the terms of reference were to consider the best means of  establishing a library. The books ordered in 1856, principally on legal  and constitutional matters, were there branded \"General Assembly\" but  they were not a library; members had to rely largely on the Provincial  Council collection which comprised nine-tenths of the total books  available. In its report, the Committee suggested that L300 be devoted  to library purposes, and recommended a list of books to be purchased  even if they cost more than the L320 available--L20 had not been spent  in 1856.    The Committee was not happy about the joint Library, but as matters  stood thought it hardly desirable to end the arrangement. It was,  however, of the opinion that as soon as practicable the Library should  be placed on an independent footing.    To ensure that its recommendations were carried out, and to control and  report on the work of the Library, the Committee suggested that an  officer, the Librarian of the General Assembly, should be appointed.  This was done and the first Librarian was Major F. E. Campbell, the  Clerk of the House of Representatives.    Two other matters also were considered of sufficient moment to be  mentioned. One was the supply of newspapers that had been cancelled as  the Government had promised to supply files from Government offices.  The other was the acquisition of British Government publications, which  would be of great value to the Library. The Committee noted the  successful approach of the Canadian Parliamentary Librarian to the  British Government and proposed that either Mr J. E. Fitzgerald, who  was in England, or the Colonial Agent should be asked to see if the  Library could not be given such documents.    Once again two years elapsed before Parliament met again, and the  Librarian reported that there were now books, separated from the  Provincial Council Library, but in an adjoining room. The approaches to  the British Government had not been entirely fruitful, but there was  promise of success.                                    1860-1870    The Library now possessed books and a librarian and the next 10 years  were to be amongst the most adventurous of the Library's story.  However, they began quietly when in 1861 the Committee recommended the  appointment of a permanent messenger for the Library instead of a  sessional one.    Next year the session was held in Wellington in the Provincial Council  Chambers. A case of books was sent for use of members. Unfortunately it  was lost when the _White Swan_ carrying the Governor and Auckland  members was wrecked near Castlepoint. The published list gives 50  books, mainly reference works on constitutional and economic matters,  but the greater loss was that of the House, which was deprived of not  only its documentary records but also most of the early printed papers.  The Committee, nothing daunted, recommended that the books be replaced  and used the mishap to have the vote raised to L500 for the year.    The sessions of 1863 and 1864 were both held in Auckland. In the latter  year the Librarian was instructed to prepare cases so that the books  could be moved to Wellington along with the other Government records.    Parliament took over the old Provincial Council Chambers in Wellington  but they were enlarged to meet its requirements. The Library had a new  home built specially for it costing L1,800 which was, with extensions,  to provide an uneasy resting place for the next 35 years. In one paper  the new library was described as \"a very lofty handsome building with  large painted windows\". In another, \"The Library is a fine room,  handsomely decorated and the walls are fitted with bookshelves.\" It was  of wood.    Details about the administration of the Library during the early years  are few, but it appears that the Committee was undoubtedly the  mainspring of the organisation. It contained men such as Carleton,"]]]
