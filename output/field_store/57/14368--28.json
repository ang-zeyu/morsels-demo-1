Not all Rank Order pages include the same number of entries because  information for a particular field is not available for all countries.  In addition, not all data fields are suitable for displaying as Rank  Order pages, such as those containing textual information. Textual  information is more readily viewed by clicking on the Field Listing  icon  next to the Data field title. The other icon next to the data  field title provides the definition of the field.    All of the Rank Order pages can be downloaded as tab-delimited data  files and can be opened in other applications such as spreadsheets and  databases. To save a Rank Order page in a spreadsheet, first click on  the Download Datafile choice above the Rank Order page you selected;  then, at the top of your browser window, click on 'File' and 'Save As'.  After saving the file, open the spreadsheet, find the saved file, and  'Open' it.    Additional Rank Order pages being considered for future updates of the  Factbook Web site include:    Median age  Literacy  Population below the poverty line  Highways  Waterways  Airports    This page was last updated on 21 October, 2003        =====================================================================        Appendixes      Appendix A - Abbreviations    Appendix B - International Organizations and Groups    Appendix C - Selected International Environmental Agreements    Appendix D - Cross-Reference List of Country Data Codes    Appendix E - Cross-Reference List of Hydrographic Data Codes    Appendix F - Cross-Reference List of Geographic Names        ======================================================================        Notes and Definitions      In addition to the updated information, The World Factbook printed  version features seven new entries. In the People category, an entry  has been added for Median age. In the Economy category, entries have  been added for Oil - production, Oil - consumption, Oil - exports, Oil  - imports, Oil - proved reserves, and Natural gas - proved reserves.  The web site version features four additional entries: Natural gas -  production, Natural gas - consumption, Natural gas - exports, and  Natural gas - imports. Revision of some individual country maps, first  introduced in the 2001 edition, is continued in this edition. The  revised maps include elevation extremes and a partial geographic grid.  Several regional maps have also been updated to reflect boundary  changes and place name spelling changes.        Abbreviations  This information is included in Appendix A: Abbreviations, which  includes all abbreviations and acronyms used in the Factbook, with  their expansions.    Acronyms  An acronym is an abbreviation coined from the initial letter of each  successive word in a term or phrase. In general, an acronym made up  solely from the first letter of the major words in the expanded form is  rendered in all capital letters (NATO from North Atlantic Treaty  Organization; an exception would be ASEAN for Association of Southeast  Asian Nations). In general, an acronym made up of more than the first  letter of the major words in the expanded form is rendered with only an  initial capital letter (Comsat from Communications Satellite  Corporation; an exception would be NAM from Nonaligned Movement).  Hybrid forms are sometimes used to distinguish between initially  identical terms (WTO: WTrO for World Trade Organization and WToO for  World Tourism Organization).    Administrative divisions  This entry generally gives the numbers, designatory terms, and first-  order administrative divisions as approved by the US Board on  Geographic Names (BGN). Changes that have been reported but not yet  acted on by BGN are noted.    Age structure  This entry provides the distribution of the population according to  age. Information is included by sex and age group (0-14 years, 15-64  years, 65 years and over). The age structure of a population affects a  nation's key socioeconomic issues. Countries with young populations  (high percentage under age 15) need to invest more in schools, while  countries with older populations (high percentage ages 65 and over)  need to invest more in the health sector. The age structure can also be  used to help predict potential political issues. For example, the rapid  growth of a young adult population unable to find employment can lead  to unrest.    Agriculture - products  This entry is a rank ordering of major crops and products starting with  the most important.    Airports  This entry gives the total number of airports. The runway(s) may be  paved (concrete or asphalt surfaces) or unpaved (grass, dirt, sand, or  gravel surfaces), but must be usable. Not all airports have facilities  for refueling, maintenance, or air traffic control.    Airports - with paved runways  This entry gives the total number of airports with paved runways  (concrete or asphalt surfaces). For airports with more than one runway,  only the longest runway is included according to the following five  groups - (1) over 3,047 m, (2) 2,438 to 3,047 m, (3) 1,524 to 2,437 m,  (4) 914 to 1,523 m, and (5) under 914 m. Only airports with usable  runways are included in this listing. Not all airports have facilities  for refueling, maintenance, or air traffic control.    Airports - with unpaved runways  This entry gives the total number of airports with unpaved runways  (grass, dirt, sand, or gravel surfaces) by length. For airports with  more than one runway, only the longest runway is included according to  the following five groups - (1) over 3,047 m, (2) 2,438 to 3,047 m, (3)  1,524 to 2,437 m, (4) 914 to 1,523 m, and (5) under 914 m. Only  airports with usable runways are included in this listing. Not all  airports have facilities for refueling, maintenance, or air traffic  control    Appendixes  This section includes Factbook-related material by topic.    Area  This entry includes three subfields. Total area is the sum of all land  and water areas delimited by international boundaries and/or  coastlines. Land area is the aggregate of all surfaces delimited by  international boundaries and/or coastlines, excluding inland water  bodies (lakes, reservoirs, rivers). Water area is the sum of all water  surfaces delimited by international boundaries and/or coastlines,  including inland water bodies (lakes, reservoirs, rivers).    Area - comparative  This entry provides an area comparison based on total area equivalents.  Most entities are compared with the entire US or one of the 50 states  based on area measurements (1990 revised) provided by the US Bureau of  the Census. The smaller entities are compared with Washington, DC (178  sq km, 69 sq mi) or The Mall in Washington, DC (0.59 sq km, 0.23 sq mi,  146 acres).    Background  This entry usually highlights major historic events and current issues  and may include a statement about one or two key future trends.    Birth rate  This entry gives the average annual number of births during a year per  1,000 persons in the population at midyear; also known as crude birth  rate. The birth rate is usually the dominant factor in determining the  rate of population growth. It depends on both the level of fertility  and the age structure of the population.    Budget  This entry includes revenues, total expenditures, and capital  expenditures.  These figures are calculated on an exchange rate basis,  i.e., not in purchasing power parity (PPP) terms    Capital  This entry gives the location of the seat of government.    Climate  This entry includes a brief description of typical weather regimes  throughout the year.    Coastline  This entry gives the total length of the boundary between the land area  (including islands) and the sea.    Communications  This category deals with the means of exchanging information and  includes the telephone, radio, television, and Internet service  provider entries.    Communications - note  This entry includes miscellaneous communications information of  significance not included elsewhere.    Constitution  This entry includes the dates of adoption, revisions, and major  amendments.    Country data codes  see Data codes    Country map  Most versions of the Factbook provide a country map in color. The maps  were produced from the best information available at the time of  preparation. Names and/or boundaries may have changed subsequently.    Country name  This entry includes all forms of the country's name approved by the US  Board on Geographic Names (Italy is used as an example): conventional  long form (Italian Republic), conventional short form (Italy), local  long form (Repubblica Italiana), local short form (Italia), former  (Kingdom of Italy), as well as the abbreviation. Also see the  Terminology note.    Currency  This entry identifies the national medium of exchange and its basic  subunit.    Crude oil  See \"Oil\" entries    Currency code  This entry gives the International Organization for Standardization  (ISO) 4217 alphabetic currency code for each country.
