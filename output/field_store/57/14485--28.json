The  readers will themselves judge of the skill with which the  translator has acquitted herself of her task, and the author  gladly leaves to her the honor and the responsibility for the  translation.    But how can I express all I owe to M. Israel Levi, my honored  master? Without him this work would never have been begun,  without him I should never have dared carry it to completion.  I  have contracted a debt toward him 'which grows from day to day,  and I discharge but the smallest portion of it by dedicating this  volume to the memory of his never-to-be-forgotten father-in-law,  the Grand-Rabbin Zadoc-Kahn.  M. Zadoc-Kahn made a name for  himself in Jewish letters by his <I>Etudes sur le livre de Joseph  le Zelateur,</I> dealing with one of the most curious domains of  that literature in which Rashi was the foremost representative.  One of his last public acts was the appeal which he issued on the  occasion of the Rashi centenary.  It is not a slight satisfaction  to me to know that these pages passed under his eyes in  manuscript.                                                       M.

Friendliness simply  isn't a natural instinct.\"    \"Who's being anthropomorphic now!\" Harkaway chided.    Iversen flushed, for he had berated the young man for that particular  fault on more than one occasion. Harkaway was too prone to interpret  alien traits in terms of terrestrial culture. Previously, since all  intelligent life-forms with which the _Herringbone_ had come into  contact had already been discovered by somebody else, that didn't matter  too much. In this instance, however, any mistakes of contact or  interpretation mattered terribly. And Iversen couldn't see Harkaway not  making a mistake; the boy simply didn't have it in him.    \"You know you're superimposing our attitude on theirs,\" the junior  officer continued tactlessly. \"The Flimbotzik are a simple, friendly,  _shig-livi_ people, closely resembling some of our historical  primitives--in a nice way, of course.\"    \"None of our primitives had space travel,\" Iversen pointed out.    \"Well, you couldn't really call those things spaceships,\" Harkaway said  deprecatingly.    \"They go through space, don't they? I don't know what else you'd call  them.\"    \"One judges the primitiveness of a race by its cultural and  technological institutions,\" Harkaway said, with a lofty smile. \"And  these people are laughably backward. Why, they even believe in  reincarnation--_mpoola_, they call it.\"    \"How do you know all this?\" Iversen demanded. \"Don't tell me you profess  to speak the language already?\"    \"It's not a difficult language,\" Harkaway said modestly, \"and I have  managed to pick up quite a comprehensive smattering. I dare-say I  haven't caught all the nuances--_heeka lob peeka_, as the Flimbotzik  themselves say--but they are a very simple people and probably they  don't have--\"    \"Are we going to keep them waiting,\" Iversen asked, \"while we discuss  nuances? Since you say you speak the language so well, suppose you make  them a pretty speech all about how the Earth government extends the--I  suppose it would be hand, in this instance--of friendship to Flimbot  and--\"    Harkaway blushed. \"I sort of did that already, acting as your deputy.  _Mpoo_--status--means so much in these simple societies, you know, and  they seemed to expect something of the sort. However, I'll introduce you  to the Flimflim--the king, you know--\" he pointed to an imposing  individual in the forefront of the crowd--\"and get over all the  amenities, shall I?\"    \"It would be jolly good of you,\" Iversen said frigidly.           *       *       *       *       *    It was a pity they hadn't discovered Flimbot much earlier in their  survey of the Virago System, Iversen thought with regret, because it was  truly a pleasant spot and a week was very little time in which to  explore a world and study a race, even one as simple as the gentle  Flimbotzik actually turned out to be. It seemed amazing that they should  have developed anything as advanced as space travel, when their only  ground conveyances were a species of wagon drawn by plookik, a species  of animal.    But Iversen had no time for further investigation. The _Herringbone's_  fuel supply was calculated almost to the minute and so, willy-nilly, the  Earthmen had to leave beautiful Flimbot at the end of the week, knowing  little more about the Flimbotzik than they had before they came. Only  Harkaway, who had spent the three previous weeks on Flimbot, had any  further knowledge of the Flimbotzik--and Iversen had little faith in any  data he might have collected.    \"I don't believe Harkaway knows the language nearly as well as he  pretends to,\" Iversen told the first officer as both of them watched  the young lieutenant make the formal speech of farewell.    \"Come now,\" the first officer protested. \"Seems to me the boy is doing  quite well. Acquired a remarkable command of the language, considering  he's been here only four weeks.\"    \"Remarkable, I'll grant you, but is it accurate?\"    \"He seems to communicate and that is the ultimate objective of language,  is it not?\"    \"Then why did the Flimbotzik fill the tanks with wine when I distinctly  told him to ask for water?\"    Of course the ship could synthesize water from its own waste products,  if necessary, but there was no point in resorting to that expedient when  a plentiful supply of pure H_{2}O was available on the world.    \"A very understandable error, sir. Harkaway explained it to me. It seems  the word for water, _m'koog_, is very similar to the word for wine,  _mk'oog_. Harkaway himself admits his pronunciation isn't perfect and--\"    \"All right,\" Iversen interrupted. \"What I'd like to know is what  happened to the _mk'oog_, then--\"    \"The m'koog, you mean? It's in the tanks.\"    \"--because, when they came to drain the wine out of the tanks to put the  water in, the tanks were already totally empty.\"    \"I have no idea,\" the first officer said frostily, \"no idea at all. If  you'll glance at my papers, you'll note I'm Temperance by affiliation,  but if you'd like to search my cabin, anyway, I--\"    \"By Miaplacidus, man,\" Iversen exclaimed, \"I wasn't accusing you! Of  that, anyway!\"    Everybody on the vessel was so confoundedly touchy. Lucky they had a  stable commanding officer like himself, or morale would simply go to  pot.           *       *       *       *       *    \"Well, it's all over,\" Harkaway said, joining them up at the airlock in  one lithe bound--a mean feat in that light gravity. \"And a right good  speech, if I do say so myself. The Flimflim says he will count the  thlubbzik with ardent expectation until the mission from Earth arrives  with the promised gifts.\"    \"Just what gifts did you take it upon yourself to--\" Iversen began, when  he was interrupted by a voice behind them crying, \"Woe, woe, woe!\"    And, thrusting himself past the three other officers, Dr. Smullyan  addressed the flim'puu, or farewell committee, assembled outside the  ship. \"Do not let the Earthmen return to your fair planet, O happily  ignorant Flimbotzik,\" he declaimed, \"lest wretchedness and misery be  your lot as a result. Tell them, 'Hence!' Tell them, 'Begone!' Tell  them, 'Avaunt!' For, know ye, humanity is a blight, a creeping canker--\"    He was interrupted by the captain's broad palm clamping down over his  mouth.    \"Clap him in the brig, somebody, until we get clear of this place,\"  Iversen ordered wearily. \"If Harkaway could pick up the Flimbotzi  language, the odds are that some of the natives have picked up Terran.\"    \"That's right, always keep belittling me,\" Harkaway said sulkily as two  of the crewmen carried off the struggling medical officer, who left an  aromatic wake behind him that bore pungent testimonial to where a part,  at least, of the _mk'oog_ had gone. \"No wonder it took me so long to  find myself.\"    \"Oh, have you found yourself at last?\" Iversen purred. \"Splendid! Now  that you know where you are, supposing you do me a big favor and go lose  yourself again while we make ready for blastoff.\"    \"For shame,\" said the first officer as Harkaway stamped off. \"For  shame!\"    \"The captain's a hard man,\" observed the chief petty officer, who was  lounging negligently against a wall, doing nothing.    \"Ay, that he is,\" agreed the crewman who was assisting him. \"That he  is--a hard man, indeed.\"    \"By Caroli, be quiet, all of you!\" Iversen yelled. The very next voyage,  he was going to have a new crew if he had to transfer to Colonization to  do it! Even colonists couldn't be as obnoxious as the sons of space with  which he was cursed.           *       *       *       *       *    It was only after the _Herringbone_ had left the Virago System entirely  that Iversen discovered Harkaway had taken the greech along.    \"But you can't abscond with one of the natives' pets!\" he protested,  overlooking, for the sake of rhetoric, the undeniable fact that Harkaway  had already done so and that there could be no turning back. It would  expend too much precious fuel and leave them stranded for life on Virago  XI^a.    \"Nonsense, sir!\" Harkaway retorted. \"Didn't the Flimflim say everything  on Flimbot was mine? _Thlu'pt shig-nliv, snusnigg bnig-nliv_ were his  very words. Anyhow, they have plenty more greechi. They won't miss this  little one.\"    \"But he may have belonged to someone,\" Iversen objected. \"An incident  like this could start a war.\"    \"I don't see how he could have belonged to anyone. Followed me around  most of the time I was there. We've become great pals, haven't we,  little fellow?\" He ruffled the greech's pink fur and the creature gave a  delighted squeal.    Iversen could already see that the greechik were going to be Flimbot's  first lucrative export. From time immemorial, the people of Earth had  been susceptible to cuddly little life-forms, which was why Earth had  nearly been conquered by the zz^{iu} from Sirius VII, before they  discovered them to be hostile and quite intelligent life-forms rather  than a new species of tabby.    \"Couldn't bear to leave him,\" Harkaway went on as the greech draped  itself around his shoulders and regarded Iversen with large round blue  eyes. \"The Flimflim won't mind, because I promised him an elephant.\"    \"You mean the diplomatic mission will have to waste valuable cargo space  on an _elephant_!\" Iversen sputtered. \"And you should know, if anyone  does, just how spacesick an elephant can get. By Pherkad, Lieutenant  Harkaway, you had no authority to make any promises to the Flimflim!\"    \"I discovered the Flimbotzik,\" Harkaway said sullenly. \"_I_ learned the  language. _I_ established rapport. Just because you happen to be the  commander of this expedition doesn't mean you're God, Captain Iversen!\"    \"Harkaway,\" the captain barked, \"this smacks of downright mutiny! Go to  your cabin forthwith and memorize six verses of the Spaceman's Credo!\"    The greech lifted its head and barked back at Iversen, again. \"That's my  brave little watch-greech,\""]]]
