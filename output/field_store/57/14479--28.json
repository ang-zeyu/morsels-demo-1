[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/31570"],[0,"A Taxonomic Study of the Middle American Snake, Pituophis deppei (#2)"],[1,"the anterior part of the body. There are 209 to 232  ventrals and 52 to 62 caudals. The body-blotches number 27 to 49. In  adults the anterior and posterior body-blotches are black; the lateral  intercalary spots are solid black. In many individuals black dashes  connect the adjacent corners of the dorsal body-blotches (Pl. 45, Fig.  1). In juveniles the anterior, dorsal body-blotches are black, whereas  those at the midbody and posteriorly are brown.    _Variation._--Geographically, scutellation varies only slightly.  Comparison of specimens from the northern part of the Mexican Plateau  (Chihuahua, Coahuila, and Durango--5 specimens), the central part of the  plateau (Aguascalientes, San Luis Potos['i], and Zacatecas--13 specimens),  the southern part of the plateau (Guanajuato, Jalisco, M['e]xico, and  Michoac['a]n--18 specimens), and Puebla and southern Veracruz (12  specimens) shows the average number of ventrals for these samples to be,  respectively, 221.6, 216.7, 221.3, and 220.0. The average number of  dorsal body-blotches for the same samples are, respectively, 36.6,  37.7, 38.4, and 34.6. Only in the southernmost sample is there a  noticeable difference in the number of blotches.    The specimen from P['a]rajo Verde, Veracruz, was considered to be an  intergrade between _P. deppei_ and _P. lineaticollis_ by Smith (1943:  461), who stated that, although the snake had 231 ventrals and dark  lateral streaks as does _deppei_, it had light-centered dorsal blotches  and stripes on the neck as does _lineaticollis_. This specimen (USNM  110892) has a high number of ventrals for _deppei_; one from Jalisco has  232, and one each from Guanajuato and Veracruz have 229. The blotches  posteriorly are lighter than those anteriorly and are slightly lighter  in the center than at the periphery. Two anterior blotches are divided  medially and narrowly connected by black streaks. Although these are  somewhat suggestive of the pattern of _lineaticollis_, they are more  nearly like that of _deppei_. Four other specimens from the same area  are typically _deppei_. There is some doubt as to the actual provenance  of the snake stated to have come from P['a]rajo Verde, for, according to  Smith (1943: 460), the snake had been tied to a truck and dragged  halfway down the slopes of the Cumbres de Acultzingo, where he found it.  He surmised that it probably was dragged no farther than the settlement,  P['a]rajo Verde, at the Cumbres de Acultzingo.    Fugler and Webb (1956: 171) commented on the uniformly brown dorsum of a  specimen (KU 39564) from 16 miles east and 18 miles north of Ocampo,  Coahuila. It has a higher number of ventrals (242) and caudals (88) than  is known for deppei. It is, without a doubt, a _Pituophis_. It is not  _Pituophis catenifer_, as attested to by the presence of only two  prefrontals. The high number of ventrals and caudals, together with the  uniform dark brown dorsum, provide a combination of characters  indicating that this specimen may represent an undescribed species in  the _deppei_ group of _Pituophis_.    _Distribution._--Southern Chihuahua and southern Coahuila southward on  the western and central parts of the Mexican Plateau to the Valley of  M['e]xico and to southeastern Puebla and adjacent Veracruz.    _Specimens examined._--Total of 63, as follows: _Aguascalientes_: 16 km.

Couch.    _Diagnosis._--This subspecies is characterized by solid body-blotches  that are black anteriorly and brown posteriorly, anterior dorsal  interspaces six or more scales in length, and the absence of dark  stripes or rows of spots on the anterior part of the body. There are 215  to 235 ventrals, 52 to 68 caudals, and 21 to 31 dorsal body-blotches.  The position of the lateral intercalary spots and lateral streaks are  the same as in _deppei deppei_.    _Variation._--Throughout the range of this subspecies the posterior  body-blotches are brown and noticeably lighter than the anterior ones.  Juveniles are colored like adults. Specimens from the northern part of  the range (Nuevo Le['o]n and Tamaulipas) have 21 to 28 (average 24.0)  dorsal body-blotches and 7 to 11 (average 8.9) scales in the interspace  between the first and second dorsal body-blotches, as compared with  specimens from the southern part of the range (Hidalgo, Queretaro, and  San Luis Potos['i]), which have 24 to 31 (average 27.7) dorsal  body-blotches and 6 to 10 (average 7.8) scales in the first interspace.  Likewise, there is a difference in the number of ventrals between the  northern and southern samples; those from the north have an average of  228.8 ventrals, and those from the south have 222.0. In all of these  characters the southern sample shows trends towards the southern  subspecies, _deppei_, which has fewer ventrals, fewer scales in the  first interspace, and more dorsal body-blotches.    _Distribution._--Eastern part of the Mexican Plateau and lower leeward  slopes of the Sierra Madre Oriental from Hidalgo and Queretaro northward  to southeastern Coahuila.    _Specimens examined._--Total of 28, as follows: _Coahuila_: Buena Vista,  USNM 1522; 50 km.

Cope (1861: 300 and 1887: 72) stated  that the specimen was from the southern Mexican Plateau and that it was  collected by Carlos Sartorius. Smith and Taylor (1945: 108 and 1950:  348) gave the type locality as Jalapa, Veracruz. Although this locality  was the source of many specimens sent to the United States by Sartorius,  it is not within the known range of _lineaticollis_, and therefore  cannot appropriately be thought of as the type locality. In the absence  of a type specimen and a justifiable type locality, I hereby designate  as a neotype, University of Michigan Museum of Zoology, No. 114668. This  specimen was collected 24 kilometers northwest of Ciudad Oaxaca, Oaxaca,  on February 29, 1956, by William E. Duellman. It is an adult female  having 229 ventrals, 67 caudals, and long black neck-stripes followed  posteriorly by 23 light-centered dorsal body-blotches.    _Diagnosis._--This subspecies is characterized by the presence of  continuous dark paravertebral stripes on the anterior part of the body,  and light-centered dorsal body-blotches and lateral intercalary spots  (Pl. 45, Fig. 2). There are 229 to 258 ventrals, 54 to 72 caudals, and  23 to 45 dorsal body-blotches posterior to the neck-stripes. The young  are"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/31574"],[0,"A New Subspecies of Slider Turtle (Pseudemys scripta) from Coahuila, México (#2)"],[1,"to have vertical, linear arrangement; cutting edge of mandible  weakly serrate; femoral edges of plastron not reflected ventrally; one  or more fine, pale lines between two major stripes on antebrachium;  gular longer than pectoral in one specimen, longer than femoral in  both specimens. The nature of these specimens suggests that parts of  the Rio Salado drainage north and east of Cuatro Cienegas are in a  zone of intergradation between _taylori_ and _elegans_. I have  examined what I consider to be typical examples of _P. s._ _elegans_  from the region of Muzquiz (CNHM 28843-45, 55625-45), and from Don  Martin Reservoir (KU 33524). These localities are, respectively,  approximately 70 miles north-northeast and 100 miles east-northeast of  Cuatro Cienegas. The specimens from Muzquiz are presumably the same  that Carr (1952:262) treated as \"... _elegans-cataspila_ intergrades,  but with a strong leaning toward eastern _elegans_....\" Populations of  _P. scripta_ in central eastern Coahuila (between the above-mentioned  localities and Cuatro Cienegas) probably are a conglomerate of only  two subspecies (_elegans_ and _taylori_), not including _gaigeae_ (as  was suggested by Hamilton, 1947:65 and by Carr, op. cit.:241, map  17;262).    Specimens reported by Schmidt and Owens (1944:101) as _P. s. gaigeae_  (from several localities in the region mentioned above) have been  examined in the course of my study and prove to be _P. floridana  texana_. A specimen reported by Shannon and Smith (1949:399; IU 4094,  Hidalgo Co., Texas) as being either _gaigeae_ or an _elegans-gaigeae_  intergrade, has been examined and is here regarded as a typical  specimen of _elegans_. I regard _P. s. gaigeae_ as a subspecies of the  upper Rio Grande and disrupted parts of that drainage; the range of  that subspecies meets that of _P. s. elegans_ somewhere between the  Big Bend region and Piedras Negras. In any event, the influence of  _gaigeae_ is not so widespread as other authors (Carr, _loc. cit._;  Hamilton, _loc. cit._; Hartweg, 1939:3-4) have indicated.    Further collecting in the Rio Salado and its tributaries east and  north of Cuatro Cienegas will be necessary before the exact range of  _P. s. taylori_ can be determined.    _Variation._--Characteristics ascribed to the holotype pertain in  general to all specimens in the hypodigm, except as noted below. The  postorbital mark is in contact with the eye on one or both sides in 46  per cent of the specimens (narrowly separated from eye in remainder)  and is in contact with a neck stripe (on one or both sides) in 35 per  cent of the specimens. The pattern of the antebrachium is as shown in  Fig. 2 in all specimens except that the thin lateral stripe is  obliterated by melanism in older specimens of both sexes. The lateral  edges of the posterior plastral lobe are reflected downward, at least  slightly, in all but one specimen (an adult, kyphotic female). The  first central lamina is straight-sided in juveniles and becomes  urn-shaped only in adults. The relative height of the shell tends to  increase with a general increase in size in both sexes.        [Illustration: FIG. 1. _Pseudemys scripta taylori_ new      subspecies: left side of head, female paratype (KU 46933),      x 1.]        [Illustration: FIG. 2. _Pseudemys scripta taylori_ new      subspecies: anterior view of left antebrachium, female      paratype (KU 46934), x 1.]    _Comparisons._--Of the five other subspecies of Mexican _P. scripta_  mentioned above, three subspecies (_gaigeae_, _hiltoni_, and  _nebulosa_) form a natural group herein referred to as the _gaigeae_  group. _Pseudemys s. taylori_ is distinguished from members of the  _gaigeae_ group by elongate, red postorbital mark (yellow or orange in  the _gaigeae_ group), extensive black plastral pattern (narrow--or if  wide, brownish--in _gaigeae_ group), and serrate lower jaw (nearly  smooth in _gaigeae_ group).    The subspecies _P. scripta taylori_ differs from _P. scripta elegans_  as indicated in the following comparative list of characteristics:              _P. s. taylori_                    _P. s. elegans_      1. Extensive black plastral        1. Plastral pattern consisting       pattern, all parts of which        of separate brown smudges (at       are interconnected. Plastral       least anteriorly).

Foreclaws of mature males       unmodified.                        greatly elongated.      5. Gular shorter than pectoral     5. Gular longer than pectoral       (91 per cent of specimens),        (90 per cent of specimens)       gular and femoral subequal.        and longer than femoral (all                                          specimens).      6. Shell relatively higher,        6. Shell relatively lower,       posterior lobe of plastron         posterior lobe of plastron       relatively narrower (Fig. 3).      relatively wider (Fig. 3).      7. Lateral edges of posterior      7. Lateral edges of posterior       plastral lobe reflected            plastral lobe unmodified.       downward.    Four specimens of _P. s. ornata_ (MCZ 46392-3, 46397, 46400, two adult  females and two adult males) from the Rio Soto la Marina drainage of  Tamaulipas differ from _P. s. taylori_ as follows: plastral pattern  diffuse and brownish, not black; gular longer than pectoral; cutting  edge of lower jaw only slightly serrate; stripe on mandibular  symphysis isolated, not joined with ventral neck stripes to form  inverted Y; postorbital stripe (yellow in preservative) connected to  eye by narrow isthmus and continuous with neck stripe to shoulder.    In _P. s. taylori_ there is an obtuse ridge or prominence across the  bridge, on a line joining the free lateral edges of the plastron; the  area between the ridges is nearly flat. The bridge forms a distinct  plane on each side between the mentioned ridge and the outer edges of  the marginals. In cross section this plane forms an angle of 30 to 45  degrees with the horizontal plane of the plastron. The higher bridge  and deeper shell of _taylori_ result in a slightly higher center of  gravity in this subspecies than in the specimens of _elegans_ and  _ornata_ I have examined. In the two subspecies last named the  longitudinal ridges on the plastron are indistinct or wanting and the  bridge forms a lesser angle with the horizontal plane of the plastron.    The largest female of _taylori_ (218 mm.) is shorter by some 30 mm.  than the smaller female in the series of _ornata_ from Tamaulipas  whereas the largest male of _taylori_ (179 mm.) is shorter by some  80 mm. than the smaller male from Tamaulipas. _Pseudemys s. taylori_  probably is smaller, on the average, than either _elegans_ or northern  populations of _ornata_.    There seems to be no reliable published record of the color of  the postorbital mark in living examples of _P. s. ornata_ from  Tamaulipas. Williams (1956:147, 154) indicated that this color may be  red or yellow for Mexican and Central American populations of _ornata_  in general and Guenther (1885: Pl. 6 b) indicated that the color  was yellow in _Emys cataspila_; however, both of the observations  mentioned were presumably based on preserved rather than living  specimens. The postorbital marks of a live specimen of _ornata_  (KU 40131) from southern Veracruz were yellowish to buffy with a  pinkish tinge anteriorly (_fide_ notes of Robert G. Webb and a color  photograph by him).        [Illustration: FIG. 3.
