He believed that in the  next instant he would be in another world; he had heard the command  given, had heard the click of the Mausers as the locks caught--and then,  at that supreme moment, a human hand had been laid upon his shoulder and  a voice spoke in his ear.    You would expect that any man, snatched back to life in such a fashion  would start and tremble at the reprieve, or would break down altogether,  but this boy turned his head steadily, and followed with his eyes the  direction of the officer's sword, then nodded gravely, and, with his  shoulders squared, took up the new position, straightened his back, and  once more held himself erect.    As an exhibition of self-control this should surely rank above feats of  heroism performed in battle, where there are thousands of comrades to  give inspiration.  This man was alone, in sight of the hills he knew,  with only enemies about him, with no source to draw on for strength but  that which lay within himself.                        [Picture: The death of Rodriguez]    The officer of the firing squad, mortified by his blunder, hastily  whipped up his sword, the men once more levelled their rifles, the sword  rose, dropped, and the men fired.  At the report the Cuban's head snapped  back almost between his shoulders, but his body fell slowly, as though  some one had pushed him gently forward from behind and he had stumbled.    He sank on his side in the wet grass without a struggle or sound, and did  not move again.    It was difficult to believe that he meant to lie there, that it could be  ended so without a word, that the man in the linen suit would not rise to  his feet and continue to walk on over the hills, as he apparently had  started to do, to his home; that there was not a mistake somewhere, or  that at least some one would be sorry or say something or run to pick him  up.    But, fortunately, he did not need help, and the priests returned--the  younger one with the tears running down his face--and donned their  vestments and read a brief requiem for his soul, while the squad stood  uncovered, and the men in hollow square shook their accoutrements into  place, and shifted their pieces and got ready for the order to march, and  the band began again with the same quickstep which the fusillade had  interrupted.    The figure still lay on the grass untouched, and no one seemed to  remember that it had walked there of itself, or noticed that the  cigarette still burned, a tiny ring of living fire, at the place where  the figure had first stood.    The figure was a thing of the past, and the squad shook itself like a  great snake, and then broke into little pieces and started off jauntily,  stumbling in the high grass and striving to keep step to the music.    The officers led it past the figure in the linen suit, and so close to it  that the file closers had to part with the column to avoid treading on  it.  Each soldier as he passed turned and looked down on it, some craning  their necks curiously, others giving a careless glance, and some without  any interest at all, as they would have looked at a house by the  roadside, or a hole in the road.    One young soldier caught his foot in a trailing vine, just opposite to  it, and fell.  He grew very red when his comrades giggled at him for his  awkwardness.  The crowd of sleepy spectators fell in on either side of  the band.  They, too, had forgotten it, and the priests put their  vestments back in the bag and wrapped their heavy cloaks about them, and  hurried off after the others.    Every one seemed to have forgotten it except two men, who came slowly  towards it from the town, driving a bullock-cart that bore an unplaned  coffin, each with a cigarette between his lips, and with his throat  wrapped in a shawl to keep out the morning mists.    At that moment the sun, which had shown some promise of its coming in the  glow above the hills, shot up suddenly from behind them in all the  splendor of the tropics, a fierce, red disk of heat, and filled the air  with warmth and light.    The bayonets of the retreating column flashed in it, and at the sight a  rooster in a farm-yard near by crowed vigorously, and a dozen bugles  answered the challenge with the brisk, cheery notes of the reveille, and  from all parts of the city the church bells jangled out the call for  early mass, and the little world of Santa Clara seemed to stretch itself  and to wake to welcome the day just begun.    But as I fell in at the rear of the procession and looked back, the  figure of the young Cuban, who was no longer a part of the world of Santa  Clara, was asleep in the wet grass, with his motionless arms still  tightly bound behind him, with the scapular twisted awry across his face,  and the blood from his breast sinking into the soil he had tried to free.          THE GREEK-TURKISH WAR: THE BATTLE OF VELESTINOS {2}      The Turks had made three attacks on Velestinos on three different days,  and each time had been repulsed.  A week later, on the 4th of May, they  came back again, to the number of ten thousand, and brought four  batteries with them, and the fighting continued for two more days.  This  was called the second battle of Velestinos.   In the afternoon of the 5th  the Crown Prince withdrew from Pharsala to take up a stronger position at  Domokos, and the Greeks under General Smolenski, the military hero of the  campaign, were forced to retreat, and the Turks came in, and, according  to their quaint custom, burned the village and marched on to Volo.  John  Bass, the American correspondent, and myself were keeping house in the  village, in the home of the mayor.  He had fled from the town, as had  nearly all the villagers; and as we liked the appearance of his house, I  gave Bass a leg up over the wall around his garden, and Bass opened the  gate, and we climbed in through his front window.  It was like the  invasion of the home of the Dusantes by Mrs. Lecks and Mrs. Aleshine,  and, like them, we were constantly making discoveries of fresh  treasure-trove.  Sometimes it was in the form of a cake of soap or a tin  of coffee, and once it was the mayor's fluted petticoats, which we tried  on, and found very heavy.  We could not discover what he did for pockets.  All of these things, and the house itself, were burned to ashes, we were  told, a few hours after we retreated, and we feel less troubled now at  having made such free use of them.    On the morning of the 4th we were awakened by the firing of cannon from a  hill just over our heads, and we met in the middle of the room and  solemnly shook hands.  There was to be a battle, and we were the only  correspondents on the spot.  As I represented the London _Times_, Bass  was the only representative of an American newspaper who saw this fight  from its beginning to its end.    We found all the hills to the left of the town topped with long lines of  men crouching in little trenches.  There were four rows of hills.  If you  had measured the distance from one hill-top to the next, they would have  been from one hundred to three hundred yards distant from one another.  In between the hills were gullies, or little valleys, and the beds of  streams that had dried up in the hot sun.  These valleys were filled with  high grass that waved about in the breeze and was occasionally torn up  and tossed in the air by a shell.  The position of the Greek forces was  very simple.  On the top of each hill was a trench two or three feet deep  and some hundred yards long.  The earth that had been scooped out to make  the trench was packed on the edge facing the enemy, and on the top of  that some of the men had piled stones, through which they poked their  rifles.  When a shell struck the ridge it would sometimes scatter these  stones in among the men, and they did quite as much damage as the shells.  Back of these trenches, and down that side of the hill which was farther  from the enemy, were the reserves, who sprawled at length in the long  grass, and smoked and talked and watched the shells dropping into the  gully at their feet.    The battle, which lasted two days, opened in a sudden and terrific storm  of hail.  But the storm passed as quickly as it came, leaving the  trenches running with water, like the gutters of a city street after a  spring shower; and the men soon sopped them up with their overcoats and  blankets, and in half an hour the sun had dried the wet uniforms, and the  field-birds had begun to chirp again, and the grass was warm and  fragrant.  The sun was terribly hot.  There was no other day during that  entire brief campaign when its glare was so intense or the heat so  suffocating.  The men curled up in the trenches, with their heads pressed  against the damp earth, panting and breathing heavily, and the heat-waves  danced and quivered about them, making the plain below flicker like a  picture in a cinematograph.    From time to time an officer would rise and peer down into the great  plain, shading his eyes with his hands, and shout something at them, and  they would turn quickly in the trench and rise on one knee.  And at the  shout that followed they would fire four or five rounds rapidly and  evenly, and then, at a sound from the officer's whistle, would drop back  again and pick up the cigarettes they had placed in the grass and begin  leisurely to swab out their rifles with a piece of dirty rag on a  cleaning rod.  Down in the plain below there was apparently nothing at  which they could shoot except the great shadows of the clouds drifting  across the vast checker-board of green and yellow fields, and  disappearing finally between the mountain passes beyond.  In some places  there were square dark patches that might have been bushes, and nearer to  us than these were long lines of fresh earth, from which steam seemed to  be escaping in little wisps.

In John Burroughs' \"Birds and Poets\" this master singer is described  as the most melodious of our songsters, with the exception of the Wood  Thrush, a bird whose strains, more than any other's, express harmony and  serenity, and he complains that no merited poetic monument has yet been  reared to it. But there can be no good reason for complaining of the  absence of appreciative prose concerning the Hermit. One writer says:  \"How pleasantly his notes greet the ear amid the shrieking of the wind  and the driving snow, or when in a calm and lucid interval of genial  weather we hear him sing, if possible, more richly than before. His  song reminds us of a coming season when the now dreary landscape will be  clothed in a blooming garb befitting the vernal year--of the song of the  Blackbird and Lark, and hosts of other tuneful throats which usher in  that lovely season. Should you disturb him when singing he usually drops  down and awaits your departure, though sometimes he merely retires to a  neighboring tree and warbles as sweetly as before.\"    In \"Birdcraft\" Mrs. Wright tells us, better than any one else, the story  of the Hermit. She says: \"This spring, the first week in May, when  standing at the window about six o'clock in the morning, I heard an  unusual note, and listened, thinking it at first a Wood Thrush and then  a Thrasher, but soon finding that it was neither of these I opened the  window softly and looked among the near by shrubs, with my glass. The  wonderful melody ascended gradually in the scale as it progressed, now  trilling, now legato, the most perfect, exalted, unrestrained, yet  withal, finished bird song that I ever heard. At the first note I caught  sight of the singer perching among the lower sprays of a dogwood tree.  I could see him perfectly: it was the Hermit Thrush. In a moment he  began again. I have never heard the Nightingale, but those who have say  that it is the surroundings and its continuous night singing that make  it even the equal of our Hermit; for, while the Nightingales sing in  numbers in the moonlit groves, the Hermit tunes his lute sometimes in  inaccessible solitudes, and there is something immaterial and immortal  about the song.\"    The Hermit Thrush is comparatively common in the northeast, and in  Pennsylvania it is, with the exception of the Robin, the commonest of  the Thrushes. In the eastern, as in many of the middle states, it is  only a migrant. It is usually regarded as a shy bird. It is a species of  more general distribution than any of the small Thrushes, being found  entirely across the continent and north to the Arctic regions. It is  not quite the same bird, however, in all parts of its range, the Rocky  Mountain region being occupied by a larger, grayer race, while on the  Pacific coast a dwarf race takes its place. It is known in parts of New  England as the \"Ground Swamp Robin,\" and in other localities as \"Swamp  Angel.\"    True lovers of nature find a certain spiritual satisfaction in the song  of this bird. \"In the evening twilight of a June day,\" says one of  these, \"when all nature seemed resting in quiet, the liquid, melting,  lingering notes of the solitary bird would steal out upon the air and  move us strangely. What was the feeling it awoke in our hearts? Was  it sorrow or joy, fear or hope, memory or expectation? And while we  listened, we thought the meaning of it all was coming; it was trembling  on the air, and in an instant it would reach us. Then it faded, it was  gone, and we could not even remember what it had been.\"           [Illustration: From col. F. M. Woodruff.                  HERMIT THRUSH.                  Copyrighted by Nature Study Pub. Co., 1897, Chicago.]    THE HERMIT THRUSH.      I am sorry, children, that I cannot give you a specimen of my song as an  introduction to the short story of my life. One writer about my family  says it is like this: \"O spheral, spheral! O holy, holy! O clear away,  clear away! O clear up, clear up!\" as if I were talking to the weather.  May be my notes do sound something like that, but I prefer you should  hear me sing when I am alone in the woods, and other birds are silent.  It is ever being said of me that I am as fine a singer as the English  Nightingale. I wish I could hear this rival of mine, and while I have  no doubt his voice is a sweet one, and I am not too vain of my own, I  should like to \"compare notes\" with him. Why do not some of you children  ask your parents to invite a few pairs of Nightingales to come and  settle here? They would like our climate, and would, I am sure, be  welcomed by all the birds with a warmth not accorded the English  Sparrow, who has taken possession and, in spite of my love for secret  hiding places, will not let even me alone.    When you are older, children, you can read all about me in another part  of BIRDS. I will merely tell you here that I live with you only from May  to October, coming and going away in company with the other Thrushes,  though I keep pretty well to myself while here, and while building my  nest and bringing up my little ones I hide myself from the face of man,  although I do not fear his presence. That is why I am called the Hermit.    If you wish to know in what way I am unlike my cousin Thrushes in  appearance, turn to pages 84 and 182, Vol. 1, of BIRDS. There you will  see their pictures. I am one of the smallest of the family, too. Some  call me \"the brown bird with the rusty tail,\" and other names have been  fitted to me, as Ground Gleaner, Tree Trapper, and Seed Sower. But I do  not like nicknames, and am just plain,                                           HERMIT THRUSH.          THE SONG SPARROW.        Glimmers gay the leafless thicket      Close beside my garden gate,      Where, so light, from post to wicket,      Hops the Sparrow, blithe, sedate;      Who, with meekly folded wing,      Comes to sun himself and sing.        It was there, perhaps, last year,      That his little house he built;      For he seemed to perk and peer      And to twitter, too, and tilt      The bare branches in between,      With a fond, familiar mien.                  --GEORGE PARSONS LATHROP.      We do not think it at all amiss to say that this darling among song  birds can be heard singing nearly everywhere the whole year round,  although he is supposed to come in March and leave us in November. We  have heard him in February, when his little feet made tracks in the  newly fallen snow, singing as cheerily as in April, May, and June, when  he is supposed to be in ecstacy. Even in August, when the heat of the  dog-days and his moulting time drive him to leafy seclusion, his liquid  notes may be listened for with certainty, while \"all through October  they sound clearly above the rustling leaves, and some morning he comes  to the dogwood by the arbor and announces the first frost in a song that  is more direct than that in which he told of spring. While the chestnuts  fall from their velvet nests, he is singing in the hedge; but when the  brush heaps burn away to fragrant smoke in November, they veil his song  a little, but it still continues.\"    While the Song Sparrow nests in the extreme northern part of Illinois,  it is known in the more southern portions only as a winter resident.  This is somewhat remarkable, it is thought, since along the Atlantic  coast it is one of the most abundant summer residents throughout  Maryland and Virginia, in the same latitudes as southern Illinois, where  it is a winter sojourner, abundant, but very retiring, inhabiting almost  solely the bushy swamps in the bottom lands, and unknown as a song bird.  This is regarded as a remarkable instance of variation in habits with  locality, since in the Atlantic states it breeds abundantly, and is  besides one of the most familiar of the native birds.    The location of the Song Sparrow's nest is variable; sometimes on the  ground, or in a low bush, but usually in as secluded a place as its  instinct of preservation enables it to find. A favorite spot is a deep  shaded ravine through which a rivulet ripples, where the solitude is  disturbed only by the notes of his song, made more sweet and clear by  the prevailing silence.           [Illustration: From col. F. M. Woodruff.                  SONG SPARROW.                  Copyrighted by Nature Study Pub. Co., 1897, Chicago.]    THE SONG SPARROW.      DEAR YOUNG READERS:    I fancy many of the little folks who are readers of BIRDS are among my  acquaintances. Though I have never spoken to you, I have seen your eyes  brighten when my limpid little song has been borne to you by a passing  breeze which made known my presence. Once I saw a pale, worn face turn  to look at me from a window, a smile of pleasure lighting it up. And I  too was pleased to think that I had given some one a moment's happiness.  I have seen bird lovers (for we have lovers, and many of them) pause on  the highway and listen to my pretty notes, which I know as well as any  one have a cheerful and patient sound, and which all the world likes,  for to be cheered and encouraged along the pathway of life is like a  pleasant medicine to my weary and discouraged fellow citizens. For you  must know I am a citizen, as my friend Dr. Coues calls me, and all my  relatives. He and Mrs. Mabel Osgood Wright have written a book about  us called \"Citizen Bird,\" and in it they have supported us in all our  rights, which even you children are beginning to admit we have. You are  kinder to us than you used to be. Some of you come quickly to our rescue  from untaught and thoughtless boys who, we think, if they were made to  know how sensitive we are to suffering and wrong, would turn to be our  friends and protectors instead. One dear boy I remember well (and he is  considered a hero by the Song Sparrows) saved a nest of our birdies from  a cruel school boy robber. Why should not "]]]
