[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/27609"],[0,"The Undersea Tube (#2)"],[1,"have had a talk  on the Tube. After it began to function as well as the Air-Express you  sort of lost interest in it.\"    \"And the world did too.\"    \"Certainly--but the public ever was a fickle mistress. Who said that  before me?\"    He laughed and blew out a long puff of smoke.    \"Everyone, Bob.\"    \"But as to the Tube, if I cross under the sea, I would want to be as  well informed on the road as I was three years ago. Now in the meantime,  you have dropped interest in the long tunnel while I have become more  interested in textiles--with the result that I have forgotten all I ever  did know--which compared to your grasp of the details, was little  enough.\"           *       *       *       *       *    But his face showed none of the old-time animation on the subject. What  a different man, I mused to myself, from that enthusiastic engineering  student that I used to come upon dreaming over his blue-prints. He was  considered \"half-cracked\" in those days when he would enthuse over his  undersea railroad, but his animated face was lit with inspiration. Now  the light was gone.    \"Well, Dutch, how about it? Aren't you going to make me that brief  little sketch of the length plan and cross-section of the Tube? I  remember your sketch of it in college, and it tends to confuse me with  the real changes that were made necessary when the wind-propulsion  method was adopted.\"    \"All right, old timer. You remember that the Tube was widened at the  sides in order that we could make two circular tubes side by side--one  going each way.\"    \"I had forgotten that they were circular.\"    \"That is because of the pressure. A circle presents the best  resistance,\" and picking an odd envelope from his pocket, he made the  following sketch and passed it to me.    [Illustration:--CROSS-SECTION OF TUBE--]    I nodded as I recognized the cross-section.    \"Now the plan of the thing is like this,\" he added, putting aside his  pipe and pulling a sheet of paper from the corner of his desk.    Rapidly, with all his old accuracy, he sketched the main plan and leaned  over as he handed it to me.    [Illustration:--PLAN OF UNDER-SEA TUBE--]    \"You see,\" he explained, picking up his pipe again, \"both pumps work at  one time--in fact, I should say all four, because this plan is  duplicated on the English side. On both ends then, a train is gently  pushed in by an electric locomotive. A car at a time goes through the  gate so that there is a cushion of air between each car. The same thing  happens at Liverpool. Now, when the due train comes out of the suction  tube, it goes on out the gate, but the air behind it travels right on  around and comes in behind the train that is leaving.\"    \"But how are you assured that it will not stall somewhere?\"    \"It won't be likely to with pressure pumps going behind it and suction  pumps pulling from in front. We can always put extra power on if  necessary. Thus far the road has worked perfectly.\"    \"How much power do you need to send it through, under normal  conditions?\"    \"Our trains have been averaging about fifty tons, and for that weight we  have found that a pound pressure is quite sufficient. Now, taking the  tunnel's length as four thousand miles (of course it is not that long,  but round figures are most convenient) and the tube width eleven and one  quarter feet each and working this out we have 3,020,000 cubic feet of  free air per minute or 2,904,000 cubic feet of compressed air, which  would use about 70,000 horse power on the air compressor.\"    \"But isn't the speed rather dizzy?\"    \"Not any more dizzy, Bob, than those old fashioned money-carrying  machines that the department stores used to use--that is in comparison  to size. The average speed is about 360 feet a second. Of course, the  train is allowed to slow down toward the end of its run, even before it  hits the braking machinery beyond the gate.\"    \"But how much pressure did you say would be put on the back of the  diaphragm--I remember that each car has a flat disc on the back that  fits fairly tightly to the tube ...\"    \"The pressure on the back is less than seven tons. However, the disc  does not fit tight. There are several leaks. For instance, the cars are  as you know, run on the principle of the monorail with a guiding rail on  each side. The grooves for the rails with their three rollers are in  each car. There is a slight leakage of air here.\"    \"You used the turbo type of blower, didn't you?\"    \"Had to because of the noise. We put some silencing devices on that and  yet we could not kill all of the racket. However a new invention has  come up that we will make use of soon now.\"           *       *       *       *       *    \"But I can't understand, Dutch, why you seemed so put out when I  announced my intention of going to Europe via the Tube. Why, I can  remember the day when that would have tickled you to death.\"    \"You followed the digging of the Tube, didn't you?\"    \"Yes, of course.\"    \"You remember the volcano and lava seams?\"    \"Yes.\"    \"Well, I do not believe that the crack was a pressure crevice. If it had  been, we were far enough below the ocean floor to have partly relieved  the situation by the unusually solid building of the Tube. The  tremendous shell of this new type of specially hardened metal--\"    \"And the rich concrete that was used as filling! That was one job no one  slipped up on. I remember how you watched it--\"    \"Yet the crack has widened, Bob, since the Tube was completed.\"    \"How can you be certain?\"    \"By the amount of water coming through the drain pipes.\"    \"But you said that once more it was stationary.\"    \"Yes, and that is the very thing that proves, I believe, the nature of  the crack.\"    \"I don't follow you.\"    \"Why it isn't a crack at all, Bob. It is an earthquake fault.\"    \"Good heavens, you don't mean--\"    \"Yes, I do. I mean that the next time the land slips our little tube  will be twisted up like a piece of string, or crushed like an eggshell.  That always was a rocky bit of land. I thought in going that far north,  though, that we had missed the main line of activity; I mean the  disturbances that had once wiped out a whole nation, if your scientists  are correct.\"    \"Then you mean that it is only a matter of time?\"    \"Yes, and I have been informed by one expert that the old volcanic  activity is not dead either.\"    \"So that is what has stolen away your laugh?\"    \"Well I am one of the engineers--and they won't suspend the service.\"    \"Fate has played an ugly trick on you, Dutch, and through your own  dreams too. However, you have made me decide to go by the Tube.\"    He took his pipe out of his mouth and stared at me.    \"Sooner or later the Tube will be through, and I have never been across.  Nothing risked--a dull life. Mine has been altogether too dull. I am now  most certainly going by the Tube.\"    A bit of the old fire lit up his eyes.    \"Same old Bob,\" he grunted as I rose, and then he grasped my hand with a  grin.    \"Good luck, my boy, on your journey, and may old Vulcan be out on a  vacation when you pass his door.\"    Thus we said good-by. I did not know then that I would never see him  again--that he also took the train that night in order to make one last  plea to the International Committee, and so laid down his life with the  passengers for whom he had pleaded.    It was with many conflicting thoughts, however, that I hurried to the  great Terminus that fatal night, where after being ticketed,  photographed and tabulated by an efficient army of clerks, I found  myself in due time, being ushered to my car of the train.           *       *       *       *       *    For the benefit of those who have never ridden upon the famous \"Flier,\"  I could describe the cars no better than to say that coming upon them by  night as I did, they looked like a gigantic, shiny worm, of strange  shape, through whose tiny port-holes of heavy glass in the sides, glowed  its luminous vitals.    I was pompously shown to the front car, which very much resembled a  tremendous cartridge--as did all of the other segments of this great  glow-worm.    Having dismissed the porter with a tip and the suspicion that my having  the front car was the work of my friend, who was willing to give me my  money's worth of thrill, and that the porter was aware of this, I stowed  away my bags and started to get ready for bed. I had no sooner taken off  my coat than the door was opened and an old fellow with a mass of silver  hair peered in at me.    \"I beg your pardon, sir, but I understand you have engaged this car  alone?\"    \"Yes.\"    \"I can get no other accommodations tonight. You have an extra berth  here and I must get to Paris tomorrow. I will pay you well--\"    I smiled.    \"Take it. I was beginning to feel lonesome, anyway.\"    He bowed gravely and ordered the porter to bring in his things. I  decided he was a musician. Only artists go in for such lovely hair. But  he undressed in dignified silence, not casting so much as another glance  in my direction, while on my part I also forgot his presence when,  looking through the port-hole, I realized that the train had begun to  move. Soon the drone of the propelling engines began to make itself  heard. Then the train began to dip down and the steel sides of the  entrance became too high for me to see over. My friend of the silver  hair had already turned off the light, and now I knew by the darkness  that we had entered the Tube. For some time I lay awake thinking of  \"Dutch\" and the ultimate failure of his life's dream, as he had outlined  it to me, and then I sank into a deep, dreamless sleep.    I was awakened by a terrible shock that hurled me up against the side of  the compartment. A dull, red glow poured through the port-hole, lighting  up the interior with a weird, bloody reflection. I crept painfully up to  the port-hole and looked out. The strangest sight that man has ever  looked upon met my eyes.

The age structure can also be  used to help predict potential political issues. For example, the rapid  growth of a young adult population unable to find employment can lead  to unrest.    Agriculture - products  This entry is a rank ordering of major crops and products starting with  the most important.    Airports  This entry gives the total number of airports. The runway(s) may be  paved (concrete or asphalt surfaces) or unpaved (grass, dirt, sand, or  gravel surfaces), but must be usable. Not all airports have facilities  for refueling, maintenance, or air traffic control.    Airports - with paved runways  This entry gives the total number of airports with paved runways  (concrete or asphalt surfaces). For airports with more than one runway,  only the longest runway is included according to the following five  groups - (1) over 3,047 m, (2) 2,438 to 3,047 m, (3) 1,524 to 2,437 m,  (4) 914 to 1,523 m, and (5) under 914 m. Only airports with usable  runways are included in this listing. Not all airports have facilities  for refueling, maintenance, or air traffic control.    Airports - with unpaved runways  This entry gives the total number of airports with unpaved runways  (grass, dirt, sand, or gravel surfaces). For airports with more than  one runway, only the longest runway is included according to the  following five groups - (1) over 3,047 m, (2) 2,438 to 3,047 m, (3)  1,524 to 2,437 m, (4) 914 to 1,523 m, and (5) under 914 m. Only  airports with usable runways are included in this listing. Not all  airports have facilities for refueling, maintenance, or air traffic  control    Appendixes  This section includes Factbook-related material by topic.    Area  This entry includes three subfields. Total area is the sum of all land  and water areas delimited by international boundaries and/or  coastlines. Land area is the aggregate of all surfaces delimited by  international boundaries and/or coastlines, excluding inland water  bodies (lakes, reservoirs, rivers). Water area is the sum of all water  surfaces delimited by international boundaries and/or coastlines,  including inland water bodies (lakes, reservoirs, rivers).    Area - comparative  This entry provides an area comparison based on total area equivalents.  Most entities are compared with the entire US or one of the 50 states  based on area measurements (1990 revised) provided by the US Bureau of  the Census. The smaller entities are compared with Washington, DC (178  sq km, 69 sq mi) or The Mall in Washington, DC (0.59 sq km, 0.23 sq mi,  146 acres).    Background  This entry usually highlights major historic events and current issues  and may include a statement about one or two key future trends.    Birth rate  This entry gives the average annual number of births during a year per  1,000 persons in the population at midyear; also known as crude birth  rate. The birth rate is usually the dominant factor in determining the  rate of population growth. It depends on both the level of fertility  and the age structure of the population.    Budget  This entry includes revenues, total expenditures, and capital  expenditures.  These figures are calculated on an exchange rate basis,  i.e., not in purchasing power parity (PPP) terms    Capital  This entry gives the location of the seat of government.    Climate  This entry includes a brief description of typical weather regimes  throughout the year.    Coastline  This entry gives the total length of the boundary between the land area  (including islands) and the sea.    Communications  This category deals with the means of exchanging information and  includes the telephone, radio, television, and Internet service  provider entries.    Communications - note  This entry includes miscellaneous communications information of  significance not included elsewhere.    Constitution  This entry includes the dates of adoption, revisions, and major  amendments.    Country data codes  see Data codes    Country map  Most versions of the Factbook provide a country map in color. The maps  were produced from the best information available at the time of  preparation. Names and/or boundaries may have changed subsequently.    Country name  This entry includes all forms of the country's name approved by the US  Board on Geographic Names (Italy is used as an example): conventional  long form (Italian Republic), conventional short form (Italy), local  long form (Repubblica Italiana), local short form (Italia), former  (Kingdom of Italy), as well as the abbreviation. Also see the  Terminology note.    Currency  This entry identifies the national medium of exchange and its basic  subunit.    Currency code  This entry gives the International Organization for Standardization  (ISO) 4217 alphabetic currency code for each country.    Data codes  This information is presented in Appendix D:  Cross-Reference List of  Country Data Codes and Appendix E:  Cross-Reference List of  Hydrographic Data Codes.  This appendix includes the US Government  approved Federal Information Processing Standards (FIPS) codes, the  International Organization for Standardization (ISO) codes, and  Internet codes for land entities.  The appendix also includes the  International Hydrographic Organization (IHO) codes, Aeronautical Chart  and Information Center (ACIC; now a part of the National Imagery and  Mapping Agency or NIMA) codes, and Defense Intelligence Agency (DIA)  codes for hydrographic entities. The US Government has not yet approved  a standard for hydrographic data codes similar to the FIPS 10-4  standard for country data codes.    Date of information  In general, information available as of 1 January 2001, was used in the  preparation of this edition.    Death rate  This entry gives the average annual number of deaths during a year per  1,000 population at midyear; also known as crude death rate. The death  rate, while only a rough indicator of the mortality situation in a  country, accurately indicates the current mortality impact on  population growth. This indicator is significantly affected by age  distribution, and most countries will eventually show a rise in the  overall death rate, in spite of continued decline in mortality at all  ages, as declining fertility results in an aging population.    Debt - external  This entry gives the total amount of public foreign financial  obligations.    Dependency status  This entry describes the formal relationship between a particular  nonindependent entity and an independent state.    Dependent areas  This entry contains an alphabetical listing of all nonindependent  entities associated in some way with a particular independent state.    Diplomatic representation  The US Government has diplomatic relations with 185 independent states,  including 183 of the 189 UN members (excluded UN members are Bhutan,  Cuba, Iran, Iraq, North Korea, and the US itself). In addition, the US  has diplomatic relations with 2 independent states that are not in the  UN - Holy See and Switzerland.    Diplomatic representation from the US  This entry includes the chief of mission, embassy address, mailing  address, telephone number, FAX number, branch office locations,  consulate general locations, and consulate locations.    Disputes - international  This entry includes a wide variety of situations that range from  traditional bilateral boundary disputes to unilateral claims of one  sort or another. Information regarding disputes over international  terrestrial and maritime boundaries has been reviewed by the US  Department of State. References to other situations involving borders  or frontiers may also be included, such as resource disputes,  geopolitical questions, or irredentist issues; however, inclusion does  not necessarily constitute official acceptance or recognition by the US  Government.    Economic aid - donor  This entry refers to net official development assistance (ODA) from  OECD nations to developing countries and multilateral organizations.  ODA is defined as financial assistance that is concessional in  character, has the main objective to promote economic development and  welfare of the less developed countries (LDCs), and contains a grant  element of at least 25%. The entry does not cover other official flows  (OOF) or private flows.    Economic aid - recipient  This entry, which is subject to major problems of definition and  statistical coverage, refers to the net inflow of Official Development  Finance (ODF) to recipient countries. The figure includes assistance  from the World Bank, the IMF, and other international organizations and  from individual nation donors. Formal commitments of aid are included  in the data. Omitted from the data are grants by private organizations.  Aid comes in various forms including outright grants and loans. The  entry thus is the difference between new inflows and repayments.    Economy  This category includes the entries dealing with the size, development,  and management of productive resources, i.e., land, labor, and capital.    Economy - overview  This entry briefly describes the type of economy, including the degree  of market orientation, the level of economic development, the most  important natural resources, and the unique areas of specialization. It  also characterizes major economic events and policy changes in the most  recent 12 months and may include a statement about one or two key  future macroeconomic trends.    Electricity - consumption  This entry consists of total electricity generated annually plus  imports and minus exports, expressed in kilowatt-hours. The discrepancy  between the amount of electricity generated and/or imported and the  amount consumed and/or exported is accounted for as loss in  transmission and distribution.    Electricity -"]]]
