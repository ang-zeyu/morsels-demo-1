[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/24652"],[0,"Diversions in Sicily (#2)"],[1," a tumbler of oil, floated a  burning wick.  In a corner was the landlord putting his whole soul into  the turning about of a sieve full of coffee beans which he had roasted  and was now cooling.  And everything was covered with a grey dust like  the bloom on a plum or like Cicciu.    Our table was spread in a clearing among the pottery in the front part of  the room and everything was ready on a clean white cloth, wine and all.  Besides the landlord and his wife there were two men in uniform, one a  corporal of the coastguards and the other a policeman.  There was also a  third man in ordinary clothes--I did not find out what he was, but they  were all, including the landlord, friends of Angelo who, in his capacity  of padrone, invited them to join us at lunch.  We were just about to  begin when I missed Cicciu.  Angelo said we need not wait for him, he had  only gone to the sea to wash his feet.  So we sat down without him and  presently he returned saying he had washed all over, but he looked just  as dusty as before his bath.    There must be something in the air of Selinunte that encourages bathing,  for they told me that in a few days an annual festa was to take place  there, the pilgrims arriving the evening before and spending the whole  night bathing in the sea, the men in one part and the women in another;  at dawn they would come out of the water, dress and attend to their  religious duties.  I said I should like very much to see it, whereupon  the corporal, who sat next me and clinked glasses with me every time he  drank, invited me to stay--there would be plenty of room in the caserma  and they could make me comfortable for as long as I would remain.  I had,  however, made appointments elsewhere, so I told him it was unfortunate,  but I could not alter my plans and was sorry I must decline his  invitation.    After lunch by general consent we all went strolling up the cliff and  through a garden belonging to a large house.  I assumed that Angelo had  been arranging something in dialect and asked the corporal, who happened  to be next me, where we were going.  He first picked a geranium most  politely and stuck it in my button-hole; then he told me we were going to  the big house which was the caserma.  It appeared that he had been so  overcome by my hospitality that he had invited Angelo to bring me to call  upon the brigadier and his companions-in-arms at the guard-house.  It was  really Angelo who had shown the hospitality, nevertheless, though not  directly responsible for all details, I was responsible for having  shifted the responsibility on Angelo by making him padrone of the  expedition, so that the hospitality was in a sense mine.  But if left to  myself, I should never have had the courage to invite two such  influential members of the legal profession as a coastguard and a  policeman to lunch with me, not to speak of the third man who might have  been anything from a sheriff's officer to the Lord Chancellor himself.  But they were all friends of Angelo and so was I and in Sicily the maxim  \"Gli amici dei nostri amici sono i nostri\" is acted upon quite literally.    Passing through the door of the caserma we entered a large oblong room;  at each end were three or four beds and on the side opposite the door two  open windows.  Through the windows across a barley-field, lightly stirred  by the breeze from the sea, the Temple of Apollo was lying in the heat,  an extinct heap of ruins, as though the naughty boy of some family of  Cyclopes had spilt his brother's box of bricks.  In the middle of the  room ten or twelve men were sitting round a table on which were dishes of  what at first I took to be some kind of frutta di mare, objects about the  size and shape of sea-urchins.  The brigadier received me with great  courtesy and put me to sit next him, and the corporal sat on the other  side of me.  A dreamy Sunday afternoon feeling pervaded the air, the  brigadier said they were slaughtering time (\"bisogna ammazzare un po' di  tempo\").  Being to a certain extent soldiers, their business was to kill  something and they were compassing the destruction of their present enemy  by drinking wine and eating not sea-urchins but cold boiled artichokes.  He gave me some and begged me to make myself at home.  The corporal  clinked glasses with me and said that the wine was better than that at  the locanda, wherein I agreed with him, but I did not tell him I found  the artichokes a little uninteresting.  They were so very small and there  was so much to do to get what little there was of them that they were  more trouble than shrimps or walnuts.  Looked at from the brigadier's  point of view, as a means of passing the time on Sunday, they reminded me  of the Litany; pulling off each leaf was like listening to each short  clause and eating the unimportant little bit at the end was like intoning  the little response; then the larger piece that was left, when all the  leaves were off, followed like the coda and finale of the Litany after  the more monotonous part has been disposed of.  The Litany has, however,  the advantage that it comes only one at a time, we do not kneel down to a  whole plateful of it; on the other hand, there was wine with the  artichokes and they were free from any trace of morbid introspection.    The brigadier and Angelo were in earnest conversation about something,  and, as my mind began to wander from the artichokes (here again they  resembled the Litany) and was able to attend more to what was going on, I  became aware that they were talking about the lottery.  Selinunte depends  for news upon chance visitors and Angelo had brought the winning numbers  which he had got from a cousin of his in one of the lottery offices at  Castelvetrano.  The brigadier had lost and in giving his instructions for  the next week's drawing seemed to experience great difficulty in making  up his mind.    Presently there looked in at one of the windows a hunchback riding on a  mule and carrying a guitar.  Several of the guards went to help him in,  greeting him with shouts of--    \"Addio, Filippo!\"    He lifted one of his legs over the saddle, and then I saw that not only  was he a hunchback but that his legs were withered.  He reached up and  hung on to the ledge over the window with both hands and swung himself  very cleverly and with no assistance into a sitting position on the  window-sill; two of the guards then picked him up, carried him into the  room, set him on a chair and gave him some wine and artichokes.  Being a  jolly fellow, as cripples often are, he soon tired of the artichokes,  asked for his guitar and began to sing Neapolitan songs.  He had not sung  more than two before the brigadier told me I should like to wash my hands  and had better come into his bedroom.  I glanced at Angelo who nodded  back and the brigadier took me off with him.  He began by showing me his  room which was very clean and tidy.  His bed was at one end, his table,  with his official papers and books, in the middle and against the wall  hung his guns which he showed me particularly, declaring that he was  passionately devoted to the chase.  After he had done the honours I  washed my hands and so did he; then he led the conversation to what his  manner betrayed was the real business of the interview.  He asked me my  name and age, whether I was married or single and particulars of my  family, whether I was an Englishman from London or from New York and how  much a metre I had paid for the stuff my clothes were made of.  This last  was the only question that gave me any real trouble, but I made a hasty  calculation, converted the result into francs, deducted five per cent.  for cash and hazarded--    \"Fourteen lire.\"    In return for his polite interest in my affairs I pretended a similar  interest in his, and it turned out that we had a friend in common--a  maresciallo dei carabinieri whom I had met on Monte San Giuliano and of  whom I was able to give the latest information namely, that he had  retired, gone home to Cremona and married.  Carabinieri are not allowed  to marry so long as they are in service, or rather they may marry but  only on condition of depositing a sum of money which is fixed at an  amount beyond anything they are likely to be able to lay their hands on.    Having exhausted our questions and answers we returned to the guard-room  and the corporal welcomed us by filling our glasses again.  The  brigadier, before sitting down, took Angelo aside and became again  immersed in conversation; this time he appeared to be getting on more  satisfactorily with his instructions.  The artichokes were beginning to  lose their attractions for every one, so I took out a packet of  cigarettes and offered them round.  In those days there used to be in  every packet of Italian cigarettes a loose piece of paper about the size  of a postage stamp with a number on it.  Boxes of biscuits in England  sometimes have a similar paper to identify the person responsible for the  packing should anything be found to be wrong.  In my packet there  happened to be two pieces of paper which fluttered out upon the table as  I opened it.  The brigadier instantly pounced upon them.  There was  silence in the room.  Every one watched and waited.  Each of my pieces of  paper bore the number thirty-three.  The brigadier did me the honour of  cancelling all his previous orders to Angelo and of putting his money for  next week's lottery on thirty-three.  The corporal and several of the men  who had not intended to gamble changed their minds and gave similar  instructions.    It was now time to think of returning, so Angelo got out of the window  into the sunlight and went off to fetch the carriage and the guards began  to chaff poor Cicciu about his watch-chain which was a massive and  extensive affair in silver.  The corporal said they were playing a game  with him and offered to teach it to me.  I am not good at games, but this "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/24654"],[0,"Chaldea: From the Earliest Times to the Rise of Assyria (#2)"],[1,".
