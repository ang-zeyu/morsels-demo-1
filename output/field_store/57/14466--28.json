[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/30889"],[0,"The Mechanism of the Human Voice (#2)"],[1,"voices were  so plentiful that even in comparatively small towns there were to be  found Opera Companies consisting of excellent singers, we may well ask  ourselves how this remarkable change for the worse has come about.  People have attempted to account for it in various ways. Up to the  middle of the last century women were forbidden by Ecclesiastical Law to  take part in Church music. The voices of boys being available only for a  very short time, means were taken to prevent their voices from breaking,  and thus a class of male soprani and contralti was created, who made  their first appearance in Rome in the beginning of the 17th century, and  to these singers the education of the female voices was soon almost  exclusively entrusted. In the middle of the last century, however, when  women were permitted to participate in Church music, there was no longer  any occasion to procure artificial female voices, and these singers  gradually died out, though there were still some of them living and  teaching in the beginning of the present century. According to Rossini,  who certainly was eminently qualified to give an opinion on the subject,  the decline of vocal art in these latter years is mainly due to the  disappearance of this class of singers, and if it be true that  henceforth the training of female voices was undertaken by tenors, who,  being of course unable to give a true pattern to their pupils, treated  the female organ according to their own very different registers, then  it can easily be understood that many voices must have been ruined by  the process, and the scarcity of distinguished female singers would thus  be satisfactorily accounted for. But I fail to see in what way the  disappearance of male soprani and contralti could possibly have affected  tenors and basses.    Again, it is asserted that the way in which modern composers write vocal  music is the cause of the evil. Certain it is that in the compositions  of the old Italian masters the voice is studied, and nothing introduced  which is hurtful or disadvantageous. Awkward intervals are avoided, no  fatigue is caused, and everything is eminently _singable_; but the music  is not always expressive of the sense of the words, which were clearly  considered to be of minor importance. With our modern (and especially  with the German) composers, it is just the opposite, their chief aim  being thoroughly to enter, not only into the spirit of their text, but  even into the slightest shade, the minutest detail of it, so as to make  the music, as it were, a translation of their words into a higher kind  of language. What, on the other hand, is possible or impossible for the  voice is, since the time of Beethoven, but rarely considered; many  composers, even the most distinguished ones, having evidently little  knowledge of the most beautiful of instruments, for which they are  nevertheless continually writing.    When one of the greatest living masters introduced the harp into his  works, he wrote for it just as though it were a piano--_i.e._, as though  it were to be played upon with the thumb and four fingers. But it so  happens that on that instrument the fourth finger is never used.  Consequently, when it came to the point harpists could not play that  gentleman's compositions: they had first to re-write them. Here the  composer, of course, was found out immediately, and he or any other man  would have the same fate if he attempted to write for an instrument the  properties of which he did not fully understand. But with the human  voice the case is different. Every musician believes himself to be  competent to write for it, though he may possibly be wholly unacquainted  with its many peculiarities. It is to be feared, therefore, that modern  composers must be held largely responsible for the sad state of affairs  concerning vocal art at the present time, and well might they learn a  lesson from Mozart, who, in spite of his genius, first carefully studied  the human voice, and then wrote for it.    Another explanation of the decline of singing is this, that the gradual  and very considerable rise of pitch during the last 150 years is at the  bottom of all the mischief, as the vocal organ is unable to bear the  strain to which it is subjected. With regard to tenors, however, the  great evil is, that with very few exceptions, such as the celebrated  Frenchman, Roger, they disregard, or at any rate did disregard for a  considerable period, the falsetto register, singing everything, however  high, in chest voice. I am afraid it cannot be said even that they have  been beguiled into this serious mistake by the imperceptible rise of  pitch just mentioned, but the truth is that they have committed this  fatal blunder knowingly and wilfully, because they saw that it would  pay. In support of this statement I will quote a few lines from the  publication called \"The Opera and the Art of Singing,\" by  Glogg-ner-Castelli:         \"In the field of singing a new man arose, who, in spite of great       personal attributes, worked destructively for the future, and whose       influence upon the later manner of singing is seldom truly       recognized. I mean the singer Duprez. Hissed off at first in Paris,       he turned to Italy, where he stayed several years, and then       returned to the French capital. When he came to use his magnificent       vocal resources, as he did in the Fourth Act of _Tell_, where he       brought out the high C in the chest voice with all the might of his       colossal organ, it was all over with the fame of all his       predecessors. Nourrit, till then the favourite of the Parisians, a       distinguished tenor singer, recognized the rival's power. His day       was over, and in despair over his lost and irrecoverable glory, he       flung himself from an upper window upon the pavement, and so made       an end of his life. Duprez may justly be considered one of the       greatest dramatic singers of our time, and the main features of his       method soon spread themselves all over Europe. After hearing of       Duprez, and how the chest register could be cultivated even into       the highest regions of the voice, the public were no longer       contented with the use of the falsetto. Soon it became impossible       to be engaged as an \"heroic tenor\" without at least possessing the       high B[b] in the chest tone. The singers found it a more thankful       task to humour the taste of the public than to pay extra regard to       the intentions of the composer; for often Meyerbeer himself       indicates, by a _pp_, his design that the falsetto and not the       chest tone should be employed. That every tenor singer, whether       such high pressure suited his natural compass or not, strove to       screw his voice up and 'make effect' was very natural; for art goes       after bread, and a high C with the chest voice often realizes an       income of thousands to its fortunate possessor. Roger has made a       laudable exception; his beautiful use of the falsetto certainly       produces a more agreeable effect than the forced chest tones so       unnatural to the organ of many a singer. How widespread is this       mistaken notion, that the use of the falsetto is entirely contrary       to art, we hear frequently enough in the expressions of individuals       when some unlucky tenor happens to get caught on one of these       tabooed falsetto tones. Thus the school founded by Duprez,       important in itself, has called into life a manner of singing, the       ruinous consequences of which we can see daily.\"    But whatever may be the true reason or reasons, the fact that we have  very few singers of eminence as compared with former ages, and that  vocal art in general has gone down, is undisputed, and men have set  themselves to remedy the evil by trying to ascertain the actual process  by which the voice is produced, thinking that if they could but find  this out there would be a true scientific basis upon which to found a  way of teaching singing--or as I should rather say, of training  voices--which would be sure and unerring.           *       *       *       *       *    The experiments of the great physiologist Johannes Mueller are well  known, and they have been followed up by others. But they were made upon  dissected larynges, and as various teachers of singing started the most  conflicting theories as to how the process shown by Mueller was carried  on in the living subject, and treated the voices of their pupils  accordingly, these investigations have perhaps on the whole done more  harm than good. Science was made responsible for the blunders of those  who attempted to be guided by it. And thus it has happened that when at  a later period further trials were made, but this time upon the living  subject, and in the act of singing, they were received with indifference  and distrust. Only very lately teachers of vocal music have begun to  find out that here are facts put before them which cannot be gainsaid,  and that if these investigations do nothing else, they at any rate make  them acquainted with the exact nature of the vocal organ, and what it  will bear and what it will not bear.          THE VOCAL ORGAN AS A MUSICAL INSTRUMENT.      \"Physiologists,\" says Dr. Witkowski,[A] \"are quite at issue when they  endeavour to determine what kind of instrument the vocal organ  resembles; indeed, Galien compares it to a flute, Magendie to a hautboy,  Despiney to a trombone, Diday to a hunting-horn, Savart to a  bird-catcher's call, Biot to an organ-pipe, Malgaigne to the little  instrument used by the exhibitors of Punch, and Ferrein to a spinet or  harpsichord. The last-named compared the lips of the glottis to the  strings of a violin; hence was given the name _Vocal Cords_, which they  have since retained. The current of air was the bow, the exertion of the  chest and lungs the hand which carried the bow,"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/3095"],[0,"The Lady of the Shroud (#2)"],[1,"gave them,  for he had next to nothing himself, and she was \"bare\"--which is, I  understand, the indelicate Scottish way of expressing lack of fortune.  She was, however, I understand, of an old and somewhat good family,  though broken in fortune--to use an expression which, however, could  hardly be used precisely in regard to a family or a person who never had  fortune to be broken in!  It was so far well that the MacKelpies--that  was the maiden name of Mrs. St. Leger--were reputable--so far as fighting  was concerned.  It would have been too humiliating to have allied to our  family, even on the distaff side, a family both poor and of no account.  Fighting alone does not make a family, I think.  Soldiers are not  everything, though they think they are.  We have had in our family men  who fought; but I never heard of any of them who fought because they  _wanted_ to.  Mrs. St. Leger had a sister; fortunately there were only  those two children in the family, or else they would all have had to be  supported by the money of my family.    Mr. St. Leger, who was only a subaltern, was killed at Maiwand; and his  wife was left a beggar.  Fortunately, however, she died--her sister  spread a story that it was from the shock and grief--before the child  which she expected was born.  This all happened when my cousin--or,  rather, my father's cousin, my first-cousin-once-removed, to be  accurate--was still a very small child.  His mother then sent for Miss  MacKelpie, her brother-in-law's sister-in-law, to come and live with her,  which she did--beggars can't be choosers; and she helped to bring up  young St. Leger.    I remember once my father giving me a sovereign for making a witty remark  about her.  I was quite a boy then, not more than thirteen; but our  family were always clever from the very beginning of life, and father was  telling me about the St. Leger family.  My family hadn't, of course, seen  anything of them since Captain St. Leger died--the circle to which we  belong don't care for poor relations--and was explaining where Miss  MacKelpie came in.  She must have been a sort of nursery governess, for  Mrs. St. Leger once told him that she helped her to educate the child.    \"Then, father,\" I said, \"if she helped to educate the child she ought to  have been called Miss MacSkelpie!\"    When my first-cousin-once-removed, Rupert, was twelve years old, his  mother died, and he was in the dolefuls about it for more than a year.  Miss MacKelpie kept on living with him all the same.  Catch her quitting!  That sort don't go into the poor-house when they can keep out!  My  father, being Head of the Family, was, of course, one of the trustees,  and his uncle Roger, brother of the testator, another.  The third was  General MacKelpie, a poverty-stricken Scotch laird who had a lot of  valueless land at Croom, in Ross-shire.  I remember father gave me a new  ten-pound note when I interrupted him whilst he was telling me of the  incident of young St. Leger's improvidence by remarking that he was in  error as to the land.  From what I had heard of MacKelpie's estate, it  was productive of one thing; when he asked me \"What?\" I answered  \"Mortgages!\"  Father, I knew, had bought, not long before, a lot of them  at what a college friend of mine from Chicago used to call \"cut-throat\"  price.  When I remonstrated with my father for buying them at all, and so  injuring the family estate which I was to inherit, he gave me an answer,  the astuteness of which I have never forgotten.    \"I did it so that I might keep my hand on the bold General, in case he  should ever prove troublesome.  And if the worst should ever come to the  worst, Croom is a good country for grouse and stags!\"  My father can see  as far as most men!    When my cousin--I shall call him cousin henceforth in this record, lest  it might seem to any unkind person who might hereafter read it that I  wished to taunt Rupert St. Leger with his somewhat obscure position, in  reiterating his real distance in kinship with my family--when my cousin,  Rupert St. Leger, wished to commit a certain idiotic act of financial  folly, he approached my father on the subject, arriving at our estate,  Humcroft, at an inconvenient time, without permission, not having had  even the decent courtesy to say he was coming.  I was then a little chap  of six years old, but I could not help noticing his mean appearance.  He  was all dusty and dishevelled.  When my father saw him--I came into the  study with him--he said in a horrified voice:    \"Good God!\"  He was further shocked when the boy brusquely acknowledged,  in reply to my father's greeting, that he had travelled third class.  Of  course, none of my family ever go anything but first class; even the  servants go second.  My father was really angry when he said he had  walked up from the station.    \"A nice spectacle for my tenants and my tradesmen!  To see my--my--a  kinsman of my house, howsoever remote, trudging like a tramp on the road  to my estate!  Why, my avenue is two miles and a perch!  No wonder you  are filthy and insolent!\"  Rupert--really, I cannot call him cousin  here--was exceedingly impertinent to my father.    \"I walked, sir, because I had no money; but I assure you I did not mean  to be insolent.  I simply came here because I wished to ask your advice  and assistance, not because you are an important person, and have a long  avenue--as I know to my cost--but simply because you are one of my  trustees.\"    \"_Your_ trustees, sirrah!\" said my father, interrupting him.  \"Your  trustees?\"    \"I beg your pardon, sir,\" he said, quite quietly.  \"I meant the trustees  of my dear mother's will.\"    \"And what, may I ask you,\" said father, \"do you want in the way of advice  from one of the trustees of your dear mother's will?\"  Rupert got very  red, and was going to say something rude--I knew it from his look--but he  stopped, and said in the same gentle way:    \"I want your advice, sir, as to the best way of doing something which I  wish to do, and, as I am under age, cannot do myself.  It must be done  through the trustees of my mother's will.\"    \"And the assistance for which you wish?\" said father, putting his hand in  his pocket.  I know what that action means when I am talking to him.    \"The assistance I want,\" said Rupert, getting redder than ever, \"is from  my--the trustee also.  To carry out what I want to do.\"    \"And what may that be?\" asked my father.  \"I would like, sir, to make  over to my Aunt Janet--\"  My father interrupted him by asking--he had  evidently remembered my jest:    \"Miss MacSkelpie?\"  Rupert got still redder, and I turned away; I didn't  quite wish that he should see me laughing.  He went on quietly:    \"_MacKelpie_, sir!  Miss Janet MacKelpie, my aunt, who has always been so  kind to me, and whom my mother loved--I want to have made over to her the  money which my dear mother left to me.\"  Father doubtless wished to have  the matter take a less serious turn, for Rupert's eyes were all shiny  with tears which had not fallen; so after a little pause he said, with  indignation, which I knew was simulated:    \"Have you forgotten your mother so soon, Rupert, that you wish to give  away the very last gift which she bestowed on you?\"  Rupert was sitting,  but he jumped up and stood opposite my father with his fist clenched.  He  was quite pale now, and his eyes looked so fierce that I thought he would  do my father an injury.  He spoke in a voice which did not seem like his  own, it was so strong and deep.    \"Sir!\" he roared out.  I suppose, if I was a writer, which, thank God, I  am not--I have no need to follow a menial occupation--I would call it  \"thundered.\"  \"Thundered\" is a longer word than \"roared,\" and would, of  course, help to gain the penny which a writer gets for a line.  Father  got pale too, and stood quite still.  Rupert looked at him steadily for  quite half a minute--it seemed longer at the time--and suddenly smiled  and said, as he sat down again:    \"Sorry.  But, of course, you don't understand such things.\"  Then he went  on talking before father had time to say a word.    \"Let us get back to business.  As you do not seem to follow me, let me  explain that it is _because_ I do not forget that I wish to do this.  I  remember my dear mother's wish to make Aunt Janet happy, and would like  to do as she did.\"    \"_Aunt_ Janet?\" said father, very properly sneering at his ignorance.  \"She is not your aunt.  Why, even her sister, who was married to your  uncle, was only your aunt by courtesy.\"  I could not help feeling that  Rupert meant to be rude to my father, though his words were quite polite.  If I had been as much bigger than him as he was than me, I should have  flown at him; but he was a very big boy for his age.  I am myself rather  thin.  Mother says thinness is an \"appanage of birth.\"    \"My Aunt Janet, sir, is an aunt by love.  Courtesy is a small word to use  in connection with such devotion as she has given to us.  But I needn't  trouble you with such things, sir.  I take it that my relations on the  side of my own house do not affect you.  I am a Sent Leger!\"  Father  looked quite taken aback.  He sat quite still before he spoke.    \"Well, Mr. St. Leger, I shall think over the matter for a while, and  shall presently let you know my decision.  In the meantime, would you  like something to eat?  I take it that as you must have started very  early, you have not had any breakfast?\"  Rupert smiled quite genially:    \"That is true, sir.  I haven't broken bread since dinner last night, and  I am ravenously hungry.\"  Father rang the bell, and told the footman who  answered it to send the housekeeper.  When she came, father said to her:    \"Mrs. Martindale, take this boy to your room and give him some  breakfast.\"  Rupert stood very still for some seconds.  His face had got  red again after his paleness.  Then he bowed to my father, and followed  Mrs. Martindale, who had"]]]
