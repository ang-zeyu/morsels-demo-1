Young wives, the mistresses of roomy houses in the western quarters of  town, shudder as they imagine the discomforts which these young wives of  other days must have endured. \"What! live in chambers?\" they exclaim  with astonishment and horror, recalling the smallness and cheerless  aspect of their husbands' business chambers. But past usages must not be  hastily condemned,--allowance must be made for the fact that our  ancestors set no very high price on the luxuries of elbow-room and  breathing-room. Families in opulent circumstances were wont to dwell  happily, and receive whole regiments of jovial visitors in little houses  nigh the Strand and Fleet Street, Ludgate Hill and Cheapside;--houses  hidden in narrow passages and sombre courts--houses, compared with  which the lowliest residences in a \"genteel suburb\" of our own time  would appear capacious mansions. Moreover, it must be borne in mind that  the married barrister, living a century since with his wife in  chambers--either within or hard-by an Inn or Court--was, at a  comparatively low rent, the occupant of far more ample quarters than  those for which a working barrister now-a-days pays a preposterous sum.  Such a man was tenant of a 'set of rooms' (several rooms, although  called 'a chamber') which, under the present system, accommodates a  small colony of industrious 'juniors' with one office and a clerk's room  attached. Married ladies, who have lived in Paris or Vienna, in the 'old  town' of Edinburgh, or Victoria Street, Westminster, need no assurance  that life 'on a flat' is not an altogether deplorable state of  existence. The young couple in chambers had six rooms at their  disposal,--a chamber for business, a parlor, not unfrequently a  drawing-room, and a trim, compact little kitchen. Sometimes they had two  'sets of rooms,' one above another; in which case the young wife could  have her bridesmaids to stay with her, or could offer a bed to a friend  from the country. Occasionally during the last fifty years of the last  century, they were so fortunate as to get possession of a small detached  house, originally built by a nervous bencher, who disliked the sound of  footsteps on the stairs outside his door. Time was when the Inns  comprised numerous detached houses, some of them snug dwellings, and  others imposing mansions, wherein great dignitaries lived with proper  ostentation. Most of them have bean pulled down, and their sites covered  with collegiate 'buildings;' but a few of them still remain, the grand  piles having long since been partitioned off into chambers, and the  little houses striking the eye as quaint, misplaced, insignificant  blocks of human habitation. Under the trees of Gray's Inn gardens may  be seen two modest tenements, each of them comprising some six or eight  rooms and a vestibule. At the present time they are occupied as offices  by legal practitioners, and many a day has passed since womanly taste  decorated their windows with flowers and muslin curtains; but a certain  venerable gentleman, to whom the writer of this page is indebted for  much information about the lawyers of the last century, can remember  when each of those cottages was inhabited by a barrister, his young  wife, and three or four lovely children. Into some such a house near  Lincoln's Inn, a young lawyer who was destined to hold the seals for  many years, and be also the father of a Lord Chancellor, married in the  year of our Lord, 1718. His name was Philip Yorke: and though he was of  humble birth, he had made such a figure in his profession that great  men's doors, were open to him. He was asked to dinner by learned judges,  and invited to balls by their ladies. In Chancery Lane, at the house of  Sir Joseph Jekyll, Master of the Rolls, he met Mrs. Lygon, a beauteous  and wealthy widow, whose father was a country squire, and whose mother  was the sister of the great Lord Somers. In fact, she was a lady of such  birth, position, and jointure, that the young lawyer--rising man though  he was--seemed a poor match for her. The lady's family thought so; and  if Sir Joseph Jekyll had not cordially supported the suitor with a  letter of recommendation, her father would have rejected him as a man  too humble in rank and fortune. Having won the lady and married her, Mr.  Philip Yorke brought her home to a 'very small house' near Lincoln's  Inn; and in that lowly dwelling, the ground-floor of which was the  barrister's office, they spent the first years of their wedded life.  What would be said of the rising barrister who, now-a-days, on his  marriage with a rich squire's rich daughter and a peer's niece, should  propose to set up his household gods in a tiny crip just outside  Lincoln's Inn gate, and to use the parlor of the 'very small house' for  professional purposes? Far from being guilty of unseemly parsimony in  this arrangement, Philip Yorke paid proper consideration to his wife's  social advantages, in taking her to a separate house. His contemporaries  amongst the junior bar would have felt no astonishment if he had fitted  up a set of chambers for his wealthy and well-descended bride. Not  merely in his day, but for long years afterward, lawyers of gentle birth  and comfortable means, who married women scarcely if at all inferior to  Mrs. Yorke in social condition, lived upon the flats of Lincoln's Inn  and the Temple.          CHAPTER II.    THE LAST OF THE LADIES.      Whatever its drawbacks, the system which encouraged the young barrister  to marry on a modest income, and make his wife 'happy in chambers,' must  have had special advantages. In their Inn the husband was near every  source of diversion for which he greatly cared, and the wife was  surrounded by the friends of either sex in whose society she took most  pleasure--friends who, like herself, 'lived in the Inn,' or in one of  the immediately adjacent streets. In 'hall' he dined and drank wine with  his professional compeers and the wits of the bar: the 'library'  supplied him not only with law books, but with poems and dramas, with  merry trifles written for the stage, and satires fresh from the Row;  'the chapel'--or if he were a Templer, 'the church'--was his habitual  place of worship, where there were sittings for his wife and children  as well as for himself; on the walks and under the shady trees of 'the  garden' he sauntered with his own, or, better still, a friend's wife,  criticising the passers, describing the new comedy, or talking over the  last ball given by a judge's lady. At times those gardens were pervaded  by the calm of collegiate seclusion, but on 'open days' they were brisk  with life. The women and children of the legal colony walked in them  daily; the ladies attired in their newest fashions, and the children  running with musical riot over lawns and paths. Nor were the grounds  mere places of resort for lawyers and their families. Taking rank  amongst the pleasant places of the metropolis, they attracted, on 'open  days,' crowds from every quarter of the town--ladies and gallants from  Soho Square and St. James's Street, from Whitehall and Westminster;  sightseers from the country and gorgeous alderwomic dowagers from  Cheapside. From the days of Elizabeth till the middle, indeed till the  close, of the eighteenth century the ornamental grounds of the four  great Inns were places of fashionable promenade, where the rank and  talent and beauty of the town assembled for display and exercise, even  as in our own time they assemble (less universally) in Hyde Park and  Kensington Gardens.    When ladies and children had withdrawn, the quietude of the gardens  lured from their chambers scholars and poets, who under murmuring  branches pondered the results of past study, or planned new works. Ben  Jonson was accustomed to saunter beneath the elms of Lincoln's Inn; and  Steele--alike on 'open' and 'close' days--used to frequent the gardens  of the same society. \"I went,\" he writes in May, 1809, \"into Lincoln's  Inn Walks, and having taking a round or two, I sat down, according to  the allowed familiarity of these places, on a bench.\" In the following  November he alludes to the privilege that he enjoyed of walking there  as \"a favor that is indulged me by several of the benchers, who are very  intimate friends, and grown in the neighborhood.\"    But though on certain days, and under fixed regulations, the outside  public were admitted to the college gardens, the assemblages were always  pervaded by the tone and humor of the law. The courtiers and grand  ladies from 'the west' felt themselves the guests of the lawyers; and  the humbler folk, who by special grant had acquired the privilege of  entry, or whose decent attire and aspect satisfied the janitors of their  respectability, moved about with watchfulness and gravity, surveying the  counsellors and their ladies with admiring eyes, and extolling the  benchers whose benevolence permitted simple tradespeople to take the air  side by side with 'the quality.' In 1736, James Ralph, in his 'New  Critical Review of the Publick Buildings,' wrote about the square and  gardens of Lincoln's Inn in a manner which testifies to the respectful  gratitude of the public for the liberality which permitted all outwardly  decent persons to walk in the grounds. \"I may safely add,\" he says,  \"that no area anywhere is kept in better order, either for cleanliness  and beauty by day, or illumination by night; the fountain in the middle  is a very pretty decoration, and if it was still kept playing, as it was  some years ago, 'twould preserve its name with more propriety.\" In his  remarks on the chapel the guide observes, \"The raising this chapel on  pillars affords a pleasing, melancholy walk underneath, and by night,  particularly, when illuminated by the lamps, it has an effect that may  be felt, but not described.\" Of the gardens Mr. Ralph"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/2781"],[0,"Just So Stories (#2)"],[1,"'Humph!' again; but no sooner had he said it than he  saw his back, that he was so proud of, puffing up and puffing up into a  great big lolloping humph.    'Do you see that?' said the Djinn. 'That's your very own humph that  you've brought upon your very own self by not working. To-day is  Thursday, and you've done no work since Monday, when the work began. Now  you are going to work.'    'How can I,' said the Camel, 'with this humph on my back?'    'That's made a-purpose,' said the Djinn, 'all because you missed those  three days. You will be able to work now for three days without eating,  because you can live on your humph; and don't you ever say I never  did anything for you. Come out of the Desert and go to the Three, and  behave. Humph yourself!'    And the Camel humphed himself, humph and all, and went away to join the  Three. And from that day to this the Camel always wears a humph (we call  it 'hump' now, not to hurt his feelings); but he has never yet caught up  with the three days that he missed at the beginning of the world, and he  has never yet learned how to behave.           THE Camel's hump is an ugly lump         Which well you may see at the Zoo;       But uglier yet is the hump we get         From having too little to do.         Kiddies and grown-ups too-oo-oo,       If we haven't enough to do-oo-oo,           We get the hump--           Cameelious hump--       The hump that is black and blue!         We climb out of bed with a frouzly head         And a snarly-yarly voice.       We shiver and scowl and we grunt and we growl         At our bath and our boots and our toys;         And there ought to be a corner for me       (And I know there is one for you)           When we get the hump--           Cameelious hump--       The hump that is black and blue!         The cure for this ill is not to sit still,         Or frowst with a book by the fire;       But to take a large hoe and a shovel also,         And dig till you gently perspire;         And then you will find that the sun and the wind.       And the Djinn of the Garden too,           Have lifted the hump--           The horrible hump--       The hump that is black and blue!         I get it as well as you-oo-oo--       If I haven't enough to do-oo-oo--           We all get hump--           Cameelious hump--       Kiddies and grown-ups too!          HOW THE RHINOCEROS GOT HIS SKIN    ONCE upon a time, on an uninhabited island on the shores of the Red Sea,  there lived a Parsee from whose hat the rays of the sun were reflected  in more-than-oriental splendour. And the Parsee lived by the Red Sea  with nothing but his hat and his knife and a cooking-stove of the kind  that you must particularly never touch. And one day he took flour and  water and currants and plums and sugar and things, and made himself one  cake which was two feet across and three feet thick. It was indeed a  Superior Comestible (that's magic), and he put it on stove because he  was allowed to cook on the stove, and he baked it and he baked it till  it was all done brown and smelt most sentimental. But just as he  was going to eat it there came down to the beach from the Altogether  Uninhabited Interior one Rhinoceros with a horn on his nose, two piggy  eyes, and few manners. In those days the Rhinoceros's skin fitted him  quite tight. There were no wrinkles in it anywhere. He looked exactly  like a Noah's Ark Rhinoceros, but of course much bigger. All the same,  he had no manners then, and he has no manners now, and he never will  have any manners. He said, 'How!' and the Parsee left that cake and  climbed to the top of a palm tree with nothing on but his hat, from  which the rays of the sun were always reflected in more-than-oriental  splendour. And the Rhinoceros upset the oil-stove with his nose, and  the cake rolled on the sand, and he spiked that cake on the horn of his  nose, and he ate it, and he went away, waving his tail, to the desolate  and Exclusively Uninhabited Interior which abuts on the islands of  Mazanderan, Socotra, and Promontories of the Larger Equinox. Then the  Parsee came down from his palm-tree and put the stove on its legs and  recited the following Sloka, which, as you have not heard, I will now  proceed to relate:--      Them that takes cakes    Which the Parsee-man bakes    Makes dreadful mistakes.    And there was a great deal more in that than you would think.    Because, five weeks later, there was a heat wave in the Red Sea, and  everybody took off all the clothes they had. The Parsee took off his  hat; but the Rhinoceros took off his skin and carried it over his  shoulder as he came down to the beach to bathe. In those days it  buttoned underneath with three buttons and looked like a waterproof. He  said nothing whatever about the Parsee's cake, because he had eaten  it all; and he never had any manners, then, since, or henceforward.  He waddled straight into the water and blew bubbles through his nose,  leaving his skin on the beach.    Presently the Parsee came by and found the skin, and he smiled one smile  that ran all round his face two times. Then he danced three times round  the skin and rubbed his hands. Then he went to his camp and filled his  hat with cake-crumbs, for the Parsee never ate anything but cake, and  never swept out his camp. He took that skin, and he shook that skin, and  he scrubbed that skin, and he rubbed that skin just as full of old,  dry, stale, tickly cake-crumbs and some burned currants as ever it could  possibly hold. Then he climbed to the top of his palm-tree and waited  for the Rhinoceros to come out of the water and put it on.    And the Rhinoceros did. He buttoned it up with the three buttons, and  it tickled like cake crumbs in bed. Then he wanted to scratch, but that  made it worse; and then he lay down on the sands and rolled and rolled  and rolled, and every time he rolled the cake crumbs tickled him worse  and worse and worse. Then he ran to the palm-tree and rubbed and rubbed  and rubbed himself against it. He rubbed so much and so hard that he  rubbed his skin into a great fold over his shoulders, and another fold  underneath, where the buttons used to be (but he rubbed the buttons  off), and he rubbed some more folds over his legs. And it spoiled his  temper, but it didn't make the least difference to the cake-crumbs.  They were inside his skin and they tickled. So he went home, very angry  indeed and horribly scratchy; and from that day to this every rhinoceros  has great folds in his skin and a very bad temper, all on account of the  cake-crumbs inside.    But the Parsee came down from his palm-tree, wearing his hat, from which  the rays of the sun were reflected in more-than-oriental splendour,  packed up his cooking-stove, and went away in the direction of Orotavo,  Amygdala, the Upland Meadows of Anantarivo, and the Marshes of Sonaput.           THIS Uninhabited Island         Is off Cape Gardafui,       By the Beaches of Socotra         And the Pink Arabian Sea:       But it's hot--too hot from Suez         For the likes of you and me           Ever to go           In a P. and O.       And call on the Cake-Parsee!          HOW THE LEOPARD GOT HIS SPOTS    IN the days when everybody started fair, Best Beloved, the Leopard lived  in a place called the High Veldt. 'Member it wasn't the Low Veldt, or  the Bush Veldt, or the Sour Veldt, but the 'sclusively bare, hot, shiny  High Veldt, where there was sand and sandy-coloured rock and 'sclusively  tufts of sandy-yellowish grass. The Giraffe and the Zebra and the Eland  and the Koodoo and the Hartebeest lived there; and they were 'sclusively  sandy-yellow-brownish all over; but the Leopard, he was the 'sclusivest  sandiest-yellowish-brownest of them all--a greyish-yellowish  catty-shaped kind of beast, and he matched the 'sclusively  yellowish-greyish-brownish colour of the High Veldt to one hair. This  was very bad for the Giraffe and the Zebra and the rest of them; for  he would lie down by a 'sclusively yellowish-greyish-brownish stone or  clump of grass, and when the Giraffe or the Zebra or the Eland or the  Koodoo or the Bush-Buck or the Bonte-Buck came by he would surprise them  out of their jumpsome lives. He would indeed! And, also, there was an  Ethiopian with bows and arrows (a 'sclusively greyish-brownish-yellowish  man he was then), who lived on the High Veldt with the Leopard; and the  two used to hunt together--the Ethiopian with his bows and arrows, and  the Leopard 'sclusively with his teeth and claws--till the Giraffe and  the Eland and the Koodoo and the Quagga and all the rest of them didn't  know which way to jump, Best Beloved. They didn't indeed!    After a long time--things lived for ever so long in those days--they  learned to avoid anything that looked like a Leopard or an Ethiopian;  and bit by bit--the Giraffe began it, because his legs were the  longest--they went away from the High Veldt. They scuttled for days  and days and days till they came to a great forest, 'sclusively full of  trees and bushes and stripy, speckly, patchy-blatchy shadows, and there  they hid: and after another long time, what with standing half in the  shade and half out of it, and what with the slippery-slidy shadows of  the trees falling on them, the Giraffe grew blotchy, and the Zebra grew  stripy, and the Eland and the Koodoo grew darker, with little wavy grey  lines on their backs like bark on a tree trunk; and so, though you could  hear them and smell them, you could very seldom see them, and then only  when you knew precisely where to look. They had a beautiful time in the  'sclusively speckly-spickly shadows of the forest, while the Leopard and  the Ethiopian ran about over the 'sclusively greyish-yellowish-reddish  High Veldt outside, wondering where all their breakfasts and their  dinners and their teas had gone. At last they were so hungry that they  ate rats and beetles and rock-rabbits, the Leopard and the Ethiopian,"]]]
