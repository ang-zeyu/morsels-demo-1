Protons, because they have a +1 charge rather than the +2 charge of the  alpha particles, are repulsed less strongly by the positive charge on  the nucleus, and are therefore more useful as bombarding projectiles. In  1929, E. T. S. Walton and J. D. Cockcroft passed an electric discharge  through hydrogen gas, thereby removing electrons from the hydrogen atom;  this left a beam of protons (i. e., hydrogen ions), which was then  accelerated by high voltages. This Cockcroft-Walton voltage multiplier  accelerated the protons to fairly high energies (about 800,000 electron  volts), but the protons still had a plus charge and their energies were  still not high enough to overcome the repulsive forces (Coulombic  repulsion) of the heavier nuclei.    A later development, the Van de Graaff electrostatic generator, produced  a beam of hydrogen ions and other positively charged ions, and electrons  at even higher energies. An early model of the linear accelerator also  gave a beam of heavy positive ions at high energies. These were the next  two instruments devised in the search for efficient bombarding  projectiles. However, the impasse continued: neither instrument allowed  scientists to crack the nuclei of the heavier elements.    Ernest O. Lawrence's cyclotron, built in 1931, was the first device  capable of accelerating positive ions to the very high energies needed.  Its basic principle of operation is not difficult to understand. A  charged particle accelerated in a cyclotron is analogous to a ball being  whirled on a string fastened to the top of a pole. A negative electric  field attracts the positively charged particle (ball) towards it and  then switches off until the particle swings halfway around; the field  then becomes negative in front of the particle again, and again attracts  it. As the particle moves faster and faster it spirals outward in an  ever increasing circle, something like a tether ball unwinding from a  pole. The energies achieved would have seemed fantastic to earlier  scientists. The Bevatron, a modern offspring of the first cyclotron,  accelerates protons to 99.13% the speed of light, thereby giving them  6.2 billion electron volts (BeV).    Another instrument, the heavy-ion linear accelerator (Hilac),  accelerates ions as heavy as neon to about 15% the speed of light. It is  called a linear accelerator because it accelerates particles in a  straight line. Stanford University is currently (1963) in the process of  building a linear accelerator approximately two miles long which will  accelerate charged particles to 99.9% the speed of light.    But highly accelerated charged particles did not solve all of science's  questions about the inner workings of the nucleus.    In 1932, during the early search for more efficient ways to bombard  nuclei, James Chadwick discovered the neutron. This particle, which is  neutral in charge and is approximately the same mass as a proton, has  the remarkable quality of efficiently producing nuclear reactions even  at very low energies. No one exactly knowns why. At low energies,  protons, alpha particles, or other charged particles do not interact  with nuclei because they cannot penetrate the electrostatic energy  barriers. For example, slow positive particles pick up electrons, become  neutral, and lose their ability to cause nuclear transformations. Slow  neutrons, on the other hand, can enter nearly all atomic nuclei and  induce fission of certain of the heavier ones. It is, in fact, these  properties of the neutron which have made possible the utilization of  atomic energy.    With these tools, researchers were not long in accurately identifying  the missing elements 43, 61, 85, and 87 and more--indeed, the list of  new elements, isotopes, and particles now seems endless.    Element 43 was \"made\" for the first time as a result of bombarding  molybdenum with deuterons in the Berkeley cyclotron. The chemical work  of identifying the element was done by Emilio Segre and others then  working at Palermo, Sicily, and they chose to call it technetium,  because it was the element first made by artificial technical methods.    Element 61 was made for the first time from the fission disintegration  products of uranium in the Clinton (Oak Ridge) reactor. Marinsky and  Glendenin, who did the chemical work of identification, chose to call it  promethium because they wished to point out that just as Prometheus  stole fire (a great force for good or evil) from the hidden storehouse  of the gods and presented it to man, so their newly assembled reactor  delivered to mankind an even greater force, nuclear energy.    Element 85 is called astatine, from the Greek astatos, meaning  \"unstable,\" because astatine _is_ unstable (of course all other elements  having a nuclear charge number greater than 84 are unstable, too).  Astatine was first made at Berkeley by bombarding bismuth with alpha  particles, which produced astatine and released two neutrons. The  element has since been found in nature as a small constituent of the  natural decay of actinium.    The last of the original 92 elements to be discovered was element 87,  francium. It was identified in 1939 by French scientist Marguerite  Perey.    Children have a game in which they pile blocks up to see how high they  can go before they topple over. In medieval times, petty rulers in their  Italian states vied with one another to see who could build the tallest  tower. Some beautiful results of this game still remain in Florence,  Siena, and other Italian hill cities. Currently, Americans vie in a  similar way with the wheelbase and overall length of their cars. After  1934, the game among scientists took the form of seeing who could extend  the length of the periodic system of the elements; as with medieval  towers, it was Italy that again began with the most enthusiasm and  activity under the leadership of Enrico Fermi.    Merely adding neutrons would not be enough; that would make only a  heavier isotope of the already known heaviest elements, uranium.  However, if the incoming neutron caused some rearrangement within the  nucleus and if it were accompanied by expulsion of electrons, that  _would_ make a new element. Trials by Fermi and his co-workers with  various elements led to unmistakeable evidence of the expulsion of  electrons (beta activity) with at least four different rates of decay  (half-lives). Claims were advanced for the creation of elements 93 and  94 and possibly further (the transuranium elements, Table I). Much  difficulty was experienced, however, in proving that the activity really  was due to the formation of elements 93 and 94. As more people became  interested and extended the scope of the experiments, the picture became  more confused rather than clarified. Careful studies soon showed that  the activities did _not_ decay logarithmically--which means that they  were caused by mixtures, not individual pure substances--and the  original four activities reported by Fermi grew to at least nine.    As a matter of fact, the way out of the difficulty had been indicated  soon after Fermi's original announcement. Dr. Ida Noddack pointed out  that no one had searched among the products of Fermi's experiment for  elements _lighter_ than lead, but no one paid any attention to her  suggestion at the time. The matter was finally cleared up by Dr. Otto  Hahn and F. Strassmann. They were able to show that instead of uranium  having small pieces like helium nuclei, fast electrons, and super-hard  x-rays, knocked off as expected, the atom had split into two roughly  equal pieces, together with some excess neutrons. This process is called  nuclear fission. The two large pieces were unstable and decayed further  with the loss of electrons, hence the [beta] activity. This process is  so complicated that there are not, as originally reported, only four  half-lives, but at least 200 different varieties of at least 35  different elements. The discovery of fission attended by the release of  enormous amounts of energy led to feverish activity on the part of  physicists and chemists everywhere in the world. In June 1940, McMillan  and Abelson presented definite proof that element 93 had been found in  uranium penetrated by neutrons during deuteron bombardment in the  cyclotron at the University of California Radiation Laboratory.    The California scientists called the newly discovered element neptunium,  because it lies beyond the element uranium just as the planet Neptune  lies beyond Uranus. The particular isotope formed in those first  experiments was {93}Np<239>; this is read neptunium having a nuclear charge  of 93 and an atomic mass number of 239. It has a half-life of 2.3 days,  during which it gives up another electron ([beta] particle) and becomes  element 94, or plutonium (so called after Pluto, the next planet beyond  Neptune). This particular form of plutonium ({94}Pu<239>) has such a long  half-life (24,000 years) that it could not be detected. The first  isotope of element 94 to be discovered was Pu<238>, made by direct deuteron  bombardment in the Berkeley 60-inch cyclotron by Radiation Laboratory  scientists Seaborg, McMillan, Kennedy, and Wahl; it had an [alpha]-decay  half-life of 86.4 years, which gave it sufficient radioactivity so that  its chemistry could be studied.    Having found these chemical properties in Pu<238>, experimenters knew  {94}Pu<239> would behave similarly. It was soon shown that the nucleus of  {94}Pu<239> would undergo fission in the same way as {92}U<235> when  bombarded with slow neutrons and that it could be produced in the newly  assembled atomic pile. Researchers wished to learn as much as possible  about its chemistry; therefore, during the summer of 1942 two large  cyclotrons at St. Louis and Berkeley bombarded hundreds of pounds of  uranium almost continuously.

Besides, what could he do when everyone insisted on pressing food on  him? \"Try this, Professor Gzann.\" \"Do try that, Professor Gzann.\"  (\"Doesn't he look cunning in his little dress suit?\") They crowded  around him. The women cooed, the men beamed, and Narli ate. He would be  glad when he could detach himself from all this cloying diplomacy and  get back to the healthy rancor of the classroom.           *       *       *       *       *    At school, the odor of chalk dust, ink and rotting apple cores was  enough like its Saturnian equivalent to make Narli feel at home  immediately. The students would dislike him on sight, he knew. It is in  the nature of the young to be hostile toward whatever is strange and  alien. They would despise him and jeer at him, and he, in his turn,  would give them long, involved homework assignments and such difficult  examinations that they would fail....    Narli waddled briskly up to his desk which had, he saw, been scaled down  to Saturnian size, whereas he had envisioned himself struggling  triumphantly with ordinary Earth-sized, furniture. But the atmosphere  was as hot and sticky and intolerable as he had expected. Panting as  unobtrusively as possible, he rapped with his pointer. \"Attention,  students!\"    Now should come the derisive babble ... but there was a respectful  silence, broken suddenly by a shrill feminine whisper of, \"Oooo, he's so  adorable!\" followed by the harsh, \"Shhh, Ava! You'll embarrass the poor  little thing.\"    Narli's face swelled. \"I am your new professor of Saturnian Studies.  Saturn, as you probably know, is a major planet. It is much larger and  more important than Earth, which is only a minor planet.\"    The students obediently took this down in their notebooks. They  carefully took down everything he said. Even a bout of coughing that  afflicted him half-way through seemed to be getting a phonetic  transcription. From time to time, they would interrupt his lecture with  questions so pertinent, so well-thought out and so courteous that all he  could do was answer them.    His antennae lifted to catch the whispers that from time to time were  exchanged between even the best-behaved of the students. \"Isn't he  precious?\" \"Seems like a nice fellow--sound grasp of his subject.\"  \"Sweet little thing!\" \"Unusually interesting presentation.\" \"Doesn't he  remind you of Winnie the Pooh?\" \"Able chap.\" \"Just darling!\"    After class, instead of rushing out of the room, they hovered around his  desk with intelligent, solicitous questions. Did he like Earth? Was his  desk too high? Too low? Didn't he find it hot with all that fur? Such  lovely, soft, fluffy fur, though. \"Do you mind if I stroke one of your  paws--_hands_--Professor?\" (\"So cuddly-looking!\")    He said yes, as a matter of fact, he was hot, and no, he didn't mind  being touched in a spirit of scientific investigation.    He had a moment of uplift at the teachers' cafeteria when he discovered  lunch to be virtually inedible. The manager, however, had been  distressed to see him pick at his food, and by dinner-time a  distinguished chef with an expert knowledge of Saturnian cuisine had  been rushed from Washington. Since the school food was inedible for all  intelligent life-forms, everyone ate the Saturnian dishes and praised  Narli as a public benefactor.           *       *       *       *       *    That night, alone in the quiet confines of his small room at the Men's  Faculty Club, Narli had spread out his notes and was about to start work  on his history when there was a knock at the door. He trotted over to  open it, grumbling to himself.    The head of his department smiled brightly down at him. \"Some of us are  going out for a couple of drinks and a gabfest. Care to come along?\"    Narli did not see how he could refuse and still carry the Saturnian's  burden, so he accepted. Discovering that gin fizzes and Alexanders were  even more palatable than champagne and more potent than vilbar, he told  several Saturnine locker-room stories which were hailed with loud  merriment. But he was being laughed _at_, not _with_, he knew. All this  false cordiality, he assured himself, would die down after a couple of  days, and then he would be able to get back to work. He must curb his  intellectual impatience.    In the morning, he found that enrollment in his classes had doubled, and  the room was crowded to capacity with the bright, shining, eager faces  of young Terrestrials athirst for learning. There were apples,  chocolates and imported frismil nuts on his desk, as well as a pressing  invitation from Mrs. Purrington for him to spend all his weekends and  holidays at the White House. The window was fitted with an  air-conditioning unit which, he later discovered, his classes had  chipped in to buy for him, and the temperature had been lowered to a  point where it was almost comfortable. All the students wore coats.    When he went out on the campus, women--students, teachers, even  strangers--stopped to talk to him, to exclaim over him, to touch him,  even to kiss him. Photographers were perpetually taking pictures, some  of which turned up in the Student Union as full-color postcards. They  sold like Lajl out of season.    Narli wrote in Saturnian on the back of one: \"Having miserable time; be  glad you're not here,\" and sent it to Slood.    There were cocktail parties, musicales and balls in Narli's honor. When  he tried to refuse an invitation, he was accused of shyness and  virtually dragged to the affair by laughing members of the faculty. He  put on so much weight that he had to buy a complete new Terrestrial  outfit, which set him back a pretty penny. As a result, he had to  augment his income by lecturing to women's clubs. They slobbered  appallingly.           *       *       *       *       *    Narli's students did all their homework assiduously and, in fact, put in  more work than had been assigned. At the end of the year, not only did  all of them pass, but with flying colors.    \"I hope you'll remember, Professor Gzann,\" the President of the  University said, \"that there will always be a job waiting for you  here--a non-exchange professorship. Love to have you.\"    \"Thank you,\" Narli replied politely.    Mrs. Purrington broke into loud sobs when he told her he was leaving  Earth. \"Oh, I'll miss you so, Narli! You will write, won't you?\"    \"Yes, of course,\" he said grimly. That made two hundred and eighteen  people to whom he'd had to promise to write.    It was fortunate he was traveling as a guest of the North American  government, he thought as he supervised the loading of his matched  interplanetary luggage; his eight steamer baskets; his leather-bound  _Encyclopedia Terrestria_, with his name imprinted in gold on each  volume; his Indian war-bonnet; his oil painting of the President; and  his six cases of champagne--all parting gifts--onto the liner. Otherwise  the fee for excess luggage would take what little remained of his bank  account. There had been so many expenses--clothes and hostess gifts and  ice.    Not all his mementoes were in his luggage. A new rare-metal watch  gleamed on each of his four furry wrists; a brand-new trobskin wallet,  platinum key-chain, and uranium fountain pen were in his pocket; and a  diamond and curium bauble clasped a tie lovingly handpainted by a female  student. The argyles on his fuzzy ankles had been knitted by another.  Still another devoted pupil had presented him with a hand-woven plastic  case full of frismil nuts to eat on the way back.           *       *       *       *       *    \"Well, Narli!\" Slood said, his face swelling with joy. \"Well, well!  You've put on weight, I see.\"    Narli dropped into his old chair with a sigh. Surely Slood might have  picked something else to comment on first--his haggardness, for  instance, or the increased spirituality of his expression.    \"Nothing else to do on Earth in your leisure moments but eat, I  suppose,\" Slood said, pushing over the nut tray. \"Even their food. Have  some frismils.\"    \"No, thank you,\" Narli replied coldly.    Slood looked at him in distress. \"Oh, how you must have suffered! Was it  very, very bad, Narli?\"    Narli hunched low in his chair. \"It was just awful.\"    \"I'm sure they didn't mean to be unkind,\" Slood assured him. \"Naturally,  you were a strange creature to them and they're only--\"    \"_Unkind?_\" Narli gave a bitter laugh. \"They practically killed me with  kindness! It was fuss, fuss, fuss all the time.\"    \"Now, Narli, I do wish you wouldn't be quite so sarcastic.\"    \"I'm _not_ being sarcastic. And I wasn't a strange creature to them. It  seems there's a sort of popular child's toy on Earth known as a--\" he  winced--\"teddy bear. I aroused pleasant childhood memories in them, so  they showered me with affection and edibles.\"    Slood closed his eyes in anguish. \"You are very brave, Narli,\" he said  almost reverently. \"Very brave and wise and good. Certainly that would  be the best thing to tell our people. After all, the Terrestrials are  our allies; we don't want to stir up public sentiment against them. But  you can be honest with _me_, Narli. Did they refuse to serve you in  restaurants? Were you segregated in public vehicles? Did they shrink  from you when you came close?\"    Narli beat the desk with all four hands. \"I was hardly ever given the  chance to be alone! They crawled all over me! Restaurants begged for my  trade! I had to hire private vehicles because in public ones I was  mobbed by admirers!\"    \"Such a short time,\" Slood murmured, \"and already suspicious of even me,  your oldest friend. But don't talk about it if you don't want to,  Narli.... Tell me, though, did they sneer at you and whisper  half-audible insults? Did they--\"    \"You're right!\" Narli snapped. \"I _don't_ want to talk about it.\"    Slood placed a comforting hand upon his shoulder. \"Perhaps that's  wisest, until the shock of your experience has worn off.\"    Narli"]]]
