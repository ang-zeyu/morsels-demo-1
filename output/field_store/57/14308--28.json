[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/2527"],[0,"The Sorrows of Young Werther (#2)"],[1,"I occasionally forget  myself, and take part in the innocent pleasures which are not yet  forbidden to the peasantry, and enjoy myself, for instance, with  genuine freedom and sincerity, round a well-covered table, or arrange an  excursion or a dance opportunely, and so forth, all this produces a good  effect upon my disposition; only I must forget that there lie dormant  within me so many other qualities which moulder uselessly, and which  I am obliged to keep carefully concealed. Ah! this thought affects my  spirits fearfully. And yet to be misunderstood is the fate of the like  of us.    Alas, that the friend of my youth is gone! Alas, that I ever knew her! I  might say to myself, \"You are a dreamer to seek what is not to be found  here below.\" But she has been mine. I have possessed that heart, that  noble soul, in whose presence I seemed to be more than I really was,  because I was all that I could be. Good heavens! did then a single power  of my soul remain unexercised? In her presence could I not display, to  its full extent, that mysterious feeling with which my heart embraces  nature? Was not our intercourse a perpetual web of the finest emotions,  of the keenest wit, the varieties of which, even in their very  eccentricity, bore the stamp of genius? Alas! the few years by which she  was my senior brought her to the grave before me. Never can I forget her  firm mind or her heavenly patience.    A few days ago I met a certain young V--, a frank, open fellow, with  a most pleasing countenance. He has just left the university, does not  deem himself overwise, but believes he knows more than other people.  He has worked hard, as I can perceive from many circumstances, and, in  short, possesses a large stock of information. When he heard that I am  drawing a good deal, and that I know Greek (two wonderful things for  this part of the country), he came to see me, and displayed his whole  store of learning, from Batteaux to Wood, from De Piles to Winkelmann:  he assured me he had read through the first part of Sultzer's theory,  and also possessed a manuscript of Heyne's work on the study of the  antique. I allowed it all to pass.    I have become acquainted, also, with a very worthy person, the district  judge, a frank and open-hearted man. I am told it is a most delightful  thing to see him in the midst of his children, of whom he has nine. His  eldest daughter especially is highly spoken of. He has invited me to go  and see him, and I intend to do so on the first opportunity. He lives  at one of the royal hunting-lodges, which can be reached from here in an  hour and a half by walking, and which he obtained leave to inhabit after  the loss of his wife, as it is so painful to him to reside in town and  at the court.    There have also come in my way a few other originals of a questionable  sort, who are in all respects undesirable, and most intolerable in their  demonstration of friendship. Good-bye. This letter will please you: it  is quite historical.    MAY 22.    That the life of man is but a dream, many a man has surmised heretofore;  and I, too, am everywhere pursued by this feeling. When I consider  the narrow limits within which our active and inquiring faculties are  confined; when I see how all our energies are wasted in providing for  mere necessities, which again have no further end than to prolong  a wretched existence; and then that all our satisfaction concerning  certain subjects of investigation ends in nothing better than a passive  resignation, whilst we amuse ourselves painting our prison-walls with  bright figures and brilliant landscapes,--when I consider all this,  Wilhelm, I am silent. I examine my own being, and find there a world,  but a world rather of imagination and dim desires, than of distinctness  and living power. Then everything swims before my senses, and I smile  and dream while pursuing my way through the world.    All learned professors and doctors are agreed that children do not  comprehend the cause of their desires; but that the grown-up should  wander about this earth like children, without knowing whence they come,  or whither they go, influenced as little by fixed motives, but guided  like them by biscuits, sugar-plums, and the rod,--this is what nobody is  willing to acknowledge; and yet I think it is palpable.    I know what you will say in reply; for I am ready to admit that they are  happiest, who, like children, amuse themselves with their playthings,  dress and undress their dolls, and attentively watch the cupboard,  where mamma has locked up her sweet things, and, when at last they get  a delicious morsel, eat it greedily, and exclaim, \"More!\" These are  certainly happy beings; but others also are objects of envy, who dignify  their paltry employments, and sometimes even their passions, with  pompous titles, representing them to mankind as gigantic achievements  performed for their welfare and glory. But the man who humbly  acknowledges the vanity of all this, who observes with what pleasure  the thriving citizen converts his little garden into a paradise, and how  patiently even the poor man pursues his weary way under his burden,  and how all wish equally to behold the light of the sun a little  longer,--yes, such a man is at peace, and creates his own world within  himself; and he is also happy, because he is a man. And then, however  limited his sphere, he still preserves in his bosom the sweet feeling of  liberty, and knows that he can quit his prison whenever he likes.    MAY 26.    You know of old my ways of settling anywhere, of selecting a little  cottage in some cosy spot, and of putting up in it with every  inconvenience. Here, too, I have discovered such a snug, comfortable  place, which possesses peculiar charms for me.    About a league from the town is a place called Walheim. (The reader  need not take the trouble to look for the place thus designated. We have  found it necessary to change the names given in the original.) It is  delightfully situated on the side of a hill; and, by proceeding along  one of the footpaths which lead out of the village, you can have a view  of the whole valley. A good old woman lives there, who keeps a small  inn. She sells wine, beer, and coffee, and is cheerful and pleasant  notwithstanding her age. The chief charm of this spot consists in two  linden-trees, spreading their enormous branches over the little green  before the church, which is entirely surrounded by peasants' cottages,  barns, and homesteads. I have seldom seen a place so retired and  peaceable; and there often have my table and chair brought out from  the little inn, and drink my coffee there, and read my Homer. Accident  brought me to the spot one fine afternoon, and I found it perfectly  deserted. Everybody was in the fields except a little boy about four  years of age, who was sitting on the ground, and held between his knees  a child about six months old: he pressed it to his bosom with both  arms, which thus formed a sort of arm-chair; and, notwithstanding the  liveliness which sparkled in its black eyes, it remained perfectly  still. The sight charmed me. I sat down upon a plough opposite, and  sketched with great delight this little picture of brotherly tenderness.  I added the neighbouring hedge, the barn-door, and some broken  cart-wheels, just as they happened to lie; and I found in about an hour  that I had made a very correct and interesting drawing, without putting  in the slightest thing of my own. This confirmed me in my resolution  of adhering, for the future, entirely to nature. She alone is  inexhaustible, and capable of forming the greatest masters. Much may be  alleged in favour of rules, as much may be likewise advanced in favour  of the laws of society: an artist formed upon them will never produce  anything absolutely bad or disgusting; as a man who observes the laws,  and obeys decorum, can never be an absolutely intolerable neighbour, nor  a decided villain: but yet, say what you will of rules, they destroy the  genuine feeling of nature, as well as its true expression. Do not tell  me \"that this is too hard, that they only restrain and prune superfluous  branches, etc.\" My good friend, I will illustrate this by an analogy.  These things resemble love. A warmhearted youth becomes strongly  attached to a maiden: he spends every hour of the day in her company,  wears out his health, and lavishes his fortune, to afford continual  proof that he is wholly devoted to her. Then comes a man of the world, a  man of place and respectability, and addresses him thus: \"My good young  friend, love is natural; but you must love within bounds. Divide your  time: devote a portion to business, and give the hours of recreation to  your mistress. Calculate your fortune; and out of the superfluity you  may make her a present, only not too often,--on her birthday, and such  occasions.\" Pursuing this advice, he may become a useful member of  society, and I should advise every prince to give him an appointment;  but it is all up with his love, and with his genius if he be an artist.  O my friend! why is it that the torrent of genius so seldom bursts  forth, so seldom rolls in full-flowing stream, overwhelming your  astounded soul? Because, on either side of this stream, cold and  respectable persons have taken up their abodes, and, forsooth, their  summer-houses and tulip-beds would suffer from the torrent; wherefore  they dig trenches, and raise embankments betimes, in order to avert the  impending danger.    MAY 27.    I find I have fallen into raptures, declamation, and similes, and have  forgotten, in consequence, to tell you what became of the children.  Absorbed in my artistic contemplations, which I briefly described in my  letter of yesterday, I continued sitting on the plough for two hours.  Toward evening a young woman, with a basket on her arm, came running  toward the children, who had not moved all that time. She exclaimed"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/25281"],[0,"Briefless Ballads and Legal Lyrics (#2)"],[1,"continually occurring  in the Roman institutional writers as typical names of parties to legal  process, corresponding very much to the John Stiles and John Nokes of  the older English law-books, and the Amr and Zaid of Mohammedan law.  John Stiles was frequently contracted to J. S.    [C] _Vi_ and _clam_ were part of the form of the interdict, which was a  mode of procedure by which the praetor settled the right of possession of  landed property.    [D] The casual ejector was John Doe, who was, like Richard Roe, an  entirely imaginary person, of much importance in the old action of  ejectment abolished in 1852.    [E] The allusion is to the \"Advocates' Widows Fund,\" subscribed to by  all members of the Scottish bar, married or unmarried. The non-existent  widow of the unmarried advocate has been a frequent subject of legal  verse. See \"The Bachelor's Dream,\" by John Rankine, (_Journal of  Jurisprudence_, vol. xxii. p. 155), \"My Widow,\" by David Crichton (_id._  vol. xxiv. p. 51).          The Squire's Daughter          We crawled about the nursery        In tenderest years in tether,      At six we waded in the sea        And caught our colds together.        At ten we practised playing at        A kind of heathen cricket,      A croquet mallet was the bat,        The Squire's old hat the wicket.        At twelve, the cricket waxing slow,        With home-made bow and arrow      We took to shooting--once I know        I all but hit a sparrow.        She took birds' nests from easy trees,        I climbed the oaks and ashes,      'Twas deadly work for hands and knees,        Deplorable for sashes.        At hide and seek one summer day        We played in merry laughter,      'Twas then she hid her heart away,        I never found it after.        So time slipped by until my call,        For out of the professions      I chose the Bar as best of all,        And joined the Loamshire Sessions.        The reason for it was that there        Her father, short and pursy,      Doled out scant justice in the chair        And even scanter mercy.        As Holofernes lost his head        To Judith of Bethulia,      So I fell victim, but instead        Of Judith it was Julia.        My speech left juries in the dark,        Of Julia I was thinking,      And once I heard a coarse remark        About a fellow drinking.        I practised verse in leisure time        Both in and out of season,      It was indubitably rhyme,        Occasionally reason.        I lacked the cheek to tell my woes,        Had not concealment fed on      My damask cheek, but left my nose        With twice its share of red on?        Too horrible was this suspense,        At last, in desperation      I went to Loamshire on pretence        Of death of a relation.        The Squire was beaming; \"Julia's gone        To London for a visit,      But with a wedding coming on        That's not surprising, is it?        \"Old friends like you will think, no doubt,        That she is young to marry,      But ever since she first came out,        She's been engaged to Harry.\"          Her Letter in Chambers          I sat by the fire and watched it blaze,        And dreamed that she wrote me a letter,      And for that dream to the end of my days        To Fancy I owe myself debtor.        Next day there came the postman's knock,        The morning was bright and sunny,      And showed me a sheaf of circulars, stock        Attempts to get hold of my money.        'Mid correspondence of this dull kind        A dainty notelet lay hidden,      It seemed as though it had half a mind        To consider itself forbidden.        The writing was like herself, complete,        With a touch of her queenly bearing,      So Venus wrote when she ordered in Crete        Her doves to take her an airing.        Inside it was just as promising,        'Twas a pressing invitation      To dine at her house to-morrow, and bring        My book for her approbation.        For I have published, be it confessed,        A little volume of verses,      And in the volume whatever is best        The praise of herself rehearses.        I sit by the fire, and again I dream        A happier dream than ever,      I see her beautiful eyes soft gleam        As she murmurs, \"How lovely--how clever!\"        Her criticism may be commonplace,        But who can be angry after      Now sweet with pity he marks her face,        Now bright with impulsive laughter?          Law and Poetry          In days of old did law and rime        A common pathway follow,      For Themis in the mythic time        Was sister of Apollo.        The Hindu statutes tripped in feet        As daintily as Dryads,      And law in Wales to be complete        Was versified in triads.        The wise Alfonso of Castile        Composed his code in metre      Thereby to make its flavour feel        A little bit the sweeter.        But law and rime were found to be        A trifle inconsistent,      And now in statutes poetry        Is wholly non-existent.        Still here and there some advocate        Before his fellows know it      Has had bestowed on him by fate        The laurel of the poet.        Let him who has been honoured so,        In truth a _rara avis_,      Find precedents in Cicero        And our Chief Justice Davis;        And more than all in Cino; he,        So plaintive a narrator      Of fair Selvaggia's cruelty,        Won fame as a glossator.        Let him remember Thomas More        And Scott and Alciatus,      And Grotius with an ample store        Of most divine afflatus.        But let him, if his bread and cheese        Depend on his profession,      Bethink him that the art of these        Was not their sole possession.        The stream that flows from Helicon        Is scarcely a Pactolus,      A richer prize is theirs who con        Dull treatises on _dolus_.        'Tis well that some bold spirits dare        To cut themselves asunder      From bonds of law like old Moliere,        While lawyers gaze in wonder.        The world had been a poorer place        Had Goethe lived by pleading      Or Tasso won a hopeless case        With Ariosto leading.          Somewhere          Somewhere in a distant star,      Cities of Cocaigne there are,      Paradises of the Bar.        Somewhere 'neath another sun      Counsel cease to see the fun      Lurking in a judge's pun.        Somewhere courts are fair to see,      Beauty joins utility,      Ushers answer courteously.        Somewhere there are bailiwicks      Which for dock defences fix      Nothing under three-five-six.        Somewhere rises struggle sore      For revisorships no more,      Every shire has half a score.        Somewhere educated thought      Scientifically taught      Cross-examines as it ought.        Somewhere judgments are obeyed,      Executions are not stayed,      Fees are almost always paid.        Somewhere County Councils press      Banquets on the circuit mess,      Fleshpots in the wilderness.        Somewhere at Assizes grow      Prosecutions row on row,      Every man has six or so.        Somewhere, eager but for right,      Court and counsel cease to cite      Pointless cases recondite.        Somewhere headnotes give the ground      Whereupon the judges found      Judgments generally sound.        Somewhere juries use their sense,      Basing on the evidence      Verdicts of intelligence.        Somewhere rich embroideries      Woven cunningly of lies      Part in twain at truth's clear eyes.        Somewhere justice grows from wrong,      Till the right that suffered long      Sings at last its triumph song.        Somewhere--even in a place      Peopled by a perfect race--      One side holds a losing case.        Somewhere since the world began      Heaven hath made an honest man,      Somewhere in Aldebaran.          Roman Law          I am a \"coach\" in Roman law by fate,        But Nature must have meant me for a poet,      And while I struggle with a rule or date,        Poetic thoughts intrude before I know it.        The changing sunshine on the summer sea        Drives forth the law of _cessio bonorum_,      _Peculium castrense_ speaks to me        Of Horace and his _Dulce et decorum_.        I see the matine bee among the flowers        Instead of _testamentum militare_,      And wander far away from agent's powers        To picture me again some Maud or Mary.        In truth there is no sequence in the thought,        Why should the title _De Societate_      Suggest, not trading partners, as it ought,        But visions of my last night's valse with Katie?        But worse than this, when I have done my task,        Stern law again asserts her domination,      'Tis cruel 'mid the new-mown hay to bask,        And find one's mind is running on novation;        Or in the dusk, when glow-worms light the moss,        To hear the distant voice of Philomela      Expound the three varieties of _dos_        And wax right eloquent about _tutela_.        I had a little respite yesterday,        Dining with one who well knew how to dine us,      But when I slept, the charm soon fled away,        I dreamed I was a _praetor peregrinus_.        Dismasted in the deep of law I lie,        A poor reward it is to stand confessed as      The Virgil of the interdict _de vi_,        The Petrarch of the _patria potestas_.          Bologna          I go from colonnade to colonnade        In streets that Dante trod, and past the towers        Aslant toward heaven, and listen to the hours      Chimed by the bells of choirs where Dante prayed.      They cease; then lo! the foot of time seems stayed        Five hundred years and more, I find me bowers        Where sweet and noble ladies weave them flowers      For one who reads Boccaccio in the shade.      The cowled students halt by two and threes        To hear the voice come thrilling through the trees,        Then tear themselves away to themes more trite.      Anon I"]]]
