Economic considerations have    played second fiddle to political and military upheavals during more    than 16 years of war, including the nearly 10-year Soviet military    occupation (which ended 15 February 1989). Over the past decade,    one-third of the population fled the country, with Pakistan and Iran    sheltering more than 6 million refugees. Now, only 1.0 million    Afghan refugees remain in Pakistan and about 1.3 million in Iran.    Another 1 million probably moved into and around urban areas within    Afghanistan. Gross domestic product has fallen substantially over    the past 15 years because of the loss of labor and capital and the    disruption of trade and transport. Millions of people continue to    suffer from insufficient food, clothing, housing, and lack of    medical care. Numerical data are extremely shaky.

The smaller entities are compared with Washington,  DC (178 sq km, 69 sq mi) or The Mall in Washington, DC (0.59  sq km, 0.23 sq mi, 146 acres).    Background: This entry usually highlights major historic  events, current issues, and may include a statement about  one or two key future trends. This entry appears for only a  few countries at the present time, but will be added to all  countries in the future.    Birth rate: This entry gives the average annual number of  births during a year per 1,000 persons in the population at  midyear; also known as crude birth rate. The birth rate is  usually the dominant factor in determining the rate of  population growth. It depends on both the level of fertility  and the age structure of the population.    Budget: This entry includes revenues, total expenditures,  and capital expenditures. These figures are calculated on an  exchange rate basis, i.e., not in purchasing power parity  (PPP) terms.    Capital: This entry gives the location of the seat of  government.    Climate: This entry includes a brief description of typical  weather regimes throughout the year.    Coastline: This entry gives the total length of the boundary  between the land area (including islands) and the sea.    Communications: This category deals with the means of  exchanging information and includes the telephone, radio,  and television entries.    Communications--note: This entry includes miscellaneous  communications information of significance not included  elsewhere.    Constitution: This entry includes the dates of adoption,  revisions, and major amendments.    Country map: Most versions of the Factbook provide a country  map in color. The maps were produced from the best  information available at the time of preparation. Names  and/or boundaries may have changed subsequently.    Country name: This entry includes all forms of the country's  name approved by the US Board on Geographic Names (Italy is  used as an example): conventional long form (Italian  Republic), conventional short form (Italy), local long form  (Repubblica Italiana), local short form (Italia), former  (Kingdom of Italy), as well as the abbreviation. Also see  the Terminology note.    Currency: This entry identifies the national medium of  exchange and its basic subunit.    Data code: This entry gives the official US Government  digraph that precisely identifies every land entity without  overlap, duplication, or omission. AF, for example, is the  data code for Afghanistan. This two-letter country code is a  standardized geopolitical data element promulgated in the  Federal Information Processing Standards Publication (FIPS)  10-4 by the National Institute of Standards and Technology  at the US Department of Commerce and maintained by the  Office of the Geographer and Global Issues at the US  Department of State. The data code is used to eliminate  confusion and incompatibility in the collection, processing,  and dissemination of area-specific data and is particularly  useful for interchanging data between databases. Appendix F  cross-references various country data codes and Appendix G  does the same thing for hydrographic data codes.    Data codes--country: This information is presented in  Appendix F: Cross-Reference List of Country Data Codes which  includes the US Government approved Federal Information  Processing Standards (FIPS) codes, the International  Organization for Standardization (ISO) codes, and Internet  codes for land entities.    Data codes--hydrographic: This information is presented in  Appendix G: Cross-Reference List of Hydrographic Data Codes  which includes the International Hydrographic Organization  (IHO) codes, Aeronautical Chart and Information Center  (ACIC; now National Imagery and Mapping Agency or NIMA)  codes, and Defense Intelligence Agency (DIA) codes for  hydrographic entities. The US Government has not yet  approved a standard for hydrographic data codes similar to  the FIPS 10-4 standard for country data codes.    Date of information: In general, information available as of  1 January 1999, was used in the preparation of this edition.    Death rate: This entry gives the average annual number of  deaths during a year per 1,000 population at midyear; also  known as crude death rate. The death rate, while only a  rough indicator of the mortality situation in a country,  accurately indicates the current mortality impact on  population growth. This indicator is significantly affected  by age distribution, and most countries will eventually show  a rise in the overall death rate, in spite of continued  decline in mortality at all ages, as declining fertility  results in an aging population.    Debt--external: This entry gives the total amount of public  foreign financial obligations.    Dependency status: This entry describes the formal  relationship between a particular nonindependent entity and  an independent state.    Dependent areas: This entry contains an alphabetical listing  of all nonindependent entities associated in some way with a  particular independent state.    Diplomatic representation: The US Government has diplomatic  relations with 184 independent states, including 178 of the  185 UN members (excluded UN members are Bhutan, Cuba, Iran,  Iraq, North Korea, former Yugoslavia, and the US itself). In  addition, the US has diplomatic relations with 6 independent  states that are not in the UN--Holy See, Kiribati, Nauru,  Switzerland, Tonga, and Tuvalu.    Diplomatic representation from the US: This entry includes  the chief of mission, embassy address, mailing address,  telephone number, FAX number, branch office locations,  consulate general locations, and consulate locations.    Diplomatic representation in the US: This entry includes the  chief of the foreign mission, chancery address, telephone  number, FAX number, consulate general locations, consulate  locations, honorary consulate general locations, and  honorary consulate locations.    Disputes--international: This entry includes a wide variety  of situations that range from traditional bilateral boundary  disputes to unilateral claims of one sort or another.  Information regarding disputes over international  terrestrial and maritime boundaries has been reviewed by the  US Department of State. References to other situations  involving borders or frontiers may also be included, such as  resource disputes, geopolitical questions, or irredentist  issues; however, inclusion does not necessarily constitute  official acceptance or recognition by the US Government.    Economic aid--donor: This entry refers to net official  development assistance (ODA) from OECD nations to developing  countries and multilateral organizations. ODA is defined as  financial assistance that is concessional in character, has  the main objective to promote economic development and  welfare of LDCs, and contains a grant element of at least  25%. The entry does not cover other official flows (OOF) or  private flows.    Economic aid--recipient: This entry, which is subject to  major problems of definition and statistical coverage,  refers to the net inflow of Official Development Finance  (ODF) to recipient countries. The figure includes assistance  from the World Bank, the IMF, and other international  organizations and from individual nation donors. Formal  commitments of aid are included in the data. Omitted from  the data are grants by private organizations. Aid comes in  various forms including outright grants and loans. The entry  thus is the difference between new inflows and repayments.    Economy: This category includes the entries dealing with the  size, development, and management of productive resources,  i.e., land, labor, and capital.    Economy--overview: This entry briefly describes the type of  economy, including the degree of market orientation, the  level of economic development, the most important natural  resources, and the unique areas of specialization. It also  characterizes major economic events and policy changes in  the most recent 12 months and may include a statement about  one or two key future macroeconomic trends.    Electricity--consumption: This entry consists of total  electricity generated annually plus imports and minus  exports, expressed in kilowatt hours.    Electricity--exports: This entry is the total exported  electricity in kilowatt hours.    Electricity--imports: This entry is the total imported  electricity in kilowatt hours.    Electricity--production: This entry is the annual electricity  generated expressed in kilowatt hours.    Electricity--production by source: This entry indicates the  percentage share of annual electricity production of each  energy source. These are fossil fuel, hydro, nuclear, and  other (solar, geothermal, and wind).    Elevation extremes: This entry includes both the highest  point and the lowest point.    Entities: Some of the independent states, dependencies,  areas of special sovereignty, and governments included in  this publication are not independent, and others are not  officially recognized by the US Government. \"Independent  state\" refers to a people politically organized into a  sovereign state with a definite territory. \"Dependencies\"  and \"areas of special sovereignty\" refer to a broad category  of political entities that are associated in some way with  an independent state. \"Country\" names used in the table of  contents or for page headings are usually the short-form  names as approved by the US Board on Geographic Names and  may include independent states, dependencies, and areas of  special sovereignty, or other geographic entities. There are  a total of 266 separate geographic entities in The World  Factbook that may be categorized as follows:      INDEPENDENT STATES    191   Afghanistan, Albania, Algeria, Andorra, Angola, Antigua       and Barbuda, Argentina, Armenia, Australia, Austria,    "]]]
