The object of this work is not to describe all the many races of animals  which have been domesticated by man, and of the plants which have been  cultivated by him; even if I possessed the requisite knowledge, so gigantic  an undertaking would be here superfluous. It is my intention to give under  the head of each species only such facts as I have been able to collect or  observe, showing the amount and nature of the changes which animals and  plants have undergone whilst under man's dominion, or which bear on the  general principles of variation. In one case alone, namely in that of the  domestic pigeon, I will describe fully all the chief races, their history,  the amount and nature of their differences, and the probable steps by which  they have been formed. I have selected this case, because, as we shall  hereafter see, the materials are better than in any other; and one case  fully described will in fact illustrate all others. But I shall also  describe domesticated rabbits, fowls, and ducks, with considerable  fullness.    The subjects discussed in this volume are so connected that it is not a  little difficult to decide how they can be best arranged. I have determined  in the first part to give, under the heads of the various animals and  plants, a large body of facts, some of which may at first appear but little  related to our subject, and to devote the latter part to general  discussions. Whenever I have found it necessary to give numerous details,  in support of any proposition or conclusion, small type has been used. The  reader {2} will, I think, find this plan a convenience, for, if he does not  doubt the conclusion or care about the details, he can easily pass them  over; yet I may be permitted to say that some of the discussions thus  printed deserve attention, at least from the professed naturalist.    It may be useful to those who have read nothing about Natural Selection, if  I here give a brief sketch of the whole subject and of its bearing on the  origin of species.[1] This is the more desirable, as it is impossible in  the present work to avoid many allusions to questions which will be fully  discussed in future volumes.    From a remote period, in all parts of the world, man has subjected many  animals and plants to domestication or culture. Man has no power of  altering the absolute conditions of life; he cannot change the climate of  any country; he adds no new element to the soil; but he can remove an  animal or plant from one climate or soil to another, and give it food on  which it did not subsist in its natural state. It is an error to speak of  man \"tampering with nature\" and causing variability. If organic beings had  not possessed an inherent tendency to vary, man could have done nothing.[2]  He unintentionally exposes his animals and plants to various conditions of  life, and variability supervenes, which he cannot even prevent or check.  Consider the simple case of a plant which has been cultivated during a long  time in its native country, and which consequently has not been subjected  to any change of climate. It has been protected to a certain extent from  the competing roots of plants of other kinds; it has generally been grown  in manured soil, but probably not richer than that of many an alluvial  flat; and lastly, it has been exposed to changes in its conditions, being  grown sometimes in one district and sometimes in another, in different  soils. Under such circumstances, {3} scarcely a plant can be named, though  cultivated in the rudest manner, which has not given birth to several  varieties. It can hardly be maintained that during the many changes which  this earth has undergone, and during the natural migrations of plants from  one land or island to another, tenanted by different species, that such  plants will not often have been subjected to changes in their conditions  analogous to those which almost inevitably cause cultivated plants to vary.  No doubt man selects varying individuals, sows their seeds, and again  selects their varying offspring. But the initial variation on which man  works, and without which he can do nothing, is caused by slight changes in  the conditions of life, which must often have occurred under nature. Man,  therefore, may be said to have been trying an experiment on a gigantic  scale; and it is an experiment which nature during the long lapse of time  has incessantly tried. Hence it follows that the principles of  domestication are important for us. The main result is that organic beings  thus treated have varied largely, and the variations have been inherited.  This has apparently been one chief cause of the belief long held by some  few naturalists that species in a state of nature undergo change.    I shall in this volume treat, as fully as my materials permit, the whole  subject of variation under domestication. We may thus hope to obtain some  light, little though it be, on the causes of variability,--on the laws  which govern it, such as the direct action of climate and food, the effects  of use and disuse, and of correlation of growth,--and on the amount of  change to which domesticated organisms are liable. We shall learn something  on the laws of inheritance, on the effects of crossing different breeds,  and on that sterility which often supervenes when organic beings are  removed from their natural conditions of life, and likewise when they are  too closely interbred. During this investigation we shall see that the  principle of Selection is all important. Although man does not cause  variability and cannot even prevent it, he can select, preserve, and  accumulate the variations given to him by the hand of nature in any way  which he chooses; and thus he can certainly produce a great result.  Selection may be followed either methodically and intentionally, or  unconsciously and unintentionally. Man {4} may select and preserve each  successive variation, with the distinct intention of improving and altering  a breed, in accordance with a preconceived idea; and by thus adding up  variations, often so slight as to be imperceptible by an uneducated eye, he  has effected wonderful changes and improvements. It can, also, be clearly  shown that man, without any intention or thought of improving the breed, by  preserving in each successive generation the individuals which he prizes  most, and by destroying the worthless individuals, slowly, though surely,  induces great changes. As the will of man thus comes into play, we can  understand how it is that domesticated breeds show adaptation to his wants  and pleasures. We can further understand how it is that domestic races of  animals and cultivated races of plants often exhibit an abnormal character,  as compared with natural species; for they have been modified not for their  own benefit, but for that of man.    In a second work I shall discuss the variability of organic beings in a  state of nature; namely, the individual differences presented by animals  and plants, and those slightly greater and generally inherited differences"]]]
