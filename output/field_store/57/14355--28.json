[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/27250"],[0,"What I Saw in America (#2)"],[1,"whether I was an anarchist; and naturally would not have  minded if I had been a polygamist. The Arab chief was probably a  polygamist himself. These slaves of Asiatic autocracy were content, in  the old liberal fashion, to judge me by my actions; they did not inquire  into my thoughts. They held their power as limited to the limitation of  practice; they did not forbid me to hold a theory. It would be easy to  argue here that Western democracy persecutes where even Eastern  despotism tolerates or emancipates. It would be easy to develop the  fancy that, as compared with the sultans of Turkey or Egypt, the  American Constitution is a thing like the Spanish Inquisition.    Only the traveller who stops at that point is totally wrong; and the  traveller only too often does stop at that point. He has found something  to make him laugh, and he will not suffer it to make him think. And the  remedy is not to unsay what he has said, not even, so to speak, to  unlaugh what he has laughed, not to deny that there is something unique  and curious about this American inquisition into our abstract opinions,  but rather to continue the train of thought, and follow the admirable  advice of Mr. H. G. Wells, who said, 'It is not much good thinking of a  thing unless you think it out.' It is not to deny that American  officialism is rather peculiar on this point, but to inquire what it  really is which makes America peculiar, or which is peculiar to America.  In short, it is to get some ultimate idea of what America _is_; and the  answer to that question will reveal something much deeper and grander  and more worthy of our intelligent interest.    It may have seemed something less than a compliment to compare the  American Constitution to the Spanish Inquisition. But oddly enough, it  does involve a truth; and still more oddly perhaps, it does involve a  compliment. The American Constitution does resemble the Spanish  Inquisition in this: that it is founded on a creed. America is the only  nation in the world that is founded on a creed. That creed is set forth  with dogmatic and even theological lucidity in the Declaration of  Independence; perhaps the only piece of practical politics that is also  theoretical politics and also great literature. It enunciates that all  men are equal in their claim to justice, that governments exist to give  them that justice, and that their authority is for that reason just. It  certainly does condemn anarchism, and it does also by inference condemn  atheism, since it clearly names the Creator as the ultimate authority  from whom these equal rights are derived. Nobody expects a modern  political system to proceed logically in the application of such dogmas,  and in the matter of God and Government it is naturally God whose claim  is taken more lightly. The point is that there is a creed, if not about  divine, at least about human things.    Now a creed is at once the broadest and the narrowest thing in the  world. In its nature it is as broad as its scheme for a brotherhood of  all men. In its nature it is limited by its definition of the nature of  all men. This was true of the Christian Church, which was truly said to  exclude neither Jew nor Greek, but which did definitely substitute  something else for Jewish religion or Greek philosophy. It was truly  said to be a net drawing in of all kinds; but a net of a certain  pattern, the pattern of Peter the Fisherman. And this is true even of  the most disastrous distortions or degradations of that creed; and true  among others of the Spanish Inquisition. It may have been narrow  touching theology, it could not confess to being narrow about  nationality or ethnology. The Spanish Inquisition might be admittedly  Inquisitorial; but the Spanish Inquisition could not be merely Spanish.  Such a Spaniard, even when he was narrower than his own creed, had to be  broader than his own empire. He might burn a philosopher because he was  heterodox; but he must accept a barbarian because he was orthodox. And  we see, even in modern times, that the same Church which is blamed for  making sages heretics is also blamed for making savages priests. Now in  a much vaguer and more evolutionary fashion, there is something of the  same idea at the back of the great American experiment; the experiment  of a democracy of diverse races which has been compared to a  melting-pot. But even that metaphor implies that the pot itself is of a  certain shape and a certain substance; a pretty solid substance. The  melting-pot must not melt. The original shape was traced on the lines of  Jeffersonian democracy; and it will remain in that shape until it  becomes shapeless. America invites all men to become citizens; but it  implies the dogma that there is such a thing as citizenship. Only, so  far as its primary ideal is concerned, its exclusiveness is religious  because it is not racial. The missionary can condemn a cannibal,  precisely because he cannot condemn a Sandwich Islander. And in  something of the same spirit the American may exclude a polygamist,  precisely because he cannot exclude a Turk.    Now for America this is no idle theory. It may have been theoretical,  though it was thoroughly sincere, when that great Virginian gentleman  declared it in surroundings that still had something of the character of  an English countryside. It is not merely theoretical now. There is  nothing to prevent America being literally invaded by Turks, as she is  invaded by Jews or Bulgars. In the most exquisitely inconsequent of the  _Bab Ballads_, we are told concerning Pasha Bailey Ben:--           One morning knocked at half-past eight       A tall Red Indian at his gate.       In Turkey, as you 'r' p'raps aware,       Red Indians are extremely rare.      But the converse need by no means be true. There is nothing in the  nature of things to prevent an emigration of Turks increasing and  multiplying on the plains where the Red Indians wandered; there is  nothing to necessitate the Turks being extremely rare. The Red Indians,  alas, are likely to be rarer. And as I much prefer Red Indians to Turks,  not to mention Jews, I speak without prejudice; but the point here is  that America, partly by original theory and partly by historical  accident, does lie open to racial admixtures which most countries would  think incongruous or comic. That is why it is only fair to read any  American definitions or rules in a certain light, and relatively to a  rather unique position. It is not fair to compare the position of those  who may meet Turks in the back street with that of those who have never  met Turks except in the _Bab Ballads_. It is not fair simply to compare  America with England in its regulations about the Turk. In short, it is  not fair to do what almost every Englishman probably does; to look at  the American international examination paper, and laugh and be satisfied  with saying, 'We don't have any of that nonsense in England.'    We do not have any of that nonsense in England because we have never  attempted to have any of that philosophy in England. And, above all,  because we have the enormous advantage of feeling it natural to be  national, because there is nothing else to be. England in these days is  not well governed; England is not well educated; England suffers from  wealth and poverty that are not well distributed. But England is  English; _esto perpetua_. England is English as France is French or  Ireland Irish; the great mass of men taking certain national traditions  for granted. Now this gives us a totally different and a very much  easier task. We have not got an inquisition, because we have not got a  creed; but it is arguable that we do not need a creed, because we have  got a character. In any of the old nations the national unity is  preserved by the national type. Because we have a type we do not need to  have a test.    Take that innocent question, 'Are you an anarchist?' which is  intrinsically quite as impudent as 'Are you an optimist?' or 'Are you a  philanthropist?' I am not discussing here whether these things are  right, but whether most of us are in a position to know them rightly.  Now it is quite true that most Englishmen do not find it necessary to go  about all day asking each other whether they are anarchists. It is quite  true that the phrase occurs on no British forms that I have seen. But  this is not only because most of the Englishmen are not anarchists. It  is even more because even the anarchists are Englishmen. For instance,  it would be easy to make fun of the American formula by noting that the  cap would fit all sorts of bald academic heads. It might well be  maintained that Herbert Spencer was an anarchist. It is practically  certain that Auberon Herbert was an anarchist. But Herbert Spencer was  an extraordinarily typical Englishman of the Nonconformist middle class.  And Auberon Herbert was an extraordinarily typical English aristocrat of  the old and genuine aristocracy. Every one knew in his heart that the  squire would not throw a bomb at the Queen, and the Nonconformist would  not throw a bomb at anybody. Every one knew that there was something  subconscious in a man like Auberon Herbert, which would have come out  only in throwing bombs at the enemies of England; as it did come out in  his son and namesake, the generous and unforgotten, who fell flinging  bombs from the sky far beyond the German line. Every one knows that  normally, in the last resort, the English gentleman is patriotic. Every  one knows that the English Nonconformist is national even when he denies  that he is patriotic. Nothing is more notable indeed than the fact that  nobody is more stamped with the mark of his own nation than the man who  says that there ought to be no nations. Somebody called Cobden the  International Man; but no man could be more English than Cobden.  Everybody recognises Tolstoy as the iconoclast of all patriotism; but  nobody could be"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/27262"],[0,"Mother Earth, Vol. 1 No. 3, May 1906 (#2)"],[1," expect or desire that the President should become a  Revolutionist. This would certainly be no gain of ours, nor would the  State suffer harm. Surely there are enough professional politicians who  do not lack talent for the calling of doorkeepers on a large scale.    As to the moral sermons against the undesirable and obnoxious element,  all that can be said, from a practical standpoint, is, that their  originality and wisdom are in no proportion to the salary the sermonizer  receives. Competition among preachers of penitence and servility is  almost as great as among patent medicine quacks. Four or five thousand a  year can easily buy the services of a corpulent, reverend gentleman of  some prominence.    [Illustration]    The dangers of the first of May, when France was to be ruined by the  \"mob\" of socialists and anarchists, was very fantastically described by  the Paris correspondents of the American newspapers. These gentlemen  seem to have known everything. They discovered that the cause of the  threatened revolution was to be found in the irresponsible good nature  and kindness of the French government.    Just show \"Satan\" Anarchy a finger, and straightway he will seize the  entire arm. Especially M. Clemenceau was severely censured as being  altogether too good a fellow to make a reliable minister. There he is  with France near the abyss of a social revolution! That is the manner in  which history is being manufactured for boarding-school young ladies.    The social revolution may come, but surely not because of the kindness  or good nature of the government. France needed a newspaper boom for her  elections: \"The republic is in danger; for goodness' sake give us your  vote on election day!\"    In order that the citizens might feel the proper horror, trade-union  leaders, anarchists and even a few royalistic scare-crows were arrested;  at the same time the sympathy and devotion of the government for its  people manifested itself in the reign of the military terror in the  strike regions.    The real seriousness of the situation, the correspondents failed to  grasp. How could they? since they got their wisdom in the ante-chamber  of the ministry.    The revolutionary labor organizations care little for the good will or  the Jesuit kindness of the authorities. They continue with their work,  propagate the idea of direct action, and strengthen the anti-military  movement, the result of which is already being felt among the soldiers  and officers.    The officer who jumped upon the platform at the Bourse du Travail,  expressing his solidarity with the workers and declaring that he would  not fire on them, was immediately arrested; but this will only influence  others to follow the good example.    [Illustration]    In the old fables the lion is described as supreme judge and not the  mule or the wether.    In Cleveland things are different. Several weeks ago Olga Nethersole  gave a performance of Sappho there. Whereupon the police felt moved to  perform an operation on the play, for moral reasons, of course. The  staircase scene was ordered to be left out altogether.    Ye poor, depraved artists, how low ye might sink, were the police and  Comstock not here to watch over the moral qualities of your productions!    If one observes one of these prosaic fellows on the corner, terribly  bored, and with his entire intellect concentrated on his club, and how  out of pure ennui he is constantly recapitulating the number of his  brass buttons, one can hardly realize that such an individual has been  entrusted with the power to decide the fate of an artistic production.    [Illustration]    1792 the French people marched through the streets singing:           O, what is it the people cry?       They ask for all equality.           The poor no more shall be           In slavish misery;           The idle rich shall flee.         O, what is it the people need?       They ask for bread and iron and lead.           The iron to win our pay,           The lead our foes to slay,           The bread our friends to feed.      The soldiers at Mount Carmel, Pennsylvania, who were ordered by their  superiors to fire into a crowd of strikers and wounded and killed  innocent men and women, do not sing the Carmagnole; they sing:           \"My country, 'tis of thee,       Sweet land of Liberty!\"      If the ruling powers continue to maintain peace and order with iron and  blood it may happen that the meaningless national hymn may be drowned by  the Carmagnole, pealing forth like thunder from the throats of the  masses.    [Illustration]    To the credit of human nature be it said, it is not altogether hopeless.  Since tyranny has existed, human nature has ever rebelled against it.    Real slavery exists only when the oppressed consider their fate as  something normal, something self-evident.    There is greater security for tyranny in slavish thoughts, indifference  and pettiness than in cannons and swords.    [Illustration]          \"THIS MAN GORKY.\"    By MARGARET GRANT.      THE women of America are aroused as never before. They always are  aroused to the defense of their firesides. Even those women who live in  flats are awake to the need for defending their radiators or their gas  stoves; it is inherent in the nature of woman, it seems.    Most of the women's societies and clubs have spoken in no uncertain  terms concerning the outrage that has been put upon the civilization of  this great country by the conduct of this man Gorky. And, in fact, it is  a thing not to be borne.    As for me, I belong to the Woman's Association for the Regulation of the  Morals of Others, a society which is second to none in its activity and  usefulness, but which has seen fit to defer its own discussion of this  man Gorky's conduct until most of the other women's societies have  spoken.    We have just had our meeting, and I think that if this man Gorky should  read an account of our proceedings, he would certainly get out of this  outraged country with all the celerity of which he is capable. But, of  course, he is only a foreigner after all and probably will not  comprehend the exquisite purity of our morals.    I want to say that in our meetings we do not slavishly follow those  parliamentary rules which men have made for their guidance, but allow  ourselves some latitude in discussion. And we do not invite some man to  come and do all the talking, as is the case in some women's clubs.    Mrs. Blanderocks was in the chair. We began with an informal discussion  of the best way of preventing the common people from dressing so as not  to be distinguished from the upper classes, but there was no heart in  the talk, for we all felt that it was only preliminary. It was my friend  Sarah Warner who changed the subject.    \"The Woman's State Republican Association held its annual meeting at  Delmonico's yesterday,\" she said, quietly drawing a newspaper clipping  from her pocket-book.    \"And had some men there to amuse them and to tell them what to do,\" said  Mrs. Blanderocks with cutting irony.    We all laughed heartily. We meet at Mrs. Blanderocks' house, and she  always provides a beautiful luncheon.    \"But Mrs. Flint said some things that I would like to read to you,\" said  Sarah. \"It won't take long. I cut this out of the 'Times' this morning.\"    \"What is it about?\" some one asked.    \"Gorky,\" Sarah answered, closing her eyes in a way to express volumes.    You could hear all the members catch their breath. This was what they  had come for. I broke the oppressive silence.    \"I foresee,\" I said, \"that in the discussion of this subject there will  be said things likely to bring a blush to the cheek of innocence, and I  move that all unmarried women under the age of twenty-five be excluded  from the meeting for as long as this man is under discussion.\"    A fierce cry of rage rose from all parts of the crowded room. I did not  understand. I could see no one who would be affected by the rule. Mrs.  Blanderocks raised her hand to command silence and said coldly:    \"The motion is out of order. By a special provision of our constitution  it is the inalienable right of all unmarried women to be under  twenty-five. We will be as careful in our language as the subject will  permit. Mrs. Warner will please read the words of Mrs. Flint.\"    I was shocked to think I had made such a mistake. Sarah rose and read in  a clear, sharp voice from the clipping:    \"Should not we as women take some action against this man? People of  such character should not be allowed in this country. Of course when he  arrived it was not known how he was living, but he came here and  expected to be received; and I think he should be deported. Gorky is the  embodiment of Socialism.\"    Everybody applauded violently. I was puzzled and asked a question as  soon as I could make myself heard.    \"Suppose Gorky is a Socialist,\" I said; \"what has that to do with his  morals?\"    \"Everything,\" replied Mrs. Blanderocks, haughtily.    \"Socialists don't believe in marriage,\" said Sarah Warner, taking  another clipping from her pocket-book and reading: \"'Mrs. Cornelia  Robinson said: When the question of uniform divorce law is taken up, we  shall find that the Socialists are against it as a body. It is not that  they are opposed to divorce, but they do not believe in marriage.'\"    \"And does she know?\" I asked.    \"Would she say it publicly if it were not true?\" demanded Mrs.  Blanderocks, glaring disapprovingly at me.    I rose to my feet. I will say for myself that my desire for knowledge is  greater even than my shyness, and usually overcomes it.    \"I want to make a motion,\" I said, \"that this man Gorky be deported--\"  (loud applause)--\"but before doing so I would like some one to explain  in as plain words as the nature of the subject will permit, just what he  has been guilty of.\" Dead silence broken by a voice saying: \"He's a  foreigner.\"    \"I'll tell you what he has done,\""]]]
