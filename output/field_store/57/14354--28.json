I'm not sure about the story being true, but I know the  moral is. Why, it's nearly tea-time. Come along, children, and get your  tea.\"    So they all crept quietly away to catch the necessary mice, and the  youngest was so afraid of being too clever by half, that she would never  have caught a mouse at all, if her mother had not boxed her  ears--softly, as mother cats do; you know how I mean!          The White Persian      I WAS a handsome, discreet, middle-aged, respectable, responsible,  domesticated tabby cat. I was humble. I knew my place, and kept it. My  place was the place nearest the fire in winter, or close to the sunny  window in summer. There was nothing to trouble me--not so much as a fly  in the cream, or an error in the leaving of the cat's meat, until some  thoughtless person gave my master the white Persian cat.    She was very beautiful in her soft, foolish, namby-pamby, blue-eyed  way. Of course, she did not understand English, and when they called  \"Puss, puss,\" she only ran under the sofa, for she thought they were  teasing her. She was mistress only of two languages--Persian and  cat-talk.    My master did not think of this. He called her \"Puss\"; he called her  \"Pussy\"; he called her \"Tittums\" and \"Pussy then\"; and a thousand  endearments that had formerly been lavished on me were vainly showered  on this unresponsive stranger. But when he found she was cold to all of  them, my master sighed.    \"Poor thing!\" he said; \"she is deaf.\"    I sat by the bright fender, and washed my face, and sleeked my pretty  paws, and looked on. My master gave up taking very much notice of the  new cat. But I had a fear that he might learn Persian or cat-talk, and  make friends with her; so I resolved that the best thing for me would be  a complete change in the Persian's behaviour--such a change as should  make it impossible for her ever to be friends with him again; so I said  to her:    \"You wonder that our master looks coldly at you. Perhaps you don't know  that in England a white cat is supposed to mew twenty times longer and  to purr twenty times louder than a cat of any other colour?\"    \"Oh, thank you so much for telling me,\" she said gratefully. \"I didn't  know. As it happens, I have a very good voice.\"    And the next time she wanted her milk, she mewed in a voice you could  have heard twenty miles away. Poor master was so astonished that he  nearly dropped the saucer. When she had finished the milk, she jumped  upon his knee, and he began to stroke her. She nearly gave herself a  fit in her efforts to purr loud enough to please him. At first he was  pleased, but when the purring got louder and louder, the poor man put  his hands to his ears and said, \"Oh dear! oh dear! this is worse than a  whole hive of bees.\"    Still he put her down gently, and I congratulated her on having done so  well. She did better. She was an affectionate person, though foolish,  and in her anxiety to do what was expected of a cat of her colour in  England, she practised day and night.    Her purr was already the loudest I have heard from any cat, but she  fancied she could improve her mewing; and she mewed in the garden, she  mewed in the house, she mewed at meals, she mewed at prayers, she mewed  when she was hungry to show that she wanted food, and she mewed when  she had had it to show her gratitude.    \"Poor thing,\" said the master to a friend who had come to see him, \"she  is so deaf she can't hear the noise she makes.\"    Of course, I understood what he said, but she hadn't yet picked up a  word of English; and if the master _had_ begun to learn Persian, I don't  suppose he had got much beyond the alphabet.    The Persian's mew was rather feebler that day, because she had a cold.    \"I don't think it's so bad,\" said his friend. \"If you really wanted to  get rid of her, she is very handsome; she would take a prize anywhere.\"    \"She is yours,\" said the master instantly; and the strange gentleman  took her away in a basket.    That evening it was I who sat on my master's knee--I who superintended  the writing of his letters on the green-covered writing table--I who  had all the milk that was left over from his tea.    In a few days he had a letter. I read it when he laid it down; and if  you don't believe cats can read, I can only say that it is just as easy  to read a letter like the master's as it is to write a story like this.  The letter begged my master to take back the fair Persian.    \"Her howls,\" the letter went on, \"become worse and worse. The poor  creature is, as you say, too deaf to be tolerated.\"    My master wrote back instantly to say that he would rather be condemned  to keep a dog than have the fair Persian within his doors again.    Then by return of post came a pitiful letter, begging for help and  mercy, and the friend came again to tea. I trembled lest my foreign  rival should come back to live with me. But she didn't. The next morning  my master took me on his knee, and, stroking me gently, said--    \"Ah, Tabbykins! no more Persians for us. I have sent her to my deaf  aunt. She will be delighted with her--a most handsome present--and as  they are both deaf, the fair Persian's shrieks will hurt nobody.    \"But I will have no more prize cats,\" he said, pouring out some cream  for me in his own saucer. \"You know how to behave; I will never have any  cat but you.\"    I do, and he never has.          A Powerful Friend      MY mother was the best of cats. She washed us kittens all over every  morning, and at odd times during the day she would wash little bits of  us, say an ear, or a paw, or a tail-tip, and she was very anxious about  our education. I am afraid I gave her a great deal of trouble, for I was  rather stout and heavy, and did not take a very active or graceful part  in the exercises which she thought good for us.    Our gymnasium was the kitchen hearth-rug. There was always a good fire  in the grate, and it seemed to me so much better to go to sleep in  front of it than to run round after my own tail, or even my mother's,  though, of course, that was a great honour.    As for running after the reel of cotton when the cook dropped it, or  playing with the tassel of the blind-cord, or pretending that there were  mice inside the paper bag which I knew to be empty, I confess that I had  no heart or imagination for these diversions.    \"Of course, you know best, mother,\" I used to say; \"but it does seem to  me a dreadful waste of time. We might be much better employed.\"    \"How better employed?\" asked my mother severely.    \"Why,\" I answered, \"in eating or sleeping.\"    At first my mother used to box my ears, and insist on my learning such  little accomplishments as she thought necessary for my station in life.    \"You see,\" she would say, \"all this playing with tails and reels and  balls of worsted is a preparation for the real business of life.\"    \"What is that?\" asked my sister.    \"Mouse-catching,\" said my mother very earnestly.    \"There are no mice here,\" I said, stretching myself.    \"No, but you will not always be here; and if you practise the little  tricks I show you now with the ball of worsted and the tips of our  tails, then, when the great hour comes, and a career is open to you, and  you see before you the glorious prize--the MOUSE--you will be quick  enough and clever enough to satisfy the highest needs of your nature.\"    \"And supposing we don't play with our tails and the balls of worsted?\" I  said.    \"Then,\" said my mother bitterly, \"you may as well lie down for the mice  to, run over you.\"    Thus at first she used to try to show me how foolish it was to think of  nothing but eating and sleeping; but after a while she turned all her  attention to teaching my brother and sister, and they were apt pupils.  They despised nothing small enough to be moved by their paws, which  could give them an opportunity of practising. They did not mind making  themselves ridiculous--a thing which has been always impossible with me.  I have seen Tabby, my sister, in the garden, playing with dead leaves,  as excited and pleased as though they had been the birds which she  foolishly pretended that they were.    I thought her very silly then, but I lived to wish that I had taken half  as much trouble with my lessons as she did with hers. My mother was very  pleased with her, especially after she caught the starlings. This was a  piece of cleverness which my sister invented and carried through  entirely out of her own head. She made friends with one of the cows at  the farm near us, and used to go into the cowhouse and jump on the cow's  back. Then when the cow was sent out into the field to get her grassy  breakfast, my sister used to go with her, riding on her back.    Now birds are always very much on the look-out for cats, and, if they  can help it, never allow one of us to come within half-a-dozen yards of  them without taking to those silly wings of theirs. I never could see  why birds should have wings--so unnecessary.    But birds are not afraid of cows,"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/27238"],[0,"Woodworking Tools 1600-1900 (#2)"],[1,"of the difference. The  joiner's axe was light and short handled with the left side of the  cutting edge bezeled to accommodate one-handed use. The carpenter's axe,  on the other hand, was intended \"to hew great Stuff\" and was made deeper  and heavier to facilitate the squaring and beveling of timbers.[3] By  mid-18th century the craft of joiner and carpenter had been completely  rationalized in Diderot's _Encyclopedie_ and by Andre Roubo in his  _L'Art du menuisier_, a part of Duhamel's _Descriptions des arts et  metiers_. Diderot, for example, illustrates 14 bench planes alone,  generally used by the joiner (fig. 5), while Roubo suggests the steady  sophistication of the art in a plate showing the special planes and  irons required for fine molding and paneling (fig. 6).    [Illustration: Figure 5.--1769: THE BENCH PLANES OF THE JOINER increased  in number, but in appearance they remained much the same as those  illustrated by Moxon. (Denis Diderot, _Recueil de planches sur les  science et les arts liberaux_, Paris, 1769, vol. 7, \"Menuiserie.\"  Smithsonian photo 56630.)]    Despite such thoroughness, without the addition of the several plates it  would be almost impossible to visualize, through the descriptive text  alone, the work of the carpenter and joiner except, of course, in modern  terms. This is particularly true of the numerous texts on building, such  as Batty Langley's _The Builder's Complete Assistant_ (1738) and Francis  Price's _The British Carpenter_ (1765), where building techniques are  well described but illustration of tools is omitted. This inadequacy  grows. In two 19th-century American editions of British works, _The Book  of Trades_, printed at Philadelphia in 1807, and Hazen's _Panorama of  the Professions and Trades_ (1838), the descriptions of the carpenter's  trade are extremely elementary.    Thomas Martin's _Circle of the Mechanical Arts_ (1813), although far  more thorough than many texts, still defined carpentry \"as the art of  cutting out, framing, and joining large pieces of wood, to be used in  building\" and joinery as \"small work\" or what \"is called by the French,  _menuiserie_.\" Martin enumerated 16 tools most useful to the carpenter  and 21 commonly used by the joiner; in summary, he noted, as had Moxon,  that \"both these arts are subservient to architecture, being employed in  raising, roofing, flooring and ornamenting buildings of all kinds\" (fig.  7).[4]    In Peter Nicholson's _The Mechanic's Companion_ (figs. 8, 9, and 10),  the all-too-familiar definition of carpentry as \"the art of employing  timber in the construction of buildings\" suggests very little of the  carpenter's actual work or the improvement in tool design that had  occurred since Moxon's _Exercises_. From Nicholson's list of the tools  required by the carpenter--\"a ripping saw, a hand saw, an axe, an adze,  a socket chisel, a firmer chisel, a ripping chisel, an auguer, a gimlet,  a hammer, a mallet, a pair of pincers, and sometimes planes\"--there  would seem at first glance slight advance since the 1600's. The  enumeration of the joiner's tools, however, indicates a considerable  proliferation, particularly when compared to earlier writers. By the  early 19th century, the more refined work of joinery required over 50  tools.         The bench planes [instructed Nicholson] are, the jack plane, the       fore plane, the trying plane, the long plane, the jointer, and the       smoothing plane; the cylindric plane, the compass and forkstaff       planes; the straight block, for straightening short edges. Rebating       planes are the moving fillister, the sash fillister, the common       rebating plane, the side rebating plane. Grooving planes are the       plough and dado grooving planes. Moulding planes are sinking       snipebills, side snipebills, beads, hollows and rounds, ovolos and       ogees. Boring tools are: gimlets, bradawls, stock, and bits.       Instruments for dividing the wood, are principally the ripping saw,       the half ripper, the hand saw, the panel saw, the tenon saw, the       carcase saw, the sash saw, the compass saw, the keyhole saw, and       turning saw. Tools used for forming the angles of two adjoining       surfaces, are squares and bevels. Tools used for drawing parallel       lines are gauges. Edge tools are the firmer chisel, the mortise       chisel, the socket chisel, the gouge, the hatchet, the adze, the       drawing knife. Tools for knocking upon wood and iron are, the       mallet and hammer. Implements for sharpening tools are the grinding       stone, the rub stone, and the oil or whet stone.[5]    Reflecting what the text writers listed, toolmakers by the end of the  18th century gave buyers a wide choice. The catalogue of Sheffield's  Castle Hill Works offered 20 combinations of ready-stocked tool chests;  the simplest contained 12 carpenter's tools and the most complex, 39,  plus, if desired, an additional assortment of gardening implements (fig.  11). In 1857, the Arrowmammett Works of Middletown, Connecticut,  producers of bench and molding planes, published an illustrated  catalogue that offered 34 distinct types that included everything from  hollows and rounds to double jointers and hand-rail planes (fig.  12).[6]    [Illustration: Figure 6.--1774: ANDRE ROUBO'S _L'Art du menuisier_  contains detailed plates and descriptions of the most specialized of  woodworking planes: those used to cut panel moldings. The conformation  of these tools was still distinctly in keeping with the Moxon type and  suggests that, at least in Europe, no remarkable change had yet occurred  in the shape of planes. (Andre-Jacob Roubo, _L'Art du menuisier_:  Troisieme partie, troisieme section, l'art du menuisier ebeniste [Paris,  1774]. Smithsonian photo 49790-D.)]    [Illustration: Figure 7.--1813: THOMAS MARTIN ILLUSTRATED ON ONE PLATE  the tools of the carpenter and joiner dividing them as follows: the  tools most useful to the carpenter, the axe (7), adz (6), saw (24),  socket chisel (13), firmer chisel (5), auger (1), gimlet (3), gauge  (16), square (9), compass (36), hammer (21), mallet (22), hookpin (11),  crow (12), plumb rule (18), and level (19); and the tools most often  associated with joinery, the jack plane (30), trying plane (31),  smoothing plane (34), tenon saw (25), compass saw (26), keyhole saw  (27), square (8), bevel (23), gauge (17), mortise chisel (4), gouge  (14), turnscrew (15), plow plane (29), molding plane (35), pincers (37),  bradawl (10), stock and bit (2), sidehook (20), workbench (28), and rule  (38). The planes are of particular interest since they show clearly a  change in form from those previously illustrated. (Thomas Martin, _The  Circle of the Mechanical Arts_, London, 1813.)]    [Illustration: Figure 8.--1832: PETER NICHOLSON ILLUSTRATED an  interesting mixture of old and new forms. An updating of Moxon,  Nicholson's carpenter required an axe (1), adz (2), socket chisel (3),  mortise and tenon gauge (4), square (5), plumb rule (6), level (7),  auger (8), hookpin (9), and crow (10). (Peter Nicholson, _The Mechanic's  Companion_. 1st American ed., Philadelphia, 1832. Smithsonian photo  56633.)]    [Illustration: Figure 9.--1832: THE WORKBENCH DELINEATED BY NICHOLSON  was little improved over Moxon's, although the planes--jack (1), trying  plane (2), smoothing plane (3), sash fillister (7), and plow  (8)--followed the form seen in Martin (fig. 7). The inception of this  shape occurred in the shops of Sheffield toolmakers in the last half of  the 18th century, and it persisted until replaced by metallic versions  patented by American innovators during the last quarter of the 19th  century. (Nicholson, _The Mechanic's Companion_. Smithsonian photo  56631.)]    [Illustration: Figure 10.--1832: THE BRACE AND BIT, GIMLET, CHISELS, AND  SAWS, having achieved a standard form distinctly different than those of  Moxon's vintage, were, like the plane, slow to change. The metallic  version of the brace did not replace the standard Sheffield type (1) in  the United States until after 1850. For all intent and purpose the saw  still retains the characteristics illustrated in Nicholson. Of interest  is Nicholson's comment regarding the saws; namely, that the double  handle was peculiar to the hand (6) and tenon saws (7), while the  compass (9) and the sash saws (8) had the single handle. In addition the  tenon saw was generally backed in iron and the sash saw in brass.  (Nicholson, _The Mechanic's Companion_. Smithsonian photo 56632.)]    [Illustration: Figure 11.--EARLY 19TH CENTURY: THE ADVERTISEMENTS OF  TOOLMAKERS indicated the diversity of production. The Castle Hill Works  at Sheffield offered to gentlemen 20 choices of tool chests designed to  appeal to a wide variety of users and purses. The chest was available in  either oak or mahogany, depending on the gentleman's tastes (fig. 49).  (Book 87, Cutler and Company, Castle Hill Works, Sheffield. _Courtesy of  the Victoria and Albert Museum_.)]    [Illustration: Figure 12.--1857: THE DIVERSITY OF TOOLS available to  buyers made necessary the illustrated trade catalogue. Although few in  number in the United States before 1850, tool catalogues became  voluminous in the last half of the century as printing costs dropped.  (Smithsonian Institution Library. Smithsonian photo 49790.)]    American inventories reflect the great increase suggested by the early  technical writers and trade catalogues cited above. Compare the content  of two American carpenters' shops--one of 1709, in York County,  Virginia, and the other of 1827, in Middleborough, Massachusetts. John  Crost, a Virginian, owned, in addition to sundry shoemaking and  agricultural implements, a dozen gimlets, chalklines, bung augers, a  dozen turning tools and mortising chisels, several dozen planes (ogees,  hollows and rounds, and plows), several augers, a pair of 2-foot rules,  a spoke shave, lathing hammers, a lock saw, three files,"]]]
