Slaves were found to be profitably employed in  clearing away the forests; they were not profitably employed in general  agriculture. A marked exception was found in small districts in the  Carolinas and Georgia where indigo and rice were produced; and though  cotton later became a profitable crop for slave labor, it was the  producers of rice and indigo who furnished the original barrier to the  immediate extension of the policy of emancipation. Representatives from  their States secured the introduction of a clause into the Constitution  which delayed for twenty years the execution of the will of the country  against the African slave-trade. It is said that a slave imported from  Africa paid for himself in a single year in the production of rice.  There were thus a few planters in Georgia and the Carolinas who had an  obvious interest in the prolongation of the institution of slavery and  who had influence enough, to secure constitutional recognition for both  slavery and the slave-trade.    The principles involved were not seriously debated. In theory all were  abolitionists; in practice slavery extended to all the States. In some,  actual abolition was comparatively easy; in others, it was difficult. By  the end of the first quarter of the nineteenth century, actual abolition  had extended to the line separating Pennsylvania from Maryland. Of the  original thirteen States seven became free and six remained slave.    The absence of ardent or prolonged debate upon this issue in the early  history of the United States is easily accounted for. No principle  of importance was drawn into the controversy; few presumed to defend  slavery as a just or righteous institution. As to conduct, each  individual, each neighborhood enjoyed the freedom of a large, roomy  country. Even within state lines there was liberty enough. No keen sense  of responsibility for a uniform state policy existed. It was therefore  not difficult for those who were growing wealthy by the use of imported  negroes to maintain their privileges in the State.    If the sense of active responsibility was wanting within the separate  States, much more was this true of the citizens of different States.  Slavery was regarded as strictly a domestic institution. Families bought  and owned slaves as a matter of individual preference. None of the  original colonies or States adopted slavery by law. The citizens of the  various colonies became slaveholders simply because there was no law  against it. * The abolition of slavery was at first an individual matter  or a church or a state policy. When the Constitution was formulated, the  separate States had been accustomed to regard themselves as possessed  of sovereign powers; hence there was no occasion for the citizens of  one State to have a sense of responsibility on account of the  domestic institutions of other States. The consciousness of national  responsibility was of slow growth, and the conditions did not then  exist which favored a general crusade against slavery or a prolonged  acrimonious debate on the subject, such as arose forty years later.         * In the case of Georgia there was a prohibitory law, which       was disregarded.    In many of the States, however, there were organized abolition  societies, whose object was to promote the cause of emancipation already  in progress and to protect the rights of free negroes. The Friends, or  Quakers, were especially active in the promotion of a propaganda for  universal emancipation. A petition which was presented to the first  Congress in February, 1790, with the signature of Benjamin Franklin  as President of the Pennsylvania Abolition Society, contained this  concluding paragraph:    \"From a persuasion that equal liberty was originally, and is still, the  birthright of all men, and influenced by the strong ties of humanity  and the principles of their institutions, your memorialists conceive  themselves bound to use all justifiable endeavors to loosen the bonds  of slavery, and to promote the general enjoyment of the blessings of  freedom. Under these impressions they earnestly entreat your attention  to the subject of slavery; that you will be pleased to countenance the  restoration to liberty of those unhappy men, who, alone, in this land of  freemen, are groaning in servile subjection; that you will devise means  for removing this inconsistency of character from the American people;  that you will promote mercy and justice towards this distressed race;  and that you will step to the very verge of the power vested in you for  discouraging every species of traffic in the persons of our fellowmen.\"  *         * William Goodell, \"Slavery and Anti-Slavery,\" p. 99.    The memorialists were treated with profound respect. Cordial support and  encouragement came from representatives from Virginia and other slave  States. Opposition was expressed by members from South Carolina and  Georgia. These for the most part relied upon their constitutional  guaranties. But for these guaranties, said Smith, of South Carolina,  his State would not have entered the Union. In the extreme utterances in  opposition to the petition there is a suggestion of the revolution which  was to occur forty years later.    Active abolitionists who gave time and money to the promotion of the  cause were always few in numbers. Previous to 1830 abolition societies  resembled associations for the prevention of cruelty to animals--in  fact, in one instance at least this was made one of the professed  objects. These societies labored to induce men to act in harmony  with generally acknowledged obligations, and they had no occasion for  violence or persecution. Abolitionists were distinguished for their  benevolence and their unselfish devotion to the interests of the needy  and the unfortunate. It was only when the ruling classes resorted to mob  violence and began to defend slavery as a divinely ordained institution  that there was a radical change in the spirit of the controversy. The  irrepressible conflict between liberty and despotism which has persisted  in all ages became manifest when slave-masters substituted the Greek  doctrine of inequality and slavery for the previously accepted Christian  doctrine of equality and universal brotherhood.        CHAPTER II. THE GEOGRAPHY OF THE CRUSADE    It was a mere accident that the line drawn by Mason and Dixon between  Pennsylvania and Maryland became known in later years as the dividing  line between slavery and freedom. The six States south of that line  ultimately neglected or refused to abolish slavery, while the seven  Northern States became free. Vermont became a State in 1791 and Kentucky  in 1792. The third State to be added to the original thirteen was  Tennessee in 1796. At that time, counting the States as they were  finally classified, eight were destined to be slave and eight free. Ohio  entered the Union as a State in 1802, thus giving to the free States  a majority of one. The balance, however, was restored in 1812 by the  admission of Louisiana as a slave State. The admission of Indiana in  1816 on the one side and of Mississippi in 1817 on the other still  maintained the balance: ten free States stood against ten slave States.  During the next two years Illinois and Alabama were admitted, making  twenty-two States in all, still evenly divided.    The ordinance for the government of the territory north of the Ohio  River, passed in 1787 and reenacted by Congress after the adoption  of the Constitution, proved to be an act of great significance in its  relation to the limitation of slavery. By this ordinance slavery was  forever prohibited in the Northwest Territory. In the territory south  of the Ohio River slavery became permanently established. The river,  therefore, became an extension of the original Mason and Dixon's Line  with the new meaning attached: it became a division between free and  slave territory.    It was apparently at first a mere matter of chance that a balance was  struck between the two losses of States. While Virginia remained a slave  State, it was natural that slavery should extend into Kentucky, which  had been a part of Virginia. Likewise Tennessee, being a part of North  Carolina, became slave territory. When these two Territories became  slave States, the equal division began. There was yet an abundance of  territory both north and south to be taken into the Union and, without  any special plan or agitation, States were admitted in pairs, one free  and the other slave. In the meantime there was distinctly developed the  idea of the possible or probable permanence of slavery in the South and  of a rivalry or even a future conflict between the two sections.    When in 1819 Missouri applied for admission to the Union with a state  constitution permitting slavery, there was a prolonged debate over the  whole question, not only in Congress but throughout the entire country.  North and South were distinctly pitted against each other with rival  systems of labor. The following year Congress passed a law providing  for the admission of Missouri, but, to restore the balance, Maine was  separated from Massachusetts and was admitted to the Union as a State.  It was further enacted that slavery should be forever prohibited from  all territory of the United States north of the parallel 36 degrees 30',  that is, north of the southern boundary of Missouri. It is this part of  the act which is known as the Missouri Compromise. It was accepted as  a permanent limitation of the institution of slavery. By this act Mason  and Dixon's Line was extended through the Louisiana Purchase. As the  western boundary was then defined, slavery could still be extended into  Arkansas and into a part of what is now Oklahoma, while a great empire  to the northwest was reserved for the formation of free States. Arkansas  became a slave State in 1836 and"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/30396"],[0,"Books and Authors (#2)"],[1,"146  Quid pro Quo, Turner's                                            51  Reconciling the Fathers                                           27  Regality of Genius                                                77  Repartee, A Smart                                                 52  Rival Remembrance--Gilford and Hazlitt                            88  Romilly and Brougham                                              45  Sale, the Translator of the Koran                                133  Shenstone, An Odd Present to                                     156  Sheridans, The Two                                               141  Sheridan's Careful Study of his Wit                               23  Silence no sure Sign of Wisdom                                    44  Smith, James, one of the Authors of the \"Rejected Addresses\"  60, 80  Smollett's Hard Fortunes                                         154  Smollett's History of England                                     24  Smollett's \"Hugh Strap\"                                           13  Snail Dinner, the                                                106  Southey's Wife                                                    73  Stammering Witticism, Lamb's                                      49  Sterne's Sermons                                                  85  Swift's Disappointed Life                                         18  Swift's Three Loves                                               31  Thomson's Indolence                                              148  Thomson's Recitation of his Poetry                                42  \"Times\" Newspaper, Writing up the                                114  \"Tom Cringle's Log,\" Authorship of                                68  Tom Hill                                                          85  Trimmer, Mrs.                                                    117  Tycho Brahe's Nose                                                87  Voltairean Relics at Ferney, Sale of                              79  Waller, the Courtier-Poet                                        156  Walton, Izaak, Relics of                                          82  Washington Irving and Wilkie at the Alhambra                     111  \"Waverley,\" the Authorship of                                     51  Way to Win them, Walpole's                                        96  Wycherley's Wooing                                               146          NOTE.      This collection of anecdotes, illustrative sketches, and _memorabilia_  generally, relating to the ever fresh and interesting subject of BOOKS  AND AUTHORS, is not presented as complete, nor even as containing all  the choice material of its kind. The field from which one may gather is  so wide and fertile, that any collection warranting such a claim would  far exceed the compass of many volumes, much less of this little book.  It has been sought to offer, in an acceptable and convenient form, some  of the more remarkable or interesting literary facts or incidents with  which one individual, in a somewhat extended reading, has been struck;  some of the passages which he has admired; some of the anecdotes and  jests that have amused him and may amuse others; some of the reminiscences  that it has most pleased him to dwell upon. For no very great portion of  the contents of this volume, is the claim to originality of subject-matter  advanced. The collection, however, is submitted with some confidence  that it may be found as interesting, as accurate, and as much guided by  good taste, as it has been endeavoured to make it.          BOOKS AND AUTHORS.    _CURIOUS FACTS AND CHARACTERISTIC SKETCHES._          THE FINDING OF JOHN EVELYN'S MS. DIARY AT WOTTON.[1]    The MS. Diary, or \"Kalendarium,\" of the celebrated John Evelyn lay among  the family papers at Wotton, in Surrey, from the period of his death, in  1706, until their rare interest and value were discovered in the following  singular manner.    The library at Wotton is rich in curious books, with notes in John  Evelyn's handwriting, as well as papers on various subjects, and  transcripts of letters by the philosopher, who appears never to have  employed an amanuensis. The arrangement of these treasures was,  many years since, entrusted to the late Mr. Upcott, of the London  Institution, who made a complete catalogue of the collection.    One afternoon, as Lady Evelyn and a female companion were seated in  one of the fine old apartments of Wotton, making feather tippets,  her ladyship pleasantly observed to Mr. Upcott, \"You may think this  feather-work a strange way of passing time: it is, however, my hobby;  and I dare say you, too, Mr. Upcott, have _your hobby_.\" The librarian  replied that his favourite pursuit was the collection of the autographs  of eminent persons. Lady Evelyn remarked, that in all probability the  MSS. of \"_Sylva_\" Evelyn would afford Mr. Upcott some amusement. His  reply may be well imagined. The bell was rung, and a servant desired to  bring the papers from a lumber-room of the old mansion; and from one of  the baskets so produced was brought to light the manuscript Diary of  John Evelyn--one of the most finished specimens of autobiography in the  whole compass of English literature.    The publication of the Diary, with a selection of familiar letters, and  private correspondence, was entrusted to Mr. William Bray, F.S.A.; and  the last sheets of the MS., with a dedication to Lady Evelyn, were  actually in the hands of the printer at the hour of her death. The work  appeared in 1818; and a volume of Miscellaneous Papers, by Evelyn, was  subsequently published, under Mr. Upcott's editorial superintendence.    Wotton House, though situate in the angle of two valleys, is actually on  part of Leith Hill, the rise from thence being very gradual. Evelyn's  \"Diary\" contains a pen-and-ink sketch of the mansion as it appeared in  1653.     [1] See the Frontispiece.           *       *       *       *       *      FAMILIES OF LITERARY MEN.    A _Quarterly_ Reviewer, in discussing an objection to the Copyright Bill  of Mr. Sergeant Talfourd, which was taken by Sir Edward Sugden, gives  some curious particulars of the progeny of literary men. \"We are not,\"  says the writer, \"going to speculate about the causes of the fact; but a  fact it is, that men distinguished for extraordinary intellectual power  of any sort rarely leave more than a very brief line of progeny behind  them. Men of genius have scarcely ever done so; men of imaginative  genius, we might say, almost never. With the one exception of the noble  Surrey, we cannot, at this moment, point out a representative in the  male line, even so far down as the third generation, of any English  poet; and we believe the case is the same in France. The blood of beings  of that order can seldom be traced far down, even in the female line.  With the exception of Surrey and Spenser, we are not aware of any great  English author of at all remote date, from whose body any living person  claims to be descended. There is no real English poet prior to the middle  of the eighteenth century; and we believe no great author of any sort,  except Clarendon and Shaftesbury, of whose blood we have any inheritance  amongst us. Chaucer's only son died childless; Shakspeare's line expired  in his daughter's only daughter. None of the other dramatists of that  age left any progeny; nor Raleigh, nor Bacon, nor Cowley, nor Butler.  The grand-daughter of Milton was the last of his blood. Newton, Locke,  Pope, Swift, Arbuthnot, Hume, Gibbon, Cowper, Gray, Walpole, Cavendish  (and we might greatly extend the list), never married. Neither  Bolingbroke, nor Addison, nor Warburton, nor Johnson, nor Burke,  transmitted their blood. One of the arguments against a _perpetuity_  in literary property is, that it would be founding another _noblesse_.  Neither jealous aristocracy nor envious Jacobinism need be under such  alarm. When a human race has produced its 'bright, consummate flower'  in this kind, it seems commonly to be near its end.\"           *       *       *       *       *      THE BLUE-STOCKING CLUB.    Towards the close of the last century, there met at Mrs. Montague's a  literary assembly, called \"The Blue-Stocking Club,\" in consequence of  one of the most admired of the members, Mr. Benjamin Stillingfleet,  always wearing _blue stockings_. The appellation soon became general as  a name for pedantic or ridiculous literary ladies. Hannah More wrote a  volume in verse, entitled _The Bas Bleu: or Conversation_. It proceeds  on the mistake of a foreigner, who, hearing of the Blue-Stocking Club,  translated it literally _Bas Bleu_. Johnson styled this poem \"a great  performance.\" The following couplets have been quoted, and remembered,  as terse and pointed:--     \"In men this blunder still you find,    All think their little set mankind.\"     \"Small habits well pursued betimes,    May reach the dignity of crimes.\"           *       *       *       *       *      DR. JOHNSON AND HANNAH MORE    When Hannah More came to London in 1773, or 1774, she was domesticated  with Garrick, and was received with favour by Johnson, Reynolds, and  Burke. Her sister has thus described her first interview with Johnson:--    \"We have paid another visit to Miss Reynolds; she had sent to engage Dr.  Percy, ('Percy's Collection,' now you know him), quite a sprightly modern,  instead of a rusty antique, as I expected: he was no sooner gone than the  most amiable and obliging of women, Miss Reynolds, ordered the coach to  take us to Dr. Johnson's very own house: yes, Abyssinian Johnson!  Dictionary Johnson! Ramblers, Idlers, and Irene Johnson! Can you picture  to yourselves the palpitation of our hearts as we approached his mansion?  The conversation turned upon a new work of his just going to the press  (the 'Tour to the Hebrides'), and his old friend"]]]
