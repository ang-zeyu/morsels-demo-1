Science, too, might have inspired  the famous saying to which Plato alludes: \"You cannot step twice into  the same rivers; for fresh waters are ever flowing in upon you.\" But  we find also another statement among the extant fragments: \"We step  and do not step into the same rivers; we are and are not.\"    The comparison of this statement, which is mystical, with the one  quoted by Plato, which is scientific, shows how intimately the two  tendencies are blended in the system of Heraclitus. Mysticism is, in  essence, little more than a certain intensity and depth of feeling in  regard to what is believed about the universe; and this kind of  feeling leads Heraclitus, on the basis of his science, to strangely  poignant sayings concerning life and the world, such as:    \"Time is a child playing draughts, the kingly power is a child's.\"    It is poetic imagination, not science, which presents Time as despotic  lord of the world, with all the irresponsible frivolity of a child. It  is mysticism, too, which leads Heraclitus to assert the identity of  opposites: \"Good and ill are one,\" he says; and again: \"To God all  things are fair and good and right, but men hold some things wrong and  some right.\"    Much of mysticism underlies the ethics of Heraclitus. It is true that  a scientific determinism alone might have inspired the statement:  \"Man's character is his fate\"; but only a mystic would have said:    \"Every beast is driven to the pasture with blows\"; and again:    \"It is hard to fight with one's heart's desire. Whatever it wishes to  get, it purchases at the cost of soul\"; and again:    \"Wisdom is one thing. It is to know the thought by which all things  are steered through all things.\"[1]    Examples might be multiplied, but those that have been given are  enough to show the character of the man: the facts of science, as they  appeared to him, fed the flame in his soul, and in its light he saw  into the depths of the world by the reflection of his own dancing  swiftly penetrating fire. In such a nature we see the true union of  the mystic and the man of science--the highest eminence, as I think,  that it is possible to achieve in the world of thought.    In Plato, the same twofold impulse exists, though the mystic impulse  is distinctly the stronger of the two, and secures ultimate victory  whenever the conflict is sharp. His description of the cave is the  classical statement of belief in a knowledge and reality truer and  more real than that of the senses:      \"Imagine[2] a number of men living in an underground cavernous    chamber, with an entrance open to the light, extending along the    entire length of the cavern, in which they have been confined, from    their childhood, with their legs and necks so shackled that they    are obliged to sit still and look straight forwards, because their    chains render it impossible for them to turn their heads round: and    imagine a bright fire burning some way off, above and behind them,    and an elevated roadway passing between the fire and the prisoners,    with a low wall built along it, like the screens which conjurors    put up in front of their audience, and above which they exhibit    their wonders.      I have it, he replied.      Also figure to yourself a number of persons walking behind this    wall, and carrying with them statues of men, and images of other    animals, wrought in wood and stone and all kinds of materials,    together with various other articles, which overtop the wall; and,    as you might expect, let some of the passers-by be talking, and    others silent.      You are describing a strange scene, and strange prisoners.      They resemble us, I replied.      Now consider what would happen if the course of nature brought them    a release from their fetters, and a remedy for their foolishness,    in the following manner. Let us suppose that one of them has been    released, and compelled suddenly to stand up, and turn his neck    round and walk with open eyes towards the light; and let us suppose    that he goes through all these actions with pain, and that the    dazzling splendour renders him incapable of discerning those    objects of which he used formerly to see the shadows. What answer    should you expect him to make, if some one were to tell him that in    those days he was watching foolish phantoms, but that now he is    somewhat nearer to reality, and is turned towards things more real,    and sees more correctly; above all, if he were to point out to him    the several objects that are passing by, and question him, and    compel him to answer what they are? Should you not expect him to be    puzzled, and to regard his old visions as truer than the objects    now forced upon his notice?      Yes, much truer....      Hence, I suppose, habit will be necessary to enable him to perceive    objects in that upper world. At first he will be most successful in    distinguishing shadows; then he will discern the reflections of men    and other things in water, and afterwards the realities; and after    this he will raise his eyes to encounter the light of the moon and    stars, finding it less difficult to study the heavenly bodies and    the heaven itself by night, than the sun and the sun's light by    day.      Doubtless.      Last of all, I imagine, he will be able to observe and contemplate    the nature of the sun, not as it _appears_ in water or on alien    ground, but as it is in itself in its own territory.      Of course.      His next step will be to draw the conclusion, that the sun is the    author of the seasons and the years, and the guardian of all things    in the visible world, and in a manner the cause of all those things    which he and his companions used to see.      Obviously, this will be his next step....      Now this imaginary case, my dear Glancon, you must apply in all its    parts to our former statements, by comparing the region which the    eye reveals to the prison house, and the light of the fire therein    to the power of the sun: and if, by the upward ascent and the    contemplation of the upper world, you understand the mounting of    the soul into the intellectual region, you will hit the tendency of    my own surmises, since you desire to be told what they are; though,    indeed, God only knows whether they are correct. But, be that as it    may, the view which I take of the subject is to the following    effect. In the world of knowledge, the essential Form of Good is    the limit of our enquiries, and can barely be perceived; but, when    perceived, we cannot help concluding that it is in every case the    source of all that is bright and beautiful,--in the visible world    giving birth to light and its master, and in the intellectual world    dispensing, immediately and with full authority, truth and    reason;--and that whosoever would act wisely, either in private or    in public, must set this Form of Good before his eyes.\"    But in this passage, as throughout most of Plato's teaching, there is  an identification of the good with the truly real, which became  embodied in the philosophical tradition, and is still largely  operative in our own day. In thus allowing a legislative function to  the good, Plato produced a divorce between philosophy and science,  from which, in my opinion, both have suffered ever since and are still  suffering. The man of science, whatever his hopes may be, must lay  them aside while he studies nature; and the philosopher, if he is to  achieve truth, must do the same. Ethical considerations can only  legitimately appear when the truth has been ascertained: they can and  should appear as determining our feeling towards the truth, and our  manner of ordering our lives in view of the truth, but not as  themselves dictating what the truth is to be.    There are passages in Plato--among those which illustrate the  scientific side of his mind--where he seems clearly aware of this. The  most noteworthy is the one in which Socrates, as a young man, is  explaining the theory of ideas to Parmenides.    After Socrates has explained that there is an idea of the good, but  not of such things as hair and mud and dirt, Parmenides advises him  \"not to despise even the meanest things,\" and this advice shows the  genuine scientific temper. It is with this impartial temper that the  mystic's apparent insight into a higher reality and a hidden good has  to be combined if philosophy is to realise its greatest possibilities.  And it is failure in this respect that has made so much of idealistic  philosophy thin, lifeless, and insubstantial. It is only in marriage  with the world that our ideals can bear fruit: divorced from it, they  remain barren. But marriage with the world is not to be achieved by an  ideal which shrinks from fact, or demands in advance that the world  shall conform to its desires.    Parmenides himself is the source of a peculiarly interesting strain  of mysticism which pervades Plato's thought--the mysticism which may  be called \"logical\" because it is embodied in theories on logic. This  form of mysticism, which appears, so far as the West is concerned, to  have originated with Parmenides, dominates the reasonings of all the  great mystical metaphysicians from his day to that of Hegel and his  modern disciples. Reality, he says, is uncreated, indestructible,  unchanging, indivisible; it is \"immovable in the bonds of mighty  chains, without beginning and without end; since coming into being and  passing away have been driven afar, and true belief has cast them  away.\" The fundamental principle of his inquiry is stated in a  sentence which would not be out of place in Hegel: \"Thou canst not  know what is not--that is impossible--nor utter it; for it"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/25449"],[0,"The Young Castellan: A Tale of the English Civil War (#2)"],[1,"o'  the same sort o' thing as Master Pawson is, and--You won't go and tell  him what I says, sir?\"    \"Do you want me to kick you, Ben?\" said the boy, indignantly.    \"Oh, I don't know, sir,\" said the man, with a good-humoured smile  lighting up his rugged features; \"can, if you like.  Wouldn't be the  first time by many a hundred.\"    \"What!  When did I kick you?\"    \"Lots o' times when you was a little un, and I wouldn't let you drown  yourself in the moat, or break your neck walking along the worsest parts  o' the ramparts, or get yourself trod upon by the horses.  Why, I've  known you kick, and squeal, and fight, and punch me as hard as ever you  could.\"    \"And did it hurt you, Ben?\"    \"Hurt me, sir?  Not it.  I liked it.  Showed you was made o' good stuff,  same good breed as your father; and I used to say to myself, `That young  cub'll turn out as fine a soldier as his father some day, and I shall  have the job o' training him.'  But deary me, deary me, old England's  a-wasting all away!  You aren't got the sperrit you had, my lad; and  instead o' coming to me cheery-like, and saying, `Now, Ben, get out the  swords and let's have a good fence, or a bit o' back-sword or  broad-sword-play, or a turn with the singlestick or staves,' you're  always a-sticking your nose into musty old parchments, or dusty books,  along o' Master Palgrave Pawson.  Brrr!\"    The latter was a low growl, following a loud smack given to the side of  the helmet, after which, as the lad stood fretting and fuming, the old  servant scrubbed away at the steel furiously.    \"It isn't true, Ben,\" the boy cried at last, indignantly; \"and perhaps  I'm going to be a soldier after all, especially if this trouble goes  on.\"    \"Tchaw! trouble goes on!\" said the man, changing the steel headpiece for  a cuirass.  \"There won't be no trouble.  First time your father gets a  sight of the mob of tailors, and shoemakers, and tinkers, with an old  patch-work counterpane atop of a clothes-prop for their flag, he'll ride  along the front of his ridgement of cavaliers, and he'll shout to 'em in  that big voice of his as I've followed many's the time; and `Don't draw,  gentlemen,' he'll say; `ride the scum down, and make the rest run;' and  then they'll all roar with laughing loud enough to drown the trumpet  charge.  My word, I'd a gi'n something to ha' been there to see the  rebels fly like dead leaves before a wind in November.  But it were a  mean and a cruel thing, Master Roy.  Look at that arm, look at these  legs!  I'm a better and a stronger man than ever I was, and could sit  any horse they'd put me on.  But to leave an old soldier, as had  followed him as I have, at home here to rust like the rest o' things,  when there was a chance for a bit o' fun, it went right to my 'art, sir,  and it seemed to me as if it warn't the master as I used to sit with in  the ranks.\"    The old fellow was bending now over the breastplate and rubbing hard,  while as Roy listened to his excited words, wondering at the way in  which he seemed to resent what he looked upon as a slight, something  dropped upon the polished steel with a pat, and spread out; and Roy  thought to himself that if that drop of hot salt water stayed there, it  would make a deeper rust spot than anything.    But it did not stay, for the man hastily rubbed it away, and began with  a rough show of indifference to hum over an old Devon song, something  about \"A morn in May, to hear birds whistle and see lambkins play.\"    But he ceased as the boy laid a hand upon his shoulder, and bent over  the breastplate and rubbed at it very slowly, listening intently the  while.    \"Don't you get thinking that, Ben Martlet,\" said the boy, gently;  \"father wanted to take you, and he said you were not too old.\"    \"Nay, nay, nay, sir; don't you get trying to ile me over.  I know.\"    \"But you don't know,\" said the boy, hotly; \"he said he should take you,  but my mother asked him not to.\"    \"Ay, she would, sir.  She won't let you be a soldier, and she comes over  your father as I was too old and helpless to be any good.\"    \"You're a stupid, pig-headed, old chump,\" cried Roy, angrily.    \"Yes, sir; that's it; now you're at me too.  Rusty, and worn-out, and  good for nothing; but it'll soon be over.  I used to think it must be  very horrid to have to die, but I know better now, and I shan't be sorry  when my turn comes.\"    \"Will--you--listen to--what--I have--to say?\" cried the boy.    \"Oh, ay, sir, I'll listen.  You're my master, now Sir Granby's away, and  nobody shan't say as Ben Martlet didn't do his dooty as a soldier to the  end, even if he is set to dig in a garden as was once a castle  court-yard.\"    \"Oh, you obstinate old mule!\" cried Roy, gripping the man's shoulders,  as he stood behind him, sawing him to and fro, and driving his knee  softly into the broad strong back.  \"Will you listen?\"    \"Yes, sir, I'll listen; but that's only your knee.  Kick the old  worn-out mule with your boot-toe, and--\"    \"I've a good mind to,\" cried Roy.  \"Now listen: my mother begged of  father to leave you here.\"    \"Oh, ay, of course.\"    \"Quiet!\" roared Roy, \"or I will really kick--hard; because she said she  would feel safer, and that, if any trouble did arise with some of the  men, Martlet would put it down at once, and everything would go right.\"    The cuirass went down on the dark oaken boards with a loud clang, and  the old soldier sprang to his feet panting heavily.    \"Her ladyship said that?\" he cried.    \"Yes.\"    \"Say it again, sir; say it again!\" he cried, in a husky voice.    Roy repeated the words.    \"Yes, yes, sir; and what--what did Sir Granby say to that?\"    \"Said he was very sorry and very glad.\"    \"What?\"    \"Sorry to leave you, because it didn't seem natural to go back to the  regiment without his right-hand man.\"    \"Right-hand man?\"    \"Yes; but he was glad my mother felt so about you, for he could go away  more contented now, and satisfied that all would be right.  For though--  ahem!--he had the fullest confidence in me, I was too young to have the  management of men.\"    \"Wrong, wrong, sir--wrong.  On'y want a bit o' training, and you'd make  as good a captain as ever stepped.--Then it was her ladyship's doing,  and she said all that?\"    \"Yes.\"    \"God bless her! my dear mistress.  Here, don't you take no notice o'  this here,\" cried the rough fellow, changing his tone, and undisguisedly  wiping the salt tears from his face.  \"I don't work so much as I ought,  sir, and this here's only what you calls presperashum, sir, as collects,  and will come out somewheres.  And so her ladyship says that, did her?\"    \"Yes, Ben.\"    \"Then why haven't I knowed this afore?  Here's three months gone by  since the master went to take command of his ridgement, and I see him  off.  Ay, I did send him off looking fine, and here have I been eating  my heart out ever since.  Why didn't you tell me?\"    \"Oh, I don't know.  Yes, I do.  Of course, I wasn't going to tattle  about what my father and mother said, but when I heard you talk as you  did, and seem so cut up and unjust, why, I did.\"    \"Here, let me have it, my lad!  Kick away!  Jump on me for an old fool.  Why, I'm as blind as old Jenk.  Worse.--She'd feel safer if there was  any trouble.  Bless her!  Oh, what an old fool I've been.  No wonder  I've got so weak and thin.\"    \"Ha, ha, ha!\"    \"What are you laughing at, sir?\"    \"You weak and thin!  Why, you're as strong as a horse.\"    \"Well, I am, Master Roy,\" said the man, with a grim smile of pride.  \"But I have got a bit thin, sir.\"    \"Not a bit thinner.\"    \"Well, I aren't enjoyed my vittles since the master went, sir.  You  can't contradick that.\"    \"No, and don't want to; but you did eat a four or five pound eel that  you'd no right to catch.\"    \"That I didn't, sir.  I give it to poor old Jenk to make a pie.  I never  tasted it.\"    \"Then you may catch as many as you like, Ben, without asking.\"    \"Thank you, sir; but I don't want to go eeling now.  Here, let's have  all this fighting-tackle so as you can see your face in it.  But I say,  my lad, do 'ee, now do 'ee, alter your mind; leave being statesman to  them soft, smooth kind o' fellows like Master Pawson.\"    \"I don't see why one couldn't be a statesman and a soldier too,\" said  the boy.    \"I don't know nothing about that sort, sir; but I do know how to handle  a sword or to load a gun.  I do say, though, as you're going wrong  instead of right.\"    \"How?\"    \"How, sir?  Just look at your hands.\"    \"Well, what's the matter with them?\" said the boy, holding them out.    Ben Martlet uttered a low, chuckling laugh.    \"I'll tell you, sir.  S'pose any one's badly, and the doctor comes; what  does he do first?\"    \"Feels his pulse.\"    \"What else?\"    \"Looks at his tongue.\"    \"That's it, my lad; and he knows directly from his tongue what's the  matter with him.  Now, you see, Master Roy, I aren't a doctor.\"    \"Not you, Ben; doctors cure people; soldiers kill 'em.\"    \"Not always, Master Roy,\" said the old fellow, whose face during the  last few minutes had lit up till he seemed in the highest of glee.  \"Aren't it sometimes t'other way on?  But look here: doctors look at  people's tongues to see whether they wants to be physicked, or to have  their arms or legs cut off.  I don't.  I looks at a man's hand to see  what's the matter with him, and if I see as he's got a soft, white hand  like a gal's, I know directly he's got no muscles in his arms, no spring  in his back, and no legs to nip a horse's ribs or to march fifty mile in  a day.  Now, just look at yours.\"    \"Oh, I can't help what my hands are like,\" said the boy, impatiently.    \"Oh, yes, you can, sir.  You've been a-neglecting of 'em, sir, horrible;  so just you come to me a little more and let me harden you up a bit.  If  you've got to be a statesman, you won't be none the worse for being able  to fight, and ride, and run.  Now, will you? and--There's some one  a-calling"]]]
