[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/2634"],[0,"The Evolution of Theology: an Anthropological Study (#2)"],[1,"the woman's allusion to the prophetic mantle and  to the aged appearance of the spectre convinced him that it was Samuel.  Reuss [3] in fact translates the passage \"Alors Saul reconnut que  c'etait Samuel.\" Nor does the dialogue between Saul and Samuel  necessarily, or probably, signify that Samuel spoke otherwise than by  the voice of the wise woman. The Septuagint does not hesitate to call  her [Greek], that is to say, a ventriloquist, implying that it was she  who spoke--and this view of the matter is in harmony with the fact that  the exact sense of the Hebrew words which are translated as \"a woman  that hath a familiar spirit\" is \"a woman mistress of _Ob._\" _Ob_ means  primitively a leather bottle, such as a wine skin, and is applied alike  to the necromancer and to the spirit evoked. Its use, in these senses,  appears to have been suggested by the likeness of the hollow sound  emitted by a half-empty skin when struck, to the sepulchral tones in  which the oracles of the evoked spirits were uttered by the medium.  It is most probable that, in accordance with the general theory of  spiritual influences which obtained among the old Israelites, the spirit  of Samuel was conceived to pass into the body of the wise woman, and  to use her vocal organs to speak in his own name--for I cannot discover  that they drew any clear distinction between possession and inspiration.  [4]    If the story of Saul's consultation of the occult powers is to be  regarded as an authentic narrative, or, at any rate, as a statement  which is perfectly veracious so far as the intention of the narrator  goes--and, as I have said, I see no reason for refusing it this  character--it will be found, on further consideration, to throw a  flood of light, both directly and indirectly, on the theology of Saul's  countrymen--that is to say, upon their beliefs respecting the nature and  ways of spiritual beings.    Even without the confirmation of other abundant evidences to the same  effect, it leaves no doubt as to the existence, among them, of the  fundamental doctrine that man consists of a body and of a spirit, which  last, after the death of the body, continues to exist as a ghost. At the  time of Saul's visit to Endor, Samuel was dead and buried; but that his  spirit would be believed to continue to exist in Sheol may be concluded  from the well-known passage in the song attributed to Hannah, his  mother:--         Jahveh killeth and maketh alive;       He bringeth down to Sheol and bringeth up.                                    (1 Sam. ii. 6.)    And it is obvious that this Sheol was thought to be a place underground  in which Samuel's spirit had been disturbed by the necromancer's  summons, and in which, after his return thither, he would be joined by  the spirits of Saul and his sons when they had met with their bodily  death on the hill of Gilboa. It is further to be observed that the  spirit, or ghost, of the dead man presents itself as the image of  the man himself--it is the man, not merely in his ordinary corporeal  presentment (even down to the prophet's mantle) but in his moral and  intellectual characteristics. Samuel, who had begun as Saul's friend and  ended as his bitter enemy, gives it to be understood that he is annoyed  at Saul's presumption in disturbing him; and that, in Sheol, he is as  much the devoted servant of Jahveh and as much empowered to speak in  Jahveh's name as he was during his sojourn in the upper air.    It appears now to be universally admitted that, before the exile, the  Israelites had no belief in rewards and punishments after death, nor in  anything similar to the Christian heaven and hell; but our story proves  that it would be an error to suppose that they did not believe in the  continuance of individual existence after death by a ghostly simulacrum  of life. Nay, I think it would be very hard to produce conclusive  evidence that they disbelieved in immortality; for I am not aware that  there is anything to show that they thought the existence of the souls  of the dead in Sheol ever came to an end. But they do not seem to  have conceived that the condition of the souls in Sheol was in any way  affected by their conduct in life. If there was immortality, there was  no state of retribution in their theology. Samuel expects Saul and his  sons to come to him in Sheol.    The next circumstance to be remarked is that the name of _Elohim_ is  applied to the spirit which the woman sees \"coming up out of the earth,\"  that is to say, from Sheol. The Authorised Version translates this in  its literal sense \"gods.\" The Revised Version gives \"god\" with \"gods\"  in the margin. Reuss renders the word by \"spectre,\" remarking in a  note that it is not quite exact; but that the word Elohim expresses  \"something divine, that is to say, superhuman, commanding respect and  terror\" (\"Histoire des Israelites,\" p. 321). Tuch, in his commentary on  Genesis, and Thenius, in his commentary on Samuel, express substantially  the same opinion. Dr. Alexander (in Kitto's \"Cyclopaedia\" s. v. \"God\")  has the following instructive remarks:--       [_Elohim_ is] sometimes used vaguely to describe unseen     powers or superhuman beings that are not properly thought of as     divine. Thus the witch of Endor saw \"Elohim ascending out of the     earth\" (1 Sam. xxviii. 13), meaning thereby some beings of an     unearthly, superhuman character. So also in Zechariah xii. 8, it     is said \"the house of David shall be as Elohim, as the angel of     the Lord,\" where, as the transition from Elohim to the angel of     the Lord is a minori ad majus, we must regard the former as a     vague designation of supernatural powers.    Dr. Alexander speaks here of \"beings\"; but there is no reason to  suppose that the wise woman of Endor referred to anything but a solitary  spectre; and it is quite clear that Saul understood her in this sense,  for he asks \"What form is HE of?\"    This fact, that the name of Elohim is applied to a ghost, or disembodied  soul, conceived as the image of the body in which it once dwelt, is  of no little importance. For it is well known that the same term was  employed to denote the gods of the heathen, who were thought to have  definite quasi-corporeal forms and to be as much real entities as any  other Elohim. [5] The difference which was supposed to exist between  the different Elohim was one of degree, not one of kind. Elohim was, in  logical terminology, the genus of which ghosts, Chemosh, Dagon,  Baal, and Jahveh were species. The Israelite believed Jahveh to be  immeasurably superior to all other kinds of Elohim. The inscription  on the Moabite stone shows that King Mesa held Chemosh to be, as  unquestionably, the superior of Jahveh. But if Jahveh was thus  supposed to differ only in degree from the undoubtedly zoomorphic or  anthropomorphic \"gods of the nations,\" why is it to be assumed that  he also was not thought of as having a human shape? It is possible for  those who forget that the time of the great prophetic writers is at  least as remote from that of Saul as our day is from that of Queen  Elizabeth, to insist upon interpreting the gross notions current in the  earlier age and among the mass of the people by the refined conceptions  promulgated by a few select spirits centuries later. But if we take the  language constantly used concerning the Deity in the books of Genesis,  Exodus, Joshua, Judges, Samuel, or Kings, in its natural sense (and I am  aware of no valid reason which can be given for taking it in any other  sense), there cannot, to my mind, be a doubt that Jahveh was conceived  by those from whom the substance of these books is mainly derived, to  possess the appearance and the intellectual and moral attributes of a  man; and, indeed, of a man of just that type with which the Israelites  were familiar in their stronger and intellectually abler rulers and  leaders. In a well-known passage in Genesis (i. 27) Elohim is said to  have \"created man in his own image, in the image of Elohim created he  him.\" It is \"man\" who is here said to be the image of Elohim--not man's  soul alone, still less his \"reason,\" but the whole man. It is obvious  that for those who call a manlike ghost Elohim, there could be no  difficulty in conceiving any other Elohim under the same aspect. And if  there could be any doubt on this subject, surely it cannot stand in the  face of what we find in the fifth chapter, where, immediately after a  repetition of the statement that \"Elohim created man, in the likeness  of Elohim made he him,\" it is said that Adam begat Seth \"in his own  likeness, after his image.\" Does this mean that Seth resembled Adam only  in a spiritual and figurative sense? And if that interpretation of  the third verse of the fifth chapter of Genesis is absurd, why does it  become reasonable in the first verse of the same chapter?    But let us go further. Is not the Jahveh who \"walks in the garden in  the cool of the day\"; from whom one may hope to \"hide oneself among the  trees\"; of whom it is expressly said that \"Moses and Aaron, Nadab and  Abihu, and seventy of the elders of Israel,\" saw the Elohim of Israel  (Exod. xxiv. 9-11); and that, although the seeing Jahveh was understood  to be a high crime and misdemeanour, worthy of death, under ordinary  circumstances, yet, for this once, he \"laid not his hand on the nobles  of Israel\"; \"that they beheld Elohim and did eat and drink\"; and that  afterwards Moses saw his back (Exod. xxxiii. 23)--is not this Deity  conceived as manlike in form? Again, is not the Jahveh who eats with  Abraham under the oaks at Mamre, who is pleased with the \"sweet savour\"  of Noah's sacrifice, to whom sacrifices are said to be \"food\" [6]--is  not this Deity depicted as possessed of human appetites? If this were  not the current Israelitish idea of Jahveh even in the eighth century  B.C., where is the point of Isaiah's scathing admonitions to his  countrymen: \"To what purpose"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/26346"],[0,"Our Bird Comrades (#2)"],[1," of the Western United States\") was recently issued, treating  the avifauna west of the Mississippi just as thoroughly as Mr.  Chapman's work deals with that of the eastern part of our country.  Both books contain lavish illustrations by expert and accurate bird  artists--a feature that is invaluable in the work of identification.  They possess a further advantage in not being too large to be carried  with you in your excursions afield, enabling you to name each feathered  stranger on the spot.    Should you desire a single volume that will help you to identify any  bird you may meet on our continent, I would urge you to secure the  latest revised edition of Dr. Elliott Coues's \"Key to North American  Birds.\"  It is fully illustrated, thoroughly scientific and up-to-date  in the matter of classification, and yet not too technical for  practical use.  This book is too bulky to be carried with you to the  haunts of the birds, but it may be used in this way: Note carefully the  markings and other peculiarities of each new bird you meet; then, as  soon as you return home, while all the circumstances are fresh in your  memory, consult your \"key\" and make sure, if possible, of the identity  of all your \"finds.\"    Mr. Robert Ridgway, one of the foremost ornithologists of our country,  is now preparing a great work which is worthy of the highest praise.  It is entitled \"The Birds of North and Middle America,\" and is the most  comprehensive work yet undertaken relative to the avifauna of the  entire North American Continent, giving a large amount of scientific  data respecting all the species.  After its completion it will enable  the student to identify every bird known to science from the Isthmus of  Panama to the far North and from the Atlantic to the Pacific.  At this  writing two volumes have been issued.  They are published under  government auspices by the United States National Museum at Washington,  D. C., and may be procured perhaps without cost by writing to the  secretary of the Smithsonian Institution.  Of this the writer cannot be  absolutely sure, as the supply of printed copies may be limited.    Nothing more need be said about bird manuals, save to warn you against  spending your money for books which describe only a part of the  avifauna of a given region and yet are advertised as serviceable for  the identification of all birds.  Unless you have plenty of money to  spend, when you buy a manual buy one that is scientifically accurate  and complete.  Nothing is more trying to the student of birds, whether  tyro or expert, than to encounter a new bird and then fail to find it  described or even mentioned in the book that has been foisted upon him  as a manual.  In saying this I do not mean to discourage the purchase  of the charming popular books written in a literary vein and describing  personal observations on bird life, such as the works of John  Burroughs, Bradford Torrey, Olive Thorne Miller, and many others.  These books, however, are not advertised as handbooks, and thus no one  is deceived in buying them.    Even with the best manual in hand, you must not expect to be able to  identify every new bird at the first attempt, for some species are  either exceedingly shy or obscurely marked, or probably both, while  quite a number are so much alike in markings and habits that it is hard  to distinguish them from one another.  A few birds remained enigmas to  me for a number of years, in spite of the help of the field glass.  At  intervals for several months you will often catch provoking glimpses of  some nymph-like bird before you succeed in determining its true place  in the avian system.  But patience and persistence will some day  overcome the most stubborn difficulties.    Since the foregoing references to leading bird manuals were written, a  new work, which is unique in plan, has been published.  I refer to the  book entitled \"Color Key to North American Birds\"; text by Frank M.  Chapman, pictures by Chester A. Reed.  The range of the volume is from  the Atlantic to the Pacific ocean and from the southern boundary of the  United States to the far north.  It contains a brief description of  every species and sub-species within the limits named; a key to all the  Orders and Families, with the common and scientific names of all the  birds; an introduction to every chief division; and last, and highly  important, colored pictures of all the species and many of the  geographical varieties.  What more can the bird student desire for  purposes of identification?  While the other manuals give fuller  descriptions of habits, songs, etc., and need not, therefore, be  superseded by this volume, yet frankness forces us to say that if the  student, and especially the beginner, cannot afford to buy more than  one bird book, the Chapman-Reed \"Color Key\" is the one to get.  It is  of a convenient size for carrying afield, so that a feathered stranger  can be identified on the spot.  It can be used anywhere in the United  States, in British America, and Alaska.  Think of that, fellow  bird-lovers!    A good field glass is indispensable to successful bird study,  especially if you desire to name all the birds without killing any, as  I hope you do.  Perhaps the older ornithologists, like Audubon and  Wilson, did not use helps of this kind, but they used guns, and  consequently had to study dead birds, while you and I want to study  living ones.  Their killing of birds was, indeed, necessary, for  purposes of scientific classification; but now that such classifying  has, for the most part, been attained, the gun has largely gone out of  vogue, and the glass has taken its place.  Let your alliterative motto  be: _With the glass, not the gun_.    I would advise you not to buy a flashily colored glass, for it will  dazzle your eyes on sunshiny days.  Be sure to get one that is easily  focused, as you must be quick in studying such shy creatures as the  birds.  At first the glass may strain and tire your eyes, but that  difficulty will pass in a short time.  Expertness will soon be won in  the use of a binocular, so that you will be able, almost instantly, to  get the desired object within its field, even though the object be  quite tiny.  An opera glass is a great deal better than no glass at  all; a field glass is better still, and a Bausch & Lomb binocular of  six to eight magnifying power is the best of all; being almost equal to  having the bird in hand.  The observer must lose as little time as  possible in sighting a shy bird, or it may escape him altogether.    A book-bag or haversack, strapped around your shoulders, will also be a  convenience.  In it you can stow your bird manual, and a luncheon in  case you expect to spend the whole day in the open, for a hungry  rambler is not likely to be an acute observer.  A notebook and a lead  pencil, carried in handy pockets, should not be forgotten.  Donning an  old suit of clothes, you can roam where you will, threading your way  through brier and bush, wading the bog or the shallow stream, dropping  upon your knees, even flinging yourself upon the ground, to spy upon a  wary bird flitting about in the copse.    In almost all kinds of weather I wear rubber boots in my excursions to  the haunts of the birds.  The observer can never tell when he may have  to wade a stream or tramp through a boggy marsh.  In wet and cold  weather the need of rubber boots can be seen readily, but even in dry  and warm weather they have one decided advantage--they do not become  slippery on the soles as one tramps through the leaf-strewn woods or  the grassy fields.  Every pedestrian knows that sole-leather is apt to  become as smooth as glass, making it difficult to retain one's footing.  On the other hand, rubber seems to cling to the ground, no matter how  much it is worn.  The only objection to rubbers is that they are  uncomfortably warm in hot weather; but that difficulty can be overcome  by frequently plunging into a cool stream and standing there for  several minutes.    Let me caution you, however, not to purchase a _heavy_ pair of rubber  boots.  Insist on having a light pair or none at all.  A good pair of  rubber boots are a real luxury, for with them you may tramp about in  all kinds of damp and boggy places without fear of wetting your feet,  though it goes without saying that you must be careful not to wade in  over the tops of your footgear.    Of great assistance to the pedestrian is a light cane.  In climbing  Pikes Peak one evening after dark, I doubt whether I should have been  able to gain the summit had it not been for my tough little wild-cherry  cane, upon which I could lean when almost exhausted, which supported my  faltering steps, and which happily never grew weary.  Two years later  it helped me to scale a number of snow-capped mountains, among them  Grays Peak and Peak Number Eight of the Ten Mile Range.  Indeed, my  little cane was of so much service to me that I came to look upon it as  a personal friend that cared almost as much for me as I did for it.  It  pushed aside thorny bushes and nettlesome weeds when I was looking for  nests, thus saving my hands many a painful wound.  And more than one  serpent, including the rattlesnake, has had his head crushed or his  spine broken by sturdy blows from my little wild-cherry cane.  I should  add that it had a hooked handle, so that I could hang it on the strap  of my haversack when I needed both hands.    In the beginning of your observations you will find the work of  identifying the birds a rare and exciting pleasure; then, after you  have named all the species in your neighborhood, it will be no less  delightful to study their interesting ways, or to extend your  researches to other fields.  And if at any time you observe some odd  bits of bird behavior which you think will be news to the many bird  lovers the world over, why should you not report them to one of the  bird magazines, so that others may"]]]
