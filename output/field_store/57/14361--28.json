The assault was over in a few moments; the priests and their  flock fled by one door, while the Reformers entered by another. The  building was in the twinkling of an eye adapted to the new form of  worship: the great crucifix from above the altar was dragged about the  streets at the end of a rope and scourged at every cross-roads. In the  evening a large fire was lighted in the place before the cathedral, and  the archives of the ecclesiastical and religious houses, the sacred  images, the relics of the saints, the decorations of the altar, the  sacerdotal vestments, even the Host itself, were thrown on it without  any remonstrance from the consuls; the very wind which blew upon Nimes  breathed heresy.    For the moment Nimes was in full revolt, and the spirit of organisation  spread: Moget assumed the titles of pastor and minister of the Christian  Church. Captain Bouillargues melted down the sacred vessels of the  Catholic churches, and paid in this manner the volunteers of Nimes and  the German mercenaries; the stones of the demolished religious houses  were used in the construction of fortifications, and before anyone  thought of attacking it the city was ready for a siege. It was at this  moment that Guillaume Calviere, who was at the head of the Presidial  Court, Moget being president of the Consistory, and Captain Bouillargues  commander-in-chief of the armed forces, suddenly resolved to create a  new authority, which, while sharing the powers hitherto vested solely in  the consuls, should be, even more than they, devoted to Calvin: thus the  office of les Messieurs came into being. This was neither more nor less  than a committee of public safety, and having been formed in the stress  of revolution it acted in a revolutionary spirit, absorbing the powers  of the consuls, and restricting the authority of the Consistory to  things spiritual. In the meantime the Edict of Amboise, was promulgated,  and it was announced that the king, Charles IX, accompanied by Catherine  de Medicis, was going to visit his loyal provinces in the South.    Determined as was Captain Bouillargues, for once he had to give way, so  strong was the party against him; therefore, despite the murmurs of the  fanatics, the city of Nimes resolved, not only to open its gates to its  sovereign, but to give him such a reception as would efface the bad  impression which Charles might have received from the history of recent  events. The royal procession was met at the Pont du Gare, where young  girls attired as nymphs emerged from a grotto bearing a collation, which  they presented to their Majesties, who graciously and heartily partook  of it. The repast at an end, the illustrious travellers resumed their  progress; but the imagination of the Nimes authorities was not to be  restrained within such narrow bounds: at the entrance to the city the  king found the Porte de la Couronne transformed into a mountain-side,  covered with vines and olive trees, under which a shepherd was tending  his flock. As the king approached the mountain parted as if yielding to  the magic of his power, the most beautiful maidens and the most noble  came out to meet their sovereign, presenting him the keys of the city  wreathed with flowers, and singing to the accompaniment of the  shepherd's pipe. Passing through the mountain, Charles saw chained to a  palm tree in the depths of a grotto a monster crocodile from whose jaws  issued flames: this was a representation of the old coat of arms granted  to the city by Octavius Caesar Augustus after the battle of Actium, and  which Francis I had restored to it in exchange for a model in silver of  the amphitheatre presented to him by the city. Lastly, the king found in  the Place de la Salamandre numerous bonfires, so that without waiting to  ask if these fires were made from the remains of the faggots used at the  martyrdom of Maurice Secenat, he went to bed very much pleased with the  reception accorded him by his good city of Nimes, and sure that all the  unfavourable reports he had heard were calumnies.    Nevertheless, in order that such rumours, however slight their  foundation, should not again be heard, the king appointed Damville  governor of Languedoc, installing him himself in the chief city of his  government; he then removed every consul from his post without  exception, and appointed in their place Guy-Rochette, doctor and lawyer;  Jean Beaudan, burgess; Francois Aubert, mason; and Cristol Ligier, farm  labourer--all Catholics. He then left for Paris, where a short time  after he concluded a treaty with the Calvinists, which the people with  its gift of prophecy called \"The halting peace of unsure seat,\" and  which in the end led to the massacre of St. Bartholomew.    Gracious as had been the measures taken by the king to secure the peace  of his good city of Nimes, they had nevertheless been reactionary;  consequently the Catholics, feeling the authorities were now on their  side, returned in crowds: the householders reclaimed their houses, the  priests their churches; while, rendered ravenous by the bitter bread of  exile, both the clergy and the laity pillaged the treasury. Their return  was not, however; stained by bloodshed, although the Calvinists were  reviled in the open street. A few stabs from a dagger or shots from an  arquebus might, however, have been better; such wounds heal while  mocking words rankle in the memory.    On the morrow of Michaelmas Day--that is, on the 31st September 1567--a  number of conspirators might have been seen issuing from a house and  spreading themselves through the streets, crying \"To arms! Down with the  Papists!\" Captain Bouillargues was taking his revenge.    As the Catholics were attacked unawares, they did not make even a show  of resistance: a number of Protestants--those who possessed the best  arms--rushed to the house of Guy-Rochette, the first consul, and seized  the keys of the city. Guy Rochette, startled by the cries of the crowds,  had looked out of the window, and seeing a furious mob approaching his  house, and feeling that their rage was directed against himself, had  taken refuge with his brother Gregoire. There, recovering his courage  and presence of mind, he recalled the important responsibilities  attached to his office, and resolving to fulfil them whatever might  happen, hastened to consult with the other magistrates, but as they all  gave him very excellent reasons for not meddling, he soon felt there was  no dependence to be placed on such cowards and traitors. He next  repaired to the episcopal palace, where he found the bishop surrounded  by the principal Catholics of the town, all on their knees offering up  earnest prayers to Heaven, and awaiting martyrdom. Guy-Rochette joined  them, and the prayers were continued.    A few instants later fresh noises were heard in the street, and the  gates of the palace court groaned under blows of axe and crowbar.  Hearing these alarming sounds, the bishop, forgetting that it was his  duty to set a brave example, fled through a breach in the wall of the  next house; but Guy-Rochette and his companions valiantly resolved not  to run away, but to await their fate with patience. The gates soon  yielded, and the courtyard and palace were filled with Protestants: at  their head appeared Captain Bouillargues, sword in hand. Guy-Rochette  and those with him were seized and secured in a room under the charge of  four guards, and the palace was looted. Meantime another band of  insurgents had attacked the house of the vicar-general, John Pebereau,  whose body pierced by seven stabs of a dagger was thrown out of a  window, the same fate as was meted out to Admiral Coligny eight years  later at the hands of the Catholics. In the house a sum of 800 crowns  was found and taken. The two bands then uniting, rushed to the  cathedral, which they sacked for the second time.    Thus the entire day passed in murder and pillage: when night came the  large number of prisoners so imprudently taken began to be felt as an  encumbrance by the insurgent chiefs, who therefore resolved to take  advantage of the darkness to get rid of them without causing too much  excitement in the city. They were therefore gathered together from the  various houses in which they had been confined, and were brought to a  large hall in the Hotel de Ville, capable of containing from four to  five hundred persons, and which was soon full. An irregular tribunal  arrogating to itself powers of life and death was formed, and a clerk  was appointed to register its decrees. A list of all the prisoners was  given him, a cross placed before a name indicating that its bearer was  condemned to death, and, list in hand, he went from group to group  calling out the names distinguished by the fatal sign. Those thus sorted  out were then conducted to a spot which had been chosen beforehand as  the place of execution.    This was the palace courtyard in the middle of which yawned a well  twenty-four feet in circumference and fifty deep. The fanatics thus  found a grave ready-digged as it were to their hand, and to save time,  made use of it.    The unfortunate Catholics, led thither in groups, were either stabbed  with daggers or mutilated with axes, and the bodies thrown down the  well. Guy-Rochette was one of the first to be dragged up. For himself he  asked neither mercy nor favour, but he begged that the life of his young  brother might be spared, whose only crime was the bond of blood which  united them; but the assassins, paying no heed to his prayers, struck  down both man and boy and flung them into the well. The corpse of the  vicar-general, who had been killed the day before, was in its turn  dragged thither by a rope and added to the others. All night the  massacre went on, the crimsoned water rising in the well as corpse after  corpse was thrown in, till, at break of day, it overflowed, one hundred  and twenty bodies "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/2744"],[0,"Mary Stuart (#2)"],[1,"  anchored at the mouth of the Clyde, Mary, after having been hotly  pursued by the English fleet, entered Brest harbour, 15th August, 1548,  one year after the death of Francis! Besides the queen's four Marys, the  vessels also brought to France three of her natural brothers, among whom  was the Prior of St. Andrews, James Stuart, who was later to abjure the  Catholic faith, and with the title of Regent, and under the name of the  Earl of Murray, to become so fatal to poor Mary. From Brest, Mary went  to St. Germain-en-Laye, where Henry II, who had just ascended the  throne, overwhelmed her with caresses, and then sent her to a convent  where the heiresses of the noblest French houses were brought up. There  Mary's happy qualities developed. Born with a woman's heart and a man's  head, Mary not only acquired all the accomplishments which constituted  the education of a future queen, but also that real knowledge which is  the object of the truly learned.    Thus, at fourteen, in the Louvre, before Henry II, Catherine de Medici,  and the whole court, she delivered a discourse in Latin of her own  composition, in which she maintained that it becomes women to cultivate  letters, and that it is unjust and tyrannical to deprive flowery of  their perfumes, by banishing young girls from all but domestic cares.  One can imagine in what manner a future queen, sustaining such a thesis,  was likely to be welcomed in the most lettered and pedantic court in  Europe. Between the literature of Rabelais and Marot verging on their  decline, and that of Ronsard and Montaigne reaching their zenith, Mary  became a queen of poetry, only too happy never to have to wear another  crown than that which Ronsard, Dubellay, Maison-Fleur, and Brantome  placed daily on her head. But she was predestined. In the midst of those  fetes which a waning chivalry was trying to revive came the fatal joust  of Tournelles: Henry II, struck by a splinter of a lance for want of a  visor, slept before his time with his ancestors, and Mary Stuart  ascended the throne of France, where, from mourning for Henry, she  passed to that for her mother, and from mourning for her mother to that  for her husband. Mary felt this last loss both as woman and as poet; her  heart burst forth into bitter tears and plaintive harmonies. Here are  some lines that she composed at this time:        \"Into my song of woe,             Sung to a low sad air,             My cruel grief I throw,             For loss beyond compare;             In bitter sighs and tears             Go by my fairest years.               Was ever grief like mine             Imposed by destiny?             Did ever lady pine,             In high estate, like me,             Of whom both heart and eye             Within the coffin lie?               Who, in the tender spring             And blossom of my youth,             Taste all the sorrowing             Of life's extremest ruth,             And take delight in nought             Save in regretful thought.               All that was sweet and gay             Is now a pain to see;             The sunniness of day             Is black as night to me;             All that was my delight             Is hidden from my sight.               My heart and eye, indeed,             One face, one image know,             The which this mournful weed             On my sad face doth show,             Dyed with the violet's tone             That is the lover's own.               Tormented by my ill,             I go from place to place,             But wander as I will             My woes can nought efface;             My most of bad and good             I find in solitude.               But wheresoe'er I stay,             In meadow or in copse,             Whether at break of day             Or when the twilight drops,             My heart goes sighing on,             Desiring one that's gone.               If sometimes to the skies             My weary gaze I lift,             His gently shining eyes             Look from the cloudy drift,             Or stooping o'er the wave             I see him in the grave.               Or when my bed I seek,             And sleep begins to steal,             Again I hear him speak,             Again his touch I feel;             In work or leisure,             he is ever near to me.               No other thing I see,             However fair displayed,             By which my heart will be             A tributary made,             Not having the perfection             Of that, my lost affection.               Here make an end, my verse,             Of this thy sad lament,             Whose burden shall rehearse             Pure love of true intent,             Which separation's stress             Will never render less.\"    \"It was then,\" says Brantome, \"that it was delightful to see her; for  the whiteness of her countenance and of her veil contended together; but  finally the artificial white yielded, and the snow-like pallor of her  face vanquished the other. For it was thus,\" he adds, \"that from the  moment she became a widow, I always saw her with her pale hue, as long  as I had the honour of seeing her in France, and Scotland, where she had  to go in eighteen months' time, to her very great regret, after her  widowhood, to pacify her kingdom, greatly divided by religious troubles.  Alas! she had neither the wish nor the will for it, and I have often  heard her say so, with a fear of this journey like death; for she  preferred a hundred times to dwell in France as a dowager queen, and to  content herself with Touraine and Poitou for her jointure, than to go  and reign over there in her wild country; but her uncles, at least some  of them, not all, advised her, and even urged her to it, and deeply  repented their error.\"    Mary was obedient, as we have seen, and she began her journey under such  auspices that when she lost sight of land she was like to die. Then it  was that the poetry of her soul found expression in these famous lines:        \"Farewell, delightful land of France,       My motherland,       The best beloved!       Foster-nurse of my young years!       Farewell, France, and farewell my happy days!       The ship that separates our loves       Has borne away but half of me;       One part is left thee and is throe,       And I confide it to thy tenderness,       That thou may'st hold in mind the other part.\"'    _[Translator's note.-It has not been found possible to make a rhymed  version of these lines without sacrificing the simplicity which is their  chief charm.]_    This part of herself that Mary left in France was the body of the young  king, who had taken with him all poor Mary's happiness into his tomb.    Mary had but one hope remaining, that the sight of the English fleet  would compel her little squadron to turn back; but she had to fulfil her  destiny. This same day, a fog, a very unusual occurrence in summer-time,  extended all over the Channel, and caused her to escape the fleet; for  it was such a dense fog that one could not see from stern to mast. It  lasted the whole of Sunday, the day after the departure, and did not  lift till the following day, Monday, at eight o'clock in the morning.  The little flotilla, which all this time had been sailing haphazard, had  got among so many reefs that if the fog had lasted some minutes longer  the galley would certainly have grounded on some rock, and would have  perished like the vessel that had been seen engulfed on leaving port.  But, thanks to the fog's clearing, the pilot recognised the Scottish  coast, and, steering his four boats with great skill through all the  dangers, on the 20th August he put in at Leith, where no preparation had  been made for the queen's reception. Nevertheless, scarcely had she  arrived there than the chief persons of the town met together and came  to felicitate her. Meanwhile, they hastily collected some wretched nags,  with harness all falling in pieces, to conduct the queen to Edinburgh.    At sight of this, Mary could not help weeping again; for she thought of  the splendid palfreys and hackneys of her French knights and ladies, and  at this first view Scotland appeared to her in all its poverty. Next day  it was to appear to her in all its wildness.    After having passed one night at Holyrood Palace, \"during which,\" says  Brantome, \"five to six hundred rascals from the town, instead of letting  her sleep, came to give her a wild morning greeting on wretched fiddles  and little rebecks,\" she expressed a wish to hear mass. Unfortunately,  the people of Edinburgh belonged almost entirely to the Reformed  religion; so that, furious at the queen's giving such a proof of  papistry at her first appearance, they entered the church by force,  armed with knives, sticks and stones, with the intention of putting to  death the poor priest, her chaplain. He left the altar, and took refuge  near the queen, while Mary's brother, the Prior of St. Andrews, who was  more inclined from this time forward to be a soldier than an  ecclesiastic, seized a sword, and, placing himself between the people  and the queen, declared that he would kill with his own hand the first  man who should take another step. This firmness, combined with the  queen's imposing and dignified air, checked the zeal of the Reformers.    As we have said, Mary had arrived in the midst of all the heat of the  first religious wars. A zealous Catholic, like all her family on the  maternal side, she inspired the Huguenots with the gravest fears:  besides, a rumour had got about that Mary, instead of landing at Leith,  as she had been obliged by the fog, was to land at Aberdeen. There, it  was said, she would have found the Earl of Huntly, one of the peers who  had remained loyal to the Catholic faith, and who, next to the family of  Hamilton, was, the nearest and most powerful ally of the royal house.  Seconded by him and by twenty thousand soldiers from the"]]]
