Let us lose no time; I have made up my mind.\"    \"Stay,\" replied the girl, grasping his arm; \"at the left-hand corner of  the yard there is a large heap of straw, the gallery hangs just over  it--\"    \"Bravo! I shall make less noise, and do myself less mischief.\" He made a  step towards the door; the girl, hardly knowing what she was doing,  tried to detain him; but he got loose from her and opened it. The moon  was shining brightly into the yard; he heard no sound. He proceeded to  the end of the wooden rail, and perceived the dungheap, which rose to a  good height: the girl made the sign of the cross. The marquis listened  once again, heard nothing, and mounted the rail. He was about to jump  down, when by wonderful luck he heard murmurings from a deep voice. This  proceeded from one of two horsemen, who were recommencing their  conversation and passing between them a pint of wine. The marquis crept  back to his door, holding his breath: the girl was awaiting him on the  threshold.    \"I told you it was not yet time,\" said she.    \"Have you never a knife,\" said the marquis, \"to cut those rascals'  throats with?\"    \"Wait, I entreat you, one hour, one hour only,\" murmured the young girl;  \"in an hour they will all be asleep.\"    The girl's voice was so sweet, the arms which she stretched towards him  were full of such gentle entreaty, that the marquis waited, and at the  end of an hour it was the young girl's turn to tell him to start.    The marquis for the last time pressed with his mouth those lips but  lately so innocent, then he half opened the door, and heard nothing this  time but dogs barking far away in an otherwise silent country. He leaned  over the balustrade, and saw: very plainly a soldier lying prone on the  straw.    \"If they were to awake?\" murmured the young girl in accents of anguish.    \"They will not take me alive, be assured,\" said the marquis.    \"Adieu, then,\" replied she, sobbing; \"may Heaven preserve you!\"    He bestrode the balustrade, spread himself out upon it, and fell heavily  on the dungheap. The young girl saw him run to the shed, hastily detach  a horse, pass behind the stable wall, spur his horse in both flanks,  tear across the kitchen garden, drive his horse against the hurdle,  knock it down, clear it, and reach the highroad across the fields.    The poor girl remained at the end of the gallery, fixing her eyes on the  sleeping sentry, and ready to disappear at the slightest movement. The  noise made by spurs on the pavement and by the horse at the end of the  courtyard had half awakened him. He rose, and suspecting some surprise,  ran to the shed. His horse was no longer there; the marquis, in his  haste to escape, had taken the first which came to hand, and this was  the soldier's. Then the soldier gave the alarm; his comrades woke up.  They ran to the prisoner's room, and found it empty. The provost came  from his bed in a dazed condition. The prisoner had escaped.    Then the young girl, pretending to have been roused by the noise,  hindered the preparations by mislaying the saddlery, impeding the  horsemen instead of helping them; nevertheless, after a quarter of an  hour, all the party were galloping along the road. The provost swore  like a pagan. The best horses led the way, and the sentinel, who rode  the marquis's, and who had a greater interest in catching the prisoner,  far outstripped his companions; he was followed by the sergeant, equally  well mounted, and as the broken fence showed the line he had taken,  after some minutes they were in view of him, but at a great distance.  However, the marquis was losing ground; the horse he had taken was the  worst in the troop, and he had pressed it as hard as it could go.  Turning in the saddle, he saw the soldiers half a musket-shot off; he  urged his horse more and more, tearing his sides with his spurs; but  shortly the beast, completely winded, foundered; the marquis rolled with  it in the dust, but when rolling over he caught hold of the holsters,  which he found to contain pistols; he lay flat by the side of the horse,  as if he had fainted, with a pistol at full cock in his hand. The  sentinel, mounted on a valuable horse, and more than two hundred yards  ahead of his serafile, came up to him. In a moment the marquis, jumping  up before he had tune to resist him, shot him through the head; the  horseman fell, the marquis jumped up in his place without even setting  foot in the stirrup, started off at a gallop, and went away like the  wind, leaving fifty yards behind him the non-commissioned officer,  dumbfounded with what had just passed before his eyes.    The main body of the escort galloped up, thinking that he was taken; and  the provost shouted till he was hoarse, \"Do not kill him!\" But they  found only the sergeant, trying to restore life to his man, whose skull  was shattered, and who lay dead on the spot.    As for the marquis, he was out of sight; for, fearing a fresh pursuit,  he had plunged into the cross roads, along which he rode a good hour  longer at full gallop. When he felt pretty sure of having shaken the  police off his track, and that their bad horses could not overtake him,  he determined to slacken to recruit his horse; he was walking him along  a hollow lane, when he saw a peasant approaching; he asked him the road  to the Bourbonnais, and flung him a crown. The man took the crown and  pointed out the road, but he seemed hardly to know what he was saying,  and stared at the marquis in a strange manner. The marquis shouted to  him to get out of the way; but the peasant remained planted on the  roadside without stirring an inch. The marquis advanced with threatening  looks, and asked how he dared to stare at him like that.    \"The reason is,\" said the peasant, \"that you have----\", and he pointed  to his shoulder and his ruff.    The marquis glanced at his dress, and saw that his coat was dabbled in  blood, which, added to the disorder of his clothes and the dust with  which he was covered, gave him a most suspicious aspect.    \"I know,\" said he. \"I and my servant have been separated in a scuffle  with some drunken Germans; it's only a tipsy spree, and whether I have  got scratched, or whether in collaring one of these fellows I have drawn  some of his blood, it all arises from the row. I don't think I am hurt a  bit.\" So saying, he pretended to feel all over his body.    \"All the same,\" he continued, \"I should not be sorry to have a wash;  besides, I am dying with thirst and heat, and my horse is in no better  case. Do you know where I can rest and refresh myself?\"    The peasant offered to guide him to his own house, only a few yards off.  His wife and children, who were working, respectfully stood aside, and  went to collect what was wanted--wine, water, fruit, and a large piece  of black bread. The marquis sponged his coat, drank a glass of wine, and  called the people of the house, whom he questioned in an indifferent  manner. He once more informed himself of the different roads leading  into the Bourbonnais province, where he was going to visit a relative;  of the villages, cross roads, distances; and finally he spoke of the  country, the harvest, and asked what news there was.    The peasant replied, with regard to this, that it was surprising to hear  of disturbances on the highway at this moment, when it was patrolled by  detachments of mounted police, who had just made an important capture.    \"Who is that?--\" asked the marquis.    \"Oh,\" said the peasant, \"a nobleman who has done a lot of mischief in  the country.\"    \"What! a nobleman in the hands of justice?\"    \"Just so; and he stands a good chance of losing his head.\"    \"Do they say what he has done?\"    \"Shocking things; horrid things; everything he shouldn't do. All the  province is exasperated with him.\"    \"Do you know him?\"    \"No, but we all have his description.\"    As this news was not encouraging, the marquis, after a few more  questions, saw to his horse, patted him, threw some more money to the  peasant, and disappeared in the direction pointed out.    The provost proceeded half a league farther along the road; but coming  to the conclusion that pursuit was useless, he sent one of his men to  headquarters, to warn all the points of exit from the province, and  himself returned with his troop to the place whence he had started in  the morning. The marquis had relatives in the neighbourhood, and it was  quite possible that he might seek shelter with some of them. All the  village ran to meet the horsemen, who were obliged to confess that they  had been duped by the handsome prisoner. Different views were expressed  on the event, which gave rise to much talking. The provost entered the  inn, banging his fist on the furniture, and blaming everybody for the  misfortune which had happened to him. The daughter of the house, at  first a prey to the most grievous anxiety, had great difficulty in  concealing her joy.    The provost spread his papers over the table, as if to nurse his  ill-temper.    \"The biggest rascal in the world!\" he cried; \"I ought to have suspected  him.\"    \"What a handsome man he was!\" said the hostess.    \"A consummate rascal! Do you know who he is? He is the Marquis de  Saint-Maixent!\"    \"The Marquis de Saint-Maixent!\" all cried with horror.    \"Yes, the very man,\" replied the provost; \"the Marquis de Saint-Maixent,  accused, and indeed convicted, of coining and magic.\"    \"Ah!\"    \"Convicted of incest.\"    \"O my God!\"    \"Convicted of having strangled his wife to marry another, whose husband  he had first stabbed.\"    \"Heaven help us!\" All crossed themselves.    \"Yes, good people,\" continued the furious provost, \"this is the nice boy  who has just escaped the king's justice!\"    The host's daughter left the room, for she felt she was going to faint.    \"But,\" said the host, \"is there no hope of catching him again?\"    \"Not"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/2755"],[0,"Murat (#2)"],[1,"of all my friends,  believing that you were devoted enough to me to render me a great  service.\"    \"You did well, captain.\"    \"Let us go straight to the point, as men who respect and trust each  other should do. My uncle, King Joachim, is proscribed, he has taken  refuge with me; but he cannot remain there, for I am the first person  they will suspect. Your house is in an isolated position, and  consequently we could not find a better retreat for him. You must put it  at our disposal until events enable the king to come to some decision.\"    \"It is at your service,\" said Marouin.    \"Right. My uncle shall sleep there to-night.\"    \"But at least give me time to make some preparations worthy of my royal  guest.\"    \"My poor Marouin, you are giving yourself unnecessary trouble, and  making a vexatious delay for us: King Joachim is no longer accustomed to  palaces and courtiers; he is only too happy nowadays to find a cottage  with a friend in it; besides, I have let him know about it, so sure was  I of your answer. He is counting on sleeping at your house to-night, and  if I try to change his determination now he will see a refusal in what  is only a postponement, and you will lose all the credit for your  generous and noble action. There--it is agreed: to-night at ten at the  Champs de Mars.\"    With these words the captain put his horse to a gallop and disappeared.  Marouin turned his horse and went back to his country house to give the  necessary orders for the reception of a stranger whose name he did not  mention.    At ten o'clock at night, as had been agreed, Marouin was on the Champs  de Mars, then covered with Marshal Brune's field-artillery. No one had  arrived yet. He walked up and down between the gun-carriages until a  functionary came to ask what he was doing. He was hard put to it to find  an answer: a man is hardly likely to be wandering about in an artillery  park at ten o'clock at night for the mere pleasure of the thing. He  asked to see the commanding officer. The officer came up: M. Marouin  informed him that he was an avocat, attached to the law courts of  Toulon, and told him that he had arranged to meet someone on the Champs  de Mars, not knowing that it was prohibited, and that he was still  waiting for that person. After this explanation, the officer authorised  him to remain, and went back to his quarters. The sentinel, a faithful  adherent to discipline, continued to pace up and down with his measured  step, without troubling any more about the stranger's presence.    A few moments later a group of several persons appeared from the  direction of Les Lices. The night was magnificent, and the moon  brilliant. Marouin recognised Bonafoux, and went up to him. The captain  at once took him by the hand and led him to the king, and speaking in  turn to each of them--    \"Sire,\" he said, \"here is the friend. I told you of.\"    Then turning to Marouin--    \"Here,\" he said, \"is the King of Naples, exile and fugitive, whom I  confide to your care. I do not speak of the possibility that some day he  may get back his crown, that would deprive you of the credit of your  fine action.... Now, be his guide--we will follow at a distance. March!\"    The king and the lawyer set out at once together. Murat was dressed in a  blue coat-semi-military, semi-civil, buttoned to the throat; he wore  white trousers and top boots with spurs; he had long hair, moustache,  and thick whiskers, which would reach round his neck.    As they rode along he questioned his host about the situation of his  country house and the facility for reaching the sea in case of a  surprise. Towards midnight the king and Marouin arrived at Bonette; the  royal suite came up in about ten minutes; it consisted of about thirty  individuals. After partaking of some light refreshment, this little  troop, the last of the court of the deposed king, retired to disperse in  the town and its environs, and Murat remained alone with the women, only  keeping one valet named Leblanc.    Murat stayed nearly a month in this retirement, spending all his time in  answering the newspapers which accused him of treason to the Emperor.  This accusation was his absorbing idea, a phantom, a spectre to him; day  and night he tried to shake it off, seeking in the difficult position in  which he had found himself all the reasons which it might offer him for  acting as he had acted. Meanwhile the terrible news of the defeat at  Waterloo had spread abroad. The Emperor who had exiled him was an exile  himself, and he was waiting at Rochefort, like Murat at Toulon, to hear  what his enemies would decide against him. No one knows to this day what  inward prompting Napoleon obeyed when, rejecting the counsels of General  Lallemande and the devotion of Captain Bodin, he preferred England to  America, and went like a modern Prometheus to be chained to the rock of  St. Helena.    We are going to relate the fortuitous circumstance which led Murat to  the moat of Pizzo, then we will leave it to fatalists to draw from this  strange story whatever philosophical deduction may please them. We, as  humble annalists, can only vouch for the truth of the facts we have  already related and of those which will follow.    King Louis XVIII remounted his throne, consequently Murat lost all hope  of remaining in France; he felt he was bound to go. His nephew Bonafoux  fitted out a frigate for the United States under the name of Prince  Rocca Romana. The whole suite went on board, and they began to carry on  to the boat all the valuables which the exile had been able to save from  the shipwreck of his kingdom. First a bag of gold weighing nearly a  hundred pounds, a sword-sheath on which were the portraits of the king,  the queen, and their children, the deed of the civil estates of his  family bound in velvet and adorned with his arms. Murat carried on his  person a belt where some precious papers were concealed, with about a  score of unmounted diamonds, which he estimated himself to be worth four  millions.    When all these preparations for departing were accomplished, it was  agreed that the next day, the 1st of August, at five o'clock, a boat  should fetch the king to the brig from a little bay, ten minutes' walk  from the house where he was staying. The king spent the night making out  a route for M. Marouin by which he could reach the queen, who was then  in Austria, I think.    It was finished just as it was time to leave, and on crossing the  threshold of the hospitable house where he had found refuge he gave it  to his host, slipped into a volume of a pocket edition of Voltaire.  Below the story of 'Micromegas' the king had written: [The volume is  still in the hands of M. Marouin, at Toulon.]    Reassure yourself, dear Caroline; although unhappy, I am free. I am  departing, but I do not know whither I am bound. Wherever I may be my  heart will be with you and my children. \"J. M.\"    Ten minutes later Murat and his host were waiting on the beach at  Bonette for the boat which was to take them out to the ship.    They waited until midday, and nothing appeared; and yet on the horizon  they could see the brig which was to be his refuge, unable to lie at  anchor on account of the depth of water, sailing along the coast at the  risk of giving the alarm to the sentinels.    At midday the king, worn out with fatigue and the heat of the sun, was  lying on the beach, when a servant arrived, bringing various  refreshments, which Madame Marouin, being very uneasy, had sent at all  hazards to her husband. The king took a glass of wine and water and ate  an orange, and got up for a moment to see whether the boat he was  expecting was nowhere visible on the vastness of the sea. There was not  a boat in sight, only the brig tossing gracefully on the horizon,  impatient to be off, like a horse awaiting its master.    The king sighed and lay down again on the sand.    The servant went back to Bonette with a message summoning M. Marouin's  brother to the beach. He arrived in a few minutes, and almost  immediately afterwards galloped off at full speed to Toulon, in order to  find out from M. Bonafoux why the boat had not been sent to the king. On  reaching the captain's house, he found it occupied by an armed force.  They were making a search for Murat.    The messenger at last made his way through the tumult to the person he  was in search of, and he heard that the boat had started at the  appointed time, and that it must have gone astray in the creeks of Saint  Louis and Sainte Marguerite. This was, in fact, exactly what had  happened.    By five o'clock M. Marouin had reported the news to his brother and the  king. It was bad news. The king had no courage left to defend his life  even by flight, he was in a state of prostration which sometimes  overwhelms the strongest of men, incapable of making any plan for his  own safety, and leaving M. Marouin to do the best he could. Just then a  fisherman was coming into harbour singing. Marouin beckoned to him, and  he came up.    Marouin began by buying all the man's fish; then, when he had paid him  with a few coins, he let some gold glitter before his eyes, and offered  him three louis if he would take a passenger to the brig which was lying  off the Croix-des-Signaux. The fisherman agreed to do it. This chance of  escape gave back Murat all his strength; he got up, embraced Marouin,  and begged him to go to the queen with the volume of Voltaire. Then he  sprang into the boat, which instantly left the shore.    It was already some distance from the land when the king stopped the man  who was rowing and signed to Marouin that he had forgotten something. On  the beach lay a bag into which Murat had put a magnificent pair of  pistols mounted with silver gilt which the queen had given him, and  which he set great store on. As soon as he was within hearing he shouted  his reason for returning to his host. Marouin seized the valise, and  without"]]]
