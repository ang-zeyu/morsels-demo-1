New birds, beasts and fishes, new trees, bushes and  flowers, had to receive names for general use.  It is probably  not too much to say that there never was an instance in history  when so many new names were needed, and that there never will  be such an occasion again, for never did settlers come, nor can  they ever again come, upon Flora and Fauna so completely  different from anything seen by them before.  When the  offshoots of our race first began to settle in America, they  found much that was new, but they were still in the same North  Temperate zone.  Though there is now a considerable divergence  between the American and the English vocabulary, especially in  technical terms, it is not largely due to great differences in  natural history.  An oak in America is still a <i>Quercus</i>,  not as in Australia a <i>Casuarina</i>.  But with the whole  tropical region intervening it was to be expected that in the  South Temperate Zone many things would be different, and such  expectation was amply fulfilled.  In early descriptions of  Australia it is a sort of commonplace to dwell on this complete  variety, to harp on the trees that shed bark not leaves, and  the cherries with the stones outside.  Since the days when  \"Adam gave names to all cattle and to the fowl of the air and  to every beast of the field\" never were so many new names  called for.  Unfortunately, names were not given by the best  educated in the community, but often by those least qualified  to invent satisfactory names: not by a linguist, a botanist, an  ornithologist, an ichthyologist, but by the ordinary settler.  Even in countries of old civilisation names are frequently  conferred or new words invented, at times with good and at  times with unsatisfactory results, by the average man, whom it  is the modern fashion to call \"the man in the street.\"  Much of  Australasian nomenclature is due to \"the man in the bush\"  --more precise address not recorded.  Givers of new names may  be benefactors to their language or violators of its purity and  simplicity, but in either case they are nearly always, like the  burial-place of Moses, unknown.        III.  SOURCES OF NEW WORDS.      Of Australasian additions to the English language there are two  main sources, which correspond to the twofold division of them  into new words and new uses of old words.    1.  Altered English.    The commoner origin of Australasian English words is the  turning and twisting of an already existing English name.  The  settler saw a fruit somewhat like a cherry.  Though he knew  well that it was not a cherry, he christened it the \"native  cherry.\"  It may here be remarked that the prefix native is not  a satisfactory distinguishing adjective.  Native bear, native  cherry, may teach the young Australian that the bear and the  cherry so named are not as the bear of the Arctic Regions or  the cherry of Europe.  But in the British Museum the label does  not help much.  The settler heard a bird laugh in what he  thought an extremely ridiculous manner, its opening notes  suggesting a donkey's bray--he called it the \"laughing  jackass.\"  His descendants have dropped the adjective, and it  has come to pass that the word \"jackass\" denotes to an  Australian something quite different from its meaning to other  speakers of our English tongue.  The settler must have had an  imagination.  Whip-bird, or Coach-whip, from the sound of the  note, Lyre-bird from the appearance of the outspread tail, are  admirable names.    Another class of name brought the Australian word nearer to its  English use.  \"Robin\" for instance is applied to birds of  various species not known in Europe.  Bird-names, fish-names,  plant-names, are sometimes transferred to new species,  sometimes to a new genus, sometimes to an entirely different  Natural Order, bearing a resemblance to the original, either  real or fancied, as for instance \"Magpie.\"  It is hardly  necessary to dwell longer on this point, for almost every page  of the Dictionary bears witness to it.    2. Words new to the Language.    (a) Aboriginal Australian.    Many of the new Australasian words are taken from the languages  of the aborigines, often with considerable alteration due to  misunderstanding.  Such words are either Australian or Maori.  Whilst in New Zealand careful attention has been paid by  competent scholars to the musical Maori language, it can hardly  be claimed that the Australian family of languages has ever  been scientifically studied, though there is a heap of printed  material--small grammars and lists of words--<i>rudis  indigestaque moles</i>.  There is no doubt that the  vocabularies used in different parts of Australia and Tasmania  varied greatly, and equally little doubt that the languages, in  structure and perhaps originally in vocabulary, were more or  less connected.  About the year 1883, Professor Sayce, of  Oxford, wrote a letter, which was published in <i>The  Argus</i>, pointing out the obligation that lay upon the  Australian colonies to make a scientific study of a vanishing  speech.  The duty would be stronger were it not for the  distressing lack of pence that now is vexing public men.  Probably a sum of L300 a year would suffice for an educated  inquirer, but his full time for several years would be needed.  Such an one should be trained at the University as a linguist  and an observer, paying especial attention to logic and to  Comparative Philology.  Whilst the colonies neglect their  opportunities, and Sibylla year by year withdraws her offer,  perhaps \"the inevitable German\" will intervene, and in a  well-arranged book bring order out of the chaos of vocabularies  and small pamphlets on the subject, all that we have to trust  to now.    The need of scientific accuracy is strong.  For the purposes of  this Dictionary I have been investigating the origin of words,  more or less naturalised as English, that come from aboriginal  Australian, in number between seventy and a hundred.  I have  received a great deal of kind assistance, many people taking  much trouble to inform me.  But there is a manifest lack of  knowledge.  Many supplied me with the meanings of the words as  used in English, but though my appeal was scattered far and  wide over Australia (chiefly through the kindness of the  newspapers), few could really give the origin of the words.  Two amongst the best informed went so far as to say that  Australian words have no derivation.  That doctrine is hard to  accept.  A word of three syllables does not spring complete  from the brain of an aboriginal as Athene rose fully armed from  the head of Zeus.    It is beyond all doubt that the vocabularies of the Aborigines  differed widely in different parts.  Frequently, the English  have carried a word known in one district to a district where  it was not known, the aboriginals regarding the word as pure  English.  In several books statements will be found that such  and such a word is not Aboriginal, when it really has an  aboriginal source but in a different part of the Continent.  Mr. Threlkeld, in his <i>Australian Grammar</i>, which is  especially concerned with the language of the Hunter River,  gives a list of \"barbarisms,\" words that he considers do not  belong to the aboriginal tongue.  He says with perfect  truth-\"Barbarisms have crept into use, introduced by sailors,  stockmen, and others, in the use of which both blacks and  whites labour under the mistaken idea, that each one is  conversing in the other's language.\"  And yet with him a  \"barbarism\" has to be qualified as meaning \"not belonging to  the Hunter District.\"  But Mr. Threlkeld is not the only writer  who will not acknowledge as aboriginal sundry words with an  undoubted Australian pedigree.    (b) Maori.    The Maori language, the Italian of the South, has received very  different treatment from that meted out by fate and  indifference to the aboriginal tongues of Australia.  It has  been studied by competent scholars, and its grammar has been  comprehensively arranged and stated.  A Maori Dictionary,  compiled more than fifty years ago by a missionary, afterwards  a bishop, has been issued in a fourth edition by his son, who  is now a bishop.  Yet, of Maori also, the same thing is said  with respect to etymology.  A Maori scholar told me that, when  he began the study many years ago, he was warned by a very  distinguished scholar not to seek for derivations, as the  search was full of pitfalls.  It was not maintained that words  sprang up without an origin, but that the true origin of most  of the words was now lost.  In spite of this double warning, it  may be maintained that some of the origins both of Maori and of  Australian words have been found and are in this book recorded.    The pronunciation of Maori words differs so widely from that of  Australian aboriginal names that it seems advisable to insert a  note on the subject.    Australian aboriginal words have been written down on no  system, and very much at hap-hazard.  English people have  attempted to express the native sounds phonetically according  to English pronunciation.  No definite rule has been observed,  different persons giving totally different values to represent  the consonant and vowel sounds.  In a language with a spelling  so unphonetic as the English, in which the vowels especially  have such uncertain and variable values, the results of this  want of system have necessarily been very unsatisfactory and  often grotesque.  Maori words, on the other hand, have been  written down on a simple and consistent system, adopted by the  missionaries for the purpose of the translation of the Bible.  This system consists in giving the Italian sound to the vowels,  every letter--vowel and consonant--having a fixed and  invariable value.  Maori words are often very melodious.  In  pronunciation the best rule is to pronounce each syllable with  a"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/27995"],[0,"The History of London (#2)"],[1,"58.

The Old Houses of Parliament and Westminster Abbey, 1803         221          LONDON          1. THE FOUNDATION OF LONDON.    PART I.      'In the year 1108 B.C., Brutus, a descendant of AEneas, who was the son  of Venus, came to England with his companions, after the taking of Troy,  and founded the City of Troynovant, which is now called London. After a  thousand years, during which the City grew and flourished exceedingly,  one Lud became its king. He built walls and towers, and, among other  things, the famous gate whose name still survives in the street called  Ludgate. King Lud was succeeded by his brother Cassivelaunus, in whose  time happened the invasion of the Romans under Julius Caesar. Troynovant,  or London, then became a Roman city. It was newly fortified by Helena,  mother of Constantine the Great.'    This is the legend invented or copied by Geoffrey of Monmouth, and  continued to be copied, and perhaps believed, almost to the present day.  Having paid this tribute to old tradition, let us relate the true early  history of the City, as it can be recovered from such documents as  remain, from discoveries made in excavation, from fragments of  architecture, and from the lie of the ground. The testimony derived  from the lie of the ground is more important than any other, for several  reasons. First, an historical document may be false, or inexact; for  instance, the invention of a Brutus, son of AEneas, is false and absurd  on the face of it. Or a document may be wrongly interpreted. Thus, a  fragment of architecture may through ignorance be ascribed to the Roman,  when it belongs to the Norman, period--one needs to be a profound  student of architecture before an opinion of value can be pronounced  upon the age of any monument: or it may be taken to mean something quite  apart from the truth, as if a bastion of the old Roman fort, such as has  been discovered on Cornhill, should be taken for part of the Roman wall.  But the lie of the ground cannot deceive, and, in competent hands,  cannot well be misunderstood. If we know the course of streams, the  height and position of hills, the run of valleys, the site of marshes,  the former extent of forests, the safety of harbours, the existence of  fords, we have in our hands a guide-book to history. We can then  understand why towns were built in certain positions, why trade sprang  up, why invading armies landed at certain places, what course was taken  by armies, and why battles have been fought on certain spots. For these  things are not the result of chance, they are necessitated by the  geographical position of the place, and by the lie of the ground. Why,  for instance, is Dover one of the oldest towns in the country? Because  it is the nearest landing ground for the continent, and because its hill  forms a natural fortress for protecting that landing ground. Why was  there a Roman station at Portsmouth? On account of the great and  landlocked harbour. Why is Durham an ancient city? Because the steep  hill made it almost impregnable. Why is Chester so called? Because it  was from very ancient times a fort, or stationary camp (L. _castra_),  against the wild Welsh.    [Illustration: EARLY BRITISH POTTERY.]    Let us consider this question as regards London. Look at the map called  'Roman London' (p. 15). You will there see flowing into the river Thames  two little streams, one called Walbrook, and the other called the Fleet  River. You will see a steep slope, or cliff, indicated along the river  side. Anciently, before any buildings stood along the bank, this cliff,  about 30 feet high, rose over an immense marsh which covered all the  ground on the south, the east, and the west. The cliff receded from the  river on the east and on the west at this point: on either side of the  Walbrook it rose out of the marsh at the very edge of the river at high  tide. There was thus a double hill, one on the east with the Walbrook on  one side of it, the Thames on a second side, and a marsh on a third  side, and the Fleet River on the west. It was thus bounded on east,  south, and west, by streams. On the north was a wild moor (hence the  name Moorfields) and beyond the moor stretched away northwards a vast  forest, afterwards called the Middlesex forest. This forest covered,  indeed, the greater part of the island, save where marshes and stagnant  lakes lay extended, the haunt of countless wild birds. You may see  portions and fragments of this forest even now; some of it lies in Ken  Wood, Hampstead; some in the last bit left of Hainault Forest; some at  Epping.    The river Thames ran through this marsh. It was then much broader than  at present, because there were no banks or quays to keep it within  limits: at high tide it overflowed the whole of the marsh and lay in an  immense lake, bounded on the north by this low cliff of clay, and on the  south by the rising ground of what we now call the Surrey Hills, which  begin between Kennington and Clapham, as is shown by the name of Clapham  Rise. In this marsh were a few low islets, always above water save at  very high tides. The memory of these islands is preserved in the names  ending with _ea_ or _ey_, as Chelsea, Battersea, Bermondsey. And  Westminster Abbey was built upon the Isle of Thorns or Thorney. The  marsh, south of the river, remained a marsh, undrained and neglected for  many centuries. Almost within the memory of living men Southwark  contained stagnant ponds, while Bermondsey is still flooded when the  tide is higher than is customary.          2. THE FOUNDATION OF LONDON.    PART II.      On these low hillocks marked on the map London was first founded. The  site had many advantages: it was raised above the malarious marsh, it  overlooked the river, which here was at its narrowest, it was protected  by two other streams and by the steepness of the cliff, and it was over  the little port formed by the fall of one stream into the river. Here,  on the western hill, the Britons formed their first settlement; there  were as yet no ships on the silent river where they fished; there was no  ferry, no bridge, no communication with the outer world; the woods  provided the first Londoners with game and skins; the river gave them  fish; they lived in round huts formed of clay and branches with thatched  roofs. If you desire to understand how the Britons fortified themselves,  you may see an excellent example not very far from London. It is the  place called St. George's Hill, near Weybridge. They wanted a hill--the  steeper the side the better: they made it steeper by entrenching it;  they sometimes surrounded it with a high earthwork and sometimes with a  stockade: the great thing being to put the assailing force under the  disadvantage of having to climb. The three river sides of the London  fort presented a perpendicular cliff surmounted by a stockade, the other  side, on which lay the forest, probably had an earthwork also surmounted  by a stockade. There were no buildings and there was no trade; the  people belonged to a tribe and had to go out and fight when war was  carried on with another tribe.    The fort was called Llyn-din--the Lake Fort. When the Romans came they  could not pronounce the word Llyn--Thlin in the British way--and called  it Lon--hence their word Londinium. Presently adventurous merchants from  Gaul pushed across to Dover, and sailed along the coast of Kent past  Sandwich and through the open channel which then separated the island of  Thanet from the main land, into the broad Thames, and, sailing up with  the tide, dropped anchor off the fishing villages which lay along the  river and began to trade. What did they offer? What Captain Cook offered  the Polynesians: weapons, clothes, adornments. What did they take away?  Skins and slaves at first; skins and slaves, and tin and iron, after the  country became better known and its resources were understood. The taste  for trading once acquired rapidly grows; it is a delightful thing to  exchange what you do not want for what you do want, and it is so very  easy to extend one's wants. So that when the Romans first saw London it  was already a flourishing town with a great concourse of merchants.    How long a period elapsed between the foundation of London and the  arrival of the Romans? How long between the foundation and the  beginnings of trade? It is quite impossible even to guess. When Caesar  landed Gauls and Belgians were already here before him. As for the  Britons themselves they were Celts, as were the Gauls and the Belgians,  but of what is called the Brythonic branch, represented in speech by the  Welsh, Breton and Cornish languages (the last is now"]]]
