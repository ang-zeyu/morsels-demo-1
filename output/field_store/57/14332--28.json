To slip,  narrow and bind, slip first stitch, knit next two together, and draw the  slipped stitch over. To cast off or bind off, (Figure 7,) slip 1st  stitch, knit next, draw slipped stitch over, knit next stitch, draw the  previous knitted stitch over, and continue, taking care that the chain  of stitches thus cast off be neither too tight nor too loose, but just  as elastic as the remainder of the work.          A Sleeveless Sweater      [Illustration: A Sleeveless Sweater]    A sleeveless sweater, as pretty as it is comfortable, requires six  skeins of Shetland floss and a pair of No. 5 amber needles. Pink floss  was chosen for the model, but any preferred color may be substituted.    Cast on 85 stitches; knit in basket-stitch, as follows:    1. * Knit 5, purl 5; repeat across, ending with knit 5.    2. Purl 5, knit 5; repeat across, ending with purl 5.    Repeat these two rows twice, making 6 rows in all; then to change the  check knit 7th row like 2d, 8th like 1st, repeat twice, and again change  the check by repeating from 1st row. Continue until the border is five  checks deep, or 30 rows.    Knit across plain and purl back for 84 rows; narrow 1 stitch each side  every other row, three times, for the armhole, leaving 79 stitches on  your needle, and giving 89 rows from the border. Knit across plain and  purl back for 38 rows; putting these stitches on a large safety-pin for  convenience, knit 31, bind off 17 stitches for neck, and on the  remaining 31 stitches, knit 6 rows back and forth, or 3 ribs, to give  the effect of a seam on the shoulder. Continue the front, knitting  across and purling back, adding a stitch toward the front each time to  make the neck V-shaped, for 38 rows; then add 1 stitch at the armhole,  and next row cast on 8 stitches for underarm. Do not widen further  toward the front, but continue knitting forward and purling back for 85  rows; then make the border of 30 rows, five checks wide, to correspond  with the back, and bind off. Knit the other front to correspond.    Pick up the stitches around armhole, 80 in all, and knit 5, purl 5 for 6  rows, making an edge of checks; bind off. Pick up the stitches on front,  to the center of back of neck, about 175 in all, make a row of checks to  correspond with the arm, and bind; work a border in the same way on  other side of front, and sew neatly at back of neck, also join the  underarm seams, taking care to match the checks of the border perfectly.    For the belt: Cast on 25 stitches, and proceed as directed for the  border until you have the desired length; the belt illustrated is 42  checks long. Across one end crochet 3 chain loops, filling these with  doubles, and sew to the other end three pearl buttons to match. The belt  is caught along the top in the back, giving the short-waisted effect.          Costume for the Winter-Girl      [Illustration: Costume for the Winter-Girl]    Materials: Thirteen skeins of Shetland floss (dark rose was used for the  model, but any preferred color may be substituted), three balls of gray  Angora, one pair each of bone knitting-needles, No. 3 and No. 5, and a  steel crochet-hook, No. 6.    For the sweater: Using No. 5 needles, cast on for the back 100 stitches  (these will measure 20 inches). Knit plain, back and forth (which will  give you ridges or ribs) for 2 inches; then decrease a stitch at each  end of needle every 8th row, to shape the back, until there are 76  stitches on the needle, measuring 15 inches (this is the waistline);  knit on these stitches for 9 1/2 inches from the waistline, then  decrease 1 stitch at each end of needle every other row for 3 times, or  until 70 stitches remain, and knit on these stitches until the back  measures 15 1/2 inches from the waistline. Knit 25 stitches off on a  spare needle, bind off 20 stitches for back of neck, and on the other 25  stitches knit one front after the following directions, and the other to  correspond.    Front: Knit in ridges as usual, increasing 1 stitch toward the front  every other row until you have added 6 stitches; cast on 7 stitches more  toward the front, giving 38 stitches on the needle; knit in ridges,  increasing 1 stitch toward armhole every other row until 12 stitches  have been added, then cast on 10 stitches toward the underarm, making 60  stitches on the needle (about 12 inches). Knit on the 60 stitches for  9 1/2 inches, then increase 1 stitch every 8th row toward the underarm-  or side-seam, until the latter is of the same length as that of the  back, including the 2 inches. Do not bind off. Knit other front to  correspond and sew up side-seams.    With a needle pick up 1 stitch from each ridge on front (have an uneven  number of stitches on needle), and on another spare needle pick up the  stitches across the back; on another pick up the stitches of front,  having the same number of stitches on needle; tie a thread in 1st stitch  on needle at bottom of each front, toward the front, which will be the  corner stitch.    1. With bone needles No. 5 start at top of left front, knit 1, * over,  narrow, repeat from * to the corner stitch, over, knit the corner  stitch, again repeat from * to next corner, over, knit corner stitch,  repeat from * until but 1 stitch remains, over, knit last stitch.    2. Knit plain, each \"over\" forming a stitch to take the place of  narrowed one.    3. Knit to corner stitch, over, knit corner stitch, over, knit to next  corner stitch, over, knit corner stitch, over, and knit plain to end of  row.    Repeat 2d and 3d rows until there are 4 ridges or 9 rows from the  beginning.    In next row make the buttonholes thus: Knit 2 stitches from the neck,  bind off 4 stitches for the buttonhole, then knit 13, bind off 4, and  repeat, making 8 buttonholes 13 stitches apart. In next row cast on 4  stitches over where they were bound off, then repeat 2d and 3d rows for  4 more ridges, and bind off.    Sleeves.--Cast on 34 stitches (about 7 1/2 inches); knit in ridges,  casting on 2 stitches at each end of needle every other row until there  are 74 stitches on needle (about 15 inches), knit 1 inch, then decrease  1 stitch at each end of needle every 12th row until there are 56  stitches remaining on needle, knit on these until the sleeves measure 17  inches, or desired length, (knit 1 row, purl 1 row) twice, knit 13  ridges for cuff, then with gray Angora and No. 3 needles knit 7 ridges,  bind off, and sew up sleeves and cuffs.    Collar.--Using the dark rose pick up 84 stitches around neck of sweater  (not the border), knit 30 ridges; do not bind off. With a spare needle  pick up 1 stitch from each ridge on each end of collar; with gray Angora  and No. 3 needles repeat 3d and 2d rows alternately for border until  there are 7 ridges, and bind off.    Pockets.--Cast on 28 stitches; knit in ridges for 4 inches, change to  Angora and No. 3 needles, knit 7 ridges, making a buttonhole in 4th  ridge at center of pocket, bind off and sew the pocket neatly in place  on the sweater. Sew the sleeves in.    Belt.--With dark rose cast on 23 stitches (about 4 1/2 inches), knit in  ridges until the belt is the width of the back at waistline, bind off  and sew in place with two buttons at each side.    Buttons.--With dark rose, chain 3, turn; miss 1 stitch, 8 doubles in  next; 2 doubles in each of 8 doubles; * 2 doubles in 1st double, 1 in  next; repeat from * until the circle is of a size to cover the mold,  work 1 row without widening, slip the mold in, * work around with 1  double in a stitch, miss 1, repeating from last * until closed. If  preferred, a small square may be knitted like the body of the sweater  and used to cover mold.    The skating-cap is 23 inches head-size, and requires three skeins of the  dark-rose floss, two balls of gray Angora wool and 4 steel needles No.  8.    Using the Angora wool, cast on 136 stitches; knit 45 on each of 2  needles and 46 stitches on the 3d, and knit in single rib (knit 1, purl  1) in rounds for 1 1/2 inches, change to the rose floss and knit in  single rib for 1 inch; change to Angora, again knit in single rib for  1 1/2 inches; change to rose floss and knit in single rib until the top  measures 14 1/2 inches, then bind off and draw together, leaving  sufficient opening for the tassel to be sewed in.    Tassel.--Using the rose floss, cut about 40 strands 8 inches long, tie  in the center, fold where tied and tie again below. Sew the tassel at  top of cap.    Scarf.--Materials required are four skeins of dark rose Shetland floss,  two balls of gray Angora wool, and one pair each of No. 3 and No. 5 bone  knitting-needles. With gray Angora wool and No. 3 needles cast on 60  stitches, and knit 7 ridges; change to rose floss and No. 5 needles and  knit 7 ridges, change to Angora wool and No. 3 needles, and again knit 7  ridges, change to rose floss and No. 5 needles and knit for 50 inches,  or length of scarf desired; then, as at beginning, knit 7 ridges of  Angora, 7 ridges of rose and again 7 ridges of Angora; bind off.    Knitted Gloves.--Materials required are three skeins of Shetland floss,  and four steel knitting-needles, No. 12. Use two threads of the floss at  once.    Cast 16 stitches on each of 3 needles. Knit in single rib (knit 1, purl  1) for 44 rounds, or until the wrist is as long as desired, then knit 16  rounds plain.    61. Knit to within 4 stitches of end of round, widen 1, knit 4, widen 1.    62, 63, 64, 65. Knit plain.    Repeat the last 5 rounds, increasing 2 stitches every 5th round until  you have 10 stitches between the two widening points, and 58 stitches on  the needles.    To form the thumb, knit 7 stitches on each of 2 needles and cast on 4  stitches between the widening points, thus making 18 stitches on 3  needles.    Knit 22 rounds plain. * Narrow, knit 1; repeat around; knit 1 round  plain; repeat from *.

(#2)"],[1,"task of the daughters of Jethro the  Midianite; to whom so little regard was paid, either on account of their  sex, or the rank of their father, as high priest of the country, that  the neighboring shepherds not only insulted them, but forcibly took from  them the water they had drawn.    This was the task of Rebecca, who not only drew water for Abraham's  servant, but for his camels also, while the servant stood an idle  spectator of the toil. Is it not natural to imagine, that, as he was on  an embassy to court the damsel for Isaac, his master's son, he would  have exerted his utmost efforts to please, and become acceptable?    When he had concluded his bargain, and was carrying her home, we meet  with a circumstance worthy of remark. When she first approached Isaac,  who had walked out into the fields to meet her, she did it in the most  submissive manner, as if she had been approaching a lord and master,  rather than a fond and passionate lover. From this circumstance, as well  as from several others, related in the sacred history, it would seem  that women, instead of endeavoring, as in modern times, to persuade the  world that they confer an immense favor on a lover, by deigning to  accept of him, did not scruple to confess, that the obligation was  conferred on themselves.    This was the case with Ruth, who had laid herself down at the feet of  Boaz; and being asked by him who she was, answered, \"I am Ruth, thine  handmaid; spread, therefore, thy skirt over thine handmaid, for thou art  a near kinsman.\"    When Jacob went to visit his uncle Laban, he met Rachel, Laban's  daughter, in the fields, attending on the flocks of her father.    In a much later period, Tamar, one of the daughters of king David, was  sent by her father to perform the servile office of making cakes for her  brother Amnon.    The simplicity of the times in which these things happened, no doubt,  very much invalidates the strength of the conclusions that naturally  arise from them. But, notwithstanding, it still appears that women were  not then treated with the delicacy which they have experienced among  people more polished and refined.    Polygamy also prevailed; which is so contrary to the inclination of the  sex, and so deeply wounds the delicacy of their feelings, that it is  impossible for any woman voluntarily to agree to it, even where it is  authorized by custom and by law. Wherever, therefore, polygamy takes  place, we may assure ourselves that women have but little authority, and  have scarcely arrived at any consequence in society.      WOMEN OF ANCIENT EGYPT.    Wherever the human race live solitary, and unconnected with each other,  they are savage and barbarous. Wherever they associate together, that  association produces softer manners and a more engaging deportment.    The Egyptians, from the nature of their country, annually overflowed by  the Nile, had no wild beasts to hunt, nor could they procure any thing  by fishing. On these accounts, they were under a necessity of applying  themselves to agriculture, a kind of life which naturally brings mankind  together, for mutual convenience and assistance.    They were, likewise, every year, during the inundation of the river,  obliged to assemble together, and take shelter, either on the rising  grounds, or in the houses, which were raised upon piles, above the reach  of the waters. Here, almost every employment being suspended, and the  men and women long confined together, a thousand inducements, not to be  found in a solitary state, would naturally prompt them to render  themselves agreeable to each other. Hence their manners would begin,  more early, to assume a softer polish, and more elegant refinement, than  those of the other nations who surrounded them.    The practice of confining women, instituted by jealousy, and maintained  by unlawful power, was not adopted by the ancient Egyptians. This  appears from the story of Pharaoh's daughter, who was going with her  train of maids to bathe in the river, when she found Moses hid among the  reeds. It is still more evident, from that of the wife of Potiphar, who,  if she had been confined, could not have found the opportunities she  did, to solicit Joseph to her adulterous embrace.    The queens of Egypt had the greatest attention paid to them. They were  more readily obeyed than the kings. It is also related, that the  husbands were in their marriage-contracts, obliged to promise obedience  to their wives; an obedience, which, in our modern times, we are often  obliged to perform, though our wives entered into the promise.    The behavior of Solomon to Pharaoh's daughter is a convincing proof that  more honor and respect was paid to the Egyptian women, than to those of  any other people. Solomon had many other wives besides this princess,  and was married to several of them before her, which, according to the  Jewish law, ought to have entitled them to a preference. But,  notwithstanding this, we hear of no particular palace having been built  for any of the others, nor of the worship of any of their gods having  been introduced into Jerusalem. But a magnificent palace was erected for  Pharaoh's daughter; and she was permitted, though expressly contrary to  the laws of Israel, to worship the gods of her own country.      MODERN EGYPTIAN WOMEN.    The women of modern Egypt are far from being on so respectable a  footing as they were in ancient times, or as the European women are at  present.    In Europe, women act parts of great consequence, and often reign  sovereigns on the world's vast theatre. They influence manners and  morals, and decide on the most important events. The fate of nations is  frequently in their hands.    How different is their situation in Egypt! There they are bound down by  the fetters of slavery, condemned to servitude, and have no influence in  public affairs. Their empire is confined within the walls of the Harem.  There are their graces and charms entombed. The circle of their life  extends not beyond their own family and domestic duties.    Their first care is to educate their children; and a numerous posterity  is their most fervent wish. Mothers always suckle their children. This  is expressly commanded by Mahomet:--\"Let the mother suckle her child  full two years, if the child does not quit the breast; but she shall be  permitted to wean it, with the consent of her husband.\"    The harem is the cradle and school of infancy. The new born feeble being  is not there swaddled and filletted up in a swathe, the source of a  thousand diseases. Laid naked on a mat, exposed in a vast chamber to the  pure air, he breathes freely, and with his delicate limbs sprawls at  pleasure.    The daughter's education is the same. Whalebone and husks, which martyr  European girls, they know not. They are only covered with a shift until  six years old: and the dress they afterwards wear confines none of their  limbs, but suffers the body to take its true form; and nothing is more  uncommon than ricketty children, and crooked people. In Egypt, man rises  in all his majesty, and woman displays every charm of person.    The Egyptian women, once or twice a week, are permitted to go to the  bath, and visit female relations and friends. They receive each other's  visits very affectionately. When a lady enters the harem, the mistress  rises, takes her hand, presses it to her bosom, kisses, and makes her  sit down by her side; a slave hastens to take her black mantle; she is  entreated to be at ease, quits her veil, and discovers a floating robe  tied round her waist with a sash, which perfectly displays her shape.  She then receives compliments according to their manner: \"Why, my  mother, or my sister, have you been so long absent? We sighed to see  you! Your presence is an honor to our house! It is the happiness of our  lives!\"    Slaves present coffee, sherbet, and confectionary. They laugh, talk and  play. A large dish is placed on the sofa, on which are oranges,  pomegranates, bananas, and excellent melons. Water, and rose-water  mixed, are brought in an ewer, and with them a silver bason to wash the  hands; and loud glee and merry conversation season the meal. The chamber  is perfumed by wood of aloes, in a brazier; and, the repast ended, the  slaves dance to the sound of cymbals, with whom the mistresses often  mingle. At parting they several times repeat, \"God keep you in health!  Heaven grant you a numerous offspring! Heaven preserve your children;  the delight and glory of your family!\"    When a visitor is in the harem, the husband must not enter. It is the  asylum of hospitality, and cannot be violated without fatal  consequences; a cherished right, which the Egyptian women carefully  maintain, being interested in its preservation. A lover, disguised like  a woman, may be introduced into the harem, and it is necessary he should  remain undiscovered; death would otherwise be his reward. In that  country, where the passions are excited by the climate, and the  difficulty of gratifying them is great, love often produces tragical  events.      PERSIAN WOMEN.    Several historians, in mentioning the ancient Persians, have dwelt with  peculiar severity on the manner in which they treated their women.  Jealous, almost to distraction, they confined the whole sex with the  strictest attention, and could not bear that the eye of a stranger  should behold the beauty whom they adored.    When Mahomet, the great legislator of the modern Persians, was just  expiring, the last advice that he gave to his faithful adherents, was,  \"Be watchful of your religion, and your wives.\" Hence they pretend to  derive not only the power of confining, but also of persuading them,  that they hazard their salvation, if they look upon any other man  besides their husbands. The Christian religion informs us, that in the  other world they neither marry, nor are given in marriage. The religion  of Mahomet teaches us a different"]]]
