Ten Years Later (Etext 2681): As 1661 approaches, Princess Henrietta of  England arrives for her marriage, and throws the court of France into  complete disorder. The jealousy of the Duke of Buckingham, who is  in love with her, nearly occasions a war on the streets of Le Havre,  thankfully prevented by Raoul's timely and tactful intervention. After  the marriage, though, Monsieur Philip becomes horribly jealous of  Buckingham, and has him exiled. Before leaving, however, the duke  fights a duel with M. de Wardes at Calais. De Wardes is a malicious and  spiteful man, the sworn enemy of D'Artagnan, and, by the same token,  that of Athos, Aramis, Porthos, and Raoul as well. Both men are  seriously wounded, and the duke is taken back to England to recover.  Raoul's friend, the Comte de Guiche, is the next to succumb to  Henrietta's charms, and Monsieur obtains his exile as well, though De  Guiche soon effects a reconciliation. But then the king's eye falls on  Madame Henrietta during the comte's absence, and this time Monsieur's  jealousy has no recourse. Anne of Austria intervenes, and the king and  his sister-in-law decide to pick a young lady with whom the king  can pretend to be in love, the better to mask their own affair. They  unfortunately select Louise de la Valliere, Raoul's fiancee. While the  court is in residence at Fontainebleau, the king unwitting overhears  Louise confessing her love for him while chatting with her friends  beneath the royal oak, and the king promptly forgets his affection for  Madame. That same night, Henrietta overhears, at the same oak, De  Guiche confessing his love for her to Raoul. The two embark on their  own affair. A few days later, during a rainstorm, Louis and Louise  are trapped alone together, and the whole court begins to talk of the  scandal while their love affair blossoms. Aware of Louise's attachment,  the king arranges for Raoul to be sent to England for an indefinite  period.    Meanwhile, the struggle for power continues between Fouquet and Colbert.  Although the Belle-Isle plot backfired, Colbert prompts the king to ask  Fouquet for more and more money, and without his two friends to raise it  for him, Fouquet is sorely pressed. The situation gets so bad that his  new mistress, Madame de Belliere, must resort to selling all her jewels  and her gold and silver plate. Aramis, while this is going on, has grown  friendly with the governor of the Bastile, M. de Baisemeaux, a fact that  Baisemeaux unwittingly reveals to D'Artagnan while inquiring of him  as to Aramis's whereabouts. This further arouses the suspicions of the  musketeer, who was made to look ridiculous by Aramis. He had ridden  overnight at an insane pace, but arrived a few minutes after Fouquet  had already presented Belle-Isle to the king. Aramis learns from the  governor the location of a mysterious prisoner, who bears a remarkable  resemblance to Louis XIV--in fact, the two are identical. He uses  the existence of this secret to persuade a dying Franciscan monk, the  general of the society of the Jesuits, to name him, Aramis, the new  general of the order. On Aramis's advice, hoping to use Louise's  influence with the king to counteract Colbert's influence, Fouquet also  writes a love letter to La Valliere, unfortunately undated. It never  reaches its destination, however, as the servant ordered to deliver it  turns out to be an agent of Colbert's.    Louise de la Valliere (Etext 2710): Believing D'Artagnan occupied at  Fontainebleau and Porthos safely tucked away at Paris, Aramis holds a  funeral for the dead Franciscan--but in fact, Aramis is wrong in both  suppositions. D'Artagnan has left Fontainebleau, bored to tears by  the _fetes_, retrieved Porthos, and is visiting the country-house of  Planchet, his old lackey. This house happens to be right next door  to the graveyard, and upon observing Aramis at this funeral, and his  subsequent meeting with a mysterious hooded lady, D'Artagnan, suspicions  aroused, resolves to make a little trouble for the bishop. He presents  Porthos to the king at the same time as Fouquet presents Aramis, thereby  surprising the wily prelate. Aramis's professions of affection and  innocence do only a little to allay D'Artagnan's concerns, and he  continues to regard Aramis's actions with a curious and wary eye.  Meanwhile, much to his delight, Porthos is invited to dine with the king  as a result of his presentation, and with D'Artagnan's guidance, manages  to behave in such a manner as to procure the king's marked favor.    The mysterious woman turns out to be the Duchesse de Chevreuse, a  notorious schemer and former friend of Anne of Austria. She comes  bearing more bad news for Fouquet, who is already in trouble, as the  king has invited himself to a _fete_ at Vaux, Fouquet's magnificent  mansion, that will surely bankrupt the poor superintendent. The Duchesse  has letters from Mazarin that prove that Fouquet has received thirteen  million francs from the royal coffers, and she wishes to sell these  letters to Aramis. Aramis refuses, and the letters are instead sold to  Colbert. Fouquet, meanwhile, discovers that the receipt that proves his  innocence in the affair has been stolen from him. Even worse, Fouquet,  desperate for money, is forced to sell the parliamentary position that  renders him untouchable by any court proceedings. As part of her deal  with Colbert, though, Chevreuse also obtains a secret audience with the  queen-mother, where the two discuss a shocking secret--Louis XIV has a  twin brother, long believed, however, to be dead.    Meanwhile, in other quarters, De Wardes, Raoul's inveterate enemy, has  returned from Calais, barely recovered from his wounds, and no sooner  does he return than he begins again to insult people, particularly La  Valliere, and this time the comte de Guiche is the one to challenge him.  The duel leaves De Guiche horribly wounded, but enables Madame to use  her influence to destroy De Wardes's standing at court. The _fetes_,  however, come to an end, and the court returns to Paris. The king has  been more than obvious about his affections for Louise, and Madame,  the queen-mother, and the queen join forces to destroy her. She is  dishonorably discharged from court, and in despair, she flees to the  convent at Chaillot. Along the way, though, she runs into D'Artagnan,  who manages to get word back to the king of what has taken place. By  literally begging Madame in tears, Louis manages to secure Louise's  return to court--but Madame still places every obstacle possible before  the lovers. They have to resort to building a secret staircase and  meeting in the apartments of M. de Saint-Aignan, where Louis has a  painter create a portrait of Louise. But Madame recalls Raoul from  London and shows him these proofs of Louise's infidelity. Raoul,  crushed, challenges Saint-Aignan to a duel, which the king prevents,  and Athos, furious, breaks his sword before the king. The king has  D'Artagnan arrest Athos, and at the Bastile they encounter Aramis, who  is paying Baisemeaux another visit. Raoul learns of Athos's arrest,  and with Porthos in tow, they effect a daring rescue, surprising the  carriage containing D'Artagnan and Athos as they leave the Bastile.  Although quite impressive, the intrepid raid is in vain, as D'Artagnan  has already secured Athos's pardon from the king. Instead, everybody  switches modes of transport; D'Artagnan and Porthos take the horses back  to Paris, and Athos and Raoul take the carriage back to La Fere, where  they intend to reside permanently, as the king is now their sworn enemy,  Raoul cannot bear to see Louise, and they have no more dealings in  Paris.    Aramis, left alone with Baisemeaux, inquires the governor of the prison  about his loyalties, in particular to the Jesuits. The bishop reveals  that he is a confessor of the society, and invokes their regulations  in order to obtain access to this mysterious prisoner who bears such a  striking resemblance to Louis XIV...    And so Baisemeaux is conducting Aramis to the prisoner as the final  section of The Vicomte de Bragelonne and this final story of the  D'Artagnan Romances opens. I have written a \"Cast of Historical  Characters,\" Etext 2760, that will enable curious readers to compare  personages in the novel with their historical counterparts. Also of  interest may be an essay Dumas wrote on the possible identity of the  real Man in the Iron Mask, which is Etext 2751. Enjoy!    John Bursey Mordaunt@aol.com August, 2000    *****          Chapter I. The Prisoner.    Since Aramis's singular transformation into a confessor of the order,  Baisemeaux was no longer the same man. Up to that period, the place  which Aramis had held in the worthy governor's estimation was that of  a prelate whom he respected and a friend to whom he owed a debt of  gratitude; but now he felt himself an inferior, and that Aramis was  his master. He himself lighted a lantern, summoned a turnkey, and said,  returning to Aramis, \"I am at your orders, monseigneur.\" Aramis merely  nodded his head, as much as to say, \"Very good\"; and signed to him with  his hand to lead the way. Baisemeaux advanced, and Aramis followed him.  It was a calm and lovely starlit night; the steps of three men resounded  on the flags of the terraces, and the clinking of the keys hanging from  the jailer's girdle made itself heard up to the stories of the towers,  as if to remind the prisoners that the liberty of earth was a luxury  beyond their reach. It might have been said that the alteration effected  in Baisemeaux extended even to the prisoners. The turnkey, the same who,  on Aramis's first arrival had shown himself so inquisitive and curious,  was now not only silent, but impassible. He held his head down, and  seemed afraid to keep his ears open. In this wise they reached the  basement of the Bertaudiere, the two first"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/27600"],[0,"Zoonomia; Or, the Laws of Organic Life, Vol. II (#2)"],[1,"contractions of animal fibres; and  therefore in true language cannot be termed their remote causes. From this  criterion it may always be determined, whether more diseases than one are  comprehended under one name; a circumstance which has much impeded the  investigation of the causes, and cures of diseases.    Thus the term fever, is generally given to a collection of morbid symptoms;  which are indeed so many distinct diseases, that sometimes appear together,  and sometimes separately; hence it has no determinate meaning, except it  signifies simply a quick pulse, which continues for some hours; in which  sense it is here used.    In naming diseases I have endeavoured to avoid the affectation of making  new compound Greek words, where others equally expressive could be  procured: as a short periphrasis is easier to be understood, and less  burthensome to the memory.    In the Methodus Medendi, which is marked by M.M. at the end of many of the  species of diseases, the words incitantia, sorbentia, torpentia, &c. refer  to the subsequent articles of the Materia Medica, explaining the operations  of medicines.    The remote causes of many diseases, their periods, and many circumstances  concerning them, are treated of in the preceding volume; the descriptions  of many of them, which I have omitted for the sake of brevity, may be seen  in the Nosologia Methodica of Sauvages, and in the Synopsis Nosologiae of  Dr. Cullen, and in the authors to which they refer.    In this arduous undertaking the author solicits the candour of the critical  reader; as he cannot but foresee, that many errors will be discovered, many  additional species will require to be inserted; and others to be  transplanted, or erased. If he could expend another forty years in the  practice of medicine, he makes no doubt, but that he could bring this work  nearer perfection, and thence render it more worthy the attention of  philosophers.----As it is, he is induced to hope, that some advantages will  be derived from it to the science of medicine, and consequent utility to  the public, and leaves the completion of his plan to the industry of future  generations.
