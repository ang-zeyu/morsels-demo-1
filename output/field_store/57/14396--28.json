Thales believed  the Earth to be the centre of the universe, and that the stars were  composed of fire; he also predicted the occurrence of a great solar  eclipse.    Thales had for his successors Anaximander, Anaximenes, and Anaxagoras,  who taught the doctrines of the Ionian school.    The next great astronomer that we read of is PYTHAGORAS, who was born at  Samos 590 B.C. He studied under Thales, and afterwards visited Egypt and  India, in order that he might make himself familiar with the scientific  theories adopted by those nations. On his return to Europe he founded  his school in Italy, and taught in a more extended form the doctrines of  the Ionian school. In his speculations with regard to the structure of  the universe he propounded the theory (though the reasons by which he  sustained it were fanciful) that the Sun is the centre of the planetary  system, and that the Earth revolves round him. This theory--the accuracy  of which has since been confirmed--received but little attention from  his successors, and it sank into oblivion until the time of Copernicus,  by whom it was revived. Pythagoras discovered that the Morning and  Evening Stars are one and the same planet.    Among the famous astronomers who lived about this period we find  recorded the names of Meton, who introduced the Metonic cycle into  Greece and erected the first sundial at Athens; Eudoxus, who persuaded  the Greeks to adopt the year of 365-1/4 days; and Nicetas, who taught  that the Earth completed a daily revolution on her axis.    The Alexandrian school, which flourished for three centuries prior to  the Christian era, produced men of eminence whose discoveries and  investigations, when arranged and classified, enabled astronomy to be  regarded as a true theoretical science. The positions of the fixed stars  and the paths of the planets were determined with greater accuracy, and  irregularities of the motions of the Sun and Moon were investigated with  greater precision. Attempts were made to ascertain the distance of the  Sun from the Earth, and also the dimensions of the terrestrial sphere.  The obliquity of the ecliptic was accurately determined, and an arc of  the meridian was measured between Syene and Alexandria. The names of  Aristarchus, Eratosthenes, Aristyllus, Timocharis, and Autolycus, are  familiarly known in association with the advancement of the astronomy of  this period.    We now reach the name of HIPPARCHUS of Bithynia (140 B.C.), the most  illustrious astronomer of antiquity, who did much to raise astronomy to  the position of a true science, and who has also left behind him ample  evidence of his genius 'as a mathematician, an observer, and a  theorist.' We are indebted to him for the earliest star catalogue, in  which he included 1,081 stars. He discovered the Precession of the  Equinoxes, and determined the motions of the Sun and Moon, and also the  length of the year, with greater precision than any of his predecessors.  He invented the sciences of plane and spherical trigonometry, and was  the first to use right ascensions and declinations.    The next astronomer of eminence after Hipparchus was PTOLEMY (130 A.D.),  who resided at Alexandria. He was skilled as a mathematician and  geographer, and also excelled as a musician. His chief discovery was an  irregularity of the lunar motion, called the '_evection_.' He was also  the first to observe the effect of the refraction of light in causing  the apparent displacement of a heavenly body from its true position.  Ptolemy devoted much of his time to extending and improving the theories  of Hipparchus, and compiled a great treatise, called the 'Almagest,'  which contains nearly all the knowledge we possess of ancient astronomy.  Ptolemy's name is, however, most widely known in association with what  is called the Ptolemaic theory. This system, which originated long  before his time, but of which he was one of the ablest expounders, was  an attempt to establish on a scientific basis the conclusions and  results arrived at by early astronomers who studied and observed the  motions of the heavenly bodies. Ptolemy regarded the Earth as the  immovable centre of the universe, round which the Sun, Moon, planets,  and the entire heavens completed a daily revolution in twenty-four  hours. After the death of Ptolemy no worthy successor was found to  occupy his place, the study of astronomy began to decline among the  Greeks, and after a time it ceased to be cultivated by that people.    The Arabs next took up the study of astronomy, which they prosecuted  most assiduously for a period of four centuries. Their labours were,  however, confined chiefly to observational work, in which they  excelled; unlike their predecessors, they paid but little attention to  speculative theories--indeed, they regarded with such veneration the  opinions held by the Greeks, that they did not feel disposed to question  the accuracy of their doctrines. The most eminent astronomer among the  Arabs was ALBATEGNIUS (680 A.D.). He corrected the Greek observations,  and made several discoveries which testified to his abilities as an  observer. IBN YUNIS and ABUL WEFU were Arab astronomers who earned a  high reputation on account of the number and accuracy of their  observations. In Persia, a descendant of the famous Genghis Khan erected  an observatory, where astronomical observations were systematically  made. Omar, a Persian astronomer, suggested a reformation of the  calendar which, if it had been adopted, would have insured greater  accuracy than can be attained by the Gregorian style now in use. In  1433, Ulugh Beg, who resided at Samarcand, made many observations, and  constructed a star catalogue of greater exactness than was known to  exist prior to his time. The Arabs may be regarded as having been the  custodians of astronomy until the time of its revival in another quarter  of the Globe.    After the lapse of many centuries, astronomy was introduced into Western  Europe in 1220, and from that date to the present time its career has  been one of triumphant progress. In 1230, a translation of Ptolemy's  'Almagest' from Arabic into Latin was accomplished by order of the  German Emperor, Frederick II.; and in 1252 Alphonso X., King of Castile,  himself a zealous patron of astronomy, caused a new set of astronomical  tables to be constructed at his own expense, which, in honour of his  Majesty, were called the 'Alphonsine Tables.' Purbach and Regiomontanus,  two German astronomers of distinguished reputation, and Waltherus, a man  of considerable renown, made many important observations in the  fifteenth century.    The most eminent astronomer who lived during the latter part of this  century was Copernicus. NICOLAS COPERNICUS was born February 19, 1473,  at Thorn, a small town situated on the Vistula, which formed the  boundary between the kingdoms of Prussia and Poland. His father was a  Polish subject, and his mother of German extraction. Having lost his  parents early in life, he was educated under the supervision of his  uncle Lucas, Bishop of Ermland. Copernicus attended a school at Thorn,  and afterwards entered the University of Cracow, in 1491, where he  devoted four years to the study of mathematics and science. On leaving  Cracow he attached himself to the University of Bologna as a student of  canon law, and attended a course of lectures on astronomy given by  Novarra. In the ensuing year he was appointed canon of Frauenburg, the  cathedral city of the Diocese of Ermland, situated on the shores of the  Frisches Haff. In the year 1500 he was at Rome, where he lectured on  mathematics and astronomy. He next spent a few years at the University  of Padua, where, besides applying himself to mathematics and astronomy,  he studied medicine and obtained a degree. In 1505 Copernicus returned  to his native country, and was appointed medical attendant to his uncle,  the Bishop of Ermland, with whom he resided in the stately castle of  Heilsberg, situated at a distance of forty-six miles from Frauenburg.  Copernicus lived with his uncle from 1507 till 1512, and during that  time prosecuted his astronomical studies, and undertook, besides, many  arduous duties associated with the administration of the diocese; these  he faithfully discharged until the death of the Bishop, which occurred  in 1512. After the death of his uncle he took up his residence at  Frauenburg, where he occupied his time in meditating on his new  astronomy and undertaking various duties of a public character, which he  fulfilled with credit and distinction. In 1523 he was appointed  Administrator-General of the diocese. Though a canon of Frauenburg,  Copernicus never became a priest.    After many years of profound meditation and thought, Copernicus, in a  treatise entitled 'De Revolutionibus Orbium Celestium,' propounded a new  theory, or, more correctly speaking, revived the ancient Pythagorean  system of the universe. This great work, which he dedicated to Pope Paul  III., was completed in 1530; but he could not be prevailed upon to have  it published until 1543, the year in which he died. In 1542 Copernicus  had an apoplectic seizure, followed by paralysis and a gradual decay of  his mental and vital powers. His book was printed at Nuremberg, and the  first copy arrived at Frauenburg on May 24, 1543, in time to be touched  by the hands of the dying man, who in a few hours after expired. The  house in which Copernicus lived at Allenstein is still in existence, and  in the walls of his chamber are visible the perforations which he made  for the purpose of observing the stars cross the meridian.    Copernicus was the means of creating an entire revolution in the science  of astronomy, by transferring the centre of our system from the Earth to  the Sun. He accounted for the alternation of day and night by the  rotation of the Earth on her axis, and for the "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/28458"],[0,"What a Young Woman Ought to Know (#2)"],[1,"to know how to obtain  it--The question of diet--We eat to repair waste and to supply  new material--Overstudy less a cause of illness than wrong  eating--Tea and coffee not foods--Alcoholic beverages  interfere with digestion--Dyspepsia produced by worry--We  should give ourselves to our friends--Young women should study  scientific cookery                                                  33    CHAPTER IV.
