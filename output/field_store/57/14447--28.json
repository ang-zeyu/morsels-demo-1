It  carries a death-dealing armor to protect it from its enemies, and it  can climb the nearest hemlock tree and live on the bark all winter.  The skunk, too, pays for its terrible weapon by dull wits. But think  of the wit of the much-hunted fox, the much-hunted otter, the  much-sought beaver! Even the grouse, when often fired at, learns, when  it is started in the open, to fly with a corkscrew motion to avoid the  shot.    Fear, love, and hunger were the agents that developed the wits of the  lower animals, as they were, of course, the prime factors in  developing the intelligence of man. But man has gone on, while the  animals have stopped at these fundamental wants,--the need of safety,  of offspring, of food.    Probably in a state of wild nature birds never make mistakes, but  where they come in contact with our civilization and are confronted by  new conditions, they very naturally make mistakes. For instance, their  cunning in nest-building sometimes deserts them. The art of the bird  is to conceal its nest both as to position and as to material, but now  and then it is betrayed into weaving into its structure showy and  bizarre bits of this or that, which give its secret away, and which  seem to violate all the traditions of its kind. I have the picture of  a robin's nest before me, upon the outside of which are stuck a muslin  flower, a leaf from a small calendar, and a photograph of a local  celebrity. A more incongruous use of material in bird architecture it  would be hard to find. I have been told of another robin's nest upon  the outside of which the bird had fastened a wooden label from a  near-by flower-bed, marked \"Wake Robin.\" Still another nest I have  seen built upon a large, showy foundation of the paper-like flowers of  antennaria, or everlasting. The wood thrush frequently weaves a  fragment of newspaper or a white rag into the foundation of its nest.  \"Evil communications corrupt good manners.\" The newspaper and the  rag-bag unsettle the wits of the birds. The phoebe-bird is capable  of this kind of mistake or indiscretion. All the past generations of  her tribe have built upon natural and, therefore, neutral sites,  usually under shelving and overhanging rocks, and the art of adapting  the nest to its surroundings, blending it with them, has been highly  developed. But phoebe now frequently builds under our sheds and  porches, where, so far as concealment is concerned, a change of  material, say from moss to dry grass or shreds of bark, would be an  advantage to her; but she departs not a bit from the family  traditions; she uses the same woodsy mosses, which in some cases,  especially when the nest is placed upon newly sawed timber, make her  secret an open one to all eyes.    It does indeed often look as if the birds had very little sense. Think  of a bluebird, or an oriole, or a robin, or a jay, fighting for hours  at a time its own image as reflected in a pane of glass; quite  exhausting itself in its fury to demolish its supposed rival! Yet I  have often witnessed this little comedy. It is another instance of how  the arts of our civilization corrupt and confuse the birds. It may be  that in the course of many generations the knowledge of glass will get  into their blood, and they will cease to be fooled by it, as they may  also in time learn what a poor foundation the newspaper is to build  upon. The ant or the bee could not be fooled by the glass in that way  for a moment.    _Have_ the birds and our other wild neighbors sense, as distinguished  from instinct? Is a change of habits to meet new conditions, or the  taking advantage of accidental circumstances, an evidence of sense?  How many birds appear to have taken advantage of the protection  afforded by man in building their nests! How many of them build near  paths and along roadsides, to say nothing of those that come close to  our dwellings! Even the quail seems to prefer the borders of the  highway to the open fields. I have chanced upon only three quails'  nests, and these were all by the roadside. One season a scarlet  tanager that had failed with her first nest in the woods came to try  again in a little cherry tree that stood in the open, a few feet from  my cabin, where I could almost touch the nest with my hand as I  passed. But in my absence she again came to grief, some marauder,  probably a red squirrel, taking her eggs. Will her failure in this  case cause her to lose faith in the protective influence of the shadow  of a human dwelling? I hope not. I have known the turtle dove to make  a similar move, occupying an old robin's nest near my neighbor's  cottage. The timid rabbit will sometimes come up from the bushy fields  and excavate a place for her nest in the lawn a few feet from the  house. All such things look like acts of judgment, though they may be  only the result of a greater fear overcoming a lesser fear.    It is in the preservation of their lives and of their young that the  wild creatures come the nearest to showing what we call sense or  reason. The boys tell me that a rabbit that has been driven from her  hole a couple of times by a ferret will not again run into it when  pursued. The tragedy of a rabbit pursued by a mink or a weasel may  often be read upon our winter snows. The rabbit does not take to her  hole; it would be fatal. And yet, though capable of far greater speed,  so far as I have observed, she does not escape the mink; he very soon  pulls her down. It would look as though a fatal paralysis, the  paralysis of utter fear, fell upon the poor creature as soon as she  found herself hunted by this subtle, bloodthirsty enemy. I have seen  upon the snow where her jumps had become shorter and shorter, with  tufts of fur marking each stride, till the bloodstains, and then her  half-devoured body, told the whole tragic story.    There is probably nothing in human experience, at this age of the  world, that is like the helpless terror that seizes the rabbits as it  does other of our lesser wild creatures, when pursued by any of the  weasel tribe. They seem instantly to be under some fatal spell which  binds their feet and destroys their will power. It would seem as if a  certain phase of nature from which we get our notions of fate and  cruelty had taken form in the weasel.    The rabbit, when pursued by the fox or by the dog, quickly takes to  hole. Hence, perhaps, the wit of the fox that a hunter told me about.  The story was all written upon the snow. A mink was hunting a rabbit,  and the fox, happening along, evidently took in the situation at a  glance. He secreted himself behind a tree or a rock, and, as the  rabbit came along, swept her from her course like a charge of shot  fired at close range, hurling her several feet over the snow, and then  seizing her and carrying her to his den up the mountain-side.    It would be interesting to know how long our chimney swifts saw the  open chimney-stacks of the early settlers beneath them before they  abandoned the hollow trees in the woods and entered the chimneys for  nesting and roosting purposes. Was the act an act of judgment, or  simply an unreasoning impulse, like so much else in the lives of the  wild creatures?    In the choice of nesting-material the swift shows no change of habit.  She still snips off the small dry twigs from the tree-tops and glues  them together, and to the side of the chimney, with her own glue. The  soot is a new obstacle in her way, that she does not yet seem to have  learned to overcome, as the rains often loosen it and cause her nest  to fall to the bottom. She has a pretty way of trying to frighten you  off when your head suddenly darkens the opening above her. At such  times she leaves the nest and clings to the side of the chimney near  it. Then, slowly raising her wings, she suddenly springs out from the  wall and back again, making as loud a drumming with them in the  passage as she is capable of. If this does not frighten you away, she  repeats it three or four times. If your face still hovers above her,  she remains quiet and watches you.    What a creature of the air this bird is, never touching the ground,  so far as I know, and never tasting earthly food! The swallow does  perch now and then and descend to the ground for nesting-material;  but the swift, I have reason to believe, even outrides the summer  storms, facing them on steady wing, high in air. The twigs for her  nest she gathers on the wing, sweeping along like children on a  \"merry-go-round\" who try to seize a ring, or to do some other feat, as  they pass a given point. If the swift misses the twig, or it fails to  yield to her the first time, she tries again and again, each time  making a wider circuit, as if to tame and train her steed a little  and bring him up more squarely to the mark next time.    The swift is a stiff flyer: there appear to be no joints in her wings;  she suggests something made of wires or of steel. Yet the air of  frolic and of superabundance of wing-power is more marked with her  than with any other of our birds. Her feeding and twig-gathering seem  like asides in a life of endless play. Several times both in spring  and fall I have seen swifts gather in immense numbers toward  nightfall, to take refuge in large unused chimney-stacks. On such  occasions they seem to be coming together for some aerial festival or  grand celebration; and, as if bent upon a final effort to work off a  part of their superabundant wing-power before settling down for the  night, they circle and circle high above the chimney-top, a great  cloud of them, drifting this way and that, all in high spirits and  chippering as they fly. Their numbers constantly increase as other  members of the clan come dashing in from all points of the compass.  Swifts seem to materialize out of empty air on all sides of the  chippering, whirling ring, as an hour or more this assembling of the  clan and this flight festival go on.

If you'd been here early--or even on time--we might at least have  gotten some of the information together.\"    Lucilla laid the stack of material on his desk. \"I haven't had time to  flag the pages yet,\" she said, \"but they're listed on the library  request on top. We did nineteen ads for KK last year and three of  premium offers. I stopped by Sales on my way in--Susie's digging out  figures for you now.\"    \"Hm-m-m,\" said G.G. \"Well. So that's where you've been. You could at  least have let me know.\" There was grudging approval beneath his  gruffness. \"Say, how'd you know I needed this today, anyhow?\"    \"Didn't,\" said Lucilla, putting her purse away and whisking the cover off  her typewriter. \"Happenstance, that's all.\" (Just happened to go down to  the library ... for no reason at all ... withholding something ... get out  of the way....) The telephone's demand for attention overrode her  thoughts. She reached for it almost gratefully. \"Mr. Hoskins' office,\" she  said. \"Yes. Yes, he knows about the ten o'clock meeting this morning.  Thanks for calling, anyway.\" She hung up and glanced at G.G., but he was  so immersed in one of the magazines that the ringing telephone hadn't even  disturbed him. Ringing? The last thing she did before she left the office  each night was set the lever in the instrument's base to \"off,\" so that  the bell would not disturb G.G. if he worked late. So far today, nobody  had set it back to \"on.\"           *       *       *       *       *    \"It's getting worse,\" she said miserably to the pale blue ceiling.  \"The phone didn't ring this morning--it couldn't have--but I answered  it.\" Dr. Andrews said nothing at all. She let her eyes flicker  sidewise, but he was outside her range of vision. \"I don't LIKE  having you sit where I can't see you,\" she said crossly. \"Freud may  have thought it was a good idea, but I think it's a lousy one.\" She  clenched her hands and stared at nothing. The silence stretched  thinner and thinner, like a balloon blown big, until the temptation to  rupture it was too great to resist. \"I didn't see the truck this  morning. Nor hear it. There was no reason at all for me to slow down  and pull over.\"    \"You might be dead if you hadn't. Would you like that better?\"    The matter-of-fact question was like a hand laid across Lucilla's  mouth. \"I don't want to be dead,\" she admitted finally. \"Neither do I  want to go on like this, hearing words that aren't spoken and bells  that don't ring. When it gets to the point that I pick up a phone just  because somebody's thinking....\" She stopped abruptly.    \"I didn't quite catch the end of that sentence,\" Dr. Andrews said.    \"I didn't quite finish it. I can't.\"    \"Can't? Or won't? Don't hold anything back, Lucilla. You were saying  that you picked up the phone just because somebody was thinking....\"  He paused expectantly. Lucilla reread the ornate letters on the framed  diploma on the wall, looked critically at the picture of Mrs.  Andrews--whom she'd met--and her impish daughter--whom she  hadn't--counted the number of pleats in the billowing drapes, ran a  tentative finger over the face of her wristwatch, straightened a fold  of her skirt ... and could stand the silence no longer.    \"All right,\" she said wearily. \"The girl at Karry Karton thought about  talking to me, and I heard my phone ring, even though the bell was  disconnected. G.G. thought about needing backup material for the  conference and I went to the library. The truck driver thought about  warning people and I got out of his way. So I can read people's  minds--some people's minds, some of the time, anyway ... only there's  no such thing as telepathy. And if I'm not telepathic, then....\" She  caught herself in the brink of time and bit back the final word,  fighting for self-control.    \"Then what?\" The peremptory question toppled Lucilla's defenses.    \"I'm crazy,\" she said. Speaking the word released all the others  dammed up behind it. \"Ever since I can remember, things like this have  happened--all at once, in the middle of doing something or saying  something, I'd find myself thinking about what somebody else was doing  or saying. Not thinking--knowing. I'd be playing hide-and-seek, and I  could see the places where the other kids were hiding just as plainly  as I could see my own surroundings. Or I'd be worrying over the  answers to an exam question, and I'd know what somebody in the back of  the room had decided to write down, or what the teacher was expecting  us to write. Not always--but it happened often enough so that it  bothered me, just the way it does now when I answer a question before  it's been asked, or know what the driver ahead of me is going to do a  split second before he does it, or win a bridge game because I can see  everybody else's hand through his own eyes, almost.\"    \"Has it always ... bothered you, Lucilla?\"    \"No-o-o-o.\" She drew the word out, considering, trying to think when  it was that she hadn't felt uneasy about the unexpected moments of  perceptiveness. When she was very little, perhaps. She thought of the  tiny, laughing girl in the faded snaps of the old album--and suddenly,  inexplicably, she was that self, moving through remembered rooms,  pausing to collect a word from a boyish father, a thought from a  pretty young mother. Reluctantly, she closed her eyes against that  distant time. \"Way back,\" she said, \"when I didn't know any better, I  just took it for granted that sometimes people talked to each other  and that sometimes they passed thoughts along without putting them  into words. I was about six, I guess, when I found out it wasn't so.\"  She slipped into her six-year-old self as easily as she had donned the  younger Lucilla. This time she wasn't in a house, but high on a  hillside, walking on springy pine needles instead of prosaic carpet.    \"Talk,\" Dr. Andrews reminded her, his voice so soft that it could  almost have come from inside her own mind.    \"We were picnicking,\" she said. \"A whole lot of us. Somehow, I  wandered away from the others....\" One minute the hill was bright  with sun, and the next it was deep in shadows and the wind that had  been merely cool was downright cold. She shivered and glanced around  expecting her mother to be somewhere near, holding out a sweater or  jacket. There was no one at all in sight. Even then, she never thought  of being frightened. She turned to retrace her steps. There was a big  tree that looked familiar, and a funny rock behind it, half buried in  the hillside. She was trudging toward it, humming under her breath,  when the worry thoughts began to reach her. (... only a little creek  so I don't think she could have fallen in ... not really any bears  around here ... but she never gets hurt ... creek ... bear ... twisted  ankle ... dark ... cold....) She had veered from her course and  started in the direction of the first thought, but now they were  coming from all sides and she had no idea at all which way to go. She  ran wildly then, first one way, then the other, sobbing and calling.    [Illustration]    \"Lucilla!\" The voice sliced into the night, and the dark mountainside  and the frightened child were gone. She shuddered a little,  reminiscently, and put her hand over her eyes.    \"Somebody found me, of course. And then Mother was holding me and  crying and I was crying, too, and telling her how all the different  thought at once frightened me and mixed me up. She ... she scolded me  for ... for telling fibs ... and said that nobody except crazy people  thought they could read each other's minds.\"    \"I see,\" said Dr. Andrews, \"So you tried not to, of course. And  anytime you did it again, or thought you did, you blamed it on  coincidence. Or luck.\"    \"And had that nightmare again.\"    \"Yes, that, too. Tell me about it.\"    \"I already have. Over and over.\"    \"Tell me again, then.\"    \"I feel like a fool, repeating myself,\" she complained. Dr. Andrew's  made no comment. \"Oh, all right. It always starts with me walking down  a crowded street, surrounded by honking cars and yelling newsboys and  talking people. The noise bothers me and I'm tempted to cover my ears  to shut it out, but I try to ignore it, instead, and walk faster and  faster. Bit by bit, the buildings I pass are smaller, the people  fewer, the noise less. All at once, I discover there's nothing around  at all but a spreading carpet of gray-green moss, years deep, and a  silence that feels as old as time itself. There's nothing to frighten  me, but I am frightened ... and lonesome, not so much for people, but  for a sound ... any sound. I turn to run back toward town, but there's  nothing behind me now but the same gray moss and gray sky and dead  silence.\"           *       *       *       *       *    By the time she reached the last word, her throat had tightened until  speaking was difficult. She reached out blindly for something to cling  to. Her groping hand met Dr. Andrews' and his warm fingers closed  reassuringly around hers. Gradually the panic drained away, but she  could think of nothing to say at all, although she longed to have the  silence broken. As if he sensed her longing, Dr. Andrews said, \"You  started having the dream more often just after you told Paul you  wouldn't marry him, is that right?\"    \"No. It was the other way around. I hadn't had it for months, not  since I fell in love with him, then he got assigned to that \"Which  Tomorrow?\" show and he started calling me \"Lucky,\" the way everybody  does, and the dream came back....\" She stopped short, and turned on  the couch to stare at the psychiatrist with startled eyes. \"But that  can't be how it was,\" she said. \"The lonesomeness must have started  after I decided not to marry him, not before.\"    \"I wonder why the dream stopped when you fell in love with him.\"    \"That's easy,\" Lucilla said promptly, grasping at the chance to evade  her own more"]]]
