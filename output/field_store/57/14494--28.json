[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/31987"],[0,"Territory in Bird Life (#2)"],[1,"means that it is especially constructed so as to mislead us  when we attempt to describe the working of minds that differ in a great  degree from the human.\"    The use of the word \"territory\" in connection with the sexual life of  birds is open to the danger which we are here asked to guard against,  and I propose, therefore, before attempting to establish the theory on  general grounds, to give some explanation of what the word is intended  to represent and some account of the exact position that representation  is supposed to occupy in the drama of bird life.    The word is capable of much expansion. There cannot be territories  without boundaries of some description; there cannot well be boundaries  without disputes arising as to those boundaries; nor, one would  imagine, can there be disputes without consciousness as a factor  entering into the situation; and so on, until by a simple mental  process we conceive of a state in bird life analogous to that which we  know to be customary amongst ourselves. Now, although the term \"breeding  territory,\" when applied to the sexual life of birds, is not altogether  a happy one, it is difficult to know how otherwise to give expression to  the facts observed. Let it then be clearly understood that the  expression \"securing a territory\" is used to denote a process, or rather  part of a process, which, in order to insure success to the individual  in the attainment of reproduction, has been gradually evolved to meet  the exigencies of diverse circumstances. Regarded thus, we avoid the  risk of conceiving of the act of securing a territory as a detached  event in the life of a bird, and avoid, I hope, the risk of a conception  based upon the meaning of the word when used to describe human as  opposed to animal procedure.    Success in the attainment of reproduction is rightly considered to be  the goal towards which many processes in nature are tending. But what is  meant by success? Is it determined by the actual discharge of the sexual  function? So many and so wonderful are the contrivances which have  slowly been evolved to insure this discharge, that it is scarcely  surprising to find attention focused upon this one aspect of the  problem. Yet a moment's reflection will show that so limited a  definition of the term \"success\" can only be held to apply to certain  forms of life; for where the young have to be cared for, fostered, and  protected from molestation for periods of varying lengths, the actual  discharge of the sexual function marks but one stage in a process which  can only succeed if all the contributory factors adequately meet the  essential conditions of the continuance of the species.    Securing a territory is then part of a process which has for its goal  the successful rearing of offspring. In this process the functioning of  the primary impulse, the acquirement of a place suitable for breeding  purposes, the advent of a female, the discharge of the sexual function,  the construction of the nest, and the rearing of offspring follow one  another in orderly sequence. But since we know so little of the organic  changes which determine sexual behaviour, and have no means of  ascertaining the nature of the impulse which is first aroused, we can  only deal with the situation from the point at which the internal  organic changes reflect themselves in the behaviour to a degree which is  visible to an external observer. That point is reached when large  numbers of species, forsaking the normal routine of existence to which  they have been accustomed for some months, suddenly adopt a radical  change in their mode of behaviour. How is this change made known to us?  By vast numbers of individuals hurrying from one part of the globe to  another, from one country to another, and even from mid-ocean to the  coasts; by detachments travelling from one district to another; by  isolated individuals deserting this place for that; by all those  movements, in fact, which the term migration, widely applied, is held to  denote. Now the impulse which prompts these travelling hosts must be  similar in kind whether the journey be long or short; and it were  better, one would think, to regard such movements as a whole than to  fix the attention on some one particular journey which fills us with  amazement on account of the magnitude of the distance traversed or the  nature of the difficulties overcome. For, after all, what does each  individual seek? There may be some immature birds which, though they  have not reached the necessary stage of development, happen to fall in  with others in whom the impulse is strong and are led by them--they know  not where. But the majority seek neither continent nor country, neither  district nor locality is their aim, but a place wherein the rearing of  offspring can be safely accomplished; and the search for this place is  the earliest visible manifestation in many species of the reawakening of  the sexual instinct.    The movements of each individual are then directed towards a similar  goal, namely, the occupation of a definite station; and this involves  for many species a distinct change in the routine of behaviour to which  previously they had been accustomed. Observe, for example, one of the  numerous flocks of Finches that roam about the fields throughout the  winter. Though it may be composed of large numbers of individuals of  different kinds, yet the various units form an amicable society actuated  by one motive--the procuring of food. And since it is to the advantage  of all that the individual should be subordinated to the welfare of the  community as a whole there is no dissension, apart from an occasional  quarrel here and there.    In response, however, to some internal organic change, which occurs  early in the season, individuality emerges as a factor in the developing  situation, and one by one the males betake themselves to secluded  positions, where each one, occupying a limited area, isolates itself  from companions. Thereafter we no longer find that certain fields are  tenanted by flocks of greater or less dimensions, while acres of land  are uninhabited, but we observe that the hedgerows and thickets are  divided up into so many territories, each one of which contains its  owner. This procedure, with of course varying detail, is typical of that  of many species that breed in Western Europe. And since such a radical  departure from the normal routine of behaviour could scarcely appear  generation after generation in so many widely divergent forms, and still  be so uniform in occurrence each returning season, if it were not  founded upon some congenital basis, it is probable that the journey,  whether it be the extensive one of the Warbler or the short one of the  Reed-Bunting, is undertaken in response to some inherited disposition,  and probable also that the disposition bears some relation to the few  acres in which the bird ultimately finds a resting place. Whilst for the  purpose of the theory I shall give expression to this behaviour in terms  of that theory, and speak of it as a disposition to secure a territory,  using the word disposition, which has been rendered current in recent  discussion, for that part of the inherited nature which has been  organised to subserve a specific biological purpose--strict compliance  with the rules of psychological analysis requires a simpler definition;  let us therefore say \"disposition to remain in a particular place in a  particular environment.\"    But even granting that this disposition forms part of the hereditary  equipment of the bird, how is the process of reproduction furthered? The  mere fact of remaining in or about a particular spot cannot render the  attainment of reproduction any less arduous, and may indeed add to the  difficulties, for any number of individuals might congregate together  and mutually affect one another's interests. A second disposition comes,  however, into functional activity at much the same stage of sexual  development, and manifests itself in the male's intolerance of other  individuals. And the two combined open up an avenue through which the  individual can approach the goal of reproduction. In terms of the theory  I shall refer to this second disposition as the one which is concerned  with the defence of the territory.    Broadly speaking, these two dispositions may be regarded as the basis  upon which the breeding territory is founded. Yet inasmuch as the  survival value of the dispositions themselves must have depended upon  the success of the process as a whole, it is manifest that peculiar  significance must not be attached to just the area occupied, which  happens to be so susceptible of observation; other contributory factors  must also receive attention, for the process is but an order of  relationships in which the various units have each had their share in  determining the nature and course of subsequent process, so that, as Dr  Stout says, when they were modified, it was modified.    Now the male inherits a disposition which leads it to remain in a  restricted area, but the disposition cannot determine the extent of that  area. How then are the boundaries fixed? That they are sometimes adhered  to with remarkable precision, that they can only be encroached upon at  the risk of a conflict--all of this can be observed with little  difficulty. But if we regard them as so many lines definitely delimiting  an area of which the bird is cognisant, we place the whole behaviour on  a different level of mental development, and incidentally alter the  complexion of the whole process. It would be a mistake, I think, to do  this. Though conscious intention as a factor may enter the situation,  there is no necessity for it to do so; there is no necessity, that is to  say, for the bird to form a mental image of the area to be occupied and  shape its course accordingly. The same result can be obtained without  our having recourse to"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/31993"],[0,"'Round the yule-log: Christmas in Norway (#2)"],[1,".    \"In the olden days there lived in Kvam a hunter whose name was Peter  Gynt, and who was always roaming about in the mountains after bears and  elks, for in those days there were more forests on the mountains than  there are now, and consequently plenty of wild beasts.    \"One day, shortly before Christmas, Peter set out on an expedition. He  had heard of a farm on Doorefell which was invaded by such a number of  trolls every Christmas Eve that the people on the farm had to move out,  and get shelter at some of their neighbours'. He was anxious to go  there, for he had a great fancy to come across the trolls, and see if he  could not overcome them. He dressed himself in some old ragged clothes,  and took a tame white bear which he had with him, as well as an awl,  some pitch and twine. When he came to the farm he went in and asked for  lodgings.    [Illustration: Picture of Peter Gynt and his tame white bear]    \"'God help us!' said the farmer; 'we can't give you any lodgings. We  have to clear out of the house ourselves soon and look for lodgings, for  every Christmas Eve we have the trolls here.'    \"But Peter thought he should be able to clear the trolls out,--he had  done such a thing before; and then he got leave to stay, and a pig's  skin into the bargain. The bear lay down behind the fireplace, and  Peter took out his awl and pitch and twine, and began making a big, big  shoe, which it took the whole pig's skin to make. He put a strong rope  in for lacings, that he might pull the shoe tightly together, and,  finally, he armed himself with a couple of handspikes.    \"Shortly he heard the trolls coming. They had a fiddler with them, and  some began dancing, while others fell to eating the Christmas fare on  the table,--some fried bacon, and some fried frogs and toads, and other  nasty things which they had brought with them. During this some of the  trolls found the shoe Peter had made. They thought it must belong to a  very big foot. They all wanted to try it on at once, so they put a foot  each into it; but Peter made haste and tightened the rope, took one of  the handspikes and fastened the rope around it, and got them at last  securely tied up in the shoe.    \"Just then the bear put his nose out from behind the fireplace, where he  was lying, and smelt they were frying something.    \"'Will you have a sausage, pussy?' said one of the trolls, and threw a  hot frog right into the bear's jaws.    \"'Scratch them, pussy!' said Peter.    \"The bear got so angry that he rushed at the trolls and scratched them  all over, while Peter took the other handspike and hammered away at them  as if he wanted to beat their brains out. The trolls had to clear out at  last, but Peter stayed and enjoyed himself with all the Christmas fare  the whole week. After that the trolls were not heard of there for many  years.    \"Some years afterwards, about Christmas time, Peter was out in the  forest cutting wood for the holidays, when a troll came up to him and  shouted,--    [Illustration: Picture of a troll shouting at Peter Gynt]    \"'Have you got that big pussy of yours, yet?'    \"'Oh, yes! she is at home behind the fireplace,' said he; 'and she has  got seven kittens, all bigger and larger than herself.'    \"'We'll never come to you any more, then,' said the troll, and they  never did.\"    The children were all delighted with this story.    \"Tell us another, dear Lieutenant,\" they all shouted in chorus.    \"No, no, children! you bother the Lieutenant too much,\" said Miss  Cicely. \"Aunt Mette will tell you a story now.\"    \"Yes, do, auntie, do!\" was the general cry.    \"I don't know exactly what I shall tell you,\" said Aunt Mette, \"but  since we have commenced telling about the brownies, I think I will tell  you something about them, too. You remember, of course, old Kari  Gausdal, who came here and baked bread, and who always had so many tales  to tell you.\"    \"Oh, yes, yes!\" shouted the children.    \"Well, old Kari told me that she was in service at the orphan asylum  some years ago, and at that time it was still more dreary and lonely in  that part of the town than it is now. That asylum is a dark and dismal  place, I can tell you. Well, when Kari came there she was cook, and a  very smart and clever girl she was. She had, one day, to get up very  early in the morning to brew, when the other servants said to her,--    \"'You had better mind you don't get up too early, and you mustn't put  any fire under the copper before two o'clock.'    \"'Why?' she asked.    \"'Don't you know there is a brownie here? And you ought to know that  those people don't like to be disturbed so early,' they said; 'and  before two o'clock you mustn't light the fire by any means.'    \"'Is that all?' said Kari. She was anything but chicken-hearted. 'I have  nothing to do with that brownie of yours, but if he comes in my way,  why, by my faith, I will send him head over heels through the door.'    \"The others warned her, but she did not care a bit, and next morning,  just as the clock struck one, she got up and lighted the fire under the  copper in the brewhouse; but the fire went out in a moment. Somebody  appeared to be throwing the logs about on the hearth, but she could not  see who it was. She gathered the logs together, one at a time, but it  was of no use, and the chimney would not draw, either. She got tired of  this at last, took a burning log and ran around the room with it,  swinging it high and low while she shouted, 'Be gone, be gone whence you  came! If you think you can frighten me you are mistaken.' 'Curse you!'  somebody hissed in one of the darkest corners. 'I have had seven souls  in this house; I thought I should have got eight in all!' 'But from that  time nobody saw or heard the brownie in the asylum,' said Kari Gausdal.\"    [Illustration: Picture of Kari swinging the burning log]    \"I am getting so frightened!\" said one of the children. \"No, you must  tell us some more stories, Lieutenant; I never feel afraid when you tell  us anything, because you tell us such jolly tales.\" Another proposed  that I should tell them about the brownie who danced the Halling dance  with the lassie. That was a tale I didn't care much about, as there was  some singing in it. But they would on no account let me off, and I was  going to clear my throat and prepare my exceedingly inharmonious voice  to sing the Halling dance, which belongs to the story, when the pretty  niece, whom I have already referred to, entered the room, to the great  joy of the children and to my rescue.    \"Well, my dear children, I will tell you the story, if you can get  cousin Lizzie to sing the Halling for you,\" said I, as she sat down,  \"and then you'll dance to it yourselves, won't you?\"    Cousin Lizzie was besieged by the children, and had to promise to do the  singing, so I commenced my story.    \"There was, once upon a time,--I almost think it was in Hallingdal,--a  lassie who was sent up into the hay-loft with the cream porridge for the  brownie,--I cannot recollect if it was on a Thursday or on a Christmas  Eve, but I think it was a Christmas Eve. Well, she thought it was a  great pity to give the brownie such a dainty dish, so she ate the  porridge herself, and the melted butter in the bargain, and went up into  the hay-loft with the plain oatmeal porridge and sour milk, in a pig's  trough instead. 'There, that's good enough for you, Master Brownie,' she  said. But no sooner had she spoken the words than the brownie stood  right before her, seized her round the waist, and danced about with her,  which he kept up till she lay gasping for breath, and when the people  came up into the hay-loft in the morning, she was more dead than alive.  But as long as they danced, the brownie sang,\" (and here Cousin Lizzie  undertook his part, and sang to the tune of the Halling)--    [Illustration: Picture of the girl lying in the hay-loft]        \"And you have eaten the porridge for the brownie,      And you shall dance with the little brownie!        \"And have you eaten the porridge for the brownie?      Then you shall dance with the little brownie!\"    I assisted in keeping time by stamping on the floor with my feet, while  the children romped about the room in uproarious joy.    \"I think you are turning the house upside down, children!\" said old  Mother Skau; \"if you'll be quiet, I'll give you a story.\"    The children were soon quiet, and Mother Skau commenced as follows:    [Illustration: Picture of a Brownie hurling dishes on the floor]    \"You hear a great deal about brownies and fairies and such like beings,  but I don't believe there is much in it. I have neither seen one nor the  other. Of course I have not been so very much about in my lifetime, but  I believe it is all nonsense. But old Stine out in the kitchen there,  she says she has seen the brownie. About the time when I was confirmed  she was in service with my parents. She came to us from a captain's, who  had given up the sea. It was a very quiet place. The captain only took a  walk as far as the quay every day. They always went to bed early. People  said there was a brownie in the house. Well, it so happened that Stine  and the cook were sitting in their room one evening, mending and darning  their things; it was near bedtime, for the watchman had already sung out  'Ten o'clock!' but somehow the darning and the sewing went on very  slowly indeed; every moment 'Jack Nap' came and played his tricks upon  them. At one moment Stine was nodding and nodding, and then came the  cook's turn,--they could not keep their eyes open; they had been up  early that morning to wash clothes. But just as they were sitting thus,  they heard a terrible crash down stairs in the kitchen, and Stine  shouted, 'Lor' bless and preserve us! it must be the brownie.' She was  so frightened she dared scarcely move a foot, but at last the cook  plucked up courage and went down into the kitchen, closely followed by  Stine. When they"]]]
