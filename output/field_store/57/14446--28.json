There was little loss of life, and the destruction of property  lay largely in the loss of stock, and washing away of the soil,  vegetation, and the means of reproduction.    A remarkable provision for this latter loss was made by the gift of Mr.  Hiram Sibley, the noted seed dealer of Rochester--who had become  associated with the Red Cross, being an old-time friend of the family of  its president--of ten thousand dollars' worth of seed, to replant the  washed-out lands adown the Mississippi. As the waters ran off the mud  immediately baked in the sunshine, making planting impossible after a  few days. Accordingly, Mr. Sibley's gift was sent with all haste to our  agent at Memphis, and in forty-eight hours, by train and boat, it was  distributed in the four States--Tennessee, Arkansas, Louisiana, and  Mississippi--and planted for the crops of the coming season.    Besides this generous gift of material, a little money had been raised  and sent by the three societies of the Red Cross which had been formed,  viz.: Dansville and Syracuse, a few hundreds--something more from the  Red Cross at Rochester--always thoughtful and generous, which served to  help in the distribution of clothing and supplies promiscuously sent.  And at the finish of the work, when every donation had been carefully  acknowledged, one thousand dollars and some cents were left in the  treasury unexpended.    A cyclone occurring within a few months in Louisiana and southern  Alabama, cutting a swath from New Orleans to Mobile, decided us to send  eight hundred dollars of this reserve to the secretary of the Red Cross  Society of New Orleans, which sum was forwarded by our vice-president,  Mr. A. S. Solomons. This left a sum of two hundred dollars and some  cents in the treasury with which to commence another field.    This was the commencement of 1883. In May, at the solicitation of  General Butler, then Governor of Massachusetts, I took the  superintendence of the Massachusetts Woman's State Prison at Sherborn,  at the customary salary of fifteen hundred dollars a year. To this duty  the Legislature added, after my arrival, those of secretary and  treasurer, without increase of salary, discharging the former incumbent,  a man, at three thousand dollars a year. I accepted the new duties,  became my own bondsman for ten thousand dollars, by transfer of that  amount of bonds from my bankers, Brown Brothers, New York, to the  Massachusetts State Treasury at Boston--remaining in charge of the  prison until the close of the year, and the retirement of General Butler  as Governor.    In the short and interrupted existence of our association--scarce two  years--our few official advisers had formed some general regulations,  relating to our course of procedure. Realizing that to be of any real  service as a body of relief for sudden disasters, we must not only be  independent of the slow, ordinary methods of soliciting relief, but in  its means of application as well, it was decided:    _First._ To never solicit relief or ask for contributions.    _Second._ Not to pay salaries to officers--paying out money only to  those whom we must employ for manual labor--and as our officers served  without compensation they should not be taxed for dues.    _Third._ To keep ourselves always in possession of a stated sum of money  to commence a field of disaster--this sum to be independent even of the  closed doors of a bank which might prevent leaving for a field on a  Sunday or holiday.    _Fourth._ To take this sum of our own, going directly to a field with  such help as needed, giving no notice until there, overlooking the  field, and learning the extent of the trouble and conditions of the  people, making immediate and reliable report to the country through the  Associated Press, some of whose officers were our own Red Cross officers  as well. These reports would be truthful, unexaggerated, and  non-sensational statements that could be relied upon.    _Fifth._ That if, under these conditions, the people chose to make use  of us as distributers of the relief which they desired to contribute to  the sufferers, we would do our best to serve them while at the  field--make report directly to each and all contributors, so far as in  our power, and proceed to carry out any directions and apply the relief  at hand, in the wisest manner possible, among a dazed and afflicted  community.    To inaugurate this method, I, as president, placed a sum of three  thousand dollars, free of bank or interest, upon momentary call, at the  service of the association. On more than one occasion it has been taken  on Sunday, when every bank in the country was closed and charitable  bodies were at their prayers. Even the relief of Johnstown was thus  commenced. This provision has never for a day been broken. It is as good  at this moment as it was in 1883, and from the same source. It may not  have been a \"business-like\" method nor one to be approved by stated  boards of directors nor squared by bank regulations. But the foes we had  to meet were not thus regulated, and had to be met as they came; and so  they always must be if any good is to be accomplished.    Until the Government and society can control the elements, and regulate  a spring freshet, a whirlwind or a cyclone, they will find that red  tape is not strong enough to hold their ravages in check.    It was well that these regulations had been formulated and their  provisions acted upon, as the state of our treasury and the conditions  immediately following will show.    I returned to Washington upon my retirement from the superintendence of  the State Prison at Sherborn, accompanied by Dr. Hubbell, who, having  completed his university course, had come to the Red Cross for permanent  service. Before we had even time to unpack our trunks, the news of the  fearful rise of the Ohio River, of 1884, began to shock the country with  its loss of life and property.    I had never been present at a disaster in civil life. It had never  occurred to me that they recurred so frequently. But if by virtue of my  office as president I was liable to be called every year to preside over  and provide for them, it was essential that I learn my duties  experimentally. I accordingly joined Dr. Hubbell, who had been appointed  general field agent, and proceeded to Pittsburg, the headwaters of the  rise.    Telegraphing from there to our agents of the Associated Press, we  proceeded to Cincinnati, to find the city afloat. Its inhabitants were  being fed from boats, through the second-story windows. These conditions  were telegraphed. Supplies commenced to flow in, not only from our own  societies but from the people of the country. Warehouses were filled, in  spite of all we dispensed--but there were four hundred miles of this  distress--even to Cairo, where the Ohio, sometimes thirty miles in  width, discharged its swollen waters into the Mississippi.    Recognizing this condition lower down the river as the greater need, we  transferred our supplies and distribution to Evansville, Ind. Scarcely  had we reached there when a cyclone struck the river below, and  traveling up its entire length, leveled every standing object upon its  banks, swept the houses along like cockle-shells, uprooted the greatest  trees and whirled them down its mighty current--catching here and there  its human victims, or leaving them with life only, houseless, homeless,  wringing their hands on a frozen, fireless shore--with every coal-pit  filled with water, and death from freezing more imminent than from  hunger.    There were four hundred miles more of this, and no way of reaching them  by land. With all our tons of clothing, these people and their homeless  little children were freezing. There was but one way--the Government  boats had come with rations of food--we too must take to the water.    At eight o'clock in the morning I chartered my first boat, with captain  and crew, at sixty dollars per day, to be at once laden to the water's  edge with coal--our own supplies to be stored on the upper deck--and at  four o'clock in the afternoon, as the murky sun was hiding its clouded  face, the bell of the \"John V. Troop,\" in charge of her owner, announced  the departure of the first Red Cross relief-boat ever seen on American  waters.    I found myself that night with a stanch crew of thirty men and a skilled  captain, and a boat under my command. I had never until then held such a  command. We wove the river diagonally from side to side--from village to  village--where the homeless, shivering people were gathered--called for  the most responsible person--a clergyman if one could be found, threw  off boxes of clothing, and hove off coal for a two weeks' supply, and  steamed away to the opposite side, leaving only gratitude, wonder at who  we were, where we came from, and what that strange flag meant? We  improved every opportunity to replenish our supply of coal, and reached  Cairo in five days.    Waiting only to reload, we returned up the river, resupplied the revived  villages of people, too grateful for words, reaching Evansville at the  end of three weeks, where more supplies than we had taken awaited us.  St. Louis and Chicago had caught the fever of relief, had arranged  societies, and had asked permission to join our aid. Up to this time the  Mississippi had given no indication of trouble, but now its great June  rise commenced.    The Government boats, by another appropriation, were sent to the  Mississippi, and we prepared to supplement them. Discharging our Ohio  River boat we went to St. Louis by rail and chartered the \"Mattie Bell.\"  The Red Cross Societies of St. Louis and Chicago, under their respective  presidents and officers in charge of them and their funds, joined us,  and together we prepared to feed and rescue the perishing stock--as"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/30240"],[0,"The Big Trip Up Yonder (#2)"],[1,"the sound of music  from the living room and there were murmurs and the scraping of  chair-legs on the floor. \"Thus ends,\" said the television announcer,  \"the 29,121st chapter in the life of your neighbors and mine, the  McGarveys.\" Footsteps were coming down the hall. There was a knock on  the bathroom door.    \"Just a sec,\" Lou cheerily called out. Desperately, he shook the big  bottle, trying to speed up the flow. His palms slipped on the wet glass,  and the heavy bottle smashed on the tile floor.    The door was pushed open, and Gramps, dumbfounded, stared at the  incriminating mess.    Lou felt a hideous prickling sensation on his scalp and the back of his  neck. He grinned engagingly through his nausea and, for want of anything  remotely resembling a thought, waited for Gramps to speak.    \"Well, boy,\" said Gramps at last, \"looks like you've got a little  tidying up to do.\"    And that was all he said. He turned around, elbowed his way through the  crowd and locked himself in his bedroom.    The Fords contemplated Lou in incredulous silence a moment longer, and  then hurried back to the living room, as though some of his horrible  guilt would taint them, too, if they looked too long. Morty stayed  behind long enough to give Lou a quizzical, annoyed glance. Then he also  went into the living room, leaving only Emerald standing in the doorway.    Tears streamed over her cheeks. \"Oh, you poor lamb--_please_ don't look  so awful! It was my fault. I put you up to this with my nagging about  Gramps.\"    \"No,\" said Lou, finding his voice, \"really you didn't. Honest, Em, I was  just--\"    \"You don't have to explain anything to me, hon. I'm on your side, no  matter what.\" She kissed him on one cheek and whispered in his ear, \"It  wouldn't have been murder, hon. It wouldn't have killed him. It wasn't  such a terrible thing to do. It just would have fixed him up so he'd be  able to go any time God decided He wanted him.\"    \"What's going to happen next, Em?\" said Lou hollowly. \"What's he going  to do?\"           *       *       *       *       *    Lou and Emerald stayed fearfully awake almost all night, waiting to see  what Gramps was going to do. But not a sound came from the sacred  bedroom. Two hours before dawn, they finally dropped off to sleep.    At six o'clock, they arose again, for it was time for their generation  to eat breakfast in the kitchenette. No one spoke to them. They had  twenty minutes in which to eat, but their reflexes were so dulled by the  bad night that they had hardly swallowed two mouthfuls of egg-type  processed seaweed before it was time to surrender their places to their  son's generation.    Then, as was the custom for whoever had been most recently disinherited,  they began preparing Gramps' breakfast, which would presently be served  to him in bed, on a tray. They tried to be cheerful about it. The  toughest part of the job was having to handle the honest-to-God eggs and  bacon and oleomargarine, on which Gramps spent so much of the income  from his fortune.    \"Well,\" said Emerald, \"I'm not going to get all panicky until I'm sure  there's something to be panicky about.\"    \"Maybe he doesn't know what it was I busted,\" Lou said hopefully.    \"Probably thinks it was your watch crystal,\" offered Eddie, their son,  who was toying apathetically with his buckwheat-type processed sawdust  cakes.    \"Don't get sarcastic with your father,\" said Em, \"and don't talk with  your mouth full, either.\"    \"I'd like to see anybody take a mouthful of this stuff and _not_ say  something,\" complained Eddie, who was 73. He glanced at the clock. \"It's  time to take Gramps his breakfast, you know.\"    \"Yeah, it is, isn't it?\" said Lou weakly. He shrugged. \"Let's have the  tray, Em.\"    \"We'll both go.\"    Walking slowly, smiling bravely, they found a large semi-circle of  long-faced Fords standing around the bedroom door.    Em knocked. \"Gramps,\" she called brightly, \"_break_-fast is _rea_-dy.\"    There was no reply and she knocked again, harder.    The door swung open before her fist. In the middle of the room, the  soft, deep, wide, canopied bed, the symbol of the sweet by-and-by to  every Ford, was empty.    A sense of death, as unfamiliar to the Fords as Zoroastrianism or the  causes of the Sepoy Mutiny, stilled every voice, slowed every heart.  Awed, the heirs began to search gingerly, under the furniture and behind  the drapes, for all that was mortal of Gramps, father of the clan.           *       *       *       *       *    But Gramps had left not his Earthly husk but a note, which Lou finally  found on the dresser, under a paperweight which was a treasured souvenir  from the World's Fair of 2000. Unsteadily, Lou read it aloud:    \"'Somebody who I have sheltered and protected and taught the best I know  how all these years last night turned on me like a mad dog and diluted  my anti-gerasone, or tried to. I am no longer a young man. I can no  longer bear the crushing burden of life as I once could. So, after last  night's bitter experience, I say good-by. The cares of this world will  soon drop away like a cloak of thorns and I shall know peace. By the  time you find this, I will be gone.'\"    \"Gosh,\" said Willy brokenly, \"he didn't even get to see how the  5000-mile Speedway Race was going to come out.\"    \"Or the Solar Series,\" Eddie said, with large mournful eyes.    \"Or whether Mrs. McGarvey got her eyesight back,\" added Morty.    \"There's more,\" said Lou, and he began reading aloud again: \"'I, Harold  D. Ford, etc., do hereby make, publish and declare this to be my last  Will and Testament, revoking any and all former wills and codicils by me  at any time heretofore made.'\"    \"No!\" cried Willy. \"Not another one!\"    \"'I do stipulate,'\" read Lou, \"'that all of my property, of whatsoever  kind and nature, not be divided, but do devise and bequeath it to be  held in common by my issue, without regard for generation, equally,  share and share alike.'\"    \"Issue?\" said Emerald.    Lou included the multitude in a sweep of his hand. \"It means we all own  the whole damn shootin' match.\"    Each eye turned instantly to the bed.    \"Share and share alike?\" asked Morty.    \"Actually,\" said Willy, who was the oldest one present, \"it's just like  the old system, where the oldest people head up things with their  headquarters in here and--\"    \"I like _that_!\" exclaimed Em. \"Lou owns as much of it as you do, and I  say it ought to be for the oldest one who's still working. You can  snooze around here all day, waiting for your pension check, while poor  Lou stumbles in here after work, all tuckered out, and--\"    \"How about letting somebody who's never had _any_ privacy get a little  crack at it?\" Eddie demanded hotly. \"Hell, you old people had plenty of  privacy back when you were kids. I was born and raised in the middle of  that goddamn barracks in the hall! How about--\"    \"Yeah?\" challenged Morty. \"Sure, you've all had it pretty tough, and my  heart bleeds for you. But try honeymooning in the hall for a real kick.\"    \"_Silence!_\" shouted Willy imperiously. \"The next person who opens his  mouth spends the next sixth months by the bathroom. Now clear out of my  room. I want to think.\"    A vase shattered against the wall, inches above his head.           *       *       *       *       *    In the next moment, a free-for-all was under way, with each couple  battling to eject every other couple from the room. Fighting coalitions  formed and dissolved with the lightning changes of the tactical  situation. Em and Lou were thrown into the hall, where they organized  others in the same situation, and stormed back into the room.    After two hours of struggle, with nothing like a decision in sight, the  cops broke in, followed by television cameramen from mobile units.    For the next half-hour, patrol wagons and ambulances hauled away Fords,  and then the apartment was still and spacious.    An hour later, films of the last stages of the riot were being televised  to 500,000,000 delighted viewers on the Eastern Seaboard.    In the stillness of the three-room Ford apartment on the 76th floor of  Building 257, the television set had been left on. Once more the air was  filled with the cries and grunts and crashes of the fray, coming  harmlessly now from the loudspeaker.    The battle also appeared on the screen of the television set in the  police station, where the Fords and their captors watched with  professional interest.    Em and Lou, in adjacent four-by-eight cells, were stretched out  peacefully on their cots.    \"Em,\" called Lou through the partition, \"you got a washbasin all your  own, too?\"    \"Sure. Washbasin, bed, light--the works. And we thought _Gramps'_ room  was something. How long has this been going on?\" She held out her hand.  \"For the first time in forty years, hon, I haven't got the shakes--look  at me!\"    \"Cross your fingers,\" said Lou. \"The lawyer's going to try to get us a  year.\"    \"Gee!\" Em said dreamily. \"I wonder what kind of wires you'd have to pull  to get put away in solitary?\"    \"All right, pipe down,\" said the turnkey, \"or I'll toss the whole kit  and caboodle of you right out. And first one who lets on to anybody  outside how good jail is ain't never getting back in!\"    The prisoners instantly fell silent.           *       *       *       *       *    The living room of the apartment darkened for a moment as the riot  scenes faded on the television screen, and then the face of the  announcer appeared, like the Sun coming from behind a cloud. \"And now,  friends,\" he said, \"I have a special message from the makers of  anti-gerasone, a message for all you folks over 150. Are you hampered  socially by wrinkles, by stiffness of joints and discoloration or loss  of hair, all because these things came upon you before anti-gerasone was  developed? Well, if you are, you need no longer suffer, need no longer  feel different and out of things.    \"After years of"]]]
