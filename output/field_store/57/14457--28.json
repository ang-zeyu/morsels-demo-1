The first ambition for one who would  appreciate music should be to cultivate this power of hearing. It is  quite possible to be stone-deaf outwardly and yet hear most beautiful  sounds within the brain. This was approximately the case with  Beethoven after his thirtieth year. On the other hand, many people  have a perfect outward apparatus for hearing but nothing is registered  within.    [Footnote 2: See Chapter II of Gurney's _Power of Sound_, a book  remarkable for its insight.]    [Footnote 3: It is understood that this statement is made in a  subjective rather than a purely physical sense. See the _Century  Dictionary_ under _Sound_.]    [Footnote 4: Il y a donc, dans l'art des sons, quelque chose qui  traverse l'oreille comme un portique, la raison comme un vestibule et  qui va plus loin.    HARMONIE ET MELODIE, CHAPTER II.]    Combarieu, the French aesthetician, defines music as \"the art of  thinking in tones.\"[5] There is food for thought in this statement,  but it seems to leave out one very important factor--namely, the  emotional. Every great musical composition reveals a carefully  planned and perfect balance between the emotional and intellectual  elements. And yet the basic impulse for the creation of music is an  emotional one; and, of all the arts, music makes the most direct  appeal to the emotions and to those shadowy, but real portions of our  being called the imagination and the soul. Emotion is as indispensable  to music as love to religion. Just as there can be no really great art  without passion, so we can not imagine music without all the emotions  of mankind: their loves, joys, sorrows, hatreds, ideals and subtle  fancies. Music, in fact, is a presentation of emotional experience,  fashioned and controlled by an overruling intellectual power.    [Footnote 5: _La musique, ses lois, son evolution_, by Jules  Combarieu.]    We can now foresee, though at first dimly, what is to be our line of  approach to this mystery. One of the peculiar characteristics of music  is that it is both the most natural and least artificial of the arts,  and as well the most complicated and subtle. On the one hand it is the  most natural and direct, because the materials of which it is  constituted--that is, sound and rhythm--make an instinctive appeal to  every normally equipped human being.[6] Every one likes to listen to  beautiful sounds merely for their sensuous effect, just as everyone  likes to look at the blue sky, the green grass and the changing hues  of a sunset; so the rhythm of music, akin to the human heart-beat and  to the ceaseless change and motion, which is the basic fact in all  life, appeals at once to our own physical vitality. This fact may be  observed at a symphony concert where so many people are wagging their  heads, beating time with their hands or even tapping on the floor with  their feet; a habit which shows a rudimentary love of music but which  for obvious reasons is not to be commended. On the other hand, music  is the most complicated of all the arts from the nature of its  constituent parts--intangible, evanescent sounds and rhythms--and from  the subtle grammar and structure by which these factors are used as  means of personal communication. This grammar of music, _i.e._, its  methods of structure and of presentation, has been worked out through  centuries of free experimentation on the part of some of the best  minds in the world, and thus any great musical composition is an  intellectual achievement of high rank. Behind the sensuous factors,  sound and rhythm, lies always the personal message of the composer,  and if we are to grasp this and to make it our own, we must go with  him hand in hand so that the music actually lives again in our minds  and imaginations. The practical inference from this dual nature of the  art we are considering is clear; everyone can derive a large amount of  genuine pleasure and even spiritual exaltation, can feel himself under  the influence of a strong tonic force, merely by putting himself in  contact with music, by opening his ears and drinking in the sounds and  rhythms in their marvellous variety. The all-sufficient reason for the  lack of a complete appreciation of music is that so many people stop  at this point, _i.e._ for them music is a sensuous art and nothing  more. Wagner himself, in fact, is on record in a letter to Liszt as  saying, in regard to the appreciation of his operas: \"I require  nothing from the public but healthy senses and a human heart.\"  Although this may be particularly true of opera, which is a composite  form of art, making so varied an appeal to the participant that  everyone can get something from its picture of life--historical,  legendary, even fictitious--as well as from the actors, the costumes  and the story, the statement is certainly not applicable to what is  called absolute music, where music is disassociated from the guiding  help of words, and expressed by the media of orchestra, string  quartet, pianoforte, and various ensemble groups. For in addition to  its sensuous appeal, music is a language used as a means of personal  expression; sometimes in the nature of an intimate soliloquy, but far  more often as a direct means of communication between the mind and  soul of the composer and of the listener. To say that we understand  the message expressed in this language just because we happen to like  beautiful sounds and stimulating rhythms is surely to be our own  dupes. We might as well say that because we enjoy hearing Italians or  Frenchmen speak their own beautiful languages we are understanding  what they say. The question, therefore, faces us: how shall we learn  this mysterious language so as readily to understand it? And the  answer is equally inevitable: by learning something of the material of  which it is composed, and above all, the fundamental principles of its  structure.    [Footnote 6: Just as some people are color-blind there are those who  are tone-deaf--to whom, that is, music is a disagreeable noise--but  they are so few as to be negligible.]    In attempting to carry out this simple direction, however, we are  confronted by another of the peculiar characteristics of music. Music,  in distinction from the static, concrete and imitative arts, is always  in motion, and to follow it requires an intensity of concentration and  an accuracy of memory which can be acquired, but for which, like most  good things, we have to work. We all know the adage that \"beauty is in  the eye of the beholder\" and that any work of art must be recreated  in the imagination of the participant. The difficulty of this process  of recreation, as applied to music, is that we have, derived from our  ordinary daily experiences, so little to help us. Anyone can begin, at  least, to understand a work of architecture; it must have doors and  windows, and should conform to practical ideas of structure. In like  manner, a painting, either a portrait or a landscape, must show some  correspondence with nature herself, and so we have definite standards  to help our imagination. But music has worked out its own laws which  are those of pure fancy, having little to do with other forms of  thought; and unless we know something of the constructive principles,  instead of recreating the work before us, we are simply lost--\"drowned  in a sea of sound\"--often rudely shaken up by the rhythms, but far  from understanding what the music is really saying. As the well-known  critic, Santayana, wittily says, \"To most people music is a drowsy  revery relieved by nervous thrills.\"    Notwithstanding, however, the peculiar nature of music and the  difficulty of gaining logical impressions as the sounds and rhythms  flood in upon us, there is one simple form of cooperation which solves  most of the difficulties; that is, familiarity. It is the duty of the  composer so to express himself, to make his meaning so clear, that we  can receive it with a minimum of mental friction if we can only get to  know the music. All really good music corresponds to such a standard;  that is, if it is needlessly involved, abstruse, diffuse, or turgid,  it is _in so far_ not music of the highest artistic worth. In this  connection we must always remember that music does not \"stay put,\"  like a picture on the wall. We cannot walk through it, as is the case  with a cathedral; turn back, as in a book; touch it, as with a statue.  It is not the expression of more or less definite ideas, such as we  find in prose and poetry. On the other hand, it rushes upon us with  the impassioned spirit of an eloquent orator, and what we get from it  depends almost entirely upon our own intensity of application and upon  our knowledge of the themes and of the general purpose of the work.  Only with increased familiarity does the architecture stand revealed.  Beethoven, it is said, when once asked the meaning of a sonata of his,  played it over again and replied, \"It means that.\" Music is itself.  The question for every music-lover is: can I equip myself in such a  way as to feel at home in this language, to receive the message as  directly as possible, and finally with perfect ease and satisfaction?  This equipment demands a strong, accurate memory, a keen power of  discrimination and a sympathetic, open mind.    Another paradoxical characteristic of music on which it is interesting  to reflect is this: Music is the oldest as well as the youngest of the  arts, _i.e._, it has always[7] existed generically, and all human  beings born, as they are, with a musical instrument--the voice--are  _ipso facto_ musicians; and yet in boundless scope of possibilities it  is just in its infancy. For who can limit the combinations of sound  and rhythm, or forecast the range of the human imagination? The  creative fancy of the composer is always in advance of contemporary  taste and criticism.

It look like he taken a pleasure in  seein' us eat. At dinner, when the field hands come in, it am the same  way. He was sho' that potlicker was fill as long as the niggers want to  eat.    \"The hands worked from sun to sun. Massa give them li'l crops and let  them work them on Saturday.

Then  massa have two niggers wrestle, and our sports and dances was big sport  for the white folks. They'd sit on the gallery and watch the niggers put  it on brown.    \"Massa didn't like his niggers to marry off the place, but sometimes  they'd do it, and massa tell his neighbor, 'My nigger am comin' to you  place. Make him behave.' All the niggers 'haved then and they wasn't no  Huntsville and gallows and burnin's then.    \"Old massa went to war with his boy, Billie. They's lots of cryin' and  weepin' when they sot us free. Lots of them didn't want to be free,  'cause they knowed nothin' and had nowhere to go.

He has taught       himself to read and to write. His lifelong ambition has been to       become master of the supernatural powers which he believes to       exist. He is now well-known among Southwestern Negroes for his       faith in the occult.      \"Yous want to know and talk about de power de people tells you I has.  Well, sit down here, right there in dat chair, befo' we'uns starts. I  gits some ice water and den we'uns can discuss de subject. I wants to  'splain it clearly, so yous can understand.    \"I's born a slave, 93 years ago, so of course I 'members de war period.  Like all de other slaves I has no chance for edumacation. Three months  am de total time I's spent going to school. I teached myself to read and  write. I's anxious to larn to read so I could study and find out about  many things. Dat, I has done.    \"There am lots of folks, and edumacated ones, too, what says we'uns  believes in superstition. Well, its 'cause dey don't understand. 'Member  de Lawd, in some of His ways, can be mysterious. De Bible says so. There  am some things de Lawd wants all folks to know, some things jus' de  chosen few to know, and some things no one should know. Now, jus' 'cause  yous don't know 'bout some of de Lawd's laws, 'taint superstition if  some other person understands and believes in sich.    \"There is some born to sing, some born to preach, and some born to know  de signs. There is some born under de power of de devil and have de  power to put injury and misery on people, and some born under de power  of de Lawd for to do good and overcome de evil power. Now, dat produces  two forces, like fire and water. De evil forces starts de fire and I has  de water force to put de fire out.    \"How I larnt sich? Well, I's done larn it. It come to me. When de Lawd  gives sich power to a person, it jus' comes to 'em. It am 40 years ago  now when I's fust fully realize' dat I has de power. However, I's allus  int'rested in de workin's of de signs. When I's a little piccaninny, my  mammy and other folks used to talk about de signs. I hears dem talk  about what happens to folks 'cause a spell was put on 'em. De old folks  in dem days knows more about de signs dat de Lawd uses to reveal His  laws den de folks of today. It am also true of de cullud folks in  Africa, dey native land. Some of de folks laughs at their beliefs and  says it am superstition, but it am knowin' how de Lawd reveals His laws.    \"Now, let me tell yous of something I's seen. What am seen, can't be  doubted. It happens when I's a young man and befo' I's realize' dat I's  one dat am chosen for to show de power. A mule had cut his leg so bad  dat him am bleedin' to death and dey couldn't stop it. An old cullud man  live near there dat dey turns to. He comes over and passes his hand over  de cut. Befo' long de bleedin' stop and dat's de power of de Lawd  workin' through dat nigger, dat's all it am.    \"I knows about a woman dat had lost her mind. De doctor say it was  caused from a tumor in de head. Dey took an ex-ray picture, but dere's  no tumor. Dey gives up and says its a peculiar case. Dat woman was took  to one with de power of de good spirit and he say its a peculiar case  for dem dat don't understand. Dis am a case of de evil spell. Two days  after, de woman have her mind back.    \"Dey's lots of dose kind of cases de ord'nary person never hear about.  Yous hear of de case de doctors can't understand, nor will dey 'spond to  treatment. Dat am 'cause of de evil spell dat am on de persons.    \"'Bout special persons bein' chosen for to show de power, read yous  Bible. It says in de book of Mark, third chapter, 'and He ordained  twelve, dat dey should be with Him, dat He might send them forth to  preach and to have de power to heal de sick and to cast out devils.' If  it wasn't no evil in people, why does de Lawd say, 'cast out sich?' And  in de fifth chapter of James, it further say, 'If any am sick, let him  call de elders. Let dem pray over him. De prayers of faith shall save  him.' There 'tis again, Faith, dat am what counts.    \"When I tells dat I seen many persons given up to die, and den a man  with de power comes and saves sich person, den its not for people to say  it am superstition to believe in de power.    \"Don't forgit--de agents of de devil have de power of evil. Dey can put  misery of every kind on people. Dey can make trouble with de work and  with de business, with de fam'ly and with de health. So folks mus' be on  de watch all de time. Folks has business trouble 'cause de evil power  have control of 'em. Dey has de evil power cast out and save de  business. There am a man in Waco dat come to see me 'bout dat. He say to  me everything he try to do in de las' six months turned out wrong. It  starts with him losin' his pocketbook with $50.00 in it. He buys a  carload of hay and it catch fire and he los' all of it. He spends  $200.00 advertisin' de three-day sale and it begin to rain, so he los'  money. It sho' am de evil power.    \"'Well,' he say, 'Dat am de way it go, so I comes to you.'    \"I says to him, 'Its de evil power dat have you control and we'uns shall  cause it to be cast out.' Its done and he has no more trouble.    \"You wants to know if persons with de power for good can be successful  in castin' out devils in all cases? Well, I answers dat, yes and no. Dey  can in every case if de affected person have de faith. If de party not  have enough faith, den it am a failure.    \"Wearin' de coin for protection 'gainst de evil power? Dat am simple.  Lots of folks wears sich and dey uses mixtures dat am sprinkled in de  house, and sich. Dat am a question of faith. If dey has de true faith in  sich, it works.
