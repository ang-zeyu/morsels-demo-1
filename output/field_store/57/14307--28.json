ITS FOUNDATION AND HISTORY TO THE ACCESSION OF DEAN COLET (61-1505).      =Romano-British.=--Tacitus, in his characteristically concise style,  introduces London into authentic history during the apostolic era and  the reign of Nero.[1] Suetonius Paulinus, governor of Britain, came in  hot haste from Mona, suspending the slaughter of the Druid leaders in  this their last fastness, to restore the Roman arms. For Boadicea,  Queen of the Iceni, outraged at the treatment of herself and her two  daughters, had, like a second Deborah, raised a popular uprising  against the foreign invaders. Colchester fallen, the ninth legion  annihilated, nothing remained but to abandon the thriving mart of  London itself for a time to the fury of the natives, before the Roman  sway could be restored.    The ground rising both from the northern bank of the Thames, some  three hundred yards distant, and from the eastern bank of the Fleet  beck, forms an eminence. Here, to protect the riverside mart below, on  or about the site of the present churchyard the Romans formed a camp;  and looking down what is now Ludgate Hill, the soldiers could see the  Fleet ebbing and flowing with each receding and advancing tide.  Northwards the country afforded a hunting ground, and a temple to  Diana Venatrix would naturally be erected. During the excavations for  New St. Paul's, Roman urns were found as well as British graves; and  in 1830, a stone altar with an image of Diana was likewise found while  digging for the foundations of Goldsmith's Hall in Foster Lane. On  such incomplete evidence rests the accuracy of the story or tradition  that a temple of Diana occupied part of the site of the present  Cathedral.    Suetonius himself restored order in London; and in spite of  insurrections, she progressed during the next three centuries to  become a centre of such importance, Roman highways spreading in  different directions, that the accurate and impartial Ammianus  Marcellinus concedes to her (_circa_ 380) the style and title of  Augusta. And it was during these three centuries of progress that  Christianity obtained a firm footing, but when and how we know not.  The picturesque story, which deceived even Bede, how that Lucius,  \"king of the Britons,\" sent letters to Eleutherus, a holy man, Bishop  of Rome, entreating Eleutherus to convert him and his, must now be put  down as a pious forgery.[2] Tertullian (_circa_ 208) says that the  kingdom and name of Christ were then acknowledged even in those parts  inaccessible to the Romans; and we are probably on the safe side in  asserting that missions had been successfully introduced into London  by the end of the second century. Neither are we in much doubt or  difficulty as to whence they came. Gaul, visited by missionaries from  Ephesus, in turn sent others on; and the Church in London, as  throughout these Isles, in Romano-British times can be safely  described as a daughter of Gaul, and a granddaughter of the Ephesus of  St. Timothy. Beyond we know little, if anything at all, more than that  a Bishop of London, known by the Latinised name of RESTITUTUS, was one  of three British prelates at the Council of Aries (314). And while  there is no reason to suppose otherwise than that the bishops, of whom  Restitutus could not have been anything like the first, had their  principal church erected in the neighbourhood, at least, of St. Paul's  churchyard and dedicated to that saint, neither site nor name can ever  be authenticated. When the Roman troops retired, so thoroughly did the  invading savages destroy all records, that our knowledge of the  British Church in London may be compared, not inaptly, to our  knowledge of Thornhill's paintings in the concave sphere of the dome.  We know that they exist; but even on a bright May day they are  invisible from below.    =Saxon, Angle, and Dane.=--In the early years of the fifth century the  Romans are stated to have finally abandoned this country. If certain  lists are to be credited, Bishops of London of the original British  series continued until the flight of Theorus in 586. These lists have  now been rejected,[3] although as the taking of London by the East  Saxons was not prior to the date above, there is reason in the  suggestion that church and bishop were still in existence. In the  pages of Bede, writing about a century later, we come across something  more definite, which readers interested in St. Paul's may care to  have.    \"In the year of our Lord 604, Augustine, Archbishop of Britain,  consecrated two bishops, viz., Mellitus and Justus; Mellitus to preach  to the province of the East Saxons, who are divided from Kent by the  river Thames, and border on the eastern sea. Their metropolis is the  city of London, situated on the bank of the aforesaid river, and is  the mart of many nations resorting to it by sea and land. At that time  Sabert, nephew to Ethelbert [Augustine's King of Kent] by his sister  Ricula, reigned over the nation, though under subjection to Ethelbert,  who had command over all the nations of the English as far as the  river Humber. But when this province [East Saxons] also received the  word of truth by the preaching of Mellitus, King Ethelbert built the  church of St. Paul in the city of London, where he and his successors  should have their episcopal seat.\"[4]    Bede, in one sense most interesting, becomes in a second sense most  irritating. We would give much to know how long an interval had  elapsed since the last bishop, whether this rude East Saxon building  was erected on the ruins of another or on a different site, whether  the name ST. PAUL'S was a continuation or no. Bede is silent,  ignoring the distressed and defeated Britons as an inferior race.    Ethelbert may have given the endowment of Tillingham in Essex. \"And if  any one should be tempted to take away this gift, let him be anathema  and excommunicated from all Christian society.\" Whether the deed with  these lines originated with him or with some unknown and later donor,  it is certain that the language has been respected; for when the  valuable estates were alienated, this particular donation was reserved  for the fabric fund; and in consequence the Dean and Chapter are by  far the oldest county family in Essex.[5]    Sabert and Ethelbert were gathered to their fathers; and both were  succeeded by pagan sons. London and the East Saxon province or  kingdom--let us say Middlesex and Essex, with perhaps Herts--seem to  have been ruled by the three sons of Sabert in commission, who,  disregarding whatever thin veneer of Christianity they had found it  convenient to adopt during their father's lifetime, boldly  apostatised, and the East Saxons readily followed. Entering St.  Paul's, as the bishop was celebrating, the three scoffed and mocked,  \"We will not enter into that laver, because we do not know we stand in  need of it; but eat of that bread we will.\" Giving the bishop the  alternative of compliance or expulsion, he"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/25267"],[0,"Astronomy for Amateurs (#2)"],[1,"us, and splendid. Dreams of  the Ideal, even of the Inaccessible, weave their subtle spells upon us.  The imagination soars aloft, and aspires to the sources of Eternal  Beauty.    What greater delight can be conceived, on a fine spring evening, at the  hour when the crescent moon is shining in the West amid the last glimmer  of twilight, than the contemplation of that grand and silent spectacle  of the stars stepping forth in sequence in the vast Heavens? All sounds  of life die out upon the earth, the last notes of the sleepy birds have  sunk away, the Angelus of the church hard by has rung the close of day.  But if life is arrested around us, we may seek it in the Heavens. These  incandescing orbs are so many points of interrogation suspended above  our heads in the inaccessible depths of space.... Gradually they  multiply. There is Venus, the white star of the shepherd. There Mars,  the little celestial world so near our own. There the giant Jupiter.  The seven stars of the Great Bear seem to point out the pole, while they  slowly revolve around it.... What is this nebulous light that blanches  the darkness of the heavens, and traverses the constellations like a  celestial path? It is the Galaxy, the Milky Way, composed of millions on  millions of suns!... The darkness is profound, the abyss immense....  See! Yonder a shooting star glides silently across the sky, and  disappears!...    Who can remain insensible to this magic spectacle of the starry Heavens?  Where is the mind that is not attracted to these enigmas? The  intelligence of the amateur, the feminine, no less than the more  material and prosaic masculine mind, is well adapted to the  consideration of astronomical problems. Women, indeed, are naturally  predisposed to these contemplative studies. And the part they are called  to play in the education of our children is so vast, and so important,  that the elements of Astronomy might well be taught by the young mother  herself to the budding minds that are curious about every issue--whose  first impressions are so keen and so enduring.    Throughout the ages women have occupied themselves successfully with  Astronomy, not merely in its contemplative and descriptive, but also in  its mathematical aspects. Of such, the most illustrious was the  beautiful and learned Hypatia of Alexandria, born in the year 375 of our  era, public lecturer on geometry, algebra, and astronomy, and author of  three works of great importance. Then, in that age of ignorance and  fanaticism, she fell a victim to human stupidity and malice, was dragged  from her chariot while crossing the Cathedral Square, in March, 415,  stripped of her garments, stoned to death, and burned as a dishonored  witch!    Among the women inspired with a passion for the Heavens may be cited St.  Catherine of Alexandria, admired for her learning, her beauty and her  virtue. She was martyred in the reign of Maximinus Daza, about the year  312, and has given her name to one of the lunar rings.    Another celebrated female mathematician was Madame Hortense Lepaute,  born in 1723, who collaborated with Clairaut in the immense calculations  by which he predicted the return of Halley's Comet. \"Madame Lepaute,\"  wrote Lalande, \"gave us such immense assistance that, without her, we  should never have ventured to undertake this enormous labor, in which it  was necessary to calculate for every degree, and for a hundred and fifty  years, the distances and forces of the planets acting by their  attraction on the comet. During more than six months, we calculated from  morning to night, sometimes even at table, and as the result of this  forced labor I contracted an illness that has changed my constitution  for life; but it was important to publish the result before the arrival  of the comet.\"    This extract will suffice for the appreciation of the scientific ardor  of Madame Lepaute. We are indebted to her for some considerable works.  Her husband was clock-maker to the King. \"To her intellectual talents,\"  says one of her biographers, \"were joined all the qualities of the  heart. She was charming to a degree, with an elegant figure, a dainty  foot, and such a beautiful hand that Voiriot, the King's painter, who  had made a portrait of her, asked permission to copy it, in order to  preserve a model of the best in Nature.\" And then we are told that  learned women can not be good-looking!...    The Marquise du Chatelet was no less renowned. She was predestined to  her career, if the following anecdote be credible. Gabrielle-Emilie de  Breteuil, born in 1706 (who, in 1725, was to marry the Marquis du  Chatelet, becoming, in 1733, the most celebrated friend of Voltaire),  was four or five years old when she was given an old compass, dressed up  as a doll, for a plaything. After examining this object for some time,  the child began angrily and impatiently to strip off the silly draperies  the toy was wrapped in, and after turning it over several times in her  little hands, she divined its uses, and traced a circle with it on a  sheet of paper. To her, among other things, we owe a precious, and  indeed the only French, translation of Newton's great work on universal  gravitation, the famous Principia, and she was, with Voltaire, an  eloquent propagator of the theory of attraction, rejected at that time  by the Academie des Sciences.    Numbers of other women astronomers might be cited, all showing how  accessible this highly abstract science is to the feminine intellect.  President des Brosses, in his charming Voyage en Italie, tells of the  visit he paid in Milan to the young Italian, Marie Agnesi, who delivered  harangues in Latin, and was acquainted with seven languages, and for  whom mathematics held no secrets. She was devoted to algebra and  geometry, which, she said, \"are the only provinces of thought wherein  peace reigns.\" Madame de Charriere expressed herself in an aphorism of  the same order: \"An hour or two of mathematics sets my mind at liberty,  and puts me in good spirits; I feel that I can eat and sleep better when  I have seen obvious and indisputable truths. This consoles me for the  obscurities of religion and metaphysics, or rather makes me forget them;  I am thankful there is something positive in this world.\" And did not  Madame de Blocqueville, last surviving daughter of Marshal Davout, who  died in 1892, exclaim in her turn: \"Astronomy, science of sciences! by  which I am attracted, and terrified, and which I adore! By it my soul is  detached from the things of this world, for it draws me to those unknown  spheres that evoked from Newton the triumphant cry: '_Coeli enarrant  gloriam Dei!_'\"    Nor must we omit Miss Caroline Herschel, sister of the greatest observer  of the Heavens, the grandest discoverer of the stars, that has ever  lived. Astronomy gave her a long career; she discovered no less than  seven comets herself, and her patient labors preserved her to the age of  ninety-eight.--And Mrs. Somerville, to whom we owe the English  translation of Laplace's Mecanique celeste, of whom Humboldt said, \"In  pure mathematics, Mrs. Somerville is absolutely superior.\" Like Caroline  Herschel, she was almost a centenarian, appearing always much younger  than her years: she died at Naples, in 1872, at the age of  ninety-two.--So, too, the Russian Sophie Kovalevsky, descendant of  Mathias Corvinus, King of Hungary, who, an accomplished mathematician at  sixteen, married at eighteen, in order to follow the curriculum at the  University (then forbidden to unmarried women); arranging with her young  husband to live as brother and sister until their studies should be  completed. In 1888 the Prix Bordin of the Institut was conferred on  her.--And Maria Mitchell of the United States, for whom Le Verrier gave  a _fete_ at the Observatory of Paris, and who was exceptionally  authorized by Pope Pius IX to visit the Observatory of the Roman  College, at that time an ecclesiastical establishment, closed to  women.--And Madame Scarpellini, the Roman astronomer, renowned for her  works on shooting stars, whom the author had the honor of visiting, in  company with Father Secchi, Director of the Observatory mentioned above.    At the present time, Astronomy is proud to reckon among its most famous  workers Miss Agnes Clerke, the learned Irishwoman, to whom we owe,  _inter alia_, an excellent History of Astronomy in the Nineteenth  Century;--Mrs. Isaac Roberts, who, under the familiar name of Miss  Klumpke, sat on the Council of the Astronomical Society of France, and  is D. Sc. of the Faculty of Paris and head of the Bureau for measuring  star photographs at the Observatory of Paris (an American who became  English by her marriage with the astronomer Roberts, but is not  forgotten in France);--Mrs. Fleming, one of the astronomers of the  Observatory at Harvard College, U.S.A., to whom we owe the discovery of  a great number of variable stars by the examination of photographic  records, and by spectral photography;--Lady Huggins, who in England is  the learned collaborator of her illustrious husband;--and many others.           *       *       *       *       *    The following chapters, which aim at summing up the essentials of  Astronomy in twelve lessons for amateurs, will not make astronomers or  mathematicians of my readers--much less prigs or pedants. They are  designed to show the constitution of the Universe, in its grandeur and  its beauty, so that, inhabiting this world, we may know where we are  living, may realize our position in the Cosmos, appreciate Creation as  it is, and enjoy it to better advantage. This sun by which we live, this  succession of months and years, of days and nights, the apparent motions  of the heavens, these starry skies, the divine rays of the moon, the  whole totality of things, constitutes in some sort the tissue of our  existence, and it is indeed extraordinary that the inhabitants of our  planet should almost all have"]]]
