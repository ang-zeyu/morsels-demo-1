[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/2846"],[0,"The Life of Flavius Josephus (#2)"],[1," instructions, I came into  Galilee, and found the people of Sepphoris in no small agony about their  country, by reason that the Galileans had resolved to plunder it, on  account of the friendship they had with the Romans, and because they  had given their right hand, and made a league with Cestius Gallus, the  president of Syria. But I delivered them all out of the fear they were  in, and persuaded the multitude to deal kindly with them, and permitted  them to send to those that were their own hostages with Gessius to Dora,  which is a city of Phoenicia, as often as they pleased; though I still  found the inhabitants of Tiberias ready to take arms, and that on the  occasion following:--    9. There were three factions in this city. The first was composed of men  of worth and gravity; of these Julius Capellus was the head. Now he, as  well as all his companions, Herod the son of Miarus, and Herod the son  of Gamalus, and Compsus the son of Compsus; [for as to Compsus's brother  Crispus, who had once been governor of the city under the great king  [Agrippa] [8] he was beyond Jordan in his own possessions;] all these  persons before named gave their advice, that the city should then  continue in their allegiance to the Romans and to the king. But Pistus,  who was guided by his son Justus, did not acquiesce in that resolution;  otherwise he was himself naturally of a good and virtuous character.  But the second faction was composed of the most ignoble persons, and was  determined for war. But as for Justus, the son of Pistus, who was the  head of the third faction, although he pretended to be doubtful about  going to war, yet was he really desirous of innovation, as supposing  that he should gain power to himself by the change of affairs. He  therefore came into the midst of them, and endeavored to inform the  multitude that \"the city Tiberius had ever been a city of Galilee,  and that in the days of Herod the tetrarch, who had built it, it had  obtained the principal place, and that he had ordered that the city  Sepphoris should be subordinate to the city Tiberias; that they had not  lost this preeminence even under Agrippa the father, but had retained it  until Felix was procurator of Judea. But he told them, that now they had  been so unfortunate as to be made a present by Nero to Agrippa, junior;  and that, upon Sepphoris's submission of itself to the Romans, that was  become the capital city of Galilee, and that the royal library and the  archives were now removed from them.\" When he had spoken these things,  and a great many more, against king Agrippa, in order to provoke the  people to a revolt, he added that \"this was the time for them to take  arms, and join with the Galileans as their confederates [whom they might  command, and who would now willingly assist them, out of the hatred they  bare to the people of Sepphoris; because they preserved their fidelity  to the Romans], and to gather a great number of forces, in order to  punish them.\" And as he said this, he exhorted the multitude, [to go to  war;] for his abilities lay in making harangues to the people, and in  being too hard in his speeches for such as opposed him, though they  advised what was more to their advantage, and this by his craftiness and  his fallacies, for he was not unskilful in the learning of the Greeks;  and in dependence on that skill it was, that he undertook to write  a history of these affairs, as aiming, by this way of haranguing, to  disguise the truth. But as to this man, and how ill were his character  and conduct of life, and how he and his brother were, in great measure,  the authors of our destruction, I shall give the reader an account in  the progress of my narration. So when Justus had, by his persuasions,  prevailed with the citizens of Tiberias to take arms, nay, and had  forced a great many so to do against their wills, he went out, and set  the villages that belonged to Gadara and Hippos on fire; which  villages were situated on the borders of Tiberias, and of the region of  Scythopolis.    10. And this was the state Tiberias was now in. But as for Gischala,  its affairs were thus:-- When John, the son of Levi, saw some of the  citizens much elevated upon their revolt from the Romans, he labored to  restrain them, and entreated them that they would keep their allegiance  to them. But he could not gain his purpose, although he did his  endeavors to the utmost; for the neighboring people of Gadara, Gabara,  and Sogana, with the Tyrians, got together a great army, and fell upon  Gischala, and took Gischala by force, and set it on fire; and when they  had entirely demolished it, they returned home. Upon which John was so  enraged, that he armed all his men, and joined battle with the people  forementioned; and rebuilt Gischala after a manner better than before,  and fortified it with walls for its future security.    11. But Gamala persevered in its allegiance to the Romans, for the  reason following:-- Philip, the son of Jacimus, who was their governor  under king Agrippa, had been unexpectedly preserved when the royal  palace at Jerusalem had been besieged; but, as he fled away, had fallen  into another danger, and that was, of being killed by Manahem, and the  robbers that were with him; but certain Babylonians, who were of his  kindred, and were then in Jerusalem, hindered the robbers from executing  their design. So Philip staid there four days, and fled away on the  fifth, having disguised himself with fictitious hair, that he might  not be discovered; and when he was come to one of the villages to him  belonging, but one that was situated at the borders of the citadel of  Gamala, he sent to some of those that were under him, and commanded them  to come to him. But God himself hindered that his intention, and this  for his own advantage also; for had it not so happened, he had certainly  perished. For a fever having seized upon him immediately, he wrote to  Agrippa and Bernice, and gave them to one of his freed-men to carry them  to Varus, who at this time was procurator of the kingdom, which the king  and his sister had intrusted him withal, while they were gone to Berytus  with an intention of meeting Gessius. When Varus had received these  letters of Philip, and had learned that he was preserved, he was very  uneasy at it, as supposing that he should appear useless to the king and  his sister, now Philip was come. He therefore produced the carrier of  the letters before the multitude, and accused him of forging the same;  and said that he spake falsely when he related that Philip was at  Jerusalem, fighting among the Jews against the Romans. So he slew him.  And when this freed-man of Philip did not return again, Philip was  doubtful what should be the occasion of his stay, and sent a second  messenger with letters, that he might, upon his return, inform him what  had befallen the other that had been sent before, and why he tarried  so long. Varus accused this messenger also, when he came, of telling a  falsehood, and slew him. For he was puffed up by the Syrians that were  at Caesarea, and had great expectations; for they said that Agrippa  would be slain by the Romans for the crimes which the Jews had  committed, and that he should himself take the government, as derived  from their kings; for Varus was, by the confession of all, of the royal  family, as being a descendant of Sohemus, who had enjoyed a tetrarchy  about Libanus; for which reason it was that he was puffed up, and kept  the letters to himself. He contrived, also, that the king should not  meet with those writings, by guarding all the passes, lest any one  should escape, and inform the king what had been done. He moreover slew  many of the Jews, in order to gratify the Syrians of Cesarea. He had a  mind also to join with the Trachonites in Batanea, and to take up arms  and make an assault upon the Babylonian Jews that were at Ecbatana; for  that was the name they went by. He therefore called to him twelve of  the Jews of Cesarea, of the best character, and ordered them to go to  Ecbatana, and inform their countrymen who dwelt there, That Varus hath  heard that \"you intend to march against the king; but, not believing  that report, he hath sent us to persuade you to lay down your arms, and  that this compliance will be a sign that he did well not to give credit  to those that raised the report concerning you.\" He also enjoined them  to send seventy of their principal men to make a defense for them as to  the accusation laid against them. So when the twelve messengers came  to their countrymen at Ecbatana, and found that they had no designs of  innovation at all, they persuaded them to send the seventy men also;  who, not at all suspecting what would come, sent them accordingly.  So these seventy went down to Caesarea, together with the twelve  ambassadors; where Varus met them with the king's forces, and slew them  all, together with the [twelve] [9] ambassadors, and made an expedition  against the Jews of Ecbatana. But one there was of the seventy who  escaped, and made haste to inform the Jews of their coming; upon which  they took their arms, with their wives and children, and retired to the  citadel at Gamala, leaving their own villages full of all sorts of good  things, and having many ten thousands of cattle therein. When Philip  was informed of these things, he also came to the citadel of Gamala; and  when he was come, the multitude cried aloud, and desired him to resume  the government, and to make an expedition against Varus, and the Syrians  of Cesarea; for it was reported that they had slain the king. But Philip  restrained their zeal, and put them in mind of the benefits the king had  bestowed upon them; and told them how powerful the Romans were, and said  it was not for their advantage to make war with them; and at length he  prevailed with them. But now, when the king was acquainted with Varus's  design, which was to cut off"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/28466"],[0,"A Catalogue of Play Equipment (#2)"],[1,"is nailed to two uprights (2\" X 3\" X 5'-0\") set 5' apart and  extending 34\" above ground. An overhang of about 6\" is allowed at each  end of the bar.    [Illustration: The sand box.]*      THE SAND BOX    The sloping cover to the sand box pictured here has been found to have  many uses besides its obvious purpose of protection against stray  animals and dirt. It is a fairly good substitute for the old-time  cellar door, that most important dramatic property of a play era past  or rapidly passing.    [Illustration: Sand box with cover closed.]*    [Illustration: Box village.]*      BOX VILLAGE    The child is to be pitied who has not at some time revelled in a  packing-box house big enough to get into and furnished by his own  efforts. But a \"village\" of such houses offers a greatly enlarged  field of play opportunity and has been the basis of Miss Mary Rankin's  experiment on the Teachers College Playground.[B]    In addition to its more obvious possibilities for constructive and  manual development, Miss Rankin's experiment offers social features  of unusual suggestiveness, for the village provides a civic experience  fairly comprehensive and free from the artificiality that is apt to  characterize attempts to introduce civic content into school and play  procedure.    [Footnote B: See \"Teachers College Playground,\" Bulletin No. 4, Bureau  of Educational Experiments.]    [Illustration: Of interest to carpenters.]    [Illustration: A boom in real estate.]    [Illustration: Boy playing pretend piano.]*          INDOOR EQUIPMENT      The requisites for indoor equipment are these:      A Suitable Floor--The natural place for a little child to play is    the floor and it is therefore the sine qua non of the play    laboratory.      Places to Keep Things--A maximum of convenience to facilitate habits    of order.      Tables and Chairs--For use as occasion demands, to supplement the    floor, not to take the place of it.      Blocks and Toys--For initial play material.      The Carpenter's Bench--With tools and lumber for the manufacture of    supplementary toys.      A supply of Art and Craft materials--For the same purpose.    [Illustration: The Indoor Laboratory.]          THE INDOOR LABORATORY      The _floor_ should receive first consideration in planning the indoor  laboratory. It should be as spacious as circumstances will permit and  safe, that is to say clean and protected from draughts and dampness.    A well-kept hardwood floor is the best that can be provided.  Individual light rugs or felt mats can be used for the younger  children to sit on in cold weather if any doubt exists as to the  adequacy of heating facilities (see cut, p. 32).    Battleship linoleum makes a good substitute for a hardwood finish. It  comes in solid colors and can be kept immaculate.    Deck canvas stretched over a layer of carpet felt and painted makes a  warm covering, especially well adapted to the needs of very little  children, as it has some of the softness of a carpet and yet can be  scrubbed and mopped.    Second only in importance is the supply of _lockers_, _shelves_,  _boxes_ and _drawers_ for the disposal of the great number and variety  of small articles that make up the \"tools and appliances\" of the  laboratory. The cut on page 24 shows a particularly successful  arrangement for facilities of this kind.    The _chairs_ shown are the Mosher kindergarten chairs, which come in  three sizes. The light _tables_ can be folded by the children and put  away in the biggest cupboard space (p. 24).    _Block boxes_ are an essential part of the equipment. Their dimensions  should be planned in relation to the unit block of the set used. Those  shown are 13-3/4\" X 16-1/2\" X 44\" (inside measurements) for use with a  set having a unit 1-3/8\" X 2-3/4\" X 5-1/2\". They are on castors and  can be rolled to any part of the room.    The low _blackboards_ are 5'-5\" in height and 2'-0\" from the floor.    All the furnishings of the laboratory should lend themselves to use as  dramatic properties when occasion demands, and a few may be kept for  such purposes alone. The light screens in the right-hand corner of the  room are properties of this kind and are put to an endless number of  uses (see cut, p. 40).    [Illustration: The balcony in a room with high ceiling.]    [Illustration: The balcony and a low ceiling.]    The _balcony_ is a device to increase floor space that has been used  successfully in The Play School for several years. It is very popular  with the children and contributes effectively to many play schemes.  The tall block construction representing an elevator shaft shown in  the picture opposite would never have reached its \"Singer Tower  proportions\" without the balcony, first to suggest the project and  then to aid in its execution.    _Drop shelves_ like those along the wall of the \"gallery\" (p. 22) can  be used for some purposes instead of tables when space is limited.    Materials for storekeeping play fill the shelves next the fireplace,  and the big crock on the hearth contains modelling clay, the raw  material of such objets d'art as may be seen decorating the  mantlepiece in the cut on page 20.    [Illustration: A place for everything]    [Illustration: The indoor sandbox.]*      THE INDOOR SAND BOX    The indoor _Sand Box_ pictured here was designed by Mrs. Hutchinson  for use in the nursery at Stony Ford. A box of this kind is ideal for  the enclosed porch or terrace and a great resource in rainy weather.    The usual kindergarten sand table cannot provide the same play  opportunity that is afforded by a floor box, but it presents fewer  problems to the housekeeper and is always a valuable adjunct to indoor  equipment.    [Illustration: The Carpenter Bench.]*      THE CARPENTER BENCH    The carpenter equipment must be a \"sure-enough business affair,\" and  the tools real tools--not toys.    The Sheldon bench shown here is a real bench in every particular  except size. The tool list is as follows:        Manual training hammer.      18 point cross-cut saw.      9 point rip saw.      Large screw driver, wooden handle.      Small screw driver.      Nail puller.      Stanley smooth-plane, No. 3.      Bench hook.      Brace and set of twist bits.      Manual training rule.      Steel rule.      Tri square.      Utility box--with assorted nails, screws, etc.      Combination India oil stone.      Oil can.      Small hatchet.    Choice of lumber must be determined partly by the viewpoint of the  adult concerned, largely by the laboratory budget, and finally by the  supply locally available. Excellent results have sometimes been  achieved where only boxes from the grocery and left-over pieces from  the carpenter shop have been provided. Such rough lumber affords good  experience in manipulation, and its use may help to establish habits  of adapting materials as we find them to the purposes we have in hand.  This is the natural attack of childhood, and it should be fostered,  for children can lose it and come to feel that specially prepared  materials are essential, and a consequent limitation to ingenuity and  initiative can thus be established.    On the other hand, some projects and certain stages of experience are  best served by a supply of good regulation stock. Boards of soft pine,  white wood, bass wood, or cypress in thicknesses of 1/4\", 3/8\", 1/2\"  and 7/8\" are especially well adapted for children's work, and \"stock  strips\" 1/4\" and 1/2\" thick and 2\" and 3\" wide lend themselves to many  purposes.    [Illustration: Boy painting toy.]*    [Illustration: Girl playing with dolls house.]*          TOYS      The proper basis of selection for toys is their efficiency as toys,  that is:      They must be suggestive of play and made for play.      They should be selected in relation to each other.      They should be consistent with the environment of the child who is    to use them.      They should be constructed simply so that they may serve as models    for other toys to be constructed by the children.      They should suggest something besides domestic play so that the    child's interest may be led to activities outside the home life.      They should be durable because they are the realities of a child's    world and deserve the dignity of good workmanship.    [Illustration: Children re-create the world as they see it with the  equipment they have at hand]    [Illustration: A house of blocks.]*      FLOOR GAMES    \"There comes back to me the memory of an enormous room with its  ceiling going up to heaven.... It is the floor I think of chiefly,  over the oilcloth of which, assumed to be land, spread towns and  villages and forts of wooden bricks...the cracks and spaces of the  floor and the bare brown \"surround\" were the water channels and open  sea of that continent of mine....    \"Justice has never been done to bricks and soldiers by those who write  about toys--my bricks and my soldiers were my perpetual drama. I  recall an incessant variety of interests. There was the mystery and  charm of the complicated buildings one could make, with long passages  and steps and windows through which one could peep into their  intricacies, and by means of slips of card one could make slanting  ways in them, and send marbles rolling from top to base and thence out  into the hold of a waiting ship.... And there was commerce; the shops  and markets and storerooms full of nasturtium seed, thrift seed, lupin  beans and such-like provender from the garden; such stuff one stored  in match boxes and pill boxes or packed in sacks of old glove fingers  tied up with thread and sent off by wagons along the great military  road to the beleaguered fortress on the Indian frontier beyond the  worn places that were dismal swamps....    \"I find this empire of the floor much more vivid in my memory now than  many of the owners of the skirts and legs and boots that went gingerly  across its territories.\"    H.
