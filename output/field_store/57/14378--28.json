Alas! complete ignorance of them has unfortunately wrecked many a man  and many a woman, while a little knowledge of a subject generally  ignored by the masses would have enabled numbers of people to have  understood many things which they believed to be quite incomprehensible,  or which were not thought worthy of their consideration.          INTRODUCTION.      It may be interesting to some persons to learn how it came about that  Vatsyayana was first brought to light and translated into the English  language. It happened thus. While translating with the pundits the  'Anunga runga, or the stage of love,' reference was frequently found to  be made to one Vatsya. The sage Vatsya was of this opinion, or of that  opinion. The sage Vatsya said this, and so on. Naturally questions were  asked who the sage was, and the pundits replied that Vatsya was the  author of the standard work on love in Sanscrit literature, that no  Sanscrit library was complete without his work, and that it was most  difficult now to obtain in its entire state. The copy of the manuscript  obtained in Bombay was defective, and so the pundits wrote to Benares,  Calcutta and Jeypoor for copies of the manuscript from Sanscrit  libraries in those places. Copies having been obtained, they were then  compared with each other, and with the aid of a Commentary called  'Jayamangla' a revised copy of the entire manuscript was prepared, and  from this copy the English translation was made. The following is the  certificate of the chief pundit:--    \"The accompanying manuscript is corrected by me after comparing four  different copies of the work. I had the assistance of a Commentary  called 'Jayamangla' for correcting the portion in the first five parts,  but found great difficulty in correcting the remaining portion, because,  with the exception of one copy thereof which was tolerably correct, all  the other copies I had were far too incorrect. However, I took that  portion as correct in which the majority of the copies agreed with each  other.\"    The 'Aphorisms on Love,' by Vatsyayana, contains about one thousand two  hundred and fifty slokas or verses, and are divided into parts, parts  into chapters, and chapters into paragraphs. The whole consists of  seven parts, thirty-six chapters, and sixty-four paragraphs. Hardly  anything is known about the author. His real name is supposed to be  Mallinaga or Mrillana, Vatsyayana being his family name. At the close of  the work this is what he writes about himself:    \"After reading and considering the works of Babhravya and other ancient  authors, and thinking over the meaning of the rules given by them, this  treatise was composed, according to the precepts of the Holy Writ, for  the benefit of the world, by Vatsyayana, while leading the life of a  religious student at Benares, and wholly engaged in the contemplation of  the Deity. This work is not to be used merely as an instrument for  satisfying our desires. A person acquainted with the true principles of  this science, who preserves his Dharma (virtue or religious merit), his  Artha (worldly wealth) and his Kama (pleasure or sensual gratification),  and who has regard to the customs of the people, is sure to obtain the  mastery over his senses. In short, an intelligent and knowing person,  attending to Dharma and Artha and also to Kama, without becoming the  slave of his passions, will obtain success in everything that he may  do.\"    It is impossible to fix the exact date either of the life of Vatsyayana  or of his work. It is supposed that he must have lived between the first  and the sixth centuries of the Christian era, on the following  grounds:--He mentions that Satkarni Srtvahan, a king of Kuntal, killed  Malayevati his wife with an instrument called kartari by striking her in  the passion of love, and Vatsya quotes this case to warn people of the  danger arising from some old customs of striking women when under the  influence of this passion. Now this king of Kuntal is believed to have  lived and reigned during the first century A.C., and consequently Vatsya  must have lived after him. On the other hand, Virahamihira, in the  eighteenth chapter of his 'Brihatsanhita,' treats of the science of  love, and appears to have borrowed largely from Vatsyayana on the  subject. Now Virahamihira is said to have lived during the sixth century  A.D., and as Vatsya must have written his works previously, therefore  not earlier than the first century, A.C., and not later than the sixth  century A.D., must be considered as the approximate date of his  existence.    On the text of the 'Aphorisms on Love,' by Vatsyayana, only two  commentaries have been found. One called 'Jayamangla' or 'Sutrabashya,'  and the other 'Sutra vritti.' The date of the 'Jayamangla' is fixed  between the tenth and thirteenth centuries A.D., because while treating  of the sixty-four arts an example is taken from the 'Kavyaprakasha,'  which was written about the tenth century A.D. Again, the copy of the  commentary procured was evidently a transcript of a manuscript which  once had a place in the library of a Chaulukyan king named Vishaladeva,  a fact elicited from the following sentence at the end of it:--    \"Here ends the part relating to the art of love in the commentary on the  'Vatsyayana Kama Sutra,' a copy from the library of the king of kings,  Vishaladeva, who was a powerful hero, as it were a second Arjuna, and  head jewel of the Chaulukya family.\"    Now it is well known that this king ruled in Guzerat from 1244 to 1262  A.D., and founded a city called Visalnagur. The date, therefore, of the  commentary is taken to be not earlier than the tenth and not later than  the thirteenth century. The author of it is supposed to be one  Yashodhara, the name given him by his preceptor being Indrapada. He  seems to have written it during the time of affliction caused by his  separation from a clever and shrewd woman, at least that is what he  himself says at the end of each chapter. It is presumed that he called  his work after the name of his absent mistress, or the word may have  some connection with the meaning of her name.    This commentary was most useful in explaining the true meaning of  Vatsyayana, for the commentator appears to have had a considerable  knowledge of the times of the older author, and gives in some places  very minute information. This cannot be said of the other commentary,  called \"Sutra vritti,\" which was written about A.D., by Narsing Shastri,  a pupil of a Sarveshwar Shastri; the latter was a descendant of Bhaskur,  and so also was our author, for at the conclusion of every part he calls  himself Bhaskur Narsing Shastra. He was induced to write the work by  order of the learned Raja Vrijalala, while he was residing in Benares,  but as to the merits of this commentary it does not deserve much  commendation. In many cases the writer does not appear to have  understood the meaning of the original author, and has changed the text  in many places to fit in with his own explanations.    A complete translation of the original work now follows. It has been  prepared in complete accordance with the text of the manuscript, and is  given, without further comments, as made from it.          PART I.    THE VATSYAYANA SUTRA.    INTRODUCTORY PREFACE.    SALUTATION TO DHARMA, ARTHA AND KAMA.      In the beginning, the Lord of Beings created men and women, and in the  form of commandments in one hundred thousand chapters laid down rules  for regulating their existence with regard to Dharma,[1] Artha,[2] and  Kama.[3] Some of these commandments, namely those which treated of  Dharma, were separately written by Swayambhu Manu; those that related to  Artha were compiled by Brihaspati; and those that referred to Kama were  expounded by Nandi, the follower of Mahadeva, in one thousand chapters.    Now these 'Kama Sutra' (Aphorisms on Love), written by Nandi in one  thousand chapters, were reproduced by Shvetaketu, the son of Uddvalaka,  in an abbreviated form in five hundred chapters, and this work was again  similarly reproduced in an abridged form, in one hundred and fifty  chapters, by Babhravya, an inhabitant of the Punchala (South of Delhi)  country. These one hundred and fifty chapters were then put together  under seven heads or parts named severally--    1st. Sadharana (general topics).    2nd. Samprayogika (embraces, etc.).    3rd. Kanya Samprayuktaka (union of males and females).    4th. Bharyadhikarika (on one's own wife).    5th. Paradika (on the wives of other people).    6th. Vaisika (on courtesans).    7th. Aupamishadika (on the arts of seduction, tonic medicines, etc.).    The sixth part of this last work was separately expounded by Dattaka at  the request of the public women of Pataliputra (Patna), and in the same  way Charayana explained the first part of it. The remaining parts, viz.,  the second, third, fourth, fifth, and seventh were each separately  expounded by--    Suvarnanabha (second part).    Ghotakamukha (third part).    Gonardiya (fourth part).    Gonikaputra (fifth part).    Kuchumara (seventh part), respectively.    Thus the work being written in parts by different authors was almost  unobtainable, and as the parts which were expounded by Dattaka and the  others treated only of the particular branches of the subject to which  each part related, and moreover as the original work of Babhravya was  difficult to be mastered on account of its length, Vatsyayana,  therefore, composed his work in a small volume as an abstract of the  whole of the works of the above-named authors.

Thus the discussion continued.    This was the era when every man had but one desire, that of outdoing  others in ferocity and brutality, and but one care, that of saving his  own head by threatening that of his neighbour.    The great duel between the Titanic leaders of these turbulent parties,  the conflict between hot-headed Danton on the one side and cold-blooded  Robespierre on the other, had only just begun; the great, all-devouring  monsters had dug their claws into one another, but the issue of the  combat was still at stake.    Neither of these two giants had taken part in these deliberations anent  the new religion and the new goddess. Danton gave signs now and then  of the greatest impatience, and muttered something about a new form of  tyranny, a new kind of oppression.    On the left, Robespierre in immaculate sea-green coat and carefully  gauffered linen was quietly polishing the nails of his right hand  against the palm of his left.    But nothing escaped him of what was going on. His ferocious egoism, his  unbounded ambition was even now calculating what advantages to himself  might accrue from this idea of the new religion and of the National  fete, what personal aggrandisement he could derive therefrom.    The matter outwardly seemed trivial enough, but already his keen and  calculating mind had seen various side issues which might tend to place  him--Robespierre--on a yet higher and more unassailable pinnacle.    Surrounded by those who hated him, those who envied and those who feared  him, he ruled over them all by the strength of his own cold-blooded  savagery, by the resistless power of his merciless cruelty.    He cared about nobody but himself, about nothing but his own exaltation:  every action of his career, since he gave up his small practice in a  quiet provincial town in order to throw himself into the wild vortex  of revolutionary politics, every word he ever uttered had but one  aim--Himself.    He saw his colleagues and comrades of the old Jacobin Clubs ruthlessly  destroyed around him: friends he had none, and all left him indifferent;  and now he had hundreds of enemies in every assembly and club in Paris,  and these too one by one were being swept up in that wild whirlpool  which they themselves had created.    Impassive, serene, always ready with a calm answer, when passion  raged most hotly around him, Robespierre, the most ambitious, most  self-seeking demagogue of his time, had acquired the reputation of being  incorruptible and selfless, an enthusiastic servant of the Republic.    The sea-green Incorruptible!    And thus whilst others talked and argued, waxed hot over schemes for  processions and pageantry, or loudly denounced the whole matter as the  work of a traitor, he, of the sea-green coat, sat quietly polishing his  nails.    But he had already weighed all these discussions in the balance of his  mind, placed them in the crucible of his ambition, and turned them into  something that would benefit him and strengthen his position.    Aye! the feast should be brilliant enough! gay or horrible, mad or  fearful, but through it all the people of France must be made to feel  that there was a guiding hand which ruled the destinies of all, a head  which framed the new laws, which consolidated the new religion and  established its new goddess: the Goddess of Reason.    Robespierre, her prophet!          Chapter II: A Retrospect        The room was close and dark, filled with the smoke from a defective  chimney.    A tiny boudoir, once the dainty sanctum of imperious Marie Antoinette; a  faint and ghostly odour, like unto the perfume of spectres, seemed still  to cling to the stained walls, and to the torn Gobelin tapestries.    Everywhere lay the impress of a heavy and destroying hand: that of the  great and glorious Revolution.    In the mud-soiled corners of the room a few chairs, with brocaded  cushions rudely torn, leant broken and desolate against the walls. A  small footstool, once gilt-legged and satin-covered, had been overturned  and roughly kicked to one side, and there it lay on its back, like some  little animal that had been hurt, stretching its broken limbs upwards,  pathetic to behold.    From the delicately wrought Buhl table the silver inlay had been harshly  stripped out of its bed of shell.    Across the Lunette, painted by Boucher and representing a chaste  Diana surrounded by a bevy of nymphs, an uncouth hand had scribbled in  charcoal the device of the Revolution: Liberte, Egalite, Fraternite  ou la Mort; whilst, as if to give a crowning point to the work of  destruction and to emphasise its motto, someone had decorated the  portrait of Marie Antoinette with a scarlet cap, and drawn a red and  ominous line across her neck.    And at the table two men were sitting in close and eager conclave.    Between them a solitary tallow candle, unsnuffed and weirdly flickering,  threw fantastic shadows upon the walls, and illumined with fitful and  uncertain light the faces of the two men.    How different were these in character!    One, high cheek-boned, with coarse, sensuous lips, and hair elaborately  and carefully powdered; the other pale and thin-lipped, with the keen  eyes of a ferret and a high intellectual forehead, from which the sleek  brown hair was smoothly brushed away.    The first of these men was Robespierre, the ruthless and incorruptible  demagogue; the other was Citizen Chauvelin, ex-ambassador of the  Revolutionary Government at the English Court.    The hour was late, and the noises from the great, seething city  preparing for sleep came to this remote little apartment in the now  deserted Palace of the Tuileries, merely as a faint and distant echo.    It was two days after the Fructidor Riots. Paul Deroulede and the woman  Juliette Marny, both condemned to death, had been literally spirited  away out of the cart which was conveying them from the Hall of Justice  to the Luxembourg Prison, and news had just been received by the  Committee of Public Safety that at Lyons, the Abbe du Mesnil, with the  ci-devant Chevalier d'Egremont and the latter's wife and family, had  effected a miraculous and wholly incomprehensible escape from the  Northern Prison.    But this was not all. When Arras fell into the hands of the  Revolutionary army, and a regular cordon was formed round the town, so  that not a single royalist traitor might escape, some three score women  and children, twelve priests, the old aristocrats Chermeuil, Delleville  and Galipaux and many others, managed to pass the barriers and were  never recaptured.    Raids were made on the suspected houses: in Paris chiefly where the  escaped prisoners might have found refuge, or better still where their  helpers and rescuers might still be lurking. Foucquier Tinville, Public  Prosecutor, led and conducted these raids, assisted by that bloodthirsty  vampire, Merlin. They heard of a house in the Rue de l'Ancienne Comedie  where an Englishmen was said to have lodged for two days.    They demanded admittance, and were taken to the rooms where the  Englishman had stayed. These were bare and squalid, like hundreds of  other rooms in the poorer quarters of Paris. The landlady, toothless and  grimy, had not yet tidied up the one where the Englishman had slept: in  fact she did not know he had left for good.    He had paid for his room, a week in advance, and came and went as he  liked, she explained to Citizen Tinville. She never bothered about him,  as he never took a meal in the house, and he was only there two days.  She did not know her lodger was English until the day he left. She  thought he was a Frenchman from the South, as he certainly had a  peculiar accent when he spoke.    \"It was the day of the riots,\" she continued; \"he would go out, and I  told him I did not think that the streets would be safe for a foreigner  like him: for he always wore such very fine clothes, and I made sure  that the starving men and women of Paris would strip them off his back  when their tempers were roused. But he only laughed. He gave me a bit of  paper and told me that if he did not return I might conclude that he had  been killed, and if the Committee of Public Safety asked me questions  about me, I was just to show the bit of paper and there would be no  further trouble.\"    She had talked volubly, more than a little terrified at Merlin's scowls,  and the attitude of Citizen Tinville, who was known to be very severe if  anyone committed any blunders.    But the Citizeness--her name was Brogard and her husband's brother kept  an inn in the neighbourhood of Calais--the Citizeness Brogard had a  clear conscience. She held a license from the Committee of Public Safety  for letting apartments, and she had always given due notice to the  Committee of the arrival and departure of her lodgers. The only thing  was that if any lodger paid her more than ordinarily well for the  accommodation and he so desired it, she would send in the notice  conveniently late, and conveniently vaguely worded as to the  description, status and nationality of her more liberal patrons.    This had occurred in the case of her recent English visitor.    But she did not explain it quite like that to Citizen Foucquier Tinville  or to Citizen Merlin.    However, she was rather frightened, and produced the scrap of paper  which the Englishman had left with her, together with the assurance that  when she showed it there would be no further trouble.    Tinville took it roughly out of her hand, but would not glance at it.  He crushed it into a ball and then Merlin snatched it from him with a  coarse laugh, smoothed out the creases on his knee and studied it for a  moment.    There were two lines of what looked like poetry, written in a language  which Merlin did not understand. English, no doubt.    But what was perfectly clear, and easily comprehended by any one, was  the little drawing in the corner, done in red ink"]]]
