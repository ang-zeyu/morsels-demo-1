The embryo averages one inch in length.    At _two months_ the rudiments of the extremities become more prominent.  The forearm and hand can be distinguished but not the arm above the  elbow; the hand is larger than the forearm, but is not supplied with  fingers. The sex cannot yet be determined. The length of the embryo is  from one inch and a half to two inches, and it weighs from three to five  drachms. The eyes are discernible, but still uncovered by the  rudimentary lids. The nose forms an obtuse eminence, the nostrils are  rounded and separated, the mouth is gaping and the epidermis can be  distinguished from the true skin.    At _ten weeks_ the embryo is from one and a half to two and a half  inches long, and its weight is from one ounce to an ounce and a half,  the eyelids are more developed and descend in front of the eyes; the  mouth begins to be closed by the development of the lips. The walls of  the chest are more completely formed, so that it is no longer possible  to see the movements of the heart. The fingers become distinct and the  toes appear as small projections webbed together like a frog's foot. At  about this period the sexual organs show their development as follows:  On each side of the urinary locality an oblong fold becomes  distinguishable; in course of progress if these folds remain separate, a  little tubercle forms in the anterior commissure which becomes the  clitoris; the nymphae develop, the urethra forms between them, and the  female sex is determined. If, on the other hand, these folds unite into  a rounded projection the scrotum is formed, the little tubercle above  becomes the penis and hence the male sex. The testicles forming within  the body, descend later into the scrotum, and organs similar to them,  their counterparts, form in the female and are called ovaries. These  ovaries are found attached to an organ called the womb, and this again  is united with the vagina, which leads downwards and outwards between  the labia majora.[B]      [B] For fuller particulars see Guernsey's Obstetrics.    At the end of the _third month_ the weight of the embryo is from three  to four ounces and its length from four to five inches, the eyeballs are  seen through the lids, the pupils of the eyes are discernible, the  forehead, nose and lips can be clearly distinguished. The finger nails  resemble thin membranous plates, the skin shows more firmness, but is  still rosy-hued, thin and transparent. The sex can now be fully  determined.    At the end of the _fourth month_ the product of conception is no longer  called an embryo, but a foetus. The body is from six to eight inches in  length and weighs six or seven ounces. A few little white hairs are seen  scattered over the scalp. The development of the face is still  imperfect. The eyes are now closed by their lids, the nostrils are  well-formed, the mouth is shut in by the lips and the sex is still more  sharply defined. The tongue may be observed far back in the mouth, and  the lower part of the face is rounded off by what a little later will be  a well-formed chin. The movements of the foetus are by this time plainly  felt by the mother, and if born at this time it may live several months.    At the end of the _fifth month_ the body of the foetus is from seven to  nine inches long and weighs from eight to eleven ounces. The skin has a  fairer appearance and more consistence; the eyes can no longer be  distinguished through the lids, owing to the increased thickness of the  latter. The head, heart and kidneys are large and well developed. At the  end of the _sixth month_ the foetus is from eleven to twelve and a half  inches in length, and weighs about sixteen ounces, more or less. The  hair upon the scalp is thicker and longer, the eyes remain closed, and  very delicate hairs may be seen upon the margins of the eye-lids and  upon the eye-brows. The nails are solid, the scrotum small and empty,  the surface of the skin appears wrinkled but the dermis may be  distinguished from the epidermis. The liver is large and red, and the  gall-bladder contains fluid.    At the end of the _seventh month_ the length of the foetus is from  twelve and a half to fourteen inches, its weight is about fifty-five  ounces, and it is both well defined and well proportioned in all its  parts. The bones of the cranium, hitherto quite flat, now appear a  little arched, and as the process of ossification goes on, the arching  increases till the vault is quite complete. The brain presents greater  firmness, and the eye-lids are opened. The skin is much firmer and red.  The gall-bladder contains bile.    At the end of the _eighth month_ the foetus seems to thicken up rather  than to increase in length, since it is only from sixteen to eighteen  inches long while its weight increases from four to five pounds. The  skin is red, and characterized at this period by a fine downy covering,  over which is spread a quantity of thick viscous matter, called the  sebaceous coat, which has been forming since the latter part of the  fifth month. The lower jaw has now become as long as the upper one, and  in the male the left testicle may be found in the scrotum. Convolutions  appear in the brain structure.    At _nine months_ the anxious time of parturition has arrived. The foetus  is from nineteen to twenty-three inches in length and weighs on an  average from six to eight pounds. Children at birth sometimes weigh as  much as fourteen pounds; but such extremes are very rare. At this period  the white and grey matter of the brain are distinct, and the  convolutions are well marked; the nails assume a horny consistence, hair  upon the head is more or less abundant, the testes are in the scrotum,  and the entire external genital organs of both male and female are well  formed.    The above particulars respecting the development of the human being have  been narrated to show that one organ is just as important as another,  and that each is really dependent upon the other; no one could exist  without the other and all are to subserve a use. First must be the  _esse_ (the inmost) the vital force imparted to the ovule. A little  later certain changes take place in the ovule, later still other  changes, and finally about the fifteenth day a slight development of the  new human being can just be outlined by the help of the microscope,  which, as before stated, has form at about the third week after  conception. First the vestige of a head and body, a little later the  heart and lungs appear lying in the open chest; then the hands are  protruded from the sides of the trunk, afterwards the forearms, then the  arms, all pushed out from the body; the feet and legs gradually protrude  from the lower end of the trunk, and the chest closes up so that the  heart and lungs can no longer be seen; the face, mouth and eyes take  form, the external genital organs make their appearance in conjunction  with other developments, and in due course of time the boy or girl is  born ready for further developments in childhood, and adolescence. When  the latter development has been attained, if due care has been taken by  all interested parties, we have pure men and pure women fitted to enter  upon the privileges and the _uses_ of a wedded life according to the  design of our Creator.    How wonderfully and how instructively are all organs in the animal body  disposed and arranged! In the highest place we find the brain to govern  and rule over all below. It is the first organ formed and in an orderly  life should control all the others. Next in order and importance are the  heart and lungs, which put into motion all other parts and enable the  animal frame to continue in motion. So each and every organ is developed  in its proper order, all to obey the commands of the first and most  important--the brain, the seat of the reason and the will. Happy are  they of either sex who will govern themselves by a pure enlightened  reason and a pure affectionate will.          CHAPTER II.    The Infant.    Embracing the First Year of the Child's Life.      The battle of life really begins as soon as the child is born. Its  cleanliness, its clothing, its temperature and its food are matters for  daily observance and care, as also are the light, sunshine and air which  it is to breathe. Opiates, soothing syrups and cordials, are to be  strictly avoided as being deleterious to health; proper sanitary  measures usually suffice to render all _dosing_ unnecessary. Spirituous  potions and lotions should be avoided as being contrary to the laws of  hygiene as well as for fear the child may learn to love and to become  addicted to their use later in life. Every organ of the body should be  carefully protected even at this early age, so that health may reign  supreme. Particular care and the utmost solicitude should be bestowed  upon the genital organs. No rubbing or handling of these parts should be  permitted under any pretense whatever--beyond what may be absolutely  necessary for cleanliness. The genital organs require just as much  watchful care, if not more, as the stomach, the eye, the ear, &c. I  regret to say that I have known some fathers to tickle the genital  organs of their infant boys until a complete erection of the little  penis ensued, which effect pleases the father as an evidence of a robust  boy. The evil effects of such a procedure are too manifest to require  dilating upon. Fathers take warning!    Nurses are known to quiet young children by gently exciting pleasurable  sensations about the genital organs both of males and females--practices  which are the most vicious and vice-begetting that can possibly be  invented. Many a young man and young woman has fallen to very low depths  from influences developed by these and similar means. Nurses should be  cautioned in this matter _and carefully watched too_, as even the"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/31674"],[0,"Comments on the Taxonomic Status of Apodemus peninsulae, with Description of a (#2)"],[1,"has 1-2=6 mammae although Allen reports finding a 2-2=8 formula in some  specimens. _Apodemus latronum_, regarded as a full species by Osgood  (1932:318) and G. M. Allen (1940:950) but as a subspecies of  _flavicollis_ by Ellerman (1949:32) and Ellerman and Morrison-Scott  (1951:567), also occurs in Szechuan and Yunnan. Its relatively dark  color, large feet and large ears, _flavicollis_-like skull and large  molar teeth immediately separate it from _peninsulae_ although the two  possibly have been confused in the earlier literature. Until a complete  revisionary study of the Asiatic members of the subgenus _Sylvaemus_ can  be undertaken the presence of _peninsulae_ in southwestern China must  remain in question.    The western limits of the geographic range of _Apodemus peninsulae_ are  unknown. _Apodemus gurkha_ Thomas, 1924, from Nepal is said to have  2-2=8 mammae but the description is not otherwise suggestive of close  relationship to _peninsulae_. Farther to the west, _Apodemus flavicollis  rusiges_ Miller, 1913, from Kashmir seems to have been properly assigned  as a subspecies of _flavicollis_ (cotypes and large series in USNM).    Wood mice almost certainly do not occur in the Gobi Desert. They are  known as far west as the Altai Mountains to the north of the Gobi and at  least as far west as Kansu (see below) to the south of it. Whether the  geographic range of the species skirts the western edge of the arid  regions of northern China is at present unknown; perhaps it does not. At  any rate, mice available to me from the North Chinese provinces of  Jehol, Shansi, Shensi and Kansu are notably different in certain  external and cranial features from other known races of _Apodemus  peninsulae_ and are here given subspecific recognition. All measurements  are in millimeters. Capitalized color terms are from Ridgway (1912).      Apodemus peninsulae sowerbyi, new subspecies         _Type._--Adult female molting from winter to summer pelage, skin       and skull, U. S. National Museum no. 175523, from 30 miles west of       Kuei-hua-cheng, 7000 ft., northern Shansi, China; obtained on 23       May 1912 by Arthur de Carle Sowerby, original no. 456.         _Distribution._--Known presently from eastern Kansu eastward       through Shensi, Shansi and Hopeh to southern Jehol, probably also       in northeastern Szechuan, exact limits of range unknown.         _Diagnosis._--Size small for species (see measurements). Color:       Upper parts (fresh summer pelage) averaging near (15'_a_)       Ochraceous-Buff, suffused with blackish (especially mid-dorsally);       winter pelage much paler; underparts grayish-white, individual       hairs plumbeous at base, tipped with white; ears pale brownish;       feet whitish above, darker below; tail bicolor, pale brownish       above, whitish below. Skull: Small (see measurements); rostrum       somewhat shortened and conspicuously down-curved; zygomatic notches       relatively shallow; zygomatic plates narrow; braincase       proportionally more inflated than in other subspecies of the       species; auditory bullae moderately inflated; upper incisors       slender, their faces averaging bright yellowish-orange.         _Measurements._--External measurements of the holotype, followed by       those of an adult male and female from the type locality, are,       respectively: Length of head and body, 101, 102, 100; length of       tail, 93, ----, 102; length of hind foot (_su_), 21, 21.5, 23;       length of ear from notch, 14, 16, 15.5. Corresponding measurements       for an adult female from 20 mi. E Taiyuan, Shansi, are: 91, 99, 23,       16. For cranial measurements see Table 1.

From _Apodemus peninsulae  praetor_ of Manchuria (holotype and paratypes), _A. p. sowerbyi_ differs  in most of the same ways in which it does from _peninsulae_ as well as  in having more shallow zygomatic notches, narrower zygomatic plates and  smaller, more slender, upper incisors. From _Apodemus peninsulae  nigritalus_ of the Altai Mountains of Siberia (holotype and paratypes),  _A. p. sowerbyi_ differs in: Smaller size, both external and cranial;  paler dorsal coloration; less convex cranial outline in lateral view;  smaller auditory bullae.    _Remarks._--_Apodemus peninsulae sowerbyi_ is named in honor of the late  Arthur de Carle Sowerby whose collections of mammals from North China  and Manchuria have added so much to our meager knowledge of that part of  the world.    Four specimens from Hsin-lung-shan, 65 mi. NE Peking, here assigned to  _sowerbyi_, are darker dorsally than mice from farther to the west and  in this respect may show approach to _A. p. praetor_. In all other  features, however, they closely resemble the new subspecies.    All of the specimens of _sowerbyi_ available to me are from altitudes of  3000 feet or higher. At lower elevations in North China, destruction of  wooded habitats owing to intense land-use practices has probably  restricted the distribution of _sowerbyi_ primarily to hilly and  mountainous areas where brushy, scrub and forest habitats still prevail.         _Specimens examined._--Thirty-three, all from North China, as       follows: JEHOL: Hsin-lung-shan, 65 mi. NE Peking, 3000 ft., 4.       KANSU: 15 mi. S Lanchow, 7400 ft., 1. SHANSI: Chiao-cheng-shan, 90       mi. W Taiyuan, 7000-8000 ft., 4; 30 mi. W Kuei-hau-cheng, 7000 ft.,       5; Lung-wang-shan, 20 mi. E Taiyuan, 4000 ft., 10; 18 mi. W       Taiyuan, 5000 ft., 1; 50 mi. NW Taiyuan, 5500 ft., 4. SHENSI: 12       mi. S Yenan, 4000 ft., 4.    _Apodemus peninsulae_, then, is known or suspected to occur over much of  southeastern Siberia, Manchuria, Korea and North China. The western  limits of its geographic range are unknown. Over this vast area only  four subspecies, one newly named, can be ascribed with certainty to  _peninsulae_ whereas only two other kinds, _giliacus_ of Thomas from  Sakhalin and _rufulus_ of Dukelsky from extreme southeastern Siberia are  probably conspecific with it, the latter possibly a synonym of  _praetor_. These considerations underscore the preliminary nature of the  present paper. The mammalian fauna of northeastern Asia is scarcely  better known today than was that of North America in 1885 when Dr. C.  Hart Merriam organized what was later to become the U. S. Biological  Survey.    It seems to me that the correct names of four kinds of wood mice  discussed above are as follows:    _Apodemus peninsulae peninsulae_ (Thomas, 1907)  _Apodemus peninsulae nigritalus_ Hollister, 1913  _Apodemus peninsulae praetor_ Miller, 1914  _Apodemus peninsulae sowerbyi_ Jones, 1956      LITERATURE CITED    ALLEN, G.
