The Earl of Derby, Secretary for the  Colonies, refused, however, to sanction the annexation of New  Guinea, and in so doing acted contrary to the sincere wish of every  right-thinking Anglo-Saxon under the Southern Cross.    \"While the subsequent correspondence between the Home and Queensland  governments was going on, Brigadier-General H. R. MacIver originated and  organized the New Guinea Exploration and Colonization Company in London,  with a view to establishing settlements on the island. The company,  presided over by General Beresford of the British Army, and having  an eminently representative and influential board of directors, had a  capital of two hundred and fifty thousand pounds, and placed the  supreme command of the expedition in the hands of General MacIver.  Notwithstanding the character of the gentlemen composing the board of  directors, and the truly peaceful nature of the expedition, his Lordship  informed General MacIver that in the event of the latter's attempting to  land on New Guinea, instructions would be sent to the officer in command  of her Majesty's fleet in the Western Pacific to fire upon the company's  vessel. This meant that the expedition would be dealt with as a  filibustering one.\"    In _Judy_, September 21, 1887, appears:    \"We all recollect the treatment received by Brigadier-General MacI. in  the action he took with respect to the annexation of New Guinea. The  General, who is a sort of Pizarro, with a dash of D'Artagnan, was  treated in a most scurvy manner by Lord Derby. Had MacIver not been  thwarted in his enterprise, the whole of New Guinea would now have been  under the British flag, and we should not be cheek-by-jowl with the  Germans, as we are in too many places.\"    _Society_, September 3, 1887, says:    \"The New Guinea expedition proved abortive, owing to the blundering  shortsightedness of the then Government, for which Lord Derby was  chiefly responsible, but what little foothold we possess in New Guinea,  is certainly due to General MacIver's gallant effort.\"    Copy of statement made by J. Rintoul Mitchell, June 2, 1887:    \"About the latter end of the year 1883, when I was editor-in-chief of  the _Englishman_ in Calcutta, I was told by Captain de Deaux, assistant  secretary in the Foreign Office of the Indian Government, that he  had received a telegram from Lord Derby to the effect that if General  MacIver ventured to land upon the coast of New Guinea it would become  the duty of Lord Ripon, Viceroy, to use the naval forces at his command  for the purpose of deporting General MacI. Sir Aucland Calvin can  certify to this, as it was discussed in the Viceregal Council.\"    Just after our Civil War MacIver was interested in another expedition  which also failed. Its members called themselves the Knights of Arabia,  and their object was to colonize an island much nearer to our shores  than New Guinea. MacIver, saying that his oath prevented, would never  tell me which island this was, but the reader can choose from  among Cuba, Haiti, and the Hawaiian group. To have taken Cuba, the  \"colonizers\" would have had to fight not only Spain, but the Cubans  themselves, on whose side they were soon fighting in the Ten Years' War;  so Cuba may be eliminated. And as the expedition was to sail from the  Atlantic side, and not from San Francisco, the island would appear to be  the Black Republic. From the records of the times it would seem that the  greater number of the Knights of Arabia were veterans of the Confederate  army, and there is no question but that they intended to subjugate the  blacks of Haiti and form a republic for white men in which slavery would  be recognized. As one of the leaders of this filibustering expedition,  MacIver was arrested by General Phil Sheridan and for a short time cast  into jail.    This chafed the general's spirit, but he argued philosophically that  imprisonment for filibustering, while irksome, brought with it  no reproach. And, indeed, sometimes the only difference between a  filibuster and a government lies in the fact that the government fights  the gun-boats of only the enemy while a filibuster must dodge the boats  of the enemy and those of his own countrymen. When the United States  went to war with Spain there were many men in jail as filibusters, for  doing that which at the time the country secretly approved, and later  imitated. And because they attempted exactly the same thing for which  Dr. Jameson was imprisoned in Holloway Jail, two hundred thousand of his  countrymen are now wearing medals.    The by-laws of the Knights of Arabia leave but little doubt as to its  object.    By-law No. II reads:    \"We, as Knights of Arabia, pledge ourselves to aid, comfort, and protect  all Knights of Arabia, especially those who are wounded in obtaining our  grand object.    \"III--Great care must be taken that no unbeliever or outsider shall gain  any insight into the mysteries or secrets of the Order.    \"IV--The candidate will have to pay one hundred dollars cash to  the Captain of the Company, and the candidate will receive from the  Secretary a Knight of Arabia bond for one hundred dollars in gold, with  ten per cent interest, payable ninety days after the recognition of (The  Republic of----) by the United States, or any government.    \"V--All Knights of Arabia will be entitled to one hundred acres of  land, location of said land to be drawn for by lottery. The products are  coffee, sugar, tobacco, and cotton.\"    A local correspondent of the New York _Herald_ writes of the arrest of  MacIver as follows:    \"When MacIver will be tried is at present unknown, as his case has  assumed a complicated aspect. He claims British protection as a subject  of her British Majesty, and the English Consul has forwarded a statement  of his case to Sir Frederick Bruce at Washington, accompanied by a copy  of the by-laws. General Sheridan also has forwarded a statement to  the Secretary of War, accompanied not only by the by-laws, but very  important documents, including letters from Jefferson Davis, Benjamin,  the Secretary of State of the Confederate States, and other personages  prominent in the Rebellion, showing that MacIver enjoyed the highest  confidence of the Confederacy.\"    As to the last statement, an open letter I found in his scrap-book is an  excellent proof. It is as follows: \"To officers and members of all camps  of United Confederate Veterans: It affords me the greatest pleasure to  say that the bearer of this letter, General Henry Ronald MacIver, was an  officer of great gallantry in the Confederate Army, serving on the staff  at various times of General Stonewall Jackson, J. E. B. Stuart, and E.  Kirby Smith, and that his official record is one of which any man may be  proud.    \"Respectfully, MARCUS J. WRIGHT, \"_Agent for the Collection of  Confederate Records_.    \"War Records office, War Department, Washington, July 8, 1895.\"    At the close of the war duels between officers of the two armies were  not infrequent. In the scrap-book there is the account of one of these  affairs sent from Vicksburg to a Northern paper by a correspondent who  was an eye-witness of the event. It tells how Major MacIver, accompanied  by Major Gillespie, met, just outside of Vicksburg, Captain Tomlin of  Vermont, of the United States Artillery Volunteers. The duel was with  swords. MacIver ran Tomlin through the body. The correspondent writes:    \"The Confederate officer wiped his sword on his handkerchief. In a few  seconds Captain Tomlin expired. One of Major MacIver's seconds called to  him: 'He is dead; you must go. These gentlemen will look after the body  of their friend.' A negro boy brought up the horses, but before mounting  MacIver said to Captain Tomlin's seconds: 'My friends are in haste for  me to go. Is there anything I can do? I hope you consider that this  matter has been settled honorably?'    \"There being no reply, the Confederates rode away.\"    In a newspaper of to-day so matter-of-fact an acceptance of an event so  tragic would make strange reading.    From the South MacIver crossed through Texas to join the Royalist army  under the Emperor Maximilian. It was while making his way, with other  Confederate officers, from Galveston to El Paso, that MacIver was  captured by the Indians. He was not ill-treated by them, but for three  months was a prisoner, until one night, the Indians having camped near  the Rio Grande, he escaped into Mexico. There he offered his sword to  the Royalist commander, General Mejia, who placed him on his staff, and  showed him some few skirmishes. At Monterey MacIver saw big fighting,  and for his share in it received the title of Count, and the order of  Guadaloupe. In June, contrary to all rules of civilized war, Maximilian  was executed and the empire was at an end. MacIver escaped to the coast,  and from Tampico took a sailing vessel to Rio de Janeiro. Two months  later he was wearing the uniform of another emperor, Dom Pedro, and,  with the rank of lieutenant-colonel, was in command of the Foreign  Legion of the armies of Brazil and Argentina, which at that time as  allies were fighting against Paraguay.    MacIver soon recruited seven hundred men, but only half of these ever  reached the front. In Buenos Ayres cholera broke out and thirty thousand  people died, among the number about half the Legion. MacIver was among  those who suffered, and before he recovered was six weeks in hospital.  During that period, under a junior officer, the Foreign Legion was sent  to the front, where it was disbanded.    On his return to Glasgow, MacIver foregathered with an old friend,  Bennett Burleigh, whom he had known when Burleigh was a lieutenant  in the navy of the Confederate States. Although today known as a  distinguished war correspondent, in those days Burleigh was something of  a soldier of fortune himself, and was"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/30293"],[0,"The Candy Maker's Guide (#2)"],[1,"\"    4 50    1 Candy Thermometer              \"    1 75    1 Marble Slab 48x24x2            \"    8 00    1 Caramel Cutter                 \"    6 50    1 Candy Hook                     \"      75    1 Pallette Knife                 \"      50    1 Doz.

These machines are made to suit all classes of trade, big and  little. The small ones make just as nice drops as the large ones, and  will turn out in the course of a day 2 or 3 cwt., by constant use, so  that for retail purposes this quantity would generally be sufficient.

Sugar boiling is dirty sticky business, especially on wet days,  unless every part is kept scrupulously clean and dry, slabs and tables  should be washed, no trace of sifting, scraps, or boiled goods, should  be left exposed to the atmosphere during the night, the floor well  swept, and a little clean sawdust put down every night.    The comfort and ease in working in a clean place far more than offsets  the trouble and time it takes to put it in order, besides the goods are  much drier, brighter and easier to bottle or pack. Nothing is more  unpleasant than to work with sticky slabs, slimy machines or dirty  scales. The boil adheres to the slabs, sticks to the rollers, spoiling  the shapes, and become cloudy and spotty in weighing. We are not writing  without knowledge. Any one who has worked or visited small workshops can  endorse the value of these remarks, and call to mind this imaginary  picture. However, there are exceptions, still the hint will be useful in  a good many cases.    [Illustration: Fig. 5.    Steel Candy Shears.    English Candy Shears, $1.50.]    [Illustration: Fig. 201 a. Price, $1.75    Copper Cased Candy Thermometer.]      METHOD OF SUGAR BOILING.    If the learner will study the following instructions, the author  guarantees to place him in a position to boil sugar as correctly as the  most experienced workman. To accomplish this, the reader should provide  himself with the sugar boiler's tools named on the preceding page.  While the sugar is undergoing the process of boiling, it is almost  impossible for a learner to determine the exact degree which the sugar  has attained without a thermometer, and even the journeyman finds it so  useful that you will find very few indeed who boil sugar without it; in  fact many of the larger shops will not allow a sugar boiler to work  without one. For almost any purpose the following degrees will be found  all that is necessary. For instance put into the pan in which you intend  to boil, 7 lbs. granulated sugar together with one quart of water,  placing it on the fire and allow it to boil. Put a cover over the pan  and allow it to boil for ten minutes; then take off the cover and put  the thermometer in the pan, immersing the bottom part of it in the  boiling sugar, and let it remain there until the sugar is boiled to the  degree you require. The following five degrees are those used by  confectioners for different purposes:    [Illustration: Fig. 87.    IRON BELL SHAPED MORTAR.    English Make, Extra Heavy, Tinned inside.      1    Pint       $1 00    1-1/2 \"          1 50    1    Quart       2 00    2     \"          3 00  ]    1st. The smooth, viz.,--215 to 220 by the thermometer. When the mercury  registers these figures the sugars may then be used for crystalizing  creams, gum goods and liqueurs.    2nd. The Thread, viz., 230 and 235 is the degree which is used for  making liqueurs.    3rd. The Feather, viz., 240 to 245. Only a few minutes elapse between  these degrees, and the sugar must be watched closely during the boiling  at this point. This degree may be used for making fondants, rich creams,  cream for chocolates and fruit candying.    4th. The Ball, viz., 250 to 255. The sugar at this point is used for  making cocoanut and other candies, cocoanut ice, and almost every  description of grain sugar generally.    5th. The Crack, viz., 310 to 315. This is the degree which is used, with  little variation, for all kinds of drops, taffies, and all clear goods,  whether for the purpose of passing through machines or manipulating with  the hands.    These degrees can be tested by an experienced hand without the aid of  the thermometer, and the learner may accustom himself by trying them in  the following manner: Take the stem of a clay pipe and dip it into the  sugar as it boils, draw it out again and pass it through the forefinger  and thumb; when it feels oily you will find by looking at your  thermometer that it has reached the degree of smooth, 215 to 220 by the  glass.    The next degree or thread, may be tried by your taking a little of the  sugar off the pipe between your finger and thumb and part them gently;  if you see small threads hang between your finger and thumb that degree  has arrived.    For the degree of Ball, 250 to 255, you must have by your hand a small  jug of cold water; when you draw the pipe out of the sugar dip it in the  water, and when taken out of the water, if you can work it like a piece  of putty, you have got the degree of ball.    The degree of Crack must be tested the same way, and the sugar must  leave the pipe clean; dip it again into cold water; when off the pipe  break off a piece with your teeth; if it snaps clean in your teeth, pour  your sugar on the slab at once.    NOTE.--This last degree must be tried sharply, in giving the process for  trying it without the thermometer. We caution all beginners to get a  thermometer, as practice alone can instruct you without. It is also  necessary to state that thermometers differ a little, and should be  tested.    During hot weather, it is necessary to bring the sugars up to the full  degree; during winter months, the lower degrees marked will answer the  purpose.      CUTTING THE GRAIN, LOWERING OR GREASING.    Almost all sugar, especially refined, whether loaf, crystalized or  granulated, and most sugars known to the trade as pieces will, if boiled  beyond the degree of ball, or 250 by the thermometer, when turned out of  the pan becomes cloudy, then grainy, and ultimately a solid lump of  hard opaque sugar. To prevent this candying, as it is called several  agents are used, such as glucose, cream of tartar pyroligneous acid,  vinegar &c., the action of which will cause the sugar to boil clear, be  pliable while hot and transparent when cold. It is therefore necessary  to use some lowering agent for all boilings intended for clear goods,  such as drops, taffies, rocks &c.    [Illustration: Fig. 29.    Pyramid Forms.      No. 1, 22-1/2 inch, 2 rings      Price,    90c.    No. 2, 32 inch, 3 rings      Price,  $1 10.  ]    [Illustration: Fig. 21.    CANDY SCRAPER AND SPREADER.      12 inches long      65c     6   \"      \"       30c  ]    Experience has taught most of the old hands that two of these agents  possess all the merits necessary for the purpose, and are to be  preferred to others for reasons it is unnecessary to state--they are  cream of tartar and glucose. A great deal could be said in favor of  either or both; cream of tartar is handier and cleaner to use as well as  more exact in its action; goods boiled with it will be a better color  and, some assert, more crisp; for acids and all best and export goods it  is to be recommended--use a proportion of half an ounce to every 14 lbs.  of sugar--we say about, as some strong sugars require a little more,  this is generally measured in a teaspoon, two spoonfuls to every 14 lbs.  of sugar.    _Glucose_, being cheaper than sugar, is valuable to the confectioner,  not only for its lowering qualities, but also as a bulk producer,  _reducing the cost of the product_. On this account there is a tendency  to overdo it by using too much, the result causing goods to become  sticky and turn soft immediately they are exposed to the atmosphere, not  only so, but we have seen drops running to a solid lump in bottles  through being overdosed. If glucose is used in proper proportions, it  makes an excellent lowering agent, and will answer the purpose first  rate for ordinary drops and the like. Use three lbs. of glucose to every  14 lbs. of sugar; keep a panful on the furnace top, so that it will  always be hot and may be easily measured by means of a saucepan or ladle  holding the exact quantity; add the glucose when sugar begins to boil.      FLAVORS AND COLORS.    These form almost as important a part of the trade as the sugar itself,  and it should be the chief object of every workman to try and excel in  these two important features; if you do not use _good flavors_, it is a  moral certainty you cannot produce _good candies_. Flavors for boiled  sugars should be specially prepared, those bought at an ordinary  _chemist shop may do very well for flavoring custards and pastry, but  are of no use for boiled"]]]
