Many minds are so opposed to the Bible that  they _are_ inclined to oppose any government based upon its contents. This  is a fearful current, and we should always watch against being carried  away upon its turbid waters. Ours is a Christian land, and we shall be a  free people as long as we remain a Christian people. While the Bible is  loved and honored our freedom will continue; beyond this there is nothing  to hinder us from _degenerating into slavery_. All great struggles in  Christian lands have been great _moral_ and political struggles.            LIBERTY OF CONSCIENCE.      This phase of the question rises very high in our estimation; for we have  been taught to regard the rights of conscience and to esteem them above  all other rights in a free country. There can be no civil liberty where  the rights of conscience are ignored. The teachings of the Bible are  opposed to all interference by law with man's religious faith and worship.  Religious liberty asks for no laws meddling with the rights of conscience.  Such laws, whether of tolerance or of intolerance, are always in conflict  with the spirit of the religion of Christ; for it asks for the soul's  free, voluntary service. As American citizens we ask, at the hands of our  Government, to be protected, in common with all other citizens, in the  free exercise of the rights of conscience. We ask no interference with  religion by law, and we apprehend none in our country. If our religion  cannot take care of itself, by the force of its own merits, it must  perish.    Rivers of blood have been offered upon the altar of a blind intolerance.  Look at Antiochus sacking the city of Jerusalem and laying the country  waste. Look at the slaughter of the infants of Bethlehem under Herod's  jurisdiction. In many ages of the world religious intolerance has been the  fruitful source of misery and bloodshed.    The religion of the Bible does not rest itself upon the authority of man;  much less is it responsible for the cruel results of wicked efforts to  establish or overthrow it by law. Causes outside of Christianity in the  hands of wicked men are responsible for every drop of blood that has been  shed in the name of our holy religion. Christianity has nothing to fear in  our country as long as our law-makers remember that their whole duty  consists, not in making or unmaking rights or religion, but in making laws  protecting all in the enjoyment of their rights. The principles of  religious liberty set forth in the Bible are the following: First, the  word of God is the only source of authority in religious matters. Neither  tradition, nor remote antiquity, nor ecclesiastical decisions, nor  statutes, but the Bible is supreme in our religion. Second, the Bible  allows, and demands, the right of private judgment in all matters of faith  and duty. This is based upon the well-defined principles of individual and  personal responsibility. \"Let every man prove his own work.\"    The true and intelligent Christian has always been opposed to  ecclesiastical establishments by law, and the authority of the state to  produce unity of faith and worship. In all such matters we are responsible  to God alone. His authority is all that is needed in order to the soul's  own free service; and this is the only acceptable worship. The third great  principle of religious liberty is this: the Bible contains the only  infallible standard of faith and worship, and its author is the only  infallible judge. The Bible gives to no man, or set of men, dominion over  the human conscience, but on the contrary lays the solemn injunction upon  each individual: \"Prove all things and hold fast that which is good.\" The  direction of Christ is in these living lines: \"Call no man master, for one  is your master, even Christ.\" Every man's own works are the only true  expositor of his character, because they are the fruits of the affections  which point him out as an enemy, or as a friend, of righteousness.    The man who abuses the right of private judgment has a fearful account to  render--let him see to that. If he receives not the truth in the love of it  that he may be saved, it is at his own peril. The field of investigation  is the place where Christianity has won her most splendid victories. She  has always lost when wicked men have called in the aid of the secular arm;  for it is a very great error to suppose that you can deal successfully  with a man's spiritual nature by such forces; it was not made for such  government. By the secular arm you may force a wicked man to be a  hypocrite, but you cannot make him a Christian in that way; for you cannot  reach his understanding, nor give life to his conscience by any such  means.    There are two extremes, however, which we must carefully avoid: First,  that it is a matter of total indifference what religious principles a man  adopts and what form of worship he prefers. The Bible contains essential  principles--principles which constitute the essence of the gospel of Christ  which must be received, loved and obeyed, in order to the enjoyment of the  promises of salvation. The sentiment that it matters not what a man  believes, is no part of the religious liberty which the Bible inculcates.  Such a sentiment is everywhere discouraged and denounced. A forcible  writer said: Keep clear of uncommon pretensions to charity. Believe the  love of God, and be satisfied with his charity, and never dream of making  an improvement upon his character.    The other extreme is to have no charity at all. There are many things  about which men may safely differ, but they are neither precepts to be  obeyed, nor facts to be believed. Differences may exist in opinions, but  not in facts to be believed, nor in commands to be obeyed. Christians are  such in virtue of faith in Christ and obedience to his commandments.  Wherever the minds of men have been brought under the power of the  Christian religion, there they have been the devoted friends of such  liberty. Such were the adherents of Luther in Germany, the Lollards in  England, and the adherents of Knox in Scotland. Such was the case with  Holland when her republican virtues, learning and piety, moral and  literary institutions made her famous throughout the earth. \"Where the  spirit of the Lord is there is liberty.\" One of the most erroneous  objections to Christianity is that it is calculated to subject the many to  the few, but its spirit and tendency is to bring all, both the rich and  poor, on one common level. It pronounces temporal circumstances matters of  no consequence, all men creatures of God, made of one blood, having a  common nature, subject to common sufferings, common dependence and  responsibilities. It teaches us to \"defraud no man,\" to \"corrupt no man,\"  to \"love our enemies,\" to \"pray for those who despitefully use us,\" to  \"disregard external distinctions.\" In Christ there is neither Jew nor  Greek, bond nor free, male nor female, but all are one. The poor are  exalted and the rich are humbled. Tholuck says: \"The cultivated heathen  were offended at Christianity because the higher classes could no longer  have precedence of the common people.\" A religion which teaches that all  are upon one grand level under its influences will certainly teach us that  all are equal in the presence of the law. Christianity is not only a  stranger to despotism, but denounces it in the plainest terms. Its great  founder said: \"Whosoever will be great among you let him be your servant,  and whosoever will be chief let him be your minister.\" What greater  calamity could we experience than the loss of the last copy of the New  Testament? Who would bring over the world once more the darkness of  Paganism? Who would have our Government put on Roman character? Who would  have us foster the basest passions of men? Who would throw the human  intellect back into a state of uncertainty respecting a future existence  and the manner of securing its blessedness? Who would dry up the living  fountains of joy which have been opened to us in the gospel? Who would  destroy the motive power of our religion and wither its fruits of  righteousness? Who would rob the bereaved heart of its consolations and  provoke anew the tears of the mourner which have been wiped away? Who  would go to the widow and say: Go and visit the grave of your loved one  and weep without hope! Yes, weep with the terrible thought that this  parting is to last forever! Weep with trembling, and at last step into the  grave with awful uncertainty, to learn all there, and never bring back the  secret. Who are they who would restore to death its sting and to the grave  its victory? What victories have they ever achieved for our humanity? No  calculations could measure the sacrifice it would cost to part with the  Bible forever. Wicked men would toll its funeral, while the innocent ones  of earth would bathe in tears and turn away in sorrow. Let us never  persecute those unfortunate men who are opposing the truth of our religion  on account of the errors of the creeds of our fathers. Let us always avoid  a spirit of despotism and persecution, because it is dishonorable. If  there must be persecution, let truth be the victim. Error is not worthy of  the honor that martyrs bear.    It is better that we \"suffer for well-doing than for ill-doing,\" therefore  let us criticise ourselves severely, but deal with others in love. The  Bible is our authority in religion, and the civil arm is our protection in  the state. Religious freedom is ours--may it long remain the glory of our  country. In comparison with this freedom all else is mere illusion. You  may enjoy all the freedom that this world can give, and if you are slaves  to sin you are miserable slaves to a cruel master.
