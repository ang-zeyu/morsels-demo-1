"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/28257"],[0,"The Story of the Great War, Volume 1 (#2)"],[1,"which  the world does not so fully recognize, planning to capture the  commerce of the warring nations, and expecting at the same time to  retain their friendship and regard. Let us hope that, in the light  of what is, and as a preparation against what may be, the answer  will be characteristic of a great people, peaceful but prudent and  foreseeing; that it will be thorough, carefully thought-out  preparedness; preparedness against war. A preparedness which if it  is to be lasting and secure must be founded upon the moral  organization of our people; an organization which will create and  keep alive in the heart of every citizen a sense not only of  obligation for service to the nation in time of war or trouble, but  also of obligation to so prepare himself as to render this service  effective. An organization which will recognize that the basic  principle upon which a free democracy or representative government  rests, and must rest, if they are to survive the day of stress and  trouble, is, that with manhood suffrage goes manhood obligation for  service, not necessarily with arms in hand, but for service  somewhere in that great complex mass which constitutes the  organization of a nation's might and resources for defense;  organization which will make us think in terms of the nation and not  those of city, State, or personal interest; organization which will  result in all performing service for the nation with singleness of  purpose in a common cause--preparedness for defense: preparedness to  discharge our plain duty whatever it may be. Such service will make  for national solidarity, the doing away with petty distinctions of  class and creed, and fuse the various elements of this people into  one homogeneous mass of real Americans, and leave us a better and a  stronger people.    Once such a moral organization is accomplished, the remaining  organization will be simple. This will include an organization of  transportation, on land and sea, and of communications. An  organization of the nation's industrial resources so that the energy  of its great manufacturing plants may be promptly turned into making  what they can best make to supply the military needs of the nation.  By military needs we mean all the complex requirements of a nation  engaged in war, requirements which are, many of them, requirements  of peace as well as of war. It will also include a thorough  organization of the country's chemical resources and the development  thereof, so that we may be as little dependent as possible upon  materials from oversea. At present many important and essential  elements come from oversea nations and would not be available in  case of loss of sea control. We must devise substitutes or find  means of making these things. Chemistry is one of the great weapons  of modern war. There must also be organization which will provide a  regular army organized on sound lines, supplied with ample reserves  of men and material; an army adequate to the peace needs of the  nation, which means, among other things, the secure garrisoning of  our oversea possessions, including the Philippines and the Hawaiian  Islands. These latter are the key to the Pacific, and one of the  main defenses of the Pacific Coast and of the Panama Canal. Whoever  holds these islands will dominate the trade routes of the Pacific,  and in a large measure the Pacific itself.    The regular army should also be sufficient for the secure holding  and safeguarding of the Panama Canal, an instrument of war of the  greatest importance, so long as it is in our control, greatly  increasing the value of our navy, and an implement of commerce of  tremendous value, a possession so valuable and of such vital  importance to us that we cannot allow it to lie outside our secure  grasp.    It must also be adequate to provide garrisons in Porto Rico and  Alaska, and at the same time maintain in the continental United  States a force of coast artillery sufficient to furnish the  necessary manning details for our seacoast defenses, and a mobile  force complete in every detail and adequate in time of war to meet  the first shock of an invasion and sufficient in time of peace to  meet the various demands made upon it for home service, such as  troops for home emergencies or disorders, troops for the necessary  training of the National Militia, also sufficient officers and  noncommissioned officers for duty at schools, colleges, military  training camps and in various other capacities. It must be also  strong enough to provide a strong expeditionary force, such as we  sent to Cuba in 1898, without interfering with its regular duties.    The necessity of building and maintaining an adequate navy, well  balanced, thoroughly equipped and maintained at the highest standard  of efficiency and ready always for immediate service, with necessary  adjuncts afloat and ashore, is also one of the clear lessons of the  war; others are the establishment of ammunition plants at points  sufficiently remote from the seacoast, and so placed as to render  their capture and destruction improbable in case of sudden invasion;  the provision of an adequate reserve corps of 50,000 officers, a  number sufficient for one and one-half million of citizen soldiers;  officers well trained and ready for immediate service; the provision  of adequate supplies and reserve supplies of artillery, arms, and  ammunition of all types for these troops.    We must also build up a system under which officers and men for our  citizen soldiery can be trained with the minimum of interference  with their educational or industrial careers, under conditions which  will permit the accomplishment of their training during the period  of youth, and once this is accomplished will permit their return to  their normal occupations with the minimum of delay.    The lesson which we should draw from the Great War is that nothing  should be left to chance or to the promise of others, or to the  fair-weather relations of to-day; that we should be as well  prepared, and as well organized on land as Switzerland, a nation  without a trace of militarism, and yet so thoroughly prepared and so  thoroughly ready and able to defend herself that to-day her  territory is inviolate, although she is surrounded by warring  nations.    Belgium to-day is an illustration of what may be expected from lack  of adequate preparedness.    The great outstanding lesson of the war is that we must not trust to  righteousness and fair dealing alone; we must be prepared to play  our part, and while loving justice and dealing fairly with others,  we must be always ready to do our full duty, and to defend our  country with force if need be. If we do not, we shall always be  helpless and at the mercy of our enemies. We can be strong, yet  tolerant, just, yet prepared to defend ourselves against aggression.    Another lesson is that our military establishment on land and sea  should not be dependent upon a system of militia and volunteers.  These will not be found adequate under the conditions of modern  war, and above all we should appreciate the fact that our military  system must be founded upon _equality of service, rich and poor  alike_. We must while extending equality of privilege to all,  including the thousands who are coming to us every day, insist upon  equality of obligation by all. With the privileges of citizenship  must go the obligations and responsibilities not only in peace but  also in war.    We should take heed of the lessons of the past, and remember that  the volunteer system has always failed us in our wars. Such  experience as we have had in war in recent years has in no way  prepared us for a war with a first-class nation prepared for war. We  have never engaged in such a war unaided. This experience is one  which is still before us. We should look upon service for the nation  in the same way as we look upon the payment of taxes, or the  compliance with the thousand and one laws and regulations which  govern our everyday life.    Relatively few people would voluntarily pay taxes even though they  knew the money was to go to the best of purposes. They pay taxes  because the law requires it. The people as a whole cannot be  expected, nor can we with safety trust to their performing their  military duties effectively, unless some general system of equal  service for all who are physically fit, is prescribed, some system  which will insure preparation in advance of war, some system which  will _bear upon all alike_. The volunteer spirit is superb, but the  volunteer system is not a dependable system to which to trust the  life and security of the people, especially in these days when the  highest degree of organization marks all nations with whom we may  possibly have some day differences which will result in the use of  force. The militia, willing as it is, cannot be depended upon as a  reliable military asset. Its very method of control makes it an  undependable force, and at times unavailable. The men and officers  are not at fault; they have done all that could be expected under a  system which renders efficiency almost impossible of attainment. The  militia must be absolutely and completely transferred to Federal  control; it must cease to be a State and become a Federal force,  without any relationship whatever with the State.    The militia must have thoroughly trained reserves sufficient in  number to bring it promptly to war strength. The infantry of the  National Guard, as in the regular army, is maintained on a peace  footing at rather less than half its maximum strength.    For a number of years we have been confronted by conditions which  may involve the use of a considerable force of troops, a force  exceeding the regular army and perhaps even the regular army in  conjunction with the militia. This means that a thousand or more men  would have to be added to each regular and National Guard infantry  regiment to bring"]]]
