But when we would  enter into the recesses of that mind--when we would discriminate upon  its construction, and reason upon its operations--when we would tell how  it was composed, and why it excelled--we are entirely at fault. The  processes of Washington's understanding are entirely hidden from us.  What came from it, in counsel or in action, was the life and glory of  his country; what went on within it, is shrouded in impenetrable  concealment. Such elevation in degree of wisdom, amounts almost to a  change of kind, in nature, and detaches his intelligence from the  sympathy of ours. We cannot see him as he was, because we are not like  him. The tones of the mighty bell were heard with the certainty of Time  itself, and with a force that vibrates still upon the air of life, and  will vibrate for ever. But the clock-work, by which they were regulated  and given forth, we can neither see nor understand. In fact, his  intellectual abilities did not exist in an analytical and separated  form; but in a combined and concrete state. They \"moved altogether when  they moved at all.\" They were in no degree speculative, but only  practical. They could not act at all in the region of imagination, but  only upon the field of reality. The sympathies of his intelligence dwelt  exclusively in the national being and action. Its interests and energies  were absorbed in them. He was nothing out of that sphere, because he was  every thing there. The extent to which he was identified with the  country is unexampled in the relations of individual men to the  community. During the whole period of his life he was the thinking part  of the nation. He was its mind; it was his image and illustration. If we  would classify and measure him, it must be with nations and not with  individuals.    This extraordinary nature of Washington's capacities--this impossibility  of analyzing and understanding the elements and methods of his  wisdom--have led some persons to doubt whether, intellectually, he was  of great superiority; but the public--the community--never doubted of  the transcendent eminence of Washington's abilities. From the first  moment of his appearance as the chief, the recognition of him, from one  end of the country to the other, as THE MAN--the leader, the counsellor,  the infallible in suggestion and in conduct--was immediate and  universal. From that moment to the close of the scene, the national  confidence in his capacity was as spontaneous, as enthusiastic, as  immovable, as it was in his integrity. Particular persons, affected by  the untoward course of events, sometimes questioned his sufficiency; but  the nation never questioned it, nor would allow it to be questioned.  Neither misfortune, nor disappointment, nor accidents, nor delay, nor  the protracted gloom of years, could avail to disturb the public trust  in him. It was apart from circumstances; it was beside the action of  caprice; it was beyond all visionary, and above all changeable feelings.  It was founded on nothing extraneous; not upon what he had said or done,  but upon what he was. They saw something in the man, which gave them  assurance of a nature and destiny of the highest elevation--something  inexplicable, but which inspired a complete satisfaction. We feel that  this reliance was wise and right; but why it was felt, or why it was  right, we are as much to seek as those who came under the direct  impression of his personal presence. It is not surprising, that the  world, recognizing in this man a nature and a greatness which philosophy  cannot explain, should revere him almost to religion.    The distance and magnitude of those objects which are too far above us  to be estimated directly--such as stars--are determined by their  parallax. By some process of that kind we may form an approximate notion  of Washington's greatness. We may measure him against the great events  in which he moved; and against the great men, among whom, and above  whom, his figure stood like a tower. It is agreed that the war of  American Independence is one of the most exalted, and honorable, and  difficult achievements related in history. Its force was contributed by  many; but its grandeur was derived from Washington. His character and  wisdom gave unity, and dignity, and effect to the irregular, and often  divergent enthusiasm of others. His energy combined the parts; his  intelligence guided the whole: his perseverance, and fortitude, and  resolution, were the inspiration and support of all. In looking back  over that period, his presence seems to fill the whole scene; his  influence predominates throughout; his character is reflected from every  thing. Perhaps nothing less than his immense weight of mind could have  kept the national system, at home, in that position which it held,  immovably, for seven years; perhaps nothing but the august  respectability which his demeanor threw around the American cause  abroad, would have induced a foreign nation to enter into an equal  alliance with us, upon terms that contributed in a most important degree  to our final success, or would have caused Great Britain to feel that no  great indignity was suffered in admitting the claim to national  existence of a people who had such a representative as Washington. What  but the most eminent qualities of mind and feeling--discretion  superhuman--readiness of invention, and dexterity of means, equal to the  most desperate affairs--endurance, self-control, regulated ardor,  restrained passion, caution mingled with boldness, and all the  contrarieties of moral excellence--could have expanded the life of an  individual into a career such as this?    If we compare him with the great men who were his contemporaries  throughout the nation; in an age of extraordinary personages, Washington  was unquestionably the first man of the time in ability. Review the  correspondence of General Washington--that sublime monument of  intelligence and integrity--scrutinize the public history and the public  men of that era, and you will find that in all the wisdom that was  accomplished was attempted, Washington was before every man in his  suggestions of the plan, and beyond every one in the extent to which he  contributed to its adoption. In the field, all the able generals  acknowledged his superiority, and looked up to him with loyalty,  reliance, and reverence; the others, who doubted his ability, or  conspired against his sovereignty, illustrated, in their own conduct,  their incapacity to be either his judges or his rivals. In the state,  Adams, Jay, Rutledge, Pinckney, Morris--these are great names; but there  is not one whose wisdom does not vail to his. His superiority was felt  by all these persons, and was felt by Washington himself, as a simple  matter of fact, as little a subject of question, or a cause of vanity,  as the eminence of his personal stature. His appointment as  commander-in-chief, was the result of no design on his part, and of no  efforts on the part of his friends; it seemed to take place  spontaneously. He moved into the position, because there was a vacuum  which no other could supply: in it, he was not sustained by government,  by a party, nor by connections; he sustained himself, and then he  sustained every thing else. He sustained Congress against the army, and  the army against the injustice of Congress. The brightest mind among his  contemporaries was Hamilton's; a character which cannot be contemplated  without frequent admiration, and constant affection. His talents took  the form of genius, which Washington's did not. But active, various, and  brilliant, as the faculties of Hamilton were, whether viewed in the  precocity of youth, or in the all-accomplished elegance of maturer  life--lightning quick as his intelligence was to see through every  subject that came before it, and vigorous as it was in constructing the  argumentation by which other minds were to be led, as upon a shapely  bridge, over the obscure depths across which his had flashed in a  moment--fertile and sound in schemes, ready in action, splendid in  display, as he was--nothing is more obvious and certain than that when  Mr. Hamilton approached Washington, he came into the presence of one who  surpassed him in the extent, in the comprehension, the elevation, the  sagacity, the force, and the ponderousness of his mind, as much as he  did in the majesty of his aspect, and the grandeur of his step. The  genius of Hamilton was a flower, which gratifies, surprises, and  enchants; the intelligence of Washington was a stately tree, which in  the rarity and true dignity of its beauty is as superior, as it is in  its dimensions.

On this epoch-making day the German army  began its invasion of Belgium--with the conquest of France as its  ultimate goal. Six mighty armies stood ready for the great invasion.  Their estimated total was 1,200,000 men. Supreme over all was the  Emperor as War Lord, but Lieutenant General Helmuth von Moltke, chief of  the General Staff, was the practical director of military operations.  General von Moltke was a nephew of the great strategist of 1870, and his  name possibly appealed as of happy augury for repeating the former  capture of Paris.    The First Army was assembled at Aix-la-Chapelle in the north of Belgium,  within a few miles of the Dutch frontier. It was under the command of  General von Kluck. He was a veteran of both the Austrian and  Franco-Prussian Wars, and was regarded as an able infantry leader. His  part was to enter Belgium at its northern triangle, which projects  between Holland and Germany, occupy Liege, deploy on the great central  plains of Belgium, then sweep toward the French northwestern frontier in  the German dash for Paris and the English Channel. His army thus formed  the right wing of the whole German offensive. It was composed of picked  corps, including cavalry of the Prussian Guard.    The Second Army had gathered in the neighborhood of Limbourg under the  command of General von Buelow. Its advance was planned down the valleys  of the Ourthe and Vesdre to a junction with Von Kluck at Liege, then a  march by the Meuse Valley upon Namur and Charleroi. In crossing the  Sambre it was to fall into place on the left of Von Kluck's army.    The German center was composed of the Third Army under Duke Albrecht of  Wuerttemberg, the Fourth Army led by the crown prince, and the Fifth Army  commanded by the Crown Prince of Bavaria. It was assembled on the line  Neufchateau-Treves-Metz. Its first offensive was the occupation of  Luxemburg. This was performed, after a somewhat dramatic protest by the  youthful Grand Duchess, who placed her motor car across the bridge by  which the Germans entered her internationally guaranteed independent  state. The German pretext was that since Luxemburg railways were German  controlled, they were required for the transport of troops. Preparations  were then made for a rapid advance through the Ardennes upon the Central  Meuse, to form in order upon the left of Von Buelow's army. A part of the  Fifth Army was to be detached for operations against the French fortress  of Verdun.    The Sixth Army was concentrated at Strassburg in Alsace, under General  von Heeringen. As inspector of the Prussian Guards he bore a very high  military reputation. For the time being General von Heeringen's part was  to remain in Alsace, to deal with a possibly looked for strong French  offensive by way of the Vosges or Belfort.    The main plan of the German General Staff, therefore was a wide  enveloping movement by the First and Second Armies to sweep the shore of  the English Channel in their march on Paris, a vigorous advance of the  center through the Ardennes for the same destination, and readiness for  battle by the Sixth Army for any French force which might be tempted  into Alsace. That this plan was not developed in its entirety, was due  to circumstances which fall into another place.    [Illustration: Pictorial Map of France.]    The long anticipated _Day_ dawned. Their vast military machine moved  with precision and unity. But there was a surprise awaiting them. The  Belgians were to offer a serious resistance to passage through their  territory--a firm refusal had been delivered at the eleventh hour. The  vanguard was thrown forward from Von Kluck's army at Aix, to break  through the defenses of Liege and seize the western railways. This force  of three divisions was commanded by General von Emmich, one of them  joining him at Verviers.    On the evening of August 3, 1914, Von Emmich's force had crossed into  Belgium. Early on the morning of August 4, 1914, Von Kluck's second  advance line reached Vise, situated on the Meuse north of Liege and  close to the Dutch frontier. Here an engagement took place with a  Belgian guard, which terminated with the Germans bombarding Vise. The  Belgians had destroyed the river bridge, but the Germans succeeded in  seizing the crossing.    This was the first actual hostility of the war on the western battle  grounds. With the capture of Vise, the way was clear for Von Kluck's  main army to concentrate on Belgian territory. By nightfall, Liege was  invested on three sides. Only the railway lines and roads running  westward remained open.          CHAPTER II    SIEGE AND CAPTURE OF LIEGE      A view of Liege will assist in revealing its three days' siege, with the  resulting effect upon the western theatre of war. Liege is the capital  of the Walloons, a sturdy race that in times past has at many a crisis  proved unyielding determination and courage. At the outbreak of war it  was the center of great coal mining and industrial activity. In the  commercial world it is known everywhere for the manufacture of firearms.  The smoke from hundreds of factories spreads over the city, often  hanging in dense clouds. It might aptly be termed the Pittsburg of  Belgium. The city lies in a deep, broad cut of the River Meuse, at its  junction with the combined channels of the Ourthe and Vesdre. It  stretches across both sides, being connected by numerous bridges, while  parallel lines of railway follow the course of the main stream. The  trunk line from Germany into Belgium crosses the Meuse at Liege. For the  most part the old city of lofty houses clings to a cliffside on the left  bank, crowned by an ancient citadel of no modern defensive value.  Whatever picturesqueness Liege may have possessed is effaced by the  squalid and dilapidated condition of its poorer quarters. To the north  broad fertile plains extend into central Belgium, southward on the  opposite bank of the Meuse, the Ardennes present a hilly forest,  stream-watered region. In its downward course the Meuse flows out of the  Liege trench to expand through what is termed the Dutch Flats.    Liege, at the outbreak of the war, was a place of great wealth and  extreme poverty--a Liege artisan considered himself in prosperity on $5  a week. It was of the first strategic importance to Belgium. Its  situation was that of a natural fortress, barring the advance of a  German army.    The defenses of Liege were hardly worth an enemy's gunfire before 1890.  They had consisted of a single fort on the Meuse right bank, and the  citadel crowning the heights of the old town. But subsequently the  Belgian Chamber voted the necessary sums for fortifying Liege and Namur  on the latest principles. From the plans submitted, the one finally  decided upon was that of the famous Belgian military engineer Henri  Alexis Brialmont. His design was a circle of detached forts, already  approved by German engineers as best securing a city within from  bombardment. With regard to Liege and Namur particularly, Brialmont held  that his plan would make passages of the Meuse at those places  impregnable to an enemy.    When the German army stood before Liege on this fourth day of August, in  1914, the circumference of the detached forts was thirty-one miles with  about two or three miles between them, and at an average of five miles  from the city. Each fort was constructed on a new model to withstand the  highest range and power of offensive artillery forecast in the last  decade of the nineteenth century. When completed they presented the form  of an armored mushroom, thrust upward from a mound by subterranean  machinery. The elevation of the cupola in action disclosed no more of  its surface than was necessary for the firing of the guns. The mounds  were turfed and so inconspicuous that in times of peace sheep grazed  over them. In Brialmont's original plan each fort was to be connected by  infantry trenches with sunken emplacements for light artillery, but this  important part of his design was relegated to the dangerous hour of a  threatening enemy. This work was undertaken too late before the onsweep  of the Germans. Instead, Brialmont's single weak detail in surrounding  each fort with an infantry platform was tenaciously preserved long after  its uselessness must have been apparent. Thus Liege was made a ring  fortress to distinguish it from the former latest pattern of earth  ramparts and outworks.    Six major and six minor of these forts encircled Liege.
