We have indeed a  wondrous story to narrate; and could we tell it adequately it would  prove of boundless interest and of exquisite beauty. It leads to the  contemplation of grand phenomena in nature and great achievements of  human genius.    Let us enumerate a few of the questions which will be naturally asked by  one who seeks to learn something of those glorious bodies which adorn  our skies: What is the Sun--how hot, how big, and how distant? Whence  comes its heat? What is the Moon? What are its landscapes like? How does  our satellite move? How is it related to the earth? Are the planets  globes like that on which we live? How large are they, and how far off?  What do we know of the satellites of Jupiter and of the rings of Saturn?  How was Uranus discovered? What was the intellectual triumph which  brought the planet Neptune to light? Then, as to the other bodies of our  system, what are we to say of those mysterious objects, the comets? Can  we discover the laws of their seemingly capricious movements? Do we know  anything of their nature and of the marvellous tails with which they are  often decorated? What can be told about the shooting-stars which so  often dash into our atmosphere and perish in a streak of splendour? What  is the nature of those constellations of bright stars which have been  recognised from all antiquity, and of the host of smaller stars which  our telescopes disclose? Can it be true that these countless orbs are  really majestic suns, sunk to an appalling depth in the abyss of  unfathomable space? What have we to tell of the different varieties of  stars--of coloured stars, of variable stars, of double stars, of  multiple stars, of stars that seem to move, and of stars that seem at  rest? What of those glorious objects, the great star clusters? What of  the Milky Way? And, lastly, what can we learn of the marvellous nebulae  which our telescopes disclose, poised at an immeasurable distance? Such  are a few of the questions which occur when we ponder on the mysteries  of the heavens.    The history of Astronomy is, in one respect, only too like many other  histories. The earliest part of it is completely and hopelessly lost.  The stars had been studied, and some great astronomical discoveries had  been made, untold ages before those to which our earliest historical  records extend. For example, the observation of the apparent movement of  the sun, and the discrimination between the planets and the fixed stars,  are both to be classed among the discoveries of prehistoric ages. Nor is  it to be said that these achievements related to matters of an obvious  character. Ancient astronomy may seem very elementary to those of the  present day who have been familiar from childhood with the great truths  of nature, but, in the infancy of science, the men who made such  discoveries as we have mentioned must have been sagacious philosophers.    Of all the phenomena of astronomy the first and the most obvious is that  of the rising and the setting of the sun. We may assume that in the dawn  of human intelligence these daily occurrences would form one of the  first problems to engage the attention of those whose thoughts rose  above the animal anxieties of everyday existence. A sun sets and  disappears in the west. The following morning a sun rises in the east,  moves across the heavens, and it too disappears in the west; the same  appearances recur every day. To us it is obvious that the sun, which  appears each day, is the same sun; but this would not seem reasonable to  one who thought his senses showed him that the earth was a flat plain of  indefinite extent, and that around the inhabited regions on all sides  extended, to vast distances, either desert wastes or trackless oceans.  How could that same sun, which plunged into the ocean at a fabulous  distance in the west, reappear the next morning at an equally great  distance in the east? The old mythology asserted that after the sun had  dipped in the western ocean at sunset (the Iberians, and other ancient  nations, actually imagined that they could hear the hissing of the  waters when the glowing globe was plunged therein), it was seized by  Vulcan and placed in a golden goblet. This strange craft with its  astonishing cargo navigated the ocean by a northerly course, so as to  reach the east again in time for sunrise the following morning. Among  the earlier physicists of old it was believed that in some manner the  sun was conveyed by night across the northern regions, and that darkness  was due to lofty mountains, which screened off the sunbeams during the  voyage.    In the course of time it was thought more rational to suppose that the  sun actually pursued his course below the solid earth during the course  of the night. The early astronomers had, moreover, learned to recognise  the fixed stars. It was noticed that, like the sun, many of these stars  rose and set in consequence of the diurnal movement, while the moon  obviously followed a similar law. Philosophers thus taught that the  various heavenly bodies were in the habit of actually passing beneath  the solid earth.    By the acknowledgment that the whole contents of the heavens performed  these movements, an important step in comprehending the constitution of  the universe had been decidedly taken. It was clear that the earth could  not be a plane extending to an indefinitely great distance. It was also  obvious that there must be a finite depth to the earth below our feet.  Nay, more, it became certain that whatever the shape of the earth might  be, it was at all"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/27386"],[0,"House of John Procter, Witchcraft Martyr, 1692 (#2)"],[1,"that was the most  suitable and available ground in the near neighborhood of the house  where for so many years and at the time of his death he lived as the  tenant of the great Downing Farm. There was the entrance to the Farm  from Salem, and from that spot one obtains a full view of the farm  house where he lived, believed to be in part still standing on the  same site, and of the fine and far extending tillage land which  probably first attracted the admiration of Emanuel Downing two hundred  and seventy years ago, and is now found so attractive and admirably  suited to the purposes of a golf ground by the Salem Country Club.    What is now known as the Procter Tomb on the north side of Lowell  Street at the southeastern corner of the Downing Farm is of modern  origin. We cannot believe that John Procter's family would have  deposited his body in ground to which they then had no title except as  tenants. At the time of the imprisonment of John Procter and his wife  Elizabeth the family was no doubt broken up and the house stripped of  everything that could be taken away to pay the fees of arrest and  imprisonment. The great farm was no longer their home and they were  not again in a position to return to and occupy it as their own until  nearly a decade had passed, when, through the efforts of Thorndike,  one of the sons of John Procter, the Downing Farm in its entirety was  purchased from Charles, the grandson of Emanuel Downing and son of Sir  George Downing, then deceased.    At the time of his death in 1692 John Procter owned, except what land  in Ipswich he may have inherited from his father, only the fifteen  acres with a house upon it, which, as I have said, was just west of  the Downing Farm on the north side of Lowell Street. This fact alone  would render it entirely probable that when the body was removed, in  1692, it would be carried to this place. In fact, in view of the  peculiar circumstances of the necessity of secrecy and the otherwise  homeless condition of the family, no other place would have been  chosen.    And now that direct tradition of the descendants, independently of any  knowledge that John Procter owned this land, confirms this view by so  remarkably agreeing with long forgotten records as to the locality,  it may be said confidently that we know with reasonable certainty the  spot where these revered and honored relics were laid so long ago. The  \"bars as you go into the Philip H. Saunders place\" are still there,  and the way through is still used and marks the place where in 1708  John Higginson 3d and Hannah wife, in conveying to Daniel and Lawrence  Southwick the nine acre lot next east of Procter's lot, reserved the  liberty of a \"highway of one pole wide at the western end of said land  to be for ye use of Anthony Needham Sen,\" \"they to maintain a pair of  sufficient bars next ye common highway so long as they use the same.\"    Anthony Needham, Sen., at that time owned what has recently been known  as the Philip H. Saunders place, and this right of way was for the  benefit of that place. Mr. Dennis now lives at the westerly end of the  nine acre lot conveyed by Higginson, as above mentioned, which was  long known as the \"Flint Pasture.\" The bars and the way are now on the  west side of the wall dividing the Dennis land from the Procter lot  instead of being on the east side; indicating that the dividing line  was at some time changed. This change may have been made without any  evidence of it appearing on record, by Zachariah King, who owned both  lots from 1811 till 1818; and this would account for the apparent  change in size of the two lots as described in the deeds, the westerly  (or Procter) lot increasing while the easterly lot decreased.    On the north side of Lowell Street, about half way between these bars  and the John G. Walcott, Jun., house, is a well on the edge of the  road against a steep rocky hill rising back of it. This, I understand,  has sometimes been called the \"Procter well.\" There seems to be no  room for a house close by it on that side of the road, but it is  possible that the road may anciently have turned more to the south at  this point, though I have not found any evidence in the records to  that effect.    The history of the John Procter house and fifteen acres of land, as  derived from the records, may be briefly stated as follows:--    Before we can understand the meaning of the deeds of the Procter lot  we must know something of the history of the Downing Farm and  particularly of the nine acre lot known formerly as the Flint Pasture,  which is the large area of cleared land on the north side of Lowell  Street, on the west end of which is at present the house of Mr.  Dennis. That this may be better understood at a glance I have marked  on my sketch, by a broken line, the bounds of the Downing Farm, which  included the \"Flint Pasture.\"    It seems that about two hundred and seventy years ago Roger Morey, a  companion and it is thought a relative or connection of Roger  Williams, had a grant of forty or fifty acres, which was located to  the west or southwest of a large tract granted to Robert Cole and sold  to Emanuel Downing before 1638. The Roger Morey grant was on both  sides of what is now Lowell Street, that part on the northerly side  being the same nine or ten acres above mentioned as afterwards known  by the name of the Flint Pasture.    In a deposition by Nathaniel Felton Sept. 18, 1700, he being then 85  years of age, he says: \"Soon after Roger Morrey removed from Salem,  which was before 1644, I, this deponent, heard that said Morrey had  sold his land in the woods to Emanuel Downing and I do further testify  [as to?] a parcel of swamp or upland & meadow being a part and  belonging to ye said Morrey, and [it] lyeth at the westerly end of Mr.  Downing's farm\"--deponent \"has lived about 55 years a near neighbor to  said farm and never heard that said Morrey's land was claimed by  anybody but the tenants living on Mr. Downing's farm.\" [Reg'y of  Deeds, Salem, B. 15, Fol. 5.] Fortunately for the identification of  this land, a most remarkable bound often referred to in the ancient  deeds is still to be seen marking the exact northeasterly corner of  the Morey grant. It is a high and precipitous rock about twenty rods  northerly from Lowell street just opposite the house on the south side  which was formerly the house of Nathaniel Flint, and a few rods  westerly from the easterly way leading southerly to the Wyman Farm. It  forms the northeasterly corner bound of the \"Flint Pasture,\" and is  marked on my sketch \"Morey's Bound,\" that being the name given to it  in the numerous ancient deeds and depositions.    The return of the settlement of the northwesterly bounds of the  Downing Farm in 1681, recorded in Salem town records, gives the line  from the extreme northwestern corner by Putnam's land as running  \"strait on to a white oak called Morey's Bound.\"    In a controversy which seems to have existed in 1685 and in 1690  between Anthony Needham and the owners of land adjoining his,  presumably the owners of the Downing Farm, Nathaniel Felton testifies  that \"about 30 years since\" (that is about 1660) \"Mr. Thomas Gardner  and Jeffry Massey (who by virtue of a grant of 200 acres due unto Mr.  Bacon[A]) when they went to lay out the said 200 acres I this deponent  went with them, where cominge upon the land neere adjoyning to the  farm called Mr. Downings farme, the first bound they made of the said  two hundred acres was upon a hill being as I conceive about 20 rods on  the north side of the highway[B] leading up to Joseph Pope's farme,  and was a white oak sufficiently marked, ye which white oak the  surveyors affirmed was the northeast corner bounds of [Moreys][C]  farm, from thence they went upon a straight line westward to another  white oak which was marked also upon four sides, and stood neer about  20 rods to the northward of ye said highway which the said surveyors  affirmed to be the northwest corner bounds of the said [Morey's]  farme, and it also was the northeast corner bounds of John Marsh his  farme, which did joyne to ye [Morey] farme; and I doe further testifie  that John Marsh shewed me the said white oake and affirmed it to be  the northeast corner bound of his land and the northwest corner bound  of [Morey's] land.\"    [Footnote A: There are depositions recorded in Essex Reg'y, B. 11,  Fol. 186-9, by which it appears that Rebecca, wife of William Bacon,  was a daughter of Thomas Potter, Esq., and that her brother, Humphrey  Potter, was the father of Ann Potter, afterwards the wife of Anthony  Needham.]    [Footnote B: Now Lowell Street.]    [Footnote C: In the record it is Massey, evidently a mistake, as shown  by Marsh's deposition, next given.]    In 1685 Zachariah Marsh testifies that \"about 25 years since my father  John Marsh, desirous I should know the bounds of his farme took me  along with him, and he then shewed me all the four corner bounds  belonging to his farme, and this I doe testifie that he shewed me a  white oake sufficiently marked standing about 20 rods northward of the  highway leading up to Joseph Pope's by a little swamp the which oake  my father affirmed was the northeast corner bounds of his farme, and  that it was also the northwest corner bounds of Roger More's farme;  and further I doe testifie that when we run the line Anthony Needham  being present owned the said white oake to be the corner bounds of my  father's farme, and this is the bounds in controversy and ye same that  Nath. Felton attested unto, and hath ever been reputed so to be, no  man that ever I know having questioned it, till of late Anthony  Needham.\" This deposition was again sworn to in 1690. See Reg'y of  Deeds at Salem, Book 8, F. 181.    This controversy was probably between Anthony Needham and John  Procter as tenant of the Downing Farm, as appears by an action at  the Salem Court, Nov., 1685, for damage done to "]]]
