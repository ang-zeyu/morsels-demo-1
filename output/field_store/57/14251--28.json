I knew you would!\" as Madge Summers fell with a  crash on to the floor.        \"Seven little schoolgirls, eating sugar sticks;      One tumbled overboard, and then there were six!\"    \"Thank you. I think I prefer to 'take the chair', as the dentist says.  There only seems to be one in each cubicle, but as I'm the visitor----\"    \"Take care!\" screamed Maisie. \"My clean blouses!\"    \"What am I doing? I declare, I never saw them. There, I'll nurse them  for you while I eat this delicious-looking piece of pink rock.\"    The new girl was so utterly different from anybody else who had ever  come to St. Chad's that the others waited with curiosity to hear what  she would say next.    \"Well?\" she enquired coolly at last. \"I suppose you're thinking me  over. I should like to know your opinion of me. They tell me at home  that my nose turns up, and my tongue is too long. But I didn't turn up  my nose at the Edinburgh rock, did I?--and as for my tongue, it fits my  mouth, as a general rule, though it runs away sometimes.\"    \"When did you come?\"    \"What class are you in?\"    \"Have you seen Miss Cavendish yet?\"    \"How old are you?\"    \"Have you been to school before?\"    \"Do you know anyone here?\"    \"Why did you come to St. Chad's?\"    The questions were fired off all together from seven pairs of lips.    \"One at a time, please!\" returned Honor. \"I'm older than I look, and  younger than I seem. You mayn't believe me, yet I assure you I've only  had three birthdays.\"    \"Rubbish!\" said Chatty Burns.    \"It's a fact, all the same.\"    \"But how could that be?\" demanded Pauline Reynolds incredulously.    \"Because I was born on the twenty-ninth of February, and I can't have a  birthday except in a leap year. That accounts for anything odd there is  about me; so if you find me queer, you must just say: 'She's a  twenty-ninth of February girl', and make excuses for me. As for the  other questions, I've never been to school before; I've seen Miss  Cavendish, but I haven't heard yet what class I'm to be in; five  minutes ago I didn't know anybody here, but now I know--how many are  there of you?--one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine!\"    \"Have you unpacked yet?\" asked Maisie, returning to her box, which  Lettice had been steadily emptying.    \"Only about half.\"    \"I think we had better come and help you, then.\"    \"Better finish our own first!\" grunted Lettice, for which remark she  was promptly snubbed by her elder sister.    \"Miss Maitland will be up at eight o'clock to look at our drawers,\"  said Chatty Burns. \"She'll expect you to have everything put away, and  your coats and dresses hung in the wardrobe.\"    \"We have to be so fearfully tidy here!\" sighed Adeline Vaughan. \"A  warden comes round each morning, and woe betide you if you leave hairs  in your brush, or have forgotten to fold your nightdress!\"    \"It's just as bad at St. Hilary's,\" said Madge.    \"And worse at St. Bride's,\" added Ruth Latimer.    \"My father wanted me to be at the School House,\" said Honor, \"but Miss  Cavendish wrote that it was full, so I was entered at St. Chad's  instead.\"    \"Yes, you generally need to have your name down for two years before  you can get a vacancy at the School House,\" said Dorothy Arkwright.  \"It's the popular favourite with parents, because Miss Cavendish  herself is the Head; but really, St. Chad's is far nicer. We all stand  up for our own house, and I know you'll like it.\"    \"There's the tea-bell! Come along! we must go at once,\" interrupted  Chatty Burns.    \"Won't they wait for us?\" enquired Honor, beginning to wash her hands  with much deliberation.    \"Wait! She asks if they'll wait!\" exclaimed Adeline Vaughan.    \"One can see you've never been to school before!\" commented Maisie  Talbot. \"No, you certainly haven't time to comb your hair now. You had  better follow the rest of us as fast as you can.\"    St. Chad's could accommodate forty pupils, and Honor found a place  assigned to her in the dining-hall near the end of a long table, which  looked very attractive with its clean white cloth, its pretty china,  and its vases of flowers in the middle. She had a good view of her  schoolfellows, more than half of whom seemed of about the same age as  herself, though there were tall girls, with their hair already put up,  and a few younger ones who had apparently only just entered their  teens. Grace was sung, and then the urns began to fill an almost  ceaseless stream of cups, while plates of bread and butter circulated  with much rapidity.    \"We're late to-day,\" explained Honor's neighbour, \"because the train  from the North does not get in until five. Our usual tea-time is four  o'clock, after games; then we have supper at half-past seven, when  we've finished evening preparation. Did you bring any jam? Your hamper  will be unpacked to-morrow, and the pots labelled with your name. I  expect you'll find one opposite your plate at breakfast. Jam and  marmalade are the only things we're allowed, except plain cakes.\"    Tea on the first afternoon was generally an exciting occasion at St.  Chad's. There were so many greetings between old friends, so much news  and such various topics to be discussed, that conversation, in a  sufficiently subdued undertone, went on very briskly. The girls had  enjoyed their Easter holidays, but most of them seemed pleased to  return to school, for the summer term was always the favourite at  Chessington College.    \"Have you heard who's in the Eleven?\" began Madge Summers. \"They've  actually put in Grace Shaw, and she bowls abominably. I think it's rank  favouritism on Miss Young's part. She always gives St. Hilary's a turn  when she can.\"    \"She was a Hilaryite herself,\" returned Adeline Vaughan. \"That's the  worst of having a games mistress who's been educated at the school;  she's sure to show partiality for her old house.\"    \"And yet in one way it's better, because she understands all our  customs and private rules. It would be almost impossible to explain  everything to a new-comer.\"    \"What about the house team?\" asked Ruth Latimer. \"Is anything fixed?\"    \"Not yet. There's to be a practice to-morrow, and it will go by our  scores.\"    \"I shall stick to tennis,\" declared Pauline Reynolds. \"One gets a fair  chance there, at any rate, and we must keep up the credit of St. Chad's  in the courts. I don't know whether we've any chance of winning the  shield. I wish we could get a real champion!\"    \"You should see Flossie Taylor play!\" burst out Edith and Claudia  Hammond-Smith, who were anxious to bring their cousin forward, and to  ensure her popularity among the other girls.    \"I've not heard that she made any record at St. Bride's,\" remarked  Dorothy Arkwright, who resented Flossie's removal to St. Chad's.    \"She hasn't had an opportunity. She only came to school last Christmas,  and it wasn't the tennis season. Wait till you see her serve!\"    \"Miss Young will have to be judge, not I,\" replied Dorothy coldly.    \"Flossie is in your bedroom, Dorothy,\" announced Claudia. \"She has the  cubicle near the fireplace.\"    \"If you're sleeping in the bed next to mine,\" said Flossie, eyeing  Dorothy across the table with a rather patronizing air, \"I sincerely  hope you don't snore.\"    \"Of course not!\" responded Dorothy, in some indignation.    \"At St. Bride's,\" continued Flossie, \"one of my room-mates snored  atrociously. I used to have to get up and shake her, and pull the  pillow from under her head, before I could go to sleep.\"    \"You'd better not try that on with me!\"    \"I would, in a minute, if you kept me awake.\"    \"It is a shame she's not in our room,\" interposed Edith. \"We've asked  Miss Maitland to let her change with Geraldine Saunders, and I think  perhaps she may. We want Flossie all to ourselves; I do hope she'll let  us!\"    \"So do I!\" retorted Dorothy feelingly. \"The Hammond-Smiths are welcome  to their cousin, so far as I'm concerned,\" she whispered to Chatty  Burns; \"I don't like her. She's trying to show off. Edith and Claudia  are making far too much fuss over her.\"    \"They always gush,\" commented Chatty. \"Still, I dare say Flossie will  need taking down a little.\"    \"It would do her all the good in the world,\" replied Dorothy. Then,  turning to the Hammond-Smiths, she remarked aloud: \"There's a new girl  here who may be just as good as your cousin, for anything we know.  Honor Fitzgerald, do you play tennis?\"    \"I can play, but how you'll like it is another story,\" answered Honor.  \"We two,\" nodding at Flossie, \"had better try a set by ourselves, and  then you can choose the winner.\"    \"I'm sure I don't care about it, thank you.\" Flossie's tone was  supercilious.    \"All right! We don't force ourselves where we're not wanted in my part  of the world.\"    \"Is that Ireland? Then I suppose your name is Biddy?\"    \"Certainly not!\"    \"I thought all Irish girls were called Biddy; are you sure you're not?\"    \"My name is Honor Fitzgerald.\"    \"Really! I'm astonished it isn't Mulligan, or O'Grady.\"    The Hammond-Smiths giggled, and poked Effie and Blanche Lawson.    \"Isn't Flossie funny?\" they whispered delightedly.    \"I think she's very rude,\" observed Dorothy Arkwright. \"I call that an  extremely cheap form of wit.\"    \"Irish names are often rather peculiar,\" drawled Claudia Hammond-Smith.    \"They're quite as good as English ones, and sometimes a great deal more  ancient and aristocratic,\" returned Honor.    \"One for Claudia, and for Flossie Taylor too!\" said Dorothy to Chatty  Burns.    \"Paddy, for instance,\" interposed Flossie, who saw that the Lawsons  were listening, as well as her cousins. \"St. Patrick and pigs always go  together, in my mind. I suppose you keep a pig in Ireland?\"    \"Don't answer her!\" whispered Honor's neighbour. \"They're only teasing  you because you're new. They want to see how much you'll stand.\"    But poor"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/24062"],[0,"A History of the United States (#2)"],[1,". He was soon to give  a more dramatic manifestation of his strange taste for the truth.    The attack on political corruption, the next and perhaps the most  important passage in his life, still illustrates the same point,  touching reason and enthusiasm. Precisely because he did know what  Socialism is and what it is not, precisely because he had at least  learned that from the intellectual hardness of the Fabians, he saw the  spot where Fabian Socialism is not hard but soft. Socialism means the  assumption by the State of all the means of production, distribution,  and exchange. To quote (as he often quoted with a rational relish) the  words of Mr. Balfour, that is Socialism and nothing else is Socialism.  To such clear thinking, it is at once apparent that trusting a thing to  the State must always mean trusting it to the statesmen. He could defend  Socialism because he could define Socialism; and he was not helped or  hindered by the hazy associations of the sort of Socialists who  perpetually defended what they never defined. Such men might have a  vague vision of red flags and red ties waving in an everlasting riot  above the fall of top-hats and Union Jacks; but he knew that Socialism  established meant Socialism official, and conducted by some sort of  officials. All the primary forms of private property were to be given to  the government; and it occurred to him, as a natural precaution, to give  a glance at the government. He gave some attention to the actual types  and methods of that governing and official class, into whose power trams  and trades and shops and houses were already passing, amid loud Fabian  cheers for the progress of Socialism. He looked at modern parliamentary  government; he looked at it rationally and steadily and not without  reflection. And the consequence was that he was put in the dock, and  very nearly put in the lock-up, for calling it what it is.    In collaboration with Mr. Belloc he had written \"The Party System,\" in  which the plutocratic and corrupt nature of our present polity is set  forth. And when Mr. Belloc founded the _Eye-Witness_, as a bold and  independent organ of the same sort of criticism, he served as the  energetic second in command. He subsequently became editor of the  _Eye-Witness_, which was renamed as the _New Witness_. It was during the  latter period that the great test case of political corruption occurred;  pretty well known in England, and unfortunately much better known in  Europe, as the Marconi scandal. To narrate its alternate secrecies and  sensations would be impossible here; but one fashionable fallacy about  it may be exploded with advantage. An extraordinary notion still exists  that the _New Witness_ denounced Ministers for gambling on the Stock  Exchange. It might be improper for Ministers to gamble; but gambling was  certainly not a misdemeanor that would have hardened with any special  horror so hearty an Anti-Puritan as the man of whom I write. The Marconi  case did not raise the difficult ethics of gambling, but the perfectly  plain ethics of secret commissions. The charge against the Ministers was  that, while a government contract was being considered, they tried to  make money out of a secret tip, given them by the very government  contractor with whom their government was supposed to be bargaining.  This was what their accuser asserted; but this was not what they  attempted to answer by a prosecution. He was prosecuted, not for what  he had said of the government, but for some secondary things he had said  of the government contractor. The latter, Mr. Godfrey Isaacs, gained a  verdict for criminal libel; and the judge inflicted a fine of L100.  Readers may have chanced to note the subsequent incidents in the life of  Mr. Isaacs, but I am here only concerned with incidents in the life of a  more interesting person.    In any suggestion of his personality, indeed, the point does not lie in  what was done to him, but rather in what was not done. He was positively  assured, upon the very strongest and most converging legal authority,  that unless he offered certain excuses he would certainly go to prison  for several years. He did not offer those excuses; and I believe it  never occurred to him to do so. His freedom from fear of all kinds had  about it a sort of solid unconsciousness and even innocence. This  homogeneous quality in it has been admirably seized and summed up by Mr.  Belloc in a tribute of great truth and power. \"His courage was heroic,  native, positive and equal: always at the highest potentiality of  courage. He never in his life checked an action or a word from a  consideration of personal caution, and that is more than can be said of  any other man of his time.\" After the more or less nominal fine,  however, his moral victory was proved in the one way in which a military  victory can ever be proved. It is the successful general who continues  his own plan of campaign. Whether a battle be ticketed in the history  books as lost or won, the test is which side can continue to strike. He  continued to strike, and to strike harder than ever, up to the very  moment of that yet greater experience which changed all such military  symbols into military facts. A man with instincts unspoiled and in that  sense almost untouched, he would have always answered quite naturally to  the autochthonous appeal of patriotism; but it is again characteristic  of him that he desired, in his own phrase, to \"rationalize patriotism,\"  which he did upon the principles of Rousseau, that contractual theory  which, in these pages, he connects with the great name of Jefferson. But  things even deeper than patriotism impelled him against Prussianism. His  enemy was the barbarian when he enslaves, as something more hellish  even than the barbarian when he slays. His was the spiritual instinct by  which Prussian order was worse than Prussian anarchy; and nothing was so  inhuman as an inhuman humanitarianism. If you had asked him for what he  fought and died amid the wasted fields of France and Flanders, he might  very probably have answered that it was to save the world from German  social reforms.    This note, necessarily so broken and bemused, must reach its useless  end. I have said nothing of numberless things that should be remembered  at the mention of his name; of his books, which were great pamphlets and  may yet be permanent pamphlets; of his journalistic exposures of other  evils besides the Marconi, exposures that have made a new political  atmosphere in the very election that is stirring around us; of his visit  to America, which initiated him into an international friendship which  is the foundation of this book. Least of all can I write of him apart  from his work; of that loss nothing can be said by those who do not  suffer it, and less still by those who do. And his experiences in life  and death were so much greater even than my experiences of him, that a  double incapacity makes me dumb. A portrait is impossible; as a friend  he is too near me, and as a hero too far away.                                                      G. K. CHESTERTON.                                     AUTHOR'S PREFACE      I have taken advantage of a very brief respite from other, and in my  judgment more valuable, employment, to produce this short sketch of the  story of a great people, now our Ally. My motive has been mainly that I  do not think that any such sketch, concentrated enough to be readable by  the average layman who has other things to do (especially in these days)  than to study more elaborate and authoritative histories, at present  exists, and I have thought that in writing it I might perhaps be  discharging some little part of the heavy debt of gratitude which I owe  to America for the hospitality I received from her when I visited her  shores during the early months of the War.    This book is in another sense the product of that visit. What I then saw  and heard of contemporary America so fascinated me that--believing as I  do that the key to every people is in its past--I could not rest until I  had mastered all that I could of the history of my delightful hosts.  This I sought as much as possible from the original sources, reading  voraciously, and at the time merely for my pleasure, such records as I  could get of old debates and of the speech and correspondence of the  dead. The two existing histories, which I also read, and upon which I  have drawn most freely, are that of the present President of the United  States and that of Professor Rhodes, dealing with the period from 1850  to 1876. With the conclusions of the latter authority it will be obvious  that I am in many respects by no means at one; but I think it the more  necessary to say that without a careful study of his book I could  neither have formed my own conclusions nor ventured to challenge his.  The reading that I did at the time of which I speak is the foundation of  what I have now written. It will be well understood that a Private in  the British Army, even when invalided home for a season, has not very  great opportunities for research. I think it very likely that errors of  detail may be discovered in these pages; I am quite sure that I could  have made the book a better one if I had been able to give more time to  revising my studies. Yet I believe that the story told here is  substantially true; and I am very sure that it is worth the telling.    If I am asked why I think it desirable at this moment to attempt,  however inadequately, a history of our latest Ally, I answer that at  this moment the whole future of our civilization may depend upon a  thoroughly good understanding between those nations which are now joined  in battle for its defence, and that ignorance of each other's history is  perhaps the greatest menace to such an understanding.
