His home is in the trunk of some old birch or maple, with an entrance  far up amid the branches. In the spring he builds himself a summer-house  of small leafy twigs in the top of a neighboring beech, where the young  are reared and much of the time passed. But the safer retreat in the  maple is not abandoned, and both old and young resort thither in the  fall, or when danger threatens. Whether this temporary residence amid  the branches is for elegance or pleasure, or for sanitary reasons or  domestic convenience, the naturalist has forgotten to mention.    The elegant creature, so cleanly in its habits, so graceful in its  carriage, so nimble and daring in its movements, excites feelings of  admiration akin to those awakened by the birds and the fairer forms of  nature. His passage through the trees is almost a flight. Indeed, the  flying squirrel has little or no advantage over him, and in speed and  nimbleness cannot compare with him at all. If he miss his footing and  fall, he is sure to catch on the next branch; if the connection be  broken, he leaps recklessly for the nearest spray or limb, and secures  his hold, even if it be by the aid of his teeth.    His career of frolic and festivity begins in the fall, after the birds  have left us and the holiday spirit of nature has commenced to subside.  How much his presence adds to the pleasure of a saunter in the still  October woods. You step lightly across the threshold of the forest, and  sit down upon the first log or rock to await the signals. It is so still  that the ear suddenly seems to have acquired new powers, and there is no  movement to confuse the eye. Presently you hear the rustling of a  branch, and see it sway or spring as the squirrel leaps from or to it;  or else you hear a disturbance in the dry leaves, and mark one running  upon the ground. He has probably seen the intruder, and, not liking his  stealthy movements, desires to avoid a nearer acquaintance. Now he  mounts a stump to see if the way is clear, then pauses a moment at the  foot of a tree to take his bearings, his tail as he skims along  undulating behind him, and adding to the easy grace and dignity of his  movements. Or else you are first advised of his proximity by the  dropping of a false nut, or the fragments of the shucks rattling upon  the leaves. Or, again, after contemplating you a while unobserved, and  making up his mind that you are not dangerous, he strikes an attitude on  a branch, and commences to quack and bark, with an accompanying movement  of his tail. Late in the afternoon, when the same stillness reigns, the  same scenes are repeated. There is a black variety, quite rare, but  mating freely with the gray, from which it seems to be distinguished  only in color.    [Illustration: GRAY SQUIRREL]      The red squirrel is more common and less dignified than the gray, and  oftener guilty of petty larceny about the barns and grain-fields. He is  most abundant in mixed oak, chestnut, and hemlock woods, from which he  makes excursions to the fields and orchards, spinning along the tops of  the fences, which afford not only convenient lines of communication, but  a safe retreat if danger threatens. He loves to linger about the  orchard; and, sitting upright on the topmost stone in the wall, or on  the tallest stake in the fence, chipping up an apple for the seeds, his  tail conforming to the curve of his back, his paws shifting and turning  the apple, he is a pretty sight, and his bright, pert appearance atones  for all the mischief he does. At home, in the woods, he is very  frolicsome and loquacious. The appearance of anything unusual, if after  contemplating it a moment, he concludes it not dangerous, excites his  unbounded mirth and ridicule, and he snickers and chatters, hardly able  to contain himself; now darting up the trunk of a tree and squealing in  derision, then hopping into position on a limb and dancing to the music  of his own cackle, and all for your special benefit.    There is something very human in this apparent mirth and mockery of the  squirrels. It seems to be a sort of ironical laughter, and implies  self-conscious pride and exultation in the laughter. \"What a ridiculous  thing you are, to be sure!\" he seems to say; \"how clumsy and awkward,  and what a poor show for a tail! Look at me, look at me!\"--and he capers  about in his best style. Again, he would seem to tease you and provoke  your attention; then suddenly assumes a tone of good-natured, childlike  defiance and derision. That pretty little imp, the chipmunk, will sit on  the stone above his den and defy you, as plainly as if he said so, to  catch him before he can get into his hole if you can.      A hard winter affects the chipmunks very little; they are snug and warm  in their burrows in the ground and under the rocks, with a bountiful  store of nuts or grain. I have heard of nearly a half-bushel of  chestnuts being taken from a single den. They usually hole up in  November, and do not come out again till March or April, unless the  winter is very open and mild. Gray squirrels, when they have been partly  domesticated in parks and groves near dwellings, are said to hide their  nuts here and there upon the ground, and in winter to dig them up from  beneath the snow, always hitting the spot accurately.    The red squirrel lays up no stores like the provident chipmunk, but  scours about for food in all weathers, feeding upon the seeds in the  cones of the hemlock that still cling to the tree, upon sumac-bobs, and  the seeds of frozen apples. I have seen the ground under a wild  apple-tree that stood near the woods completely covered with the  \"chonkings\" of the frozen apples, the work of the squirrels in getting  at the seeds; not an apple had been left, and apparently not a seed had  been lost. But the squirrels in this particular locality evidently got  pretty hard up before spring, for they developed a new source of  food-supply. A young bushy-topped sugar-maple, about forty feet high,  standing beside a stone fence near the woods, was attacked, and more  than half denuded of its bark. The object of the squirrels seemed to be  to get at the soft, white, mucilaginous substance (cambium layer)  between the bark and the wood. The ground was covered with fragments of  the bark, and the white, naked stems and branches had been scraped by  fine teeth. When the sap starts in the early spring, the squirrels add  this to their scanty supplies. They perforate the bark of the branches  of the maples with their chisel-like teeth, and suck the sweet liquid  as it slowly oozes out. It is not much as food, but evidently it helps.    I have said the red squirrel does not lay by a store of food for winter  use, like the chipmunk and the wood-mice; yet in the fall he sometimes  hoards in a tentative, temporary kind of way. I have seen his  savings--butternuts and black walnuts--stuck here and there in saplings  and trees near his nest; sometimes carefully inserted in the upright  fork of a limb or twig. One day, late in November, I counted a dozen or  more black walnuts put away in this manner in a little grove of locusts,  chestnuts, and maples by the roadside, and could but smile at the wise  forethought of the rascally squirrel. His supplies were probably safer  that way than if more elaborately hidden. They were well distributed;  his eggs were not all in one basket, and he could go away from home  without any fear that his storehouse would be broken into in his  absence. The next week, when I passed that way, the nuts were all gone  but two. I saw the squirrel that doubtless laid claim to them, on each  occasion.    There is one thing the red squirrel knows unerringly that I do not  (there are probably several other things); that is, on which side of the  butternut the meat lies. He always gnaws through the shell so as to  strike the kernel broadside, and thus easily extract it; while to my  eyes there is no external mark or indication, in the form or appearance  of the nut, as there is in the hickory-nut, by which I can tell whether  the edge or the side of the meat is toward me. But examine any number of  nuts that the squirrels have rifled, and, as a rule, you will find they  always drill through the shell at the one spot where the meat will be  most exposed. Occasionally one makes a mistake, but not often. It stands  them in hand to know, and they do know. Doubtless, if butternuts were a  main source of my food, and I were compelled to gnaw into them, I should  learn, too, on which side my bread was buttered.    The cheeks of the red and gray squirrels are made without pockets, and  whatever they transport is carried in the teeth. They are more or less  active all winter, but October and November are their festal months.  Invade some butternut or hickory grove on a frosty October morning, and  hear the red squirrel beat the \"juba\" on a horizontal branch. It is a  most lively jig, what the boys call a \"regular break-down,\" interspersed  with squeals and snickers and derisive laughter. The most noticeable  peculiarity about the vocal part of it is the fact that it is a kind of  duet. In other words, by some ventriloquial tricks, he appears to  accompany himself, as if his voice split up, a part forming a low  guttural sound, and a part a shrill nasal sound.          II    THE CHIPMUNK      The first chipmunk in March is as sure a token of the spring as the  first bluebird or the first robin, and is quite as welcome. Some genial  influence has found him out there in his burrow, deep under the ground,  and waked him up, and enticed him forth into the light of day. The red  squirrel has been more or less active all winter; his track has dotted  the surface of every new-fallen snow throughout the season. But the  chipmunk retired from view early in December, and has passed the  rigorous months in his nest, beside his hoard of nuts,"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/24389"],[0,"Blue-Bird Weather (#2)"],[1,"\"It _has_ been.\"    \"What do you think of the prospects for to-morrow?\"    [Illustration: \"She said gravely: 'I am afraid it will be blue-bird  weather.'\"]    She said gravely: \"I am afraid it will be blue-bird weather.\"    It was a new, but graphic, expression to him; and he often remembered  it afterward, and how quaintly it fell from her lips as she stood there  in the light of the kerosene lamp, slim, self-possessed, in her faded  gingham gown and apron, the shapely middle finger of one little  weather-tanned hand resting on the edge of the cloth.    \"You are Miss Herold, I suppose?\" he said, looking up at her with his  pleasant smile.    \"Yes.\"    \"You are not Southern?\"    \"No,\" she said briefly. And he then remembered that the Hon. Cicero W.  Gilkins, when he was president of the now defunct club, had installed a  Northern man as resident chief game-protector and superintendent at the  Foam Island Club House.    Marche had never even seen Herold; but, through lack of personal  interest, and also because he needed somebody to look out for the  property, he had continued to pay this man Herold his inconsiderable  salary every year, scarcely knowing, himself, why he did not put the  Foam Island shooting on the market and close up the matter for good.    \"It's been five years since I was here, Miss Herold,\" he said, smiling.  \"That was in the old days of the club, when Judge Gilkins and Colonel  Vyse used to come here shooting every season. But you don't remember  them, I fancy.\"    \"I remember them.\"    \"Really! You must have been quite a child.\"    \"I was thirteen.\"    \"Oh, then you are eighteen, now,\" he said humorously.    Her grave, young lips were only slightly responsive to his smile.    \"You have been here a long time,\" he said. \"Do you find it lonely?\"    \"Sometimes,\" she admitted.    \"What do you do for recreation?\"    \"I don't think I know what you mean, Mr. Marche.\"    \"I mean for pleasure.\"    She looked at him out of her clear, gray eyes, then turned her gaze on  the window. But she could not see through it; the pane only reflected  her face darkly; and to her, for a moment, it seemed that way with her  whole pent-up life, here in the Virginia marshes--no outlet, no outlook,  and wherever she turned her wistful eyes only her own imprisoned self to  confront her out of the dull obscurity.    \"I suppose,\" he said, watching her, \"that you sometimes go to Norfolk  for a holiday?\"    \"No.\"    \"Or to Old Point, or Baltimore, perhaps?\"    She had her under lip between her teeth, now, and was looking so fixedly  at the window that he thought she had not heard him.    He rose from the table, and as she turned to meet his pleasant eyes he  smilingly thanked her for waiting on him.    \"And now,\" he said, \"if you will say to your father that I'd like to  have a little talk with him----\"    \"Father is ill in bed,\" she said, in a low voice.    \"Oh, I'm sorry. I hope it isn't anything serious.\"    \"I--think not.\"    \"Will he be able to see me to-morrow?\"    \"I am afraid not, Mr. Marche. He--he asked me to say to you that you  might safely transact any business with me. I know all about it,\" she  said, speaking a little hurriedly. \"I keep the accounts, and I have  every item and every bill ready for your inspection; and I can tell you  exactly what condition the property is in and what lumber has been cut  and what repairs have been necessary. Whenever you are ready for me, I  will come into the sitting room,\" she added, \"because Jim and I have had  our supper.\"    \"Very well,\" he said, smiling, \"I am ready now, if you are.\"    So she went away to rinse her hands and lay aside her apron, and in a  few minutes she entered the sitting room. He rose and placed a chair for  her, and she thanked him, flushing a little, and then he resumed his  seat, watching her sorting over the papers in her lap.    Presently she crossed one knee over the other, and one slim, prettily  shaped foot, in its shabby shoe, swung clear of its shadow on the floor.  Then she handed him a sheaf of bills for his inspection, and, pencil in  hand, followed the totals as he read them off aloud.    For half an hour they compared and checked off items, and he found her  accounts accurate to a penny.    \"Father bought three geese and a gander from Ike Helm,\" she said. \"They  were rather expensive, but two were mated, and they call very well when  tied out separated. Do you think it was too expensive?\" she added  timidly, showing him the bill.    \"No,\" he said, smiling. \"I think it's all right. Mated decoys are what  we need, and you can wing-tip a dozen before you get one that will talk  at the right time.\"    \"That is true,\" she said eagerly. \"We try our best to keep up the decoys  and have nothing but talkers. Our geese are nearly all right, and our  ducks are good, but our swans are _so_ vexing! They seem to be such  fools, and they usually behave like silly cygnets. You will see  to-morrow.\"    While she was speaking, her brother came quietly into the room with an  open book in his hands, and Marche, glancing at it curiously, saw that  it was a Latin grammar.    \"Where do you go to school, Jim?\" he asked.    \"Father teaches me.\"    Marche, rather astonished at the calibre of his superintendent,  glanced from the boy to his sister in silence. The girl's head  remained steadily lowered over the papers on her knee, but he saw her  foot swinging in nervous rhythm, and he was conscious of her silent  impatience at something or other, perhaps at the interruption in their  business discussion.    [Illustration: \"'Well,' he said pleasantly, 'what comes next, Miss  Herold?'\"]    \"Well,\" he said pleasantly, \"what comes next, Miss Herold?\"    She handed him a list of the decoys. He read it gravely, nodded, and  returned it.    \"You may count them for yourself to-morrow,\" she said.    \"Not at all. I trust you entirely,\" he replied laughingly.    Then they went over the remaining matters, the condition of the pine  timber, the repairs to the boats and blinds and stools, items for snaps,  swivels, paint, cement, wire, none of which interested Marche as much as  the silent boy reading his Latin grammar by the smoky lamp interested  him, or the boy's sister bending over the papers on her knee, pencil  poised in her pretty, weather-roughened hand.    \"I sent the shells from New York by express,\" he said. \"Did they  arrive?\"    \"I left two hundred in your room,\" said the boy, looking up.    \"Oh, thank you, Jim.\" And, turning to his sister, who had raised her  head, inquiringly, \"I suppose somebody will call me at the screech of  dawn, won't they?\"    \"Do you know the new law?\" she asked.    \"No. I don't like laws, anyway,\" he said smilingly.    She smiled, too, gathering up her papers preparatory to departure.  \"Nobody is allowed,\" she said, \"to put off from shore until the sun is  above the horizon line. And the wardens are very strict.\" Then she rose.  \"Will you excuse me? I have the dishes to do.\"    The boy laid aside his book and stood up, but his sister said:    \"Stay and study, Jim. I don't need any help.\"    And Jim resumed his seat with heightened color. A moment later, however,  he went out to the kitchen.    \"Look here, Molly,\" he said, \"wha'd' you want to give me away for?  He'll think I'm a sissy, helping you do dishes and things.\"    \"My dear, my dear!\" she exclaimed contritely, \"I didn't think of it.  Please forgive me, Jim. Anyway, you don't really care what this man  thinks about any of us----\"    \"Yes, I do! Anyway, a fellow doesn't want another fellow to think he  washes dishes.\"    \"You darling! Forgive me. I wasn't thinking. It was too stupid of me.\"    \"It really was,\" said the boy, in his sweet, dignified voice, \"and I'd  been telling him that I'd shot ducks, too.\"    [Illustration: \"'I'm _so_ sorry, Jim.'\"]    His sister caught him around the neck and kissed his blonde head. \"I'm  _so_ sorry, Jim. He won't think of it again. If he does, he'll only  respect a boy who is so good to his sister. And,\" she added,  cautioning him with lifted finger, \"don't talk too much to him, Jim, no  matter how nice and kind he is. I know how lonely you are and how  pleasant it is to talk to a man like Mr. Marche; but remember that  father doesn't wish us to say anything about ourselves or about him, so  we must be careful.\"    \"Why doesn't father want us to speak about him or ourselves to Mr.  Marche?\" asked the boy.    His sister had gone back to her dishes. Now, looking around over her  shoulder, she said seriously, \"That is father's affair, dear, not ours.\"    \"But don't you know why?\"    \"Shame on you, Jim! What father cares to tell us he will tell us; but  it's exceedingly bad manners to ask.\"    \"Is father really very ill?\"    \"I told you that to ask me such things is improper,\" said the girl,  coloring. \"He has told us that he does not feel well, and that he  prefers to remain in his room for a few days. That is enough for us,  isn't it?\"    \"Yes,\" said the boy thoughtfully.          II      Marche, buried under a mountain of bed clothes, dreamed that people were  rapping noisily on his door, and grinned in his dream, meaning to let  them rap until they tired of it. Suddenly a voice sounded through his  defiant slumbers, clear and charming as a golden ray parting thick  clouds. The next moment he found himself awake, bolt upright in the icy  dusk of his room, listening.    \"Mr. Marche! Won't you _please_ wake up and answer?\" came the clear,  young voice again.    \"I _beg_ your pardon!\" he cried. \"I'll be down in a minute!\"    He heard her going away downstairs, and for a few seconds he squatted  there, huddled in coverings to the chin, and eying the darkness in a  sort of despair. The feverish drive of Wall Street, late suppers, and  too much good fellowship had not physically hardened Marche. He was  accustomed to have his bath tempered comfortably for his particular  brand of physique. Breakfast, also, was a most carefully ordered  informality "]]]
