Poets seize people at present on every street  corner.\"    \"Of course they do. Thou wilt not pass any basilica, bath, library, or  book-shop without seeing a poet gesticulating like a monkey. Agrippa, on  coming here from the East, mistook them for madmen. And it is just such  a time now. Caesar writes verses; hence all follow in his steps. Only it  is not permitted to write better verses than Caesar, and for that reason  I fear a little for Lucan. But I write prose, with which, however, I do  not honor myself or others. What the lector has to read are codicilli of  that poor Fabricius Veiento.\"    \"Why 'poor'?\"    \"Because it has been communicated to him that he must dwell in Odyssa  and not return to his domestic hearth till he receives a new command.  That Odyssey will be easier for him than for Ulysses, since his wife  is no Penelope. I need not tell thee, for that matter, that he acted  stupidly. But here no one takes things otherwise than superficially. His  is rather a wretched and dull little book, which people have begun to  read passionately only when the author is banished. Now one hears on  every side, 'Scandala! scandala!' and it may be that Veiento invented  some things; but I, who know the city, know our patres and our women,  assure thee that it is all paler than reality. Meanwhile every man is  searching in the book,--for himself with alarm, for his acquaintances  with delight. At the book-shop of Avirnus a hundred copyists are writing  at dictation, and its success is assured.\"    \"Are not thy affairs in it?\"    \"They are; but the author is mistaken, for I am at once worse and less  flat than he represents me. Seest thou we have lost long since the  feeling of what is worthy or unworthy,--and to me even it seems that in  real truth there is no difference between them, though Seneca, Musonius,  and Trasca pretend that they see it. To me it is all one! By Hercules,  I say what I think! I have preserved loftiness, however, because I know  what is deformed and what is beautiful; but our poet, Bronzebeard, for  example, the charioteer, the singer, the actor, does not understand  this.\"    \"I am sorry, however, for Fabricius! He is a good companion.\"    \"Vanity ruined the man. Every one suspected him, no one knew certainly;  but he could not contain himself, and told the secret on all sides in  confidence. Hast heard the history of Rufinus?\"    \"No.\"    \"Then come to the frigidarium to cool; there I will tell thee.\"    They passed to the frigidarium, in the middle of which played a fountain  of bright rose-color, emitting the odor of violets. There they sat in  niches which were covered with velvet, and began to cool themselves.  Silence reigned for a time. Vinicius looked awhile thoughtfully at a  bronze faun which, bending over the arm of a nymph, was seeking her lips  eagerly with his lips.    \"He is right,\" said the young man. \"That is what is best in life.\"    \"More or less! But besides this thou lovest war, for which I have no  liking, since under tents one's finger-nails break and cease to be rosy.  For that matter, every man has his preferences. Bronzebeard loves song,  especially his own; and old Scaurus his Corinthian vase, which stands  near his bed at night, and which he kisses when he cannot sleep. He has  kissed the edge off already. Tell me, dost thou not write verses?\"    \"No; I have never composed a single hexameter.\"    \"And dost thou not play on the lute and sing?\"    \"No.\"    \"And dost thou drive a chariot?\"    \"I tried once in Antioch, but unsuccessfully.\"    \"Then I am at rest concerning thee. And to what party in the hippodrome  dost thou belong?\"    \"To the Greens.\"    \"Now I am perfectly at rest, especially since thou hast a large property  indeed, though thou art not so rich as Pallas or Seneca. For seest thou,  with us at present it is well to write verses, to sing to a lute, to  declaim, and to compete in the Circus; but better, and especially safer,  not to write verses, not to play, not to sing, and not to compete in  the Circus. Best of all, is it to know how to admire when Bronzebeard  admires. Thou art a comely young man; hence Poppaea may fall in love with  thee. This is thy only peril. But no, she is too experienced; she cares  for something else. She has had enough of love with her two husbands;  with the third she has other views. Dost thou know that that stupid  Otho loves her yet to distraction? He walks on the cliffs of Spain, and  sighs; he has so lost his former habits, and so ceased to care for his  person, that three hours each day suffice him to dress his hair. Who  could have expected this of Otho?\"    \"I understand him,\" answered Vinicius; \"but in his place I should have  done something else.\"    \"What, namely?\"    \"I should have enrolled faithful legions of mountaineers of that  country. They are good soldiers,--those Iberians.\"    \"Vinicius! Vinicius! I almost wish to tell thee that thou wouldst not  have been capable of that. And knowest why? Such things are done, but  they are not mentioned even conditionally. As to me, in his place, I  should have laughed at Poppaea, laughed at Bronzebeard, and formed for  myself legions, not of Iberian men, however, but Iberian women. And what  is more, I should have written epigrams which I should not have read to  any one,--not like that poor Rufinus.\"    \"Thou wert to tell me his history.\"    \"I will tell it in the unctorium.\"    But in the unctorium the attention of Vinicius was turned to other  objects; namely, to wonderful slave women who were waiting for the  bathers. Two of them, Africans, resembling noble statues of ebony,  began to anoint their bodies with delicate perfumes from Arabia; others,  Phrygians, skilled in hairdressing, held in their hands, which were  bending and flexible as serpents, combs and mirrors of polished steel;  two Grecian maidens from Kos, who were simply like deities, waited as  vestiplicae, till the moment should come to put statuesque folds in the  togas of the lords.    \"By the cloud-scattering Zeus!\" said Marcus Vinicius, \"what a choice  thou hast!\"    \"I prefer choice to numbers,\" answered Petronius. \"My whole 'familia'  [household servants] in Rome does not exceed four hundred, and I judge  that for personal attendance only upstarts need a greater number of  people.\"    \"More beautiful bodies even Bronzebeard does not possess,\" said  Vinicius, distending his nostrils.    \"Thou art my relative,\" answered Petronius, with a certain friendly  indifference, \"and I am neither so misanthropic as Barsus nor such a  pedant as Aulus Plautius.\"    When Vinicius heard this last name, he forgot the maidens from Kos for a  moment, and, raising his head vivaciously, inquired,--\"Whence did Aulus  Plautius come to thy mind? Dost thou know that after I had disjointed  my arm outside the city, I passed a number of days in his house? It  happened that Plautius came up at the moment when the accident happened,  and, seeing that I was suffering greatly, he took me to his house; there  a slave of his, the physician Merion, restored me to health. I wished to  speak with thee touching this very matter.\"    \"Why? Is it because thou hast fallen in love with Pomponia perchance? In  that case I pity thee; she is not young, and she is virtuous! I cannot  imagine a worse combination. Brr!\"    \"Not with Pomponia--eheu!\" answered Vinicius.    \"With whom, then?\"    \"If I knew myself with whom? But I do not know to a certainty her name  even,--Lygia or Callina? They call her Lygia in the house, for she comes  of the Lygian nation; but she has her own barbarian name, Callina. It is  a wonderful house,--that of those Plautiuses. There are many people in  it; but it is quiet there as in the groves of Subiacum. For a number  of days I did not know that a divinity dwelt in the house. Once about  daybreak I saw her bathing in the garden fountain; and I swear to thee  by that foam from which Aphrodite rose, that the rays of the dawn passed  right through her body. I thought that when the sun rose she would  vanish before me in the light, as the twilight of morning does. Since  then, I have seen her twice; and since then, too, I know not what rest  is, I know not what other desires are, I have no wish to know what the  city can give me. I want neither women, nor gold, nor Corinthian bronze,  nor amber, nor pearls, nor wine, nor feasts; I want only Lygia. I am  yearning for her, in sincerity I tell thee, Petronius, as that Dream who  is imaged on the Mosaic of thy tepidarium yearned for Paisythea,--whole  days and night do I yearn.\"    \"If she is a slave, then purchase her.\"    \"She is not a slave.\"    \"What is she? A freed woman of Plautius?\"    \"Never having been a slave, she could not be a freed woman.\"    \"Who is she?\"    \"I know not,--a king's daughter, or something of that sort.\"    \"Thou dost rouse my curiosity, Vinicius.\"    \"But if thou wish to listen, I will satisfy thy curiosity straightway.  Her story is not a long one. Thou art acquainted, perhaps personally,  with Vannius, king of the Suevi, who, expelled from his country, spent a  long time here in Rome, and became even famous for his skilful play with  dice, and his good driving of chariots. Drusus put him on the throne  again. Vannius, who was really a strong man, ruled well at first, and  warred with success; afterward, however, he began to skin not only his  neighbors, but his own Suevi, too much. Thereupon Vangio and Sido, two  sister's sons of his, and the sons of Vibilius, king of the Hermunduri,  determined to force him to Rome again--to try his luck there at dice.\"    \"I remember; that is of recent Claudian times.\"    \"Yes! War broke out. Vannius summoned to his aid the Yazygi; his dear  nephews called in the Lygians, who, hearing of the riches of Vannius,  and enticed by the hope of booty, came in such numbers that Caesar  himself, Claudius, began to fear for the safety of the boundary.  Claudius did not "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/28536"],[0,"The Astronomy of the Bible (#2)"],[1,"Standards of the Four Camps of    Israel--The Blessings of Jacob and Moses--The Prophecies of    Balaam--The Golden Calf--The Lion of Judah                       186    CHAPTER V.
