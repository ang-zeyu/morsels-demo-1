I don't suppose the mother was ever born who would do such  a thing.  But that is not a common case, is it?  Have you any other?'  The  young man paused before he spoke:    'There is another, but I don't think I can go into it fairly with you.'    'Why not?'    'Well, because after all you know, Stephen, you are only a girl and you  can't be expected to know.'  The girl laughed:    'Well, if it's anything about women surely a girl, even of my tender age,  must know something more of it, or be able to guess at, than any young  man can.  However, say what you think and I'll tell you frankly if I  agree--that is if a woman can be just, in such a matter.'    'Shortly the point is this: Can a woman be just to another woman, or to a  man for the matter of that, where either her own affection or a fault of  the other is concerned?'    'I don't see any reason to the contrary.  Surely pride alone should  ensure justice in the former case, and the consciousness of superiority  in the other.'  The young man shook his head:    'Pride and the consciousness of superiority!  Are they not much the same  thing.  But whether or no, if either of them has to be relied on, I'm  afraid the scales of Justice would want regulating, and her sword should  be blunted in case its edge should be turned back on herself.  I have an  idea that although pride might be a guiding principle with you  individually, it would be a failure with the average.  However, as it  would be in any case a rule subject to many exceptions I must let it go.'    Harold looked at his watch and rose.  Stephen followed him; transferring  her whip into the hand which held up the skirt, she took his arm with her  right hand in the pretty way in which a young girl clings to her elders.  Together they went out at the lich-gate.  The groom drew over with the  horses.  Stephen patted hers and gave her a lump of sugar.  Then putting  her foot into Harold's ready hand she sprang lightly into the saddle.  Harold swung himself into his saddle with the dexterity of an  accomplished rider.    As the two rode up the road, keeping on the shady side under the trees,  Stephen said quietly, half to herself, as if the sentence had impressed  itself on her mind:    'To be God and able to do things!'    Harold rode on in silence.  The chill of some vague fear was upon him.          CHAPTER I--STEPHEN      Stephen Norman of Normanstand had remained a bachelor until close on  middle age, when the fact took hold of him that there was no immediate  heir to his great estate.  Whereupon, with his wonted decision, he set  about looking for a wife.    He had been a close friend of his next neighbour, Squire Rowly, ever  since their college days.  They had, of course, been often in each  other's houses, and Rowly's young sister--almost a generation younger  than himself, and the sole fruit of his father's second marriage--had  been like a little sister to him too.  She had, in the twenty years which  had elapsed, grown to be a sweet and beautiful young woman.  In all the  past years, with the constant opportunity which friendship gave of close  companionship, the feeling never altered.  Squire Norman would have been  surprised had he been asked to describe Margaret Rowly and found himself  compelled to present the picture of a woman, not a child.    Now, however, when his thoughts went womanward and wifeward, he awoke to  the fact that Margaret came within the category of those he sought.  His  usual decision ran its course.  Semi-brotherly feeling gave place to a  stronger and perhaps more selfish feeling.  Before he even knew it, he  was head over ears in love with his pretty neighbour.    Norman was a fine man, stalwart and handsome; his forty years sat so  lightly on him that his age never seemed to come into question in a  woman's mind.  Margaret had always liked him and trusted him; he was the  big brother who had no duty in the way of scolding to do.  His presence  had always been a gladness; and the sex of the girl, first unconsciously  then consciously, answered to the man's overtures, and her consent was  soon obtained.    When in the fulness of time it was known that an heir was expected,  Squire Norman took for granted that the child would be a boy, and held  the idea so tenaciously that his wife, who loved him deeply, gave up  warning and remonstrance after she had once tried to caution him against  too fond a hope.  She saw how bitterly he would be disappointed in case  it should prove to be a girl.  He was, however, so fixed on the point  that she determined to say no more.  After all, it might be a boy; the  chances were equal.  The Squire would not listen to any one else at all;  so as the time went on his idea was more firmly fixed than ever.  His  arrangements were made on the base that he would have a son.  The name  was of course decided.  Stephen had been the name of all the Squires of  Normanstand for ages--as far back as the records went; and Stephen the  new heir of course would be.    Like all middle-aged men with young wives he was supremely anxious as the  time drew near.  In his anxiety for his wife his belief in the son became  passive rather than active.  Indeed, the idea of a son was so deeply  fixed in his mind that it was not disturbed even by his anxiety for the  young wife he idolised.    When instead of a son a daughter was born, the Doctor and the nurse, who  knew his views on the subject, held back from the mother for a little the  knowledge of the sex.  Dame Norman was so weak that the Doctor feared  lest anxiety as to how her husband would bear the disappointment, might  militate against her.  Therefore the Doctor sought the Squire in his  study, and went resolutely at his task.    'Well, Squire, I congratulate you on the birth of your child!'  Norman  was of course struck with the use of the word 'child'; but the cause of  his anxiety was manifested by his first question:    'How is she, Doctor?  Is she safe?'  The child was after all of secondary  importance!  The Doctor breathed more freely; the question had lightened  his task.  There was, therefore, more assurance in his voice as he  answered:    'She is safely through the worst of her trouble, but I am greatly anxious  yet.  She is very weak.  I fear anything that might upset her.'    The Squire's voice came quick and strong:    'There must be no upset!  And now tell me about my son?'  He spoke the  last word half with pride, half bashfully.    'Your son is a daughter!'  There was silence for so long that the Doctor  began to be anxious.  Squire Norman sat quite still; his right hand  resting on the writing-table before him became clenched so hard that the  knuckles looked white and the veins red.  After a long slow breath he  spoke:    'She, my daughter, is well?'  The Doctor answered with cheerful alacrity:    'Splendid!--I never saw a finer child in my life.  She will be a comfort  and an honour to you!'  The Squire spoke again:    'What does her mother think?  I suppose she's very proud of her?'    'She does not know yet that it is a girl.  I thought it better not to let  her know till I had told you.'    'Why?'    'Because--because--Norman, old friend, you know why!  Because you had set  your heart on a son; and I know how it would grieve that sweet young wife  and mother to feel your disappointment.  I want your lips to be the first  to tell her; so that on may assure her of your happiness in that a  daughter has been born to you.'    The Squire put out his great hand and laid it on the other's shoulder.  There was almost a break in his voice as he said:    'Thank you, my old friend, my true friend, for your thought.  When may I  see her?'    'By right, not yet.  But, as knowing your views, she may fret herself  till she knows, I think you had better come at once.'    All Norman's love and strength combined for his task.  As he leant over  and kissed his young wife there was real fervour in his voice as he said:    'Where is my dear daughter that you may place her in my arms?'  For an  instant there came a chill to the mother's heart that her hopes had been  so far disappointed; but then came the reaction of her joy that her  husband, her baby's father, was pleased.  There was a heavenly dawn of  red on her pale face as she drew her husband's head down and kissed him.    'Oh, my dear,' she said, 'I am so happy that you are pleased!'  The nurse  took the mother's hand gently and held it to the baby as she laid it in  the father's arms.    He held the mother's hand as he kissed the baby's brow.    The Doctor touched him gently on the arm and beckoned him away.  He went  with careful footsteps, looking behind as he went.    After dinner he talked with the Doctor on various matters; but presently  he asked:    'I suppose, Doctor, it is no sort of rule that the first child regulates  the sex of a family?'    'No, of course not.  Otherwise how should we see boys and girls mixed in  one family, as is nearly always the case.  But, my friend,' he went on,  'you must not build hopes so far away.  I have to tell you that your wife  is far from strong.  Even now she is not so well as I could wish, and  there yet may be change.'  The Squire leaped impetuously to his feet as  he spoke quickly:    'Then why are we waiting here?  Can nothing be done?  Let us have the  best help, the best advice in the world.'  The Doctor raised his hand.    'Nothing can be done as yet.  I have only fear.'    'Then let us be ready in case your fears should be justified!  Who are  the best men in London to help in such a case?'  The Doctor mentioned two  names; and within a few minutes a mounted messenger was galloping to  Norcester, the nearest telegraph centre.  The messenger was to arrange  for a special train if necessary.  Shortly afterwards the Doctor went  again to see his patient.  After a long absence he came back,"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/2526"],[0,"The Yoga Sutras of Patanjali: The Book of the Spiritual Man (#2)"],[1,"in terms of  mind-images, which are the material of which the psychic world is  built, Therefore the sages teach that the world of our perception,  which is indeed a world of mind-images, is but the wraith or shadow  of the real and everlasting world. In this sense, memory is but the  psychical inversion of the spiritual, ever-present vision. That which is  ever before the spiritual eye of the Seer needs not to be remembered.    12. The control of these psychic activities comes through the right use  of the will, and through ceasing from self-indulgence.    If these psychical powers and energies, even such evil things as  passion and hate and fear, are but spiritual powers fallen and  perverted, how are we to bring about their release and restoration?  Two means are presented to us: the awakening of the spiritual will,  and the purification of mind and thought.    13. The right use of the will is the steady, effort to stand in spiritual  being.    We have thought of ourselves, perhaps, as creatures moving upon this  earth, rather helpless, at the mercy of storm and hunger and our  enemies. We are to think of ourselves as immortals, dwelling in the  Light, encompassed and sustained by spiritual powers. The steady  effort to hold this thought will awaken dormant and unrealized  powers, which will unveil to us the nearness of the Eternal.    14. This becomes a firm resting-place, when followed long,  persistently, with earnestness.    We must seek spiritual life in conformity with the laws of spiritual life,  with earnestness, humility, gentle charity, which is an acknowledgment  of the One Soul within us all. Only through obedience to that shared  Life, through perpetual remembrance of our oneness with all Divine  Being, our nothingness apart from Divine Being, can we enter our  inheritance.    15. Ceasing from self-indulgence is conscious mastery over the thirst  for sensuous pleasure here or hereafter.    Rightly understood, the desire for sensation is the desire of being, the  distortion of the soul's eternal life. The lust of sensual stimulus and  excitation rests on the longing to feel one's life keenly, to gain the  sense of being really alive. This sense of true life comes only with the  coming of the soul, and the soul comes only in silence, after  self-indulgence has been courageously and loyally stilled, through  reverence before the coming soul.    16. The consummation of this is freedom from thirst for any mode of  psychical activity, through the establishment of the spiritual man.    In order to gain a true understanding of this teaching, study must be  supplemented by devoted practice, faith by works. The reading of the  words will not avail. There must be a real effort to stand as the Soul,  a real ceasing from self-indulgence. With this awakening of the  spiritual will, and purification, will come at once the growth of the  spiritual man and our awakening consciousness as the spiritual man;  and this, attained in even a small degree, will help us notably in our  contest. To him that hath, shall be given.    17. Meditation with an object follows these stages: first, exterior  examining, then interior judicial action, then joy, then realization of  individual being.    In the practice of meditation, a beginning may be made by fixing the  attention upon some external object, such as a sacred image or  picture, or a part of a book of devotion. In the second stage, one  passes from the outer object to an inner pondering upon its lessons.  The third stage is the inspiration, the heightening of the spiritual will,  which results from this pondering. The fourth stage is the realization  of one's spiritual being, as enkindled by this meditation.    18. After the exercise of the will has stilled the psychic activities,  meditation rests only on the fruit of former meditations.    In virtue of continued practice and effort, the need of an external  object on which to rest the meditation is outgrown. An interior state  of spiritual consciousness is reached, which is called \"the cloud of  things knowable\" (Book IV, 29).    19. Subjective consciousness arising from a natural cause is possessed  by those who have laid aside their bodies and been absorbed into  subjective nature.    Those who have died, entered the paradise between births, are in a  condition resembling meditation without an external object. But in the  fullness of time, the seeds of desire in them will spring up, and they  will be born again into this world.    20. For the others, there is spiritual consciousness, led up to by faith,  valour right mindfulness, one-pointedness, perception.    It is well to keep in mind these steps on the path to illumination: faith,  valour, right mindfulness, one-pointedness, perception. Not one can  be dispensed with; all must be won. First faith; and then from faith,  valour; from valour, right mindfulness; from right mindfulness, a  one-pointed aspiration toward the soul; from this, perception; and  finally, full vision as the soul.    21. Spiritual consciousness is nearest to those of keen, intense will.    The image used is the swift impetus of the torrent; the kingdom must  be taken by force. Firm will comes only through effort; effort is  inspired by faith. The great secret is this: it is not enough to have  intuitions; we must act on them; we must live them.    22. The will may be weak, or of middle strength, or intense.    Therefore there is a spiritual consciousness higher than this. For those  of weak will, there is this counsel: to be faithful in obedience, to live  the life, and thus to strengthen the will to more perfect obedience. The  will is not ours, but God's, and we come into it only through  obedience. As we enter into the spirit of God, we are permitted to  share the power of God.     Higher than the three stages of the way is the goal, the end of the  way.    23. Or spiritual consciousness may be gained by ardent service of the  Master.    If we think of our lives as tasks laid on us by the Master of Life, if we  look on all duties as parts of that Master's work, entrusted to us, and  forming our life-work; then, if we obey, promptly, loyally, sincerely,  we shall enter by degrees into the Master's life and share the Master's  power. Thus we shall be initiated into the spiritual will.    24. The Master is the spiritual man, who is free from hindrances,  bondage to works, and the fruition and seed of works.    The Soul of the Master, the Lord, is of the same nature as the soul in  us; but we still bear the burden of many evils, we are in bondage  through our former works, we are under the dominance of sorrow.  The Soul of the Master is free from sin and servitude and sorrow.    25. In the Master is the perfect seed of Omniscience.    The Soul of the Master is in essence one with the Oversoul, and  therefore partaker of the Oversoul's all-wisdom and all-power. All  spiritual attainment rests on this, and is possible because the soul and  the Oversoul are One.    26. He is the Teacher of all who have gone before, since he is not  limited by Time.    From the beginning, the Oversoul has been the Teacher of all souls,  which, by their entrance into the Oversoul, by realizing their oneness  with the Oversoul, have inherited the kingdom of the Light. For the  Oversoul is before Time, and Time, father of all else, is one of His  children.    27. His word is OM.    OM: the symbol of the Three in One, the three worlds in the Soul; the  three times, past, present, future, in Eternity; the three Divine Powers,  Creation, Preservation, Transformation, in the one Being; the three  essences, immortality, omniscience, joy, in the one Spirit. This is the  Word, the Symbol, of the Master and Lord, the perfected Spiritual  Man.    28. Let there be soundless repetition of OM and meditation thereon.    This has many meanings, in ascending degrees. There is, first, the  potency of the word itself, as of all words. Then there is the manifold  significance of the symbol, as suggested above. Lastly, there is the  spiritual realization of the high essences thus symbolized. Thus we rise  step by step to the Eternal.    29. Thence come the awakening of interior consciousness, and the  removal of barriers.    Here again faith must be supplemented by works, the life must be led  as well as studied, before the full meaning can be understood. The  awakening of spiritual consciousness can only be understood in  measure as it is entered. It can only be entered where the conditions  are present: purity of heart, and strong aspiration, and the resolute  conquest of each sin.    This, however, may easily be understood: that the recognition of the  three worlds as resting in the Soul leads us to realize ourselves and all  life as of the Soul; that, as we dwell, not in past, present or future, but  in the Eternal, we become more at one with the Eternal; that, as we  view all organization, preservation, mutation as the work of the Divine  One, we shall come more into harmony with the One, and thus remove  the barrier' in our path toward the Light.    In the second part of the first book, the problem of the emergence of  the spiritual man is further dealt with. We are led to the consideration  of the barriers to his emergence, of the overcoming of the barriers,  and of certain steps and stages in the ascent from the ordinary  consciousness of practical life, to the finer, deeper, radiant  consciousness of the spiritual man.    30. The barriers to interior consciousness, which drive the psychic  nature this way and that, are these: sickness, inertia, doubt,  lightmindedness, laziness, intemperance, false notions, inability to  reach a stage of meditation, or to hold it when reached.    We must remember that we are considering the spiritual man as  enwrapped and enmeshed by the psychic nature, the emotional and  mental powers; and as unable to come to clear consciousness, unable  to stand and see clearly, because of the"]]]
