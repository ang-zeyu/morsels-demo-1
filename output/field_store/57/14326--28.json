They had, indeed, learnt to give answers which were, for the part,  quite independent--thus supplying the most unexpected insight into  their actual thinking and feeling.    They also learnt the divisions of time, while every kind of experiment  was undertaken in order to test their reasoning capacity. All these  attempts and the majority of results were of such a nature that it  became quite impossible not to realize that further persistence along  the same lines of inquiry was bound to lead to a confirmation of the  assurances already given by Karl Krall with regard to his pupils'  \"scholarship.\" Many diverse opinions were heard, while the number of  serious adherents to the cause as well as that of its opponents  increased. Special instances to which objection had been taken on the  score of supposed \"influence,\" or of \"signalling,\" were carefully  investigated by Krall in order to clear up any implied doubts. For this  purpose a blind horse, by name \"Bertho,\" was taken in hand, proof being  thus provided to confute the mythical \"code of signals\" supposed to  exist between master and pupil. Other tests undertaken with Bertho were  equally successful; Krall was, in fact, always eager and willing to  submit every objection brought forward to investigation, evident though  it was, that his own vast experience amply sufficed to tip the balance  in his favour.    It would take us too long should we attempt to enter into any detailed  discussion on this point. Krall's book, \"Denkende Tiere\" (\"Thinking  Animals\")[1], may be recommended as the best source for investigation  for those desiring to know more on this subject.          [1] Published by Friedrich Engelmann, Leipzig.    It must in any case be admitted that the investigations undertaken by  Krall have shed a flood of light on the problem of the capacity for  thought latent in our higher animals, enabling him, as we have seen, to  lay down--within certain limits--in how far and in what way the  existence of this capability can be _proved_ where the horse is  concerned. Up to the commencement of the Great War these investigations  were continued, a number of different horses being used for the  purpose.    In the year 1912 I became acquainted with a new contribution towards  the question of animal psychology in the person of a Mannheim dog  called \"Rolf.\"    The manner in which Rolf's gifts revealed themselves was disclosed in  the columns of the \"Muenchner Nachrichten\" as follows:        \"OUR DOG ROLF        \"_By Frau Paula Moekel_ (nee _von Moers, in Mannheim_)        \"Anyone possessing an intelligent dog of his own will probably      occupy himself far more with it than he is wont to do with other      animals. This has been the case with our Rolf, a two-year-old      Airedale terrier, which has already attained to celebrity. It was      accident that led to our discovery of his talent for doing sums      correctly. Our children were sitting together at work on their      home-lessons, and one of my little girls--seized with a fit of      inattention--was unable to solve her very easy task, viz., 122 plus      2. At length, and after the child had stumbled repeatedly over this      simple answer, my patience was at an end, and I punished her. Rolf,      whose attachment to the children is quite touching, looked very      sad, and he gazed at Frieda with his expressive eyes as though he      was anxious to help her. Seeing this I exclaimed: 'Just see what      eyes Rolf is making!  It looks as if _he_ knew what you do not!' No      sooner had I said this than Rolf, who had been lying under my      writing-table, got up and came to my side. In surprise I asked him:      'Well, Rolf, do you know what two plus two amounts to?' Whereupon      the animal tapped my arm with his paw _four times_--we were all      speechless! After a little while we asked him again--'5 plus 5?'      Here, too, the correct answer was forthcoming, and thus on the      first day did we question him up to a hundred, and with equal      success. After that verbal instruction became my daily occupation      with the dog, in the same way that one might teach an intelligent      child, Rolf entering readily into everything, indeed, we seemed to      notice that his studies gave him pleasure. By degrees he became      able to solve his sums correctly in every form of arithmetic,      finally even getting as far as to extract two and three roots.        \"We soon noticed that Rolf could also recognize letters and      numerals. He read his own name easily, for when anyone began to      write it on the typewriter he instantly started wagging his tail      with delight. Our greatest desire now was to devise some means of      communication with him and I therefore began with the following      simple explanation:        \"'Rolf,' I said, 'if you could say yes and no, you would be able to      talk to us; now, look here! when you want to say _yes_, give us      your paw _twice_, and if _no_, then give it _three_ times,' and I      at once put this suggestion to an easy test, for I asked him if he      would like to be spanked--and he returned a decided _no_! Then I      asked him if he would like some cake, to which a prompt and joyful      affirmative was given. I saw therefore that Rolf understood me, and      upon this mutual basis I proceeded carefully to build. At length      his alphabet came into being--he having, with the exception of one      or two letters, put it together entirely by himself. It was      constructed thus: I would ask him, for instance, 'Rolf, how many      taps with your paw are you going to give me for _a_?' and he then      gave me a number which I carefully noted down. To my inexpressible      pleasure I found that Rolf never forgot the numbers he had given,      though I, to this day, must have my notes to hand whenever Rolf      wishes to tap out anything. It is also remarkable that on a nearer      investigation of his \"alphabet\" it becomes evident that the letters      Rolf requires least are made up of the highest numbers, whereas      those to which he has constant recourse have their equivalents      among the lower numbers. The letters q, v, x, Rolf never uses, as      though he wished to prove to me that they are entirely useless and      superfluous. Rolf can recognize any money that is shown him and      counts the flowers in a bunch according to their colours and      varieties. He can also differentiate the high and the deep tones on      any instrument, and he is even capable of telling the number of      tones struck in a chord. His memory is marvellous; he remembers      names and numbers over quite a period of time, once he has heard      them, and he is ready to do his tasks with any persons who are      sympathetic to him should he know them well enough. It is, however,      difficult to get him to work as long as anyone who is not      sympathetic remains in the room. What he raps out is, of course,      phonetically spelt--just according to how it sounds to him, and we      have not attempted to worry him with orthography! His own original      remarks are delightful.\"    The dog, Rolf, attained in the course of time to a higher level than  did the horses. This may probably be explained by the fact that dogs  are, as a rule, more continuously in the company of human beings, being  also due to their superior intelligence. Rolf's mode of procedure  consisted in a series of raps given with his fore-paws, similar to  those given by the horses with their hoofs; but Rolf used the same paw  for both decimals and units, so that we had from time to time to  inquire after every number rapped out--'Is it a decimal or a unit?'  Whereupon he would rap 'yes,' or 'no'--as the case might be. The  numbers were then written down and the answers thus obtained.    Rolf's feats of arithmetic, like those performed by the horses,  included finding the square root in the most difficult problems; yet it  was in the matter of spelling answers that he excelled. Indeed, he  seemed to command a particularly rich vocabulary, and applied the same  with the greatest accuracy and continuity, even in long answers. These  replies, when collected in their proper sequence should provide us with  a wealth of insight into an animal's life of feeling. Such a collection  is already extant, but has not yet been made public.    Many of the dog's answers, as well as innumerable debates about him  have been published in the \"Mitteilungen der Gesellschaft fuer  Tierpsychologie\"[2] (\"Communications of the Society for the Study of  Animal Psychology\"), while others may be found in the periodical  \"Animal Soul.\"[3]          [2] Published by the committee through the agency of Professor        Ziegler.          [3] Published by Emil Eisell, in Bonn.    Rolf has made frequent public appearances and been subjected to tests  of several hours' duration. These have taken place both in the presence  of his kind and gifted mistress and teacher, and also quite alone with  his examiners. On every occasion of his appearance notes have been  taken as to the procedures, and on one occasion these were even  attested by a Notary. At such times, indeed, suggestions were not  infrequently made which might be said to exceed every justifiable  limit; tests were carried out prior to which the whole family had to  vacate the house--carpets were taken up, in order to hunt for electric  wires; window-shutters were closed; cupboards and premises searched,  and sentinels posted--all this being tolerated by them with the utmost  good-humour! And in spite of all this upheaval, Rolf was almost without  exception ready with his replies! A fact that may well be set to his  credit, when we consider how sensitive and capricious animals are by  nature. Of his examiners, it may be said, that they covered themselves  with confusion.
