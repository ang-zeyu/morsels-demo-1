[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/2607"],[0,"Psmith, Journalist (#2)"],[1,"story  opens on his father's ranch in Wyoming. From there he had gone to a  local paper of the type whose Society column consists of such items  as \"Pawnee Jim Williams was to town yesterday with a bunch of other  cheap skates. We take this opportunity of once more informing Jim  that he is a liar and a skunk,\" and whose editor works with a  revolver on his desk and another in his hip-pocket. Graduating from  this, he had proceeded to a reporter's post on a daily paper in a  Kentucky town, where there were blood feuds and other Southern  devices for preventing life from becoming dull. All this time New  York, the magnet, had been tugging at him. All reporters dream of  reaching New York. At last, after four years on the Kentucky paper,  he had come East, minus the lobe of one ear and plus a long scar  that ran diagonally across his left shoulder, and had worked  without much success as a free-lance. He was tough and ready for  anything that might come his way, but these things are a great deal  a matter of luck. The cub-reporter cannot make a name for himself  unless he is favoured by fortune. Things had not come Billy  Windsor's way. His work had been confined to turning in reports of  fires and small street accidents, which the various papers to  which he supplied them cut down to a couple of inches.    Billy had been in a bad way when he had happened upon the  sub-editorship of _Cosy Moments_. He despised the work with all his  heart, and the salary was infinitesimal. But it was regular, and  for a while Billy felt that a regular salary was the greatest thing  on earth. But he still dreamed of winning through to a post on one  of the big New York dailies, where there was something doing and a  man would have a chance of showing what was in him.    The unfortunate thing, however, was that _Cosy Moments_ took up his  time so completely. He had no chance of attracting the notice of  big editors by his present work, and he had no leisure for doing  any other.    All of which may go to explain why his normal aspect was that of a  caged eagle.    To him, brooding over the outpourings of Luella Granville Waterman,  there entered Pugsy Maloney, the office-boy, bearing a struggling  cat.    \"Say!\" said Pugsy.    He was a nonchalant youth, with a freckled, mask-like face, the  expression of which never varied. He appeared unconscious of the  cat. Its existence did not seem to occur to him.    \"Well?\" said Billy, looking up. \"Hello, what have you got there?\"    Master Maloney eyed the cat, as if he were seeing it for the first  time.    \"It's a kitty what I got in de street,\" he said.    \"Don't hurt the poor brute. Put her down.\"    Master Maloney obediently dropped the cat, which sprang nimbly on  to an upper shelf of the book-case.    \"I wasn't hoitin' her,\" he said, without emotion. \"Dere was two  fellers in de street sickin' a dawg on to her. An' I comes up an'  says, 'G'wan! What do youse t'ink you're doin', fussin' de poor  dumb animal?' An' one of de guys, he says, 'G'wan! Who do youse  t'ink youse is?' An' I says, 'I'm de guy what's goin' to swat youse  one on de coco if youse don't quit fussin' de poor dumb animal.' So  wit dat he makes a break at swattin' me one, but I swats him one,  an' I swats de odder feller one, an' den I swats dem bote some  more, an' I gets de kitty, an' I brings her in here, cos I t'inks  maybe youse'll look after her.\"    And having finished this Homeric narrative, Master Maloney fixed an  expressionless eye on the ceiling, and was silent.    Billy Windsor, like most men of the plains, combined the toughest  of muscle with the softest of hearts. He was always ready at any  moment to become the champion of the oppressed on the slightest  provocation. His alliance with Pugsy Maloney had begun on the  occasion when he had rescued that youth from the clutches of a  large negro, who, probably from the soundest of motives, was  endeavouring to slay him. Billy had not inquired into the rights  and wrongs of the matter: he had merely sailed in and rescued the  office-boy. And Pugsy, though he had made no verbal comment on the  affair, had shown in many ways that he was not ungrateful.    \"Bully for you, Pugsy!\" he cried. \"You're a little sport. Here\"--he  produced a dollar-bill--\"go out and get some milk for the  poor brute. She's probably starving. Keep the change.\"    \"Sure thing,\" assented Master Maloney. He strolled slowly out,  while Billy Windsor, mounting a chair, proceeded to chirrup and  snap his fingers in the effort to establish the foundations of an  _entente cordiale_ with the rescued cat.    By the time that Pugsy returned, carrying a five-cent bottle of  milk, the animal had vacated the book-shelf, and was sitting on the  table, washing her face. The milk having been poured into the lid  of a tobacco-tin, in lieu of a saucer, she suspended her operations  and adjourned for refreshments. Billy, business being business,  turned again to Luella Granville Waterman, but Pugsy, having no  immediate duties on hand, concentrated himself on the cat.    \"Say!\" he said.    \"Well?\"    \"Dat kitty.\"    \"What about her?\"    \"Pipe de leather collar she's wearing.\"    Billy had noticed earlier in the proceedings that a narrow leather  collar encircled the cat's neck. He had not paid any particular  attention to it. \"What about it?\" he said.    \"Guess I know where dat kitty belongs. Dey all have dose collars. I  guess she's one of Bat Jarvis's kitties. He's got a lot of dem for  fair, and every one wit one of dem collars round deir neck.\"    \"Who's Bat Jarvis? Do you mean the gang-leader?\"    \"Sure. He's a cousin of mine,\" said Master Maloney with pride.    \"Is he?\" said Billy. \"Nice sort of fellow to have in the family. So  you think that's his cat?\"    \"Sure. He's got twenty-t'ree of dem, and dey all has dose collars.\"    \"Are you on speaking terms with the gentleman?\"    \"Huh?\"    \"Do you know Bat Jarvis to speak to?\"    \"Sure. He's me cousin.\"    \"Well, tell him I've got the cat, and that if he wants it he'd  better come round to my place. You know where I live?\"    \"Sure.\"    \"Fancy you being a cousin of Bat's, Pugsy. Why did you never tell  us? Are you going to join the gang some day?\"    \"Nope. Nothin' doin'. I'm goin' to be a cow-boy.\"    \"Good for you. Well, you tell him when you see him. And now, my  lad, out you get, because if I'm interrupted any more I shan't get  through to-night.\"    \"Sure,\" said Master Maloney, retiring.    \"Oh, and Pugsy . . .\"    \"Huh?\"    \"Go out and get a good big basket. I shall want one to carry this  animal home in.\"    \"Sure,\" said Master Maloney.        CHAPTER III    AT \"THE GARDENIA\"    \"It would ill beseem me, Comrade Jackson,\" said Psmith,  thoughtfully sipping his coffee, \"to run down the metropolis of a  great and friendly nation, but candour compels me to state that New  York is in some respects a singularly blighted town.\"    \"What's the matter with it?\" asked Mike.    \"Too decorous, Comrade Jackson. I came over here principally, it is  true, to be at your side, should you be in any way persecuted by  scoundrels. But at the same time I confess that at the back of my  mind there lurked a hope that stirring adventures might come my  way. I had heard so much of the place. Report had it that an  earnest seeker after amusement might have a tolerably spacious rag  in this modern Byzantium. I thought that a few weeks here might  restore that keen edge to my nervous system which the languor of  the past term had in a measure blunted. I wished my visit to be a  tonic rather than a sedative. I anticipated that on my return the  cry would go round Cambridge, 'Psmith has been to New York. He is  full of oats. For he on honey-dew hath fed, and drunk the milk of  Paradise. He is hot stuff. Rah!' But what do we find?\"    He paused, and lit a cigarette.    \"What do we find?\" he asked again.    \"I don't know,\" said Mike. \"What?\"    \"A very judicious query, Comrade Jackson. What, indeed? We find a  town very like London. A quiet, self-respecting town, admirable to  the apostle of social reform, but disappointing to one who, like  myself, arrives with a brush and a little bucket of red paint, all  eager for a treat. I have been here a week, and I have not seen a  single citizen clubbed by a policeman. No negroes dance cake-walks  in the street. No cow-boy has let off his revolver at random in  Broadway. The cables flash the message across the ocean, 'Psmith is  losing his illusions.'\"    Mike had come to America with a team of the M.C.C. which was  touring the cricket-playing section of the United States. Psmith  had accompanied him in a private capacity. It was the end of their  first year at Cambridge, and Mike, with a century against Oxford to  his credit, had been one of the first to be invited to join the  tour. Psmith, who had played cricket in a rather desultory way at  the University, had not risen to these heights. He had merely taken  the opportunity of Mike's visit to the other side to accompany him.  Cambridge had proved pleasant to Psmith, but a trifle quiet. He  had welcomed the chance of getting a change of scene.    So far the visit had failed to satisfy him. Mike, whose tastes in  pleasure were simple, was delighted with everything. The cricket so  far had been rather of the picnic order, but it was very pleasant;  and there was no limit to the hospitality with which the visitors  were treated. It was this more than anything which had caused  Psmith's grave disapproval of things American. He was not a member  of the team, so that the advantages of the hospitality did not  reach him. He had all the disadvantages. He saw far too little of  Mike. When he wished to consult his confidential secretary and  adviser on some aspect of Life, that invaluable official was  generally absent at dinner with the rest of the team. To-night was  one of the rare occasions when Mike could get away. Psmith was  becoming bored.

DISTRIBUTION OF THE KNOWN BREEDING BIRDS OF COAHUILA    Topography and Climate    Coahuila lies in the broad northern end of Mexico, immediately east of  the center of the continental mass. The mountains of Coahuila, which  are part of the Rocky Mountain-Sierra Madre Oriental Axis, extend in a  north-south direction and divide the lower lands into two areas, a  larger one, a part of the Central Plateau, to the westward and a  smaller one, a part of the Gulf Coastal Plain, to the northeastward.  Most of the mountains of Coahuila do not exceed 6000 feet in elevation.  A few peaks such as in the Sierra del Carmen, Sierra del Pino, Sierra  de la Madera, Sierra Encarnacion, and Sierra de Guadalupe, are more  than 9000 feet high, and some more than 10,000 feet in elevation occur  near the southeastern border of the State in the Sierra Madre Oriental.  The Gulf Coastal Plain of northeastern Coahuila ranges from 700 feet to  1800 feet. The desert plains of the Mesa del Norte to the west of the  Sierra Madre Oriental Axis are higher, more rugged, and more dissected  than those of the Coastal Plain and are marked by scattered desert  ranges, buttes, low hills, and knobs.    Most of Coahuila is arid. Rainfall is moderate on the Coastal Plain and  is low west of the central mountains. Baker (1956:128-132) and Muller  (1947:35-38) give good summary discussions of the topography and  climate of Coahuila, and the reader is referred to these for further  details.      Biotic Communities    Baker (1956:132) stated that \"the biotic communities of Coahuila might  be divided in accordance with the three physiographic areas of the  State: the Gulf Coastal Plain, the mountains, and the desert plains of  the Mesa del Norte.\" Goldman and Moore (1945:348-349) listed three  biotic provinces in Coahuila: the Chihuahua-Zacatecas Biotic Province,  in the western half of the State; the Tamaulipas Biotic Province, in  the northeastern part of the State; and the Sierra Madre Oriental  Biotic Province, in the southeastern part of the State. Merriam (1898)  noted that definable portions of the Lower Sonoran Life-zone, the Upper  Sonoran Life-zone, the Transition Life-zone, and the Canadian Life-zone  can be distinguished in Coahuila. In my study of the distribution of  the avifauna of Coahuila, I found that the three biotic provinces  listed by Goldman and Moore (_op. cit._) as major headings and  Merriam's life-zones as supplements are the most satisfactory  divisions.    _The Tamaulipas Biotic Province._--This province consists of lowland  plains and a few isolated ranges of low mountains. The average rainfall  is 23 inches (Baker, 1956:130), considerably more than the 10 inches  falling in the western part of the State. In the northeastern section  of the State, the moderate amount of rain, mesic vegetation, and close  proximity to the eastern migration pathway importantly influence the  types of birds found.    In Coahuila, the Coastal Plain and the Rio Grande Plain lie in the path  of the northernmost trade winds; they account for the more humid  eastern slopes of the mountains of the northeastern part of the State  (Muller, 1947:38). Nevertheless, the northeastern section of the State  is semi-arid and can be placed in the Lower Sonoran Life-zone. The  vegetation consists mainly of thorny shrubs and small trees with a  liberal admixture of yuccas, agaves, and cacti, and closely resembles  that of southern Texas, northern Nuevo Leon, and northern Tamaulipas  (Goldman and Moore, 1945:354).    Migrant birds from the eastern flyway and less commonly migrants from  western North America pass through northeastern Coahuila. The following  breeding birds seem to be associated with this province: Harris' Hawk,  Bobwhite (_C. v. texanus_), Scaled Quail (_C. s. castanogastris_),  Yellow-billed Cuckoo, Groove-billed Ani, Green Kingfisher,  Golden-fronted Woodpecker, Hairy Woodpecker (_D. v. intermedius_),  Ladder-backed Woodpecker (_D. s. symplectus_), Vermilion Flycatcher  (_P. r. mexicanus_), Cave Swallow, Gray-breasted Martin, Black-crested  Titmouse (_P. a. atricristatus_), Carolina Wren, Long-billed Thrasher,  Curve-billed Thrasher (_T. c. oberholseri_), Blue-gray Gnatcatcher (_P.  c. caerulea_), Hutton's Vireo (_V. h. carolinae_), Bell's Vireo (_V. b.  medius_), Yellow-throated Vireo, Red-eyed Vireo, Summer Tanager (_P. r.  rubra_), Olive Sparrow, Cassin's Sparrow, and Black-throated Sparrow  (_A. b. bilineata_).    _The Sierra Madre Oriental Biotic Province._--Southeastern Coahuila is  in this province that includes mountains in southern Nuevo Leon,  southwestern Tamaulipas, and eastern San Luis Potosi. Areas classifiable  as Canadian, Transition, Upper Sonoran, and Lower Sonoran in life-zone  are found in this province. This region of Coahuila receives the  highest rainfall; this is evidenced by the luxuriant growth of boreal  plants living in the higher places there (Baker, 1956:131). Spruce,  pine, and aspen occur at higher elevations and oaks, thorny shrubs, and  grasslands are present lower down.    Birds of central or southern Mexico reach the southern part of  Coahuila; the Thick-billed Parrot, Hooded Yellowthroat, and  Rufous-capped Atlapetes are examples. A boreal forest on the higher  slopes of the mountains of southeastern Coahuila is suitable for  certain northern birds such as Goshawks, Pine Siskins, and Brown  Creepers. Some species of birds ordinarily associated with western  North America are present in Coahuila only in its southeastern part;  striking examples of disjunction in range thus occur. Probably sometime  in the past these birds were distributed throughout most of Coahuila.  When this area became arid, these species disappeared from all of  Coahuila except from the high mountains in the southeastern part. For  example, Steller's Jay and the Scrub Jay are absent in the Sierra del  Carmen of northwestern Coahuila but do occur in southeastern Coahuila.    Migrants of the eastern flyway as well as migrants associated with  western North America pass through this section of Coahuila. The  following breeding birds are associated with this province: Goshawk,  Band-tailed Pigeon, Thick-billed Parrot, Golden-fronted Woodpecker,  Ladder-backed Woodpecker (_D. s. giraudi_), Pine Flycatcher,  Buff-breasted Flycatcher, Vermilion Flycatcher (_P. r. mexicanus_),  Steller's Jay, Scrub Jay, Mexican Chickadee, Black-crested Titmouse  (_P. a. atricristatus_), Cactus Wren (_C. b. guttatus_), Robin,  Blue-gray Gnatcatcher (_P. c. amoenissima_), Hutton's Vireo (_V. h.  stephensi_), Bell's Vireo (_V. b. medius_), Hartlaub's Warbler, Summer  Tanager (_P. r. cooperi_), Pine Siskin, Rufous-capped Atlaptes, and  Black-throated Sparrow (_A. b. grisea_).    _The Chihuahua-Zacatecas Biotic Province._--This province in Coahuila  covers the arid, interior, western desert area; it consists of rolling  plains with mountains that rise islandlike above the general surface.  Some of the mountains, such as in the Sierra del Carmen and the Sierra  del Pino, are more than 9000 feet high. The major part of this biotic  area lies within the Lower Sonoran Life-zone. Areas of the Transition  and Canadian life-zones are present on some of the higher mountains;  their discontinuity results in a discontinuous distribution of the  conifer-dependent avifauna.    The large desert restricts the movement of birds considerably. Major  results of this include isolation of certain populations and absence of  others in the boreal islands. For example, Miller (1955a:157) noted  that the \"dispersal of conifer-belt birds to and from the Sierra del  Carmen, although not as difficult as to well separated islands [such as  off the coast of Baja California], is nevertheless a formidable matter  to accomplish across the great deserts of Texas, Chihuahua, and  Coahuila.\" Miller (_loc. cit._) noted also that the avifauna of the  Sierra del Carmen, due to its insularity, is unbalanced and stated that  \"as a consequence of unbalance, species that are present show ecologic  extension and unusual numerical relations.\" At least in this type of  environment, an extension or expansion of the ecologic habits of the  related types takes place when some species are absent.    This isolation influences local variation among some of the birds found  in Coahuila. Niches elsewhere usually occupied by certain species,  absent here, are occupied by other species. These other species thus  enjoy an ecologic freedom and can expand their niches in the absence  of related types of similar ecologic scope. For example, Miller  (1955a:158-159) reported that Hairy Woodpeckers occurred only casually  in the Sierra del Carmen and that the Ladder-backed Woodpecker has  spread out and seems to occupy the niche or niches usually characteristic  of the Hairy Woodpecker. Changes usually thought of as of subspecific  character seem to be taking place between the Ladder-backed Woodpeckers  of the Sierra del Carmen and of other areas, possibly because the  Ladder-backed Woodpecker in the Sierra del Carmen is extending its  ecologic sphere more than in areas where the Hairy Woodpecker exists.
