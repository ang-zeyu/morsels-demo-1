Both in England and  in Scotland he had vanquished his enemies, and had punished them with  a severity which had indeed excited their bitterest hatred, but had, at  the same time, effectually quelled their courage. The Whig party seemed  extinct. The name of Whig was never used except as a term of reproach.  The Parliament was devoted to the King; and it was in his power to keep  that Parliament to the end of his reign. The Church was louder than  ever in professions of attachment to him, and had, during the late  insurrection, acted up to those professions. The Judges were his tools;  and if they ceased to be so, it was in his power to remove them. The  corporations were filled with his creatures. His revenues far exceeded  those of his predecessors. His pride rose high. He was not the same  man who, a few months before, in doubt whether his throne might not  be overturned in a hour, had implored foreign help with unkingly  supplications, and had accepted it with tears of gratitude. Visions  of dominion and glory rose before him. He already saw himself, in  imagination, the umpire of Europe, the champion of many states oppressed  by one too powerful monarchy. So early as the month of June he had  assured the United Provinces that, as soon as the affairs of England  were settled, he would show the world how little he feared France. In  conformity with these assurances, he, within a month after the battle of  Sedgemoor, concluded with the States General a defensive treaty, framed  in the very spirit of the Triple League. It was regarded, both at  the Hague and at Versailles, as a most significant circumstance that  Halifax, who was the constant and mortal enemy of French ascendency, and  who had scarcely ever before been consulted on any grave affair since  the beginning of the reign, took the lead on this occasion, and seemed  to have the royal ear. It was a circumstance not less significant that  no previous communication was made to Barillon. Both he and his master  were taken by surprise. Lewis was much troubled, and expressed great,  and not unreasonable, anxiety as to the ulterior designs of the prince  who had lately been his pensioner and vassal. There were strong rumours  that William of Orange was busied in organizing a great confederacy,  which was to include both branches of the House of Austria, the United  Provinces, the kingdom of Sweden, and the electorate of Brandenburg.  It now seemed that this confederacy would have at its head the King and  Parliament of England.    In fact, negotiations tending to such a result were actually opened.  Spain proposed to form a close alliance with James; and he listened to  the proposition with favour, though it was evident that such an alliance  would be little less than a declaration of war against France. But  he postponed his final decision till after the Parliament should have  reassembled. The fate of Christendom depended on the temper in which he  might then find the Commons. If they were disposed to acquiesce in his  plans of domestic government, there would be nothing to prevent him from  interfering with vigour and authority in the great dispute which must  soon be brought to an issue on the Continent. If they were refractory,  he must relinquish all thought of arbitrating between contending  nations, must again implore French assistance, must again submit to  French dictation, must sink into a potentate of the third or fourth  class, and must indemnify himself for the contempt with which he would  be regarded abroad by triumphs over law and public opinion at home. [1]    It seemed, indeed, that it would not be easy for him to demand more than  the Commons were disposed to give. Already they had abundantly proved  that they were desirous to maintain his prerogatives unimpaired, and  that they were by no means extreme to mark his encroachments on the  rights of the people."]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/244"],[0,"A Study in Scarlet (#2)"],[1,"bout, which bristled with retorts,  test-tubes, and little Bunsen lamps, with their blue flickering flames.  There was only one student in the room, who was bending over a distant  table absorbed in his work. At the sound of our steps he glanced round  and sprang to his feet with a cry of pleasure. \"I've found it! I've  found it,\" he shouted to my companion, running towards us with a  test-tube in his hand. \"I have found a re-agent which is precipitated  by hoemoglobin, [4] and by nothing else.\" Had he discovered a gold mine,  greater delight could not have shone upon his features.    \"Dr. Watson, Mr. Sherlock Holmes,\" said Stamford, introducing us.    \"How are you?\" he said cordially, gripping my hand with a strength  for which I should hardly have given him credit. \"You have been in  Afghanistan, I perceive.\"    \"How on earth did you know that?\" I asked in astonishment.    \"Never mind,\" said he, chuckling to himself. \"The question now is about  hoemoglobin. No doubt you see the significance of this discovery of  mine?\"    \"It is interesting, chemically, no doubt,\" I answered, \"but  practically----\"    \"Why, man, it is the most practical medico-legal discovery for years.  Don't you see that it gives us an infallible test for blood stains. Come  over here now!\" He seized me by the coat-sleeve in his eagerness, and  drew me over to the table at which he had been working. \"Let us have  some fresh blood,\" he said, digging a long bodkin into his finger, and  drawing off the resulting drop of blood in a chemical pipette. \"Now, I  add this small quantity of blood to a litre of water. You perceive that  the resulting mixture has the appearance of pure water. The proportion  of blood cannot be more than one in a million. I have no doubt, however,  that we shall be able to obtain the characteristic reaction.\" As he  spoke, he threw into the vessel a few white crystals, and then added  some drops of a transparent fluid. In an instant the contents assumed a  dull mahogany colour, and a brownish dust was precipitated to the bottom  of the glass jar.    \"Ha! ha!\" he cried, clapping his hands, and looking as delighted as a  child with a new toy. \"What do you think of that?\"    \"It seems to be a very delicate test,\" I remarked.    \"Beautiful! beautiful! The old Guiacum test was very clumsy and  uncertain. So is the microscopic examination for blood corpuscles. The  latter is valueless if the stains are a few hours old. Now, this appears  to act as well whether the blood is old or new. Had this test been  invented, there are hundreds of men now walking the earth who would long  ago have paid the penalty of their crimes.\"    \"Indeed!\" I murmured.    \"Criminal cases are continually hinging upon that one point. A man is  suspected of a crime months perhaps after it has been committed. His  linen or clothes are examined, and brownish stains discovered upon them.  Are they blood stains, or mud stains, or rust stains, or fruit stains,  or what are they? That is a question which has puzzled many an expert,  and why? Because there was no reliable test. Now we have the Sherlock  Holmes' test, and there will no longer be any difficulty.\"    His eyes fairly glittered as he spoke, and he put his hand over his  heart and bowed as if to some applauding crowd conjured up by his  imagination.    \"You are to be congratulated,\" I remarked, considerably surprised at his  enthusiasm.    \"There was the case of Von Bischoff at Frankfort last year. He would  certainly have been hung had this test been in existence. Then there was  Mason of Bradford, and the notorious Muller, and Lefevre of Montpellier,  and Samson of New Orleans. I could name a score of cases in which it  would have been decisive.\"    \"You seem to be a walking calendar of crime,\" said Stamford with a  laugh. \"You might start a paper on those lines. Call it the 'Police News  of the Past.'\"    \"Very interesting reading it might be made, too,\" remarked Sherlock  Holmes, sticking a small piece of plaster over the prick on his finger.  \"I have to be careful,\" he continued, turning to me with a smile, \"for I  dabble with poisons a good deal.\" He held out his hand as he spoke, and  I noticed that it was all mottled over with similar pieces of plaster,  and discoloured with strong acids.    \"We came here on business,\" said Stamford, sitting down on a high  three-legged stool, and pushing another one in my direction with  his foot. \"My friend here wants to take diggings, and as you were  complaining that you could get no one to go halves with you, I thought  that I had better bring you together.\"    Sherlock Holmes seemed delighted at the idea of sharing his rooms with  me. \"I have my eye on a suite in Baker Street,\" he said, \"which would  suit us down to the ground. You don't mind the smell of strong tobacco,  I hope?\"    \"I always smoke 'ship's' myself,\" I answered.    \"That's good enough. I generally have chemicals about, and occasionally  do experiments. Would that annoy you?\"    \"By no means.\"    \"Let me see--what are my other shortcomings. I get in the dumps at  times, and don't open my mouth for days on end. You must not think I am  sulky when I do that. Just let me alone, and I'll soon be right. What  have you to confess now? It's just as well for two fellows to know the  worst of one another before they begin to live together.\"    I laughed at this cross-examination. \"I keep a bull pup,\" I said, \"and  I object to rows because my nerves are shaken, and I get up at all sorts  of ungodly hours, and I am extremely lazy. I have another set of vices  when I'm well, but those are the principal ones at present.\"    \"Do you include violin-playing in your category of rows?\" he asked,  anxiously.    \"It depends on the player,\" I answered. \"A well-played violin is a treat  for the gods--a badly-played one----\"    \"Oh, that's all right,\" he cried, with a merry laugh. \"I think we may  consider the thing as settled--that is, if the rooms are agreeable to  you.\"    \"When shall we see them?\"    \"Call for me here at noon to-morrow, and we'll go together and settle  everything,\" he answered.    \"All right--noon exactly,\" said I, shaking his hand.    We left him working among his chemicals, and we walked together towards  my hotel.    \"By the way,\" I asked suddenly, stopping and turning upon Stamford, \"how  the deuce did he know that I had come from Afghanistan?\"    My companion smiled an enigmatical smile. \"That's just his little  peculiarity,\" he said. \"A good many people have wanted to know how he  finds things out.\"    \"Oh! a mystery is it?\" I cried, rubbing my hands. \"This is very piquant.  I am much obliged to you for bringing us together. 'The proper study of  mankind is man,' you know.\"    \"You must study him, then,\" Stamford said, as he bade me good-bye.  \"You'll find him a knotty problem, though. I'll wager he learns more  about you than you about him. Good-bye.\"    \"Good-bye,\" I answered, and strolled on to my hotel, considerably  interested in my new acquaintance.          CHAPTER II. THE SCIENCE OF DEDUCTION.      WE met next day as he had arranged, and inspected the rooms at No. 221B,  [5] Baker Street, of which he had spoken at our meeting. They  consisted of a couple of comfortable bed-rooms and a single large  airy sitting-room, cheerfully furnished, and illuminated by two broad  windows. So desirable in every way were the apartments, and so moderate  did the terms seem when divided between us, that the bargain was  concluded upon the spot, and we at once entered into possession.  That very evening I moved my things round from the hotel, and on the  following morning Sherlock Holmes followed me with several boxes and  portmanteaus. For a day or two we were busily employed in unpacking and  laying out our property to the best advantage. That done, we  gradually began to settle down and to accommodate ourselves to our new  surroundings.    Holmes was certainly not a difficult man to live with. He was quiet  in his ways, and his habits were regular. It was rare for him to be  up after ten at night, and he had invariably breakfasted and gone out  before I rose in the morning. Sometimes he spent his day at the chemical  laboratory, sometimes in the dissecting-rooms, and occasionally in long  walks, which appeared to take him into the lowest portions of the City.  Nothing could exceed his energy when the working fit was upon him; but  now and again a reaction would seize him, and for days on end he would  lie upon the sofa in the sitting-room, hardly uttering a word or moving  a muscle from morning to night. On these occasions I have noticed such  a dreamy, vacant expression in his eyes, that I might have suspected him  of being addicted to the use of some narcotic, had not the temperance  and cleanliness of his whole life forbidden such a notion.    As the weeks went by, my interest in him and my curiosity as to his  aims in life, gradually deepened and increased. His very person and  appearance were such as to strike the attention of the most casual  observer. In height he was rather over six feet, and so excessively  lean that he seemed to be considerably taller. His eyes were sharp and  piercing, save during those intervals of torpor to which I have alluded;  and his thin, hawk-like nose gave his whole expression an air of  alertness and decision. His chin, too, had the prominence and squareness  which mark the man of determination. His hands were invariably  blotted with ink and stained with chemicals, yet he was possessed of  extraordinary delicacy of touch, as I frequently had occasion to observe  when I watched him manipulating his fragile philosophical instruments.    The reader may set me down as a hopeless busybody, when I confess how  much this man stimulated my curiosity, and how often I endeavoured  to break through the reticence which he showed on all that concerned  himself. Before pronouncing judgment, however, be it remembered, how  objectless was my life, and how little "]]]
