I yelped, \"Godamighty!\" 'Scuse me, Rev'rend, but I was so blame upset  that's just what I did say, \"Godamighty, man, you mean there's a baby in  that there dingfol contraption?\" He just moaned so after spreadin' my  coat around the man a little bit I just plunged in that there river  again.    Rev'rend, I heard tell once about some tomfool idiot going over Niagary  in a barrel, and I tell you it was like that when I tried crossin' that  freshet to reach the contraption.    I went under and down, and was whacked by floating sticks and whirled  around in the freshet. But somehow, I d'no how except by the pure grace  of God, I got across that raging torrent and clumb up to where the crazy  dingfol machine was sitting.    Ship, he'd called it. But that were no ship, Rev'rend, it was some  flying dragon kind of thing. It was a real scarey lookin' thing but I  clumb up to the little door and hauled myself inside it. And, sure  enough, there was other people in the cabin, only they was all dead.    There was a lady and a man and some kind of an animal looked like a  bobcat only smaller, with a funny-shaped rooster-comb thing on its head.  They all--even the cat-thing--was wearing those shiny, stretchy clo'es.  And they all was so battered and smashed I didn't even bother to hunt  for their heartbeats. I could see by a look they was dead as a doornail.    Then I heard a funny little whimper, like a kitten, and in a funny,  rubber-cushioned thing there's a little boy baby, looked about six  months old. He was howling lusty enough, and when I lifted him out of  the cradle kind of thing, I saw why. That boy baby, he was wet, and his  little arm was twisted under him. That there flying contraption must  have smashed down awful hard, but that rubber hammock was so soft and  cushiony all it did to him was jolt him good.    I looked around but I couldn't find anything to wrap him in. And the  baby didn't have a stitch on him except a sort of spongy paper diaper,  wet as sin. So I finally lifted up the lady, who had a long cape thing  around her, and I took the cape off her real gentle. I knew she was dead  and she wouldn't be needin' it, and that boy baby would catch his death  if I took him out bare-naked like that. She was probably the baby's Ma;  a right pretty woman she was but smashed up something shameful.    So anyhow, to make a long story short, I got that baby boy back across  that Niagary falls somehow, and laid him down by his Pa. The man opened  his eyes kind, and said in a choky voice, \"Take care--baby.\"    I told him I would, and said I'd try to get him up to the house where  Marthy could doctor him. The man told me not to bother. \"I dying,\" he  says. \"We come from planet--star up there--crash here--\" His voice  trailed off into a language I couldn't understand, and he looked like he  was praying.    I bent over him and held his head on my knees real easy, and I said,  \"Don't worry, mister, I'll take care of your little fellow until your  folks come after him. Before God I will.\"    So the man closed his eyes and I said, _Our Father which art in Heaven_,  and when I got through he was dead.    I got him up on Kate, but he was cruel heavy for all he was such a tall  skinny fellow. Then I wrapped that there baby up in the cape thing and  took him home and give him to Marthy. And the next day I buried the  fellow in the south medder and next meetin' day we had the baby baptized  Matthew Daniel Emmett, and brung him up just like our own kids. That's  all.    _All? Mr. Emmett, didn't you ever find out where that ship really came  from?_    Why, Rev'rend, he said it come from a star. Dying men don't lie, you  know that. I asked the Teacher about them planets he mentioned and she  says that on one of the planets--can't rightly remember the name, March  or Mark or something like that--she says some big scientist feller with  a telescope saw canals on that planet, and they'd hev to be pretty near  as big as this-here Erie canal to see them so far off. And if they could  build canals on that planet I d'no why they couldn't build a flying  machine.    I went back the next day when the water was down a little, to see if I  couldn't get the rest of them folks and bury them, but the flying  machine had broke up and washed down the crick.    Marthy's still got the cape thing. She's a powerful saving woman. We  never did tell Matt, though. Might make him feel funny to think he  didn't really b'long to us.    _But--but--Mr. Emmett, didn't anybody ask questions about the  baby--where you got it?_    Well, now, I'll 'low they was curious, because Marthy hadn't been in  the family way and they knew it. But up here folks minds their own  business pretty well, and I jest let them wonder. I told Liza Grace I'd  found her new little brother in the back pasture, and o'course it was  the truth. When Liza Grace growed up she thought it was jest one of  those yarns old folks tell the little shavers.    _And has Matthew ever shown any differences from the other children that  you could see?_    Well, Rev'rend, not so's you could notice it. He's powerful smart, but  his real Pa and Ma must have been right smart too to build a flying  contraption that could come so far.    O'course, when he were about twelve years old he started reading folks'  minds, which didn't seem exactly right. He'd tell Marthy what I was  thinkin' and things like that. He was just at the pesky age. Liza Grace  and Minnie were both a-courtin' then, and he'd drive their boy friends  crazy telling them what Liza Grace and Minnie were a-thinking and tease  the gals by telling them what the boys were thinking about.    There weren't no harm in the boy, though, it was all teasing. But it  just weren't decent, somehow. So I tuk him out behind the woodshed and  give his britches a good dusting just to remind him that that kind of  thing weren't polite nohow. And Rev'rend Doane, he ain't never done it  sence.          Transcriber's Note:        This etext was produced from _Fantastic Universe_ May 1954.

It was  already in existence, the fruit of the work of certain  divines, which is spoken of in the preamble as concluded.  The book was not authorized or brought  into use by the Act. It was already in use, though  by no means in general use. This fact is illustrated  by the title of the Book itself, which sets forth the  contents with some audacity as being _After the Use  of the Church of England_. I am not here concerned  with the question--the very difficult question--of the  authority by which the Book came into existence and  into use. I am only concerned to show that the  authority in question was not the authority of Parliament.  The Act of Uniformity did not authorize the  use of the forms contained in the Prayer-book, for  that was needless; it forbade the use of any other  forms. It did not bring the Book into use, for that  was already done; it brought it into exclusive use,  which is not the same thing. It was not an enabling  Act, but a prohibitory Act. It did not propose or  command a reform; it found the reform already  made. It did not purport to set forth an order of  divine service; it found an order already in existence,  and forbade the use of any other. It was frankly  a persecuting law, and as such may fairly be compared  with the statute of the Six Articles. In that case the  doctrinal articles, as in this case the forms of worship,  were not invented or introduced by authority of  Parliament; the statute in each case merely imposed  a penalty on all who impugned or refused them. The  purpose of the Act was to secure by temporal penalties  an uniformity which the ecclesiastical authorities of  the time were unable to compass, and which it is  possible they did not greatly desire.    I shall not deal with the fortunes of the Prayerbook  under the Act, or with the violent changes  effected apart from the Act during the two or three  years that followed. One incident, however, calls for  notice. There were in London at this time numerous  refugees of the reformed persuasion, chiefly from the  Belgic provinces. These men organized themselves  into a congregation, worshipping after their own  rites. The King granted them the disused church  of the Austin Friars. Here they came under the  notice of the Lord Mayor, and of Ridley, the bishop  of London, who attempted to enforce the Act of  Uniformity against them. The matter was debated  with much acrimony, and the Council intervened with  a royal letter forbidding any interference with the  congregation. So far as I know, this was the only  act of toleration perpetrated during the reign of  Edward VI. [11]    The second Act of Uniformity need not detain  us. The Prayer-book had been elaborately revised,  still without the initiative or concurrence of Parliament.  The statute of 1549, however, hindered the use of the  revised Book; to use it was a penal offence. It was  therefore necessary to put the revised Book in the  legal position occupied by the unrevised Book. This  was done by the Act of the fifth and sixth of  Edward VI., in which opportunity was taken to add  some pious reflections, which may breathe the spirit  of Northumberland and the Council, and some further  penalties, which may seem to us more in accordance  with the spirit of the time. There was a clause  cautiously relaxing the bonds in which the ecclesiastical  jurisdiction was held, in order that it might  come to the assistance of the champions of Uniformity.  The only other point of interest is the statement that  the revised Book was \"annexed and joined\" to the  statute, a precedent which was followed in 1662.    In the second session of Mary's first Parliament  the Acts of Uniformity were repealed. But the  appetite for legislation was aroused. Mary, too, had  ideas about legal uniformity. She had no handy and  comprehensive service-book, the use of which could  be enforced; but the vague standard of what was  customary at a certain date was set up:      All such Divine Service and Administration of Sacraments,    as were most commonly used in the Realm of    England in the last year of the reign of our late    Sovereign Lord King Henry the Eight,    were alone to be used. Strangely enough, no penalties  were appointed for the disobedient. [12]    Elizabeth, immediately upon her accession, began  to take measures quietly and cautiously for returning  to the Edwardian position. She revived the use of  the English Litany in her chapel, and encouraged it  elsewhere. So far nothing was done seriously contrary  to the statute of Mary, for the Litany as now  used varied but little from that used under Henry  VIII. Others, however, went further. The returning  exiles, and those who had secretly sympathized  with them, began to use the Edwardian Prayer-book. [13]  There were no statutory penalties to restrain them,  and the bishops looked on helpless, or acquiescent.  Even in the Queen's chapel, it is said, the English  service was used on Easter Day. [14] Long before the  Prayer-book was restored to its legal position. Parkhurst  was able to write to Bullinger, perhaps with  some exaggeration, that it was again in general use:  _Nunc iterum per totam Angliam in usu passim est_. [15]    It was the Prayer-book as used in the last year  of King Edward which was thus revived. But meanwhile  a committee of divines was at work revising it.  Little is known of their proceedings, or of the authority  under which they acted, nor am I concerned with this  question. [16] There is in the Record Office a paper  which roundly asserts that Convocation went over the  Book and approved the alterations before it was  brought into Parliament. The document is undated,  but the calendar assigns it to the year 1559. It  is, however, certainly not of this date, and though  interesting from another point of view, it cannot be  taken to have any value as evidence of fact. [17] The  statement cannot be reconciled with what we know  of the proceedings of Convocation at the time.    Parliament met on the 23rd of January, 1559, and  after some abortive attempts at legislation a Bill for  Uniformity was brought into the House of Commons  on April 18, and passed within two days; in the  House of Lords it was keenly debated, but passed  without amendment on April 28, [18] all the bishops  present dissenting. By this third Act of Uniformity  all the provisions of the former statutes were revived.  The same penalties were enacted, with one addition--a  fine of one shilling for absence from church on  Sundays or holy days, to be levied by the churchwardens  of each parish. The Prayer-book is not  said to be annexed to the Act, [19] but is identified by  reference to the statute of the fifth and sixth of  Edward VI., by which it is said to have been  \"authorized.\" Certain changes to be made in the  Book so identified are specified: it is to be used      with one alteration, or addition of certain Lessons    to be used on every Sunday in the year, and the form    of the Litany altered and corrected, and two sentences    only added in the delivery of the Sacrament to the    communicants.    The alterations are said to be \"appointed by this  statute.\" I call attention to these points, because  they seem to show that Elizabeth and her Parliament  assumed the function of amending the Book, and  claimed for it a purely statutory authority. Such an  assumption is strangely inconsistent with the subsequent  actions of the Queen, and we are the more  struck by the contrast if we reflect that the Act was  introduced in the House of Commons. In 1571, when  the Commons began to stir matters of the same kind,  Elizabeth sent them more than one sharp message  forbidding them to meddle with such concerns. The  speed, moreover, with which the Bill passed the  Commons leaves little room for doubt that all was  fully prepared beforehand, the revision of the Book  completed, and the enforcement of its use alone  made matter of parliamentary debate. In the  Lords there was considerable discussion, and the  Book was roughly handled by the opposing bishops;  but the debate proceeded on the Book as a whole,  and there is no trace of any legislative action dealing  with its details. At the same time it is right to observe  that the power of Parliament to impose the Book was  challenged, and no other sanction appears to have  been contemplated. [20] The only possible conclusion  seems to be that the Book was revised by the committee  of which I have spoken, and that as very few  changes were made, no fair copy of the whole Book  was submitted to Parliament, but the alterations were,  for the purpose of reference, mentioned in the Act.  Even this was done without much precision. The  wording of the alterations is not specified. More  remarkable still is the fact that in all the printed  copies of the Book yet other alterations were imported,  by what authority is not known. It would seem that  no copy of the Prayer-book ever existed which  answered exactly to the description given in the Act  of 1559. [21] It is impossible, therefore, to say that the  form of the Book was precisely determined by authority  of Parliament. The purport of the Act was to enforce  the use of the Book in a form otherwise determined.  That form was settled, with some measure of ecclesiastical  sanction, in the time of Edward VI. What  sanction there was for the trifling changes now made  is not very clear, and possibly men were not meant  to inquire too closely.    The obscurity which veils the proceedings of 1559  does not reappear on the occasion of the next revision.  In 1660, on the restoration of the monarchy, the use of  the Book of Common Prayer, which had been forbidden  under severe penalties during the rule of the Long  Parliament and of Cromwell, revived as a matter of  course. The Ordinances of the previous eighteen  years were void in law. Indeed, the Elizabethan Act  of Uniformity remained theoretically in force. Charles,"]]]
