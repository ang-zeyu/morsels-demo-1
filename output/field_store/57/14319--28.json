[Illustration: Biddy Fifine]    [Illustration: BED IN SUMMER]    [Illustration]          AT THE SEA-SIDE          When I was down beside the sea      A wooden spade they gave to me        To dig the sandy shore.        My holes were empty like a cup.      In every hole the sea came up,        Till it could come no more.    [Illustration]    [Illustration]          YOUNG NIGHT-THOUGHT          All night long and every night,      When my mama puts out the light,      I see the people marching by,      As plain as day, before my eye.        Armies and emperors and kings,      All carrying different kinds of things,      And marching in so grand a way,      You never saw the like by day.        So fine a show was never seen      At the great circus on the green;      For every kind of beast and man      Is marching in that caravan.        At first they move a little slow,      But still the faster on they go,      And still beside them close I keep      Until we reach the town of Sleep.    [Illustration]          WHOLE DUTY OF CHILDREN          A child should always say what's true      And speak when he is spoken to,      And behave mannerly at table;      At least as far as he is able.          RAIN          The rain is raining all around,        It falls on field and tree,      It rains on the umbrellas here,        And on the ships at sea.    [Illustration]    [Illustration]          PIRATE STORY          Three of us afloat in the meadow by the swing,        Three of us aboard in the basket on the lea.      Winds are in the air, they are blowing in the spring,        And waves are on the meadow like the waves there are at sea.        Where shall we adventure, to-day that we're afloat,        Wary of the weather and steering by a star?      Shall it be to Africa, a-steering of the boat,        To Providence, or Babylon, or off to Malabar?        Hi! but here's a squadron a-rowing on the sea--        Cattle on the meadow a-charging with a roar!      Quick, and we'll escape them, they're as mad as they can be,        The wicket is the harbour and the garden is the shore.          FOREIGN LANDS          Up into the cherry tree      Who should climb but little me?      I held the trunk with both my hands      And looked abroad on foreign lands.        I saw the next door garden lie,      Adorned with flowers, before my eye,      And many pleasant places more      That I had never seen before.        I saw the dimpling river pass      And be the sky's blue looking-glass;      The dusty roads go up and down      With people tramping in to town.        If I could find a higher tree      Farther and farther I should see,      To where the grown-up river slips      Into the sea among the ships,        To where the roads on either hand      Lead onward into fairy land,      Where all the children dine at five,      And all the playthings come alive.    [Illustration]    [Illustration]          WINDY NIGHTS          Whenever the moon and stars are set,        Whenever the wind is high,      All night long in the dark and wet,        A man goes riding by.      Late in the night when the fires are out,      Why does he gallop and gallop about?        Whenever the trees are crying aloud,        And ships are tossed at sea,      By, on the highway, low and loud,        By at the gallop goes he.      By at the gallop he goes, and then      By he comes back at the gallop again.    [Illustration]    [Illustration: FOREIGN LANDS]          TRAVEL          I should like to rise and go      Where the golden apples grow;--      Where below another sky      Parrot islands anchored lie,      And, watched by cockatoos and goats,      Lonely Crusoes building boats;--      Where in sunshine reaching out      Eastern cities, miles about,      Are with mosque and minaret      Among sandy gardens set,      And the rich goods from near and far      Hang for sale in the bazaar;--      Where the Great Wall round China goes,      And on one side the desert blows,      And with bell and voice and drum,      Cities on the other hum;--      Where are forests, hot as fire,      Wide as England, tall as a spire,      Full of apes and cocoa-nuts      And the negro hunters' huts;--      Where the knotty crocodile      Lies and blinks in the Nile,      And the red flamingo flies      Hunting fish before his eyes;--      Where in jungles, near and far,      Man-devouring tigers are,      Lying close and giving ear      Lest the hunt be drawing near,    [Illustration]        Or a comer-by be seen      Swinging in a palanquin;--      Where among the desert sands      Some deserted city stands,      All its children, sweep and prince,      Grown to manhood ages since,      Not a foot in street or house,      Not a stir of child or mouse,      And when kindly falls the night,      In all the town no spark of light.      There I'll come when I'm a man      With a camel caravan;      Light a fire in the gloom      Of some dusty dining-room;      See the pictures on the walls,      Heroes, fights, and festivals;      And in a corner find the toys      Of the old Egyptian boys.    [Illustration]          SINGING          Of speckled eggs the birdie sings        And nests among the trees;      The sailor sings of ropes and things        In ships upon the seas.        The children sing in far Japan,        The children sing in Spain;      The organ with the organ man        Is singing in the rain.    [Illustration]          LOOKING FORWARD          When I am grown to man's estate      I shall be very proud and great,      And tell the other girls and boys      Not to meddle with my toys.          A GOOD PLAY          We built a ship upon the stairs      All made of the back-bedroom chairs,      And filled it full of sofa pillows      To go a-sailing on the billows.        We took a saw and several nails,      And water in the nursery pails;      And Tom said, \"Let us also take      An apple and a slice of cake;\"--      Which was enough for Tom and me      To go a-sailing on, till tea.        We sailed along for days and days      And had the very best of plays;      But Tom fell out and hurt his knee,      So there was no one left but me.    [Illustration]    [Illustration]          WHERE GO THE BOATS?          Dark brown is the river,        Golden is the sand.      It flows along for ever,        With trees on either hand.        Green leaves a-floating,        Castles of the foam,      Boats of mine a-boating--        Where will all come home?        On goes the river        And out past the mill,      Away down the valley,        Away down the hill.        Away down the river,        A hundred miles or more,      Other little children        Shall bring my boats ashore.    [Illustration]          AUNTIE'S SKIRTS          Whenever Auntie moves around,      Her dresses make a curious sound,      They trail behind her up the floor,      And trundle after through the door.    [Illustration]          THE LAND OF COUNTERPANE          When I was sick and lay a-bed,      I had two pillows at my head,      And all my toys beside me lay      To keep me happy all the day.        And sometimes for an hour or so      I watched my leaden soldiers go,      With different uniforms and drills,      Among the bed-clothes, through the hills;        And sometimes sent my ships in fleets      All up and down among the sheets;      Or brought my trees and houses out,      And planted cities all about.        I was the giant great and still      That sits upon the pillow-hill,      And sees before him, dale and plain,      The pleasant land of counterpane.    [Illustration: THE LAND OF COUNTERPANE]          THE LAND OF NOD          From breakfast on through all the day      At home among my friends I stay,      But every night I go abroad      Afar into the land of Nod.        All by myself I have to go,      With none to tell me what to do--      All alone beside the streams      And up the mountain-sides of dreams.        The strangest things are there for me,      Both things to eat and things to see,      And many frightening sights abroad      Till morning in the land of Nod.        Try as I like to find the way,      I never can get back by day,      Nor can remember plain and clear      The curious music that I hear.    [Illustration]    [Illustration]          MY SHADOW          I have a little shadow that goes in and out with me,      And what can be the use of him is more than I can see.      He is very, very like me from the heels up to the head;      And I see him jump before me, when I jump into my bed.        The funniest thing about him is the way he likes to grow--      Not at all like proper children, which is always very slow;      For he sometimes shoots up taller like an india-rubber ball,      And he sometimes gets so little that there's none of him at all.        He hasn't got a notion of how children ought to play,      And can only make a fool of me in every sort of way.      He stays so close beside me, he's a coward you can see;      I'd think shame to stick to nursie as that shadow sticks to me!    [Illustration: MY SHADOW]        One morning, very early, before the sun was up,      I rose and found the shining dew on every buttercup;      But my lazy little shadow, like an arrant sleepy-head,      Had stayed at home behind me and was fast asleep in bed.    [Illustration]          SYSTEM          Every night my prayers I say,      And get my dinner every day;      And every day that I've been good,      I get an orange after food.        The child that is not clean and neat,      With lots of toys and things to eat,      He is a naughty child, I'm sure--      Or else his dear papa is poor.    [Illustration]          A GOOD BOY          I woke before the morning, I was happy all the day,      I never said an ugly word, "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/2562"],[0,"The Clouds (#2)"],[1,"the gnat?         Dis. He said the intestine of the gnat was narrow and       that the wind went forcibly through it, being slender,       straight to the breech; and then that the rump, being       hollow where it is adjacent to the narrow part,       resounded through the violence of the wind.         Strep. The rump of the gnats then is a trumpet! Oh,       thrice happy he for his sharp-sightedness! Surely a       defendant might easily get acquitted who understands the       intestine of the gnat.         Dis. But he was lately deprived of a great idea by a       lizard.         Strep. In what way? Tell me.         Dis. As he was investigating the courses of the moon and       her revolutions, then as he was gaping upward a lizard       in the darkness dropped upon him from the roof.         Strep. I am amused at a lizard's having dropped on       Socrates.         Dis. Yesterday evening there was no supper for us.         Strep. Well. What then did he contrive for provisions?         Dis. He sprinkled fine ashes on the table, and bent a       little spit, and then took it as a pair of compasses and       filched a cloak from the Palaestra.         Strep. Why then do we admire Thales?  Open open quickly       the thinking-shop, and show to me Socrates as quickly as       possible. For I desire to be a disciple. Come, open the       door.         [The door of the thinking-shop opens and the pupils of       Socrates are seen all with their heads fixed on the       ground, while Socrates himself is seen suspended in the       air in a basket.]         O Hercules, from what country are these wild beasts?         Dis. What do you wonder at? To what do they seem to you       to be like?         Strep. To the Spartans who were taken at Pylos.  But why       in the world do these look upon the ground?         Dis. They are in search of the things below the earth.         Strep. Then they are searching for roots. Do not, then,       trouble yourselves about this; for I know where there       are large and fine ones. Why, what are these doing, who       are bent down so much?         Dis. These are groping about in darkness under Tartarus.         Strep. Why then does their rump look toward heaven?         Dis. It is getting taught astronomy alone by itself.         [Turning to the pupils.]         But go in, lest he meet with us.         Strep. Not yet, not yet; but let them remain, that I may       communicate to them a little matter of my own.         Dis. It is not permitted to them to remain without in       the open air for a very long time.         [The pupils retire.]         Strep. (discovering a variety of mathematical       instruments) Why, what is this, in the name of heaven?       Tell me.         Dis. This is Astronomy.         Strep. But what is this?         Dis. Geometry.         Strep. What then is the use of this?         Dis. To measure out the land.         Strep. What belongs to an allotment?         Dis. No, but the whole earth.         Strep. You tell me a clever notion; for the contrivance       is democratic and useful.         Dis. (pointing to a map) See, here's a map of the whole       earth. Do you see? This is Athens.         Strep. What say you? I don't believe you; for I do not       see the Dicasts  sitting.         Dis. Be assured that this is truly the Attic territory.         Strep. Why, where are my fellow-tribesmen of Cicynna?         Dis. Here they are. And Euboea here, as you see, is       stretched out a long way by the side of it to a great       distance.         Strep. I know that; for it was stretched by us and       Pericles.  But where is Lacedaemon?         Dis. Where is it? Here it is.         Strep. How near it is to us! Pay great attention to       this, to remove it very far from us.         Dis. By Jupiter, it is not possible.         Strep. Then you will weep for it.         [Looking up and discovering Socrates.]         Come, who is this man who is in the basket?         Dis. Himself.         Strep. Who's \"Himself\"?         Dis. Socrates.         Strep. O Socrates! Come, you sir, call upon him loudly       for me.         Dis. Nay, rather, call him yourself; for I have no       leisure.         [Exit Disciple.]         Strep. Socrates! My little Socrates!         Socrates. Why callest thou me, thou creature of a day?         Strep. First tell me, I beseech you, what are you doing.         Soc. I am walking in the air, and speculating about the       sun.         Strep. And so you look down upon the gods from your       basket, and not from the earth?         Soc. For I should not have rightly discovered things       celestial if I had not suspended the intellect, and       mixed the thought in a subtle form with its kindred air.       But if, being on the ground, I speculated from below on       things above, I should never have discovered them. For       the earth forcibly attracts to itself the meditative       moisture. Water-cresses also suffer the very same thing.         Strep. What do you say? Does meditation attract the       moisture to the water-cresses? Come then, my little       Socrates, descend to me, that you may teach me those       things, for the sake of which I have come.         [Socrates lowers himself and gets out of the basket.]         Soc. And for what did you come?         Strep. Wishing to learn to speak; for by reason of       usury, and most ill-natured creditors, I am pillaged and       plundered, and have my goods seized for debt.         Soc. How did you get in debt without observing it?         Strep. A horse-disease consumed me--terrible at eating.       But teach me the other one of your two causes, that       which pays nothing; and I will swear by the gods, I will       pay down to you whatever reward you exact of me.         Soc. By what gods will you swear? For, in the first       place, gods are not a current coin with us.         Strep. By what do you swear? By iron money, as in       Byzantium?         Soc. Do you wish to know clearly celestial matters, what       they rightly are?         Strep. Yes, by Jupiter, if it be possible!         Soc. And to hold converse with the Clouds, our       divinities?         Strep. By all means.         Soc. (with great solemnity). Seat yourself, then, upon       the sacred couch.         Strep. Well, I am seated!         Soc. Take, then, this chaplet.         Strep. For what purpose a chaplet? Ah me! Socrates, see       that you do not sacrifice me like Athamas!         Strep. No; we do all these to those who get initiated.         Strep. Then what shall I gain, pray?         Soc. You shall become in oratory a tricky knave, a       thorough rattle, a subtle speaker. But keep quiet.         Strep. By Jupiter! You will not deceive me; for if I am       besprinkled, I shall become fine flour.         Soc. It becomes the old man to speak words of good omen,       and to hearken to my prayer. O sovereign King,       immeasurable Air, who keepest the earth suspended, and       through bright Aether, and ye august goddesses, the       Clouds, sending thunder and lightning, arise, appear in       the air, O mistresses, to your deep thinker!         Strep. Not yet, not yet, till I wrap this around me lest       I be wet through. To think of my having come from home       without even a cap, unlucky man!         Soc. Come then, ye highly honoured Clouds, for a display       to this man. Whether ye are sitting upon the sacred       snow-covered summits of Olympus, or in the gardens of       Father Ocean form a sacred dance with the Nymphs, or       draw in golden pitchers the streams of the waters of the       Nile, or inhabit the Maeotic lake, or the snowy rock of       Mimas, hearken to our prayer, and receive the sacrifice,       and be propitious to the sacred rites.         [The following song is heard at a distance, accompanied       by loud claps of thunder.]         Chorus. Eternal Clouds! Let us arise to view with our       dewy, clear-bright nature, from loud-sounding Father       Ocean to the wood-crowned summits of the lofty       mountains, in order that we may behold clearly the       far-seen watch-towers, and the fruits, and the       fostering, sacred earth, and the rushing sounds of the       divine rivers, and the roaring, loud-sounding sea; for       the unwearied eye of Aether sparkles with glittering       rays. Come, let us shake off the watery cloud from our       immortal forms and survey the earth with far-seeing eye.         Soc. O ye greatly venerable Clouds, ye have clearly       heard me when I called.         [Turning to Strepsiades.]         Did you hear the voice, and the thunder which bellowed       at the same time, feared as a god?         Strep. I too worship you, O ye highly honoured, and am       inclined to reply to the thundering, so much do I       tremble at them and am alarmed. And whether it be       lawful, or be not lawful, I have a desire just now to       ease myself.         Soc. Don't scoff, nor do what these poor-devil-poets do,       but use words of good omen, for a great swarm of       goddesses is in motion with their songs.         Cho. Ye rain-bringing virgins, let us come to the       fruitful land of Pallas,  to view the much-loved country       of Cecrops,  abounding in brave men; where is reverence       for sacred rites not to be divulged;  where the house       that receives the initiated is thrown open in holy       mystic rites; and gifts to the celestial gods; and       high-roofed temples, and statues; and most sacred       processions in honour of the blessed gods; and       well-crowned sacrifices to the gods, and feasts, at all       seasons; and with the approach of spring the Bacchic       festivity, and the rousings of melodious choruses, and       the loud-sounding music of flutes.         Strep. Tell me, O Socrates, I beseech you, by Jupiter,       who are these that have uttered this grand song? Are       they"]]]
