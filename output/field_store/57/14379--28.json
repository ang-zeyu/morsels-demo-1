On the front end of this arbor is a  wheel three-fourths of an inch in diameter, with its periphery smooth,  and polished with rosin, or rosin varnish; and so adjusted, that by  the depression of the key, this wheel is brought up in contact with  the string, whereby, if in motion rotarily, a full sound is produced,  as if a violin bow was drawn across the string. On the other end of  the arbor is a grooved pulley, over which passes a silken cord, which  also passes round a delicate band-wheel, I, below, and by which,  motion is communicated to the arbor and sounding wheel. The band-wheel  is mounted on a shaft, I J, which has its bearings in two small head  blocks which project from two crossbars: and from the block J is  suspended a vertical rod, to the bottom of which is attached a  treadle, K L, and from which a curved ratch, L M, extends upward and  takes to a small ratchet on the shaft I J; so that, by the horizontal  motion of the treadle, the motion is communicated to the wheel, &c.  The teeth of the ratch and ratchet have so gentle an inclination on  one side of each, that although the ratch applies force to the ratchet  in the upward direction, they slide freely over in their return. It  may be understood that the machine is to have two treadles and two  ratches, which move forward alternately: and that twenty or more  arbors, pulleys, strings and keys are arranged in series, although  only one of each is represented in the engraving. The cord applies to  each pulley in the series, by passing over the first, under the  second, and over the third, and so on, descending from the last of the  series to the band-wheel. Each arbor is placed directly under its  respective string, and it is also proposed to place moveable stops  under the strings, at equal distances from the key bridge, and to  regulate the tones by adjusting the stops, without depending on the  pins at the ends for that purpose. We shall employ a competent  mechanic to construct one or more of these instruments as soon as  convenient, and give due notice accordingly.           *       *       *       *       *          AN ECLIPSE IN ARABIA.      Casting my eyes over the bright, full moon, I perceived that an  eclipse was just coming upon it. What astronomer had calculated this  eclipse for Arabia? It was indeed a privilege to witness one in the  bright sky that over-spread the lonely mountains of Seir. Soon we were  seated in a circle, with our Arabs round their watch-fire, enquiring  of them their views of an eclipse, and explaining to them ours. They  appeared to have no idea of its real cause, regarding it as a judgment  from God, a sign of a bad season, and little camel feed. When we  undertook to explain to them the theory of the earth being round,  turning over every day, sometimes getting between the sun and moon,  they seemed to look upon us as telling very strange tales. The eclipse  was nearly total. I gazed upon it with interest, and then eyed the  strange scene around me. The wild, lonely landscape of rock and  sand--the camels kneeling round the bivouac--the wild faces of the  Arabs, reflecting the red light of the fire round which they were  seated--their wild voices and strange guttural language, all combined  to produce an effect so startling, that I felt till then I had never  been thoroughly sensible of our complete separation from the civilized  world.           *       *       *       *       *          GIVING CREDIT.      \"One of our exchange\" says one of our exchanges, \"came to us this week  with four of our editorials _not credited_.\" A frivolous complaint.  Not a week passes but we find in some of our exchanges from ten to  twenty of our editorials; and instead of complaining, we are thankful  for being thus complimented.           *       *       *       *       *          THE BOWIE KNIFE AND ITS INVENTOR.      This instrument was devised by Col. James Bowie, an American, and a  man of desperate valor. He considered, and apparently with justice,  too, that, in close fighting, a much shorter weapon than the sword  ordinarily in use, but still _heavy_ enough to give it sufficient  force, and, at the same time, contrive to cut and thrust, would be far  preferable, and more advantageous to the wearer. He accordingly  invented the short sword, or knife, which has since gone under his  name. It is made of various sizes; but the best, I may say, is about  the length of a carving knife--case perfectly straight in the first  instance, but greatly rounded at the end on the edge side; the upper  edge at the end, for the length of about two inches, is ground into  the small segment of a circle and rendered sharp; thus leaving an  apparent curve of the knife, although in reality the upturned point is  not higher than the line of the back. The back itself gradually  increases in weight of metal as it approaches the hilt, on which a  small guard is placed. The Bowie knife, therefore, has a curved, keen  point; is double edged for the space of about a couple of inches of  its length; and when in use, falls with the weight of a bill  hook.--Bowie went to Texas during the troubles which preceded the  independence of that country,--and was lying sick in bed at the  fortress of the Alamo, when, on the 6th of March, 1836, it was stormed  by Santa Anna and taken. Bowie was murdered there upon his pillow. The  hand that formed the dreadful knife could no longer wield it.           *       *       *       *       *          FORESTS AND STREAMS.      That remarkable man, Humbolt, has reduced it almost to a  demonstration, that the streams of our country, fail in proportion to  the destruction of its timber. And of course, if the streams fail, our  seasons will be worse; it must get drier and drier in proportion.  Humbolt, speaking of the Valley of Araguay in Venezuela, says that the  lake receded as agriculture advanced, until the beautiful plantations  of sugar-cane, banana and cotton-trees, were established on its banks,  which (banks) year after year were farther from them. After the  separation of that Province from Spain, and the decline of agriculture  amid the desolating wars which swept over this beautiful region, the  process of clearing was arrested, and old lands grew up in trees with  that rapidity common to the tropics, and in a few years the  inhabitants were alarmed by a rise of the waters, and an inundation of  their choice plantations.           *       *       *       *       *          PRUSSIAN MUSIC.      The Boston Brigade Band has been presented with a copy of the  collection of the celebrated martial music of the Prussian army.  Prussia has long been famous for the excellence of its military bands,  and the music which they have produced is of the highest order. We  hope this attempt to introduce it into our city will improve the style  of martial music here.           *       *       *       *       *          PHILOSOPHY.      \"Uncle Jo,\" said an observing little boy, \"our folks always put up the  window when the room is filled with smoke, and the wind always blows  in so as to prevent the smoke from going out that way: now where does  the smoke go?\" \"It goes into the people's eyes,\" was uncle Jo's  philosophic answer.           *       *       *       *       *          POLITE PREACHING.

We have frequently heard of singular and unaccountable reports, as of  explosion, in Deerfield, but"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/27868"],[0,"The Glow-Worm and Other Beetles (#2)"],[1,"of the needle. A corpse itself could  not give fewer signs of life.    Here is something even more conclusive: chance occasionally gives me  Snails attacked by the Lampyris while they are creeping along, the  foot slowly crawling, the tentacles swollen to their full extent. A  few disordered movements betray a brief excitement on the part of the  mollusc and then everything ceases: the foot no longer slugs; the  front-part loses its graceful swan-neck curve; the tentacles become  limp and give way under their weight, dangling feebly like a broken  stick. This conditions persists.    Is the Snail really dead? Not at all, for I am free to resuscitate the  seeming corpse. After two or three days of that singular condition  which is no longer life and yet not death, I isolate the patient and,  although this is not really necessary to success, I give him a douche  which will represent the shower so dear to the able-bodied mollusc. In  about a couple of days, my prisoner, but lately injured by the  Glow-worm's treachery, is restored to his normal state. He revives, in  a manner; he recovers movement and sensibility. He is affected by the  stimulus of a needle; he shifts his place, crawls, puts out his  tentacles, as though nothing unusual had occurred. The general torpor,  a sort of deep drunkenness, has vanished outright. The dead returns to  life. What name shall we give to that form of existence which, for a  time, abolishes the power of movement and the sense of pain? I can see  but one that is approximately suitable: anaesthesia. The exploits of a  host of Wasps whose flesh-eating grubs are provided with meat that is  motionless though not dead[2] have taught us the skilful art of the  paralyzing insect, which numbs the locomotory nerve-centres with its  venom. We have now a humble little animal that first produces complete  anaesthesia in its patient. Human science did not in reality invent  this art, which is one of the wonders of our latter-day surgery. Much  earlier, far back in the centuries, the Lampyris and, apparently,  others knew it as well. The animal's knowledge had a long start of  ours; the method alone has changed. Our operators proceed by making us  inhale the fumes of ether or chloroform; the insect proceeds by  injecting a special virus that comes from the mandibular fangs in  infinitesimal doses. Might we not one day be able to benefit by this  hint? What glorious discoveries the future would have in store for us,  if we understood the beastie's secrets better!    [Footnote 2: Cf. _The Hunting Wasps_, by J. Henri Fabre, translated by  Alexander Teixeira de Mattos: _passim_.--_Translator's Note_.]    What does the Lampyris want with anaesthetical talent against a  harmless and moreover eminently peaceful adversary, who would never  begin the quarrel of his own accord? I think I see. We find in Algeria  a Beetle known as _Drilus maroccanus_, who, though non-luminous,  approaches our Glow-worm in his organization and especially in his  habits. He too feeds on land molluscs. His prey is a Cyclostome with a  graceful spiral shell, tight-closed with a stony lid which is attached  to the animal by a powerful muscle. The lid is a movable door which is  quickly shut by the inmate's mere withdrawal into his house and as  easily opened when the hermit goes forth. With this system of closing,  the abode becomes inviolable; and the Drilus knows it.    Fixed to the surface of the shell by an adhesive apparatus whereof the  Lampyris will presently show us the equivalent, he remains on the  look-out, waiting, if necessary, for whole days at a time. At last,  the need of air and food oblige the besieged noncombatant to show  himself; at least, the door is set slightly ajar. That is enough. The  Drilus is on the spot and strikes his blow. The door can no longer be  closed and the assailant is henceforth master of the fortress. Our  first impression is that the muscle moving the lid has been cut with a  quick-acting pair of shears. This idea must be dismissed. The Drilus  is not well enough equipped with jaws to gnaw through a fleshy mass so  promptly. The operation has to succeed at once, at the first touch: if  not, the animal attacked would retreat, still in full vigour, and the  siege must be recommenced, as arduous as ever, exposing the insect to  fasts indefinitely prolonged. Although I have never come across the  Drilus, who is a stranger to my district, I conjecture a method of  attack very similar to that of the Glow-worm. Like our own  Snail-eater, the Algerian insect does not cut its victim into small  pieces: it renders it inert, chloroforms it by means of a few tweaks  which are easily distributed, if the lid but half-opens for a second.  That will do. The besieger thereupon enters and, in perfect quiet,  consumes a prey incapable of the least muscular effort. That is how I  see things by the unaided light of logic.    Let us now return to the Glow-worm. When the Snail is on the ground,  creeping, or even shrunk into his shell, the attack never presents any  difficulty. The shell possesses no lid and leaves the hermit's  fore-part to a great extent exposed. Here, on the edges of the mantle  contracted by the fear of danger, the mollusc is vulnerable and  incapable of defence. But it also frequently happens that the Snail  occupies a raised position, clinging to the tip of a grass-stalk or  perhaps to the smooth surface of a stone. This support serves him as a  temporary lid; it wards off the aggression of any churl who might try  to molest the inhabitant of the cabin, always on the express condition  that no slit show itself anywhere on the protecting circumference. If,  on the other hand, in the frequent case when the shell does not fit  its support quite closely, some point, however tiny, be left  uncovered, this is enough for the subtle tools of the Lampyris, who  just nibbles at the mollusc and at once plunges him into that profound  immobility which favours the tranquil proceedings of the consumer.    These proceedings are marked by extreme prudence. The assailant has to  handle his victim gingerly, without provoking contractions which would  make the Snail let go his support and, at the very least, precipitate  him from the tall stalk whereon he is blissfully slumbering. Now any  game falling to the ground would seem to be so much sheer loss, for  the Glow-worm has no great zeal for hunting-expeditions: he profits by  the discoveries which good luck sends him, without undertaking  assiduous searches. It is essential, therefore, that the equilibrium  of a prize perched on the top of a stalk and only just held in  position by a touch of glue should be disturbed as little as possible  during the onslaught; it is necessary that the assailant should go to  work with infinite circumspection and without producing pain, lest any  muscular reaction should provoke a fall and endanger the prize. As we  see, sudden and profound anaesthesia is an excellent means of enabling  the Lampyris to attain his object, which is to consume his prey in  perfect quiet.    What is his manner of consuming it? Does he really eat, that is to  say, does he divide his food piecemeal, does he carve it into minute  particles, which are afterwards ground by a chewing-apparatus? I think  not. I never see a trace of solid nourishment on my captives' mouths.  The Glow-worm does not eat in the strict sense of the word: he drinks  his fill; he feeds on a thin gruel into which he transforms his prey  by a method recalling that of the maggot. Like the flesh-eating grub  of the Fly, he too is able to digest before consuming; he liquefies  his prey before feeding on it.    This is how things happen: a Snail has been rendered insensible by the  Glow-worm. The operator is nearly always alone, even when the prize is  a large one, like the Common Snail, _Helix aspersa_. Soon a number of  guests hasten up--two, three or more--and, without any quarrel with  real proprietor, all alike fall to. Let us leave them to themselves  for a couple of days and then turn the shell, with the opening  downwards. The contents flow out as easily as would soup from an  overturned saucepan. When the sated diners retire from this gruel,  only insignificant leavings remain.    The matter is obvious: by repeated tiny bites, similar to the tweaks  which we saw distributed at the outset, the flesh of the mollusc is  converted into a gruel on which the various banqueters nourish  themselves without distinction, each working at the broth by means of  some special pepsine and each taking his own mouthfuls of it. In  consequence of this method, which first converts the food into a  liquid, the Glow-worm's mouth must be very feebly armed apart from the  two fangs which sting the patient and inject the anaesthetic poison  and, at the same time, no doubt, the serum capable of turning the  solid flesh into fluid. These two tiny implements, which can just be  examined through the lens, must, it seems, have some other object.  They are hollow and in this resemble those of the Ant-lion, which  sucks and drains its capture without having to divide it; but there is  this great difference, that the Ant-lion leaves copious remnants,  which are afterwards flung outside the funnel-shaped trap dug in the  sand, whereas the Glow-worm, that expert liquefier, leaves nothing, or  next to nothing. With similar tools, the one simply sucks the blood of  its prey and the other turns every morsel of his to account, thanks to  a preliminary liquefaction.    And this is done with exquisite precision, though the equilibrium is  sometimes anything but steady. My rearing-glasses supply me with  magnificent examples. Crawling up the sides, the Snails imprisoned in  my apparatus sometimes reach the top, which is closed with a glass  pane, and fix themselves to it by means of a speck of glair. This is a  mere temporary halt, in which the mollusc is miserly with its adhesive  product, and"]]]
