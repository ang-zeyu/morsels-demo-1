The greatest source of doubt  arises from the confusion between sundials, water-clocks, hand-struck  time bells, and mechanical clocks, all of which are covered by the term  _horologium_ and its vernacular equivalents.    Temporarily postponing the consideration of evidence prior to _ca._  1350, we may take Giovanni de Dondi as a starting point and trace a  virtually unbroken lineage from his time to the present day. One may  follow the spread of clocks through Europe, from large towns to small  ones, from the richer cathedrals and abbeys to the less wealthy  churches.[8] There is the transition from the tower clocks--showpieces  of great institutions--to the simple chamber clock designed for domestic  use and to the smaller portable clocks and still smaller and more  portable pocket watches. In mechanical refinement a similar continuity  may be noted, so that one sees the cumulative effect of the introduction  of the spring drive (_ca._ 1475), pendulum control (_ca._ 1650), and the  anchor escapement (_ca._ 1680). The transition from de Dondi to the  modern chronometer is indeed basically continuous, and though much  research needs to be done on special topics, it has an historical unity  and seems to conform for the most part to the general pattern of steady  mechanical improvement found elsewhere in the history of technology.    [Illustration: Figure 3.--GERMAN WALL CLOCK, PROBABLY ABOUT 1450,  showing the degeneration in complexity from that of de Dondi's clock.]    Most remarkable however is the earliest period of this seemingly steady  evolution. Side by side with the advances made in the earliest period  extending for less than two centuries from the time of de Dondi one may  see a spectacular process of degeneration or devolution. Not only is de  Dondi's the earliest clock of which we have a full and trustworthy  account, it is also far more complicated than any other (see figs. 1, 2)  until comparatively modern times! Moreover, it was not an exceptional  freak. There were others like it, and one cannot therefore reject as  accidental this process of degeneration that occurs at the very  beginning of the certain history of the mechanical clock in Europe.    On the basis of such evidence I have suggested elsewhere[9] that the  clock is \"nought but a fallen angel from the world of astronomy.\" The  first great clocks of medieval Europe were designed as astronomical  showpieces, full of complicated gearing and dials to show the motions of  the Sun, Moon and planets, to exhibit eclipses, and to carry through the  involved computations of the ecclesiastical calendar. As such they were  comparable to the orreries of the 18th century and to modern  planetariums; that they also showed the time and rang it on bells was  almost incidental to their main function. One must not neglect, too,  that it was in their glorification of the rationality of the cosmos that  they had their greatest effect. Through milleniums of civilization,  man's understanding of celestial phenomena had been the very pinnacle of  his intellect, and then as now popular exhibition of this sort was just  as necessary, as striking, and as impressive. One does not have to go  far to see how the paraphernalia of these early great astronomical  clocks had great influence on philosophers and theologians and on poets  such as Dante.    It is the thesis of this part of my argument that the ordinary  time-telling clock is no affiliate of the other simple time-telling  devices such as sundials, sand glasses and the elementary water clocks.  Rather it should be considered as a degenerate branch from the main stem  of mechanized astronomical devices (I shall call them protoclocks), a  stem which can boast a continuous history filling the gap between the  appearance of simple gearing and the complications of de Dondi. We shall  return to the discussion of this main stem after analyzing the very  recently discovered parallel stem from medieval China, which reproduced  the same evolution of mechanized astronomical devices and incidental  time telling. Of the greatest significance, this stem reveals the  crucial independent invention of a mechanical escapement, a feature not  found in the European stem in spite of centuries of intensive historical  research and effort.      THE CHINESE TRADITION    For this section I am privileged to draw upon a thrilling research  project carried out in 1956 at the University of Cambridge by a team  consisting of Dr. Joseph Needham, Dr. Wang Ling, and myself.[10] In the  course of this work we translated and commented on a series of texts  most of which had not hitherto been made available in a Western tongue  and, though well known in China, had not been recognized as important  for their horological content. The key text with which we started was  the \"Hsin I Hsiang Fa Yao,\" or \"New Design for a (mechanized) Armillary  (sphere) and (celestial) Globe,\" written by Su Sung in A.D. 1090. The  very full historical and technical description in this text enabled us  to establish a glossary and basic understanding of the mechanism that  later enabled us to interpret a whole series of similar, though less  extensive texts, giving a history of prior development of such devices  going back to the introduction of this type of escapement by I-Hsing and  Liang Ling-tsan, in A.D. 725, and to what seems to be the original of  all these Chinese astronomical machines, that built by Chang Heng _ca._  A.D. 130. Filling the gaps between these landmarks are several other  similar texts, giving ample evidence that the Chinese development is  continuous and, at least from Chang Heng onwards, largely independent of  any transmissions from the West.    So far as we can see, the beginning of the chain in China (as indeed in  the West) was the making of simple static models of the celestial  sphere. An armillary sphere was used to represent the chief imaginary  circles (_e.g._, equator, ecliptic, meridians, etc.), or a solid  celestial globe on which such circles could be drawn, together with the  constellations of the fixed stars. The whole apparatus was then mounted  so that it was free to revolve about its polar axis and another ring or  a casing was added, external and fixed, to represent the horizon that  provided a datum for the rising and setting of the Sun and the stars.    In the next stage, reached very soon after this, the rotation of the  model was arranged to proceed automatically instead of by hand. This was  done, we believe, by using a slowly revolving wheel powered by dripping  water and turning the model through a reduction mechanism, probably  involving gears or, more reasonably, a single large gear turned by a  trip lever. It did not matter much that the time-keeping properties were  poor in the long run; the model moved \"by itself\" and the great wonder  was that it agreed with the observed heavens \"like the two halves of a  tally.\"    In the next, and essential, stage the turning of the water wheel was  regulated by an \"escapement\" mechanism consisting of a weighbridge and  trip levers so arranged that the wheel was held in check, scoop by  scoop, while each scoop was filled by the dripping water, then released  by the weighbridge and allowed to rotate until checked again by the  trip-lever arrangement. Its action was similar to that of the anchor  escapement, though its period of repose was much longer than its period  of motion and, of course, its time-keeping properties were controlled not  only by the mechanics of the device but also by the rate of flow of the  dripping water.    The Chinese escapement may justifiably be regarded as a missing link,  just halfway between the elementary clepsydra with its steady flow of  water and the mechanical escapement in which time is counted by chopping  its flow into cycles of action, repeated indefinitely and counted by a  cumulating device. With its characteristic of saving up energy for a  considerable period (about 15 minutes) before letting it go in one  powerful action, the Chinese escapement was particularly suited to the  driving of jackwork and other demonstration devices requiring much  energy but only intermittent activity.    In its final form, as built by Su Sung after many trials and  improvements, the Chinese \"astronomical clock-tower\" must have been a  most impressive object. It had the form of a tower about 30 feet high,  surmounted by an observation platform covered with a light roof (see  fig. 4). On the platform was an armillary sphere designed for observing  the heavens. It was turned by the clockwork so as to follow the diurnal  rotation and thus avoid the distressing computations caused by the  change of coordinates necessary when fixed alt-azimuth instruments were  used. Below the platform was an enclosed chamber containing the  automatically rotated celestial globe which so wonderfully agreed with  the heavens. Below this, on the front of the tower was a miniature  pagoda with five tiers; on each tier was a doorway through which, at due  moment, appeared jacks who rang bells, clanged gongs, beat drums, and  held tablets to announce the arrival of each hour, each quarter (they  used 100 of them to the day) and each watch of the night. Within the  tower was concealed the mechanism; it consisted mainly of a central  vertical shaft providing power for the sphere, globe, and jackwheels,  and a horizontal shaft geared to the vertical one and carrying the great  water wheel which seemed to set itself magically in motion at every  quarter. In addition to all this were the levers of the escapement  mechanism and a pair of norias by which, once each day, the water used  was pumped from a sump at the bottom to a reservoir at the top, whence  it descended to work the wheel by means of a constant level tank and  several channels.    There were many offshoots and developments of this "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/30003"],[0,"Law and Laughter (#2)"],[1,"tributed. The case  before him was one concerning the limits of certain land. The counsel  having remarked with emphasis, 'We lie on this side, my lord,' and the  opposing counsel with equal vehemence having interposed, 'And we lie on  this side, my lord'--the Lord Chancellor dryly observed, \"If you lie on  both sides, whom am I to believe?\" It would seem that punning was as  great a power in the Law Courts of that time as it is at the present  day. When Egerton as Master of the Rolls was asked to commit a  cause--refer it to a Master in Chancery--he would reply, \"What has the  cause done that it should be committed?\"    Many witticisms of Westminster Hall, attributed to barristers of the  Georgian and Victorian periods, are traceable to a much earlier date.  There is the story of Serjeant Wilkins, whose excuse for drinking a pot  of stout at mid-day was, that he wanted to fuddle his brain down to the  intellectual standard of a British jury. Two hundred and fifty years  earlier, Sir John Millicent, a Cambridgeshire judge, on being asked how  he got on with his brother judges replied, \"Why, i' faithe, I have no  way but to drink myself down to the capacity of the Bench.\" And this  merry thought has also been attributed to one eminent barrister who  became Lord Chancellor, and to more than one Scottish advocate who  ultimately attained to a seat on the Bench.    And to various celebrities of the later Georgian period has been  attributed Lord Shaftesbury's reply to Charles II. When the king  exclaimed, \"Shaftesbury, you are the most profligate man in my  dominions,\" the Chancellor answered somewhat recklessly, \"Of a subject,  sir, I believe I am.\"    Bullying witnesses is an old practice of the Bar, but for instances of  it emanating from the Bench one has to go very far back. A witness with  a long beard was giving evidence that was displeasing to Jeffreys, when  judge, who said: \"If your conscience is as large as your beard, you'll  swear anything.\" The old man retorted: \"My lord, if your lordship  measures consciences by beards, your lordship has none at all.\"    A somewhat similar story of Jeffreys' bullying manner, when at the Bar,  is that of his cross-examining a witness in a leathern doublet, who had  made out a complete case against his client. Jeffreys shouted: \"You  fellow in the leathern doublet, pray what have you for swearing?\" The  man looked steadily at him, and \"Truly, sir,\" said he, \"if you have no  more for lying than I have for swearing, you might wear a leathern  doublet as well as I.\"    Instances of disrespect to the Bench are rarely met with in early as  happily in later days. There is, perhaps, the most flagrant example of  young Wedderburn in the Scottish Court of Session, when with dramatic  effect he threw off his gown and declared he would never enter the Court  again; but he rose to be Lord Chancellor of England. Scarcely less  disrespectful (but not said openly to the Bench) was young Edward Hyde  when hinting that the death of judges was of small moment compared with  his chances of preferment. \"Our best news,\" he wrote to a friend, \"is  that we have good wine abundantly come over; our worst that the plague  is in town, _and no judges die_.\"    [Illustration: ALEXANDER WEDDERBURN, EARL OF ROSSLYN, LORD CHANCELLOR.]    In squabbles between the Bench and the Bar there are few stories that  match for personality the retort of a counsel to Lord Fortescue. His  lordship was disfigured by a purple nose of abnormal growth.  Interrupting counsel one day with the observation: \"Brother, brother,  you are handling the case in a very lame manner,\" the angry counsel  calmly retorted, \"Pardon me, my lord; have patience with me and I will  do my best to make the case as plain as--as--the nose on your lordship's  face.\" Nor did the retort of an Attorney-General to a judge, after a  warm discussion on a point which the latter claimed to decide, show much  respect for the Bench. The judge closed the argument with \"I ruled so  and so.\"--\"_You_ ruled,\" muttered the Attorney-General. \"_You_ ruled!  You were never fit to rule anything but a copy-book.\"    Verse has been used as a medium of much amusing legal wit and humour,  although law and law cases do not offer very easy subjects for turning  into rhyme. But a good illustration is afforded by Mr. Justice Powis,  who had a habit of repeating the phrase, \"Look, do you see,\" and \"I  humbly conceive.\" At York Assize Court on one occasion he said to Mr.  Yorke, afterwards Lord Hardwicke, \"Mr. Yorke, I understand you are going  to publish a poetical version of 'Coke upon Lyttelton.' Will you  favour me with a specimen?\"--\"Certainly, my lord,\" replied the  barrister, who thereupon gravely recited:          \"He that holdeth his lands in fee          Need neither shake nor shiver,        I humbly conceive, for, look, do you see,          They are his and his heirs for ever.\"    In Sir James Burrows' reports is given a poetical version of Chief  Justice Pratt's decision with regard to a woman of English birth who was  the widow of a foreigner.          \"A woman having a settlement,          Married a man with none,        The question was, he being dead,          If what she had was gone.          Quoth Sir John Pratt, 'The settlement          Suspended doth remain        Living the husband; but him dead          It doth revive again.'\"      Chorus of Puisne Judges:          \"Living the husband; but him dead          It doth revive again.\"    The Chief Justice's decision having been reversed by his successor,  Chief Justice Ryder's decision was reported:          \"A woman having a settlement          Married a man with none;        He flies and leaves her destitute,          What then is to be done?          Quoth Ryder the Chief Justice,          'In spite of Sir John Pratt,        You'll send her to the parish          In which she was a brat.'          _Suspension of a settlement_          Is not to be maintained.        That which she had by birth subsists          Until another's gained.\"      Chorus of Puisne Judges:          \"That which she had by birth subsists         Until another's gained.\"           *       *       *       *       *    [Illustration: EDWARD THURLOW, BARON THURLOW. LORD CHANCELLOR.]    Many of the well-known witticisms attributed to great judges are so  tinged with personality--even tending to malignity--that no one  possessing respect for human nature can read them without being tempted  to regard them as mere biographical fabrications. But such a  construction cannot be put upon the stories told of Lord Chancellor  Thurlow, whose overbearing insolence to the Bar is well known. To a few  friends like John Scott, Lord Eldon, and Lloyd Kenyon, Lord Kenyon, he  could be consistently indulgent; but to those who provoked him by an  independent and fearless manner he was little short of a persecutor.  Once when Scott was about to follow his leader, who had made an  unusually able speech, the Chancellor addressed him: \"Mr. Scott, I am  glad to find you are engaged in the cause, for I now stand some chance  of knowing something about the matter.\" This same leader of the Bar on  one occasion, in the excitement of professional altercation, made use of  an undignified expression before Lord Thurlow; but before his lordship  could take notice of it the counsel immediately apologised, saying, \"My  lord, I beg your lordship's pardon. I really forgot for the moment where  I was.\" A silent recognition of the apology would have made the counsel  feel his position more keenly, but the Chancellor could not let such an  opportunity pass and immediately flashed out: \"You thought you were in  your own Court, I presume,\" alluding to a Welsh judgeship held by the  offending counsel.    As a contrast to Lord Thurlow's treatment of Scott's leader, the  following story--given in Scott's own words--shows how the great  Chancellor could unbend himself in the company of men who were in his  favour. \"After dinner, one day when nobody was present but Lord Kenyon  and myself, Lord Thurlow said, 'Taffy, I decided a cause this morning,  and I saw from Scott's face that he doubted whether I was right.'  Thurlow then stated his view of the case, and Kenyon instantly said,  'Your decision was quite right.' 'What say you to that?' asked the  Chancellor. I said, 'I did not presume to form a case on which they were  both agreed. But I think a fact has not been mentioned, which may be  material.' I was about to state the fact, and my reasons. Kenyon,  however, broke in upon me, and with some warmth stated that I was always  so obstinate there was no dealing with me. 'Nay,' interposed Thurlow,  'that's not fair. You, Taffy, are obstinate, and give no reasons. You,  Jack, are obstinate too; but then you give your reasons, and d--d bad  ones they are!'\"    Another anecdote again illustrates the Chancellor's treatment of even  those who were on a friendly footing with him. Sir Thomas Davenport, a  great Nisi Prius leader, had long flattered himself with the hope of  succeeding to some valuable appointment in the law; but several good  things passing by, he lost his patience and temper along with them. At  last he addressed this laconic application to his patron: \"The Chief  Justiceship of Chester is vacant; am I to have it?\" and received the  following laconic answer: \"No! by G--d! Kenyon shall have it.\"    Scarcely less courteous was this Lord Chancellor's treatment of a  solicitor who endeavoured to prove to him a certain person's death. To  all his statements the Chancellor replied, \"Sir, that is no proof,\" till  at last the solicitor losing patience exclaimed: \"Really, my lord, it is  very hard and it is not right that you should not believe me. I knew the  man well: I saw the man dead in his coffin. My lord, the man was my  client.\" \"Good G--d, sir! why didn't you tell me that sooner? I should  not have doubted the fact one moment; for I think nothing can be so"]]]
