By the very next sentence Gregg's eulogy upon Christ becomes an eulogy  upon the Old Testament. He says the Old Testament contained his  teaching; it was reserved for him to elicit, publish and enforce  it.--_Creed of Christendom, pp. 300, 310._    \"But it must not be forgotten that though many of the Christian precepts  were extant before the time of Jesus, yet it is to him that we owe them;  to the energy, the beauty, the power of his teaching, and still more to  the sublime life he led, which was a daily and hourly exposition and  enforcement of his teaching.\"--_Gregg, C.C._    Strauss allows that it was not possible that the early Christians should  have looked upon Christ as their Redeemer and Mediator between God and  men, if the apostles had not proclaimed this very doctrine; and the  apostles could not have preached it if Jesus himself had not designated  himself as the Redeemer from sin, guilt and death, and demanded faith in  himself as a religious act. He asserts that the distinguishing features  of the Christian church must be traced to Christ, his ministry and  teachings about himself; that Christ claimed the power to secure peace  to his followers. He also claims that the moral and religious character  of Christ is above every suspicion, and unequaled in its kind. He says,  \"The purely spiritual and ethical conceptions of God as the '_only  one_,' he owed to his Jewish education, and, also the purity of his  being. But the Greecian element in Jesus was his cheerfulness, arising  from his _unsullied mind_.\" Again he says, Jesus, by cultivating a frame  of mind that was cheerful, in union with God, and embracing all men as  brethren, had realized the prophetic ideal of a New Covenant with the  heart inscribed law; he had to speak with the poet, received God into  his will; so that for him the Godhead had descended from its throne, the  abyss was filled up, all fear was vanished. His beautifully organized  nature had but to develop itself to be more fully and clearly confirmed  in its consciousness of itself, but needed not to return to begin a new  life.    Gregg, the Deist, after presenting Jesus as the \"one towering, perpetual  miracle of history,\" says, \"Next in perfection come the views which  Christianity unfolds to us of God in his relation to man, which were  probably as near the truth as the minds of men could in that age  receive. God is represented as our Father in heaven, to be whose  especial children is the best reward of the peace-makers, to see whose  face is the highest hope of the pure in heart, who is ever at hand to  strengthen his true worshipers, to whom is due our heartiest love, our  humblest submission, whose most acceptable worship is righteous conduct  and a holy heart, in whose constant presence our life is passed, to  whose merciful disposal we are resigned by death. His relation to us is  alone insisted on. All that is needed for our consolation, our strength,  our guidance, is assured to us. The purely speculative is passed over  and ignored.\" It may be that the prospect of an \"exceeding, even an  eternal weight of glory\" may be needed to support our frail purposes  under the crushing afflictions of our mortal lot. It may be that, by the  perfect arrangements of Omnipotence, the sufferings of all may be made  to work out the ultimate and supreme good of each. He next makes this  grand concession: To the orthodox Christian, who fully believes all he  professes, cheerful resignation to the divine will is comparatively a  _natural_, _an easy_, _a simple thing_. To the religious philosopher  (meaning such as himself) it is the highest exercise of intellect and  virtue. The man who has realized the faith that his own lot is so  regulated by God as unerringly to work for his highest good--with such a  man, resignation, patience, nay cheerful acquiescence in all suffering  and sorrow, appear to be in fact only the simple and practical  expression of his belief. If, believing all this, he still murmers and  rebels at the trials and contrarieties of his lot, he is of the  childishness of the infant which quarrels with the medicine that is to  lead it back to health and ease.    Huxley says: \"The belief that the divine commands are identical with the  laws of social morality has left infinite strength to the latter in all  ages. The lover of moral beauty, struggling through a world full of  sorrow and sin, is surely as much the stronger for believing that  sooner or later a vision of perfect peace and goodness will burst upon  him, as the toiler up a mountain for the belief that beyond crag and  snow lie home and rest.\"--_Modern Symposium, page 250, 1._    Baldwin Brown, of the Liberal School, speaking of a very singular effort  of Mr. Harrison, says: \"I rejoice in the passionate earnestness with  which he lifts the hearts of his readers to ideals which it seems to  me--that Christianity which as a living force in the Apostles' days  turned the world upside down, that is right side up, with its face  toward heaven and God--alone can realize for man. I recall a noble  passage written by Mr. Harrison some years ago: 'A religion of action, a  religion of social duty, devotion to an intelligible and sensible head,  a real sense of incorporation with a living and controlling force, the  deliberate effort to serve an immortal humanity--this, and this alone  can absorb the musings and the cravings of the spiritual man.' A.J.  Davis speaking of the first century, says: 'Jesus Christ and his  apostles were at this time establishing the only true religion.'\"    Now, I wish to say a few things in view of all that I have given from  the opposite side. And first, as it is the part of science to find a  cause for every effect, we will look after the causes as given by those  men who reject the essential divinity of the religion of Christ, and  also look after the strength or weakness of their cause, as the case may  be:    1. What is the cause of the character they ascribe to the Christ? We  will begin with the Deist Gregg. He claims that God has endowed men  differently--has endowed some with brains so much larger and finer than  those of ordinary men as to enable them to see and originate truths  which are hidden from the mass; and that when it is his will that  mankind should make some great step forward, should achieve some  pregnant discovery, that is, discovery loaded with benefits to our race,  he calls into being some cerebral organization of more than ordinary  magnitude and power, as that of David, Isaiah, Plato, Shakespeare,  Bacon, Newton, Luther, Pascal. _Here we discover the cause of the  superior character of Christ as a teacher_, which is assigned by all  the leading spirits in modern unbelief, viz: a finely endowed cerebral  organization, and a Jewish education; these are constantly presented as  sufficient to meet the scientific demand for the cause of his life and  teachings, _or the cause of Christianity_. But there is a scientific  demand lying behind all this, viz: what is the cause of this fine  cerebral organization, which was so wonderful as to produce the most  wonderful character of all ages? The answer, given in the clear-cut  words of all except Atheists, who say there is no God, _is this_, \"The  all-wise disposer of all things sends just such men into our race, when  any great step forward is necessary to be made--that he endows them with  direct reference to the discoveries and achievements to be made.\" So the  great cause, after all, is, upon their own showing, the will and power  of God; for if he endowed him, as they claim, with direct reference to  his teachings and achievements, it follows of necessity, that he willed  that those very teachings and achievements should not only be made, but  be made just when they were, and just as they were; so Christianity  finds its origin in God, and is a manifestation from God, according to  the showing of _Gregg_ and _Strauss_. For Strauss will have it that the  finite must not be separated from God. But you must remember that  Strauss is a Pantheist, and that he, as such, claims that the infinite,  or God, who with him is not a person, but _all-pervading_ life, receives  the finite into itself, and so it becomes a part of the idea of the  Godhead; in such a manner, however, that it is not peculiar to Jesus  alone, but to humanity as such. So Strauss reaches the same thought that  Gregg expresses--so far as the relation of Christ to Godhead is  concerned. While he and Strauss differ upon the subject of the Godhead,  one being a Deist and the other a Pantheist, they find their agreement  in naturalism, that is to say, they account for the Christ character  upon the score of his being more finely organized and endowed by  relation to the Godhead; Gregg claims that this is attributable to an  all-wise Godhead, and Strauss claims that it is attributable to the  all-pervading life, or Pantheistic Godhead, and both include as a  second cause of his character his education.    We then systematize as follows: first, the Deist who accepts the  character of Christ as exhibiting a superior life. His first cause for  the existence of Christianity is the fine organization of Christ. His  second cause is his education. The pantheist has it as follows: first  cause for the existence of Christianity, the fine organization of  Christ. Second cause, his education; both, however, must find a cause  _behind_ that fine organization, and that cause, they claim, is the  Godhead, however much they may differ about that Godhead.    This relation between Christ and the true Godhead is the fundamental  article in the Christian religion, and becomes at once, by common  agreement, the first great cause of the origin and existence of the  Christian religion. No Pantheist, or Deist, or Naturalist gets away from  this conclusion without avowing Atheism. What does it amount to? Answer:  _Christianity is of God._"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/28673"],[0,"The Christian Foundation, Or, Scientific and Religious Journal, Volume I, No. (#2)"],[1,"of a righteous  life, he shall surely die.\" We would naturally conclude that this vile  person would transmit moral depravity, if such was possible, but how can  moral corruption be transmitted through physical generation? Let some of  the wise crack this shell! If I was passing around through the little  city of Kokomo to-morrow, and was talking upon this theme, I would hear  some one accuse some poor soul of being a natural born thief, without  the ability to refrain from it. There is neither morality nor  immorality, vice nor virtue in an involuntary act. Are the rushings of  the Wild Cat river moral or immoral? If a man could be a natural thief,  and therefore could not help but steal, he would be no more a sinner in  the sight of God, nor responsible, nor morally corrupt than the horse  that breaks into your cornfield and fills himself.    In the saying, \"If the wicked will turn,\" etc., \"he shall surely live,  he shall not die,\" we discover two important things: First, the death  spoken of is not physical, for all die, regardless of character; second,  it is not moral, for the poor fellow is already morally dead--dead in  trespasses and in sin.    The term die being used in the divine law with reference to the  government of God, and under such circumstances as already mentioned,  must indicate simply the forfeiture of citizen life in the paradise of  God, in the world to come, for it is said of the wicked, \"They have no  inheritance in the kingdom of God and of Christ.\" But if Christ took  their law-place, and was punished in their stead, satisfied justice, of  course it was done, and then universal salvation, regardless of  character, and upon simple _legal merits, must obtain_, because this  theory rests upon the hypothesis that sinners could do nothing for  themselves. But is it true that the atonement was completed upon the  cross or by the death of Christ only? I answer, he was victim upon the  cross and high priest by the power of an endless life. Priest by the  word of the oath which was subsequent to the law. He was not a priest  while he was a victim in death. In ancient times the victim was slain  and its blood was taken into the holy place, then the high priest  officiated in the holy place. But the priest never entered without  blood. So Christ, by his own blood, entered into Heaven itself, now to  appear in the presence of God for us. But all this releases us not in  the least from our own obligations to God and our humanity.    The Savior came to our earth to give us, first, his life, in order that  we might make it our own; second, his divine mind concerning us and our  expectations; third to ratify the same by his death; fourth to give us  an assurance of a resurrection from the dead, and of a future judgment.  For the first it is said \"that he consecrated for us a new and living  way through the veil, that is to say through his flesh, into the  holiest.\" For the second we have simply the gift of a second will. \"He  took away the first that he might establish the second, by the which  will we are sanctified through the offering of the body of Christ.\" For  the third it is said that \"The New Testament was dedicated not without  blood.\" For the fourth it is said that \"He hath appointed a day in the  which he will judge the world in righteousness by that man whom he hath  ordained, whereof he hath given assurance unto all men in that he hath  raised him from the dead.\" So every one of us shall give an account of  himself to God, and receive according to his own works and not the works  of another.    One question, and only one, will be of interest to me in the judgment,  and that is this, how have I lived? What are the deeds which were done  in my body? The Lord once said of a wicked city: \"Though Noah, Job and  Daniel were in it they should save none but themselves by their  righteousness.\" But we are told that the righteousness of Christ was the  only satisfaction; that he, dying in our law-place, paid the debt. Then  I am released. Let the debt be what it may, I can't be held to give  satisfaction. But we were always anxious to know what we were released  from. Was it physical death? No; we must die. Was it death in sin? No;  there is no getting out of that without reformation and pardon.  Vicarious punishment! What is it? What was it that Christ suffered in  the sinners' law-place? It could not be the everlasting punishment  threatened in the Scriptures, for the Savior was only about three hours  upon the cross. And if the Savior paid the debt, why is it that sinners  are to pay it themselves unless they repent?    But there is still another grave objection to the theory. It is this, It  declares that there is no forgiveness with God. He can't forgive when  Christ paid the debt. Can you forgive a debt that is paid? Is it  possible for such a thing to take place? One writer has called this old  theory \"the Redeemer's glory;\" but if it be his glory it is the Father's  dishonor. Elder Stockell gives the theory the very imposing title, \"The  Redeemer's Glory Unveiled.\" But look at the following from page 157 of  his work thus entitled: \"In a _strict_ and _proper_ sense the infinite  God doth not forgive sin; for it is readily granted by all who are sound  in the faith that Jesus Christ hath given full satisfaction to divine  justice for all sin, and hath fully paid the debt of his church. And if  Christ hath satisfied the justice of God for all the sins of his people,  how then can it justly, or with propriety of speech, be said that God  pardoneth our sins and transgressions? Sure I am that debt can never be  forgiven which is paid.\"    Others, who are not so wise, or, it may be, so frank, refuse to allow  the logical consequences of the doctrine of vicarious sufferings. This  theory represents mercy as always stultified until Christ satisfied  justice. Imagine the Savior upon the cross, innocent, suffering by sheer  necessity of justice in the sinners' law-place. Justice is standing off  to the right and Mercy is a short distance to the left. Poor Mercy! She  says, \"I always felt stultified up to this hour, for Justice was always  dissatisfied and frowning.\" Justice responds, \"True; but just now I am  being satisfied. I have always asked for this. So from this time forward  I shall be in a smiling mood. Now we can unite and let the guilty ones  go free, for I have wreaked my vengeance upon the innocent one.\"    Just now the poor skeptic with common sense says, \"Hold! Does not the  law say 'It is the soul that sinneth that shall die?' Did I not hear you  say that you had wreaked your vengeance upon the innocent one?\" Justice  and mercy both draw a veil over their faces and respond through the  advocates of this system of things, \"Without controversy, great is the  mystery of godliness.\" The poor skeptic of common sense retires  muttering to himself something like this, \"Well, if such is the mystery  of godliness, I pray that I may never fall into her hands.\"    Just now he is accosted by a preacher, who says to him, \"Look there  upon that Roman cross. Don't you see that sinless one? He is spotless,  pure and lovely. He never sinned, neither was guile found in His mouth,  yet He was accounted guilty of all the sins of the whole human family,  at least He suffered the full penalty enacted against all the sins of  all the race, and satisfied justice.\" Common-sense skeptic says: \"Who  required that? Who counted him guilty of the whole? Who?\" The preacher  responds, \"God and His justice--yes, His justice.\" Justice, you know,  had to be satisfied, for God Himself could not forgive a man until the  debt was paid. Do you see? Common-sense skeptic turns away disgusted,  and as he walks off he is heard to say, \"Farewell, _to all of you_!\"    Who can blame men who never heard any thing better for being  unbelievers? When Jehovah proclaimed His name, He said \"The Lord, the  Lord God, merciful and gracious, long-suffering and abundant in goodness  and truth, keeping mercy for thousands, _forgiving iniquity and  transgression and sin_.\" This must be admitted by all intelligent  Christians. Mercy was never stultified. There was in all the  dispensations of God's providence free and unstultified mercy. The  infinite One was never unable to forgive sins; neither was He laid under  the necessity of punishing the innocent in the room of the guilty. No,  He never did it. His justice never required it, and it is too mean to  ascribe it to Him. His laws in all the dispensations were conditional,  contained merciful provisions. Now, let us \"fear God and keep His  commandments, for this is the whole duty of man.\"    The great thought of pardon through the abundant goodness of God runs  through all the ages, but substitution, in the sense of vicarious  punishment, does not. It is not taught even in connection with dying  animals, for the \"blood of animals could not take away sins.\" Again, the  soul that sinneth it shall die, but animals were not sinning souls, so  that scrap of revealed law could not be honored in the death of a goat.    There is nothing in the history of the ages to necessitate the idea that  justice could not allow the free exercise of mercy towards the penitent  sinner, or that God's wrath must be appeased, or He made propitious by  means of blood. He was propitious, and therefore ordered the use of  blood for wise and benevolent purposes. The use of blood is related to  His mercy as effect is to cause, and not as cause to effect. The mercy  and goodness of God was always complete, full and unrestrained by all  external causes, except the moral and virtuous qualities of their  object. By the grace of God Jesus tasted death for every man. He did not  go to the cross because law or justice required it, but because He loved  the race. He came from heaven to earth and volunteered the cross as a  commendation or demonstration of the divine love for man. The authority  of law is never"]]]
