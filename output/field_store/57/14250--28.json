There, for  instance, were the delightful articles by Porte Crayon--General  Strothers, I think. These one listened to with pleasure; but the bane of  my existence was Mr. Abbott's \"Life of Napoleon Bonaparte.\" It seemed to  me as if it would never end, and it stretched as dolorously before me as  that other fearful process which appalled my waking days--the knowledge  that all my life I should be obliged to clean my teeth three times a day  with powdered charcoal!    After a time, I began to read for myself; but the delights of desultory  reading were gloomed by the necessity of studying long lessons that no  emancipated child of to-day would endure. Misguided people sometimes  came to the school and told childish stories, at which we all laughed,  but which even the most illiterate despised. To have known George  Warrington, to have mingled familiarly in the society of George  Washington, to remember the picture of Beatrix Esmond coming down the  stairs--I am not speaking of Du Maurier's travesties of that delightful  book--to have seen the old ladies in \"Cranford,\" sucking their oranges  in the privacies of their rooms, made one despise foolish little tales  about over-industrious bees and robins which seemed not even to have the  ordinary common sense of geese!    Suddenly, my mother became a devout Catholic. The scene changed. On one  unhappy Sunday afternoon \"Monte Cristo\" was rudely snatched from my  entranced hands. Dumas was on the list of the \"improper,\" and to this  day I have never finished the episodes in which I was so deeply  interested. Now the wagon of the circulating library ceased to come as  in the old days. The children of the neighbours offered me Sunday-school  books, taken from the precious store of the Methodist Sunday School  opposite our house. They seemed to me to be stupid beyond all words.  There was not one really good fight in them all, and after an honest  villain like Brian de Bois Guilbert, the bad people in these volumes  were very lacking in stamina. The \"Rollo\" books were gay compared to  them. I concluded that if anything on earth could make a child hate  religion, it was the perusal of these unreal books. My mother saw that I  had Alban Butler's \"Lives of the Saints\" for Sunday reading. They were  equally dull; and other \"Lives,\" highly recommended, were quite as  uninspiring as the little volumes from the Protestant library. They were  generally translated from the French, without vitality and without any  regard for the English idiom. I recall, through the mists, sitting down  one Sunday afternoon, to read \"The Life of Saint Rose of Lima.\" As it  concerned itself with South America, it seemed to me that there might be  in it a good fighter or two; or, at least, somebody might cut off the  ear of a High Priest's servant as was done in the New Testament. But no,  I was shocked to read in the very beginning, that         so pure was the little Saint, even in her infancy, that when her       uncle, who was her godfather, kissed her after her baptism, a rosy       glow, a real blush of shame, overspread her countenance.    In that book I read no more that day!    But I discovered a volume I have never forgotten, which probably after  \"The Young Marooners,\" had the greatest influence on me for a short  period. This was \"Fabiola,\" by Cardinal Wiseman. There was good stuff in  it; it made me feel proud to be a Christian; it was full of thrills;  and it taught a lot about the archaeology of Rome, for it was part of  that excellent story. I have always looked on \"Fabiola\" as a very great  book. Then at Christmas, when my father gave me \"The Last Days of  Pompeii,\" I was in a new world, not alien to the world of \"Fabiola,\" but  in some way supplementary to it. This gift was accompanied by Washington  Irving's \"Tales of the Alhambra.\" _Conspuez les livres des poup['e]es!_  What nice little story books, arranged for the growing mind, could  awaken such visions of the past, such splendid arabesques and trailing  clouds of glory as this book! Read at the right time, it makes the  pomegranate and the glittering crescents live forever, and creates a  love for Spain and a romance of old Spain which can never die.    After this, I had a cold mental douche. I was given \"Les Enfants des  Bois,\" by Elie Berthet in French, to translate word for word. It was a  horrible task, and the difficulties of the verbs and the laborious  research in the dictionary prevented me from enjoying the adventures of  these infants. I cannot remember anything that happened to them; but I  know that the book gave me an ever-enduring distrust of the subjunctive  mood in the Gallic language. Somebody had left about a copy of a French  romance called \"Les Aventures de Polydore Marasquin.\" It was of things  that happened to a man in a kingdom of monkeys. It went very well, with  an occasional use of the dictionary, until I discovered that the  gentleman was about to engage himself to a very attractive monkeyess. I  gave up the book in disgust, but I have since discovered that there have  been lately several imitators of these adventures, which I think were  written by an author named L['e]on Gozlan.    About this time, the book auction became a fashion in Philadelphia. If  your people had respect for art, they invariably subscribed to a  publication called the _Cosmopolitan Art Magazine_, and you received a  steel engraving of Shakespeare and his Friends, with Sir Walter Raleigh  very much in the foreground, wearing a beautifully puffed doublet and  very well-fitting hose, and another steel engraving of Washington at  Lexington. If your people were interested in literature, they frequented  the book auctions. My father had a great respect for what he called  \"classical literature.\" He considered Cowper's \"The Task\" immensely  classical; it was beautifully bound, and he never read it. One day he  secured a lovely edition of the \"Complete Works of Thomas Moore.\" It had  been a subject of much competition at the auction, and was cherished  accordingly. The binding was tooled. It was put on the centre table and  adored as a work of art. Here was richness!    Tom Moore's long poems are no doubt classed at present as belonging to  those old and faded gardens in which \"The Daisy\" and \"The Keepsake,\" by  Lady Blessington, once flourished; but if I could only recall the  pleasure I had in the reading of \"Lalla Rookh\" and \"The Veiled Prophet  of Korhasson,\" I think I should be very happy. And the notes to \"Lalla  Rookh\" and to Moore's prose novel of \"The Epicurean\"! \"The Epicurean\"  was not much of a novel, but the notes were full of amazing Egyptian  mysteries, which seemed quite as splendid as the machinery in the  \"Arabian Nights.\" The notes to \"Lalla Rookh\" smelled of roses, and I  remember as a labour of love copying out all the allusions to roses in  these notes with the intention of writing about them when I grew up. My  mother objected to the translations from Anacreon; she said they were  \"improper\"; but my father said that he had been assured on competent  authority that they were \"classic,\" and of course that settled it. There  was no story in them, and they seemed to me to be stupid.    Just about this time, one of the book auctions yielded up a copy of the  \"Complete Works of Miss Mitford.\" You perhaps can imagine how a city  boy, who was allowed to spend two weeks each year at the most on the  arid New Jersey seacoast, fell upon \"Our Village.\" It became an  incentive for long walks, in the hope of finding some country lanes and  something resembling the English primroses. I read and reread \"Our  Village\" until I could close my eyes at any time and see the little  world in which Miss Mitford lived. I tried to read her tragedy, \"The Two  Foscari.\" A tragedy had a faint interest; but, being exiled to the attic  for some offense against the conventionalities demanded of a  Philadelphia child, with no book but Miss Mitford's, I spent my time  looking up all the references to roses in her tragedies. These I  combined with the knowledge acquired from Tom Moore, and made notes for  a paper to be printed in some great periodical in the future. Why roses?  Why Miss Mitford and roses? Why Tom Moore and roses? I do not know,  but, when I was sixteen years of age, I printed the paper in _Appleton's  Journal_, where it may still be found. My parents, who did not look on  my literary attempts, at the expense of mathematics, with favour,  suggested that I was a plagiarist, but as I had no time to look up the  meaning of the word in the dictionary, I let it go. It simply struck me  as one of those evidences of misunderstanding which every honest artist  must be content to accept.    My mother, evidently fearing the influence of \"classical\" literature,  gave me one day \"The Parent's Assistant,\" by Miss Edgeworth. I think  that it was in this book that I discovered \"Rosamond; or The Purple Jar\"  and the story of the good boy or girl who never cut the bit of string  that tied a package; I sedulously devoted myself to the imitation of  this economic child, and was very highly praised for getting the best  out of a good book until I broke a tooth in trying to undo a very tough  knot.    It was a far cry from the respectable Miss Edgeworth to a series of  Beadle's \"Dime Novels.\" I looked on them as delectable but inferior.  There was a prejudice against them in well-brought-up households; but  if you thoughtfully provided yourself with a brown paper cover, which  concealed the flaring yellow of Beadle's front page, you were very  likely to escape criticism. I never finished \"Osceola, the Seminole,\"  because my aunt looked over my shoulder and read a rapturous account of  a real fight, in which somebody kicked somebody else violently in the  abdomen. My aunt"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/24022"],[0,"A Christmas Carol (#2)"],[1,"the crowded paths of life, warning all human sympathy to keep  its distance, was what the knowing ones call 'nuts' to Scrooge.    Once upon a time--of all the good days in the year, on Christmas  Eve--old Scrooge sat busy in his counting-house. It was cold, bleak,  biting weather; foggy withal; and he could hear the people in the court  outside go wheezing up and down, beating their hands upon their breasts,  and stamping their feet upon the pavement stones to warm them. The City  clocks had only just gone three, but it was quite dark already--it had  not been light all day--and candles were flaring in the windows of the  neighbouring offices, like ruddy smears upon the palpable brown air. The  fog came pouring in at every chink and keyhole, and was so dense  without, that, although the court was of the narrowest, the houses  opposite were mere phantoms. To see the dingy cloud come drooping down,  obscuring everything, one might have thought that nature lived hard by,  and was brewing on a large scale.    The door of Scrooge's counting-house was open, that he might keep his  eye upon his clerk, who in a dismal little cell beyond, a sort of tank,  was copying letters. Scrooge had a very small fire, but the clerk's fire  was so very much smaller that it looked like one coal. But he couldn't  replenish it, for Scrooge kept the coal-box in his own room; and so  surely as the clerk came in with the shovel, the master predicted that  it would be necessary for them to part. Wherefore the clerk put on his  white comforter, and tried to warm himself at the candle; in which  effort, not being a man of strong imagination, he failed.    'A merry Christmas, uncle! God save you!' cried a cheerful voice. It was  the voice of Scrooge's nephew, who came upon him so quickly that this  was the first intimation he had of his approach.    'Bah!' said Scrooge. 'Humbug!'    He had so heated himself with rapid walking in the fog and frost, this  nephew of Scrooge's, that he was all in a glow; his face was ruddy and  handsome; his eyes sparkled, and his breath smoked again.    'Christmas a humbug, uncle!' said Scrooge's nephew. 'You don't mean  that, I am sure?'    'I do,' said Scrooge. 'Merry Christmas! What right have you to be merry?  What reason have you to be merry? You're poor enough.'    'Come, then,' returned the nephew gaily. 'What right have you to be  dismal? What reason have you to be morose? You're rich enough.'    Scrooge, having no better answer ready on the spur of the moment, said,  'Bah!' again; and followed it up with 'Humbug!'    'Don't be cross, uncle!' said the nephew.    'What else can I be,' returned the uncle, 'when I live in such a world  of fools as this? Merry Christmas! Out upon merry Christmas! What's  Christmas-time to you but a time for paying bills without money; a time  for finding yourself a year older, and not an hour richer; a time for  balancing your books, and having every item in 'em through a round dozen  of months presented dead against you? If I could work my will,' said  Scrooge indignantly, 'every idiot who goes about with \"Merry Christmas\"  on his lips should be boiled with his own pudding, and buried with a  stake of holly through his heart. He should!'    'Uncle!' pleaded the nephew.    'Nephew!' returned the uncle sternly, 'keep Christmas in your own way,  and let me keep it in mine.'    'Keep it!' repeated Scrooge's nephew. 'But you don't keep it.'    'Let me leave it alone, then,' said Scrooge. 'Much good may it do you!  Much good it has ever done you!'    'There are many things from which I might have derived good, by which I  have not profited, I dare say,' returned the nephew; 'Christmas among  the rest. But I am sure I have always thought of Christmas-time, when  it has come round--apart from the veneration due to its sacred name and  origin, if anything belonging to it can be apart from that--as a good  time; a kind, forgiving, charitable, pleasant time; the only time I know  of, in the long calendar of the year, when men and women seem by one  consent to open their shut-up hearts freely, and to think of people  below them as if they really were fellow-passengers to the grave, and  not another race of creatures bound on other journeys. And therefore,  uncle, though it has never put a scrap of gold or silver in my pocket, I  believe that it _has_ done me good and _will_ do me good; and I say, God  bless it!'    The clerk in the tank involuntarily applauded. Becoming immediately  sensible of the impropriety, he poked the fire, and extinguished the  last frail spark for ever.    'Let me hear another sound from _you_,' said Scrooge, 'and you'll keep  your Christmas by losing your situation! You're quite a powerful  speaker, sir,' he added, turning to his nephew. 'I wonder you don't go  into Parliament.'    'Don't be angry, uncle. Come! Dine with us to-morrow.'    Scrooge said that he would see him----Yes, indeed he did. He went the  whole length of the expression, and said that he would see him in that  extremity first.    'But why?' cried Scrooge's nephew. 'Why?'    'Why did you get married?' said Scrooge.    'Because I fell in love.'    'Because you fell in love!' growled Scrooge, as if that were the only  one thing in the world more ridiculous than a merry Christmas. 'Good  afternoon!'    'Nay, uncle, but you never came to see me before that happened. Why give  it as a reason for not coming now?'    'Good afternoon,' said Scrooge.    'I want nothing from you; I ask nothing of you; why cannot we be  friends?'    'Good afternoon!' said Scrooge.    'I am sorry, with all my heart, to find you so resolute. We have never  had any quarrel to which I have been a party. But I have made the trial  in homage to Christmas, and I'll keep my Christmas humour to the last.  So A Merry Christmas, uncle!'    'Good afternoon,' said Scrooge.    'And A Happy New Year!'    'Good afternoon!' said Scrooge.    His nephew left the room without an angry word, notwithstanding. He  stopped at the outer door to bestow the greetings of the season on the  clerk, who, cold as he was, was warmer than Scrooge; for he returned  them cordially.    'There's another fellow,' muttered Scrooge, who overheard him: 'my  clerk, with fifteen shillings a week, and a wife and family, talking  about a merry Christmas. I'll retire to Bedlam.'    This lunatic, in letting Scrooge's nephew out, had let two other people  in. They were portly gentlemen, pleasant to behold, and now stood, with  their hats off, in Scrooge's office. They had books and papers in their  hands, and bowed to him.    'Scrooge and Marley's, I believe,' said one of the gentlemen, referring  to his list. 'Have I the pleasure of addressing Mr. Scrooge, or Mr.  Marley?'    'Mr. Marley has been dead these seven years,' Scrooge replied. 'He died  seven years ago, this very night.'    'We have no doubt his liberality is well represented by his surviving  partner,' said the gentleman, presenting his credentials.    [Illustration: THEY WERE PORTLY GENTLEMEN, PLEASANT TO BEHOLD]    It certainly was; for they had been two kindred spirits. At the ominous  word 'liberality' Scrooge frowned, and shook his head, and handed the  credentials back.    'At this festive season of the year, Mr. Scrooge,' said the gentleman,  taking up a pen, 'it is more than usually desirable that we should make  some slight provision for the poor and destitute, who suffer greatly at  the present time. Many thousands are in want of common necessaries;  hundreds of thousands are in want of common comforts, sir.'    'Are there no prisons?' asked Scrooge.    'Plenty of prisons,' said the gentleman, laying down the pen again.    'And the Union workhouses?' demanded Scrooge. 'Are they still in  operation?'    'They are. Still,' returned the gentleman, 'I wish I could say they were  not.'    'The Treadmill and the Poor Law are in full vigour, then?' said Scrooge.    'Both very busy, sir.'    'Oh! I was afraid, from what you said at first, that something had  occurred to stop them in their useful course,' said Scrooge. 'I am very  glad to hear it.'    'Under the impression that they scarcely furnish Christian cheer of mind  or body to the multitude,' returned the gentleman, 'a few of us are  endeavouring to raise a fund to buy the Poor some meat and drink, and  means of warmth. We choose this time, because it is a time, of all  others, when Want is keenly felt, and Abundance rejoices. What shall I  put you down for?'    'Nothing!' Scrooge replied.    'You wish to be anonymous?'    'I wish to be left alone,' said Scrooge. 'Since you ask me what I wish,  gentlemen, that is my answer. I don't make merry myself at Christmas,  and I can't afford to make idle people merry. I help to support the  establishments I have mentioned--they cost enough: and those who are  badly off must go there.'    'Many can't go there; and many would rather die.'    'If they would rather die,' said Scrooge, 'they had better do it, and  decrease the surplus population. Besides--excuse me--I don't know that.'    'But you might know it,' observed the gentleman.    'It's not my business,' Scrooge returned. 'It's enough for a man to  understand his own business, and not to interfere with other people's.  Mine occupies me constantly. Good afternoon, gentlemen!'    Seeing clearly that it would be useless to pursue their point, the  gentlemen withdrew. Scrooge resumed his labours with an improved opinion  of himself, and in a more facetious temper than was usual with him.    Meanwhile the fog and darkness thickened so, that people ran about with  flaring links, proffering their services to go before horses in  carriages, and conduct them on their way. The ancient tower of a church,  whose gruff old bell was always peeping slyly down at Scrooge out of a  Gothic window in the wall, became invisible, and struck the hours and  quarters in the clouds, with tremulous vibrations afterwards, as if its  teeth were chattering in its frozen"]]]
