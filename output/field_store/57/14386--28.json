Our first volume closed with the period when the American people stood  waiting with apprehension the signal of the coming conflict between  the Northern and Southern States. On April 12, 1861, the first gun was  fired on Sumter, and on the 14th it was surrendered. On the 15th, the  President called out 75,000 militia, and summoned Congress to meet  July 4th, when 400,000 men and $400,000,000 were voted to carry on the  war.    These startling events roused the entire people, and turned the  current of their thoughts in new directions. While the nation's life  hung in the balance, and the dread artillery of war drowned alike the  voices of commerce, politics, religion and reform, all hearts were  filled with anxious forebodings, all hands were busy in solemn  preparations for the awful tragedies to come.    At this eventful hour the patriotism of woman shone forth as fervently  and spontaneously as did that of man; and her self-sacrifice and  devotion were displayed in as many varied fields of action. While he  buckled on his knapsack and marched forth to conquer the enemy, she  planned the campaigns which brought the nation victory; fought in the  ranks when she could do so without detection; inspired the sanitary  commission; gathered needed supplies for the grand army; provided  nurses for the hospitals; comforted the sick; smoothed the pillows of  the dying; inscribed the last messages of love to those far away; and  marked the resting-places where the brave men fell. The labor women  accomplished, the hardships they endured, the time and strength they  sacrificed in the war that summoned three million men to arms, can  never be fully appreciated.    Think of the busy hands from the Atlantic to the Pacific, making  garments, canning fruits and vegetables, packing boxes, preparing lint  and bandages[1] for soldiers at the front; think of the mothers, wives  and daughters on the far-off prairies, gathering in the harvests, that  their fathers, husbands, brothers, and sons might fight the battles of  freedom; of those month after month walking the wards of the hospital;  and those on the battle-field at the midnight hour, ministering to the  wounded and dying, with none but the cold stars to keep them company.    Think of the multitude of delicate, refined women, unused to care and  toil, thrown suddenly on their own resources, to struggle evermore  with poverty and solitude; their hopes and ambitions all freighted in  the brave young men that marched forth from their native hills, with  flying flags and marshal music, to return no more forever. The  untiring labors, the trembling apprehensions, the wrecked hopes, the  dreary solitude of the fatherless, the widowed, the childless in that  great national upheaval, have never been measured or recorded; their  brave deeds never told in story or in song, no monuments built to  their memories, no immortal wreaths to mark their last resting-places.    How much easier it is to march forth with gay companions and marshal  music; with the excitement of the battle, the camp, the ever-shifting  scenes of war, sustained by the hope of victory; the promise of  reward; the ambition for distinction; the fire of patriotism kindling  every thought, and stimulating every nerve and muscle to action! How  much easier is all this, than to wait and watch alone with nothing to  stimulate hope or ambition.    The evils of bad government fall ever most heavily on the mothers of  the race, who, however wise and far-seeing, have no voice in its  administration, no power to protect themselves and their children  against a male dynasty of violence and force.    While the mass of women never philosophize on the principles that  underlie national existence, there were those in our late war who  understood the political significance of the struggle: the  \"irrepressible conflict\" between freedom and slavery; between national  and State rights. They saw that to provide lint, bandages, and  supplies for the army, while the war was not conducted on a wise  policy, was labor in vain; and while many organizations, active,  vigilant, self-sacrificing, were multiplied to look after the  material wants of the army, these few formed themselves into a  National Loyal League to teach sound principles of government, and to  press on the nation's conscience, that \"freedom to the slaves was the  only way to victory.\" Accustomed as most women had been to works of  charity, to the relief of outward suffering, it was difficult to rouse  their enthusiasm for an idea, to persuade them to labor for a  principle. They clamored for practical work, something for their hands  to do; for fairs, sewing societies"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/28056"],[0,"Music and Some Highly Musical People (#2)"],[1,"316-321    CHICAGO                                                        321-323    THE MUSIC OF THE SOUTH                                         324-329    BALTIMORE                                                      329-330    LOUISVILLE                                                         330    ST.

A DESCRIPTION OF MUSIC.         \"In the storm, in the smoke, in the fight, I come       To help thee, dear, with my fife and my drum.       My name is Music: and, when the bell       Rings for the dead men, I rule the knell;       And, whenever the mariner wrecked through the blast       Hears the fog-bell sound, it was I who passed.       The poet hath told you how I, a young maid,       Came fresh from the gods to the myrtle shade;       And thence, by a power divine, I stole       To where the waters of the Mincius roll;       Then down by Clitumnus and Arno's vale       I wandered, passionate and pale,       Until I found me at sacred Rome,       Where one of the Medici gave me a home.       Leo--great Leo!--he worshipped me,       And the Vatican stairs for my feet were free.       And, now I am come to your glorious land,       Give me good greeting with open hand.       Remember Beethoven,--I gave him his art,--       And Sebastian Bach, and superb Mozart:       Join _those_ in my worship; and, when you go       Wherever their mighty organs blow,       Hear in them heaven's trumpets to men below.\"         T.W. PARSONS.      What is music? Quite easy is it to answer after the manner of the  dictionaries, and say, \"Music is (1) a number of sounds following each  other in a natural, pleasing manner; (2) the science of harmonious  sounds; and (3) the art of so combining them as to please the ear.\"  These are, however, only brief, cold, and arbitrary definitions: music  is far more than as thus defined. Indeed, to go no farther in the  description of this really sublime manifestation of the beautiful  would be to very inadequately express its manifold meanings, its  helpful, delightful uses. And yet the impressions made upon the mind  and the depth of feeling awakened in the heart by music are such as to  render only a partial (a far from satisfying one) description of the  same possible, even to those most skilful and eloquent in the use of  language; for, in fact, ordinary language, after exhausting all of its  many resources in portraying the mind's conceptions, in depicting the  heart's finer, deeper feelings, reveals, after all, its poverty, when  sought to describe effects so entrancing, and emotions so  deep-reaching, as those produced by music. No: the latter must be  heard, it must be felt, its sweetly thrilling symphonies must touch  the heart and fill the senses, in order that it may be, in its  fulness, appreciated; for then it is that music is expressed in a  language of most subtle power,--a language all its own, and universal,  bearing with it ever an exquisitely touching pathos and sweetness that  all mankind may feel.    And so I may not hope to bring here to the reader's mind more than a  slight conception of what music is. Nor does he stand in need of any  labored effort to teach him the nature and power, the beneficent  attributes, of this beautiful art. With his own soul attuned to all  the delightful sounds of melody and harmony that everywhere about him,  in nature and in art, he constantly hears, the reader requires no  great length of words in explanation of that which he so deeply feels,  and therefore already understands. Nevertheless, a due regard for the  laws of unity, as well as a sincere wish to make this volume, in all  its departments, speak the befitting words of tribute to the  love-inspiring art of which it aims to treat,--words which, although  they may not have the merit of affording great instruction, may at  least have that of furnishing to the reader some degree of  pleasure,--these are the motives that must serve as an excuse for the  little that follows.    I have sometimes thought that only the elevated and elegant language  of poetry should be employed in describing music: for music is poetry,  and poetry is music; that is, in many of their characteristics they  are one and the same. But, to put this idea in another form, let us  say that Music is the beautiful sister of Poetry, that other  soul-expressing medium; and who would create the latter must commune  with the former, and be able to bring to his uses the sweet and  finishing graces of her rhythmic forms. In early times, the qualities  of the poet and musician were generally actually united in the same  person. The poet usually set to music, and in most instances sang, his  effusions. Nor to this day have the         \"Poets, who on earth have made us heirs       Of truth and pure delight by heavenly lays,\"    ceased to sing, in bewitching verse, the noble qualities of music.    I have said that music speaks a language all its own, and one that is  universal. Bring together a representation of all the nations of the  earth, in which body there shall be a very Babel of tongues. All will  be confusion until the all-penetrating, the all-thrilling voice of  music is heard. At once, silence reigns; each ear quickly catches and  recognizes the delicious sounds. The language of each one in the  concourse may be different: but with \"music's golden tongue\" all are  alike innately acquainted; each heart beats in sympathy with the  delightful, absorbing tones of melody; and all seem members of one  nation.    Again: music may be called that strangely peculiar form of the  beautiful, whose presence seems, indeed is, appropriate on occasions  the most diverse in character. Its aid is sought alike to add to the  joys of festive scenes, to soothe and elevate the heart on occasions  of mourning, and to enhance the solemnity, the excellence, of divine  worship.    The poet Collins, aptly associating music with the good and beautiful,  calls it the \"heavenly maid.\"    Martin Luther, himself a musical composer and performer of merit,  paused in his great work of religious reform to declare, \"I verily  think, and am not ashamed to say, that, next to divinity, no art is  comparable to music.\" And Disraeli utters this noble thought: \"Were it  not for music, we might in these days say the beautiful is dead.\"         \"Touching musical harmony, whether by instrument or by       voice, it being but of high and low in sounds a       proportionable disposition, such, notwithstanding, is the       force thereof, and so pleasing effects it hath in that part       of man which is most divine, that some have thereby been       induced to think that the soul itself is or hath in it       harmony: a thing which delighteth all ages, and beseemeth       all states; a thing as seasonable in grief as in joy; as       decent being added unto actions of greatest weight and       solemnity as being used when men most sequester themselves       from action. The reason hereof is an admirable facility       which music hath to express and represent to the mind, more       inwardly than any other sensible means, the very steps and       inflections of every way, the turns and varieties of all       passion whereunto the mind is subject.\"[1]         \"I would fain know what music is. I seek it as a man seeks       eternal wisdom. Yesterday evening I walked, late in the       moonlight, in the beautiful avenue of lime-trees on the bank       of the Rhine; and I heard a tapping noise and soft singing.       At the door of a cottage, under the blooming lime-tree, sat       a mother and her twin-babies: the one lay at her breast, the       other in a cradle, which she rocked with her foot, keeping       time to her singing. In the very germ, then, when the first       trace of life begins to stir, music is the nurse of the       soul: it murmurs in the ear, and the child sleeps; the tones       are the companions of his dreams; they are the world in       which he lives. He has nothing; the babe, although cradled       in his mother's arms, is alone in the spirit: but tones find       entrance into the half-conscious soul, and nourish it as       earth nourishes the life of plants.\"[2]    [Footnote 1: Hooker.]    [Footnote 2: Bertini.]          II.    THE MUSIC OF NATURE.         \"The lark sings loud, and the throstle's song         Is heard from the depths of the hawthorn dale;       And the rush of the streamlet the vales among         Doth blend with the sighs of the whispering gale.\"         MATIN AND EVENING SONGS.      To the inventive genius of man must, of course, be attributed the  present developments, and the beautiful, diversified forms, existing  in musical art. But, before man was, the great Author of harmony had  created what may be called the music of Nature.    Afterwards, the human ear, penetrated by sounds of melody issuing from  wind, wave, or bird, the rapt mind in strange and pleasing wonder  contemplating the new and charming harmonies,--then it was that man  received his first impressions, and took his first lessons in  delightful symphony.    Take from man all creative and performing power in music, leaving him  only"]]]
