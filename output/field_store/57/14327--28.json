BIRDS OF THE ROCKIES          UP AND DOWN THE HEIGHTS      To study the birds from the level plains to the crests of the peaks  swimming in cloudland; to note the species that are peculiar to the  various altitudes, as well as those that range from the lower areas to  the alpine heights; to observe the behavior of all the birds encountered  in the West, and compare their habits, songs, and general deportment  with those of correlated species and genera in the East; to learn as  much as possible about the migratory movements up and down the mountains  as the seasons wax and wane,--surely that would be an inspiring prospect  to any student of the feathered fraternity. For many years one of the  writer's most cherished desires has been to investigate the bird life of  the Rocky Mountains. In the spring of 1899, and again in 1901, fortune  smiled upon him in the most genial way, and--in a mental state akin to  rapture, it must be confessed--he found himself rambling over the plains  and mesas and through the deep canyons, and clambering up the dizzy  heights, in search of winged rarities.    In this chapter attention will be called to a few general facts relative  to bird life in the Rockies, leaving the details for subsequent recital.  As might be expected, the towering elevations influence the movements of  the feathered tenants of the district. There is here what might be  called a vertical migration, aside from the usual pilgrimages north and  south which are known to the more level portions of North America. The  migratory journeys up and down the mountains occur with a regularity  that amounts to a system; yet so far as regards these movements each  species must be studied for itself, each having manners that are all its  own.    In regions of a comparatively low altitude many birds, as is well known,  hie to the far North to find the proper climatic conditions in which to  rear their broods and spend their summer vacation, some of them going to  the subarctic provinces and others beyond. How different among the  sublime heights of the Rockies! Here they are required to make a journey  of only a few miles, say from five to one hundred or slightly more,  according to the locality selected, up the defiles and canyons or over  the ridges, to find the conditions as to temperature, food, nesting  sites, etc., that are precisely to their taste. The wind blowing down to  their haunts from the snowy summits carries on its wings the same  keenness and invigoration that they would find if they went to British  America, where the breezes would descend from the regions of snow and  ice beyond the Arctic Circle.    [Illustration: _White-Crowned Sparrows_]    It will add a little spice of detail if we take a concrete case. There  is the handsome and lyrical white-crowned sparrow; in my native State,  Ohio, this bird is only a migrant, passing for the summer far up into  Canada to court his mate and rear his family. Now remember that Colorado  is in the same latitude as Ohio; but the Buckeye State, famous as it is  for furnishing presidents, has no lofty elevations, and therefore no  white-crowns as summer residents. However, Colorado may claim this  distinction, as well as that of producing gold and silver, and  furnishing some of the sublimest scenery on the earth; for on the side  of Pike's Peak, in a green, well-watered valley just below timber-line,  I was almost thrown into transports at finding the white-crowns,  listening to their rhythmic choruses, and discovering their grass-lined  nests by the side of the babbling mountain brook. Altitude accomplishes  for these birds what latitude does for their brothers and sisters of  eastern North America.    There is almost endless variety in the avi-faunal life of the Rockies.  Some species breed far above timber-line in the thickets that invade the  open valleys, or clamber far up the steep mountain sides. Others ascend  still higher, building their nests on the bald summits of the loftiest  peaks at an altitude of fourteen thousand feet and more, living all  summer long in an atmosphere that is as rare as it is refreshing and  pure. Among these alpine dwellers may be mentioned the brown-capped  leucostictes, which shall be accorded the attention they deserve in  another chapter. Then, there are species which have representatives both  on the plains and far up in the mountain parks and valleys, such as the  western robin, the western meadow-lark, and the mountain bluebird.    In this wonderful country there is to be observed every style of  migratory habit. A twofold migrating current must be noticed. While  there is a movement up and down the mountain heights, there is at the  same time a movement north and south, making the migratory system a  perfect network of lines of travel. Some species summer in the  mountains and winter on the plains; others summer in the mountains pass  down to the plains in the autumn, then wing their way farther south into  New Mexico, Mexico, Central America, and even South America, where they  spend the winter, reversing this order on their return to the north in  the spring; others simply pass through this region in their vernal and  autumnal pilgrimages, stopping for a short time, but spending neither  the summer nor the winter in this latitude; still others come down from  the remote north on the approach of autumn, and winter in this State,  either on the plains or in the sheltering ravines and forests of the  mountains, and then return to the north in the spring; and, lastly,  there are species that remain here all the year round, some of them in  the mountains, others on the plains, and others again in both  localities. A number of hardy birds--genuine feathered Norsemen--brave  the arctic winters of the upper mountain regions, fairly revelling in  the swirling snow-storms, and it must be a terrific gale indeed that  will drive them down from their favorite habitats toward the plains.    Does the avi-fauna of the Rocky Mountain district differ widely from  that of the Eastern States? The reply must be made in the affirmative.  Therefore the first work of the bird-student from the East will be that  of a tyro--the identification of species. For this purpose he must have  frequent recourse to the useful manuals of Coues and Ridgway, and to the  invaluable brochure of Professor Wells W. Cooke on the \"Birds of  Colorado.\" In passing, it may be said that the last-named gentleman  might almost be called the Colorado Audubon or Wilson.    In studying the birds of the West, one should note that there are  western subspecies and varieties, which differ in some respects, though  not materially, from their eastern cousins; for instance, the western  robin, the western chipping sparrow, the western lark sparrow, and the  western nighthawk. Besides, intermediate forms are to be met with and  classified, the eastern types shading off in a very interesting process  into the western. It would be impossible for any one but a systematist  with the birds in hand to determine where the intermediate forms become  either typical easterners or typical westerners.    Most interesting of all to the rambler on avian lore intent is the fact  that there are many species and genera that are peculiar to the West,  and therefore new to him, keeping him constantly on the _qui vive_. In  Colorado you will look in vain for the common blue jay, so abundant in  all parts of the East; but you will be more than compensated by the  presence of seven other species of the jay household. The woodpeckers of  the West (with one exception) are different from those of the East, and  so are the flycatchers, the grosbeaks, the orioles, the tanagers, the  humming-birds, and many of the sparrows. Instead of the purple and  bronzed grackles (the latter are sometimes seen on the plains of  Colorado, but are not common), the Rockies boast of Brewer's blackbird,  whose habits are not as prosaic as his name would indicate. \"Jim Crow\"  shuns the mountains for reasons satisfactory to himself; not so the  magpie, the raven, and that mischief-maker, Clark's nutcracker. All of  which keeps the bird-lover from the East in an ecstasy of surprises  until he has become accustomed to his changed environment.    One cannot help falling into the speculative mood in view of the sharp  contrasts between the birds of the East and those of the West. Why does  the hardy and almost ubiquitous blue jay studiously avoid the western  plains and mountains? Why do not the magpie and the long-crested jay  come east? What is there that prevents the indigo-bird from taking up  residence in Colorado, where his pretty western cousin, the lazuli  finch, finds himself so much at home? Why is the yellow-shafted flicker  of the East replaced in the West by the red-shafted flicker? These  questions are more easily asked than answered. From the writer's present  home in eastern Kansas it is only six hundred miles to the foot of the  Rockies; yet the avi-fauna of eastern Kansas is much more like that of  the Eastern and New England States than that of the Colorado region.    Perhaps the reason is largely, if not chiefly, physiological. Evidently  there are birds that flourish best in a rare, dry atmosphere, while  others naturally thrive in an atmosphere that is denser and more humid.  The same is true of people. Many persons find the climate of Colorado  especially adapted to their needs; indeed, to certain classes of  invalids it is a veritable"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/25990"],[0,"Bird Houses Boys Can Build (#2)"],[1," the rustic type made of (a)  slabs of wood with the bark left on, or (b) pieces of tree trunk, or  (c) of sawed lumber trimmed with bark or twigs; and (3) cement or  stucco houses. In each case the entrance should slant slightly upward  to keep the rain out.    [Illustration: FIG. 10. WREN HOUSES.]    Almost any sort of lumber may be used, but birds take most readily to  that which has been weathered out of doors. A kind should be used  which does not warp or check badly; white pine and cypress meet these  requirements and are worked with ease. Yellow poplar is used and cedar  with or without the bark left on has its friends for houses of the  first or second classes.    Nesting boxes of sawed lumber should be painted on the outside to  improve their appearance and to preserve them against the effect of  the weather. It is often wise to leave a small amount of unpainted  surface around the entrance, and all paint should be thoroughly dry  before houses are expected to be occupied. Colors selected will depend  somewhat upon the neighborhood, but white, grey, dull greens or browns  are often used.      DIMENSIONS OF NESTING BOXES.    The following table, copied from Farmers Bulletin, No. 609, U. S.  Dept. of Agriculture, gives in small space valuable information about  dimensions that experience and investigation have indicated as good  for particular varieties of birds. This list includes many varieties  that do not commonly live in houses built for them, however. As time  goes on, we may expect to find more of these birds living in our  nesting boxes because they are apt to seek the same sort of home as  the one in which they were reared. The table is given to be of service  to those wishing to plan new houses not shown here.    _Dimensions of nesting boxes for various species of birds._    =================+==========+==========+==========+==========+=========                   |   Floor  |   Depth  | Entrance | Diameter |  Height      Species.     |    of    |    of    |  above   |    of    |  above                   |  cavity. |  cavity. |  floor.  | entrance.|  ground.  -----------------+----------+----------+----------+----------+---------                   | _Inches._| _Inches._| _Inches._| _Inches._|  _Feet._  Bluebird         |  5 by  5 |        8 |       6  |   1-1/2  |  5 to 10  Robin            |  6 by  8 |        8 |   [1]    |   [1]    |  6 to 15  Chickadee        |  4 by  4 |  8 to 10 |       8  |   1-1/8  |  6 to 15  Tufted titmouse  |  4 by  4 |  8 to 10 |       8  |   1-1/4  |  6 to 15  White-breasted   |          |          |          |          |          nuthatch |  4 by  4 |  8 to 10 |       8  |   1-1/4  | 12 to 20  House wren       |  4 by  4 |  6 to  8 | 1 to  6  |     7/8  |  6 to 10  Bewick wren      |  4 by  4 |  6 to  8 | 1 to  6  |   1      |  6 to 10  Carolina wren    |  4 by  4 |  6 to  8 | 1 to  6  |   1-1/8  |  6 to 10  Dipper           |  6 by  6 |        6 |       1  |   3      |  1 to  3  Violet-green     |          |          |          |          |           swallow |  5 by  5 |        6 | 1 to  6  |   1-1/2  | 10 to 15  Tree swallow     |  5 by  5 |        6 | 1 to  6  |   1-1/2  | 10 to 15  Barn swallow     |  6 by  6 |        6 |   [1]    |   [1]    |  8 to 12  Martin           |  6 by  6 |        6 |       1  |   2-1/2  | 15 to 20  Song sparrow     |  6 by  6 |        6 |   [2]    |   [2]    |  1 to  3  House finch      |  6 by  6 |        6 |       4  |   2      |  8 to 12  Phoebe           |  6 by  6 |        6 |   [1]    |   [1]    |  8 to 12  Crested          |          |          |          |          |        flycatcher |  6 by  6 |  8 to 10 |       8  |   2      |  8 to 20  Flicker          |  7 by  7 | 16 to 18 |      16  |   2-1/2  |  6 to 20  Red-headed       |          |          |          |          |        woodpecker |  6 by  6 | 12 to 15 |      12  |   2      | 12 to 20  Golden-fronted   |          |          |          |          |        woodpecker |  6 by  6 | 12 to 15 |      12  |   2      | 12 to 20  Hairy woodpecker |  6 by  6 | 12 to 15 |      12  |   1-1/2  | 12 to 20  Downy woodpecker |  4 by  4 |  8 to 10 |       8  |   1-1/4  |  6 to 20  Screech owl      |  8 by  8 | 12 to 15 |      12  |   3      | 10 to 30  Sparrow hawk     |  8 by  8 | 12 to 15 |      12  |   3      | 10 to 30  Saw-whet owl     |  6 by  6 | 10 to 12 |      10  |   2-1/2  | 12 to 20  Barn owl         | 10 by 18 | 15 to 18 |       4  |   6      | 12 to 18  Wood duck        | 10 by 18 | 10 to 15 |       3  |   6      |  4 to 20  -----------------+----------+----------+----------+----------+---------    [Footnote 1: One or more sides open.]    [Footnote 2: All sides open.]      HOUSES OF SAWED LUMBER.    The boy with an outfit of tools at home, or with a teacher of manual  training interested in birds, can make all of the houses to be  described in this section. Figs. 10 and 11 show simple houses for  wrens and bluebirds. Drawings for this type of house are shown in  Figs. 14, 15 and 21. While the surfaces of lumber used for these  houses may or may not be planed, care must be taken that all pieces  are sawed or planed to the correct sizes with edges and ends square  and true so there will be no bad cracks for drafts and rain to enter.  Be careful to nail the pieces together so that they will not have  occasion to crack or warp. A good way to save time and lumber is to  prepare a piece of stock, getting it of the right thickness, width and  length, and then to saw up this stock on lines carefully laid out as  shown in the drawings of the bluebird and wren houses, flicker nest,  robin shelf and finch house. The most difficult houses to build are  those for martins. In Fig. 45 is given a drawing for a small home  arranged to care for eight families, while the photographs, Figs. 8,  9, 38, 66 and 67 show larger, finer and more difficult houses. The  doors or openings are 2-1/2\" in diameter and can be made with an  expansion bit or a key-hole saw. All of these houses are to be made so  they may be cleaned. Sometimes the bottom is hinged on two screws or  nails, and held in proper place by a dowel (bluebird house, Fig. 21);  or screwed in place (wren house, Fig. 21, and martin house, Fig. 45);  or hinged and held in place by a brass spring (wren house, Fig. 14).    [Illustration: FIG. 11. HOUSES FOR WRENS AND BLUEBIRDS.]    [Illustration: FIG. 12. RUSTIC HOUSES.]      RUSTIC HOUSES.    The first group of houses of this type are shown in Figs. 12, 35 and  36. These are made of slabs of wood with the bark left on, and in some  cases, of the bark alone if it can be secured of sufficient thickness.  It is usually a good plan to drive a sufficient number of nails into  the bark to keep it in place, otherwise it will drop off. Houses such  as these attract birds that would avoid a freshly painted imitation of  some large residence or public building. Figs. 20 and 37 show houses  made of a section of a tree split or sawed in halves, the nest cavity  hollowed out, and then fastened together again with screws. The top  should be covered with a board or piece of tin to keep out rain. The  third division of this type of house is made of sawed lumber and then  trimmed with bark or twigs. In this way the same frames may be made to  appear as very different bird houses when completed. Such houses are  shown in Figs. 30 to 34. Sometimes a pail is used for the frame and  then covered with bark, as the center house of Fig. 28. This house has  a partition placed half-way up making it a two family apartment, and  is provided with ventilating and cleaning devices.      CEMENT AND STUCCO HOUSES.    Houses may be cast of concrete as Fig. 39. This requires a mold or  form, and takes considerable planning to insure success. A form is  made whose inside dimensions are those of the outside of the bird  house, and of the desired shape. A second form, or core, to be placed  inside of the first form, is made as large as the inside of the bird  house. The two forms must be mounted so they will remain in the right  relation while concrete is placed in the space between them. After  this has set, the forms may be removed, cleaned and used again. The  roof is generally made separately and put in position last. Or the  roof can be cast as a part of the house in which case the bottom is  inserted last. Birds do not take as kindly to this type of house as a  rule, as to those made of wood.    [Illustration: FIG. 13. STUCCO HOUSE FOR MARTINS.]    The stucco house has many possibilities. Fig. 38, shows a group of  such houses designed to match the general appearance of garages in  good residence districts. The frame is made of wood and the stucco  applied by one of the methods in use on large houses. Seventh grade  boys have made such houses, using 3/8\" material for the frames,  tacking on wire netting and then plastering each side of the house in  turn with concrete. The sides were given a pebble-dash surface, while  the roof was finished with a steel trowel to give a smooth surface  that will shed water readily, Fig. 13.    [Illustration: FIG. 14.
