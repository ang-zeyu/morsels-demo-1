[Illustration: IMAGE AT THE FOCUS OF A LENS.]    A very pretty little experiment, which illustrates these two methods of  forming an optical image, and, by way of corollary, exemplifies the  essential difference between refracting and reflecting telescopes, may  be performed by any one who possesses a reading glass and a magnifying  hand mirror. In a room that is not too brightly illuminated pin a sheet  of white paper on the wall opposite to a window that, by preference,  should face the north, or away from the position of the sun. Taking  first the reading glass, hold it between the window and the wall  parallel to the sheet of paper, and a foot or more distant from the  latter. By moving it to and fro a little you will be able to find a  distance, corresponding to the focal length of the lens, at which a  picture of the window is formed on the paper. This picture, or image,  will be upside down, because the rays of light cross at the focus. By  moving the glass a little closer to the wall you will cause the picture  of the window to become indistinct, while a beautiful image of the  houses, trees, or other objects of the outdoor world beyond, will be  formed upon the paper. We thus learn that the distance of the image from  the lens varies with the distance of the object whose image is formed.  In precisely a similar manner an image is formed at the focus of the  object glass of a refracting telescope.    [Illustration: IMAGE AT THE FOCUS OF A CONCAVE MIRROR.]    Take next your magnifying or concave mirror, and detaching the sheet of  paper from the wall, hold it nearly in front of the mirror between the  latter and the window. When you have adjusted the distance to the focal  length of the mirror, you will see an image of the window projected upon  the paper, and by varying the distance, as before, you will be able to  produce, at will, pictures of nearer or more remote objects. It is in  this way that images are formed at the focus of the mirror of a  reflecting telescope.    Now, you will have observed that the chief apparent difference between  these two methods of forming an image of distant objects is that in the  first case the rays of light, passing through the transparent lens, are  brought to a focus on the side opposite to that where the real object  is, while in the second case the rays, being reflected from the  brilliant surface of the opaque mirror, come to a focus on the same side  as that on which the object itself is. From this follows the most  striking difference in the method of using refracting and reflecting  telescopes. In the refractor the observer looks toward the object; in  the reflector he looks away from it. Sir William Herschel made his great  discoveries with his back to the sky. He used reflecting telescopes.  This principle, again, can be readily illustrated by means of our simple  experiment with a reading glass and a magnifying mirror. Hold the  reading glass between the eye and a distant object with one hand, and  with the other hand place a smaller lens such as a pocket magnifier,  near the eye, and in line with the reading glass. Move the two carefully  until they are at a distance apart equal to the sum of the focal lengths  of the lenses, and you will see a magnified image of the distant object.  In other words, you have constructed a simple refracting telescope. Then  take the magnifying mirror, and, turning your back to the object to be  looked at, use the small lens as before--that is to say, hold it between  your eye and the mirror, so that its distance from the latter is equal  to the sum of the focal lengths of the mirror and the lens, and you will  see again a magnified image of the distant object. This time it is a  reflecting telescope that you hold in your hands.    The magnification of the image reminds us of the second purpose which is  subserved by a telescope. A telescope, whether refracting or reflecting,  consists of two essential parts, the first being a lens, or a mirror, to  form an image, and the second a microscope, called an eyepiece, to  magnify the image. The same eyepieces will serve for either the  reflector or the refractor. But in order that the magnification may be  effective, and serve to reveal what could not be seen without it, the  image itself must be as nearly perfect as possible; this requires that  every ray of light that forms the image shall be brought to a point in  the image precisely corresponding to that from which it emanates in the  real object. In reflectors this is effected by giving a parabolic form  to the concave surface of the mirror. In refractors there is a twofold  difficulty to be overcome. In the first place, a lens with spherical  surfaces does not bend all the rays that pass through it to a focus at  precisely the same distance. The rays that pass near the outer edge of  the lens have a shorter focus than that of the rays which pass near the  center of the lens; this is called spherical aberration. A similar  phenomenon occurs with a concave mirror whose surface is spherical. In  that case, as we have seen, the difficulty is overcome by giving the  mirror a parabolic instead of a spherical form. In an analogous way the  spherical aberration of a lens can be corrected by altering its curves,  but the second difficulty that arises with a lens is not so easily  disposed of: this is what is called chromatic aberration. It is due to  the fact that the rays belonging to different parts of the spectrum  have different degrees of refrangibility, or, in other words, that they  come to a focus at different distances from the lens; and this is  independent of the form of the lens. The blue rays come to a focus  first, then the yellow, and finally the red. It results from this  scattering of the spectral rays along the axis of the lens that there is  no single and exact focus where all meet, and that the image of a star,  for instance, formed by an ordinary lens, even if the spherical  aberration has been corrected, appears blurred and discolored. There is  no such difficulty with a mirror, because there is in that case no  refraction of the light, and consequently no splitting up of the  elements of the spectrum.    In order to get around the obstacle formed by chromatic aberration it is  necessary to make the object glass of a refractor consist of two lenses,  each composed of a different kind of glass. One of the most interesting  facts in the history of the telescope is that Sir Isaac Newton could see  no hope that chromatic aberration would be overcome, and accordingly  turned his attention to the improvement of the reflecting telescope and  devised a form of that instrument which still goes under his name. And  even after Chester More Hall in 1729, and John Dollond in 1757, had  shown that chromatic aberration could be nearly eliminated by the  combination of a flint-glass lens with one of crown glass, William  Herschel, who began his observations in 1774, devoted his skill entirely  to the making of reflectors, seeing no prospect of much advance in the  power of refractors.    A refracting telescope which has been freed from the effects of  chromatic aberration is called achromatic. The principle upon which its  construction depends is that by combining lenses of different dispersive  power the separation of the spectral colors in the image can be  corrected while the convergence of the rays of light toward a focus is  not destroyed. Flint glass effects a greater dispersion than crown glass  nearly in the ratio of three to two. The chromatic combination consists  of a convex lens of crown backed by a concave, or plano-concave, lens of  flint. When these two lenses are made of focal lengths which are  directly proportional to their dispersions, they give a practically  colorless image at their common focus. The skill of the telescope-maker  and the excellence of his work depend upon the selection of the glasses  to be combined and his manipulation of the curves of the lenses.    [Illustration: ACHROMATIC OBJECT GLASS.    _a_, crown glass; _b_, flint glass.]    Now, the reader may ask, \"Since reflectors require no correction for  color dispersion, while that correction is only approximately effected  by the combination of two kinds of lenses and two kinds of glass in a  refractor, why is not the reflector preferable to the refractor?\"    The answer is, that the refractor gives more light and better  definition. It is superior in the first respect because a lens transmits  more light than a mirror reflects. Professor Young has remarked that  about eighty-two per cent of the light reaches the eye in a good  refractor, while \"in a Newtonian reflector, in average condition, the  percentage seldom exceeds fifty per cent, and more frequently is lower  than higher.\" The superiority of the refractor in regard to definition  arises from the fact that any distortion at the surface of a mirror  affects the direction of a ray of light three times as much as the same  distortion would do at the surface of a lens. And this applies equally  both to permanent errors of curvature and to temporary distortions  produced by strains and by inequality of temperature. The perfect  achromatism of a reflector is, of course, a great advantage, but the  chromatic aberration of refractors is now so well corrected that their  inferiority in that respect may be disregarded. It must be admitted that  reflectors are cheaper and easier to make, but, on the other hand, they  require more care, and their mirrors frequently need resilvering, while  an object glass with reasonable care never gets seriously out of order,  and will last for many a lifetime.    Enough has now, perhaps, been said about the respective properties of  object glasses and mirrors, but a word should be added concerning  eyepieces. Without a good eyepiece the best telescope will not perform  well. The simplest of"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/28764"],[0,"Getting Acquainted with the Trees (#2)"],[1,"last is a scientific name with such euphony to it  that it might well become common!), and notice the delicate veining in  the translucent wings. See the graceful lines of the whole thing, and  realize what an abundant provision Dame Nature makes for  reproduction,--for a moderate-sized tree completes many thousands of  these finely formed, greenish yellow, winged samaras, and casts them  loose for the wind to distribute during enough days to secure the best  chances of the season.    This same silver maple is a bone of contention among tree-men, at times.  Some will tell you it is \"coarse\"; and so it is when planted in an  improper place upon a narrow street, allowed to flourish unrestrained  for years, and then ruthlessly cropped off to a headless trunk! But set  it on a broad lawn, or upon a roadside with generous room, and its noble  stature and grace need yield nothing to the most artistic elm of New  England. And in the deep woods it sometimes reaches a majesty and a  dignity that compel admiration. The great maple at Eagles Mere is the  king of the bit of primeval forest yet remaining to that mountain rest  spot. It towers high over mature hemlocks and beeches, and seems well  able to defy future centuries.    But there is another very early maple to watch for, and it is one widely  distributed in the Eastern States. The red or scarlet maple is well  named, for its flowers, not any more conspicuous in form than those of  its close relation, the silver maple, are usually bright red or yellow,  and they give a joyous color note in the very beginning of spring's  overture. Not long are these flowers with us; they fade, only to be  quickly succeeded by even more brilliant samaras, a little more delicate  and refined than those of the silver maple, as well as of the richest  and warmest hue. Particularly in New England does this maple provide a  notable spring color showing.    [Illustration: Young leaves of the red maple]    The leaves of the red maple--it is also the swamp maple of some  localities--as they open to the coaxing of April sun and April  showers, have a special charm. They are properly red, but mingled with  the characteristic color is a whole palette of tints of soft yellow,  bronze and apricot. As the little baby leaflets open, they are shiny and  crinkly, and altogether attractive. One thinks of the more aristocratic  and dwarfed Japanese maples, in looking at the opening of these  red-brown beauties, and it is no pleasure to see them smooth out into  sedate greenness. Again, in fall, a glory of color comes to the leaves  of the red maple; for they illumine the countryside with their scarlet  hue, and, as they drop, form a brilliant thread in the most beautiful of  all carpets--that of the autumn leaves. I think no walk in the really  happy days of the fall maturity of growing things is quite so pleasant  as that which leads one to shuffle through this deep forest floor  covering of oriental richness of hue.    As the ground warms and the sun searches into the hearts of the buds,  the Norway maple, familiar street tree of Eastern cities, breaks into a  wonderful bloom. Very deceptive it is, and taken for the opening foliage  by the casual observer; yet there is, when these flowers first open, no  hint of leaf on the tree, save that of the swelling bud. All that soft  haze of greenish yellow is bloom, and bloom of the utmost beauty. The  charm lies not in boldness of color or of contrast, but at the other  extreme--in the delicacy of differing tints, in the variety of subtle  shades and tones. There are charms of form and of fragrance, too, in  this Norway maple--the flowers are many-rayed stars, and they emit a  faint, spicy odor, noticeable only when several trees are together in  bloom. And these flowers last long, comparatively; so long that the  greenish yellow of the young leaves begins to combine with them before  they fall. The tints of flower and of leaf melt insensibly into each  other, so that, as I have remarked before, the casual observer says,  \"The leaves are out on the Norway maples,\"--not knowing of the great  mass of delightful flowers that have preceded the leaves above his  unseeing eyes. I emphasize this, for I hope some of my readers may be on  the outlook for a new pleasure in early spring--the blooming of this  maple, with flowers so thoroughly distinct and so entirely beautiful.    [Illustration: \"The Norway maple breaks into a wonderful bloom\"]    The samaras to follow on this Norway maple are smaller than those of the  other two maples mentioned, and they hang together at a different angle,  somewhat more graceful. I have often wondered how the designers, who  work to death the pansies, the roses and the violets, have managed to  miss a form or \"motive\" of such value, suggesting at once the near-by  street and far-away Egypt.    [Illustration: Samaras of the sugar maple]    A purely American species, and one of as much economic importance as any  leaf-dropping tree, is the sugar maple, known also as rock maple--one  designation because we can get sweetness from its sap, the other  because of the hardness of its wood. The sugar maples of New England, to  me, are more individual and almost more essentially beautiful than the  famed elms. No saccharine life-blood is drawn from the elm; therefore  its elegance is considered. I notice that we seldom think much of beauty  when it attaches to something we can eat! Who realizes that the common  corn, the American maize, is a stately and elegant plant, far more  beautiful than many a pampered pet of the greenhouse? But this is not a  corn story--I shall hope to be heard on the neglected beauty of many  common things, some day--and we can for the time overlook the syrup of  the sugar maple for its delicate blossoms, coming long after the red and  the silver are done with their flowers. These sugar-maple blooms hang on  slender stems; they come with the first leaves, and are very different  in appearance from the flowers of other maples. The observer will have  no trouble in recognizing them after the first successful attempt, even  though he may be baffled in comparing the maple leaves by the apparent  similarity of the foliage of the Norway, the sugar and the sycamore  maples at certain stages of growth.    [Illustration: A mature sycamore maple]    After all, it is the autumn time that brings this maple most strongly  before us, for it flaunts its banners of scarlet and yellow in the  woods, along the roads, with an insouciant swing of its own. The sugar  possibility is forgotten, and it is a pure autumn pleasure to appreciate  the richness of color, to be soon followed by the more sober cognizance  of the elegance of outline and form disclosed when all the delicate  tracery of twig and bough stands revealed against winter's frosty sky.  The sugar maple has a curious habit of ripening or reddening some of its  branches very early, as if it was hanging out a warning signal to the  squirrels and the chipmunks to hurry along with their storing of nuts  against the winter's need. I remember being puzzled one August morning  as I drove along one of Delaware's flat, flat roads, to know what could  possibly have produced the brilliant, blazing scarlet banner that hung  across a distant wood as if a dozen red flags were being there  displayed. Closer approach disclosed one rakish branch on a sugar maple,  all afire with color, while every other leaf on the tree yet held the  green of summer.    Again in the mountains, one late summer, half a lusty sugar maple set up  a conflagration which, I was informed, presaged its early death. But the  next summer it grew as freely as ever, and retained its sober green  until the cool days and nights; just as if the ebullition of the season  previous was but a breaking out of extra color life, rather than a  suggestion of weakness or death.    [Illustration: Sycamore maple blossoms]    The Norway maple is botanically _Acer platanoides_, really meaning  plane-like maple, from the similarity of its leaves to those of the  European plane. The sycamore maple is _Acer Pseudo-platanus_, which,  being translated, means that old Linnaeus thought it a sort of false  plane-like maple. Both are European species, but both are far more  familiar, as street and lawn trees, to us dwellers in cities than are  many of our purely American species. There is a little difference in the  bark of the two, and the leaves of the sycamore, while almost identical  in form, are darker and thicker than those of the Norway, and they are  whitish underneath, instead of light green. The habit of the two is  twin-like; they can scarcely be distinguished when the leaves are off.  But the flowers are totally different, and one would hardly believe them  to be akin, judging only by appearances. The young leaves of the  sycamore maple are lush and vigorous when the long, grape-like  flower-clusters appear below the twigs. \"Racemes\" they are,  botanically--and that is another truly good scientific word--while the  beautiful Norway maple's flowers must stand the angular designation of  \"corymbs.\" But don't miss looking for the sycamore maple's long,  pendulous racemes. They seem more grape-like than grape blossoms; and  they stay long, apparently, the transition from flower to fruit being  very gradual. I mind me of a sycamore I pass every winter day, with its  dead fruit-clusters, a reminiscence of the flower-racemes, swinging in  the frosty breeze, waiting until the spring push of the life within the  twigs shoves them off.    To be ready to recognize this maple at the right time, it is well to  observe and mark the difference between it and the Norway in the summer  time, noting the leaves and the bark as suggested above.    [Illustration: Flowers of the ash-leaved maple]    Another maple that is different is one variously known as box-elder,  ash-leaved maple, or negundo. Of rapid growth, it makes a lusty,  irregular tree. "]]]
