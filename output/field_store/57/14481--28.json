Then it skips exactly three months without increase. The next  upswing puts the number of reported cases in the thousands, and three  months after _that_, it reaches real pandemic proportions and decimates  the entire human population of Darkover.\"    \"That's about it,\" Forth admitted. They bent together over the folder,  Jay Allison drawing back slightly to avoid touching the other man.    Forth said, \"We Terrans have had a Trade compact on Darkover for a  hundred and fifty-two years. The first outbreak of this 48-year fever  killed all but a dozen men out of three hundred. The Darkovans were  worse off than we were. The last outbreak wasn't quite so bad, but it  was bad enough, I've heard. It has an 87 per cent mortality--for humans,  that is. I understand the trailmen don't die of it.\"    \"The Darkovans call it the trailmen's fever, Dr. Forth, because the  trailmen are virtually immune to it. It remains in their midst as a mild  ailment taken by children. When it breaks out into the virulent form  every 48 years, most of the trailmen are already immune. I took the  disease myself as a child--maybe you heard?\"    Forth nodded. \"You may be the only Terran ever to contract the disease  and survive.\"    \"The trailmen incubate the disease,\" Jay Allison said. \"I should think  the logical thing would be to drop a couple of hydrogen bombs on the  trail cities--and wipe it out for good and all.\"    (Sitting on the Sofa in Forth's dark office, I stiffened with such fury  that he shook my shoulder and muttered, \"Easy, there, man!\")           *       *       *       *       *    Dr. Forth, on the screen, looked annoyed, and Jay Allison said, with a  grimace of distaste, \"I didn't mean that literally. But the trailmen are  not human. It wouldn't be genocide, just an exterminator's job. A public  health measure.\"    Forth looked shocked as he realized that the younger man meant what he  was saying. He said, \"Galactic center would have to rule on whether  they're dumb animals or intelligent non-humans, and whether they're  entitled to the status of a civilization. All precedent on Darkover is  toward recognizing them as men--and good God, Jay, you'd probably be  called as a witness for the defense! How can you say they're not human  after your experience with them? Anyway, by the time their status was  finally decided, half of the recognizable humans on Darkover would be  dead. We need a better solution than that.\"    He pushed his chair back and looked out the window.    \"I won't go into the political situation,\" he said, \"you aren't  interested in Terran Empire politics, and I'm no expert either. But  you'd have to be deaf, dumb and blind not to know that Darkover's been  playing the immovable object to the irresistible force. The Darkovans  are more advanced in some of the non-causative sciences than we are,  and until now, they wouldn't admit that Terra had a thing to contribute.  However--and this is the big however--they do know, and they're willing  to admit, that our medical sciences are better than theirs.\"    \"Theirs being practically non-existent.\"    \"Exactly--and this could be the first crack in the barrier. You may not  realize the significance of this, but the Legate received an offer from  the Hasturs themselves.\"    Jay Allison murmured, \"I'm to be impressed?\"    \"On Darkover you'd damn well better be impressed when the Hasturs sit up  and take notice.\"    \"I understand they're telepaths or something--\"    \"Telepaths, psychokinetics, parapsychs, just about anything else. For  all practical purposes they're the Gods of Darkover. And one of the  Hasturs--a rather young and unimportant one, I'll admit, the old man's  grandson--came to the Legate's office, in person, mind you. He offered,  if the Terran Medical would help Darkover lick the trailmen's fever, to  coach selected Terran men in matrix mechanics.\"    \"Good Lord,\" Jay said. It was a concession beyond Terra's wildest  dreams; for a hundred years they had tried to beg, buy or steal some  knowledge of the mysterious science of matrix mechanics--that curious  discipline which could turn matter into raw energy, and vice versa,  without any intermediate stages and without fission by-products. Matrix  mechanics had made the Darkovans virtually immune to the lure of Terra's  advanced technologies.    Jay said, \"Personally I think Darkovan science is over-rated. But I can  see the propaganda angle--\"    \"Not to mention the humanitarian angle of healing--\"           *       *       *       *       *    Jay Allison gave one of his cold shrugs. \"The real angle seems to be  this; _can_ we cure the 48-year fever?\"    \"Not yet. But we have a lead. During the last epidemic, a Terran  scientist discovered a blood fraction containing antibodies against the  fever--in the trailmen. Isolated to a serum, it might reduce the  virulent 48-year epidemic form to the mild form again. Unfortunately, he  died himself in the epidemic, without finishing his work, and his  notebooks were overlooked until this year. We have 18,000 men, and their  families, on Darkover now, Jay. Frankly, if we lose too many of them,  we're going to have to pull out of Darkover--the big brass on Terra will  write off the loss of a garrison of professional traders, but not of a  whole Trade City colony. That's not even mentioning the prestige we'll  lose if our much-vaunted Terran medical sciences can't save Darkover  from an epidemic. We've got exactly five months. We can't synthesize a  serum in that time. We've got to appeal to the trailmen. And that's why  I called you up here. You know more about the trailmen than any living  Terran. You ought to. You spent eight years in a Nest.\"           *       *       *       *       *    (In Forth's darkened office I sat up straighter, with a flash of  returning memory. Jay Allison, I judged, was several years older than I,  but we had one thing in common; this cold fish of a man shared with  myself that experience of marvelous years spent in an alien world!)    Jay Allison scowled, displeased. \"That was years ago. I was hardly more  than a baby. My father crashed on a Mapping expedition over the  Hellers--God only knows what possessed him to try and take a light plane  over those crosswinds. I survived the crash by the merest chance, and  lived with the trailmen--so I'm told--until I was thirteen or fourteen.  I don't remember much about it. Children aren't particularly observant.\"    Forth leaned over the desk, staring. \"You speak their language, don't  you?\"    \"I used to. I might remember it under hypnosis, I suppose. Why? Do you  want me to translate something?\"    \"Not exactly. We were thinking of sending you on an expedition to the  trailmen themselves.\"    (In the darkened office, watching Jay's startled face, I thought; God,  what an adventure! I wonder--I wonder if they want me to go with him?)    Forth was explaining: \"It would be a difficult trek. You know what the  Hellers are like. Still, you used to climb mountains, as a hobby, before  you went into Medical--\"    \"I outgrew the childishness of hobbies many years ago, sir,\" Jay said  stiffly.    \"We'd get you the best guides we could, Terran and Darkovan. But they  couldn't do the one thing you can do. You _know_ the trailmen, Jay. You  might be able to persuade them to do the one thing they've never done  before.\"    \"What's that?\" Jay Allison sounded suspicious.    \"Come out of the mountains. Send us volunteers--blood donors--we might,  if we had enough blood to work on, be able to isolate the right  fraction, and synthesize it, in time to prevent the epidemic from really  taking hold. Jay, it's a tough mission and it's dangerous as all hell,  but somebody's got to do it, and I'm afraid you're the only qualified  man.\"    \"I like my first suggestion better. Bomb the trailmen--and the  Hellers--right off the planet.\" Jay's face was set in lines of loathing,  which he controlled after a minute, and said, \"I--I didn't mean that.  Theoretically I can see the necessity, only--\" he stopped and swallowed.    \"Please say what you were going to say.\"    \"I wonder if I am as well qualified as you think? No--don't interrupt--I  find the natives of Darkover distasteful, even the humans. As for the  trailmen--\"    (I was getting mad and impatient. I whispered to Forth in the darkness,  \"Shut the damn film off! You couldn't send _that_ guy on an errand like  _that_! I'd rather--\"    (Forth snapped, \"Shut up and listen!\"    (I shut up and the film continued to repeat.)           *       *       *       *       *    Jay Allison was not acting. He was pained and disgusted. Forth wouldn't  let him finish his explanation of why he had refused even to teach in  the Medical college established for Darkovans by the Terran empire. He  interrupted, and he sounded irritated.    \"We know all that. It evidently never occurred to you, Jay, that it's an  inconvenience to us--that all this vital knowledge should lie, purely by  accident, in the hands of the one man who's too damned stubborn to use  it?\"    Jay didn't move an eyelash, where I would have squirmed, \"I have always  been aware of that, Doctor.\"    Forth drew a long breath. \"I'll concede you're not suitable at the  moment, Jay. But what do you know of applied psychodynamics?\"    \"Very little, I'm sorry to say.\" Allison didn't sound sorry, though. He  sounded bored to death with the whole conversation.    \"May I be blunt--and personal?\"    \"Please do. I'm not at all sensitive.\"    \"Basically, then, Doctor Allison, a person as contained and repressed as  yourself usually has a clearly defined subsidiary personality. In  neurotic individuals this complex of personality traits sometimes splits  off, and we get a syndrome known as multiple, or alternate personality.\"    \"I've scanned a few of the classic cases.

Maximal measurements of       these three hatchlings, respectively, are: length of       plastron, 35, 36 and 37 mm; length of carapace, 50, 50 and       52 mm; width of carapace, 44, 45 and 47 mm; depth of shell,       11 mm; width of head, 9 mm. Nine hatchlings from the Pearl       River at Varnado have more (all small) dorsal spots, which       may be ocellate. The dorsal spots and ocelli do not exceed 2       mm in their greatest diameter except that some of those of       TU 17304 are 3 mm; the spots range in number from 38 (TU       17303) to 63 (TU 17304). Maximal measurements of the       smallest and largest specimens, holotype excepted, are:       length of plastron, 30 and 33 mm; length of carapace, 42       and 46 mm; width of carapace, 37 and 43 mm; depth of shell,       9 and 10 mm; width of head, 9 and 10 mm. The holotype       resembles hatchlings from the Escambia River in having       large, non-ocellate dorsal spots 3 mm in greatest diameter,       and larger measurements.         One other specimen (not designated as a paratype),       consisting of a head with a few attached cervical vertebrae,       was obtained on a sand bank of the Escambia River, Florida.       The postocular stripe, bright yellow with black borders, was       especially vivid in this adult male (KU 47116).    [Illustration: FIG. 1. Map of southeastern United States showing record  stations of _Trionyx muticus calvatus_ (solid symbols) and _Trionyx m.  muticus_ (open symbols). Circles indicate specimens examined; triangles  indicate records in the literature. The question mark refers to a  specimen bearing catalogue number 17236 in the collection of Tulane  University (see comments on page 524 concerning No. 17236 from the  Amite River).]         _Range._--_Trionyx m. calvatus_ is known from the Pearl,       Pascagoula and Escambia river drainages and is to be       expected in the Tombigbee-Alabama river drainage (Fig. 1).       Tinkle (1958:41, fig. 53, stippled) has indicated the       probable range of _calvatus_. This subspecies is unknown       from the Mississippi and Tennessee river drainages, which       are inhabited by _T. m. muticus_. The western limit of       distribution is the Pearl River drainage and probably those       streams of the Florida Parishes of Louisiana that drain into       Lake Ponchartrain. The most easterly record of occurrence       for _T. m. calvatus_ is in the Escambia River drainage; the       eastern extent of geographic range is not known.         I have seen three preserved young turtles having the       characteristic spotted pattern from the Pascagoula drainage       in eastern Mississippi. These specimens are uncatalogued and       in the collections at Mississippi Southern College,       Hattiesburg, Mississippi.         There is a specimen of _T. m. muticus_ labeled as from       Mobile, Alabama (MCZ 1596), for which I believe the locality       datum is incorrect. It is a young turtle having a       well-defined pattern on the carapace and is without doubt a       representative of _T. m. muticus_. Mobile is in the large       drainage basin, of the Tombigbee, Black Warrior, Coosa and       Alabama rivers, which is between the Escambia and Pearl       rivers.         Yarrow (1882:28) reported a specimen of _Amyda mutica_, USNM       11630, from Gainesville, Florida. This record was questioned       by Cahn (1937:179), and has been disregarded by subsequent       authors. Stejneger (1944:23) lists this specimen number with       uncertainty from Mt. Carmel, Illinois. The exact geographic       provenance of this specimen is seemingly unknown.         _Habitat._--I have collected eggs of _T. m. calvatus_ on       sand banks of the Escambia River, Florida. The Escambia       River has a sand-gravel bottom, extensive sandy banks, a       moderately-rapid current, and is flanked by a thick riparian       forest. It is approximately 80 feet wide with fallen trees       and brush intermittently emergent along the shoreline. The       sand bar-habitat along the Pearl River has been mentioned by       Anderson (1958:212). All records thus far are from lotic       habitats.         _Comparisons._--_Trionyx m. calvatus_ is most closely       related to _Trionyx m. muticus_. Both subspecies have the       following characteristics: (1) no enlarged tubercles on the       anterior edge of the carapace, (2) no ridge projecting from       the nasal septum, and (3) a smooth carapace in adult males.       These characters distinguish these two subspecies from the       several subspecies of _T. spinifer_, and, except for the       smooth carapace in adult males, from _T. ferox_. Another       feature of _T. m. calvatus_ and _T. m. muticus_, not known       to be definitive or diagnostic but noticed on occasion, is       the pale orange cast, in life, of the dorsal surface of the       carapace and soft parts of the body in young of these       turtles.         The spotted pattern of juveniles of _calvatus_ is easily       distinguished from the pattern of _muticus_ (small dots,       streaks and dashes) figured by Agassiz (1857, vol. 2, pt. 3,       pl. 6, fig. 6), Smith (1950:154, fig. 104), Conant       (1938:192, pl. 21, fig. 1; 1958, pl. 11, opposite p. 94),       and Cahn (1937:177, pl. 24C).         Unfortunately, the distinctive dorsal spotting in young       _calvatus_ becomes obscure or absent in some adults of both       sexes. Spotting in large males is not so well-defined as in       juveniles; it may be absent (TU 17306.3), or indicated by       two obscure spots (KU 17117), but is usually evident, at       least posteriorly. The spotted pattern is absent in large       females, which have a pale, mottled and blotched pattern of       lichen-like figures; dorsal spots are obscure in TU 17305       (length of plastron, 56 mm).         Two additional features are, so far as known, universal in       _calvatus_; these are: (1) the absence of striping on the       dorsal surface of the snout, and (2) the presence of thick,       black borders of the postocular stripe in adult males. These       features have also been observed in some specimens of       _muticus_; their presence in _muticus_ cannot be properly       evaluated at this time, and is seemingly not due to       individual variation. These two characters, however, coupled       with the distinctive juvenile pattern of spots, serve, in       combination, to distinguish _calvatus_ from _muticus_.    _Discussion._--The two populations are recognized as subspecies  because: (1) there is close resemblance, (2) the diagnostic characters  pertaining to pattern are few and superficial, and (3) the geographic  ranges are allopatric, but juxtaposed. It is probable that _muticus_  and _calvatus_ would be capable of interbreeding if they were not  spatially isolated. It should be pointed out, however, that there is no  evidence of intergradation between _muticus_ and _calvatus_ in the  lower Mississippi Valley as has been reported for the subspecies of _T.  spinifer_ (Conant and Goin, 1948), and that the degree of difference  between _calvatus_ and _muticus_ is greater than that between some  subspecies of _T. spinifer_.         _Specimens examined._--All the localities listed below are       plotted on the distribution map (Fig. 1). Only those       specimens of _T. muticus muticus_ are listed that serve to       delimit the range of _T. m. calvatus_. Fortunately, the       identification of the specimens of _muticus_ is certain as       all show the characteristic juvenile pattern, except the       large female, TU 7543, from southeastern Louisiana. USNM       95133-34 (carapaces and plastrons only) and TU 17236 are       females, which lack the diagnostic spotted pattern of       _calvatus_; the former are referred to this subspecies on       geographic grounds (Pearl River at Columbia, Mississippi).       TU 17236, from the Amite River, is dubiously relegated to       _calvatus_ on the supposition that this river and others in       the Lake Ponchartrain drainage will yield the characteristic       juveniles.         _Trionyx m. calvatus_ (33 specimens): TU 13473, 16682,       17301, 17302-.1, KU 47116 (skull only), Escambia River, 2       miles east, 1 mile north Century, Escambia Co., Florida; TU       17303-.4, 17304-.3, Pearl River, Varnado, Washington Par.,       Louisiana; TU 17306-.3, Pearl River, 9 miles south       Monticello, Lawrence Co., Mississippi; TU 16956, KU       47117-19, USNM 7655, Pearl River, vicinity of Monticello,       Lawrence Co., Mississippi; TU 17236?, Amite River, near       Baton Rouge, Louisiana; TU 13795, Bogue Chitto River, Enon,       Washington Par., Louisiana; TU 17305, no data, Louisiana;       USNM 95133-34, Pearl River, Columbia, Marion Co.,       Mississippi; UI 31071, Pearl River, 14 miles northeast       Jackson, Rankin Co., Mississippi; Uncatalogued, see page       523, Leaf River, 3 miles southeast New Augusta, Perry Co.,       Mississippi.         _Trionyx m. muticus_ (6 specimens): TU 5989, Ouachita River,       Monroe, Ouachita Par., Louisiana; TU 7543, Vacherie, St.       James Par., Louisiana; CNHM 7845, Gayles, Caddo Par.,       Louisiana; USNM 92605, Greenville, Washington Co.,       Mississippi; USNM 113228, Jonesville, Catahoula Par.,       Louisiana; USNM 118167, Wheeler Reservoir, Tennessee River,       Alabama.         _=Records in the Literature.=_--USNM 113228, referred to       above as _Trionyx m. muticus_ is listed by Stejneger       (1944:56) as _Amyda s. spinifera_; four of the specimens       listed above (USNM 7655, 92605, 95133-34) are recorded by       Stejneger (_op. cit._:23-34) as _Amyda mutica_.
