If one takes precedence of the other, it is only because by the chances  of time _Saint Alexis_ remains to us, and the forerunners of the  _Chanson de Roland_ are lost. With each species of poetry  _cantilenes_--short lyrico-epic poems--preceded the narrative form.  Both the profane and what may be called the religious _chanson de  geste_ were sung or recited by the same jongleurs--men of a class  superior to the vulgar purveyors of amusement. Gradually the poems  of both kinds expanded in length, and finally prose narrative took  the place of verse.    The Lives of Saints are in the main founded on Latin originals; the  names of their authors are commonly unknown. _Saint Alexis_, a tale  of Syriac origin, possibly the work of Tedbalt, a canon of Vernon,  consists of 125 stanzas, each of five lines which are bound together  by a single assonant rhyme. It tells of the chastity and poverty of  the saint, who flies from his virgin bride, lives among beggars,  returns unrecognised to his father's house, endures the insults of  the servants, and, dying at Rome, receives high posthumous honours;  finally, he is rejoined by his wife--the poet here adding to the  legend--in the presence of God, among the company of the angels. Some  of the sacred poems are derived from the Bible, rhymed versions of  which were part of the jongleur's equipment; some from the apocryphal  gospels, or legends of Judas, of Pilate, of the Cross, or, again,  from the life of the Blessed Virgin. The literary value of these is  inferior to that of the versified Lives of the Saints. About the tenth  century the marvels of Eastern hagiography became known in France,  and gave a powerful stimulus to the devout imagination. A certain  rivalry existed between the claims of profane and religious  literature, and a popular audience for narrative poems designed for  edification was secured by their recital in churches. Wholly fabulous  some of these are--as the legend of St. Margaret--but they were not  on this account the less welcome or the less esteemed. In certain  instances the tale is dramatically placed in the mouth of a narrator,  and thus the way was in a measure prepared for the future  mystery-plays.    More than fifty of these Lives of Saints are known, composed generally  in octosyllabic verse, and varying in length from some hundreds of  lines to ten thousand. In the group which treats of the national saints  of France, an element of history obscured by errors, extravagances,  and anachronisms may be found. The purely legendary matter occupies  a larger space in those derived from the East, in which the religious  ideal is that of the hermit life. The celebrated _Barlaam et Joasaph_,  in which Joasaph, son of a king of India, escaping from his father's  restraints, fulfils his allotted life as a Christian ascetic, is  traceable to a Buddhist source. The narratives of Celtic origin--such  as those of the Purgatory of St. Patrick and the voyages of St.  Brendan--are coloured by a tender mysticism, and sometimes charm us  with a strangeness of adventure, in which a feeling for external  nature, at least in its aspects of wonder, appears. The Celtic saints  are not hermits of the desert, but travellers or pilgrims. Among the  lives of contemporary saints, by far the most remarkable is that of  our English Becket by Garnier de Pont-Sainte-Maxence. Garnier had  himself known the archbishop; he obtained the testimony of witnesses  in England; he visited the places associated with the events of  Becket's life; his work has high value as an historical document;  it possesses a personal accent, rare in such writings; a genuine  dramatic vigour; and great skill and harmonious power in its stanzas  of five rhyming lines.    A body of short poems, inspired by religious feeling, and often  telling of miracles obtained by the intercession of the Virgin or  the saints, is known as _Contes pieux_. Many of these were the work  of Gautier de Coinci (1177-1236), a Benedictine monk; he translates  from Latin sources, but with freedom, adding matter of his own, and  in the course of his pious narratives gives an image, far from  flattering, of the life and manners of his own time. It is he who  tells of the robber who, being accustomed to commend himself in his  adventures to our Lady, was supported on the gibbet for three days  by her white hands, and received his pardon; and of the illiterate  monk who suffered shame because he knew no more than his _Ave Maria_,  but who, when dead, was proved a holy man by the five roses that came  from his mouth in honour of the five letters of Maria's name; and  of the nun who quitted her convent to lead a life of disorder, yet  still addressed a daily prayer to the Virgin, and who, returning after  long years, found that the Blessed Mary had filled her place, and  that her absence was unknown. The collection known as _Vies des Peres_  exhibits the same naivete of pious feeling and imagination. Man is  weak and sinful; but by supernatural aid the humble are exalted,  sinners are redeemed, and the suffering innocent are avenged. Even  Theophile, the priest who sold his soul to the devil, on repentance  receives back from the Queen of Heaven the very document by which  he had put his salvation in pawn. The sinner (_Chevalier au barillet_)  who endeavours for a year to fill the hermit's little cask at running  streams, and endeavours in vain, finds it brimming the moment one  tear of true penitence falls into the vessel. Most exquisite in its  feeling is the tale of the _Tombeur de Notre-Dame_--a poor acrobat--a  jongleur turned monk--who knows not even the _Pater noster_ or the  _Credo_, and can only offer before our Lady's altar his tumbler's  feats; he is observed, and as he sinks worn-out and faint before the  shrine, the Virgin is seen to descend, with her angelic attendants,  and to wipe away the sweat from her poor servant's forehead. If there  be no other piety in such a tale as this, there is at least the piety  of human pity.      II  THE NATIONAL EPIC    Great events and persons, a religious and national spirit, and a  genius for heroic narrative being given, epic literature arises, as  it were, inevitably. Short poems, partly narrative, partly lyrical,  celebrate victories or defeats, the achievements of conquerors or  defenders, and are sung to relieve or to sustain the passion of the  time. The French epopee had its origin in the national songs of the  Germanic invaders of Gaul, adopted from their conquerors by the  Gallo-Romans. With the baptism of Clovis at Reims, and the acceptance  of Christianity by the Franks (496), a national consciousness began  to exist--a national and religious ideal arose. Epic heroes--Clovis,  Clotaire, Dagobert, Charles Martel--became centres for the popular  imagination; an echo of the Dagobert songs is found in _Floovent_,  a poem of the twelfth century; eight Latin lines, given in the _Vie  de Saint Faron_ by Helgaire, Bishop of Meaux, preserve, in their  ninth-century rendering, a fragment of the songs which celebrated  Clotaire II. Doubtless more and more in these lost _cantilenes_ the  German element yielded to the French, and finally the two streams  of literature--French and German--separated; gradually, also, the  lyrical element yielded to the epic, and the _chanson de geste_ was  developed from these songs.    In Charlemagne, champion of Christendom against Islam, a great epic  figure appeared; on his person converged the epic interest; he may  be said to have absorbed into himself, for the imagination of the  singers and the people, the persons of his predecessors, and even,  at a later time, of his successors; their deeds became his deeds,  their fame was merged in his; he stood forth as the representative  of France. We may perhaps regard the ninth century as the period of  the transformation of the _cantilenes_ into the _chansons de geste_;  in the fragment of Latin prose of the tenth century--reduced to prose  from hexameters, but not completely reduced--discovered at La Haye  (and named after the place of its discovery), is found an epic episode  of Carlovingian war, probably derived from a _chanson de geste_ of  the preceding century. In each _chanson_ the _gesta_,[1] the deeds  or achievements of a heroic person, are glorified, and large as may  be the element of invention in these poems, a certain historical basis  or historical germ may be found, with few exceptions, in each. Roland  was an actual person, and a battle was fought at Roncevaux in 778.  William of Orange actually encountered the Saracens at Villedaigne  in 793. Renaud de Montauban lived and fought, not indeed against  Charlemagne, but against Charles Martel. Ogier, Girard de Roussillon,  Raoul de Cambrai, were not mere creatures of the fancy. Even when  the narrative records no historical series of events, it may express  their general significance, and condense into itself something of  the spirit of an epoch. In the course of time, however, fantasy made  a conquest of the historical domain; a way for the triumph of fantasy  had been opened by the incorporation of legend into the narrative,  with all its wild exaggerations, its reckless departures from truth,  its conventional types of character, its endlessly-repeated  incidents of romance--the child nourished by wild beasts, the combat  of unrecognised father and son, the hero vulnerable only in one point,  the vindication of the calumniated wife or maiden; and by the  over-labour of fantasy, removed far from nature and reality, the epic  material was at length exhausted.    [Footnote 1: _Gestes_ meant (1) deeds, (2) their history, (3) the  heroic family.]    The oldest surviving _chanson de geste_ is the SONG OF ROLAND, and  it is also the best.

I. GENERAL ACTIVITIES OF LIVING ORGANISMS.    The casual observer, even if he watches thoughtfully the various  activities of plants and animals, would hardly believe these  activities capable of classification into two general classes. He  notes the germination of the plant seed and its early growth, step by  step approaching a stage of maturity; it blossoms, produces seed, and  if it is an annual plant, withers and dies. If it is a perennial plant  its leaves only, wither and die at the approach of winter, the plant  passing into a resting stage from which it awakes the following spring  to repeat again its annual cycle.    If he observes an animal he finds that it similarly develops to a  stage of maturity, reproduces its kind, withers and dies; but incident  to these general activities he notes numerous others that seem to have  no relation to the activity of the plant. He sees men tilling the  fields, felling the forests, building houses, factories and railroads;  he sees them build hospitals, colleges and churches. Is it possible to  group all of these activities of plants and animals into two general  groups? A more critical view of these activities makes it evident that  they are all directed either to the maintenance and protection of the  individual, or the maintenance and protection of the race. Those  directed towards the maintenance of self are called egoistic  activities, while those directed to the maintenance of the race are  called _phyletic activities_.      The Egoistic Activities.    The term egoistic implies that the effort is directed towards the ego  or self, and includes all of those activities directed to the support,  protection, defense and development of oneself. As illustrated in the  plant organism, the taking of nourishment from the air and soil, the  development of the stem, branches, roots and leaves, are egoistic  activities. In the animal--we may take, for example, man--the egoistic  activities begin with the drawing of nourishment from the mother's  breast and include all those activities of early childhood usually  called play, the real significance of which is to develop the  neuro-muscular system and the special senses, to that condition of  alertness and strength that will make the growing individual  self-supporting. A very large part of the activities of the  self-supporting human subject are directed towards the earning of his  daily bread, and of clothing and shelter. The activities of the school  and college period, devoted, as they are, almost exclusively to the  development of the youth's powers, intellectual or physical, are also  egoistic. Even the pursuit of pleasure and of sense gratification on  the part of the individual belongs to this same group of activities.      The Phyletic Activities.    As the etymology of the term suggests, these activities are devoted to  the propagation, maintenance and protection of the race.    a. =Reproduction.=--The most fundamental one of the activities for the  maintenance of the race is reproduction. Every living organism,  whether plant or animal, possesses the power to reproduce its kind.  Some plants produce spores and some produce seeds. Reference was made  above to the production of the flower in plants. The flower represents  the reproductive organ of the plant, and the real object of the flower  is to produce the seed. Animals produce eggs from which the young  develop, either through a process of incubation outside of a maternal  body or an analogous process within the maternal body. In the latter  case the young are brought forth as living organisms.    b. =Support and Protection of Offspring.=--Whether we consider the  plant seed, or the animal egg or newborn--in any case the parental  organism must provide for the support and protection of the offspring  during those stages of development when it is unable to support and  protect itself.    The plant deposits in or about the seed a supply of nourishment  sufficient to support it during the germinating process and until it  is able to gain its own support from the soil and air. Furthermore,  the plant protects the seed by means of the various seed envelopes,  against the cold and moisture of winter.    In a similar way the young animal is supplied by its parents with  nourishment. The young bird is incubated within the egg where a supply  of nourishment is provided sufficient to develop the bones, muscles,  nervous system, blood, glands and covering--all developed to a point  that makes the bird able to take from the mother during the early  weeks after its release from the shell, such nourishment as the mother  may provide. In the meantime it must be brooded and protected in the  parental nest until it is able to provide for its own protection.  Similarly the young mammal is developed within the body of the  maternal organism to a point where it is able to perform the primitive  functions of life. For weeks, months or even years, according to the  class of the animal, it must be supported and protected by its  parents. The human young receives milk from its mother's breast and  protection in its mother's arms during its first year, after which it  continues to receive nourishment, clothing and protection under the  parental roof for a period varying from eighteen to twenty years, or  even longer.    c. =Support and Protection of Weaker Members of Society.=--Young  animals are supported and protected because they are unable to support  and protect themselves. If they were not thus cared for the race would  become extinct. Now, there are certain individuals, orphans for  example, who have, through some accident,"]]]
