In general, large pieces of glass should be heated very  slowly in the smoky flame, and the larger the diameter of the tube the  greater the length which must be kept warm to prevent cracking. All  large pieces should be carefully heated over their whole circumference  to the point where the soot deposit burns off, before being finally  cooled. After being thus heated they are cooled in a large smoky flame  until well coated with soot, then the flame is gradually reduced in size  and the object finally cooled in the hot air above it until it will not  set fire to cotton. If thought necessary, it may then be well wrapped in  cotton and allowed to cool in the air. If not properly annealed the  place heated may crack spontaneously when cold, and it is quite certain  to crack if it is reheated later.    Next in importance to the glass are the blow-pipe and the bellows. Any  good blast lamp, such as is ordinarily used in a chemical laboratory for  the ignition of precipitates, will be satisfactory; provided it gives a  smooth regular flame of sufficient size for the work in hand, and when  turned down will give a sharp-pointed flame with well-defined parts.  Where gas is not available, an ordinary gasoline blow-torch does very  well for all operations requiring a large flame, and a mouth blow-pipe  arranged to blow through a kerosene flame does well for a small flame.  Several dealers make blow-torches for oil or alcohol which are arranged  to give a small well-defined flame, and they would doubtless be very  satisfactory for glass-work. Any good bellows will be satisfactory if it  does not leak and will give a steady supply of air under sufficient  pressure for the maximum size of flame given by the lamp used. A bellows  with a leaky valve will give a pulsating flame which is very annoying  and makes good work very difficult. When compressed air is available it  can be used, but if possible it should be arranged so that the supply  can be controlled by the foot, as both hands are usually needed to hold  the work. For the same reason the supply of air is usually regulated by  varying the rate of operation of the bellows, rather than by adjusting  the valve of the blast-lamp. On the other hand, it will be found best to  always adjust the flow of the gas by means of the cock on the lamp,  rather than that at the supply pipe. The operator must have complete  control over the flame, and be able to change its size and character at  short notice without giving the work a chance to cool, and often without  ceasing to support it with both hands.    Glass-blowing should be done in a good light, but preferably not in  direct sunlight. The operator should be seated in a chair or on a stool  of such a height that when working he may comfortably rest one or both  elbows on the table. The comfort of the operator has a decided influence  on the character of his work; especially in the case of a beginner, who  often defeats his purpose by assuming uncomfortable and strained  positions. Steadiness and exact control of both hands are essential in  most operations; any uncomfortable or strained position tires the  muscles and weakens the control of the operator over them.    In the arrangement of the exercises here presented, several factors have  been considered. It is important that the first exercises be simple,  although not necessarily the simplest, and they should teach the  fundamental operations which will be used and amplified later. They  should in themselves be things which are of importance and commonly used  in glass-work, and they should be so arranged that the fundamental  points, such as the rotation of glass, the proper temperature, blowing  and shrinking the glass may be learned with a minimum expenditure of  time, glass and gas. It is therefore recommended that the beginner take  them up in the order given, at least as far as No. 7, and that each be  mastered before attempting the next. The beginner should not leave the  first exercise, for example, until he can join together two pieces of  tubing so that they form one piece of substantially uniform inner and  outer diameter, and without thick or thin spots. From two to four  practice periods of two hours each should suffice for this. This chapter  and the following one should also be frequently read over, as many of  the points discussed will not be understood at first and many of the  manipulations described will not be necessary in the simpler exercises.          CHAPTER II    GENERAL OPERATIONS      =Cutting the Glass.=--For this purpose a \"glass-knife\" is preferred to a  file, if the glass is cold: if it is hot a file must always be used, and  its edge slightly moistened to prevent drawing the temper. The  glass-knife is simply a flat piece of hard steel, with the edges ground  sharp on an emery wheel. The bevel of the edge should be from 30 to 60  degrees. An old flat file can easily be ground into a suitable knife.  The glass-knife makes a narrower scratch than the file but appears more  likely to start the minute crack which is to cause the tube to break at  that point, and the break is more likely to give a good square end. The  scratch should be made by passing part of the knife or file once across  the glass, never by \"sawing\" the tool back and forth. This latter  procedure dulls the tool very quickly.    In breaking a piece of glass tubing, many persons forget that it is  necessary to _pull_ the ends apart, as well as to bend the tube very  _slightly_ in such a direction as to open up the minute crack started in  the scratch. Care in breaking the tube is essential, as it is impossible  to do as good work with uneven ends as with square ones.    When tubing of large diameter or thin wall is to be cut, it is often  better not to attempt to break it in the usual way, but to heat a very  small globule of glass (1/16 to 1/8 inch diameter) to red heat, and  touch it to the scratch. This will usually start the crack around the  tube; if it has not proceeded far enough, or has not gone in the  desired direction, it may be led along with a hot point of glass. This  is put a little beyond the end of the crack, and as the latter grows out  toward it, moved along the path where the crack is desired. This point  of glass is also very useful in breaking off very short ends of tubes,  where there is not room to get a firm enough hold and sufficient  leverage to break the tube in the ordinary way, and for breaking tubes  attached to large or heavy objects, which would be likely to make  trouble if treated in the ordinary way.    Another way of cutting large tubing, especially if it has rather thick  walls, is to make a scratch in the usual way, and then turn on the  smallest and sharpest possible flame of the blast lamp. The tube is next  taken in both hands and held horizontally above the flame so that the  scratch is exactly over it. The tubing is now rotated rapidly about its  axis, and lowered so that the flame is just tangent to its lower side.  After about ten seconds of heating, it is removed from the flame and the  hot portion quickly breathed upon, when it will generally crack apart  very nicely. Care must be taken to hold the tube at right angles to the  flame during the heating, and to rotate it so that only a narrow strip  of the circumference is heated, and the scratch should be in the center  of this heated strip. By this means tubing as large as two inches in  diameter is readily broken.    Griffin's glass cutter, which contains a hardened steel wheel, like that  on any ordinary window-glass cutter, and a device by which this can be  made to make a true cut clear around the tube, is a very handy article,  especially for large tubing, and may be obtained from any dealers in  chemical apparatus.    =Bending Glass.=--Inasmuch as this is one of the commonest operations in  the laboratory, it is assumed that the reader knows how to perform it.  However, it should be noted that in order to obtain the best results a  broad (fish-tail burner) flame should generally be used, and the tube  rotated on its axis during the heating, and allowed to bend mostly by  its own weight. If large tubing is to be bent, one end must be stoppered  and great care used. Whenever the tube shows signs of collapsing or  becoming deformed, it must be gently blown out into shape, heating the  desired spot locally if necessary. A blast-lamp is likely to be more  useful here than the fish-tail burner.    =Drawing Out a Tube.=--Most students learn this the first day of their  laboratory work in chemistry, but few take pains to do it well. The tube  should be heated in the flame of a Bunsen burner, or blast lamp  (preferably the latter) until it is very soft. During this time it must  be continuously rotated about its axis, and so held that the edges of  the heated zone are sharply defined; _i.e._, it should not be allowed to  move back and forth along its own axis. When so hot that it cannot  longer be held in shape, the tube is removed from the flame, and the  ends slowly and regularly drawn apart, _continuing the rotation of the  tube about its axis_. By regulating the rate of drawing and the length  of tube heated, the desired length and diameter of capillary may be  obtained. The tube should always be rotated and kept in a straight line  until the glass has set, so that the capillary may have the same axis as  the main tube. This capillary or \"tail\" is often a very necessary handle  in glass-blowing, and if it is not straight and true, will continually  make trouble.    In drawing out very large tubing, say from one to two inches in  diameter, it is often necessary to draw the tube _in the flame_,  proceeding very slowly and at a lower temperature than would be used  with small tubing. This is partly on account of the difficulty of  heating large tubing uniformly to a high temperature, and partly in  order to prevent making the conical"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/3008"],[0,"The Jargon File, Version 4.2.2, 20 Aug 2000 (#2)"],[1,"flavor, and one of this document's major intended audiences     -- fledgling hackers already partway inside the culture -- will     benefit from them.       A selection of longer items of hacker folklore and humor is included     in [29]Appendix A. The `outside' reader's attention is particularly     directed to the Portrait of J. Random Hacker in [30]Appendix B.     Appendix C, the [31]Bibliography, lists some non-technical works which     have either influenced or described the hacker culture.       Because hackerdom is an intentional culture (one each individual must     choose by action to join), one should not be surprised that the line     between description and influence can become more than a little     blurred. Earlier versions of the Jargon File have played a central     role in spreading hacker language and the culture that goes with it to     successively larger populations, and we hope and expect that this one     will do likewise.       _________________________________________________________________       Node:A Few Terms, Next:[32]Revision History,     Previous:[33]Introduction, Up:[34]Top    Of Slang, Jargon, and Techspeak       Linguists usually refer to informal language as `slang' and reserve     the term `jargon' for the technical vocabularies of various     occupations. However, the ancestor of this collection was called the     `Jargon File', and hacker slang is traditionally `the jargon'. When     talking about the jargon there is therefore no convenient way to     distinguish it from what a linguist would call hackers' jargon -- the     formal vocabulary they learn from textbooks, technical papers, and     manuals.       To make a confused situation worse, the line between hacker slang and     the vocabulary of technical programming and computer science is fuzzy,     and shifts over time. Further, this vocabulary is shared with a wider     technical culture of programmers, many of whom are not hackers and do     not speak or recognize hackish slang.       Accordingly, this lexicon will try to be as precise as the facts of     usage permit about the distinctions among three categories:       * `slang': informal language from mainstream English or         non-technical subcultures (bikers, rock fans, surfers, etc).       * `jargon': without qualifier, denotes informal `slangy' language         peculiar to or predominantly found among hackers -- the subject of         this lexicon.       * `techspeak': the formal technical vocabulary of programming,         computer science, electronics, and other fields connected to         hacking.       This terminology will be consistently used throughout the remainder of     this lexicon.       The jargon/techspeak distinction is the delicate one. A lot of     techspeak originated as jargon, and there is a steady continuing     uptake of jargon into techspeak. On the other hand, a lot of jargon     arises from overgeneralization of techspeak terms (there is more about     this in the [35]Jargon Construction section below).       In general, we have considered techspeak any term that communicates     primarily by a denotation well established in textbooks, technical     dictionaries, or standards documents.       A few obviously techspeak terms (names of operating systems,     languages, or documents) are listed when they are tied to hacker     folklore that isn't covered in formal sources, or sometimes to convey     critical historical background necessary to understand other entries     to which they are cross-referenced. Some other techspeak senses of     jargon words are listed in order to make the jargon senses clear;     where the text does not specify that a straight technical sense is     under discussion, these are marked with `[techspeak]' as an etymology.     Some entries have a primary sense marked this way, with subsequent     jargon meanings explained in terms of it.       We have also tried to indicate (where known) the apparent origins of     terms. The results are probably the least reliable information in the     lexicon, for several reasons. For one thing, it is well known that     many hackish usages have been independently reinvented multiple times,     even among the more obscure and intricate neologisms. It often seems     that the generative processes underlying hackish jargon formation have     an internal logic so powerful as to create substantial parallelism     across separate cultures and even in different languages! For another,     the networks tend to propagate innovations so quickly that `first use'     is often impossible to pin down. And, finally, compendia like this one     alter what they observe by implicitly stamping cultural approval on     terms and widening their use.       Despite these problems, the organized collection of jargon-related     oral history for the new compilations has enabled us to put to rest     quite a number of folk etymologies, place credit where credit is due,     and illuminate the early history of many important hackerisms such as     [36]kluge, [37]cruft, and [38]foo. We believe specialist     lexicographers will find many of the historical notes more than     casually instructive.       _________________________________________________________________       Node:Revision History, Next:[39]Jargon Construction, Previous:[40]A     Few Terms, Up:[41]Top    Revision History       The original Jargon File was a collection of hacker jargon from     technical cultures including the MIT AI Lab, the Stanford AI lab     (SAIL), and others of the old ARPANET AI/LISP/PDP-10 communities     including Bolt, Beranek and Newman (BBN), Carnegie-Mellon University     (CMU), and Worcester Polytechnic Institute (WPI).       The Jargon File (hereafter referred to as `jargon-1' or `the File')     was begun by Raphael Finkel at Stanford in 1975. From this time until     the plug was finally pulled on the SAIL computer in 1991, the File was     named AIWORD.RF[UP,DOC] there. Some terms in it date back considerably     earlier ([42]frob and some senses of [43]moby, for instance, go back     to the Tech Model Railroad Club at MIT and are believed to date at     least back to the early 1960s). The revisions of jargon-1 were all     unnumbered and may be collectively considered `Version 1'.       In 1976, Mark Crispin, having seen an announcement about the File on     the SAIL computer, [44]FTPed a copy of the File to MIT. He noticed     that it was hardly restricted to `AI words' and so stored the file on     his directory as AI:MRC;SAIL JARGON.       The file was quickly renamed JARGON > (the `>' caused versioning under     ITS) as a flurry of enhancements were made by Mark Crispin and Guy L.     Steele Jr. Unfortunately, amidst all this activity, nobody thought of     correcting the term `jargon' to `slang' until the compendium had     already become widely known as the Jargon File.       Raphael Finkel dropped out of active participation shortly thereafter     and Don Woods became the SAIL contact for the File (which was     subsequently kept in duplicate at SAIL and MIT, with periodic     resynchronizations).       The File expanded by fits and starts until about 1983; Richard     Stallman was prominent among the contributors, adding many MIT and     ITS-related coinages.       In Spring 1981, a hacker named Charles Spurgeon got a large chunk of     the File published in Stewart Brand's \"CoEvolution Quarterly\" (issue     29, pages 26-35) with illustrations by Phil Wadler and Guy Steele     (including a couple of the Crunchly cartoons). This appears to have     been the File's first paper publication.       A late version of jargon-1, expanded with commentary for the mass     market, was edited by Guy Steele into a book published in 1983 as \"The     Hacker's Dictionary\" (Harper & Row CN 1082, ISBN 0-06-091082-8). The     other jargon-1 editors (Raphael Finkel, Don Woods, and Mark Crispin)     contributed to this revision, as did Richard M. Stallman and Geoff     Goodfellow. This book (now out of print) is hereafter referred to as     `Steele-1983' and those six as the Steele-1983 coauthors.       Shortly after the publication of Steele-1983, the File effectively     stopped growing and changing. Originally, this was due to a desire to     freeze the file temporarily to facilitate the production of     Steele-1983, but external conditions caused the `temporary' freeze to     become permanent.       The AI Lab culture had been hit hard in the late 1970s by funding cuts     and the resulting administrative decision to use vendor-supported     hardware and software instead of homebrew whenever possible. At MIT,     most AI work had turned to dedicated LISP Machines. At the same time,     the commercialization of AI technology lured some of the AI Lab's best     and brightest away to startups along the Route 128 strip in     Massachusetts and out West in Silicon Valley. The startups built LISP     machines for MIT; the central MIT-AI computer became a [45]TWENEX     system rather than a host for the AI hackers' beloved [46]ITS.       The Stanford AI Lab had effectively ceased to exist by 1980, although     the SAIL computer continued as a Computer Science Department resource     until 1991. Stanford became a major [47]TWENEX site, at one point     operating more than a dozen TOPS-20 systems; but by the mid-1980s most     of the interesting software work was being done on the emerging BSD     Unix standard.       In April 1983, the PDP-10-centered cultures that had nourished the     File were dealt a death-blow by the cancellation of the Jupiter     project at Digital Equipment Corporation. The File's compilers,     already dispersed, moved on to other things. Steele-1983 was partly a     monument to what its authors thought was a dying tradition; no one     involved realized at the time just how wide its influence was to be.       By the mid-1980s the File's content was dated, but the legend that had  "]]]
