Alas, he does not know our jungle and its perils.\" Those  who spoke a little English would make some expression of sympathy.    Maybe the crew was a little suspicious, maybe they thought there was  something fishy about the thing, and then they thought of the unhappy  results of what was commonly referred to as an \"interplanetary  incident.\" Ever since the people of the second planet of Alpha Centauri,  in the early days of extraterrestrial exploration, had massacred an  entire expedition because the captain had mortally insulted a tribal  leader by refusing a sacred fruit, such incidents had been avoided at  all costs.    And so, they dared not offend the Arrillians by questioning the veracity  of their statements. And the jungle was deadly, so they looked a little  longer, and asked a few more questions. After a little while, the  scientists had completed their work and were anxious to get home, and  so, the ship blasted off, without him.    All this had passed kaleidoscopically in Tyndall's mind as he lay on the  couch in his luxurious prison, too numb to weep or even curse. His  reverie was broken by the clicking of the lock and he raised up to see  the door opening. An Arrillian servant stood there, his silver hair done  up in the complicated style which denoted male house servants. He was  unarmed. The houseman smiled, roared in imitation of a rocket, made a  swooping gesture with one hand to indicate the departing ship, then  pointed at Tyndall and at the open door. The servant bowed and departed,  leaving the door slightly ajar. Now that the ship was gone, he was free  to leave his room.    Tyndall stepped cautiously out of the room and found himself in a long  hall, with many doors opening from it on either side, much like a hotel  corridor. One end of the hall seemed to open out onto a garden and he  started in that direction.    The doorway opened out into a patio which overlooked a vast and  perfectly tended garden. The verdant perfection of the scene was marred  only by one of the Bugs, sunning itself and gnawing on the stem of a  flower. Tyndall was impressed again with the repulsive ugliness of the  thing. This one was the size of a small adult human, and even vaguely  human in outline, although the brownish armored body was still more  suggestive of a big bug than anything else known to him. There were even  rudimentary wings furled close to the curving back, and the underside  was a dirty, striped gray. Tyndall shuddered, wondering why the  Arrillians, who so loved to surround themselves with beauty, should  choose so horrendous a creature as the object of their worship, or  protection.    He heard running footsteps behind him, and turned to see the Arrillian  houseman, breathless, with an expression of greatest concern on his  face. The servant bowed respectfully before Tyndall, then gestured at  the garden, shook his head vigorously from side to side and tugged at  the Earthman's sleeve.    \"Forbidden territory, eh? Okay, old fellow, what now?\"    The servant motioned for Tyndall to follow him, and ushered him down the  hall from whence he had just come, and into another of the rooms opening  off from it. The very old man reclining upon the low, Roman-like couch,  Tyndall recognized at once as his host, the Rhal of Arrill.    The Rhal touched the fingertips of both hands to his forehead in the  Arrillian gesture of greeting, and Tyndall did the same. He noticed  several male Arrillians standing near the back of the room, although the  servant had bowed and retired.    \"Well, Tyn-Dall, how do you enjoy the hospitality of Ahhreel?\" He, of  course, gave the native pronunciation to the name which was almost  Teutonic in sound and unpronounceable for Tyndall because of the sound  given to the double aspirate, for which he knew no equivalent.    \"Your English, Dheb Rhal, has improved greatly since our last meeting,\"  commented Tyndall guardedly, using the Arrillian prefix of extreme  respect.    The old man smiled. \"Your friends were kind enough to lend me books and  also the little grooved disks that make voice.\" He gestured toward an  old-fashioned wind-up type phonograph which Tyndall recognized at once  as being standard aboard interstellar vessels, and for just such a  purpose. The Rhal continued, \"For teaching English very fine. How are  you enjoying our hospitality, I ask again?\"    Tyndall was stuck on Arrill and he knew it. There was no need to cook  his own goose by being deliberately offensive. \"I appreciate the  hospitality of Arrill, I express my thanks for the consideration of my  hosts but--if I may ask a question?\"    \"Yes?\"    \"What, in the wisdom of the Dheb Rhal, is the reason for  my--er--detainment?\"    \"To answer that, Tyn-Dall, I must tell you something of the past of  Ahhreel, and of her destiny.\" At these words, the other Arrillians in  the room drew closer, and the Rhal motioned them to a couch at his feet  and nodded toward Tyndall, requesting that he join them. Tyndall noticed  that the others were gazing up into the old man's face with an  expression of raptness, even of reverence. He knew that the Rhal did not  possess an especially exalted position politically, even though he was  head of the city. He guessed therefore that the Rhal must be the  religious ruler of Arrill as well.    The Rhal began, intoning the words as though he were reciting a ritual,  \"There was a time, many thousands of Khreelas ago, when the kingdom of  Ahhreel was not one small city, as you see it now, but a mighty empire,  girdling the world in her vastness. But the people of Ahhreel had become  evil in their ways, and her cities were black with sin. It was then that  Xheev himself left his kingdom in paradise and appeared to the people of  Ahhreel, and he told them that he was displeased, and that bad times  would fall upon Ahhreel, and that her people would dwindle in number,  and became exceedingly few, and the jungle would reclaim her emptied  cities. One city, and only one, would survive and prosper, and the  people of that city would be given the chance to redeem Ahhreel, and  remove the heavy hand of Xheev's terrible punishment.    \"All this came to pass, and in the dark Khreelas that followed, all of  Ahhreel vanished except this city. Now, for many, many thousands of  Khreelas, the people of this city have striven to redeem Ahhreel by  obeying the sacred laws of Xheev.    \"Xheev had promised that when the punishment was ended, he would send a  sign, and his sign would be that a great silver shell should fall from  the heavens, and within would be Xheev's own emissary, who must wed the  ranking priestess of Xheev, establishing again the rapport between the  kingdom of paradise and the world of Ahhreel.\"    When the Rhal had finished, the other Arrillians in the room fastened  the same look of reverence upon Tyndall which they had formerly reserved  for the Rhal.    Tyndall chose his words carefully. \"But there were many aboard my  vessel. Why did you, Dheb Rhal, select me as the emissary of Xheev?\"    \"Xheev selected you, I recognized you, as of all your companions, you  and you alone have the sun-colored hair, which is the sacred color of  Xheev.\"    Tyndall was able to question the Rhal almost coolly, the trap was  already sprung, the ship was gone. Now, he only wanted to know the how,  and the why. An accident of pigmentation, only that had brought him to  this. Sun-colored hair!    \"But, Dheb Rhal, did my friends and I not often tell you of ourselves,  of the place from which we came? A world, a world like your own?\"    The old man smiled. \"Do not think me naive, Tyn-Dall. I am quite aware  that you are but a man, a man from another world, although quite an  incredible world it must be. I know also that you were, until this hour,  unaware of your destiny. I knew that when my priest reported that you  ignored the Ritual Of The Time, until literally forced to obey. That is  why we had to use ... devious means to make certain that your companions  would not prevent the fulfillment of the prophesy. Now, of course, you  understand.    \"I do not think the priestess Lhyreesa will make you unhappy, Tyn-Dall.\"           *       *       *       *       *    This was not Earth and these people were not Earthmen. The thought now  did not bring the bitter pain it had at first, right after the ship  left. Earth already was becoming hazy in Tyndall's mind, a lovely globe  of green somewhere ... somewhere far, and home once, a long time ago.    No, the Arrillians were not Earthmen, but they were human, and an  attractive, gracious race. Life would not be bad, among the Arrillians,  especially as the espoused of the ranking priestess of Arrill. Tyndall  fingered the rich material of his Arrillian robe; he thought of the  food, the wine, the servants. No, he decided, not bad at all. One  thing, though--this priestess Lhyreesa ...    \"I have, then, but one request to make, Dheb Rhal, I would like to see  the priestess Lhyreesa.\"    The old man almost chuckled, \"That is understandable, Tyn-Dall, but it  is not yet The Time.\"    Tyndall, reveling in the strength of his position, grew bolder. \"I would  like very much, Dheb Rhal, to see her now.\"    The Rhal's face darkened. \"Very well, Tyn-Dall, but I warn you, do not  enter the Grove. There is death there, death that even I am powerless to  prevent. The Guardians will not harm her, but any stranger ... will not  live many minutes in the Grove.\"    \"I will not enter, Dheb Rhal.\"    \"Tyn-Dall, The Time is very soon, possibly this very hour. Will you not  wait?\"    \"I prefer not to wait, Dheb Rhal.\"    The Rhal gestured to a young Arrillian. \"Bheel, show Tyn-Dall to the  Grove of the priestess Lhyreesa.\"    The younger man protested, \"But, Dheb Rhal, so near The Time, what  if ...\"    \"Do as I command,\" snapped the Rhal.    Bheel turned silently, motioning for Tyndall to follow.

Rank Order pages are generally given in descending order -  highest to lowest - such as Population and Area. The two exceptions are  Unemployment Rate and Inflation Rate, which are in ascending - lowest  to highest - order. Rank Order pages are available for the following 55  fields in six of the nine Factbook categories.      Geography    Area - total      People    Population  Population growth rate  Birth rate  Death rate  Infant mortality rate  Life expectancy at birth - total  Total fertility rate  HIV/AIDS - adult prevalence rate  HIV/AIDS - people living with HIV/AIDS  HIV/AIDS - deaths      Economy    GDP (purchasing power parity)  GDP - real growth rate  GDP - per capita  Labor force  Unemployment rate  Inflation rate (consumer prices)  Central bank discount rate  Commercial bank prime lending rate  Stock of money  Stock of quasi money  Stock of domestic credit  Investment (gross fixed)  Public debt  Industrial production growth rate  Electricity - production  Electricity - consumption  Oil - production  Oil - consumption  Oil - exports  Oil - imports  Oil - proved reserves  Natural Gas - production  Natural Gas - consumption  Natural Gas - exports  Natural Gas - imports  Natural Gas - proved reserves  Current account balance  Exports  Imports  Reserves of foreign exchange and gold  Debt - external  Stock of direct foreign investment - at home  Stock of direct foreign investment - abroad  Market value of publicly traded shares      Communications    Telephones - main lines in use  Telephones - mobile cellular  Internet hosts  Internet users      Transportation    Airports  Railways - total  Roadways - total  Waterways  Merchant marine - total      Military    Military expenditures - percent of GDP        Factbook fields with Rank Order pages are easily identified with a  small bar chart icon to the right of the data field title.    Not all Rank Order pages include the same number of entries because  information for a particular field is not available for all countries.  In addition, not all data fields are suitable for displaying as Rank  Order pages, such as those containing textual information. Textual  information is more readily viewed by clicking on the Field Listing  icon  next to the Data field title. The other icon next to the data  field title provides the definition of the field.    All of the 'Rank Order' pages can be downloaded as tab-delimited data  files and can be opened in other applications such as spreadsheets and  databases. To save a Rank Order page in a spreadsheet, first click on  the 'Download Datafile' choice above the Rank Order page you selected;  then, at the top of your browser window, click on 'File' and 'Save As'.  After saving the file, open the spreadsheet, find the saved file, and  'Open' it.    Additional Rank Order pages being considered for future updates of the  Factbook Web site include:      Median age    Literacy    Population below the poverty line      This page was last updated on 20 November, 2008        =====================================================================          Appendixes      Appendix A - Abbreviations    Appendix B - International Organizations and Groups    Appendix C - Selected International Environmental Agreements    Appendix D - Cross-Reference list of Country Data Codes    Appendix E - Cross-Reference List of Hydrographic Data Codes    Appendix F - Cross-Reference List of Geographic Names    Appendix G - Weights and Measures      ======================================================================        Notes and Definitions      In addition to the regular information updates, The World Factbook 2008  features several new additions. In the Geography category, two new  fields focus on the increasingly vital resource of water: \"Total  renewable water resources\" and \"Freshwater withdrawal.\"    In the Economy category, the Factbook has added three fields: \"Stock of  direct foreign investment - at home\", \"Stock of direct foreign  investment - abroad\", and \"Market value of publicly traded shares.\"  Additionally, the data for GDP at purchasing power parity (PPP) has  been rebased using new PPP conversion rates, benchmarked to the year  2005, which were released on 17 December 2007 by the International  Comparison Program (ICP). The 2005 PPP data replace previous estimates,  many from studies dating to 1993 or earlier. The preliminary ICP report  provides estimates of internationally comparable price levels and the  relative purchasing power of currencies for 146 countries. The 2005  benchmark revises downward the size of the world economy in PPP terms  from the previous estimates, and changes the relative sizes of many of  the world's economies.    Concise descriptions of the major religions mentioned in the Factbook  have been added to the Notes and Definitions. France 's redesignation  of some of its overseas possessions caused the five former Indian Ocean  island possessions making up Iles Eparses to be incorporated into the  French Southern and Antarctic Lands, while two new Caribbean entities,  St. Barthelemy and St. Martin, were created.    Revision of some individual country maps, first introduced in the 2001  edition, is continued in this edition. The revised maps include  elevation extremes and a partial geographic grid. Several regional maps  have also been updated to reflect boundary changes and place name  spelling changes.    Abbreviations:  This information is included in Appendix A:  Abbreviations, which includes all abbreviations and acronyms used in  the Factbook, with their expansions.    Acronyms:  An acronym is an abbreviation coined from the initial letter  of each successive word in a term or phrase. In general, an acronym  made up solely from the first letter of the major words in the expanded  form is rendered in all capital letters (NATO from North Atlantic  Treaty Organization; an exception would be ASEAN for Association of  Southeast Asian Nations). In general, an acronym made up of more than  the first letter of the major words in the expanded form is rendered  with only an initial capital letter (Comsat from Communications  Satellite Corporation; an exception would be NAM from Nonaligned  Movement). Hybrid forms are sometimes used to distinguish between  initially identical terms (ICC for International Chamber of Commerce  and ICCt for International Criminal Court).    Administrative divisions:  This entry generally gives the numbers,  designatory terms, and first-order administrative divisions as approved  by the US Board on Geographic Names (BGN). Changes that have been  reported but not yet acted on by the BGN are noted.    Age structure:  This entry provides the distribution of the population  according to age. Information is included by sex and age group (0-14  years, 15-64 years, 65 years and over). The age structure of a  population affects a nation's key socioeconomic issues. Countries with  young populations (high percentage under age 15) need to invest more in  schools, while countries with older populations (high percentage ages  65 and over) need to invest more in the health sector. The age  structure can also be used to help predict potential political issues.  For example, the rapid growth of a young adult population unable to  find employment can lead to unrest.
