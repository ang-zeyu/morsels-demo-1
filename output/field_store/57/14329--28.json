Those mummies filled with bitumen, have black  skins, hard and shining as if varnished, but with the features  perfect, having been prepared with great care, and even after ages  have elapsed, are but little susceptible to exposure.    Of the mummies of the second class (also filled with resins and  asphaltum), we must assume that their skins and flesh have been  subjected to sodaic or saline products; for Boitard, in a work  published at Paris in 1825, says that an injection is made with oil of  cedar and common salt, also, that they wash the corpse with nitre and  leave it to steep for seventy days, at the end of which time they  remove the intestines, which the injection has corroded, and replace  their loss by filling the cavity of the abdomen with nitre. This is  also borne out by Wilkinson, who says:    \"On exposure to air they (the mummies) become covered with  efflorescence of sulphate of soda, and also readily absorb moisture  from the atmosphere.\"    It appears, also, that after the period of preparation (thirty, forty,  or seventy days, as fixed by various authors), the corpse was  relieved, in the first-class ones, of all the old saline, nitrous, or  resinous products, and re-filled with costly resins, aromatic spices,  and bitumen; which, says Monsieur Rouyer:    \"Having styptic, absorbent, and balsamic qualities, would produce a  kind of tanning operation on the body, which would also, no doubt, be  heightened by the washing with palm wine.\"    He here broaches the ingenious and highly probable theory, that the  corpse, during its mummification, was placed in stoves of a certain  temperature, where the heat gradually and closely united the various  preservative agents before mentioned. They were then swathed in linen  bandages of great length, and enclosed in beautifully painted and  gilded cartonages; the faces were heavily gilded and the eyes imitated  in enamel; they were then inclosed in three or four cases, also richly  gilded and painted, and finally \"mounted\" in a sarcophagus.    Common people appear in some cases to have been merely salted and  plunged in liquid pitch, others were simply salted and dried. Mummies  prepared by these methods freely attract moisture--are ill preserved,  and, therefore, as a matter of course, fall to pieces easily on  contact with external air.    In summing up the process of embalming, as described by the authors  just quoted, we find a few problems of more or less difficulty, and  which none of them appear inclined to solve; and I do not wonder at  this, as the attempt, in my own case, in one or two instances, has  involved days of study and references to dozens of medical and other  works with but a meagre result. However, to take them seriatim, we can  assume, I think, with some show of evidence, that the Ethiopian stone,  mentioned as being used to make the first incision in the corpse,  might have been a piece of obsidian or basalt, but most probably was  merely an ordinary sharp flint of a dark colour.    The first chemical used in embalming is the hardest nut of all to  crack, and on which I have most exercised my intellectual teeth--and  that is natron. Now, what is natron? [Footnote: Natrium is the old  Latin term for the metal or base we now call sodium. The old names for  some of its salts were: Natron Carbonicum--or Bicarbonate of Soda;  Natron Vitriolatum--or Sulphate of Soda; discovered or re-discovered  about 1670. Nitrum =Carbonate of soda.] Ordinary dictionaries and  authors tell us, as a matter of course--carbonate of soda. In support  of this theory M. Rouyer writes:    \"The natron would be used just as it was got from many of the lakes of  Egypt, where it is found abundantly in the form of carbonate of soda.\"    Pereira, in \"Materia Medica,\" though intimating that natron is not to  be confounded with nitre, says, in speaking of carbonate of soda:    \"This salt was probably known to the ancients under the term of  Nitron.\"    Now, as Nitron is more likely, from its etymology, to be translated  \"nitre,\" we are landed into another difficulty, if by nitre we mean  saltpetre, for that will, as we all know, preserve animal tissue for a  certain time; however, I do not think we can translate natron as being  nitre (saltpetre), for in former days many salts were included under  the general term nitre; for instance, our common soda and potash, the  chemical composition of which was unknown until Davy, in 1807,  extracted the metals sodium and potassium from those salts. Boitard  expressly states:    \"Il parait que ce natrum etait un alkali fixe, et pas du tout du nitre  comme quelques auteurs l'ont pense; ce qui semblerait appuyer cette  opinion, c'est que lea femmes egyptiennes se servaient de natrum pour  faire leur lessive, comme on as sert aujourd'hui de la soude.\"    In Peru the soil may be said to be impregnated with nitre, but that is  nitrate of soda, and not really saltpetre (nitrate of potassium), as  many people imagine who hear it called simply nitre.    Mr. Thos. W. Baker, who has most obligingly unearthed several old  works for me, says:    \"Now I think of it, natron is perfectly familiar to me as apparently a  mixture of broken soda crystals and a brown earth which is sold in the  bazaars of India, under the name of 'sootjee moogee,' for domestic  purposes; and I know, from experience, that unless it is washed off  paint work directly it is passed over it with a cloth all the paint  comes off bare, sometimes to the wood.\"    Again, he says:    \"In Bayley's Dictionary, circa 1730, I find the following: 'Natron;  or, a Natron, from Gr. Natron (?), a kind of black greyish salt, taken  out of a lake of stagnant water in the territory of Terrana, in  Egypt.\"    Also see \"Penny Cyclopaedia,\" vol. xvi, p. 105, \"Natron, native  sesquicarbonate of soda (see 'Sodium'):\"    \"The Natron Lakes, which are six in number, are situated in a valley  bordering upon Lower Egypt, and are remarkable for the great quantity  of salt which they produce. The crystallisations are both of muriate  of soda (or common salt) and of carbonate of soda. ... The 'Natron' is  collected once a year, and is used both in Egypt and Syria, as also in  Europe, for manufacturing glass and soap, and for bleaching linen.\"    Turning to \"Sodium\" for the sesquicarbonate, which is found native in  Hungary, and also near Fezzan, in Africa:    'By the natives it is called \"Trona.\" It is found in hard striated  crystalline masses, and is not altered by exposure to the air, but is  readily soluble in water. This salt appears to be formed when a  solution of the carbonate of soda is heated with carbonate of ammonia,  and probably also when a solution of the bicarbonate is heated. Its  taste is less alkaline than that of the carbonate, into which it is  converted when strongly heated by losing one-third of its carbonic  acid.'    That it was one of the products of soda cannot reasonably be doubted.  Biborate of soda (with which I have been experimenting lately) has  certainly wonderfully preservative powers, especially in conjunction  with common salt, or saltpetre; but then it has not the caustic  properties of natron. May not natron have been a fixed alkali, or has  the native carbonate of soda more caustic and antiseptic properties  than the usual carbonate of soda of commerce, which plainly cannot be  intended?    We have here a most interesting subject to solve as to the component  parts of the ancient natron; my suspicion is that natron, as used by  the Egyptians, was a mixture of biborate of soda, caustic soda, and  muriate of soda. [Footnote: The following report appeared in the  California Alta, 24th June. 1874:    \"AN INTERESTING DISCOVERY.--Several weeks ago we mentioned the  departure of Mr. Arthur Robottom, Birmingham, England, on a search for  borax in the southern part of California. He has now returned,  bringing news of an interesting and valuable discovery. Beyond the  Sierra Nevada, in the Enclosed Basin of North America, about 140 miles  in a north-eastward direction from Bakersfield, there is the bed of a  dry lake filled over an area of fifteen miles long by six wide with  saline crystals to a depth of about six or eight feet. The appearance  of the surrounding country clearly indicates that water once stood  sixty feet deep here over a large area, the ancient beach being  distinctly traceable. The most remarkable fact about this-saline  deposit is that in its middle there is a tract, five miles long and  two wide, of common salt, while on the outside there is a deposit of  borate of soda, three feet thick, and under this a lower stratum  composed of sulphate of soda and tincal mixed together, from one to  three feet thick. These minerals are all in crystals, the sulphate of  soda and tincal forming a solid mass, almost like stone in its  hardness. The borate of soda is of a dirty hue, but the salt, which  lies above the level of the entire deposit, in some places to a depth  of seven feet, is white as snow. The report of natural deposits thus  situated will appear very improbable to scientific men, for there is  nothing to account for the separation of the salt from the borates, or  for the accumulation of salt above the level of other crystalline  deposits. We have Mr. Robottom for authority, and the country is open  for those who wish to examine for themselves. The place can easily be  found. It is known as the Borax Fields in the Slate Range, and will be  examined carefully by many competent men, since the tincal--a crude  borate of soda--is a valuable mineral, and can be separated, at little  expense, from the sulphate of soda.\"]    The next chemical agent we have to notice (which should, however, have  appeared prior to natron), is palm wine, used in the first process of  cleansing the intestines; this would doubtless act as an astringent,  and would, of course, tend to coagulate the liquid albumen contained  in the "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/26030"],[0,"The Automobilist Abroad (#2)"],[1," most absurd inquiries as to what said car  will or will not do.    [Illustration: Types of Cars]    Since the pleasures of motoring have found their champions in  Kipling, Maeterlinck, and the late W. E. Henley, the delectable  amusement has, besides entering the daily life of most of us,  generously permeated literature--real literature as distinct from  recent popular fiction; \"The Lighting Conductor\" and \"The Princess  Passes,\" by Mrs. Williamson, and more lately, \"The Motor Pirate,\" by  Mr. Paternoster. \"A Motor Car Divorce\" is the suggestive title of  another work,--presumably fiction,--and one knows not where it may  end, since \"The Happy Motorist,\" a series of essays, is already  announced.    A Drury Lane melodrama of a season or two ago gave us a \"_thrillin'  hair-bre'dth 'scape_,\" wherein an automobile plunged precipitately--  with an all too-true realism, the first night--down a lath and canvas  ravine, finally saving the heroine from the double-dyed villain who  followed so closely in her wake.    The last entry into other spheres was during the autumn just past,  when Paris's luxurious opera-house was given over to the fantastic  revels of the ballet in an attempt to typify the _apotheosis of the  automobile_. This was rather a rash venture in prognostication, for  it may be easy enough to \"apotheosize\" the horse, but to what idyllic  heights the automobile is destined to ultimately reach no one really  knows.    The average scoffer at things automobilistic is not very sincerely a  scoffer at heart. It is mostly a case of \"sour grapes,\" and he only  waits the propitious combination of circumstances which shall permit  him to become a possessor of a motor-car himself. This is not a very  difficult procedure. It simply means that he must give up some other  fad or fancy and take up with this last, which, be it here  reiterated, is no _fad_.    The great point in favour of the automobile is its sociability. Once  one was content to potter about with a solitary companion in a buggy,  with a comfortable old horse who knew his route well by reason of  many journeys. To-day the automobile has driven thoughts of solitude  to the winds. Two in the tonneau, and another on the seat beside you  in front--a well-assorted couple of couples--and one may make the  most ideal trips imaginable.    Every one looks straight ahead, there is no uncomfortable twisting  and turning as there is on a boat or a railway train, and each can  talk to the others, or all can talk at once, which is more often the  case. It is most enjoyable, plenty to see, exhilarating motion, jolly  company, absolute independence, and a wide radius of action. What  mode of travel can combine all these joys unless it be ballooning--of  which the writer confesses he knows nothing?    On the road one must ever have a regard for what may happen, and  roadside repairs, however necessary, are seldom more than makeshifts  which enable one to arrive at his destination.    If you break the bolt which fastens your cardan-shaft or a link of  your side-chains, you and your friends will have a chance to harden  your muscles a bit pushing the machine to the next village, unless  you choose to wait, on perhaps a lonely road, for a passing cart  whose driver willing, for a price, to detach his tired horse to haul  your dead weight of a ton and a half over a few miles of hill and  dale. This is readily enough accomplished in France, where the  peasant looks upon the procedure as a sort of allied industry to  farming, but in parts of England, in Holland, and frequently in  Italy, where the little mountain donkey is the chief means of  transportation, it is more difficult.    The question of road speed proves nothing with regard to the worth of  an individual automobile, except that the times do move, and we are  learning daily more and more of the facility of getting about with a  motor-car. A locomotive, or a marine engine, moves regularly without  a stop for far greater periods of time than does an automobile, but  each and every time they finish a run they receive such an  overhauling as seldom comes to an automobile.    In England the automobilist has had to suffer a great deal at the  hands of ignorant and intolerant road builders and guardians. Police  traps, on straight level stretches miles from any collection of  dwellings, will not keep down speed so long as dangerous cobblestoned  alleys, winding through suburban London towns, have no guardian to  regulate the traffic or give the stranger a hint that he had best go  slowly.    The milk and butchers' carts go on with their deadly work, but the  police in England are too busy worrying the motorist to pay any  attention.    Some county boroughs have applied a ten-mile speed limit, even though  the great bulk of their area is open country; but twenty miles an  hour for an automobile is far safer for the public than is most other  traffic, regardless of the rate at which it moves.    [Illustration: \"Speed\" painting, Louis de Schryver]    Speed, so far as the bystander is concerned, is a very difficult  thing to judge, and the automobilist seldom, if ever, gets fair  treatment if he meets with the slightest accident.    Most people judge the speed of an automobile by the noise that it  makes. This, up to within a few years, put most automobiles going at  a slow speed at a great disadvantage, for the slower they went the  noisier they were; but matters of design and control have changed  this somewhat, and the public now protests because \"a great  death-dealing monster crept up silently behind--coming at a terrific  rate.\" You cannot please every one, and you cannot educate a  non-participating public all at once.    As for speed on the road, it is a variable thing, and a thing  difficult to estimate correctly. Electric cars run at a speed of from  ten to twenty-two miles an hour in England, even in the towns, and no  one says them nay. Hansoms, on the Thames Embankment in London, do  their regular fifteen miles an hour, but automobiles are still held  down to ten.    The official timekeeper of the Automobile Club of Great Britain and  Ireland took the following times (in 1905) in Piccadilly, one of the  busiest, if not the most congested thoroughfare in London.

The road obstructions, slow-going traffic which will not get out of  one's way, carts left unattended and the like, make most of the real  and fancied dangers which are laid to the door of the very mobile  motor-car.    [Illustration: London and Paris traffic]    In Holland and Belgium dogs seem to be the chief road obstructions,  or at least dangers, not always willingly perhaps, but still  ever-present. In England it is mostly children.    In France not all the difficulties one meets with _en route_ are  willful obstructors of one's progress. In La Beauce the geese and  ducks are prudent, in the Nivernais the oxen are placid, and in  Provence the donkeys are philosophical; but in Brittany the horses  and mules and their drivers take fright immediately they suspect the  coming of an automobile, and in the Vendee the market-wagons, and  those laden with the product of the vine, career madly at the  extremities of exceedingly lusty examples of horse flesh to the  pending disaster of every one who does not get out of the road.    Sheep and hens are everywhere that they ought not to be, and there  seems no way of escaping them. One can but use all his ingenuity and  slip through somehow. Dogs are bad enough and ought to be  exterminated. They are the silliest beasts which one finds  uncontrolled on the roadways. Children, of course, one defers to, but  they are outrageously careless and very foolish at times, and in  short are the greatest responsibility for the driver in the small  towns of England and France. In France some effort is being made in  the schools to teach them something about a proper regard for  automobile traffic, and with good results; but no one has heard of  anything of the sort being attempted in England.      Chapter II  Travel Talk    [Illustration: Travel Talk]    Touring abroad is nothing new, but, as an amusement for the masses,  it has reached gigantic proportions. The introduction of the railroad  gave it its greatest impetus, and then came the bicycle and the  automobile.    With the railway as the sole means of getting about one was more or  less confined to the beaten track of travel in Continental Europe,  but the automobile has changed all this.    To-day, the Cote d'Azur, from St. Raphael to Menton, as well as the  strip of Norman coast-line around Trouville, in summer, is scarcely  more than a boulevard where the automobile tourist strolls for an  hour as he does in the Bois. The country lying back and between these  two widely separated points is becoming known, and even modern taste  prefers the idyllic countryside to a round of the same dizzy  conventions that one gets in season at Paris, London, or New York.    France is the land _par excellence_ for automobile touring, not only  from its splendid roads, but from the wide diversity of its sights  and scenes, and manners and customs, and, last but not least, its  most excellent hotels strung along its highways and byways like  pearls in a collarette.    This is not saying that travel by automobile is not delightful  elsewhere; certainly it is equally so in many places along the Rhine,  in Northern Italy, and in England, where the chief drawback is the"]]]
