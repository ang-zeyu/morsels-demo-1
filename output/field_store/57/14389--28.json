The whole mythical system is simply one grand demonstration of  human apostacy from the \"true God.\" Homer introduces Zeus in love, and  bitterly complaining and bewailing himself, and plotted against by the  other gods. He represents the gods as suffering at the hands of men. Mars  and Venus were wounded by Di-o-me-de. He says, \"Great Pluto's self the  stinging arrow felt when that same son of Jupiter assailed him in the very  gates of hell, and wrought him keenest anguish. Pierced with pain, to the  high Olympus, to the courts of Jupiter groaning he came. The bitter shaft  remained deep in his shoulder fixed, and grieved his soul.\" In the  mythical system the gods are not presented as creators or first causes.  Homer says, They were in the beginning generated from the waters of the  ocean, and thousands were added by deifying departed heroes and  philosophers. The thought of one supreme Intelligence, the \"God of Gods,\",  runs through all the system of myths. It is found anterior to the myths,  and, therefore, could not have had its origin with them. The character  ascribed to our God, in our scriptures, has no place among the ancient  myths. They hold the \"Master God\" before us only in connection with power,  being altogether ignorant of His true character. They even went so far as  to attribute much to Him that was ridiculous. One of the ancients said,  \"The utmost that a man can do is to attribute to the being he worships his  imperfections and impurities, magnified to infinity, it may be, and then  become worse by their reflex action upon his own nature.\" This was  verified in the ancient mythical religion, without exception, and without  doubt.    \"The character of all the gods was simply human character extended in all  its powers, appetites, lusts and passions. Scholars say there is no  language containing words that express the Scriptural ideas of holiness  and abhorrence of sin, except those in which the Scriptures were given, or  into which they have been translated. These attributes must be known in  order to salvation from sin, so God revealed Himself and gave the world a  pure religion, as a standard of right and wrong, and guide in duty, and  rule of life.\"    The history of the ancient nations of the earth gives a united testimony  that their original progenitors possessed a knowledge of the one true and  living God, who was worshiped by them, and believed to be an infinite,  self-existent and invisible spirit. This notion was never entirely  extinguished even among the idolatrous worshipers. Greek and Latin poets  were great corrupters of theology, yet in the midst of all their Gods  there is still to be found, in their writings, the notion of one supreme  in power and rule, whom they confound with Jupiter.    The age of myths began with the tenth generation after the flood. The  evidence of this is given by Plato from one of the ancient poets in these  words: \"It was the generation _then the tenth_, of men endowed with  speech, since forth the flood had burst upon the men of former times, and  Kronos, Japetus and Titan reigned, whom men of Ouranos proclaimed the  noblest sons, and named them so, because of men _endowed with gift of  speech_, they were the first,\" that is to say, they were orators, \"and  others for their strength, as Heracles and Perseus, and others for their  art. Those to whom either the subjects gave honor, or the rulers  themselves _assuming it_, obtained the name, some from fear, others from  reverence. Thus Antinous, through the benevolence of your ancestors toward  their subjects, came to be regarded as a god. But those who came after  adopted the worship without examination.\" So testifies one who was  schooled in philosophy. Do you say there are points of similitude between  the Bible religion and the mythical? It would be strange if there were  none, seeing that the mythical is truly what the term signifies, a  counterfeit upon the genuine, or Biblical.    The points of disagreement, however, are such as to demonstrate the fact  that the ancient mythical people knew not the character of the Being, whom  they conceived to be the \"God of Gods and the Father of Gods and men.\"  Those who confound the Bible with the ancient myths upon the score of the  analogy that exists between it and the myths, remind me of a very learned  gentleman with whom I was once walking around an oat field, when he  remarked, \"_there_ is a very fine piece of wheat.\" The man had been  brought up in an eastern city, and was unable to distinguish between oats  and wheat. I knew a gentleman who asked a man, standing by the side of an  old-fashioned flax-break, what he thought it was used for? The man took  hold of the handle, lifted it up and let it down a few times, and said:  \"It looks like it might be used to chop up sausage meat.\" It is very  natural for us to draw comparisons, and when we do not make ourselves  familiar with things and their uses, we are very liable to be led into  error by a few points of similitude. All the infidels with whom I have  become acquainted look upon the Bible like the man looked upon the  flax-break, and like the man looked upon the oat field. If one had looked  upon the flax-break who was familiar with it, he never could have dreamed  of chopping sausage meat; and if the other had been familiar with wheat  and oats, as they present themselves to the eye in the field in the month  of June, he never would have called the oats wheat. And if any sane man  will make himself familiar with both the Bible and the old system of myths  and mythical worship, he will never confound the two. There are a thousand  things, very different in character and origin, which have points of  similitude. But similitude never proves identity short of completeness.  While the analogy between the ancient mythical system of gods and their  worship and the true God and His worship is restricted to power and  intelligence, there exists a contrast between them deep as heaven is high  and broad as the earth in point of moral character, virtue, and every  ennobling and lovable attribute.    There is an old myth in the Vedas--a god called \"Chrishna.\" The Vedas claim  that he is in the form of a man; that he is black; that he is dressed in  flowers and ribbons; that he is the father of a great many gods. It is  surprising to see the eagerness with which some men bring up \"Chrishna\" in  comparison with the Greek term \"Christos\"--Christ, and confound the two.  The words are entirely different, save in a jingle of sound. They are no  more alike than the terms _catechist_--one who instructs by questions and  answers, and the term catechu--a dry, brown astringent extract. We could  give many such examples in the history of unbelievers and their war upon  the Bible, but this must suffice for the present. The truth is this: such  men, as a general rule, neither understand the Bible in its teachings and  character, nor the ancient mythical system. In it Jupiter, among the  Romans, and throughout every language, appears before us as the \"Father of  Gods and men\"--\"the God of gods,\" the \"Master of the gods.\" Voltaire says:  It is false that Cicero, or any other Roman, ever said that it did not  become the majesty of the empire to acknowledge a Supreme God. Their  Jupiter, the Zeus of the Greeks and the Jehovah of the Phonecians, was  always considered as the master of the secondary gods. He adds: But is not  Jupiter, the master of all the gods, a word belonging to every nation,  from the Euphrates to the Tiber? Among the first Romans it was _Jov_,  _Jovis_; among the Greeks, _Zeus_; among the Phonecians and Syrians and  Egyptians, _Jehovah_. The last term is the Hebrew scriptural name of  God--denoting _permanent being_--in perfect keeping with the Bible title or  descriptive appellation, \"I AM THAT I AM.\"    The ancient worshipers of the gods had lost all but the name, _power_ and  relation, which they ever knew of Jehovah. And they could do no more than  clothe Jupiter with their own imperfections and impurities--and then place  him above all the gods; it was necessary for them to view him as excelling  in all the characteristics of the secondary gods. And having attributed to  the gods all they knew of human passions and corruptions, they clothed  Jupiter himself with more villainy and corruption than belonged to any  other god. In this was the great blasphemous sacrilege of ancient  idolatry. They thus demonstrated their own apostacy; and the fact that  their system of gods was a counterfeit, a mythical system. They were  destitute of any standard of right and wrong, having no conceptions of the  divine character which were not drawn from their own imperfect and corrupt  lives. The divine character, as revealed in the revelation of Christ, and  presented to us as God manifest in the flesh, is at once the very opposite  of the characters given in the myths. The distance between the two is the  distance between the lowest degradation of God-like power exercised in the  lowest passions, and the sublimity of Heaven's own spotless life. I love  the religion of the Scriptures, because it restores to the race the lost  knowledge of God and the additional life of Jesus--the only perfect model  known in the history of the race. It is the life of God manifested in the  flesh; make it _your own_, and it will save you. Mr. English, an American  infidel, said: \"Far be it from me to reproach the meek and compassionate,  the amiable Jesus, or to attribute to him the mischiefs occasioned by his  followers.\"    It is now conceded that Jesus Christ was _no myth_ by all the great minds  in unbelief. He lived. We love his life, because all who would rob Him of  His authority are compelled to speak well of it. Rousseau, another  infidel, says: \"It is impossible that he whose history the gospel records  can be but a man,\" adding, \"Does he speak in the tone of an "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/28198"],[0,"A Budget of Christmas Tales (#2)"],[1,"a merry Christmas. I'll retire to Bedlam.\"    This lunatic, in letting Scrooge's nephew out, had let two other people  in. They were portly gentlemen, pleasant to behold, and now stood, with  their hats off, in Scrooge's office. They had books and papers in their  hands, and bowed to him.    \"Scrooge and Marley's, I believe,\" said one of the gentlemen, referring  to his list. \"Have I the pleasure of addressing Mr. Scrooge, or Mr.  Marley?\"    \"Mr. Marley has been dead these seven years,\" Scrooge replied. \"He died  seven years ago, this very night.\"    \"We have no doubt his liberality is well represented by his surviving  partner,\" said the gentleman, presenting his credentials.    It certainly was; for they had been two kindred spirits. At the ominous  word \"liberality,\" Scrooge frowned, and shook his head, and handed the  credentials back.    \"At this festive season of the year, Mr. Scrooge,\" said the gentleman,  taking up a pen, \"it is more than usually desirable that we should make  some slight provision for the poor and destitute, who suffer greatly at  the present time. Many thousands are in want of common necessaries;  hundreds of thousands are in want of common comforts, sir.\"    \"Are there no prisons?\" asked Scrooge.    \"Plenty of prisons,\" said the gentleman, laying down the pen again.    \"And the Union workhouses?\" demanded Scrooge. \"Are they still in  operation?\"    \"They are. Still,\" returned the gentleman, \"I wish I could say they were  not. Under the impression that they scarcely furnish Christian cheer of  mind or body to the multitude, a few of us are endeavoring to raise a  fund to buy the poor some meat and drink, and means of warmth. We choose  this time, because it is a time, of all others, when Want is keenly  felt, and Abundance rejoices. What shall I put you down for?\"    \"Nothing!\" Scrooge replied.    \"You wish to be anonymous?\"    \"I wish to be left alone,\" said Scrooge. \"Since you ask me what I wish,  gentlemen, that is my answer. I don't make merry myself at Christmas,  and I can't afford to make idle people merry. I help to support the  establishments I have mentioned--they cost enough; and those who are  badly off must go there.\"    \"Many can't go there; and many would rather die.\"    \"If they would rather die,\" said Scrooge, \"they had better do it, and  decrease the surplus population. Besides--excuse me--I don't know that.\"    \"But you might know it,\" observed the gentleman.    \"It's not my business,\" Scrooge returned. \"It's enough for a man to  understand his own business, and not to interfere with other people's.  Mine occupies me constantly. Good afternoon, gentlemen!\"    Seeing clearly that it would be useless to pursue their point, the  gentlemen withdrew. Scrooge resumed his labors with an improved opinion  of himself, and in a more facetious temper than was usual with him.    At length the hour of shutting up the counting-house arrived. With an  ill-will Scrooge dismounted from his stool, and tacitly admitted the  fact to the expectant clerk in the tank, who instantly snuffed his  candle out, and put on his hat.    \"You'll want all day to-morrow, I suppose?\" said Scrooge.    \"If quite convenient, sir.\"    \"It's not convenient,\" said Scrooge, \"and it's not fair. If I was to  stop half-a-crown for it, you'd think yourself ill-used, I'll be bound?\"    The clerk smiled faintly.    \"And yet,\" said Scrooge, \"you don't think _me_ ill-used, when I pay a  day's wages for no work.\"    The clerk observed that it was only once a year.    \"A poor excuse for picking a man's pocket every twenty-fifth of  December!\" said Scrooge, buttoning his great coat to the chin. \"But I  suppose you must have the whole day. Be here all the earlier next  morning.\"    The clerk promised that he would; and Scrooge walked out with a growl.  The office was closed in a twinkling, and the clerk, with the long ends  of his white comforter dangling below his waist (for he boasted no great  coat), went down a slide on Cornhill, at the end of a lane of boys,  twenty times, in honor of its being Christmas-eve, and then ran home to  Camden Town as hard as he could pelt, to play at blindman's buff.    Scrooge took his melancholy dinner in his usual melancholy tavern; and  having read all the newspapers, and beguiled the rest of the evening  with his banker's-book, went home to bed. He lived in chambers which had  once belonged to his deceased partner. They were a gloomy suite of  rooms, in a lowering pile of building up a yard, where it had so little  business to be, that one could scarcely help fancying it must have run  there when it was a young house, playing at hide-and-seek with other  houses, and have forgotten the way out again. It was old enough now, and  dreary enough; for nobody lived in it but Scrooge, the other rooms being  all let out as offices.    Every room above, and every cask in the wine-merchant's cellars below,  appeared to have a separate peal of echoes of its own. Scrooge was not a  man to be frightened by echoes. He fastened the door, and walked across  the hall, and up the stairs; slowly too: trimming his candle as he went.  Half a dozen gas-lamps out of the street wouldn't have lighted the  entry too well, so you may suppose that it was pretty dark with  Scrooge's dip.    Up Scrooge went, not caring a button for that. Darkness is cheap, and  Scrooge liked it. But before he shut his heavy door, he walked through  his rooms to see that all was right.    Quite satisfied, he closed his door, and locked himself in;  double-locked himself in, which was not his custom. Thus secured against  surprise, he, took off his cravat; put on his dressing gown and  slippers, and his night-cap; and sat down before the fire to take his  gruel. As he threw his head back in the chair, his glance happened to  rest upon a bell, a disused bell, that hung in the room, and  communicated for some purpose now forgotten with a chamber in the  highest story of the building. It was with great astonishment, and with  a strange, inexplicable dread, that as he looked, he saw this bell begin  to swing. It swung so softly in the outset that it scarcely made a  sound; but soon it rang out loudly, and so did every bell in the house.    This might have lasted half a minute, or a minute, but it seemed an  hour. The bells ceased as they had begun, together. They were succeeded  by a clanking noise deep down below, as if some person were dragging a  heavy chain over the casks in the wine-merchant's cellar. Scrooge then  remembered to have heard that ghosts in haunted houses were described as  dragging chains.    The cellar-door flew open with a booming sound, and then he heard the  noise much louder, on the floors below; then coming up the stairs; then  coming straight toward his door.    \"It's humbug still!\" said Scrooge. \"I won't believe it.\"    His color changed though, when, without a pause, it came on through the  heavy door, and passed into the room before his eyes. Upon its coming  in, the dying flame leaped up, as though it cried \"I know him! Marley's  ghost!\" and fell again.    The same face: the very same. The chain he drew was clasped about his  middle. It was long and wound about him like a tail; and it was made  (for Scrooge observed it closely) of cash-boxes, keys, padlocks,  ledgers, deeds, and heavy purses wrought in steel.    \"How now\" said Scrooge, caustic and cold as ever. \"What do you want with  me?\"    \"Much!\"--Marley's voice, no doubt about it.    \"Who are you?\"    \"Ask me who I _was_.\"    \"Who _were_ you then?\" said Scrooge, raising his voice. \"You're  particular, for a shade.\" He was going to say \"_to_ a shade,\" but  substituted this, as more appropriate.    \"In life I was your partner, Jacob Marley.\"    \"Can you--can you sit down?\" asked Scrooge, looking doubtfully at him.    \"I can.\"    \"Do it, then.\"    Scrooge asked the question, because he didn't know whether a ghost so  transparent might find himself in a condition to take a chair; and felt  that in the event of its being impossible, it might involve the  necessity of an embarrassing explanation. But the Ghost sat down on the  opposite side of the fireplace, as if he were quite used to it.    Scrooge fell upon his knees, and clasped his hands before his face.    \"Mercy!\" he said, \"Dreadful apparition, why do you trouble me?\"    \"Man of the worldly mind!\" replied the Ghost, \"do you believe in me or  not?\"    \"I do,\" said Scrooge. \"I must. But why do spirits walk the earth, and  why do they come to me?\"    \"It is required of every man,\" the Ghost returned, \"that the spirit  within him should walk abroad among his fellow-men, and travel far and  wide; and if that spirit goes not forth in life, it is condemned to do  so after death. It is doomed to wander through the world--oh, woe is  me!--and witness what it cannot share, but might have shared on earth,  and turned to happiness!\"    The spectre raised a cry, and shook its chain and wrung its shadowy  hands.    \"You are fettered,\" said Scrooge, trembling. \"Tell me why?\"    \"I wear the chain I forged in life,\" replied the Ghost. \"I made it link  by link, and yard by yard; I girded it on of my own free will, and of my  own free will I wore it. Is its pattern strange to _you_?\"    Scrooge trembled more and more.    \"Or would you know,\" pursued the Ghost, \"the weight and length of the  strong coil you bear yourself? It was full as heavy and as long as this,  seven Christmas Eves ago. You have labored on it since. It is a  ponderous chain!\"    Scrooge glanced about him on the floor, in the expectation of finding  himself surrounded by some fifty or sixty fathoms of iron cable; but he  could see nothing.    \"Jacob,\" he said imploringly. \"Old Jacob Marley, tell me more. Speak  comfort to me, Jacob!\"    \"I have none to give,\" the Ghost replied. \"It comes from other regions,  Ebenezer Scrooge, and is conveyed by other ministers, to other kinds of  men. Nor can I tell you what I would. A very little more, is"]]]
