And from the superior  knowledge of his four years, Oley already knew a better way to make  shorts. Neatles make good shorts. Juice don't do so well.    Suddenly, Oley decided to prove his point: Nice neatles probably made  even better shorts than other neatles--and there was a big electric  running up the side of the stairs--an electric fat enough to make a real  good shorts. Maybe lots of shorts.    Raising his nice neatle, Oley took careful aim and plunged it through  the 220-volt stove feeder cable.           *       *       *       *       *    Oley woke up. The strange pretty lady in white was a new experience.  Somebody he hadn't seen before. And there seemed to be something wrong  with his hand, but Oley hadn't noticed it very much, yet.    \"Well, my little Hero's awake! And how are you this morning? Your Momma  and Poppa will be in to see you in just a minute.\"    The pretty lady in white went away, and Oley gazed around the white room  with its funny shape, happily recorded the experience, and dozed off  again.    Then suddenly he was awakened again. Momma was there; and Poppa. And  Sven. But they all seemed different somehow this morning. Momma had been  crying, even though she was smiling bravely now. And Poppa seemed to  have a new softness that he'd seldom seen before. Sven was looking  puzzled.    \"I still say, Pop, that he's a genius. He _must_ have known what he was  doing.\"    \"Oley,\" Poppa's voice was husky--gruff, but kinder and softer than  usual. \"I want you to answer me carefully. But understand that it's all  right either way. I just want you to tell me. Why did you put the ice  pick through the stove cable? You saved my life, you know. But I'd like  to know how you knew how.\"    Little Oley grinned. His world was peaceful and wonderful now. And all  the big adults were bending and leaning down and talking to him.    \"Nice neatle,\" he said. \"Big electric. Poppa needed shorts.\"          Transcriber's Note:        This etext was produced from _Analog Science Fact & Fiction_ January      1964.

We have seen one of those people. I propose that,  since they cannot come to us, we go to them. I have made preparations  to go to them, and I wanted you to have the opportunity of going with  me, if you wish.\"    \"But how, Mercer? And what--\"           *       *       *       *       *    He interrupted with a quick, nervous gesture.    \"I'll show you, presently. I believe it can be done. It will be a  dangerous adventure, though; I was not joking when I advised you to  make your will. An uncertain venture, too. But, I believe, most  wonderfully worth while.\" His eyes were shining now with all the  enthusiasm of the scientist, the dreamer.    \"It sounds mighty appealing,\" I said. \"But how....\"    \"Finish your drink and I'll show you.\"    I downed what was left of my highball in two mighty gulps.    \"Lead me to it, Mercer!\"    He smiled his quiet smile and led the way to what had been the  billiard room of \"The Billows,\" but which was the laboratory of \"The  Monstrosity.\" The first thing my eyes fell upon were two gleaming  metal objects suspended from chains let into the ceiling.    \"Diving suits,\" explained Mercer. \"Rather different from anything  you've ever seen.\"    They were different. The body was a perfect globe, as was the  head-piece. The legs were cylindrical, jointed at knee and thigh with  huge discs. The feet were solid metal, curved rocker-like on the  bottom, and at the ends of the arms were three hooked talons, the  concave sides of two talons facing the concave side of the third. The  arms were hinged at the elbow just as the legs were hinged, but there  was a huge ball-and-socket joint at the shoulder.           *       *       *       *       *    \"But Mercer!\" I protested. \"No human being could even stand up with  that weight of metal on and around him!\"    \"You're mistaken, Taylor,\" smiled Mercer. \"That is not solid metal,  you see. And it is an aluminum alloy that is not nearly as heavy as it  looks. There are two walls, slightly over an inch apart, braced by  innumerable trusses. The fabric is nearly as strong as that much solid  metal, and infinitely lighter. They work all right, Taylor. I know,  because I've tried them.\"    \"And this hump on the back?\" I asked, walking around the odd, dangling  figures, hanging like bloated metal skeletons from their chains. I  had thought the bodies were perfect globes; I could see now that at  the rear there was a humplike excrescence across the shoulders.    \"Air,\" explained Mercer. \"There are two other tanks inside the  globular body. That shape was adopted, by the way, because a globe can  withstand more pressure than any other shape. And we may have to go  where pressures are high.\"    \"And so,\" I said, \"we don these things and stroll out into the  Atlantic looking for the girl and her friends?\"    \"Hardly. They're not quite the apparel for so long a stroll. You  haven't seen all the marvels yet. Come along!\"           *       *       *       *       *    He led the way through the patio, beside the pool in which our strange  visitor from the depths had lived during her brief stay with us, and  out into the open again. As we neared the sea, I became aware, for the  first time, of a faint, muffled hammering sound, and I glanced at  Mercer inquiringly.    \"Just a second,\" he smiled. \"Then--there she is, Taylor!\"    I stood still and stared. In a little cove, cradled in a cunning,  spidery structure of wood, a submarine rested upon the ways.    \"Good Lord!\" I exclaimed. \"You're going into this right, Mercer!\"    \"Yes. Because I think it's immensely worth while. But come along and  let me show you the _Santa Maria_--named after the flagship of  Columbus' little fleet. Come on!\"    Two men with army automatics strapped significantly to their belts  nodded courteously as we came up. They were the only men in sight, but  from the hammering going on inside there must have been quite a  sizeable crew busy in the interior. A couple of raw pine shacks, some  little distance away, provided quarters for, I judged, twenty or  thirty men.    \"Had her shipped down in pieces,\" explained Mercer. \"The boat that  brought it lay to off shore and we lightered the parts ashore. A  tremendous job. But she'll be ready for the water in a week; ten days  at the latest.\"    \"You're a wonder,\" I said, and I meant it.           *       *       *       *       *    Mercer patted the red-leaded side of the submarine affectionately.  \"Later,\" he said, \"I'll take you inside, but they're busy as the devil  in there, and the sound of the hammers fairly makes your head ring.  You'll see it all later, anyway--if you feel you'd like to share the  adventure with me?\"    \"Listen,\" I grinned as we turned back towards the house, \"it'll take  more than those two lads with the pop-guns to keep me out of the  _Santa Maria_ when she sails--or dives, or whatever it is she's  supposed to do!\"    Mercer laughed softly, and we walked the rest of the way in silence. I  imagine we were both pretty busy with our thoughts; I know that I was.  And several times, as we walked along, I looked back over my shoulder  towards the ungainly red monster straddling on her spindling wooden  legs--and towards the smiling Atlantic, glistening serenely in the  sun.           *       *       *       *       *    Mercer was so busy with a thousand and one details that I found myself  very much in the way if I followed him around, so I decided to loaf.    For weeks after we had put our strange girl visitor back into the sea  from whence Mercer had taken her, I had watched from a comfortable  seat well above the high-water mark that commanded that section of  shore. For I had felt sure by that last strange gesture of hers that  she meant to return.    I located my old seat, and I found that it had been used a great deal  since I had left it. There were whole winnows of cigarette butts, some  of them quite fresh, all around. Mercer, cold-blooded scientist as he  was, had hoped against hope that she would return too.    It was a very comfortable seat, in the shade of a little cluster of  palms, and for the next several days I spent most of my time there,  reading and smoking--and watching. No matter how interesting the book,  I found myself, every few seconds, lifting my eyes to search the beach  and the sea.    I am not sure, but I think it was the eighth day after my arrival that  I looked up and saw, for the first time, something besides the smiling  beach and the ceaseless procession of incoming rollers. For an instant  I doubted what I saw; then, with a cry that stuck in my throat, I  dropped my book unheeded to the sand and raced towards the shore.           *       *       *       *       *    She was there! White and slim, her pale gold hair clinging to her body  and gleaming like polished metal in the sun, she stood for a moment,  while the spray frothed at her thighs. Behind her, crouching below the  surface, I could distinguish two other forms. She had returned, and  not alone!    One long, slim arm shot out toward me, held level with the shoulder:  the well-remembered gesture of greeting. Then she too crouched below  the surface that she might breathe.    As I ran out onto the wet sand, the waves splashing around my ankles  all unheeded, she rose again, and now I could see her lovely smile,  and her dark, glowing eyes. I was babbling--I do not know what. Before  I could reach her, she smiled and sank again below the surface.    I waded on out, laughing excitedly, and as I came close to her, she  bobbed up again out of the spray, and we greeted each other in the  manner of her people, hands outstretched, each gripping the shoulder  of the other.    She made a quick motion then, with both hands, as though she placed a  cap upon the shining glory of her head, and I understood in an instant  what she wished: the antenna of Mercer's thought-telegraph, by the  aid of which she had told us the story of herself and her people.           *       *       *       *       *    I nodded and smiled, and pointed to the spot where she stood, trying  to show her by my expression that I understood, and by my gesture,  that she was to wait here for me. She smiled and nodded in return, and  crouched again below the surface of the heaving sea.    As I turned toward the beach, I caught a momentary glimpse of the two  who had come with her. They were a man and a woman, watching me with  wide, half-curious, half-frightened eyes. I recognized them instantly  from the picture she had impressed upon my mind nearly a year ago. She  had brought with her on her journey her mother and her father.    Stumbling, my legs shaking with excitement, I ran through the water.  With my wet trousers flapping against my ankles, I sprinted towards  the house.    I found Mercer in the laboratory. He looked up as I came rushing in,  wet from the shoulders down, and I saw his eyes grow suddenly wide.           *       *       *       *       *    I opened my mouth to speak, but I was breathless. And Mercer took the  words from my mouth before I could utter them.    \"She's come back!\" he cried. \"She's come back! Taylor--she has?\" He  gripped me, his fingers like steel clamps, shaking me with his amazing  strength.    \"Yes.\" I found my breath and my voice at the same instant. \"She's  there, just where we put her into the sea, and there are two others  with her--her mother and her father. Come on, Mercer, and bring your  thought gadget!\"    \"I can't!\" he groaned. \"I've built an improvement on it into the  diving armor, and a central instrument on the sub, but the old  apparatus is strewn all over the table, here, just as it was when we  used it the other time. We'll have to bring her here.\"    \"Get a basin, then!\" I said. \"We'll carry her back to the pool just as  we took her from it. Hurry!\"    And we did just that. Mercer snatched up a huge glass basin used in  his chemistry experiments, and we raced down to the shore. As well as  we could we"]]]
