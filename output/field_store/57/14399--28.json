[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/2849"],[0,"Against Apion (#2)"],[1,"true history; for it is the great character of true history  that all concerned therein both speak and write the same things; while  these men, by writing differently about the same things, think they  shall be believed to write with the greatest regard to truth. We  therefore [who are Jews] must yield to the Grecian writers as to  language and eloquence of composition; but then we shall give them no  such preference as to the verity of ancient history, and least of all as  to that part which concerns the affairs of our own several countries.    6. As to the care of writing down the records from the earliest  antiquity among the Egyptians and Babylonians; that the priests were  intrusted therewith, and employed a philosophical concern about it; that  they were the Chaldean priests that did so among the Babylonians; and  that the Phoenicians, who were mingled among the Greeks, did especially  make use of their letters, both for the common affairs of life, and for  the delivering down the history of common transactions, I think I may  omit any proof, because all men allow it so to be. But now as to our  forefathers, that they took no less care about writing such records,  [for I will not say they took greater care than the others I spoke of,]  and that they committed that matter to their high priests and to their  prophets, and that these records have been written all along down to our  own times with the utmost accuracy; nay, if it be not too bold for me  to say it, our history will be so written hereafter;--I shall endeavor  briefly to inform you.    7. For our forefathers did not only appoint the best of these priests,  and those that attended upon the Divine worship, for that design from  the beginning, but made provision that the stock of the priests should  continue unmixed and pure; for he who is partaker of the priesthood must  propagate of a wife of the same nation, without having any regard to  money, or any other dignities; but he is to make a scrutiny, and take  his wife's genealogy from the ancient tables, and procure many witnesses  to it. [7] And this is our practice not only in Judea, but wheresoever  any body of men of our nation do live; and even there an exact catalogue  of our priests' marriages is kept; I mean at Egypt and at Babylon, or  in any other place of the rest of the habitable earth, whithersoever our  priests are scattered; for they send to Jerusalem the ancient names of  their parents in writing, as well as those of their remoter ancestors,  and signify who are the witnesses also. But if any war falls out,  such as have fallen out a great many of them already, when Antiochus  Epiphanes made an invasion upon our country, as also when Pompey the  Great and Quintilius Varus did so also, and principally in the wars that  have happened in our own times, those priests that survive them  compose new tables of genealogy out of the old records, and examine the  circumstances of the women that remain; for still they do not admit of  those that have been captives, as suspecting that they had conversation  with some foreigners. But what is the strongest argument of our exact  management in this matter is what I am now going to say, that we have  the names of our high priests from father to son set down in our records  for the interval of two thousand years; and if any of these have been  transgressors of these rules, they are prohibited to present themselves  at the altar, or to be partakers of any other of our purifications; and  this is justly, or rather necessarily done, because every one is  not permitted of his own accord to be a writer, nor is there any  disagreement in what is written; they being only prophets that have  written the original and earliest accounts of things as they learned  them of God himself by inspiration; and others have written what hath  happened in their own times, and that in a very distinct manner also.    8. For we have not an innumerable multitude of books among us,  disagreeing from and contradicting one another, [as the Greeks have,]  but only twenty-two books, [8] which contain the records of all the past  times; which are justly believed to be divine; and of them five belong  to Moses, which contain his laws and the traditions of the origin of  mankind till his death. This interval of time was little short of three  thousand years; but as to the time from the death of Moses till the  reign of Artaxerxes king of Persia, who reigned after Xerxes, the  prophets, who were after Moses, wrote down what was done in their times  in thirteen books. The remaining four books contain hymns to God, and  precepts for the conduct of human life. It is true, our history hath  been written since Artaxerxes very particularly, but hath not been  esteemed of the like authority with the former by our forefathers,  because there hath not been an exact succession of prophets since that  time; and how firmly we have given credit to these books of our own  nation is evident by what we do; for during so many ages as have already  passed, no one has been so bold as either to add any thing to them,  to take any thing from them, or to make any change in them; but it is  become natural to all Jews immediately, and from their very birth, to  esteem these books to contain Divine doctrines, and to persist in them,  and, if occasion be willingly to die for them. For it is no new thing  for our captives, many of them in number, and frequently in time, to  be seen to endure racks and deaths of all kinds upon the theatres, that  they may not be obliged to say one word against our laws and the records  that contain them; whereas there are none at all among the Greeks who  would undergo the least harm on that account, no, nor in case all the  writings that are among them were to be destroyed; for they take them to  be such discourses as are framed agreeably to the inclinations of those  that write them; and they have justly the same opinion of the ancient  writers, since they see some of the present generation bold enough to  write about such affairs, wherein they were not present, nor had concern  enough to inform themselves about them from those that knew them;  examples of which may be had in this late war of ours, where some  persons have written histories, and published them, without having been  in the places concerned, or having been near them when the actions were  done; but these men put a few things together by hearsay, and insolently  abuse the world, and call these writings by the name of Histories.    9. As for myself, I have composed a true history of that whole war, and  of all the particulars that occurred therein, as having been concerned  in all its transactions; for I acted as general of those among us that  are named Galileans, as long as it was possible for us to make any  opposition. I was then seized on by the Romans, and became a captive.  Vespasian also and Titus had me kept under a guard, and forced me to  attend them continually. At the first I was put into bonds, but was  set at liberty afterward, and sent to accompany Titus when he came  from Alexandria to the siege of Jerusalem; during which time there was  nothing done which escaped my knowledge; for what happened in the  Roman camp I saw, and wrote down carefully; and what informations the  deserters brought [out of the city], I was the only man that understood  them. Afterward I got leisure at Rome; and when all my materials were  prepared for that work, I made use of some persons to assist me in  learning the Greek tongue, and by these means I composed the history  of those transactions. And I was so well assured of the truth of what  I related, that I first of all appealed to those that had the supreme  command in that war, Vespasian and Titus, as witnesses for me, for to  them I presented those books first of all, and after them to many of the  Romans who had been in the war. I also sold them to many of our own men  who understood the Greek philosophy; among whom were Julius Archelaus,  Herod [king of Chalcis], a person of great gravity, and king Agrippa  himself, a person that deserved the greatest admiration. Now all these  men bore their testimony to me, that I had the strictest regard to  truth; who yet would not have dissembled the matter, nor been silent, if  I, out of ignorance, or out of favor to any side, either had given false  colors to actions, or omitted any of them.    10. There have been indeed some bad men, who have attempted to  calumniate my history, and took it to be a kind of scholastic  performance for the exercise of young men. A strange sort of accusation  and calumny this! since every one that undertakes to deliver the history  of actions truly ought to know them accurately himself in the first  place, as either having been concerned in them himself, or been informed  of them by such as knew them. Now both these methods of knowledge I may  very properly pretend to in the composition of both my works; for, as I  said, I have translated the Antiquities out of our sacred books; which I  easily could do, since I was a priest by my birth, and have studied that  philosophy which is contained in those writings: and for the History  of the War, I wrote it as having been an actor myself in many of its  transactions, an eye-witness in the greatest part of the rest, and was  not unacquainted with any thing whatsoever that was either said or  done in it. How impudent then must those deserve to be esteemed that  undertake to contradict me about the true state of those affairs!  who, although they pretend to have made use of both the emperors' own  memoirs, yet could not they he acquainted with our affairs who fought  against them.    11. This digression I have been obliged to make out of necessity, as  being desirous to expose the vanity of those that profess to write  histories; and I suppose I have sufficiently declared that this custom  of transmitting down the histories of ancient times"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/28491"],[0,"Dishes & Beverages of the Old South (#2)"],[1,"of it, and another, even branchier, shading the log foot-way  between. The house offered only grown-up talk, which rarely interested  me. In the kitchen I caught scraps of Brer Rabbit's history, pithily  applied, other scraps of song--Mammy always \"gave out\" the words to  herself before singing them--proverbs and sayings such as \"Cow want her  tail agin in fly-time\" applied to an ingrate, or: \"Dat's er high kick  fer er low horse,\" by way of setting properly in place a pretender.    Best of all, I got the latest news of the countryside for ten miles  around. Wireless has little on the way things ran about among the  plantations. It was a point of honor among the black men to have wives  or sweethearts away from home. This meant running about  nightly--consequently cross-currents of gossip lively enough to make the  yellowest journal turn green with envy. Mammy was a trifle apologetic  over having a husband no further off than the next neighbor's. To make  up for it, however, the husbands who came to his house lived from three  to five miles away--and one of them worked at the mill, hence was a  veritable human chronicle. Thus Mammy was able to hold her head up with  Susan, her sister, who milked and washed.    Susan might have been called a widow of degrees--she had had three  husbands, but only two were living. The last parting was always  threatening to end in meeting over again--still that did not hinder her  cabin from being the rendezvous of all the likeliest fellows within easy  walking range. Naturally she had things to tell--worth hearing whether  or no they were true. So also had Phoebe, who was a sort of scullion,  fetching in wood and water, gathering vegetables, picking chickens,  scouring all things from the big pot to the floor. Shelves were scoured  daily, the floor three times a week. This had to be a matter of faith  after an hour or so--it certainly did not look it. Sweeping, done three  times a day, was largely a matter of form. Phoebe went conscientiously  over the uncluttered spaces, and even reached the nose of her broom  between pots and ovens, but only coarse trash gathered before the  broom--all the rest went through the cracks.    Mammy said Phoebe's news could be believed. \"De gal don't know no mo'n  ter tell dest whut she done heard.\" She truly was slow-witted and  slow-spoken, but Isham, her step-father, was cook to the Gresham  brothers, the beaux of the neighborhood, who kept bachelor's hall. His  mother had been their Mammy--hence his inherited privilege of knowing  rather more about his young masters than they knew themselves.    Little pitchers have big ears. Set it to the credit of the black folk,  they always had regard for the innocence of childhood. Scandal was  merely breathed--not even so hinted as to arouse curiosity. Foul speech  I never heard from them nor a trace of profanity. What I did hear was a  liberal education in the humanities--as time passes I rate more and more  highly the sense of values it fixed in a plastic mind. I think it must  have been because our Mammys saw all things from the elemental angle,  they were critics so illuminating of manners and morals.    Here ends reminiscence, set down in hope it may breed understanding. All  I actually learned from Mammy and her cooking was--how things ought to  taste. The which is essential. It has been the pole-star of my career as  a cook. Followed faithfully along the Way of Many Failures, through a  Country of Tribulations, it has brought me into the haven of knowledge  absolute. If the testimony of empty plates and smiling guests can  establish a fact, then I am a good cook--though limited. I profess only  to cook the things I care to cook well. Hence I have set my hand to  this, a real cook's book. Most cook books are written by folk who cook  by hearsay--it is the fewest number of real cooks who can write so as  not to bewilder the common or garden variety of mind. The bulk of what  follows has an old-time Southern foundation, with such frillings as  experience approves. To it there will be added somewhat of Creole  cookery, learned and proved here in New York town by grace of Milly, the  very queen of New Orleans cooks, temporarily transplanted. Also sundry  and several delectable dishes of alien origins--some as made in France  or Germany, some from the far Philippines, but all proved before record.  In each case the source is indicated in the title. Things my very own,  evolved from my inner consciousness, my outer opportunity and  environment, I shall likewise mark personal.    Lastly, but far from leastly, let me make protest against  over-elaboration, alike in food and the serving thereof. The very best  decoration for a table is something good in the plates. This is not  saying one should not plan to please the eye no less than the palate.  But ribbon on sandwiches is an anachronism--so is all the flummery of  silk and laces, doilies and doo-dads that so often bewilder us. They are  unfair to the food--as hard to live up to as anybody's blue china. I  smile even yet, remembering my husband's chuckles, after we had come  home from eating delicatessen chicken off ten-dollar plates, by help of  antique silver. Somehow the viands and the service seemed \"out of  drawing.\"    Quoth Heine the cynic: \"Woman, woman! Much must be forgiven thee! Thou  hast loved much--and many.\" Edibly I love much rather than many. Enough  of one thoroughly good thing, with proper accessories, is more  satisfying than seven courses--each worse than the last. Also cheaper,  also much less trouble. If time has any value, the economy of it in  dishwashing alone is worth considering. In these piping days of rising  prices, economy sounds good, even in the abstract. Add the concrete fact  that you save money as well as trouble, and the world of cooks may well  sit up and take notice.    The one-piece dinner is as convenient and comfortable as the one-piece  frock. There are, of course, occasions to which it is unsuited.  One-piece must be understood to mean the _piece de resistance_--the  backbone of subsistence as it were. A bowl of rich soup or chowder, with  crackers on the side, a generous helping of well-cooked meat, with bread  or potatoes, and the simplest relishes, or a royally fat pudding overrun  with brandy sauce; each or either can put it all over a splash of this,  a dab of that, a slab of something else, set lonesomely on a separate  plate and reckoned a meal--in courses. Courses are all well enough--they  have my warm heart when they come \"in the picture.\" But when they are  mostly \"The substance of things hoped for, the evidence of things not  seen,\" then I would trade them, and gladly, for as much good bread and  butter as appetite called for.    By way of postscript: being a strict and ardent advocate of temperance,  I refused to consider writing this book unless I had full liberty to  advise the use of wine, brandy, cordials, liquors, where good cooking  demands them. Any earthly thing can be abused--to teach right use is the  best preventive of abuse. Liquors, like everything else, must be good.  \"Cooking sherry\" is as much an abomination as \"cooking butter,\" or  \"cooking apples.\" You will never get out of pot or pan anything  fundamentally better than what went into it. Cooking is not alchemy;  there is no magic in the pot. The whole art and mystery of it is to  apply heat and seasoning in such fashion as to make the best, and the  most, of such food supplies as your purse permits. Tough meat cannot be  cooked tender; tainted meat cannot be cooked sound. It is the same with  stale fish, specked or soured fruit, withered vegetables. It pays to  educate tradesfolk into understanding that you want the best and only  the best of what you buy. If the thing you want, in perfect condition,  is beyond your means, take, instead of a lower grade of it, the highest  grade of something cheaper. So shall you escape waste of time, effort  and substance. Never mind sneers at your simple fare. Remember it was  Solomon the Wise who wrote: \"Better a dinner of herbs and contentment  than a stalled ox, and contention therewith.\" Paraphrase the last clause  into \"spoiled ox and ptomaines therewith,\" and you may keep not only  self-respect, but that of the neighbors.          [Illustration: _The Staff of Life_]      Bread, more than almost any other foodstuff, can not be better than what  it is made of. Here as elsewhere a bungler can ruin the very best of  flour or meal. But the queen of cooks can not make good a fundamental  deficiency.    Hence in buying flour look for these things: a slightly creamy  cast--dazzling whiteness shows bleaching, as a gray-white, or black  specks mean grinding from spoiled grain. The feel should be velvety,  with no trace of roughness--roughness means, commonly, mixture with  corn. A handful tightly gripped should keep the shape of the hand, and  show to a degree the markings of the palm. A pinch wet rather stiff,  and stretched between thumb and finger, will show by the length of the  thread it spins richness or poverty in gluten--one of the most valuable  food elements.    The cornmeal of commerce will not be satisfactory in any receipt here  given. It has been bolted and kiln-dried out of all natural flavor. Take  the trouble to get meal water-ground, from white flint corn, and fresh  from the mill. Then you will have something worth spending time and  effort upon--spending them hopefully. Why, the wisest man can not  tell--but steam-ground meal is of a flavor wholly unlike that  water-ground. The grinding should be neither too fine nor too coarse.  Bran left in, and sifted out as needed, helps to save from musting, and  to preserve the delicate natural flavor. Fresh meal, in clean bright tin  or glass, or in a stout paper sack, where it is dry, cool and airy will  keep two months. Hence buy it judiciously, in proportion to your  family's corn-cake appetite.    It is impossible to give"]]]
