The  capillary vessels, which connect the arteries and veins, are omitted, on  account of their small size. The shading of the \"venous system\" is given  to all the vessels which contain venous blood; that of the \"arterial  system\" to all the vessels which contain arterial blood.    I have here (Fig. 1) a purposely rough, but, so far as it goes,  accurate, diagram of the structure of the heart and the course of the  blood. The heart is supposed to be divided into two portions. It would  be possible, by very careful dissection, to split the heart down the  middle of a partition, or so-called 'septum', which exists in it, and to  divide it into the two portions which you see here represented; in which  case we should have a left heart and a right heart, quite distinct from  one another. You will observe that there is a portion of each heart  which is what is called the ventricle. Now the ancients applied the term  'heart' simply and solely to the ventricles. They did not count the rest  of the heart--what we now speak of as the 'auricles'--as any part of the  heart at all; but when they spoke of the heart they meant the left and  the right ventricles; and they described those great vessels, which we  now call the 'pulmonary veins' and the 'vena cava', as opening directly  into the heart itself.    What Erasistratus made out was that, at the roots of the aorta and  the pulmonary artery (Fig. 1) there were valves, which opened in the  direction indicated by the arrows; and, on the other hand, that at the  junction of what he called the veins with the heart there were other  valves, which also opened again in the direction indicated by the  arrows. This was a very capital discovery, because it proved that if  the heart was full of fluid, and if there were any means of causing that  fluid in the ventricles to move, then the fluid could move only in  one direction; for you will observe that, as soon as the fluid is  compressed, the two valves between the ventricles and the veins will be  shut, and the fluid will be obliged to move into the arteries; and,  if it tries to get back from them into the heart, it is prevented from  doing so by the valves at the origin of the arteries, which we now  call the semilunar valves (half-moon shaped valves); so that it is  impossible, if the fluid move at all, that it should move in any other  way than from the great veins into the arteries. Now that was a very  remarkable and striking discovery.    But it is not given to any man to be altogether right (that is a  reflection which it is very desirable for every man who has had the good  luck to be nearly right once, always to bear in mind); and Erasistratus,  while he made this capital and important discovery, made a very capital  and important error in another direction, although it was a very natural  error. If, in any animal which is recently killed, you open one of those  pulsating trunks which I referred to a short time ago, you will find, as  a general rule, that it either contains no blood at all or next to none;  but that, on the contrary, it is full of air. Very naturally, therefore,  Erasistratus came to the conclusion that this was the normal and natural  state of the arteries, and that they contained air. We are apt to think  this a very gross blunder; but, to anybody who is acquainted with  the facts of the case, it is, at first sight, an exceedingly natural  conclusion. Not only so, but Erasistratus might have very justly  imagined that he had seen his way to the meaning of the connection of  the left side of the heart with the lungs; for we find that what we now  call the pulmonary vein is connected with the lungs, and branches out in  them (Fig. 1). Finding that the greater part of this system of vessels  was filled with air after death, this ancient thinker very shrewdly  concluded that its real business was to receive air from the lungs, and  to distribute that air all through the body, so as to get rid of the  grosser humours and purify the blood. That was a very natural and very  obvious suggestion, and a highly ingenious one, though it happened to be  a great error. You will observe that the only way of correcting it was  to experiment upon living animals, for there is no other way in which  this point could be settled.    Fig.2,--The Course of the Blood according to Galen (A.D. 170).    And hence we are indebted, for the correction of the error of  Erasistratus, to one of the greatest experimenters of ancient or modern  times, Claudius Galenus, who lived in the second century after Christ. I  say it was to this man more than any one else, because he knew that the  only way of solving physiological problems was to examine into the facts  in the living animal. And because Galen was a skilful anatomist, and  a skilful experimenter, he was able to show in what particulars  Erasistratus had erred, and to build up a system of thought upon this  subject which was not improved upon for fully 1,300 years. I have  endeavoured, in Fig. 2, to make clear to you exactly what it was he  tried to establish. You will observe that this diagram is practically  the same as that given in Fig. 1, only simplified. The same facts may  be looked upon by different people from different points of view. Galen  looked upon these facts from a very different point of view from that  which we ourselves occupy; but, so far as the facts are concerned, they  were the same for him as for us. Well then, the first thing that Galen  did was to make out experimentally that, during life, the arteries are  not full of air, but that they are full of blood. And he describes a  great variety of experiments which he made upon living animals with the  view of proving this point, which he did prove effectually and for all  time; and that you will observe was the only way of settling the matter.  Furthermore, he demonstrated that the cavities of the left side of the  heart--what we now call the left auricle and the left ventricle--are,  like the arteries, full of blood during life, and that that blood was of  the scarlet kind--arterialised, or as he called it \"pneumatised,\" blood.  It was known before, that the pulmonary artery, the right ventricle,  and the veins, contain the darker kind of blood, which was thence called  venous. Having proved that the whole of the left side of the heart,  during life, is full of scarlet arterial blood, Galen's next point  was to inquire into the mode of communication between the arteries  and veins. It was known before his time that both arteries and veins  branched out. Galen maintained, though he could not prove the fact, that  the ultimate branches of the arteries and veins communicated together  somehow or other, by what he called 'anastomoses', and that these  'anastomoses' existed not only in the body in general but also in the  lungs. In the next place, Galen maintained that all the veins of  the body arise from the liver; that they draw the blood thence and  distribute it over the body. People laugh at that notion now-a-days; but  if anybody will look at the facts he will see that it is a very probable  supposition. There is a great vein (hepatic vein--Fig. 1) which rises  out of the liver, and that vein goes straight into the 'vena cava' (Fig.  1) which passes to the heart, being there joined by the other veins  of the body. The liver itself is fed by a very large vein (portal  vein--Fig. 1), which comes from the alimentary canal. The way the  ancients looked at this matter was, that the food, after being received  into the alimentary canal, was then taken up by the branches of this  great vein, which are called the 'vena portae', just as the roots of a  plant suck up nourishment from the soil in which it lives; that then it  was carried to the liver, there to be what was called \"concocted,\" which  was their phrase for its conversion into substances more fitted for  nutrition than previously existed in it. They then supposed that the  next thing to be done was to distribute this fluid through the body; and  Galen like his predecessors, imagined that the \"concocted\" blood, having  entered the great 'vena cava', was distributed by its ramifications all  over the body. So that, in his view (Fig. 2), the course of the blood  was from the intestine to the liver, and from the liver into the great  'vena cava', including what we now call the right auricle of the heart,  whence it was distributed by the branches of the veins. But the whole of  the blood was not thus disposed of. Part of the blood, it was supposed,  went through what we now call the pulmonary arteries (Fig. 1), and,  branching out there, gave exit to certain \"fuliginous\" products, and  at the same time took in from the air a something which Galen calls the  'pneuma'. He does not know anything about what we call oxygen; but it  is astonishing how very easy it would be to turn his language into the  equivalent of modern chemical theory. The old philosopher had so just  a suspicion of the real state of affairs that you could make use of his  language in many cases, if you substituted the word \"oxygen,\" which we  now-a-days use, for the word 'pneuma'. Then he imagined that the blood,  further concocted or altered by contact with the 'pneuma', passed to  a certain extent to the left side of the heart. So that Galen believed  that there was such a thing as what is now called the pulmonary  circulation. He believed, as much as we do, that the blood passed  through the right side of the heart, through the artery which goes to  the lungs, through the lungs themselves, and back by what we call the  pulmonary veins to the left side of the heart. But he thought it was  only a very small portion of the blood which passes to the right side of  the heart in this way; the rest of the blood, he thought, passed through  the partition which separates the two ventricles of the heart. He  describes a number of small pits, which really exist there, as"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/29420"],[0,"American Rural Highways (#2)"],[1,"attention commensurate with its importance.    =Development of Traffic.=--The character and extent of the highway  improvement needed in any locality is dependent entirely on the  demands of traffic. In sparsely settled areas, particularly those that  are semi-arid or arid, the amount of traffic on local roads is likely  to be small and the unimproved trails or natural roads adequate. But  as an area develops either on account of agricultural progress or the  establishment of industrial enterprises, the use of the public  highways both for business and for pleasure increases and the old  trails are gradually improved to meet, at least to some degree, the  new demands of traffic. In sparsely settled areas, it is possible for  the public to accommodate its use of the highways to the physical  condition thereof, and business is more or less regulated according to  the condition of the roads. This is not always pleasant or economical  but is the only possible arrangement. In populous districts, with  diversified activities, it becomes imperative to have year-round  usable roads in order to transact with reasonable dispatch the regular  business of the industries. Anything less will handicap normal  community progress.    The advent of the motor driven vehicle in the United States has  resulted in a greatly increased use of the public highways of  agricultural areas, even of those that are sparsely populated, because  of the convenience of the motor vehicle both for passenger and for  freight service. Probably in excess of 90 per cent of the tonnage  passing over the rural highways in the United States is carried by  motor vehicles. This class of traffic has really just developed and no  one can predict what it will be in ten years, yet it has already  introduced into the highway problem an element that has revolutionized  methods of construction and maintenance.    A different set of traffic conditions exists in those parts of the  United States where large areas are devoted primarily to industrial  pursuits, the agricultural development being of secondary importance.  Public highways connecting the industrial centers are indispensable  adjuncts to the business facilities in such communities and are  ordinarily subjected to a very large volume and tonnage of traffic  consisting principally of motor vehicles. The roads first selected for  improvement will not be those serving the agricultural interests of  the district, but rather those serving the industrial centers.  Inter-city roads of great durability and relatively high cost are  necessary for such traffic conditions.    Not infrequently the transportation needs will require a system of  both inter-city and rural highways in the same community. There are  few areas in the United States where there is no agricultural  development. It is apparent therefore that the nature of the highway  systems and the administrative organization under which they are built  and maintained will differ in various states or areas according to  the nature of development of that area agriculturally and  industrially. In planning improvements of highway systems, it is  recognized that one or more of several groups of traffic may be  encountered and that the extent and nature of the improvement must be  such as will meet the requirements of all classes of traffic, the most  important being first provided for, and that of lesser importance as  rapidly as finances permit.      KINDS OF TRAFFIC ON PUBLIC HIGHWAYS    =Local or Farm to Market Traffic.=--In strictly agricultural  communities the principal use of the highways will pertain to  agricultural activities and most of it will be between the farm and  the most convenient market center. In the ordinary state, the number  of rural families will not average more than six to eight per square  mile, but in some districts it may reach twenty families per square  mile. The travel from the district around a market center will  originate in this rather sparsely populated area and converge onto a  few main roads leading to market. The outlying or feeder roads will be  used by only a few families, but the density of traffic will increase  nearer the market centers and consequently the roads nearer town will  be much more heavily traveled than the outlying ones. It is apparent  therefore that considerable difference may exist in the kind of  construction adequate for the various sections of road where farm  traffic is the principal consideration. This traffic is made up of  horse drawn wagons, transporting farm products and of horse drawn and  motor passenger vehicles, the motor traffic comprising 80 per cent or  more of the volume of traffic and a greater per cent of the tonnage.  Motor trucks are now employed to some extent for marketing farm  products and, where surfaced highways have been provided, this class  of traffic is superseding horse drawn traffic.    =Farm to Farm Traffic.=--In the ordinary prosecution of farming  operations, a considerable amount of neighborhood travel is  inevitable. Farmers help each other with certain kinds of work,  exchange commodities such as seed, machinery and farm animals and  visit back and forth both for business and pleasure. To accommodate  this traffic, it is desirable to provide good neighborhood roads.  Traffic of this sort follows no particular route and can to some  extent accommodate itself to the condition of the highways without  entailing financial loss, although some discomfort and some  inconvenience may result from inadequate highway facilities. This  traffic will be partly motor and partly horse drawn, but the  proportion of motor driven is large.    =Inter-city Traffic.=--In strictly agricultural districts there is a  large amount of travel between towns, both for business and for  pleasure. The pleasure travel is mostly in motor vehicles and a  considerable part of the business traffic is the same, although horse  drawn vehicles are employed to some extent.    In industrial districts there is a large volume of this class of  traffic consisting of motor passenger vehicles used for business and  for pleasure and of motor freight vehicles used for general business  purposes. In addition, there is certain to be a large amount of motor  truck freight traffic incident to the particular industrial pursuits  of the cities. Where adequate public highways connect industrial  centers, there is invariably a very large amount of inter-city  traffic, due in part to the needs of industry and in part to  concentration of population in industrial centers.    =Inter-County and Inter-State Traffic.=--Automobile touring is a  popular means of relaxation, especially on the part of those who live  in the cities, although it is by no means confined to them. Traffic of  this kind follows the routes where roads are best and passes entirely  across a county, attracted by some public gathering. Often it is  inter-state in character, made up of tourists who are traveling to  distant pleasure resorts. Such traffic at present constitutes a  relatively small part of the travel on public highways, except on  certain favorable routes, but as the wealth of the country increases  and good touring roads are numerous, long distance travel will  increase and will eventually necessitate the construction of a number  of well maintained national highways, located with reference to the  convenience of the automobile tourist.      PUBLIC HIGHWAYS AND COMMUNITY LIFE    It is well to recognize the intimate relation public highways bear to  the economic progress of a nation. Normal development of all of the  diverse activities of a people depends very largely upon the highway  policy that is adopted and whether the actual construction of  serviceable roads keeps pace with transportation needs.    =Rural Education.=--It has become increasingly apparent during the  World War that the demand upon North America for food stuffs is to  become more and more insistent as the years pass. Already the  consumption in the United States has approached quite closely to the  average production and yet the population is constantly increasing.  The time is not far distant when greater production will be required  of the agricultural area in North America in order to meet the home  demand for foodstuffs, and many thousands of tons will be needed for  export. This need can only be met by agricultural methods that will  increase greatly the present yield of the soil. The adoption of better  agricultural methods must of necessity be preceded by the technical  training of the school children who will be the farmers of the next  generation, which can best be accomplished in graded schools with well  equipped laboratories and with suitably trained teachers. The problem  of providing such schools in rural communities has, in some instances,  been solved by consolidating a number of rural school districts and  constructing a well equipped building to accommodate the students from  an area several miles square. An educational system of this sort can  reach its highest usefulness only when adequate public highways  facilitate attendance of pupils. The whole trend of rural educational  progress is toward a system which is predicated upon a comprehensive  highway policy in the district.    =Rural Social Life.=--Closely allied to the rural educational problem  is the rural social problem. Motor cars and good roads do a great deal  to eliminate the isolation and lack of social opportunity that has  characterized rural life in the United States. A high order of  citizenship in rural communities is essential to the solution of many  problems of rural economics, and such citizens will not live away from  the social opportunities of modern life. The rural school house and  the rural church may become social centers and local plays, moving  picture shows and lectures and entertainments of other kinds made  available to those who live in the country.
