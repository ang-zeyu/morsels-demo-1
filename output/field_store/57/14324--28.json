He had but just come home, and it was never his custom to dash off in  such an abrupt fashion. It was easy to see that he was annoyed about the  school report. That was not strange--of course he would be. Peter was  himself. But at least Mr. Coddington had not lost his place as pitcher  of a ball team, and since he hadn't there seemed to be no reason why he  should be so cut up. Then an inspiration came to the boy. Perhaps his  father had gone to demand that Mr. Christopher take his son back on the  nine. Ah, that must be it! His father was much interested in athletics  Peter knew, and when in college had pulled the winning shell to a  spectacular victory for his Alma Mater. His father would never stand by  and see the star pitcher of the Milburn High School swept off the team  just because of a few failures in Latin, algebra, and other such  rubbish.    Peter drew a sigh of relief.    Yes, his fortunate star would rise again; he was confident of it. All  would yet be well. He would tutor up for the examinations, pass them  gloriously, and win back his place on the team. None of the fellows need  be the wiser. His father would fix it up--nay, he probably was fixing it  up at this very moment.    Until dusk Peter waited anxiously for the sound of the motor's return.    It was nearly seven when over the gravel rolled the heavy rubber-tired  wheels that announced Mr. Coddington's arrival. The boy sat in precisely  the spot where his father had left him and after alighting from the car  the elder man made his way toward the motionless figure sitting so still  in the June twilight.    \"I have been to see Mr. Christopher,\" began Mr. Coddington when he came  within speaking distance, \"and have made all the arrangements for your  future career.\"    Eagerly Peter looked up.    \"I'm going back on the team?\" he cried joyously.    \"You are going to work!\" was the sharp retort.    \"What!\"    \"I have been very busy during the last two hours,\" continued Mr.  Coddington. \"I have got for you the first, last, and only job I shall  ever get. It is up to you now.\"    \"But I don't understand,\" protested Peter, aghast.    \"Why not? It is not a difficult thing to comprehend. You have fooled  away your days and my money long enough. Life is a serious business--not  a game. It is time you took it in earnest. To-morrow morning at eight  o'clock you are going to work, and you must make good at the position  I've found for you, or you will lose your place. If you do I shall not  lift a finger to help you to find another.\"    A great lump rose in Peter's throat but he managed to choke it back.    \"Where am I going?\" he gasped when he was able to speak.    \"To the tannery,\" was the laconic reply.    If the clouds had fallen or the earth opened Peter could not have been  more astounded.    The tannery!    Of course he knew his father owned the vast tanneries to the west of the  town, for that was the reason the Coddingtons lived at Milburn instead  of migrating to the near-by city, as had so many of their prosperous  neighbors; but beyond the fact that it was the tanneries which  indirectly provided him with tennis racquets, skates, bicycles,  motor-cars, and spending money Peter knew nothing about them. They were  red brick buildings covering a wide area, and from their doors at noon  and night hundreds of workmen with lunch-boxes and newspaper bundles  poured out into the streets. Peter never spoke of the tanneries. Even  when, on the highway, he encountered the heavy carts laden with hides  and marked \"H. M. Coddington, Leather,\" he always looked the other way  and hurried past as fast as he could. Occasionally in hot weather when  the wind was in a certain quarter and brought a faint odor from the  beamhouses into the fashionable part of the town where Peter lived  their neighbors complained, and the boy always felt with a vague sense  of mortification that everybody blamed him and his family for the  annoyance. Sometimes this breath of damp, steamy leather even forced  itself in at the windows of the Coddington library and mingled  shamelessly with the rich hangings and paintings that furnished it.  Peter always resented the intrusion. How dare it follow them there!    Mr. Coddington, on the other hand, although not reveling in the  unpleasant tannery smells, had a sincere respect for the industry which  furnished him his living, not only because it enabled him to provide his  family with a luxurious home, but also because he regarded it as a  life-work that was well worth the doing. Was he not giving to the world  a necessity which it could not do without? It was a self-respecting  trade. Therefore why should he not feel there was dignity in the long  buildings with their whirring wheels, their hundreds of busy workmen,  and their ponderous green trucks which, loaded with skins, ever rumbled  back and forth through the main street? His pride was the more  justifiable since alone, and aided only by his brain and his  perseverance, he himself had built up this mighty industry which had  become the chief support of the flourishing little New England town.  Milburn, in fact, had grown up around the business that he had founded.  From the lowest rung of the ladder he had worked his way up to the  highest. The climb had been no easy one. On the contrary it had been  hard work. How could he help but feel a pride--nay, an affection, even,  for the great throbbing world of labor which he had created, and which  furnished thousands of people with homes, food and clothing!    Since this was his point of view it naturally was impossible for him to  appreciate the horror that his words brought to the boy who sat on the  steps beside him. Peter knew his father too well to offer protest at the  judgment that his own misdeeds had brought. It was a perfectly fair  retribution. Moreover, he had been warned--Peter clearly recalled the  fact now. But he had rushed blindly on, not heeding the warning.    \"The tannery?\" he at last repeated aloud.    \"Yes. That is where I began, Peter, and it won't hurt you to do the  same.\"    \"Shan't I go back to school at all?\"    \"Not for the present.\"    \"And the school team----\"    \"It must get on without you as best it may.\"    Peter fought to keep back the tears.    \"Will everybody know?\" he faltered after a pause.    \"No. I simply told Mr. Christopher that I had decided to take you out of  school. He knows nothing more, nor does any one else. Now, Peter, I do  not wish you to take this as a punishment.\" Stooping, Mr. Coddington  put his hand kindly on the lad's shoulder. \"In so far as it is the  consequence of misspent, wasted time it is, to be sure, a punishment;  none of us can escape the direct results of our own actions. In another  sense, however, it is merely a fresh opportunity--a chance to substitute  success for failure, to make good at a different kind of work. It is in  this light that you must try and regard it, son. I want to make a man of  you if I can. I must make a man of you. You are the only child I have,  and if I stand by and allow you to make a fizzle of your life I shall be  quite as much to blame as you. Remember that unhappy as you are this  affair is costing me something, too.\"    There was a break in Mr. Coddington's voice.    As the boy raised his head and looked into the face bending over him he  read in it an expression quite new--a softness and sympathy that he had  never before caught in the gray eyes which, but a moment previous, had  regarded him so sternly.    As a result when Peter answered much of the bitterness had crept out of  his tone.    \"I suppose all the men at the factory will have to know who I am,\" he  reflected.    \"I'm afraid so. I see no way that that can be avoided,\" assented his  father.    \"I hate to have them. They will all be grinning over the knowledge that  I was put into the factories because I flunked at school. Isn't there  any way to prevent their knowing? Couldn't I take another name when I go  into the tannery and let them think I am somebody else?\"    Mr. Coddington mused a few seconds before answering.    \"Why, yes,\" he replied meditatively, \"I suppose it could be done. Nobody  knows you at the works, so there would be no danger of your being  recognized. My plan to send you there I have kept to myself. You could  easily enter under some other name if you chose. You must consider,  however, that if you decide to go in simply as an ordinary boy I shall  not be able to help you much; nor can you expect to be favored in any  way by the men. You would have to stand on your own feet and take your  own chances.\" Again Mr. Coddington ruminated. \"That might not be a bad  idea, either,\" he observed, half aloud.    \"Oh, I would so much rather take another name, Father,\" pleaded Peter.    But Mr. Coddington did not heed the interruption; he was still thinking.    \"I do not mean to stand behind you after you are in the tannery,  anyway,\" he went on. \"In every department there is a foreman to whom you  will be accountable--not to me. Nor must you come running home and here  report every real or fancied injustice. So far as business goes I am the  president of the company and you are simply a boy in my employ. Out of  working hours we will be father and son and will enjoy our drives,  walks, and reading together just as we have in the past. One rule,  however, must be strictly adhered to--we will not talk shop.\"    \"I understand, sir,\" nodded Peter.    \"Now just a last word,\" concluded Mr. Coddington. \"To-morrow morning you  must be prompt at the works. Eight o'clock is the hour you are to  present yourself and that does not mean before eight or after eight; it  means on the stroke of eight. You will carry a luncheon which your  mother will see is put up for you.

De Quiros coasted along the islands  for a day or two till he entered a fine bay, where his vessels anchored,  and Torres went ashore. A chief came down to meet him, offering him a  present of fruit, and making signs to show that he did not wish the  Spaniards to intrude upon his land. As Torres paid no attention, the  chief drew a line upon the sand, and defied the Spaniards to cross it.  Torres immediately stepped over it, and the natives launched some arrows  at him, which dropped harmlessly from his iron armour. Then the  Spaniards fired their muskets, killing the chief and a number of the  naked savages. The rest stood for a moment, stupefied at the noise and  flash; then turned and ran for the mountains.    The Spaniards spent a few pleasant days among the fruit plantations,  and slept in cool groves of overarching foliage; but subsequently they  had quarrels and combats with the natives, of whom they killed a  considerable number. When the Spaniards had taken on board a sufficient  supply of wood and of fresh water they set sail, but had scarcely got  out to sea when a fever spread among the crew, and became a perfect  plague. They returned and anchored in the bay, where the vessels lay  like so many hospitals. No one died, and after a few days they again put  to sea, this time to be driven back again by bad weather. Torres, with  two ships, safely reached the sheltering bay, but the vessel in which De  Quiros sailed was unable to enter it, and had to stand out to sea and  weather the storm. The sailors then refused to proceed further with the  voyage, and, having risen in mutiny, compelled De Quiros to turn the  vessel's head for Mexico, which they reached after some terrible months  of hunger and thirst.      #3. Torres.#--The other ships waited for a day or two, but no signs being  seen of their consort, they proceeded in search of it. In this voyage  Torres sailed round the land, thus showing that it was no continent, but  only an island. Having satisfied himself that it was useless to seek for  De Quiros, he turned to the west, hoping to reach the Philippine  Islands, where the Spaniards had a colony, at Manila. It was his  singular fortune to sail through that opening which lies between New  Guinea and Australia, to which the name of \"Torres Strait\" was long  afterwards applied. He probably saw Cape York rising out of the sea to  the south, but thought it only another of those endless little islands  with which the strait is studded. Poor De Quiros spent the rest of his  life in petitioning the King of Spain for ships to make a fresh attempt.  After many years he obtained another order to the Governor of Peru, and  the old weather-beaten mariner once more set out from Spain full of  hope; but at Panama, on his way, death awaited him, and there the  fiery-souled veteran passed away, the last of the great Spanish  navigators. He died in poverty and disappointment, but he is to be  honoured as the first of the long line of Australian discoverers. In  after years, the name he had invented was divided into two parts; the  island he had really discovered being called Espiritu Santo, while the  continent he thought he had discovered was called Terra Australis. This  last name was shortened by another discoverer--Flinders--to the present  term Australia.      #4. The Duyfhen.#--De Quiros and Torres were Spaniards, but the Dutch also  displayed much anxiety to reach the great South Continent. From their  colony at Java they sent out a small vessel, the _Duyfhen_, or _Dove_,  which sailed into the Gulf of Carpentaria, and passed half-way down  along its eastern side. Some sailors landed, but so many of them were  killed by the natives that the captain was glad to embark again and sail  for home, after calling the place of their disaster Cape Keer-weer, or  Turnagain. These Dutch sailors were the first Europeans, as far as can  now be known, who landed on Australian soil; but as they never published  any account of their voyage, it is only by the merest chance that we  know anything of it.      #5. Other Dutch Discoverers.#--During the next twenty years various Dutch  vessels, while sailing to the settlements in the East Indies, met with  the coast of Australia. In 1616 Dirk Hartog landed on the island in  Shark Bay which is now called after him. Two years later Captain Zaachen  is said to have sailed along the north coast, which he called Arnhem  Land. Next year (1619) another captain, called Edel, surveyed the  western shores, which for a long time bore his name. In 1622 a Dutch  ship, the _Leeuwin_, or _Lioness_, sailed along the southern coast, and  its name was given to the south-west cape of Australia. In 1627 Peter  Nuyts entered the Great Australian Bight, and made a rough chart of  some of its shores; in 1628 General Carpenter sailed completely round  the large gulf to the north, which has taken its name from this  circumstance. Thus, by degrees, all the northern and western, together  with part of the southern shores, came to be roughly explored, and the  Dutch even had some idea of colonising this continent.      #6. Tasman.#--During the next fourteen years we hear no more of voyages  to Australia; but in 1642 Antony Van Diemen, the Governor of the Dutch  possessions in the East Indies, sent out his friend Abel Jansen Tasman,  with two ships, to make new discoveries in the South Seas. Tasman first  went to the Island of Bourbon, from which he sailed due south for a  time; but finding no signs of land, he turned to the east, and three  months after setting out he saw a rocky shore in the distance. Stormy  weather coming on, he was driven out to sea, and it was not till a week  later that he was able to reach the coast again. He called the place Van  Diemen's Land, and sent some sailors on shore to examine the country.  These men heard strange noises in the woods, and saw trees of enormous  height, in which notches were cut seven feet apart. These they believed  to be the steps used by the natives in climbing the trees, and they  therefore returned to report that the land was exceedingly beautiful,  but inhabited by men of gigantic size. Tasman, next day, allowed the  carpenter to swim ashore and set up the Dutch flag; but having himself  seen, from his ship, what he thought to be men of extraordinary stature  moving about on the shore, he lost no time in taking up his anchor and  setting sail. Farther to the east he discovered the islands of New  Zealand, and after having made a partial survey of their coasts, he  returned to Batavia. Two years after he was sent on a second voyage of  discovery, and explored the northern and western shores of Australia  itself; but the results do not seem to have been important, and are not  now known. His chief service in the exploration of Australia was the  discovery of Tasmania, as it is now called, after his name. This he did  not know to be an island; he drew it on his maps as if it were a  peninsula belonging to the mainland of Australia.      #7. Dampier.#--The discoveries that had so far been made were very  imperfect, for the sailors generally contented themselves with looking  at the land from a safe distance. They made no surveys such as would  have enabled them to draw correct charts of the coasts; they seldom  landed, and even when they did, they never sought to become acquainted  with the natives, or to learn anything as to the nature of the interior  of the country. The first who took the trouble to obtain information of  this more accurate kind was the Englishman, William Dampier.    [Illustration: WILLIAM DAMPIER.]    When a young man Dampier had gone out to Jamaica to manage a large  estate; but not liking the slave-driving business, he crossed over to  Campeachy, and lived for a time in the woods, cutting the more valuable  kinds of timber. Here he became acquainted with the buccaneers who made  the lonely coves of Campeachy their headquarters. Being persuaded to  join them, he entered upon a life of lawless daring, constantly fighting  and plundering, and meeting with the wildest adventures. He was often  captured by the American natives, still more often by the Spaniards, but  always escaped to enter upon exploits of fresh danger. In 1688 he joined  a company of buccaneers, who proposed to make a voyage round the world  and plunder on their way. It took them more than a year to reach the  East Indies, where they spent a long time, sometimes attacking Spanish  ships or Dutch fortresses, sometimes leading an easy luxurious life  among the natives, often quarrelling among themselves, and even going so  far as to leave their captain with forty men on the island of Mindanao.  But at length the time came when it was necessary to seek some quiet  spot where they should be able to clean and repair the bottoms of their  ships. Accordingly, they landed on the north-west coast of Australia,  and lived for twelve days at the place now called \"Buccaneers'  Archipelago\". They were the first Europeans who held any communication  with the natives of Australia, and the first to publish a detailed  account of their voyage thither. Growing tired of a lawless life, and  having become wealthy, Dampier bought an estate in England, where he  lived some years in retirement, till his love of adventure led him forth  again. The King of England was anxious to encourage discovery, and  fitted out a vessel called the _Roebuck_, to explore the southern seas.  Dampier was the only man in England who had ever been to Australia, and  to him was given the command of the little vessel, which sailed in the  year 1699. It took a long time to reach Australia, but at last the  _Roebuck_ entered what Dampier called Shark Bay, from an enormous shark  he caught there. He then explored the north-west coast as far as Roebuck  Bay, in all about nine hundred miles; of which he published a full and  fairly accurate account. "]]]
