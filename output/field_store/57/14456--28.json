Then  presently the old man went aland; the gangway was unshipped, the hawsers  cast off; the oars of the towing-boats splashed in the dark water, the  sail fell down from the yard, and was sheeted home, and out plunged the  Katherine into the misty sea and rolled up the grey slopes, casting  abroad her ancient withal, whereon was beaten the token of Bartholomew  Golden, to wit a B and a G to the right and the left, and thereabove a  cross and a triangle rising from the midst.    Walter stood on the stern and beheld, yet more with the mind of him than  with his eyes; for it all seemed but the double of what the other ship  had done; and the thought of it as if the twain were as beads strung on  one string and led away by it into the same place, and thence to go in  the like order, and so on again and again, and never to draw nigher to  each other.          CHAPTER III: WALTER HEARETH TIDINGS OF THE DEATH OF HIS FATHER      Fast sailed the Katherine over the seas, and nought befell to tell of,  either to herself or her crew.  She came to one cheaping-town and then to  another, and so on to a third and a fourth; and at each was buying and  selling after the manner of chapmen; and Walter not only looked on the  doings of his father's folk, but lent a hand, what he might, to help them  in all matters, whether it were in seaman's craft, or in chaffer.  And  the further he went and the longer the time wore, the more he was eased  of his old trouble wherein his wife and her treason had to do.    But as for the other trouble, to wit his desire and longing to come up  with those three, it yet flickered before him; and though he had not seen  them again as one sees people in the streets, and as if he might touch  them if he would, yet were their images often before his mind's eye; and  yet, as time wore, not so often, nor so troublously; and forsooth both to  those about him and to himself, he seemed as a man well healed of his  melancholy mood.    Now they left that fourth stead, and sailed over the seas and came to a  fifth, a very great and fair city, which they had made more than seven  months from Langton on Holm; and by this time was Walter taking heed and  joyance in such things as were toward in that fair city, so far from his  kindred, and especially he looked on the fair women there, and desired  them, and loved them; but lightly, as befalleth young men.    Now this was the last country whereto the Katherine was boun; so there  they abode some ten months in daily chaffer, and in pleasuring them in  beholding all that there was of rare and goodly, and making merry with  the merchants and the towns-folk, and the country-folk beyond the gates,  and Walter was grown as busy and gay as a strong young man is like to be,  and was as one who would fain be of some account amongst his own folk.    But at the end of this while, it befell on a day, as he was leaving his  hostel for his booth in the market, and had the door in his hand, there  stood before him three mariners in the guise of his own country, and with  them was one of clerkly aspect, whom he knew at once for his father's  scrivener, Arnold Penstrong by name; and when Walter saw him his heart  failed him and he cried out: \"Arnold, what tidings?  Is all well with the  folk at Langton?\"    Said Arnold: \"Evil tidings are come with me; matters are ill with thy  folk; for I may not hide that thy father, Bartholomew Golden, is dead,  God rest his soul.\"    At that word it was to Walter as if all that trouble which but now had  sat so light upon him, was once again fresh and heavy, and that his past  life of the last few months had never been; and it was to him as if he  saw his father lying dead on his bed, and heard the folk lamenting about  the house.  He held his peace awhile, and then he said in a voice as of  an angry man:    \"What, Arnold! and did he die in his bed, or how? for he was neither old  nor ailing when we parted.\"    Said Arnold: \"Yea, in his bed he died: but first he was somewhat sword-  bitten.\"    \"Yea, and how?\" quoth Walter.    Said Arnold: \"When thou wert gone, in a few days' wearing, thy father  sent thy wife out of his house back to her kindred of the Reddings with  no honour, and yet with no such shame as might have been, without blame  to us of those who knew the tale of thee and her; which, God-a-mercy,  will be pretty much the whole of the city.\"    \"Nevertheless, the Reddings took it amiss, and would have a mote with us  Goldings to talk of booting.  By ill-luck we yea-said that for the saving  of the city's peace.  But what betid?  We met in our Gild-hall, and there  befell the talk between us; and in that talk certain words could not be  hidden, though they were none too seemly nor too meek.  And the said  words once spoken drew forth the whetted steel; and there then was the  hewing and thrusting!  Two of ours were slain outright on the floor, and  four of theirs, and many were hurt on either side.  Of these was thy  father, for as thou mayst well deem, he was nought backward in the fray;  but despite his hurts, two in the side and one on the arm, he went home  on his own feet, and we deemed that we had come to our above.  But well-a-  way! it was an evil victory, whereas in ten days he died of his hurts.  God have his soul!  But now, my master, thou mayst well wot that I am not  come to tell thee this only, but moreover to bear the word of the  kindred, to wit that thou come back with me straightway in the swift  cutter which hath borne me and the tidings; and thou mayst look to it,  that though she be swift and light, she is a keel full weatherly.\"    Then said Walter: \"This is a bidding of war.  Come back will I, and the  Reddings shall wot of my coming.  Are ye all-boun?\"    \"Yea,\" said Arnold, \"we may up anchor this very day, or to-morrow morn at  latest.  But what aileth thee, master, that thou starest so wild over my  shoulder?  I pray thee take it not so much to heart!  Ever it is the wont  of fathers to depart this world before their sons.\"    But Walter's visage from wrathful red had become pale, and he pointed up  street, and cried out: \"Look! dost thou see?\"    \"See what, master?\" quoth Arnold: \"what! here cometh an ape in gay  raiment; belike the beast of some jongleur.  Nay, by God's wounds! 'tis a  man, though he be exceeding mis-shapen like a very devil.  Yea and now  there cometh a pretty maid going as if she were of his meney; and lo!  here, a most goodly and noble lady!  Yea, I see; and doubtless she owneth  both the two, and is of the greatest of the folk of this fair city; for  on the maiden's ankle I saw an iron ring, which betokeneth thralldom  amongst these aliens.  But this is strange! for notest thou not how the  folk in the street heed not this quaint show; nay not even the stately  lady, though she be as lovely as a goddess of the gentiles, and beareth  on her gems that would buy Langton twice over; surely they must be over-  wont to strange and gallant sights.  But now, master, but now!\"    \"Yea, what is it?\" said Walter.    \"Why, master, they should not yet be gone out of eye-shot, yet gone they  are.  What is become of them, are they sunk into the earth?\"    \"Tush, man!\" said Walter, looking not on Arnold, but still staring down  the street; \"they have gone into some house while thine eyes were turned  from them a moment.\"    \"Nay, master, nay,\" said Arnold, \"mine eyes were not off them one instant  of time.\"    \"Well,\" said Walter, somewhat snappishly, \"they are gone now, and what  have we to do to heed such toys, we with all this grief and strife on our  hands?  Now would I be alone to turn the matter of thine errand over in  my mind.  Meantime do thou tell the shipmaster Geoffrey and our other  folk of these tidings, and thereafter get thee all ready; and come hither  to me before sunrise to-morrow, and I shall be ready for my part; and so  sail we back to Langton.\"    Therewith he turned him back into the house, and the others went their  ways; but Walter sat alone in his chamber a long while, and pondered  these things in his mind.  And whiles he made up his mind that he would  think no more of the vision of those three, but would fare back to  Langton, and enter into the strife with the Reddings and quell them, or  die else.  But lo, when he was quite steady in this doom, and his heart  was lightened thereby, he found that he thought no more of the Reddings  and their strife, but as matters that were passed and done with, and that  now he was thinking and devising if by any means he might find out in  what land dwelt those three.  And then again he strove to put that from  him, saying that what he had seen was but meet for one brainsick, and a  dreamer of dreams.  But furthermore he thought, Yea, and was Arnold, who  this last time had seen the images of those three, a dreamer of waking  dreams? for he was nought wonted in such wise; then thought he: At least  I am well content that he spake to me of their likeness, not I to him;  for so I may tell that there was at least something before my eyes which  grew not out of mine own brain.  And yet again, why should I follow them;  and what should I get by it; and indeed how shall I set about it?    Thus he turned the matter over and over; and at last, seeing that if he  grew no foolisher over it, he grew no wiser, he became weary thereof, and  bestirred him, and saw to the trussing up of his goods, and made all  ready for his departure, and so wore the day and slept at nightfall; and  at daybreak comes Arnold to lead him to their keel, which hight the  Bartholomew.  He tarried nought, and with few farewells went aboard ship,  and an hour after they were in the open sea with the ship's head turned  toward Langton on Holm.

Here then  was an opportunity which the man had felt that he could not afford  to miss.    He had been very much concerned about other matters and other  troubles at the time, but when the actual morning of Tara's  departure had arrived, he had begun to feel very bad about it. The  household gathered round to bid good-bye to the beautiful hound,  and her Master himself took her to the station. When Tara was in  the guard's van she looked out through a barred window at her  friend on the station platform, and he said afterwards that the  situation exhausted every ounce of self-control he possessed. He  had an overpowering impulse, even when the train was moving, to  jump aboard and release old Tara.    \"I would sooner face the Bankruptcy Court than have her mournful  old eyes turned upon me again with just that wonderingly  reproachful look,\" he said.    But glowing reports were received of Tara's happiness in her new  home, with its extensive grounds and generous management; and,  though Tara was never forgotten--one does not forget such a mother  of heroes, when one has bred her and nursed her through mortal  illness--her Master had ceased to grieve about her or to feel  self-reproachful about having parted with her.    Arrived in the great show building, he wandered up and down between  the benches, pausing now and again to speak to an old acquaintance,  human or canine, as the case might be. But this was the last day of  the show, and the majority of the exhibitors were away. The place  had a half-dismantled air about it. The Show was virtually over.  Presently the Master found himself in a kind of outbuilding, where  an auction sale of dogs was being held. There he sat down on a  chair at the edge of the ring in which the dogs for sale were being  led to and fro by attendants for inspection.    After a while a young Irish Wolfhound was led into the ring for  sale, and immediately monopolized the Master's attention, for it  was a dog of his own breeding, sold by him from the country home,  Croft, soon after weaning time. He handled the dog with a deal of  interest, and was expatiating upon its merits to a small group of  possible buyers when he felt another dog nuzzling his arm and wrist  from behind, where it was evidently held by a chain, or in some  other way prevented from coming farther forward, for its muzzle was  pressing hard under his cuff. But the Master was too much  interested in examining the young hound then being offered for sale  to pay any attention to any other animal. In due course, however,  the young Wolfhound was sold and led away, and the auctioneer was  heard to say--    \"And now, ladies and gentlemen, we come to lot number a hundred and  twenty-seven, lot one-two-seven, the--er--the--er--er--yes, ladies  and gentlemen, the dam of the fine young hound just sold--a  remarkable good bargain, too--to my friend Mr. Scarr-Hislop. This  magnificent bitch, whose show record I will read to you directly,  is, most of you are probably aware, by the famous Champion O'Leary,  ex--er--Come, come, man; let's have that bitch in the ring, please.  No one can see her there.\"    The auctioneer spoke sharply to an attendant who stood close to the  Master's seat tugging at a chain. The Master, who had been busy  in conversation up till that moment, turned now to respond to the  pressingly affectionate advances of the unseen animal, whose cold  muzzle he had felt at his wrist for some minutes past.    \"Just push her out for me, sir, if you please,\" said the rebuked  attendant, sulkily. \"I can't get her to budge from your chair. The  brute's as strong as a mule.\"    \"Let me have the chain a minute,\" said the Master, as he rose from  his chair. \"I expect you've frightened the---- Why--Great Caesar!  Why--Tara! Tara--dear--old--lady. Who the devil put this hound in  here?\"    \"Mrs. Forsyth, the owner, put her in; she's for sale, without  reserve,\" said a groom, who forced his way forward through the  crowd at this moment.    The Master wasted some moments, but not many, in wondering,  disgusted expostulation, while fondling the head of poor Tara, who  had stood erect with her fore-paws on his shoulders the instant he  recognized her, her noble face all alight with gladness and love.  Through ten acutely unhappy minutes she had nuzzled her friend's  hand, and gained never a hint of recognition or response. Then the  Master walked up to the auctioneer's rostrum, followed by Tara,  who, with no apparent effort, dragged the sulky, puzzled attendant  after him, paying not the slightest heed to his angry jerks at her  collar.    \"I'm sorry,\" said the auctioneer, after a few moments'  conversation; \"but I cannot possibly postpone the sale, can I? I  had my instructions direct from the owner, and she should know. I  am told the dog is positively to be sold, and---- No, there is no  reserve at all. Yes, certainly, I will take your cheque as deposit,  if you will get it endorsed by the Show Secretary. But---- Very  well, sir; no need to blame me about it. I'll give you five  minutes. Bring in lot 128, Johnson.\"    Five minutes was not much of a respite, but the Master meant to  make the most of it. See old Tara put up and sold to a dealer in  the ring, he felt he could not. The bare idea of her being held  there in the auction-room by a show attendant--Tara, the queen of  Wolfhound mothers, the daughter of innumerable generations of  Wolfhound queens, the noblest living dam of her noble race--was  maddening to the man who had bred and reared her, seen her through  her puppy's ills, and bred from her the most famous hounds of the  day. The groom said Mrs. Forsyth was in the tea-room, and there the  Master sought her, with anger and anxiety in his eye; sought her  unavailingly and in a frenzy of haste. To and fro he hurried  through the huge, noisy show building. At one moment of his  fruitless search he obtained a card from the Show Secretary stating  that his cheque might be accepted; but even as he thanked the  worried official for his confidence in an old exhibitor, he  realized with bitterness that he could not by any stretch of fancy  pretend that he was able to afford anything like the sort of price  that Tara would bring. Not a sign did he see of Mrs. Forsyth, and  at last a Kennel-man, whom he remembered tipping years before for  some slight service, informed him that he had seen Mrs. Forsyth  leaving the building some time before. Almost despairing now, and  conscious that the limit of time given him was passed, he hurried  back to the auction-room, caught a glimpse of his beautiful Tara  standing sorrowful and stately in the ring, head and tail both  carried low, and heard a tall, clean-shaven man in a kennel-coat  bid forty-eight guineas for her.    \"Forty-eight!\" echoed the auctioneer. \"This magnificent Irish  Wolfhound bitch, the dam of many winners and two champions, is  positively going for forty---- Why, gentlemen, she'd be worth that  to the Natural History Museum!\"    \"Forty-nine!\" cried the Master, with a tightening of his lips.    And then he saw the mean, ferrety face of a well-known low-class  dealer thrust forward from among the crowd. This dealer was  notorious for keeping a large number of big Danes and Newfoundlands  in the miserable backyard of a cobbler's shop in the East End of  London. He had been ordered out of show rings before that day for  malpractices. He had never owned a Wolfhound, but he was a shrewd  business judge of the values of dogs. He nodded to the auctioneer,  and that gentleman nodded responsively before taking up his tale  afresh.    \"Fifty guineas only is offered for the celebrated Irish Wolfhound  Tara, by the famous Champion O'Leary. Fifty guineas only is  offered, and the time is running merrily on, gentlemen, all the  time. Fifty guineas only is offered--and one. Fifty-one  guineas--Thank you, sir. Fifty and one guineas is my last bid for----\"    The auctioneer babbled serenely on, and the Master followed his  words, rather pale in the face now, for fifty-one guineas was a  great deal more than he could afford to pay at this time, for such  a purpose.    The ferret-faced dealer raised the price to fifty-three guineas,  and the Master bit his lip and made it fifty-four.    \"May I say fifty-five for you, sir?\" said the auctioneer to the  clean-shaven man in the kennel-coat.    \"If you'll just wait one moment, sir; I must just ask my----\" The  clean-shaven man was edging his way towards the back of the crowd,  where several ladies and gentlemen were seated at a table just out  of sight of the ring.    \"Time and tide and auctioneers wait for no man, sir,\" continued the  auctioneer. \"The hammer is very near to falling, gentlemen. The  magnificent St. Bernard dog--um--er----The magnificent Irish  Wolfhound Tara is going for fifty-four guineas only; for fifty-four  guin--and one----Thank _you_, sir\"--this to the ferret-faced  dealer--\"at fifty-five guineas only, this noble animal is going for  fif----Why, gentlemen, what has come over us this afternoon? Her  record alone is worth more than that. You must know that if this  animal were sold by private treaty, double the sum would not  purchase her. What am I to say for the gentleman who appeared to be  recognized by this fine animal? Surely, sir, civility demands a  little recognition of such touching devotion!\"    \"We're not dealing in personalities, sir,\" snapped the Master.  \"Sixty guineas!\"    And then he turned on his heel; this desperate bid being far more  than he could afford. The auctioneer smiled amiably.    \"As you say, sir, this is strict business, strict business; and all  I am offered for this magnificent hound, gentlemen, is sixty  guineas! But my instructions are to sell, gentlemen; and sell I  must,"]]]
