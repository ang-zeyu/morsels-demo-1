It took the       Terrestrials many centuries to develop their exquisite and esoteric       art forms. How can you expect to comprehend them in a few short       years? Expose yourself to their art. Work, study, meditate.         Understanding will come, I promise you.         Helpfully yours,         Senbot Drosmig           *       *       *       *       *         _Paris_         Dear Senbot Drosmig:         _To think that I am enjoying the benefits of Terra while my wife       and little ones are forced to remain on Fizbus makes my heart ache.       Surely it is not fair that I should have so much and they so       little. Imagine the inestimable advantage to the fledgling of even       a short contact with Terrestrial culture!_         _Why cannot my loved ones come to join me so that we can share all       these wonderful spiritual experiences and be enriched by them       together?_         _Poignantly yours,_         _Tpooly N'Ox_           *       *       *       *       *         Dear Mr. N'Ox:         After all, it has been only five years since Fizbian spaceships       first came into contact with Terra. In keeping with our usual       colonial policy--so inappropriate and anachronistic when applied to       a well-developed civilization like Terra's--at first only males are       allowed to go to the new world until it is made certain over a       period of years that the planet is safe for mothers and future       mothers of Fizbus.         But Stet Zarnon himself, the celebrated and capable editor of the       Terran edition of _The Fizbus Times_, has taken up your cause, and       I promise you that eventually your loved ones will be able to join       you.         Meanwhile, work, study, meditate.         Helpfully yours,         Senbot Drosmig           *       *       *       *       *         _Ottawa_         _Dear Senbot Drosmig:_         _Having just completed a two-year tour of duty on Earth as part of       a diplomatic mission, I am regretfully leaving this fair planet.       What books, what objects of art, what, in short, souvenirs shall I       take back to Fizbus which will give our people some small idea of       Earth's rich cultural heritage and, at the same time, serve as       useful and appropriate gifts for my friends and relatives back       Home?_         _Inquiringly yours,_         _Solgus Zagroot_           *       *       *       *       *         Dear Mr. Zagroot:         Take back nothing but your memories. They will be your best       souvenirs.         Out of context, any other mementos might convey little, if       anything, of the true beauty and advanced spirituality of       Terrestrial culture, and you might cheapen them were you to use       them crassly as souvenirs. Furthermore, it is possible that you, in       your ignorance, might unwittingly select some items that give a       distorted and false idea of our extrafizbian friends.         The Fizbian-Earth Cultural Commission, sponsored by _The Fizbian       Times_, in conjunction with the consulate, is preparing a vast       program of cultural interchange. Leave it to them to do the great       work, for you can be sure they will do it well.         And be sure to tell your fellow-laborers in the diplomatic       vineyards that it is wiser not to send unapproved Terran souvenirs       back Home. They might cause a fatal misunderstanding between the       two worlds. Tell them to spend their time on Earth in working,       studying and meditating, rather than shopping.         Helpfully yours,         Senbot Drosmig           *       *       *       *       *    And now she--Tarb Morfatch--herself was going to be the guiding spirit  that brought enlightenment and uplift to countless thousands on Terra  and millions on Fizbus. Her name wouldn't appear on the columns, but the  reward of having helped should be enough. Besides, Drosmig was due to  retire soon. If she proved herself competent, she would take over the  column entirely and get the byline. Grupe had promised faithfully.    But what, she wondered, had put Drosmig \"out of commission\"?    The taxi drew up before a building with a vulgar number of floors  showing above ground.    \"Ah--before we--er--meet the others,\" Stet suggested, twitching his  crest, \"I was wondering whether you would care to--er--have dinner with  me tonight?\"    This roused Tarb from her speculations. \"Oh, I'd love to!\" _A date with  the boss right away!_    Stet fumbled in his garments for appropriate tokens with which to pay  the driver. \"You--you're not engaged or anything back Home, Miss  Morfatch?\"    \"Why, no,\" she said. \"It so happens that I'm not.\"    \"Splendid!\" He made an abortive gesture with his leg, then let her get  out of the taxi by herself. \"It makes the natives stare,\" he explained  abashedly.    \"But why shouldn't they?\" she asked, wondering whether to laugh or not.  \"How could they help but stare? We are different.\" _He must be joking._  She ventured a smile.    He smiled back, but made no reply.    The pavement was hard under her thinly covered soles. Now that walking  looked as if it would present a problem, the ban on wing use loomed more  threateningly. She had, of course, walked before--on wet days when her  wings were waterlogged or in high winds or when she had surface  business. However, the sidewalks on Fizbus were soft and resilient. Now  she understood why the Terrestrials wore such crippling foot armor, but  that didn't make her feel any better about it.    A box-shaped machine took the two Fizbians up to the twentieth story in  twice the time it would have taken them to fly the same distance. Tarb  supposed that the offices were in an attic instead of a basement because  exchange difficulties forced the _Times_ to such economy. She wondered  ruefully whether her own expense account would also suffer.    But it was no time to worry about such sordid matters; most important  right now was making a favorable impression on her co-workers. She did  want them to like her.    Taking out her compact, she carefully polished her eyeballs. The man at  the controls of the machine practically performed a ritual _entrechat_.    \"Don't do that!\" Stet ordered in a harsh whisper.    \"But why not?\" she asked, unable to restrain a trace of belligerence  from her voice. He hadn't been very polite himself. \"The handbook said  respectable Terran women make up in public. Why shouldn't I?\"    He sighed. \"It'll take time for you to catch on, I suppose. There's a  lot the handbook doesn't--can't--cover. You'll find the setup here  rather different from on Fizbus,\" he went on as he kicked open the door  neatly lettered _THE FIZBUS TIMES_ in both Fizbian and Terran. \"We've  found it expedient to follow the local newspaper practice. For  instance--\" he indicated a small green-feathered man seated at a desk  just beyond the railing that bisected the room horizontally--\"we have a  Copy Editor.\"    \"What does he do?\" she asked, confused.    \"He copies news from the other papers, of course.\"    \"And what are _you_ doing tonight, Miss Morfatch?\" the Copy Editor  asked, springing up from his desk to execute the three ritual entrechats  with somewhat more verve than was absolutely necessary.    \"Having dinner with me,\" Stet said quickly.    \"Pulling rank, eh, old bird? Well, we'll see whether position or  sterling worth will win out in the end.\"    As the rest of the staff crowded around Tarb, leaping and booing as  appreciatively as any girl could want, she managed to snatch a rapid  look around. The place wasn't really so very much different from a  Fizbian newsroom, once she got over the oddity of going across, not up  and down, with the desks--queerly shaped but undeniably desks--arranged  side by side instead of one over the other. There were chairs and  stools, no perches, but that was to be expected in a wingless society.  And it was noisy. Even though the little machines had stopped clattering  when she came in, a distant roaring continued, as if, concealed  somewhere close by, larger, more sinister machines continued their work.  A peculiar smell hung in the air--not unpleasant, exactly, but strange.    She sniffed inquiringly.    \"Ink,\" Stet said.    \"What's that?\"    \"Oh, some stuff the boys in the back shop use. The feature writers,\" he  went on quickly, before she could ask what the \"back shop\" was, \"have  private offices where they can perch in comfort.\"    He led the way down a corridor, opening doors. \"Our drama editor.\" He  indicated a middle-aged man with faded blue feathers, who hung head  downward from his perch. \"On the lobster-trick last night writing a  review, so he's catching fifty-one twinkles now.\"    \"Enchanted, Miss Morfatch,\" the critic said, opening one bright eye. \"By  a curious chance, it so happens that tonight I have two tickets to--\"    \"Tonight she's going out with me.\"    \"Well, I can get tickets to any play, any night. And you haven't laughed  unless you've seen a Terrestrial drama. Just say the word, chick.\"    Stet got Tarb out of the office and slammed the door shut. \"Over here is  the office of our food editor,\" he said, breathing hard, \"whom you'll be  expected to give a claw to now and then, since your jobs overlap. Can't  introduce you to him right now, though, because he's in the hospital  with ptomaine poisoning. And this is the office you'll share with  Drosmig.\"    Stet opened the door.    Underneath the perch, Senbot Drosmig, dean of Fizbian journalists, lay  on the rug in a sodden stupor, letters to the editor scattered thickly  over his shriveled person. The whole room reeked unmistakably of  caffeine.    Tarb shrank back and twined both feet around Stet's. This time"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/31648"],[0,"My Fair Planet (#2)"],[1,"of trying my hand at a  musical com--\"    \"I mean we have had a ser--grave population problem for the last couple  of centuries, hence our government has sent out scouts to look for other  planets with similar atmosphere, climate, gravity and so on, where we  can ship our excess population. So far, we have found very few.\"    When Paul's attention was focused, he could be as quick as anybody to  put two and two together. \"But Earth is already occupied. In fact, when  I was in school, I heard something about our having a population problem  ourselves.\"    \"The other planets we already--ah--took over were in a similar state,\"  Ivo explained. \"We managed to surmount that difficulty.\"    \"How?\" Paul asked, though he already suspected the answer.    \"Oh, we didn't dispose of _all_ of the inhabitants. We merely weeded out  the undesirables--who, by fortunate chance, happened to be in the  majority--and achieved a happy and peaceful coexistence with the rest.\"    \"But, look,\" Paul protested. \"I mean to say----\"    \"For instance,\" Ivo said suavely, \"take the vast body of people who  watch television and who have never seen a legitimate play in their  lives and, indeed, rarely go to the motion pictures. Surely they are  expendable.\"    \"Well, yes, of course. But even among them there might be--oh, say, a  playwright's mother--\"    \"One of the first measures our regime would take would be to establish a  vast network of community theaters throughout the world. And you, Paul,  would receive first choice of starring roles.\"    \"Now wait a minute!\" Paul cried hotly. He seldom allowed himself to lose  his temper, but when he did ... he got _angry_! \"I pride myself that  I've gotten this far wholly on my own merits. I don't believe in using  influence to--\"    \"But, my dear fellow, all I meant was that, with an intelligently  coordinated theater and an intellectually adult audience, your abilities  would be recognized automatically.\"    \"Oh,\" said Paul.    He was not unaware that he was being flattered, but it was so seldom  that anyone bothered to pay him any attention when he was not playing a  role that it was difficult not to succumb. \"Are--are you figuring on  taking over the planet single-handed?\" he asked curiously.    \"Heavens, no! Talented as I am, there are limits. I don't do  the--ah--dirty work myself. I just conduct the preliminary investigation  to determine how powerful the local defenses are.\"    \"We have hydrogen bombs,\" Paul said, trying to remember details of a  newspaper article he had once read in a producer's ante-room, \"and  plutonium bombs and--\"    \"Oh, I know about all those,\" Ivo smiled expertly. \"My job is checking  to make sure you don't have anything really dangerous.\"    All that night, Paul wrestled with his conscience. He knew he shouldn't  just let Ivo go on. Yet what else could he do? Go to the proper  authorities? But which authorities were the proper ones? And even if he  found them, who would believe an actor offstage, delivering such  improbable lines? He would either be laughed at or accused of being part  of a subversive plot. It might result in a lot of bad publicity which  could ruin his career.    So Paul did nothing about Ivo. He went back to the usual rounds of  agents' and producers' offices, and the knowledge of why Ivo was on  Earth got pushed farther into the back of his mind as he trudged from  interview to reading to interview.    [Illustration]    It was an exceptionally hot October--the kind of weather when sometimes  he almost lost his faith and began to wonder why he was batting his head  against a stone wall, why he didn't get a job in a department store  somewhere or teaching school. And then he thought of the applause, the  curtain calls, the dream of some day seeing his name in lights above the  title of the play--and he knew he would never give up. Quitting the  theater would be like committing suicide, for off the stage he was alive  only technically. He was good; he knew he was good, so some day, he  assured himself, he was bound to get his big break.    Toward the end of that month, it came. After the maximum three readings,  between which his hopes alternately waxed and waned, he was cast as the  male lead in _The Holiday Tree_. The producers were more interested,  they said, in getting someone who fitted the role of Eric Everard than  in a big name--especially since the female star preferred to have her  luster undimmed by competition.    Rehearsals took up so much of his time that he saw very little of Ivo  for the next five weeks--but by then Ivo didn't need him any more.  Actually, they were no longer teacher and pupil now but companions,  drawn together by the fact that they both belonged to different worlds  from the one in which they were living. Insofar as he could like anyone  who existed outside of his imagination, Paul had grown rather fond of  Ivo. And he rather thought Ivo liked him, too--but, because he couldn't  ever be quite sure of ordinary people's reactions toward him, how could  he be sure of an outworlder's?    Ivo came around to rehearsals sometimes, but naturally it would be  boring for him, since he wasn't in the profession, and, after a while,  he didn't come around very often. At first, Paul felt a twinge of guilt;  then he remembered that he need not worry. Ivo had his own work.           *       *       *       *       *    The whole _Holiday Tree_ troupe went out of town for the tryouts, and  Paul didn't see Ivo at all for six weeks. Busy, happy weeks they were,  for the play was a smash hit from the start. It played to packed houses  in New Haven and Boston, and the box office in New York was sold out for  months in advance before they even opened.    \"Must be kinda fun--acting,\" Ivo told Paul the morning after the New  York opening, as Paul weltered contentedly on his bed--he had the best  room in the house now--amid a pile of rave notices. At long last, he had  arrived. Everybody loved him. He was a success.    And now that he had read the reviews and they were all favorable, he  could pay attention to the strange things that had happened to his  friend. Raising himself up on an elbow, Paul cried, \"Ivo, you're  _mumbling_! After all I taught you about articulation!\"    \"I got t'hanging 'round with this here buncha actors while y'were gone,\"  Ivo said. \"They say mumbling's the comin' thing. 'Sides, y'kept yapping  that I declaimed, so--\"    \"But you don't have to go to the opposite extreme and--_Ivo_!\"  Incredulously, Paul took in the full details of the other's appearance.  \"What happened to your Brooks Brothers' suits?\"    \"Hung 'em inna closet,\" Ivo replied, looking abashed. \"I did wear one  las' night, though,\" he went on defensively. \"Wooden come dressed like  this to y'opening. But all the other fellas wear blue jeans 'n leather  jackets. I mean, hell, I gotta conform more'n anybody. Y'know that,  Paul.\"    \"And--\" Paul sat bolt upright; this was the supreme outrage--\"you've  changed yourself! You've gotten _younger_!\"    \"This is an age of yout',\" Ivo mumbled. \"An' I figured I was 'bout ready  for improvisation, like you said.\"    \"Look, Ivo, if you really want to go on the stage----\"    \"Hell, I don' wanna be no actor!\" Ivo protested, far too vehemently.  \"Y'know damn' well I'm a--a spy, scoutin' 'round t'see if y'have any  secret defenses before I make m'report.\"    \"I don't feel I'm giving away any government secrets,\" Paul said, \"when  I tell you that the bastions of our defenses are not erected at the  Actors' Studio.\"    \"Listen, pal, you lemme spy the way I wanna an' I'll letcha act the way  you wanna.\"    Paul was disturbed by this change in Ivo because, although he had  always tried to steer clear of social involvement, he could not  help feeling that the young alien had become in a measure his  responsibility--particularly now that he was a teen-ager. Paul would  even have worried about Ivo, if there hadn't been so many other things  to occupy his mind. First of all, the producers of _The Holiday Tree_  could not resist the pressure of an adoring public; although the  original star sulked, three months after the play had opened in New  York, Paul's name went up in lights next to hers, _over the title of the  play. He was a star._    That was good. But then there was Gregory. And that was bad. Gregory was  Paul's understudy--a handsome, sullen youth who had, on numerous  occasions, been heard to utter words to the effect of: \"It's the part  that's so good, not him. If I had the chance to play Eric Everard just  once, they'd give Lambrequin back to the Indians.\"    Sometimes he had said the words in Paul's hearing; sometimes the remarks  had been lovingly passed on by fellow members of the cast who felt that  Paul ought to know.           *       *       *       *       *    \"I don't like that Gregory,\" Paul told Ivo one Monday evening as they  were enjoying a quiet smoke together, for there was no performance that  night. \"He used to be a juvenile delinquent, got sent to one of those  reform schools where they use acting as therapy and it turned out to be  his _metier_. But you never know when that kind'll hear the call of the  wild again.\"    \"Aaaah, he's a good kid,\" Ivo said. \"He just never had a chanct.\"    \"Trouble is, I'm afraid he's going to _make_ himself a chanct--chance,  that is.\"    \"Aaaah,\" retorted Ivo, with prideful inarticulateness.    However, when at six-thirty that Friday, Paul fell over a wire stretched  between the jambs of the doorway leading to his private bathroom and  broke a leg, even Ivo was forced to admit that this did not look like an  accident.    \"Ivo,\" Paul wailed when the doctor had left, \"what am I going to do? I  refuse to let Gregory go on in my place tonight!\"    \"Y'gonna hafta,\" Ivo said, shifting his gum to the other side of his  mouth. \"He's y'unnastudy.\"    \"But the doctor said it would be weeks before I can get around again.  Either Gregory'll take over the part"]]]
