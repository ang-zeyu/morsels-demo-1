Up  above, on the ruined, blasted surface of what had once been a living  planet, the leady crawled and scurried, and fought Man's war. And  undersurface, in the depths of the planet, human beings toiled endlessly  to produce the weapons to continue the fight, month by month, year by  year.           *       *       *       *       *    \"First stage,\" Taylor said. A strange ache went through him. \"Almost to  the surface.\"    \"But not quite,\" Moss said.    Franks led them through the soldiers, over to one side, near the lip of  the Tube.    \"In a few minutes, a lift will bring something down to us from the  surface,\" he explained. \"You see, Taylor, every once in a while Security  examines and interrogates a surface leady, one that has been above for a  time, to find out certain things. A vidcall is sent up and contact is  made with a field headquarters. We need this direct interview; we can't  depend on vidscreen contact alone. The leadys are doing a good job, but  we want to make certain that everything is going the way we want it.\"    Franks faced Taylor and Moss and continued: \"The lift will bring down a  leady from the surface, one of the A-class leadys. There's an  examination chamber in the next room, with a lead wall in the center, so  the interviewing officers won't be exposed to radiation. We find this  easier than bathing the leady. It is going right back up; it has a job  to get back to.    \"Two days ago, an A-class leady was brought down and interrogated. I  conducted the session myself. We were interested in a new weapon the  Soviets have been using, an automatic mine that pursues anything that  moves. Military had sent instructions up that the mine be observed and  reported in detail.    \"This A-class leady was brought down with information. We learned a few  facts from it, obtained the usual roll of film and reports, and then  sent it back up. It was going out of the chamber, back to the lift, when  a curious thing happened. At the time, I thought--\"    Franks broke off. A red light was flashing.    \"That down lift is coming.\" He nodded to some soldiers. \"Let's enter the  chamber. The leady will be along in a moment.\"    \"An A-class leady,\" Taylor said. \"I've seen them on the showscreens,  making their reports.\"    \"It's quite an experience,\" Moss said. \"They're almost human.\"           *       *       *       *       *    They entered the chamber and seated themselves behind the lead wall.  After a time, a signal was flashed, and Franks made a motion with his  hands.    The door beyond the wall opened. Taylor peered through his view slot. He  saw something advancing slowly, a slender metallic figure moving on a  tread, its arm grips at rest by its sides. The figure halted and scanned  the lead wall. It stood, waiting.    \"We are interested in learning something,\" Franks said. \"Before I  question you, do you have anything to report on surface conditions?\"    \"No. The war continues.\" The leady's voice was automatic and toneless.  \"We are a little short of fast pursuit craft, the single-seat type. We  could use also some--\"    \"That has all been noted. What I want to ask you is this. Our contact  with you has been through vidscreen only. We must rely on indirect  evidence, since none of us goes above. We can only infer what is going  on. We never see anything ourselves. We have to take it all secondhand.  Some top leaders are beginning to think there's too much room for  error.\"    \"Error?\" the leady asked. \"In what way? Our reports are checked  carefully before they're sent down. We maintain constant contact with  you; everything of value is reported. Any new weapons which the enemy is  seen to employ--\"    \"I realize that,\" Franks grunted behind his peep slot. \"But perhaps we  should see it all for ourselves. Is it possible that there might be a  large enough radiation-free area for a human party to ascend to the  surface? If a few of us were to come up in lead-lined suits, would we be  able to survive long enough to observe conditions and watch things?\"    The machine hesitated before answering. \"I doubt it. You can check air  samples, of course, and decide for yourselves. But in the eight years  since you left, things have continually worsened. You cannot have any  real idea of conditions up there. It has become difficult for any moving  object to survive for long. There are many kinds of projectiles  sensitive to movement. The new mine not only reacts to motion, but  continues to pursue the object indefinitely, until it finally reaches  it. And the radiation is everywhere.\"    \"I see.\" Franks turned to Moss, his eyes narrowed oddly. \"Well, that was  what I wanted to know. You may go.\"    The machine moved back toward its exit. It paused. \"Each month the  amount of lethal particles in the atmosphere increases. The tempo of the  war is gradually--\"    \"I understand.\" Franks rose. He held out his hand and Moss passed him  the package. \"One thing before you leave. I want you to examine a new  type of metal shield material. I'll pass you a sample with the tong.\"    Franks put the package in the toothed grip and revolved the tong so that  he held the other end. The package swung down to the leady, which took  it. They watched it unwrap the package and take the metal plate in its  hands. The leady turned the metal over and over.    Suddenly it became rigid.    \"All right,\" Franks said.    He put his shoulder against the wall and a section slid aside. Taylor  gasped--Franks and Moss were hurrying up to the leady!    \"Good God!\" Taylor said. \"But it's radioactive!\"           *       *       *       *       *    The leady stood unmoving, still holding the metal. Soldiers appeared in  the chamber. They surrounded the leady and ran a counter across it  carefully.    \"Okay, sir,\" one of them said to Franks. \"It's as cold as a long winter  evening.\"    \"Good. I was sure, but I didn't want to take any chances.\"    \"You see,\" Moss said to Taylor, \"this leady isn't hot at all. Yet it  came directly from the surface, without even being bathed.\"    \"But what does it mean?\" Taylor asked blankly.    \"It may be an accident,\" Franks said. \"There's always the possibility  that a given object might escape being exposed above. But this is the  second time it's happened that we know of. There may be others.\"    \"The second time?\"    \"The previous interview was when we noticed it. The leady was not hot.  It was cold, too, like this one.\"    Moss took back the metal plate from the leady's hands. He pressed the  surface carefully and returned it to the stiff, unprotesting fingers.    \"We shorted it out with this, so we could get close enough for a  thorough check. It'll come back on in a second now. We had better get  behind the wall again.\"    They walked back and the lead wall swung closed behind them. The  soldiers left the chamber.    \"Two periods from now,\" Franks said softly, \"an initial investigating  party will be ready to go surface-side. We're going up the Tube in  suits, up to the top--the first human party to leave undersurface in  eight years.\"    \"It may mean nothing,\" Moss said, \"but I doubt it. Something's going on,  something strange. The leady told us no life could exist above without  being roasted. The story doesn't fit.\"    Taylor nodded. He stared through the peep slot at the immobile metal  figure. Already the leady was beginning to stir. It was bent in several  places, dented and twisted, and its finish was blackened and charred. It  was a leady that had been up there a long time; it had seen war and  destruction, ruin so vast that no human being could imagine the extent.  It had crawled and slunk in a world of radiation and death, a world  where no life could exist.    And Taylor had touched it!    \"You're going with us,\" Franks said suddenly. \"I want you along. I think  the three of us will go.\"           *       *       *       *       *    Mary faced him with a sick and frightened expression. \"I know it. You're  going to the surface. Aren't you?\"    She followed him into the kitchen. Taylor sat down, looking away from  her.    \"It's a classified project,\" he evaded. \"I can't tell you anything about  it.\"    \"You don't have to tell me. I know. I knew it the moment you came in.  There was something on your face, something I haven't seen there for a  long, long time. It was an old look.\"    She came toward him. \"But how can they send you to the surface?\" She  took his face in her shaking hands, making him look at her. There was a  strange hunger in her eyes. \"Nobody can live up there. Look, look at  this!\"    She grabbed up a newspaper and held it in front of him.    \"Look at this photograph. America, Europe, Asia, Africa--nothing but  ruins. We've seen it every day on the showscreens. All destroyed,  poisoned. And they're sending you up. Why? No living thing can get by up  there, not even a weed, or grass. They've wrecked the surface, haven't  they? _Haven't they?_\"    Taylor stood up. \"It's an order. I know nothing about it. I was told to  report to join a scout party. That's all I know.\"    He stood for a long time, staring ahead. Slowly, he reached for the  newspaper and held it up to the light.    \"It looks real,\" he murmured. \"Ruins, deadness, slag. It's convincing.  All the reports, photographs, films, even air samples. Yet we haven't  seen it for ourselves, not after the first months ...\"    \"What are you talking about?\"    \"Nothing.\" He put the paper down. \"I'm leaving early after the next  Sleep Period. Let's turn in.\"    Mary turned away, her face hard and harsh. \"Do what you want. We might  just as well all go up and get killed at once, instead of dying slowly  down here, like vermin in the ground.\"    He had not realized how resentful she was. Were they all like that? How  about the workers toiling in the factories, day and night, endlessly?

(17) As soon  as the people were under the necessity of providing for their daily  wants, they grew negligent in the study of the Torah. Therefore the  angel admonished Joshua to loose his shoes from off his feet, for  he was to mourn over the decline of the study of the Torah, (18)  and bare feet are a sign of mourning. The angel reproached Joshua  in particular with having allowed the preparations for war to  interfere with the study of the Torah and with the ritual service.  Neglect of the latter might be a venial sin, but neglect of the  former is worthy of condign punishment. (19) At the same time the  angel assured Joshua that he had come to aid him, and he entreated  Joshua not to draw back from him, like Moses, who had refused  the good offices of the angel. (20) He who spoke to Joshua was  none other than the archangel Michael. (21)     CONQUEST OF THE LAND    Joshua's first victory was the wonderful capture of Jericho. The  whole of the city was declared anathema, because it had been  conquered on the Sabbath day. Joshua reasoned that as the Sabbath  is holy, so also that which conquered on the Sabbath should be  holy. (22) The brilliant victory was followed by the luckless defeat  at Ai. In this engagement perished Jair, the son of Manasseh,  whose loss was as great as if the majority of the Sanhedrin had  been destroyed. (23) Presently Joshua discovered that the cause of  the defeat was the sinfulness of Israel, brought upon it by Achan,  who had laid hands on some of the spoils of Jericho. Achan was a  hardened transgressor and criminal from of old. During the life of  Moses he had several times appropriated to his own use things that  had been declared anathema, (24) and he had committed other  crimes worthy of the death penalty. (25) Before the Israelites  crossed the Jordan, God had not visited Achan's sins upon the  people as a whole, because at that time it did not form a national  unit yet. But when Achan abstracted an idol and all its  appurtenances from Jericho, (26) the misfortune of Ai followed at  once.    Joshua inquired of God, why trouble had befallen Israel, but God  refused to reply. He was no tale-bearer; the evil-doer who had  caused the disaster would have to be singled out by lot. (27)  Joshua first of all summoned the high priest from the assembly of  the people. It appeared that, while the other jewels in his  breastplate gleamed bright, the stone representing the tribe of  Judah was dim. (28) By lot Achan was set apart from the members  of his tribe. Achan, however, refused to submit to the decision by  lot. He said to Joshua: \"Among all living men thou and Phinehas  are the most pious. Yet, if lots were cast concerning you two, one  or other of you would be declared guilty. Thy teacher Moses has  been dead scarcely one month, and thou has already begun to go  astray, for thou hast forgotten that a man's guilt can be proved only  through two witnesses.\"    Endued with the holy spirit, Joshua divined that the land was to be  assigned to the tribes and families of Israel by lot, and he realized  that nothing ought to be done to bring this method of deciding into  disrepute. He, therefore, tried to persuade Achan to make a clean  breast of his transgression. (29) Meantime, the Judeans, the  tribesmen of Achan, rallied about him, and throwing themselves  upon the other tribes, they wrought fearful havoc and bloodshed.  This determined Achan to confess his sins. (30) The confession  cost him his life, but it saved him from losing his share in the  world to come. (31)    In spite of the reverses at Ai, (32) the terror inspired by the  Israelites grew among the Canaanitish peoples. The Gibeonites  planned to circumvent the invaders, and form an alliance with  them. Now, before Joshua set out on his campaign, he had issued  three proclamations: the nation that would leave Canaan might  depart unhindered; the nation that would conclude peace with the  Israelites, should do it at once; and the nation that would choose  war, should make its preparations. If the Gibeonites had sued for  the friendship of the Jews when the proclamation came to their  ears, there would have been no need for subterfuges later. But the  Canaanites had to see with their own eyes what manner of enemy  awaited them, and all the nations prepared for war. The result was  that the thirty-one kings of Palestine perished, as well as the  satraps of many foreign kings, who were proud to own possessions  in the Holy Land. (33) Only the Girgashites departed out of  Palestine, and as a reward for their docility God gave them Africa  as an inheritance. (34)    The Gibeonites deserved no better fate than all the rest, for the  covenant made with them rested upon a misapprehension, yet  Joshua kept his promise to them, in order to sanctify the name of  God, by showing the world how sacred an oath is to the Israelites.  (35) In the course of events it became obvious that the Gibeonites  were by no means worthy of being received into the Jewish  communion, and David, following Joshua's example, excluded  them forever, a sentence that will remain in force even in the  Messianic time. (36)     THE SUN OBEYS JOSHUA    The task of protecting the Gibeonites involved in the offensive and  defensive alliance made with them, Joshua fulfilled scrupulously.  He had hesitated for a moment whether to aid the Gibeonites in  their distress, but the words of God sufficed to recall him to his  duty. God said to him: \"If thou dost not bring near them that are far  off, thou wilt remove them that are near by.\" (37) God granted  Joshua peculiar favor in his conflict with the assailants of the  Gibeonites. The hot hailstones which, at Moses' intercession, had  remained suspended in the air when they were about to fall upon  the Egyptians, were now cast down upon the Canaanites. (38)  Then happened the great wonder of the sun's standing still, the  sixth (39) of the great wonders since the creation of the world.    The battle took place on a Friday. Joshua knew it would pain the  people deeply to be compelled to desecrate the holy Sabbath day.  Besides, he noticed that the heathen were using sorcery to make  the heavenly hosts intercede for them in the fight against the  Israelites. He, therefore, pronounced the Name of the Lord, and the  sun, moon and stars stood still. (40) The sun at first refused to  obey Joshua's behest, seeing that he was older than man by two  days. Joshua replied that there was no reason why a free-born  youth should refrain from enjoining silence upon an old slave  whom he owns, and had not God given heaven and earth to our  father Abraham? (41) Nay, more than this, had not the sun himself  bowed down like a slave before Joseph? \"But,\" said the sun, \"who  will praise God if I am silent?\" (42) Whereupon Joshua: \"Be thou  silent, and I will intone a song of praise.\" (43) And he sang thus:    1. Thou hast done mighty things, O Lord, Thou has performed  great deeds. Who is like unto Thee? My lips shall sing unto Thy  name.    2. My goodness and my fortress, my refuge, I will sing a new song  unto Thee, with thanksgiving I will sing unto Thee, Thou art the  strength of my salvation.    3. All the kings of the earth shall praise Thee, the princes of the  world shall sing unto Thee, the children of Israel shall rejoice in  Thy salvation, they shall sing and praise Thy power.    4. In Thee, O God, did we trust; we said, Thou art our God, for  Thou wast our shelter and our strong tower against our enemies.    5. To Thee we cried, and we were not ashamed; in Thee we  trusted, and we were delivered; when we cried unto Thee, Thou  didst hear our voice, Thou didst deliver our souls from the sword.    6. Thou hast shown unto us Thy mercy, Thou didst give unto us  Thy salvation, Thou didst rejoice our hearts with Thy strength.    7. Thou wentest forth for our salvation; with the strength of Thy  arm Thou didst redeem Thy people; Thou did console us from the  heavens of Thy holiness, Thou didst save us from tens of  thousands.    8. Sun and moon stood still in heaven, and Thou didst stand in Thy  wrath against our oppressors, and Thou didst execute Thy  judgements upon them.    9. All the princes of the earth stood up, the kings of the nations had  gathered themselves together, they were not moved at Thy  presence, they desired Thy battles.    10. Thou didst rise against them in Thine anger, and Thou didst  bring down Thy wrath upon them, Thou didst destroy them in Thy  fury, and Thou didst ruin them in Thy rage.    11. Nations raged from fear of Thee, kingdoms tottered because of  Thy wrath, Thou didst wound kings in the day of Thine anger.    12. Thou didst pour out Thy fury upon them, Thy wrathful anger  took hold of them, Thou didst turn their iniquity upon them, and  Thou didst cut them off in their wickedness.    13. They spread a trap, they fell therein, in the net they hid their  foot was caught.    14. Thine hand found all Thine enemies, who said, through their  sword they possessed the land, through their arm thy dwelt in the  city.    15. Thou didst fill their faces with shame, Thou didst bring their  horns down to the ground.    16. Thou didst terrify them in Thy wrath, and thou didst destroy  them from before Thee.    17. The earth quaked and trembled from the noise of Thy thunder  against them; Thou didst not withhold their souls from earth, and  Thou didst bring down their lives to the grave.    18. Thou didst pursue them in Thy storm, Thou didst consume  them in the whirlwind, Thou didst turn their rain into hail, they fell  in floods, so that they could not rise.    19. Their carcasses were like rubbish cast out in the middle of the  streets.    20. They were consumed, and they perished before Thee, Thou  hast delivered Thy people in Thy might.    21. Therefore our hearts rejoice in Thee, our souls exult in Thy  salvation.    22. Our tongues shall relate Thy might, we will "]]]
