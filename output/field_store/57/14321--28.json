The glances which, from time to  time, he cast upon the backwoodsman at the other end of the rope  became wary, calculating, and hostile. This stalwart form, striding  before him, was the one barrier between himself and freedom. Freedom  was a thing of which he knew, indeed, nothing,--a thing which, to most  of his kind, would have seemed terrifying rather than alluring. But to  him, with that inherited wildness stirring in his blood, it seemed the  thing to be craved before all else.    Presently they came to a little cold spring, bubbling up beside the  road and tinkling over the steep bank. The road at this point ran  along a hillside, and the slope below the road was clothed with  blueberry and other dense shrubs. The backwoodsman was hot and  thirsty. Flinging aside his battered hat, he dropped down on his hands  and knees beside the spring and touched his lips to the water.    In this position, still holding the rope in a firm grasp, he had his  back to the ram. Moreover, he no longer looked either formidable or  commanding. The ram saw his chance. A curious change came over his  mild, yellow eyes. They remained yellow, indeed, but became cold,  sinister, and almost cruel in their expression.    The backwoodsman, as he drank, held a tight grip on the rope. The ram  settled back slightly, till the rope was almost taut. Then he launched  himself forward. His movement was straight and swift, as if he had  been propelled by a gigantic spring. His massive, broad-horned  forehead struck the stooping man with terrific force.    With a grunt of pain and amazement, the man shot sprawling over the  bank, and landed, half-stunned, in a clump of blueberry bushes. Dazed  and furious, he picked himself up, passed a heavy hand across his  scratched, smarting face, and turned to see the ram disappearing among  the thickets above the road. His disappointment so overcame his wrath  that he forgot to exercise his vigorous backwoods vocabulary, and  resumed his homeward way with his head full of plans for the  recapture of his prize.    The ram, meanwhile, trailing the length of rope behind him, was  galloping madly through the woods. He was intoxicated with his  freedom. These rough, wild, lonely places seemed to him his home. With  all his love for the wilderness, the instinct which had led him to it  was altogether faulty and incomplete. It supplied him with none of the  needful forest lore. He had no idea of caution. He had no inkling of  fear. He had no conception of the enemies that might lurk in thicket  or hollow. He went crashing ahead as if the green world belonged to  him, and cared not who might hear the brave sound of his going. Now  and then he stepped on the rope, and stumbled; but that was a small  matter.    Through dark strips of forest, over rocky, tangled spaces, across  slopes of burnt barren, his progress was always upward, until, having  traversed several swampy vales and shadowy ravines, toward evening he  came out upon the empty summit of Ringwaak. On the topmost hillock he  took his stand proudly, his massive head and broad, curled horns in  splendid relief against the amber sky.    As he stood, surveying his new realm, a low bleat came to him from a  sheltered hollow close by, and, looking down, he saw a small white ewe  with a new-born lamb nursing under her flank. Here was his new realm  peopled at once. Here were followers of his own kind. He stepped  briskly down from his hillock and graciously accepted the homage of  the ewe, who snuggled up against him as if afraid at the loneliness  and the coming on of night. All night he slept beside the mother and  her young, in the sheltered hollow, and kept no watch because he  feared no foe. But the ewe kept watch, knowing well what perils might  steal upon them in the dark.    As it chanced, however, no midnight prowler visited the summit of  Ringwaak Hill, and the first of dawn found the great ram again at his  post of observation. It is possible that he had another motive besides  his interest in his new, wonderful world. He may have expected the  woodsman to follow and attempt his recapture, and resolved not to be  taken unawares. Whatever his motive, he kept his post till the sun was  high above the horizon, and the dew-wet woods gleamed as if sown with  jewels. Then he came down and began to feed with the ewe, cropping the  short, thin grass with quick bites and finding it far more sweet than  the heavy growths of his old pasture.    Late in the morning, when pasturing was over for the time, the ram and  the little ewe lay down in the shade of a steep rock, comfortably  chewing their cud, while the lamb slept at its mother's side. The ram,  deeply contented, did not observe two gray-brown, stealthy forms  creeping along the slope, from bush to rock, and from stump to  hillock. But the ewe, ever on the watch, presently caught sight of  them, and sprang to her feet with a snort of terror. She knew well  enough what a lynx was. Yet for all her terror she had no thought of  flight. Her lamb was too young to flee, and she would stay by it in  face of any fate.    The ram got up more slowly, turned his head, and eyed the stealthy  strangers with grave curiosity. Curiosity, however, changed into  hostility as he saw by the ewe's perturbation that the strangers were  foes; and a sinister glitter came into the great gold eyes which shone  so brilliantly from his black face.    [Illustration: \"THROUGH DARK STRIPS OF FOREST.\"]    Seeing themselves discovered, the two lynxes threw aside their cunning  and rushed ravenously upon what they counted easy prey. They knew  something of the timorous hearts of sheep, and had little  expectation of resistance. But being, first of all, hungry rather than  angry, they preferred what seemed easiest to get. It was upon the lamb  and the ewe that they sprang, ignoring the ram contemptuously.    One thing which they had not reckoned with, however, was the temper of  the ewe. Before one fierce claw could reach her lamb, she had butted  the assailant so fiercely in the flank that he forgot his purpose and  turned with a snarl of rage to rend her. Meanwhile the other lynx,  springing for her neck, had experienced the unexpected. He had been  met by the lightning charge of the ram, fair in the ribs, and hurled  sprawling into a brittle, pointed tangle of dead limbs sticking up  from the trunk of a fallen tree.    Having delivered this most effective blow, the ram stepped back a pace  or two, mincing on his slender feet, and prepared to repeat it. The  lynx was struggling frantically among the branches, which stuck into  him and tore his fine fur. Just in time to escape the second assault  he got free,--but free not for fight but for flight. One tremendous,  wildly contorted leap landed him on the other side of the dead tree;  and, thoroughly cowed, he scurried away down the hillside.    The ram at once turned his attention to the ewe and her antagonist.  But the second lynx, who had not found his task so simple as he had  expected it to be, had no stomach left for one more difficult. The ewe  was bleeding about the head, and would, of course, if she had been  left to fight it out, have been worsted in a very short time. But the  enemy had felt the weight of her blows upon his ribs, and had learned  his lesson. For just a fraction of a second he turned, and defied the  ram with a screeching snarl. But when that horned, black, battering  head pitched forward at him he bounded aside like a furry gray ball  and clambered to the top of the rock. Here he crouched for some  moments, snarling viciously, his tufted ears set back against his  neck, and his stump of a tail twitching with rage, while the ram  minced to and fro beneath him, stamping defiance with his dainty  hoofs. All at once the big cat doubled upon itself, slipped down the  other side of the rock, and went gliding away through the stumps and  hillocks like a gray shadow; and the ram, perhaps to conceal his  elation, fell to grazing as if nothing out of the ordinary had  happened. The ewe, on the other hand, seeing the danger so well past,  took no thought of her torn face, but set herself to comfort and  reassure the trembling lamb.    After this, through the slow, bright hours while the sun swung hotly  over Ringwaak, the ram and his little family were undisturbed. An  eagle, wheeling, wheeling, wheeling in the depths of the blue, looked  down and noted the lamb. But he had no thought of attacking so well  guarded a prey. The eagle had a wider outlook than others of the wild  kindred, and he knew from of old many matters which the lynxes of  Ringwaak had never learned till that day.    There were other visitors that came and glanced at the little family  during the quiet content of their cud-chewing. A weasel ran restlessly  over a hillock and peered down upon them with hard, bright eyes. The  big ram, with his black face and huge, curling horns, was a novel  phenomenon, and the weasel disappeared behind the hillock, only to  appear again much nearer, around a clump of weeds. His curiosity was  mingled with malicious contempt, till the ram chanced to rise and  shake his head. Then the weasel saw the rope that wriggled from the  ram's neck. Was it some new and terrible kind of snake? The weasel  respected snakes when they were large and active; so he forgot his  curiosity and slipped away from the dangerous neighbourhood.    The alarm of the weasel, however, was nothing to that of the  wood-mice. While the ram was lying down they came out of their secret  holes and played about securely, seeming to realize that the big  animal's presence was a safeguard to them. But when he moved, and they  saw the rope trail sinuously behind him through the scanty grass, they  were almost paralyzed with panic. Such a snake as that would require  all the wood-mice on"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/25731"],[0,"Ancient Egyptian and Greek Looms (#2)"],[1,"left  hand end of D2 than on the right hand end. Mr. Davies informs me that  the same quantity should be shown from end to end across the warp, but  on the right hand side they are so indistinct that he was just able to  detect but not to trace them and so he omitted them.    We now come to the rod E. Cailliaud and Rosellini show an undulation  at the one end _a_, but do not make the other end clear. Wilkinson  shows a small hook at the end _a_, which appears to me to be a  transcriber's development of the curved end of his two predecessors;  in the text Wilkinson says there is a hook at each end of this stick,  but he does not show any at the end opposite to _a_; he refers to  these hooks more than once (1st ed., III., p. 126 footnote). Lepsius  has altered the shape of the curve and transferred it from the end _a_  to the opposite end. In Mr. de G. Davies' drawing, it has been  inserted in dotted lines, as the original is in such a state that  tracing is almost impossible. Wilkinson, Erman, v. Cohausen (_Das  Spinnen u. Weben bei den Alten_, in _Ann. Ver. Nassau. Altherthumsk._,  Wiesbaden, 1879, p. 29), and others call it a shuttle, but I am more  inclined to consider it a slashing stick (\"sword\" or \"beater-in\") for  pushing the weft into position. A tool which appears to be a beater-in  and of similar end shape is seen held in the hand of a woman on a  wall painting at El Bersheh--see Fig. 11, top right-hand corner. We  have in another illustration, Fig. 7, an article which appears to be a  spool, which I think confirms the view that E is not the shuttle but  the beater-in. In all the illustrations, too, the pose of the hands of  the women bearing on this stick is indicative of a downward pressure  and not of a grasp.    [Illustration: Fig. 7.--Tomb of the Vizier Daga. Date about end XI.  Dynasty, B.C. 2000. Mr. N. de G. Davies' _Five Theban Tombs_, Plate  XXXVII.    The upper illustration indicates a woman warping or beaming, probably  warping.    In the lower illustration note the left hand figure holding the spool  in her hand. At first sight this small black line looks like a  continuation of the \"beater-in\" in the hands of the other weaver, but  Mr. Davies informs me that it is quite a distinct article, and that  there can be no doubt about it. Just above the breast beam there are 8  or 9 threads of weft but they are too faint to be included.]    The selvedge F on the one side of the cloth and not on both sides is  also interesting from the fact that selvedges do not appear on the  Egyptian cloths until the XVIII. Dynasty _circa_ B.C. 1600.    The breast beam:--It appears to me that the three portions marked G1,  G2 and G3 joined up are intended to represent the breast beam and its  holding pegs, similar to the warp beam A and its pegs B1, B2, but the  portion K is not clearly drawn in any of the reproductions. Wilkinson  omits this altogether, but in its place has two black pieces which  also are still less clear. Lepsius has omitted G2 altogether and  appears to have made G1 and K and G3 into treadles, by raising G1  above the level of G3, and to support the view that these are  treadles, he makes use of the overseer's foot by placing it on the  supposed treadle, and the casual observer thinks it is the foot of the  woman weaver. However, Mr. Davies' copy seems to offer a solution. He  agrees with Cailliaud and Rosellini in so far as G1, G2 and G3 are  concerned. With him K takes quite a different form, in fact it looks  very similar to an article which an attendant woman in another panel  has close by her, see Fig. 8. It might perhaps be a rest to prevent  the beater-in being driven home too forcibly--this, however, is still  only a surmise--as the length of the beater-in makes it heavy at the  far end.    [Illustration: Fig. 8.--Weaver with the support K, Fig. 6; the woman  appears to hold a beater-in in the right hand and a ball of thread in  the left hand. Rosellini.]    In Cailliaud the warp threads are coloured in pale blue and red on top  of the black lines of the drawing; he has painted the selvedge and  finished cloth a pale blue, as well as that portion of G2 which is  covered by the cloth indicating that this is the breast beam, G3 and  G1 are painted a dark red. Rosellini colours A, B1, B2, D1, D2, G3  orange; G1 and K dark red, but E from end to end light ochre. This  shows that K is distinct from E.    [Illustration: Fig. 9.    Upright or Vertical Looms from the Tomb of Thot-nefer at Thebes, XVIII  Dynasty, _circa_ B.C. 1425. From a drawing by Mr. N. de G. Davies. Size  of original: Height from Base Line to top of frame at A, 11-1/2\" = 29  cm.]    In consequence of this loom being represented as upright it is often  spoken of as an upright or vertical loom. But it is drawn upright  because the Egyptian artist did not understand perspective, and it was  only by making the loom upright that he was enabled to show the  details we have just been examining. For the same reason mat making is  illustrated edgeways. If the loom were an upright one the two women  weavers would have had their backs turned towards the onlooker as can  be seen in Fig. 9. Any doubt on the matter has however been set aside  by Prof. John Garstang's extremely interesting discovery of a wooden  model depicting a group of women spinning and weaving which he  illustrates in his work, _The Burial Customs of Ancient Egypt_,  London, 1907. After referring to the woman spinning, he continues:  \"The other seated figures apparently represent women at work upon a  horizontal loom; the frame and the woof [_sic_, should be _warp_]  threads are faintly represented upon the board. It is possible that  they are making mats or, perhaps, weaving (p. 132).\" He gives an  illustration of the group taken from a photograph, but as it does not  show the lines which indicate the loom lying horizontally on the  ground nor the warp threads, I have asked him to let me have a drawing  made of it and, with his kind permission, it is now reproduced here,  Fig. 10. The threads of the warp and the finished piece of cloth at  the breast beam end are clearly indicated. The whole model supports  conclusively the well founded supposition that the loom we have been  considering is a _horizontal_ one. Curiously enough, Prof. Garstang  does not appear to appreciate the important bearing of his discovery,  for on a later page (p. 134) in speaking of Lepsius' illustration,  discussed above, he says: \"the weavers are seen at work at an upright  loom.\"    [Illustration: Fig. 10.--Horizontal Loom. Outline sketch by Miss Davey  of the original model of a group of one woman spinning and two women  weaving, found by Dr. John Garstang at Beni Hasan. The model is in the  Museum of the Liverpool Institute of Archaeology.]    It must not be thought that the Beni Hasan representation is the only  one which illustrates a horizontal loom. A second one is reproduced by  Prof. Percy Newberry from the tomb of Tehuti-hetep _circa_ 1938-1849  B.C., see Fig. 11. In the upper portion the women are seen spinning  and preparing the thread generally, while in the lower portion two  women on the left are warping, and in the centre three apparently are  \"beaming,\" _i.e._ putting the warp on to the beams preparatory to  commencing to weave, the warp threads being apparently drawn over pegs  to ensure the proper tension. This illustration shows the warp flat  against the wall like the mat making shown at Beni Hasan.    [Illustration: Fig. 11.--Tomb of Tehuti-hetep. Date about 1939-1849  B.C. From Professor Percy Newberry's _El Bersheh_ I. Pl. 26.    Note the woman on the top right hand corner holding a \"beater-in.\"]    A third representation of a horizontal loom is reproduced from the  forthcoming volume of the Egypt Exploration Fund by kind permission of  Mr. N. de G. Davies, who made the copy. In this, Fig. 7, already  referred to, the lower portion is all that has come down to us. The  cloth is not shown contracted as in the Beni Hasan representation, the  two laze rods are drawn close to each other and here also an attempt  appears to have been made to show the over and under lapping warp  threads; the laze rods appear each with a hook, the hook on the upper  rod turned upwards and the hook (if it be one) on the lower rod turned  downwards. It is possible these hooks may be pegs to prevent the  shifting of the laze rods. It may be that one of the two rods is a  heddle rod the indication being the fine double lines, but this may  not be compatible with the hook at the end of the rod. The weaver on  the left holds a spool in her hand, evidently a piece of stick with  the weft thread wound round it, which she is pushing through with her  fingers. The weaver on the right holds a beater-in as shown in the  Beni Hasan drawing. The breast beam is held in position by two pegs  near the right one of which there is a curved article of indeterminate  use.    [Illustration: Fig. 12.--Study of a Bedawin Arab weaving, from a  sketch taken in the Forties of last Century, by Frank Goodall, R.A.  The original sketch is in Bankfield Museum. The weaver appears to be  provided with one heddle and a beater-in.]    There is no very clear evidence as to how the finished cloth was  \"taken up\" unless we accept it that the bulging out of the part G2  means that it was wound round the breast beam as is done on hand and  power looms of the present day. Some very long pieces of cloth have  come down to us and unless they were \"taken up\" in this way a long  stretch of ground would have been necessary. A modified form of this  horizontal loom has been met with in recent years among the Bedawin  Arabs, as shown in the illustration of a study sketch, Fig. 12, made  by Frank Goodall, R.A., in the forties of last century. The loom was  provided with pegs like the old Egyptian loom but it was supplied with  a primitive heddle resting on a stone at each side of the warp and it  would appear that the weaver, to a "]]]
