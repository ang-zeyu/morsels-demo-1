In the night, climbing up into the belfry, it began to play with, and  ring the bell. Immediately the whole place was in an uproar; some great  danger was apprehended. Many thought that the castle was on fire; others,  that an enemy had entered the bay, and the soldiers began actually to turn  out, when it was discovered that the baboon had occasioned the  disturbance. On the following morning a court-martial was held, when Cape  justice dictated, that whereas the baboon had unnecessarily put the castle  into alarm, the master should receive fifty lashes; the soldier, however,  found means to evade the punishment.    [Illustration]          ANECDOTE VI.    Sagacious Bruin.      The captain of a Greenland whaler being anxious to procure a bear, without  wounding the skin, made trial of the stratagem of laying the noose of a  rope in the snow, and placing a piece of meat within it. A bear ranging  the neighbouring ice was soon enticed to the spot by the smell of the  dainty morsel. He perceived the bait, approached, and seized it in his  mouth; but his foot at the same time, by a jerk of the rope, being  entangled in the noose, he pushed it off with his paw, and deliberately  retired. After having eaten the piece he had carried away with him, he  returned. The noose, with another piece of meat, being replaced, he pushed  the rope aside, and again walked triumphantly off with his capture. A  third time the noose was laid; but excited to caution by the evident  observations of the bear, the sailors buried the rope beneath the snow,  and laid the bait in a deep hole dug in the centre. The bear once more  approached, and the sailors were assured of their success. But bruin, more  sagacious than they expected, after snuffing about the place for a few  moments, scraped the snow away with his paw, threw the rope aside, and  again escaped unhurt with his prize.    [Illustration]          ANECDOTE VII.    A Strange Mouser.      A gentleman once had in his possession a hen, which answered the purpose  of a cat in destroying mice. She was constantly seen watching close to a  corn rick, and the moment a mouse appeared, she seized it in her beak, and  carried it to a meadow adjoining, where she would play with it like a  young cat for some time, and then kill it. She has been known to catch  four or five mice a day in this manner.    [Illustration]          ANECDOTE VIII.    Making Sure.      During the war between Augustus Caesar and Marc Antony, when all the world  stood wondering and uncertain which way Fortune would incline herself, a  poor man at Rome, in order to be prepared for making, in either event, a  bold hit for his own advancement, had recourse to the following ingenious  expedient. He applied himself to the training of two crows with such  diligence, that he brought them the length of pronouncing with great  distinctness, the one a salutation to Caesar, and the other a salutation to  Antony. When Augustus returned conqueror, the man went out to meet him  with the crow suited to the occasion perched on his fist, and every now  and then it kept exclaiming, \"_Salve, Caesar, Victor Imperator!_\" \"Hail,  Caesar, Conqueror and Emperor!\" Augustus, greatly struck and delighted with  so novel a circumstance, purchased the bird of the man for a sum which  immediately raised him into opulence.    [Illustration]          ANECDOTE IX.    The Power of Music.      One Sunday evening, five choristers were walking on the banks of a river;  after some time, being tired with walking, they sat down on the grass, and  began to sing an anthem. The field on which they sat was terminated at one  extremity by a wood, out of which, as they were singing, they observed a  hare to pass with great swiftness towards the place where they were  sitting, and to stop at about twenty yards' distance from them. She  appeared highly delighted with the harmony of the music, often turning up  the side of her head to listen with more facility. As soon as the  harmonious sound was over, the hare returned slowly towards the wood; when  she had nearly reached the end of the field, the choristers began the same  piece again; at which the hare stopped, turned round, and came swiftly  back to about the same distance as before, where she seemed to listen with  rapture and delight, till they had finished the anthem, when she returned  again by a slow pace up the field, and entered the wood.    [Illustration]          ANECDOTE X.    A Conversing Parrot.      During the government of Prince Maurice in Brazil, he had heard of an old  parrot that was much celebrated for answering like a rational creature  many of the common questions put to it. It was at a great distance; but so  much had been said about it that the prince's curiosity was roused, and he  directed it to be sent for. When it was introduced into the room where the  prince was sitting, in company with several Dutchmen, it immediately  exclaimed in the Brazilian language, \"What a company of white men are  here!\" They asked it, \"Who is that man?\" (pointing to the prince). The  parrot answered, \"Some general or other.\" When the attendants carried it  up to him, he asked it, through the medium of an interpreter (for he was  ignorant of its language), \"Whence do you come?\" The parrot answered,  \"From Marignan.\" The prince asked, \"To whom do you belong?\" It answered,  \"To a Portuguese.\" He asked again, \"What do you there?\" It answered, \"I  look after chickens.\" The prince laughing, exclaimed, \"You look after  chickens!\" The parrot in answer said, \"Yes, I; and I know well enough how  to do it;\" clucking at the same time in imitation of the noise made by the  hen to call together her young.    The prince afterwards observed that although the parrot spoke in a  language he did not understand, yet he could not be deceived, for he had  in the room both a Dutchman who spoke Brazilian, and a Brazilian who spoke  Dutch; that he asked them separately and privately, and both agreed  exactly in their account of the parrot's discourse.    [Illustration]          ANECDOTE XI.    Mimic.      A priest once brought up an ourang-outang, which became so fond of him  that, wherever he went, it was always desirous of accompanying him.  Whenever therefore he had to perform the service of his church, he was  under the necessity of shutting it up in his room. Once, however, the  animal escaped, and followed the father to the church; where silently  mounting the sounding-board above the pulpit, he lay perfectly still till  the sermon commenced. He then crept to the edge, and overlooking the  preacher, imitated all his gestures in so grotesque a manner, that the  whole congregation were unavoidably urged to laugh. The father, surprised  and confounded at this ill-timed levity, severely rebuked his audience for  their inattention. The reproof failed in its effect; the congregation  still laughed, and the preacher in the warmth of his zeal redoubled his  vociferation and his action; these the ape imitated so exactly that the  congregation could no longer restrain themselves, but burst out into a  loud and continued laughter. A friend of the preacher at length stepped up  to him, and pointed out the cause of this improper conduct; and such was  the arch demeanour of the animal that it was with the utmost difficulty he  could himself command his gravity, while he ordered the servants of the  church to take him away.    [Illustration]          ANECDOTE XII.    The Heroism of a Hen.      A contest of rather an unusual nature took place in the house of a  respectable innkeeper in Ireland. The parties concerned were, a hen of the  game species, and a rat of the middle size. The hen, in an accidental  perambulation round a spacious room, accompanied by an only chicken, the  sole surviving offspring of a numerous brood, was roused to madness by an  unprovoked attack made by a voracious cowardly rat on her unsuspecting  chirping companion. The shrieks of the beloved captive, while being  dragged away by the enemy, excited every maternal feeling in the  affectionate bosom of the feathered dame; she flew at the corner whence  the alarm arose, seized the lurking enemy by the neck, writhed him about  the room, put out one of his eyes in the engagement, and so fatigued her  opponent by repeated attacks of spur and bill, that in the space of twelve  minutes, during which time the conflict lasted, she put a final period to  the nocturnal invader's existence; nimbly turned round, in wild but  triumphant distraction, to her palpitating nestling, and hugged it in her  victorious bosom.    [Illustration]          ANECDOTE XIII.    The Cat and Crows.      A pair of crows once made their nest in a tree, of which there were  several planted round the garden of a gentleman, who, in his morning  walks, was often amused by witnessing furious combats between the crows  and a cat. One morning the battle raged more fiercely than usual, till at  last the cat gave way, and took shelter under a hedge, as if to wait a  more favourable opportunity of retreating into the house. The crows  continued for a short time to make a threatening noise; but perceiving  that on the ground they could do nothing more than threaten, one of them  lifted a stone from the middle of the garden, and perched with it on a  tree planted in the hedge, where she sat, watching the motions of the  enemy of her young. As the cat crept along under the hedge, the crow  accompanied her, flying from branch to branch, and from tree to tree; and  when at last puss ventured to quit her hiding-place, the crow, leaving the  trees and hovering over her in the air, let the stone drop from on high on  her back.    [Illustration]          ANECDOTE XIV.    Filial Duty.      A surgeon's mate on board a ship relates that while lying one evening  awake he saw a rat come into his berth, and after well surveying the  place, retreat with the"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/2434"],[0,"New Atlantis (#2)"],[1,"State for his service.  For (as I after  learned) they call an officer that taketh rewards, \"twice paid.\"    The next morning early, there came to us the same officer that came to  us at first with his cane, and told us, He came to conduct us to the  Strangers' House; and that he had prevented the hour, because we might  have the whole day before us, for our business.  \"For,\" said he, \"if  you will follow my advice, there shall first go with me some few of  you, and see the place, and how it may be made convenient for you; and  then you may send for your sick, and the rest of your number, which ye  will bring on land.\"  We thanked him, and said, \"That this care, which  he took of desolate strangers, God would reward.\"  And so six of us  went on land with him: and when we were on land, he went before us, and  turned to us, and said, \"He was but our servant, and our guide.\" He led  us through three fair streets; and all the way we went, there were  gathered some people on both sides, standing in a row; but in so civil  a fashion, as if it had been, not to wonder at us, but to welcome us:  and divers of them, as we passed by them, put their arms a little  abroad; which is their gesture, when they did bid any welcome.    The Strangers' House is a fair and spacious house, built of brick, of  somewhat a bluer colour than our brick; and with handsome windows, some  of glass, some of a kind of cambric oiled.  He brought us first into a  fair parlour above stairs, and then asked us, \"What number of persons  we were?  And how many sick?\"  We answered, \"We were in all, (sick and  whole,) one and fifty persons, whereof our sick were seventeen.\"  He  desired us to have patience a little, and to stay till he came back to  us; which was about an hour after; and then he led us to see the  chambers which were provided for us, being in number nineteen: they  having cast it (as it seemeth) that four of those chambers, which were  better than the rest, might receive four of the principal men of our  company; and lodge them alone by themselves; and the other fifteen  chambers were to lodge us two and two together.  The chambers were  handsome and cheerful chambers, and furnished civilly. Then he led us  to a long gallery, like a dorture, where he showed us all along the one  side (for the other side was but wall and window), seventeen cells,  very neat ones, having partitions of cedar wood. Which gallery and  cells, being in all forty, many more than we needed, were instituted as  an infirmary for sick persons.  And he told us withal, that as any of  our sick waxed well, he might be removed from his cell, to a chamber;  for which purpose there were set forth ten spare chambers, besides the  number we spake of before.  This done, he brought us back to the  parlour, and lifting up his cane a little, (as they do when they give  any charge or command) said to us, \"Ye are to know, that the custom of  the land requireth, that after this day and to-morrow, (which we give  you for removing of your people from your ship,) you are to keep within  doors for three days.  But let it not trouble you, nor do not think  yourselves restrained, but rather left to your rest and ease.  You  shall want nothing, and there are six of our people appointed to attend  you, for any business you may have abroad.\"  We gave him thanks, with  all affection and respect, and said, \"God surely is manifested in this  land.\"  We offered him also twenty pistolets; but he smiled, and only  said; \"What? twice paid!\"  And so he left us.    Soon after our dinner was served in; which was right good viands, both  for bread and treat: better than any collegiate diet, that I have known  in Europe.  We had also drink of three sorts, all wholesome and good;  wine of the grape; a drink of grain, such as is with us our ale, but  more clear: And a kind of cider made of a fruit of that country; a  wonderful pleasing and refreshing drink.  Besides, there were brought  in to us, great store of those scarlet oranges, for our sick; which  (they said) were an assured remedy for sickness taken at sea.  There  was given us also, a box of small gray, or whitish pills, which they  wished our sick should take, one of the pills, every night before  sleep; which (they said) would hasten their recovery.    The next day, after that our trouble of carriage and removing of our  men and goods out of our ship, was somewhat settled and quiet, I  thought good to call our company together; and when they were  assembled, said unto them; \"My dear friends, let us know ourselves, and  how it standeth with us.  We are men cast on land, as Jonas was, out of  the whale's belly, when we were as buried in the deep: and now we are  on land, we are but between death and life; for we are beyond, both the  old world, and the new; and whether ever we shall see Europe, God only  knoweth.  It is a kind of miracle bath brought us hither: and it must  be little less, that shall bring us hence.  Therefore in regard of our  deliverance past, and our danger present, and to come, let us look up  to God, and every man reform his own ways.  Besides we are come here  amongst a Christian people, full of piety and humanity: let us not  bring that confusion of face upon ourselves, as to show our vices, or  unworthiness before them.  Yet there is more.  For they have by  commandment, (though in form of courtesy) cloistered us within these  wall, for three days: who knoweth, whether it be not, to take some  taste of our manners and conditions?  And if they find them bad, to  banish us straightways; if good, to give us further time.  For these  men that they have given us for attendance, may withal have an eye upon  us.  Therefore for God's love, and as we love the weal of our souls and  bodies, let us so behave ourselves, as we may be at peace with God, and  may find grace in the eyes of this people.\"  Our company with one voice  thanked me for my good admonition, and promised me to live soberly and  civilly, and without giving any the least occasion of offence.  So we  spent our three days joyfully, and without care, in expectation what  would be done with us, when they were expired. During which time, we  had every hour joy of the amendment of our sick; who thought themselves  cast into some divine pool of healing; they mended so kindly, and so  fast.    The morrow after our three days were past, there came to us a new man,  that we had not seen before, clothed in blue as the former was, save  that his turban was white, with a small red cross on the top.  He had  also a tippet of fine linen.  At his coming in, he did bend to us a  little, and put his arms abroad.  We of our parts saluted him in a very  lowly and submissive manner; as looking that from him, we should  receive sentence of life, or death: he desired to speak with some few  of us: whereupon six of us only staid, and the rest avoided the room.  He said, \"I am by office governor of this House of Strangers, and by  vocation I am a Christian priest: and therefore am come to you to offer  you my service, both as strangers and chiefly as Christians. Some  things I may tell you, which I think you will not be unwilling to hear.  The State hath given you license to stay on land, for the space of six  weeks; and let it not trouble you, if your occasions ask further time,  for the law in this point is not precise; and I do not doubt, but my  self shall be able, to obtain for you such further time, as may be  convenient.  Ye shall also understand, that the Strangers' House is at  this time rich, and much aforehand; for it hath laid up revenue these  thirty-seven years; for so long it is since any stranger arrived in  this part: and therefore take ye no care; the State will defray you all  the time you stay; neither shall you stay one day the less for that.  As for any merchandise ye have brought, ye shall be well used, and have  your return, either in merchandise, or in gold and silver: for to us it  is all one.  And if you have any other request to make, hide it not.  For ye shall find we will not make your countenance to fall by the  answer ye shall receive.  Only this I must tell you, that none of you  must go above a karan,\" (that is with them a mile and an half) \"from  the walls of the city, without especial leave.\"    We answered, after we had looked awhile one upon another, admiring this  gracious and parent-like usage; \"That we could not tell what to say:  for we wanted words to express our thanks; and his noble free offers  left us nothing to ask.  It seemed to us, that we had before us a  picture of our salvation in Heaven; for we that were a while since in  the jaws of death, were now brought into a place, where we found  nothing but consolations.  For the commandment laid upon us, we would  not fail to obey it, though it was impossible but our hearts should be  enflamed to tread further upon this happy and holy ground.\"  We added,  \"That our tongues should first cleave to the roofs of our mouths, ere  we should forget, either his reverend person, or this whole nation, in  our prayers.\"  We also most humbly besought him, to accept of us as his  true servants; by as just a right as ever men on earth were bounden;  laying and presenting, both our persons, and all we had, at his feet.  He said; \"He was a priest, and looked for a priest's reward; which was  our brotherly love, and the good of our souls and bodies.\" So he went  from us, not without tears of tenderness in his eyes; and left us also  confused with joy and kindness, saying amongst ourselves; \"That we were  come into a land of angels, which did appear to us daily, and prevent  us with comforts, which we thought not of, much less expected.\"    The next day about ten of the clock, the Governor came to us again, and  after salutations, said familiarly; \"That he was come to visit us;\" and  called for a chair, and sat him down: and we, being some ten of us,  (the rest were of the meaner sort, or else gone"]]]
