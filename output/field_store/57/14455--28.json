The longevity of the Eagle is very great, from 80 to 160 years.          THE SEMI-PALMATED RING PLOVER.      In their habits the Plovers are usually active; they run and fly with  equal facility, and though they rarely attempt to swim, are not  altogether unsuccessful in that particular.    The Semi-palmated Ring Plover utters a plaintive whistle, and during the  nesting season can produce a few connected pleasing notes. The three or  four pear-shaped, variagated eggs are deposited in a slight hollow in  the ground, in which a few blades of grass are occasionally placed. Both  parents assist in rearing the young. Worms, small quadrupeds, and  insects constitute their food. Their flesh is regarded as a delicacy,  and they are therefore objects of great attraction to the sportsman,  although they often render themselves extremely troublesome by uttering  their shrill cry and thus warning their feathered companions of the  approach of danger. From this habit they have received the name of  \"tell-tales.\" Dr. Livingstone said of the African species: \"A most  plaguey sort of public spirited individual follows you everywhere,  flying overhead, and is most persevering in his attempts to give fair  warning to all animals within hearing to flee from the approach of  danger.\"    The American Ring Plover nests as far north as Labrador, and is common  on our shores from August to October, after which it migrates southward.  Some are stationary in the southern states. It is often called the Ring  Plover, and has been supposed to be identical with the European Ringed  Plover.    It is one of the commonest of shore birds. It is found along the beaches  and easily identified by the complete neck ring, white upon dark and  dark upon light. Like the Sandpipers the Plovers dance along the shore  in rhythm with the wavelets, leaving sharp half-webbed footprints on the  wet sand. Though usually found along the seashore, Samuels says that on  their arrival in spring, small flocks follow the courses of large  rivers, like the Connecticut. He also found a single pair building on  Muskeget, the famous haunt of Gulls, off the shore of Massachusetts. It  has been found near Chicago, Illinois, in July.           [Illustration: RING PLOVER.]    THE RING PLOVER.      Plovers belong to a class of birds called Waders.    They spend the winters down south, and early in the spring begin their  journey north. By the beginning of summer they are in the cold north,  where they lay their eggs and hatch their young. Here they remain until  about the month of August, when they begin to journey southward. It is  on their way back that we see most of them.    While on their way north, they are in a hurry to reach their nesting  places, so only stop here and there for food and rest.    Coming back with their families, we often see them in ploughed fields.  Here they find insects and seeds to eat.    The Ring Plover is so called from the white ring around its neck.    These birds are not particular about their nests. They do not build  comfortable nests as most birds do. They find a place that is sheltered  from the north winds, and where the sun will reach them. Here they make  a rude nest of the mosses lying around.    The eggs are somewhat pointed, and placed in the nest with the points  toward the center. In this way the bird can more easily cover the eggs.    We find, among most birds, that after the nest is made, the mother bird  thinks it her duty to hatch the young.    The father bird usually feeds her while she sits on the eggs. In some of  the bird stories, you have read how the father and mother birds take  turns in building the nest, sitting on the nest, and feeding the young.    Some father birds do all the work in building the nest, and take care of  the birds when hatched.    Among plovers, the father bird usually hatches the young, and lets the  wife do as she pleases.    After the young are hatched they help each other take care of them.    Plovers have long wings, and can fly very swiftly.    The distance between their summer and winter homes is sometimes very  great.          THE MALLARD DUCK.      We should probably think this the most beautiful of ducks, were the Wood  Duck not around.    His rich glossy-green head and neck, snowy white collar, and curly  feathers of the tail are surely marks of beauty.    But Mr. Mallard is not so richly dressed all of the year. Like a great  many other birds, he changes his clothes after the holiday season is  over. When he does this, you can hardly tell him from his mate who wears  a sober dress all the year.    Most birds that change their plumage wear their bright, beautiful dress  during the summer. Not so with Mr. Mallard. He wears his holiday clothes  during the winter. In the summer he looks much like his mate.    Usually the Mallard family have six to ten eggs in their nest. They are  of a pale greenish color--very much like the eggs of our tame ducks that  we see about the barnyards.    Those who have studied birds say that our tame ducks are descendants of  the Mallards.    If you were to hear the Mallard's _quack_, you could not tell it from  that of the domestic duck.    The Mallard usually makes her nest of grass, and lines it with down from  her breast. You will almost always find it on the ground, near the  water, and well sheltered by weeds and tall grasses.    It isn't often you see a duck with so small a family. It must be that  some of the ducklings are away picking up food.    Do you think they look like young chickens?     [Illustration: From col. Chi. Acad. Sciences.                  MALLARD DUCK.]          THE MALLARD DUCK.      The Mallard Duck is generally distributed in North America, migrating  south in winter to Panama, Cuba, and the Bahamas. In summer the full  grown male resembles the female, being merely somewhat darker in color.  The plumage is donned by degrees in early June, and in August the full  rich winter dress is again resumed. The adult males in winter plumage  vary chiefly in the extent and richness of the chestnut of the breast.    The Mallard is probably the best known of all our wild ducks, being very  plentiful and remarkable on account of its size. Chiefly migrant, a few  sometimes remain in the southern portion of Illinois, and a few pairs  sometimes breed in the more secluded localities where they are free from  disturbance. Its favorite resorts are margins of ponds and streams,  pools and ditches. It is an easy walker, and can run with a good deal of  speed, or dive if forced to do so, though it never dives for food. It  feeds on seeds of grasses, fibrous roots of plants, worms, shell fish,  and insects. In feeding in shallow water the bird keeps the hind part of  its body erect, while it searches the muddy bottom with its bill. When  alarmed and made to fly, it utters a loud quack, the cry of the female  being the louder. \"It feeds silently, but after hunger is satisfied, it  amuses itself with various jabberings, swims about, moves its head  backward and forward, throws water over its back, shoots along the  surface, half flying, half running, and seems quite playful. If alarmed,  the Mallard springs up at once with a bound, rises obliquely to a  considerable height, and flies off with great speed, the wings producing  a whistling sound. The flight is made by repeated flaps, without  sailing, and when in full flight its speed is hardly less than a hundred  miles an hour.\"    Early in spring the male and female seek a nesting place, building on  the ground, in marshes or among water plants, sometimes on higher  ground, but never far from water. The nest is large and rudely made of  sedges and coarse grasses, seldom lined with down or feathers. In rare  instances it nests in trees, using the deserted nests of hawks, crows,  or other large birds. Six or eight eggs of pale dull green are hatched,  and the young are covered over with down. When the female leaves the  nest she conceals the eggs with hay, down, or any convenient material.  As soon as hatched the chicks follow the mother to the water, where  she attends them devotedly, aids them in procuring food, and warns  them of danger. While they are attempting to escape, she feigns  lameness to attract to herself the attention of the enemy. The chicks  are wonderfully active little fellows, dive quickly, and remain under  water with only the bill above the surface.    On a lovely morning, before the sun has fairly indicated his returning  presence, there can be no finer sight than the hurrying pinions, or  inspiring note than the squawk, oft repeated, of these handsome  feathered creatures, as they seek their morning meal in the lagoons  and marshes.          THE AMERICAN AVOCET.      White Snipe, Yelper, Lawyer, and Scooper are some of the popular  names applied in various localities to this remarkably long-legged and  long and slender-necked creature, which is to be found in temperate  North America, and, in winter, as far south as Cuba and Jamaica. In  north-eastern Illinois the Avocet generally occurs in small parties the  last of April and the first of May, and during September and the early  part of October, when it frequents the borders of marshy pools. The  bird combines the characteristics of the Curlew and the Godwit, the bill  being recurved.    The cinnamon color on the head and neck of this bird varies with the  individual; sometimes it is dusky gray around the eye, especially in the  younger birds.    The Avocet is interesting and attractive in appearance, without having  any especially notable characteristics. He comes and goes and is rarely  seen by others than sportsmen.

CHAPTER I.    GENERAL REMARKS.      1. ANATOMY is the science which treats of the structure and relations  of the different parts of animals and plants.    2. It is divided into _Vegetable_ and _Animal_ anatomy. The latter of  these divisions is subdivided into _Human_ anatomy, which considers,  exclusively, human beings; and _Comparative_ anatomy, which treats of  the mechanism of the lower orders of animals.    3. PHYSIOLOGY treats of the functions, or uses of the organs of  animals and plants. Another definition is, \"the science of life.\"    4. This is also divided into _Vegetable_ and _Animal_ physiology, as  it treats of the vegetable or animal kingdom; and into _Human_ and  _Comparative_ physiology, as it describes the vital functions of man  or the inferior animals.    5. HYGIENE is the art or science of maintaining health, or a knowledge  of those laws by which health may be preserved.    6. The kingdom of nature is divided into _organic_ and _inorganic_  bodies. Organic bodies possess organs, on whose action depend their  growth and perfection. This division includes animals and plants.  Inorganic bodies are devoid of organs, or instruments of life. In this  division are classed the earths, metals, and other minerals.      -=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=    1. What is anatomy? 2. How is it divided? How is the latter division  subdivided? 3. What is physiology? Give another definition. 4. How is  physiology divided? Give a subdivision. 5. What is hygiene? 6. Define  organic bodies.      -=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=    7. In general, organic matter differs so materially from inorganic,  that the one can readily be distinguished from the other. In the  organic world, every individual of necessity springs from some  _parent, or immediate producing agent_; for while inorganic substances  are formed by chemical laws alone, we see no case of an animal or  plant coming into existence by accident or chance, or chemical  operations.    8. Animals and plants _are supported by means of nourishment_, and die  without it. They also increase in size _by the addition of new  particles of matter to all parts of their substances_; while rocks and  minerals grow only by additions to their surfaces.    9. \"Organized bodies always present a combination of both solids and  fluids;--of solids, differing in character and properties, arranged  into organs, and these endowed with functional powers, and so  associated as to form of the whole a single system;--and of fluids,  contained in these organs, and holding such relation to the solids  that the existence, nature, and properties of both mutually and  necessarily depend on each other.\"    10. Another characteristic is, that organic substances have a _certain  order of parts_. For example, plants possess organs to gain  nourishment from the soil and atmosphere, and the power to give  strength and increase to all their parts. And animals need not only a  digesting and circulating apparatus, but organs for breathing, a  nervous system, &c.      -=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=    6. Define inorganic bodies. 7. What is said of the difference, in  general, between organic and inorganic bodies? 8. What of the growth  of organic and inorganic bodies? 9. What do organized bodies always  present? 10. Give another characteristic of organized substances.      -=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=    11. _Individuality_ is an important characteristic. For instance, a  large rock may be broken into a number of smaller pieces, and yet  every fragment will be rock; but if an organic substance be separated  into two or more divisions, neither of them can be considered an  individual. Closely associated with this is the power of _life_, or  _vitality_, which is the most distinguishing characteristic of organic  structure; since we find nothing similar to this in the inorganic  creation.    12. _The distinction between plants and animals_ is also of much  importance. _Animals grow proportionally in all directions_, while  plants grow upwards and downwards from a collet only. The _food_ of  animals is _organic_, while that of plants is _inorganic_; the latter  feeding entirely upon the elements of the soil and atmosphere, while  the former subsist upon the products of the animal and vegetable  kingdoms. The size of the vegetable is in most cases limited only by  the duration of existence, as a tree continues to put forth new  branches during each period of its life, while the animal, at a  certain time of life, attains the average size of its species.    13. One of the most important distinctions between animals and plants,  is _the different effects of respiration_. Animals consume the oxygen  of the atmosphere, and give off carbonic acid; while plants take up  the carbonic acid, and restore to animals the oxygen, thus affording  an admirable example of the principle of compensation in nature.    14. But the decisive distinctions between animals and plants are  _sensation_ and _voluntary motion_, the power of acquiring a knowledge  of external objects through the senses, and the ability to move from  place to place at will. These are the characteristics which, in their  fullest development in man, show intellect and reasoning powers, and  thereby in a greater degree exhibit to us the wisdom and goodness of  the Creator.      -=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=    11.
