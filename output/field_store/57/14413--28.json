INTRODUCTION.    The object of this work is not to describe all the many races of animals  which have been domesticated by man, and of the plants which have been  cultivated by him; even if I possessed the requisite knowledge, so gigantic  an undertaking would be here superfluous. It is my intention to give under  the head of each species only such facts as I have been able to collect or  observe, showing the amount and nature of the changes which animals and  plants have undergone whilst under man's dominion, or which bear on the  general principles of variation. In one case alone, namely in that of the  domestic pigeon, I will describe fully all the chief races, their history,  the amount and nature of their differences, and the probable steps by which  they have been formed. I have selected this case, because, as we shall  hereafter see, the materials are better than in any other; and one case  fully described will in fact illustrate all others. But I shall also  describe domesticated rabbits, fowls, and ducks, with considerable fulness.    The subjects discussed in this volume are so connected that it is not a  little difficult to decide how they can be best arranged. I have determined  in the first part to give, under the heads of the various animals and  plants, a large body of facts, some of which may at first appear but little  related to our subject, and to devote the latter part to general  discussions. Whenever I have found it necessary to give numerous details,  in support of any proposition or conclusion, small type has been used.  (Here shown with [].) The reader will, I think, find this plan a  convenience, for, if he does not doubt the conclusion or care about the  details, he can easily pass them over; yet I may be permitted to say that  some of the discussions thus printed deserve attention, at least from the  professed naturalist.    It may be useful to those who have read nothing about Natural Selection, if  I here give a brief sketch of the whole subject and of its bearing on the  origin of species. (Introduction/1. To any one who has attentively read my  'Origin of Species' this Introduction will be superfluous. As I stated in  that work that I should soon publish the facts on which the conclusions  given in it were founded, I here beg permission to remark that the great  delay in publishing this first work has been caused by continued ill-  health.) This is the more desirable, as it is impossible in the present  work to avoid many allusions to questions which will be fully discussed in  future volumes.    From a remote period, in all parts of the world, man has subjected many  animals and plants to domestication or culture. Man has no power of  altering the absolute conditions of life; he cannot change the climate of  any country; he adds no new element to the soil; but he can remove an  animal or"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/28710"],[0,"The Christian Foundation, Or, Scientific and Religious Journal, Volume 1, Index, (#2)"],[1,"from the original text have been faithfully  preserved.
