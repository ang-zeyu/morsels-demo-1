[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/3163"],[0,"Birds and Bees, Sharp Eyes, and Other Papers (#2)"],[1,"reading, I have selected  for future use. I have found in them few pages so hard as to require  over much study, or a too frequent use of the dictionary. John  Burroughs, more than almost any other writer of the time, has a  prevailing taste for simple words and simple constructions. \"He that  runs may read\" him. I have found many children under eleven years of age  who could read a whole page without hesitating. If I discover some words  which I foresee will cause difficulty, I place such on the blackboard  and rapidly pronounce and explain them before the reading. Generally,  however, I find the text the best interpreter of its words. What follows  explains what goes before, if the child is led to read on to the end of  the sentence. It is a mistake to allow children to be frightened away  from choice reading by an occasional hard word. There is no better time  than his reading lesson in which to teach a child that the hard things  of life are to be grappled with and overcome. A mistake also, I think,  is that toilsome process of explanation which I sometimes find teachers  following, under the impression that it will be \"parrot work\" (as the  stock phrase of the \"institutes\" has it) for the pupils to read anything  which they do not clearly and fully comprehend. Teachers' definitions,  in such cases, I have often noticed, are no better than dictionary  definitions, and surely everybody knows that few more fruitless things  than dictionary definitions are ever crammed into the memory of a child.  Better far give free play to the native intelligence of the child, and  trust it to apprehend, though it may not yet comprehend nor be able to  express its apprehension in definition. On this subject I am glad to  quote so high an authority as Sir Walter Scott: \"Indeed I rather suspect  that children derive impulses of a powerful and important kind from  reading things which they do not comprehend, and therefore that to write  down to children's understanding is a mistake. Set them on the scent and  let them puzzle it out.\"    From time to time I have allowed my pupils to give me written  reports from memory of these essays, and have often found these little  compositions sparkling with pleasing information, or full of that  childlike fun which is characteristic of the author. I have marked the  errors in these exercises, and have given them back to the children  to rewrite. Sometimes the second papers show careful correction-and  sometimes the mistakes are partially neglected. Very often the child  wishes to improve on the first composition, and so adds new blunders as  well as creates new interest.    There is a law of self-preservation in Nature, which takes care of  mistakes. Every human soul reaches toward the light in the most direct  path open to it, and will correct its own errors as soon as it is  developed far enough. There is no use in trying to force maturity;  teachers who trouble children beyond all reason, and worry over their  mistakes, are fumbling at the roots of young plants that will grow if  they are let alone long enough.    The average mechanical work (spelling, construction of sentences,  writing, etc.) is better under this method than when more time is  devoted to the mechanics and less to the thought of composition. I have  seen many reports of Burroughs's essays from the pens of children more  pleasing and reliable than the essays of some professional reviewers;  in these papers I often find the children adding little suggestions of  their own; as, \"Do birds dream?\" One of the girls says her bird \"jumps  in its sleep.\" A little ten year old writes, \"Weeds are unuseful  flowers,\" and, \"I like this book because there are real things in it.\"  Another thinks she \"will look more carefully\" if she ever gets out into  the country again. For the development of close observation and good  feeling toward the common things of life, I know of no writings better  than those of John Burroughs.      MARY E. BURT    JONES SCHOOL, CHICAGO, Sept. 1, 1887.          BIRDS.          BIRD ENEMIES.      How surely the birds know their enemies! See how the wrens and robins  and bluebirds pursue and scold the cat, while they take little or no  notice of the dog! Even the swallow will fight the cat, and, relying too  confidently upon its powers of flight, sometimes swoops down so near  to its enemy that it is caught by a sudden stroke of the cat's paw. The  only case I know of in which our small birds fail to recognize their  enemy is furnished by the shrike; apparently the little birds do not  know that this modest-colored bird is an assassin. At least, I have  never seen them scold or molest him, or utter any outcries at his  presence, as they usually do at birds of prey. Probably it is because  the shrike is a rare visitant, and is not found in this part of the  country during the nesting season of our songsters.    But the birds have nearly all found out the trick the jay, and when he  comes sneaking through the trees in May and June in quest of eggs, he  is quickly exposed and roundly abused. It is amusing to see the robins  hustle him out of the tree which holds their nest. They cry \"Thief,  thief!\" to the top of their voices as they charge upon him, and the jay  retorts in a voice scarcely less complimentary as he makes off.    The jays have their enemies also, and need to keep an eye on their own  eggs. It would be interesting to know if jays ever rob jays, or crows  plunder crows; or is there honor among thieves even in the feathered  tribes? I suspect the jay is often punished by birds which are otherwise  innocent of nest-robbing. One season I found a jay's nest in a small  cedar on the side of a wooded ridge. It held five eggs, every one of  which had been punctured. Apparently some bird had driven its sharp beak  through their shells, with the sole intention of destroying them, for no  part of the contents of the eggs had been removed. It looked like a case  of revenge; as if some thrush or warbler, whose nest had suffered at  the hands of the jays, had watched its opportunity, and had in this way  retaliated upon its enemies. An egg for an egg. The jays were lingering  near, very demure and silent, and probably ready to join a crusade  against nest-robbers.    The great bugaboo of the birds is the owl. The owl snatches them from  off their roosts at night, and gobbles up their eggs and young in their  nests. He is a veritable ogre to them, and his presence fills them with  consternation and alarm.    One season, to protect my early cherries I placed a large stuffed owl  amid the branches of the tree. Such a racket as there instantly began  about my grounds is not pleasant to think upon! The orioles and robins  fairly \"shrieked out their affright.\" The news instantly spread in every  direction, and apparently every bird in town came to see that owl in  the cherry-tree, and every bird took a cherry, so that I lost more fruit  than if I had left the owl in-doors. With craning necks and horrified  looks the birds alighted upon the branches, and between their screams  would snatch off a cherry, as if the act was some relief to their  outraged feelings.    The chirp and chatter of the young of birds which build in concealed or  inclosed places, like the woodpeckers, the house wren, the high-hole,  the oriole, is in marked contrast to the silence of the fledglings  of most birds that build open and exposed nests. The young of the  sparrows,--unless the social sparrow be an exception,--warblers,  fly-catchers, thrushes, never allow a sound to escape them; and on  the alarm note of their parents being heard, sit especially close  and motionless, while the young of chimney swallows, woodpeckers, and  orioles are very noisy. The latter, in its deep pouch, is quite safe  from birds of prey, except perhaps the owl. The owl, I suspect, thrusts  its leg into the cavities of woodpeckers and into the pocket-like nest  of the oriole, and clutches and brings forth the birds in its talons.  In one case which I heard of, a screech-owl had thrust its claw into a  cavity in a tree, and grasped the head of a red-headed woodpecker; being  apparently unable to draw its prey forth, it had thrust its own round  head into the hole, and in some way became fixed there, and had thus  died with the woodpecker in its talons.    The life of birds is beset with dangers and mishaps of which we know  little. One day, in my walk, I came upon a goldfinch with the tip of one  wing securely fastened to the feathers of its rump, by what appeared  to be the silk of some caterpillar. The bird, though uninjured, was  completely crippled, and could not fly a stroke. Its little body was hot  and panting in my hands, as I carefully broke the fetter. Then it  darted swiftly away with a happy cry. A record of all the accidents  and tragedies of bird life for a single season would show many curious  incidents. A friend of mine opened his box-stove one fall to kindle a  fire in it, when he beheld in the black interior the desiccated forms of  two bluebirds. The birds had probably taken refuge in the chimney during  some cold spring storm, and had come down the pipe to the stove, from  whence they were unable to ascend. A peculiarly touching little incident  of bird life occurred to a caged female canary. Though unmated, it laid  some eggs, and the happy bird was so carried away by her feelings that  she would offer food to the eggs, and chatter and twitter, trying, as it  seemed, to encourage them to eat! The incident is hardly tragic, neither  is it comic.    Certain birds nest in the vicinity of our houses and outbuildings, or  even in and upon them, for protection from their enemies, but they often  thus expose themselves to a plague of the most deadly character.    I refer to the vermin with which their nests often swarm, and which kill  the young before they are fledged. In a state of nature this probably  never happens; at least I have"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/31630"],[0,"Hand-Loom Weaving: A Manual for School and Home (#2)"],[1," arts, dates back so far that no  one can say when or where it had its beginning. We read in Genesis iii,  21, that when Adam was driven from the Garden of Eden he wore a coat of  skin; but, not long after, according to Professor Hurwitz, the  descendants of Adam wore an upper garment called the simla, which  consisted of a piece of cloth about six yards long and two or three  wide, greatly resembling a blanket (_Ashenhurst_). This might have been  woven from vegetable fibres, perhaps from wool, but in what manner we do  not know. The warp and woof of linen and woolen garments is mentioned in  Leviticus xiii, 47, 48.    [Sidenote: _Dyeing_]    Spinning and weaving have been practised by the Chinese, Hindoos, and  Egyptians for thousands of years and carried by them to great  proficiency. The Israelites were probably familiar with the art of  weaving before their sojourn in Egypt, but it was there that they  attained the skill which enabled them to execute the hangings in the  Tabernacle. Joseph's \"coat of many colors\" is a proof that dyeing  existed at a very early period, and the eloquent writings of Ezekiel  tell us of the beautiful colored cloths of Tyre and Damascus.    [Sidenote: _Migration of weaving_]    From the ancient world the art of weaving passed through Europe and  became known in England after the Roman conquest. No doubt primitive  weaving with vegetable fibres, and perhaps with wool, was known in a  very crude way before that time. How the art developed, and how  improvement followed improvement, makes very interesting reading for the  student of textile fabrics.    [Sidenote: _Weaving as the first industrial art_]    We know that weaving is the first industrial art practised by primitive  peoples, from the fact that it is found among the savages of Central  Africa (_Park_) and the islands of the sea. \"Clavigero, in his history  of Mexico, shows that on the conquest of that country, weaving was found  to be practised by the natives.\" (_Ashenhurst_.)    [Sidenote: _Egyptian loom_]    [Sidenote: _Method of pushing the woof_]    [Sidenote: _Hindoo loom_]    The Egyptians are supposed to have been inventors of the loom. There  were two kinds in use, one horizontal and the other perpendicular.  Instead of a shuttle they used a stick with a hook at one end, which was  used also as a batten. Herodotus says that it was the practice of the  Egyptians to push the woof downwards, and this method is pictured in  many paintings; but one representation found at Thebes shows a man  pushing it upwards. The former method is, I believe, the one generally  used by all nations, and it certainly seems the easier way. Martin's  description of a Hindoo loom in his \"Circle of the Mechanical Arts\" is  interesting: \"The loom consists merely of two bamboo rollers, one for  the warp and the other for the web, and a pair of gears. The shuttle  performs the double office of shuttle and batten, and for this purpose  is made like a huge netting needle, and of a length somewhat exceeding  the breadth of the cloth. This apparatus the weaver carries to a tree,  under which he digs a hole large enough to contain his legs and the  lower part of the gear. He then stretches his warp by fastening his  bamboo rollers, at a due distance from each other on the turf, by wooden  pins. The balance of the gear he fastens to some convenient branch of  the tree over his head. Two loops underneath the gear, in which he  inserts his great toes, serve instead of treadles, and his long  shuttle, which also performs the office of batten, draws the weft  through the warp, and afterwards strikes it up close to the web.\"    [Sidenote: _Crude implements used by primitive peoples_]    [Sidenote: _Patience and dexterity necessary_]    Ashenhurst says: \"It is very evident that the implements used, not only  by the early Egyptians, but by other contemporaneous nations, and even  by the Hindoos at the present time, were of the rudest possible  character, and nothing but the most exemplary patience, dexterity, and  great delicacy of hand, acquired by long traditionary habit, can account  for the extraordinary beauty and fineness of their textile productions.\"  This exemplary patience, dexterity, and great delicacy of hand is  exactly what we claim that weaving develops in our children to-day.    [Sidenote: _Primitive loom in the public schools_]    [Sidenote: _Its disadvantages_]    The primitive loom, as it is made for use in the public schools, is  familiar to almost every teacher. It consists of a wooden frame, in the  two ends of which are fastened brads at intervals of half an inch. The  warp is strung around these brads. There is no variation either in the  size of the rug or in the width of the warp to afford opportunity for  different materials. This is a decided objection, as a new frame has to  be made every time a change is desired. The first difficulty encountered  is the drawing in of the sides of the rug, which is almost impossible  to avoid, even with the utmost care. Photographs of work in the leading  educational magazines, as well as samples of teachers' work, all show  the same defect. The Indians obviate this difficulty by twisting two  stout cords in the edge of the woof during the process of weaving. (See  illustration on page 135.) In one school, where the work in this respect  was fairly well done, the teacher was asked how she accomplished the  result. Her reply was, \"Oh, I make them pull it out every time it  draws.\" Poor, patient little fingers! One can imagine the thoughts which  were woven into that imperfect rug by the discouraged little worker.  Another disadvantage of the primitive loom is that the child must bend  over it while weaving, and if, by chance, he turns it over to examine  the other side of the work, the brads are apt to leave an unsightly  impression on the desk.    [Sidenote: _Success in doing_]    One of Froebel's fundamental principles is that a child should never be  _allowed_ to fail--that his work should be so adapted that he will  succeed _every time_, and that he should be led step by step as his  power grows, to something more difficult.        \"One thing is forever good,      That one thing is success.\"    We have all experienced the joy of success in one way and another. Let  us help the children to have the same experience.    [Sidenote: _Idea of the \"new education\"_]    [Sidenote: _Small classes_]    [Sidenote: _Public school conditions_]    The idea of the \"new education\" is that the child should work out his  own salvation--that having wrestled with the difficulties involved in  weaving on the primitive loom, he should proceed not only to invent, but  to construct a newer and more improved loom. In model schools, where the  classes are limited to ten, or sometimes fewer children, with one  teacher and several assistants, this idea, if carried out, is ideal, and  perhaps practical. But what shall be said of the public-school teacher  who has fifty children and no assistants; or, which is even more  objectionable, and which is the case in many of our crowded schools,  what of the teacher with two sessions of fifty children each? It was the  effort to solve a problem of this kind that led to the invention of the  Todd adjustable hand loom.    [Sidenote: _Description of the Todd loom_]    [Illustration: _The Todd adjustable hand loom, Style b_]    [Sidenote: _The needle_]    [Sidenote: _Finishing the work_]    [Sidenote: _Removing the work_]    The full size of the loom is 10 x 13 inches, upon which a rug 9 x 12  inches can be woven. It is made adjustable to innumerable smaller square  and oblong sizes, by two devices. To regulate the length, the head  piece, which is movable, can be let down on brass buttons, which are  disposed along the sides at intervals of an inch. Perforations are  placed half an inch apart in the head and foot pieces so that the side  rods can be moved inward to regulate the width. They also insure  straight edges, since the woof threads are passed around them as the  work progresses. The rods also serve another important function as  fulcrums upon which the needle may be pressed up and down, so that it  passes more easily over and under the successive warp strings. The  notches are one-sixteenth inch and the teeth one-eighth inch apart,  giving opportunity for warp one-half, three-eighths, and  three-sixteenths inches wide. The loom has an easel support, so that the  pupil need not bend over it--an important consideration in school  classes, and in home work as well. This support makes it possible to use  the loom for an easel in the painting lessons, by resting a piece of  pasteboard against it. The needle, which is longer than the warp is  wide, serves also as a heddle in pressing the woof threads together  evenly. It is furnished with an eye for worsted, chenille, carpet  ravelings, or rope silk, and three slits for rags. To thread the needle  with rags, pass the strip up and down through the slits and _back_ again  _under_ the strip through the first slit. This binds the strip securely.  In finishing the work weave the last few woof threads with a large tape  needle, putting it up and down, over one thread at a time, as you would  sew on canvas. It has been found desirable with children to push about  an inch of woof threads close to the head piece and then fill in the  space. Care should be taken not to pull the woof too tight. If these  directions are followed and the warp is strung correctly the strings  will not slip out of the notches. In adjusting the loom it will be found  that the width from rod to rod is a little more than is required. For  instance, for a rug nine inches wide, the width from rod to rod will be  about nine and one-half inches. This is to allow for the springing  together when the work is finished. To remove it from the loom, pull the  rods gently upward and out. Then lift the warp strings out of the  notches.    [Illustration: _The Todd"]]]
