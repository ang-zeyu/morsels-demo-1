The openings for the internal  nares, the ventral orbital fenestrae, and the subtemporal fossae are  readily recognized. The quadrate processes extend posteriorly leaving a  large gap medially at the posterior end of the skull.    [Illustration: FIG. 4. _Hesperoherpeton garnettense_ Peabody. Palate  reconstructed; ventral aspect at left, showing teeth, dorsal aspect at  right. KU 10295, x 4.]    The left quadrate appears to be in place on the posterior prong of the  pterygoid. The dorsal side of the quadrate is grooved between two  anterolaterally directed ridges. The groove, which probably held the  end of the stapes, extends about half the width of the quadrate itself.  The width of the quadrate is 4.0 mm., the length is 4.5 mm. medially  and about 2.0 mm. laterally. In ventral view the quadrate appears to  project laterally, but is incomplete and its shape uncertain. The  distance from the posterior end of the quadrate to the visible  posterior edge of the orbital fenestra, which opens ventrally, is 10.0  mm.    This region between the quadrate and the orbit is occupied by a  pterygoid with three projections. Anteriorly, the pterygoid outlines  most of the posterior edge of the orbit (a distance of about 6.5 mm.).  A lateral process separates the orbit from the subtemporal fossa. A  posteriorly directed edge defines the fossa, which extends about 6.5  mm. anteroposteriorly. The lateral process of the pterygoid terminates  10.0 mm. from the midline. Both the lateral and posterior pterygoid  processes are approximately 2.0 mm. wide. The greatest width of the  subtemporal fossa is about 2.0 mm. The medial border of the orbital  fenestra is missing, but apparently consisted of the pterygoid for at  least the posterior half.    Along the posterior edge of the orbital fenestra, there is a narrow,  dorsally projecting flange of the pterygoid. The lateral opening of the  orbit is approximately 7.5 mm. wide.    The remaining border of the orbital fenestra on the anterior and medial  sides is formed by a bone occupying the position of palatine and vomer;  for convenience we designate this as palatine. When reconstructed in  its probable position in relation to the pterygoid, the left palatine  lacks a section, on its medial and posterior edges, measuring about 2.5  mm. by 9.0 mm. The lateral margin of the palatine is convex; about 5.5  mm. anterior to the orbit this margin curves into a strong anteriorly  pointing projection, medial to which is seen the internal narial  opening. The remaining anterior edge is slightly convex, smoothly  rounded, and meets the midline about 9.0 mm. anterior to the pterygoid.    The void area medial to the palatine and anterior to the pterygoid does  not fit any bone which we can recognize as the parasphenoid. It is thus  suspected that this area is covered in part by the missing edge of the  palatine and partly by an anteromedial extension of the pterygoid. Of  course a parasphenoid may also have been present.    The position, length, and shape of the premaxillary shown in palatal  view (Fig. 4) are primarily based upon the dorsal appearance since  ventrally most of it cannot be seen. At the point where it forms the  anterior border of the internal naris, the premaxillary is slightly  wider than the maxillary and seems to become narrower as it approaches  the midline.    The ethmosphenoid, which we cannot identify, may have been exposed in a  gap between the premaxillary and the palatine. The gap measures  approximately 8.0 mm. wide and ranges up to 1.0 mm. anteroposteriorly.    The maxillary begins at a suture with the premaxillary lateral to the  naris and continues posteriorly, bordering the orbit with a width of  about 1.2 mm. It then tapers to a point approximately 2.0 mm. anterior  to the lateral projection of the pterygoid. The width of the maxillary  at this point is 0.8 mm. and the posterior end is broken; probably when  complete it approached the pterygoid, and either met the latter or had  a ligamentous connection with it. As nearly as can be determined, the  total length of the maxillary is approximately 12.0 mm.    The teeth on the maxillary are small and seem to be in two longitudinal  rows. The palatine bears two large, grooved teeth anteriorly; the first  is approximately 1.0 mm. posteromedial to the naris and the second is  about 3.0 mm. posterior and slightly lateral to the naris. The flat  ventral surfaces of the palatine and pterygoid bear numerous small  teeth distributed as shown in Fig. 4.    _Braincase and Occipital Region_ (Fig. 5)    The parts of the neurocranium are scattered, disconnected and  incomplete, but it is possible to make out a number of features of the  otico-occipital section with fair assurance. In posterior view the  notochordal canal and foramen magnum are confluent with each other, and  of great size relative to the skull as a whole. The notochordal canal  measures 2.8 mm. in diameter, and the foramen magnum about 4.0 mm. The  crescent-shaped supraoccipital rests on the upright ends of the  exoccipitals, but between the latter and the basioccipital no sutures  can be seen. Probably the whole posterior surface of the braincase  slanted posteroventrally; consequently the rim of the notochordal canal  was about 3.0 mm. behind the margin of the parietals.    The U-shaped border of the notochordal canal is a thick, rounded bone,  comparable in appearance to the U-shaped intercentra of the vertebrae.  This bone apparently rested upon a thinner, troughlike piece (Fig. 5 B)  forming the floor of the braincase. The latter is broad, shallow,  concave, open midventrally and narrowing anteriorly to form a pair of  articular processes. Since no sutures can be seen in this structure, it  probably is the ventral, ossified portion of the basioccipital. Watson  (1926, Fig. 4 B) illustrates the floor of the braincase in  _Eusthenopteron_, with its more lateral, anterior portion labelled  prootic, but in our specimen the corresponding part could scarcely have  formed the anterior wall of the otic capsule, being entirely in the  plane of the floor. The two articular surfaces anteriorly near the  midline suggest that a movable joint existed between the  otico-occipital part of the braincase and the ethmosphenoid part, as in  Rhipidistia (Romer, 1937). We have found nothing in the specimen that  could be referred to the ethmosphenoid; it may have been unossified.    [Illustration: FIG. 5. _Hesperoherpeton garnettense_ Peabody, KU 10295,  x 4. A, occipital view of skull; B, basioccipital bone in dorsal  (internal) view.]    The otic capsules appear to have rested against lateral projections of  the basioccipital. The single otic capsule that can be seen (the  right) is massively built, apparently ossified in one piece, with a  shallow dorsomedial excavation, probably the vestige of a supratemporal  fossa. On the lateral face is a broad, shallow depression dorsally, and  a narrower, deeper one anteroventrally; these we suppose to have  received the broader and narrower heads of the stapes, respectively.  The posterior wall of the otic capsule we have designated opisthotic in  the figure. Anterior to the otic capsule the lateral wall of the  braincase cannot be seen, and may not have been ossified.    The roof of the braincase is visible in its ventral aspect, extending  from approximately the occipital margin to a broken edge in front of  the parietal foramen, and laterally to paired processes which overlie  the otic capsules directly behind the orbits (see dotted outlines in  Fig. 1). Each of these postorbital processes, seen from beneath,  appears to be the lateral extension of a shallow groove beginning near  the midline. Presumably this section of the roof is an ossification of  the synotic tectum. It should be noted that the roof of the braincase  proper is perfectly distinct from the overlying series of dermal bones,  and that the parietal foramen can be seen in both. The roof of the  braincase in our specimen seems to have been detached from the  underlying otic capsules and the occipital wall.    The bone that we take to be the stapes is blunt, flattened (perhaps by  crushing), 5.0 mm. in length, and has two unequal heads; its width  across both of these is 4.0 mm. The length is appropriate to fit  between the lateral face of the otic capsule and the dorsal edge of the  quadrate; the wider head rests on a posterodorsal concavity on the otic  capsule, and the smaller fits a lower, more anterior pit. Laterally the  stapes carries a short, broad process that probably made contact with a  dorsally placed tympanic membrane. Thus the bone was a hyomandibular in  the sense that it articulated with the quadrate, but it may also have  served as a stapes in sound-transmission. It contains no visible canal  or foramen.    _Mandible_ (Fig. 6)    The crushed inner surface of the posterior part of the left mandible  and most of the external surface of the right mandible are preserved in  close proximity. Although the whole length of the tooth-bearing margins  is missing, some parts of six elements of the right mandible can be  seen. The pattern of sutures and the general contour closely resemble  those of _Megalichthys_ (Watson, 1926, Figs. 37, 38) and other known  Rhipidistia.    The anteroposterior length of the mandible is about 23.8 mm., and the  depth is 3.8 mm. The dentary extends approximately 17.6 mm. back from  the symphysis, and its greatest width is probably 2.0 mm. Its lower  edge meets all the other lateral bones of the jaw. The splenial and  postsplenial form the curved anteroventral half of the jaw for a  distance of about 9.0 mm.

MASQUES.      It sometimes happens, in the history of national amusements, that a name  survives while the thing itself is forgotten. This has been remarkably  the case with our court Masques, respecting which our most eminent  writers long ventured on so many false opinions, with a perfect  ignorance of the nature of these compositions, which combined all that  was exquisite in the imitative arts of poetry, painting, music, song,  dancing, and machinery, at a period when our public theatre was in its  rude infancy. Convinced of the miserable state of our represented drama,  and not then possessing that more curious knowledge of their domestic  history which we delight to explore, they were led into erroneous  notions of one of the most gorgeous, the most fascinating, and the most  poetical of dramatic amusements. Our present theatrical exhibitions are,  indeed, on a scale to which the twopenny audiences of the barn  playhouses of Shakspeare could never have strained their sight; and our  picturesque and learned _costume_, with the brilliant changes of our  scenery, would have maddened the \"property-men\" and the \"tire-women\" of  the Globe or the Red Bull.[2] Shakspeare himself never beheld the true  magical illusions of his own dramas, with \"Enter the Red Coat,\" and  \"Exit Hat and Cloak,\" helped out with \"painted cloths;\" or, as a bard of  Charles the Second's time chants--                          Look back and see    The strange vicissitudes of poetrie;    Your aged fathers came to plays for wit,    And sat knee-deep in nut-shells in the pit.    But while the public theatre continued long in this contracted state,  without scenes, without dresses, without an orchestra, the court  displayed scenical and dramatic exhibitions with such costly  magnificence, such inventive fancy, and such miraculous art, that we may  doubt if the combined genius of Ben Jonson, Inigo Jones, and Lawes, or  Ferobosco, at an era most favourable to the arts of imagination, has  been equalled by the modern _spectacle_ of the Opera.    But this circumstance had entirely escaped the knowledge of our critics.  The critic of a Masque must not only have read it, but he must also have  heard and have viewed it. The only witnesses in this case are those  letter-writers of the day, who were then accustomed to communicate such  domestic intelligence to their absent friends: from such ample  correspondence I have often drawn some curious and sometimes important  information. It is amusing to notice the opinions of some great critics,  how from an original mis-statement they have drawn an illegitimate  opinion, and how one inherits from the other the error which he  propagates. Warburton said on Masques, that \"Shakspeare was an enemy to  these _fooleries_, as appears by his writing none.\" This opinion was  among the many which that singular critic threw out as they arose at the  moment; for Warburton forgot that Shakspeare characteristically  introduces one in the _Tempest's_ most fanciful scene.[3] Granger, who  had not much time to study the manners of the age whose personages he  was so well acquainted with, in a note on Milton's Masque, said that  \"these compositions were trifling and perplexed allegories, the persons  of which are fantastical to the last degree. Ben Jonson, in his 'Masque  of Christmas,' has introduced 'Minced Pie,' and 'Baby Cake,' who act  their parts in the drama.[4] But the most _wretched performances_ of  this kind could please by the help of music, machinery, and dancing.\"  Granger blunders, describing by two farcical characters a species of  composition of which farce was not the characteristic. Such personages  as he notices would enter into the Anti-masque, which was a humorous  parody of the more solemn Masque, and sometimes relieved it. Malone,  whose fancy was not vivid, condemns Masques and the age of Masques, in  which, he says, echoing Granger's epithet, \"the _wretched taste_ of the  times found amusement.\" And lastly comes Mr. Todd, whom the splendid  fragment of the \"Arcades,\" and the entire Masque, which we have by  heart, could not warm; while his neutralising criticism fixes him at the  freezing point of the thermometer. \"This dramatic entertainment,  performed not without prodigious expense in machinery and decoration, to  _which humour_ we certainly owe the entertainment of 'Arcades,' and the  inimitable Mask of 'Comus.'\" _Comus_, however, is only a fine dramatic  poem, retaining scarcely any features of the Masque. The only modern  critic who had written with some research on this departed elegance of  the English drama was Warton, whose fancy responded to the fascination  of the fairy-like magnificence and lyrical spirit of the Masque. Warton  had the taste to give a specimen from \"The Inner Temple Mask by William  Browne,\" the pastoral poet, whose Address to Sleep, he observed,  \"reminds us of some favourite touches in Milton's _Comus_, to which it  perhaps gave birth.\" Yet even Warton was deficient in that sort of  research which only can discover the true nature of these singular  dramas.    Such was the state in which, some years ago, I found all our knowledge  of this once favourite amusement of our court, our nobility, and our  learned bodies of the four inns of court. Some extensive researches,  pursued among contemporary manuscripts, cast a new light over this  obscure child of fancy and magnificence. I could not think lightly of  what Ben Jonson has called \"The Eloquence of Masques;\" entertainments on  which from three to five thousand pounds were expended, and on more  public occasions ten and twenty thousand. To the aid of the poetry,  composed by the finest poets, came the most skilful musicians and the  most elaborate machinists; Ben Jonson, and Inigo Jones,[5] and Lawes  blended into one piece their respective genius; and Lord Bacon, and  Whitelocke, and Selden, who sat in committees for the last grand Masque  presented to Charles the First, invented the devices; composed the  procession of the Masquers and the Anti-Masquers; while one took the  care of the dancing or the brawlers, and Whitelocke the music--the sage  Whitelocke! who has chronicled his self-complacency on this occasion, by  claiming the invention of a _Coranto_, which for thirty years afterwards  was the delight of the nation, and was blessed by the name of  \"Whitelocke's Coranto,\" and which was always called for, two or three  times over, whenever that great statesman \"came to see a play!\"[6] So  much personal honour was considered to be involved in the conduct of a  Masque, that even this committee of illustrious men was on the point of  being broken up by too serious a discussion concerning precedence; and  the Masque had nearly not taken place, till they hit on the expedient of  throwing dice to decide on their rank in the procession! On this  jealousy of honour in the composition of a Masque, I discovered, what  hitherto had escaped the knowledge, although not the curiosity, of  literary inquirers--the occasion of the memorable enmity between Ben  Jonson and Inigo Jones, who had hitherto acted together with brotherly  affection; \"a circumstance,\" says Gifford, to whom I communicated it,  \"not a little important in the history of our calumniated poet.\" The  trivial cause, but not so in its consequences, was the poet prefixing  his own name before that of the architect on the title-page of a Masque,  which hitherto had only been annexed;[7] so jealous was the great  architect of his _part_ of the Masque, and so predominant his power and  name at court, that he considered his rights invaded by the _inferior_  claims of the poet! Jonson has poured out the whole bitterness of his  soul in two short satires: still more unfortunately for the subject of  these satires, they provoked Inigo to sharpen his pen on rhyme; but it  is edgeless, and the blunt composition still lies "]]]
