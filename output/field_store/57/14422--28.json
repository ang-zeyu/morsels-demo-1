For instance, my breakfast was a long time bread and milk (no  tea), and I ate it out of a twopenny earthen porringer with a pewter  spoon.\"    With all this frugality, Franklin was not a miser; he abhorred the  waste of money, not the proper use. His wealth increased rapidly. \"I  experienced too,\" he says, \"the truth of the observation, 'THAT AFTER  GETTING THE FIRST HUNDRED POUND, IT IS MORE EASY TO GET THE SECOND,  money itself being of a prolific nature.\" He gave much unpaid public  service and subscribed generously to public purposes; yet he was able,  at the early age of forty-two, to turn over his printing office to one  of his journeymen, and to retire from active business, intending to  devote himself thereafter to such public employment as should come his  way, to philosophical or scientific studies, and to amusements.    From boyhood Franklin had been interested in natural phenomena. His  \"Journal of a Voyage from London to Philadelphia\", written at sea as he  returned from his first stay in London, shows unusual powers of exact  observation for a youth of twenty. Many of the questions he propounded  to the Junto had a scientific bearing. He made an original and important  invention in 1749, the \"Pennsylvania fireplace,\" which, under the name  of the Franklin stove, is in common use to this day, and which brought  to the ill-made houses of the time increased comfort and a great saving  of fuel. But it brought Franklin no pecuniary reward, for he never  deigned to patent any of his inventions.    His active, inquiring mind played upon hundreds of questions in a dozen  different branches of science. He studied smoky chimneys; he invented  bifocal spectacles; he studied the effect of oil upon ruffled water;  he identified the \"dry bellyache\" as lead poisoning; he preached  ventilation in the days when windows were closed tight at night, and  upon the sick at all times; he investigated fertilizers in agriculture.  Many of his suggestions have since borne fruit, and his observations  show that he foresaw some of the great developments of the nineteenth  century.    His fame in science rests chiefly upon his discoveries in electricity.  On a visit to Boston in 1746 he saw some electrical experiments and at  once became deeply interested. Peter Collinson of London, a Fellow  of the Royal Society, who had made several gifts to the Philadelphia  Library, sent over some of the crude electrical apparatus of the day,  which Franklin used, as well as some contrivances he had purchased in  Boston. He says in a letter to Collinson: \"For my own part, I never was  before engaged in any study that so engrossed my attention and my time  as this has lately done.\"    Franklin's letters to Collinson tell of his first experiments and  speculations as to the nature of electricity. Experiments made by a  little group of friends showed the effect of pointed bodies in drawing  off electricity. He decided that electricity was not the result of  friction, but that the mysterious force was diffused through most  substances, and that nature is always alert to restore its equilibrium.  He developed the theory of positive and negative electricity, or plus  and minus electrification. The same letter tells of some of the tricks  which the little group of experimenters were accustomed to play upon  their wondering neighbors. They set alcohol on fire, relighted candles  just blown out, produced mimic flashes of lightning, gave shocks  on touching or kissing, and caused an artificial spider to move  mysteriously.    Franklin carried on experiments with the Leyden jar, made an electrical  battery, killed a fowl and roasted it upon a spit turned by electricity,  sent a current through water and found it still able to ignite alcohol,  ignited gunpowder, and charged glasses of wine so that the drinkers  received shocks. More important, perhaps, he began to develop the theory  of the identity of lightning and electricity, and the possibility of  protecting buildings by iron rods. By means of an iron rod he brought  down electricity into his house, where he studied its effect upon bells  and concluded that clouds were generally negatively electrified. In  June, 1752, he performed the famous experiment with the kite, drawing  down electricity from the clouds and charging a Leyden jar from the key  at the end of the string.    Franklin's letters to Collinson were read before the Royal Society  but were unnoticed. Collinson gathered them together, and they were  published in a pamphlet which attracted wide attention. Translated into  French, they created great excitement, and Franklin's conclusions were  generally accepted by the scientific men of Europe. The Royal Society,  tardily awakened, elected Franklin a member and in 1753 awarded him the  Copley medal with a complimentary address.*    * It may be useful to mention some of the scientific facts and  mechanical principles which were known to Europeans at this time.  More than one learned essay has been written to prove the mechanical  indebtedness of the modern world to the ancient, particularly to the  works of those mechanically minded Greeks: Archimedes, Aristotle,  Ctesibius, and Hero of Alexandria. The Greeks employed the lever, the  tackle, and the crane, the force-pump, and the suction-pump. They had  discovered that steam could be mechanically applied, though they never  made any practical use of steam. In common with other ancients they  knew the principle of the mariner's compass. The Egyptians had the  water-wheel and the rudimentary blast-furnace. The pendulum clock  appears to have been an invention of the Middle Ages. The art of  printing from movable type, beginning with Gutenberg about 1450, helped  to further the Renaissance. The improved mariner's compass enabled  Columbus to find the New world; gunpowder made possible its conquest.  The compound microscope and the first practical telescope came from the  spectacle makers of Middelburg, Holland, the former about 1590 and the  latter about 1608. Harvey, an English physician, had discovered the  circulation of the blood in 1628, and Newton, an English mathematician,  the law of gravitation in 1685.      If Franklin's desire to continue his scientific researches had been  gratified, it is possible that he might have discovered some of the  secrets for which the world waited until Edison and his contemporaries  revealed them more than a century later. Franklin's scientific  reputation has grown with the years, and some of his views seem in  perfect accord with the latest developments in electricity. But he  was not to be permitted to continue his experiments. He had shown his  ability to manage men and was to be called to a wider field.    Franklin's influence among his fellow citizens in Philadelphia was very  great. Always ostensibly keeping himself in the background and working  through others, never contradicting, but carrying his point by shrewd  questions which showed the folly of the contrary position, he continued  to set on foot and carry out movements for the public good. He  established the first circulating library in Philadelphia, and one of  the first in the country, and an academy which grew into the University  of Pennsylvania. He was instrumental in the foundation of a hospital. \"I  am often ask'd by those to whom I propose subscribing,\" said one of the  doctors who had made fruitless attempts to raise money for the hospital,  \"Have you consulted Franklin upon this business?\" Other public matters  in which the busy printer was engaged were the paving and cleaning of  the streets, better street lighting, the organization of a police force  and of a fire company. A pamphlet which he published, \"Plain Truth\",  showing the helplessness of the colony against the French and Indians,  led to the organization of a volunteer militia, and funds were raised  for arms by a lottery. Franklin himself was elected colonel of the  Philadelphia regiment, \"but considering myself unfit, I declined  the station and recommended Mr. Lawrence, a fine person and man of  influence, who was accordingly appointed.\" In spite of his militarism,  Franklin retained the position which he held as Clerk of the Assembly,  though the majority of the members were Quakers opposed to war on  principle.    The American Philosophical Society owes its origin to Franklin. It was  formally organized on his motion in 1743, but the society has accepted  the organization of the Junto in 1727 as the actual date of its birth.  From the beginning the society has had among its members many leading  men of scientific attainments or tastes, not only of Philadelphia, but  of the world. In 1769 the original society was consolidated with another  of similar aims, and Franklin, who was the first secretary of the  society, was elected president and served until his death. The first  important undertaking was the successful observation of the transit of  Venus in 1769, and many important scientific discoveries have since been  made by its members and first given to the world at its meetings.    Franklin's appointment as one of the two Deputy Postmasters General  of the colonies in 1753 enlarged his experience and his reputation. He  visited nearly all the post offices in the colonies and introduced  many improvements into the service. In none of his positions did his  transcendent business ability show to better advantage. He established  new postal routes and shortened others. There were no good roads in the  colonies, but his post riders made what then seemed wonderful speed.  The bags were opened to newspapers, the carrying of which had previously  been a private and unlawful perquisite of the riders.

ISAAC was  the father of the great astronomer.    He appears to have early had a passionate fondness for music, and this,  added to a distaste for his father's calling, determined his career. He  was taught music by an oboe-player in the royal band, and he also  learned the violin. At the age of twenty-one he studied music for a year  under the Cappelmeister PABRICH, at Potsdam, and in August, 1731, he  became oboist in the band of the Guards, at Hanover. In August, 1732, he  married ANNA ILSE MORITZEN. She appears to have been a careful and busy  wife and mother, possessed of no special faculties which would lead us  to attribute to her care any great part of the abilities of her son.  She could not herself write the letters which she sent to her husband  during his absences with his regiment. It was her firm belief that the  separations and some of the sorrows of the family came from too much  learning; and while she could not hinder the education of the sons of  the family, she prevented their sisters from learning French and  dancing. It is but just to say that the useful accomplishments of  cooking, sewing, and the care of a household, were thoroughly taught by  her to her two daughters. The father, ISAAC, appears to have been of a  different mould, and to him, no doubt, the chief intellectual  characteristics of the family are due. His position obliged him to be  often absent from Hanover, with his regiment, but his hand appears to  have been always present, smoothing over difficulties, and encouraging  his sons to such learning and improvement as was to be had.    His health was seriously injured by the exposures of the campaigns,  and he was left, after the Seven Years' War, with a broken constitution.    After his final return home, in 1760, his daughter gives this record of  him--        \"Copying music employed every vacant moment, even sometimes      throughout half the night. . . . With my brother [DIETRICH]--now a      little engaging creature of between four and five years old--he was      very much pleased, and [on the first evening of his arrival at home]      before he went to rest, the Adempken (a little violin) was taken      from the shelf and newly strung, and the daily lessons immediately      commenced. . . . I do not recollect that he ever desired any other      society than what he had opportunities of enjoying in many of the      parties where he was introduced by his profession, though far from      being of a morose disposition; he would frequently encourage my      mother in keeping up a social intercourse among a few acquaintances,      whilst his afternoon hours generally were taken up in giving lessons      to some scholars at home, who gladly saved him the troublesome      exertion of walking. . . . He also found great pleasure in seeing      DIETRICH'S improvement, who, young as he was, and of the most lively      temper imaginable, was always ready to receive his lessons, leaving      his little companions with the greatest cheerfulness to go to his      father, who was so pleased with his performances that he made him      play a solo on the Adempken in RAKE'S concert, being placed on a      table before a crowded company, for which he was very much applauded      and caressed, particularly by an English lady, who put a gold coin      in his little pocket.        \"It was not long before my father had as many scholars as he could      find time to attend. And when they assembled at my father's to make      little concerts, I was frequently called to join the second violin      in an overture, for my father found pleasure in giving me sometimes      a lesson before the instruments were laid by, after practising with      DIETRICH, for I never was missing at those hours, sitting in a      corner with my knitting and listening all the while.\"    Here, as in all her writing, CAROLINA is simple, true, direct to  awkwardness, and unconsciously pathetic even in joy.    The family of ISAAC and ANNA HERSCHEL consisted of ten children. Six of  these lived to adult age. They were:        1. SOPHIA ELIZABETH; born 1733, married GRIESBACH, a musician in the         Guard, by whom she had children. Five of her sons were afterwards         musicians at the court, in England, where they obtained places         through the influence of WILLIAM.        2. HENRY ANTON JACOB; born 1734, November 20.        4. FREDERIC WILLIAM (the astronomer) born 1738, November 15.        6. JOHN ALEXANDER; born 1745, November 13.        8. CAROLINA LUCRETIA; born 1750, March 16.        10. DIETRICH; born 1755, September 13.    Of this family group, the important figures to us are WILLIAM,  ALEXANDER, and CAROLINA.    JACOB was organist at the Garrison Church of Hanover in 1753, a member  of the Guards' band in 1755, and first violin in the Hanover Court  Orchestra in 1759. Afterwards he joined his brother WILLIAM in Bath, but  again returned to Hanover. In 1771 he published in Amsterdam his Opus  I., a set of six quartettes, and later, in London, he published two  symphonies and six trios. He appears to have been a clever musician, and  his letters to his younger brother WILLIAM are full of discussion on  points of musical composition, etc. He died in 1792.    DIETRICH, the youngest brother, shared in the musical abilities of his  family, and when only fifteen years old was so far advanced as to be  able to supply his brother JACOB'S place in the Court Orchestra, and to  give his lessons to private pupils. There is no one of the family,  except the eldest daughter, whom we do not know to have possessed marked  ability in music, and this taste descended truly for four generations.  In the letters of Chevalier BUNSEN,[2] he describes meeting, in 1847,  the eldest granddaughter of WILLIAM HERSCHEL, who, he says, \"is a  musical genius.\"    Three members of the family, WILLIAM, ALEXANDER, and CAROLINA, formed a  group which was inseparable for many years, and while the progress of  the lives of ALEXANDER and CAROLINA was determined by the energy and  efforts of WILLIAM, these two lent him an aid without which his career  would have been strangely different. It is necessary to understand a  little better the early life of all three.    The sons of the HERSCHEL family all attended the garrison school in  Hanover until they were about fourteen years old. They were taught the  ordinary rudiments of knowledge--to read, to write, to cipher--and a  knowledge of French and English was added. WILLIAM especially  distinguished himself in his studies, learning French very rapidly, and  studying Latin and arithmetic with his master out of hours. The  household life seems to have been active, harmonious, and intelligent,  especially during the presence of the father, who took a great delight  in the rapid progress of all his sons in music, and who encouraged them  with his companionship in their studies and in their reading on all  intellectual subjects.    From the _Memoir_ of CAROLINA, on which we must depend for our  knowledge of this early life, we take the following paragraph:        \"My brothers were often introduced as solo performers and assistants      in the orchestra of the court, and I remember that I was frequently      prevented from going to sleep by the lively criticism on music on      coming from a concert, or by conversations on philosophical subjects,      which lasted frequently till morning, in which my father was a      lively partaker and assistant of my brother WILLIAM, by contriving      self-made instruments. . . . Often I would keep myself awake that      I might listen to their animating remarks, for it made _me so happy_      to see _them so happy_. But generally their conversation would      branch out on philosophical subjects, when my brother WILLIAM and my      father often argued with such warmth that my mother's interference      became necessary, when the names LEIBNITZ, NEWTON, and EULER      sounded rather too loud for the repose of her little ones, who      ought to be in school by seven in the morning. But it seems that      on the brothers retiring to their own room, where they shared      the same bed, my brother WILLIAM had still a great deal to say; and      frequently it happened that when he stopped for an assent or reply,      he found his hearer was gone to sleep, and I suppose it was not till      then that he bethought himself to do the same.        \"The recollection of these happy scenes confirms me in the belief,      that had my brother WILLIAM not then been interrupted in his      philosophical pursuits, we should have had much earlier proofs of      his inventive genius. My father was a great admirer of astronomy,      and had some knowledge of that science; for I remember his taking      me, on a clear frosty night, into the street, to make me acquainted      with several of the most beautiful constellations, after we had been      gazing at a comet which was then visible. And I well remember with      what delight he used to assist my brother WILLIAM in his various      contrivances in the pursuit of his philosophical studies, among      which was a neatly turned 4-inch globe, upon which the equator and      ecliptic were engraved by my brother.\"    The mechanical genius was not confined to WILLIAM, for we read that  ALEXANDER used often to \"sit by us and amuse us and himself by making  all sorts of things out of pasteboard, or contriving how to make a  twelve-hour cuckoo clock go a week.\" This ability of ALEXANDER'S was  turned later to the best account when he became his brother WILLIAM'S  right hand in the manufacture of reflectors, eye-pieces, and stands in  England. His abilities were great, and a purpose which might otherwise  have been lacking was supplied through the younger brother's ardor in  all that he undertook.    His musical talent was"]]]
