I am afraid I may have given offence to those whom I should most of all  like to please--the living contributors to this anthology--by  tampering in this way with the text of their poems.  In defence of what I  have done, I must put forward the plea of consistency.  If I had  preserved every poet's text as I found it, I should have reduced my  readers to despair.    In conclusion, I should--like to thank the contributors to this volume,  and also their publishers, for the permission to reproduce copyright  work.  Special thanks are due to Mr. Richard Blakeborough, who has placed  Yorkshiremen under a debt, by the great service which he has rendered in  recovering much of the traditional poetry of Yorkshire and in giving it  the permanence of the printed page.  In compiling the so-called  traditional poems at the end of this volume, I have largely drawn upon  his Wit, Character, Folklore, and Customs of the North Riding.

Both the       south-west and the north-east have a word praad--with a       vowel--sound like the a in father--but whereas in the south-       west it stands for proud, in the north-east it stands for       pride,          Preface (To the Second Edition)    The demand for a second edition of this anthology of Yorkshire dialect  verse gives me an opportunity of correcting two rather serious error's  which crept into the first edition.  The poem entitled \"Hunting Song\" on  page 86, which I attributed to Mr. Richard Blakeborough, is the work of  Mr. Malham-Dembleby\", whose poem, \"A Kuss,\" immediately precedes it in  the volume.    The poem on page 75, which in the first edition was marked Anonymous and  entitled \"Parson Drew thro' Pudsey,\" is the work of the late John  Hartley; its proper' title is \"T' First o' t' Sooar't,\" and it includes  eight introductory stanzas which are now added as Appendix II.    Through the kindness of: Fr W. A. Craigie, Dr.  M. Denby, and Mr. E. G.  Bayford, I have also been able to make a few changes in the glossarial  footnotes, The most important of these is the change from \"Ember's\" to  \"Floor\" as the meaning of the word, \"Fleet\" in the second line of \"A  Lyke-wake Dirge.\" The note which Dr. Craigie sen't me on this word is so  interesting that I reproduce it here verbatim:    \"The word fleet in the 'Lyke-wake Dirge' has been much misunderstood, but  it is certain1y the same thing as flet-floor; see the O.E.D. and E.D.D.  under.  FLET.  The form is not necessarily 'erroneous,' as is said in the  O.E.D., for it might represent ,the O.N. dative fleti, which must have  been common in the phrase a fleti (cf. the first verse of 'Havamal').  The collocation with 'fire' occurs in 'Sir Gawayne' (l. 1653): 'Aboute  the fyre upon flet.' 'Fire and fleet and candle-light' are a summary of  the comforts of the house, which the dead person still enjoys for 'this  ae night,' and then goes out into the dark and cold.\"    F. W. Moorman          INTRODUCTION    The publication of an anthology of Yorkshire dialect poetry seems to  demand a brief introduction in which something shall be said of the  history and general character of that poetry.  It is hardly necessary to  state that Yorkshire has produced neither a Robert Burns, a William  Barnes, nor even an Edwin Waugh.  Its singers are as yet known only among  their own folk; the names of John Castillo and Florence Tweddell are  household words among the peasants of the Cleveland dales, as are those  of Ben Preston and John Hartley among the artisans of the Aire and Calder  valleys; but, outside of the county, they are almost unknown, except to  those who are of Yorkshire descent and who cherish the dialect because of  its association with the homes of their childhood.    At the same time there is no body of dialect verse which better deserves  the honour of an anthology.  In volume and variety the dialect poetry of  Yorkshire surpasses that of all other English counties.  Moreover, when  the rise of the Standard English idiom crushed out our dialect  literature, it was the Yorkshire dialect which first reasserted its  claims upon the muse of poetry; hence, whereas the dialect literature of  most of the English counties dates only from the beginning of the  nineteenth century, that of Yorkshire reaches back to the second half of  the seventeenth.    In one sense it may be said that Yorkshire dialect poetry dates, not from  the seventeenth, but from the seventh century, and that the first  Yorkshire dialect poet was Caedmon, the neat-herd of Whitby Abbey.  But  to the ordinary person the reference to a dialect implies the existence  of a standard mode of speech almost as certainly as odd implies even.  Accordingly, this is not the place to speak of that great heritage of  song which Yorkshire bequeathed to the nation between the seventh century  and the fifteenth.  After the Caedmonic poems, its chief glories are the  religious lyrics of Richard Rolle, the mystic, and the great cycles of  scriptural plays which are associated with the trade-guilds of York and  Wakefield.  But in the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries the  all-conquering Standard English spread like a mighty spring-tide over  England and found no check to its progress till the Cheviots were  reached.  The new \"King's English\" was of little avail in silencing  dialect as a means of intercourse between man and man, but it checked for  centuries the development of dialect literature.  The old traditional  ballads and songs, which were handed down orally from generation to  generation in the speech of the district to which they belonged, escaped  to some extent this movement towards uniformity; but the deliberate  artificers of verse showed themselves eager above all things to get rid  of their provincialisms and use only the language of the Court.  Shakespeare may introduce a few Warwickshire words into his plays, but  his English is none the less the Standard English of his day, while  Spenser is sharply brought to task by Ben Jonson for using archaisms and  provincialisms in his poems.  A notable song of the Elizabethan age is  that entitled \"York, York, for my Monie,\" which was first published in  1584; only a Yorkshireman could have written it, and it was plainly  intended for the gratification of Yorkshire pride; yet its language is  without trace of local colour, either in spelling or vocabulary.  Again,  there appeared in the year 1615 a poem by Richard Brathwaite, entitled,  \"The Yorkshire Cottoneers,\" and addressed to \"all true-bred Northerne  Sparks, of the generous society of the Cottoneers, who hold their  High-roade by the Pinder of Wakefield, the Shoo-maker of Bradford, and  the white Coate of Kendall\"; but Brathwaite, though a Kendal man by  birth, makes no attempt to win the hearts of his \"true-bred Northern  Sparks\" by addressing them in the dialect that was their daily wear.  In  a word, the use of the Yorkshire dialect for literary purposes died out  early in the Tudor period.    As already stated, its rebirth dates from the second half of the  seventeenth century.  That was an age of scientific investigation and  antiquarian research.  John Ray, the father of natural history, not  content with his achievements in the classification of plants, took up  also the collection of outlandish words, and in the year 1674 he  published a work entitled, A Collection of English Words, not generally  used, with their Significations and Original, in two Alphabetical  Catalogues, the one of such as are proper to the Northern, the other to  the Southern Counties.  Later he entered into correspondence with the  Leeds antiquary, Ralph Thoresby, who, in a letter dated April 27, 1703,  sends him a list of dialect words current in and about Leeds.(1)    Side by side with this new interest in the dialect vocabulary comes also  the dialect poem.  One year before the appearance of Ray's Collection of  English Words the York printer, Stephen Bulkby, had issued, as a humble  broadside without author's name, a poem which bore the following title: A  Yorkshire Dialogue in Yorkshire Dialect; Between an Awd Wife, a Lass, and  a Butcher.  This dialogue occupies the first place in our anthology, and  it is, from several points of view, a significant work.  It marks the  beginning, not only of modern Yorkshire, but also of modern English,  dialect poetry.  It appeared just a thousand years after Caedmon had sung  the Creator's praise in Whitby Abbey, and its dialect is that of  northeast Yorkshire--in other words, the lineal descendant of that speech  which was used by Caedmon in the seventh century, by Richard Rolle in the  fourteenth, and which may be heard to this day in the streets of Whitby  and among the hamlets of the Cleveland Hills.    The dialogue is a piece of boldest realism.  Written in an age when  classic restraint and classic elegance were in the ascendant, and when  English poets were taking only too readily to heart the warning of  Boileau against allowing shepherds to speak \"comme on parle au village,\"  the author of this rustic dialogue flings to the winds every convention  of poetic elegance.  His lines \"baisent la terre\" in a way that would  have inexpressibly shocked Boileau and the Parisian salons.  The poem  reeks of the byre and the shambles; its theme is the misadventure which  befalls an ox in its stall and its final despatch by the butcher's  mallet! One might perhaps find something comparable to it in theme and  treatment in the paintings of the contemporary school of Dutch realists,  but in poetry it is unique.  Yet, gross as is its realism, it cannot be  called crude as a work of poetic art.  In rhyme and rhythm it is quite"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/28897"],[0,"The Variation of Animals and Plants Under Domestication, Volume II (of 2) (#2)"],[1,"IZE, COLOUR, CHEMICAL PROPERTIES, AND IN THE STATE OF THE  TISSUES--LOCAL DISEASES--CONSPICUOUS MODIFICATIONS FROM CHANGED CLIMATE OR  FOOD, ETC.--PLUMAGE OF BIRDS AFFECTED BY PECULIAR NUTRIMENT, AND BY THE  INOCULATION OF POISON--LAND-SHELLS--MODIFICATIONS OF ORGANIC BEINGS IN A  STATE OF NATURE THROUGH THE DEFINITE ACTION OF EXTERNAL  CONDITIONS--COMPARISON OF AMERICAN AND EUROPEAN TREES--GALLS--EFFECTS OF  PARASITIC FUNGI--CONSIDERATIONS OPPOSED TO THE BELIEF IN THE POTENT  INFLUENCE OF CHANGED EXTERNAL CONDITIONS--PARALLEL SERIES OF  VARIETIES--AMOUNT OF VARIATION DOES NOT CORRESPOND WITH THE DEGREE OF  CHANGE IN THE CONDITIONS--BUD-VARIATION--MONSTROSITIES PRODUCED BY  UNNATURAL TREATMENT--SUMMARY ...

The subject of inheritance is an immense one, and has been treated by many  authors. One work alone, 'De l'Heredite Naturelle,' by Dr. Prosper Lucas,  runs to the length of 1562 pages. We must confine ourselves to certain  points which have an important bearing on the general subject of variation,  both with domestic and natural productions. It is obvious that a variation  which is not inherited throws no light on the derivation of species, nor is  of any service to man, except in the case of perennial plants, which can be  propagated by buds.    If animals and plants had never been domesticated, and wild ones alone had  been observed, we should probably never have heard the saying, that \"like  begets like.\" The proposition would have been as self-evident, as that all  the buds on the same tree are alike, though neither proposition is strictly  true. For, as has often been remarked, probably no two individuals are {2}  identically the same. All wild animals recognise each other, which shows  that there is some difference between them; and when the eye is well  practised, the shepherd knows each sheep, and man can distinguish a  fellow-man out of millions on millions of other men. Some authors have gone  so far as to maintain that the production of slight differences is as much  a necessary function of the powers of generation, as the production of  offspring like their parents. This view, as we shall see in a future  chapter, is not theoretically probable, though practically it holds good.  The saying that \"like begets like\" has in fact arisen from the perfect  confidence felt by breeders, that a superior or inferior animal will  generally reproduce its kind; but this very superiority or inferiority  shows that the individual in question has departed slightly from its type.    The whole subject of inheritance is wonderful. When a new character arises,  whatever its nature may be, it generally tends to be inherited, at least in  a temporary and sometimes in a most persistent manner. What can be more  wonderful than that some trifling peculiarity, not primordially attached to  the species, should be transmitted through the male or female sexual cells,  which are so minute as not to be visible to the naked eye, and afterwards  through the incessant changes of a long course of development, undergone  either in the womb or in the egg, and ultimately appear in the offspring  when mature, or even when quite old, as in the case of certain diseases? Or  again, what can be more wonderful than the well-ascertained fact that the  minute ovule of a good milking cow will produce a male, from whom a cell,  in union with an ovule, will produce a female, and she, when mature, will  have large mammary glands, yielding an abundant supply of milk, and even  milk of a particular quality? Nevertheless, the real subject of surprise  is, as Sir H. Holland has well remarked,[1] not that a character should be  inherited, but that any should ever fail to be inherited. In a future  chapter, devoted to an hypothesis which I have termed pangenesis, an  attempt will be made to show the means by which characters of all kinds are  transmitted from generation to generation.    {3}    Some writers,[2] who have not attended to natural history, have attempted  to show that the force of inheritance has been much exaggerated. The  breeders of animals would smile at such simplicity; and if they  condescended to make any answer, might ask what would be the chance of  winning a prize if two inferior animals were paired together? They might  ask whether the half-wild Arabs were led by theoretical notions to keep  pedigrees of their horses? Why have pedigrees been scrupulously kept and  published of the Shorthorn cattle, and more recently of the Hereford breed?  Is it an illusion that these recently improved animals safely transmit  their excellent qualities even when crossed with other breeds? have the  Shorthorns, without good reason, been purchased at immense prices and  exported to almost every quarter of the globe, a thousand guineas having  been given for a bull? With greyhounds pedigrees have likewise been kept,  and the names of such dogs, as Snowball, Major, &c., are as well known to  coursers as those of Eclipse and Herod on the turf. Even with the Gamecock  pedigrees of famous strains were formerly kept, and extended back for a  century. With pigs, the Yorkshire and Cumberland breeders \"preserve and  print pedigrees;\" and to show how such highly-bred animals are valued, I  may mention that Mr. Brown, who won all the first prizes for small breeds  at Birmingham in 1850, sold a young sow and boar of his breed to Lord Ducie  for 43 guineas; the sow alone was afterwards sold to the Rev. F. Thursby  for 65 guineas; who writes, \"she paid me very well, having sold her produce  for 300_l_., and having now four breeding sows from her.\"[3] Hard cash paid  down, over and over again, is an excellent test of inherited superiority.  In fact, the whole art of breeding, from which such great results have been  attained during the present century, depends on the inheritance of each  small {4} detail of structure. But inheritance is not certain; for if it  were, the breeder's art[4] would be"]]]
