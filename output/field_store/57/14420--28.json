[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/2892"],[0,"Irish Fairy Tales (#2)"],[1,"of time in Ireland, and of the bearing of  Partholon, the son of Noah's son.\"    \"I have almost forgotten him,\" said Tuan. \"A greatly bearded, greatly  shouldered man he was. A man of sweet deeds and sweet ways.\"    \"Continue, my love,\" said Finnian.    \"He came to Ireland in a ship. Twenty-four men and twenty-four women  came with him. But before that time no man had come to Ireland, and in  the western parts of the world no human being lived or moved. As we drew  on Ireland from the sea the country seemed like an unending forest. Far  as the eye could reach, and in whatever direction, there were trees; and  from these there came the unceasing singing of birds. Over all that land  the sun shone warm and beautiful, so that to our sea-weary eyes, our  wind-tormented ears, it seemed as if we were driving on Paradise.    \"We landed and we heard the rumble of water going gloomily through the  darkness of the forest. Following the water we came to a glade where  the sun shone and where the earth was warmed, and there Partholon rested  with his twenty-four couples, and made a city and a livelihood.    \"There were fish in the rivers of Eire', there were animals in her  coverts. Wild and shy and monstrous creatures ranged in her plains and  forests. Creatures that one could see through and walk through. Long we  lived in ease, and we saw new animals grow,--the bear, the wolf, the  badger, the deer, and the boar.    \"Partholon's people increased until from twenty-four couples there came  five thousand people, who lived in amity and contentment although they  had no wits.\"    \"They had no wits!\" Finnian commented.    \"They had no need of wits,\" Tuan said.    \"I have heard that the first-born were mindless,\" said Finnian.  \"Continue your story, my beloved.\"    \"Then, sudden as a rising wind, between one night and a morning, there  came a sickness that bloated the stomach and purpled the skin, and on  the seventh day all of the race of Partholon were dead, save one man  only.\" \"There always escapes one man,\" said Finnian thoughtfully.    \"And I am that man,\" his companion affirmed.    Tuan shaded his brow with his hand, and he remembered backwards through  incredible ages to the beginning of the world and the first days of  Eire'. And Finnian, with his blood again running chill and his scalp  crawling uneasily, stared backwards with him.        CHAPTER V    \"Tell on, my love,\" Finnian murmured    \"I was alone,\" said Tuan. \"I was so alone that my own shadow frightened  me. I was so alone that the sound of a bird in flight, or the creaking  of a dew-drenched bough, whipped me to cover as a rabbit is scared to  his burrow.    \"The creatures of the forest scented me and knew I was alone. They stole  with silken pad behind my back and snarled when I faced them; the long,  grey wolves with hanging tongues and staring eyes chased me to my cleft  rock; there was no creature so weak but it might hunt me, there was no  creature so timid but it might outface me. And so I lived for two tens  of years and two years, until I knew all that a beast surmises and had  forgotten all that a man had known.    \"I could pad as gently as any; I could run as tirelessly. I could be  invisible and patient as a wild cat crouching among leaves; I could  smell danger in my sleep and leap at it with wakeful claws; I could bark  and growl and clash with my teeth and tear with them.\"    \"Tell on, my beloved,\" said Finnian, \"you shall rest in God, dear  heart.\"    \"At the end of that time,\" said Tuan, \"Nemed the son of Agnoman came to  Ireland with a fleet of thirty-four barques, and in each barque there  were thirty couples of people.\"    \"I have heard it,\" said Finnian.    \"My heart leaped for joy when I saw the great fleet rounding the land,  and I followed them along scarped cliffs, leaping from rock to rock like  a wild goat, while the ships tacked and swung seeking a harbour. There I  stooped to drink at a pool, and I saw myself in the chill water.    \"I saw that I was hairy and tufty and bristled as a savage boar; that I  was lean as a stripped bush; that I was greyer than a badger; withered  and wrinkled like an empty sack; naked as a fish; wretched as a starving  crow in winter; and on my fingers and toes there were great curving  claws, so that I looked like nothing that was known, like nothing that  was animal or divine. And I sat by the pool weeping my loneliness and  wildness and my stern old age; and I could do no more than cry and  lament between the earth and the sky, while the beasts that tracked me  listened from behind the trees, or crouched among bushes to stare at me  from their drowsy covert.    \"A storm arose, and when I looked again from my tall cliff I saw that  great fleet rolling as in a giant's hand. At times they were pitched  against the sky and staggered aloft, spinning gustily there like  wind-blown leaves. Then they were hurled from these dizzy tops to the  flat, moaning gulf, to the glassy, inky horror that swirled and whirled  between ten waves. At times a wave leaped howling under a ship, and with  a buffet dashed it into air, and chased it upwards with thunder stroke  on stroke, and followed again, close as a chasing wolf, trying with  hammering on hammering to beat in the wide-wombed bottom and suck out  the frightened lives through one black gape. A wave fell on a ship and  sunk it down with a thrust, stern as though a whole sky had tumbled at  it, and the barque did not cease to go down until it crashed and sank in  the sand at the bottom of the sea.    \"The night came, and with it a thousand darknesses fell from the  screeching sky. Not a round-eyed creature of the night might pierce an  inch of that multiplied gloom. Not a creature dared creep or stand. For  a great wind strode the world lashing its league-long whips in cracks  of thunder, and singing to itself, now in a world-wide yell, now in an  ear-dizzying hum and buzz; or with a long snarl and whine it hovered  over the world searching for life to destroy.    \"And at times, from the moaning and yelping blackness of the sea, there  came a sound--thin-drawn as from millions of miles away, distinct as  though uttered in the ear like a whisper of confidence--and I knew that  a drowning man was calling on his God as he thrashed and was battered  into silence, and that a blue-lipped woman was calling on her man as her  hair whipped round her brows and she whirled about like a top.    \"Around me the trees were dragged from earth with dying groans; they  leaped into the air and flew like birds. Great waves whizzed from the  sea: spinning across the cliffs and hurtling to the earth in monstrous  clots of foam; the very rocks came trundling and sidling and grinding  among the trees; and in that rage, and in that horror of blackness I  fell asleep, or I was beaten into slumber.\"        CHAPTER VI    \"THERE I dreamed, and I saw myself changing into a stag in dream, and  I felt in dream the beating of a new heart within me, and in dream I  arched my neck and braced my powerful limbs.    \"I awoke from the dream, and I was that which I had dreamed.    \"I stood a while stamping upon a rock, with my bristling head swung  high, breathing through wide nostrils all the savour of the world. For  I had come marvellously from decrepitude to strength. I had writhed from  the bonds of age and was young again. I smelled the turf and knew for  the first time how sweet that smelled. And like lightning my moving nose  sniffed all things to my heart and separated them into knowledge.    \"Long I stood there, ringing my iron hoof on stone, and learning all  things through my nose. Each breeze that came from the right hand or the  left brought me a tale. A wind carried me the tang of wolf, and against  that smell I stared and stamped. And on a wind there came the scent of  my own kind, and at that I belled. Oh, loud and clear and sweet was the  voice of the great stag. With what ease my lovely note went lilting.  With what joy I heard the answering call. With what delight I bounded,  bounded, bounded; light as a bird's plume, powerful as a storm, untiring  as the sea.    \"Here now was ease in ten-yard springings, with a swinging head, with  the rise and fall of a swallow, with the curve and flow and urge of an  otter of the sea. What a tingle dwelt about my heart! What a thrill spun  to the lofty points of my antlers! How the world was new! How the sun  was new! How the wind caressed me!    \"With unswerving forehead and steady eye I met all that came. The old,  lone wolf leaped sideways, snarling, and slunk away. The lumbering bear  swung his head of hesitations and thought again; he trotted his small  red eye away with him to a near-by brake. The stags of my race fled from  my rocky forehead, or were pushed back and back until their legs broke  under them and I trampled them to death. I was the beloved, the well  known, the leader of the herds of Ireland.    \"And at times I came back from my boundings about Eire', for the strings  of my heart were drawn to Ulster; and, standing away, my wide nose took  the air, while I knew with joy, with terror, that men were blown on the  wind. A proud head hung to the turf then, and the tears of memory rolled  from a large, bright eye.    \"At times I drew near, delicately, standing among thick leaves or  crouched in long grown grasses, and I stared and mourned as I looked on  men. For Nemed and four couples had been saved from that fierce storm,  and I saw them increase and multiply until four thousand couples lived  and laughed and were riotous in the sun, for the people of Nemed had  small minds but great activity. They were savage fighters and hunters.    \"But one time I came, drawn by that intolerable anguish of memory, and  all of these people were gone: the place that knew them was silent: in  the land where they had moved there was nothing of them but their bones  that glinted in the sun.    \"Old age came on me there.
