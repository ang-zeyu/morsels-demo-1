I'll let you keep it if you will give me that sharp knife in  exchange for it.\"    The cat gave Mr. Rabbit the knife and he started out into the deep  forest with it. \"I've lost my tail but I've gained a knife,\" said he;  \"I'll get a new tail or something else just as good.\"    Mr. Rabbit hopped along through the forest for a long time and at last  he came to a little old man who was busily engaged in making baskets.  He was making the baskets out of rushes and he was biting them off  with his teeth. He looked up and spied Mr. Rabbit with the knife in  his mouth.    \"O, please, Mr. Rabbit,\" said he, \"will you not be so kind as to let  me borrow that sharp knife you are carrying? It is very hard work to  bite the rushes off with my teeth.\"    Mr. Rabbit let him take the knife. He started to cut off the rushes  with it, when _snap_ went the knife! It broke into halves.    \"O, dear! O, dear!\" cried Mr. Rabbit. \"What shall I do! What shall I  do! You have broken my nice new knife.\"    The little old man said that he was very sorry and that he did not  mean to do it.    Then Mr. Rabbit said, \"A broken knife is of no use to me but perhaps  you can use it, even if it is broken. I'll tell you what I'll do.  I'll let you keep the knife if you will give me one of your baskets in  exchange for it.\"    The little old man gave Mr. Rabbit a basket and he started on through  the deep forest with it. \"I lost my tail but I gained a knife. I've  lost my knife but I've gained a basket,\" said he. \"I'll get a new tail  or something else just as good.\"    Mr. Rabbit hopped along through the deep forest for a long time until  at last he came to a clearing. Here there was an old woman busily  engaged in picking lettuce. When she had gathered it she put it into  her apron. She looked up and spied Mr. Rabbit hopping along with his  basket.    \"O, please, Mr. Rabbit,\" said she, \"will you not be so kind as to let  me borrow that nice basket you are carrying?\"    Mr. Rabbit let her take the basket. She began to put her lettuce into  it when out fell the bottom of the basket.    \"O, dear! O, dear!\" cried Mr. Rabbit. \"What shall I do! What shall I  do! You have broken the bottom out of my nice new basket.\"    The old woman said that she was very sorry and that she did not mean  to do it.    Then said Mr. Rabbit, \"I'll tell you what I'll do. I'll let you keep  that broken basket if you will give me some of your lettuce.\"    The old woman gave Mr. Rabbit some lettuce and he hopped along with  it, saying, \"I lost my tail but I gained a knife. I lost my knife but  I gained a basket. I lost my basket but I gained some lettuce.\"    The rabbit was getting very hungry and how nice the lettuce smelled!  He took a bite. It was just the very best thing he had ever tasted in  all his life. \"I don't care if I did lose my tail,\" said he, \"I've  found something I like very much better.\"    From that day to this no rabbit has ever had a tail. Neither has there  ever been a rabbit who cared because he had no tail. From that time to  this there has never been a rabbit who did not like lettuce to eat and  who was not perfectly happy and contented if there was plenty of it.          III    How the Toad Got His Bruises      Once upon a time, ages and ages ago, the toad had a smooth skin. In  those days he was a great gad about. He never could be found in his  own house. If any one had a party he was sure to go, no matter how far  away from home it was held, or how long it took to get there.    One day the toad received an invitation to attend a party in the sky.  \"You never can get to this party,\" said his friend, the armadillo.  \"You know how slowly you travel here upon earth.\"    \"Wait and see whether or not I go to the party,\" said the toad.    Not far from the toad's house there lived a big black buzzard. No one  liked the buzzard. He was very unpopular with all the birds and  beasts. The toad hopped over to the buzzard's house. The buzzard was  outside the door making music on his violin.    \"Good morning, Friend Buzzard,\" said the toad. \"Are you going to  attend the party in the sky?\"    The buzzard replied that he was planning to go.    \"That is good,\" said the toad. \"May I have the pleasure of your  company for the trip?\"    The buzzard was delighted to have the toad seek his company. It was a  new experience.    \"I'll be charmed to go to the party with you,\" replied the buzzard.  \"What time shall we start?\"    \"We'll start at four o'clock,\" said the toad. \"Come to my house and  we'll go on from there. Be sure to bring your violin with you.\"    Promptly at four o'clock the buzzard arrived at the toad's house. He  had his violin with him, of course, because the toad had asked him to  bring it.    \"I'm not quite ready to go,\" the toad called out. \"Just leave your  violin there by the door and step inside. It will take me only a  minute to finish my toilet.\"    The buzzard laid his violin carefully outside the door and went inside  the toad's house. The toad jumped through the window and hid himself  inside the violin.    The buzzard waited and waited for the toad to get ready but he did not  hear a word from the toad. Finally he got tired of waiting. He picked  up his violin and started.    When he arrived at the party he was a trifle late but he explained how  he had waited for the toad.    \"How foolish to wait a minute for the toad,\" said his hosts. \"How  could the toad ever get to a party in the sky? We just asked him as a  joke because he is such a great gad about. Lay down your violin and  come to the feast.\"    The buzzard laid down his violin. As soon as there was no one looking,  out hopped the toad. He was laughing from ear to ear. \"So they  thought I would not come to the party! What a joke! How surprised they  will be to see me here!\" he said.    There was nobody at the feast who was as gay as the toad. When the  buzzard asked how he arrived he said: \"I'll tell you some other day.\"  Then he went on eating and dancing.    The buzzard did not have a very good time at the party. He decided  that he would go home early. He went away without saying good-bye to  his hosts and without taking his violin with him.    At the end of the party the toad hopped inside the violin and waited  and waited for the buzzard to take him home. Nobody picked up the  violin and the toad began to be very much worried. He almost wished  he had not come.    After a while the falcon noticed the violin. \"That violin belongs to  the buzzard. He must have forgotten to take it home. I'll carry it  back for him,\" he said.    The falcon flew towards earth with the violin. The toad shook about  terribly inside of the violin. He got very tired. The falcon got  tired, too.    \"I'm not going to carry this heavy old violin of the buzzard's another  minute,\" said the falcon. \"I was foolish to offer to carry it in the  first place. The buzzard is no friend of mine.\"    He let the violin fall. Down, down toward earth it fell.    \"O, little stones, O, little stones, get out of my way,\" called the  toad as he fell. The little stones had deaf ears. They did not get  out of the way.    When the toad crawled out of the wrecked violin he was so covered with  bruises that he could hardly hop home.    The buzzard never knew what became of his violin or why the toad had  lost his good looks. To this very day the toad shows his bruises. And  he is entirely cured of being a gad about.          IV    How the Tiger Got His Stripes      Once upon a time, ages and ages ago, so long ago that the tiger had no  stripes upon his back and the rabbit still had his tail, there was a  tiger who had a farm. The farm was very much overgrown with underbrush  and the owner sought a workman to clear the ground for him to plant.    The tiger called all the beasts together and said to them when they  had assembled, \"I need a good workman at once to clear my farm of the  underbrush. To the one of you who will do this work I offer an ox in  payment.\"    The monkey was the first one to step forward and apply for the  position. The tiger tried him for a little while but he was not a good  workman at all. He did not work steadily enough to accomplish  anything. The tiger discharged him very soon and he did not pay him.    Then the tiger hired the goat to do the work. The goat worked  faithfully enough but he did not have the brains to do the work well.  He would clear a little of the farm in one place and then he would go  away and work on another part of it. He never finished anything  neatly. The tiger discharged him very soon without paying him.    Next the tiger tried the armadillo. The armadillo was very strong and  he did the work well. The trouble with him was that he had such an  appetite. There were a great many ants about the place and the  armadillo could never pass by a sweet tender juicy ant without  stopping to eat it. It was lunch time all day long with him. The tiger  discharged him and sent him away without paying him anything.    At last the rabbit applied for the position. The tiger laughed at him  and said, \"Why, little rabbit, you are too small to do the work. The  monkey, the goat, and the armadillo have all failed to give  satisfaction. Of course a little beast like you will fail too.\"    However, there were no other beasts who applied for the position so  the tiger sent for the rabbit and told him that he would try him for a  little while.    The rabbit worked faithfully and well, and soon he had cleared a  large portion of the ground. The next day he worked just as well. The  tiger thought that he had been very lucky to hire the rabbit. He got  tired staying around to watch the rabbit work. The rabbit seemed to  know just how to do the work anyway, without orders, so the tiger"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/24717"],[0,"Danger! A True History of a Great City's Wiles and Temptations (#2)"],[1,",  and the pummelings I got and gave at school, I am young again--only my  waist is a good deal more expansive, my step is not so elastic or my  sight so clear. I could recall the names of some of those boys with whom  I fought in those happy school days, and tell how one now adorns the  British bench, how another holds a cabinet portfolio, how another fell  bravely fighting in Africa, and how several, striving neither for name  or fame,            \"Along the cool, sequestered vale of life          Pursue the noiseless tenor of their way\";    but it would be useless, as would also my experiences at church,  listening to my good father's sermons, and falling constantly asleep.    My youthful reminiscences of events which happened, and of which I heard  or read in my youth, are mostly chaotic and incongruous; but it is  otherwise with the murders. I remember with what thrilling interest I  read the story of Greenacre, who cut up the body of his victim, carrying  the head wrapped up in a handkerchief, on his knees in the omnibus, and  who was supposed to have nearly fainted with fright when, on asking the  conductor the fare, received the answer, \"Sixpence a _head!_\" Then there  was the horrible Daniel Good, the coachman at Roehampton, and the  monster Courvoisier, the Swiss valet, who murdered his master, Lord  William Russell. These atrocities and the trials at Old Bailey, no  doubt, gave my mind the bent for the criminal law, not that I was in any  sense conscious of the possession of superior powers. It was merely the  selective tendency of a fresh and buoyant mind, rather vigorous than  contemplative, and in which the desire for a special field of action is  but the symptom of health.    At the age of twenty, I entered King's College, London, with the son of  the great American statesman and historian, Edward Everett, and  succeeded in graduating with some distinction. Soon after, I entered the  office of Mr. George Waugh, a noted barrister. 1 had the good fortune to  meet the commendation of Mr. Waugh, and I was consequently placed at the  head of his corps of assistants, and frequently appeared in the English  courts in place of my employer. My connection with this office lasted  about eight years, and then, in pursuance of an intention long prior  formed and never relinquished, I returned to the country of my birth. My  earliest essays at the American bar have been fairly and impartially  told by another pen, and, as the autobiographical form of narrative has  its limitations as well as its advantages, the reader will pardon me if  in this place I drop the \"ego\" and quote:      \"On arriving here, Mr. Howe entered the office of E. H. Seeley, Esq.,  one of our oldest legal practitioners. Here he remained one year,  studying American law and practice with persistent assiduity, and  frequently appearing in our courts, 'by grace,' until he was fully  licensed. And it may be here stated that out of a list of over one  hundred candidates for admission to the bar only eighteen passed, and in  that number was included the young lawyer from London.    \"His first case of importance in this city was one of extreme delicacy,  being a test question as to whether Col. Walter W. Price, a wealthy  brewer, was entitled to the position of Colonel of the First Cavalry  Regiment, N. G. S. N. Y., he having received the _second_ highest number  of votes. Mr. Howe took the ground that his client was entitled to the  office, being a resident of this city, while his competitor, Smith, the  founder of the great umbrella house, who had received the largest number  of ballots, resided in Brooklyn. This question was argued before the  Brigade Court, and, its decision being adverse, Mr. Howe carried the  case to the Court of Appeals, where a favorable decision was rendered,  and Mr. Price duly installed in the position. This was the young  lawyer's first technical victory of note, and it brought him almost at  once into considerable prominence.    \"He soon after opened an office at the corner of Chambers and Centre  streets, devoted his entire time and energy to civil matters, was highly  successful, and soon achieved a considerable share of popularity. In  1859, finding himself crowded with business, he removed to his present  large suite of offices on the corner of Centre and Leonard streets,  which had formerly been occupied by the late Judge Russell, and from  that time down to the present he has made criminal matters a specialty.    \"Mr. Howe's first appearance in the New York courts as a criminal lawyer  was in 1859. A man, by the name of Devine, had been tried and convicted  in the Court of Special Sessions on a charge of larceny. He took  Devine's case to the General Term of the Supreme Court, contending that  the conviction was illegal, inasmuch as the statute provides that  _three_ justices should sit, whereas at the trial of Devine but _two_  had attended. Many members of the bar laughed at him, declaring his  position untenable. In this he was opposed by Assistant District  Attorney, the present Chief Justice, Sedgwick. The Court decided the  point well taken and ordered the discharge of the prisoner, Devine.    \"In defending a German named Jacob Weiler, indicted for the murder of  his wife, by shooting, in 1862, Mr. Howe took the ground that the  deceased shot herself, a discharged pistol being found by her side. This  case was very thoroughly canvassed by the entire press of the city, and  occasioned the greatest excitement among the German population. The  trial lasted eight days, and resulted in a disagreement of the jury. At  this stage of the proceedings, owing to a misunderstanding (which it  would hardly be in good taste to explain at this late day), Mr. Howe  withdrew from the defense. Other counsel were substituted, when the case  was re-tried, and the prisoner was convicted and sentenced to state  prison for life.    \"Mr. Howe has tried more capital cases than any six lawyers in America  combined. There has not been a murder case of note for the past  twenty-five years in which he has not appeared as counsel. The records  of the Courts of Oyer and Terminer and General Sessions show that he has  tried more than three hundred homicide cases since the year 1860. Mr.  Howe, as a specialist in diseases of the brain, is regarded by  physicians as the peer of the most eminent alienists in practice.\"      The circumstances under which Mr. A. H. Hummel became associated with  me, first as an office boy, in 1863, at a salary of two dollars per  week, and subsequently, in May, 1869, as my partner, have been told more  than once in the public press. Mr. Hummel was born in Boston, July 27,  1849; came, with his parents, to this city at an early age; attended  Public School No. 15, on East Fifth street, and made my acquaintance on  a January morning before he was fourteen years old. I have at hand a  newspaper clipping, taken from the Rochester, N. Y., _Democrat and  Chronicle_ of March 25, 1877, in which is printed an elaborate notice of  the law firm of Howe & Hummel, in which the junior partner is thus  characterized:      \"Soon after Mr. Howe opened his office, a bright lad, conversant with  foreign languages, applied on a cold January morning, in the year 1863,  for employment, and was accepted. His duties as office boy were to  answer questions, make fires, do errands, and do copying  andtranslations. Such was his winning address, his ready tact, his quick  perceptions, his prudence and discretion, that he not only performed his  duties to perfection but, in his few spare moments, learned law. While  he grew but little in stature, he made great progress in his chosen  profession. As he had fluent command of the German language--a useful  adjunct to the practice of a criminal lawyer in New York--and gave  promise of attaining a high rank as an advocate, Mr. Howe made him his  partner before he was admitted to the bar. To-day, in stature, he is  probably the smallest professional man in America; but size is not 'the  standard of the man,' and if Abe's stature were in proportion to his  merit he would be a veritable giant indeed.\"      With this sentiment I most cordially coincide, and at the same time  bring these somewhat rambling and discursive reminiscences to an end.    WILLIAM F. HOWE.        DANGER!        CHAPTER I.    ANCIENT AND MODERN PRISONS.    _Some of the City's Ancient Prisons--How Malefactors were Formerly  Housed--Ancient Bridewells and Modern Jails._    From old Dutch and Knickerbocker records it appears that as far back as  the year 1600 there existed a place for the confinement of malefactors  in the City of New York. At that early date in its history the town must  certainly have been restricted to a half dozen or so of narrow, crooked  streets, in the immediate vicinity of what is now known as the Bowling  Green. The population did not, probably, number more than a few  thousands; but, nevertheless, we find from these same records that, even  in that small community, criminals were so numerous and crime so rife  that a jail or Bridewell had already been established for the  safe-keeping and punishment of evildoers, and a system of citizen-police  inaugurated for the preservation of the local peace.    It was not, however, until some years later, 1642, that the \"Staat Huys\"  was built, a municipal building, with a portion of it erected especially  for the housing of dangerous criminals. Thus it would seem that for  upwards of two centuries crime and criminals have had their haunts in  this city, and, it is safe to say, while the more ancient cities of  Europe have, unquestionably, originated more felons of every grade,  there are few places that can rival New York in the number of actual  crimes committed during its comparatively brief existence on the earth's  map.    During the earlier history of the embryo city, the nature of the  offenses perpetrated on the then small community, and the type of"]]]
