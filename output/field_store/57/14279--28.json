His very presence would protect me in case of any undesirable  meeting. And besides, I was very glad to know what a brigand was really  like. One doesn't come across such gentry every day. And there is a  certain charm about finding one's self in close proximity to a dangerous  being, especially when one feels the being in question to be gentle and  tame.    I was hoping the stranger might gradually fall into a confidential  mood, and in spite of my guide's winks, I turned the conversation to  the subject of highwaymen. I need scarcely say that I spoke of them with  great respect. At that time there was a famous brigand in Andalusia, of  the name of Jose-Maria, whose exploits were on every lip. \"Supposing I  should be riding along with Jose-Maria!\" said I to myself. I told all  the stories I knew about the hero--they were all to his credit, indeed,  and loudly expressed my admiration of his generosity and his valour.    \"Jose-Maria is nothing but a blackguard,\" said the stranger gravely.    \"Is he just to himself, or is this an excess of modesty?\" I queried,  mentally, for by dint of scrutinizing my companion, I had ended by  reconciling his appearance with the description of Jose-Maria which I  read posted up on the gates of various Andalusian towns. \"Yes, this must  be he--fair hair, blue eyes, large mouth, good teeth, small hands, fine  shirt, a velvet jacket with silver buttons on it, white leather gaiters,  and a bay horse. Not a doubt about it. But his _incognito_ shall be  respected!\" We reached the _venta_. It was just what he had described  to me. In other words, the most wretched hole of its kind I had as yet  beheld. One large apartment served as kitchen, dining-room, and sleeping  chamber. A fire was burning on a flat stone in the middle of the room,  and the smoke escaped through a hole in the roof, or rather hung in a  cloud some feet above the soil. Along the walls five or six mule rugs  were spread on the floor. These were the travellers' beds. Twenty paces  from the house, or rather from the solitary apartment which I have just  described, stood a sort of shed, that served for a stable.    The only inhabitants of this delightful dwelling visible at the moment,  at all events, were an old woman, and a little girl of ten or twelve  years old, both of them as black as soot, and dressed in loathsome rags.  \"Here's the sole remnant of the ancient populations of Munda Boetica,\"  said I to myself. \"O Caesar! O Sextus Pompeius, if you were to revisit  this earth how astounded you would be!\"    When the old woman saw my travelling companion an exclamation of  surprise escaped her. \"Ah! Senor Don Jose!\" she cried.    Don Jose frowned and lifted his hand with a gesture of authority that  forthwith silenced the old dame.    I turned to my guide and gave him to understand, by a sign that no one  else perceived, that I knew all about the man in whose company I was  about to spend the night. Our supper was better than I expected. On  a little table, only a foot high, we were served with an old rooster,  fricasseed with rice and numerous peppers, then more peppers in oil,  and finally a _gaspacho_--a sort of salad made of peppers. These three  highly spiced dishes involved our frequent recourse to a goatskin filled  with Montella wine, which struck us as being delicious.    After our meal was over, I caught sight of a mandolin hanging up against  the wall--in Spain you see mandolins in every corner--and I asked the  little girl, who had been waiting on us, if she knew how to play it.    \"No,\" she replied. \"But Don Jose does play well!\"    \"Do me the kindness to sing me something,\" I said to him, \"I'm  passionately fond of your national music.\"    \"I can't refuse to do anything for such a charming gentleman, who gives  me such excellent cigars,\" responded Don Jose gaily, and having made  the child give him the mandolin, he sang to his own accompaniment. His  voice, though rough, was pleasing, the air he sang was strange and sad.  As to the words, I could not understand a single one of them.    \"If I am not mistaken,\" said I, \"that's not a Spanish air you have just  been singing. It's like the _zorzicos_ I've heard in the Provinces,* and  the words must be in the Basque language.\"    * The _privileged Provinces_, Alava, Biscay, Guipuzcoa, and a part of  Navarre, which all enjoy special _fueros_. The Basque language is spoken  in these countries.    \"Yes,\" said Don Jose, with a gloomy look. He laid the mandolin down on  the ground, and began staring with a peculiarly sad expression at the  dying fire. His face, at once fierce and noble-looking, reminded me,  as the firelight fell on it, of Milton's Satan. Like him, perchance,  my comrade was musing over the home he had forfeited, the exile he had  earned, by some misdeed. I tried to revive the conversation, but so  absorbed was he in melancholy thought, that he gave me no answer.    The old woman had already gone to rest in a corner of the room, behind  a ragged rug hung on a rope. The little girl had followed her into this  retreat, sacred to the fair sex. Then my guide rose, and suggested that  I should go with him to the stable. But at the word Don Jose, waking, as  it were, with a start, inquired sharply whither he was going.    \"To the stable,\" answered the guide.    \"What for? The horses have been fed! You can sleep here. The senor will  give you leave.\"    \"I'm afraid the senor's horse is sick. I'd like the senor to see it.  Perhaps he'd know what should be done for it.\"    It was quite clear to me that Antonio wanted to speak to me apart.    But I did not care to rouse Don Jose's suspicions, and being as we  were, I thought far the wisest course for me was to appear absolutely  confident.    I therefore told Antonio that I knew nothing on earth about horses, and  that I was desperately sleepy. Don Jose followed him to the stable, and  soon returned alone. He told me there was nothing the matter with the  horse, but that my guide considered the animal such a treasure that he  was scrubbing it with his jacket to make it sweat, and expected to spend  the night in that pleasing occupation. Meanwhile I had stretched myself  out on the mule rugs, having carefully wrapped myself up in my own  cloak, so as to avoid touching them. Don Jose, having begged me to  excuse the liberty he took in placing himself so near me, lay down  across the door, but not until he had primed his blunderbuss afresh and  carefully laid it under the wallet, which served him as a pillow.    I had thought I was so tired that I should be able to sleep even in such  a lodging. But within an hour a most unpleasant itching sensation roused  me from my first nap. As soon as I realized its nature, I rose to my  feet, feeling convinced I should do far better to spend the rest of  the night in the open air than beneath that inhospitable roof. Walking  tiptoe I reached the door, stepped over Don Jose, who was sleeping the  sleep of the just, and managed so well that I got outside the building  without waking him. Just beside the door there was a wide wooden  bench. I lay down upon it, and settled myself, as best I could, for the  remainder of the night. I was just closing my eyes for a second time  when I fancied I saw the shadow of a man and then the shadow of a horse  moving absolutely noiselessly, one behind the other. I sat upright, and  then I thought I recognised Antonio. Surprised to see him outside the  stable at such an hour, I got up and went toward him. He had seen me  first, and had stopped to wait for me.    \"Where is he?\" Antonio inquired in a low tone.    \"In the _venta_. He's asleep. The bugs don't trouble him. But what are  you going to do with that horse?\" I then noticed that, to stifle all  noise as he moved out of the shed, Antonio had carefully muffled the  horse's feet in the rags of an old blanket.    \"Speak lower, for God's sake,\" said Antonio. \"You don't know who that  man is. He's Jose Navarro, the most noted bandit in Andalusia. I've been  making signs to you all day long, and you wouldn't understand.\"    \"What do I care whether he's a brigand or not,\" I replied. \"He hasn't  robbed us, and I'll wager he doesn't want to.\"    \"That may be. But there are two hundred ducats on his head. Some lancers  are stationed in a place I know, a league and a half from here, and  before daybreak I'll bring a few brawny fellows back with me. I'd have  taken his horse away, but the brute's so savage that nobody but Navarro  can go near it.\"    \"Devil take you!\" I cried. \"What harm has the poor fellow done you that  you should want to inform against him? And besides, are you certain he  is the brigand you take him for?\"    \"Perfectly certain! He came after me into the stable just now, and said,  'You seem to know me. If you tell that good gentleman who I am, I'll  blow your brains out!' You stay here, sir, keep close to him. You've  nothing to fear. As long as he knows you are there, he won't suspect  anything.\"    As we talked, we had moved so far from the _venta_ that the noise of the  horse's hoofs could not be heard there. In a twinkling Antonio snatched  off the rags he had wrapped around the creature's feet, and was just  about to climb on its back. In vain did I attempt with prayers and  threats to restrain him.    \"I'm only a poor man, senor,\" quoth he, \"I can't afford to lose two  hundred ducats--especially when I shall earn them by ridding the country  of such vermin. But mind what you're about! If Navarro wakes up, he'll  snatch at his blunderbuss, and then look out for yourself! I've gone too  far now to turn back. Do the best you can for yourself!\"    The villain was in his saddle already, he spurred his horse smartly, and  I soon lost sight of them both in the darkness.
