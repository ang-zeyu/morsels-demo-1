If you  can find out the truth, it will result that the sad one is matter-of-fact,  and has no imagination--he can only think of his work and what concerns  him personally; but the merry one would surprise you if you could read his  thoughts--if you could know the distances they have passed over, and what  a vast difference there is between his thought and his work. So while it  is natural for almost every one to exclaim joyfully at the beauty of  pictures, and to enjoy looking at them simply, I wish my readers to think  of their uses also, and understand the benefits that may be derived from  them. I have only hinted at a few of these uses, but many others will  occur to you.    When pictures are composed of beautiful colors, such as we usually think  of when we speak of the art of painting, the greatest charm of pictures is  reached, and all civilized people have admired and encouraged this art. It  is true that the remains of ancient art now existing are principally those  of architecture or sculpture, yet there are a sufficient number of  pictures in color to prove how old the art of painting is.      EGYPT.    Egyptian painting is principally found on the walls of temples and tombs,  upon columns and cornices, and on small articles found in burial places.  There is no doubt that it was used as a decoration; but it was also  intended to be useful, and was so employed as to tell the history of the  country;--its wars, with their conquests and triumphs, and the lives of  the kings, and many other stories, are just as distinctly told by pictures  as by the hieroglyphics or Egyptian writings. We can scarcely say that  Egyptian painting is beautiful; but it certainly is very interesting.    [Illustration: FIG. 2.--KING RAMESSES II. AND HIS SONS STORMING A FORTRESS.  _From Abousimbel._]    The Egyptians had three kinds of painting: one on flat surfaces, a second  on bas-reliefs, or designs a little raised and then colored, and a third  on designs in _intaglio_, or hollowed out from the flat surface and the  colors applied to the figures thus cut out. They had no knowledge of what  we call perspective, that is, the art of representing a variety of objects  on one flat surface, and making them appear to be at different distances  from us--and you will see from the illustrations given here that their  drawing and their manner of expressing the meaning of what they painted  were very crude. As far as the pictorial effect is concerned, there is  very little difference between the three modes of Egyptian painting; their  general appearance is very nearly the same.    The Egyptian artist sacrificed everything to the one consideration of  telling his story clearly; the way in which he did this was sometimes very  amusing, such as the making one man twice as tall as another in order to  signify that he was of high position, such as a king or an officer of high  rank. When figures are represented as following each other, those that are  behind are frequently taller than those in front, and sometimes those that  are farthest back are ranged in rows, with the feet of one row entirely  above the heads of the others. This illustration of the storming of a fort  by a king and his sons will show you what I mean. The sons are intended to  be represented as following the father, and are in a row, one above the  other (Fig. 2).    For the representation of water, a strip of blue filled in with  perpendicular zigzag black lines was used. From these few facts you can  understand how unformed and awkward Egyptian pictures seem if we compare  them with the existing idea of what is beautiful. There appear to have  been certain fixed rules for the use of colors, and certain objects were  always painted in the colors prescribed for them. The background of a  picture was always of a single, solid color; Egyptian men were painted in  a reddish brown, and horses were of the same shade; women were generally  yellow, sometimes a lighter brown than the men; negroes were black, the  Asiatic races yellow, and but one instance is known of a white skin, blue  eyes, and yellow hair. The draperies about the figures were painted in  pleasing colors, and were sometimes transparent, so that the figures could  be seen through them.    The execution of Egyptian paintings was very mechanical. One set of  workmen prepared the plaster on the wall for the reception of the colors;  another set drew all the outlines in red; then, if chiselling was to be  done, another class performed this labor; and, finally, still others put  on the colors. Of course nothing could be more matter-of-fact than such  painting as this, and under such rules an artist of the most lofty genius  and imagination would find it impossible to express his conceptions in his  work. We know all this because some of these pictures exist in an  unfinished condition, and are left in the various stages of execution;  then, too, there are other pictures of the painters at their work, and all  these different processes are shown in them. The outline drawing is the  best part of Egyptian painting, and this is frequently very cleverly done.    As I have intimated, the greatest value of Egyptian painting is that it  gives us a clear record of the habits and customs of a very ancient  people--of a civilization which has long since passed away, and of which  we should have a comparatively vague and unsatisfactory notion but for  this picture-history of it. The religion, the political history, and the  domestic life of the ancient Egyptians are all placed before us in these  paintings. Through a study of them we know just how they hunted and  fished, gathered their fruits, tilled the soil, and cooked the food,  played games, danced, and practised gymnastics, conducted their scenes of  festivity and mourning--in short, how they lived under all circumstances.  Thus you see that Egyptian painting is a very important example of the way  in which pictures can teach us; you will also notice that it is not even  necessary that they should be pretty in order that we may learn from  them.    Another use made of Egyptian painting was the illustration of the papyrus  rolls upon which historical and other documents were written. These rolls,  found in the tombs, are now placed in museums and collections of curious  things; the paintings upon them may be called the oldest book  illustrations in the world. Sometimes a single color is used, such as red  or black; but others are in a variety of colors which have been put on  with a brush. Indeed, some rolls exist which have pictures only, and are  entirely without hieroglyphics or writing characters; one such is more  than twenty yards long, and contains nothing but pictures of funeral  ceremonies.    The ancient Egyptians were so serious a people that it is a pleasant  surprise to find that some of these pictures are intended for jokes and  satires, somewhat like those of the comic papers of to-day; for example,  there is one in the British Museum, London, representing cats and rats  fighting, which is intended to ridicule the soldiers and heroes of the  Egyptian army.    One cannot study Egyptian painting without feeling sorry for the painters;  for in all the enormous amount of work done by them no one man was  recognized--no one is now remembered. We know some of the names of great  Egyptian architects which are written in the historical rolls; but no  painter's name has been thus preserved. The fact that no greater progress  was made is a proof of the discouraging influences that must have been  around these artists, for it is not possible that none of them had  imagination or originality: there must have been some whose souls were  filled with poetic visions, for some of the Egyptian writings show that  poetry existed in ancient Egypt. But of what use could imagination be to  artists who were governed by the laws of a narrow priesthood, and hedged  about by a superstitious religion which even laid down rules for art?    For these reasons we know something of Egyptian art and nothing of  Egyptian artists, and from all these influences it follows that Egyptian  painting is little more than an illuminated alphabet or a child's  picture-history. In the hieroglyphics, or writing characters of Egypt, it  often occurs that small pictures of certain animals or other objects stand  for whole words, and it appears that this idea was carried into Egyptian  painting, which by this means became simply a picture chronicle, and never  reached a point where it could be called truly artistic or a high art.      ASSYRIA.    The remains of Assyrian painting are so few that they scarcely serve any  other purpose than to prove that the Assyrians were accustomed to decorate  their walls with pictures. Sometimes the walls were prepared with plaster,  and the designs were painted on that; in other cases the painting was done  upon the brick itself. The paintings on plaster were usually on the inner  walls, and many of these which have been discovered during the excavations  have disappeared when exposed to the air after their long burial from the  sight and knowledge of the world.    Speaking of these pictures, the writer on art, J. Oppert, says that some  paintings were found in the Palace of Sargon; they represented gods,  lions, rosettes, and various other designs; but when he reached Nineveh,  one year after these discoveries, the pictures had all disappeared--the  colors which had been buried twenty-five hundred years lasted but a few  days after they were uncovered.    [Illustration: FIG. 3.--FRAGMENT OF AN ASSYRIAN TILE-PAINTING.]    Assyrian tile-painting was more durable than the wall-painting; but in  all the excavations that have been made these have been found only in  fragments, and from these fragments no complete picture has been put  together. The largest one was found at Nimrud, and our illustration is  taken from it. It represents a king, as we know by the"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/24728"],[0,"Stories Of Georgia (#2)"],[1," industrious turn, than those  left behind in Florida and along the southern boundary of Georgia.    As De Soto marched along, he seized Indians and made guides of them,  or made prisoners and held them until he was furnished with guides and  interpreters. He also announced to the Indians that he was the Child of  the Sun, who had been sent to seek out the greatest Prince and Princess.  This made a great impression on the Indians, many of whom were sun  worshipers.    Many times during the march the Spaniards were on the point of  starvation, and the account of their sufferings as set forth in the  history of the expedition is intended to be quite pathetic. We need  not pause to shed any tears over these things, for the sufferings the  Spaniards endured were nothing compared to the sufferings they inflicted  on the Indians. They murdered and robbed right and left, and no doubt  the Indians regarded them as demons rather than Christians. More  than once when the Spaniards were wandering aimlessly about in the  wilderness, they were found by the Indians and saved from starvation. In  turn the simple-minded natives were treated with a harshness that would  be beyond belief if the sickening details were not piously set forth by  the Spanish historian of the expedition.    [Illustration: Indian Queen 020]    About the 28th of April the expedition reached the neighborhood of  Cutifachiqui, having been told by three Indians whom they had taken,  that the queen of that province knew of the approach of the Spaniards,  and was awaiting them at her chief town just across the river. As De  Soto came to the shore of the stream, four canoes started from the  opposite side. One of them contained a kinswoman of the queen, who  had been selected to invite the Spaniards to enter the town. Shortly  afterwards the queen came forth from the town, seated on a palanquin or  litter, which was borne by the principal men. Coming to the water side,  the queen entered a canoe, over the stern of which was stretched an  awning to shelter her from the sun.    Under this awning she reclined on cushions; and thus, in company with  her chiefs, and attended by many of her people in canoes, she crossed  the river to meet De Soto. She landed, and gave the Spaniard a gracious  welcome. As an offering of peace and good will, she took from her neck  a long string of pearls, and gave the gems to De Soto. She also gave him  many shawls and finely dressed deerskins. The Spaniard acknowledged the  beautiful gifts by taking from his hand a gold ring set with a ruby, and  placing it upon one of the queen's fingers.    The old historian pretends that De Soto and his men were very much  impressed by the dignity and courtesy of the Indian queen. She was the  first woman ruler they had met in their wanderings. She was tall, finely  formed, and had great beauty of countenance. She was both gracious and  graceful. All this is set down in the most pompous way by the Spanish  chroniclers; but the truth seems to be that De Soto and his men cared  nothing for the courtesy and hospitality of the queen, and that they  were not moved by her beauty and kindness. The Spaniards crossed the  river in canoes furnished by the queen's people, and found themselves  surrounded by the most hospitable Indians they had yet seen. They were  supplied with everything the land afforded, and rested in comfortable  wigwams under the shade of mulberry trees. The soldiers were so  delighted with the situation, that they were anxious to form a  settlement there; but De Soto refused to forget the only object of  the expedition, which was to search for gold and other treasures. His  determination had the desired effect His men recovered their energies.  While enjoying the hospitality of the queen, they found out the burial  places of her people, and gathered from the graves, according to the  statement of the Spanish historian, \"three hundred and fifty weight of  pearls, and figures of babies and birds, made from iridescent shells.\"    The mother of the queen lived not far from the town where the Spaniards  were quartered, and, as she was said to be the owner of many fine  pearls, De Soto expressed a desire to see her. Upon hearing this, the  queen sent twelve of her principal men to beg her mother to come to  see the white strangers and the wonderful animals they had brought  with them; but the mother of the queen was very shrewd. She rebuked the  messengers, and sent them back with some sharp words for her daughter;  and though De Soto did his best to capture the woman, he was never able  to carry out his purpose.    He then turned his attention to a temple that stood on the side of  a deserted settlement which had formerly been the chief town of the  queen's people. This temple, as described by the Spanish chronicler,  was more than one hundred steps long by forty broad, the walls high in  proportion, and the roof elevated so as to allow the water to run off.  On the roof were various shells arranged in artistic order, and the  shells were connected by strings of pearls. These pearls extended from  the top of the roof to the bottom in long festoons, and the sun shining  on them produced a very brilliant effect. At the door of the temple were  twelve giant-like statues made of wood. These figures were so ferocious  in their appearance, that the Spaniards hesitated for some time before  they could persuade themselves to enter the temple. The statues were  armed with clubs, maces, copper axes, and pikes ornamented with copper  at both ends. In the middle of the temple were three rows of chests,  placed one upon another in the form of pyramids. Each pyramid consisted  of five or six chests, the largest at the bottom, and the smallest at  the top. These chests, the Spanish chroniclers say, were filled with  pearls, the largest containing the finest pearls, and the smallest only  seed pearls.    It is just as well to believe a little of this as to believe a great  deal. It was an easy matter for the survivors of the expedition to  exaggerate these things, and they probably took great liberties with  the facts; but there is no doubt that the Indians possessed many pearls.  Mussels like those from which they took the gems are still to be found  in the small streams and creeks of Georgia, and an enterprising  boy might even now be able to find a seed pearl if he sought for it  patiently.    It is not to be doubted that rich stores of pearls were found. Some were  distributed to the officers and men; but the bulk of them, strange to  say, were left undisturbed, to await the return of the Spaniards another  day. De Soto was still intent on searching for gold, and he would hear  of nothing else. He would neither settle among the queen's people for a  season, nor return to Tampa with the great store of pearls discovered.  Being a resolute man and of few words, he had his way, and made  preparations to journey farther north to the province called Chiaha,  which was governed by a great Indian king. The conduct of the Spaniards  had been so cruel during their stay at Cutifachiqui, that the queen had  come to regard them with fear and hatred, and she refused to supply  them with guides and burden bearers. De Soto thereupon placed her under  guard; and when he took up his march for Chiaha, the queen who had  received him with so much grace, dignity, and hospitality, was compelled  to accompany him on foot, escorted by her female attendants. The old  Spanish chronicler is moved to remark that \"it was not so good usage  as she deserved for the good will she shewed and the good entertainment  that she had made him.\" This was the return the Spanish leader made  to the queen who had received and entertained his army,--to seize her,  place her under guard, and compel her to accompany his expedition on  foot.    One reason why De Soto made the queen his prisoner and carried her with  the expedition was to use her influence in controlling the Indians along  his line of march. The result was all that he could have expected. In  all the towns through which the Spaniards passed, the queen commanded  the Indians to carry the burdens of the army; and thus they went for a  hundred leagues, the Indians obeying the queen without question. After a  march of seven days, De Soto arrived at the province of Chelaque, which  was the country of the Cherokees. Here the soldiers added to their  stores of provisions, and renewed their march; and on May 15 they  arrived in the province of Xualla, the chief town of which is supposed  to have been situated in the Nacoochee valley. Inclining his course  westwardly from the Nacoochee valley, De Soto set out for Guaxule, which  marked the limit of the queen's dominion, and which has been identified  as Old Town, in Murray County. On this march the queen made her escape,  taking with her a cane box filled with large pearls of great value. This  box had been borne by one of the queen's attendants up to the moment  when she disappeared from the Spanish camp. De Soto made every effort  to recapture the queen. No doubt the bloodhounds, which formed a part of  the expedition, were called in to aid in the search; but it was all to  no purpose. The queen hid herself as easily as a young partridge hides,  and neither men nor dogs could find her. De Soto went on his way,  deploring the loss of the valuable pearls.    From Nacoochee to Murray County the march was fatiguing. The route lay  over mountains as well as valleys. One of the foot soldiers, Juan Terron  (his folly has caused history to preserve his name), grew so weary on  this march, that he drew from his wallet a linen bag containing six  pounds of pearls. Calling to a cavalryman, Juan Terron offered him the  bag of pearls if he would carry them. The cavalryman refused the offer,  and told his comrade to keep them. But Juan Terron would not have it so.  He untied the bag, whirled it around his head, and scattered the pearls  in all"]]]
