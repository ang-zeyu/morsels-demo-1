With it he built  for himself a shelter from the elements; it provided him with fuel and  oft-times food, and the tree cut down and let across a stream formed  the first bridge. From it, too, he made his \"dug-out\" to travel along  and across the rivers of the district in which he dwelt; so on down  through the ages, for shipbuilding and constructive purposes, timber  has continued to our own time to be one of the most largely used of  nature's products.    Although wood has been in use so long and so universally, there still  exists a remarkable lack of knowledge regarding its nature, not only  among ordinary workmen, but among those who might be expected to know  its properties. Consequently it is often used in a faulty and wasteful  manner. Experience has been almost the only teacher, and  theories--sometimes right, sometimes wrong--rather than well  substantiated facts, lead the workman.    One reason for this imperfect knowledge lies in the fact that wood is  not a homogeneous material, but a complicated structure, and so  variable, that one piece will behave very differently from another,  although cut from the same tree. Not only does the wood of one species  differ from that of another, but the butt cut differs from that of the  top log, the heartwood from the sapwood; the wood of quickly-grown  sapling of the abandoned field, from that of the slowly-grown, old  monarch of the forest. Even the manner in which the tree was cut and  kept influences its behavior and quality. It is therefore extremely  difficult to study the material for the purpose of establishing  general laws.    The experienced woodsman will look for straight-grained, long-fibred  woods, with the absence of disturbing resinous and coloring matter,  knots, etc., and will quickly distinguish the more porous red or black  oaks from the less porous white species, _Quercus alba_. That the  inspection should have regard to defects and unhealthy conditions  (often indicated by color) goes without saying, and such inspection is  usually practised. That knots, even the smallest, are defects, which  for some uses condemn the material entirely, need hardly be mentioned.  But that \"season-checks,\" even those that have closed by subsequent  shrinkage, remain elements of weakness is not so readily appreciated;  yet there cannot be any doubt of this, since these, the intimate  connections of the wood fibres, when once interrupted are never  reestablished.    Careful woods-foremen and manufacturers, therefore, are concerned as  to the manner in which their timber is treated after the felling, for,  according to the more or less careful seasoning of it, the season  checks--not altogether avoidable--are more or less abundant.

Such history only tends to produce conceit, national  impudence, superciliousness and patriotic stupidity, all of which is in  full bloom in our great Republic.    Our aim is to teach a different conception of historical events. To  define them as an ever-recurring struggle for Freedom against every form  of Might. A struggle resultant from an innate yearning for  self-expression, and the recognition of one's own possibilities and  their attitude toward other human beings. History to us means a  compilation of experiences, out of which the individual, as well as the  race, will gain the right understanding how to shape and organize a mode  of life best suited to bring out the finest and strongest qualities of  the human race.           *       *       *       *       *    +The American Brutus+ is, of course, a business man and has no time to  overthrow Caesar. Recently, however, the imperialistic stew became hot  and too much for him. The marriage of Miss Alice Roosevelt produced such  a bad odor of court gossip, as to make the poor American Brutus ill with  nausea. He grew indignant, draped his sleeve in mourning, and with  gloomy mien and clenched fists, went about prophesying the downfall of  the Republic.    Between ourselves, the number of those who still believe in the American  Republic can be counted on one's fingers. One has either pierced through  the lie, all for the people and by the people--in that case one must  become a Revolutionist; or, one has succeeded in putting one's bounty  in safety--then he is a conservative. \"No disturbances, please. We are  about to close a profitable contract.\" Modern bourgeoisie is absolutely  indifferent as to who is to be their political boss, just so they are  given opportunity to store their profits, and accumulate great wealth.  Besides, the cry about the decline of the great Republic is really  meaningless. As far as it ever stood for liberty and well-being of the  people, it has long ceased to be. Therefore lamentations come too late.  True, the American Republic has not given birth to an aristocracy. It  has produced the power of the parvenu, not less brutal than European  aristocracy, only narrower in vision and not less vulgar in taste.    Instead of mourning one ought to rejoice that the latest display of  disgusting servility has completely thrown off the mantle of liberty and  independence of Dame Columbia, now exposed before the civilized world in  all her slavish submissiveness.           *       *       *       *       *    +The storm in Russia+ has frightened many out of their warm bed-clothes.    A real Revolution in these police-regulated times. More than one voice  was raised against the possibility of a Revolution, and they who dared  to predict it were considered fit for the lunatic asylum.    The workingmen, peasants and students of Russia, however, have proven  that the calculations of the \"wise\" contained a hitch somewhere. A  Revolution swept across the country and did not even stop to ask  permission of those in authority.    Authority and Power are now taking revenge on their daring sons and  daughters. The Cossacks, at the command of the \"good Czar\" are  celebrating a bloody feast--knouting, shooting, clubbing people to  death, dragging great masses to prisons and into exile, and it is not  the fault of that vicious idiot on the throne, nor that of his advisors,  Witte and the others, if the Revolution still marches on, head erect.  Were it in their power, they would break her proud neck with one  stroke, but they cannot put the heads of a hundred million people on the  block, they cannot deport eighty millions of Peasants to Siberia, nor  can they order all the workingmen in the industrial districts shot. Were  the working bees to be killed, the drones would perish of  starvation--that is why the Czar of the Peace Treaty still suffers some  of his people to live?----           *       *       *       *       *    +In Mayville, Wis.+, a transvaluation society has been formed, the purpose  of which is, to bring about the transvaluation of all values in matters  of love and the relations of the sexes. The members of this society are  to contribute by word and deed towards the breaking of all barriers that  prevent an ideal and healthy conception of love.    The president of this society, Emil Ruedebusch, known in this country  through his work, \"The Old and New Ideal,\" which, by the way, was  confiscated upon the grounds of obscenity and the author put on trial.  It is an undisputed fact that robust, graft-greedy Columbia abhors every  free expression on love or marriage. Emil Ruedebusch, like many others  who have dared to lift the veil of hypocrisy, was condemned to a heavy  fine. A second work of the author, \"Die Eigenen,\" was published in  Germany.    His idea, that the relation of the sexes must be freed from the  oppressing fetters of a lame morality that degrades every human emotion  to the plane of utility and purpose, I heartily endorse. His method of  achieving the ideal seems to me too full of red tape. However, I welcome  every effort against the conspiracy of ignorance, hypocrisy and stupid  prudery, against the simplest manifestation of nature.    [Illustration]          The Tragedy of Woman's Emancipation    By EMMA GOLDMAN      I begin my article with an admission: Regardless of all political and  economic theories, treating of the fundamental differences between the  various groups within the human race, regardless of class and race  distinctions, regardless of all artificial boundary lines between  woman's rights and man's rights, I hold that there is a point where  these differentiations may meet and grow into one perfect whole.    With this I do not mean to propose a peace treaty. The general social  antagonism which has taken hold of our entire public life to-day,  brought about through the force of opposing and contradictory interests,  will crumble to pieces when the reorganization of our social life, based  upon the principles of economic justice, shall have become a reality.    Peace and harmony between the sexes and individuals does not necessarily  depend on a superficial equalization of human beings; nor does it call  for the elimination of individual traits or peculiarities. The problem  that confronts us to-day, and which the nearest future is to solve, is  how to be oneself, and yet in oneness with others, to feel deeply with  all human beings and still retain one's own innate qualities. This seems  to me the basis upon which the mass and the individual, the true  democrat and the true individuality, man and woman can meet without  antagonism and opposition. The motto should not be forgive one another;  it should be, understand one another. The oft-quoted sentence of Mme. de  Stael: \"To understand everything means to forgive everything,\" has never  particularly appealed to me; it has the odor of the confessional; to  forgive one's fellow being conveys the idea of pharisaical superiority.  To understand one's fellow being suffices. This admission partly  represents the fundamental aspect of my views on the emancipation of  woman and its effect upon the entire sex.    Emancipation should make it possible for her to be human in the truest  sense. Everything within her that craves assertion and activity should  reach its fullest expression; and all artificial barriers should be  broken and the road towards greater freedom cleared of every trace of  centuries of submission and slavery.    This was the original aim of the movement for woman's emancipation. But  the results so far achieved have isolated woman and have robbed her of  the fountain springs of that happiness which is so essential to her.  Merely external emancipation has made of the modern woman an artificial  being who reminds one of the products of French arboriculture with its  arabesque trees and shrubs--pyramids, wheels and wreaths; anything  except the forms which would be reached by the expression of their own  inner qualities. Such artificially grown plants of the female sex are to  be found in large numbers, especially in the so-called intellectual  sphere of our life.    Liberty and equality for woman! What hopes and aspirations these words  awakened when they were first uttered by some of the noblest and bravest  souls of those days. The sun in all its light and glory was to rise upon  a new world; in this world woman was to be free to direct her own  destiny, an aim certainly worthy of the great enthusiasm, courage,  perseverance and ceaseless effort of the tremendous host of pioneer men  and women, who staked everything against a world of prejudice and  ignorance.    My hopes also move towards that goal, but I insist that the emancipation  of woman, as interpreted and practically applied to-day, has failed to  reach that great end. Now, woman is confronted with the necessity of  emancipating herself from emancipation, if she really desires to be  free. This may sound paradoxical, but is, nevertheless, only too true.    What has she achieved through her emancipation? Equal suffrage in a few  states. Has that purified our political life, as many well-meaning  advocates have predicted? Certainly not. Incidentally it is really time  that persons with plain, sound judgment should cease to talk about  corruption in politics in a boarding-school tone. Corruption of politics  has nothing to do with the morals or the laxity of morals of various  political personalities. Its cause is altogether a material one.  Politics is the reflex of the business and industrial world, the mottoes  of which are: \"to take is more blessed than to give\"; \"buy cheap and  sell dear\"; \"one soiled hand washes the other.\" There is no hope that  even woman, with her right to vote, will ever purify politics.    Emancipation has "]]]
