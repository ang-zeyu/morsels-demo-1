[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/24614"],[0,"The Science of Fairy Tales (#2)"],[1,"these  brilliant works. But it would be literary criticism, a thing widely  different from the scientific treatment of Fairy Tales. The Science of  Fairy Tales is concerned with tradition, and not with literature. It  finds its subjects in the stories which have descended from mouth to  mouth from an unknown past; and if reference be occasionally made to  works of conscious literary art, the value of such works is not in the  art they display, but the evidence they yield of the existence of given  tales in certain forms at periods and places approximately capable of  determination: evidence, in a word, which appropriates and fixes a  pre-existing tradition. But even in this they are inferior in importance  to historical or topographical works, where we frequently meet with  records of the utmost importance in considering the origin and meaning  of Folk-tales.    Literature, in short, of whatever kind, is of no value to the student of  Fairy Tales, as that phrase is here used, save as a witness to  Tradition. Tradition itself, however, is variable in value, if regard be  had alone to purity and originality. For a tribe may conceivably be so  isolated that it is improbable that any outside influence can have  affected its traditions for a long series of generations; or on the  other hand it may be in the highway of nations. It may be physically of  a type unique and unalloyed by foreign blood; or it may be the progeny  of a mingling of all the races on the earth. Now it is obvious that if  we desire to reason concerning the wide distribution, or the innate and  necessary character of any idea, or of any story, the testimony of a  given tribe or class of men will vary in proportion to its segregation  from other tribes and classes: where we can with most probability  exclude outside influence as a factor in its mental evolution, there we  shall gather evidence of the greatest value for the purpose of our  argument.    Again: some nations have developed the art of story-telling more highly  than others, since some stages of civilization are more favourable to  this development than others, and all nations are not in the same stage.  The further question may, therefore, be put whether these various stages  of development may not produce differences of manner in  story-telling--differences which may indicate, if they do not cause,  deep-seated differences in the value of the traditions themselves. To  make my meaning clear: a people which requires its story-tellers to  relate their stories in the very words in which they have been conveyed  from time immemorial, and allows no deviation, will preserve its  traditions with the least possible blemish and the least possible  change. In proportion as latitude in repetition is permitted and  invention is allowed to atone for want of memory, tradition will change  and become uncertain. Such latitude may be differently encouraged by  different social states. A social state is part of, and inseparable  from, the sum total of arts, knowledge, organization and customs which  we call the _civilization_, or the _stage of civilization_, of a people.  It may be worth while to spend a short time in examining the mode of  story-telling and the requirements of a story-teller among nations in  different stages of civilization. We shall thus endeavour to appreciate  the differences in the manner of telling, and to ascertain in general  terms how far these differences affect the value of the traditions.    If we turn first to some of the Celtic nations, we find a social state  in which the art of story-telling has received a high degree of  attention. The late Mr. J. F. Campbell, to whom the science of Folklore  owes an incalculable debt, describes a condition of things in the  Western Highlands extremely favourable to the cultivation of  folk-tales. Quoting from one of his most assiduous collectors, he says  that most of the inhabitants of Barra and South Uist are Roman  Catholics, unable to speak English or to read or write. Hence it is  improbable that they can have borrowed much from the literature of other  nations. Among these people in the long winter nights the recitation of  tales is very common. They gather in crowds at the houses of those who  are reputed to be good tale-tellers. Their stories frequently relate to  the exploits of the Ossianic heroes, of whose existence they are as much  convinced as ordinary English folk are of the existence and deeds of the  British army in its most recent wars. During the tales \"the emotions of  the reciters are occasionally very strongly excited, and so also are  those of the listeners, almost shedding tears at one time, and giving  way to loud laughter at another. A good many of them firmly believe in  all the extravagance of these stories.\" Another of his collectors, a  self-educated workman in the employ of the Duke of Argyll, writing more  than thirty years ago to him, speaks of what used to take place about  Loch Lomond upwards of fifty years before--that is to say, about the  beginning of the present century. The old people then would pass the  winter evenings telling each other traditional stories. These chiefly  concerned freebooters, and tribal raids and quarrels, and included  descriptions of the manners, dress and weapons of their ancestors and  the hardships they had to endure. The youngsters also would gather, and  amuse themselves with games or the telling of tales of a more romantic  cast. But the chief story-tellers appear to have been the tailors and  shoemakers, who were literally journeymen, going from house to house in  search of work. As they travelled about, they picked up great numbers of  tales, which they repeated; \"and as the country people made the telling  of these tales, and listening to hear them, their winter night's  amusement, scarcely any part of them would be lost.\" In these tales  Gaelic words were often used which had dropped out of ordinary  parlance, giving proof of careful adherence to the ancient forms; and  the writer records that the previous year he had heard a story told  identical with one he had heard forty years before from a different man  thirty miles away; and this story contained old Gaelic words the meaning  of which the teller did not know. A gamekeeper from Ross-shire also  testified to similar customs at his native place: the assemblies of the  young to hear their elders repeat, on winter nights, the tales they had  learned from their fathers before them, and the renown of the travelling  tailor and shoemaker. When a stranger came to the village it was the  signal for a general gathering at the house where he stayed, to listen  to his tales. The goodman of the house usually began with some favourite  tale, and the stranger was expected to do the rest. It was a common  saying: \"The first tale by the goodman, and tales to daylight by the  guest.\" The minister, however, came to the village in 1830, and the  schoolmaster soon followed, with the inevitable result of putting an end  to these delightful times.[1]    Not very different is the account given by M. Luzel of the _Veillees_ in  which he has often taken part in Brittany. In the lonely farmhouse after  the evening meal prayers are said, and the life in Breton of the saint  of the day read, all the family assemble with the servants and labourers  around the old-fashioned hearth, where the fire of oaken logs spirts and  blazes, defying the wind and the rain or snow without. The talk is of  the oxen and the horses and the work of the season. The women are at  their wheels; and while they spin they sing love ditties, or ballads of  more tragic or martial tone. The children running about grow tired of  their games, and of the tedious conversation of their elders, and demand  a tale, it matters not what, of giants, or goblins, or witches--nay,  even of ghosts. They are soon gratified; and if an old man, as  frequently happens, be the narrator, he is fortified and rewarded for  the toil by a mug of cider constantly replenished. One such depositary  of tradition is described as a blind beggar, a veritable Homer in wooden  shoon, with an inexhaustible memory of songs and tales of every kind. He  was welcome everywhere, in the well-to-do farmhouse as in the humble  cottage. He stayed as long as he pleased, sometimes for whole weeks; and  it was with reluctance that he was allowed to leave in order to become  for a time the charm of another fireside, where he was always awaited  with impatience.[2]    M. Braga, the Portuguese scholar, quotes an old French writer, Jean le  Chapelain, as recording a custom in Normandy similar to that of  Ross-shire, that the guest was always expected to repay hospitality by  telling tales or singing songs to his host. And he states that the  emigrants from Portugal to Brazil took this custom with them. In Gascony  M. Arnaudin formed his collection of tales a few years ago by assisting  at gatherings like those just described in Brittany, as well as at  marriages and at various agricultural festivals.[3]    Similar customs existed in Wales within living memory, and in remote  districts they probably exist to-day. If they do not now continue in  England, it is at least certain that our forefathers did not differ in  this respect from their neighbours. A writer of the seventeenth century,  in enumerating the causes of upholding \"the damnable doctrine of  witchcraft,\" mentions: \"Old wives' fables, who sit talking and chatting  of many false old stories of Witches and Fairies and Robin Goodfellow,  and walking spirits and the dead walking again; all of which lying  fancies people are more naturally inclined to listen after than to the  Scriptures.\" And if we go further back we find in chapter clv. of the  printed editions of the \"Gesta Romanorum\" an interesting picture of  domestic life.

We  have an evidence of the antiquity of the site in some Roman  _tesserae_, discovered in 1832, while a grave was being dug in the  south-east corner of the churchyard, and still preserved in the  pavement, near the entrance, in the south aisle of the choir. These  _tesserae_, with the pottery, tiles, coins, lachrymatories, sepulchral  urns, etc., excavated from time to time in and about the church, are  clear indications of an important Roman settlement.    It is known that after the destruction of Roman London by Boadicea, a  great many Romans made their escape into Southwark, where they  continued to live, and contributed greatly to the size and importance  of the southern suburb. The principal buildings sprang up round the  site of St. Saviour's Church, and it has been reasonably conjectured  that a temple stood on the very spot that the church now occupies.[1]    It is true that no trace of this temple has been discovered; but the  conjecture is not inconsistent with the known principles of the early  Christian missionaries, in their contact with paganism, as illustrated  in the history and traditions of other important churches.    Stow's phrase, \"long before the Conquest,\" though somewhat ambiguous,  has been thought to point to a date posterior to the Roman occupation.  Some authorities, therefore, contend that the Romans had erected  London Bridge and left the country before St. Mary's was founded, and  consequently the bridge the antiquary mentions as built by \"Swithun, a  noble lady,\" was not the first. Again, it is doubtful whether the  sub-title \"Overie\" means \"of the ferry,\" or \"over the river,\" or  whether the form \"Overies,\" which the word sometimes takes, does not  suggest a derivation from \"Ofers,\" \"of the bank or shore,\" a meaning  contained in the modern German _Ufer_. John Overy, or Overs, was the  father of Mary, but whether the surname was derived from the place, or  _vice versa_, is uncertain. In any case, the name, whether by accident  or design, includes a reference to the foundress as well as to the  locality of her foundation.[2]    Stow is obviously wrong, however, as to the person who converted the  House of Sisters into a College of Priests, who was not a lady, but  St. Swithun, Bishop of Winchester (852-862), whose devotion to the  building of churches and bridges is well known.    The character of the foundation, altered by St. Swithun, was again  altered in 1106, under Bishop William Giffard, with the co-operation  of the two Norman knights to whom Stow refers. They not only erected  the first Norman nave, but made a radical change within by abolishing  the \"College of Priests,\" in whose place they introduced \"Canons  regular\" of the Augustinian Order, governed by a Prior, thus  transforming the Collegiate Church into a monastery. Except as regards  the sex of the inmates, the change was a reversion to the idea of the  foundress.[3]    The Norman work of this period is the earliest of which any traces  remain in the present church, unless the doubtful signs on a shaft in  the exterior are to be taken as evidence of Saxon workmanship. This  shaft is attached to the north wall of the Chapel of St.  John-the-Divine (now used as a clergy vestry), which is perhaps the  oldest part of the fabric. The undoubted Norman remains consist of  three arches in the same chapel, where their outline is just  discernible among the brickwork; the fragment of a string-course, with  billet moulding, on the inner wall of the north transept; a portion of  the Prior's entrance to the cloisters; the old Canons' doorway; and an  arcaded recess. Of these, it may be briefly remarked that the remains  of the Prior's door, showing the mutilated shafts and the zigzag  moulding of the jambs, are preserved, _in situ_, in the outer face of  the north wall to the new nave. The outline of the Canons' entrance,  obviously of much simpler moulding, will be seen on the inner side of  the same wall, towards the west end. The Norman recess lies still  farther to the west on the same side.    Quite recently a valuable relic of the same period has been discovered  in the north-east corner within the above-mentioned chapel (by the  side of the new Harvard window)--apparently part of the original  arcading to the apse.    Early in the thirteenth century London was visited by one of those  great fires, which occurred at rather frequent intervals, before the  greatest of all, in 1666, led to the rebuilding of the city, and  better means for its protection. The date of the particular fire is  sometimes given as 1207, sometimes as 1212 or 1213. It is not  unlikely that there were several, in one or other of which London  Bridge, Southwark, and the church were seriously injured. (_Vide_ Stow  and Harleian MSS., No. 565.)    The repairs were soon taken in hand by Peter de la Roche, otherwise de  Rupibus, Bishop of Winchester (1205-1238), who altered the nave into  the Early English, which was then generally superseding the heavier  Norman work, and shortly afterwards built the choir and retro-choir in  a still lighter and more ornate style. The architecture gives us the  approximate date of de la Roche's work as the early part of the  thirteenth century, which is about as near as we can get to it in the  absence of a more precise record than that it was \"begun after the  fire.\" In consequence of this, or some previous fire, the Canons were  led to found a hospital close to the Priory for the relief of the  distress and disease caused by the disaster. During the restorations  by Peter de Rupibus, in or about 1228, he had the hospital transferred  to a more favourable site in the neighbourhood, where the air was  fresher and water more abundant, and dedicated it to St. Thomas of  Canterbury, to whom the chapel on London Bridge was also dedicated.[4]    In addition to all this excellent work, Bishop de Rupibus built a  chapel for the parishioners, the conventual church being reserved for  the Prior and monks. This chapel stood in the angle between the walls  of the choir and south transept, and was called St. Mary Magdalene  Overy.    In the reign of Richard II there was another fire, involving repairs;  and then, as well as in the reign of Henry IV, Perpendicular features  were introduced by Cardinal Beaufort, Bishop of Winchester  (1405-1447), aided by John Gower, the \"Father of English Poetry.\" The  Cardinal is said to have restored the south transept at his own  expense, and is there commemorated in a sculptured representation of  his hat and coat of arms affixed to a pier by the door. The difference  in style between the two transepts shows that on the north to be of  somewhat earlier date, though it was probably not left untouched by  the restorers. The poet Gower founded a chantry in the Chapel of St.  John Baptist, in the north aisle, where he was eventually buried, and  where daily masses were said for the repose of his soul before the  Reformation. His monument was transferred to the south transept during  the \"repairs and beautifications\" of 1832, but is now restored to its  original place over the poet's remains in the fifth bay (from the  west), of the north aisle of the nave. The chapel and chantry have  unfortunately disappeared.    In 1469 the stone roof of the old nave fell down. The accident has  been attributed to the removal, in the reign of Richard II, of the  flying buttresses by which the vault was originally supported, as is  still the case with the choir walls. Another roof of groined oak was  soon substituted, as less likely to suffer from its own weight. That  it was not a specially light structure, however, may be inferred from  the massive bosses preserved from it, and now to be seen on the floor  of the north transept.       [Illustration: FORMER WESTERN DOORWAY.     _From Moss and Nightingale's \"History\"_ (1817-18).]    The crowning piece of work, which very shortly preceded the ruin  brought about by the Dissolution, was set upon the Priory Church by  Bishop Fox in 1520, in the magnificent altar-screen, which through all  its mutilations has borne witness to his work in his favourite device  of the \"Pelican in her piety,\" and the humorous allusion to his name,  in the figure of a man chasing a fox, among its sculptured ornaments.  The west end of the church was considerably altered, and a new western  doorway inserted, with a six-light window above it, at about the same  time; when also the upper stages of the tower were erected. The  window is said to have been altered for the worse in the seventeenth  century, and in its last phase the whole facade presented what Mr.  Dollman describes as \"a heterogeneous mass of masonry and brickwork,\"  not worth preserving when the modern restoration was taken in hand.  The flying buttresses have been reproduced in the new nave, and the  chief doorway placed in the south-west corner, which the architect was  led to believe was its original position.    It is generally admitted that by the sixteenth century the monastic  institutions had so far departed from the ideal of their founders, and  outlived their usefulness, as to call for some drastic measures for  their improvement. Steps had been taken from time to time with this  object, before the reign of Henry VIII, when a combination of  circumstances, into which we need not now enter, enabled the King to  carry out his scheme for the Dissolution of the monasteries,  comprising the two chief classes of abbeys and priories into which  they were divided. The coming storm was heralded at St. Mary's on 11th  November, 1535 on which date, \"by command of the king,\" a solemn  procession was held in the church to inaugurate its downfall by a  Litany, in which the Prior and Canons took part, \"with their crosses,  candlesticks and vergers before them,\" as if in mockery of the state  of which they were so soon to be deprived. The \"Act of Suppression,\"  passed in 1536, sealed the fate of the smaller"]]]
