No wonder that, once he becomes  original, he is accused of \"formlessness.\" Mozart! the seeker and the  finder, the great man with the childlike heart--it is he we marvel at,  to whom we are devoted; but not his Tonic and Dominant, his Developments  and Codas.                               *       *       *    Such lust of liberation filled Beethoven, the romantic revolutionary,  that he ascended one short step on the way leading music back to its  loftier self:--a short step in the great task, a wide step in his own  path. He did not quite reach absolute music, but in certain moments he  divined it, as in the introduction to the fugue of the Sonata for  Hammerclavier. Indeed, all composers have drawn nearest the true nature  of music in preparatory and intermediary passages (preludes and  transitions), where they felt at liberty to disregard symmetrical  proportions, and unconsciously drew free breath. Even a Schumann (of so  much lower stature) is seized, in such passages, by some feeling of the  boundlessness of this pan-art (recall the transition to the last  movement of the D-minor Symphony); and the same may be asserted of  Brahms in the introduction to the Finale of his First Symphony.    But, the moment they cross the threshold of the _Principal Subject_,  their attitude becomes stiff and conventional, like that of a man  entering some bureau of high officialdom.                               *       *       *    Next to Beethoven, Bach bears closest affinity to \"infinite music.\"[C]  His Organ Fantasias (but not the Fugues) have indubitably a strong dash  of what might be overwritten \"Man and Nature.\"[D] In him it appears most  ingenuous because he had no reverence for his predecessors (although he  esteemed and made use of them), and because the still novel acquisition  of equal temperament opened a vista of--for the time being--endless new  possibilities.      [C] \"Die Ur-Musik,\" is the author's happy phrase. But as this music    _never has been_, our English terms like \"primitive,\" \"original,\"    etc., would involve a _non sequitur_ which is avoided, at least, by    \"infinite.\" [Translator's Note.]      [D] In the recitatives of his Passions we hear \"human speech\"; _not_    \"correct declamation.\"    Therefore, Bach and Beethoven[E] are to be conceived as a _beginning_,  and not as unsurpassable finalities. In spirit and emotion they will  probably remain unexcelled; and this, again, confirms the remark at the  beginning of these lines: That spirit and emotion remain unchanged in  value through changing years, and that he who mounts to their uttermost  heights will always tower above the crowd.      [E] As characteristic traits of Beethoven's individuality I would    mention the poetic fire, the strong human feeling (whence springs his    revolutionary temper), and a portent of modern nervousness. These    traits are certainly opposed to those of a \"classic.\" Moreover,    Beethoven is no \"master,\" as the term applies to Mozart or the later    Wagner, just because his art foreshadows a greater, as yet incomplete.    (Compare the section next-following.)                               *       *       *    What still remains to be surpassed, is their form of expression and  their freedom. Wagner, a Germanic Titan, who touched our earthly horizon  in orchestral tone-effect, who intensified the form of expression, but  fashioned it into a _system_ (music-drama, declamation, leading-motive),  is on this account incapable of further intensification. His category  begins and ends with himself; first, because he carried it to the  highest perfection and finish; secondly, because his self-imposed task  was of such a nature, that it could be achieved by one man alone.[F] The  paths opened by Beethoven can be followed to their end only through  generations. They--like all things in creation--may form only a circle;  but a circle of such dimensions, that the portion visible to us seems  like a straight line. Wagner's circle we can view in its entirety--a  circle within the great circle.      [F] \"Together with the problem, it gives us the solution,\" as I once    said of Mozart.                               *       *       *    THE name of Wagner leads to program-music. This has been set up as a  contrast to so-called \"absolute\" music, and these concepts have become  so petrified that even persons of intelligence hold one or the other  dogma, without recognition for a third possibility beyond and above the  other two. In reality, program-music is precisely as one-sided and  limited as that which is called absolute. In place of architectonic and  symmetric formulas, instead of the relation of Tonic to Dominant, it has  bound itself in the stays of a connecting poetic--sometimes even  philosophic--program.                               *       *       *    Every motive--so it seems to me--contains, like a seed, its life-germ  within itself. From the different plant-seeds grow different families  of plants, dissimilar in form, foliage, blossom, fruit, growth and  color.[G]      [G] \"... Beethoven, dont les esquisses _thématiques ou élémentaires_    sont innombrables, mais qui, sitôt les thèmes trouvés, semble par cela    même en avoir établi tout le développement ...\" [Vincent d'Indy, in    \"César Franck.\"]    Even each individual plant belonging to one and the same species  assumes, in size, form and strength, a growth peculiar to itself. And  so, in each motive, there lies the embryo of its fully developed form;  each one must unfold itself differently, yet each obediently follows the  law of eternal harmony. _This form is imperishable, though each be  unlike every other._                               *       *       *    The motive in a composition with program bears within itself the same  natural necessity; but it must, even in its earliest phase of  development, renounce _its own proper mode of growth_ to mould--or,  rather, twist--itself to fit the needs of the program. Thus turned  aside, at the outset, from the path traced by nature, it finally arrives  at a wholly unexpected climax, whither it has been led, not by its own  organization, but by the way laid down in the program, or the action, or  the philosophical idea.    And how primitive must this art remain! True, there are unequivocal  descriptive effects of tone-painting (from these the entire principle  took its rise), but these means of expression are few and trivial,  covering but a very small section of musical art. Begin with the most  self-evident of all, the debasement of Tone to Noise in imitating the  sounds of Nature--the rolling of thunder, the roar of forests, the cries  of animals; then those somewhat less evident, symbolic--imitations of  visual impressions, like the lightning-flash, springing movement, the  flight of birds; again, those intelligible only through the mediation of  the reflective brain, such as the trumpet-call as a warlike symbol, the  shawm to betoken ruralism, march-rhythm to signify measured strides, the  chorale as vehicle for religious feeling. Add to the above the  characterization of nationalities--national instruments and airs--and we  have a complete inventory of the arsenal of program-music. Movement and  repose, minor and major, high and low, in their customary significance,  round out the list.--These are auxiliaries, of which good use can be  made upon a broad canvas, but which, taken by themselves, are no more to  be called music than wax figures may pass for monuments.                               *       *       *    And, after all, what can the presentation of a little happening upon  this earth, the report concerning an annoying neighbor--no matter  whether in the next room or in an adjoining quarter of the globe--have  in common with that music which pervades the universe?    To music, indeed, it is given to set in vibration our human moods: Dread  (_Leporello_), oppression of soul, invigoration, lassitude (Beethoven's  last Quartets), decision (_Wotan_), hesitation, despondency,  encouragement, harshness, tenderness, excitement, tranquillization, the  feeling of surprise or expectancy, and still others; likewise the inner  echo of external occurrences which is bound up in these moods of the  soul. But not the moving cause itself of these spiritual  affections;--not the joy over an avoided danger, not the danger itself,  or the kind of danger which caused the dread; an emotional state, yes,  but not the psychic species of this emotion, such as envy, or jealousy;  and it is equally futile to attempt the expression, through music, of  moral characteristics (vanity, cleverness), or abstract ideas like truth  and justice. Is it possible to imagine how a poor, but contented man  could be represented by music? The contentment, the soul-state, can be  interpreted by music; but where does the poverty appear, or the  important ethic problem stated in the words \"poor, but contented\"? This  is due to the fact that \"poor\" connotes a phase of terrestrial and  social conditions not to be found in the eternal harmony. And Music is a  part of the vibrating universe.                               *       *       *    I may be allowed to subjoin a few subsidiary reflections:--The greater  part of modern theatre music suffers from the mistake of seeking to  repeat the scenes passing on the stage, instead of fulfilling its own  proper mission of interpreting the soul-states of the persons  represented. When the scene presents the illusion of a thunderstorm,  this is exhaustively apprehended by the eye. Nevertheless, nearly all  composers strive to depict the storm in tones--which is not only a  needless and feebler repetition, but likewise a failure to perform their  true function. The person on the stage is either psychically influenced  by the thunderstorm, or his mood, being absorbed in a train of thought  of stronger influence, remains unaffected. The storm is visible and  audible without"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/31830"],[0,"Genera of Leptodactylid Frogs in México (#2)"],[1,"d; sternum cartilaginous,       lacking bony style; sphenethmoid not truncate anteriorly;       nasals in contact medially; maxillary and quadratojugal in       contact; anterior arm of squamosal not in contact with       maxillary; dermal cranial elements not involved in       integumentary-cranial co-ossification; prevomers large,       dentigerous processes present or not, dentate or not;       maxillary and premaxillary bones dentate; occipital condyles       separated; development direct.         _Composition._--About 420 names have been applied to frogs       of this genus; many of these names are synonyms, and many       other species remain undescribed and unnamed.

DISCUSSION      The preceding definitions only slightly alter the present generic  limits of Mexican leptodactylids. Two species, previously regarded as  _Eleutherodactylus_, are transferred to the new genus _Hylactophryne_.  The arrangement of the species of _Syrrhophus_ and _Tomodactylus_  remains the same as concluded by Dixon (1957), Duellman (1958), and  Firschein (1954) in their reviews of the genera.    Lumbo-inguinal glands are most prominent in the genera _Pleurodema_ and  _Tomodactylus_. Various nondescript glands are present in many genera,  but none is so well developed as those of _Pleurodema_ and  _Tomodactylus_.    At least nine leptodactylid genera are either known or thought to be  terrestrial breeders lacking a free-living tadpole stage  (_Eleutherodactylus_, _Euparkerella_, _Hylactophryne_, _Niceforonia_,  _Noblella_, _Sminthillus_, _Syrrhophus_, _Tomodactylus_ and  _Trachyphrynus_). _Niceforonia_ and _Trachyphrynus_, and probably  _Hylactophryne_, are not closely related to the other genera. Direct  development probably is an adaptation to adverse environmental  conditions since many of the species occur in semi-arid or cold (Andean  paramos) areas. _Eleutherodactylus_ is generally thought to be the  stock from which _Euparkerella_,"]]]
