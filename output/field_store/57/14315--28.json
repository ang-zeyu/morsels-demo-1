We traded in skins and whiskey, and I've often slept under the shade      Of that lone birch-tree on Bonanza, where the first big find was made.        \"We were just like a great big family, and every man had his squaw,      And we lived such a wild, free, fearless life beyond the pale of the            law;      Till sudden there came a whisper, and it maddened us every man,      And I got in on Bonanza before the big rush began.        \"Oh, those Dawson days, and the sin and the blaze, and the town all            open wide!      (If God made me in His likeness, sure He let the devil inside.)      But we all were mad, both the good and the bad, and as for the            women, well--      No spot on the map in so short a space has hustled more souls to hell.        \"Money was just like dirt there, easy to get and to spend.      I was all caked in on a dance-hall jade, but she shook me in the end.      It put me queer, and for near a year I never drew sober breath,      Till I found myself in the bughouse ward with a claim staked out on            death.        \"Twenty years in the Yukon, struggling along its creeks;      Roaming its giant valleys, scaling its god-like peaks;      Bathed in its fiery sunsets, fighting its fiendish cold,      Twenty years in the Yukon ... twenty years--and I'm old.        \"Old and weak, but no matter, there's 'hooch' in the bottle still.      I'll hitch up the dogs to-morrow, and mush down the trail to Bill.      It's so long dark, and I'm lonesome--I'll just lay down on the bed,      To-morrow I'll go ... to-morrow ... I guess I'll play on the red.        \"... Come, Kit, your pony is saddled. I'm waiting, dear, in the            court ...      ... Minnie, you devil, I'll kill you if you skip with that flossy            sport ...      ... How much does it go to the pan, Bill?... play up, School, and            play the game ...      ... Our Father, which art in heaven, hallowed be Thy name ...\"        _This was the song of the parson's son, as he lay in his bunk alone,      Ere the fire went out and the cold crept in, and his blue lips            ceased to moan,      And the hunger-maddened malamutes had torn him flesh from bone._          THE SPELL OF THE YUKON          I wanted the gold, and I sought it;        I scrabbled and mucked like a slave.      Was it famine or scurvy--I fought it,        I hurled my youth into the grave.      I wanted the gold and I got it--        Came out with a fortune last fall,--      Yet somehow life's not what I thought it,        And somehow the gold isn't all.        No! There's the land. (Have you seen it?)        It's the cussedest land that I know,      From the big, dizzy mountains that screen it,        To the deep, deathlike valleys below.      Some say God was tired when He made it;        Some say it's a fine land to shun;      Maybe: but there's some as would trade it        For no land on earth--and I'm one.        You come to get rich (damned good reason),        You feel like an exile at first;      You hate it like hell for a season,        And then you are worse than the worst.      It grips you like some kinds of sinning;        It twists you from foe to a friend;      It seems it's been since the beginning;        It seems it will be to the end.        I've stood in some mighty-mouthed hollow        That's plumb-full of hush to the brim;      I've watched the big, husky sun wallow        In crimson and gold, and grow dim,      Till the moon set the pearly peaks gleaming,        And the stars tumbled out, neck and crop;      And I've thought that I surely was dreaming,        With the peace o' the world piled on top.        The summer--no sweeter was ever;        The sunshiny woods all athrill;      The grayling aleap in the river,        The bighorn asleep on the hill.      The strong life that never knows harness;        The wilds where the caribou call;      The freshness, the freedom, the farness--        O God! how I'm stuck on it all.        The winter! the brightness that blinds you,        The white land locked tight as a drum,      The cold fear that follows and finds you,        The silence that bludgeons you dumb.      The snows that are older than history,        The woods where the weird shadows slant;      The stillness, the moonlight, the mystery,        I've bade 'em good-bye--but I can't.        There's a land where the mountains are nameless,        And the rivers all run God knows where;      There are lives that are erring and aimless,        And deaths that just hang by a hair;      There are hardships that nobody reckons;        There are valleys unpeopled and still;      There's a land--oh, it beckons and beckons,        And I want to go back--and I will.        They're making my money diminish;        I'm sick of the taste of champagne.      Thank God! when I'm skinned to a finish        I'll pike to the Yukon again.      I'll fight--and you bet it's no sham-fight;        It's hell!--but I've been there before;      And it's better than this by a damsite--        So me for the Yukon once more.        There's gold, and it's haunting and haunting;        It's luring me on as of old;      Yet it isn't the gold that I'm wanting,        So much as just finding the gold.      It's the great, big, broad land 'way up yonder,        It's the forests where silence has lease;      It's the beauty that thrills me with wonder,        It's the stillness that fills me with peace.          THE CALL OF THE WILD          Have you gazed on naked grandeur where there's nothing else to gaze on,        Set pieces and drop-curtain scenes galore,      Big mountains heaved to heaven, which the blinding sunsets blazon,        Black canyons where the rapids rip and roar?      Have you swept the visioned valley with the green stream streaking            through it,        Searched the Vastness for a something you have lost?      Have you strung your soul to silence? Then for God's sake go and do it;        Hear the challenge, learn the lesson, pay the cost.        Have you wandered in the wilderness, the sage-brush desolation,        The bunch-grass levels where the cattle graze?      Have you whistled bits of rag-time at the end of all creation,        And learned to know the desert's little ways?      Have you camped upon the foothills, have you galloped o'er the ranges,        Have you roamed the arid sun-lands through and through?      Have you chummed up with the mesa? Do you know its moods and changes?        Then listen to the wild--it's calling you.        Have you known the Great White Silence, not a snow-gemmed twig            a-quiver?        (Eternal truths that shame our soothing lies.)      Have you broken trail on snowshoes? mushed your huskies up the river,        Dared the unknown, led the way, and clutched the prize?      Have you marked the map's void spaces, mingled with the mongrel races,        Felt the savage strength of brute in every thew?      And though grim as hell the worst is, can you round it off with curses?        Then hearken to the wild--it's wanting you.        Have you suffered, starved, and triumphed grovelled, down, yet            grasped at glory,        Grown bigger in the bigness of the whole?      \"Done things\" just for the doing, letting babblers tell the story,        Seeing through the nice veneer the naked soul?      Have you seen God in His splendours, heard the text that nature            renders?        (You'll never hear it in the family pew.)      The simple things, the true things, the silent men who do things--        Then listen to the wild--it's calling you.        They have cradled you in custom, they have primed you with their            preaching,        They have soaked you in convention through and through;      They have put you in a showcase; you're a credit to their teaching--        But can't you hear the wild?--it's calling you.      Let us probe the silent places, let us seek what luck betide us;        Let us journey to a lonely land I know.      There's a whisper on the night-wind, there's a star agleam to guide us,        And the wild is calling, calling ... let us go.          THE LONE TRAIL          _Ye who know the Lone Trail fain would follow it,      Though it lead to glory or the darkness of the pit.      Ye who take the Lone Trail, bid your love good-bye;      The Lone Trail, the Lone Trail follow till you die._        The trails of the world be countless, and most of the trails be tried;      You tread on the heels of the many, till you come where the ways            divide;      And one lies safe in the sunlight, and the other is dreary and wan,      Yet you look aslant at the Lone Trail, and the Lone Trail lures you on.      And somehow you're sick of the highway, with its noise and its easy            needs,      And you seek the risk of the by-way, and you reck not where it leads.      And sometimes it leads to the desert, and the tongue swells out of            the mouth,      And you stagger blind to the mirage, to die in the mocking drouth.      And sometimes it leads to the mountain, to the light of the lone            camp-fire,      And you gnaw your belt in the anguish of hunger-goaded desire.      And sometimes it leads to the Southland, to the swamp where the            orchid glows,      And you rave to your grave with the fever, and they rob the"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/25550"],[0,"The Defiant Agents (#2)"],[1,"lgarries--\"that there  had never been any improvising in this project, that all had always been  done by the book. I say that this is the time we must take the big  gamble, or else we may find we have been outbid for space entirely. Let  those others discover even one alien installation they can master and--\"  his thumb shifted from his lip, grinding down on the desk top as if it  were crushing some venturesome but entirely unimportant insect--\"and we  are finished before we really begin.\"    There were a number of men in the project who would agree with that,  Ashe knew. And a greater number in the country and conference at large.  The public was used to reckless gambles which paid off, and there had  been enough of those in the past to give an impressive argument for  that point of view. But Ashe, himself, could not agree to a speed-up. He  had been out among the stars, shaved disaster too closely because the  proper training had not been given.    \"I shall report that I advise a take-off within a week,\" Ruthven was  continuing. \"To the council I shall say that--\"    \"And I do not agree!\" Ashe cut in. He glanced at Kelgarries for the  quick backing he expected, but instead there was a lengthening moment of  silence. Then the colonel spread out his hands and said sullenly:    \"I don't agree either, but I don't have the final say-so. Ashe, what  would be needed to speed up any take-off?\"    It was Ruthven who replied. \"We can use the Redax, as I have said from  the start.\"    Ashe straightened, his mouth tight, his eyes hard and angry.    \"And I'll protest that ... to the council! Man, we're dealing with human  beings--selected volunteers, men who trust us--not with laboratory  animals!\"    Ruthven's thick lips pouted into what was close to a smile of derision.  \"Always the sentimentalists, you experts in the past! Tell me, Dr. Ashe,  were you always so thoughtful of your men when you sent agents back into  time? And certainly a voyage into space is less a risk than time travel.  These volunteers know what they have signed for. They will be ready----\"    \"Then you propose telling them about the use of Redax--what it does to a  man's mind?\" countered Ashe.    \"Certainly. They will receive all necessary instructions.\"    Ashe was not satisfied and he would have spoken again, but Kelgarries  interrupted:    \"If it comes to that, none of us here has any right to make final  decisions. Waldour has already sent in his report about the snoop. We'll  have to await orders from the council.\"    Ruthven levered himself out of his chair, his solid bulk stretching his  uniform coveralls. \"That is correct, Colonel. In the meantime I would  suggest we all check to see what can be done to speed up each one's  portion of labor.\" Without another word, he tramped to the door.    Waldour eyed the other two with mounting impatience. It was plain he had  work to do and wanted them to leave. But Ashe was reluctant. He had a  feeling that matters were slipping out of his control, that he was about  to face a crisis which was somehow worse than just a major security  leak. Was the enemy always on the other side of the world? Or could he  wear the same uniform, even share the same goals?    In the outer corridor he still hesitated, and Kelgarries, a step or so  in advance, looked back over his shoulder impatiently.    \"There's no use fighting--our hands are tied.\" His words were slurred,  almost as if he wanted to disown them.    \"Then you'll agree to use the Redax?\" For the second time within the  hour Ashe felt as if he had taken a step only to have firm earth turn  into slippery, shifting sand underfoot.    \"It isn't a matter of my agreeing. It may be a matter of getting through  or not getting through--now. If they've had eighteen months, or even  twelve...!\" The colonel's fingers balled into a fist. \"And _they_ won't  be delayed by any humanitarian reasoning----\"    \"Then you believe Ruthven will win the council's approval?\"    \"When you are dealing with frightened men, you're talking to ears closed  to anything but what they want to hear. After all, we can't prove that  the Redax will be harmful.\"    \"But we've only used it under rigidly controlled conditions. To speed up  the process would mean a total disregard of those controls. Snapping a  party of men and women back into their racial past and holding them  there for too long a period....\" Ashe shook his head.    \"You have been in Operation Retrograde from the start, and we've been  remarkably successful----\"    \"Operating in a different way, educating picked men to return to certain  points in history where their particular temperaments and  characteristics fitted the roles they were selected to play, yes. And  even then we had our percentage of failures. But to try this--returning  people not physically into time, but _mentally and emotionally_ into  prototypes of their ancestors--that's something else again. The Apaches  have volunteered, and they've been passed by the psychologists and the  testers. But they're Americans of today, not tribal nomads of two or  three hundred years ago. If you break down some barriers, you might just  end up breaking them all.\"    Kelgarries was scowling. \"You mean--they might revert utterly, have no  contact with the present at all?\"    \"That's just what I do mean. Education and training, yes, but full  awakening of racial memories, no. The two branches of conditioning  should go slowly and hand in hand, otherwise--real trouble!\"    \"Only we no longer have the time to go slow. I'm certain Ruthven will be  able to push this through--with Waldour's report to back him.\"    \"Then we'll have to warn Fox and the rest. They must be given a choice  in the matter.\"    \"Ruthven said that would be done.\" The colonel did not sound convinced  of that.    Ashe snorted. \"If I hear him telling them, I'll believe it!\"    \"I wonder whether we can....\"    Ashe half turned and frowned at the colonel. \"What do you mean?\"    \"You said yourself that we had our failures in time travel. We expected  those, accepted them, even when they hurt. When we asked for volunteers  for this project we had to make them understand that there was a heavy  element of risk involved. Three teams of recruits--the Eskimos from  Point Barren, the Apaches, and the Islanders--all picked because their  people had a high survival rating in the past, to be colonists on widely  different types of planets. Well, the Eskimos and the Islanders aren't  matched to any of the worlds on those snooped tapes, but Topaz is  waiting for the Apaches. And we may have to move them in there in a  hurry. It's a rotten gamble any way you see it!\"    \"I'll appeal directly to the council.\"    Kelgarries shrugged. \"All right. You have my backing.\"    \"But you believe such an effort hopeless?\"    \"You know the red-tape merchants. You'll have to move fast if you want  to beat Ruthven. He's probably on a straight line now to Stanton,  Reese, and Margate. This is what he has been waiting for!\"    \"There are the news syndicates; public opinion would back us----\"    \"You don't mean that, of course.\" Kelgarries was suddenly coldly remote.    Ashe flushed under the heavy brown which overlay his regular features.  To threaten a silence break was near blasphemy here. He ran both hands  down the fabric covering his thighs as if to rub away some soil on his  palms.    \"No,\" he replied heavily, his voice dull. \"I guess I don't. I'll contact  Hough and hope for the best.\"    \"Meanwhile,\" Kelgarries spoke briskly, \"we'll do what we can to speed up  the program as it now stands. I suggest you take off for New York within  the hour----\"    \"Me? Why?\" Ashe asked with a trace of suspicion.    \"Because I can't leave without acting directly against orders, and that  would put us wrong immediately. You see Hough and talk to him  personally--put it to him straight. He'll have to have all the facts if  he's going to counter any move from Stanton before the council. You know  every argument we can use and all the proof on our side, and you're  authority enough to make it count.\"    \"If I can do all that, I will.\" Ashe was alert and eager. The colonel,  seeing his change of expression, felt easier.    But Kelgarries stood a moment watching Ashe as he hurried down a side  corridor, before he moved on slowly to his own box of office. Once  inside he sat for a long unhappy time staring at the wall and seeing  nothing but the pictures produced by his thoughts. Then he pressed a  button and read off the symbols which flashed on a small visa-screen  set in his desk. Another button pushed, and he picked up a hand mike to  relay an order which might postpone trouble for a while. Ashe was far  too valuable a man to lose, and his emotions could boil him straight  into disaster over this.    \"Bidwell--reschedule Team A. They are to go to the Hypno-Lab instead of  the reserve in ten minutes.\"    Releasing the mike, he again stared at the wall. No one dared interrupt  a hypno-training period, and this one would last three hours. Ashe could  not possibly see the trainees before he left for New York. And that  would remove one temptation from his path--he would not talk at the  wrong time.    Kelgarries' mouth twisted sourly. He had no pride in what he was doing.  And he was perfectly certain that Ruthven would win and that Ashe's  fears of Redax were well founded. It all came back to the old basic  tenet of the service: the end justified the means. They must use every  method and man under their control to make sure that Topaz would remain  a western possession, even though that strange planet now swung far  beyond the sky which covered both the western and eastern alliances on  Terra. Time had run out too fast; they were being forced to play what  cards they held, even though those might be very low ones. Ashe would be  back, but not, Kelgarries hoped, until this had been decided one way or  another. Not until this was finished.    Finished!"]]]
