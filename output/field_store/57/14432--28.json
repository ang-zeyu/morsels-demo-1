They go out, and in  a month or two they're back, with their hair still black and their eyes  still bright and their uniforms still fit. A month or two is all. Those  crowds that cheered us, they were proud of us and sorry for us, because  we'd been out thirty years and they never expected us back at all. But  it was inconvenient for Spaceport.\" Bitter sarcasm tinged his voice.  \"They actually had to postpone the regular monthly Trans-Galactic run  to let us in with this big, clumsy hulk.\"    \"Why didn't we ever see any of the new ships either going out or coming  back?\" asked Gregory.           *       *       *       *       *    Frankston shook his head. \"You don't see a ship when it's in spacedrive.  It's out of normal space-time dimensions. We had a smattering of the  theory at cadet school ... anyway, if one did flash into normal  space-time--say, for instance, coming in for a landing--the probability  of us being at the same place at the same time was almost nil. 'Two  ships passing in the night' as the old saying goes.\"    Gregory nodded, \"I guess Trippitt was the lucky one.\"    \"You didn't see Trippitt die,\" replied James.    \"What was it?\" asked Frankston. \"What killed Trippitt? So quickly, too.  He was only outside a few minutes like the rest of us, and eight hours  later he was dead.\"    \"We couldn't be sure,\" answered James. \"Some virus. There are countless  varieties. People live in a contaminated atmosphere all their lives,  build up a resistance to them. Sometimes a particularly virulent strain  will produce an epidemic, but most people, if they're affected, will  have a mild case of whatever it is and recover. But after thirty years  in space, thirty years of breathing perfectly pure, uncontaminated air,  Trippitt had no antibodies in his bloodstream. The virus hit and he  died.\"    \"But why didn't the rest of us get it?\" asked Gregory.    \"We were lucky. Viruses are like that.\"    \"Those people talked about building a home for us,\" muttered Frankston.  \"Why didn't they?\"    \"It wouldn't have been any different,\" answered James gently. \"It would  have been the same, almost an exact duplicate of the ship, everything  but the rockets. Same metal and plastic and filtered air and synthetic  food. It couldn't have had wool rugs or down pillows or smiling wives or  fresh air or eggs for breakfast. It would have been just like this. So,  since the ship was obsolete, they gave it to us, and a plot of ground to  anchor it to, and we're home. They did the best they could for us, the  very best they could.\"    \"But I feel stifled, shut in!\"    \"The ship is large, Frankston. We all crowd into this section because,  without each other, we'd go mad.\" James kicked the edge of the magazine  on the floor. \"Thank God we're not allergic to decontaminated paper.  There's still reading.\"    \"We're getting old,\" said Gregory. \"Some day one of us will be here  alone.\"    \"God help him then,\" answered James, with more emotion than was usual  for him.           *       *       *       *       *    During the latter part of the conversation, the little red signal had  been flashing persistently. Finally James saw it. Ross was in the outer  lock. James threw the decontaminator switch and the signal winked out.  Every trace of dust and pollen would have to be removed from Ross's suit  before he could come inside the ship.    \"Just like on an alien planet,\" commented Gregory.    \"Isn't that what this is to us--an alien planet?\" asked Frankston, and  neither of the other men dared answer his bitter question.    A few minutes later, Ross was back in the cabin, and James helped him  out of his spacesuit.    \"How are the geraniums, Ross?\" asked Gregory.    \"Fine,\" said Ross enthusiastically. \"They're doing just fine.\"    He walked over to his bunk and lay down on his side so he could see out  of the viewport. There would be an hour left before darkness fell, an  hour to watch the geraniums. They were tall and red, and swayed slightly  in the evening breeze.                                                             --LYN VENABLE          Transcriber's Note:        This etext was produced from _Galaxy Science Fiction_ December 1952.

Tom Pinkerton said  yesterday that you ought to resign, as you can't attend to your duties.  He wouldn't object to filling your place, I fancy.\"    \"He is welcome to the place as soon as the club feels like electing  him,\" said Frank. \"Tell the boys I am sorry I can't be on hand. They had  better get you to fill my place.\"    \"I'll mention it, but I don't think they'll see it in that light.  They're all jealous of my superior playing,\" said Sam, humorously.  \"Well, good-bye, Frank. I hope your mother'll be better soon.\"    \"Thank you, Sam,\" answered Frank, soberly. \"I hope so, too, but she is  very sick.\"    The next day Mrs. Fowler again called Frank to the bedside.    \"Grace is gone out on an errand,\" she said, \"and I can find no better  time for telling you what I know about you and the circumstances which  led to my assuming the charge of you.\"    \"Are you strong enough, mother?\"    \"Yes, Frank. Thirteen years ago my husband and myself occupied a  small tenement in that part of Brooklyn know as Gowanus, not far from  Greenwood Cemetery. My husband was a carpenter, and though his wages  were small he was generally employed. We had been married three years,  but had no children of our own. Our expenses were small, and we got on  comfortably, and should have continued to do so, but that Mr. Fowler  met with an accident which partially disabled him. He fell from a high  scaffold and broke his arm. This was set and he was soon able to work  again, but he must also have met with some internal injury, for his full  strength never returned. Half a day's work tired him more than a  whole day's work formerly had done. Of course our income was very much  diminished, and we were obliged to economize very closely. This preyed  upon my husband's mind and seeing his anxiety, I set about considering  how I could help him, and earn my share of the expenses.    \"One day in looking over the advertising columns of a New York paper I  saw the following advertisement:    \"'For adoption--A healthy male infant. The parents are able to pay  liberally for the child's maintenance, but circumstances compel them to  delegate the care to another. Address for interview A. M.'    \"I had no sooner read this advertisement than I felt that it was just  what I wanted. A liberal compensation was promised, and under our  present circumstances would be welcome, as it was urgently needed. I  mentioned the matter to my husband, and he was finally induced to give  his consent.    \"Accordingly, I replied to the advertisement.    \"Three days passed in which I heard nothing from it. But as we were  sitting at the supper table at six o'clock one afternoon, there came a  knock at our front door. I opened it, and saw before me a tall stranger,  a man of about thirty-five, of dark complexion, and dark whiskers. He  was well dressed, and evidently a gentleman in station.    \"'Is this Mrs. Fowler?' he asked.    \"'Yes, sir,' I answered, in some surprise    \"'Then may I beg permission to enter your house for a few minutes? I  have something to say to you.'    \"Still wondering, I led the way into the sitting-room, where your  father--where Mr. Fowler----\"    \"Call him my father--I know no other,\" said Frank.    \"Where your father was seated.    \"'You have answered an advertisement,' said the stranger.    \"'Yes, sir,' I replied.    \"'I am A. M.,' was his next announcement. 'Of course I have received  many letters, but on the whole I was led to consider yours most  favorably. I have made inquiries about you in the neighborhood, and the  answers have been satisfactory. You have no children of your own?'    \"'No, sir.'    \"'All the better. You would be able to give more attention to this  child.'    \"'Is it yours, sir?' I asked    \"'Ye-es,' he answered, with hesitation. 'Circumstances,' he continued,  'circumstances which I need not state, compel me to separate from it.  Five hundred dollars a year will be paid for its maintenance.'    \"Five hundred dollars! I heard this with joy, for it was considerably  more than my husband was able to earn since his accident. It would make  us comfortable at once, and your father might work when he pleased,  without feeling any anxiety about our coming to want.    \"'Will that sum be satisfactory?' asked the stranger.    \"'It is very liberal,' I answered.    \"'I intended it to be so,' he said. 'Since there is no difficulty on  this score, I am inclined to trust you with the care of the child. But I  must make two conditions.'    \"'What are they, sir?'    \"'In the first place, you must not try to find out the friends of the  child. They do not desire to be known. Another thing, you must move from  Brooklyn.'    \"'Move from Brooklyn?' I repeated.    \"'Yes,' he answered, firmly. 'I do not think it necessary to give you a  reason for this condition. Enough that it is imperative. If you decline,  our negotiations are at an end.'    \"I looked at my husband. He seemed as much surprised as I was.    \"'Perhaps you will wish to consult together,' suggested our visitor.  'If so, I can give you twenty minutes. I will remain in this room while  you go out and talk it over.'    \"We acted on this hint, and went into the kitchen. We decided that  though we should prefer to live in Brooklyn, it would be worth our while  to make the sacrifice for the sake of the addition to our income. We  came in at the end of ten minutes, and announced our decision. Our  visitor seemed to be very much pleased.    \"'Where would you wish us to move?' asked your father.    \"'I do not care to designate any particular place. I should prefer some  small country town, from fifty to a hundred miles distant. I suppose you  will be able to move soon?'    \"'Yes, sir; we will make it a point to do so. How soon will the child  be placed in our hands? Shall we send for it?'    \"'No, no,' he said, hastily. 'I cannot tell you exactly when, but it  will be brought here probably in the course of a day or two. I myself  shall bring it, and if at that time you wish to say anything additional  you can do so.'    \"He went away, leaving us surprised and somewhat excited at the change  that was to take place in our lives. The next evening the sound of  wheels was heard, and a hack stopped at our gate. The same gentleman  descended hurriedly with a child in his arms--you were the child,  Frank--and entered the house.    \"'This is the child,' he said, placing it in my arms, 'and here is the  first quarterly installment of your pay. Three months hence you will  receive the same sum from my agent in New York. Here is his address,'  and he placed a card in my hands. 'Have you anything to ask?'    \"'Suppose I wish to communicate with you respecting the child? Suppose  he is sick?'    \"'Then write to A. M., care of Giles Warner, No. ---- Nassau Street.  By the way, it will be necessary for you to send him your postoffice  address after your removal in order that he may send you your quarterly  dues.'    \"With this he left us, entered the hack, and drove off. I have never  seen him since.\"        CHAPTER III    LEFT ALONE    Frank listened to this revelation with wonder. For the first time in his  life he asked himself, \"Who am I?\"    \"How came I by my name, mother?\" he asked.    \"I must tell you. After the sudden departure of the gentleman who  brought you, we happened to think that we had not asked your name. We  accordingly wrote to the address which had been given us, making the  inquiry. In return we received a slip of paper containing these words:  'The name is immaterial; give him any name you please. A. M.'\"    \"You gave me the name of Frank.\"    \"It was Mr. Fowler's name. We should have given it to you had you been  our own boy; as the choice was left to us, we selected that.\"    \"It suits me as well as any other. How soon did you leave Brooklyn,  mother?\"    \"In a week we had made all arrangements, and removed to this place. It  is a small place, but it furnished as much work as my husband felt able  to do. With the help of the allowance for your support, we not only got  on comfortably, but saved up a hundred and fifty dollars annually, which  we deposited in a savings bank. But after five years the money stopped  coming. It was the year 1857, the year of the great panic, and among  others who failed was Giles Warner's agent, from whom we received our  payments. Mr. Fowler went to New York to inquire about it, but only  learned that Mr. Warner, weighed down by his troubles, had committed  suicide, leaving no clew to the name of the man who left you with us.\"    \"How long ago was that, mother?\"    \"Seven years ago nearly eight.\"    \"And you continued to keep me, though the payments stopped.\"    \"Certainly; you were as dear to us as our own child--for we now had a  child of our own--Grace. We should as soon have thought of casting off  her as you.\"    \"But you must have been poor, mother.\"    \"We were economical, and we got along till your father died three years  ago. Since then it has been hard work.\"    \"You have had a hard time, mother.\"    \"No harder on your account. You have been a great comfort to me, Frank.  I am only anxious for the future. I fear you and Grace will suffer after  I am gone.\"    \"Don't fear, mother, I am young and strong; I am not afraid to face the  world with God's help.\"    \"What are you thinking of, Frank?\" asked Mrs. Fowler, noticing the boy's  fixed look.    \"Mother,\" he said, earnestly, \"I mean to seek for that man you have told  me of. I want to find out who I am. Do you think he was my father?\"    \"He said he was, but I do not believe it. He spoke with hesitation, and  said this to deceive us, probably.\"    \"I am glad you think so, I would not like to think him my father. From  what you have told me of him I am sure I would not like him.\"    \"He must be nearly fifty "]]]
