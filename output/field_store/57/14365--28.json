[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/2750"],[0,"Joan of Naples (#2)"],[1,"hour for me has come,  and now I must appear before God, the one unfailing judge.\"    \"If His justice cannot fail, is not His mercy infinite?\" pursued the  queen, with the glow of sacred inspiration. \"Even if there were good  reason for the fear that has shaken your soul, what fault could not be  effaced by a repentance so noble? Have you not repaired the wrong you  may have done your nephew Carobert, by bringing his younger son Andre to  your kingdom and marrying him to Joan, your poor Charles's elder  daughter? Will not they inherit your crown?\"    \"Alas!\" cried Robert, with a deep sigh, \"God is punishing me perhaps for  thinking too late of this just reparation. O my good and noble Sandra,  you touch a chord which vibrates sadly in my heart, and you anticipate  the unhappy confidence I was about to make. I feel a gloomy  presentiment--and in the hour of death presentiment is prophecy--that  the two sons of my nephew, Louis, who has been King of Hungary since his  father died, and Andre, whom I desired to make King of Naples, will  prove the scourge of my family. Ever since Andre set foot in our castle,  a strange fatality has pursued and overturned my projects. I had hoped  that if Andre and Joan were brought up together a tender intimacy would  arise between the two children; and that the beauty of our skies, our  civilisation, and the attractions of our court would end by softening  whatever rudeness there might be in the young Hungarian's character; but  in spite of my efforts all has tended to cause coldness, and even  aversion, between the bridal pair. Joan, scarcely fifteen, is far ahead  of her age. Gifted with a brilliant and mobile mind, a noble and lofty  character, a lively and glowing fancy, now free and frolicsome as a  child, now grave and proud as a queen, trustful and simple as a young  girl, passionate and sensitive as a woman, she presents the most  striking contrast to Andre, who, after a stay of ten years at our court,  is wilder, more gloomy, more intractable than ever. His cold, regular  features, impassive countenance, and indifference to every pleasure that  his wife appears to love, all this has raised between him and Joan a  barrier of indifference, even of antipathy. To the tenderest effusion  his reply is no more than a scornful smile or a frown, and he never  seems happier than when on a pretext of the chase he can escape from the  court. These, then, are the two, man and wife, on whose heads my crown  shall rest, who in a short space will find themselves exposed to every  passion whose dull growl is now heard below a deceptive calm, but which  only awaits the moment when I breathe my last, to burst forth upon  them.\"    \"O my God, my God!\" the queen kept repeating in her grief: her arms fell  by her side, like the arms of a statue weeping by a tomb.    \"Listen, Dona Sandra. I know that your heart has never clung to earthly  vanities, and that you only wait till God has called me to Himself to  withdraw to the convent of Santa Maria delta Croce, founded by yourself  in the hope that you might there end your days. Far be it from me to  dissuade you from your sacred vocation, when I am myself descending into  the tomb and am conscious of the nothingness of all human greatness.  Only grant me one year of widowhood before you pass on to your bridal  with the Lord, one year in which you will watch over Joan and her  husband, to keep from them all the dangers that threaten. Already the  woman who was the seneschal's wife and her son have too much influence  over our grand-daughter; be specially careful, and amid the many  interests, intrigues, and temptations that will surround the young  queen, distrust particularly the affection of Bertrand d'Artois, the  beauty of Louis of Tarentum; and the ambition of Charles of Durazzo.\"    The king paused, exhausted by the effort of speaking; then turning on  his wife a supplicating glance and extending his thin wasted hand, he  added in a scarcely audible voice:    \"Once again I entreat you, leave not the court before a year has passed.  Do you promise me?\"    \"I promise, my lord.\"    \"And now,\" said Robert, whose face at these words took on a new  animation, \"call my confessor and the physician and summon the family,  for the hour is at hand, and soon I shall not have the strength to speak  my last words.\"    A few moments later the priest and the doctor re-entered the room, their  faces bathed, in tears. The king thanked them warmly for their care of  him in his last illness, and begged them help to dress him in the coarse  garb of a Franciscan monk, that God, as he said, seeing him die in  poverty, humility, and penitence, might the more easily grant him  pardon. The confessor and doctor placed upon his naked feet the sandals  worn by mendicant friars, robed him in a Franciscan frock, and tied the  rope about his waist. Stretched thus upon his bed, his brow surmounted  by his scanty locks, with his long white beard, and his hands crossed  upon his breast, the King of Naples looked like one of those aged  anchorites who spend their lives in mortifying the flesh, and whose  souls, absorbed in heavenly contemplation, glide insensibly from out  their last ecstasy into eternal bliss. Some time he lay thus with closed  eyes, putting up a silent prayer to God; then he bade them light the  spacious room as for a great solemnity, and gave a sign to the two  persons who stood, one at the head, the other at the foot of the bed.  The two folding doors opened, and the whole of the royal family, with  the queen at their head and the chief barons following, took their  places in silence around the dying king to hear his last wishes.    His eyes turned toward Joan, who stood next him on his right hand, with  an indescribable look of tenderness and grief. She was of a beauty so  unusual and so marvellous, that her grandfather was fascinated by the  dazzling sight, and mistook her for an angel that God had sent to  console him on his deathbed. The pure lines of her fine profile, her  great black liquid eyes, her noble brow uncovered, her hair shining like  the raven's wing, her delicate mouth, the whole effect of this beautiful  face on the mind of those who beheld her was that of a deep melancholy  and sweetness, impressing itself once and for ever. Tall and slender,  but without the excessive thinness of some young girls, her movements  had that careless supple grace that recall the waving of a flower stalk  in the breeze. But in spite of all these smiling and innocent graces one  could yet discern in Robert's heiress a will firm and resolute to brave  every obstacle, and the dark rings that circled her fine eyes plainly  showed that her heart was already agitated by passions beyond her years.    Beside Joan stood her younger sister, Marie, who was twelve or thirteen  years of age, the second daughter of Charles, Duke of Calabria, who had  died before her birth, and whose mother, Marie of Valois, had unhappily  been lost to her from her cradle. Exceedingly pretty and shy, she seemed  distressed by such an assembly of great personages, and quietly drew  near to the widow of the grand seneschal, Philippa, surnamed the  Catanese, the princesses' governess, whom they honoured as a mother.  Behind the princesses and beside this lady stood her son, Robert of  Cabane, a handsome young man, proud and upright, who with his left hand  played with his slight moustache while he secretly cast on Joan a glance  of audacious boldness. The group was completed by Dona Cancha, the young  chamberwoman to the princesses, and by the Count of Terlizzi, who  exchanged with her many a furtive look and many an open smile. The  second group was composed of Andre, Joan's husband, and Friar Robert,  tutor to the young prince, who had come with him from Budapesth, and  never left him for a minute. Andre was at this time perhaps eighteen  years old: at first sight one was struck by the extreme regularity of  his features, his handsome, noble face, and abundant fair hair; but  among all these Italian faces, with their vivid animation, his  countenance lacked expression, his eyes seemed dull, and something hard  and icy in his looks revealed his wild character and foreign extraction.  His tutor's portrait Petrarch has drawn for us: crimson face, hair and  beard red, figure short and crooked; proud in poverty, rich and miserly;  like a second Diogenes, with hideous and deformed limbs barely concealed  beneath his friar's frock.    In the third group stood the widow of Philip, Prince of Tarentum, the  king's brother, honoured at the court of Naples with the title of  Empress of Constantinople, a style inherited by her as the granddaughter  of Baldwin II. Anyone accustomed to sound the depths of the human heart  would at one glance have perceived that this woman under her ghastly  pallor concealed an implacable hatred, a venomous jealousy, and an  all-devouring ambition. She had her three sons about her--Robert,  Philip, and Louis, the youngest. Had the king chosen out from among his  nephews the handsomest, bravest, and most generous, there can be no  doubt that Louis of Tarentum would have obtained the crown. At the age  of twenty-three he had already excelled the cavaliers of most renown in  feats of arms; honest, loyal, and brave, he no sooner conceived a  project than he promptly carried it out. His brow shone in that clear  light which seems to serve as a halo of success to natures so privileged  as his; his fine eyes, of a soft and velvety black, subdued the hearts  of men who could not resist their charm, and his caressing smile made  conquest sweet. A child of destiny, he had but to use his will; some  power unknown, some beneficent fairy had watched over his birth, and  undertaken to smooth away all obstacles, gratify all desires.    Near to him, but in the fourth group, his cousin Charles of Duras stood  and scowled. His mother, Agnes, the widow of the Duke of Durazzo and"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/27509"],[0,"The 2006 CIA World Factbook (#2)"],[1,"of family income - Gini index  2173  Oil - production (bbl/day)  2174  Oil - consumption (bbl/day)  2175  Oil - imports (bbl/day)  2176  Oil - exports (bbl/day)  2177  Median age (years)  2178  Oil - proved reserves (bbl)  2179  Natural gas - proved reserves (cu m)  2180  Natural gas - production (cu m)  2181  Natural gas - consumption (cu m)  2182  Natural gas - imports (cu m)  2183  Natural gas - exports (cu m)  2184  Internet hosts  2185  Investment (gross fixed) (% of GDP)  2186  Public debt (% of GDP)  2187  Current account balance  2188  Reserves of foreign exchange and gold  2193  Major infectious diseases  2194  Refugees and internally displaced persons  2195  GDP (official exchange rate)  2196  Trafficking in persons        ======================================================================        Rank Orders      [Transcriber's note: To search on a rank order in this file, prefix  the rank's name with \"@\", e.g. \"@Population\".  \"Population\" will find  all occurrences; prefixing it with \"@\" will find the correct location.]        Guide to Rank Order Pages      Rank Order pages are presorted lists of data from selected Factbook  data fields. Rank Order pages are generally given in descending  order -highest to lowest - such as Population and Area. The two  exceptions are Unemployment Rate and Inflation Rate, which are in  ascending - lowest to highest - order. Rank Order pages are  available for the following 47 fields in six of the nine Factbook  categories.      Geography    Area - total    People    Population  Birth rate  Death rate  Infant mortality rate  Life expectancy at birth - total  Total fertility rate  HIV/AIDS - adult prevalence rate  HIV/AIDS - people living with HIV/AIDS  HIV/AIDS - deaths    Economy    GDP (purchasing power parity)  GDP - real growth rate  GDP - per capita  Labor force  Unemployment rate  Inflation rate (consumer prices)  Investment (gross fixed)  Public debt  Industrial production growth rate  Electricity - production  Electricity - consumption  Oil - production  Oil - consumption  Oil - exports  Oil - imports  Oil - proved reserves  Natural Gas - production  Natural Gas - consumption  Natural Gas - exports  Natural Gas - imports  Natural Gas - proved reserves  Current account balance  Exports  Imports  Reserves of foreign exchange and gold  Debt - external    Communications    Telephones - main lines in use  Telephones - mobile cellular  Internet hosts  Internet users    Transportation    Airports  Railways - total  Roadways - total  Waterways  Merchant marine - total      Military    Military expenditures - dollar figure  Military expenditures - percent of GDP    Factbook fields with Rank Order pages are easily identified with a  small bar chart icon to the right of the data field title.    Not all Rank Order pages include the same number of entries because  information for a particular field is not available for all  countries. In addition, not all data fields are suitable for  displaying as Rank Order pages, such as those containing textual  information. Textual information is more readily viewed by clicking  on the Field Listing icon next to the Data field title. The other  icon next to the data field title provides the definition of the  field.    All of the 'Rank Order' pages can be downloaded as tab-delimited  data files and can be opened in other applications such as  spreadsheets and databases.

In the Economy category, the Factbook is  now reporting national GDP figures in US dollars converted at Official  Exchange Rates (OER) in addition to GDP at Purchasing Power Parity  (PPP) rates, since both measures contain information useful to our  readers. Traditionally, only PPP-converted GDP values had been  reported. In the Transportation category, the former Highways entry is  now Roadways, while Ports and harbors has been retitled Ports and  terminals.        Abbreviations    This information is included in Appendix A: Abbreviations, which  includes all abbreviations and acronyms used in the Factbook, with  their expansions.    Acronyms    An acronym is an abbreviation coined from the initial letter of each  successive word in a term or phrase. In general, an acronym made up  solely from the first letter of the major words in the expanded form is  rendered in all capital letters (NATO from North Atlantic Treaty  Organization; an exception would be ASEAN for Association of Southeast  Asian Nations). In general, an acronym made up of more than the first  letter of the major words in the expanded form is rendered with only an  initial capital letter (Comsat from Communications Satellite  Corporation; an exception would be NAM from Nonaligned Movement).  Hybrid forms are sometimes used to distinguish between initially  identical terms (WTO: for World Trade Organization and WToO for World  Tourism Organization.)    Administrative divisions    This entry generally gives the numbers, designatory terms, and first-  order administrative divisions as approved by the US Board on  Geographic Names (BGN). Changes that have been reported but not yet  acted on by BGN are noted.    Age structure    This entry provides the distribution of the population according to  age. Information is included by sex and age group (0-14 years, 15-64  years, 65 years and over). The age structure of a population affects a  nation's key socioeconomic issues. Countries with young populations  (high percentage under age 15) need to invest more in schools, while  countries with older populations (high percentage ages 65 and over)  need to invest more in the health sector. The age structure can also be  used to help predict potential political issues. For example, the rapid  growth of a young adult population unable to find employment can lead  to unrest.    Agriculture - products    This entry is an ordered listing of major crops and products starting  with the most important.    Airports    This entry gives the total number of airports or airfields recognizable  from the air. The runway(s) may be paved (concrete or asphalt surfaces)  or unpaved (grass, earth, sand, or gravel surfaces) but may include  closed or abandoned installations. Airports or airfields that are no  longer recognizable (overgrown, no facilities, etc.) are not included.  Note that not all airports have accomodations for refueling,  maintenance, or air traffic control.    Airports - with paved runways    This entry gives the total number of airports with paved runways  (concrete or asphalt surfaces) by length. For airports with more than  one runway, only the longest runway is included according to the  following five groups - (1) over 3,047 m, (2) 2,438 to 3,047 m, (3)  1,524 to 2,437 m, (4) 914 to 1,523 m, and (5) under 914 m. Only  airports with usable runways are included in this listing. Not all  airports have facilities for refueling, maintenance, or air traffic  control.    Airports - with unpaved runways    This entry gives the total number of airports with unpaved runways  (grass, dirt, sand, or gravel surfaces) by length. For airports with  more than one runway, only the longest runway is included according to  the following five groups - (1) over 3,047 m, (2) 2,438 to 3,047 m, (3)  1,524 to 2,437 m, (4) 914 to 1,523 m, and (5) under 914 m. Only  airports with usable runways are included in this listing. Not all  airports have facilities for refueling, maintenance, or air traffic  control.    Appendixes    This section includes Factbook-related material by topic.    Area    This entry includes three subfields. Total area is the sum of all land  and water areas delimited by international boundaries and/or  coastlines. Land area is the aggregate of all surfaces delimited by  international boundaries and/or coastlines, excluding inland water  bodies (lakes, reservoirs, rivers). Water area is the sum of the  surfaces of all inland water bodies, such as lakes, reservoirs, or  rivers, as delimited by international boundaries and/or coastlines.    Area - comparative    This entry provides an area comparison based on total area equivalents.  Most entities are compared with the entire US or one of the 50 states  based on area measurements (1990 revised) provided by the US Bureau of  the Census. The smaller entities are compared with Washington, DC (178  sq km, 69 sq mi) or The Mall in Washington, DC (0.59 sq km, 0.23 sq mi,  146 acres).    Background    This entry usually highlights major historic events and current issues  and may include a statement about one or two key future trends.    Birth rate    This entry gives the average annual number of births during a year per  1,000 persons in the population at midyear; also known as crude birth  rate. The birth rate is usually the dominant factor in determining the  rate of population growth. It depends on both the level"]]]
