A salamander would pursue a  fly until it was caught, or until it moved out of the field of action.  The salamanders were attracted by movements of flies, and ignored those  that were completely quiet; predation was oriented almost wholly on a  visual basis. Once they were within 2 to 4 mm. of a fly they would snap  out the tongue to secure the fly; they were successful in capturing  vestigial-winged flies in about 75 per cent of all tries. The relative  success of capture was greater when the animals were fresh from the  field and less after they had become fattened. The vigor of their  pursuit also decreased noticeably once they became fat. About two days  after any new fly colony was placed in the terrarium, a salamander would  take up a position just inside the lip of the milk bottle, which was  placed on its side. From this vantage point the salamanders took heavy  toll of the fly populations, eating both adults and larvae.    Initially the salamanders foraged indiscriminately in daylight or in  darkness. Later, as they became fat, they avoided high light intensity  and were active only at night or under artificial light of low  intensity. The latter pattern of activity is probably typical of the  pattern they maintain under natural conditions. Certainly we never saw  individuals abroad in daylight at Cloudcroft, yet under favorable  environmental conditions they were to be found in sites that required  considerable movement over open areas of the ground surface.    For several months two individuals of _Eurycea longicauda_ were kept in  with _A. hardii_. Foraging of these two plethodontids is nearly  identical, but the tongue of an adult _Eurycea_ can be extended somewhat  more than one-half inch in capturing flies; for _A. hardii_ this  distance is usually less than one-quarter inch. The relatively short  tongue of _A. hardii_ can be correlated with its life in restricted,  subsurface chambers, where prey most frequently is close to salamanders;  _E. longicauda_ inhabits significantly more open sites.      Parasites    Thirty of the adult _Aneides_ collected were examined for parasites;  most were parasitized by two species of nematodes, _Oswaldocruzia_ sp.  and _Thelandros_ sp. The former is found in the anterior part of the  small intestine and occasionally in the stomach, and the latter occurs  in the rectum. There were no gross intestinal pathological changes in  the salamanders resulting from parasitism. In fact, no pathological or  structural abnormalities were noted in any of the salamanders examined.  We believe the two nematodes are well-tolerated by the salamander.

It should be noted that of the 17 worms constituting the  maximum infection by _Thelandros_, only one was an adult worm; the  maximum number of adult _Thelandros_ in any one host was five.  Similarly, the heaviest _Oswaldocruzia_ infection, 15 worms, consisted  of immature individuals; the maximum number of adult worms in any one  host was ten.    The monthly variation in the relative occurrence of young stages  _versus_ adult in both nematodes (Table 2) suggests that the parasites  are eliminated from hosts sometime in the long period, late September  to early June, when _A. hardii_ exists subterraneously; the worms thus  would be reacquired annually when the salamanders resumed living on the  \"surface\" or near the surface. Table 2 shows that the majority of the  worms are immature (100 per cent, in _Oswaldocruzia_) in samples taken  in July. Additionally, all but one individual of those constituting the  20 per cent occurring as immature _Oswaldocruzia_ in the period August  to September were actually collected in early August. These were found  in one salamander, and this constituted the heaviest infection for the  period; crowding effects may have led to retardation of development of  the worms.    If it is true that parasites are reacquired each spring--we assume that  no temperature factors or immune reactions are delaying development of  the worms, and no unusually long external ovic or free-living phase is a  necessary part of their life-history--then the host-parasite data can  be used as a basis for hypothesizing about the winter life of the  salamander. During \"surface\" life the incidence of parasitism is high  (90 per cent and 83 per cent: see Table 2), indicating that salamanders  are readily invaded in times of activity. Salamanders examined in  September were all parasitized and probably carried nematodes with  them into their winter retreats. This part of their habitat should thus  be contaminated with infective stages of both parasites. Yet the  salamanders seem to become re-infected when the period of summer  activity starts (note the high incidence of immature parasites in  salamanders taken in July); therefore, the salamanders lose their worms  in winter. This suggests that during their subterranean life salamanders  are inactive, and avoid ingestion of infective stages of the parasites.  A fairly complete hibernation such as we suppose they undergo has been  reported by Szymanski (1914) for _Salamandra_ on the basis of  kymographic records of movement.      Characteristics of Breeding      _Sex-ratio_    Tables 3 and 4 show the distribution of sexes for two subsections of  our sample. The ratio of males to females in the total sample was  nearly 1:1. There were differences in ratios between the three general  localities: the two northerly sites had fewer females than males, when  compared with the Cloudcroft samples. This is true for the samples of  adults, but not for the juveniles, where in each instance the females  predominated. We cannot absolutely explain these differences in ratios.  Possibly the data on adults reflect different patterns of activity among  the sexes so that adult females are simply not present in numbers where  we looked for them. They could be located underground, in connection  with \"incubating\" duties; if this is true it would account for the fact  that so few egg-clusters have been found in logs.

This is probably not an accurate reflection of  actual age composition in this species. Yet, we obtained the same  general result in all three years of the study. We assume, therefore,  that young were located where we could not catch many of them; probably  they were underground. Sites of hatching and of the activities of early  life would thus occur where we think the bulk of eggs are laid.

The criterion for adult status was breeding  capability. A five-millimeter testis was the smallest size found in  individuals that probably bred, and all of these were 40 mm. or more in  snout-vent"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/31293"],[0,"Systematic Status of a South American Frog, Allophryne ruthveni Gaige (#2)"],[1,"----------+----------+-----------------    [Footnote A: Holotype is reported to be 31 mm. snout-vent length  (Gaige, 1926). The largest measured by us was 26.2 mm. snout-vent.]         The dorsal spinules are most pronounced and extensive on the       male (Fig. 1) and less so in all other specimens examined.       The illustration of the holotype suggests that it has       equally prominent, but fewer, spinules (Gaige, 1926).         The holotype, a gravid female, is the largest known specimen       (31 mm., snout-vent length). Another gravid female (AMNH       70108) has a snout-vent length of 26.2 mm.         _Distribution._--All known specimens have been found in the       foothills of the northeastern face of the Guiana Massif in       British Guiana.      FAMILY POSITION         The following characters of _Allophryne_ are those generally       held to be useful in determining family relationships:         1. Presacral vertebrae procoelus, eight in number.         2. Parahyoid absent.         3. Free ribs lacking.         4. Bidder's organ absent.         5. Intercalary cartilages present in digits; phalangeal          formulae 3-3-4-4 and 3-3-4-5-4.         6. Coccyx articulating with sacrum by two condyles.         7. Tarsal bones not fused.         8. Pectoral girdle arciferal.         9. Epicoracoidal horns present, free.         10. Terminal phalanges T-shaped.         11. Sacrum procoelus and diapophyses expanded.         12. Maxillae, premaxillae, and prevomers edentate.         13. Cranial roofing bones well ossified.    Griffiths (1959) accorded considerable taxonomic weight to the presence  or absence of epicoracoidal horns in showing relationships among the  genera placed in the Brachycephalidae [= Atelopodidae; Dendrobatidae;  and Leptodactylidae (in part)] by Noble (1931). _Allophryne_ possesses  well-developed, free epicoracoidal horns, such as those found in the  Hylidae, Centrolenidae, Leptodactylidae and Bufonidae.    The presence of intercalary elements in the digits is characteristic of  the Centrolenidae, Hylidae, Phrynomeridae, Pseudidae, and the  rhacophorine ranids (including the Hyperoliidae). This element is bony  in the pseudids and cartilaginous in the other families. Phrynomerids  and rhacophorine ranids lack epicoracoidal horns and have firmisternal  pectoral girdles. Centrolenids are small, delicate, arboreal frogs  having poorly ossified skulls and fused tarsal bones, but agree with  _Allophryne_ in having T-shaped terminal phalanges.    [Illustration: FIG. 2. Dorsal (_a_) and lateral (_b_) views of  distal phalanges of third finger of _Allophryne_. x 40.]    Only the presence of intercalary cartilages (Fig. 2) suggests  relationship of _Allophryne_ to the Hylidae. The T-shaped terminal  phalanges suggest affinities with centrolenids, elutherodactyline  leptodactylids, or certain \"brachycephalid\" frogs. Griffiths (1959)  clearly showed that Noble's Brachycephalidae was a polyphyletic  assemblage. No hylid genus is edentate, and none has either T-shaped  terminal phalanges or the unusual dorsal spinules. Perhaps the presence  of intercalary cartilages is not indicative of relationship but instead  is a parallelism (or convergence) in _Allophryne_ and genera of the  Centrolenidae.      CRANIAL OSTEOLOGY         The skull of _Allophryne_ (Fig. 3) is distinctive among       anurans; it does not closely resemble the skulls of either       hylids or centrolenids, both of which have generally more       delicate (except for casque-headed hylids, such as       _Corythomantis_, _Diaglena_, _Osteocephalus_, _Triprion_)       and generalized skulls. _Allophryne_ on the other hand has a       strongly ossified central region (cranial roofing bones and       sphenethmoid complex) and a weak peripheral zone. The       peripheral elements are reduced (maxilla, pterygoid, and       squamosal) or absent (quadratojugal), whereas the       frontoparietals, nasals, sphenethmoid, prooetics, and       exoccipitals form a compact central zone. An elongate       frontoparietal fontanelle is present.    [Illustration: FIG. 3. Dorsal view of skull of _Allophryne_  (AMNH 70110). x 12.]         Dorsally (Fig. 3), the premaxillae are not visible. The       proportionally gigantic septomaxillae are visible anterior       to the nasals. The moderate-sized nasals are separated       medially and in broad contact with the ethmoid posteriorly.       The palatine process of the nasal does not meet the frontal       process of the maxilla. A large frontoparietal fontanelle is       evident between the frontoparietals. The tegmen tympani are       much reduced and maintain only cartilaginous contact with       the posterior arms of the squamosals. The foramen magnum,       occipital condyles, and exoccipitals show no unusual       features. The _pars facialis_ and frontal process of the       maxilla are greatly reduced. The maxilla and premaxilla are       articulated. The high, narrow alary processes of the       premaxillae extend dorsally about two-thirds of the height       of the snout. A cartilaginous internasal septum is       illustrated (Fig. 3), but sectioning is necessary to       determine the true nature and extent of this element.         Ventrally, the skull lacks palatines. The maxillae,       premaxillae, and prevomers are edentate. The parasphenoid is       large with relatively short, stout alary (lateral)       processes. The sphenethmoid is extensive in ventral aspect       and forms the major supporting structure in the anterior       part of the skull. The pterygoid has a broad articulation       with the maxilla, a tenuous contact with the squamosal, but       is not attached to the prooetic. The anterior (zygomatic)       process of the squamosal is greatly reduced (only about       one-third the length of the posterior process).      DISCUSSION    The skull of _Allophryne_ is definitely non-hylid. Most of the  post-cranial features do not help to clarify relationships.  _Allophryne_ shares several osteological features with the  Dendrobatidae: T-shaped terminal phalanges, general cranial morphology  and procoelus vertebrae. But, the dendrobatids possess firmisternal  pectoral girdles and lack epicoracoidal horns. Also, no dendrobatid has  intercalary elements in the digits. We are, therefore, left with a  taxonomic enigma. In one or more characters generally regarded as  important, _Allophryne_ differs from all presently defined families of  frogs. The Hylidae and Dendrobatidae are the only currently recognized  families in which the genus might be placed.    The function and taxonomic importance of the large septomaxillae are  unknown and are probably associated with the modification of the  sphenethmoid-prevomer area. A more detailed study of the cranial  osteology of _Allophryne_, especially the structural relationships of  the sphenethmoid-prevomer area may elucidate the relationships of  _Allophryne_.    The relationships of _Allophryne_ cannot be understood without a  re-analysis of some of the features used as major criteria in frog  classification (the nature of an intercalated cartilage; the nature of  the sternal complex; the relative value of cranial osteology; the  vertebral structure; and the thigh musculature). Some of these features  have been investigated by other workers, most notably Griffiths, but  others have not and need re-examination. A re-analysis of some of the  major criteria used in frog classification is in progress (Callison,  Lynch, and Trueb) and upon completion of that study we think the  relationships of _Allophryne_ will become apparent.    A more comprehensive study of the cranial anatomy of certain hylids,  leptodactylids, dendrobatids, and atelopodids along with that of  _Allophryne_ is needed to clarify the relationships of _Allophryne_,  and might indicate that the recognition of a fifth family is necessary.      CONCLUSION    Among currently recognized families of frogs, _Allophryne_ is least  different from the Hylidae although it is our opinion that inclusion of  this genus in the Hylidae probably represents an unnatural  classification. However, the present evidence suggesting that  _Allophryne_ should be in another family is less convincing than  evidence suggesting it should be in the Hylidae. We tentatively place  _Allophryne_ in the Hylidae.      LITERATURE CITED    DAVIS, D. D. and GORE, U. R.         1936. Clearing and staining skeletons of small vertebrates.
