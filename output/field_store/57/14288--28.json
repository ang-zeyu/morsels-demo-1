In  Ireland, soon after the collapse of the Clontarf meeting, O'Connell  and some of his associates were indicted for seditious conspiracy,  and convicted. The conviction was subsequently quashed on technical  grounds, but O'Connell's political influence was at an end. In  Parliament, owing chiefly to the exertions of Lord Ashley (afterwards  Earl of Shaftesbury), an important Bill was passed restricting factory  labour, and limiting its hours. The Bank Charter Act, separating the  issue and banking departments, as well as regulating the note issue  of the Bank of England in proportion to its stock of gold, also  became law. Meanwhile the dissensions in the Conservative party were  increasing, and the Ministry were defeated on a motion made by their  own supporters to extend the preferential treatment of colonial  produce. With great difficulty the vote was rescinded and a crisis  averted; but the Young England section of the Tory party were becoming  more and more an embarrassment to the Premier. Towards the end of  the year the new Royal Exchange was opened amid much ceremony by the  Queen.    The services rendered by Sir Charles Napier in India were the subject  of votes of thanks in both Houses, but shortly afterwards Lord  Ellenborough, the Governor-General, was recalled by the Directors  of the East India Company: their action was no doubt due to his  overbearing methods and love of display, but it was disapproved by the  Ministry, and Lord Ellenborough was accorded an Earldom.    During the year there was a recrudescence of the friction between this  country and France, due partly to questions as to the right of search  of foreign ships, partly to a _brochure_ issued by the Prince de  Joinville, a son of Louis Philippe, partly to the assumption of French  sovereignty over Tahiti and the seizure of the English consul there  by the French authorities. Reparation however was made, and the  ill-feeling subsided sufficiently to enable the King of the French to  visit Queen Victoria,--the first friendly visit ever paid by a  French king to the Sovereign of England. Louis Philippe was cordially  received in this country.    Another historic royal visit also took place in 1844, that of the  Emperor Nicholas, who no doubt was so much impressed with his friendly  reception, both by the Court and by Aberdeen, the Foreign Secretary,  that nine years later he thought he could calculate on the support of  England under Aberdeen (then Premier) in a scheme for the partition  of Turkey. Lord Malmesbury, who a few years later became Foreign  Secretary, states in his memoirs that during this visit, the Czar, Sir  Robert Peel, the Duke of Wellington, and Lord Aberdeen \"drew up and  signed a Memorandum, the spirit and scope of which was to support  Russia in her legitimate protectorship of the Greek religion and  the Holy Shrines, and to do so without consulting France,\" but  the Memorandum was in reality only one made by Nicholas of his  recollection of the interview, and communicated subsequently to Lord  Aberdeen.    No events of special interest took place in other parts of Europe;  the condition of affairs in the Peninsula improved, though the  announcement of the unfortunate marriage of the Queen Mother with  the Duke of Rianzares was not of hopeful augury for the young Queen  Isabella's future; as a matter of fact, the marriage had taken place  some time previously.          CHAPTER XIII    1844      _Queen Victoria to the King of the Belgians._    WINDSOR CASTLE, _9th January 1844._    MY DEAREST UNCLE,--I had the pleasure of receiving your kind letter of  the 4th, which is written from Ardenne, where I grieve to see you are  again gone without my beloved Louise.    Charlotte is the admiration of every one, and I wish much I could have  seen the three dear children _en representation_.    Our fat Vic or Pussette learns a verse of _Lamartine_ by heart, which  ends with \"le tableau se deroule a mes pieds\"; to show how well she  had understood this difficult line which Mdlle. Charier had explained  to her, I must tell you the following _bon mot_. When she was riding  on her pony, and looking at the cows and sheep, she turned to Mdlle.  Charier and said: \"_Voila_ le tableau qui se deroule a mes pieds.\" Is  not this extraordinary for a little child of three years old? It is  more like what a person of twenty would say. You have no notion _what_  a knowing, and I am sorry to say _sly_, little rogue she is, and  so _obstinate_. She and _le petit Frere_ accompany us to dear old  Claremont to-day; Alice remains here under Lady Lyttelton's care. How  sorry I am that you should have hurt your leg, and in such a provoking  way; Albert says he remembers well your playing often with a pen-knife  when you talked, and I remember it also, but it is really dangerous.

JULY 1904. The Original-Series Texts for 1903 were: No. 122, Part II of  _The Laud MS. Troy-Book_, edited from the unique Laud MS. 595 by Dr.  J. E. Wülting; and No. 123, Part II of Robert of Brunne's _Handlyng  Synne_, and its French original, ed. by Dr. F. J. Furnivall.    The Extra-Series Texts for 1903 are to be: No. LXXXVIII, _Le Morte  Arthur_, in 8-line stanzas, re-edited from the unique MS. Harl. 2252,  by Prof. J. Douglas Bruce (issued), No. LXXXIX, Lydgate's _Reason and  Sensuality_, edited by Dr. Ernst Sieper, Part II, and _English Fragments  from Latin Medieval Service-Books_, edited, and given to the Society, by  Mr. Henry Littlehales.    The Original-Series Texts for 1904 will be No. 124, t. Hen. V,  _Twenty-six Political and other Poems_ from the Digby MS. 102, &c,  edited by Dr. J. Kail, and No. 125, Part I of the _Medieval Records of  a London City Church_ (St. Mary-at-Hill), A.D. 1420-1559, copied and  edited by Mr. Henry Littlehales from the Church Records in the  Guildhall, the cost of the setting and corrections of the text being  generously borne by its Editor. This book will show the income and  outlay of the church; the drink provided for its Palm-Sunday players,  its officers' excursions into Kent and Essex, its dealing with the  Plague, the disposal of its goods at the Reformation, &c., &c., and will  help our members to realize the church-life of its time. The third Text  will be Part I of _An Alphabet of Tales_, a very interesting collection,  englisht in the Northern Dialect, about 1440, from the Latin _Alphabetum  Narrationum_ by Etienne de Bésançon, and edited by Mrs. M. M. Banks from  the unique MS. in the King's Library in the British Museum; the  above-named three texts are now ready for issue. Those for 1905 and 1906  will probably be chosen from Part II of the _Exeter Book_--Anglo-Saxon  Poems from the unique MS. in Exeter Cathedral--re-edited by Israel  Gollancz, M.A.; Part II of Prof. Dr. Holthausen's _Vices and Virtues_;  Part II of _Jacob's Well_, edited by Dr. Brandeis; the Alliterative  _Siege of Jerusalem_, edited by the late Prof. Dr. E. Kölbing and Prof.  Dr. Kaluza; an Introduction and Glossary to the _Minor Poems of the  Vernon MS._ by H. Hartley, M.A.; Alain Chartier's _Quadrilogue_, edited  from the unique MS. Univ. Coll. Oxford MS. No. 85, by Mr. J. W. H.  Atkins of Owen's College; a Northern Verse _Chronicle of England_ to  1327 A.D., in 42,000 lines, about 1420 A.D., edited by M. L. Perrin,  B.A.; Prof. Bruce's Introduction to _The English Conquest of Ireland_,  Part II; and Dr. Furnivall's edition of the _Lichfield Gilds_, which is  all printed, and waits only for the Introduction, that Prof. E. C. K.  Gonner has kindly undertaken to write for the book. Canon Wordsworth of  Marlborough has given the Society a copy of the Leofric Canonical Rule,  Latin and Anglo-Saxon, Parker MS. 191, C.C.C. Cambridge, and Prof.  Napier will edit it, with a fragment of the englisht Capitula of Bp.  Theodulf. The _Coventry Leet Book_ is being copied for the Society by  Miss M. Dormer Harris--helpt by a contribution from the Common Council  of the City,--and will be publisht by the Society (Miss Harris editing),  as its contribution to our knowledge of the provincial city life of the  15th century.    Dr. Brie of Berlin has undertaken to edit the prose _Brut_ or _Chronicle  of Britain_ attributed to Sir John Mandeville, and printed by Caxton. He  has already examined more than 100 English MSS. and several French ones,  to get the best text, and find out its source.    The Extra-Series Texts for 1904 will be chosen from Lydgate's  _DeGuilleville's Pilgrimage of the Life of Man_, Part III, edited by  Miss Locock; Dr. M. Konrath's re-edition of _William of Shorcham's  Poems_, Part II; Dr. E. A. Kock's edition of Lovelich's _Merlin_ from  the unique MS. in Corpus Christi Coll., Cambridge; the _Macro Plays_,  edited from Mr. Gurney's MS. by Dr. Furnivall and A. W. Pollard, M.A.;  Prof. Erdmann's re-edition of Lydgate's _Siege of Thebes_ (issued also  by the Chaucer Society); Miss Rickert's re-edition of the Romance of  _Emare_; Prof. I. Gollanez's re-edition of two Alliterative Poems,  _Winner and Waster_, &c, ab. 1360, lately issued for the Roxburghe Club;  Dr. Norman Moore's re-edition of _The Book of the Foundation of St.  Bartholomew's Hospital, London_, from the unique MS. ab. 1425, which  gives an account of the Founder, Rahere, and the miraculous cures  wrought at the Hospital; _The Craft of Nombrynge_, with other of the  earliest englisht Treatises on Arithmetic, edited by R. Steele, B.A.;  and Miss Warren's two-text edition of _The Dance of Death_ from the  Ellesmere and other MSS.    These Extra-Series Texts ought to be completed by their Editors: the  Second Part of the prose Romance of _Melusine_--Introduction, with ten  facsimiles of the best woodblocks of the old foreign black-letter  editions, Glossary, &c, by A. K. Donald, B.A. (now in India); and a new  edition of the famous Early-English Dictionary (English and Latin),  _Promptorium Parvulorum_, from the Winchester MS., ab. 1440 A.D.: in  this, the Editor, the Rev. A. L. Mayhew, M.A., will follow and print his  MS. not only in its arrangement of nouns first, and verbs second, under  every letter of the Alphabet, but also in its giving of the flexions of  the words. The Society's edition will thus be the first modern one that  really represents its original, a point on which Mr. Mayhew's insistence  will meet with the sympathy of all our Members.    The Texts for the Extra Series in 1906 and 1907 will be chosen from _The  Three Kings' Sons_, Part II, the Introduction &c. by Prof. Dr. Leon  Kellner; Part II of _The Chester Plays_, re-edited from the MSS., with a  full collation of the formerly missing Devonshire MS., by Mr. G. England  and Dr. Matthews; the Parallel-Text of the only two MSS. of the _Owl and  Nightingale_, edited by Mr. G. F. H. Sykes (at press); Prof. Jespersen's  editions of John Hart's _Orthographie_ (MS. 1551 A.D.; blackletter  1569), and _Method to teach Reading_, 1570; Deguilleville's _Pilgrimage  of the Sowle_, in English prose, edited by Prof. Dr. L. Kellner. (For  the three prose versions of _The Pilgrimage of the Life of Man_--two  English, one French--an Editor is wanted.) Members are askt to realise  the fact that the Society has now 50 years' work on its Lists,--at its  present rate of production,--and that there is from 100 to 200 more  years' work to come after that. The year 2000 will not see finisht all  the Texts that the Society ought to print. The need of more Members and  money is pressing. Offers of help from willing Editors have continually  to be declined because the Society has no funds to print their Texts.    An urgent appeal is hereby made to Members to increase the list of  Subscribers to the E. E. Text Society. It is nothing less than a scandal  that the Hellenic Society should have nearly 1000 members, while the  Early English Text Society has not 300!    Before his death in 1895, Mr. G. N. Currie was preparing an edition of  the 15th and 16th century Prose Versions of Guillaume de Deguilleville's  _Pilgrimage of the Life of Man_, with the French prose version by Jean  Gallopes, from Lord Aldenham's MS., he having generously promist to pay  the extra cost of printing the French text, and engraving one or two of  the illuminations in his MS. But Mr. Currie, when on his deathbed,  charged a friend to burn _all_ his MSS. which lay in a corner of his  room, and unluckily all the E. E. T. S.'s copies of the Deguilleville  prose versions were with them, and were burnt with them, so that the  Society will be put to the cost of fresh copies, Mr. Currie having died  in debt.    Guillaume de Deguilleville, monk of the Cistercian abbey of Chaalis, in  the diocese of Senlis, wrote his first verse _Pèlerinaige de l'Homme_ in  1330-1 when he was 36.[1] Twenty-five (or six) years after, in 1355, he  revised his poem, and issued a second version of it,[2] a revision of  which was printed ab. 1500. Of the prose representative of the first  version, 1330-1, a prose Englishing, about 1430 A.D., was edited by Mr.  Aldis Wright for the Roxburghe Club in 1869, from MS. Ff. 5. 30 in the  Cambridge University Library. Other copies of this prose English are in  the Hunterian Museum, Glasgow, Q. 2. 25; Sion College, London; and the  Laud Collection in the Bodleian, no. 740.[3] A copy in the Northern  dialect is MS. G. 21, in St. John's Coll., Cambridge, and this is the  MS. which will be edited for the E. E. Text Society. The Laud MS. 740  was somewhat condenst and modernised, in the 17th century, into MS. Ff.  6. 30, in the Cambridge University Library:[4] \"The Pilgrime or the  Pilgrimage of Man in this World,\" copied by Will. Baspoole, whose copy  \"was verbatim written by Walter Parker, 1645, and from thence  transcribed by G. G. 1649; and from thence by W. A. 1655.\" This last  copy may have been read by, or its story reported to, Bunyan, and may  have been the groundwork of his _Pilgrim's Progress_. It will be edited  for the E. E. T. Soc., its text running under the earlier English, as in  Mr. Herrtage's edition of the _Gesta Romanorum_ for the Society. In  February 1464,[5] Jean Gallopes--a clerk of Angers, afterwards chaplain  to John, Duke of Bedford, Regent of France--turned Deguilleville's first  verse _Pèlerinaige_ into a prose _Pèlerinage de la vie humaine_.[6] By  the kindness of Lord Aldenham, as above mentiond, Gallopes's French text  will be printed opposite the early prose northern Englishing in the  Society's edition.    The Second Version of Deguilleville's _Pèlerinaige de l'Homme_, A.D.  1355 or -6, was englisht in verse by Lydgate in 1426. Of Lydgate's poem,  the larger part is in the Cotton MS. Vitellius C. xiii (leaves 2-308).  This MS. leaves out Chaucer's englishing of"]]]
