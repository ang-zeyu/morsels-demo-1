Thorstein said: \"I cannot blame you two for having done this; most  things will fall as they are fated, and well have ye covered over my  folly: so look I on this maiden that I deem it great good luck to have  so fair a child. But now, what is her name?\"    \"Helga she is called,\" says Thorgerd.    \"Helga the Fair,\" says Thorstein. \"But now shalt thou make her ready to  come home with me.\"    She did so, and Thorstein was led out with good gifts, and Helga rode  with him to his home, and was brought up there with much honour and  great love from father and mother and all her kin.          CHAPTER IV.     Of Gunnlaug Worm-tongue and his Kin.    Now at this time there dwelt at Gilsbank, up in White-water-side, Illugi  the Black, son of Hallkel, the son of Hrosskel. The mother of Illugi was  Thurid Dandle, daughter of Gunnlaug Worm-tongue.    Illugi was the next greatest chief in Burg-firth after Thorstein  Egilson. He was a man of broad lands and hardy of mood, and wont to do  well to his friends; he had to wife Ingibiorg, the daughter of Asbiorn  Hordson, from Ornolfsdale; the mother of Ingibiorg was Thorgerd, the  daughter of Midfirth-Skeggi. The children of Illugi and Ingibiorg were  many, but few of them have to do with this story. Hermund was one of  their sons, and Gunnlaug another; both were hopeful men, and at this  time of ripe growth.    It is told of Gunnlaug that he was quick of growth in his early youth,  big, and strong; his hair was light red, and very goodly of fashion; he  was dark-eyed, somewhat ugly-nosed, yet of lovesome countenance; thin  of flank he was, and broad of shoulder, and the best-wrought of men; his  whole mind was very masterful; eager was he from his youth up, and in  all wise unsparing and hardy; he was a great skald, but somewhat bitter  in his rhyming, and therefore was he called Gunnlaug Worm-tongue.    Hermund was the best beloved of the two brothers, and had the mien of a  great man.    When Gunnlaug was fifteen winters old he prayed his father for goods to  fare abroad withal, and said he had will to travel and see the manners  of other folk. Master Illugi was slow to take the matter up, and said he  was unlike to be deemed good in the out-lands \"when I can scarcely shape  thee to my own liking at home.\"    On a morning but a very little afterwards it happened that Illugi came  out early, and saw that his storehouse was opened, and that some  sacks of wares, six of them, had been brought out into the road, and  therewithal too some pack-gear. Now, as he wondered at this, there came  up a man leading four horses, and who should it be but his son Gunnlaug.  Then said he:--    \"I it was who brought out the sacks.\"    Illugi asked him why he had done so. He said that they should make his  faring goods.    Illugi said: \"In nowise shalt thou thwart my will, nor fare anywhere  sooner than I like!\" and in again he swung the ware-sacks therewith.    Then Gunnlaug rode thence and came in the evening down to Burg, and  goodman Thorstein asked him to bide there, and Gunnlaug was fain of  that proffer. He told Thorstein how things had gone betwixt him and his  father, and Thorstein offered to let him bide there as long as he liked,  and for some seasons Gunnlaug abode there, and learned law-craft of  Thorstein, and all men accounted well of him.    Now Gunnlaug and Helga would be always at the chess-playing together,  and very soon each found favour with the other, as came to be proven  well enough afterwards: they were very nigh of an age.    Helga was so fair, that men of lore say that she was the fairest woman  of Iceland, then or since; her hair was so plenteous and long that it  could cover her all over, and it was as fair as a band of gold; nor was  there any so good to choose as Helga the Fair in all Burgfirth, and far  and wide elsewhere.    Now one day, as men sat in the hall at Burg, Gunnlaug spake to  Thorstein: \"One thing in law there is which thou hast not taught me, and  that is how to woo me a wife.\"    Thorstein said, \"That is but a small matter,\" and therewith taught him  how to go about it.    Then said Gunnlaug, \"Now shalt thou try if I have understood all: I  shall take thee by the hand and make as if I were wooing thy daughter  Helga.\"    \"I see no need of that,\" says Thorstein. Gunnlaug, however, groped  then and there after his hand, and seizing it said, \"Nay, grant me this  though.\"    \"Do as thou wilt, then,\" said Thorstein; \"but be it known to all who  are hereby that this shall be as if it had been unspoken, nor shall any  guile follow herein.\"    Then Gunnlaug named for himself witnesses, and betrothed Helga to him,  and asked thereafter if it would stand good thus. Thorstein said that it  was well; and those who were present were mightily pleased at all this.          CHAPTER V.     Of Raven and his Kin.    There was a man called Onund, who dwelt in the south at Mossfell: he  was the wealthiest of men, and had a priesthood south there about the  nesses. He was married, and his wife was called Geirny. She was the  daughter of Gnup, son of Mold-Gnup, who settled at Grindwick, in the  south country. Their sons were Raven, and Thorarin, and Eindridi; they  were all hopeful men, but Raven was in all wise the first of them. He  was a big man and a strong, the sightliest of men and a good skald;  and when he was fully grown he fared between sundry lands, and was well  accounted of wherever he came.    Thorod the Sage, the son of Eyvind, then dwelt at Hjalli, south in  Olfus, with Skapti his son, who was then the spokesman-at-law in  Iceland. The mother of Skapti was Ranveig, daughter of Gnup, the son of  Mold-Gnup; and Skapti and the sons of Onund were sisters' sons. Between  these kinsmen was much friendship as well as kinship.    At this time Thorfin, the son of Selthorir, dwelt at Red-Mel, and  had seven sons, who were all the hopefullest of men; and of them were  these--Thorgils, Eyjolf, and Thorir; and they were all the greatest men  out there. But these men who have now been named lived all at one and  the same time.    Next to this befell those tidings, the best that ever have befallen here  in Iceland, that the whole land became Christian, and that all folk cast  off the old faith.          CHAPTER VI. How Helga was vowed to Gunnlaug, and of Gunnlaug's  faring abroad.    Gunnlaug Worm-Tongue was, as is aforesaid, whiles at Burg with  Thorstein, whiles with his father Illugi at Gilsbank, three winters  together, and was by now eighteen winters old; and father and son were  now much more of a mind.    There was a man called Thorkel the Black; he was a house-carle of  Illugi, and near akin to him, and had been brought up in his house. To  him fell an heritage north at As, in Water-dale, and he prayed Gunnlaug  to go with him thither. This he did, and so they rode, the two together,  to As. There they got the fee; it was given up to them by those who had  the keeping of it, mostly because of Gunnlaug's furtherance.    But as they rode from the north they guested at Grimstongue, at a rich  bonder's who dwelt there; but in the morning a herdsman took Gunnlaug's  horse, and it had sweated much by then he got it back. Then Gunnlaug  smote the herdsman, and stunned him; but the bonder would in nowise bear  this, and claimed boot therefor. Gunnlaug offered to pay him one mark.  The bonder thought it too little.    Then Gunnlaug sang,--              \"Bade I the middling mighty            To have a mark of waves' flame;            Giver of grey seas? glitter,            This gift shalt thou make shift with.            If the elf sun of the waters            From out of purse thou lettest,            O waster of the worm's bedy            Awaits thee sorrow later.\"    So the peace was made as Gunnlaug bade, and in such wise the two rode  south.    Now, a little while after, Gunnlaug asked his father a second time for  goods for going abroad.    Illugi says, \"Now shalt thou have thy will, for thou hast wrought  thyself into something better than thou wert.\" So Illugi rode hastily  from home, and bought for Gunnlaug half a ship which lay in Gufaros,  from Audun Festargram--this Audun was he who would not flit abroad the  sons of Oswif the Wise, after the slaying of Kiartan Olafson, as is  told in the story of the Laxdalemen, which thing though betid later than  this.--And when Illugi came home, Gunnlaug thanked him well.    Thorkel the Black betook himself to seafaring with Gunnlaug, and their  wares were brought to the ship; but Gunnlaug was at Burg while they made  her ready, and found more cheer in talk with Helga than in toiling with  chapmen.    Now one day Thorstein asked Gunnlaug if he would ride to his horses with  him up to Long-water-dale. Gunnlaug said he would. So they ride both  together till they come to the mountain-dairies of Thorstein, called  Thorgils-stead. There were stud-horses of Thorstein, four of them  together, all red of hue. There was one horse very goodly, but little  tried: this horse Thorstein offered to give to Gunnlaug. He said he was  in no need of horses, as he was going away from the country; and so they  ride to other stud-horses. There was a grey horse with four mares, and  he was the best of horses in Burgfirth. This one, too, Thorstein offered  to give Gunnlaug, but he said, \"I desire these in no wise more than the  others; but why dost thou not bid me what I will take?\"    \"What is that?\" said Thorstein.    \"Helga the Fair, thy daughter,\" says Gunnlaug.    \"That rede is not to be settled so hastily,\" said Thorstein; and  therewithal got on other talk. And now they ride homewards down along  Long-water.    "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/2443"],[0,"The Story of the Mormons, from the Date of Their Origin to the Year 1901 (#2)"],[1,"of these works contain interesting pictures of life in Utah  in those early days.    There are three comprehensive histories of Utah,--H. H. Bancroft's  \"History of Utah\" (p. 889), Tullidge's \"History of Salt Lake City\" (p.  886), and Orson F. Whitney's \"History of Utah,\" in four volumes, three  of which, dated respectively March, 1892, April, 1893, and January,  1898, have been issued. The Reorganized Church has also published a  \"History of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints\" in three  volumes. While Bancroft's work professes to be written from a secular  standpoint, it is really a church production, the preparation of the  text having been confided to Mormon hands. \"We furnished Mr. Bancroft  with his material,\" said a prominent Mormon church officer to me. Its  plan is to give the Mormon view in the text, and to refer the reader for  the other side to a mass of undigested notes, and its principal value to  the student consists in its references to other authorities. Its general  tone may be seen in its declaration that those who have joined the  church to expose its secrets are \"the most contemptible of all\"; that  those who have joined it honestly and, discovering what company they  have got into, have given the information to the world, would far better  have gone their way and said nothing about it; and, as to polygamy, that  \"those who waxed the hottest against\" the practice \"are not as a rule  the purest of our people\" (p. 361); and that the Edmunds Law of 1882  \"capped the climax of absurdity\" (p. 683).    Tullidge wrote his history after he had taken part in the \"New  Movement.\" In it he brought together a great deal of information,  including the text of important papers, which is necessary to an  understanding of the growth and struggles of the church. The work was  censored by a committee appointed by the Mormon authorities.    Bishop Whitney's history presents the pro-Mormon view of the church  throughout. It is therefore wholly untrustworthy as a guide to opinion  on the subjects treated, but, like Tullidge's, it supplies a good deal  of material which is useful to the student who is prepared to estimate  its statements at their true value.    The acquisition by the New York Public Library of the Berrian collection  of books, early newspapers, and pamphlets on Mormonism, with the  additions constantly made to this collection, places within the reach of  the student all the material that is necessary for the formation of the  fairest judgment on the subject.
