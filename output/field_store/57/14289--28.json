These are my tooth-gifts to my son.\"    The boy grew fast, for as soon as he could walk about he was out of  doors most of the time. He ran in the woods and climbed the hills and  waded in the creek. He was much with his tooth thrall, for the king had  said to Olaf:    \"Be ever at his call.\"    Now this Olaf was full of stories, and Harald liked to hear them.    \"Come out to Aegir's Rock, Olaf, and tell me stories,\" he said almost  every day.    So they started off across the hills. The man wore a long, loose coat of  white wool, belted at the waist with a strap. He had on coarse shoes  and leather leggings. Around his neck was an iron collar welded together  so that it could not come off. On it were strange marks, called runes,  that said:    \"Olaf, thrall of Halfdan.\"    But Harald's clothes were gay. A cape of gray velvet hung from his  shoulders. It was fastened over his breast with great gold buckles. When  it waved in the wind, a scarlet lining flashed out, and the bottom of a  little scarlet jacket showed. His feet and legs were covered with gray  woolen tights. Gold lacings wound around his legs from his shoes to his  knees. A band of gold held down his long, yellow hair.    It was a wild country that these two were walking over. They were  climbing steep, rough hills. Some of them seemed made all of rock, with  a little earth lying in spots. Great rocks hung out from them, with  trees growing in their cracks. Some big pieces had broken off and rolled  down the hill.    \"Thor broke them,\" Olaf said. \"He rides through the sky and hurls his  hammer at clouds and at mountains. That makes the thunder and the  lightning and cracks the hills. His hammer never misses its aim, and it  always comes back to his hand and is eager to go again.\"    When they reached the top of the hill they looked back. Far below was a  soft, green valley. In front of it the sea came up into the land and  made a fiord. On each side of the fiord high walls of rock stood up and  made the water black with shadow. All around the valley were high hills  with dark pines on them. Far off were the mountains. In the valley were  Halfdan's houses around their square yard.    \"How little our houses look down there!\" Harald said. \"But I can  almost--yes, I can see the red dragon on the roof of the feast hall. Do  you remember when I climbed up and sat on his head, Olaf?\"    He laughed and kicked his heels and ran on.    [Illustration: \"_He threw back his cape and drew a little dagger from  his belt_\"]    At last they came to Aegir's Rock and walked up on its flat top. Harald  went to the edge and looked over. A ragged wall of rock reached down,  and two hundred feet below was the black water of the fiord. Olaf  watched him for a while, then he said:    \"No whitening of your cheek, Harald? Good! A boy that can face the fall  of Aegir's Rock will not be afraid to face the war flash when he is a  man.\"    \"Ho, I am not afraid of the war flash now,\" cried Harald.    He threw back his cape and drew a little dagger from his belt.    \"See!\" he cried; \"does this not flash like a sword? And I am not afraid.  But after all, this is a baby thing! When I am eight years old I will  have a sword, a sharp tooth of war.\"    He swung his dagger as though it were a long sword. Then he ran and sat  on a rock by Olaf.    \"Why is this Aegir's Rock?\" he asked.    \"You know that Asgard is up in the sky,\" Olaf said. \"It is a wonderful  city where the golden houses of the gods are in the golden grove. A  high wall runs all around it. In the house of Odin, the All-father,  there is a great feast hall larger than the whole earth. Its name is  Valhalla. It has five hundred doors. The rafters are spears. The roof is  thatched with shields. Armor lies on the benches. In the high seat sits  Odin, a golden helmet on his head, a spear in his hand. Two wolves lie  at his feet. At his right hand and his left sit all the gods and  goddesses, and around the hall sit thousands and thousands of men, all  the brave ones that have ever died.    \"Now it is good to be in Valhalla; for there is mead there better than  men can brew, and it never runs out. And there are skalds that sing  wonderful songs that men never heard. And before the doors of Valhalla  is a great meadow where the warriors fight every day and get glorious  and sweet wounds and give many. And all night they feast, and their  wounds heal. But none may go to Valhalla except warriors that have died  bravely in battle. Men who die from sickness go with women and children  and cowards to Niflheim. There Hela, who is queen, always sneers at  them, and a terrible cold takes hold of their bones, and they sit down  and freeze.    \"Years ago Aegir was a great warrior. Aegir the Big-handed, they called  him. In many a battle his sword had sung, and he had sent many warriors  to Valhalla. Many swords had bit into his flesh and left marks there,  but never a one had struck him to death. So his hair grew white and his  arms thin. There was peace in that country then, and Aegir sorrowed,  saying:    \"'I am old. Battles are still. Must I die in bed like a woman? Shall I  not see Valhalla?'    \"Now thus did Odin say long ago:    \"'If a man is old and is come near death and cannot die in fight, let  him find death in some brave way and he shall feast with me in  Valhalla.'    \"So one day Aegir came to this rock.    \"'A deed to win Valhalla!' he cried.    \"Then he drew his sword and flashed it over his head and held his shield  high above him, and leaped out into the air and died in the water of  the fiord.\"    \"Ho!\" cried Harald, jumping to his feet. \"I think that Odin stood up  before his high seat and welcomed that man gladly when he walked through  the door of Valhalla.\"    \"So the songs say,\" replied Olaf, \"for skalds still sing of that deed  all over Norway.\"    [Decoration]          [Illustration]    Olaf's Farm      At another time Harald asked:    \"What is your country, Olaf? Have you always been a thrall?\"    The thrall's eyes flashed.    \"When you are a man,\" he said, \"and go a-viking to Denmark, ask men  whether they ever heard of Olaf the Crafty. There, far off, is my  country, across the water. My father was Gudbrand the Big. Two hundred  warriors feasted in his hall and followed him to battle. Ten sons sat at  meat with him, and I was the youngest. One day he said:    \"'You are all grown to be men. There is not elbow-room here for so many  chiefs. The eldest of you shall have my farm when I die. The rest of  you, off a-viking!'    \"He had three ships. These he gave to three of my brothers. But I stayed  that spring and built me a boat. I made her for only twenty oars because  I thought few men would follow me; for I was young, fifteen years old.  I made her in the likeness of a dragon. At the prow I carved the head  with open mouth and forked tongue thrust out. I painted the eyes red for  anger.    \"'There, stand so!' I said, 'and glare and hiss at my foes.'    \"In the stern I curved the tail up almost as high as the head. There I  put the pilot's seat and a strong tiller for the rudder. On the breast  and sides I carved the dragon's scales. Then I painted it all black and  on the tip of every scale I put gold. I called her 'Waverunner.' There  she sat on the rollers, as fair a ship as I ever saw.    \"The night that it was finished I went to my father's feast. After the  meats were eaten and the mead-horns came round, I stood up from my bench  and raised my drinking-horn[3] high and spoke with a great voice:    \"'This is my vow: I will sail to Norway and I will harry the coast and  fill my boat with riches. Then I will get me a farm and will winter in  that land. Now who will follow me?'    \"'He is but a boy,' the men said. 'He has opened his mouth wider than he  can do.'    \"But others jumped to their feet with their mead-horns in their hands.  Thirty men, one after another, raised their horns and said:    \"'I will follow this lad, and I will not turn back so long as he and I  live!'    \"On the next morning we got into my dragon and started. I sat high in  the pilot's seat. As our boat flashed down the rollers into the water I  made this song and sang it:        \"'The dragon runs.      Where will she steer?      Where swords will sing,      Where spears will bite,      Where I shall laugh.'    \"So we harried the coast of Norway. We ate at many men's tables  uninvited. Many men we found overburdened with gold. Then I said:    \"'My dragon's belly is never full,' and on board went the gold.    \"Oh! it is better to live on the sea and let other men raise your crops  and cook your meals. A house smells of smoke, a ship smells of frolic.  From a house you see a sooty roof, from a ship you see Valhalla.    \"Up and down the water we went to get much wealth and much frolic. After  a while my men said:    \"'What of the farm, Olaf?'    \"'Not yet,' I answered. 'Viking is better for summer. When the ice  comes, and our dragon cannot play, then we will get our farm and sit  down.'    \"At last the winter came, and I said to my men:    \"'Now for the farm. I have my eye on one up the coast a way in King  Halfdan's country.'    \"So we set off for it. We landed late at night and pulled our boat up on  shore and walked quietly to the house. It was rather a wealthy farm, for  there were stables and a storehouse and a smithy at the sides of the  house. There was but one door to the house. We went to it, and I struck  it with my spear.    [Illustration: \"_I struck my shield against the door so that it made a  great clanging_\"]    \"'Hello! Ho! Hello!' I shouted, and my men made a great din.    \"At last some one from inside said:    \"'Who calls?'    \"'I call,' I answered. 'Open! or you will think it Thor who calls,' and  I struck my shield against the door so that it made a great clanging.    \"The door opened only a little, but I pushed"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/24821"],[0,"Diamond Dyke (#2)"],[1,"so wild.\"    \"You mean, I won't set a seed to-day and dig it up to-morrow to see why  it hasn't come up.\"    \"That's what you always say,\" said Dyke grumpily.    \"Yes, because we came out here with so many hundred pounds, Dicky, to  try an experiment--to make an ostrich-farm.\"    \"And we've failed.\"    \"Oh dear, no, my lad.  We've spent all our money--invested it here in a  wagon and oxen and house.\"    \"House!  Ha, ha, ha!  What a house!\"    \"Not handsome, certainly, Dicky.\"    \"Dicky!  There you go again.\"    \"Yes, there I go again.  And in our enclosures and pens, and horses and  guns and ammunition, and in paying our men.  So we can't afford to give  up if we wanted to.\"    \"But see what a desolate place it is!\"    \"Big, vast, level, and wild, but the very spot for our purpose.\"    \"And not a neighbour near.\"    \"To quarrel with?  No, not one.  No, Dyke, we mustn't give it up; and  some day you'll say I'm right.\"    \"Never,\" cried the boy emphatically.    \"Never's a long day, Dyke.--Look here, lad, I'm going to tell you an old  story.\"    \"Thankye,\" said Dyke sullenly.  \"I know--about Bruce and the spider.\"    \"Wrong, old fellow, this time.  Another author's story that you don't  know.\"    \"Bother the old stories!\" cried the boy.    The big manly fellow laughed good-humouredly.    \"Poor old Dyke! he has got it badly this time.  What is it--prickly heat  or home-sickness, or what?\"    \"Everything.  I'm as miserable as mizzer,\" cried Dick.  \"Oh, this desert  is dreary.\"    \"Not it, Dyke; it's wild and grand.  You are tired and disappointed.  Some days must be dark and dreary, boy.  Come, Dyke, pluck! pluck!  pluck!\"    \"I haven't got any; sun's dried it all out of me.\"    \"Has it?\" said his brother, laughing.  \"I don't believe it.  No, Dicky,  we can't go home and sneak in at the back door with our tails between  our legs, like two beaten hounds.  There are those at home who would  sorrow for us, and yet feel that they despised us.  We came out here to  win, and win we will, if our perseverance will do it.\"    \"Well, haven't we tried, and hasn't everything failed?\"    \"No, boy,\" cried the young man excitedly.  \"Look here: my story is of a  party of American loafers down by a river.  Come, I never told you  that.\"    \"No,\" said Dyke, raising his brown face from where he rested it upon his  arm.    \"That's better.  Then you can be interested still.\"    \"One needs something to interest one in this miserable, dried-up  desert,\" cried the boy.    \"Miserable, dried-up desert!\" said his brother, speaking in a low deep  voice, as he gazed right away through the transparent air at the  glorious colours where the sun sank in a canopy of amber and gold.  \"No,  Dicky, it has its beauties, in spite of all you say.\"    \"Oh Joe!\" cried the boy, \"what a tiresome old chap you are.  Didn't you  say you were going to tell me a story about some Americans down by a  river?  Oh, how I should like to get to a mill-race and have a bathe.  Do go on.\"    \"Ah! to be sure.  Well, I only want you to take notice of one part of  it.  The rest is brag.\"    \"Then it's a moral story,\" cried Dyke, in a disappointed tone.    \"Yes, if you like; but it may be fresh to you.\"    \"'Tain't about ostriches, is it?\"    \"No.--They were throwing stones.\"    \"What!--the loafers?\"    \"Yes, from a wharf, to see who could throw farthest, and one man, who  was looking on, sneered at them, and began to boast about how far he  could throw.  They laughed at him, and one of them made himself very  objectionable and insulting, with the result that the boasting man said,  if it came to the point, he could throw the other fellow right across  the river.  Of course there was a roar of laughter at this, and one chap  bet a dollar that he could not.\"    \"And of course he couldn't,\" said Dyke, who forgot his prickly heat and  irritation.  \"But you said it was all brag.  Well?\"    \"The boastful fellow, as soon as the wager was laid, seized the other by  the waistband, heaved him up, and pitched him off the wharf into the  river, amidst roars of laughter, which were kept up as the man came  drenched out of the river, and asked to be paid.    \"`Oh no,' said the other; `I didn't say I'd do it the first time.  But I  kin dew it, and I will dew it, if I try till to-morrow morning;' and  catching hold of the wet man, he heaved him up again, and threw him by a  tremendous effort nearly a couple of yards out into the river.  Down he  went out of sight in the deep water, and out he scrambled again, hardly  able to speak, when he was seized once more.    \"`Third time never fails,' cried the fellow; but the other had had  enough of it, and owned he was beaten.\"    \"But it was by an artful trick,\" cried Dyke.    \"Of course it was, boy; but what I want you to notice was the spirit of  the thing, though it was only bragging; I kin dew it, and I will dew it,  if I try till to-morrow morning.  We kin dew it, and we will dew  it, Dyke, even if we have to try till to-morrow morning--  to-morrow-come-never-morning.\"    \"Oh!\" groaned Dyke, sinking back upon the sand; \"I am so hot and dry.\"        CHAPTER TWO.    DYKE ROUSES UP.    That was months before the opening of our story, when Dyke was making  his way in disgust toward the moist shade of the kopje, where, deep down  from cracks of the granite rock, the spring gurgled out.    Only a part ran for a few yards, and then disappeared in the sand,  without once reaching to where the sun blazed down.    Joe Emson shouted once more, but Dyke would not turn his head.    \"Let him follow me if he wants me,\" muttered the boy.  \"He isn't half so  hot as I am.\"    Hot or not hot, the big fellow took off his broad Panama hat, gave his  head a vicious rub, replaced it, and turned to shout again.  \"Jack!  Ahoy, Jack!\"    There was no reply to this, for Kaffir Jack lay behind the house in a  very hot place, fast asleep upon the sand, with his dark skin glistening  in the sunshine, the pigment within keeping off the blistering sunburn  which would have followed had the skin been white.    \"I shall have to go after him,\" muttered Joe Emson; and, casting off the  feeling of languor which had impelled him to call others instead of  acting himself, he braced himself up, left the scorching iron house  behind, and trotted after Dyke, scaring a group of stupid-looking young  ostriches into a run behind the wire fence.    He knew where he would find his half-brother, and there he was, lying  upon his breast, with a cushion of green mossy growth beneath him, a  huge hanging rock overhead casting a broad shade, and the water gurgling  cool and clear so close that he had but to stretch out his hand to scoop  it up and drink from the palm.    Outside there was the scorching, blinding sunshine, however, and among  the rocks all looked black, and seemed rather cool.    \"Oh, you lazy young sybarite!\" cried Joe Emson, as he came up.  \"You  always know the best places.  Why didn't you answer me?\"    \"What's the good of answering?\" cried Dyke.  \"I can't help old Goblin  getting away again.  He will go, and nothing will stop him.\"    \"But something shall stop him,\" said Joe.  \"I'll have an iron bar driven  into the ground, and tether him with a rope.\"    \"No good,\" said Dyke drowsily: \"he'd eat the rope and swallow the bar.\"    \"Then I'll tether him with a piece of chain.\"    \"He'd roll it up and swallow it.--I say Joe, I feel sure he had that  curb chain and the two buckles we missed.\"    \"Nonsense!  Come, get up, and help drive him in.\"    \"I'm too tired, and it isn't nonsense.  He's always on the lookout for  bits of iron and broken crockery.  I took a hammer and a cracked  willow-pattern plate one day, and broke it up in bits and fed him with  them.  He ate them all.\"    \"Well, of course: birds do pick up stones and things to fill their  gizzards.\"    \"And that's just how I feel,\" said Dyke.    \"Eh?  How?\"    \"As if my gizzard was filled with sharp bits of stone, and it makes me  irritable and cross.\"    \"And lazy.  Come: jump up.\"    \"I can't, Joe.  I said last time I'd never go after the goblin again,  and I won't.\"    \"Yes, you will; you'll come and help me drive him in.\"    \"No: let him go.\"    \"Nonsense!  He's the best cock bird I've got.\"    \"Then the others must be bad ones,\" grumbled Dyke.    \"Get up, sir!\" cried Joe, stirring the boy with his toe.    \"Shan't.  I don't mind your kicking.\"    \"Get up, or I'll duck you in the spring.\"    \"Wouldn't be such a coward, because you're big and strong.  Hit one of  your own size.\"    \"I declare I will,\" cried Joe, bending down and seizing the boy by the  arm and waistband.    \"All right, do: it will be deliriously cool.\"    Joe Emson rose up and took hold of his big beard.    \"Don't leave me everything to do, Dyke, old boy,\" he said appealingly.  \"I wouldn't lose that great ostrich for any money.\"    Dyke muttered something about hating the old ostrich, but did not stir.    \"All right.  I'll go alone,\" said Joe; and he turned away and walked  swiftly back.    But before he had gone a dozen yards Dyke had sprung up and overtaken  him.    \"I'll come, Joe,\" he said; \"but that old cock does make me so wild.  I  know he understands, and he does it on purpose to tease me.  I wish  you'd shoot him.\"    \"Can't afford the luxury, little un,\" said Joe, clapping his brother on  the shoulder.  \"Let's make our pile first.\"    \"Then the goblin will live for ever,\" sighed the boy, \"for we shall  never make any piles.--Where is he?\"    Joe shaded his eyes and looked right across the barren veldt, where the  glare of the sun produced a hazy, shimmering effect.    \"There he is!\"    \"Don't see anything.\"    \"Yes, you can.  Your eyes are sharper than mine.  There, just to the  left of that rock.\"    \"What!--that one like a young kopje?\"    \"Yes, just to the left.\"    \"What!--that speck?  Oh! that can't be it.\"    \"Yes, it is; and if you had the glass, you could tell directly.\"    \"But it's so far, and oh dear, how hot it is!\"    \"It "]]]
