C. O. L. Riley, O.B.E., D.D., LL.D., V.D.,  Archbishop of Perth, Chaplain-General to the Forces._      I have been asked to write a short Foreword to the History of the 28th  Battalion. I do so with very great pleasure, for two reasons--Firstly,  because I have known Colonel Collett for many years, and, secondly,  because I approve of the History.    The present volume is the first of several that will attempt to record  the doings of those bodies of magnificent volunteers who went from  Western Australia and of whose achievements the country is so justly  proud. The Trustees of the Public Library, Museum, and Art Gallery of  Western Australia, as the custodians of the archives of the State, have  thought that those archives would be greatly lacking were a history of  our part in the World War not included. With that object in view, the  Commonwealth and State Governments have been approached and, largely  through the assistance of the Premier, the Hon. Sir James Mitchell,  K.C.M.G., and of the Minister for Education, the Hon. H. P. Colebatch,  M.L.C., a practical commencement is now made with the narrative which  concerns the 28th Battalion.    In the following pages we are not treated to long dissertations on  military tactics, nor to clear proofs of how the writer could have  concluded the war in half the time it really did take, if only the High  Command had carried out suggestions made by one who knew all about it.  You will find nothing like that in this book. Colonel Collett evidently  asked himself: \"What do the friends of the men of the Battalion want to  know?\" They want to know what the men did and what the Battalion did.  What was the daily life of the man in the training camp; on the  transports; in the war areas, and in the trenches. Of those who fell,  they want to know, if possible, how and when they fell and where they  were buried. Of those who were wounded, they want to know what they were  doing when they \"stopped a bullet,\" and how they were afterwards  treated in hospital or in \"Blighty.\" The public want a brief outline of  the great doings of the Battalion, and all these things are plainly and  proudly told by the writer.    I have often been in camp with Colonel Collett and know how thoroughly  he did his work there. I am sure that all the men of the Battalion,  their friends, and the public generally, will thank him for the loving  care and labour he has devoted to a task which must have been to him a  glorious record, and yet, at times, one full of sadness as he recalled  to mind the \"passing out\" of friend after friend.                                              C. O. L., PERTH,                                            Chaplain-General A.I.F.,                                            C. of E.          PREFACE.      In the pages which follow an attempt has been made to give some account  of how a Western Australian battalion was raised, organised, trained,  and lived. How and where it travelled, some of the things it did and  saw, and the nature of its environment. That is a large area to cover,  and I am only too conscious that the result achieved is far from  perfect.    This volume is confined to the period which terminated with the arrival  of the 28th Battalion at Marseilles. That first phase of the unit's  history was not so unimportant as might be thought. Although the  following years were marked by a series of great events, in which the  Battalion took a glorious part, yet there was a sameness in the  surroundings and a monotony of routine which was conspicuously absent  amongst the changing scenes and varied incidents of the earlier months  of service. In those beginnings was moulded the high character for which  the unit was ever afterwards esteemed. The trial by battle, hardship,  and disease had not found its members lacking, and a fine spirit of  comradeship had rapidly developed. With a high _morale_ it arrived on  the historic battlefields of Europe.    The few opinions offered in the course of the narrative are my own. They  have not been formed lightly. Any individual charged with the care and  direction of a body of his fellows must, of necessity--if he be worth  his salt--study causes and effects.    Certain names have been mentioned in the text. Doubtless there are  others equally worthy, but with the material I have had at my disposal  it has been impossible to do due justice to all. There does exist a  wealth of incident and anecdote which should be exploited but which, for  obvious reasons, has not been available to me, and although I have made  a general appeal to all ex-members to contribute to this record, a  "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/25428"],[0,"Anecdotes of Animals (#2)"],[1," to a barber in Rome, could imitate very perfectly  almost everything it heard. Some trumpets happened one day to be sounded  before the shop, and for a day or two afterward the magpie was quite  mute, and seemed sad and melancholy. All who knew it supposed that the  sound of the trumpets had so stunned it as to rob it at once of both  voice and hearing.    But this was not the case, as very soon appeared. The bird had all this  time been studying how to imitate the sound of the trumpets; and when at  last master of it, the magpie, to the astonishment of all its friends,  suddenly broke its long silence by a perfect imitation of the flourish  of trumpets it had heard; repeating with the greatest exactness all the  repetitions, stops, and changes. The learning of this lesson, however,  so exhausted the magpie's brain that it forgot everything it had known  before.    [Illustration]          IV    A GRATEFUL LIONESS      A dreadful famine raged at Buenos Ayres, yet the governor, afraid of  giving the Indians a habit of spilling Spanish blood, forbade the  people, on pain of death, to go into the fields in search of food, and  he placed soldiers at all outlets to the country, with orders to fire  upon those who should try to disobey him.    However, a woman, called Maldonata, was artful enough to get past the  watchful guards, and made her escape. After wandering about the country  for a long time, she came upon a cave into which she went. As soon as  she was inside, she saw therein a lioness, the sight of which frightened  her greatly. She was, however, soon quieted by the caresses of the  animal, who in return for a service done for her by the woman, showed  every sign of affection and friendliness. She never returned from  searching after her own daily food without laying a part of it at the  feet of Maldonata, until her cubs were large and strong enough to walk  abroad, then she took them out one day and never came back.    Some time after this Maldonata fell into the hands of the Spaniards, and  was brought back to Buenos Ayres on the charge of having left the city  contrary to orders. The governor, a man of cruelty, condemned the poor  woman to a death which none but the most-cruel tyrant could have thought  of. He ordered some soldiers to take her out into the country, and  leave her tied to a tree, either to die of hunger, or be torn to pieces  by the wild beasts. Two days later, he sent the same soldiers to see  what had happened to her. To their great surprise, they found her alive  and unhurt, though surrounded by lions and tigers, which a lioness at  her feet kept at some distance. As soon as the lioness saw the soldiers,  she fell back a little, so they were able to unbind Maldonata, who told  them the story of this lioness, whom she knew to be the same one she had  formerly helped in the cavern. When the soldiers were taking Maldonata  away, the lioness fawned upon her, as though unwilling to part from her.  The soldiers repeated the story to their commander, who could do no less  than pardon the woman who had been so wonderfully protected, or he would  have proven himself less humane than the lions themselves.    [Illustration]          V    A REMARKABLE NEWSMAN      One of the carriers of a large newspaper being ill, his son took his  place; but, not knowing the subscribers he was to supply, he took for  his guide a dog which had usually gone over the route with his father.  The animal trotted on ahead of the boy and stopped at every door where  the paper was to be left, without making a single mistake, or forgetting  anybody.    [Illustration]          VI    SHARP-WITTED BRUIN      The captain of a Greenland whaler being anxious to secure a bear,  without wounding the skin, made trial of the trick of laying a noose of  rope in the snow, and placing a piece of meat within it. A bear, roaming  over the ice nearby was soon attracted to the spot by the smell of the  dainty morsel. He saw the bait, crept up cautiously, and seized it in  his mouth; but his foot at the same time, by a jerk of the rope, became  entangled in the noose. He quietly pushed it off with his paw, and  walked slowly away. Having eaten the piece he had carried away with him,  he returned. The noose, with another piece of meat, having been  replaced, he pushed the rope aside, and again walked off with his  capture. A third time the noose was laid, but having seen how clever the  bear was, the sailors buried the rope beneath the snow, and laid the  bait in a deep hole dug in the centre. The bear once more came back, and  the sailors thought they were now sure of success. But bruin, much wiser  than they expected, after snuffing about the place for a few moments,  scraped the snow away with his paws, threw the rope aside once more, and  again escaped unhurt with his prize.    [Illustration]          VII    MAKING SURE      During the war between Augustus Caesar and Mark Antony, when all the  world stood wondering and uncertain as to which one Fortune would favor,  a poor man at Rome, in order to be prepared for making, in either event,  a bold move for his own advancement, hit upon the following clever plan.  He set himself to the training of two crows with such great care, that  at length he had taught them to pronounce with great distinctness, the  one a salutation to Caesar, and the other a salutation to Antony.    When Augustus returned the conqueror, the man went out to meet him with  the proper crow perched on his fist, and every now and then it kept  calling out, \"_Salve_, _Caesar_, _Victor Imperator!_\" \"Hail, Caesar,  Conqueror and Imperator!\" Augustus, greatly amused and delighted with so  novel a greeting, bought the gifted bird of the man for a sum which was  so large that it made him rich.    [Illustration]          VIII    THE BEAR AND THE CHILD      Leopold, Duke of Lorraine, had a bear called Marco, of whose sagacity we  have this remarkable story. One cold winter day, a boy, almost frozen  with the cold, entered Marco's hut, without thinking of the danger which  he ran in thus exposing himself to the mercy of the animal which was in  there. Marco, however, instead of doing the child any injury, took him  between his paws, and warmed him by pressing him to his breast until the  next morning, when he let him go. The boy came back to the hut in the  evening, and was received with the same affection. For several days he  had no other home, and it added not a little to his joy to see that the  bear always saved part of his food for him. A number of days passed in  this way without the servants knowing anything of what was going on. At  length, when one of them came one day, rather later than usual, to bring  the bear his supper, he was greatly surprised to see the huge animal  roll his eyes in a furious manner, and act as if he wished him to make  as little noise as possible, for fear of awaking the child whom he held  clasped to his breast. The animal, though very hungry, did not seem to  be the least moved by the sight of the food which was placed before him.  The story of this strange incident was soon spread at court, and reached  the ears of Leopold; who, with part of his courtiers, was anxious to  learn if the tale of Marco's generosity were true. Several of them spent  the night near his hut, and saw with astonishment that the bear never  stirred as long as his guest showed a desire to sleep. At dawn the child  awoke, was very much ashamed to find that he was discovered, and,  fearing that he would be punished, begged pardon. The bear, however,  caressed him, and tried to get him to eat what had been brought to him  the evening before. He did this at the request of the courtiers, who  conducted him to the prince. Having learned the whole story, Leopold  ordered the little boy to be taken care of, and he would, no doubt, have  soon made his fortune, had he not died a short time afterward.    [Illustration]          IX    A CLEVER CROW      A carrion crow, seeing on a lawn, a brood of fourteen chickens under the  care of a mother-hen, picked up one; but when a young lady opened a  window and gave the alarm, the robber dropped his prey. In the course of  the day, however, the thief returned, together with thirteen other  crows. Then each one seized a chick, and thus the whole brood was  carried off at once.    [Illustration]          X    THE POWER OF MUSIC      One Sunday evening, five singers were walking on the banks of a river.  After some time, being tired with walking, they sat down on the grass,  and began to sing. The field on which they sat was bounded on one side  by a wood, out of which, as they were singing, they noticed a hare pass  with great swiftness toward the place where they were sitting, and at  about twenty yards' distance from them, it stopped. It then seemed  greatly delighted with the music, often turning up the side of its head  so as to hear more easily. As soon as the singing was over, the hare  returned slowly toward the wood. When she had nearly reached the end of  the field, the singers began to sing the same piece again. The hare  stopped, turned round, and came swiftly back to about the same distance  as before, where she seemed to listen with great delight, till they had  finished, when she returned again by a slow pace up the field, and  entered the wood.    [Illustration]          XI    AN AMUSING MIMIC      A priest once brought up an ourang-outang, which became so fond of him  that, wherever he went, it always wanted to go with him. Whenever,  therefore, he had to perform the service of his church, he was obliged  to shut him up in his room. Once, however, the animal got out, and  followed the father to the church. Silently mounting the sounding board  above the pulpit, he lay perfectly still till the sermon commenced. He  then crept to the edge, and looking at the preacher, imitated all his  gestures in so amusing a manner that the congregation could not help  laughing. The"]]]
