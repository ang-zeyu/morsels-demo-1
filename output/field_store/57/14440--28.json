Presently even that ceased, and  Tommy lay relaxed and inert, sleepily watching the curtains blow in and  out at the open window. Thirty stories above the street the noises were  pleasantly muffled and remote, and his senses drifted aimlessly to and  fro on the tides of half-sleep.    Drowsily his mind wandered from the hotel's android servants ... to  the strictly utilitarian mechanical monstrosity at home, known  affectionately as \"Old John\" ... to the android showroom where they  had seen the one that Dad said looked like Mother....    He jolted suddenly, sickeningly awake. Suppose, his mind whispered  treacherously, suppose that Dad _had_ ordered one to take Mom's  place ... not on Mars, but _here_ while she returned to Mars with him.  Suppose that instead of Mom he discovered one of those _Things_ ... or  even worse, suppose he went on from day to day not even knowing....    It was a bad five minutes; he was wet with perspiration when he lay back  on his pillows, a shaky smile tugging at the corners of his mouth. He  had a secret defense against the Terror. He giggled a little at the  thought of what Aunt Bee would say if she knew.    And what had brought him back from the edge of hysteria was the  triumphant knowledge that with the abnormally acute hearing bred in the  thin atmosphere of Mars, no robot ever created could hide from him the  infinitesimal ticking of the electronic relays that gave it life. Secure  at last, his overstrung nerves relaxed and he slid gratefully over the  edge of sleep.    He woke abruptly, groping after some vaguely remembered sound. A soft  clicking of heels down the hall.... Of course, his mother back from the  Spaceport! Now she would be stopping at his door to see if he were  asleep. He lay silently; through his eyelashes he could see her outlined  in the soft light from the hall. She was coming in to see if he was  tucked in. In a moment he would jump up and startle her with a hug, as  she leaned over him. In a moment....    Screaming desperately, he was out of bed, backing heedlessly across the  room. He was still screaming as the low sill of the open window caught  him behind the knees and toppled him thirty stories to the street.    Alone in the silent room, Helen Benton stood dazed, staring blindly at  the empty window.    Tommy's parting gift from his father slid from her hand and lay on the  carpet, still ticking gently.    It was 9:23 on Mars.      The End          Transcriber's Note:        This etext was produced from _Imagination Stories of Science and      Fantasy_ July 1953.

The flowers are not mere comely  or curious vegetable creations, with colors, odors, petals,  stamens and innumerable technical attributes. The wonted insight  alike of scientist, philosopher, theologian, and dreamer is now  repudiated in the new revelation. Beauty is not 'its own excuse  for being,' nor was fragrance ever 'wasted on the desert air.'  The seer has at last heard and interpreted the voice in the  wilderness. The flower is no longer a simple passive victim in  the busy bee's sweet pillage, but rather a conscious being, with  hopes, aspirations and companionships. The insect is its  counterpart. Its fragrance is but a perfumed whisper of welcome,  its color is as the wooing blush and rosy lip, its portals are  decked for his coming, and its sweet hospitalities humored to his  tarrying; and as it speeds its parting affinity, rests content  that its life's consummation has been fulfilled.\" - William  Hamilton Gibson.      \"I often think, when working over my plants, of what Linnaeus  once said of the unfolding of a blossom: 'I saw God in His glory  passing near me, and bowed my head in worship.' The scientific  aspect of the same thought has been put into words by Tennyson:        'Flower in the crannied wall       I pluck you out of the crannies,       I hold you here, root and all in my hand       Little flower, - but if I could understand       What you are, root and all, and all in all,       I should know what God and man is.'    No deeper thought was ever uttered by poet. For in this world of  plants, which, with its magician, chlorophyll, conjuring with  sunbeams, is ceaselessly at work bringing life out of death, - in  this quiet vegetable world we may find the elementary principles  of all life in almost visible operation.\" - JOHN FISKE in  \"Through Nature to God.\"        FROM BLUE TO PURPLE FLOWERS    \"If blue is the favorite color of bees, and if bees have so much  to do with the origin of flowers, how is it that there are so few  blue ones? I believe the explanation to be that all blue flowers  have descended from ancestors in which the flowers were green;  or, to speak more precisely, in which the leaves surrounding the  stamens and pistil were green; and that they have passed through  stages of white or yellow, and generally red, before becoming  blue.\" - Sir John Lubbock in \"Ants, Bees, and Wasps.\"      VIRGINIA or COMMON DAY-FLOWER    (Commelina Virginica)  Spiderwort family    Flowers - Blue, 1 in. broad or less, irregular, grouped at end of  stem, and upheld by long leaf-like bracts. Calyx of 3 unequal  sepals; 3 petals, 1 inconspicuous, 2 showy, rounded. Perfect  stamens 3; the anther of 1 incurved stamen largest; 3  insignificant and sterile stamens; 1 pistil. Stem: Fleshy,  smooth, branched, mucilaginous. Leaves: Lance-shaped, 3 to 5 in.  long, sheathing the stem at base; upper leaves in a spathe-like  bract folding like a hood about flowers. Fruit: A 3-celled  capsule, seed in each cell.  Preferred Habitat - Moist, shady ground.  Flowering Season - June - September.  Distribution - Southern New York to Illinois and Michigan,  Nebraska, Texas, and through tropical America to Paraguay. -  Britton and Browne.    Delightful Linnaeus, who dearly loved his little joke, himself  confesses to have named the day-flowers after three brothers  Commelyn, Dutch botanists, because two of them - commemorated in  the two showy blue petals of the blossom - published their works;  the third, lacking application and ambition, amounted to nothing,  like the inconspicuous whitish third petal! Happily Kaspar  Commelyn died in 1731, before the joke was perpetrated in  \"Species Plantarum.\"    In the morning we find the day-flower open and alert-looking,  owing to the sharp, erect bracts that give it support; after  noon, or as soon as it has been fertilized by the female bees,  that are its chief benefactors while collecting its abundant  pollen, the lovely petals roll up, never to open again, and  quickly wilt into a wet, shapeless mass, which, if we touch it,  leaves a sticky blue fluid on our finger-tips.    The SLENDER DAY-FLOWER (C. erecta), the next of kin, a more  fragile-looking, smaller-flowered, and narrower-leafed species,  blooms from August to October, from Pennsylvania southward to  tropical America and westward to Texas.      SPIDERWORT; WIDOW'S or JOB'S TEARS    (Tradescantia Virginiana)  Spiderwort family    Flowers - Purplish blue, rarely white, showy, ephemeral, 1 to 2  in. broad; usually several flowers, but more drooping buds,  clustered and seated between long blade-like bracts at end of  stern. Calyx of 3 sepals, much longer than capsule. Corolla of 3  regular petals; 6 fertile stamens, bearded; anthers orange; 1  pistil. Stem: 8 in. to 3 ft. tall, fleshy, erect, mucilaginous,  leafy. Leaves: Opposite, long, blade-like, keeled, clasping, or  sheathing stem at base. Fruit: 3-celled capsule.  Preferred Habitat - Rich, moist woods, thickets, gardens.  Flowering Season - May-August.  Distribution - New York and Virginia westward to South Dakota and  Arkansas.    As so very many of our blue flowers are merely naturalized  immigrants from Europe, it is well to know we have sent to  England at least one native that was considered fit to adorn the  grounds of Hampton Court. John Tradescant, gardener to Charles I,  for whom the plant and its kin were named, had seeds sent him by  a relative in the Virginia colony; and before long the deep azure  blossoms with their golden anthers were seen in gardens on both  sides of the Atlantic - another one of the many instances where  the possibilities of our wild flowers under cultivation had to be  first pointed out to us by Europeans.    Like its relative the dayflower, the spiderwort opens for part of  a day only. In the morning it is wide awake and pert; early in  the afternoon its petals have begun to retreat within the calyx,  until presently they become \"dissolved in tears,\" like Job or the  traditional widow. What was flower only a few hours ago is now a  fluid jelly that trickles at the touch. Tomorrow fresh buds will  open, and a continuous succession of bloom may be relied upon for  a long season. Since its stigma is widely separated from the  anthers and surpasses them, it is probable the flower cannot  fertilize itself, but is wholly dependent on the female bees and  other insects that come to it for pollen. Note the hairs on the  stamens provided as footholds for the bees.    The plant is a cousin of the \"Wandering Jew\" (T. repens), so  commonly grown either in water or earth in American  sitting-rooms. In a shady lane within New York city limits, where  a few stems were thrown out one spring about five years ago, the  entire bank is now covered with the vine, that has rooted by its  hairy joints, and, in spite of frosts and blizzards, continues to  bear its true-blue flowers throughout the summer.      PICKEREL WEED    (Pontederia cordata)  Pickerel-weed family    Flowers - Bright purplish blue, including filaments, anthers, and  style; crowded in a dense spike; quickly fading; unpleasantly  odorous. Perianth tubular, 2-lipped, parted into 6 irregular  lobes, free from ovary; middle lobe of upper lip with 2 yellow  spots at base within. Stamens 6, placed at unequal distances on  tube, 3 opposite each lip. Pistil 1, the stigma minutely toothed.  Stem: Erect, stout, fleshy, to 4 ft. tall, not often over 2 ft.  above water line. Leaves: Several bract-like, sheathing stem at  base; leaf only, midway on flower-stalk, thick, polished,  triangular, or arrow-shaped, 4 to 8 in. long, 2 to 6 in. across  base.  Preferred Habitat - Shallow water of ponds and streams.  Flowering Season - June-October.  Distribution - Eastern half of United States and Canada.    Grace of habit and the bright beauty of its long blue spikes of  ragged flowers above rich, glossy leaves give a charm to this  vigorous wader. Backwoodsmen will tell you that pickerels lay  their eggs among the leaves; but so they do among the sedges,  arums, wild rice, and various aquatic plants, like many another  fish. Bees and flies, that congregate about the blossoms to feed,  may sometimes fly too low, and so give a plausible reason for the  pickerel's choice of haunt. Each blossom lasts but a single day;  the upper portion, withering, leaves the base of the perianth to  harden about the ovary and protect the solitary seed. But as the  gradually lengthened spike keeps up an uninterrupted succession  of bloom for months, more than ample provision is made for the  perpetuation of the race - a necessity to any plant that refuses  to thrive unless it stands in water. Ponds and streams have an  unpleasant habit of drying up in summer, and often the pickerel  weed looks as brown as a bulrush where it is stranded in the  baked mud in August. When seed falls on such ground, if indeed it  germinates at all, the young plant naturally withers away.    In the Bulletin of the Torrey Botanical Club, Mr. W. H. Leggett,  who made a careful study of the flower, tells that three forms  occur, not on the same, but on different plants, being even more  distinctly trimorphic than the purple Loosestrife. As these  flowers set no seed without insects' aid, the provisions made to  secure the greatest benefit from their visits are marvelous. Of  the three kinds of blossoms, one raises its stigma on a long  style reaching to the top of the flower; a second form lifts its  stigma only halfway up, and the third keeps its stigma in the  bottom of the tube. Now, there are two sets of stamens, three in  each set bearing pollen grains of different size and value.  Whenever the stigma is high, the two sets of stamens keep out of  its way by occupying the lowest and middle positions, or just  where the stigmas occur in the two other forms; or,"]]]
