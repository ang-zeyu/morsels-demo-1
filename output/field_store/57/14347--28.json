The  question now before us is what system we shall adopt for our women:  whether slavery and ignorance, or liberty and education.    Female suffrage is the consequence of the education of woman; it is  also the consequence of her liberty of conscience. The vote is the  expression of political faith, just as worship is the expression of  religious faith. There is no more reason for keeping woman from the  ballot box than there is for preventing her from going to church.    There is no reason why suffrage should be a privilege of sex,  considering that the duties of citizenship rest as heavily upon woman  as upon man. Is woman under less obligation to strive for the welfare  and future of her country because she is a woman? To attempt to curtail  the activity of woman in public life is tantamount to declaring that a  woman must not love her country and must not dedicate any of her time  to her duties of citizenship; that she must not feel the affection  and devotion which the idea of native land and community awaken in  every well-born creature.    Physical barrenness is combated and looked upon as a misfortune in  woman; but we condemn her to a perpetual political barrenness, to  patriotic barrenness, if we keep her away from exercising the right of  suffrage which affords the citizen the most effective means to make  his influence felt in social questions and in the improvement of the  public affairs. How are we to inculcate in our children, that sacred  pledge of the future of the nation, the cult and worship of native land  and liberty if we do not give their mothers that practical education  involved in the exercise of the right of suffrage; if they are taught  that government and politics are strange gods at whose shrines they  are forbidden to worship; if they feel upon themselves the stigma of  inferiority, of being incapacitated from speaking to their children  about the public affairs and the interests of the nation and the State?    All social classes are entitled to representation in the legislative  houses and are thus enabled to work for legislation favoring their  interests: the merchants, the laborers, the manufacturers, all can  choose one of their own number; but the women, who are not merely one  group or class, but a collection of groups or classes, who represent  one-half of the country and have interests of their own to defend,  not only with relation to their sex, but also with relation to their  position in the family, are not allowed to vote and are therefore  not permitted to have representatives to promote and defend laws  and measures necessary for their protection and betterment. Is this  just? Is this even moral? Female labor can be exploited in shop and  factory; feminine virtue can be made the object of commerce, and yet  woman is not allowed to defend directly the interests of her sex,  owing to one of those aberrations of the moral sense that spring from  the crass egoism and brutal tyranny of man.    If woman were at least exempt from complying with the laws! But no;  the law binds the woman as well as the man; the Penal Code menaces man  and woman alike with the sword of justice, and the burden of taxation  rests upon both the masculine and the feminine wealth. Consequently,  before the law, their duties are the same, but their rights are not.    Is it not strange that our laws should contain so much social injustice  towards woman, so much exasperating discrimination, all based upon the  theory of the servile dependency of woman upon man, resulting from her  congenital mental and physical inferiority? Moebius is incarnated in  our Codes, governs our policy, and influences all the customs  and  usages of our social and political life, to such a point that we  ought to be ashamed that in the midst of this era of vindication,  when all classes have secured their right to liberty and equality,  woman has been kept indefinitely upon the same level as in the  centuries of subjection and slavery.    True democracy can not exist with one-half of the people free and  the other half in a stage of slavery, with one-half of the people  with representation in the public affairs and the other half without  it. The people does not consist of men alone, but of women as well,  and conditions being equal, woman should have the same political  rights as man. She should, at least, have those fundamental rights the  exercise of which, like that of the right to vote, requires nothing  but intelligence and capacity, in order that she may have some voice  in the decision of her own destiny and may herself fight the battles  for her honor, her liberty, and other rights neglected or ignored by  man on account of the undisputed monopoly exercised by him over the  public affairs.    The injustices and social and juridical discriminations contained in  our codes will not be eliminated in a radical manner and the condition  of woman will not improve while man alone legislates and controls  all the spheres of public life, dictating to woman what she must do  and what she must not do; and woman will be incompetent to take care  of her own interests and shape her own life so long as she does not  look higher, so long as she consents to the superiority of man and  believes that her lot is simply that of serving and pleasing man  in bed and home, instead of being his true helpmate and companion,  for the progress and felicity of the human race.    All arguments that are or may be adduced against female suffrage  tend invariably towards these two objects: the confinement of woman  to the home and the perpetuation of her civil and political slavery.    Woman must busy herself with nothing but her household duties and  must live only for her husband and her children; she has her hands  full from the rising to the setting sun if she manages the cook,  cleans the house, and mends the clothes: this is the great argument  of the partisans of the old regime. Another is, that it is not in the  nature of things that woman should struggle with man in the battle  of public life; that if she enters that struggle, man will cease to  look upon her as a being to be worshipped, as a sacred idol at whose  feet he must kneel, and will see in her a rival to be combated and  overcome, for his own preservation, and woman will not only drag the  pure flower of her virtue into the mire of political life, but will  lose the esteem, respect, and consideration now tributed to her.    I have the most profound respect for all men and women who honestly  believe this to be the case. It is not their fault that they believe  that what has always been so is the best. They do not realize that  life is motion and that the new elements of life and character which  are being imperceptibly introduced into society demand changes and  innovations. Society can not become stagnant, otherwise it runs the  risk of becoming like stagnant water, which generates pestilential  miasma. The theory that woman exists for the home alone has been a  dead issue for some time past. Woman has quietly taken her place in  public life and aids and directs man, even though he may not notice  it and may not recognize her right to do so. In modern society, woman  participates in the direction of public charity and in the education of  the children, she practises law and medicine, engages in literary and  journalistic pursuits, occupies many public offices, and takes interest  and cooperates in the suppression of social vice and suffering.    Who does not admit that woman has duties towards her home and her  husband and children to which she must ordinarily give the preference  over all other duties? However, does this exclude the performance of  other duties towards God, her neighbor, and the State? Like man, woman  has many duties to perform, and the true merit lies in the orderly and  complete performance of these duties. Does not the Filipina dedicate  part of her time, sometimes a very considerable part, to the church  and to her so-called social duties, receiving and making calls and  attending celebrations, theaters, and balls?    Has anybody ever complained against this? Has woman ever been  criticised for her assiduous attendance of the religious services and  the public performance of her religious duties in crowded churches,  in the public streets, filled with tumultuous throngs of people,  marching in a procession behind some saint, jostled about and  exposed to disagreeable incidents, which she bears with resignation  because she suffers them for the cause of the public confession of  her faith? Our women go not only to church, but to the theater and to  popular entertainments and celebrations, where they may show off their  elegant dresses and satisfy their feminine curiosity. In all this we  see no pitfalls or dangers to their virtue, though we know that the  women who go to those places and exhibit themselves in this manner  are mothers, wives or daughters who have duties to attend at home.    Now, what is the difference if woman leaves her home to attend or take  part in a political meeting where the public needs or the election  of candidates for public office are discussed? In what way is the  virtue or purity of woman imperilled by her taking an interest in  public questions affecting the welfare of the families, considering  that whatever her status may be in life, woman always occupies some  position in the family? Why should we fear that woman will leave the  flower of her charms on the brambles of politics if she listens to  a political speaker, after having listened to sermons all her life,  or if she herself makes a speech giving her opinions on some subject  of interest to the family, on the necessity of remedying some social  evil or of providing a home for abandoned and indigent children?

But don't  keep it secret any more.\"    \"Is Grandy asleep?\"    Simone said hastily, \"Oh yes, she's taking a nap. She is old, you know,  and likes to take naps.\"    \"That's not a nap,\" Nina said, leaning over and patting the old woman's  cheek, \"I think she's having a bad dream.\"    Simone carried her grandmother into the house. If that old, tired heart  had jumped and floundered like her own, there must be some damage done  to it. If anything happened to her grandmother, the world would end,  Simone thought, and was furious with Nina, and at the same time, full of  joy for her.    Cecily Putnam opened her eyes widely, and Simone said, \"It does change,  you see. But it's in the family, after all.\"    The old woman sat upright quickly. \"That wicked child!\" she exclaimed.  \"To come and frighten us like that. She ought to be spanked.\" She got up  with great strength and rushed out to the garden.    \"Nina!\" she called imperiously. The child picked up one of the small  stones from the pie plate now full of spring water, and came to her  great-grandmother.    \"I'll make something for you, Grandy,\" she said seriously. She put the  stone in the palm of her hand, and breathed on it, and then held out her  hand and offered the diamond.    \"It's lovely. Thank you,\" the old woman said with dignity, and put her  hand on the child's head. \"Let's go for a walk and I'll show you how to  grow rose-apples. That's more becoming to a young lady.\"    \"You slept on the step.\"    \"Ah! I'm old and I like to take little naps,\" Cecily answered.    Simone saw them disappear among the applerose trees side by side. She  was still trembling, but gradually, as she passed her hand back and  forth, and the dust followed, moving in a sparkling river toward the  trash basket, Simone stopped trembling and began to smile with the  natural pride of a Putnam woman.
