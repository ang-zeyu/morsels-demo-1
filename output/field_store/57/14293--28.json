Would she be kind  enough to correspond with him? Life on the Bar N, ten miles from the  outposts of civilization, was lonely. He was two years out from the  east, and had not yet forgotten to be homesick at times.    Sidney liked the letter and answered it. Since then they had written  to each other regularly. There was nothing sentimental, hinted at or  implied, in the correspondence. Whatever the faults of Sidney's  romantic visions were, they did not tend to precocious flirtation. The  Plainfield boys, attracted by her beauty and repelled by her  indifference and aloofness, could have told that. She never expected  to meet John Lincoln, nor did she wish to do so. In the correspondence  itself she found her pleasure.    John Lincoln wrote breezy accounts of ranch life and adventures on the  far western plains, so alien and remote from snug, humdrum Plainfield  life that Sidney always had the sensation of crossing a gulf when she  opened a letter from the Bar N. As for Sidney's own letter, this is  the way it read as she wrote it:                                     \"The Evergreens,\" Plainfield.        Dear Mr. Lincoln:        The very best letter I can write in the half-hour before the      carriage will be at the door to take me to Mrs. Braddon's      dance shall be yours tonight. I am sitting here in the library      arrayed in my smartest, newest, whitest, silkiest gown, with a      string of pearls which Uncle James gave me today about my      throat--the dear, glistening, sheeny things! And I am looking      forward to the \"dances and delight\" of the evening with keen      anticipation.        You asked me in your last letter if I did not sometimes grow      weary of my endless round of dances and dinners and social      functions. No, no, never! I enjoy every one of them, every      minute of them. I love life and its bloom and brilliancy; I      love meeting new people; I love the ripple of music, the hum      of laughter and conversation. Every morning when I awaken the      new day seems to me to be a good fairy who will bring me some      beautiful gift of joy.        The gift she gave me today was my sunset gallop on my grey      mare Lady. The thrill of it is in my veins yet. I distanced      the others who rode with me and led the homeward canter alone,      rocking along a dark, gleaming road, shadowy with tall firs      and pines, whose balsam made all the air resinous around me.      Before me was a long valley filled with purple dusk, and      beyond it meadows of sunset and great lakes of saffron and      rose where a soul might lose itself in colour. On my right was      the harbour, silvered over with a rising moon. Oh, it was all      glorious--the clear air with its salt-sea tang, the aroma of      the pines, the laughter of my friends behind me, the spring      and rhythm of Lady's grey satin body beneath me! I wanted to      ride on so forever, straight into the heart of the sunset.        Then home and to dinner. We have a houseful of guests at      present--one of them an old statesman with a massive silver      head, and eyes that have looked into people's thoughts so long      that you have an uncanny feeling that they can see right      through your soul and read motives you dare not avow even to      yourself. I was terribly in awe of him at first, but when I      got acquainted with him I found him charming. He is not above      talking delightful nonsense even to a girl. I sat by him at      dinner, and he talked to me--not nonsense, either, this time.      He told me of his political contests and diplomatic battles;      he was wise and witty and whimsical. I felt as if I were      drinking some rare, stimulating mental wine. What a privilege      it is to meet such men and take a peep through their wise eyes      at the fascinating game of empire-building!        I met another clever man a few evenings ago. A lot of us went      for a sail on the harbour. Mrs. Braddon's house party came      too. We had three big white boats that skimmed down the      moonlit channel like great white sea birds. There was another      boat far across the harbour, and the people in it were      singing. The music drifted over the water to us, so sad and      sweet and beguiling that I could have cried for very pleasure.      One of Mrs. Braddon's guests said to me:        \"That is the soul of music with all its sense and earthliness      refined away.\"        I hadn't thought about him before--I hadn't even caught his      name in the general introduction. He was a tall, slight man,      with a worn, sensitive face and iron-grey hair--a quiet man      who hadn't laughed or talked. But he began to talk to me then,      and I forgot all about the others. I never had listened to      anybody in the least like him. He talked of books and music,      of art and travel. He had been all over the world, and had      seen everything everybody else had seen and everything they      hadn't too, I think. I seemed to be looking into an enchanted      mirror where all my own dreams and ideals were reflected back      to me, but made, oh, so much more beautiful!        On my way home after the Braddon people had left us somebody      asked me how I liked Paul Moore! The man I had been talking      with was Paul Moore, the great novelist! I was almost glad I      hadn't known it while he was talking to me--I should have been      too awed and reverential to have really enjoyed his      conversation. As it was, I had contradicted him twice, and he      had laughed and liked it. But his books will always have a new      meaning to me henceforth, through the insight he himself has      given me.        It is such meetings as these that give life its sparkle for      me. But much of its abiding sweetness comes from my friendship      with Margaret Raleigh. You will be weary of my rhapsodies over      her. But she is such a rare and wonderful woman; much older      then I am, but so young in heart and soul and freshness of      feeling! She is to me mother and sister and wise,      clear-sighted friend. To her I go with all my perplexities and      hopes and triumphs. She has sympathy and understanding for my      every mood. I love life so much for giving me such a      friendship!        This morning I wakened at dawn and stole away to the shore      before anyone else was up. I had a delightful run-away. The      long, low-lying meadows between \"The Evergreens\" and the shore      were dewy and fresh in that first light, that was as fine and      purely tinted as the heart of one of my white roses. On the      beach the water was purring in little blue ripples, and, oh,      the sunrise out there beyond the harbour! All the eastern      Heaven was abloom with it. And there was a wind that came      dancing and whistling up the channel to replace the beautiful      silence with a music more beautiful still.        The rest of the folks were just coming downstairs when I got      back to breakfast. They were all yawny, and some were grumpy,      but I had washed my being in the sunrise and felt as      blithesome as the day. Oh, life is so good to live!        Tomorrow Uncle James's new vessel, the _White Lady_, is to be      launched. We are going to make a festive occasion of it, and I      am to christen her with a bottle of cobwebby old wine.        But I hear the carriage, and Aunt Jane is calling me. I had a      great deal more to say--about your letter, your big \"round-up\"      and your tribulations with your Chinese cook--but I've only      time now to say goodbye. You wish me a lovely time at the      dance and a full programme, don't you?                                             Yours sincerely,                                              Sidney Richmond.    Aunt Jane came home presently and carried away her sleeping baby.  Sidney said her prayers, went to bed, and slept soundly and serenely.    She mailed her letter the next day, and a month later an answer came.  Sidney read it as soon as she left the post office, and walked the  rest of the way home as in a nightmare, staring straight ahead of her  with wide-open, unseeing brown eyes.    John Lincoln's letter was short, but the pertinent paragraph of it  burned itself into Sidney's brain. He wrote:        I am going east for a visit. It is six years since I was home,      and it seems like three times six. I shall go by the C.P.R.,      which passes through Plainfield, and I mean to stop off for a      day. You will let me call and see you, won't you? I shall have      to take your permission for granted, as I shall be gone before      a letter from you can reach the Bar N. I leave for the east in      five days, and shall look forward to our meeting with all      possible interest and pleasure.    Sidney did not sleep that night, but tossed restlessly about or cried  in her pillow. She was so pallid and hollow-eyed the next morning that  Aunt Jane noticed it, and asked her what the matter was.    \"Nothing,\" said Sidney sharply. Sidney had never spoken sharply to her  aunt before. The good woman shook her head. She was afraid the child  was \"taking something.\"    \"Don't do much today, Siddy,\" she said kindly. \"Just lie around and  take it easy till you get rested up. I'll fix you a dose of quinine.\"    Sidney refused to lie around and take it easy. She swallowed the  quinine meekly enough, but she worked fiercely all day, hunting out  superfluous tasks to do. That night she slept the sleep of exhaustion,  but her dreams were unenviable and the awakening was terrible.    Any day, any hour, might bring John Lincoln to Plainfield. What should  she do? Hide from him? Refuse to see him? But he would find out the  truth just the same; she would lose his friendships and respect just  as surely. Sidney trod the way of the transgressor, and found that its"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/24877"],[0,"Lucy Maud Montgomery Short Stories, 1907 to 1908 (#2)"],[1," \"If you knew how horrid I am,  really, you'd be glad and thankful for your escape. Oh, Jack, I wish  people never grew up.\"    Jack smiled sadly.    \"Don't feel badly over this, Kitty. It isn't your fault. Good night,  dear.\"    He turned my face up and kissed me squarely on the mouth. He had never  kissed me since the summer before he went away to college. Somehow it  didn't seem a bit the same as it used to; it was--nicer now.    After he went away I came upstairs and had a good, comfortable howl.  Then I buried the whole affair decently. I am not going to think of it  any more.    I shall always have the highest esteem for Jack, and I hope he will  soon find some nice girl who will make him happy. Mary Carter would  jump at him, I know. To be sure, she is as homely as she can be and  live. But, then, Jack is always telling me how little he cares for  beauty, so I have no doubt she will suit him admirably.    As for myself--well, I am ambitious. I don't suppose my ambition is a  very lofty one, but such as it is I mean to hunt it down. Come. Let me  put it down in black and white, once for all, and see how it looks:    I mean to marry the rich nephew of the Sinclairs.    There! It is out, and I feel better. How mercenary and awful it looks  written out in cold blood like that. I wouldn't have Jack or Aunt  Elizabeth--dear, unworldly old soul--see it for the world. But I  wouldn't mind Alicia.    Poor dear Jack!           *       *       *       *       *                                        Montreal, Dec. 16, 18--.    This is a nice way to keep a journal. But the days when I could write  regularly are gone by. That was when I was at Thrush Hill.    I am having a simply divine time. How in the world did I ever contrive  to live at Thrush Hill?    To be sure, I felt badly enough that day in October when I left it.  When the train left Valleyfield I just cried like a baby.    Alicia and Roger welcomed me very heartily, and after the first week  of homesickness--I shiver yet when I think of it--was over, I settled  down to my new life as if I had been born to it.    Alicia has a magnificent home and everything heart could wish  for--jewels, carriages, servants, opera boxes, and social position.  Roger is a model husband apparently. I must also admit that he is a  model brother-in-law.    I could feel Alicia looking me over critically the moment we met. I  trembled with suspense, but I was soon relieved.    \"Do you know, Katherine, I am glad to see that your photograph didn't  flatter you. Photographs so often do, I am positively surprised at the  way you have developed, my dear; you used to be such a scrawny little  brown thing. By the way, I hope there is nothing between you and Jack  Willoughby?\"    \"No, of course not,\" I answered hurriedly. I had intended to tell  Alicia all about Jack, but when it came to the point I couldn't.    \"I am glad of that,\" said Alicia, with a relieved air. \"Of course,  I've no doubt Jack is a good fellow enough. He was a nice boy. But he  would not be a suitable husband for you, Katherine.\"    I knew that very well. That was just why I had refused him. But it  made me wince to hear Alicia say it. I instantly froze up--Alicia says  dignity is becoming to me--and Jack's name has never been mentioned  between us since.    I made my bow to society at an \"At Home\" which Alicia gave for that  purpose. She drilled me well beforehand, and I think I acquitted  myself decently. Charlie Vankleek, whose verdict makes or mars every  debutante in his set, has approved of me. He called me a beauty, and  everybody now believes that I am one, and greets me accordingly.    I met Gus Sinclair at Mrs. Brompton's dinner. Alicia declares it was a  case of love at first sight. If so, I must confess that it was all on  one side.    Mr. Sinclair is undeniably ugly--even Alicia has to admit that--and  can't hold a candle to Jack in point of looks, for Jack, poor boy, was  handsome, if he were nothing else. But, as Alicia does not fail to  remind me, Mr. Sinclair's homeliness is well gilded.    Apart from his appearance, I really liked him very much. He is a  gentlemanly little fellow--his head reaches about to my  shoulder--cultured and travelled, and can talk splendidly, which Jack  never could.    He took me into dinner at Mrs. Brompton's, and was very attentive. You  may imagine how many angelic glances I received from the other  candidates for his favour.    Since then I have been having the gayest time imaginable. Dances,  dinners, luncheons, afternoon teas, \"functions\" to no end, and all  delightful.    Aunt Elizabeth writes to me, but I have never heard a word from Jack.  He seems to have forgotten my existence completely. No doubt he has  consoled himself with Mary Carter.    Well, that is all for the best, but I must say I did not think Jack  could have forgotten me so soon or so absolutely. Of course it does  not make the least difference to me.    The Sinclairs and the Bromptons and the Curries are to dine here  tonight. I can see myself reflected in the long mirror before me, and  I really think my appearance will satisfy even Gus Sinclair's critical  eye. I am pale, as usual, I never have any colour. That used to be one  of Jack's grievances. He likes pink and white milkmaidish girls. My  \"magnificent pallor\" didn't suit him at all.    But, what is more to the purpose, it suits Gus Sinclair. He admires  the statuesque style.           *       *       *       *       *                                        Montreal, Jan. 20, 18--.    Here it is a whole month since my last entry. I am sitting here decked  out in \"gloss of satin and glimmer of pearls\" for Mrs. Currie's dance.  These few minutes, after I emerge from the hands of my maid and before  the carriage is announced, are almost the only ones I ever have to  myself.    I am having a good time still. Somehow, though, it isn't as exciting  as it used to be. I'm afraid I'm very changeable. I believe I must be  homesick.    I'd love to get a glimpse of dear old Thrush Hill and Aunt Elizabeth,  and J--but, no! I will not write that.    Mr. Sinclair has not spoken yet, but there is no doubt that he soon  will. Of course, I shall accept him when he does, and I coolly told  Alicia so when she just as coolly asked me what I meant to do.    \"Certainly, I shall marry him,\" I said crossly, for the subject always  irritates me. \"Haven't I been laying myself out all winter to catch  him? That is the bold, naked truth, and ugly enough it is. My dearly  beloved sister, I mean to accept Mr. Sinclair, without any hesitation,  whenever I get the chance.\"    \"I give you credit for more sense than to dream of doing anything  else,\" said Alicia in relieved tones. \"Katherine, you are a very lucky  girl.\"    \"Because I am going to marry a rich man for his money?\" I said coldly.    Sometimes I get snippy with Alicia these days.    \"No,\" said my half-sister in an exasperated way. \"Why will you persist  in speaking in that way? You are very provoking. It is not likely I  would wish to see you throw yourself away on a poor man, and I'm sure  you must like Gus.\"    \"Oh, yes, I like him well enough,\" I said listlessly. \"To be sure, I  did think once, in my salad days, that liking wasn't quite all in an  affair of this kind. I was absurd enough to imagine that love had  something to do with it.\"    \"Don't talk so nonsensically,\" said Alicia sharply. \"Love! Well, of  course, you ought to love your husband, and you will. He loves you  enough, at all events.\"    \"Alicia,\" I said earnestly, looking her straight in the face and  speaking bluntly enough to have satisfied even Jack's love of  straightforwardness, \"you married for money and position, so people  say. Are you happy?\"    For the first time that I remembered, Alicia blushed. She was very  angry.    \"Yes, I did marry for money,\" she said sharply, \"and I don't regret  it. Thank heaven, I never was a fool.\"    \"Don't be vexed, Alicia,\" I entreated. \"I only asked because--well, it  is no matter.\"           *       *       *       *       *                                        Montreal, Jan. 25, 18--.    It is bedtime, but I am too excited and happy and miserable to sleep.  Jack has been here--dear old Jack! How glad I was to see him.    His coming was so unexpected. I was sitting alone in my room this  afternoon--I believe I was moping--when Bessie brought up his card. I  gave it one rapturous look and tore downstairs, passing Alicia in the  hall like a whirlwind, and burst into the drawing-room in a most  undignified way.    \"Jack!\" I cried, holding out both hands to him in welcome.    There he was, just the same old Jack, with his splendid big shoulders  and his lovely brown eyes. And his necktie was crooked, too; as soon  as I could get my hands free I put them up and straightened it out for  him. How nice and old-timey that was!    \"So you are glad to see me, Kitty?\" he said as he squeezed my hands in  his big strong paws.    \"'Deed and 'deed I am, Jack. I thought you had forgotten me  altogether. And I've been so homesick and so--so everything,\" I said  incoherently. \"And, oh, Jack, I've so many questions to ask I don't  know where to begin. Tell me all the Thrush Hill and Valleyfield news,  tell me everything that has happened since I left. How many people  have you killed off? And, oh, why didn't you come to see me before?\"    \"I didn't think I should be wanted, Kitty,\" Jack answered quietly.  \"You seemed to be so absorbed in your new life that old friends and  interests were crowded out.\"    \"So I was at first,\" I answered penitently. \"I was dazzled, you know.  The glare was too much for my Thrush Hill brown. But it's different  now. How did you happen to come, Jack?\"    \"I had to come to Montreal on business, and I thought it would be too  bad if I went back without coming to see what they had been doing in  Vanity Fair to my little playmate.\"    \"Well, what do you think they have been doing?\" I asked"]]]
