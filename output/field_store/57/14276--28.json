Maerchen, when she had got safely across,  looked around smilingly, and then slipped quickly through the gate.      FOOTNOTES:    [A] Maerchen represents the fairy or legendary tales, of which the  Germans were at one time so fond.    [B] The German \"Almanach\" corresponds in a measure with the English  \"Annual.\"          THE CARAVAN.      Once upon a time, there marched through the wilderness a large  Caravan. Upon the vast plain, where one sees nothing but sand and  heaven, were heard already, in the far distance, the little bells of  the camels, and the silver-toned ones of the horses; a thick cloud of  dust, which preceded them, announced their approach, and when a gale  of wind separated the clouds, glittering weapons and brilliant dresses  dazzled the eye. Such was the appearance of the Caravan to a man who  was riding up towards it in an oblique direction. He was mounted on a  fine Arabian courser, covered with a tiger-skin; silver bells were  suspended from the deep-red stripe work, and on the head of the horse  waved a plume of heron feathers. The rider was of majestic mien, and  his attire corresponded with the splendor of his horse: a white  turban, richly inwrought with gold, adorned his head, his habit and  wide pantaloons were of bright red, and a curved sword with a  magnificent handle hung by his side. He had arranged the turban far  down upon his forehead; this, together with the dark eyes which  gleamed forth from under his bushy brows, and the long beard which  hung down under his arched nose, gave him a wild, daring expression.  When the horseman had advanced fifty paces farther, the foremost line  of the Caravan was near, and putting spurs to his steed, in the  twinkling of an eye he was at the head of the procession. It was so  unusual a thing to see a solitary rider travelling through the desert,  that the guard, apprehending an attack, put their lances in rest.    \"What mean you?\" exclaimed the horseman, as he saw himself received in  so hostile a manner. \"Do you imagine that a single man would attack  your Caravan?\"    Ashamed of their precipitation, the guards lowered their lances, and  their leader rode forth to the stranger, and asked to know his  pleasure.    \"Who is the lord of this Caravan?\" inquired the cavalier.    \"It belongs to no single lord,\" answered the interrogated one; \"but  to several merchants, who march from Mecca to their native country,  and whom we escort through the desert; for oftentimes scoundrels of  every kind alarm those who travel here.\"    \"Then lead me to the merchants,\" responded the stranger.    \"That cannot be now,\" rejoined the other, \"for we must proceed without  delay, and the merchants are at least a quarter of a mile behind; if,  however, you would like to ride along with me until we halt to take  our siesta, I will execute your desire.\"    The stranger said nothing further; he drew forth a long pipe which he  had attached to his saddle, and began to smoke with slow puffs, as he  rode along by the leader of the van. The latter knew not what to make  of the stranger, and ventured not to ask his name in so many words;  but when he artfully endeavored to weave up a conversation, the  cavalier, to his remarks, \"You smoke there a good tobacco,\" or, \"Your  horse has a brave gait,\" constantly replied with only a brief \"Yes,  yes!\" At last they arrived at the place where they were to halt for  the siesta: the chief sent his people forward to keep a look-out,  while he remained with the stranger to receive the Caravan. First,  thirty camels passed by, heavily laden, guided by armed drivers. After  these, on fine horses, came the five merchants to whom the Caravan  belonged. They were, for the most part, men of advanced age, of grave  and serious aspect; one, however, seemed much younger, as well as more  gay and lively than the rest. A large number of camels and pack-horses  closed the procession.    Tents were pitched, and the camels and horses fastened around. In the  midst was a large pavilion of blue silk, to which the chief of the  escort conducted the stranger. When they reached the entrance, they  saw the five merchants seated on gold-embroidered cushions; black  slaves were carrying around to them food and drink. \"Whom bringest  thou hither to us?\" exclaimed the young merchant unto the leader:  before, however, the latter could reply, the stranger spoke.    \"I am called Selim Baruch, and am from Bagdad; I was taken captive by  a robber-horde on a ride to Mecca, but three days ago managed to free  myself from confinement. The mighty Prophet permitted me to hear, in  the far distance, the little bells of your Caravan, and so I came to  you. Allow me to ride in your company; you will grant your protection  to no unworthy person; and when we reach Bagdad, I will reward your  kindness richly, for I am the nephew of the Grand Vizier.\"    The oldest of the merchants took up the discourse: \"Selim Baruch,\"  said he, \"welcome to our protection! It affords us joy to be of  assistance to thee. But first of all, sit down, and eat and drink with  us.\"    Selim Baruch seated himself among the merchants, and ate and drank  with them. After the meal, the slaves removed the table, and brought  long pipes and Turkish sherbet. The merchants sat for some time in  silence, while they puffed out before them the bluish, smoke-clouds,  watching how they formed circle after circle, and at last were  dissipated in the ambient air. The young merchant finally broke the  silence. \"Here sit we for three days,\" said he, \"on horseback, and at  table, without doing any thing to while away the time. I feel this  tediousness much, for I am accustomed after dinner to see dancers, or  to hear singing and music. Know you nothing, my friends, that will  pass away the time for us?\"    The four elder merchants smoked away, and seemed to be seriously  reflecting, but the stranger spoke: \"If it be allowed me, I will make  a proposition to you. I think one of us, at this resting-place, could  relate something for the amusement of the rest: this, certainly, would  serve to pass the time.\"    \"Selim Baruch, thou hast well spoken,\" said Achmet, the oldest of the  merchants; \"let us accept the proposal.\"    \"I am rejoiced that it pleases you,\" answered Selim; \"and, in order  that you may see that I desire nothing unreasonable, I will myself  begin.\" The five merchants, overjoyed, drew nearer together, and  placed the stranger in their midst. The slaves replenished their cups,  filled the pipes of their masters afresh, and brought glowing coals  for a light. Selim cleared his voice with a hearty draught of sherbet,  smoothed back the long beard from his mouth, and said, \"Listen then to  THE HISTORY OF CALIPH STORK.\"          [Illustration]    THE HISTORY OF CALIPH STORK.    CHAPTER I.      Once upon a time, on a fine afternoon, the Caliph Chasid was seated on  his sofa in Bagdad: he had slept a little, (for it was a hot day,) and  now, after his nap, looked quite happy. He smoked a long pipe of  rosewood, sipped, now and then, a little coffee which a slave poured  out for him, and stroked his beard, well-satisfied, for the flavor  pleased him. In a word, it was evident that the Caliph was in a good  humor. At this season one could easily speak with him, for he was  always very mild and affable; on which account did his Grand-Vizier,  Mansor, seek him at this hour, every day.    On the afternoon in question he also came, but looked very serious,  quite contrary to his usual custom. The Caliph removed the pipe, a  moment, from his mouth, and said, \"Wherefore, Grand-Vizier, wearest  thou so thoughtful a visage?\"    The Grand-Vizier folded his arms crosswise over his breast, made  reverence to his lord, and answered: \"Sir, whether I wear a thoughtful  look, I know not, but there, below the palace, stands a trader who has  such fine goods, that it vexes me not to have abundant money.\"    The Caliph, who had often before this gladly indulged his Vizier, sent  down his black slave to bring up the merchant, and in a moment they  entered together. He was a short, fat man, of swarthy countenance and  tattered dress. He carried a chest in which were all kinds of  wares--pearls and rings, richly-wrought pistols, goblets, and combs.  The Caliph and his Vizier examined them all, and the former at length  purchased fine pistols for himself and Mansor, and a comb for the  Vizier's wife. When the pedler was about to close his chest, the  Caliph espied a little drawer, and inquired whether there were wares  in that also. The trader drew forth the drawer, and pointed out  therein a box of black powder, and a paper with strange characters,  which neither the Caliph nor Mansor could read.    \"I obtained these two articles, some time ago, from a merchant, who  found them in the street at Mecca,\" said the trader. \"I know not what  they contain. They are at your service for a moderate price; I can do  nothing with them.\" The Caliph, who gladly kept old manuscripts in his  library, though he could not read them, purchased writing and box, and  discharged the merchant. The Caliph, however, thought he would like to  know what the writing contained, and asked the Vizier if he knew any  one who could decipher it.    \"Most worthy lord and master,\" answered he, \"near the great Mosque  lives a man called 'Selim the Learned,' who understands all languages:  let him come, perhaps he is acquainted with these mysterious  characters.\"    The learned Selim was soon brought in. \"Selim,\" said the Caliph to  him, \"Selim, they say thou art very wise; look a moment at this  manuscript, and see if thou canst read it. If thou canst, thou shalt  receive from me a new festival-garmen"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/24598"],[0,"A Modern History, From the Time of Luther to the Fall of Napoleon (#2)"],[1,"the Puritans -- Character of the Puritans -- John Hampden --  Oliver Cromwell -- The King at Oxford -- Cromwell after the Battle of  Marston Moor -- Enthusiasm of the Independents -- Battle of Naseby --  Success of the Parliamentary Army -- Seizure of the King -- Triumph of  the Independents -- Cromwell invades Scotland -- Seizure of the King a  second Time -- Trial of the King.
