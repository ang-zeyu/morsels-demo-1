According to Firschein (1954:55),      _Syrrhophus smithi_ and _S. petrophilus_ have elongate lumbar      glands shaped like those in _Tomodactylus_. _Tomodactylus      saxatilis_ resembles _macrotympanum_, _smithi_ and      _petrophilus_ more than it does other species; all four      attain large maximal sizes, and have lumbar glands, mostly      smooth ventral surfaces, three palmar tubercles (sometimes      absent in _saxatilis_), and usually contrasting dorsal      patterns (reduced to flecks and spots in all species except      _saxatilis_). _Tomodactylus saxatilis_ differs from      _macrotympanum_ in having an extensive marbled dorsal pattern      and a small tympanum, and differs from _smithi_ and      _petrophilus_ in having a marbled dorsal pattern and the tips      of the outer two fingers widened and truncate. _Tomodactylus      saxatilis_ differs from all other named species of      _Syrrhophus_ in having conspicuous lumbar glands and in      lacking inguinal glands.    _Remarks._--The characteristics delimiting the genera _Tomodactylus_  and _Syrrhophus_ are not agreed upon by all workers (see discussions  by Firschein, 1954:50; Langebartel and Shannon, 1956:164; and Dixon,  1957:383). I have referred _saxatilis_ to the genus _Tomodactylus_ on  the basis of a lumbar gland, which was considered a distinguishing  character for the genus by Smith and Taylor (1948:46) and Langebartel  and Shannon (1956:165). Lumbar glands are longer than broad, at least  one third the distance from axilla to groin, lateral and usually high,  and often conspicuous and protuberant. The elevation or flatness of  the lumbar glands seems to be due to individual variation; living  specimens in the field had conspicuous and protuberant, or  non-elevated, indistinct lumbar glands. Lumbar glands are not to be  confused with inguinal glands, which are roundish, often yellowish,  sometimes diffuse, lateral but low, often inconspicuous, and usually  not protuberant. Inguinal glands occur in the genus _Microbatrachylus_  and in some species of _Eleutherodactylus_, and have been described as  flat, or low, or small, or indistinct for most species of  _Syrrhophus_.    For financial assistance with field work I am grateful to Rollin H.  Baker, and those individuals who administer the Michigan State  University Development Fund and the Bache Fund of the National Academy  of Sciences (Grant No. 463). I am grateful also to J. Keever Greer,  Donald F. Switzenberg, and Rudolph A. Scheibner for aid in the field,  to Edward H. Taylor, James R. Dixon, and William E. Duellman for  profitable discussions, and to Thomas Sweringen for figure 1. The  specific name alludes to the habitat (Latin, _saxatilis_ = found among  rocks).

I _seen_ 'em. Nice colored people wouldn't  'a gone there. They had respec' for theirselves an' their white folks.  But Dr. Bellamy came home soon with his fam'ly an' those colored people  got out. They wan't there long.    \"Endurin' of slavery I toted water for the fam'ly to drink. I remember  when there was springs under where the new Court House is now, and all  the white folks livin' 'round there drank water from those springs.  They called it Jacob Spring. There was also a spring on Market Street  between Second and Third Streets, that was called McCrayer (McCrary)  spring. They didn't 'low nobody but rich folks to get water from that  spring. Of co'se I got _mine_ there whenever I chose to tote it that  far. We did'n' work so hard in those days. I don't know nothin' about  field han's an' workmen on the river, but so far as I knows the  carpenters an' people like that started work at 8 o'clock A.M. and  stopped at 5 o'clock P.M. Of course 'round the house it was different.  Our folks done pretty much what the white folks did because we was all  pretty much one an' other.    \"Did I ever know of any slaves bein' whipped? I seen plenty of 'em  whipped over at the jail, but them was _bad_ niggers, (this with a  grimace of disgust, and shaking of the head), they needed whippin'. But  (with a chuckle) I sho' would have hated to see anybody put they han's  on one of my owner's people. We was all 'spectable an' did'n know  nothin' about whippen. Our mammy's spanked us aplenty, _yes mam_ they  did.    \"I remember when they didn't have no trussels 'cross either river, an'  they had a passages boat by the name of Walker Moore, an' the warf was  up there by the Charlotte railroad (S.A.L.) The Boat would take you  from there to the bluff an' then you would have to catch the train to  go to Greensboro, and other places in No'th Carolina.    \"I remember when the Fourth Street Fire Department bell was in front of  the City Hall. An' Mr. Maginny had his school right back of the City  Hall.    \"I believe we was all happy as slaves because we had the best of kere  (care). I don't believe none of us was sold off because I never heard  tell of it. I have always served nice folks an' never 'sociated with  any other kind. I brought up Mis ----'s chil'ren an' now she gives me a  life intrust in this place I lives in. I hav'nt never to say really  wanted for anything. I hav'nt never bothered with wimmen, an' had  nothin' to bother me.    \"I mus' tell you' bout Gov'ner Dudley's election, an' the free issue  niggers. They say Mr. Dudley told 'em if they'd vote for him he'd do  more for 'em than any man ever had. So they voted for him an' he was  elected. Then he ups an' calls a const'utional convention in Raleigh  an' had all the voting taken away from 'em. An' that the big thing he  done for em.\"[2]      FOOTNOTES:    [Footnote 1: Note: Have not been able to verify this memory, and think  perhaps the unusual uniforms of the Zoaves caused the small boy to  think they were women, or some adult may have amused themselves by  telling him so.]    [Footnote 2: Note: Governor Dudley was elected before Uncle Jackson was  born, but he enjoyed thoroughly telling this joke on the 'free issue  niggers'.]          N.C.

Uncle Ben, who is nearly blind and who walks with a stick, was assisted  to the porch by his wife who sat down near him in a protecting  attitude. He is much less striking than his wife who is small and  dainty with perfect features and snow white hair worn in two long  braids down her back. She wore enormous heart shaped earrings,  apparently of heavy gold; while Uncle Ben talked she occasionally  prompted him in a soft voice.    \"I wuz borned in Orange County and I belonged ter Mr. Gilbert Gregg  near Hillsboro. I doan know nothin' 'bout my mammy an' daddy, but I had  a brother Jim who wuz sold ter dress young missus fer her weddin'. De  tree am still standin' whar I set under an' watch 'em sell Jim. I set  dar an' I cry an' cry, 'specially when dey puts de chains on him an'  carries him off, an' I ain't neber felt so lonesome in my whole life. I  ain't neber hyar from Jim since an' I wonder now sometimes if'en he's  still livin'.    \"I knows dat de marster wuz good ter us an' he fed an' clothed us good.  We had our own gyarden an' we wuz gittin' long all right.    \"I seed a whole heap of Yankees when dey comed ter Hillsboro an' most  of 'em ain't got no respeck fer God, man, nor de debil. I can't 'member  so much 'bout 'em do' cause we lives in town an' we has a gyard.    \"De most dat I can tell yo' 'bout am de Ku Klux. I neber will fergit  when dey hung Cy Guy. Dey hung him fer a scandelous insult ter a white  'oman an' dey comed atter him a hundert strong.    \"Dey tries him dar in de woods, an' dey scratches Cy's arm ter git some  blood, an' wid dat blood dey writes dat he shall hang 'tween de heavens  an' de yearth till he am daid, daid, daid, an' dat any nigger what  takes down de body shall be hunged too.    \"Well sar, de nex' mornin' dar he hung, right ober de road an' de  sentence hangin' ober his haid. Nobody'ud bother wid dat body fer four  days an' dar hit hung, swingin' in de wind, but de fou'th day de  sheriff comes an' takes hit down.    \"Dar wuz Ed an' Cindy, who 'fore de war belonged ter Mr. Lynch an'  atter de war he told 'em ter move. He gives 'em a month an' dey ain't  gone, so de Ku Kluxes gits 'em.    \"Hit wuz on a cold night when dey comed an' drugged de niggers out'n  bed. Dey carried 'em down in de woods an' whup dem, den dey throws 'em  in de pond, dere bodies breakin' de ice. Ed come out an' come ter our  house, but Cindy ain't been seed since.    \"Sam Allen in Caswell County wuz tol' ter move an' atter a month de  hundret Ku Klux come a-totin' his casket an' dey tells him dat his time  has come an' if'en he want ter tell his wife good bye an' say his  prayers hurry up.    \"Dey set de coffin on two cheers an' Sam kisses his ole oman who am  a-cryin', den he kneels down side of his bed wid his haid on de piller  an' his arms throwed out front of him.    \"He sets dar fer a minute an' when he riz he had a long knife in his  hand. 'Fore he could be grabbed he done kill two of de Ku Kluxes wid de  knife, an' he done gone out'n de do'.
