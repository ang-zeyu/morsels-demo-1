Under these circumstances it was fortunate for the United States that  the American Peace Commissioners were broad-minded enough to appreciate  the situation and to act on their own responsibility. Benjamin Franklin,  although he was not the first to be appointed, was generally considered  to be the chief of the Commission by reason of his age, experience, and  reputation. Over seventy-five years old, he was more universally  known and admired than probably any man of his time. This many-sided  American--printer, almanac maker, writer, scientist, and philosopher--by  the variety of his abilities as well as by the charm of his manner  seemed to have found his real mission in the diplomatic field, where he  could serve his country and at the same time, with credit to himself,  preach his own doctrines.    When Franklin was sent to Europe at the outbreak of the Revolution,  it was as if destiny had intended him for that particular task. His  achievements had already attracted attention; in his fur cap and  eccentric dress \"he fulfilled admirably the Parisian ideal of the forest  philosopher\"; and with his facility in conversation, as well as by the  attractiveness of his personality, he won both young and old. But, with  his undoubted zeal for liberty and his unquestioned love of country,  Franklin never departed from the Quaker principles he affected and  always tried to avoid a fight. In these efforts, owing to his shrewdness  and his willingness to compromise, he was generally successful.    John Adams, being then the American representative at The Hague, was the  first Commissioner to be appointed. Indeed, when he was first named, in  1779, he was to be sole commissioner to negotiate peace; and it was the  influential French Minister to the United States who was responsible for  others being added to the commission. Adams was a sturdy New Englander  of British stock and of a distinctly English type--medium height, a  stout figure, and a ruddy face. No one questioned his honesty, his  straightforwardness, or his lack of tact. Being a man of strong mind,  of wide reading and even great learning, and having serene confidence in  the purity of his motives as well as in the soundness of his judgment,  Adams was little inclined to surrender his own views, and was ready  to carry out his ideas against every obstacle. By nature as well as by  training he seems to have been incapable of understanding the French; he  was suspicious of them and he disapproved of Franklin's popularity even  as he did of his personality.    Five Commissioners in all were named, but Thomas Jefferson and Henry  Laurens did not take part in the negotiations, so that the only other  active member was John Jay, then thirty-seven years old and already a  man of prominence in his own country. Of French Huguenot stock and type,  he was tall and slender, with somewhat of a scholar's stoop, and was  usually dressed in black. His manners were gentle and unassuming, but  his face, with its penetrating black eyes, its aquiline nose and pointed  chin, revealed a proud and sensitive disposition. He had been sent to  the court of Spain in 1780, and there he had learned enough to arouse  his suspicious, if nothing more, of Spain's designs as well as of the  French intention to support them.    In the spring of 1782 Adams felt obliged to remain at The Hague in order  to complete the negotiations already successfully begun for a commercial  treaty with the Netherlands. Franklin, thus the only Commissioner on the  ground in Paris, began informal negotiations alone but sent an urgent  call to Jay in Spain, who was convinced of the fruitlessness of his  mission there and promptly responded. Jay's experience in Spain and his  knowledge of Spanish hopes had led him to believe that the French were  not especially concerned about American interests but were in fact  willing to sacrifice them if necessary to placate Spain. He accordingly  insisted that the American Commissioners should disregard their  instructions and, without the knowledge of France, should deal directly  with Great Britain. In this contention he was supported by Adams when  he arrived, but it was hard to persuade Franklin to accept this point  of view, for he was unwilling to believe anything so unworthy of his  admiring and admired French. Nevertheless, with his cautious shrewdness,  he finally yielded so far as to agree to see what might come out of  direct negotiations.    The rest was relatively easy. Of course there were difficulties and such  sharp differences of opinion that, even after long negotiation, some  matters had to be compromised. Some problems, too, were found insoluble  and were finally left without a settlement. But such difficulties as  did exist were slight in comparison with the previous hopelessness of  reconciling American and Spanish ambitions, especially when the latter  were supported by France. On the one hand, the Americans were the  proteges of the French and were expected to give way before the claims  of their patron's friends to an extent which threatened to limit  seriously their growth and development. On the other hand, they were  the younger sons of England, uncivilized by their wilderness life,  ungrateful and rebellious, but still to be treated by England as  children of the blood. In the all-important question of extent of  territory, where Spain and France would have limited the United States  to the east of the Alleghany Mountains, Great Britain was persuaded  without great difficulty, having once conceded independence to the  United States, to yield the boundaries which she herself had formerly  claimed--from the Atlantic Ocean on the east to the Mississippi River  on the west, and from Canada on the north to the southern boundary  of Georgia. Unfortunately the northern line, through ignorance and  carelessness rather than through malice, was left uncertain at various  points and became the subject of almost continuous controversy until the  last bit of it was settled in 1911.*           * See Lord Bryce's Introduction (p. xxiv) to W. A. Dunning.       \"The British Empire and the United States\" (1914).      The fisheries of the North Atlantic, for which Newfoundland served as  the chief entrepot, had been one of the great assets of North America  from the time of its discovery. They had been one of the chief prizes  at stake in the struggle between the French and the British for the  possession of the continent, and they had been of so much value that  a British statute of 1775 which cut off the New England fisheries was  regarded, even after the \"intolerable acts\" of the previous year, as the  height of punishment for New England. Many Englishmen would have been  glad to see the Americans excluded from these fisheries, but John Adams,  when he arrived from The Hague, displayed an appreciation of New England  interests and the quality of his temper as well by flatly refusing to  agree to any treaty which did not allow full fishing privileges. The  British accordingly yielded and the Americans were granted fishing  rights as \"heretofore\" enjoyed. The right of navigation of the  Mississippi River, it was declared in the treaty, should \"forever  remain free and open\" to both parties; but here Great Britain was simply  passing on to the United States a formal right which she had received  from France and was retaining for herself a similar right which might  sometime prove of use, for as long as Spain held both banks at the mouth  of the Mississippi River, the right was of little practical value.    Two subjects involving the greatest difficulty of arrangement were  the compensation of the Loyalists and the settlement of commercial  indebtedness. The latter was really a question of the payment of British  creditors by American debtors, for there was little on the other side  of the balance sheet, and it seems as if the frugal Franklin would have  preferred to make no concessions and would have allowed creditors to  take their own chances of getting paid. But the matter appeared to  Adams in a different light--perhaps his New England conscience was  aroused--and in this point of view he was supported by Jay. It was  therefore finally agreed \"that creditors on either side shall meet  with no lawful impediment to the recovery of the full value in sterling  money, of all bona fide debts heretofore contracted.\" However just this  provision may have been, its incorporation in the terms of the treaty  was a mistake on the part of the Commissioners, because the Government  of the United States had no power to give effect to such an arrangement,  so that the provision had no more value than an emphatic expression of  opinion. Accordingly, when some of the States later disregarded this  part of the treaty, the British had an excuse for refusing to carry out  certain of their own obligations.    The historian of the Virginia Federal Convention of 1788, H. B. Grigsby,  relates an amusing incident growing out of the controversy over the  payment of debts to creditors in England:    \"A Scotchman, John Warden, a prominent lawyer and good classical  scholar, but suspected rightly of Tory leanings during the Revolution,  learning of the large minority against the repeal of laws in conflict  with the treaty of 1783 (i. e., especially the laws as to the collection  of debts by foreigners) caustically remarked that some of the members  of the House had voted against paying for the coats on their backs. The  story goes that he was summoned before the House in full session,  and was compelled to beg their pardon on his knees; but as he rose,  pretending to brush the dust from his knees, he pointed to the House and  said audibly, with evident double meaning, 'Upon my word, a dommed dirty  house it is indeed.'

The masseter probably arose from the quadratojugal, the jugal, and  ventral parts of the squamosal, although scars on the quadratojugal and  jugal are lacking. The squamosal bears an indistinct, gently curved  ridge, passing upward and forward from the posteroventral corner of the  bone and paralleling the articulation of the squamosal with the  parietal. This ridge presumably marks the upper limits of the origin of  the masseter from the squamosal.    [Illustration: FIG. 3. _Captorhinus._ Cross-section of right half of  skull immediately behind the pterygoid flange, showing masseter,  temporal, and anterior pterygoid muscles. Same specimen shown in Fig.  1. x 2.]    [Illustration: FIG. 4. _Captorhinus._ Internal aspect of left  mandibular fragment, showing insertion of posterior pterygoid muscle.  KU 8963, Richard's Spur, Oklahoma. x 2.8.]    The masseter inserted on the external surface of the coronoid process,  within two shallow concavities separated by an oblique ridge. The  concavities and ridge may indicate that the muscle was divided into two  sheets. If so, the anterior component was wedge-shaped in  cross-section, and its thin posterior edge overlapped the larger mass  that inserted on the posterior half of the coronoid process.    From a functional standpoint it is doubtful that a major component of  the adductors arose from the quadrate wing of the pterygoid, for when  the jaw is closed the Meckelian fossa is directly lateral to that bone.  If the jaw were at almost any angle but maximum depression, the  greatest component of force would be mediad, pulling the rami together  and not upward. The mediad component would increase as the jaw  approached full adduction. Neither is there anatomical evidence for an  adductor arising from the quadrate wing of the pterygoid. The bone is  smooth, hard, and without any marks that might be interpreted as muscle  scars.    The internal adductor or pterygoid musculature in _Captorhinus_  consisted of anterior and posterior components. The anterior pterygoid  arose from the lateral edge and the dorsal surface of the pterygoid  flange. The burred dorsal recurvature of the edge resembles that of the  flange of crocodiles, which serves as part of the origin of the  anterior pterygoid in those animals. In _Captorhinus_ the attachment of  the anterior pterygoid to the edge of the flange was probably  tendinous, judging from the extent of the development of the edge of  the flange. From the edge the origin extended medially across the  dorsal surface of the flange; the ridging of this surface is  indistinct, leading to the supposition that here the origin was more  likely to have been fleshy than tendinous.    The anterior pterygoid extended obliquely backward and downward from  its origin, passed medial to the temporal muscle and inserted on the  ventral and medial surfaces of the splenial and angular bones beneath  the Meckelian fossa. The spatial relationship between the palate and  quadrate-articular joint indicate that the muscle was probably a minor  adductor in _Captorhinus_.    When the jaw was adducted, the insertion of the anterior pterygoid was  in a plane nearly level with the origin. Contraction of the anterior  pterygoid when the jaw was in this position pulled the mandible forward  and did not adduct it. Maximum depression of the mandible produced  maximum disparity vertically between the levels of the origin and  insertion. The force exerted by the anterior pterygoid upon the  mandible when fully lowered most nearly approached the perpendicular to  the long axes of the mandibular rami, and the resultant force acting on  the mandible was adductive.    The adductive component of force therefore decreased as the jaw swung  upward, with the result that the anterior pterygoid could only have  been active in initiating adduction and not in sustaining it.    The evidence regarding the position and extent of the posterior  pterygoid is more veiled. On the medial surface of the mandible, the  prearticular and articular bones meet in a ridge that ventrally rims  the glenoid cavity (Fig. 4). The ridge extends anteriorly and curves  slightly in a dorsal direction and meets the Meckelian fossa. The  curved part of the ridge is made of the prearticular bone alone. A  small hollow above the ridge, anterior to the glenoid cavity, faces the  medial plane of the skull and is bordered by the articular bone behind  and above, and by the Meckelian fossa in front.    The surfaces of the hollow and the prearticular-articular ridge bear  tiny grooves and ridges that seem to be muscle scars. The entire area  of the hollow and its bordering features was probably the area of  insertion of the posterior pterygoid.    However, the area of insertion lies mostly ventral to the articulating  surface of the articular bone and extends but slightly in front of it.  Seemingly little lever effect could be exercised by an adductor  attaching in this position, namely, at the level of the fulcrum of the  mandibular ramus.    The posterior pterygoid muscle probably arose from the anterior portion  of the pterygoid wing of the quadrate, from a ridge on the ventromedial  surface. From the relationship of the muscle to the articulation of the  jaw with the skull, it may be deduced that the muscle was limited in  function to the stabilization of the quadrate-articular joint by  keeping the articular surfaces in close contact with each other and by  preventing lateral slipping.    Finally there is evidence for an adductor between the temporal and  masseter masses. The anterior dorsal lip of the Meckelian fossa  supports a small knob to which this muscle attached, much as in  _Sphenodon_ (Romer, 1956:18, Fig. 12). Presumably the muscle was  sheetlike and attached to the skull roof, medial to the attachment of  the masseter.    A pseudotemporal may have been present, but evidence to indicate its  extent and position is lacking. The muscle usually arises from the  epipterygoid and nearby areas of the braincase and skull roof and  inserts in the anterior parts of the fossa of the jaw. In _Captorhinus_  the lateral wing of the pterygoid cuts across the fossa, effectively  blocking it from the upper and medial parts of the skull, the areas of  origin for the pseudotemporal.      Dimetrodon    The morphology of the skull of _Dimetrodon_ closely resembles that of  the primitive _Haptodus_ (Haptodontinae, Sphenacodontidae), and \"hence  may be rather confidently described as that of the family as a whole\"  (Romer and Price, 1940:285). The major differences between the two  genera are in the increased specialization of the dentition, the  shortening of the lacrimal, and the development of long vertebral  spines in _Dimetrodon_. The absence of gross differences in the areas  of the skull associated with the groups of muscles with which this  study is concerned, implies a similarity in the patterns of musculature  between the two groups. Romer and Price suggest that _Haptodus_,  although too late in time to be an actual ancestor, shows \"all the  common features of the _Dimetrodon_ group on the one hand and the  therapsids on the other.\" The adductors of the jaw of _Dimetrodon_ were  probably little changed from those of the Haptodontinae and represent a  primitive condition within the suborder.    _Dimetrodon_ and _Captorhinus_ differ in the bones associated with the  adductor mechanism; the area behind the orbit in _Dimetrodon_ is  relatively shorter, reducing the comparative longitudinal extent of the  adductor chamber. Furthermore, the dermal roof above the adductor  chamber slopes gently downward from behind the orbit to its contact  with the occipital plate in _Dimetrodon_. Temporal fenestrae are, of  course, present in _Dimetrodon_.      _Musculature_    The adductor musculature of the lower jaw in _Dimetrodon_ was divided  into lateral and medial groups (Figs. 5, 6). The lateral division  consisted of temporal and masseter masses. The temporal arose from the  upper rim of the temporal opening, from the lateral wall of the skull  behind the postorbital strut, and from the dorsal roof of the skull.  The bones of origin included jugal, postorbital, postfrontal, parietal  and squamosal. This division may also have arisen from the fascia  covering the temporal opening (Romer and Price, 1940:53). The muscle  passed into the Meckelian fossa of the mandible and inserted on the  angular, surangular, prearticular, coronoid and dentary bones.  Insertion on the lips of the fossa also probably occurred.    The lateral division arose from the lower rim of the temporal opening  and from the bones beneath. Insertion was in the Meckelian fossa and  on the dorsal surface of the adjoining coronoid process.    [Illustration: FIG. 5. _Dimetrodon._ Internal aspect of skull, showing  masseter and temporal muscles. Skull modified from Romer and Price  (1940). Approx. x 1/4.]    The reconstruction of the progressively widening masseter as it  traveled to the mandible follows from the progressively widening  depression on the internal wall of the cheek against which the muscle  must have been appressed. The depressed surface included the posterior  wing of the jugal, the whole of the squamosal, and probably the  anteriormost parts of the quadratojugal. Expansion of the muscle  rostrally was prevented by the postorbital strut that protected the  orbit (Romer and Price, 1940:53).    The sphenacodonts possess the primitive rhynchocephalian kind of  palate. In _Sphenodon_ the anterior pterygoid muscle arises from the  dorsal surface of the pterygoid bone and from the adjacent bones. A  similar origin suggests itself for the corresponding muscle, the second  major adductor mass, in _Dimetrodon_.    From the origin the muscle passed posterodorsad and laterad of the  pterygoid flange."]]]
