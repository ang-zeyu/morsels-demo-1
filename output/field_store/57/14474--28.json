Hoyt, and John Wellman. Original No. WED       17327.         _Paratypes._--KU Nos. 58064-58073 collected with the holotype.         _Diagnosis._--A species of the _schmidtorum_-group of       _Ptychohyla_ differing from other known members of the group       in having the following combination of characters: diameter       of tympanum not noticeably less than half that of eye; white       spot below eye; white lateral stripe on body anteriorly;       dorsum bright green in life; thighs yellowish brown.         _Description of Holotype._--Adult male having snout-vent       length of 27.3 mm.; tibia length, 12.8 mm.; tibia       length/snout-vent length, 48.7 per cent; foot length       (measured from proximal edge of inner metatarsal tubercle to       tip of longest toe), 10.8 mm.; head length, 9.2 mm.; head       length/snout-vent length, 33.7 per cent; head width, 9.0       mm.; head width/snout-vent length, 30.9 per cent; diameter       of eye, 2.8 mm.; diameter of tympanum, 1.4 mm.;       tympanum/eye, 50.0 per cent. Snout in lateral profile nearly       square, slightly rounded above; in dorsal profile bluntly       squared; canthus pronounced; loreal region concave; lips       thick, rounded, and flaring; nostrils protuberant;       internarial distance, 2.3 mm.; top of head flat;       interorbital distance, 3.3 mm.; much broader than width of       eyelid, 2.4 mm. A thin dermal fold from posterior corner of       eye above tympanum to insertion of forelimb, covering upper       edge of tympanum; tympanum nearly round, its diameter equal       to its distance from eye. Forearm slender lacking distinct       fold on wrist; a row of low, rounded tubercles on       ventrolateral surface of forearm; pollex moderately enlarged       without nuptial spines; second and fourth fingers equal in       length; subarticular tubercles round, none bifid; discs       small, that of third finger noticeably smaller than       tympanum; no web between first and second fingers; vestige       of web between other fingers. Heels overlap when hind limbs       adpressed; tibiotarsal articulation reaches to middle of       eye; no tarsal fold; inner metatarsal tubercle large, flat,       and elliptical; outer metatarsal tubercle slightly more       distal than inner, small, and elliptical; subarticular       tubercles round; length of digits from shortest to longest       1-2-5-3-4; third and fifth toes webbed to base of disc;       fourth toe webbed to base of penultimate phalanx; discs       smaller on toes than on fingers. Anal opening directed       posteriorly at upper level of thighs; no anal flap; pair of       large tubercles below anal opening and a slightly smaller       pair farther below. Skin of dorsum and ventral surfaces of       forelimbs and shanks smooth; that of throat, belly, and       ventral surfaces of thighs granular. Ventrolateral glands       well developed, not reaching axilla or groin and broadly       separated midventrally. Skin of anterior part of chin       glandular. Tongue cordiform, shallowly notched behind and       only slightly free posteriorly; vomerine teeth 2-2, situated       on small triangular elevations between large, ovoid inner       nares; openings to vocal sac large, one situated along inner       posterior edge of each mandibular ramus.         Color (in alcohol) dark purplish brown on dorsal surfaces of       head, body, and shanks; thighs brown above and yellowish tan       posteriorly; white stripe extending from below eye above       forearm to mid-flank. Ventral surfaces creamy white;       ventrolateral glands orange-tan flecked with dark brown;       edge of lower lip with dark brown spots; narrow white line       on upper lip; palms white and soles brown.         Color (in life) uniform dark bright green above with creamy       white bar below eye; lateral stripe silvery white; ventral       surfaces deep yellow; posterior surfaces of thighs yellow       brown; iris reddish bronze.         _Variation._--Sixteen adult males are available; these have       snout-vent lengths of 26.3 to 28.5 mm. (average, 27.6 mm.).       The tympanum/eye ratio is 48.2 to 58.6 per cent (average,       53.2 per cent). The number of vomerine teeth varies from       four to six. The extent of the ventrolateral glands is       variable. In five specimens the glands nearly meet       midventrally; in two others the glands include the axillary       region; in none do the glands extend into the groin. In       other structural details there is no noticeable variation.         The greatest variation in color pattern is found in the       lateral stripe. The pale spot or bar below the eye is       present in all specimens; in one individual there is no       lateral stripe; in three the stripe extends posteriorly only       to above the forearm, in two to the mid-flank, and in the       others to the groin.         Although all of the males were bright uniform green above       when collected at night as they were calling, some changed       color later. In these individuals the dorsum became a       somewhat paler green with faint irregular yellowish tan       blotches.         The one available female (UMMZ 121399) has a snout-vent       length of 30.3 mm. and a tympanum/eye ratio of 52.8 per       cent, and is colored like the males. The tubercles by the       anal opening are placed irregularly and do not consist of       two pairs below the opening. There are no ventrolateral       glands, glandular area on the chin, or enlarged prepollex.         _Comparisons._--_Ptychohyla chamulae_ resembles _P.       schmidtorum_ in color pattern and body proportions, but the       ground color of _schmidtorum_ is chocolate brown and not       green as in _chamulae_. Also, in _schmidtorum_ the webbing       and posterior surfaces of the thighs are pale cream-color in       preserved specimens as contrasted with tan in _chamulae_. In       living _schmidtorum_ the iris is bright red, not reddish       bronze as in _chamulae_. The ventrolateral glands in       _schmidtorum_ more closely approximate one another       midventrally than in _chamulae_. It is conceivable that       these populations are subspecifically related; _schmidtorum_       occurs in the same kind of habitat as does _chamulae_, but       is known only from the Pacific slopes of southeastern       Chiapas and southwestern Guatemala, whereas _chamulae_ is       known only from the Atlantic slopes of the Mesa Central in       north-central Chiapas. Both of these species differ from       _Ptychohyla ignicolor_ in having a relatively larger       tympanum, more webbing on the foot, different arrangement of       anal tubercles, and different coloration.         _Description of Tadpole._--Six tadpoles having fully       developed mouth parts have body lengths of 5.5 to 11.9 mm.       and total lengths of 17.3 to 44.0 mm. The following       description is based on a tadpole (KU 58199) having small       hind limbs, a body length of 10.5 mm., and a total length of       39.0 mm. Body ovoid, only slightly flattened dorsally and       ventrally (Fig. 1); body only slightly deeper than wide;       eyes directed dorsolaterally and slightly protuberant;       nostrils small. Tail long and slender; greatest depth of       tail-musculature two-thirds greatest depth of tail-fin;       tail-musculature extending nearly to tip of tail-fin.         Mouth directed anteroventrally; thin fleshy lips greatly       expanded and forming large suckerlike disc; width of mouth       greater than width of snout and nearly as wide as body.       Outer edge of lips having small papillae; inner surface of       mouth smooth; scattered large papillae, seemingly in rows,       around teeth and beak (Fig. 2). Tooth rows 3/3; the upper       rows subequal in length; upper rows one and three       interrupted medially; lower rows one and two about equal in       length to upper rows; third lower row short. Upper beak       heavy and horn-covered.    [Illustration: FIG. 1. Tadpole of _Ptychohyla chamulae_  (KU 58199). x 2.5.]    [Illustration: FIG. 2. Mouthparts of tadpole of _Ptychohyla chamulae_  (KU 58199). x 16.]         Color (in alcohol) dark brown over entire body and       tail-musculature; a white area near base of tail, and a dark       streak on anterior one-fourth of tail; tail-fin transparent       having brown blotches.         _Remarks_.--Five metamorphosing tadpoles and juveniles (KU       58074, 58234-8) were found at night on vegetation by       streams. Of two completely metamorphosed young each has a       snout-vent length of 15.7 mm. Another having a snout-vent       length of 16.2 mm. has a tail stub 2 mm. long and a       completely metamorphosed mouth. Two others have snout-vent       lengths of 13.6 and 14.1 mm. and tail lengths of 11.5 and       8.1 mm. respectively; in these the mouth parts are       incompletely metamorphosed. The single female available       (UMMZ 121399) contains approximately 60 ovarian eggs, the       largest of which are about 2.5 mm. in diameter.         _Referred Specimens.--Chiapas_: 6.2 km. S of Rayon       Mescalapa, KU 58063-74, 58199 (1 tadpole), 58234-8; 5.6 km.       S of Rayon Mescalapa, KU 58062, 58200 (5 tadpoles); 11.4 mi.       N of Pueblo Nuevo Solistahuacan, UMMZ 121395-9. The       specimens listed last were collected along a stream between       Pueblo Nuevo Solistahuacan and Rayon Mescalapa, which,       according to Floyd L. Downs, is probably the same stream       listed above as 5.6 km. S of Rayon Mescalapa.    Acknowledgments    I take this opportunity to thank Dale L. Hoyt, Thomas E. Moore, and  John Wellman, who ably assisted in collecting and studying these frogs  in the field. I am indebted to Floyd L.

It was now argued by _Mr. Blair_ and _Mr. G.F. Curtis_       [Transcriber's Note: should be 'G.T. Curtis,' for George       Ticknor Curtis] for the plaintiff in error, and by _Mr.       Geyer_ and _Mr. Johnson_ for the defendant in error.         The reporter regrets that want of room will not allow him to       give the arguments of counsel; but he regrets it the less,       because the subject is thoroughly examined in the opinion of       the court, the opinions of the concurring judges, and the       opinions of the judges who dissented from the judgment of       the court.           *       *       *       *       *    Mr. Chief Justice TANEY delivered the opinion of the court.    This case has been twice argued. After the argument at the last term,  differences of opinion were found to exist among the members of the  court; and as the questions in controversy are of the highest  importance, and the court was at that time much pressed by the  ordinary business of the term, it was deemed advisable to continue the  case, and direct a reargument on some of the points, in order that we  might have an opportunity of giving to the whole subject a more  deliberate consideration. It has accordingly been again argued by  counsel, and considered by the court; and I now proceed to deliver its  opinion.    There are two leading questions presented by the record:    1. Had the Circuit Court of the United States jurisdiction to hear and  determine the case between these parties? And    2. If it had jurisdiction, is the judgment it has given erroneous or  not?    The plaintiff in error, who was also the plaintiff in the court below,  was, with his wife and children, held as slaves by the defendant, in  the State of Missouri; and he brought this action in the Circuit Court  of the United States for that district, to assert the title of himself  and his family to freedom.    The declaration is in the form usually adopted in that State to try  questions of this description, and contains the averment necessary to  give the court jurisdiction; that he and the defendant are citizens of  different States; that is, that he is a citizen of Missouri, and the  defendant a citizen of New York.    The defendant pleaded in abatement to the jurisdiction of the court,  that the plaintiff was not a citizen of the State of Missouri, as  alleged in his declaration, being a negro of African descent, whose  ancestors were of pure African blood, and who were brought into this  country and sold as slaves.    To this plea the plaintiff demurred, and the defendant joined in  demurrer. The court overruled the plea, and gave judgment that the  defendant should answer over. And he thereupon put in sundry pleas in  bar, upon which issues were joined; and at the trial the verdict and  judgment were in his favor. Whereupon the plaintiff brought this writ  of error.    Before we speak of the pleas in bar, it will be proper to dispose of  the questions which have arisen on the plea in abatement.    That plea denies the right of the plaintiff to sue in a court of the  United States, for the reasons therein stated.    If the question raised by it is legally before us, and the court  should be of opinion that the facts stated in it disqualify the  plaintiff from becoming a citizen, in the sense in which that word is  used in the Constitution of the United States, then the judgment of  the Circuit Court is erroneous, and must be reversed.    It is suggested, however, that this plea is not before us; and that as  the judgment in the court below on this plea was in favor of the  plaintiff, he does not seek to reverse it, or bring it before the  court for revision by his writ of error; and also that the defendant  waived this defence by pleading over, and thereby admitted the  jurisdiction of the court.    But, in making this objection, we think the peculiar and limited  jurisdiction of courts of the United States has not been adverted to.  This peculiar and limited jurisdiction has made it necessary, in these  courts, to adopt different rules and principles of pleading, so far as  jurisdiction is concerned, from those which regulate courts of common  law in England, and in the different States of the Union which have  adopted the common-law rules.    In these last-mentioned courts, where their character and rank are  analogous to that of a Circuit Court of the United States; in other  words, where they are what the law terms courts of general  jurisdiction; they are presumed to have jurisdiction, unless the  contrary appears. No averment in the pleadings of the plaintiff is  necessary, in order to give jurisdiction. If the defendant objects to  it, he must plead it specially, and unless the fact on which he relies  is found to be true by a jury, or admitted to be true by the  plaintiff, the jurisdiction cannot be disputed in an appellate court.    Now, it is not necessary to inquire whether in courts of that  description a party who pleads over in bar, when a plea to the  jurisdiction has been ruled against him, does or does not waive his  plea; nor whether upon a judgment in his favor on the pleas in bar,  and a writ of error brought by the plaintiff, the question upon the  plea in abatement would be open for revision in the appellate court.  Cases that may have been decided in such courts, or rules that may  have been laid down by common-law pleaders, can have no influence in  the decision in this court. Because, under the Constitution and laws  of the United States, the rules which govern the pleadings in its  courts, in questions of jurisdiction, stand on different principles  and are regulated by different laws.    This difference arises, as we have said, from the peculiar character  of the Government of the United States. For although it is sovereign  and supreme in its appropriate sphere of action, yet it does not  possess all the powers which usually belong to the sovereignty of a  nation. Certain specified powers, enumerated in the Constitution, have  been conferred upon it; and neither the legislative, executive, nor  judicial departments of the Government can lawfully exercise any  authority beyond the limits marked out by the Constitution. And in  regulating the judicial department, the cases in which the courts of  the United States shall have jurisdiction are particularly and  specifically enumerated and defined; and they are not authorized to  take cognizance of any case which does not come within the description  therein specified. Hence, when a plaintiff sues in a court of the  United States, it is necessary that he should show, in his pleading,  that the suit he brings is within the jurisdiction of the court, and  that he is entitled to sue there. And if he omits to do this, and  should, by any oversight of the Circuit Court, obtain a judgment in  his favor, the judgment would be reversed in the appellate court for  want of jurisdiction in the court below. The jurisdiction would not be  presumed, as in the case of a common-law English or State court,  unless the contrary appeared. But the record, when it comes before the  appellate court, must show, affirmatively, that the inferior court had  authority, under the Constitution, to hear and determine the case. And  if the plaintiff claims a right to sue in a Circuit Court of the  United States, under that provision of the Constitution which gives  jurisdiction in controversies between citizens of different States, he  must distinctly aver in his pleading that they are citizens of  different States; and he cannot maintain his suit without showing that  fact in the pleadings.    This point was decided in the case of Bingham _v._ Cabot, (in 3 Dall.,  382,) and ever since adhered to by the court. And in Jackson _v._  Ashton, (8 Pet., 148,) it was held that the objection to which it was  open could not be waived by the opposite party, because consent of  parties could not give jurisdiction.    It is needless to accumulate cases on this subject. Those already  referred to, and the cases of Capron _v._ Van Noorden, (in 2 Cr.,  126,) and Montalet _v._ Murray, (4 Cr., 46,) are sufficient to show  the rule of which we have spoken. The case of Capron _v._ Van Noorden  strikingly illustrates the difference between a common-law court and a  court of the United States.    If, however, the fact of citizenship is averred in the declaration,  and the defendant does not deny it, and put it in issue by plea in  abatement, he cannot offer evidence at the trial to disprove it, and  consequently cannot avail himself of the objection in the appellate  court, unless the defect should be apparent in some other part of the  record. For if there is no plea in abatement, and the want of  jurisdiction does not appear in any other part of the transcript  brought up by the writ of error, the undisputed averment of  citizenship in the declaration must be taken in this court to be true.  In this case, the citizenship is averred, but it is denied by the  defendant in the manner required by the rules of pleading; and the  fact upon which the denial is based is admitted by the demurrer. And,  if the plea and demurrer, and judgment of the court below upon it, are  before us upon this record, the question to be decided is, whether the  facts stated in the plea are sufficient to show that the plaintiff is  not entitled to sue as a citizen in a court of the United States.    We think they are before us. The plea in abatement and the judgment of  the court upon it, are a part of the judicial proceedings in the  Circuit Court, and are there recorded as such; and a writ of error  always brings up to the superior court the whole record of the  proceedings in the court below. And in the case of the United States  _v._ Smith, (11 Wheat., 172,) this court said, that the case being  brought up by writ of error, the whole record was under the  consideration of this court. And this being the case in the present  instance,"]]]
