Beat a whole egg and pass it over the paste with a brush all around the  little balls. Cover these with another sheet of paste, press down the  intervals between each ball, and then separate each section from the  other with a knife. Moisten the edges of each section with the finger  dipped in cold water, to make them stick together, and press them down  with the fingers or the prongs of a fork. Then put to boil in water  seasoned with salt or, better still, in broth. The ravioli are then to  be served hot seasoned with cheese and butter or with brown stock or  tomato sauce.      11    PAVESE SOUP    (Zuppa alla Pavese)    Cut as many thin slices of bread as are needed in order that each person  may have at least two of them. These slices are then to be toasted and  browned with butter. Poach two eggs for each person, one on each slice  of bread and place the slices on a large and deep dish (not in a soup  tureen). Pour hot broth in the plate, taking care not to break the eggs,  season with Parmesan or Swiss cheese, and serve.          PASTE    SPAGHETTI, MACARONI ETC.    (Pasta Asciutta)    The Italians serve the spaghetti or macaroni at the beginning of the  meal, in place of soup, and they give it the name of =Minestra Asciutta=  or \"dry\" soup. Besides the familiar spaghetti, the paste is served in  many other forms and with different seasoning. This is by far the most  popular Italian dish, and it seems to have pleased the taste of all the  peoples of the earth. The highly nutritive qualities of spaghetti and of  cheese, their indispensable condiment, have been recognized by all diet  authorities and, as for its palatableness, the lovers of spaghetti are  just as enthusiastic and numerous outside of Italy as within the  boundaries of that blessed country. The most popular seasoning for  spaghetti, are tomato sauce, brown stock and anchovy sauce. The  description of these three condiments follows:      12    TOMATO SAUCE    (Salsa di Pomidoro)    Chop together, fine, one quarter of an onion, a clove of garlic, a piece  of celery as long as your finger, a few bay leaves and just enough  parsley. Season with a little oil, salt and pepper, cut up seven or  eight tomatoes and put everything over the fire together. Stir it from  time to time and when you see the juice condensing into a thin custard  strain through a sieve, and it is ready for use.    When fresh tomatoes are not available the tomato paste may be used. This  is a concentrated paste made from tomatoes and spices which is to be  had, at all Italian grocers', now so numerous in all American cities.  Thinned with water, it is a much used ingredient in Italian recipes.  Catsup and concentrated tomato soup do not make satisfactory substitutes  as they are too sweet in flavor. Of course canned tomatoes seasoned with  salt and a bit of bay leaf, can always be used instead of fresh  tomatoes.    This sauce serves many purposes. It is good on boiled meat; excellent to  dress macaroni, spaghetti or other pastes which have been seasoned with  butter and cheese, or on boiled rice seasoned in the same way (see  Risotto). Mushrooms are a fine addition to it.    When using concentrated paste the following recipes will be found to  give good results:    Chop one onion, one carrot and a celery stalk: form a little bunch of  parsley and other aromatic greens and put everything to brown in a  saucepan together with a piece of butter. Add a reasonable portion of  tomato paste while cooking, stir and keep on a low fire until the sauce  assumes the necessary consistency.      13    BROWN STOCK    (Sugo di Carne)    Cover the bottom of a saucepan with thin slices of beef taken from a  juicy cut and small pieces of salt pork. Place over a large onion, one  carrot, and a stalk of celery, all chopped in small pieces. Add some  butter and cover the whole with any trimmings from steaks or roasts and  any bit of left over cooked meat. Season with salt and cloves. Put over  the fire without stirring. When you smell the onions getting very brown,  turn the meat and when everything is quite brown add a cup of water,  renewing the latter three times. Finally add a certain quantity of  boiling water or, better still, of broth, and let it boil gently five or  six hours. Strain, cool and skim off the fat which will form a cake on  top of the liquid.    The meat can be used afterward for meat balls or =Croquettes=. The stock  may be kept for some days and forms the basis for many dishes.      14    ANCHOVY SAUCE    (Salsa d'Acciughe)    This recipe does not call for the filets of anchovies prepared for =hors  d'oeuvre=, but the less expensive and larger whole anchovies in salt to  be had in bulk or cans at large dealers. Wash them thoroughly in plenty  of water. Remove head, tail, backbone and skin and they are ready for  use.    Put five or six anchovies into a colander and dip quickly into boiling  water to loosen the skins, remove the salt, skin and bone them. Chop  them and put over the fire in a saucepan with a generous quantity of oil  and some pepper. Do not let them boil, but when they are hot add two  tablespoons of butter and three or four tablespoons of concentrated  tomato juice made by cooking down canned tomatoes and rubbing through a  sieve. When this sauce is used to season spaghetti, these must be boiled  in water that is only slightly salted and care must be taken not to let  them become too soft. The quantities above mentioned ought to be  sufficient for about one pound of spaghetti.      15    SPAGHETTI OR MACARONI WITH BUTTER AND CHEESE    (Pasta al burro e formaggio)    This is the simplest form in which the spaghetti may be served, and it  is generally reserved for the thickest paste. The spaghetti are to be  boiled until tender in salted water, taking care to remove them when  tender, and not cooked until they lose form. They should not be put into  the water until this is at a boiling point.    Take as much macaroni as will half fill the dish in which it is to be  served. Break into pieces two and a half to three inches long if you so  desire. The Italians leave them unbroken, but their skill in turning  them around the fork and eating them =is not the privilege of  everybody=. Put the macaroni into salted boiling water, and boil twelve  to fifteen minutes, or until the macaroni is perfectly soft. Stir  frequently to prevent the macaroni from adhering to the bottom. Turn it  into a colander to drain; then put it into a pudding-dish with a  generous quantity of butter and grated cheese. If more cheese is liked,  it can be brought to the table so that the guests can help themselves to  it.    The macaroni called \"Mezzani\" which is a name designating size, not  quality, is the preferable kind for macaroni dishes made with butter and  cheese.      16    MACARONI WITH SAUCE    (Maccheroni al sugo)    The most appreciated kind of macaroni are those seasoned with tomato  sauce or with brown stock (see nos. 12 and 13). The macaroni are boiled  as above, then drained in a colander, returned to the saucepan and mixed  with the sauce and grated cheese. For those who like it some butter may  be added in the mixing.      17    MACARONI WITH ANCHOVY SAUCE    (Maccheroni con salsa d'acciughe)    After the paste is drained thoroughly it is to be put into the hot dish  in which it is to be served and the anchovy sauce poured over it and  well mixed with two silver forks until the sauce has gone all through  it. Some olive oil may be added, but grated cheese is not generally used  with the anchovy sauce.      18    MACARONI A LA CORINNA    (Maccheroni alla Corinna)    Put on the fire a pot with two quarts of salted water to which add a  small piece of butter. When it begins to boil put in it 3/4 lb.  macaroni. Let it boil for five minutes, then drain them in a colander.  Put them again in new boiling water, prepared as above and let them cook  on a slow fire. Drain them again. Cover the bottom of a plate with  macaroni and cover this first layer with grated cheese and with some  vegetables in macedoine, that is, chopped fine and fried brown with  butter. Repeat the draining, moisten the macaroni with the water in  which they have previously cooked and keep on a low fire for ten minutes  more.    The =Macedoine= of vegetables can be made with a dozen Bruxelles sprouts  or one cabbage, half a dozen big asparagus cut in little pieces, a  carrot cut in thin slices, a dozen small onions, some turnips and half a  dozen mushrooms. The mushrooms and the asparagus can be omitted. Melt  some butter in a saucepan and when the turnips, the carrots and the  onions are half cooked, add the cabbage or sprouts. Put in some water  and some more butter, boil for ten minutes and then add the mushrooms  and the asparagus, adding salt and pepper, and a little sugar if this is  desired.      19    MACARONI \"AU GRATIN\"    (Maccheroni al gratin)    Boil the macaroni in salted water until tender and drain them. Butter  slightly a fireproof casserole and lay on the bottom some grated cheese  and grated bread. Alternate the layers of cheese with macaroni and on  the top layer of macaroni put more cheese and bread grated. Over the  whole pour some melted butter, cover the casserole, (or =pyrex= plate)  and put it in the oven with a low fire. Keep for ten minutes or more,  until the top appears browned.      20    MACARONI NAPOLITAINE    (Maccheroni alla Napoletana)    Grind 1/4 lb. salt pork or bacon and fry it out in a saucepan. While it  is frying put one small onion through the grinder. As soon as the pork  begins to brown add the onion, the parsley chopped, a clove (or small  section) of garlic shredded fine, and a few dried mushrooms which have  been softened by soaking in warm water. When the vegetables are very  brown (great care must be taken not to burn"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/24409"],[0,"Our Common Insects (#2)"],[1,"this most ordinary action of  life, would require a volume. The process is scarcely less complex in  insects. Lyonnet found 3,993 muscles in a caterpillar, and while a large  proportion belong to the internal organs, over a thousand assist in  locomotion. Hence the muscular power of insects is enormous. A flea will  leap two hundred times its own height, and certain large, solid beetles  will move enormous weights as compared to the bulk of their bodies.    [Illustration: 8. Larva of a beetle (Photuris).]    In walking, as seen in the accompanying figure (Fig. 8), three legs are  thrown forward at a time, two on one side and one on the other.    Flies and many other insects can walk upside down, or on glass, as  easily as on a level surface. A fly's foot, as in most other insects,  consists of five joints (tarsal joints), to the last one of which is  appended a pair of stout claws, beneath which is a flat, soft, fleshy  cushion or pad, split into two (sometimes three) flaps, beset on the  under surface with fine hairs. A part of these hairs are swollen at the  end, which is covered with \"an elastic membranous expansion, capable of  close contact with a highly polished surface, from which a minute  quantity of a clear, transparent fluid is emitted when the fly is  actively moving.\" (T. West.) These hairs are hence called holding, or  tenent, hairs. With the aid of these, but mainly, as Mr. West insists,  by the pressure of the atmosphere, a fly is enabled to adhere to  perfectly smooth surfaces. His studies show the following curious facts.  \"That atmospheric pressure, if the area of the flaps be alone  considered, is equal to just one-half the weight of a fly. If the area  covered by the tenent hairs be added, an increase of pressure is gained,  equal to about one-fourth the weight of a fly. This leaves one-fourth to  be accounted for by slight viscidity of the fluid, by the action I have  so often alluded to, which may be called 'grasping,' by molecular  attraction, and, doubtless, by other agents still more subtle, with  which we have at present scarcely any acquaintance.\"    _How Insects Fly._ Who of us, as remarked by an eminent ornithologist,  can even now explain the long sustained, peculiar flight of the hawk, or  turkey buzzard, as it sails in the air without changing the position of  its wings? and, we would add, the somewhat similar flight of a  butterfly? It is the poetry of motion, and a marvellous exhibition of  grace and ease, combined with a wonderful underlying strength and  lightness of the parts concerned in flight.    Before we give a partial account of the results obtained by the delicate  experiments of Professor Marey on the flight of birds and insects, our  readers should be reminded of the great differences between an insect  and a bird, remembering that the former, is, in brief, a chitinous sac,  so to speak, or rather a series of three such spherical or elliptical  sacs (the head, thorax and abdomen); the outer walls of the body forming  a solid but light crust, to which are attached broad, membranous wings,  the wing being a sort of membranous bag stretched over a framework of  hollow tubes (the tracheae), so disposed as to give the greatest  lightness and strength to the wing. The wings are moved by powerful  muscles of flight, filling up the cavity of the thorax, just as the  muscles are the largest about the thorax of a bird. Moreover in the  bodies of insects that fly (such as the bee, cockchafer, and dragon  fly), as distinguished from those that creep exclusively, the air tubes  (tracheae) which ramify into every part of the body, are dilated here and  there, especially in the base of the abdomen, into large sacs, which are  filled with air when the insect is about to take flight, so that the  specific gravity of the body is greatly diminished. Indeed, these air  sacs, dilatable at will by the insect, may be compared to the swimming  bladder of fishes, which enables them to rise and fall at will to  different levels in the sea, thus effecting an immense saving of the  labor of swimming. In the birds, as every body knows who has eaten a  chicken, or attended the dissection of a Thanksgiving turkey, the soft  parts are external, attached to the bony framework comprising the  skeleton, the wing bones being directly connected with the central back  bone; so that while these two sorts of animated flying machines are so  different in structure, they yet act in much the same manner when on the  wing. The difference between them is clearly stated by Marey, some of  whose conclusions we now give almost word for word.    The flight of butterflies and moths differs from that of birds in the  almost vertical direction of the stroke of their wings, and in their  faculty of sailing in the air without making any movements; though  sometimes in the course they pursue they seem to resemble birds in their  flight.    The flight of insects and birds moreover differs in the form of the  trajectory in space; in the inclination of the plane in which the wings  beat; in the role of each of the two alternating (and in an inverse  sense) movements that the wings execute; as also in the facility with  which the air is decomposed during these different movements. As the  wings of a fly are adorned with a brilliant array of colors, we can  follow the trajectory or figure that each wing writes in the air. It is  of the form of a figure of eight (Fig. 9), first discovered by Professor  J. Bell Pettigrew of Edinburgh.    [Illustration: 9. Figure cut by an insect's wing.]    [Illustration: 10. Figure cut by a bird's wing.]    By an ingenious machine, specially devised for the purpose, Professor  Marey found that a bird's wing moves in an ellipse, with a pointed  summit (Fig. 10). The insect beats the air in a distinctly horizontal  plane, but the bird in a vertical plane. The wing of an insect is  impervious to the air; while the bird's wing resists the air only on  its under side. Hence, there are two sorts of effects; in the insect  the up and down strokes are active; in the bird, the lowering of the  wing is the only active period, though the return stroke seems to  sustain the bird, the air acting on the wing. The bird's body is  horizontal when the wing gives a downward stroke; but when the beat is  upward, the bird is placed in an inclined plane like a winged  projectile, and mounts up on the air by means of the inclined surfaces  that it passively offers to the resistance of this fluid.    [Illustration: 11. Trajectory of an insect's wing.]    [Illustration: 12. Trajectory of a bird's wing.]    In an insect, an energetic movement is equally necessary to strike the  air at both beats up and down. In the bird, on the contrary, one active  beat only is necessary, the down beat. It creates at that time all the  motive force that will be dispensed during the entire revolution of the  wing. This difference is due to the difference in form of the wing. The  difference between the two forms of flight is shown by an inspection of  the two accompanying figures (11, 12). An insect's wing is small at the  base and broad at the end. This breadth would be useless near the body,  because at this point the wing does not move swiftly enough to strike  the air effectively. The type of the insectean wing is designed, then,  simply to strike the air. But in the bird the wing plays also a passive  role, _i. e._, it receives the pressure of the air on its under side  when the bird is projected rapidly onward by its acquired swiftness. In  these conditions the whole animal is carried onward in space; all the  points of its wing have the same velocity. The neighboring regions of  the body are useful to press upon the air, which acts as on a paper  kite. The base of the wing also, in the bird, is broad, and provided  with feathers, which form a broad surface, on which the air presses with  a force and method very efficacious in supporting the bird. Fig. 12  gives an idea of this disposition of the wing at the active and passive  time in a bird.    The inner half of the wing is the passive part of the organ, while the  external half, that which strikes the air, is the active part. A fly's  wing makes 330 revolutions in a second, executing consequently 660  simple oscillations; it ought at each time to impress a lateral  deviation of the body of the insect, and destroy the velocity that the  preceding oscillation has given it in a contrary direction. So that by  this hypothesis the insect in its flight only utilizes fifty to one  hundred parts (or one-half) of the resistance that the air furnishes it.    [Illustration: 13. A bird on the wing.]    In the bird (Fig. 13), at the time of lowering the wings, the oblique  plane which strikes the air, in decomposing the resistance, produces a  vertical component which resists the weight of the body, and a  horizontal component which imparts swiftness. The horizontal component  is not lost, but is utilized during the rise of the wing, as in a paper  kite when held in the air against the wind. Thus the bird utilizes  seventy-five out of one hundred parts of the resistance that the air  furnishes. The style of flight of birds is, therefore, theoretically  superior to that of insects. As to the division of the muscular force  between the resistance of the air and the mass of the body of the bird,  we should compare the exertion made in walking on sand, for example, as  compared with walking on marble. This is easy to measure. When a fish  strikes the water with its tail to propel itself forward, it performs a  double task; one part consists in pushing backwards a certain mass of  water with a certain swiftness, and the other in pushing on the body in  spite of the resistance of the surrounding fluid. This last portion of  the task only is utilized. It would be greater if the tail of the fish  encountered a solid object. Almost all the propelling agencies employed  in navigation undergo "]]]
