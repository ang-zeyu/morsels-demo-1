[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/31469"],[0,"The Shunned House (#2)"],[1,"glimpsed a kind of thin,  yellowish, shimmering exhalation rising from the nitrous pattern toward  the yawning fireplace, I spoke to my uncle about the matter. He smiled  at this odd conceit, but it seemed that his smile was tinged with  reminiscence. Later I heard that a similar notion entered into some of  the wild ancient tales of the common folk--a notion likewise alluding to  ghoulish, wolfish shapes taken by smoke from the great chimney, and  queer contours assumed by certain of the sinuous tree-roots that thrust  their way into the cellar through the loose foundation-stones.      2    Not till my adult years did my uncle set before me the notes and data  which he had collected concerning the shunned house. Doctor Whipple was  a sane, conservative physician of the old school, and for all his  interest in the place was not eager to encourage young thoughts toward  the abnormal. His own view, postulating simply a building and location  of markedly unsanitary qualities, had nothing to do with abnormality;  but he realized that the very picturesqueness which aroused his own  interest would in a boy's fanciful mind take on all manner of gruesome  imaginative associations.    The doctor was a bachelor; a white-haired, clean-shaven, old-fashioned  gentleman, and a local historian of note, who had often broken a lance  with such controversial guardians of tradition as Sidney S. Rider and  Thomas W. Bicknell. He lived with one man-servant in a Georgian  homestead with knocker and iron-railed steps, balanced eerily on the  steep ascent of North Court Street beside the ancient brick court and  colony house where his grandfather--a cousin of that celebrated  privateersman, Captain Whipple, who burnt His Majesty's armed schooner  _Gaspee_ in 1772--had voted in the legislature on May 4, 1776, for the  independence of the Rhode Island Colony. Around him in the damp,  low-ceiled library with the musty white panelling, heavy carved  overmantel and small-paned, vine-shaded windows, were the relics and  records of his ancient family, among which were many dubious allusions  to the shunned house in Benefit Street. That pest spot lies not far  distant--for Benefit runs ledgewise just above the court house along the  precipitous hill up which the first settlement climbed.    When, in the end, my insistent pestering and maturing years evoked from  my uncle the hoarded lore I sought, there lay before me a strange enough  chronicle. Long-winded, statistical, and drearily genealogical as some  of the matter was, there ran through it a continuous thread of brooding,  tenacious horror and preternatural malevolence which impressed me even  more than it had impressed the good doctor. Separate events fitted  together uncannily, and seemingly irrelevant details held mines of  hideous possibilities. A new and burning curiosity grew in me, compared  to which my boyish curiosity was feeble and inchoate.    The first revelation led to an exhaustive research, and finally to that  shuddering quest which proved so disastrous to myself and mine. For at  the last my uncle insisted on joining the search I had commenced, and  after a certain night in that house he did not come away with me. I am  lonely without that gentle soul whose long years were filled only with  honor, virtue, good taste, benevolence, and learning. I have reared a  marble urn to his memory in St. John's churchyard--the place that Poe  loved--the hidden grove of giant willows on the hill, where tombs and  headstones huddle quietly between the hoary bulk of the church and the  houses and bank walls of Benefit Street.    The history of the house, opening amidst a maze of dates, revealed no  trace of the sinister either about its construction or about the  prosperous and honorable family who built it. Yet from the first a taint  of calamity, soon increased to boding significance, was apparent. My  uncle's carefully compiled record began with the building of the  structure in 1763, and followed the theme with an unusual amount of  detail. The shunned house, it seems, was first inhabited by William  Harris and his wife Rhoby Dexter, with their children, Elkanah, born in  1755, Abigail, born in 1757, William, Jr., born in 1759, and Ruth, born  in 1761. Harris was a substantial merchant and seaman in the West India  trade, connected with the firm of Obadiah Brown and his nephews. After  Brown's death in 1761, the new firm of Nicholas Brown & Company made him  master of the brig _Prudence_, Providence-built, of 120 tons, thus  enabling him to erect the new homestead he had desired ever since his  marriage.    The site he had chosen--a recently straightened part of the new and  fashionable Back Street, which ran along the side of the hill above  crowded Cheapside--was all that could be wished, and the building did  justice to the location. It was the best that moderate means could  afford, and Harris hastened to move in before the birth of a fifth child  which the family expected. That child, a boy, came in December; but was  still-born. Nor was any child to be born alive in that house for a  century and a half.    The next April, sickness occurred among the children, and Abigail and  Ruth died before the month was over. Doctor Job Ives diagnosed the  trouble as some infantile fever, though others declared it was more of a  mere wasting-away or decline. It seemed, in any event, to be contagious;  for Hannah Bowen, one of the two servants, died of it in the following  June. Eli Lideason, the other servant, constantly complained of  weakness; and would have returned to his father's farm in Rehoboth but  for a sudden attachment for Mehitabel Pierce, who was hired to succeed  Hannah. He died the next year--a sad year indeed, since it marked the  death of William Harris himself, enfeebled as he was by the climate of  Martinique, where his occupation had kept him for considerable periods  during the preceding decade.    The widowed Rhoby Harris never recovered from the shock of her husband's  death, and the passing of her first-born Elkanah two years later was the  final blow to her reason. In 1768 she fell victim to a mild form of  insanity, and was thereafter confined to the upper part of the house;  her elder maiden sister, Mercy Dexter, having moved in to take charge of  the family. Mercy was a plain, raw-boned woman of great strength; but  her health visibly declined from the time of her advent. She was greatly  devoted to her unfortunate sister, and had an especial affection for her  only surviving nephew William, who from a sturdy infant had become a  sickly, spindling lad. In this year the servant Mehitabel died, and the  other servant, Preserved Smith, left without coherent explanation--or at  least, with only some wild tales and a complaint that he disliked the  smell of the place. For a time Mercy could secure no more help, since  the seven deaths and case of madness, all occurring within five years'  space, had begun to set in motion the body of fireside rumor which later  became so bizarre. Ultimately, however, she obtained new servants from  out of town; Ann White, a morose woman from that part of North Kingstown  now set off as the township of Exeter, and a capable Boston man named  Zenas Low.           *       *       *       *       *    It was Ann White who first gave definite shape to the sinister idle  talk. Mercy should have known better than to hire anyone from the  Nooseneck Hill country, for that remote bit of backwoods was then, as  now, a seat of the most uncomfortable superstitions. As lately as 1892  an Exeter community exhumed a dead body and ceremoniously burnt its  heart in order to prevent certain alleged visitations injurious to the  public health and peace, and one may imagine the point of view of the  same section in 1768. Ann's tongue was perniciously active, and within a  few months Mercy discharged her, filling her place with a faithful and  amiable Amazon from Newport, Maria Robbins.    Meanwhile poor Rhoby Harris, in her madness, gave voice to dreams and  imaginings of the most hideous sort. At times her screams became  insupportable, and for long periods she would utter shrieking horrors  which necessitated her son's temporary residence with his cousin, Peleg  Harris, in Presbyterian Lane near the new college building. The boy  would seem to improve after these visits, and had Mercy been as wise as  she was well-meaning, she would have let him live permanently with  Peleg. Just what Mrs. Harris cried out in her fits of violence,  tradition hesitates to say; or rather, presents such extravagant  accounts that they nullify themselves through sheer absurdity. Certainly  it sounds absurd to hear that a woman educated only in the rudiments of  French often shouted for hours in a coarse and idiomatic form of that  language, or that the same person, alone and guarded, complained wildly  of a staring thing which bit and chewed at her. In 1772 the servant  Zenas died, and when Mrs. Harris heard of it she laughed with a shocking  delight utterly foreign to her. The next year she herself died, and was  laid to rest in the North Burial Ground beside her husband.    Upon the outbreak of trouble with Great Britain in 1775, William Harris,  despite his scant sixteen years and feeble constitution, managed to  enlist in the Army of Observation under General Greene; and from that  time on enjoyed a steady rise in health and prestige. In 1780, as a  captain in the Rhode Island forces in New Jersey under Colonel Angell,  he met and married Phebe Hetfield of Elizabethtown, whom he brought to  Providence upon his honorable discharge in the following year.    The young soldier's return was not a thing of unmitigated happiness. The  house, it is true, was still in good condition; and the street had been  widened and changed in name from Back Street to Benefit Street. But  Mercy Dexter's once robust frame had undergone a sad and curious decay,  so that she was now a"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/31511"],[0,"A History of Witchcraft in England from 1558 to 1718 (#2)"],[1," find time  to go the rounds of the English counties and search the masses of gaol  delivery records and municipal archives. From the really small amount of  new material on the subject brought to light by the Historical  Manuscripts Commission and by the publication of many municipal records,  it seems improbable that such a search would uncover so many unlisted  trials as seriously to modify the narrative. Nevertheless until such a  search is made no history of the subject has the right to be counted  final. Mr. Charles W. Wallace, the student of Shakespeare, tells me that  in turning over the multitudinous records of the Star Chamber he found a  few witch cases. Professor Kittredge believes that there is still a  great deal of such material to be turned up in private collections and  local archives. Any information on this matter which any student of  English local history can give me will be gratefully received.    I wish to express my thanks for reading parts of the manuscript to  William Savage Johnson of Kansas University and to Miss Ada Comstock of  the University of Minnesota. For general assistance and advice on the  subject I am under obligations to Professor Wilbur C. Abbott and to  Professor George Burton Adams of Yale University. It is quite impossible  to say how very much I owe to Professor George L. Burr of Cornell. From  cover to cover the book, since the award to it of the Adams Prize, has  profited from his painstaking criticism and wise suggestion.

THE BEGINNINGS OF ENGLISH WITCHCRAFT.      It has been said by a thoughtful writer that the subject of witchcraft  has hardly received that place which it deserves in the history of  opinions. There has been, of course, a reason for this neglect--the fact  that the belief in witchcraft is no longer existent among intelligent  people and that its history, in consequence, seems to possess rather an  antiquarian than a living interest. No one can tell the story of the  witch trials of sixteenth and seventeenth century England without  digging up a buried past, and the process of exhumation is not always  pleasant. Yet the study of English witchcraft is more than an unsightly  exposure of a forgotten superstition. There were few aspects of  sixteenth and seventeenth century life that were not affected by the  ugly belief. It is quite impossible to grasp the social conditions, it  is impossible to understand the opinions, fears, and hopes of the men  and women who lived in Elizabethan and Stuart England, without some  knowledge of the part played in that age by witchcraft. It was a matter  that concerned all classes from the royal household to the ignorant  denizens of country villages. Privy councillors anxious about their  sovereign and thrifty peasants worrying over their crops, clergymen  alert to detect the Devil in their own parishes, medical quacks eager to  profit by the fear of evil women, justices of the peace zealous to beat  down the works of Satan--all classes, indeed--believed more or less  sincerely in the dangerous powers of human creatures who had  surrendered themselves to the Evil One.    Witchcraft, in a general and vague sense, was something very old in  English history. In a more specific and limited sense it is a  comparatively modern phenomenon. This leads us to a definition of the  term. It is a definition that can be given adequately only in an  historical way. A group of closely related and somewhat ill defined  conceptions went far back. Some of them, indeed, were to be found in the  Old Testament, many of them in the Latin and Greek writers. The word  witchcraft itself belonged to Anglo-Saxon days. As early as the seventh  century Theodore of Tarsus imposed penances upon magicians and  enchanters, and the laws, from Alfred on, abound with mentions of  witchcraft.[1] From these passages the meaning of the word witch as used  by the early English may be fairly deduced. The word was the current  English term for one who used spells and charms, who was assisted by  evil spirits to accomplish certain ends. It will be seen that this is by  no means the whole meaning of the term in later times. Nothing is yet  said about the transformation of witches into other shapes, and there is  no mention of a compact, implicit or otherwise, with the Devil; there is  no allusion to the nocturnal meetings of the Devil's worshippers and to  the orgies that took place upon those occasions; there is no elaborate  and systematic theological explanation of human relations with demons.    But these notions were to reach England soon enough. Already there were  germinating in southern Europe ideas out of which the completer notions  were to spring. As early as the close of the ninth century certain  Byzantine traditions were being introduced into the West. There were  legends of men who had made written compacts with the Devil, men whom he  promised to assist in this world in return for their souls in the  next.[2] But, while such stories were current throughout the Middle  Ages, the notion behind them does not seem to have been connected with  the other features of what was to make up the idea of witchcraft until  about the middle of the fourteenth century. It was about that time that  the belief in the \"Sabbat\" or nocturnal assembly of the witches made its  appearance.[3] The belief grew up that witches rode through the air to  these meetings, that they renounced Christ and engaged in foul forms of  homage to Satan. Lea tells us that towards the close of the century the  University of Paris formulated the theory that a pact with Satan was  inherent in all magic, and judges began to connect this pact with the  old belief in night riders through the air. The countless confessions  that resulted from the carefully framed questions of the judges served  to develop and systematize the theory of the subject. The witch was much  more than a sorcerer. Sorcerers had been those who, through the aid of  evil spirits, by the use of certain words or of representations of  persons or things produced changes above the ordinary course of nature.  \"The witch,\" says Lea, \"has abandoned Christianity, has renounced her  baptism, has worshipped Satan as her God, has surrendered herself to  him, body and soul, and exists only to be his instrument in working the  evil to her fellow creatures which he cannot accomplish without a human  agent.\"[4] This was the final and definite notion of a witch. It was the  conception that controlled European opinion on the subject from the  latter part of the fourteenth to the close of the seventeenth century.  It was, as has been seen, an elaborate theological notion that had grown  out of the comparatively simple and vague ideas to be found in the  scriptural and classical writers.    It may well be doubted whether this definite and intricate theological  notion of witchcraft reached England so early as the fourteenth century.  Certainly not until a good deal later--if negative evidence is at all  trustworthy--was a clear distinction made between sorcery and  witchcraft. The witches searched for by Henry IV, the professor of  divinity, the friar, the clerk, and the witch of Eye, who were hurried  before the Council of Henry VI, that unfortunate Duchess of Gloucester  who had to walk the streets of London, the Duchess of Bedford, the  conspirators against Edward IV who were supposed to use magic, the  unlucky mistress of Edward IV--none of these who through the course of  two centuries were charged with magical misdeeds were, so far as we  know, accused of those dreadful relations with the Devil, the nauseating  details of which fill out the later narratives of witch history.    The truth seems to be that the idea of witchcraft was not very clearly  defined and differentiated in the minds of ordinary Englishmen until  after the beginning of legislation upon the subject. It is not  impossible"]]]
