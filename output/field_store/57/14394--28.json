Recognising so  promptly the one measure of the worth of a given subject, the question  about it that, rightly answered, disposes of all others--is it valid,  in a word, is it genuine, is it sincere, the result of some direct  impression or perception of life?--I had found small edification,  mostly, in a critical pretension that had neglected from the first  all delimitation of ground and all definition of terms. The air of  my earlier time shows, to memory, as darkened, all round, with that  vanity--unless the difference to-day be just in one's own final  impatience, the lapse of one's attention. There is, I think, no more  nutritive or suggestive truth in this connexion than that of the perfect  dependence of the \"moral\" sense of a work of art on the amount of felt  life concerned in producing it. The question comes back thus, obviously,  to the kind and the degree of the artist's prime sensibility, which is  the soil out of which his subject springs. The quality and capacity of  that soil, its ability to \"grow\" with due freshness and straightness any  vision of life, represents, strongly or weakly, the projected morality.  That element is but another name for the more or less close connexion of  the subject with some mark made on the intelligence, with some sincere  experience. By which, at the same time, of course, one is far from  contending that this enveloping air of the artist's humanity--which  gives the last touch to the worth of the work--is not a widely and  wondrously varying element; being on one occasion a rich and magnificent  medium and on another a comparatively poor and ungenerous one. Here we  get exactly the high price of the novel as a literary form--its power  not only, while preserving that form with closeness, to range  through all the differences of the individual relation to its general  subject-matter, all the varieties of outlook on life, of disposition to  reflect and project, created by conditions that are never the same from  man to man (or, so far as that goes, from man to woman), but positively  to appear more true to its character in proportion as it strains, or  tends to burst, with a latent extravagance, its mould.    The house of fiction has in short not one window, but a million--a  number of possible windows not to be reckoned, rather; every one of  which has been pierced, or is still pierceable, in its vast front, by  the need of the individual vision and by the pressure of the individual  will. These apertures, of dissimilar shape and size, hang so, all  together, over the human scene that we might have expected of them a  greater sameness of report than we find. They are but windows at the  best, mere holes in a dead wall, disconnected, perched aloft; they are  not hinged doors opening straight upon life. But they have this mark of  their own that at each of them stands a figure with a pair of eyes,  or at least with a field-glass, which forms, again and again, for  observation, a unique instrument, insuring to the person making use of  it an impression distinct from every other. He and his neighbours are  watching the same show, but one seeing more where the other sees less,  one seeing black where the other sees white, one seeing big where the  other sees small, one seeing coarse where the other sees fine. And  so on, and so on; there is fortunately no saying on what, for the  particular pair of eyes, the window may NOT open; \"fortunately\" by  reason, precisely, of this incalculability of range. The spreading  field, the human scene, is the \"choice of subject\"; the pierced  aperture, either broad or balconied or slit-like and low-browed, is the  \"literary form\"; but they are, singly or together, as nothing without  the posted presence of the watcher--without, in other words, the  consciousness of the artist. Tell me what the artist is, and I will tell  you of what he has BEEN conscious. Thereby I shall express to you at  once his boundless freedom and his \"moral\" reference.    All this is a long way round, however, for my word about my dim first  move toward \"The Portrait,\" which was exactly my grasp of a single  character--an acquisition I had made, moreover, after a fashion not  here to be retraced. Enough that I was, as seemed to me, in complete  possession of it, that I had been so for a long time, that this had made  it familiar and yet had not blurred its charm, and that, all urgently,  all tormentingly, I saw it in motion and, so to speak, in transit. This  amounts to saying that I saw it as bent upon its fate--some fate or  other; which, among the possibilities, being precisely the question.  Thus I had my vivid individual--vivid, so strangely, in spite of being  still at large, not confined by the conditions, not engaged in the  tangle, to which we look for much of the impress that constitutes an  identity. If the apparition was still all to be placed how came it to  be vivid?--since we puzzle such quantities out, mostly, just by the  business of placing them. One could answer such a question beautifully,  doubtless, if one could do so subtle, if not so monstrous, a thing as to  write the history of the growth of one's imagination. One would describe  then what, at a given time, had extraordinarily happened to it, and one  would so, for instance, be in a position to tell, with an approach to  clearness, how, under favour of occasion, it had been able to take over  (take over straight from life) such and such a constituted, animated  figure or form. The figure has to that extent, as you see, BEEN  placed--placed in the imagination that detains it, preserves,  protects, enjoys it, conscious of its presence in the dusky, crowded,  heterogeneous back-shop of the mind very much as a wary dealer in  precious odds and ends, competent to make an \"advance\" on rare objects  confided to him, is conscious of the rare little \"piece\" left in deposit  by the reduced, mysterious lady of title or the speculative amateur,  and which is already there to disclose its merit afresh as soon as a key  shall have clicked in a cupboard-door.    That may he, I recognise, a somewhat superfine analogy for the  particular \"value\" I here speak of, the image of the young feminine  nature that I had had for so considerable a time all curiously at my  disposal; but it appears to fond memory quite to fit the fact--with the  recall, in addition, of my pious desire but to place my treasure right.  I quite remind myself thus of the dealer resigned not to \"realise,\"  resigned to keeping the precious object locked up indefinitely rather  than commit it, at no matter what price, to vulgar hands. For there  ARE dealers in these forms and figures and treasures capable of that  refinement. The point is, however, that this single small corner-stone,  the conception of a certain young woman affronting her destiny, had  begun with being all my outfit for the large building of \"The Portrait  of a Lady.\" It came to be a square and spacious house--or has at least  seemed so to me in this going over it again; but, such as it is, it  had to be put up round my young woman while she stood there in perfect  isolation. That is to me, artistically speaking, the circumstance of  interest; for I have lost myself once more, I confess, in the curiosity  of analysing the structure. By what process of logical accretion was  this slight \"personality,\" the mere slim shade of an intelligent but  presumptuous girl, to find itself endowed with the high attributes of a  Subject?--and indeed by what thinness, at the best, would such a subject  not be vitiated? Millions of presumptuous girls, intelligent or not  intelligent, daily affront their destiny, and what is it open to their  destiny to be, at the most, that we should make an ado about it? The  novel is of its very nature an \"ado,\" an ado about something, and the  larger the form it takes the greater of course the ado. Therefore,  consciously, that was what one was in for--for positively organising an  ado about Isabel Archer.    One looked it well in the face, I seem to remember, this extravagance;  and with the effect precisely of recognising the charm of the problem.  Challenge any such problem with any intelligence, and you immediately  see how full it is of substance; the wonder being, all the while, as we  look at the world, how absolutely, how inordinately, the Isabel Archers,  and even much smaller female fry, insist on mattering. George Eliot has  admirably noted it--\"In these frail vessels is borne onward through the  ages the treasure of human affection.\" In \"Romeo and Juliet\" Juliet has  to be important, just as, in \"Adam Bede\" and \"The Mill on the Floss\" and  \"Middlemarch\" and \"Daniel Deronda,\" Hetty Sorrel and Maggie Tulliver and  Rosamond Vincy and Gwendolen Harleth have to be; with that much of firm  ground, that much of bracing air, at the disposal all the while of  their feet and their lungs. They are typical, none the less, of a class  difficult, in the individual case, to make a centre of interest; so  difficult in fact that many an expert painter, as for instance Dickens  and Walter Scott, as for instance even, in the main, so subtle a hand  as that of R. L. Stevenson, has preferred to leave the task unattempted.  There are in fact writers as to whom we make out that their refuge  from this is to assume it to be not worth their attempting; by which  pusillanimity in truth their honour is scantly saved. It is never an  attestation of a value, or even of our imperfect sense of one, it is  never a tribute to any truth at all, that we shall represent that value  badly. It never makes up, artistically, for an artist's dim feeling  about a thing that he shall \"do\" the thing as ill as possible. There are  better ways than that, the best of all of which is to begin with less  stupidity.    It may be answered meanwhile, "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/2834"],[0,"The Portrait of a Lady — Volume 2 (#2)"],[1," to their eternal silence.  It is impossible, in Rome at least, to look long at a great company of  Greek sculptures without feeling the effect of their noble quietude;  which, as with a high door closed for the ceremony, slowly drops on  the spirit the large white mantle of peace. I say in Rome especially,  because the Roman air is an exquisite medium for such impressions. The  golden sunshine mingles with them, the deep stillness of the past, so  vivid yet, though it is nothing but a void full of names, seems to throw  a solemn spell upon them. The blinds were partly closed in the windows  of the Capitol, and a clear, warm shadow rested on the figures and made  them more mildly human. Isabel sat there a long time, under the charm  of their motionless grace, wondering to what, of their experience, their  absent eyes were open, and how, to our ears, their alien lips would  sound. The dark red walls of the room threw them into relief; the  polished marble floor reflected their beauty. She had seen them all  before, but her enjoyment repeated itself, and it was all the greater  because she was glad again, for the time, to be alone. At last, however,  her attention lapsed, drawn off by a deeper tide of life. An occasional  tourist came in, stopped and stared a moment at the Dying Gladiator, and  then passed out of the other door, creaking over the smooth pavement. At  the end of half an hour Gilbert Osmond reappeared, apparently in advance  of his companions. He strolled toward her slowly, with his hands  behind him and his usual enquiring, yet not quite appealing smile. \"I'm  surprised to find you alone, I thought you had company.    \"So I have--the best.\" And she glanced at the Antinous and the Faun.    \"Do you call them better company than an English peer?\"    \"Ah, my English peer left me some time ago.\" She got up, speaking with  intention a little dryly.    Mr. Osmond noted her dryness, which contributed for him to the interest  of his question. \"I'm afraid that what I heard the other evening is  true: you're rather cruel to that nobleman.\"    Isabel looked a moment at the vanquished Gladiator. \"It's not true. I'm  scrupulously kind.\"    \"That's exactly what I mean!\" Gilbert Osmond returned, and with such  happy hilarity that his joke needs to be explained. We know that he was  fond of originals, of rarities, of the superior and the exquisite; and  now that he had seen Lord Warburton, whom he thought a very fine example  of his race and order, he perceived a new attraction in the idea of  taking to himself a young lady who had qualified herself to figure in  his collection of choice objects by declining so noble a hand. Gilbert  Osmond had a high appreciation of this particular patriciate; not so  much for its distinction, which he thought easily surpassable, as for  its solid actuality. He had never forgiven his star for not appointing  him to an English dukedom, and he could measure the unexpectedness of  such conduct as Isabel's. It would be proper that the woman he might  marry should have done something of that sort.        CHAPTER XXIX    Ralph Touchett, in talk with his excellent friend, had rather markedly  qualified, as we know, his recognition of Gilbert Osmond's personal  merits; but he might really have felt himself illiberal in the light of  that gentleman's conduct during the rest of the visit to Rome. Osmond  spent a portion of each day with Isabel and her companions, and ended  by affecting them as the easiest of men to live with. Who wouldn't have  seen that he could command, as it were, both tact and gaiety?--which  perhaps was exactly why Ralph had made his old-time look of superficial  sociability a reproach to him. Even Isabel's invidious kinsman was  obliged to admit that he was just now a delightful associate. His  good humour was imperturbable, his knowledge of the right fact, his  production of the right word, as convenient as the friendly flicker of  a match for your cigarette. Clearly he was amused--as amused as a man  could be who was so little ever surprised, and that made him almost  applausive. It was not that his spirits were visibly high--he would  never, in the concert of pleasure, touch the big drum by so much as a  knuckle: he had a mortal dislike to the high, ragged note, to what  he called random ravings. He thought Miss Archer sometimes of too  precipitate a readiness. It was pity she had that fault, because if she  had not had it she would really have had none; she would have been as  smooth to his general need of her as handled ivory to the palm. If he  was not personally loud, however, he was deep, and during these closing  days of the Roman May he knew a complacency that matched with slow  irregular walks under the pines of the Villa Borghese, among the  small sweet meadow-flowers and the mossy marbles. He was pleased with  everything; he had never before been pleased with so many things at  once. Old impressions, old enjoyments, renewed themselves; one evening,  going home to his room at the inn, he wrote down a little sonnet to  which he prefixed the title of \"Rome Revisited.\" A day or two later he  showed this piece of correct and ingenious verse to Isabel, explaining  to her that it was an Italian fashion to commemorate the occasions of  life by a tribute to the muse.    He took his pleasures in general singly; he was too often--he would have  admitted that--too sorely aware of something wrong, something ugly; the  fertilising dew of a conceivable felicity too seldom descended on his  spirit. But at present he was happy--happier than he had perhaps ever  been in his life, and the feeling had a large foundation. This was  simply the sense of success--the most agreeable emotion of the human  heart. Osmond had never had too much of it; in this respect he had the  irritation of satiety, as he knew perfectly well and often reminded  himself. \"Ah no, I've not been spoiled; certainly I've not been  spoiled,\" he used inwardly to repeat. \"If I do succeed before I die  I shall thoroughly have earned it.\" He was too apt to reason as if  \"earning\" this boon consisted above all of covertly aching for it and  might be confined to that exercise. Absolutely void of it, also, his  career had not been; he might indeed have suggested to a spectator here  and there that he was resting on vague laurels. But his triumphs were,  some of them, now too old; others had been too easy. The present one had  been less arduous than might have been expected, but had been easy--that  is had been rapid--only because he had made an altogether exceptional  effort, a greater effort than he had believed it in him to make. The  desire to have something or other to show for his \"parts\"--to show  somehow or other--had been the dream of his youth; but as the years went  on the conditions attached to any marked proof of rarity had affected  him more and more as gross and detestable; like the swallowing of mugs  of beer to advertise what one could \"stand.\" If an anonymous drawing on  a museum wall had been conscious and watchful it might have known this  peculiar pleasure of being at last and all of a sudden identified--as  from the hand of a great master--by the so high and so unnoticed fact of  style. His \"style\" was what the girl had discovered with a little help;  and now, beside herself enjoying it, she should publish it to the world  without his having any of the trouble. She should do the thing FOR him,  and he would not have waited in vain.    Shortly before the time fixed in advance for her departure this young  lady received from Mrs. Touchett a telegram running as follows: \"Leave  Florence 4th June for Bellaggio, and take you if you have not other  views. But can't wait if you dawdle in Rome.\" The dawdling in Rome was  very pleasant, but Isabel had different views, and she let her aunt know  she would immediately join her. She told Gilbert Osmond that she had  done so, and he replied that, spending many of his summers as well as  his winters in Italy, he himself would loiter a little longer in the  cool shadow of Saint Peter's. He would not return to Florence for ten  days more, and in that time she would have started for Bellaggio.  It might be months in this case before he should see her again. This  exchange took place in the large decorated sitting-room occupied by our  friends at the hotel; it was late in the evening, and Ralph Touchett was  to take his cousin back to Florence on the morrow. Osmond had found the  girl alone; Miss Stackpole had contracted a friendship with a delightful  American family on the fourth floor and had mounted the interminable  staircase to pay them a visit. Henrietta contracted friendships, in  travelling, with great freedom, and had formed in railway-carriages  several that were among her most valued ties. Ralph was making  arrangements for the morrow's journey, and Isabel sat alone in a  wilderness of yellow upholstery. The chairs and sofas were orange;  the walls and windows were draped in purple and gilt. The mirrors, the  pictures had great flamboyant frames; the ceiling was deeply vaulted and  painted over with naked muses and cherubs. For Osmond the place was ugly  to distress; the false colours, the sham splendour were like vulgar,  bragging, lying talk. Isabel had taken in hand a volume of Ampere,  presented, on their arrival in Rome, by Ralph; but though she held it in  her lap with her finger vaguely kept in the place she was not impatient  to pursue her study. A lamp covered with a drooping veil of pink  tissue-paper burned on the table beside her and diffused a strange pale  rosiness over the scene.    \"You say you'll come back; but who knows?\" Gilbert Osmond said.    \"I think you're much more likely to start on your voyage round the  world. You're under no obligation to come back; you can do exactly what  you choose; you can roam through space.\"    \"Well, Italy's a part of space,\" Isabel answered. \"I can take it on the  way.\"    \"On the way round "]]]
