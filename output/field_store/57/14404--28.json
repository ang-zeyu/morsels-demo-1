PASSAGE OF THE EARTH THROUGH THE THICKEST        PORTION OF A METEOR SWARM                 269          ASTRONOMY OF TO-DAY          CHAPTER I    THE ANCIENT VIEW      It is never safe, as we know, to judge by appearances, and this is  perhaps more true of astronomy than of anything else.    For instance, the idea which one would most naturally form of the earth  and heaven is that the solid earth on which we live and move extends to  a great distance in every direction, and that the heaven is an immense  dome upon the inner surface of which the stars are fixed. Such must  needs have been the idea of the universe held by men in the earliest  times. In their view the earth was of paramount importance. The sun and  moon were mere lamps for the day and for the night; and these, if not  gods themselves, were at any rate under the charge of special deities,  whose task it was to guide their motions across the vaulted sky.    Little by little, however, this simple estimate of nature began to be  overturned. Difficult problems agitated the human mind. On what, for  instance, did the solid earth rest, and what prevented the vaulted  heaven from falling in upon men and crushing them out of existence?  Fantastic myths sprang from the vain attempts to solve these riddles.  The Hindoos, for example, imagined the earth as supported by four  elephants which stood upon the back of a gigantic tortoise, which, in  its turn, floated on the surface of an elemental ocean. The early  Western civilisations conceived the fable of the Titan Atlas, who, as a  punishment for revolt against the Olympian gods, was condemned to hold  up the expanse of sky for ever and ever.    Later on glimmerings of the true light began to break in upon men. The  Greek philosophers, who busied themselves much with such matters,  gradually became convinced that the earth was spherical in shape, that  is to say, round like a ball. In this opinion we now know that they were  right; but in their other important belief, viz. that the earth was  placed at the centre of all things, they were indeed very far from the  truth.    By the second century of the Christian era, the ideas of the early  philosophers had become hardened into a definite theory, which, though  it appears very incorrect to us to-day, nevertheless demands exceptional  notice from the fact that it was everywhere accepted as the true  explanation until so late as some four centuries ago. This theory of the  universe is known by the name of the Ptolemaic System, because it was  first set forth in definite terms by one of the most famous of the  astronomers of antiquity, Claudius Ptolemaeus Pelusinensis (100-170  A.D.), better known as Ptolemy of Alexandria.    In his system the Earth occupied the centre; while around it circled in  order outwards the Moon, the planets Mercury and Venus, the Sun, and  then the planets Mars, Jupiter, and Saturn. Beyond these again revolved  the background of the heaven, upon which it was believed that the stars  were fixed--         \"Stellis ardentibus aptum,\"    as Virgil puts it (see Fig. 1).    [Illustration: FIG. 1.--The Ptolemaic idea of the Universe.]    The Ptolemaic system persisted unshaken for about fourteen hundred years  after the death of its author. Clearly men were flattered by the notion  that their earth was the most important body in nature, that it stood  still at the centre of the universe, and was the pivot upon which all  things revolved.          CHAPTER II    THE MODERN VIEW      It is still well under four hundred years since the modern, or  Copernican, theory of the universe supplanted the Ptolemaic, which had  held sway during so many centuries. In this new theory, propounded  towards the middle of the sixteenth century by Nicholas Copernicus  (1473-1543), a Prussian astronomer, the earth was dethroned from its  central position and considered merely as one of a number of planetary  bodies which revolve around the sun. As it is not a part of our purpose  to follow in detail the history of the science, it seems advisable to  begin by stating in a broad fashion the conception of the universe as  accepted and believed in to-day.    The Sun, the most important of the celestial bodies so far as we are  concerned, occupies the central position; not, however, in the whole  universe, but only in that limited portion which is known as the Solar  System. Around it, in the following order outwards, circle the planets  Mercury, Venus, the Earth, Mars, Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, and Neptune  (see Fig. 2, p. 21). At an immense distance beyond the solar system, and  scattered irregularly through the depth of space, lie the stars. The two  first-mentioned members of the solar system, Mercury and Venus, are  known as the Inferior Planets; and in their courses about the sun, they  always keep well inside the path along which our earth moves. The  remaining members (exclusive of the earth) are called Superior Planets,  and their paths lie all outside that of the earth.    [Illustration: FIG. 2.--The Copernican theory of the Solar System.]    The five planets, Mercury, Venus, Mars, Jupiter, and Saturn, have been  known from all antiquity. Nothing then can bring home to us more  strongly the immense advance which has taken place in astronomy during  modern times than the fact that it is only 127 years since observation  of the skies first added a planet to that time-honoured number. It was  indeed on the 13th of March 1781, while engaged in observing the  constellation of the Twins, that the justly famous Sir William Herschel  caught sight of an object which he did not recognise as having met with  before. He at first took it for a comet, but observations of its  movements during a few days showed it to be a planet. This body, which  the power of the telescope alone had thus shown to belong to the solar  family, has since become known to science under the name of Uranus. By  its discovery the hitherto accepted limits of the solar system were at  once pushed out to twice their former extent, and the hope naturally  arose that other planets would quickly reveal themselves in the  immensities beyond.    For a number of years prior to Herschel's great discovery, it had been  noticed that the distances at which the then known planets circulated  appeared to be arranged in a somewhat orderly progression outwards from  the sun. This seeming plan, known to astronomers by the name of Bode's  Law, was closely confirmed by the distance of the new planet Uranus.  There still lay, however, a broad gap between the planets Mars and  Jupiter. Had another planet indeed circuited there, the solar system  would have presented an appearance of almost perfect order. But the void  between Mars and Jupiter was unfilled; the space in which one would  reasonably expect to find another planet circling was unaccountably  empty.    On the first day of the nineteenth century the mystery was however  explained, a body being discovered[1] which revolved in the space that  had hitherto been considered planetless. But it was a tiny globe hardly  worthy of the name of planet. In the following year a second body was  discovered revolving in the same space; but it was even smaller in size  than the first. During the ensuing five years two more of these little  planets were discovered. Then came a pause, no more such bodies being  added to the system until half-way through the century, when suddenly  the discovery of these so-called \"minor planets\" began anew. Since then  additions to this portion of our system have rained thick and fast. The  small bodies have received the name of Asteroids or Planetoids; and up  to the present time some six hundred of them are known to exist, all  revolving in the previously unfilled space between Mars and Jupiter.    In the year 1846 the outer boundary of the solar system was again  extended by the discovery that a great planet circulated beyond Uranus.  The new body, which received the name of Neptune, was brought to light  as the result of calculations made at the same time, though quite  independently, by the Cambridge mathematician Adams, and the French  astronomer Le Verrier. The discovery of Neptune differed, however, from  that of Uranus in the following respect. Uranus was found merely in the  course of ordinary telescopic survey of the heavens. The position of  Neptune, on the other hand, was predicted as the result of rigorous  mathematical investigations undertaken with the object of fixing the  position of an unseen and still more distant body, the"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/28572"],[0,"Letters on an Elk Hunt (#2)"],[1,"being driven home by  a barefooted boy with a gun on his shoulder and a limp brown rabbit in  his hand. But I shall have to leave that to your imagination and move  on to the Fourth.    On that day every one turns out; even from the very farthest outlying  ranches they come, and every one dressed in his best. No matter what  privation is suffered all the rest of the time, on this day every one  is dressed to kill. Every one has a little money with which to buy  gaudy boxes of candy; every girl has a chew of gum. Among the children  friendship is proved by invitations to share lemons. They cordially  invite each other to \"come get a suck o' my lemon.\" I just _love_ to  watch them. Old and young are alike; whatever may trouble them at  other times is forgotten, and every one dances, eats candy, sucks  lemons, laughs, and makes merry on the Fourth.    I didn't care much for their contests. I was busy watching the faces.  Soon I saw one I knew. Connie was making her way toward me. I wondered  how I could ever have thought her plain. Pride lighted every feature.  She led by the hand the most beautiful child I have ever seen. She is  a few weeks younger than Jerrine[1] but much smaller. She had such an  elusive beauty that I cannot describe it. One not acquainted with her  story might have thought her dress out of taste out among the sand  dunes and sage-brush in the hot sun, but I knew, and I felt the thrill  of sheer blue silk, dainty patent-leather slippers, and big blue hat  just loaded with pink rose-buds.    [Footnote 1: The author's daughter, aged eight.]    \"This is my Lennie,\" said Connie proudly.    I saw all the Ford family before I left,--the weak-faced,  discouraged-looking father and the really beautiful girls. Connie was  neat in a pretty little dress, cheap but becoming, and her shoes were  mates. Lennie was the center of family pride. She represented all  their longings.    Before I left, Connie whispered to me that she would very soon have  money enough to pay for her mother's tombstone. \"Then I will have had  everything I ever wanted. I guess I won't have anything else to live  for then; I guess I will have to get to wanting something for Lennie.\"    On our way home even the mosquito bites didn't annoy me; I was too  full of Connie's happiness. All my happiness lacked was your presence.  If I had had you beside me to share the joy and beauty, I could have  asked for nothing more. I kept saying, \"How Mrs. Coney would enjoy  this!\" All I can do is to kind of hash it over for you. I hope you  like hash.                                  With much love to you,                                     ELINORE.          II    THE START                                    IN CAMP ON THE DESERT,                                     August 24, 1914.    DEAR MRS. CONEY,--    At last we are off. I am powerfully glad. I shall have to enjoy this  trip for us both. You see how greedy I am for new experiences! I have  never been on a prolonged hunt before, so I am looking forward to a  heap of fun. I hardly know what to do about writing, but shall try to  write every two days. I want you to have as much of this trip as I can  put on paper, so we will begin at the start.    To begin with we were all to meet at Green River, to start the  twentieth; but a professor coming from somewhere in the East delayed  us a day, and also some of the party changed their plans; that reduced  our number but not our enthusiasm.    A few days before we left the ranch I telephoned Mrs. Louderer and  tried to persuade her to go along, but she replied, \"For why should I  go? Vat? Iss it to freeze? I can sleep out on some rocks here and with  a stick I can beat the sage-bush, which will give me the smell you  will smell of the outside. And for the game I can have a beef kill  which iss better to eat as elk.\"    I love Mrs. Louderer dearly, but she is absolutely devoid of  imagination, and her matter-of-factness is mighty trying sometimes.  However, she sent me a bottle of goose-grease to ward off colds from  the \"kinder.\"    I tried Mrs. O'Shaughnessy, but she was plumb aggravating and  non-committal, and it seemed when we got to Green River that I would  be the only woman in the party. Besides, all the others were strangers  to me except young Mr. Haynes, who was organizing the hunt. Really the  prospect didn't seem so joyous.    The afternoon before we were to start I went with Mr. Stewart and Mr.  Haynes to meet the train. We were expecting the professor. But the  only passenger who got off was a slight, gray-eyed girl. She looked  about her uncertainly for a moment and then went into the depot while  we returned to the hotel. Just as I started up the steps my eyes were  gladdened by the sight of Mrs. O'Shaughnessy in her buckboard trotting  merrily up the street. She waved her hand to us and drove up. Clyde  took her team to the livery barn and she came up to my room with me.    \"It's going with you I am,\" she began. \"Ye'll need somebody to keep  yez straight and to sew up the holes ye'll be shooting into each  other.\"    After she had \"tidied up a bit\" we went down to supper. We were all  seated at one table, and there was yet an empty place; but soon the  girl we had seen get off the train came and seated herself in it.    \"Can any of you tell me how to get to Kendall, Wyoming?\" she asked.    I didn't know nor did Clyde, but Mrs. O'Shaughnessy knew, so she  answered. \"Kendall is in the forest reserve up north. It is two  hundred miles from here and half of the distance is across desert, but  they have an automobile route as far as Pinedale; you could get that  far on the auto stage. After that I suppose you could get some one to  take you on.\"    \"Thank you,\" said the girl. \"My name is Elizabeth Hull. I am alone in  the world, and I am not expected at Kendall, so I am obliged to ask  and to take care of myself.\"    Mrs. O'Shaughnessy at once mentioned her own name and introduced the  rest of us. After supper Miss Hull and Mrs. O'Shaughnessy had a long  talk. I was not much surprised when Mrs. O'Shaughnessy came in to tell  me that she was going to take the girl along. \"Because,\" she said,  \"Kendall is on our way and it's glad I am to help a lone girl. Did you  notice the freckles of her? Sure her forbears hailed from Killarney.\"    So early next morning we were astir. We had outfitted in Green River,  so the wagons were already loaded. I had rather dreaded the professor.  I had pictured to myself a very dignified, bespectacled person, and  I mentally stood in awe of his great learning. Imagine my surprise  when a boyish, laughing young man introduced himself as Professor  Glenholdt. He was so jolly, so unaffected, and so altogether likable,  that my fear vanished and I enjoyed the prospect of his company. Mr.  Haynes and his friend Mr. Struble on their wagon led the way, then we  followed, and after us came Mrs. O'Shaughnessy, and Miss Hull brought  up the rear, with the professor riding horseback beside first one  wagon and then another.    So we set out. There was a great jangling and banging, for our tin  camp-stoves kept the noise going. Neither the children nor I can ride  under cover on a wagon, we get so sick; so there we were, perched  high up on great rolls of bedding and a tent. I reckon we looked funny  to the \"onlookers looking on\" as we clattered down the street; but we  were off and that meant a heap.    All the morning our way lay up the beautiful river, past the great red  cliffs and through tiny green parks, but just before noon the road  wound itself up on to the mesa, which is really the beginning of the  desert. We crowded into the shadow of the wagons to eat our midday  meal; but we could not stop long, because it was twenty-eight miles to  where we could get water for the horses when we should camp that  night. So we wasted no time.    Shortly after noon we could see white clouds of alkali dust ahead. By  and by we came up with the dust-raisers. The children and I had got  into the buckboard with Mrs. O'Shaughnessy and Miss Hull, so as to  ride easier and be able to gossip, and we had driven ahead of the  wagons, so as to avoid the stinging dust.    The sun was just scorching when we overtook the funniest layout I have  seen since Cora Belle[2] drove up to our door the first time. In a  wobbly old buckboard sat a young couple completely engrossed by each  other. That he was a Westerner we knew by his cowboy hat and boots;  that she was an Easterner, by her not knowing how to dress for the  ride across the desert. She wore a foolish little chiffon hat which  the alkali dust had ruined, and all the rest of her clothes matched.  But over them the enterprising young man had raised one of those big  old sunshades that had lettering on them. It kept wobbling about in  the socket he had improvised; one minute we could see \"Tea\"; then a  rut in the road would swing \"Coffee\" around. Their sunshade kept  revolving about that way, and sometimes their heads revolved a little  bit, too. We could hear a word occasionally and knew they were having  a great deal of fun at our expense; but we were amused ourselves, so  we didn't care. They would drive along slowly until we almost reached  them; then they would whip up and raise such a dust that we were  almost choked.    [Footnote 2: The story of Cora Belle is told in _Letters of a Woman  Homesteader_.]    Mrs. O'Shaughnessy determined to drive ahead; so she trotted up  alongside, but she could not get ahead. The young people were  giggling. Mrs. O'Shaughnessy doesn't like to be the joke all the time.  Suddenly she leaned over toward them and said: \"Will ye tell me  something?\" Oh, yes, they would. \"Then,\" she said, \"which of you are  Tea and which Coffee?\"    Their answer was to drive up faster and stir up a powerful lot of  dust. They kept pretty well ahead after that, but at sundown we came  up with them at the well where we were to camp. This well had been  sunk by the"]]]
