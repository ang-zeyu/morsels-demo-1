[Illustration]    This was a lucky thing for him, for the Grizzly did not want to follow him  there; so he waded out on the other side, and bellowing with fury and pain,  slunk off to join the herd to which he belonged.              II        [Illustration]      Old Colonel Pickett, the cattle king, was out riding the range. The night  before, he had seen the new moon descending over the white cone of  Pickett's Peak.    \"I saw the last moon over Frank's Peak,\" said he, \"and the luck was against  me for a month; now I reckon it's my turn.\"    Next morning his luck began. A letter came from Washington granting his  request that a post-office be established at his ranch, and contained the  polite inquiry, \"What name do you suggest for the new post-office?\"        [Illustration]    The Colonel took down his new rifle, a 45-90 repeater. \"May as well,\" he  said; \"this is my month\"; and he rode up the Graybull to see how the cattle  were doing.    As he passed under the Rimrock Mountain he heard a far-away roaring as of  Bulls fighting, but thought nothing of it till he rounded the point and saw  on the flat below a lot of his cattle pawing the dust and bellowing as they  always do when they smell the blood of one of their number. He soon saw  that the great Bull, \"the boss of the bunch,\" was covered with blood. His  back and sides were torn as by a Mountain-lion, and his head was battered  as by another Bull.    \"Grizzly,\" growled the Colonel, for he knew the mountains. He quickly noted  the general direction of the Bull's back trail, then rode toward a high  bank that offered a view. This was across the gravelly ford of the  Graybull, near the mouth of the Piney. His horse splashed through the cold  water and began jerkily to climb the other bank.    As soon as the rider's head rose above the bank his hand grabbed the rifle,  for there in full sight were five Grizzly Bears, an old one and four cubs.    \"Run for the woods,\" growled the Mother Grizzly, for she knew that men  carried guns. Not that she feared for herself; but the idea of such things  among her darlings was too horrible to think of. She set off to guide them  to the timber-tangle on the Lower Piney. But an awful, murderous fusillade  began.        [Illustration]    _Bang!_ and Mother Grizzly felt a deadly pang.    _Bang!_ and poor little Fuzz rolled over with a scream of pain and lay  still.    With a roar of hate and fury Mother Grizzly turned to attack the enemy.    _Bang!_ and she fell paralyzed and dying with a high shoulder shot. And  the three little cubs, not knowing what to do, ran back to their Mother.    _Bang! bang!_ and Mooney and Frizzle sank in dying agonies beside her, and  Wahb, terrified and stupefied, ran in a circle about them. Then, hardly  knowing why, he turned and dashed into the timber-tangle, and disappeared  as a last _bang_ left him with a stinging pain and a useless, broken hind  paw.                      *       *       *       *       *    That is why the post-office was called Four-Bears. The Colonel seemed  pleased with what he had done; indeed, he told of it himself.        [Illustration]    But away up in the woods of Anderson's Peak that night a little lame  Grizzly might have been seen wandering, limping along, leaving a bloody  spot each time he tried to set down his hind paw; whining and whimpering,  \"Mother! Mother! Oh, Mother, where are you?\" for he was cold and hungry,  and had such a pain in his foot. But there was no Mother to come to him,  and he dared not go back where he had left her, so he wandered aimlessly  about among the pines.        [Illustration]    Then he smelled some strange animal smell and heard heavy footsteps; and  not knowing what else to do, he climbed a tree. Presently a band of great,  long-necked, slim-legged animals, taller than his Mother, came by under the  tree. He had seen such once before and had not been afraid of them then,  because he had been with his Mother. But now he kept very quiet in the  tree, and the big creatures stopped picking the grass when they were near  him, and blowing their noses, ran out of sight.        [Illustration]    He stayed in the tree till near morning, and then he was so stiff with cold  that he could scarcely get down. But the warm sun came up, and he felt  better as he sought about for berries and ants, for he was very hungry.  Then he went back to the Piney and put his wounded foot in the ice-cold  water.        [Illustration: \"HE STAYED IN THE TREE TILL NEAR MORNING.\"]    He wanted to get back to the mountains again, but still he felt he must go  to where he had left his Mother and brothers. When the afternoon grew  warm, he went limping down the stream through the timber, and down on the  banks of the Graybull till he came to the place where yesterday they had  had the fish-feast; and he eagerly crunched the heads and remains that he  found. But there was an odd and horrid smell on the wind. It frightened  him, and as he went down to where he last had seen his Mother the smell  grew worse. He peeped out cautiously at the place, and saw there a lot of  Coyotes, tearing at something. What it was he did not know; but he saw no  Mother, and the smell that sickened and terrified him was worse than ever,  so he quietly turned back toward the timber-tangle of the Lower Piney, and  nevermore came back to look for his lost family. He wanted his Mother as  much as ever, but something told him it was no use.    As cold night came down, he missed her more and more again, and he  whimpered as he limped along, a miserable, lonely, little, motherless  Bear--not lost in the mountains, for he had no home to seek, but so sick  and lonely, and with such a pain in his foot and in his stomach a craving  for the drink that would nevermore be his. That night he found a hollow  log, and crawling in, he tried to dream that his Mother's great, furry arms  were around him, and he snuffled himself to sleep.        [Illustration]              III      Wahb had always been a gloomy little Bear; and the string of misfortunes  that came on him just as his mind was forming made him more than ever  sullen and morose.    It seemed as though every one were against him. He tried to keep out of  sight in the upper woods of the Piney, seeking his food by day and resting  at night in the hollow log. But one evening he found it occupied by a  Porcupine as big as himself and as bad as a cactus-bush. Wahb could do  nothing with him. He had to give up the log and seek another nest.        [Illustration]    One day he went down on the Graybull flat to dig some roots that his Mother  had taught him were good. But before he had well begun, a grayish-looking  animal came out of a hole in the ground and rushed at him, hissing and  growling. Wahb did not know it was a Badger, but he saw it was a fierce  animal as big as himself. He was sick, and lame too, so he limped away and  never stopped till he was on a ridge in the next canyon. Here a Coyote saw  him, and came bounding after him, calling at the same time to another to  come and join the fun. Wahb was near a tree, so he scrambled up to the  branches. The Coyotes came bounding and yelping below, but their noses told  them that this was a young Grizzly they had chased, and they soon decided  that a young Grizzly in a tree means a Mother Grizzly not far away, and  they had better let him alone.        [Illustration]    After they had sneaked off Wahb came down and returned to the Piney. There  was better feeding on the Graybull, but every one seemed against him there  now that his loving guardian was gone, while on the Piney he had peace at  least sometimes, and there were plenty of trees that he could climb when an  enemy came.    His broken foot was a long time in healing; indeed, it never got quite  well. The wound healed and the soreness wore off, but it left a stiffness  that gave him a slight limp, and the sole-balls grew together quite unlike  those of the other foot. It particularly annoyed him when he had to climb a  tree or run fast from his enemies; and of them he found no end, though  never once did a friend cross his path. When he lost his Mother he lost his  best and only friend. She would have taught him much that he had to learn  by bitter experience, and would have saved him from most of the ills that  befell him in his cubhood--ills so many and so dire that but for his native  sturdiness he never could have passed through alive.        [Illustration]    The pinons bore plentifully that year, and the winds began to shower down  the ripe, rich nuts. Life was becoming a little easier for Wahb. He was  gaining in health and strength, and the creatures he daily met now let him  alone. But as he feasted on the pinons one morning after a gale, a great  Blackbear came marching down the hill. \"No one meets a friend in the  woods,\" was a byword that Wahb had learned already. He swung up the nearest  tree. At first the Blackbear was scared, for he smelled the smell of  Grizzly; but when he saw it was only a cub, he took courage and came  growling at Wahb. He could climb as well as the little Grizzly, or better,  and high as Wahb went, the Blackbear followed, and when Wahb got out on  the smallest and highest twig that would carry him, the Blackbear cruelly  shook him off, so that he was thrown to the ground, bruised and shaken and  half-stunned. He limped away moaning, and the only thing that kept the  Blackbear from following him up and perhaps killing him was the fear that  the old Grizzly might be about. So Wahb was driven away down the creek from  all the good pinon woods.    There was not much food on the Graybull now. The berries were nearly all  gone; there were no fish or ants to get, and Wahb, hurt, lonely, and  miserable, wandered on and on, till he was away down toward the Meteetsee.

Song of the Ghost Dance--Pai Ute (Kern River, Cal.)          The Beginning of Newness  Zuni (New Mexico)    Before the beginning of the New-making, the All-father Father alone had  being. Through ages there was nothing else except black darkness.    In the beginning of the New-making, the All-father Father thought  outward in space, and mists were created and up-lifted. Thus through his  knowledge he made himself the Sun who was thus created and is the great  Father. The dark spaces brightened with light. The cloud mists thickened  and became water.    From his flesh, the Sun-father created the Seed-stuff of worlds, and he  himself rested upon the waters. And these two, the Four-fold-containing  Earth-mother and the All-covering Sky-father, the surpassing beings,  with power of changing their forms even as smoke changes in the wind,  were the father and mother of the soul beings.    Then as man and woman spoke these two together. \"Behold!\" said  Earth-mother, as a great terraced bowl appeared at hand, and within it  water, \"This shall be the home of my tiny children. On the rim of each  world-country in which they wander, terraced mountains shall stand,  making in one region many mountains by which one country shall be known  from another.\"    Then she spat on the water and struck it and stirred it with her  fingers. Foam gathered about the terraced rim, mounting higher and  higher. Then with her warm breath she blew across the terraces. White  flecks of foam broke away and floated over the water. But the cold  breath of Sky-father shattered the foam and it fell downward in fine  mist and spray.    Then Earth-mother spoke:    \"Even so shall white clouds float up from the great waters at the  borders of the world, and clustering about the mountain terraces of the  horizon, shall be broken and hardened by thy cold. Then will they shed  downward, in rain-spray, the water of life, even into the hollow places  of my lap. For in my lap shall nestle our children, man-kind and  creature-kind, for warmth in thy coldness.\"    So even now the trees on high mountains near the clouds and Sky-father,  crouch low toward Earth mother for warmth and protection. Warm is  Earth-mother, cold our Sky-father.    Then Sky-father said, \"Even so. Yet I, too, will be helpful to our  children.\" Then he spread his hand out with the palm downward and into  all the wrinkles of his hand he set the semblance of shining yellow  corn-grains; in the dark of the early world-dawn they gleamed like  sparks of fire.    \"See,\" he said, pointing to the seven grains between his thumb and four  fingers, \"our children shall be guided by these when the Sun-father is  not near and thy terraces are as darkness itself. Then shall our  children be guided by lights.\" So Sky-father created the stars. Then he  said, \"And even as these grains gleam up from the water, so shall seed  grain like them spring up from the earth when touched by water, to  nourish our children.\" And thus they created the seed-corn. And in many  other ways they devised for their children, the soul-beings.    But the first children, in a cave of the earth, were unfinished. The  cave was of sooty blackness, black as a chimney at night time, and foul.  Loud became their murmurings and lamentations, until many sought to  escape, growing wiser and more man-like.    But the earth was not then as we now see it. Then Sun-father sent down  two sons (sons also of the Foam-cap), the Beloved Twain, Twin Brothers  of Light, yet Elder and Younger, the Right and the Left, like to  question and answer in deciding and doing. To them the Sun-father  imparted his own wisdom. He gave them the great cloud-bow, and for  arrows the thunderbolts of the four quarters. For buckler, they had the  fog-making shield, spun and woven of the floating clouds and spray. The  shield supports its bearer, as clouds are supported by the wind, yet  hides its bearer also. And he gave to them the fathership and control of  men and of all creatures. Then the Beloved Twain, with their great  cloud-bow lifted the Sky-father into the vault of the skies, that the  earth might become warm and fitter for men and creatures. Then along the  sun-seeking trail, they sped to the mountains westward. With magic  knives they spread open the depths of the mountain and uncovered the  cave in which dwelt the unfinished men and creatures. So they dwelt with  men, learning to know them, and seeking to lead them out.    Now there were growing things in the depths, like grasses and vines. So  the Beloved Twain breathed on the stems, growing tall toward the light  as grass is wont to do, making them stronger, and twisting them upward  until they formed a great ladder by which men and creatures ascended to  a second cave.    Up the ladder into the second cave-world, men and the beings crowded,  following closely the Two Little but Mighty Ones. Yet many fell back and  were lost in the darkness. They peopled the under-world from which they  escaped in after time, amid terrible earth shakings.    In this second cave it was as dark as the night of a stormy season, but  larger of space and higher. Here again men and the beings increased, and  their complainings grew loud. So the Twain again increased the growth of  the ladder, and again led men upward, not all at once, but in six bands,  to become the fathers of the six kinds of men, the yellow, the tawny  gray, the red, the white, the black, and the mingled. And this time also  many were lost or left behind.    Now the third great cave was larger and lighter, like a valley in  starlight. And again they increased in number. And again the Two led  them out into a fourth cave. Here it was light like dawning, and men  began to perceive and to learn variously, according to their natures,  wherefore the Twain taught them first to seek the Sun-father.    Then as the last cave became filled and men learned to understand, the  Two led them forth again into the great upper world, which is the World  of Knowing Seeing.          The Men of the Early Times  Zuni (New Mexico)    Eight years was but four days and four nights when the world was new. It  was while such days and nights continued that men were led out, in the  night-shine of the World of Seeing. For even when they saw the great  star, they thought it the Sun-father himself, it so burned their eye-balls.    Men and creatures were more alike then than now. Our fathers were black,  like the caves they came from; their skins were cold and scaly like  those of mud creatures; their eyes were goggled like an owl's; their  ears were like those of cave bats; their feet were webbed like those of  walkers in wet and soft places; they had tails, long or short, as they  were old or young. Men crouched when they walked, or crawled along the  ground like lizards. They feared to walk straight, but crouched as  before time they had in their cave worlds, that they might not stumble  or fall in the uncertain light.    When the morning star arose, they blinked excessively when they beheld  its brightness and cried out that now surely the Father was coming. But  it was only the elder of the Bright Ones, heralding with his shield of  flame the approach of the Sun-father. And when, low down in the east,  the Sun-father himself appeared, though shrouded in the mist of the  world-waters, they were blinded and heated by his light and glory. They  fell down wallowing and covered their eyes with their hands and arms,  yet ever as they looked toward the light, they struggled toward the Sun  as moths and other night creatures seek the light of a camp fire. Thus  they became used to the light. But when they rose and walked straight,  no longer bending, and looked upon each other, they sought to clothe  themselves with girdles and garments of bark and rushes. And when by  walking only upon their hinder feet they were bruised by stone and sand,  they plaited sandals of yucca fibre.          Creation and Longevity  Achomawi (Pit River, Cal.)    Coyote began the creation of the earth, but Eagle completed it. Coyote  scratched it up with his paws out of nothingness, but Eagle complained  there were no mountains for him to perch on. So Coyote made hills, but  they were not high enough. Therefore Eagle scratched up great ridges.  When Eagle flew over them, his feathers dropped down, took root, and  became trees. The pin feathers became bushes and plants.    Coyote and Fox together created man. They quarrelled as to whether they  should let men live always or not. Coyote said, \"If they want to die,  let them die.\" Fox said, \"If they want to come back, let them come  back.\" But Coyote's medicine was stronger, and nobody ever came back.    Coyote also brought fire into the world, for the Indians were freezing.  He journeyed far to the west, to a place where there was fire, stole  some of it, and brought it home in his ears. He kindled a fire in the  mountains, and the Indians saw the smoke of it, and went up and got  fire.          Old Mole's Creation  Shastika (Cal.)    Long, long ago, before there was any earth, Old Mole burrowed underneath  Somewhere, and threw up the earth which forms the world. Then Great Man  created the people. But the Indians were cold.    Now in the cast gleamed the white Fire Stone. Therefore Coyote journeyed  eastward, and brought back the Fire Stone for the Indians. So people had  fire.
