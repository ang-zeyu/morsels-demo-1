They visited every house where a bit  of Aunt Sally's belongings could be found. Very successful they were  too, and at the end of their jaunting the interior of the little house  behind the apple trees looked very much as it had looked when Aunt  Sally and Uncle Tom lived there.    Meanwhile, Mrs. Stetson had been revolving a design in her mind, and  one afternoon she did some canvassing on her own account. The next  time she saw Lovell she said:    \"We ain't going to let you do it all. The women folks around here are  going to furnish the refreshments for the golden wedding and the girls  are going to decorate the house with golden rod.\"    The evening of the wedding anniversary came. Everybody in Blair was in  the plot, including the matron of the poorhouse. That night Aunt Sally  watched the sunset over the hills through bitter tears.    \"I never thought I'd be celebrating my golden wedding in the  poorhouse,\" she sobbed. Uncle Tom put his twisted hand on her shaking  old shoulder, but before he could utter any words of comfort Lovell  Stevens stood before them.    \"Just get your bonnet on, Aunt Sally,\" he cried jovially, \"and both of  you come along with me. I've got a buggy here for you ... and you  might as well say goodbye to this place, for you're not coming back to  it any more.\"    \"Lovell, oh, what do you mean?\" said Aunt Sally tremulously.    \"I'll explain what I mean as we drive along. Hurry up--the folks are  waiting.\"    When they reached the little old house, it was all aglow with light.  Aunt Sally gave a cry as she entered it. All her old household goods  were back in their places. There were some new ones too, for Lovell  had supplied all that was lacking. The house was full of their old  friends and neighbours. Mrs. Stetson welcomed them home again.    \"Oh, Tom,\" whispered Aunt Sally, tears of happiness streaming down her  old face, \"oh, Tom, isn't God good?\"    They had a right royal celebration, and a supper such as the Blair  housewives could produce. There were speeches and songs and tales.  Lovell kept himself in the background and helped Mrs. Stetson cut cake  in the pantry all the evening. But when the guests had gone, he went  to Aunt Sally and Uncle Tom, who were sitting by the fire.    \"Here's a little golden wedding present for you,\" he said awkwardly,  putting a purse into Aunt Sally's hand. \"I reckon there's enough there  to keep you from ever having to go to the poorhouse again and if not,  there'll be more where that comes from when it's done.\"    There were twenty-five bright twenty-dollar gold pieces in the purse.    \"We can't take it, Lovell,\" protested Aunt Sally. \"You can't afford  it.\"    \"Don't you worry about that,\" laughed Lovell. \"Out west men don't  think much of a little wad like that. I owe you far more than can be  paid in cash, Aunt Sally. You must take it--I want to know there's a  little home here for me and two kind hearts in it, no matter where I  roam.\"    \"God bless you, Lovell,\" said Uncle Tom huskily. \"You don't know what  you've done for Sally and me.\"    That night, when Lovell went to the little bedroom off the  parlour--for Aunt Sally, rejoicing in the fact that she was again  mistress of a spare room, would not hear of his going to the station  hotel--he gazed at his reflection in the gilt-framed mirror soberly.    \"You've just got enough left to pay your passage back west, old  fellow,\" he said, \"and then it's begin all over again just where you  begun before. But Aunt Sally's face was worth it all--yes, sir. And  you've got your two hands still and an old couple's prayers and  blessings. Not such a bad capital, Lovell, not such a bad capital.\"          A Redeeming Sacrifice      The dance at Byron Lyall's was in full swing. Toff Leclerc, the best  fiddler in three counties, was enthroned on the kitchen table and from  the glossy brown violin, which his grandfather brought from Grand Pre,  was conjuring music which made even stiff old Aunt Phemy want to show  her steps. Around the kitchen sat a row of young men and women, and  the open sitting-room doorway was crowded with the faces of  non-dancing guests who wanted to watch the sets.    An eight-hand reel had just been danced and the girls, giddy from the  much swinging of the final figure, had been led back to their seats.  Mattie Lyall came out with a dipper of water and sprinkled the floor,  from which a fine dust was rising. Toff's violin purred under his  hands as he waited for the next set to form. The dancers were slow  about it. There was not the rush for the floor that there had been  earlier in the evening, for the supper table was now spread in the  dining-room and most of the guests were hungry.    \"Fill up dere, boys,\" shouted the fiddler impatiently. \"Bring out your  gals for de nex' set.\"    After a moment Paul King led out Joan Shelley from the shadowy corner  where they had been sitting. They had already danced several sets  together; Joan had not danced with anybody else that evening. As they  stood together under the light from the lamp on the shelf above them,  many curious and disapproving eyes watched them. Connor Mitchell, who  had been standing in the open outer doorway with the moonlight behind  him, turned abruptly on his heel and went out.    Paul King leaned his head against the wall and watched the watchers  with a smiling, defiant face as they waited for the set to form. He  was a handsome fellow, with the easy, winning ways that women love.  His hair curled in bronze masses about his head; his dark eyes were  long and drowsy and laughing; there was a swarthy bloom on his round  cheeks; and his lips were as red and beguiling as a girl's. A bad egg  was Paul King, with a bad past and a bad future. He was shiftless and  drunken; ugly tales were told of him. Not a man in Lyall's house that  night but grudged him the privilege of standing up with Joan Shelley.    Joan was a slight, blossom-like girl in white, looking much like the  pale, sweet-scented house rose she wore in her dark hair. Her face was  colourless and young, very pure and softly curved. She had wonderfully  sweet, dark blue eyes, generally dropped down, with notably long black  lashes. There were many showier girls in the groups around her, but  none half so lovely. She made all the rosy-cheeked beauties seem  coarse and over-blown.    She left in Paul's clasp the hand by which he had led her out on the  floor. Now and then he shifted his gaze from the faces before him to  hers. When he did, she always looked up and they exchanged glances as  if they had been utterly alone. Three other couples gradually took the  floor and the reel began. Joan drifted through the figures with the  grace of a wind-blown leaf. Paul danced with rollicking abandon,  seldom taking his eyes from Joan's face. When the last mad whirl was  over, Joan's brother came up and told her in an angry tone to go into  the next room and dance no more, since she would dance with only one  man. Joan looked at Paul. That look meant that she would do as he, and  none other, told her. Paul nodded easily--he did not want any fuss  just then--and the girl went obediently into the room. As she turned  from him, Paul coolly reached out his hand and took the rose from her  hair; then, with a triumphant glance around the room, he went out.    The autumn night was very clear and chill, with a faint, moaning wind  blowing up from the northwest over the sea that lay shimmering before  the door. Out beyond the cove the boats were nodding and curtsying on  the swell, and over the shore fields the great red star of the  lighthouse flared out against the silvery sky. Paul, with a whistle,  sauntered down the sandy lane, thinking of Joan. How mightily he loved  her--he, Paul King, who had made a mock of so many women and had never  loved before! Ah, and she loved him. She had never said so in words,  but eyes and tones had said it--she, Joan Shelley, the pick and pride  of the Harbour girls, whom so many men had wooed, winning their  trouble for their pains. He had won her; she was his and his only, for  the asking. His heart was seething with pride and triumph and passion  as he strode down to the shore and flung himself on the cold sand in  the black shadow of Michael Brown's beached boat.    Byron Lyall, a grizzled, elderly man, half farmer, half fisherman, and  Maxwell Holmes, the Prospect schoolteacher, came up to the boat  presently. Paul lay softly and listened to what they were saying. He  was not troubled by any sense of dishonour. Honour was something Paul  King could not lose since it was something he had never possessed.  They were talking of him and Joan.    \"What a shame that a girl like Joan Shelley should throw herself away  on a man like that,\" Holmes said.    Byron Lyall removed the pipe he was smoking and spat reflectively at  his shadow.    \"Darned shame,\" he agreed. \"That girl's life will be ruined if she  marries him, plum' ruined, and marry him she will. He's bewitched  her--darned if I can understand it. A dozen better men have wanted  her--Connor Mitchell for one. And he's a honest, steady fellow with a  good home to offer her. If King had left her alone, she'd have taken  Connor. She used to like him well enough. But that's all over. She's  infatuated with King, the worthless scamp. She'll marry him and be  sorry for it to her last day. He's bad clear through and always will  be. Why, look you, Teacher, most men pull up a bit when they're  courting a girl, no matter how wild they've been and will be again.  Paul hasn't. It hasn't made any difference. He was dead drunk night  afore last at the Harbour head, and he hasn't done a stroke of work  for a month. And yet Joan Shelley'll take him.\"    \"What are her people thinking of to let her go with him?\" asked  Holmes.    \"She hasn't any but her brother.

COMMERCIAL GEOGRAPHY    CHAPTER I    GENERAL PRINCIPLES      Commerce and modern civilization go hand in hand, and the history of the  one is the history of the other; and whatever may be the basis of  civilization, commerce has been the chief agent by which it has been  spread throughout the world. Peoples who receive nothing from their  fellow-men, and who give nothing in return, are usually but little above  a savage state. Civilized man draws upon all the rest of the world for  what he requires, and gives to the rest of the world in return. He is  civilized because of this fact and not in spite of it.    There is scarcely a country in the world that does not yield something  or other to civilized peoples. There is scarcely a household whose  furnishings and contents do not represent an aggregate journey of  several times around the earth. A family in New York at breakfast occupy  chairs from Grand Rapids, Mich.; they partake of bread made of wheat  from Minnesota, and meat from Texas prepared in a range made in St.  Louis; coffee grown in Sumatra or Java, or tea from China is served in  cups made in Japan, sweetened with sugar from Cuba, stirred with spoons  of silver from Nevada. Spices from Africa, South America, and Asia  season the food, which is served on a table of New Hampshire oak,  covered with a linen spread made from flax grown in Ireland or in  Russia. Rugs from Bokhara, or from Baluchistan, cover the floors;  portieres made in Constantinople hang at the doors; and the room is  heated with coal from Pennsylvania that burns in a furnace made in Rhode  Island.    Now all these things may be, and usually are, found in the great  majority of families in the United States or Europe, and most of them  will be found in nearly all households. Certain it is that peoples do  exist who, from the immediate vicinity in which they live, procure all  the things they use or consume. In the main, however, such peoples are  savages.    A moment's thought will make it clear that before an ordinary meal can  be served there must be railways, steamships, great manufacturing  establishments, iron quarries, and coal mines, aggregating many thousand  millions of dollars, and employing many million people. A casual  inspection, too, reveals the fact that all of the substances and things  required by mankind come from the earth, and, a very few excepted, every  one requires a certain amount of manufacture or preliminary treatment  before it is usable. The grains and nearly all the other food-stuffs  require various processes of preparation before they are ready for  consumption by civilized peoples. Iron and the various other ores used  in the arts must undergo elaborate processes of manufacture; coal must  be mined, broken, cleaned, and transported; the soil in which  food-stuffs are grown must be fertilized and mechanically prepared; and  even the water required for domestic purposes in many instances must be  transported long distances.    [Illustration: AGRICULTURE AND MANUFACTURE SUPPLEMENT EACH OTHER]    A little thought will suffice to show that not only are all food-stuffs  derived from the earth, but that also every usable resource which  constitutes wealth is also drawn from the same source. The same is also  pretty nearly true of the various forms of energy, for although the sun  is the real source of light and heat, and probably of electricity, these  agents are usable only when they have been transformed into earth  energies. Thus, the physical energy generated by falling water is merely  a transformed portion of solar heat; so also the coal-beds contain both  the chemical and physical energy of solar heat and light converted into  potential energy--that is, into force that can be used at the will of  intelligence. Indeed, the physical being of mankind is an organism born  of the earth, and adapted to the earth; and when that physical form  dies, it merely is transformed again to ordinary earth substances.    The chief activities of living beings are those relating to the  maintenance of life. In other words, animals must feed, and they must  also protect themselves against extermination. In the case of all other  animals this is a very simple matter, they simply live in immediate  contact with their food, migrating or perishing if the supply gives out.  In the case of mankind the conditions are different and vastly more  elaborate. Savage peoples excepted, man does not live within close touch  of the things he requires; indeed, he cannot, for he depends upon all  the world for what he uses. In a less enlightened state many of these  commodities were luxuries; in a civilized state they have become  necessities. Moreover, nearly everything civilized man employs has been  prepared by processes in which heat is employed.    Therefore one may specify several classes of human activities and  employments:         (_a_) The production of food-stuffs and other commodities by the       cultivation of the soil--_Agriculture_.         (_b_) The preparation of food-stuffs and things used for shelter,       protection, or ornament--_Manufacture_.         (_c_) The production of minerals for the generation of power, such       as coal, or those such as iron, copper, stone, etc., required in       the arts and sciences--_Mining_.         (_d_) The exchange of food stuffs and commodities--_Commerce_.         (_e_) The transfer of commodities--_Transportation_.    It is evident that the prosperity and happiness of a people depend very  largely on the condition of their surroundings--that is, their  environment. If a country or an inhabited area produces all the  food-stuffs and commodities required by its people, the conditions are  very fortunate. A very few nations, notably China and the United States,  have such diverse conditions of climate, topography, and mineral  resources, that they can, if necessary, produce within their national  borders everything needed by their peoples.    The prosecution of such a policy, however, is rarely economical; in the  history of the past it has always resulted in weakness and  disintegration. China is to-day helpless because of a policy of  self-seclusion; and the marvellous growth of Japan began when her trade  was thrown open to the world.    For the greater part the environment of a people is deficient--that is,  the locality of a people does not yield all that is required for the  necessities of life. For instance, the New England plateau requires an  enormous amount of fuel for its manufacturing enterprises; but  practically no coal is found within its borders; hence the manufacturers  must either command the coal to be shipped from other regions or give up  their employment. The people of Canada require a certain amount of  cotton cloth; but the cotton plant will not grow in a cold climate, so  they must either exchange some of their own commodities for cotton, or  else go without it. The inhabitants of Great Britain produce only a  small part of the food-stuffs they consume; therefore they are  constantly exchanging their manufactured products for the food-stuffs  that of necessity must be produced in other parts of the world.    The dwellers of the New England plateau might grow the bread-stuffs they  require, and in times past they did so. At that time, however, a barrel  of flour was worth twelve dollars. But the wheat of the prairie regions  can be grown, manufactured into flour, transported a thousand miles, and  sold at a profit for less than five dollars a barrel. Therefore it is  evidently more economical to buy flour in Minnesota than to grow the  wheat and make it into flour in Massachusetts.    All these problems, and they exist without number, show that man may  overcome most of the obstacles that surround him. So we find civilized  man living in almost every part of the world. Tropical regions are not  too scorching, nor are arctic fastnesses too cold for him. In other  words, because of commerce and transportation, he can and usually does  master the conditions of his environment; his intelligence enables him  to do so, and his ability to do so is the result of the intelligent use  of experience and education.          CHAPTER II    HOW COMMERCE CIVILIZED MANKIND      The history of western civilization is so closely connected with the  development of the great routes of travel and the growth of commerce  that one cannot possibly separate them. Commerce cannot exist without  the intercourse of peoples, and peoples cannot be in mutual  communication unless each learns from the other.    =Feudalism.=--When the Roman Empire fell civilization in western Europe  was not on a high plane; indeed, the feudalism that followed was not  much above barbarism. The people were living in a manner that was not  very much unlike the communal system under which the serfs of Russia  lived only a few years ago. Each centre of population was a sort of  military camp governed by a feudal lord. The followers and retainers  were scarcely better off than slaves; indeed, many of them were slaves.  There was no ownership of the land except by the feudal lords, and the  latter were responsible for their acts to the king only.    But very few people cared to be absolutely free, because they had but  little chance to protect themselves; so it was the common custom to  attach one's self to a feudal lord in order to have his protection; even  a sort of peonage or slavery under him was better than no protection at  all. A few of the people were engaged in trade and manufacture of some  kind or other, and they were the only ones through whom the feudal lord  could supply himself with the commodities needed for his retainers and  the luxuries necessary to himself."]]]
