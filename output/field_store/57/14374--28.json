After witnessing the awesome blast, Oppenheimer quoted a line from a  sacred Hindu text, the Bhagavad-Gita: He said: \"I am become death, the  shatterer of worlds.\"[6] In Los Alamos 230 miles to the north, a group  of scientists' wives who had stayed up all night for the not so secret  test, saw the light and heard the distant sound. One wife, Jane Wilson,  described it this way, \"Then it came. The blinding light [no] one had  ever seen. The trees, illuminated, leaping out. The mountains flashing  into life. Later, the long slow rumble. Something had happened, all  right, for good or ill.\"[7]    General Groves' deputy commander, Brigadier General T. F. Farrell,  described the explosion in great detail: \"The effects could well  be called unprecedented, magnificent, beautiful, stupendous, and  terrifying. No man-made phenomenon of such tremendous power had ever  occurred before. The lighting effects beggared description. The whole  country was lighted by a searing light with the intensity many times  that of the midday sun. It was golden, purple, violet, gray, and blue.  It lighted every peak, crevasse and ridge of the nearby mountain range  with a clarity and beauty that cannot be described but must be seen to  be imagined...\"[8]    Immediately after the test a Sherman M-4 tank, equipped with its own air  supply, and lined with two inches of lead went out to explore the site.  The lead lining added 12 tons to the tank's weight, but was necessary  to protect its occupants from the radiation levels at ground zero. The  tank's passengers found that the 100-foot steel tower had virtually  disappeared, with only the metal and concrete stumps of its four legs  remaining. Surrounding ground zero was a crater almost 2,400 feet across  and about ten feet deep in places. Desert sand around the tower had been  fused by the intense heat of the blast into a jade colored glass. This  atomic glass was given the name Atomsite, but the name was later changed  to Trinitite.    Due to the intense secrecy surrounding the test, no accurate information  of what happened was released to the public until after the second  atomic bomb had been dropped on Japan. However, many people in New  Mexico were well aware that something extraordinary had happened the  morning of July 16, 1945. The blinding flash of light, followed by the  shock wave had made a vivid impression on people who lived within a  radius of 160 miles of ground zero. Windows were shattered 120 miles  away in Silver City, and residents of Albuquerque saw the bright light  of the explosion on the southern horizon and felt the tremor of the  shock waves moments later.    The true story of the Trinity test first became known to the public on  August 6, 1945. This is when the world's second nuclear bomb, nicknamed  Little Boy, exploded 1,850 feet over Hiroshima, Japan, destroying a  large portion of the city and killing an estimated 70,000 to 130,000  of its inhabitants. Three days later on August 9, a third atomic bomb  devastated the city of Nagasaki and killed approximately 45,000 more  Japanese. The Nagasaki weapon was a plutonium bomb, similar to the  Trinity device, and it was nicknamed Fat Man. On Tuesday August 14, at 7  p.m. Eastern War Time, President Truman made a brief formal announcement  that Japan had finally surrendered and World War II was over after  almost six years and 60 million deaths!    On Sunday, September 9, 1945, Trinity Site was opened to the press  for the first time. This was mainly to dispel rumors of lingering high  radiation levels there, as well as in Hiroshima and Nagasaki. Led  by General Groves and Oppenheimer, this widely publicized visit made  Trinity front page news all over the country.    Trinity Site was later encircled with more than a mile of chain link  fencing and posted with signs warning of radioactivity. In the early  1950s most of the remaining Trinitite in the crater was bulldozed into  a underground concrete bunker near Trinity. Also at this time the crater  was back filled with new soil. In 1963 the Trinitite was removed  from the bunker, packed into 55-gallon drums, and loaded into trucks  belonging to the Atomic Energy Commission (the successor of the  Manhattan Project). Trinity site remained off-limits to military and  civilian personnel of the range and closed to the public for many  years, despite attempts immediately after the war to turn Trinity into a  national monument.    In 1953 about 700 people attended the first Trinity Site open house  sponsored by the Alamogordo Chamber of Commerce and the Missile Range.  Two years later, a small group from Tularosa, NM visited the site on  the 10th anniversary of the explosion to conduct a religious service and  pray for peace.    Regular visits have been made annually in recent years on the first  Saturday in October instead of the anniversary date of July 16, to avoid  the desert heat. Later Trinity Site was opened one additional day on the  first Saturday in April. The Site remains closed to the public except  for these two days, because it lies within the impact areas for missiles  fired into the northern part of the Range.    In 1965, Range officials erected a modest monument at Ground Zero. Built  of black lava rock, this monument serves as a permanent marker for the  site and as a reminder of the momentous event that occurred there.  On the monument is a plain metal plaque with this simple inscription:  \"Trinity Site Where the World's First Nuclear Device Was Exploded on  July 16, 1945.\"    During the annual tour in 1975, a second plaque was added below the  first by The National Park Service, designating Trinity Site a National  Historic Landmark. This plaque reads, \"This site possesses national  significance in commemorating the history of the U.S.A.\"          JUMBO      Lying next to the entrance of the chain link fence that still surrounds  Trinity Site are the rusty remains of Jumbo. Jumbo was the code name for  the 214-ton Thermos shaped steel and concrete container designed to hold  the precious plutonium core of the Trinity device in case of a nuclear  mis-fire. Built by the Babcock and Wilcox Company of Barberton, Ohio,  Jumbo was 28 feet long, 12 feet, 8 inches in diameter, and with steel  walls up to 16 inches thick.    The idea of using some kind of container for the Trinity device was  based on the fact that plutonium was extremely expensive and very  difficult to produce. So, much thought went into a way of containing  the 15 lb. plutonium core of the bomb, in case the 5,300 lbs. of  conventional high explosives surrounding the core exploded without  setting off a nuclear blast, and in the process scattering the costly  plutonium (about 250 million dollars worth) across the dessert. After  extensive research and testing of other potential containment ideas, the  concept of Jumbo was decided on in the late summer of 1944.    However, by the spring of 1945, after Jumbo had already been built and  transported (with great difficulty) to the Trinity Site by the Eichleay  Corporation of Pittsburgh, it was decided not to explode the Trinity  device inside of Jumbo after all. There were several reasons for this  new decision: first, plutonium had become more readily (relatively)  available; second, the Project scientists decided that the Trinity  device would probably work as planned; and last, the scientists realized  that if Jumbo were used it would adversely affect the test results, and  add 214 tons of highly radioactive material to the atmosphere.    Not knowing what else to do with the massive 12 million dollar Jumbo, it  was decided to suspend it from a steel tower 800 yards from Ground  Zero to see how it would withstand the Trinity test. Jumbo survived the  approximately 20 kiloton Trinity blast undamaged, but its supporting  70-foot tall steel tower was flattened.    Two years later, in an attempt to destroy the unused Jumbo before it  and its 12 million dollar cost came to the attention of a congressional  investigating committee, Manhattan Project Director General Groves  ordered two junior officers from the Special Weapons Division at Sandia  Army Base in Albuquerque to test Jumbo. The Army officers placed eight  500-pound conventional bombs in the bottom of Jumbo. Since the bombs  were on the bottom of Jumbo, and not the center (the correct position),  the resultant explosion blew both ends off Jumbo. Unable to totally  destroy Jumbo, the Army then buried it in the desert near Trinity Site.  It was not until the early 1970s that the impressive remains of Jumbo,  still weighing over 180 tons, were moved to their present location.          SCHMIDT-McDONALD RANCH HOUSE      The Schmidt-McDonald ranch house is located two miles south of Ground  Zero. The property encompasses about three acres and consists of the  main house and assorted outbuildings. The house, surrounded by a low  stone wall, was built in 1913 by Franz Schmidt, a German immigrant and  homesteader. In the 1920s Schmidt sold the ranch to George McDonald and  moved to Florida.    The ranch house is a one-story, 1,750 square-foot adobe (mud bricks)  building. An ice house is located on the west side along with an 9'-4\"  deep underground cistern. A 14 by 18.5 foot stone addition, which  included a modern bathroom, was added onto the north side in the 1930s.  East of the house there is a large, divided concrete water storage tank  and a windmill. South of the windmill are the remains of a bunkhouse,  and a barn which also served as a garage. Further to the east are  corrals and holding pens for livestock.    The McDonalds vacated their ranch house and their thousands of acres of  marginal range land in early 1942 when it became part of the Alamogordo  Bombing and Gunnery Range. The old house remained empty until Manhattan  Project personnel arrived in 1945.

You know we've only got brown flour, Ben; I mean to go right over and  ask her now.\"    \"Oh, no, you mustn't,\" cried Ben, catching hold of her arm as she was  preparing to fly off. \"Mammy'll find it out; better wait till to-morrow;  and besides Polly--\" And Ben stopped, unwilling to dampen this  propitious beginning. \"The stove'll act like everything, to-morrow! I  know 'twill; then what'll you do!\"    \"It sha'n't!\" said Polly, running up to look it in the face; \"if it  does, I'll shake it; the mean old thing!\"    The idea of Polly's shaking the lumbering old black affair, sent Ben  into such a peal of laughter that it brought all the other children  running to the spot; and nothing would do but they must one and all, be  told the reason. So Polly and Ben took them into confidence, which  so elated them that half an hour after, when long past her bedtime,  Phronsie declared, \"I'm not going to bed! I want to sit up like Polly!\"    \"Don't tease her,\" whispered Polly to Ben, who thought she ought to go;  so she sat straight up on her little stool, winking like everything to  keep awake.    At last, as Polly was in the midst of one of her liveliest sallies, over  tumbled Phronsie, a sleepy little heap, upon the floor.    \"I want--to go--to bed!\" she said; \"take me--Polly!\"    \"I thought so,\" laughed Polly, and bundled her off into the bedroom.          MAKING HAPPINESS FOR MAMSIE      And so, the minute her mother had departed for the minister's house next  morning, and Ben had gone to his day's work, chopping wood for Deacon  Blodgett, Polly assembled her force around the old stove, and proceeded  to business. She and the children had been up betimes that morning to  get through with the work; and now, as they glanced around with a look  of pride on the neatly swept floor, the dishes all done, and everything  in order, the moment their mother's back was turned they began to  implore Polly to hurry and begin.    \"It's most 'leven o'clock,\" said Joel, who, having no work to do  outside, that day, was prancing around, wild to help along the  festivities; \"it's most 'leven o'clock, Polly Pepper! you won't have it  done.\"    \"Oh, no; 'tisn't either, Joe;\" said Polly, with a very flushed face, and  her arms full of kindlings, glancing up at the old clock as she spoke;  \"tisn't but quarter of nine; there, take care, Phronsie! you can't lift  off the cover; do help her, Davie.\"    \"No; let me!\" cried Joel, springing forward; \"it's my turn; Dave got the  shingles; it's my turn, Polly.\"    \"So 'tis,\" said Polly; \"I forgot; there,\" as she flung in the wood,  and poked it all up in a nice little heap coaxingly. \"It can't help but  burn; what a cake we'll have for mamsie!\"    \"It'll be so big,\" cried Phronsie, hopping around on one set of toes,  \"that mamsie won't know what to do, will she, Polly?\"    \"No, I don't believe she will,\" said Polly, gayly, stuffing in more  wood; \"Oh, dear! there goes Ben's putty; it's all come out!\"    \"So it has,\" said Joel, going around back of the stove to explore; and  then he added cheerfully, \"it's bigger'n ever; oh! it's an awful big  hole, Polly!\"    \"Now, whatever shall we do!\" said Polly, in great distress; \"that  hateful old crack! and Ben's clear off to Deacon Blodgett's!\"    \"I'll run and get him,\" cried Joel, briskly; \"I'll bring him right home  in ten minutes.\"    \"Oh, no, you must not, Joe,\" cried Polly in alarm; \"it wouldn't ever be  right to take him off from his work; mamsie wouldn't like it.\"    \"What will you do, then?\" asked Joel, pausing on his way to the door.    \"I'm sure I don't know,\" said Polly, getting down on her knees to  examine the crack; \"I shall have to stuff it with paper, I s'pose.\"    \"'Twon't stay in,\" said Joel, scornfully; \"don't you know you stuffed it  before, last week?\"    \"I know,\" said Polly, with a small sigh; and sitting down on the floor,  she remained quite still for a minute, with her two black hands thrust  out straight before her.    \"Can't you fix it?\" asked Davie, soberly, coming up; \"then we can't have  the cake.\"    \"Dear me!\" exclaimed Polly, springing up quickly; \"don't be afraid;  we're going to have that cake! There, you ugly old thing, you!\" (this  to the stove) \"see what you've done!\" as two big tears flew out of  Phronsie's brown eyes at the direful prospect; and the sorrowful faces  of the two boys looked up into Polly's own, for comfort. \"I can fix it,  I most know; do get some paper, Joe, as quick as you can.\"    \"Don't know where there is any,\" said Joel, rummaging around; \"it's all  tore up; 'xcept the almanac; can't I take that?\"    \"Oh dear, no!\" cried Polly; \"put it right back, Joe; I guess there's  some in the wood-shed.\"    \"There isn't either,\" said little Davie, quickly; \"Joel and I took it to  make kites with.\"    \"Oh dear,\" groaned Polly; \"I don't know what we shall do; unless,\" as a  bright thought struck her, \"you let me have the kites, boys.\"    \"Can't,\" said Joel; \"they're all flew away; and torn up.\"    \"Well, now, children,\" said Polly, turning round impressively upon them,  the effect of which was heightened by the extremely crocky appearance  she had gained in her explorations, \"we must have some paper, or  something to stop up that old hole with--some way, there!\"    \"I know,\" said little Davie, \"where we'll get it; it's upstairs;\" and  without another word he flew out of the room, and in another minute he  put into Polly's hand an old leather boot-top, one of his most treasured  possessions. \"You can chip it,\" he said, \"real fine, and then 'twill go  in.\"    \"So we can,\" said Polly; \"and you're a real good boy, Davie, to give it;  that's a splendid present to help celebrate for mamsie!\"    \"I'd a-given a boot-top,\" said Joel, looking grimly at the precious bit  of leather which Polly was rapidly stripping into little bits, \"if I'd  a-hed it; I don't have anything!\"    \"I know you would, Joey,\" said Polly, kindly; \"there now, you'll stay,  I guess!\" as with the united efforts of the two boys, cheered on by  Phronsie's enthusiastic little crow of delight, the leather was crowded  into place, and the fire began to burn.    \"Now, boys,\" said Polly, getting up, and drawing a long breath, \"I'm  going over to Grandma Bascom's to get her to tell me how to make the  cake; and you must stay and keep house.\"    \"I'm going to nail,\" said Joel; \"I've got lots to do.\"    \"All right,\" said Polly, tying on her hood; \"Phronsie'll love to watch  you; I won't be gone long,\" and she was off.    \"Grandma Bascom,\" wasn't really the children's grandmother; only  everybody in the village called her so by courtesy. Her cottage was over  across the lane, and just a bit around the corner; and Polly flew along  and up to the door, fully knowing that now she would be helped out of  her difficulty. She didn't stop to knock, as the old lady was so deaf  she knew she wouldn't hear her, but opened the door and walked in.  Grandma was sweeping up the floor, already as neat as a pin; when she  saw Polly coming, she stopped, and leaned on her broom.    \"How's your ma?\" she asked, when Polly had said \"good morning,\" and then  hesitated.    \"Oh, mammy's pretty well,\" shouted Polly into the old lady's ear; \"and  to-morrow's her birthday!\"    \"To-morrow'll be a bad day!\" said grandma. \"Oh, don't never say that.  You mustn't borrow trouble, child.\"    \"I didn't,\" said Polly; \"I mean--it's her birthday, grandma!\" this last  so loud that grandma's cap-border vibrated perceptibly.    \"The land's sakes 'tis!\" cried Mrs. Bascom, delightedly; \"you don't say  so!\"    \"Yes,\" said Polly, skipping around the old lady, and giving her a small  hug; \"and we're going to give her a surprise.\"    \"What is the matter with her eyes?\" asked grandma, sharply, turning  around and facing her; \"she's been a-sewin' too stiddy, hain't she?\"    \"A surprise!\" shouted Polly, standing upon tiptoe, to bring her mouth on  a"]]]
