In the spring or summer you can feed more green stuff than in the  winter, in fact, we have raised them in the summer on an exclusive green  food diet by moving the hutches from place to place on the lawn. But in  the winter and fall, when greens are scarce and they are not used to  them, a sudden over-feeding might result in severe loss. Avoid a sudden  change of diet.    In the spring and summer there is but little food to buy for them. Even  the city raiser, by saving his own and his neighbors' lawn clippings,  can be well supplied. By curing these clippings a good grade of hay is  obtained. A little grain, especially for the pregnant mothers, is all  that need be bought.    Bread and milk is a good flesh producer and should be fed any weak ones,  also nursing mothers. In the winter it should be warmed.    The feeding of Cavies, you see, is a very simple matter, even for a city  man. The commission houses every day throw away enough lettuce, cabbage,  celery, etc., to feed a large number. Stale bread can always be bought  very cheaply from the bakeries. On the farm nothing whatever need be  bought at any time.      Doubtful Foods.    Breeders differ so as to doubtful foods that it is hard to advise what  not to use. We get good results from alfalfa, but some breeders say it  is too rich and gives them kidney trouble. We feed alfalfa hay in the  winter with good results, but have had but little experience with it  green. We would advise you to go light on it, however. Many breeders  feed cabbage, while others say not. All are agreed, however, that  potatoes, white turnips and parsnips are to be avoided. Of course, meat  or greasy food must not be fed.          CHAPTER V    HOUSING.      Guinea Pigs do not require either large or elaborate quarters and the  average man or boy can easily prepare a suitable place for them. There  are two methods of housing usually used, namely, hutches and pens.      Hutches.    Among breeders generally the hutch method is preferred. They occupy  less room, are easier to keep warm in the winter, and are easier  handled. We illustrate several types. Fig. 1 and Fig. 2 are the kind  used by the U. S. Department of Agriculture in the Bureau of Animal  Industry. They are about 20 inches wide, 3-1/2 feet deep and 18 inches  high. They will accommodate a male and three or four females and young  ones until weaned.    [Illustration: Figures 1 and 2. Front and Rear Views of Government Type  of Hutch.]    The door covers nearly the whole front and is made of wire netting. In  the back is a screened opening for ventilation. Each hutch should have a  shelf about four inches high in the back as they like to get on and  under it. These hutches are made to stack one on another to utilize  small space and are kept indoors.    Fig. 3 shows a type of hutch that can be built against the side of the  wall. It is not best to have the wall of the house serve as the back of  the hutch, it might be too cold. These can be built in tiers of three,  each tier about 18 inches or two feet high. The size of each hutch can  vary, depending on the number of Guinea Pigs you have. The entire front  should be of wire with large doors so as to allow ventilation and to be  easily cleaned. In the winter a small box can be put in each one for  sleeping quarters and this box kept full of straw.      Pens.    Some breeders prefer pens and the pen system does have some advantages.  In the first place, it gives the animals more room, has to be cleaned  out less frequently and is more economical.    If you have a suitable place for making pens it will be all right to use  them. Of course, it is harder to protect them from cats, rats and dogs  in pens, and it is also harder to keep them warm in winter. In summer  the pens are really to be preferred. If you have space in a barn, wood  shed, attic, basement or any place that is protected from wind and rain  and cats, rats and dogs, you can easily fix up a place for them. A place  six by ten feet will accommodate from 30 to 50 Guinea Pigs. Your space  should be divided into several different pens with 12 to 18 inch board  or wire netting. Guinea Pigs do not burrow, so a board floor is not  necessary. The floor should be covered with litter of some sort. Saw  dust is good for a bottom layer. Hay or straw can be put on the saw  dust. In the winter, if the place is not heated, boxes with a small hole  for them to run in and out of and which should be filled with hay or  straw, should be supplied for sleeping quarters.    Heat in the winter is not considered necessary by many very successful  breeders, but we think it best they should have some protection,  especially in very bitter weather, and the warmer you can keep them the  better. They thrive better when the temperature does not fall below  freezing. If given well protected, tight quarters with plenty of bedding  they will get by all right without heat. However, the females that are  about to litter should be kept in a warm place, as the little ones will  freeze if the weather is very cold. After they get about a month old,  you can, during a warm spell, move them out with the others. One of the  most successful breeders in the West, whose stock brings fancy prices,  opposes artificial heat and says they are better without it. Other  breeders use oil stoves in the severe weather and some of the largest  Caviaries have elaborate heating arrangements.      Out Door Hutches.    In the summer you can build a pen of wire netting for them to run in  with a small tight box for sleeping quarters and protection from storm.  Use small mesh chicken wire for the sides. The top can be of netting or  boards. The size of the pen will of course depend on how many Cavies you  have. These pens can be moved from place to place on the lawn, giving  them good green grass. Very little other food then will be required.      General Instructions.    Give your stock all the room you can spare. Do not see how little room  you can use, if you have room to waste. Be sure that they have  ventilation, even in the winter. Animals, like humans, need fresh air.  See that your hutches are kept clean and dry. Do not let your Cavies get  wet. There is no need to build expensive and elaborate hutches,  especially at the start. When you get a larger herd you can decide on  some uniform style of hutch or pen and make them all alike. This makes  them easy to handle and enlarge. Local conditions and circumstances will  determine how you will keep your Cavies.    [Illustration: Fig. 3. Practical Type of Indoor Hutch.]          CHAPTER VI    BREEDING.      Guinea Pigs are very prolific, having about five litters a year, and  from two to five at a litter. Three is a safe average.    The females are sexually mature at a month, but, of course, should not  be bred at that age. Three months is plenty early enough and some  breeders wait until they are even older.    The period of gestation is from 65 to 70 days. The young ones are fully  developed when born and in a few hours are able to run around. They  begin eating other food in a day or two.    They should be weaned when about three weeks old and placed in separate  pens, separating the young males from the females. It is then well to  let the mother rest two or three weeks before being placed in the  breeding pen again.    It is best to let each female have not over four litters a year. The  young ones are apt to be stronger and there will be more of them in a  litter. You will get about as many of them per year with four litters as  with five and have better stock. Some breeders, especially for show  stock, get only three litters a year.    When your young females are about four months old, they should be placed  in the breeding pen. Best results and surer are obtained by keeping one  male with four or five females and letting them stay together until you  are sure each female is bred. They begin to show that they are with  young in about 30 days or sooner and get to be very large before giving  birth.    It is best to have several females with young together in the same pen,  as they will nurse each other's young indiscriminately and the little  fellows seem to know no difference. While the males do not kill the  little ones, still they should never be left in the pen with nursing  mothers, as they will bother them.    Many breeders do not have special breeding pens, but keep all of the  females together and put males in with them. This is hardly the best  plan, however. The females must not be allowed to litter in the big pen,  but always in special pens or hutches.    It is best to have different breeding pens or hutches, so you can get  young stock that is unrelated. You will have many chances to sell  breeding stock and it does not do to supply males and females that are  full brother and sister. By using care you can so breed your stock that  you can keep different batches of them that are not very closely  related.      Line Breeding.    By line breeding, we mean breeding the same stock without getting new  males. It is the method used by breeders of fancy stock to get any  special color or marking. It is not inbreeding in the true sense of the  word.    In line breeding you breed the father to his daughter and the son to his  mother. This arrangement is all right and gets splendid results. You  must avoid, however, breeding full brothers and sisters. It is also well  to breed pigs that are similar in color and marking. For instance: Breed  whites with whites and blacks with blacks, etc. By line breeding you can  get almost any color you want. If you wanted to get solid red, say, out  of a mixed lot, you should breed your reddest male to your reddest  female. Then breed the father to his reddest daughter and the reddest  son to his mother. Continue in this way and eventually you will get  solid reds.

I cannot help  laughing to myself when they talk to me: they know that  their villainy is well known, but that does not bother them.    I have many good friends among the Italians who warn me not  to eat and drink with their painters, for many of them are  my enemies and copy my work in the churches and wherever  they can find it; afterwards they criticize it and claim  that it is not done in the antique style and say it is no  good, but Giambellin (Giovanni Bellini) has praised me  highly to many gentlemen. He would willingly have something  of mine, and came himself to me and asked me to do something  for him, and said that he would pay well for it, and  everyone tells me what an upright man he is, so that I am  really friendly with him. He is very old and yet he is the  best painter of all.    [Editor's note: The character of Bellini agrees with all we  know of him. Camerarius tells an amusing story of the two  artists, to the effect that Bellini once asked Dürer for one  of the brushes with which he painted hairs. Dürer produced  several quite ordinary brushes and offered them to Bellini.  Bellini replied that he did not mean those, but some brush  with the hairs divided which would enable him to draw a  number of fine parallel lines such as Dürer did. Dürer  assured him that he used no special kind, and proceeded to  draw a number of long wavy lines like tresses with such  absolute regularity and parallelism that Bellini declared  that nothing but seeing it done would have convinced him  that such a feat of skill was possible.]    And the thing which pleased me so well eleven years ago  pleases me no longer, and if I had not seen it myself, I  would not have believed anyone who told me. And you must  know too that there are many better painters here than  Master Jacob (Jacopo de Barbari), though Antonio Kolb would  take an oath that there was no better painter on earth than  Jacob. Others sneer at him and say if he were any good, he  would stay here. I have only today begun the sketch of my  picture, for my hands are so scabby that I could not work,  but I have cured them.    And now be lenient with me and do not get angry so quickly,  but be gentile like me. You will not learn from me, I do not  know why. My dear, I should like to know whether any of your  loves is dead--that one close by the water, for instance, or  the one like [drawing of a flower] or [drawing of a brush]  or [drawing of a running dog]'s girl so that you might get  another in her stead.    Given at Venice at the ninth hour of the night on Saturday  after Candlemas in the year 1506.  [Editor's note: Reckoning  from sunset, at this season [this] would be about 2:30 a.m.]  Give my service to Stephen Paumgartner and to Masters Hans  Harsdorfer and Volkamer.    --Albrecht Dürer        28th February, 1506    First my willing service to you, dear Herr Pirkheimer. If  things go well with you, then I am indeed glad. Know, too,  that by the grace of God I am doing well and working fast.  Still I do not expect to have finished before Whitsuntide.  I have sold all my pictures except one. For two I got 24  ducats, and the other three I gave for these three rings,  which were valued in the exchange as worth 24 ducats, but I  have shown them to some good friends and they say they are  only worth 22, and as you wrote to me to buy you some  jewels, I thought that I would send you the rings by Franz  Imhof. Show them to people who understand them, and if you  like them, keep them for what they are worth. In case you do  not want them, send them back by the next messenger, for  here at Venice a man who helped to make the exchange will  give me 12 ducats for the emerald and 10 ducats for the ruby  and diamond, so that I need not lose more than 2 ducats.    I wish you had occasion to come here, I know the time would  pass quickly, for there are so many nice men here, real  artists. And I have such a crowd of foreigners (Italians)  about me that I am forced sometimes to shut myself up, and  the gentlemen all wish me well, but few of the painters.    Dear Master, Andreas Kunhofer sends you his service and  means to write to you by the next courier. Herewith let me  be commended to you, and I also commend my mother to you. I  am wondering greatly why she has not written to me for so  long, and as for my wife, I begin to think that I have lost  her, and I am surprised too that you do not write to me, but  I have read the letter which you wrote to Sebastian Imhof  about me. Please give the two enclosed letters to my mother,  and have patience, I pray, till God brings me home, when I  will honourably repay you. My greetings to Stephen  Pirkheimer and other good friends, and let me know if any of  your loves are dead. Read this according to the sense: I am  hurried.    Given in Venice, the Sunday before Whitsunday, the year  1506.    --Albrecht Dürer    [p.s.] Tomorrow it is good to confess.        8th March, 1506    First my willing service to you, dear Herr Pirkheimer. I  send you herewith a ring with a sapphire about which you  wrote so urgently. I could not send it sooner, for the past  two days I have been running around to all the German and  Italian goldsmiths that are in all Venice with a good  assistant whom I hired: and we made comparisons, but were  unable to match this one at the price, and only after much  entreaty could I get it for 18 ducats 4 marcelli from a man  who was wearing it on his own hand and who let me have it as  a favour, as I gave him to understand that I wanted it for  myself. And as soon as I had bought it a German goldsmith  wanted to give me 3 ducats more for it than I paid, so I  hope that you will like it. Everybody says that it is a good  stone, and that in Germany it would be worth about 50  florins; however, you will know whether they tell truth or  lies. I understand nothing about it. I had first of all  bought an amethyst for 12 ducats from a man whom I thought  was a good friend, but he deceived me, for it was not worth  7; but the matter was arranged between us by some good  fellows: I will give him back the stone and make him a  present of a dish of fish. I was glad to do so and took my  money back quickly. As my good friend values the ring, the  stone is not worth much more than 10 Rhenish florins, whilst  the gold of the ring weighs about up to 5 florins, so that I  have not gone beyond the limit set me, as you wrote \"from 15  to 20 florins.\" But the other stone I have not yet been able  to buy, for 10 one finds them rarely in pairs; but I will do  all I can about it. They say here that such trumpery fool's  work is to be had cheaper in Germany, especially now at the  Frankfurt Fair. For the Italians take such stuff abroad, and  they laugh at me, especially about the jacinth cross, when I  speak of 2 ducats, so write quickly and tell me what I am to  do. I have heard of a good diamond ornament in a certain  place, but I do not yet know what it will cost. I shall buy  it for you until you write again, for emeralds are as dear  as anything I have seen in all my days. It is easy enough  for anyone to get a small amethyst if he thinks it worth 20  or 25 ducats.    It really seems to me you must have taken a mistress; only  beware you don't get a master.  But you are wise enough  about your own affairs.    Dear Pirkheimer, Andreas Kunhofer sends you his service. He  intends in the meantime to write to you, and he prays you if  necessary to explain for him to the Council why he does not  stay at Padua; he says there is nothing there for him to  learn. Don't be angry I pray you with me for not sending all  the stones on this occasion, for I could not get them all  ready. My friends tell me that you should have the stone set  with a new foil and it will look twice as good again, for  the ring is old, and the foil spoiled. And I beg you too to  tell my mother to write me soon and have good care of  herself. Herewith I commend myself to you.    Given at Venice on the second Sunday in Lent, 1506.    --Albrecht Dürer    [p.s.] Greetings to your loves.        2nd April, 1506    First my willing service to you, dear  Sir.    I received a letter from you on the Thursday before Palm  Sunday, together with the emerald ring, and went immediately  to the man from whom I got the rings. He will give me back  my money for it, although it is a thing that he does not  like to do; however, he has given me his word and he must  hold to that. Do you know that the jewelers buy emeralds  abroad and sell them here at a profit? But my friends tell  me that the other two rings are well worth 6 ducats apiece,  for they say that they are fine and clear and contain no  flaws. And they say that instead of taking them to the  valuer you should enquire for such rings as they can show  you and then compare them and see whether they are like  them; and if when I got them by exchange I had been willing  to lose 2 ducats on the three rings, Bernard Holzbeck, who  was present at the transaction, would have bought them of  me. I have since sent you a sapphire ring by Franz Imhof, I  hope it has reached you. I think I made a good bargain at  that place, for they offered to buy it of me at a profit on  the spot. But I shall find out from you, for you know that I  understand nothing about such things and am forced to trust  those who advise me.    The painters here you must know are very unfriendly to me.  They have summoned me three times before the magistrates,  and I have had to pay 4 florins to their School. You must  know too that I might have gained much money if I had not  undertaken to make the painting for the Germans, for there  is a great deal of work in it and I cannot well finish it  before Whitsuntide; yet they only pay me 85 ducats for it.  [Editor's note: Bellini at this time received 100 ducats for  a large picture].  That, you know, will go in living"]]]
