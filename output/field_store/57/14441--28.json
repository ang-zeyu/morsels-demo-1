No more talking--just baby  squalls.\"    \"And thirty little assassins will go into thirty homes,\" Lorry said.  \"All dressed in soft pink and blue, all filled with hatred. Waiting,  biding their time, growing more clever.\" She shuddered.    \"The electric chair will get them all, eventually.\"    \"But how many will they get in the meantime?\"    Pete put his arms around her and drew her close and whispered into her  ear. \"There's nothing we can do--nothing.\"    \"We've got to do something.\" Lorry heard again the thin, brittle  laughter following her, taunting her.    \"It was a bad dream. It didn't happen. We'll just have to sleep it off.\"    She put her cheek against his. The rising stubble of his beard scratched  her face. She was grateful for the rough touch of solid reality.    Pete said, \"The shock will wear out of our minds. Time will pass. After  a while, we won't believe it ourselves.\"    \"That's what I'm afraid of.\"    \"It's got to be that way.\"    \"We've got to do something.\"    Pete lowered his arm wearily. \"Yeah--we've got to do something. Where  there's nothing that can be done. What are we--miracle workers?\"    \"We've got to do something.\"    \"Sure--finish out the watch and then get some sleep.\"           *       *       *       *       *    Lorry awoke with the lowering sun in her window. It was a blood red sun.  She picked up the phone by her bedside. \"Room 307 Resident's extension.\"    Pete answered drowsily. Lorry said, \"Tell me--did I dream, or did it  really happen.\"    \"I was going to ask you the same thing. I guess it happened. What are  you doing?\"    \"Lying in bed.\"    \"So am I. But two different beds. Things are done all wrong.\"    \"Want to take a chance and sneak over? I've got an illegal coffee pot.\"    \"Leave the door unlocked.\"    Lorry put on the coffee. She showered and got into her slip. She was  brushing her hair when Pete came in. He looked at her and extended  beckoning, clutching fingers. \"The hell with phantoms. Come here.\"    After a couple of minutes, Lorry pulled away and poured the coffee. She  reached for her uniform. Pete said, \"Don't put it on yet.\"    \"Too dangerous--leaving it off.\"    He eyed her dreamily. \"I'll dredge up will power. I'll also get scads of  fat rich clients. Then we'll get married so I can assault you legally.\"    Lorry studied him. \"You're not even listening to yourself. What is it,  Pete? What have you dreamed up?\"    \"Okay. I've got an idea. You said something would have to be done.\"    \"What?\"    \"A drastic cure for a drastic case. With maybe disaster as the end  product.\"    \"Tell me.\"    \"I'll tell you a little, but not too much.\"    \"Why not all?\"    \"Because if we ever land in court. I want you to be able to say under  oath, 'He didn't tell me what he planned to do.'\"    \"I don't like that.\"    \"I don't care if you like it or not. Tell me, what's the one basic thing  that stands out in your mind about these--entities?\"    \"That they're ...\"    \"Fragile?\"    \"Yes--fragile.\"    \"Give me some more coffee.\"           *       *       *       *       *    Lorry demanded to know what was in Pete's mind. All she got was kissed,  and she did not see Pete again until eleven o'clock that night. He found  her in the corridor in Maternity and motioned her toward the nursery. He  carried a tray under a white towel. He said, \"You watch the door. I'm  going inside. I'll be about a half an hour.\"    \"What are you going to do?\"    \"You stay out here and mind your business. Your business will be to  steer any nosey party away. If you can't, make noise coming in.\"    Doc Pete turned away and entered the nursery. Lorry stood at the  doorway, in the silence, under the brooding night-light, and prayed.    Twenty-five minutes later, Pete came out. His face was white and drawn.  He looked like a man who had lately had a preview of Hell's inverted  pleasures. His hands trembled. The towel still covered the tray. He  said, \"Watch them close. Don't move ten steps from here.\" He started  away--turned back. \"All hell is scheduled to break loose in this  hospital shortly. Let's hope God remains in charge.\"    Lorry saw the sick dread of his heart underneath his words.           *       *       *       *       *    It could have been a major scandal. An epidemic of measles on the  maternity floor of a modern hospital indicates the unforgivable medical  sin--carelessness. It was hushed up as much as possible, pending the  time when the top people could shake off the shock and recover their  wits. The ultimate recovery of thirty babies was a tribute to everyone  concerned.    Wan, done-in, Doc Pete drank coffee in Lorry's room. Lorry gave him  three lumps of sugar and said, \"But are you sure the sickness killed the  entities?\"    \"Quite sure. Somehow they _knew_ when I made the injections. They  screamed. They knew they were done for.\"    \"It took courage. Tell me: why are you so strong, so brave? Why are you  so wonderful?\"    \"Cut it out. I was scared stiff. If _one_ baby had died, I'd have gone  through life weighing the cure against the end. It isn't easy to risk  doing murder--however urgent the need.\"    She leaned across and kissed him. \"And you were all alone. You wouldn't  let me help. Was that fair?\"    He grinned, then sobered. \"But I can't help remembering what that--that  invisible monster said: '_Never before has a whole swarm gotten through.  Only a single entity on rare occasions._'    \"I can't help wondering what happens to those single entities. I think  of the newspaper headlines I've seen: Child Kills Parents in Sleep.  Youth Slays Father. I'll probably always wonder--and I'll always  remember....\"    Lorry got up and crossed to him and put her arms around him. \"Not  always,\" she whispered. \"There will be times when I'll make you forget.  For a little while, anyhow.\"      THE END          Transcriber's Note:        This etext was produced from _If Worlds of Science Fiction_ November      1953.

Even recovering  from starvation as I am, I can feel in myself an energy they do not  have. The savage in me and my race is a creative thing, for in those who  have been educated as I was it is a controlled savagery which attacks  and destroys only problems and obstacles, never people. Any human raised  outside of the political traditions that the race inherited from its  bloodstained childhood would be as friendly and ready for friendship as  I am toward these beings. I could never hurt these pleasant, overgrown  bunnies and squirrels.    \"We will do everything we can to make up for ... we will try to help,\"  says the bunny, stumbling over the English, but civilized and cordial  and kind.    I sit up suddenly, reaching out impulsively to shake his hand. Suddenly  frightened he leaps back. All of them step back, glancing behind them as  though making sure of the avenue of escape. Their big luminous eyes  widen and glance rapidly from me to the doors, frightened.    They must think I am about to leap out of bed and pounce on them and eat  them. I am about to laugh and reassure them, about to say that all I  want from them is friendship, when I feel a twinge in my abdomen from  the sudden motion. I touch it with one hand under the bedclothes.    There is the scar of an incision there, almost healed. An operation. The  weakness I am recovering from is more than the weakness of starvation.    For only half a second I do not understand; then I see why they looked  ashamed.    They voted the murder of a race.    All the human survivors found have been made sterile. There will be no  more humans after we die.    I am frozen, one hand still extended to grasp the hand of the rabbity  one, my eyes still searching his expression, reassuring words still half  formed.    There will be time for anger or grief later, for now, in this instant, I  can understand. They are probably quite right.    We were carnivores.    I know, because, at this moment of hatred, I could kill them all.                                                            --G. A.
