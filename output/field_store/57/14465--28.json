THE science thus committed to his charge, to be cultivated,  methodized, and explained in a course of academical lectures, is that  of the laws and constitution of our own country: a species of  knowlege, in which the gentlemen of England have been more remarkably  deficient than those of all Europe besides. In most of the nations on  the continent, where the civil or imperial law under different  modifications is closely interwoven with the municipal laws of the  land, no gentleman, or at least no scholar, thinks his education is  completed, till he has attended a course or two of lectures, both upon  the institutes of Justinian and the local constitutions of his native  soil, under the very eminent professors that abound in their several  universities. And in the northern parts of our own island, where also  the municipal laws are frequently connected with the civil, it is  difficult to meet with a person of liberal education, who is destitute  of a competent knowlege in that science, which is to be the guardian  of his natural rights and the rule of his civil conduct.    NOR have the imperial laws been totally neglected even in the English  nation. A general acquaintance with their decisions has ever been  deservedly considered as no small accomplishment of a gentleman; and a  fashion has prevailed, especially of late, to transport the growing  hopes of this island to foreign universities, in Switzerland, Germany,  and Holland; which, though infinitely inferior to our own in every  other consideration, have been looked upon as better nurseries of the  civil, or (which is nearly the same) of their own municipal law. In  the mean time it has been the peculiar lot of our admirable system of  laws, to be neglected, and even unknown, by all but one practical  profession; though built upon the soundest foundations, and approved  by the experience of ages.    FAR be it from me to derogate from the study of the civil law,  considered (apart from any binding authority) as a collection of  written reason. No man is more thoroughly persuaded of the general  excellence of it's rules, and the usual equity of it's decisions; nor  is better convinced of it's use as well as ornament to the scholar,  the divine, the statesman, and even the common lawyer. But we must not  carry our veneration so far as to sacrifice our Alfred and Edward to  the manes of Theodosius and Justinian: we must not prefer the edict of  the praetor, or the rescript of the Roman emperor, to our own  immemorial customs, or the sanctions of an English parliament; unless  we can also prefer the despotic monarchy of Rome and Byzantium, for  whose meridians the former were calculated, to the free constitution  of Britain, which the latter are adapted to perpetuate.    WITHOUT detracting therefore from the real merit which abounds in the  imperial law, I hope I may have leave to assert, that if an Englishman  must be ignorant of either the one or the other, he had better be a  stranger to the Roman than the English institutions. For I think it an  undeniable position, that a competent knowlege of the laws of that  society, in which we live, is the proper accomplishment of every  gentleman and scholar; an highly useful, I had almost said essential,  part of liberal and polite education. And in this I am warranted by  the example of antient Rome; where, as Cicero informs us[a], the very  boys were obliged to learn the twelve tables by heart, as a _carmen  necessarium_ or indispensable lesson, to imprint on their tender minds  an early knowlege of the laws and constitutions of their country.    [Footnote a: _De Legg._ 2. 23.]    BUT as the long and universal neglect of this study, with us in  England, seems in some degree to call in question the truth of this  evident position, it shall therefore be the business of this  introductory discourse, in the first place to demonstrate the utility  of some general acquaintance with the municipal law of the land, by  pointing out its particular uses in all considerable situations of  life. Some conjectures will then be offered with regard to the causes  of neglecting this useful study: to which will be subjoined a few  reflexions on the peculiar propriety of reviving it in our own  universities.    AND, first, to demonstrate the utility of some acquaintance with the  laws of the land, let us only reflect a moment on the singular frame  and polity of that land, which is governed by this system of laws. A  land, perhaps the only one in the universe, in which political or  civil liberty is the very end and scope of the constitution[b]. This  liberty, rightly understood, consists in the power of doing whatever  the laws permit[c]; which is only to be effected by a general  conformity of all orders and degrees to those equitable rules of  action, by which the meanest individual is protected from the insults  and oppression of the greatest. As therefore every subject is  interested in the preservation of the laws, it is incumbent upon every  man to be acquainted with those at least, with which he is immediately  concerned; lest he incur the censure, as well as inconvenience, of  living in society without knowing the obligations which it lays him  under. And thus much may suffice for persons of inferior condition,  who have neither time nor capacity to enlarge their views beyond that  contracted sphere in which they are appointed to move. But those, on  whom nature and fortune have bestowed more abilities and greater  leisure, cannot be so easily excused. These advantages are given them,  not for the benefit of themselves only, but also of the public: and  yet they cannot, in any scene of life, discharge properly their duty  either to the public or themselves, without some degree of knowlege in  the laws. To evince this the more clearly, it may not be amiss to  descend to a few particulars.    [Footnote b: Montesq. _Esp. L._ _l._ 11. _c._ 5.]    [Footnote c: _Facultas ejus, quod cuique facere libet, nisi quid vi,  aut jure prohibetur._ _Inst._ 1. 3. 1.]    LET us therefore begin with our gentlemen of independent estates and  fortune, the most useful as well as considerable body of men in the  nation; whom even to suppose ignorant in this branch of learning is  treated by Mr Locke[d] as a strange absurdity. It is their landed  property, with it's long and voluminous train of descents and  conveyances, settlements, entails, and incumbrances, that forms the  most intricate and most extensive object of legal knowlege. The  thorough comprehension of these, in all their minute distinctions, is  perhaps too laborious a task for any but a lawyer by profession: yet  still the understanding of a few leading principles, relating to  estates and conveyancing, may form some check and guard upon a  gentleman's inferior agents, and preserve him at least from very gross  and notorious imposition.    [Footnote d: Education. Sec. 187.]    AGAIN, the policy of all laws has made some forms necessary in the  wording of last wills and testaments, and more with regard to their  attestation. An ignorance in these must always be of dangerous  consequence, to such as by choice or necessity compile their own  testaments without any technical assistance. Those who have attended  the courts of justice are the best witnesses of the confusion and  distresses that are hereby occasioned in families; and of the  difficulties that arise in discerning the true meaning of the  testator, or sometimes in discovering any meaning at all: so that in  the end his estate may often be vested quite contrary to these his  enigmatical intentions, because perhaps he has omitted one or two  formal words, which are necessary to ascertain the sense with  indisputable legal precision, or has executed his will in the presence  of fewer witnesses than the law requires.    BUT to proceed from private concerns to those of a more public  consideration. All gentlemen of fortune are, in consequence of their  property, liable to be called upon to establish the rights, to  estimate the injuries, to weigh the accusations, and sometimes to  dispose of the lives of their fellow-subjects, by serving upon juries.  In this situation they are frequently to decide, and that upon their  oaths, questions of nice importance, in the solution of which some  legal skill is requisite; especially where the law and the fact, as it  often happens, are intimately blended together. And the general  incapacity, even of our best juries, to do this with any tolerable  propriety has greatly debased their authority; and has unavoidably  thrown more power into the hands of the judges, to direct, control,  and even reverse their verdicts, than perhaps the constitution  intended.    BUT it is not as a juror only that the English gentleman is called  upon to determine questions of right, and distribute justice to his  fellow-subjects: it is principally with this order of men that the  commission of the peace is filled. And here a very ample field is  opened for a gentleman to exert his talents, by maintaining good order  in his neighbourhood; by punishing the dissolute and idle; by  protecting the peaceable and industrious; and, above all, by healing  petty differences and preventing vexatious prosecutions. But, in order  to attain these desirable ends, it is necessary that the magistrate  should understand his business; and have not only the will, but the  power also, (under which must be included the knowlege) of  administring legal and effectual justice. Else, when he has mistaken  his authority, through passion, through ignorance, or absurdity, he  will be the object of contempt from his inferiors, and of censure  from those to whom he is accountable for his conduct.    YET farther; most gentlemen of considerable property, at some period  or other in their lives, are ambitious of representing their country  in parliament: and those, who are ambitious of receiving so high a"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/30850"],[0,"Philippine Mats (#2)"],[1,"usually first treated  with kolis leaves.    Turmeric.--This plant (Curcuma longa) is known as dilao throughout the  Islands. In Ilocano it is called kunig. Kalaoag is its name in Negros  and Sorsogon, ange in Pampanga and duao in parts of the Visayas. The  yellow dye obtained from the roots is fugitive in the sunlight.    Annatto.--This plant (Bixa orellana) is generally known here  as achuete. It is sometimes called achiote. The plant bears burs  containing many small reddish seeds, from the pulp of which the dye  is obtained. It is often employed in combination with turmeric. The  result is a yellow orange. The dye fades easily.    Deora.--The use of this plant (Peristrophe tinctoria) is confined to  the Visayas and Mindanao, where it is known by this name and also  as dauda and daura. In Samar the name is dala-uda. It is a small  bush and is usually grown in the gardens for its leaves and tender  stems. A mordant is not used. The color ranges from yellow orange to  a deep red orange.    The methods of using these dye materials are explained for each straw.        Materials Used with Mud to Obtain Dark Grays.    Red or green straws are turned dark gray by burying them in mud to  which certain substances (usually containing tannin) are added.    Talisay.--This large tree (Terminalia catappa) is common in the  Philippines. The leaves are added to the mud in dyeing straw  black. From the bark a brown dye may be obtained. It is, however,  seldom used. It is universally known as talisay. Spanish speaking  people call it almendras.    Indigo.--Two species of Indigoferae are grown in the Philippines and  are known as tagum. Except with mud they are not used to dye straws.    Tiagkot.--The leaves of this plant (Pithecolobium subacutum)  are employed on Romblon Island in dyeing buri gray. Other names  are tagayong, narandauel, saplit (Cagayan); carisquis, ayamguitan  (Zambales); tugurare (Pangasinan); inep (Bulacan); malasaga, malaganip,  tekin (Laguna); bahay (Sorsogon); tagomtagom (Samar); tique (Rizal).    Kabling.--This plant (Pogostemon cablin) is generally cultivated,  though it grows where its cultivation has been abandoned. A volatile  oil, used to keep away insects from textiles, is obtained from  the leaves. The leaves are used in Tanay, Rizal, in obtaining gray  sabutan straw.    Mabolo.--The heart wood of this tree (Diospyros discolor) is known  as kamagon. The leaves are employed in Tanay, Rizal.    Castor.--This plant (Ricinus communis) is seldom cultivated in the  Philippines but is found wild in all localities. The \"beans\" yield  the oil. The leaves are added to mud in obtaining gray sabutan straw.        Artificial Dyes.    It is commonly believed that artificial dyes are less permanent  than natural ones. This is seldom the case; as a matter of fact,  some of the fastest and most valuable dyes are now made artificially  and many are not procurable from vegetable coloring matters. Most  of the cheaper dyes made from coal tar are fugitive; that is, they  fade in sunlight or water or in both. They are often still further  cheapened by being adulterated with salt, dextrine and the like. Such  are the colors which are usually sold by the Chinese tienda keepers  and which have caused artificial dyes in general to come into such  ill-repute in the Philippines. Many of these \"Chino dyes\" contain 95  per cent salt. It is the belief, however, that artificial dyes of a  good class, so packed and marketed that they will come cheaply to the  hands of the dyers and weavers, will drive out of use practically all  of the vegetable dyes now employed in the Philippines. The disuse of  the natural dyes would not be regretted here, for, with the possible  exception of those obtained from sabutan straw in Tanay, much finer  colors can be produced with artificial dyes, as to both beauty and  fastness. If the time of the workers is considered, the vegetable  dyes now employed in the Philippines are more expensive than the  artificial dyes, even though the latter are now sold in wastefully  small packages and bear the burden of several large profits before  they come to the hands of the persons using them. [4]          DYEING.      The process of dyeing is simple. The fluid is prepared in water  (usually boiling), and the material is immersed in it. The shade of  color obtained depends on the length of time the material is allowed  to remain in the fluid or the number of times it is treated, and the  strength of the dye. The combination of two different dyes to obtain  a third is understood to some extent. In particular, red and yellow  are mixed to obtain orange.            SUGGESTIONS ON THE USE OF COLORS IN MATS.      Standard Colors.    The three primary colors are red, blue, and yellow. The three secondary  colors are obtained by combination of the three primary colors, and are  orange, green, and violet. Orange is made by a combination of yellow  and red, green is a combination of blue and yellow, and violet is the  combination of red and blue. Most of the dye materials explained in the  preceding pages do not produce standard colors and so, when combined,  do not result in the expected secondary color. Often those called red  are, in point of fact, red-violet (see Plate III). Sometimes, also,  dyes called yellow are yellow-orange. A mixture of yellow-orange  and red-violet would produce a muddy color. Dye called green may be  really blue-green or yellow-green, and combined with red, will make  a muddy color.    The above remarks on standard complementary colors are only valid  for pure colors and it is only by much experimentation that pleasing  tones can be obtained by a combination of the dyes used on straws in  the Philippines.        How to Tone Down Brilliant Colors.    Many of the colors used in Philippine mats are very brilliant. A little  brilliantly colored straw, properly combined with subdued colors such  as gray or one of the natural colors of Philippine straws, is pleasing,  but the abundant use of brilliant straws, such as are sometimes seen  in mats of solid color, is to be discouraged.    All brilliant colors may be subdued by adding to them their  complementary color. Thus a brilliant red may be subdued by adding to  it a small amount of green and in the same way brilliant green may be  toned down by mixing with it a small portion of red. If too much of the  complementary color is added the result will be gray. As will be seen,  all complementary colors will subdue one another. In Plate III the  principal colors have been so arranged that the complementary colors  are directly opposite each other and are connected by lines. Any two  colors connected by lines on this chart will tone down each other and,  if mixed in proper proportions, will result in gray.    It is probable that any straw which has been dyed too brilliant, can be  closely matched to one of the colors given on Plate III. Consequently  its complement can be determined and, by experimentation, the brilliant  color toned down. Usually only an exceedingly small amount of its  complement is needed to tone down a given color.        Color Combination.    In general, too many different colors appear in the Philippine mats,  and most of these are brilliant. It is often true that a large  amount of a given brilliant color is offensive to the eye, and yet  the addition of a little of it greatly enhances the beauty of the  mat. Often color combinations are not harmonious. Particularly  bad effects are obtained with red-violet and yellow or  yellow-orange. Red-violet with blue-green is another unfortunate  combination.    Certain rules have been set down for combination of colors: (1) A given  color with its tints and shades [5] may always be safely combined;  (2) complementary colors may always be safely combined; (3) the tints  and shades of complementary colors may always be safely combined;  (4) any three colors occurring in sequence on the color chart may be  combined in that sequence.    The following notes on the use and combination of the colored straws  from Tanay, Rizal, and from Romblon, and those shown on the charts  accompanying the dyes of Leopold Cassela & Co., are given. The figures  refer to the numbers given the colored straws on these charts. These  dyes were evolved for the Bureau of Education especially for Philippine  mat straws and will soon be available in the market. The notes have  been prepared in accordance with the rules above outlined, and, if  they are followed closely, no unfortunate color combination can result.
