[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/2756"],[0,"Marquise Brinvillier (#2)"],[1,"(and at the period the power of incantation and magic was still believed  in) that he felt no doubt that the arch-enemy of the human race, who is  continually at hand, had heard him and had now come in answer to his  prayers. He sat up on the bed, feeling mechanically at the place where  the handle of his sword would have been but two hours since, feeling his  hair stand on end, and a cold sweat began to stream down his face as the  strange fantastic being step by step approached him. At length the  apparition paused, the prisoner and he stood face to face for a moment,  their eyes riveted; then the mysterious stranger spoke in gloomy tones.    \"Young man,\" said he, \"you have prayed to the devil for vengeance on the  men who have taken you, for help against the God who has abandoned you.  I have the means, and I am here to proffer it. Have you the courage to  accept?\"    \"First of all,\" asked Sainte-Croix; \"who are you?\"    \"Why seek you to know who I am,\" replied the unknown, \"at the very  moment when I come at your call, and bring what you desire?\"    \"All the same,\" said Sainte-Croix, still attributing what he heard to a  supernatural being, \"when one makes a compact of this kind, one prefers  to know with whom one is treating.\"    \"Well, since you must know,\" said the stranger, \"I am the Italian  Exili.\"    Sainte-Croix shuddered anew, passing from a supernatural vision to a  horrible reality. The name he had just heard had a terrible notoriety at  the time, not only in France but in Italy as well. Exili had been driven  out of Rome, charged with many poisonings, which, however, could not be  satisfactorily brought home to him. He had gone to Paris, and there, as  in his native country, he had drawn the eyes of the authorities upon  himself; but neither in Paris nor in Rome was he, the pupil of Rene and  of Trophana, convicted of guilt. All the same, though proof was wanting,  his enormities were so well accredited that there was no scruple as to  having him arrested. A warrant was out against him: Exili was taken up,  and was lodged in the Bastille. He had been there about six months when  Sainte-Croix was brought to the same place. The prisoners were numerous  just then, so the governor had his new guest put up in the same room as  the old one, mating Exili and Sainte-Croix, not knowing that they were a  pair of demons. Our readers now understand the rest. Sainte-Croix was  put into an unlighted room by the gaoler, and in the dark had failed to  see his companion: he had abandoned himself to his rage, his  imprecations had revealed his state of mind to Exili, who at once seized  the occasion for gaining a devoted and powerful disciple, who once out  of prison might open the doors for him, perhaps, or at least avenge his  fate should he be incarcerated for life.    The repugnance felt by Sainte-Croix for his fellow-prisoner did not last  long, and the clever master found his pupil apt. Sainte-Croix, a strange  mixture of qualities good and evil, had reached the supreme crisis of  his life, when the powers of darkness or of light were to prevail.  Maybe, if he had met some angelic soul at this point, he would have been  led to God; he encountered a demon, who conducted him to Satan.    Exili was no vulgar poisoner: he was a great artist in poisons,  comparable with the Medici or the Borgias. For him murder was a fine  art, and he had reduced it to fixed and rigid rules: he had arrived at a  point when he was guided not by his personal interest but by a taste for  experiment. God has reserved the act of creation for Himself, but has  suffered destruction to be within the scope of man: man therefore  supposes that in destroying life he is God's equal. Such was the nature  of Exili's pride: he was the dark, pale alchemist of death: others might  seek the mighty secret of life, but he had found the secret of  destruction.    For a time Sainte-Croix hesitated: at last he yielded to the taunts of  his companion, who accused Frenchmen of showing too much honour in their  crimes, of allowing themselves to be involved in the ruin of their  enemies, whereas they might easily survive them and triumph over their  destruction. In opposition to this French gallantry, which often  involves the murderer in a death more cruel than that he has given, he  pointed to the Florentine traitor with his amiable smile and his deadly  poison. He indicated certain powders and potions, some of them of dull  action, wearing out the victim so slowly that he dies after long  suffering; others violent and so quick, that they kill like a flash of  lightning, leaving not even time for a single cry. Little by little  Sainte-Croix became interested in the ghastly science that puts the  lives of all men in the hand of one. He joined in Exili's experiments;  then he grew clever enough to make them for himself; and when, at the  year's end, he left the Bastille, the pupil was almost as accomplished  as his master.    Sainte-Croix returned into that society which had banished him,  fortified by a fatal secret by whose aid he could repay all the evil he  had received. Soon afterwards Exili was set free--how it happened is not  known--and sought out Sainte-Croix, who let him a room in the name of  his steward, Martin de Breuille, a room situated in the blind, alley off  the Place Maubert, owned by a woman called Brunet.    It is not known whether Sainte-Croix had an opportunity of seeing the  Marquise de Brinvilliers during his sojourn in the Bastille, but it is  certain that as soon as he was a free man the lovers were more attached  than ever. They had learned by experience, however, of what they had to  fear; so they resolved that they would at once make trial of  Sainte-Croix's newly acquired knowledge, and M. d'Aubray was selected by  his daughter for the first victim. At one blow she would free herself  from the inconvenience of his rigid censorship, and by inheriting his  goods would repair her own fortune, which had been almost dissipated by  her husband. But in trying such a bold stroke one must be very sure of  results, so the marquise decided to experiment beforehand on another  person. Accordingly, when one day after luncheon her maid, Francoise  Roussel, came into her room, she gave her a slice of mutton and some  preserved gooseberries for her own meal. The girl unsuspiciously ate  what her mistress gave her, but almost at once felt ill, saying she had  severe pain in the stomach, and a sensation as though her heart were  being pricked with pins. But she did not die, and the marquise perceived  that the poison needed to be made stronger, and returned it to  Sainte-Croix, who brought her some more in a few days' time.    The moment had come for action. M. d'Aubray, tired with business, was to  spend a holiday at his castle called Offemont. The marquise offered to  go with him. M. d'Aubray, who supposed her relations with Sainte-Croix  to be quite broken off, joyfully accepted. Offemont was exactly the  place for a crime of this nature. In the middle of the forest of Aigue,  three or four miles from Compiegne, it would be impossible to get  efficient help before the rapid action of the poison had made it  useless.      M. d'Aubray started with his daughter and one servant only. Never had       the marquise been so devoted to her father, so especially       attentive, as she was during this journey. And M. d'Aubray, like       Christ--who though He had no children had a father's heart--loved       his repentant daughter more than if she had never strayed. And then       the marquise profited by the terrible calm look which we have       already noticed in her face: always with her father, sleeping in a       room adjoining his, eating with him, caring for his comfort in       every way, thoughtful and affectionate, allowing no other person to       do anything for him, she had to present a smiling face, in which       the most suspicious eye could detect nothing but filial tenderness,       though the vilest projects were in her heart. With this mask she       one evening offered him some soup that was poisoned. He took it;       with her eyes she saw him put it to his lips, watched him drink it       down, and with a brazen countenance she gave no outward sign of       that terrible anxiety that must have been pressing on her heart.       When he had drunk it all, and she had taken with steady hands the       cup and its saucer, she went back to her own room, waited and       listened....    The effect was rapid. The marquise heard her father moan; then she heard  groans. At last, unable to endure his sufferings, he called out to his  daughter. The marquise went to him. But now her face showed signs of the  liveliest anxiety, and it was for M. d'Aubray to try to reassure her  about himself! He thought it was only a trifling indisposition, and was  not willing that a doctor should be disturbed. But then he was seized by  a frightful vomiting, followed by such unendurable pain that he yielded  to his daughter's entreaty that she should send for help. A doctor  arrived at about eight o'clock in the morning, but by that time all that  could have helped a scientific inquiry had been disposed of: the doctor  saw nothing, in M. d'Aubray's story but what might be accounted for by  indigestion; so he dosed him, and went back to Compiegne.    All that day the marquise never left the sick man. At night she had a  bed made up in his room, declaring that no one else must sit up with  him; thus she, was able to watch the progress of the malady and see with  her own eyes the conflict between death and life in the body of her  father. The next day the doctor came again: M. d'Aubray was worse; the  nausea had ceased, but the pains in the stomach were now more acute; a  strange fire seemed to burn his vitals; and a treatment was ordered  which necessitated his return to Paris. He was soon so weak that he  thought it might be best to go only so far as"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/27560"],[0,"The 2005 CIA World Factbook (#2)"],[1," (cu m)  2181  Natural gas - consumption (cu m)  2182  Natural gas - imports (cu m)  2183  Natural gas - exports (cu m)  2184  Internet hosts  2185  Investment (gross fixed) (% of GDP)  2186  Public debt (% of GDP)  2187  Current account balance  2188  Reserves of foreign exchange and gold  2193  Major infectious diseases  2194  Refugees and internally displaced persons        ======================================================================        Rank Orders      [Transcriber's note: To search on a rank order in this file, prefix  the rank's name with \"@\", e.g. \"@Population\".  \"Population\" will find  all occurrences; prefixing it with \"@\" will find the correct location.]        Guide to Rank Order Pages      Rank Order pages are presorted lists of data from selected Factbook  data fields. Rank Order pages are generally given in descending order -  highest to lowest - such as Population and Area. The two exceptions are  Unemployment Rate and Inflation Rate, which are in ascending - lowest  to highest - order.

In the Economy  category, entries have been added for Current account balance,  Investment (gross fixed), Public debt, and Reserves of foreign exchange  and gold. The Transnational issues category has a new Refugees and  internally displaced persons entry.      Abbreviations  This information is included in Appendix A: Abbreviations, which  includes all abbreviations and acronyms used in the Factbook, with  their expansions.    Acronyms  An acronym is an abbreviation coined from the initial letter of each  successive word in a term or phrase. In general, an acronym made up  solely from the first letter of the major words in the expanded form is  rendered in all capital letters (NATO from North Atlantic Treaty  Organization; an exception would be ASEAN for Association of Southeast  Asian Nations). In general, an acronym made up of more than the first  letter of the major words in the expanded form is rendered with only an  initial capital letter (Comsat from Communications Satellite  Corporation; an exception would be NAM from Nonaligned Movement).  Hybrid forms are sometimes used to distinguish between initially  identical terms (WTO: WTrO for World Trade Organization and WToO for  World Tourism Organization.)    Administrative divisions  This entry generally gives the numbers, designatory terms, and first-  order administrative divisions as approved by the US Board on  Geographic Names (BGN). Changes that have been reported but not yet  acted on by BGN are noted.    Age structure  This entry provides the distribution of the population according to  age. Information is included by sex and age group (0-14 years, 15-64  years, 65 years and over). The age structure of a population affects a  nation's key socioeconomic issues. Countries with young populations  (high percentage under age 15) need to invest more in schools, while  countries with older populations (high percentage ages 65 and over)  need to invest more in the health sector. The age structure can also be  used to help predict potential political issues. For example, the rapid  growth of a young adult population unable to find employment can lead  to unrest.    Agriculture - products  This entry is an ordered listing of major crops and products starting  with the most important.    Airports  This entry gives the total number of airports. The runway(s) may be  paved (concrete or asphalt surfaces) or unpaved (grass, dirt, sand, or  gravel surfaces), but must be usable. Not all airports have facilities  for refueling, maintenance, or air traffic control.    Airports - with paved runways  This entry gives the total number of airports with paved runways  (concrete or asphalt surfaces) by length. For airports with more than  one runway, only the longest runway is included according to the  following five groups - (1) over 3,047 m, (2) 2,438 to 3,047 m, (3)  1,524 to 2,437 m, (4) 914 to 1,523 m, and (5) under 914 m. Only  airports with usable runways are included in this listing. Not all  airports have facilities for refueling, maintenance, or air traffic  control.    Airports - with unpaved runways  This entry gives the total number of airports with unpaved runways  (grass, dirt, sand, or gravel surfaces) by length. For airports with  more than one runway, only the longest runway is included according to  the following five groups - (1) over 3,047 m, (2) 2,438 to 3,047 m, (3)  1,524 to 2,437 m, (4) 914 to 1,523 m, and (5) under 914 m. Only  airports with usable runways are included in this listing. Not all  airports have facilities for refueling, maintenance, or air traffic  control.    Appendixes  This section includes Factbook-related material by topic.    Area  This entry includes three subfields. Total area is the sum of all land  and water areas delimited by international boundaries and/or  coastlines. Land area is the aggregate of all surfaces delimited by  international boundaries and/or coastlines, excluding inland water  bodies (lakes, reservoirs, rivers). Water area is the sum of all water  surfaces delimited by international boundaries and/or coastlines,  including inland water bodies (lakes, reservoirs, rivers).    Area - comparative  This entry provides an area comparison based on total area equivalents.  Most entities are compared with the entire US or one of the 50 states  based on area measurements (1990 revised) provided by the US Bureau of  the Census. The smaller entities are compared with Washington, DC (178  sq km, 69 sq mi) or The Mall in Washington, DC (0.59 sq km, 0.23 sq mi,  146 acres).    Background  This entry usually highlights major historic events and current issues  and may include a statement about one or two key future trends.    Birth rate  This entry gives the average annual number of births during a year per  1,000 persons in the population at midyear; also known as crude birth  rate. The birth rate is usually the dominant factor in determining the  rate of population growth. It depends on both the level of fertility  and the age structure of the population.    Budget  This entry includes revenues, total expenditures, and capital  expenditures. These figures are calculated on an exchange rate basis,  i.e., not in purchasing power parity (PPP) terms.    Capital  This entry gives the location of the seat of government.    Climate  This entry includes a brief description of typical weather regimes  throughout the year.    Coastline  This entry gives the total length of the boundary between the land area  (including islands) and the sea.    Communications  This category deals with the means of exchanging information and  includes the telephone, radio, television, and Internet host entries.    Communications - note  This entry includes miscellaneous communications information of"]]]
