When we remember that there are about three hundred and eighty  known species of Tanagers in Tropical America, it would seem a light  task to acquaint oneself with the small family at home.          THE AMERICAN WHITE-FRONTED GOOSE.      \"As stupid as a Goose!\"    Yes, I know that is the way our family is usually spoken of. But then  I'm not a tame Goose, you know. We wild fellows think we know a little  more than the one which waddles about the duck-pond in your back yard.    He sticks to one old place all the time. Waddles and talks and looks the  same year after year. We migratory birds, on the other hand, fly from  place to place. Our summers are passed here, our winters there; so that  we pick up a thing or two the common Goose never dreams of.    \"The laughing Goose!\"    Yes, some people call me that. I don't know why, unless my _Honk, honk,  honk!_ sounds like a laugh. Perhaps, though, it is because the look  about my mouth is so pleasant.    Did you ever see a flock of us in motion, in October or November, going  to our winter home?    Ah, that is a sight! When the time comes for us to start, we form  ourselves into a figure like this >. a big gander taking the lead where  the dot is. Such a _honk, honk, honking_ you never heard. People who  have heard us, and seen us, say it sounds like a great army overhead.    Where do we live in summer, and what do we eat?    You will find us throughout the whole of North America, but in greater  numbers on the Pacific coast. The fresh-water lakes are our favorite  resorts. We visit the wheat fields and corn fields, nibbling the young,  tender blades and feeding on the scattered grain. The farmers don't like  it a bit, but we don't care. That is the reason our flesh tastes so  sweet.    And tough!    My, how you talk! It is only we old fellows that are tough, we fellows  over a year old. But of course a great many people don't know that, or  don't care.    Why, I once heard of a gander that had waddled around a barnyard for  five long years. Thanksgiving Day arrived, and they roasted him for  dinner.    Think of eating an old, _old_ friend like that!    Where do we build our nests?    Away up north, in Alaska, and on the islands of the Arctic Sea. We make  them of hay, feathers, and down, building them in hollow places on the  ground.    How many eggs?    Six. I am very good to my mate, and an affectionate father.     [Illustration: From col. Chi. Acad. Sciences.                  WHITE-FRONTED GOOSE.                  Copyrighted by                  Nature Study Pub. Co., 1897, Chicago.]          THE AMERICAN WHITE-FRONTED GOOSE.      White-fronted or Laughing Geese are found in considerable numbers on the  prairies of the Mississippi Valley. They are called Prairie Brant by  market-men and gunners. Though not abundant on the Atlantic seaboard,  vast flocks may be seen in the autumn months on the Pacific Slope. In  Oregon and northern California some remain all winter, though the  greater number go farther south. They appear to prefer the grassy  patches along streams flowing into the ocean, or the tide-water flats so  abundant in Oregon and Washington, where the Speckle-bellies, as they  are called, feed in company with the Snow Geese. The nesting place of  this favorite species is in the wooded districts of Alaska and along the  Yukon river. No nest is formed, from seven to ten eggs being laid in a  depression in the sand.    It is said that notwithstanding all references to their ungainly  movement and doltish intellect, the Wild Goose, of which the  White-fronted is one of the most interesting, is held in high estimation  by the sportsman, and even he, if keen of observation, will learn from  it many things that will entitle the species to advancement in the  mental grade, and prove the truth of a very old adage, that you cannot  judge of things by outward appearance. A goose, waddling around the  barnyard, may not present a very graceful appearance, nor seem endowed  with much intelligence, yet the ungainly creature, when in its natural  state, has an ease of motion in flight which will compare with that of  any of the feathered tribe, and shows a knowledge of the means of  defense, and of escaping the attacks of its enemies, that few possess.  There is probably no bird more cautious, vigilant, and fearful at danger  than this. Should their suspicion be aroused, they rise upward slowly in  a dense cloud of white, and sound their alarm notes, but they may not go  over fifty yards before they alight again, so that the amusement of  watching them may be continued without much toil or inconvenience.    The White-fronted Goose visits Illinois only during its migrations,  coming some time in October or early in November, and returning in March  or April. During its sojourn there it frequents chiefly open prairies,  or wheat fields, where it nibbles the young and tender blades, and  cornfields, where it feeds upon the scattered grains. In California,  Ridgway says, it is so numerous in winter as to be very destructive of  the growing wheat crop, and it is said that in the Sacramento and San  Joaquin valleys, farmers often find it necessary to employ men by the  month to hunt and drive them from the fields. This is most successfully  accomplished by means of brush hiding places, or \"blinds,\" or by  approaching the flocks on horseback by the side of an ox which has been  trained for the purpose.    The White-fronted Goose is greatly esteemed for the excellent quality of  its flesh, which, by those who have learned to appreciate it, is  generally considered superior to that of any other species. While the  cruel pursuit of the bird, merely for purpose of sport ought not to be  continued, appreciation of its value as food may well be encouraged.          THE TURNSTONE.      This small plover-like bird is found on the sea-coasts of nearly all  countries; in America, from Greenland and Alaska to Chili and Brazil;  more or less common in the interior along the shores of the Great Lakes  and larger rivers.    It is generally found in company with flocks of the smaller species of  Sandpipers, its boldly marked plumage contrasting with surroundings,  while the Sandpipers mingle with the sands and unless revealed by some  abrupt movement can hardly be seen at a little distance.    The name Turnstone has been applied to this bird on account of its  curious habit of dexterously inserting its bill beneath stones and  pebbles along the shore in quest of food, overturning them in search of  the insects or prey of any kind which may be lurking beneath. It is  found on smooth, sandy beaches, though more commonly about the base of  rocky cliffs and cones. The eggs of horseshoe crabs are its particular  delight.    In the nesting season the Turnstone is widely distributed throughout  the northern portions of both continents, and wanders southward along  the sea-coasts of all countries. In America it breeds commonly in the  Barren Lands of the Arctic coasts and the Anderson River districts, on  the Islands of Franklin and Liverpool bays, nesting in July. In the  Hudson's Bay country the eggs are laid in June. The nest is a hollow  scratched in the earth, and is lined with bits of grass.    The Turnstone is known by various names: \"Brant Bird,\" \"Bead-bird,\"  \"Horse-foot-Snipe,\" \"Sand-runner,\" \"Calico-back,\" \"Chicaric\" and  \"Chickling.\" The two latter names have reference to its rasping notes,  \"Calico-back,\" to the variegated plumage of the upper parts.    In summer the adults are oddly pied above with black, white, brown, and  chestnut-red, but the red is totally wanting in winter. They differ from  the true Plovers in the well developed hind-toe, and the strong claws,  but chiefly in the more robust feet, without trace of web between the  toes.    The eggs are greenish-drab in color, spotted, blotched, and dotted  irregularly and thickly with yellowish and umber brown. The eggs are two  or four, abruptly pyriform in shape.          SNOWBIRDS.          Along the narrow sandy height        I watch them swiftly come and go,          Or round the leafless wood,        Like flurries of wind-driven snow,      Revolving in perpetual flight,          A changing multitude.        Nearer and nearer still they sway,        And, scattering in a circled sweep,          Rush down without a sound;        And now I see them peer and peep,      Across yon level bleak and gray,          Searching the frozen ground,--        Until a little wind upheaves,        And makes a sudden rustling there,          And then they drop their play,        Flash up into the sunless air,      And like a flight of silver leaves          Swirl round and sweep away.

Black shadows fall      From the lindens tall,      That lift aloft their massive wall          Against the southern sky;        And from the realms      Of the shadowy elms,      A tide-like darkness overwhelms          The fields that round us lie.        But the night is fair      And everywhere      A warm, soft vapor fills the air          And distant sounds seem near;        And above, in the light      Of the star-lit night,      Swift birds of passage wing their flight          Through the dewy atmosphere.        I hear the beat      Of their pinions fleet,      As from the land of snow and sleet          They seek a southern lea.        I hear the cry      Of their voices high      Falling dreamily through the sky,          But their forms I cannot see.                                --LONGFELLOW.

What would Castlereagh or  Liverpool have thought could they have seen the items which we were  buying for our six million pounds? The inventory would have been a mixed  one of good and of evil; nine fierce Kaffir wars, the greatest  diamond mines in the world, the wealthiest gold mines, two costly and  humiliating campaigns with men whom we respected even when we fought  with them, and now at last, we hope, a South Africa of peace and  prosperity, with equal rights and equal duties for all men. The future  should hold something very good for us in that land, for if we merely  count the past we should be compelled to say that we should have been  stronger, richer, and higher in the world's esteem had our possessions  there never passed beyond the range of the guns of our men-of-war. But  surely the most arduous is the most honourable, and, looking back from  the end of their journey, our descendants may see that our long record  of struggle, with its mixture of disaster and success, its outpouring  of blood and of treasure, has always tended to some great and enduring  goal.    The title-deeds to the estate are, as I have said, good ones, but there  is one singular and ominous flaw in their provisions. The ocean has  marked three boundaries to it, but the fourth is undefined. There is  no word of the 'Hinterland;' for neither the term nor the idea had  then been thought of. Had Great Britain bought those vast regions which  extended beyond the settlements? Or were the discontented Dutch at  liberty to pass onwards and found fresh nations to bar the path of the  Anglo-Celtic colonists? In that question lay the germ of all the trouble  to come. An American would realise the point at issue if he could  conceive that after the founding of the United States the Dutch  inhabitants of the State of New York had trekked to the westward and  established fresh communities under a new flag. Then, when the American  population overtook these western States, they would be face to face  with the problem which this country has had to solve. If they found  these new States fiercely anti-American and extremely unprogressive,  they would experience that aggravation of their difficulties with which  our statesmen have had to deal.    At the time of their transference to the British flag the  colonists--Dutch, French, and German--numbered some thirty thousand.  They were slaveholders, and the slaves were about as numerous as  themselves. The prospect of complete amalgamation between the British  and the original settlers would have seemed to be a good one, since  they were of much the same stock, and their creeds could only be  distinguished by their varying degrees of bigotry and intolerance. Five  thousand British emigrants were landed in 1820, settling on the Eastern  borders of the colony, and from that time onwards there was a slow but  steady influx of English speaking colonists. The Government had the  historical faults and the historical virtues of British rule. It was  mild, clean, honest, tactless, and inconsistent. On the whole, it might  have done very well had it been content to leave things as it found  them. But to change the habits of the most conservative of Teutonic  races was a dangerous venture, and one which has led to a long series  of complications, making up the troubled history of South Africa. The  Imperial Government has always taken an honourable and philanthropic  view of the rights of the native and the claim which he has to the  protection of the law. We hold and rightly, that British justice, if not  blind, should at least be colour-blind. The view is irreproachable in  theory and incontestable in argument, but it is apt to be irritating  when urged by a Boston moralist or a London philanthropist upon men  whose whole society has been built upon the assumption that the black  is the inferior race. Such a people like to find the higher morality  for themselves, not to have it imposed upon them by those who live under  entirely different conditions. They feel--and with some reason--that  it is a cheap form of virtue which, from the serenity of a well-ordered  household in Beacon Street or Belgrave Square, prescribes what the  relation shall be between a white employer and his half-savage,  half-childish retainers. Both branches of the Anglo-Celtic race have  grappled with the question, and in each it has led to trouble.    The British Government in South Africa has always played the unpopular  part of the friend and protector of the native servants. It was upon  this very point that the first friction appeared between the old  settlers and the new administration. A rising with bloodshed followed  the arrest of a Dutch farmer who had maltreated his slave. It was  suppressed, and five of the participants were hanged. This punishment  was unduly severe and exceedingly injudicious. A brave race can forget  the victims of the field of battle, but never those of the scaffold. The  making of political martyrs is the last insanity of statesmanship. It  is true that both the man who arrested and the judge who condemned the  prisoners were Dutch, and that the British Governor interfered on the  side of mercy; but all this was forgotten afterwards in the desire to  make racial capital out of the incident. It is typical of the enduring  resentment which was left behind that when, after the Jameson raid, it  seemed that the leaders of that ill-fated venture might be hanged,  the beam was actually brought from a farmhouse at Cookhouse Drift to  Pretoria, that the Englishmen might die as the Dutchmen had died in  1816. Slagter's Nek marked the dividing of the ways between the British  Government and the Afrikaners.    And the separation soon became more marked. There were injudicious  tamperings with the local government and the local ways, with a  substitution of English for Dutch in the law courts. With vicarious  generosity, the English Government gave very lenient terms to the Kaffir  tribes who in 1834 had raided the border farmers. And then, finally, in  this same year there came the emancipation of the slaves throughout the  British Empire, which fanned all smouldering discontents into an active  flame.    It must be confessed that on this occasion the British philanthropist  was willing to pay for what he thought was right. It was a noble  national action, and one the morality of which was in advance of its  time, that the British Parliament should vote the enormous sum of twenty  million pounds to pay compensation to the slaveholders, and so to remove  an evil with which the mother country had no immediate connection. It  was as well that the thing should have been done when it was, for had we  waited till the colonies affected had governments of their own it could  never have been done by constitutional methods. With many a grumble the  good British householder drew his purse from his fob, and he paid for  what he thought to be right. If any special grace attends the virtuous  action which brings nothing but tribulation in this world, then we may  hope for it over this emancipation. We spent our money, we ruined our  West Indian colonies, and we started a disaffection in South Africa, the  end of which we have not seen. Yet if it were to be done again we should  doubtless do it. The highest morality may prove also to be the highest  wisdom when the half-told story comes to be finished.    But the details of the measure were less honourable than the principle.  It was carried out suddenly, so that the country had no time to adjust  itself to the new conditions. Three million pounds were ear-marked for  South Africa, which gives a price per slave of from sixty to seventy  pounds, a sum considerably below the current local rates. Finally, the  compensation was made payable in London, so that the farmers sold their  claims at reduced prices to middlemen. Indignation meetings were held in  every little townlet and cattle camp on the Karoo. The old Dutch spirit  was up--the spirit of the men who cut the dykes. Rebellion was useless.  But a vast untenanted land stretched to the north of them. The nomad  life was congenial to them, and in their huge ox-drawn wagons--like  those bullock-carts in which some of their old kinsmen came to  Gaul--they had vehicles and homes and forts all in one. One by one they  were loaded up, the huge teams were inspanned, the women were seated  inside, the men, with their long-barrelled guns, walked alongside,  and the great exodus was begun. Their herds and flocks accompanied the  migration, and the children helped to round them in and drive them. One  tattered little boy of ten cracked his sjambok whip behind the bullocks.  He was a small item in that singular crowd, but he was of interest to  us, for his name was Paul Stephanus Kruger.    It was a strange exodus, only comparable in modern times to the sallying  forth of the Mormons from Nauvoo upon their search for the promised land  of Utah. The country was known and sparsely settled as far north as the  Orange River, but beyond there was a great region which had never  been penetrated save by some daring hunter or adventurous pioneer. It  chanced--if there be indeed such an element as chance in the graver  affairs of man--that a Zulu conqueror had swept over this land and left  it untenanted, save by the dwarf bushmen, the hideous aborigines,  lowest of the human race. There were fine grazing and good soil for  the emigrants. They traveled in small detached parties, but their total  numbers were considerable, from six to ten thousand according to their  historian, or nearly a quarter of the whole population of the colony.  Some of the early bands perished miserably. A large number made a  trysting-place at a high peak to the east of Bloemfontein in what was  lately the Orange Free State. One"]]]
