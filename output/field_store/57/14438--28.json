[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/2995"],[0,"Tacitus on Germany (#2)"],[1," whole into distinct  battalions formed sharp in front. To recoil in battle, provided you  return again to the attack, passes with them rather for policy than  fear. Even when the combat is no more than doubtful, they bear away the  bodies of their slain. The most glaring disgrace that can befall them,  is to have quitted their shield; nor to one branded with such ignominy  is it lawful to join in their sacrifices, or to enter into their  assemblies; and many who had escaped in the day of battle, have hanged  themselves to put an end to this their infamy.    In the choice of kings they are determined by the splendour of their  race, in that of generals by their bravery. Neither is the power of  their kings unbounded or arbitrary: and their generals procure obedience  not so much by the force of their authority as by that of their example,  when they appear enterprising and brave, when they signalise themselves  by courage and prowess; and if they surpass all in admiration and  pre-eminence, if they surpass all at the head of an army. But to none  else but the Priests is it allowed to exercise correction, or to inflict  bonds or stripes. Nor when the Priests do this, is the same considered  as a punishment, or arising from the orders of the general, but from the  immediate command of the Deity, Him whom they believe to accompany them  in war. They therefore carry with them when going to fight, certain  images and figures taken out of their holy groves. What proves the  principal incentive to their valour is, that it is not at random nor by  the fortuitous conflux of men that their troops and pointed battalions  are formed, but by the conjunction of whole families, and tribes of  relations. Moreover, close to the field of battle are lodged all the  nearest and most interesting pledges of nature. Hence they hear the  doleful howlings of their wives, hence the cries of their tender  infants. These are to each particular the witnesses whom he most  reverences and dreads; these yield him the praise which affect him most.  Their wounds and maims they carry to their mothers, or to their wives,  neither are their mothers or wives shocked in telling, or in sucking  their bleeding sores. Nay, to their husbands and sons whilst engaged in  battle, they administer meat and encouragement.    In history we find, that some armies already yielding and ready to fly,  have been by women restored, through their inflexible importunity  and entreaties, presenting their breasts, and showing their impending  captivity; an evil to the Germans then by far most dreadful when it  befalls their women. So that the spirit of such cities as amongst  their hostages are enjoined to send their damsels of quality, is always  engaged more effectually than that of others. They even believe them  endowed with something celestial and the spirit of prophecy. Neither  do they disdain to consult them, nor neglect the responses which they  return. In the reign of the deified Vespasian, we have seen _Veleda_ for  a long time, and by many nations, esteemed and adored as a divinity. In  times past they likewise worshipped _Aurinia_ and several more, from  no complaisance or effort of flattery, nor as Deities of their own  creating.    Of all the Gods, Mercury is he whom they worship most. To him on certain  stated days it is lawful to offer even human victims. Hercules and Mars  they appease with beasts usually allowed for sacrifice. Some of the  Suevians make likewise immolations to _Isis_. Concerning the cause and  original of this foreign sacrifice I have found small light; unless  the figure of her image formed like a galley, show that such devotion  arrived from abroad. For the rest, from the grandeur and majesty of  beings celestial, they judge it altogether unsuitable to hold the Gods  enclosed within walls, or to represent them under any human likeness.  They consecrate whole woods and groves, and by the names of the Gods  they call these recesses; divinities these, which only in contemplation  and mental reverence they behold.    To the use of lots and auguries, they are addicted beyond all other  nations. Their method of divining by lots is exceeding simple. From a  tree which bears fruit they cut a twig, and divide it into two small  pieces. These they distinguish by so many several marks, and throw them  at random and without order upon a white garment. Then the Priest of the  community, if for the public the lots are consulted, or the father of  a family if about a private concern, after he has solemnly invoked the  Gods, with eyes lifted up to heaven, takes up every piece thrice, and  having done thus forms a judgment according to the marks before made. If  the chances have proved forbidding, they are no more consulted upon the  same affair during the same day; even when they are inviting, yet, for  confirmation, the faith of auguries too is tried. Yea, here also is the  known practice of divining events from the voices and flight of birds.  But to this nation it is peculiar, to learn presages and admonitions  divine from horses also. These are nourished by the State in the same  sacred woods and grooves, all milk-white and employed in no earthly  labour. These yoked in the holy chariot, are accompanied by the Priest  and the King, or the Chief of the community, who both carefully observed  his actions and neighing. Nor in any sort of augury is more faith and  assurance reposed, not by the populace only, but even by the nobles,  even by the Priests. These account themselves the ministers of the Gods,  and the horses privy to his will. They have likewise another method of  divination, whence to learn the issue of great and mighty wars. From the  nation with whom they are at war they contrive, it avails not how, to  gain a captive: him they engage in combat with one selected from amongst  themselves, each armed after the manner of his country, and according  as the victory falls to this or to the other, gather a presage of the  whole.    Affairs of smaller moment the chiefs determine: about matters of  higher consequence the whole nation deliberates; yet in such sort,  that whatever depends upon the pleasure and decision of the people, is  examined and discussed by the chiefs. Where no accident or emergency  intervenes, they assemble upon stated days, either, when the moon  changes, or is full: since they believe such seasons to be the most  fortunate for beginning all transactions. Neither in reckoning of time  do they count, like us, the number of days but that of nights. In this  style their ordinances are framed, in this style their diets appointed;  and with them the night seems to lead and govern the day. From their  extensive liberty this evil and default flows, that they meet not at  once, nor as men commanded and afraid to disobey; so that often the  second day, nay often the third, is consumed through the slowness of the  members in assembling. They sit down as they list, promiscuously, like a  crowd, and all armed. It is by the Priests that silence is enjoined,  and with the power of correction the Priests are then invested. Then the  King or Chief is heard, as are others, each according to his precedence  in age, or in nobility, or in warlike renown, or in eloquence; and the  influence of every speaker proceeds rather from his ability to persuade  than from any authority to command. If the proposition displease, they  reject it by an inarticulate murmur: if it be pleasing, they brandish  their javelins. The most honourable manner of signifying their assent,  is to express their applause by the sound of their arms.    In the assembly it is allowed to present accusations, and to prosecute  capital offences. Punishments vary according to the quality of the  crime. Traitors and deserters they hang upon trees. Cowards, and  sluggards, and unnatural prostitutes they smother in mud and bogs under  an heap of hurdles. Such diversity in their executions has this view,  that in punishing of glaring iniquities, it behooves likewise to  display them to sight; but effeminacy and pollution must be buried and  concealed. In lighter transgressions too the penalty is measured by  the fault, and the delinquents upon conviction are condemned to pay a  certain number of horses or cattle. Part of this mulct accrues to the  King or to the community, part to him whose wrongs are vindicated, or to  his next kindred. In the same assemblies are also chosen their chiefs  or rulers, such as administer justice in their villages and boroughs.  To each of these are assigned an hundred persons chosen from amongst  the populace, to accompany and assist him, men who help him at once with  their authority and their counsel.    Without being armed they transact nothing, whether of public or private  concernment. But it is repugnant to their custom for any man to use  arms, before the community has attested his capacity to wield them.  Upon such testimonial, either one of the rulers, or his father, or  some kinsman dignify the young man in the midst of the assembly, with  a shield and javelin. This amongst them is the _manly robe_, this first  degree of honour conferred upon their youth. Before this they seem  no more than part of a private family, but thenceforward part of the  Commonweal. The princely dignity they confer even upon striplings, whose  race is eminently noble, or whose fathers have done great and signal  services to the State. For about the rest, who are more vigorous and  long since tried, they crowd to attend; nor is it any shame to be seen  amongst the followers of these. Nay, there are likewise degrees of  followers, higher or lower, just as he whom they follow judges fit.  Mighty too is the emulation amongst these followers, of each to be first  in favour with his Prince; mighty also the emulation of the Princes,  to excel in the number and valour of followers.

In regard to size this Grebe comes next to the Western,  being 19 in. in length. This bird can be distinguished by the white  cheeks and throat and the reddish brown foreneck. They breed abundantly  in the far north placing their floating islands of decayed vegetation in  the water in the midst of the marsh grass. They lay from three to six  eggs of a dingy white color which have the stained surface common to  Grebes eggs. Size 2.35 x 1.25.    [Illustration 013: Chalky bluish white, stained buff.]  [Illustration: Western Grebe Holboell's Grebe.]  [Illustration: White, stained buff.]  [Illustration: Right-hand margin.]    Page 12    [Illustration 014: Walter Raine  NEST AND EGGS OF HOLBOELL'S GREBE  Lake Winnipegosis, Manitoba.]    Page 13    3. HORNED GREBE. Colymbus auritus.    Range.--The whole of North America, breeding in the interior from North  Dakota northwest; winters along the Gulf Coast. This species is one of  the most beautiful of the Grebes, having in the breeding season buffy  ear tufts, black cheeks and throat, and chestnut neck, breast and sides.  They breed abundantly in the marshy flats of North Dakota and the  interior of Canada. They build a typical Grebe's nest, a floating mass  of decayed matter which stains the naturally white eggs to a dirty  brown. The number of eggs varies from three to seven. Size 1.70 x 1.15.  Data.--Devils Lake, N. Dakota, June 20, 1900. 6 eggs much stained. Nest  floating in 4 ft. of water, a large mass of rotten rushes and weeds.  Collector. James Smalley.      4. EARED GREBE. _Colymbus nigricollis californicus._    Range.--North America west of the Mississippi, breeding from Texas to  Manitoba and wintering along the Pacific Coast of the United States and  from Texas southward.    Eared Grebes differ from the preceding in having the entire neck  blackish. They nest very abundantly throughout the west, in favorable  localities, from Texas to Minnesota and Dakota. Their nests are  constructed in the same manner as the preceding varieties and are  located in similar localities. As do all the Grebes when leaving the  nest, they cover the eggs with the damp rushes from around the base of  the nest. This is probably for the purpose of assisting incubation  during their absence, by the action of the sun's rays on the wet mass.  As they are nearly always thus covered upon the approach of anyone, this  may be done also as a protection from discovery. They lay from three to  eight bluish white eggs with the usual chalky and discolored appearance.  The breeding season is at its height early in June, or earlier, in the  southern portion of its range. Size 1.75 x 1.20. Data.--Artesian, S.  Dakota, June 21, 1899. Nest of rushes, floating in three feet of water.  Large colony in a small lake. Collector, F. A. Patton.    [Illustration 015: Horned Grebe. Eared Grebe.]  [Illustration: Buffy white, nest stained.]  [Illustration: Bluish white, stained.]  [Illustration: right hand margin.]    Page 14    [Illustration 016: Walter Raine  NEST AND EGGS OF HORNED GREBE  Saltcoats Marshes, Assiniboia, June 6, 1901.]  [Illustration left margin.]    Page 15    5. MEXICAN GREBE. _Colymbus dominicus brachypterus._    Range.--Southern Texas and Lower California southward to South America,  breeding throughout its range.    The Least Grebe is by far the smallest of the Grebes in this country,  being but 10 in. in length; it can not be mistaken for any other, the  Eared Grebe being the only species of this family found in the same  localities during the summer. These little Grebes nest very abundantly  along the Rio Grande Valley in Texas, the nesting season lasting from  the latter part of May until well into December.    Their nests are floating piles of grass and weeds upon which they lay  from three to five chalky white eggs, which are always discolored,  sometimes to a deep chocolate hue. These eggs average a great deal  darker in color than do any of the other Grebes. In a series of fifty  sets fully half were a rich brown tint. Size 1.40 x .95.      6. PIED-BILLED GREBE. _Podilymbus podiceps._    Range.--From the British provinces southward to Argentine Republic,  breeding locally throughout the northern portions of its range.    The Dabchick, as this bird is called, is the most evenly distributed  bird of this family. It is nowhere especially abundant, nor is it,  except in a very few localities, regarded as rare. Consequently it is  the best known bird of the species. They do not congregate in such large  numbers as the other Grebes during the nesting season, but one or more  pairs may be found in almost any favorable locality. These birds render  their floating nest a little more substantial than those of the  preceding varieties by the addition of mud which they bring up from the  bottom of the pond; this addition also tends to soil the eggs more,  consequently the eggs of this bird are, as a general rule, browner than  the other Grebes with the exception of the Least. The bird may always be  known by the shape of its bill which is higher than it is broad, and in  the summer is white with a black band across the middle. The throat is  also black at this season. They lay from five to nine eggs commencing  about the middle of May. Size 1.70 x 1.18.    [Illustration 017: Deep buff or rich brown.]  [Illustration: Mexican Grebe. Pied-billed Grebe.]  [Illustration: Deep buff.]  [Illustration: right-hand margin.]    Page 16    [Illustration 018: PIED-BILLED GREBE.]    Page 17    LOONS. Family GAVIIDAE    Loons may be likened to gigantic Grebes from which they differ  externally, chiefly in the full webbed foot instead of the individually  webbed toes of the Grebe, and in the sharper, more pointed and  spear-like bill. These birds are similar in their habits to the Grebes,  except that their homes are generally more substantially built and are  placed upon a solid foundation, generally upon an island in some inland  lake.    Both Loons and Grebes are literally \"Water witches,\" being practically,  and in the case of Grebes, actually, born in the water and living in it  ever afterwards. Loons are strong fliers, but like the Grebes, because  of their small wings they must get their first impetus from the water in  order to rise; in case there is any wind blowing they also make use of  this by starting their flight against it. They are very peculiar birds  and the expression \"crazy as a loon\" is not a fanciful one, being formed  from their early morning and evening antics when two or more of them  will race over the top of the water, up and down the lake, all the while  uttering their demoniacal laughter. They vie with the Grebes in diving  and disappear at the flash of a gun.    [Illustration 019: EGG OF LOON. Dark greenish brown.]  [Illustration: right hand margin.]    Page 18    7. LOON. _Gavia immer._    Range.--North America north of the Mexican boundary, breeding from the  northern parts of the United States northward.    Unlike the Grebes, Loons do not build in colonies, generally not more  than one, or at the most two pairs nesting on the same lake or pond;  neither do they seek the marshy sloughs in which Grebes dwell,  preferring the more open, clear bodies of water. The common Loon may be  known in summer by the entirely black head and neck with the complete  ribbon of black and white stripes encircling the lower neck and the  narrower one which crosses the throat. The back is spotted with white.  In some sections Loons build no nest, simply scooping a hollow out in  the sand, while in other places they construct quite a large nest of  sticks, moss and grasses. It is usually placed but a few feet from the  waters edge, so that at the least suspicion the bird can slide off its  eggs into the water, where it can cope with any enemy. The nests are  nearly always concealed under the overhanging bushes that line the  shore; the one shown in the full page illustration, however, was located  upon the top of an old muskrat house. The two eggs which they lay are a  very dark greenish brown in color, with black spots. Size 3.50 x 2.25.  Data.--Lake Sunapee, N. H., June 28, 1895. Nest placed under the bushes  at the waters edge. Made of rushes, weeds and grasses; a large structure  nearly three feet in diameter. Collector, H. A. Collins.      8. YELLOW-BILLED LOON. _Gavia adamsi._    Range.--Northwestern North America, along the Arctic and northern  Alaskan coasts.    The Yellow-billed Loon with the exception of its whitish or yellowish  bill in place of the black, is practically otherwise indistinguishable  from the common Loon. It averages somewhat larger in size. This is one  of the most northerly breeding birds and it is only within a very few  years that anything has been learned about the breeding habits. Their  nesting habits and eggs are precisely like the preceding except that the  latter average a little larger. Size 3.60 x 2.25.      9. BLACK-THROATED LOON. _Gavia arctica._.    Range.--From northern United States northward, breeding along the Arctic  Coast.    This species can be easily separated from the Loon by the gray crown and  white streaks down the back of the neck. Its size, too, is about five  inches shorter. The nesting habits are the same as the Loons and the  eggs have rather more of an olive tint besides having the majority of  spots at the larger end. Size 3.10 x 2.00.    [Illustration 020: Loon. Black-throated Loon.]  [Illustration: left-hand margin.]    Page 19    10. PACIFIC LOON. _Gavia pacifica._    Range.--Western North America along the coast chiefly, breeding from  Alaska south to British Columbia. In winter, south along the coast to  Mexico.    This species differs from the Black-throated only in the tint of the  head reflections. The habits are the same as those of the other members  of the family. They lay two eggs of a greenish brown or greenish gray  hue with black spots. Size 3.10 x 1.90."]]]
