[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/20763"],[0,"Carpentry for Boys (#16)"],[1,"  attempts to measure the different apartments, and with the floor plan  exactly square. Supposing we run a hall (A) through the middle. On one  side of this let us plan for a dining room and a kitchen, a portion of  the kitchen space to be given over to a closet and a bathroom.    [Illustration: _Fig. 221._]    The chimney (B) must be made accessible from both rooms. On the other  side of the hallway the space is divided into a parlor and two  bedrooms.    THE RECTANGULAR PLAN.--In the rectangular floor plan (Fig. 222) a  portion of the floor space is cut out for a porch (A), so that we may  use the end or the side for the entrance. Supposing we use the end of  the house for this purpose. The entrance room (B) may be a bedroom, or a  reception and living room, and to the rear of this room is the dining  room, connected with the reception room by a hall (C). This hall also  leads to the kitchen and to the bathroom, as well as to the other  bedroom. The parlor is connected with the entrance room (B), and also  with the bedroom. All of this is optional, of course.    [Illustration: _Fig. 222._]    There are also two chimneys, one chimney (D) having two flues and the  other chimney (E) having three flues, so that every room is  accommodated.    [Illustration: _Fig. 223._]    ROOM MEASUREMENTS.--We must now determine the dimensions of each room,  and then how we shall build the roof.    In Figs. 223 and 224, we have now drawn out in detail the sizes, the  locations of the door and windows, the chimneys and the closets, as well  as the bathroom. All this work may be changed or modified to suit  conditions and the taste of the designer.    [Illustration: _Fig. 224._]    FRONT AND SIDE LINES.--From the floor diagram, and the door and window  spaces, as marked out, we may now proceed to lay out rough front and  side outlines of the building. The ceilings are to be 9 feet, and if we  put a rather low-pitched roof on the square structure (Fig. 223) the  front may look something like Fig. 225, and a greater pitch given to the  rectangular plan (Fig. 224) will present a view as shown in Fig. 226.    [Illustration: _Fig. 225._]    [Illustration: _Fig. 226._]    THE ROOF.--The pitch of the roof (Fig. 225) is what is called \"third  pitch,\" and the roof (Fig. 226) has a half pitch. A \"third\" pitch is  determined as follows:    ROOF PITCH.--In Fig. 227 draw a vertical line (A) and join it by a  horizontal line (B). Then strike a circle (C) and step it off into three  parts. The line (D), which intersects the first mark (E) and the angle  of the lines (A, B), is the pitch.    In Fig. 228 the line A is struck at 15 degrees, which is halfway between  lines B and C, and it is, therefore, termed \"half-pitch.\"    [Illustration: _Fig. 227._]    [Illustration: _Fig. 228._]    Thus, we have made the ground plans, the elevations and the roofs as  simple as possible. Let us proceed next with the details of the  building.    THE FOUNDATION.--This may be of brick, stone or concrete, and its  dimensions should be at least 1-1/2 inches further out than the sill.    THE SILLS.--We are going to build what is called a \"balloon frame\"; and,  first, we put down the sills, which will be a course of 2\" x 6\", or 2\" x  8\" joists, as in Fig. 229.    THE FLOORING JOIST.--The flooring joists (A) are then put down (Fig.  230). These should extend clear across the house from side to side, if  possible, or, if the plan is too wide, they should be lapped at the  middle wall and spiked together. The ends should extend out flush with  the outer margins of the sills, as shown, but in putting down the first  and last sill, space must be left along the sides of the joist of  sufficient width to place the studding.    [Illustration: _Fig. 229._]    [Illustration: _Fig. 230._]    THE STUDDING.--The next step is to put the studding into position. 4\" x  4\" must be used for corners and at the sides of door and window  openings. 4\" x 6\" may be used at corners, if preferred. Consult your  plan and see where the openings are for doors and windows. Measure the  widths of the door and window frames, and make a measuring stick for  this purpose. You must leave at least one-half inch clearance for the  window or door frame, so as to give sufficient room to plumb and set the  frame.    SETTING UP.--First set up the corner posts, plumbing and bracing them.  Cut a top plate for each side you are working on.    [Illustration: _Fig. 231._]    THE PLATE.--As it will be necessary in our job to use two or more  lengths of 2\" x 4\" scantling for the plate, it will be necessary to join  them together. Do this with a lap-and-butt joint (Fig. 231).    Then set up the 4\" x 4\" posts for the sides of the doors and windows,  and for the partition walls.    The plate should be laid down on the sill, and marked with a pencil for  every scantling to correspond with the sill markings. The plate is then  put on and spiked to the 4\" x 4\" posts.    INTERMEDIATE STUDDING.--It will then be an easy matter to put in the  intermediate 2\" x 4\" studding, placing them as nearly as possible 16  inches apart to accommodate the 48-inch plastering lath.    [Illustration: _Fig. 232._]    WALL HEADERS.--When all the studding are in you will need headers above  and rails below the windows and headers above all the doors, so that you  will have timbers to nail the siding to, as well as for the lathing.    CEILING JOISTS.--We are now ready for the ceiling joists, which are,  usually, 2\" x 6\", unless there is an upper floor. These are laid 16  inches apart from center to center, preferably parallel with the floor  joist.    It should be borne in mind that the ceiling joist must always be put on  with reference to the roof.    Thus, in Fig. 232, the ceiling joists (A) have their ends resting on the  plate (B), so that the rafters are in line with the joists.    BRACES.--It would also be well, in putting up the studding, to use  plenty of braces, although for a one-story building this is not so  essential as in two-story structures, because the weather boarding  serves as a system of bracing.    [Illustration: _Fig. 233._]    THE RAFTERS.--These may be made to provide for the gutter or not, as may  be desired. They should be of 2\" x 4\" scantling.    THE GUTTER.--In Fig. 233 I show a most serviceable way to provide for  the gutter. A V-shaped notch is cut out of the upper side of the rafter,  in which is placed the floor and a side. This floor piece is raised at  one end to provide an incline for the water.    A face-board is then applied and nailed to the ends of the rafters. This  face-board is surmounted by a cap, which has an overhang, beneath which  is a molding of any convenient pattern. The face-board projects down at  least two inches below the angled cut of the rafter, so that when the  base-board is applied, the lower margin of the face-board will project  one inch below the base.    [Illustration: _Fig. 234._]    This base-board is horizontal, as you will see. The facia-board may be  of any desired width, and a corner molding should be added. It is  optional to use the brackets, but if added they should be spaced apart a  distance not greater than twice the height of the bracket.    A much simpler form of gutter is shown in Fig. 234, in which a V-shaped  notch is also cut in the rafter, and the channel is made by the pieces.  The end of the rafter is cut at right angles, so the face-board is at an  angle. This is also surmounted by an overhanging cap and a molding. The  base is nailed to the lower edges of the rafters, and the facia is then  applied.    [Illustration: _Fig. 234a._]    In Fig. 234_a_ the roof has no gutter, so that the end of the rafter is  cut off at an angle and a molding applied on the face-board. The base is  nailed to the rafters. This is the cheapest and simplest form of  structure for the roof.    SETTING DOOR AND WINDOW FRAMES.--The next step in order is to set the  door and window frames preparatory to applying the weather boarding. It  is then ready for the roof, which should be put on before the floor is  laid.    PLASTERING AND INSIDE FINISH.--Next in order is the plastering, then the  base-boards and the casing; and, finally, the door and windows should  be fitted into position.    Enough has been said here merely to give a general outline, with some  details, how to proceed with the work.          CHAPTER XII    BRIDGES, TRUSSED WORK AND LIKE STRUCTURES      BRIDGES.--Bridge building is not, strictly, a part of the carpenter's  education at the present day, because most structures of this kind are  now built of steel; but there are certain principles involved in bridge  construction which the carpenter should master.    SELF-SUPPORTING ROOFS.--In putting up, for instance, self-supporting  roofs, or ceilings with wide spans, and steeples or towers, the bridge  principle of trussed members should be understood.    The most simple bridge or trussed form is the well-known A-shaped arch.    [Illustration: _Fig. 235._]    COMMON TRUSSES.--One form is shown in Fig. 235, with a vertical king  post. In Fig. 236 there are two vertical supporting members, called  queen posts, used in longer structures. Both of these forms are equally  well adapted for small bridges or for roof supports.    THE VERTICAL UPRIGHT TRUSS.--This form of truss naturally develops into  a type of wooden bridge known all over the country, as its framing is  simple, and calculations as to its capacity to sustain loads may readily  be made. Figs. 237, 238 and 239 illustrate these forms.    [Illustration: _Fig. 236._]    [Illustration: _Fig. 237._]    THE WARREN GIRDER.--Out of this simple truss grew the Warren girder, a  type of bridge particularly adapted for iron and steel construction.    This is the simplest form for metal bridge truss, or girder. It is now  also largely used in steel buildings and for other work requiring  strength with small weight.

An individual chapter is devoted to each member of the Solar      System. Special space is given to \"Curiosities of the      Skies.\"        The illustrations are from photographs taken at the great      observatories. The drawings of Mars are the most recent      published, being made by Professor Lowell in January, 1914.        The chronological table and annotated bibliography are of      real value.      Sun Lore of All Ages    A Collection of Myths and Legends Concerning the Sun and its Worship    By William Tyler Olcott    Author of \"Star Lore of All Ages,\" \"A Field Book of the Stars,\" etc.    _8vo. With 30 Illustrations._        A companion volume to _Star Lore of All Ages_ by the same      author. It comprises a compilation of the myths, legends,      and facts concerning the sun, of equal interest to the      lay-reader or to the student.        The literature of the subject is teeming with interest,      linked as it is with the life story of mankind from the      cradle of the race to the present day, for the solar myth      lies at the very foundation of all mythology, and as such      must forever claim pre-eminence.        G.P. Putnam's Sons    New York      London      Astronomy in a Nutshell    The Chief Facts and Principles Explained in Popular Language for  General Readers and for Schools    By Garrett P. Serviss    _Cr. 8vo. With 47 Illustrations._        Presents the subject of astronomy in a succinct, popular      form. No mathematical knowledge beyond the simplest outlines      is assumed on the part of the reader. The great underlying      facts and principles of astronomy are presented in a shape      which any intelligent person can comprehend. The book may be      used either for self-instruction or for schools.      History of Astronomy    By George Forbes, M.A., F.R.S., M.Inst.C.E.    Formerly Professor of Natural Philosophy, Anderson's College, Glasgow    _16mo. Adequately Illustrated._    _No. 1. A History of the Science Series_        The author traces the evolution of intellectual thought in      the progress of astronomical discovery, recognizing the      various points of view of the different ages, giving due      credit even to the ancients. It has been necessary to      curtail many parts of the history, to lay before the reader      in unlimited space enough about each age to illustrate its      tone and spirit, the ideals of the workers, the gradual      addition of new points of view and of new means of      investigation.
