So it is relative. I would like to ask if  anyone had the same experience with the blossoms drying and falling off  the trees before that frost.    Mr. Crawford: Perhaps the gentleman will recall the fact we had two  nights in succession of quite severe frost. The first night it was  almost a freeze, and the second we had the snow storm which is given  credit for the plum failure.    Mr. Anderson: The gentleman who read the paper, he is from Winona, where  he has a very much better location for any kind of fruit than the  general run of the state. The other gentleman is from Illinois. Now,  this good location near Winona and the temperature down in Illinois,  does that favor the Surprise plum, and has it anything to do with their  success and our failure?    Pres. Cashman: We will have to leave that to the audience.    Mr. S.D. Richardson: Down in Winnebago I got three trees from the  originator of the Surprise plum, and while I was at the nursery I never  saw any plums, but I propagated some from there and a man in our town  has some Surprise plums from it, and since I left the nursery I think  the man has had some plums from them. I got them from Mr. Penning when  they were first originated, but they never bore plums for me. I had no  other plums around there. Perhaps if they need pollen from other plums  they didn't get it, and this man that has had the first success with  them he had other plums near them. Perhaps that is the secret. The tree  is hardy and good, and if you can get a crop of plums by having  something else to fertilize them, the Surprise plum is all right.    Pres. Cashman: I think Mr. Richardson has struck the keynote to a  certain extent, we must put them near another variety to pollenize them.          Northeast Demonstration Farm and Station.    W. J. THOMPSON, SUPT., DULUTH.      Last May the Station orchard was set out, the same consisting of about  516 apple trees with a fringe of cherries and plums. The apples  consisted of year old stock (purchased the year preceding and set in  nursery rows) and included these six varieties: Duchess, Patten's  Greening, Okabena, Wealthy, Hibernal, Anisim. Good growth was made the  past season and the stock went into winter quarters in good shape.  However, 20 per cent died, the loss being in this order: Wealthy,  Anisim, Hibernal, Pattens' Greening--Okabena and Duchess were tied for  smallest loss. In addition to the above, we made a considerable planting  of small fruits, principally currants and gooseberries, together with a  limited quantity of blackberries and raspberries. Twelve varieties of  strawberries were set out, each including 100 plants. All made a  splendid growth this season. An interesting test is under way in the  dynamiting work. Alternate trees have been set in blasted holes, a stick  about one and one-half inches long being sufficient to make a hole three  feet in diameter and perhaps twenty inches in depth. It is yet too early  to measure the results of this work, but owing to the nature of the  subsoil in this region, we are looking for splendid results. With regard  to the stock secured from the Fruit Farm, we have not been uniformly  successful. Much of the stock seems to be weak and dies readily from  some cause unknown to us. Next season we should be able to render a more  complete report, as our work will then be fairly started.          Annual Report, 1915, West Concord Trial Station.    FRED COWLES, SUPT., WEST CONCORD.      [Illustration: Fred Cowles at home.]    Of the new varieties of plums that I received from the Fruit-Breeding  Farm most all have done well. The only one that has borne is No. 21.  This one had two plums on last season, and several this. They were a  medium size red plum, very good flavor, and seem to come into bearing  very young. No. 17 is a very thrifty grower, but when it bears that will  tell what it is worth. Hansen's plums are doing well, but we believe  they are more adapted to a better drained soil than we have here, as we  are on a heavy prairie soil. But these varieties are very thrifty and  bear so young.    The grapes have all stood the winter with no protection and have not  killed back any. We expect some fruit next season.    The raspberries that we received have all done well. No. 4 seems to take  the lead for flavor and is a good grower.    Notwithstanding the cold season our strawberry crop was very good, and  we are much impressed with No. 3, it is so strong and healthy; it is  just the plant for the farmer, as it will thrive under most any  condition. I believe it will fight its way with the weeds and come out  ahead.    We reported very favorably on the Heritage when it was in bloom, but it  does not set enough fruit to pay for its space. The berries are large  but very few on my grounds. I will discard it.    Our apple crop was very good, especially Duchess, Wealthy and  Northwestern Greening. We have been trying some of the tender varieties  top-worked. Northern Spy gave us five nice apples on a two year graft.  We also have Jonathan, Talman Sweet and King David doing well. Delicious  grafted three years ago has not fruited yet.    This has been a splendid summer for flowers, and they seemed to enjoy  the damp, cool season, especially the dahlia. If you have not tried the  Countess of Lonsdale you should; it is a cactus dahlia and a very free  bloomer. Everblooming roses did well--we had them in October.           *       *       *       *       *    PLANT LICE ON BLOSSOMS.--Aphids infesting the apple buds  appeared in serious numbers during the present season in the Illinois  University orchards when the buds began to swell. They were also  observed in neighboring orchards. In 1914, apple aphids caused serious  damage in certain counties in Illinois, and some damage was reported  from many sections of the state.    The aphids attack the opening buds, the young fruits, the growing  shoots, and the leaves, sucking the plant juices from the succulent  parts by means of long, very slender, tube-like beaks, which they thrust  through the skins of the affected organs into the soft tissues beneath.  They weaken the blossom buds by removing the sap; they dwarf and deform  the apples so that varieties of ordinary size frequently fail to grow  larger than small crab apples, and the fruits have a puckered appearance  about the calyx end; they suck the juice from the growing shoots,  dwarfing them; and they cause the leaves to curl, and if the insects are  present in large numbers, to dry up and fall off. They are more  injurious to the growth of young trees than of old trees. In old trees  their chief injuries are on the fruit.    This species of aphids are easily killed in the adult stage by certain  contact sprays. Winter applications of lime sulphur cannot be depended  on to destroy eggs. Poison sprays such as arsenate of lead are not eaten  by this type of insect, and consequently are ineffective remedies for  aphids. Kerosene emulsion is effective but is uncertain in its effect on  the foliage of the trees. The best available sprays are the tobacco  decoctions, of which the one most widely in use is \"Black Leaf 40,\" a  proprietary tobacco extract, made by the Kentucky Tobacco Products  Company, Louisville, Kentucky. This material is used at the rate of one  gallon in one thousand gallons of spray. It may be combined with lime  sulphur, lime sulphur arsenate of lead, Bordeaux, or Bordeaux arsenate  of lead, not with arsenate of lead alone.    The ideal time to spray for these aphids is just as soon as all or  nearly all the eggs appear to have hatched. Observations made in the  University orchards this season indicate that all the eggs hatched  before the blossom buds began to separate. After the leaves expand  somewhat and the blossom buds separate, the aphids are provided with  more hiding places and are more difficult to hit with the spray.  Unfortunately, spraying at this time would require an extra application  in addition to the cluster bud (first summer) spray (made for scab,  curculio, bud moth, spring canker worms, etc.), and would thus add  seriously to the cost of the season's operations. Spraying for aphids at  the time of the cluster bud spray is, however, highly effective, and in  general it is advised that this method be followed. If, however,  previous experience has shown serious losses from aphids, or if they are  present in extremely large numbers, the extra application may be well  worth while.--Ill. Agri. Exp. Station.          Annual Report, 1915, Duluth Trial Station.    C. E. ROWE, SUPT., DULUTH.      [Illustration: A rosa rugosa hybrid rose grown by C. E. Rowe, Duluth.]    Although this was an off year for apples, results were probably as good  here as in other sections of the state. The spring gave promise of an  unusual crop, but the constant dropping of fruit during the summer  months left us with about two-thirds as many apples as were harvested in  1914. The quality was much poorer, owing to extremely cool weather and  the presence of scab in many localities.    The plum crop failed almost completely, and many trees were injured from  aphis attacks. I have never known the aphis so hard to control as they  were last summer.    Nearly all fruit trees made an excellent growth this season, and the new  wood was well ripened when the freeze-up came. The fall rains provided  plenty of moisture, and our trees should come through the winter in  excellent shape.    Raspberries and currants produced about one-half the usual crop this  year, probably owing to our May freeze.    Strawberries were almost a failure, largely due to winter-killing. Last  winter did more damage to perennial plants than any other winter within  the recollection of the writer. The fall was rather dry, and our snow  covering did not come until January.

The pathetic story of Jephthah's daughter is the most  conspicuous example. This warrior had promised to sacrifice to Jehovah  whatever first came out to meet him, if he returned victorious from  war. Alas, it was his own daughter! Yet he did not dare to break his  vow.    The story of Abraham and Isaac also proves that human sacrifices to  Jehovah were not unknown among the Hebrews. In this story Jehovah  finally intervenes and allows Abraham to offer up a ram instead of his  own son. Yet the story implies the belief that Jehovah might demand of  a father that he kill his own son and burn him on the altar. These  ideas continued to be believed even down to the time of the prophets,  Amos and Hosea, and the others about whom we will study.      THE PROPHET MICAH AND HIS MESSAGE    About the time that Hosea was finishing his sad career in the north  another prophet in the south caught up the torch of light and truth.  His name was Micah. Like the two great men who preceded him, Amos and  Hosea, his heart was stirred to pity and indignation by the sufferings  of the poor and by the injustice and luxury of the rich and powerful.  In plain, direct, and fiery sentences he denounced these evils and  foretold punishment. Because of these things, he declared that  \"Jerusalem shall become heaps, and the mountain of the house as the  high places of a forest.\"    Micah was especially bitter against those men who made religion their  business, and used it as a means of oppressing the poor--the prophets  who proclaim a holy war against those \"who put not into their mouths,\"  that is, those who do not give them presents. The priests, Micah says,  \"teach for hire, and the prophets thereof divine for money.\"    =Micah's great message.=--It was, of course, the existence of  superstitious fears in the hearts of the people which made it possible  for the priests and the prophets to join with the rich nobles in  preying upon them. \"You give me this or that,\" \"You pay for this  sacrifice or that--or I will call down a curse upon you from Jehovah.  Some dreadful misfortune will come upon you.\" With one great word  whose throbbing pity for the ignorance and sorrow of men makes it  another of the great utterances of human lips, Micah cut the root of  all such fears. Jehovah is not that kind of a God, he declared. He  does not break out in fits of rage. He does not need to be wheedled  back into good nature by costly offerings, perhaps even sometimes with  the costliest offerings of all, one's own darling children.        =\"Wherewith shall I come before the Lord, and bow myself      before the high God? Shall I come before him with      burnt-offerings, with calves of a year old? Will the Lord be      pleased with thousands of rams, or with ten thousands of      rivers of oil? shall I give my first-born for my      transgression, the fruit of my body for the sin of my soul?      He hath showed thee, O man, what is good; and what doth the      Lord require of thee, but to do justly, and to love mercy,      and to walk humbly with thy God.\"=      STUDY TOPICS    1. Read the stories of the ark, referred to in this chapter. See 1  Samuel 6. 1-20; 2 Samuel 6. 1-9. What other way of explaining the  death of Uzzah and of the men of Beth-shemesh occurs to you rather  than the anger of Jehovah? In the case of the men of Beth-shemesh,  read 1 Samuel 5, with its clear indications of contagious disease.    2. How has modern science helped to free mankind from the curse of  superstitious fear?    3. Look up Micah in the Bible dictionary, and find out all you can  about his personal history and work.    4.

CHAPTER XVIII    ONE JUST GOD OVER ALL PEOPLES      THE MESSAGE OF ISAIAH    The destruction of the northern kingdom by the Assyrian armies struck  fear into the hearts of the Hebrews of the sister kingdom in the  south. No one had dreamed that such a thing could happen. It is true  that from the beginning of the terrible onrush the Assyrians had been  almost irresistible. All the little nations which had stood in their  way had been swallowed up.    Moreover, the prophets Amos and Hosea had plainly foretold that some  such calamity would be sent upon Israelites by Jehovah on account of  their sins. But very few of them believed these brave and lonely  preachers of the truth. \"Jehovah send the Assyrians against us! Why,  that is absurd! We are Jehovah's people, and he is our God. What has  he to do with the Assyrians? He may chastise us, but not by sending  foreign armies to conquer us. What would he do if we should be  conquered? He would have no nation to worship him.\" So they reasoned.    =Jehovah too weak to protect his people?=--When, therefore, the  Assyrians actually did come marching down from the Euphrates River,  hundreds of thousands of them with their gleaming armor and their  multitudes of horses and war chariots, and besieged and captured the  city of Samaria, leaving it a ruin, most of the Hebrews, north and  south, were sick with fear and bewilderment. For them with their false  notions it could mean only one thing: their God, Jehovah, was too  weak to protect his people against the greater gods of Nineveh. The  Assyrians said to them:        =\"Let not thy God in whom thou trusteth deceive thee, saying,      Jerusalem shall not be given into the hand of the king of      Assyria. Behold, thou hast heard what the kings of Assyria      have done to all lands, by destroying them utterly: and shalt      thou be delivered? Have the gods of the nations delivered      them?... Where is the king of Hamath, and the king of Arpad,      and the king of the city of Sepharvaim?\"=    Against such taunts as these, the Hebrews, with their mistaken  beliefs, could bring no answer.      THE CRAZE FOR FOREIGN GODS    With their faith in Jehovah breaking down there was a great running  here and there after other gods and strange religions. Instead of  trusting quietly in Jehovah's watchful care many of the people  resorted in their terror to soothsayers and mediums, to \"wizards that  chirp and mutter.\" Jerusalem seems to have become almost as full of  them as the cities of the Philistines, which had always been famous  for their fortune-tellers and necromancers.    =Alliances with other nations.=--Another favorite way of seeking  safety was through alliances with other nations and their gods.  According to the beliefs of that age, when two nations made an  alliance their gods were included in it. To overcome the Assyrians,  therefore, it would be necessary to make an alliance with some other  nation whose gods were very powerful. So the people of Jehovah began  to \"strike hands with the children of foreigners.\" The rulers of  Jerusalem set about making coalitions with the other nations of  western Asia: with the Philistines, the Syrians, the Phoenicians and,  most of all, the Egyptians. The gods of the Egyptians were supposed to  be especially strong: Osiris and Isis were the chief of their deities  and they were believed to be the gods of the underworld--of Sheol, or  Hades, the abode of the dead. So when these poor ignorant politicians  at Jerusalem finally did succeed in arranging for an alliance with the  crafty and deceitful kings of Egypt they said to themselves: \"Now we  are safe. The Assyrians cannot hurt us now. We have made a covenant  with Death.\"      THE STATESMAN-PROPHET, ISAIAH    It is good to know that among many misguided people there was one man  whose wisdom of the eternal Truth of God made him stand like a rock  while the multitudes ran to and fro in uncertainty and despair. Isaiah  was a comrade and co-worker in spirit with the prophets named in the  three preceding chapters, Amos, Hosea, and Micah. It is by no means  impossible that he had listened to the sermons of Hosea, and thus  caught from him his inspiration. He must certainly have known Micah  personally, for they lived and preached only some twenty-five or  thirty miles apart--Micah in the village of Moresheth and Isaiah in  the city of Jerusalem.    =Isaiah's message.=--Isaiah's special message to his people was that  all the nations of the world are subject to the righteous rule of the  God of righteousness, Jehovah; and that the attempt to find safety for  their nation by alliances with other nations and their gods was  utterly foolish and wrong. Undoubtedly this message found a response  in the hearts of those who remained faithful to Jehovah.    This message grew out of the great and splendid ideas as to Jehovah's  character which Amos and his successors had been working out: that he  was a God of righteousness and love, not greedy for burnt-offerings,  not flaring up into fits of anger, and needing to be soothed and  mollified by peace offerings; but a God who asks only for justice and  fair-dealing among men, and for true love in response to his own.  Isaiah repeated these great truths to his own people in Jerusalem in  glowing words whose eloquence is unsurpassed. For example:        =\"Wash you, make you clean; put away the evil of your doings      from before mine eyes; cease to do evil; learn to do well;      seek judgment; relieve the oppressed, judge the fatherless,      plead for the widow....=        =\"I will turn my hand upon thee, and will thoroughly purge      away thy dross, and will take away all thy tin: and I will      restore thy judges as at the first, and thy counselors as at      the beginning: afterward thou shalt be called the city of      righteousness, the faithful city.\"=    =Isaiah's originality.=--The prophets and leaders who came before  Isaiah had not fully grasped the idea of a God of all nations instead  of one. Amos and Hosea had only caught"]]]
