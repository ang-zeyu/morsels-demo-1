I now give you this  young man for food.\"    He then uttered the charm to his canoe, and it shot out of sight,  leaving Owasso to make his peace the best way he could.    The gulls flew in immense numbers around him, and were ready to devour  him. Owasso did not lose his presence of mind, but he addressed them and  said:    \"Gulls, you know you were not formed to eat human flesh, nor was man  made to be the prey of birds. Obey my words. Fly close together, a  sufficient number of you, and carry me on your backs to the magician's  lodge.\"    They listened attentively to what he said, and seeing nothing  unreasonable in his request, they obeyed him, and Owasso soon found  himself sailing through the air swiftly homeward.    Meanwhile, it appears that the old magician had fallen asleep and  allowed his canoe to come to a stand-still; for Owasso, in his flight  over the lake, saw him lying on his back in the boat, taking a nap,  which was quite natural, as the day was very soft and balmy.    As Owasso, with his convoy of birds, passed over, he let fall, directly  in the face of the old magician, a capful of gulls' eggs, which broke  and so besmeared his eyes that he could barely see. He jumped up and  exclaimed:    \"It is always so with these thoughtless birds. They never consider where  they drop their eggs.\"    Owasso had flown on and reached the lodge in safety, and, excusing  himself for the liberty, he killed two or three of the gulls for the  sake of their feathers to ornament his son's head.    When the magician arrived, soon after, his grandson came out to meet  him, tossing his head about as the feathers danced and struggled with  the wind.    \"Where did you get these?\" asked the Manito, \"and who brought them?\"    \"My father brought them,\" the boy replied.    The old magician was quite distressed in his mind that he had not  destroyed his son-in-law. He entered his lodge in silence, and set his  wits busily at work again to contrive some plan for easing his feelings  in that respect.    He could not help saying to himself:    \"What manner of boy is this who is ever escaping from my power? But his  guardian spirit shall not save him. I will entrap him to-morrow. Ha, ha,  ha!\"    He was painfully aware that he had tried two of his charms without  effect, and that he had but two more left. He now professed to be more  friendly with his son-in-law than ever, and the very next day he said to  Owasso:    \"Come, my son, you must go with me to procure some young eagles. We  will tame them, and have them for pets about the lodge. I have  discovered an island where they are in great abundance.\"    They started on the trip, and when, after traversing an immense waste of  water, they had reached the island, Mishosha led him inland until they  came to the foot of a tall pine-tree, upon which the nests were to be  found.    \"Now, my son,\" said Mishosha, \"climb up this tree and bring down the  birds. I think you will get some fine ones up there.\"    Owasso obeyed. When he had with great difficulty got near the nest,  Mishosha cried out, addressing himself to the tree, and without much  regard to the wishes of Owasso:    \"Now stretch yourself up and be very tall.\"    The tree, at this bidding, rose up so far that Owasso would have  imperiled his neck by any attempt to get to the ground.    \"Listen, ye eagles!\" continued Mishosha. \"You have long expected a gift  from me. I now present you this boy, who has had the presumption to  climb up where you are to molest your young. Stretch forth your claws  and seize him.\"    So saying, the old magician, according to his custom in such cases,  turned his back upon Owasso, and going off in his canoe at a word, he  left his son-in-law to shift for himself.    But the birds did not seem to be so badly-minded as the old magician had  supposed; for a very old bald eagle, quite corpulent and large of limb,  alighting on a branch just opposite, opened conversation with him by  asking what had brought him there.    Owasso replied that he had not mounted the tree of himself, or out of  any disposition to harm his people; that his father-in-law, the old  magician who had just left them, had sent him up; that he was constantly  sending him on mischievous errands. In a word, the young man was  enlarging at great length upon the character of the wicked Manito, when  he was interrupted by being darted upon by a hungry-eyed bird, with long  claws.    Owasso, not in the least disconcerted, boldly seized this fierce eagle  by the neck and dashed it against the rocks, crying out:    \"Thus will I deal with all who come near me.\"    The old eagle, who appeared to be the head of the tribe, was so pleased  with this show of spirit that he immediately appointed two tall birds,  uncommonly strong in the wings, to transport Owasso to his lodge. They  were to take turns in conducting him through the air.    Owasso expressed many obligations to the old eagle for his kindness, and  they forthwith set out. It was a high point from which they started, for  the pine-tree had shot far, far up toward the clouds, and they could  even descry the enchanted island where the old magician lived; though it  was miles and miles away. For this point they steered their flight; and  in a short time they landed Owasso at the door of the lodge.    With many compliments for their dispatch, Owasso dismissed the birds,  and stood ready to greet his wicked father-in-law who now arrived; and  when he espied his son-in-law still unharmed, Mishosha grew very black  in the face. He had but a single charm left.    He thought he would ponder deeply how he could employ that to the best  advantage; and it happened that while he was doing so, one evening, as  Owasso and his wife were sitting on the banks of the lake, and the soft  breeze swept over it, they heard a song, as if sung by some one at a  great distance. The sound continued for some time, and then died away in  perfect stillness. \"Oh, it is the voice of Sheem,\" cried Owasso. \"It is  the voice of my brother! If I could but only see him!\" And he hung down  his head in deep anguish.    His wife witnessed his distress, and to comfort him she proposed that  they should attempt to make their escape, and carry him succor on the  morrow.    When the morning came, and the sun shone warmly into the lodge, the wife  of Owasso offered to comb her father's hair, with the hope that it  would soothe him to sleep. It had that effect; and they no sooner saw  him in deep slumber than they seized the magic canoe, Owasso uttered the  charmed words, \"Chemaun Poll!\" and they glided away upon the water  without need of oar or sail.    They had nearly reached the land on the opposite side of the lake, and  could distinctly hear the voice of the younger brother singing his  lament as before, when the old magician wakened. Missing his daughter  and her husband, he suspected deception of some kind; he looked for his  magic boat and found it gone. He spoke the magic words, which were more  powerful from him than from any other person in the world, and the canoe  immediately returned; to the sore disappointment of Owasso and his wife.    When they came back to the shore, Mishosha stood upon the beach and drew  up his canoe. He did not utter a word. The son-in-law and daughter  entered the lodge in silence.    The time, walking along in its broad open path, brought the autumn  months to a close, and the winter had set in. Soon after the first fall  of snow, Owasso said:    \"Father, I wish to try my skill in hunting. It is said there is plenty  of game not far off, and it can now be easily tracked. Let us go.\"    The magician consented; they set out, and arriving at a good ground for  their sport, they spent the day in hunting. Night coming on, they built  themselves a lodge of pine-branches to sleep in. Although it was  bitterly cold, the young man took off his leggings and moccasins, and  hung them up to dry. The old magician did the same, carefully hanging  his own in a separate place, and they lay down to sleep.    Owasso, from a glance he had given, suspected that the magician had a  mind to play him a trick, and to be beforehand with him, he watched an  opportunity to get up and change the moccasins and leggings, putting his  own in the place of Mishosha's, and depending on the darkness of the  lodge to help him through.    Near daylight, the old magician bestirred himself, as if to rekindle the  fire; but he slyly reached down a pair of moccasins and leggings with a  stick, and thinking they were no other than those of Owasso's, he  dropped them into the flames; while he cast himself down, and affected  to be lost in a heavy sleep. The leather leggings and moccasins soon  drew up and were burned.    Instantly jumping up and rubbing his eyes, Mishosha cried out:    \"Son-in-law, your moccasins are burning; I know it by the smell.\"    Owasso rose up, deliberately and unconcerned.    \"No, my friend,\" said he, \"here are mine,\" at the same time taking them  down and drawing them on. \"It is your moccasins that are burning.\"    Mishosha dropped his head upon his breast. All his tricks were played  out--there was not so much as half a one left to help him out of the  sorry plight he was in.    \"I believe, my grandfather,\" added Owasso, \"that this is the moon in  which fire attracts, and I fear you must have set your foot and leg  garments too near the fire, and they have been drawn in. Now let us go  forth to the hunt.\"    The old magician was compelled to follow him, and they pushed out into a  great storm of snow, and hail, and wind, which had come on over night;  and neither the wind, the hail, nor the snow, had the slightest respect  for the bare limbs of the old magician, for there was not the least  virtue of magic in those parts of old Mishosha's body. After a while  they quite stiffened under him, his body became hard, and the hair"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/2225"],[0,"\"Captains Courageous\": A Story of the Grand Banks (#16)"],[1," it?\" said the man-o'war's man, stuffing his  pipe; and Harvey had another mystery of the deep sea to brood upon.        CHAPTER VI    The thing that struck him most was the exceedingly casual way in which  some craft loafed about the broad Atlantic. Fishing-boats, as Dan said,  were naturally dependent on the courtesy and wisdom of their  neighbours; but one expected better things of steamers. That was after  another interesting interview, when they had been chased for three  miles by a big lumbering old cattle-boat, all boarded over on the upper  deck, that smelt like a thousand cattle-pens. A very excited officer  yelled at them through a speaking-trumpet, and she lay and lollopped  helplessly on the water while Disko ran the \"We're Here\" under her lee  and gave the skipper a piece of his mind. \"Where might ye be--eh? Ye  don't deserve to be anywheres. You barn-yard tramps go hoggin' the road  on the high seas with no blame consideration fer your neighbours, an'  your eyes in your coffee-cups instid o' in your silly heads.\"    At this the skipper danced on the bridge and said something about  Disko's own eyes. \"We haven't had an observation for three days. D'you  suppose we can run her blind?\" he shouted.    \"Wa-al, I can,\" Disko retorted. \"What's come to your lead'? Et it'?  Can't ye smell bottom, or are them cattle too rank?\"    \"What d'ye feed 'em?\" said Uncle Salters with intense seriousness, for  the smell of the pens woke all the farmer in him. \"They say they fall  off dretful on a v'yage. Dunno as it's any o' my business, but I've a  kind o' notion that oil-cake broke small an' sprinkled--\"    \"Thunder!\" said a cattle-man in a red jersey as he looked over the  side. \"What asylum did they let His Whiskers out of?\"    \"Young feller,\" Salters began, standing up in the fore-rigging, \"let me  tell yeou 'fore we go any further that I've--\"    The officer on the bridge took off his cap with immense politeness.  \"Excuse me,\" he said, \"but I've asked for my reckoning. If the  agricultural person with the hair will kindly shut his head, the  sea-green barnacle with the wall-eye may perhaps condescend to  enlighten us.\"    \"Naow you've made a show o' me, Salters,\" said Disko, angrily. He could  not stand up to that particular sort of talk, and snapped out the  latitude and longitude without more lectures.    \"'Well, that's a boat-load of lunatics, sure,\" said the skipper, as he  rang up the engine-room and tossed a bundle of newspapers into the  schooner.    \"Of all the blamed fools, next to you, Salters, him an' his crowd are  abaout the likeliest I've ever seen,\" said Disko as the \"We're Here\"  slid away. \"I was jest givin' him my jedgment on lullsikin' round these  waters like a lost child, an' you must cut in with your fool farmin'.  Can't ye never keep things sep'rate?\"    Harvey, Dan, and the others stood back, winking one to the other and  full of joy; but Disko and Salters wrangled seriously till evening,  Salters arguing that a cattle-boat was practically a barn on blue  water, and Disko insisting that, even if this were the case, decency  and fisher-pride demanded that he should have kept \"things sep'rate.\"  Long Jack stood it in silence for a time,--an angry skipper makes an  unhappy crew,--and then he spoke across the table after supper:    \"Fwhat's the good o' bodderin' fwhat they'll say?\" said he.    \"They'll tell that tale ag'in' us fer years--that's all,\" said Disko.  \"Oil-cake sprinkled!\"    \"With salt, o' course,\" said Salters, impenitent, reading the farming  reports from a week-old New York paper.    \"It's plumb mortifyin' to all my feelin's,\" the skipper went on.    \"Can't see ut that way,\" said Long Jack, the peacemaker. \"Look at here,  Disko! Is there another packet afloat this day in this weather c'u'd  ha' met a tramp an', over an' above givin' her her reckonin',--over an'  above that, I say,--c'u'd ha' discoorsed wid her quite intelligent on  the management av steers an' such at sea'? Forgit ut! Av coorse they  will not. 'Twas the most compenjus conversation that iver accrued.  Double game an' twice runnin'--all to us.\" Dan kicked Harvey under the  table, and Harvey choked in his cup.    \"'Well,\" said Salters, who felt that his honour had been somewhat  plastered, \"I said I didn't know as 'twuz any business o' mine, 'fore I  spoke.\"    \"An' right there,\" said Tom Platt, experienced in discipline and  etiquette--\"right there, I take it, Disko, you should ha' asked him to  stop ef the conversation wuz likely, in your jedgment, to be  anyways--what it shouldn't.\"    \"Dunno but that's so,\" said Disko, who saw his way to an honourable  retreat from a fit of the dignities.    \"'Why, o' course it was so,\" said Salters, \"you bein' skipper here; an'  I'd cheerful hev stopped on a hint--not from any leadin' or conviction,  but fer the sake o' bearin' an example to these two blame boys of  aours.\"    \"Didn't I tell you, Harve, 'twould come araound to us 'fore we'd done'?  Always those blame boys. But I wouldn't have missed the show fer a  half-share in a halibutter,\" Dan whispered.    \"Still, things should ha' been kep' sep'rate,\" said Disko, and the  light of new argument lit in Salters's eye as he crumbled cut plug into  his pipe.    \"There's a power av vartue in keepin' things sep'rate,\" said Long Jack,  intent on stilling the storm. \"That's fwhat Steyning of Steyning and  Hare's f'und when he sent Counahan fer skipper on the Marilla D. Kuhn,  instid o' Cap. Newton that was took with inflam't'ry rheumatism an'  couldn't go. Counahan the Navigator we called him.\"    \"Nick Counahan he never went aboard fer a night 'thout a pond o' rum  somewheres in the manifest,\" said Tom Platt, playing up to the lead.  \"He used to bum araound the c'mission houses to Boston lookin' fer the  Lord to make him captain of a towboat on his merits. Sam Coy, up to  Atlantic Avenoo, give him his board free fer a year or more on account  of his stories. Counahan the Navigator! Tck! Tck! Dead these fifteen  year, ain't he?\"    \"Seventeen, I guess. He died the year the Caspar McVeagh was built; but  he could niver keep things sep'rate. Steyning tuk him fer the reason  the thief tuk the hot stove--bekaze there was nothin' else that season.  The men was all to the Banks, and Counahan he whacked up an iverlastin'  hard crowd fer crew. Rum! Ye c'u'd ha' floated the Marilla, insurance  and all, in fwhat they stowed aboard her. They lef' Boston Harbour for  the great Grand Bank wid a roarin' nor'wester behind 'em an' all hands  full to the bung. An' the hivens looked after thim, for divil a watch  did they set, an' divil a rope did they lay hand to, till they'd seen  the bottom av a fifteen-gallon cask o' bug-juice. That was about wan  week, so far as Counahan remembered. (If' I c'u'd only tell the tale as  he told ut!) All that whoile the wind blew like ould glory, an' the  Marilla--'twas summer, and they'd give her a foretopmast--struck her  gait and kept ut. Then Counahan tuk the hog-yoke an' thrembled over it  for a whoile, an' made out, betwix' that an' the chart an' the singin'  in his head, that they was to the south'ard o' Sable Island, gettin'  along glorious, but speakin' nothin'. Then they broached another keg,  an' quit speculatin' about anythin' fer another spell. The Marilla she  lay down whin she dropped Boston Light, and she never lufted her  lee-rail up to that time--hustlin' on one an' the same slant. But they  saw no weed, nor gulls, nor schooners; an' prisintly they obsarved  they'd been out a matter o' fourteen days, and they mistrusted the Bank  had suspinded payment. So they sounded, an' got sixty fathom. 'That's  me,' sez Counahan. 'That's me iv'ry time! I've run her slat on the Bank  fer you, an' when we get thirty fathom we'll turn in like little men.  Counahan is the b'y,' sez he. 'Counahan the Navigator!'    \"Nex' cast they got ninety. Sez Counahan: 'Either the lead-line's tuk  too stretchin' or else the Bank's sunk.'    \"They hauled ut up, bein' just about in that state when ut seemed right  an' reasonable, and sat down on the deck countin' the knots, an'  gettin' her snarled up hijjus. The Marilla she'd struck her gait, and  she hild ut, an' prisintly along come a tramp, an' Counahan spoke her.    \"'Hey ye seen any fishin'-boats now?' sez he, quite casual.    \"'There's lashin's av them off the Irish coast,' sez the tramp.    \"Aah! go shake yerself,' sez Counahan. 'Fwhat have I to do wid the  Irish coast?'    \"'Then fwhat are ye doin' here?' sez the tramp.    \"'Sufferin' Christianity!' sez Counahan (he always said that whin his  pumps sucked an' he was not feelin' good)--'Sufferin' Christianity!' he  sez, 'where am I at?' \"'Thirty-five mile west-sou'west o' Cape Clear,'  sez the tramp, 'if that's any consolation to you.'    \"Counahan fetched wan jump, four feet sivin inches, measured by the  cook.    \"'Consolation!' sez he, bould ez brass. 'D'ye take me fer a dialect?  Thirty-five mile from Cape Clear, an' fourteen days from Boston Light.  Sufferin' Christianity, 'tis a record, an' by the same token I've a  mother to Skibbereen!' Think av ut! The gall av um! But ye see he could  niver keep things sep'rate.    \"The crew was mostly Cork an' Kerry men, barrin' one Marylander that  wanted to go back, but they called him a mutineer, an' they ran the  ould Marilla into Skibbereen, an' they had an illigant time visitin'  around with frinds on the ould sod fer a week. Thin they wint back, an'  it cost 'em two an' thirty days to beat to the Banks again. 'Twas  gettin' on towards fall, and grub was low, so Counahan ran her back to  Boston, wid no more bones to ut.\"    \"And what did the firm say?\" Harvey demanded.    \"Fwhat could they'? The fish was on the Banks, an' Counahan was at  T-wharf talkin' av his record trip east! They tuk their satisfaction  out av that, an' ut all came av not keepin' the crew and the rum  sep'rate in the first place; an' confusin' Skibbereen wid 'Queereau, in  the second."]]]
