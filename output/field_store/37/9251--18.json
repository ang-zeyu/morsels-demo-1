They looked  in at the open door and snorted at the cheerlessness of the place.    \"Why don't you come back here and stay?\" the Kid demanded. \"I was going  to sleep down here with you--and now Doctor Dell won't let me. These  hobees are no good. They're damn' bone-head. Daddy Chip says so. I wish  you'd come back, so I can sleep with you. One man's named Ole and he's  got a funny eye that looks at the other one all the time. I wish you'd  come back.\"    The Happy Family wished the same thing, but they did not say so. Instead  they told the Kid to ask his mother if he couldn't come and visit them  in their new shacks, and promised indulgences that would have shocked  the Little Doctor had she heard them. So they went on to the house,  where the Old Man sat on the porch looking madder than when they had  left him three weeks before.    \"Why don't yuh run them nesters outa the country?\" he demanded peevishly  when they were close enough for speech. \"Here they come and accuse me  to my face of trying to defraud the gov'ment. Doggone you boys, what  you think you're up to, anyway? What's three or four thousand acres when  they're swarming in here like flies to a butcherin'? They can't make a  living--serve 'em right. What you doggone rowdies want now?\"    Not a cordial welcome, that--if they went no deeper than his words. But  there was the old twinkle back of the querulousness in the Old Man's  eyes, and the old pucker of the lips behind his grizzled whiskers.  \"You've got that doggone Kid broke to foller yuh so we can't keep him  on the ranch no more,\" he added fretfully. \"Tried to run away twice,  on Silver. Chip had to go round him up. Found him last time pretty near  over to Antelope coulee, hittin' the high places for town. Might as well  take yuh back, I guess, and save time running after the Kid.\"    \"We've got to hold down our claims,\" Weary minded him regretfully. In  three weeks, he could see a difference the Old Man, and the change hurt  him.    Lines were deeper drawn, and the kind old eyes were a shade more sunken.    \"What's that amount to?\" grumbled the Old Man, looking from one to the  other under his graying eye brows. \"You can't stop them dry-farmers from  taking the country. Yuh might as well try to dip the Missouri dry with a  bucket. They'll flood the country with stock--\"    \"No, they won't,\" put in Big Medicine, impatient for the real meat of  their errand. \"By cripes, we got a scheme to beat that--you tell 'im,  Weary.\"    \"We want to buy a bunch of cattle from you,\" Weary said obediently. \"We  want to graze our claims, instead of trying to crop the land. We haven't  any fence up, so we'll have to range-herd our stock, of course. I--don't  hardly think any nester stock will get by us, J. G. And seeing our land  runs straight through from Meeker's line fence to yours, we kinda think  we've got the nesters pretty well corralled. They're welcome to the  range between Antelope coulee and Dry Lake, far as we're concerned. Soon  as we can afford it,\" he added tranquilly, \"we'll stretch a fence along  our west line that'll hold all the darn milkcows they've a mind to ship  out here.\"    \"Huh!\" The Old Man studied them quizzically, his chin on his chest.    \"How many yuh want?\" he asked abruptly.    \"All you'll sell us. We want to give mortgages, with the stock for  security.\"    \"Oh, yuh do, ay? What if I have to foreclose on yuh?\" The pucker of his  lips grew more pronounced. \"Where do you git off at, then?\"    \"Well, we kinda thought we could fix it up to save part of the increase  outa the wreck, anyway.\"    \"Oh. That's it ay?\" He studied them another minute. \"You'll want all my  best cows, too, I reckon--all that grade stock I shipped in last spring.  Ay?\"    \"We wouldn't mind,\" grinned Weary, glancing at the others roosting at  ease along the edge of the porch.    \"Think you could handle five-hundred head--the pick uh the bunch?\"    \"Sure, we could! We'd rather split 'em up amongst us, though--let every  fellow buy so many. We can throw in together on the herding.\"    \"Think you can keep the milk-cows between you and Dry Lake, ay?\" The Old  Man chuckled--the first little chuckle since the Happy Family left him  so unceremoniously three weeks before. \"How about that, Pink?\"    \"Why, I think we can,\" chirped Pink cheerfully.    \"Huh! Well, you're the toughest bunch, take yuh up one side and down  the other, I ever seen keep onta jail--I guess maybe you can do it. But  lemme tell you boys something--and I want you to remember it: You don't  want to git the idea in your heads you're going to have any snap; you  ain't. If I know B from a bull's foot, you've got your work cut out for  yuh. I've been keeping cases pretty close on this dry-farm craze, and  this stampede for claims. Folks are land crazy. They've got the idea  that a few acres of land is going to make 'em free and independent--and  it don't matter much what the land is, or where it is. So long as it's  land, and they can git it from the government for next to nothing,  they're satisfied. And yuh want to remember that. Yuh don't want to take  it for granted they're going to take a look at your deadline and back  up. If they ship in stock, they're going to see to it that stock don't  starve. You'll have to hold off men and women that's making their last  stand, some of 'em, for a home of their own. They ain't going to give  up if they can help it. You get a man with his back agin the wall, and  he'll fight till he drops. I don't need to tell yuh that.\"    The Happy Family listened to him soberly, their eyes staring broodily at  the picture he conjured.    \"Well, by golly, we're makin' our last stand, too,\" Slim blurted with  his customary unexpectedness. \"Our back's agin the wall right now. If we  can't hold 'em back from takin' what little range is left, this outfit's  going under. We got to hold 'em, by golly, er there won't be no more  Flying U.\"    \"Well,\" said Andy Green quietly, \"that's all right. We're going to hold  'em.\"    The Old Man lifted his bent head and looked from one to another. Pride  shone in his eyes, that had lately stared resentment. \"Yuh know, don't  yuh, the biggest club they can use?\" He leaned forward a little, his  lips working under his beard.    \"Sure, we know. We'll look out for that.\" Weary smiled hearteningly.    \"We want a good lawyer to draw up those mortgages,\" put in the Native  Son lazily. \"And we'll pay eight per cent. interest.\"    \"Doggonedest crazy bunch ever I struck,\" grumbled the Old Man with  grateful insincerity. \"What you fellers don't think of, there ain't any  use in mentioning. Oh, Dell! Bring out that jug Blake sent me! Doggoned  thirsty bunch out here--won't stir a foot till they sample that wine!  Got to get rid of 'em somehow--they claim to be full uh business as  a jack rabbit is of fleas! When yuh want to git out and round up them  cows? Wagon's over on Dry creek som'ers--or ought to be. Yuh might take  your soogans and ride ove' there tomorrow or next day and ketch 'em.  I'll write a note to Chip and tell 'im what's to be done. And while  you're pickin' your bunch you can draw wages just the same as ever, and  help them double-dutch blisterin' milk-fed pilgrims with the calf crop.\"    \"We'll sure do that,\" promised Weary for the bunch. \"We can start in the  morning, all right.\"    \"Take a taste uh this wine. None of your tobacco-juice stuff; this comes  straight from Fresno. Senator Blake sent it the other day. Fill up that  glass, Dell! What yuh want to be so doggone stingy fer? Think this bunch  uh freaks are going to stand for that? They can't git the taste outa  less'n a pint. This ain't any doggone liver-tonic like you dope out.\"    The Little Doctor smiled understandingly and filled their glasses with  the precious wine from sunland. She did not know what had happened, but  she did know that the Old Man had seized another hand-hold on life in  the last hour, and she was grateful. She even permitted the Kid to  take a tiny sip, just because the Happy Family hated to see him refused  anything he wanted.    So Flying U coulee was for the time being filled with the same old  laughter and the same atmosphere of care-free contentment with life. The  Countess stewed uncomplainingly in the kitchen, cooking dinner for the  boys. The Old Man grumbled hypocritically at them from his big chair,  and named their faults in the tone that transmuted them into virtues.  The Little Doctor heard about Miss Allen and her three partners, who  were building a four-room shack on the four corners of four claims, and  how Irish had been caught more than once in the act of staring fixedly  in the direction of that shack. She heard a good many things, and she  guessed a good many more.    By mid afternoon the Old Man was fifty per cent brighter and better than  he had been in the morning, and he laughed and bullied them as of old.  When they left he told them to clear out and stay out, and that if he  caught them hanging around his ranch, and making it look as if he were  backing them and trying to defraud the government, he'd sic the dog onto  them. Which tickled the Kid immensely, because there wasn't any dog to  sic.        CHAPTER 10. WHEREIN ANDY GREEN LIES TO A LADY    In the soft-creeping dusk came Andy Green, slouched in the saddle with  the weariness of riding since dawn; slouched to one side and singing,  with his hat far back on his head and the last of a red sunset tinting  darkly the hills above him. Tip-toe on a pinnacle a great, yellow star  poised and winked at him knowingly. Andy's eyes twinkled answer as he  glanced up that way. \"We've got her going, old-timer,\" he announced  lazily to the star.    Six miles back toward the edge of the \"breaks\" which are really the  beginning of the Badlands that border the Missouri River all through  that part of "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/17404"],[0,"Kinship Organisations and Group Marriage in Australia (#16)"],[1,"d, secondly, of selection of such names as  were not borrowed.    It has been mentioned that the principle of tribal property in land or,  to be strictly accurate, in hunting grounds, is, at the present day, a  fundamental one in native Australian jurisprudence. But, as is shown by  the map, in some cases the phratries are split into two or more  segments[106], more or less remote from one another, geographically  speaking. Now this apparent segmentation must be due to migration; it  can hardly arise from the chance adoption of identical names; for the  groups in which the names occur are, though separated by a considerable  distance, not so remote as, on the theory of chance selection, we should  expect them to be, in other words the probability is in favour of the  segmentation of an original group or its cleavage by an intrusive  element. Of the causes of this drift of population, which on a large  scale, and under pressure of any kind, might well overrule even the  rights of property, we have naturally no idea. In a homogeneous mass  like the population of Australia, and especially in a mass whose level  of culture is so low as to leave no remains behind which we could use  for the purposes of chronology, it is hopeless to expect any solution of  any of the problems connected with drift of population. One thing only  seems clear, and on this point we may hope for some light from the data  of philology, namely that the migration was long subsequent to the  original _Volkerwanderung_; for this must have preceded the rise of  phratry names, which again must have preceded the migration of which the  segmentation of groups, evidenced by the names themselves, is at  present, and in default of the aid of philology, our only proof.    The migrations of which we are speaking must, if the possession of one  phratry name in common be worth anything as evidence of a closer  connection between the groups, have been internal to a group or, if the  term be preferred, to a nation occupying the south of Queensland. For in  the absence of evidence that phratry names are to be found outside their  own linguistic groups, we cannot but infer from the quadripartite  division of the Wuthera phratries both the linguistic unity (and  language must be in Australia the ultimate test of racial relationship  on a large scale) and the internal movements of the group in which they  occur.    In favour of the primitive unity of the Wuthera groups, is the fact that  with small exceptions, and those on the outskirts of the district, the  area occupied by the assumed homogeneous pre-phratry group has the same  class names throughout--which is at the same time a proof that the class  names are posterior to the phratry names; for the later the date, the  more extensive the group, may be taken to be the rule in savage  communities; if the phratry names came later than the class names we  should expect them to be identical, and the class names different  instead of the reverse. But to the relative age of classes and phratries  we return at another point of our argument.    The available data being few, it could hardly be expected that a  discussion of them would be very fruitful. In the present chapter we  have, however, shown that the phratry names and organisation are  probably of very early date, that considerable movements of population  took place within the linguistic groups subsequent to the adoption of  the phratry names, and that these names have been selected for some  explicit reason and not adopted at haphazard.

The Victorian area. Totems and phratry names. Reformation theory of       phratriac origin.      If a pre-phratry organisation developed into the system as we find it,  it is a little difficult to see how selection can have operated, unless,  indeed, as Mr Lang suggests, the phratries are _transformed_ connubial  groups, in which case they may have received new names. It is perhaps  simpler to suppose that the cases of selection of phratry names cited  above are those in which the organisation has been borrowed with full  knowledge of its meaning. If this view is correct, no criticism of  theories of the origin of phratries is possible from the point of view  of the names actually existing, for we cannot say which, if any, are  those which were evolved in the organisation which served as a model to  the remainder.    Broadly speaking the theories of origin at present in the field may be  reduced to two: in the first place, the conscious reformation theory,  which supposes that man discovered the evils of in-and-in breeding, a  point on which some discussion will be found in a later portion of this  work. In the second place, there is the unconscious evolution theory put  forward by Mr Lang, whose criticism of the opposing view makes it  unnecessary to deal with the objections here[107].    Mr Lang's original theory took for its basis the hypothesis, put forward  by the late Mr J.J. Atkinson, in _Primal Law_, of the origin of  exogamy. His starting-point was mankind in the brute stage. At the point  in the evolution of the human race at which Mr Atkinson takes up his  tale, man, or rather Eoanthropos, was, according to his conjecture,  organised, if that term can be applied to the grouping of the lower  animals, in bodies consisting of one adult male, an attendant horde of  adult females, including, probably, at any rate after a certain lapse of  time, his own progeny, together with the immature offspring of both  sexes. As the young males came to maturity, they would be expelled from  the herd, as is actually the case with cattle and other mammals, by  their sire, now become their foe. They probably wandered about, as do  the young males of some existing species, in droves of a dozen or more,  and at certain seasons of the year, one or more of them would, as they  felt their powers mature, engage the lord of their own or of another  herd in single combat, until with the lapse of time the latter either  succumbed or was driven from the herd to end his days in solitary  ferocity, his hand against everyone, just as we see the rogue elephant  wage war indiscriminately on all who approach him.    In process of time, so Mr Atkinson suggests, with the lengthening  childhood conditioned by the progress of the race, maternal love of a  more enduring kind developed, than is found among the non-human species  of the present day. This led eventually to the presence of a young male,  perhaps the youngest born of a given mother, being permitted to remain,  on conditions, in the herd after he had attained maturity. The original  lord and master of the herd retained, Mr Atkinson supposes, his full  sovereignty over the females born in the herd as well as over those whom  his prowess had perhaps added to it from time to time. The young male on  the other hand was not condemned to a life of celibacy as a condition of  his non-enforcement of the traditional decree of banishment. He was  permitted to find a mate, but she must be a mate not born in the herd,  nor one of the harem of his sire; he had, if he wished to wed, to  capture a spouse for himself from another herd. For the detailed working  out of this ingenious theory we must refer our readers to Mr Atkinson's  work, _Primal Law_. Here it suffices to state the primal law which  resulted from the process sketched above. This primal law was \"thou  shalt not marry within the group.\" This law, at first enforced by the  superior strength of the sire, came in the process of time to be a  traditional rule of conduct, almost an instinct. And with this we reach  the theory put forward in _Social Origins_ by Mr Andrew Lang, according  to which local groups received animal names, perhaps from their  neighbours. These local groups being exogamous for the reason just  given, and the group name being eventually[108] given, not only to the  actual members of the group, but also to the women, captured or  otherwise, who became the mates of the men of the adjoining groups, it  necessarily resulted that the men of a group, so long as the mother's  group name did not descend to her children, were of one name, while  their wives were of another, or more probably of many other names. The  group became definitely heterogeneous when the maternal group name  descended to the children born in the alien group, and in process of  time these maternal group names became totem names.    Meanwhile the original group names had been retained and applied, along  with the totem or quasi-totem names, to the members of the group; the  name being probably, in the first place, that of the group in which they  were born, but, with the rise of the matrilineal descent, which has been  discussed above, eventually taken from the group to which the mother  belonged.    During these processes the custom had sprung up to select a wife, not at  random from any of the probably more or less hostile surrounding groups,  but from one particular group with which the group of the candidate for  matrimony had in the course of time come to be on friendly terms.    The names of these two groups, which drew in other smaller groups,  became the phratry names of the newly-formed aggregate, the largest unit  known to primitive society at that stage of its evolution, and  corresponding roughly to what we have defined as a tribe; for it was  united by bonds of friendship, and in the course of time the"]]]
