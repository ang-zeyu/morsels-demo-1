A BRIEFE DECLARATION  OF THE  PLANTATION OF VIRGINIA    DURINGE THE FIRST TWELVE YEARES, WHEN  SIR THOMAS SMITH WAS GOVERNOR OF  THE COMPANIE, & DOWNE TO THIS  PRESENT TYME.    BY THE    ANCIENT PLANTERS NOWE REMAINING ALIVE IN VIRGINIA.    1624.          PREFACE.      The next paper presented in this collection is a copy of the one from  which Mr. Bancroft quotes in his introductory note to the meeting of the  first Assembly, referring to it as \"MS. in my possession.\" This is  printed from the copy among the McDonald papers, and with its title and  endorsements no intimation is given as to the date of its preparation,  its author or authors, to whom it was addressed, or the use intended to  be made of it. These questions are, however, answered almost entirely by  reference to the entries in \"Sainsbury's Calendar of State Papers,\"  which, on pp. 65-'6, has the following: \"1624. July. Petition of Gov.  Sir Francis Wyatt, the Council and Assembly of Virginia to the King.  Have understood that his Majesty, notwithstanding the unjust  disparagement of the Plantation, has taken it under his especial care;  intreat that credit may not be given to the late declarations presented  to his Majesty concerning the happy, but indeed miserable, estate of the  Colony during the first twelve years (of Sir Thos. Smith's government),  nor to the malicious imputations which have been laid upon the late  government. Inclose the true state of both, and earnestly request that  the present government may be continued. Pray that the King's tender  compassion will not allow them to fall into the hands of Sir Thos. Smith  or his confidents.\" Signed by Sir Fran. Wyatt, Capt. Fan. West, Sir  George Yeardley and eighty-six others. _Inclose._--\"Brief Declaration of  the Plantation,\" &c., giving the whole title of this paper, verbatim,  and a copious abstract of its contents. The earliest account of the  horrors it relates is to be found in Smith's History, p. 105, in what is  called \"the examinations of Doctor Simons.\" This writer gives full  details of the straits to which the Colonists were reduced and the  expedients to which they resorted to appease hunger in 1609; adding,  after the statements in regard to eating the Indian who had been buried  several days and their eating \"one another boyled, and stewed with  rootes and herbes,\" the account of the man who \"did kill his wife,  powdered her, and had eaten part of her before it was known,\" and adding  with a grim humour, \"now whether shee was better roasted, boyled or  carbonado'd, I know not, but of such a dish as powdered wife, I never  heard of.\" His statements are copied, with more or less variation, by  Beverley, Stith, Keith and Burke, but not one of them go into the  disgusting and improbable details named in the \"Brief Declaration.\"  Campbell also reports the stories, but adds, in regard to the wife  murderer, \"upon his trial it appeared that cannibalism was feigned to  palliate the murder,\" p. 93. Neill quotes from the Records of the  Virginia Company, \"The Tragical Relation of Virginia Assembly,\" which  was transmitted to England about 1621; this was intended as a reply to a  petition of Alderman Johnson and others, who had represented to the King  that the reports in regard to Sir Thos. Smith's management were false,  and desiring an investigation. These petitioners were members of a  faction which desired to break up the Virginia Company. In the Relation  of the Assembly, Smith is charged with all the cruelties to the  Colonists which are mentioned in this \"Brief Declaration\"; torturing  and starving to death being the punishments for minor offences; and  asserting their confidence in the truth of these statements by  concluding it with these words: \"And rather to be reduced to live under  the like government we desire his Ma^{ties} commissioners may be sent  over w^{th} authoritie to hange us.\" This is signed by thirty members of  the General Assembly, including among the names, those of George Sandys,  the poet, traveller and Secretary of the Colony, and Raph Hamor, the  chronicler--See Neill, pp. 407-411.    There is another reference to this starving time (as it is called) and  its accompanying horror, which should not be allowed to pass without  notice. As above stated, the worst state of affairs was reported to have  existed in 1609, and in the next year a pamphlet with the following  title was issued, \"A true declaration of the estate of the Colonie of  Virginia, with a refutation of such scandalous reports as haue tended to  the disgrace of so worthy an enterprise. Published by aduise and  direction of the Councell of Virginia. London, 1610.\" The writer of  which, after referring to the slanders which had been circulated in  regard to Sir Thos. Smith's government, and especially of the story of  the wife-eater, says, \"Sir Thomas Gates thus relateth the tragedie,\" and  then follows a long passage to the effect that \"one of the companie  mortally hated his wife,\" and having killed her and secreted her body  after cutting it into peices; when it was found out he said she died and  he had hid her to satiafie his hunger, and had fed daily upon her, but  upon searching his house they found a large quantity of provisions.--See  Force's tracts, Vol. III. The writers of the \"Brief Declaration,\" and  the \"True Declaration,\" must have seen this statement published ten or  twelve years before they wrote, and it is a little remarkable that they  should have persisted in repeating a story which was far from being well  authentitcated, especially as the true statement did not need this  addition to increase the odium incurred by the mismanagement of Sir  Thos. Smith, the evidences of which are herein set forth.    Stith reports the stories of the Indian \"that had been slain and buried\"  being taken up and eaten, and \"so did several others, one another that  died,\" and also that of the man who \"killed his wife and powdered her  up, and eat the greater portion before it was discovered;\" and adds, for  many years after it was \"remembered by the name of the _starving time_,\"  p. 116-117.

By the Ancient Planters       nowe remaining alive in Virginia._    Wheras in the beginninge of Sir Thomas Smith's twelve yeares government,  it was published in printe throughout the Kingdome of Englande that a  Plantation should be settled in Virginia for the glorie of God in the  propogation of the Gospell of Christ, the conversion of the Savages, to  the honour of his Majesty, by the enlargeinge of his territories and  future enrichinge of his kingdome, for which respects many noble & well  minded persons were induced to adventure great sums of money to the  advancement of soe pious & noble a worke, who have from the very first  been frustrate of their expectation, as wee conceive, by the  misgovernment of Sir Thomas Smith, aiminge at nothinge more then a  perticular gaine, to be raised out of the labours of such as both  voluntarilie adventured themselves and were otherwise sent over at the  common charge. This will cleerely appeare in the examination of the  first expedition & severall supplies in the tyme of his government.
