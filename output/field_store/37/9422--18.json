Rarely, if ever, has there been a  more ghastly profanation of the Holy Sacrament of Regeneration!    Before he was garroted, Atahualpa begged that his remains might be  preserved at Quito with those of his mother's people.  Then he turned  to Pizarro and {92} made a final request of that iron-hearted man, that  he would look after and care for the Inca's little children.  While he  was strangled and his body was being burnt, the terrible soldiery could  be heard muttering the magnificent words of the Apostolic Creed for the  redemption of the soul of the monarch.  Incidentally it may be noted  that a little later the Spaniards burnt old Chalcuchima, of whom they  had got possession by treacherous promises, at the stake.  He did not  embrace Christianity at the last moment, but died as he had lived, a  soldier and a Peruvian.    The character of Atahualpa may be learned from his career.  He was a  cruel, ruthless usurper, neither magnanimous in victory nor resolute in  defeat.  As I have said, it is impossible to admire him, but no one can  think of his fate and the treacheries of which he was a victim without  being touched by his miseries.  If he sowed the wind he reaped the  whirlwind, and bad as he was, his conquerors were worse.    Pizarro placed the diadem on Toparca, a youthful brother of the late  Inca.  When he was alone with his attendants, the boy tore the _llauta_  from his forehead, and trampled it under his foot, as no longer the  badge of anything but infamy and shame, and in two short months he  pined and died from the consciousness of his disgrace.  Whereupon  another Peruvian, Manco Capac, the legitimate heir of Huascar, appeared  before Pizarro, made good his claim, and on the entry of the conquerors  into Cuzco, was crowned Inca with all the ancient ceremonies.  He soon  realized that he was but a puppet in Pizarro's hands, however, and by  and by he, too, made a bold stroke for freedom.    The conquest of Peru was complete.  Charles V., dazzled by the report  of Hernando Pizarro, and the {93} substantial treasures placed before  him, created Pizarro a Marquis of the country, confirmed him in the  government of the country for two hundred and seventy leagues south of  the Santiago River and gave Almagro authority to conquer everything  beyond that limit.  Almagro was very much dissatisfied with his share,  but concluded, before he made any violent objections, to go to the  south and find an El Dorado for himself.    Meanwhile Pizarro, who was almost as much of a builder as Rameses the  Great, laid out the city of Lima and the Spaniards flocked into Peru  from Spain in thousands.  The natives were enslaved and the country  divided into great estates, and Almagro and his discontented started  for Chili.  Hernando Pizarro, who was appointed governor of Cuzco, held  young Manco in close confinement, and everything outwardly was as fine  and lovely as a summer day.  There was growing, however, a tremendous  uprising in which hitherto somnolent Fate was about to lay her belated  hands upon nearly all the actors of the great drama which had  heretofore been so successfully played.      VI. The Inca and the Peruvians Strike Vainly for Freedom    The city of Cuzco was, without doubt, the most superb capital on the  American continent.  Indeed, in many respects, it would have compared  favorably with, let us say, Paris in the sixteenth century, with its  narrow, crooked, unpaved filthy streets, its indifferent protections,  and its utterly inadequate water and sewer system.  The streets, which  were broad and level, crossed each other at regular intervals at right  angles.  They were smoothly paved with large, carefully joined {94}  flagstones.  The houses in the city were mainly built of stone.  The  palace of the Inca, which stood alone in the great square, was of  marble.  The temples and buildings for public assemblages, armories,  granaries, storehouses, _et cetera_, were of great size.  The stones  used in their erection were of such dimensions that the Spanish  marvelled at the engineering genius which could have quarried them and  put them in place, just as the people of to-day are amazed at Baalbec  and the pyramids.  Stone conduits ran down each street, bringing  delicious water to each doorway, and the city was traversed by two  mountain streams crossed by bridges cut by watergates.  That the cold,  clear water might be kept pure and sweet, the beds of the rivers like  those of the Euphrates at Babylon, had been paved.    The city was surrounded by walls and dominated by a great fortress  called Sacsahuaman, which stood upon a steep and rocky hill overlooking  the capital.  On the side toward the city the fortress was practically  impregnable on account of the precipitous slopes of the cliffs.  The  other side was defended by three stone walls laid out in zigzag shape,  with salient and reentrant angles (demi-lunes), like an old-fashioned  rail fence, with many doors, each closed by stone portcullis, in each  wall.  Within the walls was a citadel of three tall towers.  The whole  constituted a most formidable position.    While Francisco Pizarro was founding and laying out on a magnificent  scale and with lavish generosity the city of Lima, near the seaboard,  Hernando was made governor of Cuzco.  Hernando was, without doubt, the  most able and most admirable of the Pizarros, although his fame has  been obscured by that of his {95} elder brother.  He had been directed  by Charles V to treat the Inca and the people with kindness, and,  perhaps on that account, he had not exercised so rigorous a  surveillance over the movements of young Manco as his ordinary prudence  would have dictated.  At any rate, the bold and youthful emperor found  no difficulty in leaving his ancient capital.  He repaired immediately  to the Valley of Yucay, in the high mountains of the northeastward of  Cuzco.  There had been brewing a vast conspiracy against the Spaniards  for some time, and at the summons of the Inca, thither resorted the  great chiefs of the Peruvians with their retainers and dependents,  including their women and children.    The partisans of the two Inca half-brothers, who had not been slain,  made common cause with each other.  All internal differences were  forgotten in the presence of the common enemy.  They had much to  revenge.  Their treasures had been taken, their temples polluted, their  religion profaned, their monarchs slain, their women outraged and the  people forced into a degrading, exhausting slavery.  Strange is it to  recognize that human slavery was introduced into Peru by the Christians!    It is good to think that the manhood of the Peruvians was awakened at  last.  Manco, burning with fiery patriotic zeal, summoned his great  vassals and subjects to his standard.  \"Death to the Spaniards!\" were  the watchwords that resounded with fierce war-cries among the mountains  and hills.  With ancient ceremonies, drinking from a common cup, they  pledged their lives, their fortunes, and their sacred honor to their  hereditary chief in defense of their altars and their fires, their  native land.    {96}    Early in 1536 a vast army swept down through the mountain passes and  made toward the ancient capital.  The three Pizarros, Hernando, Juan  and Gonzalo, put themselves at the head of their horsemen and sallied  out to meet them.  They killed numbers of Peruvians, but all their  valor could not check the resistless force of the patriotic army.  The  Spaniards were swept back into the city, glad to escape with their  lives before such overwhelming numbers; indeed, only a timely attack by  a detachment in the rear of the Peruvians saved them from destruction  then and there.  Cuzco was at once invested.  The Indians, with a  heroism which cannot be too greatly commended, endeavored to carry the  place by assault.[9]    They set fire to the thatched roofs of their own houses, devoting their  city to flames, like the Russians at Moscow, to compass the  annihilation of the detested invaders.  The wind favored them, and a  besom of flame swept over the devoted town until over one-half of it  was laid in ruins.  There were ninety Spanish horse in the city,  probably as many foot, and a thousand Indian auxiliaries, but they were  soldiers of the highest quality and led by three captains whose like  for daring and skill are not often seen.    No one ever questioned the courage or the military ability of the  Pizarros and certainly they exhibited both qualities in full measure  during the siege.  Of all the brothers, it is probable that Hernando  was the most daring cavalier as well as the most capable captain,  although in personal prowess his younger brothers were not a whit  behind him.  Indeed, Gonzalo was {97} reckoned as the best lance in the  New World.  Stifled by the smoke, scorched by the flames, parched with  heat, choked with thirst, exhausted with hunger, crazed from loss of  sleep, yet battling with the energy of despair against overwhelming  numbers of Indians, who, with a reckless disregard for life, hurled  themselves upon the sword-points, the Spaniards after several days of  the most terrific fighting, were forced into the square, which they  held against their enemy by dint of the most heroic and continuous  endeavors.    The Peruvians barricaded the streets with the debris of their ruined  houses and sharpened stakes, and prepared to press home for a final  attack.  Although the slaughter among the Indians had been fearful, the  odds against the Spaniards did not appear diminished, for it was  learned afterward that there were more than one hundred thousand  warriors engaged, and, with a host of followers and servants, the total  aggregated at least eighty thousand more.  And, indeed, the Spaniards  mourned the death of many a brave cavalier and stout man-at-arms.  In  all the fighting the young Inca, in full war-gear of gold and silver,  mounted on a"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/20912"],[0,"The Daffodil Mystery (#16)"],[1," from the East  to his friends,\" he went on. \"He gave me that dagger you see hanging on  the wall, which he bought at some outlandish place in his travels. He may  have given me a sample of these slips. I remember his telling me a story  about them, which I cannot for the moment recall.\"    He would have continued retailing reminiscences of his late employer, but  Tarling cut him short, and with a curt good night withdrew. Milburgh  accompanied him to the front gate and locked the door upon the three men  before he went back to his sitting-room smiling quietly to himself.    \"I am certain that the man was Milburgh,\" said Tarling. \"I am as certain  as that I am standing here.\"    \"Have you any idea why he should want to out you?\" asked Whiteside.    \"None in the world,\" replied Tarling. \"Evidently my assailant was a man  who had watched my movements and had probably followed the girl and  myself to the hotel in a cab. When I disappeared inside he dismissed his  own and then took the course of dismissing my cab, which he could easily  do by paying the man his fare and sending him off. A cabman would accept  that dismissal without suspicion. He then waited for me in the fog and  followed me until he got me into a quiet part of the road, where he first  attempted to sandbag and then to shoot me.\"    \"But why?\" asked Whiteside again. \"Suppose Milburgh knew something about  this murder--which is very doubtful--what benefit would it be to him to  have you put out of the way?\"    \"If I could answer that question,\" replied Tarling grimly, \"I could tell  you who killed Thornton Lyne.\"          CHAPTER XV    THE OWNER OF THE PISTOL      All trace of the fog of the night before had disappeared when Tarling  looked out from his bedroom window later that morning. The streets were  flooded with yellow sunshine, and there was a tang in the air which  brought the colour to the cheek and light to the eye of the patient  Londoner.    Tarling stretched his arms and yawned in the sheer luxury of living,  before he took down his silk dressing-gown and went in to the breakfast  which Ling Chu had laid for him.    The blue-bloused Chinaman who stood behind his master's chair, poured out  the tea and laid a newspaper on one side of the plate and letters on the  other. Tarling ate his breakfast in silence and pushed away the plate.    \"Ling Chu,\" he said in the vernacular of Lower China, \"I shall lose my  name as the Man Hunter, for this case puzzles me beyond any other.\"    \"Master,\" said the Chinaman in the same language, \"there is a time in all  cases, when the hunter feels that he must stop and weep. I myself had  this feeling when I hunted down Wu Fung, the strangler of Hankow. Yet,\"  he added philosophically, \"one day I found him and he is sleeping on the  Terrace of Night.\"    He employed the beautiful Chinese simile for death.    \"Yesterday I found the little-young-woman,\" said Tarling after a pause.  In this quaint way did he refer to Odette Rider.    \"You may find the little-young-woman and yet not find the killer,\" said  Ling Chu, standing by the side of the table, his hands respectfully  hidden under his sleeves. \"For the little-young-woman did not kill the  white-faced man.\"    \"How do you know?\" asked Tarling; and the Chinaman shook his head.    \"The little-young-woman has no strength, master,\" he said. \"Also it is  not known that she has skill in the driving of the quick cart.\"    \"You mean the motor?\" asked Tarling quickly, and Ling Chu nodded.    \"By Jove! I never thought of that,\" said Tarling. \"Of course, whoever  killed Thornton Lyne must have put his body in the car and driven him to  the Park. But how do you know that she does not drive?\"    \"Because I have asked,\" said the Chinaman simply. \"Many people know the  little-young-woman at the great Stores where the white-faced man lived,  and they all say that she does not drive the quick cart.\"    Tarling considered for a while.    \"Yes, it is true talk,\" he said. \"The little-young-woman did not kill the  white-faced man, because she was many miles away when the murder was  committed. That we know. The question is, who did?\"    \"The Hunter of Men will discover,\" said Ling Chu    \"I wonder,\" said Tarling.    He dressed and went to Scotland Yard. He had an appointment with  Whiteside, and later intended accompanying Odette Rider to an interview  before the Assistant Commissioner. Whiteside was at Scotland Yard before  him, and when Tarling walked into his room was curiously examining an  object which lay before him on a sheet of paper. It was a short-barrelled  automatic pistol.    \"Hullo!\" he said, interested. \"Is that the gun that killed Thornton  Lyne?\"    \"That's the weapon,\" said the cheerful Whiteside. \"An ugly-looking brute,  isn't it?\"    \"Where did you say it was discovered?\"    \"At the bottom of the girl's work-basket.\"    \"This has a familiar look to me,\" said Tarling, lifting the instrument  from the table. \"By-the-way, is the cartridge still in the chamber?\"    Whiteside shook his head.    \"No, I removed it,\" he said. \"I've taken the magazine out too.\"    \"I suppose you've sent out the description and the number to all the  gunsmiths?\"    Whiteside nodded.    \"Not that it's likely to be of much use,\" he said. \"This is an  American-made pistol, and unless it happens to have been sold in England  there is precious little chance of our discovering its owner.\"    Tarling was looking at the weapon, turning it over and over in his hand.  Presently he looked at the butt and uttered an exclamation. Following  the direction of his eyes, Whiteside saw two deep furrows running  diagonally across the grip.    \"What are they?\" he asked.    \"They look like two bullets fired at the holder of the revolver some  years ago, which missed him but caught the butt.\"    Whiteside laughed.    \"Is that a piece of your deduction, Mr. Tarling?\" he asked.    \"No,\" said Tarling, \"that is a bit of fact. That pistol is my own!\"          CHAPTER XVI    THE HEIR      \"_Your_ pistol?\" said Whiteside incredulously, \"my dear good chap, you  are mad! How could it be your pistol?\"    \"It is nevertheless my pistol,\" said Tarling quietly. \"I recognised it  the moment I saw it on your desk, and thought there must be some mistake.  These furrows prove that there is no mistake at all. It has been one of  my most faithful friends, and I carried it with me in China for six  years.\"    Whiteside gasped.    \"And you mean to tell me,\" he demanded, \"that Thornton Lyne was killed  with your pistol?\"    Tarling nodded.    \"It is an amazing but bewildering fact,\" he said. \"That is undoubtedly  my pistol, and it is the same that was found in Miss Rider's room at  Carrymore Mansions, and I have not the slightest doubt in my mind that it  was by a shot fired from this weapon that Thornton Lyne lost his life.\"    There was a long silence.    \"Well, that beats me,\" said Whiteside, laying the weapon on the table.  \"At every turn some new mystery arises. This is the second jar I've had  to-day.\"    \"The second?\" said Tarling. He put the question idly, for his mind was  absorbed in this new and to him tremendous aspect of the crime. Thornton  Lyne had been killed by his pistol! That to him was the most staggering  circumstance which had been revealed since he had come into the case.    \"Yes,\" Whiteside was saying, \"it's the second setback.\"    With an effort Tarling brought his mind back from speculating upon the  new mystery.    \"Do you remember this?\" said Whiteside. He opened his safe and took out a  big envelope, from which he extracted a telegram.    \"Yes, this is the telegram supposed to have been sent by Odette Rider,  asking Mr. Lyne to call at her flat. It was found amongst the dead man's  effects when the house was searched.\"    \"To be exact,\" corrected Whiteside, \"it was discovered by Lyne's valet--a  man named Cole, who seems to be a very honest person, against whom no  suspicion could be attached. I had him here this morning early to make  further inquiries into Lyne's movements on the night of the murder. He's  in the next room, by-the-way. I'll bring him in.\"    He pushed a bell and gave his instructions to the uniformed policeman  who came. Presently the door opened again and the officer ushered in a  respectable-looking, middle-aged man, who had \"domestic service\" written  all over him.    \"Just tell Mr. Tarling what you told me,\" said Whiteside.    \"About that telegram, sir?\" asked Cole. \"Yes, I'm afraid I made a bit  of a mistake there, but I got flurried with this awful business and I  suppose I lost my head a bit.\"    \"What happened?\" asked Tarling.    \"Well, sir, this telegram I brought up the next day to Mr.  Whiteside--that is to say, the day after the murder----\" Tarling nodded.  \"And when I brought it up I made a false statement. It's a thing I've  never done before in my life, but I tell you I was scared by all these  police inquiries.\"    \"What was the false statement?\" asked Tarling quickly.    \"Well, sir,\" said the servant, twisting his hat nervously, \"I said that  it had been opened by Mr. Lyne. As a matter of fact, the telegram wasn't  delivered until a quarter of an hour after Mr. Lyne left the place. It  was I who opened it when I heard of the murder. Then, thinking that I  should get into trouble for sticking my nose into police business, I told  Mr. Whiteside that Mr. Lyne had opened it.\"    \"He didn't receive the telegram?\" asked Tarling.    \"No, sir.\"    The two detectives looked at one another.    \"Well, what do you make of that, Whiteside?\"    \"I'm blest if I know what to think of it,\" said Whiteside, scratching his  head. \"We depended upon that telegram to implicate the girl. It breaks a  big link in the chain against her.\"    \"Supposing it was not already broken,\" said Tarling almost aggressively.    \"And it certainly removes the only possible explanation for Lyne going to  the flat on the night of the murder. You're perfectly sure, Cole, that  that telegram did not reach "]]]
