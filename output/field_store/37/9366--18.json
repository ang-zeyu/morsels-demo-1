Now, take a warning from me, and don't let a word  of what has happened since we left camp for Pietermaritzburg pass your  lips. I did all the shooting, and I'm not a bit ashamed of it; but, by  the eternal God, if you open your lips to a soul, I'll shoot you like  a dog or a cannibal! Remember that, sonny, and say it quietly over  to yourself the first time you feel that you want to blab. Now, shake  hands.\"    This was probably the longest speech that Whitson had ever made.    About two years after the events narrated, Whitson took his discharge  and returned to America. He left behind him a sealed packet addressed  to his commanding officer, and which was not to be delivered for twelve  months after his departure.    Owing, however, to a strange combination of fortuitous circumstances,  this packet never reached its proper destination; its wrapper, bearing  the address, having been scorched off in a fire which took place in the  house where it was left.      NOTE    Many people have heard or read of the cannibals of Natal, who turned  large tracts of country into a shambles in the early part of this  century, after Tshaka's impis had swept off all the cattle, and then  kept the miserable people continually on the move so that they were  unable to cultivate. One Umdava originated the practice of eating human  flesh. Gathering together the fragments of four scattered tribes, he  trained them to hunt human beings as others hunted game. This gang was  a greater scourge to the country surrounding the present site of  Pietermaritzburg than even Tshaka's murdering hordes. It was broken up  in or about the year 1824, when the Europeans first came to the country,  and the remnants of many scattered tribes returned and settled under  their protection.    All this is history with which most people in South Africa are familiar,  but many do not know that some of the cannibals fled to Basutoland,  where, among almost inaccessible mountains, they carried on their  horrible practices for many years.    It is a well-known fact that when men once surrender themselves to any  unnatural and brutal vice, the gratification of the abnormal instinct  thus acquired becomes the most imperative need of their nature.  The Falkland Islands case, as bearing specially upon the foregoing  narrative, may be mentioned. Some convicts escaped from the Falkland  Island convict station, and succeeded in reaching the coast of  Patagonia. They then endeavored to make their way to Montevideo, but  having to keep along the shore so as to avoid the natives, who would  have killed them had they ventured inland, were easily intercepted by  the government cutter, which was always despatched in cases of the kind  to head off fugitives upon their only possible course. Of the party only  one man was found alive. In their dreadful need the men had cast lots as  to who should be killed and eaten by the others, and this went on until  only the one man remained. His sufferings had been so horrible that  he was let off any further punishment, and simply brought back to the  island to complete the term of his sentence. Some months after, this  man induced another to escape with him in a boat, and, when the boat was  overtaken, it was found that he had killed his companion for the purpose  of eating the latter's flesh. This was apparent from the fact that  the supply of food which the fugitives had taken with them was not  exhausted.          MARY MUSGRAVE, By Anonymous      \"Nine carets ef it's a blessed one.\"    \"Scale 'im, an' ye'll find he's a half better. Clear es a bottle o'  gin, an' flawless es the pope! Tommy Dartmoor, ye're in luck, s' welp me  never ef ye ain't, an' that's a brilliant yer can show the polis an' not  get time fer.\"    Tommy Dartmoor, who owed his surname to a crown establishment within the  restraining walls of which he had once enjoyed a temporary residence,  growled out a recommendation to \"stow that,\" and then added, \"Boys,  we'll wet this. Trek to Werstein's.\"    Forthwith a crowd of dirty, tanned diggers turned their heads in the  direction of Gustav Werstein's American Bar, and walked toward it as  briskly as the heat and their weariness would admit of. The Israelite  saw them coming, straightened himself out of the half-doze in which  he had passed the baking afternoon, stopped down the tobacco in the  porcelain bowl of his long-stemmed pipe with stumpy forefinger, and,  twisting a cork off his corkscrew, stood in readiness.    \"Name yer pizons, boys, an' get outside 'em, wishin' all good luck to  R'yal Straight; R'yal Straight bein' the name o' this yer stone given by  Thomas D. Hesquire, original diskiverer an' present perprietor.\"    The orders were given,--bass at five shillings a bottle, champagne  (nee gooseberry) at five pounds, Cape smoke at two shillings per two  fingers,--and, at a given signal, there was an inarticulate roar from  dusty throats, an inversion of tumblers over thirsty mouths, and a  second inversion over the ground to show that all the contents had  disappeared.    Satan, the one cat and only domestic pet of the camp, saw that there was  a general treat going on, and bustling up for his drink took a can of  condensed milk at six shillings. Other diggers came trooping in as the  news spread, and Tommy Dartmoor, who was rapidly becoming mellow, for  he drank half a tumbler of raw whisky with every one who nodded to  him, stood them refreshments galore, while the greasy Jew began to see  visions of his adopted fatherland in the near distance.    So the Kaffirs, except those who had supplies of their own, kept sober  and peaceful, while the higher order of the human race at Big Stone  Hole, after the manner of their kind, began to squabble. It was natural  for them to do so, perhaps, for the weather was so hot, and the liquors,  for the most part, more so; and under these circumstances men do not  always cast about them long for a casus belli. One or two minor brawls  opened the ball, and Herr Gustav, scenting battle in the air, drew from  a locker a card, which he balanced against the bottles on a shelf above  his head. It read thus:         GENTS IS REKESTED TO SHOOT       CLEAR OF THE BARR-KEP.       BROKIN GLAS MAY BE PADE FOR       AT COST PRISE.    and had been written for the German by a gentleman who had had  some experience in Forty Rod Gulch, Nevada. The action elicited a  contemptuous laugh from one or two of the new hands, but the oldsters  began shifting sundry articles which depended from their belts into  positions from which they might be handled at the shortest notice;  and the black cat, more wise than any of them, having drunk his fill,  stalked solemnly out into the security of the darkness.    The sun went down,--went out with a click, some one declared,--and,  as no twilight interposed between daylight and darkness in the country  which Big Stone Hole ornamented, Herr Gustav lit his two paraffin-lamps.  Neither boasted more than a one-inch wick, and, as their glasses were  extremely smoky, the illumination was not brilliant; but it sufficed to  show the flushed, angry faces of a couple of men standing in the centre  of the room, with all the others clustered round, watching eagerly. One  was the Scholar. The other was a burly giant, whose missing left little  finger caused him to be nicknamed the Cripple. About what they had  originally fallen out was not clear to any one, to themselves least of  all. As the case stood when the second lamp was lit, Scholar had called  Cripple a something-or-other liar, and Cripple, who was not inventive,  had retorted by stigmatising Scholar as another. Further recriminations  followed, and their pistols were drawn; but as the audience had a strong  objection to indiscriminate shooting, by which it was not likely to  benefit, the belligerents were seized. No one was unsportsmanlike enough  to wish to stop the fight, and Jockey Bill, giving voice to the general  wish of the meeting, proposed that the gents be fixed up agin' a couple  o' posts outside, where they might let daylight into each other without  lead-poisoning casual spectators.    The motion was acted on, and after rectifying a slight omission on  the Cripple's part--he had forgotten to put caps on the nipples of his  revolver--the pair of them were seated upon upturned barrels some ten  yards apart, each with a lamp at his feet, and told to begin when they  saw fit to do so. The swarthy, bearded diggers grouped themselves on  either side, and the cat, emerging from his retreat, scrambled on to  the shoulder of one of them, fully as curious as the rest to \"see the  shootin'.\" It was a weird sight,--dust, scorched grass, empty tins, rude  hovels, piles of debris, African moonlight,--yet, except, perhaps, in  the eyes of the newest comers, there was nothing strange in it. The  others were too wrapped up in what was going to take place to see  anything quaint in their every-day surroundings. There was no theatre in  the camp. The little impromptu drama riveted all attention.    But before the duel commenced, a galloping horse, which had approached  over the grassy veldt unnoticed during the excitement, drew up with a  crash between the two combatants, and its rider, raising his hand to  command attention, cried:    \"Boys, there's a white woman comin'!\"    \"A white woman!\" was chorused in various tones of disbelief. \"What,  here? White woman comin' here, Dan?\"    And then some one inquired if she was a Boer.    \"Boer--no,\" replied Dan; \"English--English as I am; leastways Englisher,  bein' Amurrican-born myself. Overtook her et Hottentot Drift. Thort I'd  spur on an' tell yer. We'd do wi' a clean-up, some on us.\"    Dan spoke indistinctly, as a bullet had lately disarranged some of his  teeth; but his words had a wonderful effect.    Each man began instinctively to tidy himself. The would-be duellists,  forgetting their"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/19800"],[0,"London and the Kingdom - Volume 1 (#16)"],[1," nearly all the middle class of  England, had not been parties to the arbitration, and therefore, were not  pledged to accept the award.(248)    (M155)    The citizens and the barons now entered into solemn covenant to stand by  each other \"saving however their fealty to the king.\" A constable and a  marshal were appointed to command the city force, which was to stand  prepared night and day to muster at the sound of the great bell of St.  Paul's. The manor of Isleworth, belonging to Richard, King of the Romans,  the king's brother, was laid waste, and Rochester besieged, but,  disturbances again breaking out at home, Leicester had to hurry back to  restore order and prevent the city being betrayed to the king's son.(249)    (M156)    In May the earl set out again with a force of Londoners(250) to meet the  king, who was threatening the Cinque Ports. In the early morning of the  14th he came upon the royal army at Lewes. Prince Edward himself led the  charge against the Londoners--he had not forgotten the insult they had  recently offered to his mother--and succeeded in driving them off the  field. They scarcely indeed awaited his onslaught, so unpractised in  warfare had they become of recent years, but turned their backs and sped  away towards London, followed in hot pursuit by Edward. When he returned  he found that, owing to his absence, the day was lost, and that his father  and brother had been made prisoners.(251) In spite of his own success, he  also had to surrender.    (M157)    The barons returned to the city in triumph, bringing the king and Richard,  king of the Romans, in their train. Edward had been placed in custody in  Dover Castle, pending negotiations. Henry was lodged in the Bishop's  Palace, whilst Richard was committed to the Tower. An agreement was drawn  up which secured the safety of the king, and left all matters of dispute  to be again referred to arbitration.(252) This treaty formed the basis of  a new system of government, and led to the institution of Simon de  Montfort's famous Parliament.    The short respite--for it proved to be no more--from civil war was welcomed  by the Londoners. The city had been drained of a large part of its  population in order to increase the Earl of Leicester's army, and business  had been seriously disturbed. For the past year no Court of Husting had  been held, and therefore no wills or testaments had received probate;  whilst all pleas of land, except trespass, had to stand over until the  country became more settled.(253)    (M158)    The parliament which Leicester summoned to meet on the 20th January, 1265,  marked a new era in parliamentary representation. It was the first  parliament in which the merchant and the trader were invited to take their  seats beside the baron and bishop. Not only were the shires to send up two  representatives, but each borough and town were to be similarly  privileged.(254)    Terms of reconciliation between king and barons were arranged, and once  more the mayor and aldermen did fealty to Henry in person in St. Paul's  church. Fitz-Thomas, who for the fourth time was mayor, was determined to  lose nothing of his character for independence; \"My lord,\" said he, when  taking the oath, so long as you are willing to be to us a good king and  lord, we will be to you faithful and true.\"(255)    (M159)    Peace was not destined to last long. Dissensions quickly broke out between  Gilbert, Earl of Gloucester, and Simon de Montfort, owing in a great  measure to jealousy. Gloucester insisted that the Mise of Lewes and the  Provisions of Oxford had not been properly observed, hinting unmistakably  at the foreign birth and extraction of his rival. Endeavours were made to  arrange matters by arbitration, but in vain; and by Whitsuntide the two  earls were in open hostility. Gloucester was joined by Edward, who had  succeeded by a ruse in escaping from Hereford, where he was detained in  honourable captivity.(256)    (M160)    With their combined forces they fell on Earl Simon at Evesham and utterly  defeated him (4 Aug.). Simon himself was killed, and his body barbarously  mutilated.(257) The king, who was in the earl's camp, only saved himself  by crying out in time \"I am Henry of Winchester, your king.\" Whilst the  battle was raging the city was visited with a terrible thunderstorm--an  evil omen of the future.    If credit be given to every statement made by the city alderman and  chronicler, Fitz-Thedmar, we must believe that the battle of Evesham took  place just in time to prevent a wholesale massacre of the best and  foremost men of the city, including the chronicler himself, which was  being contrived by the mayor, the popular Thomas Fitz-Thomas, the no less  popular Thomas de Piwelesdon or Puleston, and others.(258)    (M161)    The citizens of London were soon to experience the change that had taken  place in the state of affairs. The day after Michaelmas, the mayor and  citizens proceeded to Westminster to present the new sheriffs to the  Barons of the Exchequer; but finding no one there, they returned home. The  truth was that the king had resorted to his favourite measure of taking  the city into his own hands for its adherence to the late Earl of  Leicester; and for five years it so remained, being governed by a _custos_  or warden appointed by the king, in the place of a mayor elected by the  citizens.(259)    (M162)    There had been some talk of the king meditating an attack upon the city,  and treating its inhabitants as avowed enemies.(260) The very threat of  such a proceeding was sufficient to throw the city into the utmost state  of confusion. Some there were \"fools and evil-minded persons,\" as our  chronicler describes them--who favoured resisting force by force; but the  \"most discreet men\" of the city, and those who had joined the Earl under  compulsion, would have none of it, preferring to solicit the king's favour  through the mediation of men of the religious orders. Henry still remained  unmoved, and the fear of the citizens increased to such an extent that it  was finally resolved that the citizens as a body should make humble  submission to the king; and that the same should be forwarded to him at  Windsor under the common seal of the city. Whilst the deputation bearing  this document was on its way it was met by Sir Roger de Leiburn, who  turned it back on the ground that he himself was on his way to the city  for the express purpose of arranging terms of submission.(261)    (M163)    That night Sir Roger lodged at the Tower, and the next morning he went to  Barking Church, on the confines of the city,(262) where he was met by the  mayor and a \"countless multitude\" of the citizens. The advice he had to  give the citizens was that if they wished to be reconciled to the king,  they would have to submit their lives and property unreservedly to his  will. Letters patent were drawn up to that effect under the common seal,  and taken by Sir Roger himself to Windsor. The citizens had not long to  wait for an answer. The king's first demand was the removal of the posts  and chains which had been set up in the streets as a means of defence. His  next was that the mayor--his old antagonist Fitz-Thomas--and the principal  men of the city should come in person to him at Windsor, under letters of  safe conduct. Trusting to the royal word, the mayor and about forty of the  more substantial men of the city proceeded to Windsor, there to await a  conference with the king. To their great surprise, the whole of the party  were made to pass the night in the Castle keep. They were practically  treated as prisoners.    (M164)    Some regained their liberty, but of Fitz-Thomas nothing more is heard.  From the time that he entered Windsor Castle, he disappears from public  view. That he was alive in May, 1266, at least in the belief of his  fellow-citizens, is shown by their cry for the release of him and his  companions \"who are at Windleshores.\" They would again have made him  Mayor, if they could have had their own way. \"We will have no one for  mayor\" (they cried) \"save only Thomas Fitz-Thomas.\"(263)    (M165)    In the meantime the king had himself gone to London and confiscated the  property of more than sixty of the citizens, driving them out of their  house and home. Hugh Fitz-Otes, the Constable of the Tower, had been  appointed warden of the city in the place of the imprisoned mayor;  bailiffs had been substituted for sheriffs, and the citizens made to pay a  fine of 20,000 marks. Then, and only then, did the king consent to grant  their pardon.(264)    (M166)    Queen Eleanor, who had interceded for the Londoners,(265) was presented by  the king with the custody of London Bridge, the issues and profits of  which she was allowed to enjoy. She allowed the bridge, however, to fall  into such decay, that she thought she could not do better than restore it  to its rightful owners. This she accordingly did in 1271, but soon  afterwards changed her mind, and again took the bridge into her  charge.(266)    (M167)    At Easter, 1267, the Earl of Gloucester, who had constituted himself the  avowed champion of those who had suffered forfeiture, and become  \"disinherited\" for the part they had taken with the Earl of Leicester,  sought admission to the city. The citizens hesitated to receive him within  their gates, although according to some, he was armed with letters patent  of the king addressed to the citizens on his behalf.(267) Under pretence  of holding a conference with the papal legate at the Church of Holy  Trinity, Aldgate, he gained admission for himself and followers: and there  he remained, having made himself master of the city's gates.(268)  Thereupon many citizens left the city, fearing the wrath of the king, and  once more the city was in the hands of the populace. The leading citizens  were placed under a guard; the aldermen and bailiffs were deposed to make  way for the earl's own supporters, and,"]]]
