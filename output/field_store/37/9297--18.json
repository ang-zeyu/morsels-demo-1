There's nothing to do there.\"    \"You can't bathe?\"    \"Well, I shouldn't care to. Too dirty.\"    \"I see.... This is the way we came yesterday, isn't it? The way to the  village?\"    \"Yes. We go off a bit to the right directly. What are they dragging it  for?\"    \"Mark.\"    \"Oh, rot,\" said Bill uneasily. He was silent for a little, and then,  forgetting his uncomfortable thoughts in his sudden remembrance of the  exciting times they were having, said eagerly, \"I say, when are we going  to look for that passage?\"    \"We can't do very much while Cayley's in the house.\"    \"What about this afternoon when they're dragging the pond? He's sure to  be there.\"    Antony shook his head.    \"There's something I must do this afternoon,\" he said. \"Of course we  might have time for both.\"    \"Has Cayley got to be out of the house for the other thing too?\"    \"Well, I think he ought to be.\"    \"I say, is it anything rather exciting?\"    \"I don't know. It might be rather interesting. I daresay I could do it  at some other time, but I rather fancy it at three o'clock, somehow.  I've been specially keeping it back for then.\"    \"I say, what fun! You do want me, don't you?\"    \"Of course I do. Only, Bill don't talk about things inside the house,  unless I begin. There's a good Watson.\"    \"I won't. I swear I won't.\"    They had come to the pond--Mark's lake--and they walked silently round  it. When they had made the circle, Antony sat down on the grass, and  relit his pipe. Bill followed his example.    \"Well, Mark isn't there,\" said Antony.    \"No,\" said Bill. \"At least, I don't quite see why you know he isn't.\"    \"It isn't 'knowing,' it's 'guessing,'\" said Antony rapidly. \"It's much  easier to shoot yourself than to drown yourself, and if Mark had wanted  to shoot himself in the water, with some idea of not letting the body be  found, he'd have put big stones in his pockets, and the only big stones  are near the water's edge, and they would have left marks, and they  haven't, and therefore he didn't, and oh, bother the pond; that can wait  till this afternoon. Bill, where does the secret passage begin?\"    \"Well, that's what we've got to find out, isn't it?\"    \"Yes. You see, my idea is this.\"    He explained his reasons for thinking that the secret of the passage was  concerned in some way with the secret of Robert's death, and went on:    \"My theory is that Mark discovered the passage about a year ago--the  time when he began to get keen on croquet. The passage came out into  the floor of the shed, and probably it was Cayley's idea to put a  croquet-box over the trap-door, so as to hide it more completely. You  know, when once you've discovered a secret yourself, it always seems  as if it must be so obvious to everybody else. I can imagine that Mark  loved having this little secret all to himself and to Cayley, of course,  but Cayley wouldn't count and they must have had great fun fixing it up,  and making it more difficult for other people to find out. Well then,  when Miss Norris was going to dress-up, Cayley gave it away. Probably  he told her that she could never get down to the bowling-green without  being discovered, and then perhaps showed that he knew there was one way  in which she could do it, and she wormed the secret out of him somehow.\"    \"But this was two or three days before Robert turned up.\"    \"Exactly. I am not suggesting that there was anything sinister about the  passage in the first place. It was just a little private bit of romance  and adventure for Mark, three days ago. He didn't even know that Robert  was coming. But somehow the passage has been used since, in connection  with Robert. Perhaps Mark escaped that way; perhaps he's hiding there  now. And if so, then the only person who could give him away was Miss  Norris. And she of course would only do it innocently not knowing that  the passage had anything to do with it.\"    \"So it was safer to have her out of the way?\"    \"Yes.\"    \"But, look here, Tony, why do you want to bother about this end of it?  We can always get in at the bowling-green end.\"    \"I know, but if we do that we shall have to do it openly. It will mean  breaking open the box, and letting Cayley know that we've done it. You  see, Bill, if we don't find anything out for ourselves in the next day  or two, we've got to tell the police what we have found out, and then  they can explore the passage for themselves. But I don't want to do that  yet.\"    \"Rather not.\"    \"So we've got to carry on secretly for a bit. It's the only way.\" He  smiled and added, \"And it's much more fun.\"    \"Rather!\" Bill chuckled to himself.    \"Very well. Where does the secret passage begin?\"          CHAPTER XI. The Reverend Theodore Ussher      \"There's one thing, which we have got to realize at once,\" said Antony,  \"and that is that if we don't find it easily, we shan't find it at all.\"    \"You mean that we shan't have time?\"    \"Neither time nor opportunity. Which is rather a consoling thought to a  lazy person like me.\"    \"But it makes it much harder, if we can't really look properly.\"    \"Harder to find, yes, but so much easier to look. For instance, the  passage might begin in Cayley's bedroom. Well, now we know that it  doesn't.\"    \"We don't know anything of the sort,\" protested Bill.    \"We--know for the purposes of our search. Obviously we can't go  tailing into Cayley's bedroom and tapping his wardrobes; and obviously,  therefore, if we are going to look for it at all, we must assume that it  doesn't begin there.\"    \"Oh, I see.\" Bill chewed a piece of grass thoughtfully. \"Anyhow, it  wouldn't begin on an upstairs floor, would it?\"    \"Probably not. Well, we're getting on.\"    \"You can wash out the kitchen and all that part of the house,\" said  Bill, after more thought. \"We can't go there.\"    \"Right. And the cellars, if there are any.\"    \"Well, that doesn't leave us much.\"    \"No. Of course it's only a hundred-to-one chance that we find it, but  what we want to consider is which is the most likely place of the few  places in which we can look safely.\"    \"All it amounts to,\" said Bill, \"is the living-rooms  downstairs--dining-room, library, hall, billiard-room and the office  rooms.\"    \"Yes, that's all.\"    \"Well, the office is the most likely, isn't it?\"    \"Yes. Except for one thing.\"    \"What's that?\"    \"Well, it's on the wrong side of the house. One would expect the passage  to start from the nearest place to which it is going. Why make it longer  by going under the house first?\"    \"Yes, that's true. Well, then, you think the dining-room or the  library?\"    \"Yes. And the library for choice. I mean for our choice. There are  always servants going into dining-rooms. We shouldn't have much of a  chance of exploring properly in there. Besides, there's another thing to  remember. Mark has kept this a secret for a year. Could he have kept  it a secret in the dining-room? Could Miss Norris have got into the  dining-room and used the secret door just after dinner without being  seen? It would have been much too risky.\"    Bill got up eagerly.    \"Come along,\" he said, \"let's try the library. If Cayley comes in, we  can always pretend we're choosing a book.\"    Antony got up slowly, took his arm and walked back to the house with  him.    The library was worth going into, passages or no passages. Antony could  never resist another person's bookshelves. As soon as he went into the  room, he found himself wandering round it to see what books the owner  read, or (more likely) did not read, but kept for the air which they  lent to the house. Mark had prided himself on his library. It was a  mixed collection of books. Books which he had inherited both from his  father and from his patron; books which he had bought because he was  interested in them or, if not in them, in the authors to whom he wished  to lend his patronage; books which he had ordered in beautifully bound  editions, partly because they looked well on his shelves, lending a  noble colour to his rooms, partly because no man of culture should ever  be without them; old editions, new editions, expensive books, cheap  books, a library in which everybody, whatever his taste, could be sure  of finding something to suit him.    \"And which is your particular fancy, Bill?\" said Antony, looking from  one shelf to another. \"Or are you always playing billiards?\"    \"I have a look at 'Badminton' sometimes,\" said Bill. \"It's over in that  corner there.\" He waved a hand.    \"Over here?\" said Antony, going to it.    \"Yes.\" He corrected himself suddenly.--\"Oh, no, it's not. It's over  there on the right now. Mark had a grand re-arrangement of his library  about a year ago. It took him more than a week, he told us. He's got  such a frightful lot, hasn't he?\"    \"Now that's very interesting,\" said Antony, and he sat down and filled  his pipe again.    There was indeed a \"frightful lot\" of books. The four walls of the  library were plastered with them from floor to ceiling, save only where  the door and the two windows insisted on living their own life, even  though an illiterate one. To Bill it seemed the most hopeless room of  any in which to look for a secret opening.    \"We shall have to take every blessed book down,\" he said, \"before we can  be certain that we haven't missed it.\"    \"Anyway,\" said Antony, \"if we take them down one at a time, nobody  can suspect us of sinister designs. After all, what does one go into a  library for, except to take books down?\"    \"But there's such a frightful lot.\"    Antony's pipe was now going satisfactorily, and he got up and walked  leisurely to the end of the wall opposite the door.    \"Well, let's have a look,\" he said, \"and see if they are so very  frightful. Hallo, here's your 'Badminton.' You often read that, you  say?\"    \"If I read anything.\"    \"Yes.\" He looked down and up the shelf. \"Sport and Travel chiefly. I  like books of travel, don't you?\"    \"They're"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/18721"],[0,"The Victim: A Romance of the Real Jefferson Davis (#16)"],[1,"from  the North--\"    He paused and swept the Northern tiers with a look of tender appeal.    \"I am sure there is not one of you, whatever sharp discussion there may  have been between us, to whom I can not now say in the presence of my  God, I wish you well!\"    Seward turned his head from the speaker, his eyes dimmed--the scheming  diplomat and unscrupulous politician lost in the heart of the man for  the moment.    \"Such I am sure is the feeling of the people whom I represent toward  those whom you represent. I but express their desire when I say I hope  and they hope for peaceful relations with you, though we must part--\"    He paused as if to suppress emotions too deep for words while a silence,  intense and suffocating, held the crowd in a spell. The speaker's voice  dropped to still lower and softer notes of persuasive tenderness as each  rounded word of the next sentence fell slowly from the thin lips.    \"If war must come, we can only invoke the God of our fathers, who  delivered us from the power of the lion, to protect us from the ravages  of the bear, and putting our trust in Him and in our firm hearts and  strong arms we will vindicate the right as best we may--\"    No cheer greeted this solemn utterance. In the pause which followed, the  speaker deliberately gazed over the familiar faces of his Northern  opponents and continued with a suppressed intensity of feeling that  gripped his bitterest foe.    \"In the course of my service here, associated at different times with a  great variety of Senators, I see now around me some with whom I have  served long. There have been points of collision, but, whatever offense  there has been to me, I leave here. I carry with me no hostile  remembrance. For whatever offense I may have given which has not been  redressed, or for which satisfaction has not been demanded, I have,  Senators, in this solemn hour of our parting to offer you my apology--\"    The low musical voice died softly away in the silence of tears.    A woman sobbed aloud.    Socola bent toward his trembling companion and whispered:    \"Who is she?\"    Jennie brushed the tears from her brown eyes before replying:    \"The Senator's wife. She's heart-broken over it all--didn't sleep a  wink all night. I've been looking for her to faint every minute.\"    The leader closed his portfolio. His hollow cheeks, thin lips and white  drawn face were clothed with an expression of sorrow beyond words as he  slowly turned and left the scene of his life's triumphs.    The spell of his eloquence at last thrown off the crowd once more  dissolved into hostile lowering groups.    Stern old Zack Chandler of Michigan collided with Jennie's father in the  cloak room, his eyes red with wrath.    \"Well, Barton,\" he growled, \"after the damned insolence of that scene if  the North don't fight, I'll be much mistaken--\"    \"You generally are, sir,\" Barton retorted.    \"If they don't fight, by the living God, I'll leave this country and  join another nation--the Comanche Indians preferred to this Government.\"    Barton glanced at his opponent and his heavy jaw closed with a snap.    \"I trust, Senator,\" he said with deliberate venom, \"you will not carry  out that resolution--the Comanche Indians have already suffered too much  from contact with the whites!\"    Dick Welford heard the shot and gripped the fierce old Southerner's hand  as Chandler turned on his heel and disappeared with an oath.    \"You got him that time, Senator!\"    Barton laughed with boyish glee.    \"I did, didn't I? Sometimes we can only think of our best things when  it's too late. But by Gimminy I got the old rascal this time, didn't I?\"    \"You certainly plugged him--what did you think of the speeches?\"    \"Clay said something! Davis is too slow. He's got no blood in his  veins. I don't like him. He'll pull us back into the Union yet if we  don't watch him. He's a reconstructionist at heart. The State of  Mississippi is dragging him out of Washington by the heels. He makes me  tired. The time for talk has passed. To your tents now, O Israel!\"    Dick hurried to the gallery and watched Socola talking in his graceful  Italian way with Jennie. He had hated this elegant foreigner the moment  he had laid eyes on him. He made up his mind to declare himself before  another sun set.    He ignored the Italian's existence.    \"You are ready, Miss Jennie?\"    She took Dick's proffered arm in silence and bowed to Socola who watched  them go with a peculiar smile playing about his handsome mouth.    Jennie insisted on stopping at Senator Davis' home to tell his wife of  the wonderful power with which his speech had swept the galleries.    The house was still, the library door open. The girl paused on the  threshold in awe. The Senator's tall figure was lying prostrate across  his desk, his thin hands clasped in prayer, his face buried in his arms.  His lips were murmuring words too low to be heard until at last they  swelled in sorrowful repetition:    \"May God have us in his holy keeping and grant that before it is too  late peaceful councils may prevail!\"    The girl turned softly and left without a word.          CHAPTER III    A MIDNIGHT SESSION      The Secretary of War invited Socola to join him at the White House after  the Cabinet meeting which President Buchanan had called at the unusual  hour of ten at night. He had waited for more than two hours in the  anteroom and still the Cabinet was in session. Without show of  impatience he smoked cigar after cigar, flicked their ashes into the  fireplace and listened with an expression of quiet amusement to the  storm raging within while the sleet of a January blizzard rattled  against the windows with increasing fury.    Once more the question of the little fort in the harbor of Charleston  had plunged the discordant Cabinet of the dying administration into the  convulsions of a miniature war.    The feeble old President, overwhelmed by the gathering storm, crouched  in the corner by the fire. His emaciated figure was shrouded in a  ridiculous old dressing-gown. Mentally and physically prostrate he sat  shivering while his ministers wrangled.    He rose at last, shambled to the Cabinet table, and leaned his trembling  hands on it for support.    \"What can I do, gentlemen--what can I do? If Anderson hadn't gone into  that fort at night, the State of South Carolina might not have  seceded--\"    Stanton shook his massive head with an expression of uncontrollable  rage.    \"Great God!\"    The President continued in feeble, pleading tones:    \"Now they tell me that unless Anderson withdraws his troops their  presence will provoke bloodshed--\"    \"Let them fire on him if they dare!\" shouted Stanton.    \"I cannot plunge my country into fratricidal war. My sands are nearly  run. I only ask of God that my sun may not set in a sea of blood--\"    He paused and lifted his thin hands, trembling like two withered leaves  of aspen in the winter's blast.    \"What can I do?\"    Stanton suddenly sprang from his seat and confronted the shivering old  man.    \"I'll tell you what you can _not_ do!\"    The President gasped for breath and listened helplessly.    \"You can't yield that fort to the conspirators who demand it. Dare to do  it, and I tell you, as the Attorney General of the United States, you  are guilty of high treason--and by the living God you should be hung!\"    The venerable Secretary of the Navy, Isaac Toucey, lifted his hand in  protest. Stanton merely threw him a look of scorn, and shouted into the  President's face:    \"Your act could no more be defended than Benedict Arnold's!\"    \"And what say you, Holt?\" the President asked, turning to his  heavy-jawed Secretary of War.    \"Send a ship to the relief of Sumter within twenty-four hours, and let  South Carolina take the consequences--\"    \"Good!\" Stanton cried.    Holt's crooked mouth was drawn in grim lines, and the left-hand corner  was twisted into a still lower knot of ugly muscles. His furtive eyes  beneath their shaggy brows glanced quickly around the table to see the  effect of his patriotic stand.    The President turned to the white-haired Secretary of the Navy:    \"And you, General Toucey?\"    The venerable statesman from Connecticut bowed gravely to his Chief and  spoke with quiet dignity.    \"I would order Anderson to return at once to Fort Moultrie--\"    Stanton smashed the table with his big fist.    \"And you know that the State of South Carolina has dismantled Fort  Moultrie?\"    Toucey answered Stanton's bluster with quiet emphasis.    \"I'm aware of that fact, sir!\"    \"And it makes no difference?\"    \"None whatever. Anderson left Fort Moultrie and moved into Fort Sumter  without orders--\"    A faint smile flickered about the drooping corners of Holt's mouth--    The speaker turned to Holt:    \"As a matter of fact, he moved into that fort against the positive  orders of your predecessor, James B. Floyd, the Secretary of War. As he  went there without orders, and against orders, he should be ordered back  forthwith--\"    \"With the look of a maddened tiger Stanton flew at him.    \"And you expect to go back to Connecticut after making that statement?\"    \"I do, sir--\"    \"I couldn't believe it.\"    \"And why, pray?\"    \"I asked the question in good faith, that I might know the character of  the people of Connecticut, or your estimate of them.\"    The old man drew himself up with cold dignity.    \"I have served the people of my State for over forty years--their  Congressman, their Attorney General, their Governor, their Senator. I  consult no upstart of your feeble record, sir, on any question of  principle or policy!\"    Stanton quailed a moment beneath the cold scorn of his antagonist,  surprised that another man should dare to use his methods of invective.    He lifted his hands with a gesture of contempt.    \"All I can say is, that if I should dare take that position and return  to the State of Pennsylvania, I should expect to be stoned the"]]]
