We have been with thee at all times, and found thee clinging  unto the Branch and heedless of the Root.... Open thine eyes, that thou  mayest behold this Glorious Vision and recognize Him Whom thou invokest in  the daytime and in the night season, and gaze on the Light that shineth  above this luminous Horizon.\"    The House of Hapsburg, in which the Imperial Title had remained  practically hereditary for almost five centuries, was, ever since those  words were uttered, being increasingly menaced by the forces of internal  disintegration, and was sowing the seeds of an external conflict, to both  of which it ultimately succumbed. Francis Joseph, Emperor of Austria, King  of Hungary, a reactionary ruler, reestablished old abuses, ignored the  rights of nationalities, and restored that bureaucratic centralization  that proved in the end so injurious to his empire. Repeated tragedies  darkened his reign. His brother Maximilian was shot in Mexico. The Crown  Prince Rudolph perished in a dishonorable affair. The Empress was  assassinated in Geneva. Archduke Francis Ferdinand and his wife were  murdered in Sarajevo, kindling a war in the midst of which the Emperor  himself died, closing a reign which is unsurpassed by any other reign in  the disasters it brought to the nation.            END OF THE HOLY ROMAN EMPIRE      Belated efforts had been made to steady his tottering throne. The  \"ramshackle empire,\" a medley of states, races, and languages, was,  however, relentlessly and rapidly disintegrating. The political and  economic situation was desperate. The defeat of Austria and Hungary, in  that same war, sounded its death knell and brought its dismemberment.  Hungary sundered its connection. The conglomerate realm was carved up, and  all that was left of the once formidable Holy Roman Empire was a shrunken  republic that led a miserable existence until, in more recent times, it  was, unlike its sister nation, completely extinguished and wiped off the  political map of Europe.    Such was the fate of the Napoleonic, the Romanov, the Hohenzollern, and  the Hapsburg empires, whose rulers, together with the sovereign occupant  of the Papal throne, were individually addressed by the Pen of the Most  High, and who were respectively chastised, forewarned, condemned, rebuked  and admonished. What of the fate of those sovereigns who, exercising  direct political jurisdiction over the Faith, its Founders, and followers,  and within the radius of whose domains that Faith was born and first  spread, were at liberty to crucify its Herald, banish its Founder, and mow  down its adherents?            WHAT OF TURKEY AND PERSIA?      Already in the lifetime of Baha'u'llah, and later during the ministry of  'Abdu'l-Baha, the first blows of a slow yet steady and relentless  retribution were falling alike upon the rulers of the Turkish House of  U_th_man and of the Qajar dynasty in Persia--the archenemies of God's  infant Faith. Sultan 'Abdu'l-'Aziz fell from power, and was murdered soon  after Baha'u'llah's banishment from Adrianople, while Nasiri'd-Din _Sh_ah  succumbed to an assassin's pistol, during 'Abdu'l-Baha's incarceration in  the fortress-town of Akka. It was reserved, however, for the Formative  Period of the Faith of God--the Age of the birth and rise of its  Administrative Order--which, as stated in a previous communication, is  through its unfoldment casting such a turmoil in the world, to witness not  only the extinction of both of these dynasties, but also the abolition of  the twin institutions of the Sultanate and the Caliphate.    Of the two despots 'Abdu'l-'Aziz was the more powerful, the more exalted  in rank, the more preeminent in guilt, and the more concerned with the  tribulations and fortunes of the Founder of our Faith. He it was who,  through his farmans, had thrice banished Baha'u'llah, and in whose  dominions the Manifestation of God spent almost the whole of His forty  years' captivity. It was during his reign and that of his nephew and  successor, 'Abdu'l-Hamid II, that the Center of the Covenant of God had to  endure, for no less than forty years, in the fortress-town of Akka, an  incarceration fraught with so many perils, affronts and privations.    \"Hearken, O king!\" is the summons issued to Sultan 'Abdu'l-'Aziz by  Baha'u'llah, \"to the speech of Him that speaketh the truth, Him that doth  not ask thee to recompense Him with the things God hath chosen to bestow  upon thee, Him Who unerringly treadeth the Straight Path.... Observe, O  king, with thine inmost heart and with thy whole being, the precepts of  God, and walk not in the paths of the oppressor.... Place not thy reliance  on thy treasures. Put thy whole confidence in the grace of God, thy  Lord.... Overstep not the bounds of moderation, and deal justly with them  that serve thee.... Set before thine eyes God's unerring Balance, and, as  one standing in His presence, weigh in that Balance thine actions, every  day, every moment of thy life. Bring thyself to account ere thou art  summoned to a reckoning, on the Day when no man shall have strength to  stand for fear of God, the Day when the hearts of the heedless ones shall  be made to tremble.\"    \"The day is approaching,\" Baha'u'llah thus prophesies in the Lawh-i-Ra'is,  \"when the Land of Mystery [Adrianople], and what is beside it shall be  changed, and shall pass out of the hands of the king, and commotions shall  appear, and the voice of lamentation shall be raised, and the evidences of  mischief shall be revealed on all sides, and confusion shall spread by  reason of that which hath befallen these captives at the hands of the  hosts of oppression. The course of things shall be altered, and conditions  shall wax so grievous, that the very sands on the desolate hills will  moan, and the trees on the mountain will weep, and blood will flow out of  all things. Then wilt thou behold the people in sore distress.\"    \"Soon,\" He, moreover has written, \"will He seize you in His wrathful  anger, and sedition will be stirred up in your midst, and your dominions  will be disrupted. Then will ye bewail and lament, and will find none to  help or succor you.... Several times calamities have overtaken you, and  yet ye failed utterly to take heed. One of them was the conflagration  which devoured most of the City [Constantinople] with the flames of  justice, and concerning which many poems were written, stating that no  such fire had ever been witnessed. And yet, ye waxed more heedless....  Plague, likewise, broke out, and ye still failed to give heed! Be  expectant, however, for the wrath of God is ready to overtake you. Erelong  will ye behold that which hath been sent down from the Pen of My command.\"    \"By your deeds,\" He, in another Tablet, anticipating the fall of the  Sultanate and the Caliphate, thus reproves the combined forces of Sunni  and _Sh_i'ih Islam, \"the exalted station of the people hath been abased,  the standard of Islam hath been reversed, and its mighty throne hath  fallen.\"    And finally, in the Kitab-i-Aqdas, revealed soon after Baha'u'llah's  banishment to Akka, He thus apostrophizes the seat of Turkish imperial  power: \"O Spot that art situate on the shores of the two seas! The throne  of tyranny hath, verily, been stablished upon thee, and the flame of  hatred hath been kindled within thy bosom.... Thou art indeed filled with  manifest pride. Hath thine outward splendor made thee vainglorious? By Him  Who is the Lord of mankind! It shall soon perish, and thy daughters, and  thy widows, and all the kindreds that dwell within thee shall lament. Thus  informeth thee, the All-Knowing, the All-Wise.\"    Indeed, in a most remarkable passage in the Lawh-i-Fu'ad, wherein mention  has been made of the death of Fu'ad Pa_sh_a, the Turkish Minister of  Foreign Affairs, the fall of the Sultan himself is unmistakably foretold:  \"Soon will We dismiss the one who was like unto him, and will lay hold on  their Chief who ruleth the land, and I, verily, am the Almighty, the  All-Compelling.\"    The Sultan's reaction to these words, bearing upon his person, his empire,  his throne, his capital, and his ministers, can be gathered from the  recital of the sufferings he inflicted on Baha'u'llah, and already  referred to in the beginning of these pages. The extinction of the  \"outward splendor\" surrounding that proud seat of Imperial power is the  theme I now proceed to expose.            THE DOOM OF IMPERIAL TURKEY      A cataclysmic process, one of the most remarkable in modern history, was  set in motion ever since Baha'u'llah, while a prisoner in Constantinople,  delivered to a Turkish official His Tablet, addressed to Sultan  'Abdu'l-'Aziz and his ministers, to be transmitted to 'Ali Pa_sh_a, the  Grand Vizir. It was this Tablet which, as attested by that officer and  affirmed by Nabil in his chronicle, affected the Vizir so profoundly that  he paled while reading it. This process received fresh impetus after the  Lawh-i-Ra'is was revealed on the morrow of its Author's final banishment  from Adrianople to Akka. Relentless, devastating, and with ever-increasing  momentum, it ominously unfolded, damaging the prestige of the Empire,  dismembering its territory, dethroning its sultans, sweeping away their  dynasty, degrading and deposing its Caliph, disestablishing its religion,  and extinguishing its glory. The \"sick man\" of Europe, whose condition had  been unerringly diagnosed by the Divine Physician, and whose doom was  pronounced inevitable, fell a prey, during the reign of five successive  sultans, all degenerate, all deposed, to a series of convulsions which, in  the end, proved fatal to his life. Imperial Turkey that had, under  'Abdu'l-Majid, been admitted"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/19284"],[0,"Paris Talks (#16)"],[1,"does not yet know God. If he  had knowledge of God he could not act in direct opposition to His laws; if  he were spiritually minded such a line of conduct would be impossible to  him. If only the laws and precepts of the prophets of God had been  believed, understood and followed, wars would no longer darken the face of  the earth.    If man had even the rudiments of justice, such a state of things would be  impossible.    Therefore, I say unto you pray--pray and turn your faces to God, that He,  in His infinite compassion and mercy, may help and succour these misguided  ones. Pray that He will grant them spiritual understanding and teach them  tolerance and mercy, that the eyes of their minds may be opened and that  they may be endued with the gift of the spirit. Then would peace and love  walk hand in hand through the lands, and these poor unhappy people might  have rest.    Let us all strive night and day to help in the bringing about of better  conditions. My heart is broken by these terrible things and cries  aloud--may this cry reach other hearts!    Then will the blind see, the dead will be raised, and Justice will come  and reign upon the earth.    I beseech you all to pray with heart and soul that this may be  accomplished.          WE MUST NOT BE DISCOURAGED BY THE SMALLNESS OF OUR NUMBERS      November 25th    When Christ appeared He manifested Himself at Jerusalem. He called men to  the Kingdom of God, He invited them to Eternal Life and He told them to  acquire human perfections. The Light of Guidance was shed forth by that  radiant Star, and He at length gave His life in sacrifice for humanity.    All through His blessed life He suffered oppression and hardship, and in  spite of all this humanity was His enemy!    They denied Him, scorned Him, ill-treated Him and cursed Him. He was not  treated like a man--and yet in spite of all this He was the embodiment of  pity and of supreme goodness and love.    He loved all humanity, but they treated Him as an enemy and were incapable  of appreciating Him. They set no value on His words and were not illumined  by the flame of His love.    Later they realized who He was; that He was the Sacred and Divine Light,  and that His words held Eternal Life.    His heart was full of love for all the world, His goodness was destined to  reach each one--and as they began to realize these things, they  repented--but He had been crucified!    It was not until many years after His ascension that they knew who He was,  and at the time of His ascension He had only a very few disciples; only a  comparatively small following believed His precepts and followed His laws.  The ignorant said, 'Who is this individual; He has only a few disciples!'  But those who knew said: 'He is the Sun who will shine in the East and in  the West, He is the Manifestation who shall give life to the world'.    What the first disciples had seen the world realized later.    Therefore, you who are in Europe, do not be discouraged because you are  few or because people think that your Cause is of no importance. If few  people come to your gatherings do not lose heart, and if you are ridiculed  and contradicted be not distressed, for the apostles of Christ had the  same to bear. They were reviled and persecuted, cursed and ill-treated,  but in the end they were victorious and their enemies were found to be  wrong.    If history should repeat itself and all these same things should happen to  you, do not be saddened but be full of joy, and thank God that you are  called upon to suffer as holy men of old suffered. If they oppose you be  gentle with them, if they contradict be firm in your faith, if they desert  you and flee from before you, seek them out and treat them kindly. Do harm  to nobody; pray for all; try to make your light shine in the world and let  your banner fly high in the Heavens. The beautiful perfume of your noble  lives will permeate everywhere. The light of truth kindled in your hearts  will shine out to the distant horizon!    The indifference and scorn of the world matters not at all, whereas your  lives will be of the greatest importance.    All those who seek truth in the Heavenly Kingdom shine like the stars;  they are like fruit trees laden with choice fruit, like seas full of  precious pearls.    Only have faith in the Mercy of God, and spread the Divine Truth.          WORDS SPOKEN BY 'ABDU'L-BAHA IN PASTOR WAGNER'S CHURCH (FOYER DE L'AME) IN  PARIS      November 26th    I am deeply touched by the sympathetic words which have been addressed to  me, and I hope that day by day true love and affection may grow among us.  God has willed that love should be a vital force in the world, and you all  know how I rejoice to speak of love.    All down the ages the prophets of God have been sent into the world to  serve the cause of truth--Moses brought the law of truth, and all the  prophets of Israel after him sought to spread it.    When Jesus came He lighted the flaming torch of truth, and carried it  aloft so that the whole world might be illumined thereby. After Him came  His chosen apostles, and they went far and wide, carrying the light of  their Master's teaching into a dark world--and, in their turn, passed on.    Then came Muhammad, who in His time and way spread the knowledge of truth  among a savage people; for this has always been the mission of God's  elect.    So, at last, when Baha'u'llah arose in Persia, this was His most ardent  desire, to rekindle the waning light of truth in all lands. All the holy  ones of God have tried with heart and soul to spread the light of love and  unity throughout the world, so that the darkness of materiality might  disappear and the light of spirituality might shine forth among the  children of men. Then would hate, slander and murder disappear, and in  their stead love, unity and peace would reign.    All the Manifestations of God came with the same purpose, and they have  all sought to lead men into the paths of virtue. Yet we, their servants,  still dispute among ourselves! Why is it thus? Why do we not love one  another and live in unity?    It is because we have shut our eyes to the underlying principle of all  religions, that God is one, that He is the Father of us all, that we are  all immersed in the ocean of His mercy and sheltered and protected by His  loving care.    The glorious Sun of Truth shines for all alike, the waters of Divine Mercy  immerse each one, and His Divine favour is bestowed on all His children.    This loving God desires peace for all His creatures--why, then, do they  spend their time in war?    He loves and protects all His children--why do they forget Him?    He bestows His Fatherly care on us all--why do we neglect our brothers?    Surely, when we realize how God loves and cares for us, we should so order  our lives that we may become more like Him.    God has created us, one and all--why do we act in opposition to His wishes,  when we are all His children, and love the same Father? All these  divisions we see on all sides, all these disputes and opposition, are  caused because men cling to ritual and outward observances, and forget the  simple, underlying truth. It is the outward practices of religion that are  so different, and it is they that cause disputes and enmity--while the  reality is always the same, and one. The Reality is the Truth, and truth  has no division. Truth is God's guidance, it is the light of the world, it  is love, it is mercy. These attributes of truth are also human virtues  inspired by the Holy Spirit.    So let us one and all hold fast to truth, and we shall be free indeed!    The day is coming when all the religions of the world will unite, for in  principle they are one already. There is no need for division, seeing that  it is only the outward forms that separate them. Among the sons of men  some souls are suffering through ignorance, let us hasten to teach them;  others are like children needing care and education until they are grown,  and some are sick--to these we must carry Divine healing.    Whether ignorant, childish or sick, they must be loved and helped, and not  disliked because of their imperfection.    Doctors of religion were instituted to bring spiritual healing to the  peoples and to be the cause of unity among the nations. If they become the  cause of division they had better not exist! A remedy is given to cure a  disease, but if it only succeeds in aggravating the complaint, it is  better to leave it alone. If religion is only to be a cause of disunion it  had better not exist.    All the Divine Manifestations sent by God into the world would have gone  through their terrible hardships and sufferings for the single hope of  spreading Truth, unity and concord among men. Christ endured a life of  sorrow, pain and grief, to bring a perfect example of love into the  world--and in spite of this we continue to act in a contrary spirit one  towards the other!    Love is the fundamental principle of God's purpose for man, and He has  commanded us to love each other even as He loves us. All these discords  and disputes which we hear on all sides only tend to increase materiality.    The world for the most part is sunk in materialism, and the blessings of  the Holy Spirit are ignored. There is so little real spiritual feeling,  and the progress of the world is for the most part merely material. Men  are becoming like unto beasts that perish, for we know that they have no  spiritual feeling--they do not turn to God, they have no religion! These  things belong to man alone, and if he is without them he is a prisoner of  nature, and no whit better than an animal.    How can man be content to lead only an animal existence when God has made  him so high a creature? All creation is made subject to the laws of  nature, but man has been able to conquer these laws. The sun, in spite of  its power and glory, is bound by the laws of nature, and cannot change its  course by"]]]
