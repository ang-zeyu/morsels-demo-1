She wore broad gold bangles upon her bare arms,  and her fingers were laden with jewellery. A heavy girdle swung from  her hips, defining the lines of her slim shape, and about one white  ankle was a gold band.    As she appeared in the doorway I almost entirely closed my eyes, but  my gaze rested fascinatedly upon the little red slippers which she  wore.    Again I detected the exquisite, elusive perfume which, like a breath  of musk, spoke of the Orient; and, as always, it played havoc with my  reason, seeming to intoxicate me as though it were the very essence of  her loveliness.    But I had a part to play, and throwing out one clenched hand so that  my fist struck upon the floor, I uttered a loud groan, and made as if  to rise upon my knees.    One quick glimpse I had of her wonderful eyes, widely opened and  turned upon me with such an enigmatical expression as set my heart  leaping wildly--then, stepping back, Karamaneh placed the lamp upon  the boards of the passage and clapped her hands.    As I sank upon the floor in assumed exhaustion, a Chinaman with a  perfectly impassive face, and a Burman whose pock-marked, evil  countenance was set in an apparently habitual leer, came running into  the room past the girl.    With a hand which trembled violently, she held the lamp whilst the two  yellow ruffians tied me. I groaned and struggled feebly, fixing my  gaze upon the lamp bearer in a silent reproach which was by no means  without its effect.    She lowered her eyes and I could see her biting her lip, whilst the  colour gradually faded from her cheeks. Then, glancing up again  quickly, and still meeting that reproachful stare, she turned her head  aside altogether, and rested one hand upon the wall, swaying slightly  as she did so.    It was a singular ordeal for more than one of that incongruous group;  but in order that I may not be charged with hypocrisy or with seeking  to hide my own folly, I confess, here, that when again I found myself  in darkness, my heart was leaping not because of the success of my  strategy, but because of the success of that reproachful glance which  I had directed toward the lovely, dark-eyed Karamaneh, toward the  faithless evil Karamaneh! So much for myself.    The door had not been closed ten seconds, ere Smith again was spitting  out the gag, swearing under his breath, and stretching his cramped  limbs free from their binding. Within a minute from the time of my  trussing, I was a free man again; save that look where I would--to  right, to left, or inward, to my own conscience--two dark eyes met  mine, enigmatically.    \"What now?\" I whispered.    \"Let me think,\" replied Smith. \"A false move would destroy us.\"    \"How long have you been here?\"    \"Since last night.\"    \"Is Fu-Manchu--\"    \"Fu-Manchu is here!\" replied Smith grimly, \"and not only Fu-Manchu,  but--another.\"    \"Another!\"    \"A higher than Fu-Manchu, apparently. I have an idea of the identity  of this person, but no more than an idea. Something unusual is going  on, Petrie; otherwise I should have been a dead man twenty four hours  ago. Something even more important than my death engages Fu-Manchu's  attention--and this can only be the presence of the mysterious  visitor. Your seductive friend, Karamaneh, is arrayed in her very  becoming national costume in his honour, I presume.\" He stopped  abruptly; then added \"I would give five hundred pounds for a glimpse  of that visitor's face!\"    \"Is Burke--?\"    \"God knows what has become of Burke, Petrie! We were both caught  napping in the establishment of the amiable Shen-Yan, where, amid a  very mixed company of poker players, we were losing our money like  gentlemen.\"    \"But Weymouth--\"    \"Burke and I had both been neatly sand-bagged, my dear Petrie, and  removed elsewhere, some hours before Weymouth raided the gaming house.  Oh! I don't know how they smuggled us away with the police watching  the place; but my presence here is sufficient evidence of the fact.  Are you armed?\"    \"No; my pistol was in my raincoat, which is missing.\"    In the dim light from the broken window I could see Smith tugging  reflectively at the lobe of his left ear.    \"I am without arms, too,\" he mused. \"We might escape from the  window--\"    \"It's a long drop!\"    \"Ah! I imagined so. If only I had a pistol, or a revolver--\"    \"What should you do?\"    \"I should present myself before the important meeting, which, I am  assured, is being held somewhere in this building; and to-night would  see the end of my struggle with the Fu-Manchu group--the end of the  whole Yellow menace! For not only is Fu-Manchu here, Petrie, with all  his gang of assassins, but he whom I believe to be the real head of  the group--a certain mandarin--is here also!\"          CHAPTER XIII    THE SACRED ORDER      Smith stepped quietly across the room and tried the door. It proved to  be unlocked, and an instant later we were both outside in the passage.  Coincident with our arrival there, arose a sudden outcry from some  place at the westward end. A high-pitched, grating voice, in which  guttural notes alternated with a serpent-like hissing, was raised in  anger.    \"Dr. Fu-Manchu!\" whispered Smith, grasping my arm.    Indeed it was the unmistakable voice of the Chinaman, raised  hysterically in one of those outbursts which in the past I had  diagnosed as symptomatic of dangerous mania.    The voice rose to a scream, the scream of some angry animal rather  than anything human. Then, chokingly, it ceased. Another short sharp  cry followed--but not in the voice of Fu-Manchu--a dull groan, and the  sound of a fall.    With Smith still grasping my wrist, I shrank back into the doorway, as  something that looked in the darkness like a great ball of fluff came  rapidly along the passage toward me. Just at my feet the thing  stopped, and I made it out for a small animal. The tiny, gleaming eyes  looked up at me, and, chattering wickedly, the creature bounded past  and was lost from view.    It was Dr. Fu-Manchu's marmoset.    Smith dragged me back into the room which we had just left. As he  partly reclosed the door, I heard the clapping of hands. In a  condition of most dreadful suspense, we waited; until a new, ominous  sound proclaimed itself. Some heavy body was being dragged into the  passage. I heard the opening of a trap. Exclamations in guttural  voices told of a heavy task in progress; there was a great straining  and creaking--whereupon the trap was softly reclosed.    Smith bent to my ear.    \"Fu-Manchu has chastised one of his servants,\" he whispered. \"There  will be food for the grappling-irons to-night!\"    I shuddered violently, for, without Smith's words, I knew that a  bloody deed had been done in that house within a few yards of where we  stood.    In the new silence, I could hear the drip, drip, drip of the rain  outside the window; then a steam siren hooted dismally upon the river,  and I thought how the screw of that very vessel, even as we listened,  might be tearing the body of Fu-Manchu's servant!    \"Have you some one waiting?\" whispered Smith eagerly.    \"How long was I insensible?\"    \"About half an hour.\"    \"Then the cabman will be waiting.\"    \"Have you a whistle with you?\"    I felt in my coat pocket.    \"Yes,\" I reported.    \"Good! Then we will take a chance.\"    Again we slipped out into the passage and began a stealthy progress to  the west. Ten paces amid absolute darkness, and we found ourselves  abreast of a branch corridor. At the farther end, through a kind of  little window, a dim light shone.    \"See if you can find the trap,\" whispered Smith; \"light your lamp.\"    I directed the ray of the pocket lamp upon the floor, and there at my  feet was a square wooden trap. As I stooped to examine it, I glanced  back painfully, over my shoulder--and saw Nayland Smith tiptoeing away  from me along the passage toward the light!    Inwardly I cursed his folly, but the temptation to peep in at that  little window proved too strong for me, as it had proved too strong  for him.    Fearful that some board would creak beneath my tread, I followed; and  side by side we two crouched, looking into a small rectangular room.  It was a bare and cheerless apartment, with unpapered walls and  carpetless floor. A table and a chair constituted the sole furniture.    Seated in the chair, with his back towards us, was a portly Chinaman  who wore a yellow, silken robe. His face it was impossible to see; but  he was beating his fists upon the table, and pouring out a torrent of  words in a thin, piping voice. So much I perceived at a glance, then,  into view at the distant end of the room, paced a tall,  high-shouldered figure--a figure, unforgettable, at once imposing and  dreadful, stately and sinister.    With the long, bony hands behind him, fingers twining and intertwining  serpentinely about the handle of a little fan, and with the pointed  chin resting on the breast of the yellow robe, so that the light from  the lamp swinging in the centre of the ceiling gleamed upon the great,  dome-like brow, this tall man paced sombrely from left to right.    He cast a sidelong, venomous glance at the voluble speaker out of  half-shut eyes; in the act they seemed to light up as with an internal  luminance; momentarily, they sparkled like emeralds; then their  brilliance was filmed over as one sees in the eyes of a bird when the  membrane is lowered.    My blood seemed to chill, and my heart to double its pulsations;  beside me Smith was breathing more rapidly than usual. I knew now the  explanation of the feeling which had claimed me when first I had  descended the stone stairs. I knew what it was that hung like a miasma  over that house. It was the aura, the glamour, which radiated from  this wonderful and evil man as light radiates from radium. It was the  _vril_, the _force_, of Dr. Fu-Manchu.    I began to move away from the window. But Smith held my wrist as "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/19145"],[0,"The Time Traders (#16)"],[1,"to sleep on the third night, believed that he was  more completely bewildered than indoctrinated. He said as much sourly to  McNeil.    \"Base has pulled back three other teams,\" McNeil replied. \"But the men  have to go to school again, and they won't be ready to come on for maybe  three, four weeks. To change runs means unlearning stuff as well as  learning it----\"    \"What about new men?\"    \"Don't think Kelgarries isn't out now beating the bushes for some! Only,  we have to be fitted to the physical type we are supposed to represent.  For instance, set a small, dark-headed pugnose among your Norse sea  rovers, and he's going to be noticed--maybe remembered too well. We  can't afford to take that chance. So Kelgarries had to discover men who  not only look the part but are also temperamentally fitted for this job.  You can't plant a fellow who thinks as a seaman--not a seaman, you  understand, but one whose mind works in that pattern--among a wandering  tribe of cattle herders. The protection for the man and the project lies  in his being fitted into the right spot at the right time.\"    Ross had never really thought of that point before. Now he realized that  he and Ashe and McNeil were of a common mold. All about the same  height, they shared brown hair and light eyes--Ashe's blue, his own  gray, and McNeil's hazel--and they were of similar build, small-boned,  lean, and quick-moving. He had not seen any of the true Beakermen except  on the films. But now, recalling those, he could see that the three time  traders were of the same general physical type as the far-roving people  they used as a cover.    It was on the morning of the fifth day while the three were studying a  map Webb had produced that Kelgarries, followed at his own weighty pace  by Millaird, burst in upon them.    \"We have it! This time _we_ have the luck! The Reds slipped. Oh, how  they slipped!\"    Webb watched the major, a thin little smile pulling at his pursed mouth.  \"Miracles sometimes do happen,\" he remarked. \"I suppose the sub has a  fix for us.\"    Kelgarries passed over the flimsy strip of paper he had been waving as a  banner of triumph. Webb read the notation on it and bent over the map,  making a mark with one of those needle-sharp pencils which seemed to  grow in his breast pocket, ready for use. Then he made a second mark.    \"Well, it narrows it a bit,\" he conceded. Ashe looked in turn and  laughed.    \"I would like to hear your definition of 'narrow' sometime, Miles.  Remember we have to cover this on foot, and a difference of twenty miles  can mean a lot.\"    \"That mark is quite a bit in from the sea.\" McNeil offered his own  protest when he saw the marking. \"We don't know that country--\"    Webb shoved his glasses back for the hundredth time that morning. \"I  suppose we could consider this critical, condition red,\" he said in such  a dubious tone that he might have been begging someone to protest his  statement. But no one did. Millaird was busy with the map.    \"I think we do, Miles!\" He looked to Ashe. \"You'll parachute in. The  packs with which you will be equipped are special stuff. Once you have  them off sprinkle them with a powder Miles will provide and in ten  minutes there won't be enough of them left for anyone to identify. We  haven't but a dozen of these, and we can't throw them away except in a  crisis. Find the base and rig up the detector. Your fix in this time  will be easy--but it is the other end of the line we must have. Until  you locate that, stick to the job. Don't communicate with us until you  have it!\"    \"There is the possibility,\" Ashe pointed out, \"the Reds may have more  than one intermediate post. They probably have played it smart and set  up a series of them to spoil a direct trace, as each would lead only to  another farther back in time----\"    \"All right. If that proves true, just get us the next one back,\"  Millaird returned. \"From that we can trace them along if we must send in  some of the boys wearing dinosaur skins later. We _have_ to find their  primary base, and if that hunt goes the hard way, well, we do it the  hard way.\"    \"How did you get the fix?\" McNeil asked.    \"One of their field parties ran into trouble and yelled for help.\"    \"Did they get it?\"    The major grinned. \"What do you think? You know the rules--and the ones  the Reds play by are twice as tough on their own men.\"    \"What kind of trouble?\" Ashe wanted to know.    \"Some kind of a local religious dispute. We do our best with their code,  but we're not a hundred per cent perfect in reading it. I gather they  were playing with a local god and got their fingers burned.\"    \"Lurgha again, eh?\" Ashe smiled.    \"Foolish,\" Webb said impatiently. \"That is a silly thing to do. You were  almost over the edge of prudence yourself, Gordon, with that Lurgha  business. To use the Great Mother was a ticklish thing to try, and you  were lucky to get out of it so easily.\"    \"Once was enough,\" Ashe agreed. \"Though using it may have saved our  lives. But I assure you I am not starting a holy war or setting up as a  prophet.\"    Ross had been taught something of map reading, but mentally he could not  make what he saw on paper resemble the countryside. A few landmarks, if  there were any outstanding ones, were all he could hope to impress upon  his memory until he was actually on the ground.    Landing there according to Millaird's instruction was another experience  he would not have chosen of his own accord. To jump was a matter of  timing, and in the dark with a measure of rain thrown in, the action was  anything but pleasant. Leaving the plane in a blind, follow-the-leader  fashion, Ross found the descent into darkness one of the worst trials he  had yet faced. But he did not make too bad a landing in the small  parklike expanse they had chosen for their target.    Ross pulled loose his harness and chute, dragging them to what he judged  to be the center of the clearing. Hearing a plaintive bray from the air,  he dodged as one of the two burden asses sent to join them landed and  began to kick at its trappings. The animals they had chosen were the  most docile available and they had been given sedation before the jump  so that now, feeling Ross's hands, the donkey stood quietly while Ross  stripped it of its hanging straps.    \"Rossa--\" The sound of his Beaker name called through the dark brought  Ross facing in the other direction.    \"Here, and I have one of the donkeys.\"    \"And I the other!\" That was McNeil.    Their eyes adjusted to a gloom which was not as thick as it would be in  the forest and they worked fast. Then they dragged the parachutes  together in a heap. The rain would, Webb had assured them, add to the  rapid destruction wrought by the chemical he had provided. Ashe shook it  over the pile, and there was a faint greenish glow. Then they moved away  to the woodland and made camp for the balance of the night.    So much of their whole exploit depended upon luck, and this small part  had been successful. Unless some agent had been stationed to watch for  their arrival Ross believed they could not be spotted.    The rest of their plan was elastic. Posing as traders who had come to  open a new station, they were to stay near a river which drained a lake  and then angled southward to the distant sea. They knew this section was  only sparsely settled by small tribes, hardly larger than family clans.  These people were generations behind the civilized level of the  villagers of Britain--roving hunters who followed the sweep of game  north or south with the seasons.    Along the seashore the fishermen had established more permanent holdings  which were slowly becoming towns. There were perhaps a few hardy pioneer  farmers on the southern fringes of the district, but the principle  reason traders came to this region was to get amber and furs. The Beaker  people dealt in both.    Now as the three sheltered under the wide branches of a towering pine  Ashe fumbled with a pack and brought out the \"beaker\" which was the  identifying mark of his adopted people. He measured into it a portion of  the sour, stimulating drink which the traders introduced wherever they  went. The cup passed from hand to hand, its taste unpleasant on the  tongue, but comfortingly warm to one's middle.    They took turns keeping the watch until the gray of false dawn became  the clearer light of morning. After breakfasting on flat cakes of meal,  they packed the donkeys, using the same knots and cross lashing which  were the mark of real Beaker traders. Their bows protected from dampness  under their cloaks, they set out to find the river and their path  southward.    Ashe led, Ross towed the donkeys, and McNeil brought up the rear. In the  absence of a path they had to set a ragged course, keeping to the edge  of the clearing until they saw the end of the lake.    \"Woodsmoke,\" Ashe commented when they had completed two thirds of their  journey. Ross sniffed and was able to smell it too. Nodding to Ashe,  McNeil oozed into nothingness between the trees with an ease Murdock  envied. As they waited for him to return, Ross became conscious of  another life about them, one busy with its own concerns, which were in  no way those of human beings, except that food and perhaps shelter were  to be reckoned among them.    In Britain, Ross had known there were others of his kind about, but this  was different. Here, he could have believed it if he had been told he  was the first man to walk this way.    A squirrel ran out on a tree limb and surveyed the two men with curious  beady eyes, then clung head down on the tree trunk to see them better.  One of the donkeys tossed its head, and the squirrel was gone with a  flirt of its tail. Although it was quiet, there was a hum underneath the  surface which Ross tried to analyze, to identify the many small sounds  which went into its making.    Perhaps because he was trying so hard, he noted the faint noise."]]]
