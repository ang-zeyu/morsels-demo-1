It has in painting all the properties of white  lead, from which it may be prepared by gentle calcination in an open  furnace. In tint with that pigment, however, it soon loses its colour  and returns to white, probably extracting some carbonic acid therefrom.  If used in an unmixed state, it is permanent in oil under the same  conditions as white lead, but should not be employed in water, on  account of its changing even to blackness by the action of damp or  impure air. It is an admirable dryer, and has much the same effect as  litharge in rendering oils siccative.    _Litharge_ is merely fused massicot. Old writers speak of litharge of  silver and litharge of gold, oxides of lead, pale and reddish yellow  respectively. Commercial litharge, especially that which is foreign,  contains sometimes a considerable proportion of oxide of copper and  iron. The principal impurity, however, is generally silica, left  undissolved on treating the litharge with nitric or acetic acid.  Litharge is commonly used in preparing drying oils, which contain a  greater or less amount of the oxide in the form of oleate of lead. Oils  made siccative by means of litharge are therefore liable to be damaged  by foul gas. It is a matter of congratulation that such injury is not  lasting, and that the oil, like white lead, recovers its original colour  on exposure to air and light. Some drying oil which we exposed on a tile  to an atmosphere of sulphuretted hydrogen until it was completely  blackened, regained its former yellow hue on being submitted for a day  or so to air and light. Hence, although the employment of lead as a  siccative is not desirable, its effects are not so deleterious as might  be imagined.    61. _Patent Yellow_,    _Turner's Yellow_, _Montpellier Yellow_, _Mineral Yellow_, _Cassel  Yellow_, &c., is a mixture of chloride and oxide of lead, obtainable  either as a pale or a deep yellow. It is a hard, ponderous, sparkling  substance, of a crystalline texture and bright colour; hardly inferior,  when ground, to chrome yellow. Of an excellent body, and working well in  oil and water, but soon injured both by the sun's light and impure air.  A variety, mentioned by Mérimée, in which bismuth and antimony are also  used, is of greater durability.    62. _Platinum Yellow._    Our own opinion of this costly preparation is that the good qualities of  the product do not justify its price. It may be obtained as a bright,  rich, deep yellow, of considerable transparency; but the colour is acted  upon by foul gas and exposure. Even in a book we have found it assume a  dirty greyish cast, and a specimen which had been kept in a drawer,  wrapped up in paper, became perfectly black in a few years. The presence  of palladium interferes with the beauty of the original tint, but does  not affect its stability.    63. _Thallium Yellow._    The new metal thallium yields in combination with chromic acid two  yellow colours, a pale and an orange. They are not absolutely insoluble  in water, and the sulphide of thallium being brown, would probably be  damaged by impure air. But whatever their properties as pigments may be,  their habitudes as such are not yet known. The present scarcity of the  metal renders the colours produced from it mere scientific curiosities.    64. _Thwaites' Yellow._    Under this name chromate of cadmium was introduced some few years back.  If well prepared, it is a fine soft powder of a very vivid light yellow  colour. The compound is too soluble, however, to be of value, its  washings even with cold water being continually tinged yellow. Hence it  turns green after a time, and becomes otherwise discoloured. Like  citron yellow and other chromates apt to assume a green cast, it should  only be employed, if at all, when compounded for foliage tints, &c. This  want of durability is to be regretted, for a good sample of cadmium  chrome is marked by exceeding beauty, unsurpassed for clearness and  purity by any other yellow.    65. _Turbith Mineral_,    Or _Queen's Yellow_, is a subsulphate of mercury, of a beautiful lemon  yellow colour, but so liable to change by the action of light or impure  air, that it cannot be used safely, and hardly deserves attention as a  pigment.    66. _Uranium Yellow_    Can be produced of a pale or orange tint, differing in brightness and  depth of colour according to the mode of preparation. It is fairly  eligible as a pigment, and far superior to the many fugitive compounds  which have from time to time appeared. Being very expensive, however,  and not possessing the good qualities of its compeers lately introduced,  uranium yellow has but little chance of being employed now.    67. _Yellow Carmine_    Is a rich transparent colour, somewhat resembling an ochre compounded  with Indian yellow. On exposure to light, it behaves much as a mixture  of those pigments would do, the rich _yellowness_ entirely disappearing,  and the sober-coloured earth being left behind.           *       *       *       *       *    From several metals besides those mentioned, yellows more or less vivid  and durable may be obtained--from tin, nickel, cerium, molybdenum, &c.;  but we do not know that any one of them would be a really desirable  addition. To justify its being brought out, a new pigment should own  some special advantage, chemical or artistic, by which it may be  distinguished from other colours. No purpose would be answered by  crowding the palette with mere repetitions, even though they were  stable. If, for instance, indium yellow were found exactly similar to  that of cadmium, in colour, opacity, permanence, its presence would be  quite superfluous. The mistake is often made of offering a fresh  compound for a pigment when something as good or better, and cheaper may  be, already exists. We remember a patient experimenter, who had produced  a pink from cobalt, wondering why his colour should be so generally  declined. The product was not wanting in either beauty or stability, but  he forgot that the lakes of madder were far more beautiful, at least as  durable, and much less expensive. We have said that we do not join in  the cry of there being too many pigments, or share the opinion that  there is not room for more, but we do enforce the necessity of progress.  Let us have as many good colours as possible, but let the new be  superior to the old, and all be distinct from each other.    As far as yellows are concerned, the palette possesses both variety and  durability. Opaque or transparent, bright or subdued, deep or pale, it  presents a sufficiency of permanent pigments. Most noteworthy are  aureolin, the deep and 'pale' cadmiums, lemon yellow, Mars yellow, the  modern Naples yellow, the ochres, orient yellow, and raw sienna. Whether  used alone or in tint these are, if genuine, perfectly reliable, and  comprise the list of those durable colours which may be called pigments  of the first class.    Among pigments of the second class, or the semi-stable, gamboge holds  the foremost place, for although not strictly durable in itself, it  conduces to the permanence of other colours. Chrome yellows, citron  yellow, strontian yellow, and Thwaites' yellow, also belong to this  division.    As third class pigments, or the fugitive, must be ranked Mutrie yellow  and other lemon cadmiums, the true gallstone, Indian yellow, the lakes,  orpiment, Gelbin's yellow, massicot, patent yellow, and turbith mineral.    It must not be forgotten, however, that these three classes are subject  to modification. A durable pigment may be so adulterated as to descend  to the second or even the third division, while a semi-stable or  fugitive colour may be replaced by a permanent or comparatively  permanent substitute, as in the case of strontian yellow and gallstone.  It should likewise be remembered that pigments are apt to vary in  stability according to the mode of their preparation; and that, as there  are different degrees of permanence, there are different degrees of  fugacity.          CHAPTER IX.    ON THE PRIMARY, RED.      Red is the second and intermediate of the primary colours, standing  between _yellow_ and _blue_; and is also in like intermediate relation  to _white_ and _black_, or light and shade. Hence red is pre-eminent  among colours, as well as the most positive of all, forming with yellow  the secondary _orange_ and its near relatives, scarlet, &c.; and with  blue, the secondary _purple_ and its allies, crimson, &c. It gives some  degree of warmth to all colours, especially to those which partake of  yellow.    Red is the archeus, or principal colour in the tertiary _russet_; enters  subordinately into the two other tertiaries, _citrine_ and _olive_; goes  largely into the composition of the various hues and shades of the  semi-neutral _marrone_ or chocolate, and its relations, puce, murrey,  morelle, mordore, pompadour, &c.; and is more or less present in  _browns_, _grays_, and all broken colours. It is likewise the second  power in harmonizing and contrasting other colours, as well as in  compounding _black_ and all other neutrals, into which it enters in the  proportion of five,--to blue, eight,--and yellow, three.    Red is a colour of double power in this respect too; that, in union or  connexion with yellow, it becomes hot and _advancing_; but mixed or  combined with blue, cool and _retiring_. It is, however, more congenial  with yellow than with blue, and thence partakes more of the character of  the former in its effects of warmth, the influence of light and  distance, and action on the eye, by which the power of vision is  diminished on viewing this colour in a strong light. On the other hand,  red appears to deepen in colour rapidly in a declining light as night  comes on, or in shade. These qualities of red give it great importance,  render it difficult of management, and require it to be generally kept"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/20916"],[0,"The Arabian Nights: Their Best-known Tales (#16)"],[1,"the  enchantment. The sultan's numerous retinue, who found themselves  encamped in the largest square, were astonished to see themselves in an  instant in the middle of a large, handsome, well-peopled city.    To return to the enchantress: As soon as she had effected this wonderful  change, she returned with all expedition to the Palace of Tears, that  she might receive her reward. \"My dear lord,\" cried she, as she entered,  \"I have done all that you required of me, then pray rise and give me  your hand.\" \"Come near,\" said the sultan, still counterfeiting the  pronunciation of the black. She did so. \"You are not near enough,\" he  continued; \"approach nearer.\" She obeyed. He then rose up, and seizing  her by the arm so suddenly that she had not time to discover him, he  with a blow of his cimeter cut her in two, so that one half fell one way  and the other another. This done, he left the body on the spot, and  going out of the Palace of Tears, went to seek the young king of the  Black Isles, who waited for him with great impatience. When he found  him, \"Prince,\" said he, embracing him, \"rejoice; you have now nothing to  fear; your cruel enemy is dead.\"    The young prince returned thanks to the sultan in a manner that  sufficiently evinced his gratitude, and in return wished him long life  and happiness. \"You may henceforward,\" said the sultan, \"dwell peaceably  in your capital, unless you will accompany me to mine, which is near:  you shall there be welcome, and have as much honour shown you as if you  were in your own kingdom.\" \"Potent monarch, to whom I am so much  indebted,\" replied the king, \"you think, then, that you are near your  capital.\" \"Yes,\" said the sultan, \"I know it is not above four or five  hours' journey.\" \"It will take you a whole year to return,\" said the  prince. \"I do indeed believe that you came hither from your capital in  the time you mention, because mine was enchanted; but since the  enchantment is taken off, things are changed: however, this shall not  prevent my following you, were it to the utmost corners of the earth.  You are my deliverer, and that I may give you proofs of my  acknowledgment of this during my whole life, I am willing to accompany  you, and to leave my kingdom without regret.\"    The sultan was extremely surprised to understand that he was so far from  his dominions, and could not imagine how it could be, but the young king  of the Black Islands convinced him beyond a possibility of doubt. Then  the sultan replied: \"It is no matter; the trouble of returning to my own  country is sufficiently recompensed by the satisfaction of having  obliged you, and by acquiring you for a son; for since you will do me  the honour to accompany me, as I have no child, I look upon you as such,  and from this moment appoint you my heir and successor.\"    The young prince then employed himself in making preparations for his  journey, which were finished in three weeks, to the great regret of his  court and subjects, who agreed to receive at his hands one of his  nearest kindred for their monarch.    At length the sultan and the young prince began their journey, with a  hundred camels laden with inestimable riches from the treasury, followed  by fifty handsome gentlemen on horseback, perfectly well mounted and  dressed. They had a pleasant journey; and when the sultan, who had sent  couriers to give advice of his delay, and of the adventure which had  occasioned it, approached his capital, the principal officers came to  receive him, and to assure him that his long absence had occasioned no  alteration in his empire. The inhabitants also came out in great crowds,  received him with acclamations, and made public rejoicings for several  days.    The day after his arrival the sultan acquainted his courtiers with his  adoption of the king of the Four Black Islands, who was willing to leave  a great kingdom to accompany and live with him; and in reward for their  loyalty, he made each of them presents according to their rank.    As for the fisherman, as he was the first cause of the deliverance of  the young prince, the sultan gave him a plentiful fortune, which made  him and his family happy the rest of his days.          THE STORY OF GULNARE OF THE SEA      There was, in olden time, and in an ancient age and period, in the land  of the Persians, a king named Shahzeman, and the place of his residence  was Khorassan. He had not been blest, during his whole life, with a male  child nor a female; and he reflected upon this, one day, and lamented  that the greater portion of his life had passed, and he had no heir to  take the kingdom after him as he had inherited it from his fathers and  forefathers. So the utmost grief befell him on this account.    Now while he was sitting one day, one of his mamelukes came in to him,  and said to him: \"O my lord, at the door is a slave-girl with a  merchant: none more beautiful than she hath been seen.\" And he replied:  \"Bring to me the merchant and the slave-girl.\" The merchant and the  slave-girl therefore came to him; and when he saw her, he found her to  resemble the lance in straightness and slenderness. She was wrapped in a  garment of silk embroidered with gold, and the merchant uncovered her  face, whereupon the place was illuminated by her beauty, and there hung  down from her forehead seven locks of hair reaching to her anklets. The  King, therefore, wondered at the sight of her, and at her beauty, and  her stature and justness of form; and he said to the merchant: \"O  sheikh, for how much is this damsel to be sold?\" The merchant answered:  \"O my lord, I purchased her for two thousand pieces of gold of the  merchant who owned her before me, and I have been for three years  travelling with her, and she hath cost, to the period of her arrival at  this place, three thousand pieces of gold; and she is a present from me  unto thee.\" Upon this, the king conferred upon him a magnificent robe of  honour, and gave orders to present him with ten thousand pieces of gold.  So he took them, and kissed the hands of the king, thanking him for his  beneficence, and departed. Then the king committed the damsel to the  tirewomen, saying to them: \"Amend the state of this damsel, and deck  her, and furnish for her a private chamber, and take her into it.\" He  also gave orders to his chamberlains that everything which she required  should be conveyed to her. The seat of government where he resided was  on the shore of the sea, and his city was called the White City. And  they conducted the damsel into a private chamber, which chamber had  windows overlooking the sea; and the king commanded his chamberlains to  close all the doors upon her after taking to her all that she required.    The king then went in to visit the damsel; but she rose not to him, nor  took any notice of him. So the king said: \"It seemeth that she hath been  with people who have not taught her good manners.\" And looking at the  damsel, he saw her to be a person surpassing in loveliness, her face was  like the disk of the moon at the full, or the shining sun in the clear  sky; and he wondered at her beauty, extolling the perfection of God, the  Creator: then the king advanced to the damsel, and seated himself by her  side, pressed her to his bosom, and kissed her lips, which he found to  be sweeter than honey. After this, he gave orders to bring tables of the  richest viands, comprising dishes of every kind; and he ate, and put  morsels into her mouth until she was satisfied; but she spoke not a  single word. The king talked to her, and inquired of her her name; but  she was silent, not uttering a word, nor returning him an answer,  ceasing not to hang down her head toward the ground; and what protected  her from the anger of the king was her beauty, and her tenderness of  manner. So the king said within himself: \"Extolled be the perfection of  God, the Creator of this damsel! How elegant is she, saving that she  doth not speak!\"--Then the king asked the female slaves whether she had  spoken; and they answered him: \"From the time of her arrival to the  present moment she hath not spoken one word, and we have not heard her  talk.\" The king therefore caused some of them to come, and sing to her,  and make merry with her, thinking that then she might perhaps speak.  Accordingly the female slaves played before her with all kinds of  musical instruments, and enacted sports and other performances, and they  sang so that every one who was present was moved with delight, except  the damsel, who looked at them and was silent, neither laughing nor  speaking. So the heart of the king was contracted. He however inclined  to her entirely, paying no regard to others, but relinquishing all the  rest of his favourites.    He remained with her a whole year, which seemed as one day, and still  she spoke not; and he said to her one day, when his passion was  excessive: \"O desire of souls, verily the love that I have for thee is  great, and I have relinquished for thy sake all my worldly portion, and  been patient with thee a whole year. I beg God that He will, in His  grace, soften thy heart toward me, and that thou mayest speak to me. Or,  if thou be dumb, inform me by a sign, that I may give up hope of thy  speaking. I also beg of God that He will bless thee with a son that may  inherit my kingdom after me; for I am solitary, having none to be my  heir, and my age hath become great. I conjure thee, then, by Allah, if  thou love me, that thou return me a reply.\" And upon this, the damsel  hung her head toward the ground, meditating. Then she raised her head,  and smiled in the face of the king, whereat it appeared to the king that  lightning filled the private chamber; and she said: \"O magnanimous King,  God hath answered thy prayer; for I am about to bring thee a child, and  the time is almost come. And were it not that I knew this thing, I had  not spoken to thee one word.\" And when the king heard what she"]]]
