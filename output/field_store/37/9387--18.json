Such a conflate use  of Anu-Enlil would present a striking parallel to the Hebrew combination  Yahweh-Elohim, though of course in the case of the former pair the  subsequent stage of identification was never attained. But the evidence  furnished by the text is not conclusive, and it is preferable here and  elsewhere in the narrative to regard either Anu or Enlil as speaking and  acting both on his own behalf and as the other's representative.         (1) Op. cit., p. 21 f.; and cf. Jastrow, _Hebrew and       Babylonian Traditions_, p. 336.         (2) It necessitates the taking of (_dingir_) _Nin-tu-ra_ as       a genitive, not a dative, and the very awkward rendering       \"my, Nintu's, creations\".         (3) Another of the recently published Sumerian mythological       compositions from Nippur includes a number of myths in which       Enki is associated first with Ninella, referred to also as       Nintu, \"the Goddess of Birth\", then with Ninshar, referred       to also as Ninkurra, and finally with Ninkharsagga. This       text exhibits the process by which separate traditions with       regard to goddesses originally distinct were combined       together, with the result that their heroines were       subsequently often identified with one another. There the       myths that have not been subjected to a very severe process       of editing, and in consequence the welding is not so       complete as in the Sumerian Version of the Deluge.         (4) If Enlil's name should prove to be the first word of the       composition, we should naturally regard him as the speaker       here and as the protagonist of the gods throughout the text,       a _role_ he also plays in the Semitic-Babylonian Version.    This reference to the Deluge, which occurs so early in the text,  suggests the probability that the account of the Creation and of the  founding of Antediluvian cities, included in the first two columns, is  to be taken merely as summarizing the events that led up to the Deluge.  And an almost certain proof of this may be seen in the opening words  of the composition, which are preserved in its colophon or title on the  left-hand edge of the tablet. We have already noted that the first two  words are there to be read, either as the prefix \"Incantation\" followed  by the name \"Enlil\", or as the two divine names \"Anu (and) Enlil\". Now  the signs which follow the traces of Enlil's name are quite certain;  they represent \"Ziusudu\", which, as we shall see in the Third Column,  is the name of the Deluge hero in our Sumerian Version. He is thus  mentioned in the opening words of the text, in some relation to one or  both of the two chief gods of the subsequent narrative. But the natural  place for his first introduction into the story is in the Third Column,  where it is related that \"at that time Ziusudu, the king\" did so-and-so.  The prominence given him at the beginning of the text, at nearly a  column's interval before the lines which record the creation of man, is  sufficient proof that the Deluge story is the writer's main interest,  and that preceding episodes are merely introductory to it.    What subject then may we conjecture was treated in the missing lines of  this column, which precede the account of Creation and close with the  speech of the chief creating deity? Now the Deluge narrative practically  ends with the last lines of the tablet that are preserved, and the lower  half of the Sixth Column is entirely wanting. We shall see reason  to believe that the missing end of the tablet was not left blank and  uninscribed, but contained an incantation, the magical efficacy of which  was ensured by the preceding recitation of the Deluge myth. If that were  so, it would be natural enough that the text should open with its main  subject. The cause of the catastrophe and the reason for man's rescue  from it might well be referred to by one of the creating deities in  virtue of the analogy these aspects of the myth would present to the  circumstances for which the incantation was designed. A brief account  of the Creation and of Antediluvian history would then form a natural  transition to the narrative of the Deluge itself. And even if the text  contained no incantation, the narrative may well have been introduced  in the manner suggested, since this explanation in any case fits in with  what is still preserved of the First Column. For after his reference to  the destruction of mankind, the deity proceeds to fix the chief duty  of man, either as a preliminary to his creation, or as a reassertion  of that duty after his rescue from destruction by the Flood. It is  noteworthy that this duty consists in the building of temples to the  gods \"in a clean spot\", that is to say \"in hallowed places\". The passage  may be given in full, including the two opening lines already discussed:         \"As for my human race, from (_or_ in) its destruction will I       cause it to be (. . .), For Nintu my creatures (. . .) will       I (. . .).         The people will I cause to . . . in their settlements,         Cities . . . shall (man) build, in there protection will I       cause him to rest,         That he may lay the brick of our houses in a clean spot,         That in a clean spot he may establish our . . . !\"    In the reason here given for man's creation, or for his rescue from  the Flood, we have an interesting parallel to the Sixth Tablet of  the Semitic-Babylonian Creation Series. At the opening of that tablet  Marduk, in response to \"the word of the gods\", is urged by his heart to  devise a cunning plan which he imparts to Ea, namely the creation of man  from his own divine blood and from bone which he will fashion. And the  reason he gives for his proposal is precisely that which, as we have  seen, prompted the Sumerian deity to create or preserve the human race.  For Marduk continues:         \"I will create man who shall inhabit (. . .),         That the service of the gods may be established and that       their shrines may be built.\"(1)         (1) See _The Seven Tablets of Creation_, Vol. I, pp. 86 ff.    We shall see later, from the remainder of Marduk's speech, that the  Semitic Version has been elaborated at this point in order to reconcile  it with other ingredients in its narrative, which were entirely absent  from the simpler Sumerian tradition. It will suffice here to note that,  in both, the reason given for man's existence is the same, namely, that  the gods themselves may have worshippers.(1) The conception is in full  agreement with early Sumerian thought, and reflects the theocratic  constitution of the earliest Sumerian communities. The idea was  naturally not repugnant to the Semites, and it need not surprise us to  find the very words of the principal Sumerian Creator put into the mouth  of Marduk, the city-god of Babylon.         (1) It may be added that this is also the reason given for       man's creation in the introduction to a text which       celebrates the founding or rebuilding of a temple.    The deity's speech perhaps comes to an end with the declaration of his  purpose in creating mankind or in sanctioning their survival of the  Deluge; and the following three lines appear to relate his establishment  of the divine laws in accordance with which his intention was carried  out. The passage includes a refrain, which is repeated in the Second  Column:         The sublime decrees he made perfect for it.    It may probably be assumed that the refrain is employed in relation to  the same deity in both passages. In the Second Column it precedes  the foundation of the Babylonian kingdom and the building of the  Antediluvian cities. In that passage there can be little doubt that the  subject of the verb is the chief Sumerian deity, and we are therefore  the more inclined to assign to him also the opening speech of the First  Column, rather than to regard it as spoken by the Sumerian goddess whose  share in the creation would justify her in claiming mankind as her  own. In the last four lines of the column we have a brief record of the  Creation itself. It was carried out by the three greatest gods of the  Sumerian pantheon, Anu, Enlil and Enki, with the help of the goddess  Ninkharsagga; the passage reads:         When Anu, Enlil, Enki and Ninkharsagga       Created the blackheaded (i.e. mankind),       The _niggil(ma)_ of the earth they caused the earth to       produce(?),       The animals, the four-legged creatures of the field, they       artfully called into existence.    The interpretation of the third line is obscure, but there is no doubt  that it records the creation of something which is represented as having  taken place between the creation of mankind and that of animals. This  object, which is written as _nig-gil_ or _nig-gil-ma_, is referred to  again in the Sixth Column, where the Sumerian hero of the Deluge assigns  to it the honorific title, \"Preserver of the Seed of Mankind\". It must  therefore have played an important part in man's preservation from the  Flood; and the subsequent bestowal of the title may be paralleled in  the early Semitic Deluge fragment from Nippur, where the boat in which  Ut-napishtim escapes is assigned the very similar title \"Preserver of  Life\".(1) But _niggilma_ is not the word used in the Sumerian Version  of Ziusudu's boat, and I am inclined to suggest a meaning for it in  connexion with the magical element in the text, of the existence of  which there is other evidence. On that assumption, the prominence given  to its creation may be paralleled in the introduction to a later magical  text, which described, probably in connexion with an incantation,  the creation of two small creatures, one white and one black, by  Nin-igi-azag, \"The Lord of Clear Vision\", one of "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/20300"],[0,"Henry VIII.

His failure was the cause of all  that took place, for, as King Henry was deceived in every direction,  he thought fit to take this other course.\"[164] He discovered that he,  too, could play at the game of making peace behind the backs of his  nominal friends; and when once he had made up his mind, he played the  game with vastly more effect than Maximilian or Ferdinand. It was he  who had been really formidable to Louis, and Louis was therefore  prepared to pay him a higher price than to either of the others. In  February Henry had got wind of his allies' practices with France. In  the same month a nuncio started from Rome to mediate peace between  Henry and Louis;[165] but, before his arrival, informal advances had  probably been made through the Duc de Longueville, a prisoner in  England since the Battle of Spurs.[166] In January Louis' wife, Anne  of Brittany, had died. Louis was fifty-two years old, worn out and  decrepit; but at least half a dozen brides were proposed for his hand.  In March it was rumoured in Rome that he would choose Henry's sister  Mary, the rejected of Charles.[167] But Henry waited till May had  passed, and Maximilian had proclaimed to the world his breach of  promise. Negotiations for the alliance and marriage with Louis then  proceeded apace. Treaties for both were signed in August. Tournay  remained in Henry's hands, Louis increased the pensions paid by  France to England since the Treaty of Etaples, and both kings      (p. 075)  bound themselves to render mutual aid against their common  foes.[168]                       [Footnote 163: _L. and P._, i., 4864.]                       [Footnote 164: _Ven. Cal._, ii., 505.]                       [Footnote 165: _Ibid._, ii., 372.]                       [Footnote 166: _Ibid._, ii., 505; _L. and P._, i.,                     5173, 5278.]                       [Footnote 167: _Ven. Cal._, ii., 383.]                       [Footnote 168: _L. and P._, i., 5305; _Ven. Cal._,                     ii., 482, 483.]    Maximilian and Ferdinand were left out in the cold. Louis not only  broke off his negotiations with them, but prepared to regain Milan and  discussed with Henry the revival of his father's schemes for the  conquest of Castile. Henry was to claim part of that kingdom in right  of his wife, the late Queen's daughter; later on a still more shadowy  title by descent was suggested. As early as 5th October, the Venetian  Government wrote to its ambassador in France, \"commending extremely  the most sage proceeding of Louis in exhorting the King of England to  attack Castile\".[169] Towards the end of the year it declared that  Louis had wished to attack Spain, and sought to arrange details in an  interview with Henry; but the English King would not consent, delayed  the interview, and refused the six thousand infantry required for the  purpose.[170] But Henry had certainly urged Louis to reconquer  Navarre,[171] and from the tenor of Louis' reply to Henry, late in  November, it would be inferred that the proposed conquest of Castile  also emanated from the English King or his ministers. Louis professed  not to know the laws of succession in Spain, but he was willing to  join the attack, apart from the merits of the case on which it was  based. Whether the suggestion originated in France or in England,  whether Henry eventually refused it or not, its serious discussion  shows how far Henry had travelled in his resentment at the double  dealing of Ferdinand. Carroz complained that he was treated by     (p. 076)  the English \"like a bull at whom every one throws darts,\"[172] and  that Henry himself behaved in a most offensive manner whenever  Ferdinand's name was mentioned. \"If,\" he added, \"Ferdinand did not put  a bridle on this young colt,\" it would afterwards become impossible to  control him. The young colt was, indeed, already meditating a project,  to attain which he, in later years, took the bit in his teeth and  broke loose from control. He was not only betrayed into casting in  Catherine's teeth her father's ill faith, but threatening her with  divorce.[173]                       [Footnote 169: _Ven. Cal._, ii., 495.]                       [Footnote 170: _Ibid._, ii., 532, 542.]                       [Footnote 171: _Sp. Cal._, ii., 192; _L. and P._,                     i., 5637.]                       [Footnote 172: _Sp. Cal._, ii., 201. A Venetian                     reports that the English were so enraged that they                     would have killed Carroz had it not been for Henry                     (_Ven. Cal._, ii., 248), and Carroz was actually                     placed in confinement.]                       [Footnote 173: _L. and P._, i., 5718; _Ven. Cal._,                     ii., 464.]    Henry had struck back with a vengeance. His blow shivered to fragments  the airy castles which Maximilian and Ferdinand were busy constructing.  Their plans for reviving the empire of Charlemagne, creating a new  kingdom in Italy, inducing Louis to cede Milan and Genoa and assist in  the conquest of Venice, disappeared like empty dreams. The younger  Ferdinand found no provision in Italy; he was compelled to retain his  Austrian inheritance, and thus to impair the power of the future  Charles V.; while the children's grandparents were left sadly  reflecting on means of defence against the Kings of England and  France. The blot on the triumph was Henry's desertion of Sforza,[174]  who, having gratefully acknowledged that to Henry he owed his  restoration of Milan,[175] was now left to the uncovenanted mercies  of Louis. But neither the credit nor discredit is due mainly to    (p. 077)  Henry. He had learnt much, but his powers were not yet developed  enough to make him a match for the craft and guile of his rivals. The  consciousness of the fact made him rely more and more upon Wolsey, who  could easily beat both Maximilian and Ferdinand at their own game. He  was not more deceitful than they, but in grasp of detail, in boldness  and assiduity, he was vastly superior. While Ferdinand hawked, and  Maximilian hunted the chamois, Wolsey worked often for twelve hours  together at the cares of the State. Possibly, too, his clerical  profession and the cardinalate which he was soon to hold gave him an  advantage which they did not possess; for, whenever he wanted to obtain  credence for a more than usually monstrous perversion of truth, he  swore \"as became a cardinal and on the honour of the cardinalate\".[176]  His services were richly rewarded; besides livings, prebends,  deaneries and the Chancellorship of Cambridge University, he received  the Bishoprics of Lincoln and of Tournay, the Archbishopric of York,  and finally, in 1515, Cardinalate. This dignity he had already, in May  of the previous year, sent Polydore Vergil to claim from the Pope;  Vergil's mission was unknown to Henry, to whom the grant of the  Cardinal's hat was to be represented as Leo's own idea.[177]                       [Footnote 174: _L. and P._, i., 5319.]                       [Footnote 175: _Ibid._, i., 4499, 4921.]                       [Footnote 176: _Cf._ _Ven. Cal._, ii., 695; _L. and                     P._, ii., 1380.

This                     perhaps is no great crime in a diplomatist.]                       [Footnote 177: _L. and P._, i., 5110, 5121. Henry's                     request that Leo should make Wolsey a Cardinal was                     not made till 12th Aug., 1514 (_L. and P._, i.,                     5318), at least six months after Wolsey had                     instructed Pace to negotiate for that honour.]          CHAPTER IV.                                                        (p. 078)    THE THREE RIVALS.      The edifice which Wolsey had so laboriously built up was, however,  based on no surer foundation than the feeble life of a sickly monarch  already tottering to his grave. In the midst of his preparations for  the conquest of Milan and his negotiations for an attack upon Spain,  Louis XII. died on 1st January, 1515; and the stone which Wolsey had  barely rolled up the hill came down with a rush. The bourgeois Louis  was succeeded by the brilliant, ambitious and warlike Francis I., a  monarch who concealed under the mask of chivalry and the culture of  arts and letters a libertinism beside which the peccadilloes of Henry  or Charles seem virtue itself; whose person was tall and whose  features were described as handsome; but of whom an observer wrote  with unwonted candour that he \"looked like the Devil\".[178] The first  result of the change was an episode of genuine romance. The old King's  widow, \"la reine blanche,\" was one of the most fascinating women of  the Tudor epoch. \"I think,\" said a Fleming, \"never man saw a more  beautiful creature, nor one having so much grace and sweetness.\"[179]  \"He had never seen so beautiful a lady,\" repeated Maximilian's  ambassador, \"her deportment is exquisite, both in conversation     (p. 079)  and in dancing, and she is very lovely.\"[180] \"She is very beautiful,\"  echoed the staid old Venetian, Pasqualigo, \"and has not her match in  England; she is tall, fair, of a light complexion with a colour, and  most affable and graceful\"; he was warranted, he said, in describing  her as \"a nymph from heaven\".[181] A more critical observer of  feminine beauty thought her eyes and eyebrows too light,[182] but, as  an Italian, he may have been biassed in favour of brunettes, and even  he wound up by calling Mary \"a Paradise\". She was eighteen at the  time; her marriage with a dotard like Louis had shocked public  opinion;[183] and if, as was hinted, the gaieties in which his  youthful bride involved him, hastened the French King's end, there was  some poetic justice in the retribution. She had, as she reminded Henry "]]]
