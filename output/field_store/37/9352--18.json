Although allied to  Mr. Hodgson's _R. tragatus_, possesses distinct characters.--_Horsfield_.    SIZE.--As given by Horsfield above.    This bat was first sent from Darjeeling by Mr. J. T. Pearson, and  was named after him. It has also, according to Jerdon, been found  by Captain Hutton at Mussoorie; it is therefore reasonable to suppose  that it inhabits the whole range of the lower Himalayas. One striking  difference between it and the last species is the very short tail,  and it is easily to be recognised by the great length of the fur.      NO. 43. RHINOLOPHUS AFFINIS.  _The Allied Leaf-Bat_ (_Jerdon's No. 21_).    HABITAT.--Ceylon, Burmah, and perhaps the Malabar coast.    DESCRIPTION.--Above bright red ferruginous brown; tips of hair  darker, paler beneath; ears pointed and external; edge deeply  emarginated; internal edge and basal third of external surface  hairy; anti-helix well developed; nasal process apparently very  similar to that of _R. mitratus_ (_Kellaart_). Upper leaf triangular,  emarginate at the tip, reaching above the base of the ears  (_Jerdon_).    SIZE.--Head and body about 2-3/10 inches; tail, 1 inch; wing extent,  12 inches.    This bat seems to vary much in colour. Kellaart says some are of a  brighter red than others, and a few had a yellower tinge. Another  marked variety was of a uniform pale yellow brown.      NO. 44. RHINOLOPHUS ROUXI.  _The Rufous Leaf-Bat_ (_Jerdon's No. 22_).    HABITAT.--India generally.    DESCRIPTION.--Ears large, pointed, externally notched; tragus  broad; tips of upper nose-leaf triangular, with its sides well  emarginate, reaching above the base of the ears; no upper incisors  [as in _Megaderma lyra_]; lower molars only five; canines very large;  fur short, crisp; colour above smoky brown in some, reddish brown  in others, and golden rufous in some; beneath paler.--_Jerdon_.    SIZE.--Length, 2-3/8 inches; tail, 1-1/8; wing expanse, 13 inches.    Hodgson considers this bat as allied to the two following species.  It is the _R. lepidus_ of Blyth.      NO. 45. RHINOLOPHUS MACROTIS.  _The Large-eared Leaf-Bat_ (_Jerdon's No. 23_).    HABITAT.--Lower Himalayas.    DESCRIPTION.--Ears very large, broad, oval, with pointed recurved  tip, and a large obtuse tragus; anterior central crest of nose-leaf  produced in front over the top of the flat transverse front edge;  hinder leaf lanceolate triangular; above sooty brown or light earthy  olive-brown, paler below, some with a rufous or Isabelline tint; no  pubic teats.--_Jerdon_.    SIZE.--Head and body, 1-3/4 inch; tail, 3/4; wing expanse, 9-3/4.      NO. 46. RHINOLOPHUS SUB-BADIUS.  _The Bay Leaf-Bat_ (_Jerdon's No. 24_).    HABITAT.--Nepaul.    DESCRIPTION.--Ears not larger than the head, obtusely pointed and  ovoid; nasal appendage quadrate, with a transverse bar nearly  surmounting it; upper leaf triangular, with slightly emarginate  sides; clear brown above, paler below and on head and face.    SIZE.--Head and body, 1-1/2 inch; tail, 1-1/4; wing expanse,  7-1/2.--_Jerdon_.      NO. 47. RHINOLOPHUS RAMMANIKA (_Kellaart_).    HABITAT.--Ceylon.    DESCRIPTION.--Above rufescent, beneath ashy brown; face slightly  fulvous; round the base of the ears and on the sides of the posterior  half of the body bright fulvous; tail enclosed in the interfemoral  membrane.    SIZE.--Head and body, 2-1/2 inches; tail, 1; wing expanse, 10 inches.    This is a doubtful species. Dr. Kellaart got one from Amanapoora hill  at Kaduganava. He says: \"As the specimen reached us in a dried  condition, we are unable to say anything more about its nasal  processes than that in place of a transverse process above the  nostrils it had a small triangular peak over the usual horse-shoe  process surrounding the nasal opening. This triangular crest was  hairy; superiorly there was no appearance of a sac above it to the  best of our recollection.\"      NO. 48. RHINOLOPHUS ANDAMANENSIS.    HABITAT.--Southern Andaman Island.    DESCRIPTION (_apud_ Dobson).--Like _R. affinis_ generally, but the  anterior horizontal horse-shoe shaped membrane is very broad,  completely concealing the muzzle when viewed from above, as in _R.  Pearsonii_; the posterior terminal leaf is also much longer,  produced backwards between the ears, and not concave on the sides  as in _R. affinis_. The thumb is also much longer. Fur bright reddish  brown above and beneath.      NO. 49. RHINOLOPHUS MINOR.    HABITAT.--Burmah, Yunan.    DESCRIPTION.--Light brown above, greyish brown beneath; ears  slightly shorter than the head, sub-acutely pointed; anti-tragus  large, separated by a deep angular notch; lower lip with three  vertical grooves.    SIZE.--Length of head and body from 1 to 1-3/4 inch.      NO. 50. RHINOLOPHUS COELOPHYLLUS.    HABITAT.--Burmah.    DESCRIPTION.--Fur brown, with whitish roots, light brownish white  below; ears large, with pointed tips projecting outwards;  \"anti-tragus large, separated by an angular emargination from the  outer margin of the ear; horse-shoe large; horizontal margins of  central nose-leaf triangular, small; erect portion rather short,  with parallel sides and rounded summit, meeting the connected  vertical process at the same level\" (_Dobson_). For a more detailed  description see Dobson's Monograph, page 53. Three vertical grooves  on lower lip.    SIZE.--Length of head and body about 2 inches.      NO. 51. RHINOLOPHUS GAROENSIS.    HABITAT.--Garo Hills, Assam; Himalayas (Mussoorie).    DESCRIPTION (_apud_ Dobson).--Ears acutely pointed, with a large  anti-tragus, as in _R. affinis_; anterior vertical process of the  sella maintaining the same breadth upwards and rounded off above,  considerably exceeded in height by the upper edge of the connecting  process, which develops a long acutely pointed projection; terminal  portion of the posterior leaf broad with straight sides, forming an  almost equilateral triangle.    Wing membrane from the ankles, inter femoral membrane square behind;  extreme tip of the tail free.    SIZE.--Length of head and body about 1.5 inch.    This bat is figured (head only) in Dobson's Monograph, page 48.      NO. 52. RHINOLOPHUS PETERSII.    HABITAT.--India. Precise locality unknown.    DESCRIPTION.--Ears acutely pointed, with an emargination  immediately beneath the tip; anti-tragus large, separated from the  outer margin by a deep angular incision; nose-leaf horizontal,  horse-shoe-shaped, not so broad as the muzzle; vertical part of the  sella almost same breadth upwards, and rounded off above, exceeded  considerably in height by the upper margin of the posterior  connecting process; lower lip with three vertical grooves; fur dark  brown above, greyish brown beneath.    SIZE.--Length of head and body, 2.5 inches; tail, 1 inch.    There are two good woodcuts of the head of this bat in Dobson's  Monograph.      NO. 53. RHINOLOPHUS TRIFOLIATUS.    HABITAT.--East coast of India.    DESCRIPTION.--Very much like _R. perniger_ (_luctus_), but is  distinguished by its smaller size and by the more pointed vertical  process of the central nose-leaf, which in the other is truncated.    SIZE.--Length of head and body, 2 inches; tail about 1 inch.      _GENUS HIPPOSIDEROS_ (_GRAY_) VEL _PHYLLORHINA_ (_BONAPARTE_).    Nasal-leaf broad, depressed, transverse; ears with transverse  wrinkles; a circular sac behind the nasal crest, which can be turned  inside out; when alarmed the animal blows it out, and then withdraws  it at each breath; it contains a waxy matter of green or yellow colour.  Blyth thinks that this sac is affected by the amorous season, as in  the case of the infra-orbital cavities of various ruminants and  analogous glandular follicles in other animals.    This genus is also distinguishable from the last by the form of the  ear conch, the small size of the anti-tragus, and, as Dr. Dobson  particularly points out, by the presence of _two_ joints only in all  the toes, as also by the number and character of the teeth, which  are as follows:--    Inc., 2/4; can., 1--1/1--1; premolars, 2--2/2--2; molars, 3--3/3--3.      NO. 54. HIPPOSIDEROS ARMIGER.  _The Large Horse-shoe Bat_ (_Jerdon's No. 25_).    HABITAT.--Lower Himalaya ranges; Ceylon.    DESCRIPTION.--Nasal-leaf large and square; lips with a triple fold  of skin on each side; tragus vaguely developed and wavily emarginate;  of a uniform light-brown colour, with maroon tips to the hairs of  the upper parts; membranes black.    SIZE.--Head and body, 4-1/2 inches; tail, 2-1/2; wing expanse, 22.    Jerdon makes this out to be the same as Kellaart's _H. lankadiva_  and the Malayan _H. nobilis_, but those are synonymous with  _Phyllorhina diadema_. Kellaart supposed it to be identical with _H.  insignis_, which will be found further on as _Phyllorhina larvata_,  all those bats closely resembling each other in a general way. I think  this No. 25 of Jerdon is the same as Peter's _Phyllorhina armigera_.  Hutton found it at Darjeeling, and writes of it as follows:--    \"When captured alive the large ears are kept in a constant state of  rapid tremulous motion, and the animal emits a low purring sound,  which becomes a sharp scream when alarmed or irritated. When  suspended at rest the tail and inter-femoral membrane are turned up,  not in front, like the _Rhinolophi_, but behind, over the lower part  of the back; neither does it appear to envelope itself in its wings  so completely as does _R. luctus._\" He then goes on to say he has  noticed the tremor of the ears and facial crests in all the  _Rhinolophi_ when disturbed, and concludes with a graphic  description of this species, sallying forth in the evening to prey  upon the noisy _Cicadas_; leisurely wheeling with noiseless,  cautious flight round some wide-spreading oak, \"scanning each branch  as he slowly passes by--now rising to a higher circle, and then"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/19552"],[0,"The Plattsburg Manual: A Handbook for Military Training (#16)"],[1," By preparing a position we  mean, you can dig trenches, destroy intervening objects that obstruct  the view of what you should see, construct obstacles that will embarrass  the enemy in his advance, estimate (or determine) distances to important  places. You have opportunities for collecting ammunition, arranging  wires for communication, establishing stations for the wounded. Troops  in motion are easier to see. You are not called upon for as much  physical strain as the attacking troops. You are less fatigued. Your  machine guns are better concealed and the gunners know the ranges better  than those of the attack.    But it is most distressing to a man on the defense to see the enemy,  regardless of everything he can do, advance step by step. He begins to  question within himself the efficacy of his fire, which is to doubt his  own ability. The more he questions and worries, the less effective his  aim becomes. His comrades are dead and wounded about him. Their cries of  distress are heard above the noise and confusion of battle. He becomes  less methodical and deliberate in his actions. His shooting becomes high  and wild. This becomes generally true. The attacking force gains fire  superiority.    Suppose that it is actually your business to construct a defensive  position. Just how will you assign the tasks? What are the important  things to be done at first, and what, if time is pressing, may with  least hardship be omitted? You would first cut down trees, blow up  buildings, destroy crops that prevented you from seeing in any direction  of danger. Next you should provide protection (concealment and cover),  so that there will be as few casualties as possible. Then do what is in  your power to make it most difficult for the enemy to arrive at your  position; i.e., construct some barbwire fences (entanglements) that he  will be unable to cross. Have your expert range finders determine and  make notes of the distances to important points from which the enemy  must advance. Next, dig ditches (trenches) so that your groups (supports  or reserves) may pass from one point to another without danger. Now  take steps to protect your most vital and vulnerable points, your  flanks. Have them so strong, if practicable, that the enemy will leave  them alone. Assign to each group of men a section of the ground to  defend. Having done these important things, then go about those things  that will make you more comfortable in the trenches.          CHAPTER IX    GENERAL PRINCIPLES OF TARGET PRACTICE        The most thrilling experience you will have at a training camp will  probably come when you step up to the firing line on the target range to  fire your first shot. The great majority of new men grow pale, become  nervous, lose their calm and poise, while they are on the firing line.  This is a fact, not a theory. And this loss of nerve is not confined to  the new man. Any shot, however old and experienced, will tell you that  he fully understands what we have just described.    To become a good shot, we must solve a mental condition that corresponds  in a way to that of beginners in golf. And we must master some details  in technique.    We should know something about the machine (rifle) we are to operate. We  must know what the sights are and how to use them. We should know how  those men most successful in the science and art of shooting hold the  rifle under different conditions, how they adjust their slings, how they  prepare (blacken) their sights and care for their rifles, what practice  and preparation they take, and what bits of advice they have to offer.    The primitive man had no means of accurately aiming his crude devices to  throw stones. But in this day and age we have. The modern rifle is one  of the most perfect pieces of scientific machinery in the world. Very  shortly after you arrive in camp your captain will explain to you its  sights and how they are adjusted. lie has a sighting bar for that  purpose. It will take you only a few minutes to grasp the subject when  you have a rifle in your hands, and your instructor is pointing out and  explaining just what you should know. On paper it seems to be hard.    Now you will want to learn how to load your piece (rifle), work your  bolt, and squeeze the trigger. Simple as these points may seem, you will  have something to learn after you have been at it ten years. Practise!  practise! practise! Sit on your bunk and work your bolt ten thousand  times before you go on the range. Get in the habit of doing it quickly.  Learn to keep your piece at your shoulder while you pull the bolt back  and push it home. Learn to make the fewest possible motions of your body  in working it. To pull a bolt back and push it forward seems to be a  simple thing to do. It is simple. But when you are actually firing at  the target, experience tells you that you will have more trouble and a  greater collection of hard luck stories to amuse your friends with than  you ever imagined possible, unless you have had plenty of practice.    To squeeze a trigger seems to be a simple thing to do. It is simple. But  after you have been squeezing triggers for twenty years you will have  something more to learn about it. Ninety-five per cent. of the failures  on the target range in the training camps come from not squeezing the  trigger properly. You can't learn how to squeeze it on paper. You have  got to practise. Every time you work your bolt, squeeze your trigger.  Get in some extra \"squeezes.\" You will find that your whole muscular and  nervous system will need to be coordinated and harmonized. After you  have been long about it you will find an extreme delicacy in its  operation. You will find that it requires a great deal more than a  finger. All the muscles of your hand and arm will be required. We cannot  overemphasize the importance of squeezing your trigger. When you learn  to do this without jumping (flinching), without moving an eyelash, you  are making progress and are prepared for more advanced work.    Why do you suppose we have \"gallery practice,\" i.e., practice with a  greatly reduced charge of powder? Simply to determine and correct your  errors. We assume that you have normal sight and that you are in fair  physical condition. Suppose that you make a perfect score. What  conditions must you fulfil? 1st, You must aim in exactly the same way  every time. 2d, At the instant of firing your body must be in perfect  repose. 3d, You must squeeze your trigger properly (without a jerk).    You could not aim exactly the same way every time unless you understood  your sights and unless you could see them plainly. You will be told to  blacken them. Many forget and fail to do this. They do not fully realize  that the sights are much easier to see when blackened, and that  therefore the chances of hitting the bull's-eye are much greater.  There`s no more luck in shooting than there is in solving a problem in  geometry, or in a game of billiards. It`s all practice, nerve, and  science.    Your body cannot be in repose at the instant you fire unless you have  your sling properly adjusted, unless you are reasonably comfortable (not  constrained), and unless you, temporarily, stop breathing. Your body  must be, for an instant, a vise. Any trivial thing such as a puff of  wind, a jerk of the trigger, or a noise near you, will ordinarily change  your hold and throw you off the bull's-eye.    Suppose you are making a poor score. What is the trouble? In the first  place don't blame it on the rifle or the ammunition. Assume full  responsibility yourself. You are the responsible party. Practise a great  deal and see if you can locate the fault. If you cannot, your captain  will assist you.    When we go from gallery practice to the target range, where we fire the  service rifle with the service charge, we find a great difference in the  recoil of the rifle and in the sound. The good Lord has made our muscles  and nervous system to react automatically at danger or anything  connected with it. That is probably why we shudder and close our eyes  when a door is slammed very near to us. But sound, unless we get too  close, does not hurt any one, and we should steel our nerves to  remember that fact when we are firing. We also know that there is going  to be a certain amount of recoil of the rifle. But if you will hold your  sling as you have been instructed, if you will provide yourself with  proper elbow and shoulder padding, the authors of this text assure you  that you will experience no pain or harm from the recoil. It is their  judgment that if you are healthy and can see and will go on the range  with your jaws set to fire with anything like your gallery practice  coolness, and calmness, you will qualify. Your greatest stumbling block  will be your rapid fire. This is where you fire a definite number of  shots in a limited time. And this is where you will experience the  extreme amount of nervousness.    When you return from firing your first score at rapid fire, and have had  time to think calmly over your actions, you will probably realize that  your nerves were pitched up in G and that you did a number of foolish  things. You should realize that you are not an exceptional man.  Ninety-nine out of every hundred normal, virile men are more or less  nervous when they first step up for rapid fire. Practice and will power  are the correctives.    Let us suppose that you have ten shots to fire in two minutes. If you  fire your ten shots in one minute it is plain that you return unused one  minute given to you. This minute may have been of great use to you in  getting closer to the bull's-eye. If you fire at the rate of ten shots  in three minutes, it is plain that when your two minutes shall have  expired you have missed the opportunity of firing four times at the  bull's-eye.    Get one of your bunkies to go back of your tent and time you. Then swap  about and you hold the watch for him. Try to "]]]
