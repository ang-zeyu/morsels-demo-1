CHAPTER I      It is necessary now to carry the reader forward twenty-one years,  to the beginning of the administration of Valerius Gratus, the fourth  imperial governor of Judea--a period which will be remembered as  rent by political agitations in Jerusalem, if, indeed, it be not  the precise time of the opening of the final quarrel between the  Jew and the Roman.    In the interval Judea had been subjected to changes affecting her  in many ways, but in nothing so much as her political status. Herod  the Great died within one year after the birth of the Child--died  so miserably that the Christian world had reason to believe him  overtaken by the Divine wrath. Like all great rulers who spend  their lives in perfecting the power they create, he dreamed of  transmitting his throne and crown--of being the founder of a  dynasty. With that intent, he left a will dividing his territories  between his three sons, Antipas, Philip, and Archelaus, of whom  the last was appointed to succeed to the title. The testament was  necessarily referred to Augustus, the emperor, who ratified all its  provisions with one exception: he withheld from Archelaus the title  of king until he proved his capacity and loyalty; in lieu thereof,  he created him ethnarch, and as such permitted him to govern nine  years, when, for misconduct and inability to stay the turbulent  elements that grew and strengthened around him, he was sent into  Gaul as an exile.    Caesar was not content with deposing Archelaus; he struck the people  of Jerusalem in a manner that touched their pride, and keenly wounded  the sensibilities of the haughty habitues of the Temple. He reduced  Judea to a Roman province, and annexed it to the prefecture of Syria.  So, instead of a king ruling royally from the palace left by Herod  on Mount Zion, the city fell into the hands of an officer of the  second grade, an appointee called procurator, who communicated with  the court in Rome through the Legate of Syria, residing in Antioch.  To make the hurt more painful, the procurator was not permitted to  establish himself in Jerusalem; Caesarea was his seat of government.  Most humiliating, however, most exasperating, most studied, Samaria,  of all the world the most despised--Samaria was joined to Judea as  a part of the same province! What ineffable misery the bigoted  Separatists or Pharisees endured at finding themselves elbowed  and laughed at in the procurator's presence in Caesarea by the  devotees of Gerizim!    In this rain of sorrows, one consolation, and one only, remained to  the fallen people: the high-priest occupied the Herodian palace in  the market-place, and kept the semblance of a court there. What his  authority really was is a matter of easy estimate. Judgment of life  and death was retained by the procurator. Justice was administered in  the name and according to the decretals of Rome. Yet more significant,  the royal house was jointly occupied by the imperial exciseman, and all  his corps of assistants, registrars, collectors, publicans, informers,  and spies. Still, to the dreamers of liberty to come, there was a  certain satisfaction in the fact that the chief ruler in the palace  was a Jew. His mere presence there day after day kept them reminded  of the covenants and promises of the prophets, and the ages when  Jehovah governed the tribes through the sons of Aaron; it was to  them a certain sign that he had not abandoned them: so their hopes  lived, and served their patience, and helped them wait grimly the  son of Judah who was to rule Israel.    Judea had been a Roman province eighty years and more--ample time  for the Caesars to study the idiosyncrasies of the people--time enough,  at least, to learn that the Jew, with all his pride, could be quietly  governed if his religion were respected. Proceeding upon that policy,  the predecessors of Gratus had carefully abstained from interfering  with any of the sacred observances of their subjects. But he chose  a different course: almost his first official act was to expel  Hannas from the high-priesthood, and give the place to Ishmael,  son of Fabus.    Whether the act was directed by Augustus, or proceeded from  Gratus himself, its impolicy became speedily apparent. The reader  shall be spared a chapter on Jewish politics; a few words upon  the subject, however, are essential to such as may follow the  succeeding narration critically. At this time, leaving origin  out of view, there were in Judea the party of the nobles and  the Separatist or popular party. Upon Herod's death, the two  united against Archelaus; from temple to palace, from Jerusalem to  Rome, they fought him; sometimes with intrigue, sometimes with the  actual weapons of war. More than once the holy cloisters on Moriah  resounded with the cries of fighting-men. Finally, they drove him  into exile. Meantime throughout this struggle the allies had their  diverse objects in view. The nobles hated Joazar, the high-priest;  the Separatists, on the other hand, were his zealous adherents.  When Herod's settlement went down with Archelaus, Joazar shared  the fall. Hannas, the son of Seth, was selected by the nobles to fill  the great office; thereupon the allies divided. The induction of the  Sethian brought them face to face in fierce hostility.    In the course of the struggle with the unfortunate ethnarch,  the nobles had found it expedient to attach themselves to Rome.  Discerning that when the existing settlement was broken up some  form of government must needs follow, they suggested the conversion  of Judea into a province. The fact furnished the Separatists an  additional cause for attack; and, when Samaria was made part of  the province, the nobles sank into a minority, with nothing to  support them but the imperial court and the prestige of their  rank and wealth; yet for fifteen years--down, indeed, to the  coming of Valerius Gratus--they managed to maintain themselves  in both palace and Temple.    Hannas, the idol of his party, had used his power faithfully in  the interest of his imperial patron. A Roman garrison held the  Tower of Antonia; a Roman guard kept the gates of the palace;  a Roman judge dispensed justice civil and criminal; a Roman  system of taxation, mercilessly executed, crushed both city  and country; daily, hourly, and in a thousand ways, the people  were bruised and galled, and taught the difference between a  life of independence and a life of subjection; yet Hannas kept  them in comparative quiet. Rome had no truer friend; and he made  his loss instantly felt. Delivering his vestments to Ishmael,  the new appointee, he walked from the courts of the Temple into  the councils of the Separatists, and became the head of a new  combination, Bethusian and Sethian.    Gratus, the procurator, left thus without a party, saw the fires  which, in the fifteen years, had sunk into sodden smoke begin to  glow with returning life. A month after Ishmael took the office,  the Roman found it necessary to visit him in Jerusalem. When from  the walls, hooting and hissing him, the Jews beheld his guard  enter the north gate of the city and march to the Tower of  Antonia, they understood the real purpose of the visit--a full  cohort of legionaries was added to the former garrison, and the  keys of their yoke could now be tightened with impunity. If the  procurator deemed it important to make an example, alas for the  first offender!          CHAPTER II      With the foregoing explanation in mind, the reader is invited to  look into one of the gardens of the palace on Mount Zion. The time  was noonday in the middle of July, when the heat of summer was at  its highest.    The garden was bounded on every side by buildings, which in  places arose two stories, with verandas shading the doors  and windows of the lower story, while retreating galleries,  guarded by strong balustrades, adorned and protected the upper.  Here and there, moreover, the structures fell into what appeared  low colonnades, permitting the passage of such winds as chanced to  blow, and allowing other parts of the house to be seen, the better to  realize its magnitude and beauty. The arrangement of the ground was  equally pleasant to the eye. There were walks, and patches of grass  and shrubbery, and a few large trees, rare specimens of the palm,  grouped with the carob, apricot, and walnut. In all directions the  grade sloped gently from the centre, where there was a reservoir,  or deep marble basin, broken at intervals by little gates which,  when raised, emptied the water into sluices bordering the walks--a  cunning device for the rescue of the place from the aridity too  prevalent elsewhere in the region.    Not far from the fountain, there was a small pool of clear water  nourishing a clump of cane and oleander, such as grow on the  Jordan and down by the Dead Sea. Between the clump and the pool,  unmindful of the sun shining full upon them in the breathless air,  two boys, one about nineteen, the other seventeen, sat engaged in  earnest conversation.    They were both handsome, and, at first glance, would have been  pronounced brothers. Both had hair and eyes black; their faces  were deeply browned; and, sitting, they seemed of a size proper  for the difference in their ages.    The elder was bareheaded. A loose tunic, dropping to the knees,  was his attire complete, except sandals and a light-blue mantle  spread under him on the seat. The costume left his arms and legs  exposed, and they were brown as the face; nevertheless, a certain  grace of manner, refinement of features, and culture of voice decided  his rank. The tunic, of softest woollen, gray-tinted, at the neck,  sleeves, and edge of the skirt bordered with red, and bound to the  waist by a tasselled silken cord, certified him the Roman he was.  And if in speech he now and then gazed haughtily at his companion  and addressed him as an inferior,"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/215"],[0,"The Call of the Wild (#16)"],[1,"grip. In fact, he seemed as much at home among the trees as on the  ground; and Buck had memories of nights of vigil spent beneath trees  wherein the hairy man roosted, holding on tightly as he slept.    And closely akin to the visions of the hairy man was the call still  sounding in the depths of the forest. It filled him with a great unrest  and strange desires. It caused him to feel a vague, sweet gladness,  and he was aware of wild yearnings and stirrings for he knew not what.  Sometimes he pursued the call into the forest, looking for it as though  it were a tangible thing, barking softly or defiantly, as the mood might  dictate. He would thrust his nose into the cool wood moss, or into the  black soil where long grasses grew, and snort with joy at the fat earth  smells; or he would crouch for hours, as if in concealment, behind  fungus-covered trunks of fallen trees, wide-eyed and wide-eared to all  that moved and sounded about him. It might be, lying thus, that he hoped  to surprise this call he could not understand. But he did not know why  he did these various things. He was impelled to do them, and did not  reason about them at all.    Irresistible impulses seized him. He would be lying in camp, dozing  lazily in the heat of the day, when suddenly his head would lift and his  ears cock up, intent and listening, and he would spring to his feet  and dash away, and on and on, for hours, through the forest aisles and  across the open spaces where the niggerheads bunched. He loved to run  down dry watercourses, and to creep and spy upon the bird life in the  woods. For a day at a time he would lie in the underbrush where he could  watch the partridges drumming and strutting up and down. But especially  he loved to run in the dim twilight of the summer midnights, listening  to the subdued and sleepy murmurs of the forest, reading signs and  sounds as man may read a book, and seeking for the mysterious something  that called--called, waking or sleeping, at all times, for him to come.    One night he sprang from sleep with a start, eager-eyed, nostrils  quivering and scenting, his mane bristling in recurrent waves. From the  forest came the call (or one note of it, for the call was many noted),  distinct and definite as never before,--a long-drawn howl, like, yet  unlike, any noise made by husky dog. And he knew it, in the old familiar  way, as a sound heard before. He sprang through the sleeping camp and in  swift silence dashed through the woods. As he drew closer to the cry  he went more slowly, with caution in every movement, till he came to an  open place among the trees, and looking out saw, erect on haunches, with  nose pointed to the sky, a long, lean, timber wolf.    He had made no noise, yet it ceased from its howling and tried to sense  his presence. Buck stalked into the open, half crouching, body gathered  compactly together, tail straight and stiff, feet falling with unwonted  care. Every movement advertised commingled threatening and overture of  friendliness. It was the menacing truce that marks the meeting of wild  beasts that prey. But the wolf fled at sight of him. He followed, with  wild leapings, in a frenzy to overtake. He ran him into a blind channel,  in the bed of the creek where a timber jam barred the way. The wolf  whirled about, pivoting on his hind legs after the fashion of Joe and  of all cornered husky dogs, snarling and bristling, clipping his teeth  together in a continuous and rapid succession of snaps.    Buck did not attack, but circled him about and hedged him in with  friendly advances. The wolf was suspicious and afraid; for Buck made  three of him in weight, while his head barely reached Buck's shoulder.  Watching his chance, he darted away, and the chase was resumed. Time  and again he was cornered, and the thing repeated, though he was in poor  condition, or Buck could not so easily have overtaken him. He would run  till Buck's head was even with his flank, when he would whirl around at  bay, only to dash away again at the first opportunity.    But in the end Buck's pertinacity was rewarded; for the wolf, finding  that no harm was intended, finally sniffed noses with him. Then they  became friendly, and played about in the nervous, half-coy way with  which fierce beasts belie their fierceness. After some time of this the  wolf started off at an easy lope in a manner that plainly showed he was  going somewhere. He made it clear to Buck that he was to come, and they  ran side by side through the sombre twilight, straight up the creek bed,  into the gorge from which it issued, and across the bleak divide where  it took its rise.    On the opposite slope of the watershed they came down into a level  country where were great stretches of forest and many streams, and  through these great stretches they ran steadily, hour after hour, the  sun rising higher and the day growing warmer. Buck was wildly glad. He  knew he was at last answering the call, running by the side of his wood  brother toward the place from where the call surely came. Old memories  were coming upon him fast, and he was stirring to them as of old he  stirred to the realities of which they were the shadows. He had done  this thing before, somewhere in that other and dimly remembered world,  and he was doing it again, now, running free in the open, the unpacked  earth underfoot, the wide sky overhead.    They stopped by a running stream to drink, and, stopping, Buck  remembered John Thornton. He sat down. The wolf started on toward the  place from where the call surely came, then returned to him, sniffing  noses and making actions as though to encourage him. But Buck turned  about and started slowly on the back track. For the better part of an  hour the wild brother ran by his side, whining softly. Then he sat down,  pointed his nose upward, and howled. It was a mournful howl, and as Buck  held steadily on his way he heard it grow faint and fainter until it was  lost in the distance.    John Thornton was eating dinner when Buck dashed into camp and sprang  upon him in a frenzy of affection, overturning him, scrambling upon him,  licking his face, biting his hand--\"playing the general tom-fool,\" as  John Thornton characterized it, the while he shook Buck back and forth  and cursed him lovingly.    For two days and nights Buck never left camp, never let Thornton out of  his sight. He followed him about at his work, watched him while he ate,  saw him into his blankets at night and out of them in the morning. But  after two days the call in the forest began to sound more imperiously  than ever. Buck's restlessness came back on him, and he was haunted by  recollections of the wild brother, and of the smiling land beyond the  divide and the run side by side through the wide forest stretches. Once  again he took to wandering in the woods, but the wild brother came no  more; and though he listened through long vigils, the mournful howl was  never raised.    He began to sleep out at night, staying away from camp for days at a  time; and once he crossed the divide at the head of the creek and went  down into the land of timber and streams. There he wandered for a week,  seeking vainly for fresh sign of the wild brother, killing his meat as  he travelled and travelling with the long, easy lope that seems never to  tire. He fished for salmon in a broad stream that emptied somewhere into  the sea, and by this stream he killed a large black bear, blinded by  the mosquitoes while likewise fishing, and raging through the forest  helpless and terrible. Even so, it was a hard fight, and it aroused the  last latent remnants of Buck's ferocity. And two days later, when he  returned to his kill and found a dozen wolverenes quarrelling over the  spoil, he scattered them like chaff; and those that fled left two behind  who would quarrel no more.    The blood-longing became stronger than ever before. He was a killer, a  thing that preyed, living on the things that lived, unaided, alone,  by virtue of his own strength and prowess, surviving triumphantly in a  hostile environment where only the strong survived. Because of all this  he became possessed of a great pride in himself, which communicated  itself like a contagion to his physical being. It advertised itself  in all his movements, was apparent in the play of every muscle, spoke  plainly as speech in the way he carried himself, and made his glorious  furry coat if anything more glorious. But for the stray brown on his  muzzle and above his eyes, and for the splash of white hair that ran  midmost down his chest, he might well have been mistaken for a gigantic  wolf, larger than the largest of the breed. From his St. Bernard father  he had inherited size and weight, but it was his shepherd mother who  had given shape to that size and weight. His muzzle was the long wolf  muzzle, save that it was larger than the muzzle of any wolf; and his head,  somewhat broader, was the wolf head on a massive scale.    His cunning was wolf cunning, and wild cunning; his intelligence,  shepherd intelligence and St. Bernard intelligence; and all this, plus  an experience gained in the fiercest of schools, made him as formidable  a creature as any that roamed the wild. A carnivorous  animal living on a straight meat diet, he was in full flower, at the  high tide of his life, overspilling with vigor and virility. When  Thornton passed a caressing hand along his back, a snapping and  crackling followed the hand, each hair discharging its pent magnetism  at the contact. Every part, brain and body, nerve tissue and fibre, was  keyed to the most exquisite pitch; and between all the parts there was a  perfect equilibrium or adjustment. To sights and sounds and events which  required action, he responded with lightning-like rapidity. Quickly as  a husky dog could leap to defend from attack or to attack, he could leap  twice as quickly. He saw the movement, or heard sound, and responded  in less"]]]
