Passing thence into another range of comparatively low hills, they  reached the town of San Ambrosio, where they found comfortable quarters  in a new and commodious inn--at least it seemed commodious, after the  recent experiences of our travellers.    Here Pedro said he would have to spend a day or two, as he had business  to transact in the town, and that he would search out an old  acquaintance with whose family he would place Manuela till their  departure.    While Pedro was gone in quest of his friend, the Indian girl, probably  feeling shy in the midst of such unwonted crowds, retired to the room  provided for her, and Lawrence and Quashy found themselves left in the  unusual condition of having nothing to do.  Of course, in these  circumstances, they resolved to go out and see the town.    While Lawrence was questioning the landlord, an American, as to how he  should proceed, a very decided tremor passed through his frame.  Quashy  seemed to experience a similar sensation, for he said abruptly--    \"Eart'quak'!\"    \"That's nothing new here, sir,\" said the landlord to Lawrence, as he  lighted a cigarette; \"we're used to it, though some of the natives ain't  quite easy in their minds, for the shocks have been both frequent as  well as violent lately.\"    \"Have they done any damage?\" asked Lawrence.    \"Nothin' to speak of.  Only shook down a house or two that was built to  sell, I suppose, not to stand.  You'll find the market-place second turn  to your left.\"    Somewhat impressed by the landlord's free-and-easy manner, as well as by  his apparent contempt for earthquakes, the master and man went out  together.  With characteristic modesty the negro attempted to walk  behind, but Lawrence would by no means permit this.  He insisted on his  walking beside him.    \"Bery good, massa,\" said Quashy, at last giving in, \"if you _will_ walk  'longside ob a nigger, 's'not _my_ fault.  Don't blame _me_.\"    With this protest, solemnly uttered, the faithful negro accompanied our  hero in his inspection of the town.        CHAPTER NINE.    TELLS OF A TREMENDOUS CATASTROPHE.    San Ambrosio was, at the period of which we write, a small and thriving  place--though what may be styled a mushroom town, which owed its  prosperity to recently discovered silver-mines.  All things considered,  it was a town of unusual magnificence on a small scale.    Being built with straight streets, cutting each other at right angles,  Lawrence and his man had no difficulty in finding the principal square,  or market-place, which was crowded with people selling and buying  vegetables, milk, eggs, fruit, etcetera, brought in from the surrounding  districts.  The people presented all the picturesque characteristics of  the land in profusion--peons, with huge Spanish spurs, mounted on gaily  caparisoned mules; Gauchos, on active horses of the Pampas;  market-women, in varied costumes more or less becoming, and dark-eyed  senhoras on balconies and verandas sporting the graceful mantilla and  the indispensable fan.    The carts and donkeys, and dogs and fowls, and boys had the curious  effect of reducing the babel of voices and discordant sounds to  something like a grand harmony.    Besides these, there was a sprinkling of men of free-and-easy swagger,  in long boots, with more or less of villainy in their faces--adventurers  these, attracted by the hope of \"something turning up\" to their  advantage, though afflicted, most of them, with an intense objection to  take the trouble of turning up anything for themselves.  Dangerous  fellows, too, who would not scruple to appropriate the turnings up of  other people when safe opportunity offered.    A clear fountain played in the centre of the square--its cool,  refreshing splash sounding very sweet in the ears of Lawrence, whose  recent sojourn in the cold regions of the higher Andes had rendered him  sensitive to the oppressive heat of the town.  Besides this, a clear  rivulet ran along one side of the square, near to which was the  governor's house.  A line of trees threw a grateful shade over the  footpath here.  On the opposite side stood the barracks, where a few  ill-clad unsoldierly men lounged about with muskets in their hands.  All  the houses and church walls and spires, not only in the square, but in  the town, bore evidence, in the form of cracked walls and twisted  windows and doorways, of the prevalence of earthquakes; and there was a  general appearance of dilapidation and dirt around, which was anything  but agreeable to men who had just come from the free, grand,  sweet-scented scenery of the mountains.    \"They seem to have had some severe shakings here,\" said Lawrence,  pointing with his stick to a crack in the side of one of the houses  which extended from the roof to the ground.    We may remark here that, on entering the town, our travellers had laid  aside their arms as being useless encumbrances, though Lawrence still  carried his oaken cudgel, not as a weapon but a walking-stick.    \"Yes, massa,\" replied Quashy, \"got lots ob eart' quaks in dem diggins.  Ebery day, more or less, dey hab a few.  Jest afore you come down dis  mornin' I hab some conv'sashin' wid de landlord, an' he say he don' like  de look ob t'ings.\"    \"Indeed, Quashy.  Why not?\"    \"'Cause it's gittin' too hot, he say, for de time ob year--sulfry, he  called it.\"    \"Sultry, you mean?\"    \"Well, I's not 'zactly sure what I means, but _he_ said sulfry.  An'  dey've bin shook more dan ornar ob late.  An' dere's a scienskrific  gen'leman in our inn what's bin a-profisyin' as there'll be a grand  bust-up afore long.\"    \"I hope he'll turn out to be a false prophet,\" said Lawrence.  \"What is  his name?\"    \"Dun' know, massa.  Look dar!\" exclaimed Quashy, with a grin, pointing  to a fat priest with a broad-brimmed white hat on a sleek mule, \"he do  look comf'rable.\"    \"More comfortable than the poor beast behind him,\" returned Lawrence,  with a laugh, as he observed three little children cantering along on  one horse.    There was no lack of entertainment and variety in that town, for people  generally seemed to a great extent to have cast off the trammels of  social etiquette, both in habits and costume.  Many of the horses that  passed were made to carry double.  Here would ride past a man with a  woman behind him; there a couple of girls, or two elderly females.  Elsewhere appeared a priest of tremendous length and thinness, with feet  much too near the ground, and further on a boy, so small as to resemble  a monkey, with behind him a woman so old as to suggest the idea he had  taken his great-grandmother out for a ride, or--_vice versa_!    For some hours master and man wandered about enjoying themselves  thoroughly in spite of the heat, commenting freely on all they saw and  heard, until hunger reminded them of the flight of time.  Returning to  their hotel, Lawrence, to his surprise, found a note awaiting him.  It  was from Pedro, saying that he had found his friend in a village about  three miles from San Ambrosio, describing the route to the place, and  asking him to send Quashy out immediately, as he wanted his assistance  that night for a few hours.    \"I wonder what he wants with you?\" said Lawrence.    \"To help him wid de mischif!\" replied the negro, in a half-sulky tone.    \"Well, you'll have to go, but you'd better eat something first.\"    \"No, massa; wid you's leave I'll go off at once.  A hunk ob bread in de  pocket an' lots o' fruit by de way--das 'nuff for dis nigger.\"    \"Off with you, then, and tell Pedro that you left Manuela and me quite  comfortable.\"    \"O Massa Lawrie!--'scuse me usin' de ole name--it _am_ so nice to hear  you speak jolly like dat.  'Minds me ob de ole times!\"    \"Get along with you,\" said Lawrence, with a laugh, as the warm-hearted  black left the hotel.    Thus these two parted.  Little did they imagine what singular  experiences they should encounter before meeting again.    Soon after Quashy's departure Lawrence went to the door of Manuela's  room, and, tapping gently, said--    \"Dinner is ready, Manuela.\"    \"I kom queek,\" replied the girl, with a hearty laugh.    It had by that time become an established little touch of pleasantry  between these two that Lawrence should teach the Indian girl English--at  least to the extent of familiar phrases--while she should do the same  for him with Spanish.  There was one thing that the youth liked much in  this, and it also surprised him a little, namely, that it seemed to draw  the girl out of her Indian reticence and gravity, for she laughed with  childlike delight at the amazing blunders she made in attempting  English.  Indeed, she laughed far more at herself than at him, although  his attempts at Spanish were even more ridiculous.    A few minutes later Manuela entered the room, and, with a modest yet  gracious smile, took a seat opposite her pupil-teacher.    \"Dignity,\" thought the latter--\"native dignity and grace!  Being the  daughter of a great chief of the Incas--a princess, I suppose--she  cannot help it.  An ordinary Indian female, now, would have come into  the room clumsily, looked sheepish, and sat down on the edge of her  chair--perhaps on the floor!\"    But as he gazed at her short, black, curly hair, her splendid black  eyebrows, her pretty little high-bred mouth, beautiful white teeth, and  horribly brown skin, he sighed, and only said--    \"Ay, ay!  Well, well!  _What_ a pity!\"    \"What ees dat?\""]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/21721"],[0,"The Coral Island (#16)"],[1," the hillsides, but also on the seashore, and  even, as has been already stated, on the coral reef itself, where the  soil, if we may use the name, was nothing better than loose sand mingled  with broken shells and coral rock.  So near to the sea, too, did this  useful tree grow, that in many places its roots were washed by the spray  from the breakers.  Yet we found the trees growing thus on the sands to  be quite as luxuriant as those growing in the valleys, and the fruit as  good and refreshing also.  Besides this, I noticed that on the summit of  the high mountain, which we once more ascended at a different point from  our first ascent, were found abundance of shells and broken coral  formations, which, Jack and I agreed, proved either that this island  must have once been under the sea, or that the sea must once have been  above the island: in other words, that as shells and coral could not  possibly climb to the mountain-top, they must have been washed upon it  while the mountain-top was on a level with the sea.  We pondered this  very much; and we put to ourselves the question, \"What raised the island  to its present height above the sea?\"  But to this we could by no means  give to ourselves a satisfactory reply.  Jack thought it might have been  blown up by a volcano; and Peterkin said he thought it must have jumped  up of its own accord!  We also noticed, what had escaped us before, that  the solid rocks of which the island was formed were quite different from  the live coral rocks on the shore, where, the wonderful little insects  were continually working.  They seemed, indeed, to be of the same  material--a substance like limestone; but while the coral rocks were  quite full of minute cells in which the insects lived, the other rocks  inland were hard and solid, without the appearance of cells at all.  Our  thoughts and conversations on this subject were sometimes so profound  that Peterkin said we should certainly get drowned in them at last, even  although we were such good divers!  Nevertheless, we did not allow his  pleasantry on this and similar points to deter us from making our notes  and observations as we went along.    We found several more droves of hogs in the woods, but abstained from  killing any of them, having more than sufficient for our present  necessities.  We saw, also, many of their footprints in this  neighbourhood.  Among these we also observed the footprints of a smaller  animal, which we examined with much care, but could form no certain  opinion as to them.  Peterkin thought they were those of a little dog,  but Jack and I thought differently.  We became very curious on this  matter, the more so that we observed these footprints to lie scattered  about in one locality, as if the animal which had made them was  wandering round about in a very irregular manner and without any object  in view.  Early in the forenoon of our third day we observed these  footprints to be much more numerous than ever, and in one particular  spot they diverged off into the woods in a regular beaten track, which  was, however, so closely beset with bushes that we pushed through it  with difficulty.  We had now become so anxious to find out what animal  this was, and where it went to, that we determined to follow the track  and, if possible, clear up the mystery.  Peterkin said, in a bantering  tone, that he was sure it would be cleared up, as usual, in some  frightfully simple way, and prove to be no mystery at all!    The beaten track seemed much too large to have been formed by the animal  itself, and we concluded that some larger animal had made it, and that  the smaller one made use of it.  But everywhere the creeping plants and  tangled bushes crossed our path, so that we forced our way along with  some difficulty.  Suddenly, as we came upon an open space, we heard a  faint cry, and observed a black animal standing in the track before us.    \"A wild cat!\" cried Jack, fitting an arrow to his bow, and discharging  it so hastily that he missed the animal, and hit the earth about  half-a-foot to one side of it.  To our surprise, the wild cat did not  fly, but walked slowly towards the arrow and snuffed at it.    \"That's the most comical wild cat I ever saw!\" cried Jack.    \"It's a tame wild cat, I think,\" said Peterkin, levelling his spear to  make a charge.    \"Stop!\" cried I, laying my hand on his shoulder.  \"I do believe the poor  beast is blind.  See, it strikes against the branches as it walks along.  It must be a very old one;\" and I hastened towards it.    \"Only think,\" said Peterkin with a suppressed laugh, \"of a superannuated  wild cat!\"    We now found that the poor cat was not only blind, or nearly so, but  extremely deaf, as it did not hear our footsteps until we were quite  close behind it.  Then it sprang round, and, putting up its back and  tail, while the black hair stood all on end, uttered a hoarse mew and a  fuff.    Poor thing said Peterkin, gently extending his hand and endeavouring to  pat the cat's head.  \"Poor pussy! chee, chee, chee! puss, puss, puss!  cheetie pussy!\"    No sooner did the cat hear these sounds than all signs of anger fled,  and advancing eagerly to Peterkin, it allowed itself to be stroked, and  rubbed itself against his legs, purring loudly all the time, and showing  every symptom of the most extreme delight.    \"It's no more a wild cat than I am!\" cried Peterkin, taking it in his  arms; \"it's quite tame.--Poor pussy! cheetie pussy!\"    We now crowded around Peterkin, and were not a little surprised--and, to  say truth, a good deal affected--by the sight of the poor animal's  excessive joy.  It rubbed its head against Peterkin's cheek, licked his  chin, and thrust its head almost violently into his neck, while it  purred more loudly than I ever heard a cat purr before, and appeared to  be so much overpowered by its feelings that it occasionally mewed and  purred almost in the same breath.  Such demonstrations of joy and  affection led us at once to conclude that this poor cat must have known  man before, and we conjectured that it had been left either accidentally  or by design on the island many years ago, and was now evincing its  extreme joy at meeting once more with human beings.  While we were  fondling the cat and talking about it, Jack glanced round the open space  in the midst of which we stood.    \"Hallo!\" exclaimed he; \"this looks something like a clearing.  The axe  has been at work here.  Just look at these tree-stumps.\"    We now turned to examine these, and without doubt we found trees that  had been cut down here and there, also stumps and broken branches--all  of which, however, were completely covered over with moss, and bore  evidence of having been in this condition for some years.  No human  footprints were to be seen either on the track or among the bushes, but  those of the cat were found everywhere.  We now determined to follow up  the track as far as it went, and Peterkin put the cat down; but it  seemed to be so weak, and mewed so very pitifully, that he took it up  again and carried it in his arms, where in a few minutes it fell sound  asleep.    About ten yards farther on, the felled trees became more numerous, and  the track, diverging to the right, followed for a short space the banks  of a stream.  Suddenly we came to a spot where once must have been a  rude bridge, the stones of which were scattered in the stream, and those  on each bank entirely covered over with moss.  In silent surprise and  expectancy we continued to advance, and a few yards farther on, beheld,  under the shelter of some bread-fruit trees, a small hut or cottage.  I  cannot hope to convey to my readers a very correct idea of the feelings  that affected us on witnessing this unexpected sight.  We stood for a  long time in silent wonder, for there was a deep and most melancholy  stillness about the place that quite overpowered us; and when we did at  length speak, it was in subdued whispers, as if we were surrounded by  some awful or supernatural influence.  Even Peterkin's voice, usually so  quick and lively on all occasions, was hushed now; for there was a  dreariness about this silent, lonely, uninhabited cottage--so strange in  its appearance, so far away from the usual dwellings of man, so old,  decayed, and deserted in its aspect that fell upon our spirits like a  thick cloud, and blotted out as with a pall the cheerful sunshine that  had filled us since the commencement of our tour round the island.    The hut or cottage was rude and simple in its construction.  It was not  more than twelve feet long by ten feet broad, and about seven or eight  feet high.  It had one window, or rather a small frame in which a window  might perhaps once have been, but which was now empty.  The door was  exceedingly low, and formed of rough boards, and the roof was covered  with broad cocoa-nut and plantain leaves.  But every part of it was in a  state of the utmost decay.  Moss and green matter grew in spots all over  it.  The woodwork was quite perforated with holes; the roof had nearly  fallen in, and appeared to be prevented from doing so altogether by the  thick matting of creeping plants and the interlaced branches which years  of neglect had allowed to cover it almost entirely; while the thick,  luxuriant branches of the bread-fruit and other trees spread above it,  and flung a deep, sombre shadow over the spot, as if to guard it from  the heat and the light of day.  We conversed long and in whispers about  this strange habitation ere we ventured to approach it; and when at  length we did so, it was, at least on my part, with feelings of awe.    At first Jack endeavoured to peep in at the window; but from the deep  shadow of the trees already mentioned, and the gloom within, he could  not clearly discern objects, so we lifted the latch and pushed open the  door.  We observed that the latch was made of iron, and almost eaten  away with rust.  In the like"]]]
