An extremely  interesting treble viol much in vogue in the eighteenth century was the  viola d'amore, with fourteen strings, the seven of gut and silver being  supplemented by seven sympathetic wire strings running below the  finger-board and tuned in unison with the bowstrings, vibrating  harmoniously while these are played. A remarkably well preserved  specimen of this instrument, made by Eberle of Prague, in 1733, and  superbly carved on pegbox and scroll, is in the fine private violin  collection of Mr. D. H. Carr, of Milwaukee, Wisconsin. It is one of the  few genuine viola d'amores extant. The owner says of it: \"The tone is  simply wonderful, mellow, pure and strong, and of that exquisite harmony  that comes from the throne of Nature. I know of no other genuine viola  d'amore, and it compares with the modern copies I have seen as a Raphael  or a Rubens with some cheap lithograph.\" These modern copies are the  result of recent efforts to revive the use of this fascinating  instrument. A barytone of a kindred nature was the viola di bordone or  drone viol, so called because there was a suggestion of the buzzing of  drone-flies, or humble bees, in the tones of its sympathetic strings,  which often numbered as many as twenty-four. These violas recall the  Hardanger peasant fiddle of Norway, of unknown origin and antiquity,  whose delicate metallic under strings quaver tremulously and  mysteriously when the bow sets in motion the main strings.    At one time every family of distinction in Britain deemed a chest of  viols, consisting for the most part of two trebles, two altos, a  barytone and a bass, as indispensable to the household as the piano is  thought to-day. It was made effective in accompanying the madrigal, that  delightful flower of the Elizabethan age. Singers not always being  available for all of the difficult voice parts viols of the same compass  supplied the lack. It was but a step for masters of music to compose  pieces marked \"to be sung or played,\" thus contributing to the forces  that were lifting instrumental music above mere accompaniment for song  or dance.    When musicians make demands musical instrument makers are ever ready to  meet them, and the viol steadily improved. One who contributed to its  progress was Gasper Duiffoprugcar (1514-1572) a luthier and mosaic  inlayer, known in the Tyrol, in Bologna, Paris and Lyons. The belief  that he originated the violin rests chiefly on the elaborately  ornamented forgeries bearing his name, the work of French imitators from  1800 to 1840. There is an etching, supposed to be a copy of a portrait  of himself carved on one of his viols with this motto: \"I lived in the  wood until I was slain by the relentless axe. In life I was silent, but  in death my melody is exquisite.\"    The words might apply to the perfected violin, whose evolution was going  on all through that period of literary and artistic activity known as  the Renaissance. When or at whose hands it gained its present form is  unknown. The same doubt encircles its first master player. Perhaps the  earliest worthy of mention is one Baltzarini, a Piedmontese, appointed  by Catherine de Medici, in 1577, to lead the music at the French court,  and said to have started the heroic and historical ballet in France.    He is sometimes confounded with Thomas Baltzar, a violinist of Lubec,  who, in 1656 introduced the practice of shifting in London, where he  wholly eclipsed David Mell, a much admired clockmaker fiddler, although  the latter, as a contemporary stoutly averred, \"played sweeter, was a  well-bred gentleman, and was not given to excessive drinking as Baltzar  was.\" His marvelous feat of \"running his fingers to the end of the  finger-board and back again with all alacrity\" caused a learned Oxford  connoisseur of music to look if he had hoofs. Notwithstanding the jovial  tastes of this German, he was appointed leader, by Charles II., of the  famous violins, and had the final honor of a burial in Westminster  Abbey.    Here reposed also in due time his successor in the royal band, John  Banister, who had been sent by the king to France for study, and who was  the first Englishman, unless the amateur Mell be counted, to distinguish  himself as a performer on the violin. He wrote music for Shakespeare's  Tempest, and was the first to attempt, in London, concerts at which the  audience paid for seats. Announcements of the initial performance,  September 30, 1672, read: \"These are to give notice that at Mr.  Banister's house (now called the Musick School) over against the George  Tavern in White Friars, this present Monday will be performed musick by  excellent masters, beginning precisely at four o'clock in the afternoon  and every afternoon for the future at precisely the same hour.\"    Credit for shaping the first violin has been given Gasparo Bertolotti  (1542-1609), called Gasparo da Salo, from his birthplace, a suburb of  Brescia, that pearl of Lombardy so long a bone of contention among  nations. Violins were doubtless made before his time, but none are known  to-day dated earlier than his. A pretty legend tells how this skilful  viol-maker imprisoned in his first violin the golden tones of the  soprano voice of Marietta, the maiden he loved and from whom death  parted him. Her likeness, so the story runs, is preserved in the angel  face, by Benevenuto Cellini, adorning the head. The instrument thus  famed was purchased for 3,000 Neapolitan ducats by Cardinal  Aldobrandini, who presented it to the treasury at Innsprueck. Here it  remained as a curiosity until the French took the city in 1809, when it  was carried to Vienna and sold to a wealthy Bohemian collector, after  whose death it came into the possession of Ole Bull.    Gasparo's pupil, Giovanni Paolo Maggini (1581-1631), improved the  principles of violin-building, and gave the world the modern viola and  violoncello. A rich viola-like quality characterizes the Maggini violin.  De Beriot used one in his concerts, and its plaintive tone was thought  well suited to his style. He refused to part with it for 20,000 francs  when Wieniawski, in 1859, wished to buy it. To-day it would command a  far higher price. It is stated on authority that not more than fifty  instruments of its make now exist, although a large number of French  imitations claim recognition.    While Gasparo was founding the so-called Brescian school, Andrea Amati  (1520-1580), a viol and rebec maker of picturesque Cremona, began to  make violins, doubtless to fill the orders of his patrons. He must have  believed the pinnacle of fame reached when King Charles IX. of France,  in 1566, commissioned him to construct twenty-four violins, twelve large  and twelve small pattern. They were kept in the Chapel Royal,  Versailles, until 1790, when they were seized by the mob in the French  Revolution, and but one of them is known to have escaped destruction.  Heron-Allen, in his work on violin making, gives a picture of it,  obtained through the courtesy of its owner, George Somers, an English  gentleman. Its tone is described as mellow and extremely beautiful, but  lacking in brilliancy.    As the Amati brothers, Antonio and Geronimo (Hieronymous) Amati  continued their father's trade, producing instruments similar to his.  The family reached its flower in Nicolo Amati (1596-1684), son of  Geronimo. He originated the \"Grand Amatis,\" and attained a purer, more  resonant tone than his predecessors, although not always adapted to  modern concert use. One of his violins was the favorite instrument of  the French virtuoso Delphine Jean Alard (1815-1888), long violin  professor at the Paris Conservatoire. It has been described as sounding  like the melodious voice of a child heard beside the rising tide.  Another fine specimen was exhibited by Mr. J. D. Partello, in 1893, at  the World's Fair, in Chicago.    Nicolo Amati's influence was felt in his famous pupils. Foremost among  these was Antonio Stradivarius (1644-1737), whose praises have been sung  by poets, and whose life was one of unwavering service. His first  attempts were mere copies, but after he was equipped with his master's  splendid legacy of tools and wood, his originality asserted itself. His  \"Golden\" period was from 1700 to 1725, but he accomplished good work  until death overtook him. From his bench were sent out some seven  thousand instruments, including tenors and violoncellos. Of these  perhaps two thousand were violins.    A romance encircling this master of Cremona tells that in youth he loved  his master's daughter, but that failing to win her heart and hand, he  gave himself wholly to his work. He married, finally, a wealthy widow  whose means enabled him to pursue his avocation undisturbed by monetary  anxieties. His labors steadily increased the family property until \"as  rich as Stradivarius\" became a common saying in Cremona. Because of his  achievements and his personal worth, he was held in high esteem. Members  of royal families, prelates of the church, men of wealth and culture  throughout Europe, were his personal friends as well as his clients. His  handsome home, with his workshop and the roofshed where he stored his  wood, was, until recently, exhibited to visitors. To-day not a vestige  of it remains. Weary of the importunities of relic-seekers, the  Cremonese have torn it down, and have banished violins and every  reminder of them from the town.    The tone of a Stradivarius, in good condition, is round, full and  exceedingly brilliant, and displays remarkable equality as the player  passes from string to string. Dr. Joseph Joachim, owner of the famous  Buda-Pesth Strad, writes of the maker that he \"seems to have given his  violins a soul that speaks and a heart that beats.\" The Tuscan Strad,  one of a set ordered by Marquis Ariberti for the Prince of Tuscany, in  1690, was sold two hundred years later to Mr. Brandt by a London firm  for L2,000.

The Chamberlain Babhravya and Vasubhuti by some means reach the shore  and are on their way to _Kausambi_.    Vatsa comes forth to behold from the terrace of his palace the frolic  merriment with which his subjects celebrate the festival of _Kamadeva_,  the god of love. Wearied of tales of war, and seeking most his  reputation in his people's hearts, he issues forth attended by his  confidential companion Vasantaka, like the flower-armed deity himself,  descended to take a part in the happiness of his worshippers. The king  observes:--    \"I scarcely can express the content I now enjoy. My kingdom is rid of  every foe; the burden of my government reposes on able shoulders; the  seasons are favourable; and my subjects, prosperous and happy. In  Vasavadatta, the daughter of Pradyota, I have a wife whom I adore, and  in Vasantaka, a friend in whom I can confide. Attended by such a friend,  at such a season, and so disposed I might fancy myself the deity of  desire, and this vernal celebration held in honour of myself. Kausambi  outvies the residence of the god of wealth. Her numerous sons are clad  in cloth of gold, decked with glittering ornaments and tossing their  heads proudly with splendid crests.    Vasantaka says:--    \"Observe the general joy. As if intoxicated with delight, the people  dance along the streets, sporting merrily with each other's persons and  mutually scattering the yellow-tinted fluid. On every side, the music  of the drum and the buzz of frolic crowds fill all the air. The very  atmosphere is of a yellow hue, with clouds of flowery fragrance.\"    At the request of the queen, conveyed through her attendants, the king  proceeds with his friend to join her in offering homage to the image of  the flower-armed deity, which stands at the foot of the red _Asoka_  tree. The queen enters the garden accompanied by Kanchanmala, her  principal attendant, Sagarika and other damsels. Noticing Sagarika, the  queen thinks, \"What carelessness! an object I have hitherto so  cautiously concealed, thus heedlessly exposed! I must remove her hence  before the arrival of the king.\" She says, \"How now, Sagarika, what  makes you here? where is my favourite starling, that I left to your  charge, and whom it seems you have quitted for this ceremony? Return to  your place.\" Sagarika withdraws to a short distance and thinks, \"the  bird is safe with my friend Susangata. I should like to witness the  ceremony. I wonder if _Annaga_ is worshipped here as in my father's  mansion! I will keep myself concealed amongst the shrubs and watch them,  and for my own presentation to the deity I will go, cull a few of these  flowers.\" The king now joins the queen. Kanchanmala delivers the  accustomed gifts of sandal, saffron, and flowers to the queen, who  offers them to the image. The king thus eulogises the beauty of the  queen, \"Whilst thus employed, my love, you resemble a graceful creeper  turning round a coral tree: your robes of the orange dye, your person  fresh from the bath. As rests your hand upon the stem of the _Asoka_,  it seems to put forth a new and lovelier shoot. The unembodied god  to-day will regret his disencumbered essence, and sigh to be material,  that he might enjoy the touch of that soft hand.\"    The worship of the divinity concluded, the queen worships the king.  Sagarika views the scene, mistakes the king for the god and observes,  \"What do I see? Can this be true? Does then the deity, whose effigy only  we adore in the dwelling of my father, here condescend to accept in  person the homage of his votaries? I, too, though thus remote, present  my humble offering.\"    She throws down the flowers and continues:--\"Glory to the flower-armed  god: may thy auspicious sight both now and hereafter prove not to have  been vouchsafed to me in vain!\"    She bows down, then rising looks again, and observes:--    \"The sight, though oft repeated, never wearies. I must tear myself from  this, lest some one should discover me.\" She then withdraws a little,  hears a bard sing a ballad in praise of the king, perceives her mistake  and asks herself, \"Is this Udayana, to whom my father destined me a  bride?\" She becomes enamoured of the king. The king and the queen now  rise to return to the palace.    Sagarika thinks, \"They come! I must fly hence. Ah me, unhappy! no longer  to behold him, whom I could gaze upon for ever.\"    The king addresses his queen thus:--\"Come, love, thou puttest the night  to shame. The beauty of the moon is eclipsed by the loveliness of thy  countenance, and the lotus sinks humbled into shade; the sweet songs of  thy attendant damsels discredit the murmurs of the bees, and mortified  they hasten to hide their disgrace within the flowery blossom.\" The king  and the queen return to the palace.    Sagarika enters a plantain bower with a brush and pallet in order to  paint a picture and soliloquises thus: \"Be still, my foolish heart, nor  idly throb for one so high above thy hopes. Why thus anxious to behold  that form, one only view of which has inspired such painful agitation?  Ungrateful, too, as weak, to fly the breast that has been familiar to  thee through life, and seek another, and as yet but once beheld, asylum.  Alas! Why do I blame thee! the terror of _Ananga's_ shaft has rendered  thee a fugitive;--let me implore his pity. Lord of the flowery bow,  victor of demons and of gods! dost thou not blush to waste thy might  upon a weak defenceless maiden, or art thou truly without form and  sense? Ah me, I fear my death impends, and this the fatal cause.\" She  looks at the picture and goes on, \"No one approaches; I will try and  finish the likeness I am here attempting to portray. My heart beats  high, my hand trembles, yet I must try, and whilst occasion favours me,  attempt to complete these lineaments, as the only means to retain them  in my sight.\" She draws the picture, raising her head beholds her friend  Susangata with a _Sarika_ or talking bird in a cage, and hides the  picture. Susangata sits down, puts her hand upon the picture and asks,  \"who is this you have delineated?\"    Sagarika answers, \"The deity of the festival, _Ananga_.\" Susangata  observes, \"It is cleverly done, but there wants a figure to complete  it. Let me have it, and I will give the god his bride.\" She takes the  paper and draws the likeness of Sagarika. Sagarika expresses anger. Her  friend remarks, \"Do not be offended without cause. I have given your  _Kamadeva_ my _Rati_, that is all. But come, away with disguise, and  confess the truth.\" Seeing that her friend has discovered her secret,  Sagarika is overcome with shame and entreats her to promise that no body  else shall be made acquainted with her weakness. Her friend replies,  \"why should you be ashamed? Attachment to exalted worth becomes your  native excellence. But be assured I will not betray you; it is more  likely this prattling bird will repeat our conversation.\" The friend  brings some leaves and fibres of the lotus, and binds the former with  the latter upon Sagarika's bosom. She exclaims, \"Enough, enough, my  friend, take away these leaves and fibres,--it is vain to offer relief.  I have fixed my heart where I dare not raise my hopes. I am overcome  with shame--I am enslaved by passion--my love is without return--death,  my only refuge.\" She faints and recovers after a short while. A noise  behind proclaims that a monkey has escaped from the stable, and,  rattling the ends of his broken chain of gold, he clatters along. Afraid  of the advent of the monkey, they both rush to hide in the shade of a  _tamala_ grove, leaving the drawing behind. The ape breaks the cage to  get at the curds and rice and lets the _Sarika_ fly.    Vasantaka now notices that the jasmine has been covered with countless  buds, as if smiling disdainfully upon the queen's favourite _Madhavi_.  He is surprised at the most marvellous power of the venerable  Sri-Khanda-Dasa, a great sage come to court from _Sri-Parvata_, by whose  simple will the strange event has happened. He thinks of going to the  king to inform his Majesty when the king appears. He congratulates his  Majesty, on his propitious fortune. The king observes, \"Inconceivable is  the virtue of drugs, and charms, and gems. Lead the way, and let these  eyes this day obtain by the sight the fruit of their formation.\"    Vasantaka advances, stops to listen and turns back in alarm for he  fancies a goblin in yonder _Bakula_ tree. The goblin turns out a  starling. The courtier remarks, \"she says, give the Brahman something to  eat.\" The king observes, \"something to eat is ever the burden of the  glutton's song. Come, say truly, what does she utter. The friend listens  and repeats, \"Who is this you have delineated? Do not be offended  without cause; I have given your _Kamadeva_ my _Rati_. Why should you be  ashamed? Attachment to exalted worth becomes your native excellence.  Take away these lotus leaves and fibres--it is in vain you strive to  offer me relief. I have fixed my heart where I dare not raise my  hopes;--I am overcome with shame and despair, and death is my only  refuge.\" The king interprets thus:--\"Oh, I suppose some female has been  drawing her lover's portrait, and passing it off on her companion as the  picture of the god of love: her friend has found her out; and  ingeniously exposed her evasion, by delineating her in the character of  _Kama-deva's_ bride. The lady that is pictured is very handsome. Some  young female may be supposed to have spoken, indifferent to life,  because uncertain of her affection being returned. The delicate maid  entrusts her companion with the sorrows of her breast: the tattling  parrot or imitative starling repeats her words, and they find an  hospitable welcome in the ears of the fortunate. The companion, laughing  loudly, observes, \"You may as well drop these evasive interpretations;  why not say at once, \"the damsel doubts my returning her "]]]
