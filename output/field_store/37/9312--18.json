[Illustration: FIG. 13.--Plan of Miller's Cave.]    The front chamber of the main cavern is quite regular in form, going  straight back like a vault for 80 feet, then turning abruptly westward  with a width of 47 feet, the west wall making almost a right angle at  the corner. The east wall abuts squarely against the rear; a narrow  crevice leads eastward from their junction, but as this was filled  with water and mud no exploration in it was attempted.    The floor of the front chamber, from wall to wall, and from near the  front to within 27 feet of the rear, was entirely of ashes, no earth  being visible until the extremity of these at either end was reached.  The floor of the western extension is covered with fine earth, washed  in, which gradually increases in volume until it fills the cave to  within a foot of the roof. It was not examined beyond this point.    Measurements show these dimensions:     Width of cave at mouth                                 feet     64   Least width of cave, 24 feet from mouth                 do      45   Greatest width of cave, from doorway to branch in    cave in eastern wall                                  feet     74   Shortest distance from line of least width to line    of greatest width, as given above                     feet     18   From mouth of cave to doorway                           do      51   Height of doorway                                     inches    42   Width of doorway                                        do      33   Length of floor of doorway                              do      56 Sec.   From mouth of cave to top of slope of ashes at rear    feet     84   From top to bottom of slope of ashes at rear            do      16   From foot of ash slope to rear wall                     do      27   Extent of ashes in turn of cave along foot of wall    beyond corner of west wall                            feet     22   Width of these ashes, from foot of wall to the    pool of water                                          do      22   Width of cave from corner of west wall to east wall     do      56   From corner of west wall to rear of cave                do      47   Height of extreme front from floor at edge of bluff    to most projecting ledge above                        feet     35   Height from shelf or ledge near front of east wall    to general level of roof                              feet     14   Height from ashes to roof at middle of cave             do      10      Sec. This measure also represents the thinnest portion of the wall      separating the main cave from the outer cave.    The walls were, as is usual in caverns, somewhat irregular, there  being a narrow bench or shelf along each side near the front, while  projections and indentations alternated from front to rear. There were  numerous small holes and crevices, enlargements of seams and joints by  percolating water at an early stage in the cave's history. These  furnish homes for various wild animals, and nearly all of them contain  bones, sticks, and trash taken in by ground hogs and wood rats which  seem to find much pleasure in carrying such things from place to  place.    The work of excavation began at the extreme front of the cave, where  the original bottom, a mixture of sand, clay, and chert gravel, had  been exposed through removal of the ashes by winds and driving rain.  Almost immediately rocks, large and small, fallen from walls and roof,  were encountered and interfered greatly with the digging. In the upper  foot of the clay were streaks of sand and ashes, among which a mussel  shell and a flint chip were found; and the top of the clay was quite  uneven, appearing as if carried and thrown here, as perhaps some of it  was early in the occupancy of the cave, with the object of making a  more even or level floor farther back. But this admixture was only  superficial; below it, the material had all the appearance of a  running water deposit.    A ledge extended along the east wall for 40 feet, with a width of 12  to 14 feet; at the inner end it was about 4 feet below the general  level of the floor. At 8 feet below its top a second ledge projected  from it, sloping toward the center, slightly for 8 feet then more  rapidly for 10 feet farther, where it merged into the bedrock. Then  came level, nearly smooth rock for 18 feet, to the foot of the slope  of the west wall, 14 feet out from that side of the cave. This was  probably the original drainage channel.    By the gradual erosion of new channels through the limestone and the  consequent abandonment of old ones, subterranean drainage is  continually altering its direction and force. In this way caverns may  be left entirely dry, with bare floors; or may, especially if they  receive the drainage of sink holes, be partially or even entirely  filled with debris thus carried in. Like others, Miller's Cave has  undergone such changes. It was begun by clear water; enlarged by  erosion and by breaking down of walls and roof; presently clay, sand,  and gravel were carried in; finally the water no longer flowed through  the front, but found its way out in some other direction. In time the  deposits became sufficiently dry to afford a good site for camps and  for permanent occupation. There is no way of ascertaining the rate at  which these changes took place; it may have required many centuries to  make an appreciable difference in appearance; or, on the other hand,  the transition from one stage to the next may have been rapid.    Along the foot of the ledge from the east wall the clay was only a few  inches deep; farther out on the ledge, and on the projection extending  from it, were layers of red sand. Occasionally a small patch of it  appeared along the western side. Probably it was washed in among the  last of the natural deposits.    There was considerable chert gravel mixed with the clay, making  excavation as difficult and laborious as digging up an old,  much-traveled macadamized highway.    The surface of the ashes sloped upward rather rapidly for a distance  of 29 feet from the front. Kitchen refuse, found in them from the  start, contained many mussel shells; bones, including those of bear,  deer, panther, turkey, and other large fowls, tortoise, turtle, fish,  and various small mammals and birds; potsherds; broken flints, with  the debris of chipping work; mortars, pestles, hammers, and mullers.  Near the west wall, 14 feet from the mouth, imbedded in the ashes and  a foot below their surface, was a well-preserved cranium, shown in  plate 17, e, f. There were no other bones, not even the lower jaw; it  seems to have been thrown here and covered with the dumped ashes.    At 18 feet from the mouth the rocks became larger and so numerous as  to be almost in contact, projecting above the ashes and imbedded in  the clay down to bedrock; they extended for 22 feet farther in and to  within 14 feet of the west wall. The clay attained its highest level  at the beginning of this pile of rocks, having an elevation of 9 feet  above bedrock; it became lower toward the interior, with its surface  everywhere rough and irregular.    The rocks were too large to be either moved or broken up, and owing to  the condition of the roof an attempt to reduce them by blasting would  have been attended with great danger, so they were perforce left in  place and as much as possible of the clay between and under them dug  away. Beyond those near the front, others, not reaching the top, were  found one after another buried in the clay; owing to their constantly  increasing number, and to the inward slope of the east wall, the  limits of the excavation gradually narrowed, hampering the movements  of the workmen, and it was necessary to handle the earth two or even  three times to get it out of the way. There was growing risk, too, of  the projecting rocks splitting off or breaking out of the clay matrix.  As some of them weighed several tons, the danger became too imminent,  and efforts to continue along the bedrock had to cease.    Two other attempts were made to get to the bottom; one at 40 feet from  the mouth just beyond the large rocks on the surface, and one at 15  feet farther in. The last one started on an area 8 by 15 feet, which  would have been ample if the sides could have been carried down even  approximately straight. Neither of these efforts met with success, for  the same reason that led to the abandonment of the first one.    From here to the end, examinations were confined to the deposit of  ashes. The surface, except as it had been disturbed by relic hunters,  was practically level from wall to wall, but the depth varied with the  undulating top of the clay beneath. Where it was deepest, in the  central portion about 50 to 75 feet from the mouth, the deposit had a  thickness of 6 feet. From this it diminished to about 3 feet on the  sides, with an occasional thinner patch on a narrow shelf formed by a  ledge or a crevice. The average thickness was close to 41/2 feet, so the  amount was not far from 800 cubic yards. This was composed entirely of  ashes from small fires for cooking, heating, and lighting purposes,  increased to a very limited extent by kitchen waste, and by discarded  or mislaid wrought objects. It represented the combustion of many  hundreds, perhaps of thousands, of cords of wood, all of which had to  be carried in from the hilltop or slopes and passed through the  constricted doorway. This labor would be a sufficient guarantee of  economical use; we may be sure that no fuel was wasted. If proof were  needed of such a self-evident proposition, it would be found in the  almost complete absence of charcoal; here and there, but seldom, a  small mass of it showed that a burning chunk, covered up, had  smoldered until the inflammable portion was consumed.

SECTION 3.--TYPES OF OFFENCES.    It is obvious that included under the heading of sexual offences are  cases which vary so greatly in their gravity and in their very nature as  to have little in common. There is a great gulf between the lad  convicted of unlawful carnal knowledge with a girl who is under the  legal age of consent, but who in some instances may even be the actual  instigator of the offence, and the miscreant who tampers with little  girls of tender years, or sets himself deliberately to corrupt boys. It  was this class which the Prisons Board had in mind when it passed the  resolution quoted, and no doubt it is the class which the Committee's  order of reference is intended to cover.    This class of offence is held in so much detestation by normal persons  possessing ordinary healthy natural instincts that they find it  impossible to consider the question from a judicial and coldly  scientific point of view. It is evident, however, that this must be done  if we are to entertain any hope of finding and applying an effective  remedy to this cancer in the social organism. The evidence given before  the Committee leads them to the belief that the evil is much more  prevalent than is generally supposed--that the cases which come before  the Court constitute only a percentage of those which actually occur.    The ignorance of the general public in regard to these matters  occasionally leads to an unjust attitude of mind towards some of the  offenders brought before the Courts. Take the case of an old man charged  with \"exhibitionism.\" To the normal mind this seems a particularly  disgusting proceeding, and the offender's age is regarded as an  aggravation. The explanation is that the higher nerve-cells of the old  man are degenerating, that he may be thus unable effectively to control  his morbid sexual impulses, particularly if stimulated by an enlarged  prostate. Such a person is a subject for pity rather than punishment; he  must be restrained from annoying others by his offensive behaviour, but  it is really a case for medical treatment.    Another class to be considered is the confirmed homosexualist. There are  well-known examples of men eminent in the arts and literature given to  this unnatural practice, and of the offenders who come before the Courts  only a small proportion can be described as feeble-minded. The practice  is not confined to the male sex, although for reasons which will be  apparent it is only males who come before the Courts charged with this  specific offence. Many parents are unaware that girls as well as boys  may contract bad habits and fall into sexual abnormalities, but it is a  fact which they ought to know in order that the danger may be guarded  against.    Mr. Hawkins, Inspector of Prisons, whose experience extending over forty  years in charge of prisoners in New Zealand makes his opinion of great  weight, says there are two types of sexual offenders to be found in our  prisons: First, there are those who yielded to sudden temptation,  assaulted women or young female children, sometimes under circumstances  exhibiting extreme brutality. In the majority of these cases, he says,  the offenders are curable under a proper system of treatment, and it is  seldom that they again offend. He goes on to say: \"The real sexual  pervert, however, who is continually tampering with young children is  different, as is also the case when young boys are the victims. The  worst pervert of all is the one who flagrantly offers himself for the  purposes of sodomy. Strange as it may seem, there are quite a number of  such degenerates in our prisons to-day; middle-aged and elderly men  being the chief offenders of this class. In my opinion segregation for  life is the only course, and my years of experience among such a class  have convinced me of this, their case being absolutely hopeless when  this stage has been reached, and no cure is possible in such cases.\"    This pessimistic view, unfortunately, is fully confirmed by the records  of cases examined by the Committee. Long terms of imprisonment, though  combined with the lash, have proved quite ineffective as a deterrent,  even to the individual concerned. In some cases the offender within a  short time after his release has been detected in the same practices and  rearrested. Still less does such a punishment act as a deterrent to  other addicts, if for no other reason than that each individual  cherishes the conviction that he will not be found out.    Records of a number of illustrative cases are set out in the Appendix,  pages 31-33.      SECTION 4.--SUGGESTED REMEDIES.    As regards the infliction of corporal punishment which is often  advocated, Dr. Murray, Medical Officer to the Mount Eden Prison at  Auckland, who has had a good deal of experience with sexual offenders,  said he had seen a good many flogged, and he did not think it had any  effect as a deterrent. He added, \"Nothing will deter men once they have  taken on that line. I think you will find in some cases where a person  has been addicted to those practices before marriage he will drift again  into the same course after a certain number of years. It seems a  perversion they have no control over, and after a certain number of  years it masters them.\"    The general opinion of those who have been in touch with this problem  for many years is well expressed in the following extract from a very  valuable report furnished to the Committee by Dr. F. S. Hay,  Inspector-General of Mental Hospitals, on the different questions coming  within the scope of the inquiry:--    \"As a member of the Prisons Board I have had the matter of the sexual  offender brought under my notice and have come to some very definite  conclusions.    \"I think that he should be brought to trial in the ordinary way, with  perhaps suppression of publication of names of the offender and victim.  If found guilty, he should be given an indeterminate sentence, and be  removed to a farm reformatory prison, where he would be brought under  skilled medical and lay observation, and his case studied in respect  to--_Mentality_, when if afterwards it is decided that he is mentally  defective or deficient in terms of the Act he can be transferred to the  proper institution; _physical condition_, when if there is any disorder  it can be remedied. If the disorder is causative (_e.g._, prostatic in  the elderly) and surgical or medical interference is necessary, it will  be carried out and its results carefully watched and reported on.    \"At present the sentences vary from, say, a year to ten years or more,  the seriousness of the case being one determining factor; but often  similar cases have years of difference in their sentences, and at the  end of the sentence they once more enter the world, and a fair  proportion repeat the offence. The people in the reformatory prisons  can, with experience of a case lasting over some years, foretell the  failure fairly accurately.    \"The degree of sexual perversion being measured by the amount of  interference with children, which accounts for the measure of the  sentence, means no essential difference in the intent or in the  likelihood of repetition, and therefore scientifically the sentences  should be equal. I suggest that they should be made equal by being made  indeterminate.    \"Those of whom the Medical Officer cannot report favourably would  continue on. They could be given a right of revision. Those of whom he  can report very favourably could be released on probation, and so on.  The essential feature is that no hurried diagnosis is made before trial,  but diagnosis and prognosis are arrived at after months and maybe years  of close observation and by a staff gaining experience daily.\"      _Sterilization and Desexualization._    The increase of sexual offences during recent years and the disgust felt  by all normally disposed people when contemplating cases of sexual  perversion and assault upon young children have created a strong public  opinion in favour of dealing with these offences as radically as  circumstances will permit.    Demands are constantly made that the offenders should undergo \"a  surgical operation,\" which is intended to imply either castration or  simple sterilization.    The British Medical Association, at their annual Conference held in  Auckland in April, 1924, resolved that the following motion be adopted  by the Council: \"That this Conference can make no recommendation for  surgical desexualization in the treatment of the adult sex pervert. The  only safeguard for young children in this matter is the permanent  segregation of the offender, either in prisons or in farm colonies. The  Conference emphasizes the importance of the sterilization of the chronic  mentally or morally unfit that a future generation may benefit thereby.\"    The Committee therefore considers it necessary to set out as clearly as  may be possible the result of such operations and its deductions from  the evidence taken and authorities consulted as to the probability of  the achievement of the result desired.    To consider in the first place the operation of simple sterilization  (vasectomy or salpingectomy). It is quite clear that this operation,  when properly carried out, prevents procreation by the individual  operated upon. Although the knowledge of the loss of this power may  modify the views of life held by the individual the operation _per se_  does not affect his physical or mental health. This would be  anticipated, as the production of the internal secretion of the sexual  glands in either sex (ovaries or testes) continues.    Sexual desire and capacity for coitus are not"]]]
