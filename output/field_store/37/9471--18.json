Hasan and a multitude of Turks and Arabs hung forever on their  flanks. The dejected Italians, who had no stomach for this sort of  work, fell often into the hands of the pursuers; the Germans, who  could do nothing without their customary internal stuffing, were mere  _impedimenta_; and only the lean Spaniard covered the retreat with  something of his natural courage.    At last the dejected army reached the Bay of Temendefust (Matifoux),  where the remains of the fleet were lying at anchor. It was resolved,  in view of the approach of winter and the impossibility of sending  supplies to an army in stormy weather, to reembark. Cortes in vain  protested: the council of war agreed that it was too late in the year  to attempt retaliation. Then a new difficulty arose: how was room to  be found in a flotilla, which had lost nearly a third of its ships,  for an army which was but a couple of thousand less than when it  landed? Regretfully Charles gave orders for the horses to be cast into  the sea, and, despite their masters' entreaties, favourite chargers of  priceless value were slaughtered and thrown overboard. The famous  breed of Spanish horses was well-nigh ruined. It was but one tragedy  more. On the 2nd of November most of the troops were on board. Charles  resolved to be the last to leave the strand; but the wind was getting  up, the sea rising, and at last he gave the order to weigh anchor.  Often is the story told in Algiers how the great Emperor, who would  fain hold Europe in the palm of his hand, sadly took the crown from  off his head and casting it into the sea said, \"Go, bauble: let some  more fortunate prince redeem and wear thee.\"    He did not sail a moment too soon. A new and terrific storm burst  forth. The ships were driven hither and thither. Where the tempest  drove them, there they helplessly wandered, and many men died from  famine and exposure. Some of the Spanish vessels were wrecked at  Algiers, and their crews and troops were sent to the bagnios. Charles  himself and Doria arrived safely at Buj[=e]ya--then a Spanish  outpost--with part of the flotilla. Here the unexpected visitors soon  caused a famine--and still the tempest raged. The half-starved rovers  in vain tried to make head against the waves, and carry the Emperor  back to Spain: eighty miles out they gave in, and the ships returned  disconsolately to the harbour. Twelve days and nights the storm  bellowed along the treacherous coast, and not till November 23rd could  the Imperial fleet set sail for the coast of Spain.    There was mourning in Castile that Yuletide. Besides eight thousand  rank and file, three hundred officers of birth had fallen victims to  the storm or the Moorish lance. Algiers teemed with Christian  captives, and it became a common saying that a Christian slave was  scarce a fair barter for an onion.    So ended this famous expedition. It was begun in glory, and ended in  shame. The whole of Christendom, one might say--for there were English  knights there, like Sir Thomas Challoner, as well as Germans,  Frenchmen, Spaniards, and Italians in the army--had gone forth to  destroy a nest of pirates, and behold, by the fury of the elements and  the foolishness of their own counsels, they were almost destroyed  themselves. They had left behind them ships and men and stores and  cannon: worse, they had left Algiers stronger and more defiant than  ever.    The Algerines, for their part, never forgot the valour of the Knights  of Malta, and the spot where they made their stand is still called  \"The Grave of the Knights.\" High up on the hillside may be seen \"the  Emperor's Castle,\" which marks the traditional place where Charles'  great pavilion was pitched on the morning of the fatal 23rd of  October.    \"The climate of Africa\"--it is the caustic comment of Admiral Jurien  de la Graviere--\"was evidently unsuited to deeds of chivalry.\"          XII.    DRAGUT REIS.    1543-1560.      The name of Dragut has already occurred more than once in this  history: it was destined to become as notorious as Barbarossa's as the  century advanced. Dragut--or Torgh[=u]d--was born on the Caramanian  coast opposite the island of Rhodes. Unlike many of his colleagues he  seems to have been the son of Mohammedan parents, tillers of the  earth. Being adventurous by nature, he took service as a boy in the  Turkish fleet and became \"a good pilot and a most excellent gunner.\"  At last he contrived to purchase and man a galleot, with which he  cruised the waters of the Levant, where his intimate acquaintance with  all the coasts and islands enabled him to seize and dispose of many  prizes. Kheyr-ed-d[=i]n Barbarossa soon came to hear of his exploits,  and welcomed him heartily when he came to pay his respects at Algiers,  in so far that he gave him the conduct of various expeditions and  eventually appointed him his lieutenant with the command of twelve  galleys. \"From thenceforward this redoubtable Corsair passed not one  summer without ravaging the coasts of Naples and Sicily: nor durst  any Christian vessels attempt to pass between Spain and Italy; for if  they offered it, he infallibly snapped them up: and when he missed any  of his prey at sea, he made himself amends by making descents along  the coasts, plundering villages and towns, and dragging away  multitudes of inhabitants into captivity.\"[38]    [Illustration: CASTLE OF JERBA.    (_Elisee Reclus._)]    In 1540, as we have seen, Dragut was caught by Giannettino Doria, who  made him a present to his great kinsman Andrea, on whose galleys he  was forced to toil in chains. La Valette, afterwards Grand Master of  Malta, who had once pulled the captive's oar on Barbarossa's ships and  knew Dragut well, one day saw the ex-Corsair straining on the galley  bank: \"Senor Dragut,\" said he, \"_usanza de guerra!_--'tis the custom  of war!\" And the prisoner, remembering his visitor's former  apprenticeship, replied cheerfully, \"_Y mudanza de fortuna_--a change  of luck!\" He did not lose heart, and in 1543 Barbarossa ransomed him  for 3000 crowns,[39] and made him chief of the galleys of the western  Corsairs. Imprisonment had sharpened his appetite for Christians, and  he harried the Italian coasts with more than his ancient zeal.  Surrounded by bold spirits and commanding a fleet of his own, Dragut  had the Mediterranean in his grasp, and even ventured to seize the  most dreaded of all foes, a Maltese galley, wherein he found 70,000  ducats intended for the repair of the fortifications of Tripoli, which  then belonged to \"the Religion.\" As the Turkish annalist says,  \"Torgh[=u]d had become the drawn sword of Islam.\"    Dragut's lair was at the island of Jerba, which tradition links with  the lotus-eaters, perhaps because of the luxuriant fertility of the  soil. The people of Jerba, despite their simple agricultural pursuits,  were impatient of control, and, as often as not, were independent of  the neighbouring kingdom of Tunis or any other state. Here, with or  without their leave, Dragut took up his position, probably in the very  castle which Roger Doria, when lord of the island, began to build in  1289; and from out the wide lake at the back the Corsair's galleots  issued to ravage the lands which were under the protection of Roger  Doria's descendants. Not content with the rich spoils of Europe,  Dragut took the Spanish outposts in Africa, one by one--Susa, Sfax,  Monastir; and finally set forth to conquer \"Africa.\"    [Illustration: SIEGE OF \"AFRICA,\" 1390.    (_From a MS._)]    It is not uncommon in Arabic to call a country and its capital by the  same name. Thus Misr meant and still means both Egypt and Cairo;  El-Andalus, both Spain and Cordova. Similarly \"Africa\" meant to the  Arabs the province of Carthage or Tunis and its capital, which was not  at first Tunis but successively Kayraw[=a]n and Mahd[=i]ya. Throughout  the later middle ages the name \"Africa\" is applied by Christian  writers to the latter city. Here it was that in 1390 a \"grand and  noble enterprize\" came to an untimely end. \"The Genoese,\" says  Froissart, \"bore great enmity to this town; for its Corsairs  frequently watched them at sea, and when strongest fell on and  plundered their ships, carrying their spoils to this town of  Africa, which was and is now their place of deposit and may be called  their warren.\" It was \"beyond measure strong, surrounded by high  walls, gates, and deep ditches.\" The chivalry of Christendom hearkened  to the prayer of the Genoese and the people of Majorca and Sardinia  and Ischia, and the many islands that groaned beneath the Corsairs'  devastations; the Duke of Bourbon took command of an expedition (at  the cost of the Genoese) which included names as famous as the Count  d'Auvergne, the Lord de Courcy, Sir John de Vienne, the Count of Eu,  and our own Henry of Beaufort; and on St. John Baptist's Day, with  much pomp, with flying banners and the blowing of trumpets, they  sailed on three hundred galleys for Barbary. Arrived before Africa,  not without the hindrance of a storm, they beheld the city in the form  of a bow, reaching out its arms to the sea; high were its ramparts;  and a colossal tower, armed with stone-projectiles, guarded the  harbour. Nevertheless the Knights landed in good heart, after a cup of  Grecian or Malmsey wine, on the Vigil of Magdalen Day (July 22nd),  unopposed, and each great lord set up his pennon before his tent over  against the fortress, with the Genoese crossbows on the right. Here  they remained nine weeks. The Saracens never offered battle, but  harassed the enemy with their skirmishers, who fired their arrows,  then dropped down behind their targets of Cappadocian leather to avoid  the enemy's return volley; then, rising again, cast their javelins  with deadly aim. What was to be done? The Duke of"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/22217"],[0,"My Reminiscences (#16)"],[1,"  poetry my childishness became too obtrusive, he could not restrain his  hearty \"Ha! Ha!\"    One day it was a poem on \"Mother India\" and as at the end of one line  the only rhyme I could think of meant a cart, I had to drag in that cart  in spite of there not being the vestige of a road by which it could  reasonably arrive,--the insistent claims of rhyme would not hear of any  excuses mere reason had to offer. The storm of laughter with which  cousin Gunendra greeted it blew away the cart back over the same  impossible path it had come by, and it has not been heard of since.    My eldest brother was then busy with his masterpiece \"The Dream  Journey,\" his cushion seat placed in the south verandah, a low desk  before him. Cousin Gunendra would come and sit there for a time every  morning. His immense capacity for enjoyment, like the breezes of spring,  helped poetry to sprout. My eldest brother would go on alternately  writing and reading out what he had written, his boisterous mirth at his  own conceits making the verandah tremble. My brother wrote a great deal  more than he finally used in his finished work, so fertile was his  poetic inspiration. Like the superabounding mango flowerets which carpet  the shade of the mango topes in spring time, the rejected pages of his  \"Dream Journey\" were to be found scattered all over the house. Had  anyone preserved them they would have been to-day a basketful of flowers  adorning our Bengali literature.    Eavesdropping at doors and peeping round corners, we used to get our  full share of this feast of poetry, so plentiful was it, with so much to  spare. My eldest brother was then at the height of his wonderful powers;  and from his pen surged, in untiring wave after wave, a tidal flood of  poetic fancy, rhyme and expression, filling and overflowing its banks  with an exuberantly joyful paean of triumph. Did we quite understand \"The  Dream Journey\"? But then did we need absolutely to understand in order  to enjoy it? We might not have got at the wealth in the ocean  depths--what could we have done with it if we had?--but we revelled in  the delights of the waves on the shore; and how gaily, at their  buffettings, did our life-blood course through every vein and artery!    The more I think of that period the more I realise that we have no  longer the thing called a _mujlis_.[33] In our boyhood we beheld the  dying rays of that intimate sociability which was characteristic of the  last generation. Neighbourly feelings were then so strong that the  _mujlis_ was a necessity, and those who could contribute to its  amenities were in great request. People now-a-days call on each other on  business, or as a matter of social duty, but not to foregather by way of  _mujlis_. They have not the time, nor are there the same intimate  relations! What goings and comings we used to see, how merry were the  rooms and verandahs with the hum of conversation and the snatches of  laughter! The faculty our predecessors had of becoming the centre of  groups and gatherings, of starting and keeping up animated and amusing  gossip, has vanished. Men still come and go, but those same verandahs  and rooms seem empty and deserted.    In those days everything from furniture to festivity was designed to be  enjoyed by the many, so that whatever of pomp or magnificence there  might have been did not savour of hauteur. These appendages have since  increased in quantity, but they have become unfeeling, and know not the  art of making high and low alike feel at home. The bare-bodied, the  indigently clad, no longer have the right to use and occupy them,  without a permit, on the strength of their smiling faces alone. Those  whom we now-a-days seek to imitate in our house-building and furnishing,  they have their own society, with its wide hospitality. The mischief  with us is that we have lost what we had, but have not the means of  building up afresh on the European standard, with the result that our  home-life has become joyless. We still meet for business or political  purposes, but never for the pleasure of simply meeting one another. We  have ceased to contrive opportunities to bring men together simply  because we love our fellow-men. I can imagine nothing more ugly than  this social miserliness; and, when I look back on those whose ringing  laughter, coming straight from their hearts, used to lighten for us the  burden of household cares, they seem to have been visitors from some  other world.          (19) _Literary Companions_      There came to me in my boyhood a friend whose help in my literary  progress was invaluable. Akshay Chowdhury was a school-fellow of my  fourth brother. He was an M. A. in English Literature for which his love  was as great as his proficiency therein. On the other hand he had an  equal fondness for our older Bengali authors and Vaishnava Poets. He  knew hundreds of Bengali songs of unknown authorship, and on these he  would launch, with voice uplifted, regardless of tune, or consequence,  or of the express disapproval of his hearers. Nor could anything, within  him or without, prevent his loudly beating time to his own music, for  which the nearest table or book served his nimble fingers to rap a  vigorous tattoo on, to help to enliven the audience.    He was also one of those with an inordinate capacity for extracting  enjoyment from all and sundry. He was as ready to absorb every bit of  goodness in a thing as he was lavish in singing its praises. He had an  extraordinary gift as a lightning composer of lyrics and songs of no  mean merit, but in which he himself had no pride of authorship. He took  no further notice of the heaps of scattered scraps of paper on which his  pencil writings had been indited. He was as indifferent to his powers  as they were prolific.    One of his longer poetic pieces was much appreciated when it appeared in  the _Bangadarsan_, and I have heard his songs sung by many who knew  nothing at all about their composer.    A genuine delight in literature is much rarer than erudition, and it was  this enthusiastic enjoyment in Akshay Babu which used to awaken my own  literary appreciation. He was as liberal in his friendships as in his  literary criticisms. Among strangers he was as a fish out of water, but  among friends discrepancies in wisdom or age made no difference to him.  With us boys he was a boy. When he took his leave, late in the evening,  from the _mujlis_ of our elders, I would buttonhole and drag him to our  school room. There, with undiminished geniality he would make himself  the life and soul of our little gathering, seated on the top of our  study table. On many such occasions I have listened to him going into a  rapturous dissertation on some English poem; engaged him in some  appreciative discussion, critical inquiry, or hot dispute; or read to  him some of my own writings and been rewarded in return with praise  unsparing.    My fourth brother Jyotirindra was one of the chief helpers in my  literary and emotional training. He was an enthusiast himself and loved  to evoke enthusiasm in others. He did not allow the difference between  our ages to be any bar to my free intellectual and sentimental  intercourse with him. This great boon of freedom which he allowed me,  none else would have dared to do; many even blamed him for it. His  companionship made it possible for me to shake off my shrinking  sensitiveness. It was as necessary for my soul after its rigorous  repression during my infancy as are the monsoon clouds after a fiery  summer.    But for such snapping of my shackles I might have become crippled for  life. Those in authority are never tired of holding forth the  possibility of the abuse of freedom as a reason for withholding it, but  without that possibility freedom would not be really free. And the only  way of learning how to use properly a thing is through its misuse. For  myself, at least, I can truly say that what little mischief resulted  from my freedom always led the way to the means of curing mischief. I  have never been able to make my own anything which they tried to compel  me to swallow by getting hold of me, physically or mentally, by the  ears. Nothing but sorrow have I ever gained except when left freely to  myself.    My brother Jyotirindra unreservedly let me go my own way to  self-knowledge, and only since then could my nature prepare to put  forth its thorns, it may be, but likewise its flowers. This experience  of mine has led me to dread, not so much evil itself, as tyrannical  attempts to create goodness. Of punitive police, political or moral, I  have a wholesome horror. The state of slavery which is thus brought on  is the worst form of cancer to which humanity is subject.    My brother at one time would spend days at his piano engrossed in the  creation of new tunes. Showers of melody would stream from under his  dancing fingers, while Akshay Babu and I, seated on either side, would  be busy fitting words to the tunes as they grew into shape to help to  hold them in our memories.[34] This is how I served my apprenticeship in  the composition of songs.    While we were growing to boyhood music was largely cultivated in our  family. This had the advantage of making it possible for me to imbibe  it, without an effort, into my whole being. It had also the disadvantage  of not giving me that technical mastery which the effort of learning  step by step alone can give. Of what may be called proficiency in music,  therefore, I acquired none.    Ever since my return from the Himalayas it was a case of my getting more  freedom, more and more. The rule of the servants came to an end; I saw  to it with many a device that the bonds of my school life were also  loosened; nor to my home tutors did I give much scope. Gyan Babu, after  taking me through \"The Birth of the War-god\" and one or two other books  in a desultory fashion, went off to take up a legal career. Then came  Braja Babu. The first day"]]]
