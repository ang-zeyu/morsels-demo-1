[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/19164"],[0,"Lectures on Art, Delivered Before the University of Oxford in Hilary Term, 1870 (#16)"],[1,"alternate links of triumphant  discovery that tissue is composed of vessels, and that vessels are  composed of tissue, have not hitherto completely explained to us either  the origin, the energy, or the course of the sap; and which however  subtle or successful, bear to the real natural history of plants only  the relation that anatomy and organic chemistry bear to the history of  men. In the meantime, our artists are so generally convinced of the  truth of the Darwinian theory that they do not always think it necessary  to show any difference between the foliage of an elm and an oak; and the  gift-books of Christmas have every page surrounded with laboriously  engraved garlands of rose, shamrock, thistle, and forget-me-not, without  its being thought proper by the draughtsman, or desirable by the public,  even in the case of those uncommon flowers, to observe the real shape of  the petals of any one of them.      107. Now what we especially need at present for educational purposes is  to know, not the anatomy of plants, but their biography--how and where  they live and die, their tempers, benevolences, malignities, distresses,  and virtues. We want them drawn from their youth to their age, from bud  to fruit. We ought to see the various forms of their diminished but  hardy growth in cold climates, or poor soils; and their rank or wild  luxuriance, when full-fed, and warmly nursed. And all this we ought to  have drawn so accurately, that we might at once compare any given part  of a plant with the same part of any other, drawn on the like  conditions. Now, is not this a work which we may set about here in  Oxford, with good hope and much pleasure? I think it is so important,  that the first exercise in drawing I shall put before you will be an  outline of a laurel leaf. You will find in the opening sentence of  Lionardo's treatise, our present text-book, that you must not at first  draw from nature, but from a good master's work, \"per assuefarsi a buone  membra,\" to accustom yourselves, that is, to entirely good  representative organic forms. So your first exercise shall be the top of  the laurel sceptre of Apollo, drawn by an Italian engraver of Lionardo's  own time; then we will draw a laurel leaf itself; and little by little,  I think we may both learn ourselves, and teach to many besides, somewhat  more than we know yet, of the wild olives of Greece, and the wild roses  of England.      108. Next, in Geology, which I will take leave to consider as an  entirely separate science from the zoology of the past, which has lately  usurped its name and interest. In geology itself we find the strength of  many able men occupied in debating questions of which there are yet no  data even for the clear statement; and in seizing advanced theoretical  positions on the mere contingency of their being afterwards tenable;  while, in the meantime, no simple person, taking a holiday in  Cumberland, can get an intelligible section of Skiddaw, or a clear  account of the origin of the Skiddaw slates; and while, though half the  educated society of London travel every summer over the great plain of  Switzerland, none know, or care to know, why that is a plain, and the  Alps to the south of it are Alps; and whether or not the gravel of the  one has anything to do with the rocks of the other. And though every  palace in Europe owes part of its decoration to variegated marbles, and  nearly every woman in Europe part of her decoration to pieces of jasper  or chalcedony, I do not think any geologist could at this moment with  authority tell us either how a piece of marble is stained, or what  causes the streaks in a Scotch pebble.      109. Now, as soon as you have obtained the power of drawing, I do not  say a mountain, but even a stone, accurately, every question of this  kind will become to you at once attractive and definite; you will find  that in the grain, the lustre, and the cleavage-lines of the smallest  fragment of rock, there are recorded forces of every order and  magnitude, from those which raise a continent by one volcanic effort, to  those which at every instant are polishing the apparently complete  crystal in its nest, and conducting the apparently motionless metal in  its vein; and that only by the art of your own hand, and fidelity of  sight which it develops, you can obtain true perception of these  invincible and inimitable arts of the earth herself; while the  comparatively slight effort necessary to obtain so much skill as may  serviceably draw mountains in distant effect will be instantly rewarded  by what is almost equivalent to a new sense of the conditions of their  structure.      110. And, because it is well at once to know some direction in which our  work may be definite, let me suggest to those of you who may intend  passing their vacation in Switzerland, and who care about mountains,  that if they will first qualify themselves to take angles of position  and elevation with correctness, and to draw outlines with approximate  fidelity, there are a series of problems of the highest interest to be  worked out on the southern edge of the Swiss plain, in the study of the  relations of its molasse beds to the rocks which are characteristically  developed in the chain of the Stockhorn, Beatenberg, Pilate, Mythen  above Schwytz, and High Sentis of Appenzell, the pursuit of which may  lead them into many pleasant, as well as creditably dangerous, walks,  and curious discoveries; and will be good for the discipline of their  fingers in the pencilling of crag form.      111. I wish I could ask you to draw, instead of the Alps, the crests of  Parnassus and Olympus, and the ravines of Delphi and of Tempe. I have  not loved the arts of Greece as others have; yet I love them, and her,  so much, that it is to me simply a standing marvel how scholars can  endure for all these centuries, during which their chief education has  been in the language and policy of Greece, to have only the names of her  hills and rivers upon their lips, and never one line of conception of  them in their mind's sight. Which of us knows what the valley of Sparta  is like, or the great mountain vase of Arcadia? which of us, except in  mere airy syllabling of names, knows aught of \"sandy Ladon's lilied  banks, or old Lycaeus, or Cyllene hoar\"? \"You cannot travel in  Greece?\"--I know it; nor in Magna Graecia. But, gentlemen of England, you  had better find out why you cannot, and put an end to that horror of  European shame, before you hope to learn Greek art.      112. I scarcely know whether to place among the things useful to art,  or to science, the systematic record, by drawing, of phenomena of the  sky. But I am quite sure that your work cannot in any direction be more  useful to yourselves, than in enabling you to perceive the quite  unparalleled subtilties of colour and inorganic form, which occur on any  ordinarily fine morning or evening horizon; and I will even confess to  you another of my perhaps too sanguine expectations, that in some far  distant time it may come to pass, that young Englishmen and Englishwomen  may think the breath of the morning sky pleasanter than that of  midnight, and its light prettier than that of candles.      113. Lastly, in Zoology. What the Greeks did for the horse, and what, as  far as regards domestic and expressional character, Landseer has done  for the dog and the deer, remains to be done by art for nearly all other  animals of high organisation. There are few birds or beasts that have  not a range of character which, if not equal to that of the horse or  dog, is yet as interesting within narrower limits, and often in  grotesqueness, intensity, or wild and timid pathos, more singular and  mysterious. Whatever love of humour you have,--whatever sympathy with  imperfect, but most subtle, feeling,--whatever perception of sublimity  in conditions of fatal power, may here find fullest occupation: all  these being joined, in the strong animal races, to a variable and  fantastic beauty far beyond anything that merely formative art has yet  conceived. I have placed in your Educational series a wing by Albert  Duerer, which goes as far as art yet has reached in delineation of  plumage; while for the simple action of the pinion it is impossible to  go beyond what has been done already by Titian and Tintoret; but you  cannot so much as once look at the rufflings of the plumes of a pelican  pluming itself after it has been in the water, or carefully draw the  contours of the wing either of a vulture or a common swift, or paint the  rose and vermilion on that of a flamingo, without receiving almost a new  conception of the meaning of form and colour in creation.      114. Lastly. Your work, in all directions I have hitherto indicated,  may be as deliberate as you choose; there is no immediate fear of the  extinction of many species of flowers or animals; and the Alps, and  valley of Sparta, will wait your leisure, I fear too long. But the  feudal and monastic buildings of Europe, and still more the streets of  her ancient cities, are vanishing like dreams: and it is difficult to  imagine the mingled envy and contempt with which future generations will  look back to us, who still possessed such things, yet made no effort to  preserve, and scarcely any to delineate them: for when used as material  of landscape by the modern artist, they are nearly always superficially  or flatteringly represented, without zeal enough to penetrate their  character, or patience enough to render it in modest harmony. As for  places of traditional interest, I do not know an entirely faithful  drawing of any historical site, except one or two studies made by  enthusiastic young painters in Palestine and Egypt: for which, thanks to  them always: but we want work nearer home.      115. Now it is quite probable that some of you, who will not care to go  through the labour necessary to draw flowers or animals, may yet have  pleasure"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/19166"],[0,"The Quirt (#16)"],[1,"eep, narrow  road along the edge of Spirit Canyon, Brit dwelt upon the probable moves  of the Sawtooth. They would wait, he thought, until the fence was  completed and they had made a trail around through the lava rocks. They  would not risk any move at present; they would wait and tacitly accept  the fence, or pretend to accept it, as a natural inconvenience. But Brit  did not deceive himself that they would remain passive. That it had been  \"hands off the Quirt\" he did not know, but attributed the Quirt's  immunity to careful habits and the fact that they had never come to the  point where their interests actually clashed with the Sawtooth.    It never occurred to him therefore that he was slated for an accident  that day if the details could be conveniently arranged.    It was a long trail to Sugar Spring, and from there up Spirit Canyon the  climb was so tedious and steep that Brit took a full hour for the trip,  resting the team often because they were soft from the new grass diet  and sweated easily. They lost none of their spirit, however, and when  the road was steepest nagged at each other with head-shakings and bared  teeth, and ducked against each other in pretended fright at every  unusual rock or bush.    At the top he was forced to drive a full half mile beyond the piled  posts to a flat large enough to turn around. All this took time,  especially since Caroline, the brown mare, would rather travel ten miles  straight ahead than go backward ten feet. Brit was obliged to \"take it  out of her\" with the rein ends and his full repertoire of opprobrious  epithets before he could cramp the wagon and head them down the trail  again.    At the post pile he unhitched the team for safety's sake and tied them  to trees, where he fed them a little grain in nose bags. He was absorbed  now in his work and thought no more about the Sawtooth. He fastened the  log chain to the rear wheels to brake the wagon on the long grade down  the canyon, loaded the wagon with posts, bound them fast with a lighter  chain he had brought for the purpose, ate his own lunch and decided  that, since he had made fair time and would arrive home too early to do  the chores and too late to start any other job, he would cruise farther  up the mountain side and see what was the prospect of getting out logs  enough for an addition to the cabin.    Now that Raine was going to live with him, two rooms were not enough.  Brit wanted to make her as happy as he could, in his limited fashion. He  had for some days been planning a \"settin' room and bedroom\" for her.  She would be having beaux after awhile when she got acquainted, he  supposed. He could not deny her the privilege; she was young and she  was, in Brit's opinion, the best looking girl he had ever seen, not even  excepting Minnie, her mother. But he hoped she wouldn't go off and get  married the first thing she did,--and one good way to prevent that, he  reasoned, was to make her comfortable with him. He had noticed how  pleased she was that their cabin was of logs. She had even remarked that  she could not understand how a rancher would ever want to build a board  shack if there was any timber to be had. Well, timber was to be had, and  she should have her log house, though the hauling was not going to be  any sunshine, in Brit's opinion. With his axe he walked through the  timber, craning upward for straight tree trunks and lightly blazing the  ones he would want, the occasional axe strokes sounding distinctly in  the quiet air.    Lorraine heard them as she rode old Yellowjacket puffing up the grade,  following the wagon marks, and knew that she was nearing the end of her  journey,--for which Yellowjacket, she supposed, would be thankful. She  had started not more than an hour later than her father, but the team  had trotted along more briskly than her poor old nag would travel, so  that she did not overtake her dad as she had hoped.    She was topping the last climb when she saw the team tied to the trees,  and at the same moment she caught a glimpse of a man who crawled out  from under the load of posts and climbed the slope farther on. She was  on the point of calling out to him, thinking that he was her dad, when  he disappeared into the brush. At the same moment she heard the stroke  of an axe over to the right of where the man was climbing.    She was riding past the team when Caroline humped her back and kicked  viciously at Yellowjacket, who plunged straight down off the trail  without waiting to see whether Caroline's aim was exact. He slid into a  juniper thicket and sat down looking very perplexed and very permanently  placed there. Lorraine stepped off on the uphill side of him, thanked  her lucky stars she had not broken a leg, and tried to reassure  Yellowjacket and to persuade him that no real harm had been done him.  Straightway she discovered that Yellowjacket had a mind of his own and  that a pessimistic mind. He refused to scramble back into the trail,  preferring to sit where he was, or since Lorraine made that too  uncomfortable, to stand where he had been sitting. Yellowjacket, I may  explain, owned a Roman nose, a pendulous lower lip and drooping eyelids.  Those who know horses will understand.    By the time Lorraine had bullied and cajoled him into making a somewhat  circuitous route to the road, where he finally appeared some distance  above the point of his descent, Brit was there, hitching the team to the  wagon.    \"What yuh doing up there?\" he wanted to know, looking up with some  astonishment.    Lorraine furnished him with details and her opinion of both Caroline and  Yellow jacket. \"I simply refuse to ride this comedy animal another  mile,\" she declared with some heat. \"I'll drive the team and you can  ride him home, or he can be tied on behind the wagon.\"    \"He won't lead,\" Brit objected. \"Yeller's all right if you make up your  mind to a few failin's. You go ahead and ride him home. You sure can't  drive this team.\"    \"I can!\" Lorraine contended. \"I've driven four horses--I guess I can  drive two, all right.\"    \"Well, you ain't going to,\" Brit stated with a flat finality that  abruptly ended the argument.    Lorraine had never before been really angry with her father. She struck  Yellowjacket with her quirt and sent him sidling past the wagon and the  tricky Caroline, too stubborn to answer her dad when he called after her  that she had better ride behind the load. She went on, making  Yellowjacket trot when he did not want to trot down hill.    Behind her she heard the chuck-chuck of the loaded wagon. Far ahead she  heard some one whistling a high, sweet melody which had the queer, minor  strains of some old folk song. For just a few bars she heard it, and  then it was stilled, and the road dipping steeply before her seemed very  lonely, its emptiness cooling her brief anger to a depression that had  held her too often in its grip since that terrible night of the storm.  For the first time she looked back at her father lurching along on the  load and at the team looking so funny with the collars pushed up on  their necks with the weight of the load behind.    With a quick impulse of penitence she waved her hand to Brit, who waved  back at her. Then she went on, feeling a bit less alone in the world.  After all, he was her dad, and his life had been hard. If he failed to  understand her and her mental hunger for real companionship, perhaps she  also failed to understand him.    They had left the timber line now and had come to the lip of the canyon  itself. Lorraine looked down its steep, rock-roughened sides and  thought how her old director would have raved over its possibilities in  the way of \"stunts.\" Yellow jacket, she noticed, kept circumspectly to  the center of the trail and eyed the canyon with frank disfavor.    She did not know at just what moment she became aware of trouble behind  her. It may have been Yellowjacket, turning his head sidewise and  abruptly quickening his pace that warned her. It may have been the  difference in the sound of the wagon and the impact of the horses' hoofs  on the rocky trail. She turned and saw that something had gone wrong.  They were coming down upon her at a sharp trot, stepping high, the wagon  tongue thrust up between their heads as they tried to hold back the  load.    Brit yelled to her then to get out of the way, and his voice was harsh  and insistent. Lorraine looked at the steep bank to the right, knew  instinctively that Yellowjacket would never have time to climb it before  the team was upon them, and urged him to a lope. She glanced back again,  saw that the team was not running away, that they were trying to hold  the wagon, and that it was gaining momentum in spite of them.    \"Jump, dad!\" she called and got no answer. Brit was sitting braced with  his feet far apart, holding and guiding the team. \"He won't jump--he  wouldn't jump--any more than I would,\" she chattered to herself, sick  with fear for him, while she lashed her own horse to keep out of their  way.    The next she knew, the team was running, their eyeballs staring, their  front feet flung high as they lunged panic-stricken down the trail. The  load was rocking along behind them. Brit was still braced and clinging  to the reins.    Panic seized Yellowjacket. He, too, went lunging down that trail, his  head thrown from side to side that he might watch the thing that menaced  him, heedless of the fact that danger might lie ahead of him also.  Lorraine knew that he was running senselessly, that he might leave the  trail at any bend and go rolling into the canyon.    A sense of unreality seized her. It could not be deadly earnest, she  thought. It was so exactly like some movie thrill, planned carefully in  advance, rehearsed perhaps under the critical eye of the director, and  done now with the camera man turning calmly the little crank and  counting the number of film feet the scene would take.
