How much more then       where it is a faculty, not a substance, we are examining; where       it eludes the research of all the senses; where the conditions of       its existence are various and variously combined; where the       effects of those which are present or absent bid defiance to       calculation; let me all too, as a circumstance of great       tenderness, where our conclusion would degrade a whole race of       men from the rank in the scale of beings which their Creator may       perhaps have given them. To our reproach it must be said, that       though for a century and a half we have had under our eyes the       races of black and or red men, they have never yet been viewed by       us as subjects of natural history. I advance it, therefore, as a       suspicion only, that the blacks, whether originally a distinct       race, or made distinct by time and circumstances, are inferior to       the whites in the endowments both of body and mind. It is not       against experience to suppose that different species of the same       genus, or varieties of the same species, may possess different       qualifications. Will not a lover of natural history, then, one       who views the gradations in all the races of animals with the eye       of philosophy, excuse an effort to keep those in the department       of man as distinct as nature has formed them?[80]    He was impressed, however, with the integrity of the Negroes and paid  them the following tribute:         Notwithstanding these considerations which must weaken their       respect for the laws of property, we find among them numerous       instances of the most rigid integrity, and as many as among their       better instructed masters, of benevolence, gratitude, and       unshaken fidelity.[81]      V    In later years it seems that Jefferson changed from his position of  certainty as to the inferiority of the Negro to that of doubt. At one  time he believed in the possibilities of the Negro and then again he  receded from that position to take up the argument that the blacks  lack the capacity with which the whites are endowed. Jefferson shows  that he was either ill-informed or insincere. Writing to General  Chastellux in 1785 concerning the future of the Negro Jefferson  remarked:         I have supposed the black man, in his present state might not be       in body and mind equal to the white man; but it would be       hazardous to affirm, that, equally cultivated for a few       generations, he would not become so.[82]    To Benjamin Banneker, the surveyor and astronomer, who was regarded by  some as his friend, he addressed the following in 1791:         Nobody wishes more than I do to see such proofs as you exhibit,       that nature has given to our black brethren talents equal to       those of the other colors of men, and that the appearance of a       want of them is owing merely to the degraded condition of their       existence, both in Africa and America.... I have taken the       liberty of sending your Almanac to Monsieur de Condorcet,       Secretary of the Academy of Sciences at Paris, and member of the       Philanthropic Society, because I considered it as a document to       which your color had a right for their justification against the       doubts which have been entertained of them[83]    Jefferson's letter to the Marquis de Condorcet presented Banneker's  attainments as evidence of the mental capacity of Negroes. He said:         We have now in the United States a Negro, the son of a black man       born in Africa and a black woman born in the United States, who       is a very respectable mathematician. I procured him to be       employed under one of our chief directors in laying out the new       Federal City on the Potomac and in the intervals of his leisure,       while on that work, he made an almanac for the next year, which       he sent me in his own handwriting, and which I enclose to you. I       have seen very elegant solutions of geometrical problems by him.       Add to this that he is a very worthy and respectable member of       society. He is a free man. I shall be delighted to see these       instances of moral eminence so multiplied as to prove that the       want of talents observed in them, is merely the effect of their       degraded condition, and not proceeding from any difference in the       structure of the parts on which intellect depends[84]    In a letter to Banneker himself concerning the achievements of this  astronomer and mathematician, Jefferson said:         Nobody wishes more ardently than I do to see a good system       commenced for raising the condition both of their body and mind       to what it ought to be, as fast as the imbecility of their       present existence, and other circumstances which cannot be       neglected, will admit.[85]    A generation later he had, as this letter indicates, retained the  opinion that the possibilities of the Negroes were not necessarily  limited. To Henri Gregoire who had sent Jefferson a copy of his  _Litterature des Negres_, he wrote:         Be assured that no person living wishes more sincerely than I do       to see a complete refutation of the doubts I have myself       entertained and expressed on the grade of understanding allotted       to the negroes by nature, and to find that in this respect they       are on a par with ourselves. My doubts were the result of       personal observation on the limited sphere of my own State, where       the opportunities for the development of their genius were not       favorable, and those of exercising it still less so. I expressed       them, therefore, with great hesitation; but whatever be their       degree of talent it is no measure of their rights. Because Sir       Isaac Newton was superior to others in understanding, he was not       therefore lord of the person or property of others. On this       subject they are gaining daily in the opinions of nations, and       hopeful advances are making towards their reestablishment on an       equal footing with the other colors of the human family. I pray       you, therefore, to accept my thanks for the many instances you       have enabled me to observe of respectable intelligence in that       race of men, which cannot fail to have effect in hastening the       day of their relief.[86]    Writing to Joel Barlow about the same time Jefferson showed a  different attitude. He said:         Bishop Gregoire wrote to me on the doubts I had expressed five or       six and twenty years ago, in the _Notes on Virginia_, as to the       grade of understanding of the negroes. His credulity has made him       gather up every story he could find of men of color (without       distinguishing whether black, or of what degree of mixture),       however slight the mention, or light the authority on which they       are quoted. The whole do not amount, in point of evidence, to       what we know ourselves of Banneker. We know he had spherical       trigonometry enough to make almanacs, but not without the       suspicion of aid from Ellicot, who was his neighbor and friend,       and never missed an opportunity of puffing him. I have a long       letter from Banneker, which shows him to have had a mind of very       common stature indeed. As to Bishop Gregoire, I wrote him a very       soft answer. It was impossible for doubt to have been more       tenderly or hesitantingly expressed than that was in the _Notes       on Virginia_, and nothing was or is further from my intentions,       than to enlist myself as the champion of a fixed opinion, where I       have only expressed a doubt. St. Domingo will, in time, throw       light on the question.[87]    He did believe, however, in the industry of the Negroes and thought  that this virtue of theirs would make their colonization possible.  Concerning such a project he wrote Miss Fanny Wright in 1825:         An opinion is hazarded by some, but proved by none, that moral       urgencies are not sufficient to induce the negro to labor; that       nothing can do this but physical coercion. But this a problem       which the present age alone is prepared to solve by experiment.       It would be a solecism to suppose a race or animals created,       without sufficient foresight and energy to preserve their own       existence. It is disproved, too, by the fact that they exist, and       have existed through all the ages of history. We are not       sufficiently acquainted with all the nations of Africa, to say       that there may not be some in which habits of industry are       established, and the arts practiced which are necessary to render       life comfortable. The experiment now in progress in St. Domingo,       those of Sierra Leone and Cape Mesurado, are but beginning. Your       proposition has its aspects of promise also; and should it not       fully answer to calculations in figures, it may yet, in its       developments, lead to happy results.[88]      VI    Jefferson believed that the emancipation of the slaves could be  effected by legislation. To this end he made several noteworthy  efforts. In 1776 he submitted to the revolutionary convention in  Virginia a constitution in which was incorporated the clause  prohibiting slavery. He undertook also to induce the legislature of  Virginia to take this step in 1783, and as chairman of the committee  of the Congress of the Confederation appointed to draw up an ordinance  for the government of the Northwest Territory, he submitted a plan  providing that after the year 1800 neither slavery nor involuntary  servitude should exist there. These clauses and some comments thereon  follow:         No person hereafter coming into this country shall be held within       the same in"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/20907"],[0,"The Best of the World's Classics,  Restricted to prose. Volume I (of X) - Greece (#16)"],[1," persons, either Greeks or barbarians. Of this fact the  following is a proof: that no one deserted to the king from Cyrus,  tho only a subject (except that Orontes[48] attempted to do so; but he  soon found the person whom he believed faithful to him more a friend  to Cyrus than to himself), while many came over to Cyrus from the  king, after they had become enemies to each other, and these, too, men  who were greatly beloved by the king; for they felt persuaded that if  they proved themselves brave soldiers under Cyrus, they would obtain  from him more adequate rewards for their services than from the king.    What occurred also at the time of his death is a great proof as well  that he himself was a man of merit as that he could accurately  distinguish such as were trustworthy, well disposed, and constant to  their attachment. For when he was killed, all his friends and the  partakers of his table who were with him fell fighting in his defense  except Ariaeus, who had been posted in command of the cavalry on the  left; and, when he learned that Cyrus had fallen in the battle, he  took to flight, with all the troops which he had under his command.

The next day it was thought necessary to march away as fast as  possible, before the enemy's force should be reassembled, and get  possession of the pass. Collecting their baggage at once, therefore,  they set forward through a deep snow, taking with them several guides;  and, having the same day passed the height on which Tiribazus had  intended to attack them, they encamped. Hence they proceeded three  days' journey, through a desert tract of country, a distance of  fifteen parasangs, to the river Euphrates, and passed it without being  wet higher than the middle. The sources of the river were said not to  be far off.    Hence they advanced three days' march, through much snow and a level  plain, a distance of fifteen parasangs; the third day's march was  extremely troublesome, as the north wind blew full in their faces,  completely parching up everything and benumbing the men. One of the  augurs, in consequence, advised that they should sacrifice to the  wind; and a sacrifice was accordingly offered, when the vehemence of  the wind appeared to every one manifestly to abate. The depth of the  snow was a fathom; so that many of the baggage-cattle and slaves  perished, with about thirty of the soldiers. They continued to burn  fires through the whole night, for there was plenty of wood at the  place of encampment. But those who came up late could get no wood;  those therefore who had arrived before, and had kindled fires, would  not admit the late comers to the fire unless they gave them a share of  the corn or other provisions that they had brought. Thus they shared  with one another what they respectively had. In the places where the  fires were made, as the snow melted, there were formed large pits that  reached to the ground; and here there was accordingly opportunity to  measure the depth of the snow.    Hence they marched through snow the whole of the following day, and  many of the men contracted the bulimia. Xenophon, who commanded in the  rear, finding in his way such of the men as had fallen down with it,  knew not what disease it was. But as one of those acquainted with it  told him that they were evidently affected with bulimia, and that they  would get up if they had something to eat, he went round among the  baggage, and, wherever he saw anything eatable, he gave it out, and  sent such as were able to run to distribute it among those diseased,  who, as soon as they had eaten, rose up and continued their march. As  they proceeded, Cheirisophus[50] came, just as it grew dark, to a  village, and found a spring in front of the rampart, some women and  girls belonging to the place fetching water. The women asked them who  they were; and the interpreter answered, in the Persian language, that  they were people going from the king to the satrap. They replied that  he was not there, but about a parasang off.    However, as it was late, they went with the water-carriers within the  rampart to the head man of the village; and here Cheirisophus, and as  many of the troops as could come up, encamped; but of the rest, such  as were unable to get to the end of the journey spent the night on the  way without food or fire; and some of the soldiers lost their lives on  that occasion. Some of the enemy too, who had collected themselves  into a body, pursued our rear, and seized any of the baggage-cattle  that were unable to proceed, fighting with one another for the  possession of them. Such of the soldiers, also, as had lost their  sight from the effects of the snow, or had had their toes mortified by  the cold, were left behind. It was found to be a relief to the eyes  against the snow if the soldiers kept something black before them on  the march, and to the feet, if they kept constantly in motion, and  allowed themselves no rest, and if they took off their shoes in the  night; but as to such as slept with their shoes on, the straps worked  into their feet, and the soles were frozen about them; for when their  old shoes had failed them, shoes of raw hides had been made by the  men themselves from the newly skinned oxen.    From such unavoidable sufferings, some of the soldiers were left  behind, who, seeing a piece of ground of a black appearance, from the  snow having disappeared there, conjectured that it must have melted;  and it had, in fact, melted in the spot from the effect of a fountain,  which was sending up a vapor in a woody hollow close at hand. Turning  aside thither, they sat down and refused to proceed farther. Xenophon,  who was with the rear-guard, as soon as he heard this, tried to  prevail on them by every art and means not to be left behind, telling  them, at the same time, that the enemy were collected and pursuing  them in great numbers. At last he grew angry; and they told him to  kill them, as they were quite unable to go forward. He then thought it  the best course to strike terror, if possible, into the enemy that  were behind, lest they should fall upon the exhausted soldiers. It was  now dark, and the enemy were advancing with a great noise, quarreling  about the booty that they had taken, when such of the rear-guard as  were not disabled started up, and rushed toward them, while the tired  men, shouting as loud as they could, clashed their spears against  their shields. The enemy, struck with alarm, threw themselves into the  hollow amid the snow, and no one of them afterward made himself heard  from any quarter.    Xenophon, and those with him, telling the sick men that a party would  come to their relief next day, proceeded on their march, but before  they had gone four stadia they found other soldiers resting by the  way in the snow, and covered up with it, no guard being stationed over  them. They roused them up, but they said that the head of the army was  not moving forward. Xenophon, going past them, and sending on some of  the ablest of the peltasts, ordered them to ascertain what it was that  hindered their progress. They brought word that the whole army was in  that manner taking rest. Xenophon and his men, therefore, stationing  such a guard as they could, took up quarters there without fire or  supper. When it was near day, he sent the youngest of his men to the  sick, telling them to rouse them and oblige them to proceed.    At this juncture Cheirisophus sent some of his people from the  villages to see how the rear were faring. The young men were rejoiced  to see them, and gave them the sick to conduct to the camp, while they  themselves went forward, and, before they had gone twenty stadia,  found themselves at the village in which Cheirisophus was quartered.  When they came together, it was thought safe enough to lodge the  troops up and down in the villages. Cheirisophus accordingly remained  where he was, and the other officers, appropriating by lot the several  villages that they had in sight, went to their respective quarters  with their men.    Here Polycrates, an Athenian captain, requested leave of absence, and,  taking with him the most active of his men, and hastening to the  village which Xenophon had been allotted, surprized all the villagers  and their head man in their houses, together with seventeen colts that  were bred as a tribute for the king, and the head man's daughter, who  had been but nine days married; her husband was gone out to hunt  hares, and was not found in any of the villages. Their houses were  under ground, the entrance like the mouth of a well, but spacious  below; there were passages dug into them for the cattle, but the  people descended by ladders. In the houses were goats, sheep, cows,  and fowls, with their young; all the cattle were kept on fodder within  the walls.[51] There were also wheat, barley, leguminous vegetables,  and barley-wine, in large"]]]
