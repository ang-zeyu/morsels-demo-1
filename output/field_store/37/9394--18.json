It is more probable, however, that my soul has grown to appreciate  Nature more fully....\"[80]    Susan needed that growth of soul to face the events of the next few  years and do the work which lay ahead. The whole country was tense  over the slavery issue, which could no longer be pushed into the  background. On public platforms and at every fireside, men and women  were discussing the subject. Antislavery workers sensed the gravity of  the situation and felt the onrush of the impending conflict between  what they regarded as the forces of good and evil--freedom and  slavery. When the Republican leader, William H. Seward, spoke in  Rochester, of \"an irrepressible conflict between opposing and enduring  forces,\"[81] he was expressing only what Garrisonian abolitionists,  like Susan, always had recognized. In the West, a tall awkward country  lawyer, Abraham Lincoln, debating with the suave Stephen A. Douglas,  declared with prophetic wisdom, \"'A house divided against itself  cannot stand.' I believe this government cannot endure permanently  half slave and half free.... It will become all one thing or all the  other.'\"[82]    So Susan believed, and she was doing her best to make it all free.  Not only was she holding antislavery meetings, making speeches, and  distributing leaflets whenever and wherever possible, but she was also  lobbying in Albany for a personal liberty bill to protect the slaves  who were escaping from the South. \"Treason in the Capitol,\" the  Democratic press labeled efforts for a personal liberty bill, and as  Susan reported to William Lloyd Garrison,[83] even Republicans shied  away from it, many of them regarding Seward's \"irrepressible conflict\"  speech a sorry mistake. Such timidity and shilly-shallying were  repugnant to her. She could better understand the fervor of John Brown  although he fought with bullets.    Yet John Brown's fervor soon ended in tragedy, sowing seeds of fear,  distrust, and bitter partisanship in all parts of the country. When,  in October 1859, the startling news reached Susan of the raid on  Harper's Ferry and the capture of John Brown, she sadly tried to piece  together the story of his failure. She admired and respected John  Brown, believing he had saved Kansas for freedom. That he had further  ambitious plans was common knowledge among antislavery workers, for he  had talked them over with Gerrit Smith, Frederick Douglass, and the  three young militants, Thomas Wentworth Higginson, Frank Sanborn, and  Samuel Gridley Howe. Somehow these plans had failed, but she was sure  that his motives were good. He was imprisoned, accused of treason and  murder, and in his carpetbag were papers which, it was said,  implicated prominent antislavery workers. Now his friends were fleeing  the country, Sanborn, Douglass, and Howe. Gerrit Smith broke down so  completely that for a time his mind was affected. Thomas Wentworth  Higginson, defiant and unafraid, stuck by John Brown to the end,  befriending his family, hoping to rescue him as he had rescued  fugitive slaves.    Scanning the _Liberator_ for its comment on John Brown, Susan found it  colored, as she had expected, by Garrison's instinctive opposition to  all war and bloodshed. He called the raid \"a misguided, wild,  apparently insane though disinterested and well-intentioned effort by  insurrection to emancipate the slaves of Virginia,\" but even he added,  \"Let no one who glories in the Revolutionary struggle of 1776 deny the  right of the slaves to imitate the example of our fathers.\"[84]    Behind closed doors and in public meetings, abolitionists pledged  their allegiance to John Brown's noble purpose. He had wanted no  bloodshed, they said, had no thought of stirring up slaves to brutal  revenge. The raid was to be merely a signal for slaves to arise, to  cast off slavery forever, to follow him to a mountain refuge, which  other slave insurrections would reinforce until all slaves were free.  To him the plan seemed logical and he was convinced it was  God-inspired. To some of his friends it seemed possible--just a step  beyond the Underground Railroad and hiding fugitive slaves. To Susan  he was a hero and a martyr.    Southerners, increasingly fearful of slave insurrections, called John  Brown a cold-blooded murderer and accused Republicans--\"black  Republicans,\" they classed them--of taking orders from abolitionists  and planning evil against them. To law-abiding northerners, John Brown  was a menace, stirring up lawlessness. Seward and Lincoln, speaking  for the Republicans, declared that violence, bloodshed, and treason  could not be excused even if slavery was wrong and Brown thought he  was right. All saw before them the horrible threat of civil war.    During John Brown's trial, his friends did their utmost to save him.  The noble old giant with flowing white beard, who had always been more  or less of a legend, now to them assumed heroic proportions. His  calmness, his steadfastness in what he believed to be right captured  the imagination.    The jury declared him guilty--guilty of treason, of conspiring with  slaves to rebel, guilty of murder in the first degree. The papers  carried the story, and it spread by word of mouth--the story of those  last tense moments in the courtroom when John Brown declared, \"It is  unjust that I should suffer such a penalty. Had I interferred ... in  behalf of the rich, the powerful, the intelligent, the so-called  great, or in behalf of any of their friends ... it would have been all  right.... I say I am yet too young to understand that God is any  respecter of persons. I believe that to have interferred as I have  done, in behalf of His despised poor, I did no wrong but right. Now if  it is deemed necessary that I should forfeit my life for the  furtherance of the ends of justice and mingle my blood further with  the blood of my children and with the blood of millions in this slave  country whose rights are disregarded by wicked, cruel, and unjust  enactments, I say, let it be done....\"[85]    He was sentenced to die.    Susan, sick at heart, talked all this over with her abolitionist  friends and began planning a meeting of protest and mourning in  Rochester if John Brown were hanged. She engaged the city's most  popular hall for this meeting, never thinking of the animosity she  might arouse, and as she went from door to door selling tickets, she  asked for contributions for John Brown's destitute family. She tried  to get speakers from among respected Republicans to widen the popular  appeal of the meeting, but her diary records, \"Not one man of  prominence in religion or politics will identify himself with the John  Brown meeting.\"[86] Only a Free Church minister, the Rev. Abram Pryn,  and the ever-faithful Parker Pillsbury were willing to speak.    There was still hope that John Brown might be saved and excitement ran  high. Some like Higginson, unwilling to let him die, wanted to rescue  him, but Brown forbade it. Others wanted to kidnap Governor Wise of  Virginia and hold him on the high seas, a hostage for John Brown.  Wendell Phillips was one of these. Parker Pillsbury, sending Susan the  latest news from \"the seat of war\" and signing his letter, \"Faithfully  and fervently yours,\" wrote, \"My voice is against any attempt at  rescue. It would inevitably, I fear, lead to bloodshed which could not  compensate nor be compensated. If the people dare murder their victim,  as they are determined to do, and in the name of the law ... the moral  effect of the execution will be without a parallel since the scenes on  Calvary eighteen hundred years ago, and the halter that day sanctified  shall be the cord to draw millions to salvation.\"[87]    On Friday, December 2, 1859, John Brown was hanged. Through the North,  church bells tolled and prayers were said for him. Everywhere people  gathered together to mourn and honor or to condemn. In New York City,  at a big meeting which overflowed to the streets, it was resolved  \"that we regard the recent outrage at Harper's Ferry as a crime, not  only against the State of Virginia, but against the Union itself....\"  In Boston, however, Ralph Waldo Emerson spoke to a tremendous audience  of \"the new saint, than whom none purer or more brave was ever led by  love of man into conflict and death ... who will make the gallows  glorious,\" and Henry Wadsworth Longfellow recorded in his diary, \"This  will be a great day in our history; the date of a new revolution.\" Far  away in France, Victor Hugo declared, \"The eyes of Europe are fixed on  America. The hanging of John Brown will open a latent fissure that  will finally split the union asunder.... You preserve your shame, but  you kill your glory.\"[88]    In Rochester, three hundred people assembled. All were friends of the  cause and there was no unfriendly disturbance to mar the proceedings.  Susan presided and Parker Pillsbury, in her opinion, made \"the  grandest speech of his life,\" for it was the only occasion he ever  found fully wicked enough to warrant \"his terrific invective.\"[89]    Thus these two militant abolitionists, Susan B. Anthony and Parker  Pillsbury, joined hundreds of others throughout the nation in honoring  John Brown, sensing the portent of his martyrdom and prophesying that  his soul would go marching on.

As the shadows deepen and darkness  falls upon the plain, our visitor joins the groups which are now fast  leaving the meadow, and re-passes the great embrasure just as the  rushlights begin to twinkle in the windows and a swinging oil-lamp to  cast a dim light here and there in the streets. But as his company  passes out of a narrow lane debouching on to the chief market-place,  their progress is stopped by the sudden rush of a mingled crowd of  unruly apprentices and journeymen returning from their sports, with  hot heads well beliquored. Then from another side-street there is a  sudden flare of torches, borne aloft by guildsmen come out to quell  the tumult and to send off the apprentices to their dwellings, whilst  the watch also bears down and carries off some of the more turbulent  of the journeymen to pass the night in one of the towers which guard  the city wall. At last, however, the visitor reaches his inn by the  aid of a friendly guildsman and his torch; and retiring to his  chamber, with its straw-covered floor, rough oaken bedstead, hard  mattress, and coverings not much better than horse-cloths, he falls  asleep as the bell of the minster tolls out ten o'clock over the now  dark and silent city.    Such approximately would have been the view of a German city in the  sixteenth century as presented to a traveller in a time of peace. More  stirring times, however, were as frequent--times when the tocsin rang  out from the steeple all night long, calling the citizens to arms. By  such scenes, needless to say, the year of the Peasants' War was more  than usually characterized. In the days when every man carried arms  and knew how to use them, when the fighting instinct was imbibed with  the mother's milk, when every week saw some street brawl, often  attended by loss of life, and that by no means always among the most  worthless and dissolute of the inhabitants, every dissatisfaction  immediately turned itself into an armed revolt, whether it were of the  apprentices or the journeymen against the guild-masters, the body of  the townsmen against the patriciate, the town itself against its  feudal superior, where it had one, or of the knighthood against the  princes. The extremity to which disputes can at present be carried  without resulting in a breach of the peace, as evinced in modern  political and trade conflicts, exacerbated though some of them are,  was a thing unknown in the Middle Ages, and indeed to any considerable  extent until comparatively recent times. The sacred right of  insurrection was then a recognized fact of life, and but very little  straining of a dispute led to a resort to arms. In the subsequent  chapters we have to deal with the more important of those outbursts to  which the ferment due to the dissolution of the mediaeval system of  things, then beginning throughout Central Europe, gave rise, of which  the religious side is represented by what is known as the Reformation.

Tritthemii Epistolarum Familiarum_, 1536, bk. ii. ep. 47; also the works  of Paracelsus.          CHAPTER V    COUNTRY AND TOWN AT THE END OF THE MIDDLE AGES      For the complete understanding of the events which follow it must be  borne in mind that the early sixteenth century represents the end of a  distinct historical period; and, as we have pointed out in the  Introduction, the expiring effort, half-conscious and half-unconscious,  of the people to revert to the conditions of an earlier age. Nor can the  significance be properly gauged unless a clear conception is obtained of  the differences between country and town life at the beginning of the  sixteenth century. From the earliest periods of the Middle Ages of which  we have any historical record, the _Markgenossenschaft_, or primitive  village community of the Germanic race, was overlaid by a territorial  domination, imposed upon it either directly by conquest or voluntarily  accepted for the sake of the protection indispensable in that rude  period. The conflict of these two elements, the mark organization and  the territorial lordship, constitutes the marrow of the social history  of the Middle Ages.    In the earliest times the pressure of the overlord, whoever he might  be, seems to have been comparatively slight, but its inevitable  tendency was for the territorial power to extend itself at the expense  of the rural community. It was thus that in the tenth and eleventh  centuries the feudal oppression had become thoroughly settled, and had  reached its greatest intensity all over Europe. It continued thus with  little intermission until the thirteenth century, when from various  causes, economic and otherwise, matters began to improve in the  interests of the common man, till in the fifteenth century the  condition of the peasant was better than it has ever been, either  before or since within historical times, in Northern and Western  Europe. But with all this, the oppressive power of the lord of the  soil was by no means dead. It was merely dormant, and was destined to  spring into renewed activity the moment the lord's necessities  supplied a sufficient incentive. From this time forward the element of  territorial power, supported in its claims by the Roman law, with its  basis of private property, continued to eat into it until it had  finally devoured the old rights and possessions of the village  community. The executive power always tended to be transferred from  its legitimate holder, the village in its corporate capacity, to the  lord; and this was alone sufficient to place the villager at his  mercy.    At the time of the Reformation, owing to the new conditions which had  arisen and had brought about in a few decades the hitherto  unparalleled rise in prices, combined with the unprecedented  ostentation and extravagance more than once referred to in these  pages, the lord was supplied with the requisite incentive to the  exercise of the power which his feudal system gave him. Consequently,  the position of the peasant rapidly changed for the worse; and  although at the outbreak of the movement not absolutely _in extremis_,  according to our notions, yet it was so bad comparatively to his  previous condition and that less than half a century before, and  tended as evidently to become more intolerable, that discontent became  everywhere rife, and only awaited the torch of the new doctrines to  set it ablaze. The whole course of the movement shows a peasantry, not  downtrodden and starved but proud and robust, driven to take up arms  not so much by misery and despair as by the deliberate will to  maintain the advantages which were rapidly slipping away from them.    Serfdom was not by any means universal. Many free peasant villages  were to be found scattered amongst the manors of the territorial  lords, though it was but too evidently the settled policy of the  latter at this time to sweep everything into their net, and to compel  such peasant communes to accept a feudal overlordship. Nor were they  at all scrupulous in the means adopted for attaining their ends. The  ecclesiastical foundations, as before said, were especially expert in  forging documents for the purpose of proving that these free villages  were lapsed feudatories of their own. Old rights of pasture were being  curtailed, and others, notably those of hunting and fishing, had in  most manors been completely filched away.    It is noticeable, however, that although the immediate causes of the  peasant rising were the new burdens which had been laid upon the  common people during the last few years, once the spirit of discontent  was aroused it extended also in many cases to the traditional feudal  dues to which, until then, the peasant had submitted with little  murmuring, and an attempt was made by the country-side to reconquer  the ancient complete freedom of which a dim remembrance had been  handed down to them.    The condition of the peasant up to the beginning of the sixteenth  century--that is to say, up to the time when it began to so rapidly  change for the worse--may be gathered from what we are told by  contemporary writers, such as Wimpfeling, Sebastian Brandt,  Wittenweiler, the satires in the _Nuernberger Fastnachtspielen_, and  numberless other sources, as also from the sumptuary laws of the end  of the fifteenth century. All these indicate an ease and profuseness  of living which little accord with our notions of the word \"peasant\".  Wimpfeling writes: \"The peasants in our district and in many parts of  Germany have become, through their riches, stiff-necked and  ease-loving. I know peasants who at the weddings of their sons or  daughters, or the baptism of their children, make so much display that  a house and field might be bought therewith, and a small vineyard to  boot. Through their riches, they are oftentimes spendthrift in food  and in vestments, and they drink wines of price.\"    A chronicler relates of the Austrian peasants, under the date of 1478,  that \"they wore better garments and drank better wine than their  lords\"; and a sumptuary law passed at the Reichstag held at Lindau, in  1497, provides that the common peasant man and the labourer in the  towns or in the field \"shall neither make nor wear cloth that costs  more than half a gulden the ell, neither shall they wear gold,  pearls, velvet, silk, nor embroidered clothes, nor shall they permit  their wives or their children to wear such.\"    Respecting the food of the peasant, it is stated that he ate his full  in flesh of every kind, in fish, in bread, in fruit, drinking wine  often to excess. The Swabian, Heinrich Mueller, writes in the year  1550, nearly two generations after"]]]
