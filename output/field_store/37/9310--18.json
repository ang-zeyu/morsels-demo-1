Jane Jones she honestly said it was so!      Mebbe he did--      I dunno!  Still I ain't to blame, not by a big sight,  For I ain't never had any battles to fight.    She said 'at Columbus was out at the knees    When he first thought up his big scheme,  An' told all the Spaniards 'nd Italians, too,    An' all of 'em said 'twas a dream.  But Queen Isabella jest listened to him,    'Nd pawned all her jewels o' worth,  'Nd bought him the Santa Maria 'nd said,    \"Go hunt up the rest o' the earth!\"      Mebbe he did--      I dunno!  O' course that may be, but then you must allow  They ain't no land to discover jest now!        _Ben King._          The Leap of Roushan Beg      Mounted on Kyrat strong and fleet,  His chestnut steed with four white feet,    Roushan Beg, called Kurroglou,  Son of the road and bandit chief,  Seeking refuge and relief,    Up the mountain pathway flew.    Such was Kyrat's wondrous speed,  Never yet could any steed    Reach the dust-cloud in his course.  More than maiden, more than wife,  More than gold and next to life    Roushan the Robber loved his horse.    In the land that lies beyond  Erzeroum and Trebizond,    Garden-girt his fortress stood;  Plundered khan, or caravan  Journeying north from Koordistan,    Gave him wealth and wine and food.    Seven hundred and fourscore  Men at arms his livery wore,    Did his bidding night and day,  Now, through regions all unknown,  He was wandering, lost, alone,    Seeking without guide his way.    Suddenly the pathway ends,  Sheer the precipice descends,    Loud the torrent roars unseen;  Thirty feet from side to side  Yawns the chasm; on air must ride    He who crosses this ravine,    Following close in his pursuit,  At the precipice's foot    Reyhan the Arab of Orfah  Halted with his hundred men,  Shouting upward from the glen,    \"La Illah illa Allah!\"    Gently Roushan Beg caressed  Kyrat's forehead, neck, and breast,    Kissed him upon both his eyes;  Sang to him in his wild way,  As upon the topmost spray    Sings a bird before it flies.    \"O my Kyrat, O my steed,  Round and slender as a reed,    Carry me this peril through!  Satin housings shall be thine,  Shoes of gold, O Kyrat mine,    O thou soul of Kurroglou!    \"Soft thy skin as silken skein,  Soft as woman's hair thy mane,    Tender are thine eyes and true;  All thy hoofs like ivory shine,  Polished bright; O life of mine,    Leap, and rescue Kurroglou!\"    Kyrat, then, the strong and fleet,  Drew together his four white feet,    Paused a moment on the verge,  Measured with his eye the space,  And into the air's embrace    Leaped, as leaps the ocean surge.    As the ocean surge o'er sand  Bears a swimmer safe to land,    Kyrat safe his rider bore;  Rattling down the deep abyss,  Fragments of the precipice    Rolled like pebbles on a shore.    Roushan's tasseled cap of red  Trembled not upon his head,    Careless sat he and upright;  Neither hand nor bridle shook,  Nor his head he turned to look,    As he galloped out of sight.    Flash of harness in the air,  Seen a moment like the glare    Of a sword drawn from its sheath;  Thus the phantom horseman passed,  And the shadow that he cast    Leaped the cataract underneath.    Reyhan the Arab held his breath  While this vision of life and death    Passed above him. \"Allahu!\"  Cried he. \"In all Koordistan  Lives there not so brave a man    As this Robber Kurroglou!\"        _Henry W. Longfellow._          Old Ironsides      Ay, tear her tattered ensign down!    Long has it waved on high,  And many an eye has danced to see    That banner in the sky;  Beneath it rung the battle shout,    And burst the cannon's roar;--  The meteor of the ocean air    Shall sweep the clouds no more!    Her deck, once red with heroes' blood,    Where knelt the vanquished foe,  When winds were hurrying o'er the flood,    And waves were white below,  No more shall feel the victor's tread,    Or know the conquered knee;--  The harpies of the shore shall pluck    The eagle of the sea!    Oh, better that her shattered hulk    Should sink beneath the wave!  Her thunders shook the mighty deep,    And there should be her grave;  Nail to the mast her holy flag,    Set every threadbare sail,  And give her to the god of storms,    The lightning and the gale!        _Oliver Wendell Holmes._          A Psalm of Life      Tell me not, in mournful numbers,    \"Life is but an empty dream!\"  For the soul is dead that slumbers,    And things are not what they seem.    Life is real! Life is earnest!    And the grave is not its goal;  \"Dust thou art, to dust returnest,\"    Was not spoken of the soul.    Not enjoyment, and not sorrow,    Is our destined end or way;  But to act that each to-morrow    Finds us farther than to-day.    Art is long, and Time is fleeting,    And our hearts, though stout and brave,  Still, like muffled drums, are beating    Funeral marches to the grave.    In the world's broad field of battle,    In the bivouac of Life,  Be not like dumb, driven cattle!    Be a hero in the strife!    Trust no Future, howe'er pleasant!    Let the dead Past bury its dead!  Act, act in the living Present!    Heart within, and God o'erhead!    Lives of great men all remind us    We can make our lives sublime,  And, departing, leave behind us    Footprints on the sands of time;    Footprints, that perhaps another,    Sailing o'er life's solemn main,  A forlorn and shipwrecked brother,    Seeing, shall take heart again.    Let us, then, be up and doing,    With a heart for any fate;  Still achieving, still pursuing,    Learn to labor and to wait.        _Henry W. Longfellow._          Johnny's Hist'ry Lesson      I think, of all the things at school    A boy has got to do,  That studyin' hist'ry, as a rule,    Is worst of all, don't you?  Of dates there are an awful sight,  An' though I study day an' night,  There's only one I've got just right--    That's fourteen ninety-two.    Columbus crossed the Delaware    In fourteen ninety-two;  We whipped the British, fair an' square,    In fourteen ninety-two.  At Concord an' at Lexington.  We kept the redcoats on the run,  While the band played Johnny Get Your Gun,    In fourteen ninety-two.    Pat Henry, with his dyin' breath--    In fourteen ninety-two--  Said, \"Gimme liberty or death!\"    In fourteen ninety-two.  An' Barbara Frietchie, so 'tis said,  Cried, \"Shoot if you must this old, gray head,  But I'd rather 'twould be your own instead!\"    In fourteen ninety-two.    The Pilgrims came to Plymouth Rock    In fourteen ninety-two,  An' the Indians standin' on the dock    Asked, \"What are you goin' to do?\"  An' they said, \"We seek your harbor drear  That our children's children's children dear  May boast that their forefathers landed here    In fourteen ninety-two.\"    Miss Pocahontas saved the life--    In fourteen ninety-two--  Of John Smith, an' became his wife    In fourteen ninety-two.  An' the Smith tribe started then an' there,  An' now there are John Smiths ev'rywhere,  But they didn't have any Smiths to spare    In fourteen ninety-two.    Kentucky was settled by Daniel Boone    In fourteen ninety-two,  An' I think the cow jumped over the moon    In fourteen ninety-two.  Ben Franklin flew his kite so high  He drew the lightnin' from the sky,  An' Washington couldn't tell a lie,    In fourteen ninety-two.        _Nixon Waterman._          Riding on the Rail      Singing through the forests, rattling over ridges,  Shooting under arches, rumbling over bridges,  Whizzing through the mountains, buzzing o'er the vale,--  Bless me! this is pleasant, riding on the rail!    Men of different stations in the eye of Fame,  Here are very quickly coming to the same;  High and lowly people, birds of every feather,  On a common level, traveling together!    Gentlemen in shorts, blooming very tall;  Gentlemen at large, talking very small;  Gentlemen in tights, with a loosish mien;  Gentlemen in gray, looking very green!    Gentlemen quite old, asking for the news;  Gentlemen in black, with a fit of blues;  Gentlemen in claret, sober as a vicar;  Gentlemen in tweed, dreadfully in liquor!    Stranger on the right looking very sunny,  Obviously reading something very funny.  Now the smiles are thicker--wonder what they mean?  Faith, he's got the Knickerbocker Magazine!    Stranger on the left, closing up his peepers;  Now he snores again, like the Seven Sleepers;  At his feet a volume gives the explanation,  How the man grew stupid from \"association\"!    Ancient maiden lady anxiously remarks  That there must be peril 'mong so many sparks;  Roguish-looking fellow, turning to the stranger,  Says 'tis his opinion _she_ is out of danger!    Woman with her baby, sitting _vis a vis_;  Baby keeps a-squalling, woman looks at me;  Asks about the distance--says 'tis tiresome talking,  Noises of the cars are so very shocking!    Market woman, careful of the precious casket,  Knowing eggs are eggs, tightly holds her basket;  Feeling that a smash, if it came, would surely  Send her eggs to pot rather prematurely.

Humanity with all its fears,  With all the hopes of future years,  Is hanging breathless on thy fate!  We know what Master laid thy keel,  What Workmen wrought thy ribs of steel,  Who made each mast, and sail, and rope,  What anvils rang, what hammers beat,  In what a forge and what a heat  Were shaped the anchors of thy hope!

Some of the others went for a walk as we had no engine on, but I  had been up since 2 A.M., and have hatched another bad cold, and so  retired for a sleep till tea-time.    Just got to Hazebrouck. Ten men and three women were killed and twenty  wounded here this morning by a bomb. They are very keen on getting a  good bag here, especially on the station, and for other reasons, as it  is an important junction.    4 P.M.--We have been up to B. and there were no patients for us, so we  are to go back to the above bomb place to collect theirs. B. was packed  with pale, war-worn, dirty but cheerful French troops entraining for  their Front. They have been all through everything, and say they want to  go on and get it finished. They carry fearful loads, including an extra  pair of boots, a whole collection of frying-pans and things, and  blankets, picks, &c., all on their backs.    The British officers on the station came and grabbed our yesterday's  'Daily Mails,' and asked for soap, so what you sent came in handy. They  went in to the town to buy grapes for us in return. This place is famous  for grapes--huge monster purple ones--but the train went out before they  came back. We had got some earlier, though.    9 P.M.--We are nearly back at Boulogne and haven't taken up any sick or  wounded anywhere. One of the trains has taken Indians from Boulogne  down to Marseilles--several days' journey.      _Monday, December 7th._--Pouring wet day. Still standing by; nothing  doing anywhere. It is a blessed relief to know that, and the rest does  no one any harm. Had a grand mail to-day.    There is a heart-breaking account of my beautiful Ypres on page 8 of  December 1st 'Times.' There was a cavalry officer looking round the  Cathedral with me that day the guns were banging. I often wonder where  the Belgian woman is who showed me the way and wanted my S.A. ribbons as  a souvenir. She showed me a huge old painting on the wall of the  Cathedral of Ypres in an earlier war.    I all but got left in Boulogne to-day. We are dry-docked about five  miles out, not far from Ambleteuse.    It was bad luck not seeing the King. We caught him up at St Omer, and  saw his train; and from there he motored in front of us to all our  places. Where we went, they said, \"The King was here yesterday and gave  V.C.'s.\" We haven't seen the \"d--d good boy\" either.      _Tuesday, December 8th._--Got up to Bailleul by 11 A.M., and had a good  walk on the line waiting to load up. Glorious morning. Aeroplanes  buzzing overhead like bees, and dropping coloured signals about. Only  filled up my half of the train, both wounded and sick, including some  very bad enterics. An officer in the trenches sent a man on a horse to  get some papers from us. Luckily I had a batch of 'The Times,'  'Spectator,' and 'Punches.'    We have come down very quickly, and hope to unload to-night, 9.30.      _Wednesday, December 9th._--In siding at Boulogne all day. Pouring wet.      _Thursday, December 10th._--Left for Bailleul at 8 A.M. Heard at St Omer  of the sinking of the three German cruisers.    Arrived at 2 P.M. Loaded up in the rain, wounded and sick--full load.  They were men wounded last night, very muddy and trenchy; said the train  was like heaven! It is lovely fun taking the sweets round; they are such  an unexpected treat. The sitting-ups make many jokes, and say \"they  serve round 'arder sweets than this in the firing line--more explosive  like.\"    One showed us a fearsome piece of shell which killed his chum next to  him last night. There is a good deal of dysentery about, and acute  rheumatism. The Clearing Hospitals are getting rather rushed again, and  the men say we shall have a lot coming down in the next few days. A  hundred men of one regiment got separated from their supports and came  up against some German machine-guns in a wood with tragic results. We  are shelling from Ypres, but there is no answering shelling going on  just now, though the Taubes are busy.    We are wondering what the next railhead will be, and when. Some charming  H.A.C.'s are on the train this time, and a typically plucky lot of  Tommies. One of the best of their many best features is their unfailing  friendliness with each other. They never let you miss a man out with  sweets or anything if he happens to be asleep or absent.      _Friday, December 11th._--They wouldn't unload us at 11 P.M. at Boulogne  last night, but sent us on to the Duchess of Westminster's Hospital at a  little place about twenty miles south of B., and we didn't unload till  this morning. It was my turn for a whole night in bed. Not that this  means we are having many nights up, but that when the load doesn't  require two Sisters at night, two go to bed and the other two divide the  night. After unloading we had a poke round the little fishing village,  and of course the church. A company of Canadian Red Cross people  unloaded us. The hospital has not been open very long. It was all  sand-dunes and fir-trees on the way, very attractive, and cement  factories.    Mail in again.    9 P.M.--We came back to B. to fill up with stores after lunch, and  haven't been sent out again yet; but we often go to bed here, and wake  up and ask our soldier servants (batmen), who bring our jugs of hot  water it the morning, where we are. I like the motion of the train in  bed now, and you get used to the noise.      _Saturday, December 12th._--The French engine-drivers are so erratic  that if you're long enough on the line it's only a question of time when  you get your smash up. Ours came last night when they were joining us up  to go out again. They put an engine on to each end of one-half of the  train (not the one our car is in), and then did a tug-of-war. That  wasn't a success, so they did the concertina touch, and put three  coaches out of action, including the kitchen. So we're stuck here now  (Boulogne) till Heaven knows when. Fortunately no casualties.      _Sunday, December 13th._--We've been hung up since Friday night by the  three damaged trucks, and took the opportunity of getting some good  walks yesterday, and actually going to church at the English church this  morning.    Sister B. has been ordered to join the hospital; she mobilised to-day,  and we had to pack her off this morning. The staffs of the trains (which  have all been shortened) have been put down from four to three. Very  glad I wasn't taken off.    We saw a line of graves with wooden crosses, in a field against the  skyline, last journey.    We have seen a lot of the skin coats that the men are getting now.  Sheepskin, with any sort of fur or skin sleeves, just the skins sewn  together; you may see a grey or white coat with brown or black fur or  astrakhan sleeves. Some wear the fur inside and some outside; they  simply love them.    Reduced to pacing the platform in the dark and rain to get warm. It is  368 paces, so I've done it six times to well cover a mile, but it is not  an exciting walk! Funny thing, it seems in this war that for many  departments you are either thoroughly overworked or entirely hung up,  which is much worse. In things like the Pay Department or the  Post-Office or the Provisioning for the A.S.C. it seldom gets off the  overworked line, but in this and in the fighting line it varies very  much.         \"The number of victims of the Taube attack on Hazebrouck on Monday       is larger than was at first supposed. Five bombs were thrown and       nine British soldiers and five civilians were killed, while 25       persons were injured.\"--'Times,' Dec. 9th.    We were at H. on that day.      _Monday, December 14th._--Got off at last at 3.30 A.M. Loaded up 300 at  Merville, a place we've only been to once before, near the coalmines.  Guns were banging only four miles off.    Had a good many bad cases, medical and surgical, this time: kept one  busy to the journey's end. We are unloaded to-night, so they will soon  be well seen to, instead of going down to Rouen or Havre, which two  other trains just in have got to do.    We have a good many Gordons on; one was hugging his bagpipes, and we had  him up after dinner to play, which he did beautifully with a wrapt  expression.    We are going up again to-night. \"Three trains wanted immediately\"--been  expecting that.      _Tuesday, December 15th._--We were unloaded last night at 9.30, and  reported ready to go up again at 11 P.M., but they didn't move us till 5  A.M. Went to same place as yesterday, and cleared the Clearing Hospitals  again; some badly wounded, with wounds exposed and splints padded with  straw as in the Ypres days.    The Black Watch have got some cherub-faced boys of seventeen out now.  The mud and floods are appalling. The Scotch regiments have lost their  shoes and spats and wade barefoot in the water-logged trenches. This is  a true fact.    I'm afraid not a few of many regiments have got rheumatism--some  acute--that they will never lose.    The ploughed fields and roads are all more or less under water, and each  day it rains more.    We have got a Red Cross doctor on the train who was in the next village  to the one we loaded from this morning. It has been taken and retaken by  both sides, and had a population of about 2000. The only living things  he saw in it to-day besides a khaki supply column passing through were  one cat and some goldfish. In one villa a big brass bedstead was hanging  through the drawing-room ceiling by its legs, the clothes hanging in the  cupboards were slashed up, and nothing left anywhere. He says at least  ten well-to-do men of 50 are doing motor-ambulance work with their own  Rolls-Royces up there, and cleaning their cars themselves, at 6 A.M.    I happened to ask a man, who is a stretcher-bearer belonging to the  Rifle Brigade, how he got hit. \"Oh, I was carrying a dead man,\" he said  modestly. \"My"]]]
