Raf slacked speed, waiting for the globe to  point a way to a landing.    But to his surprise the alien ship shot forward inland. The long day  was almost over as they came to a second city with a river knotting a  ribbon through its middle. Here were no traces of the fury which had  laded the seaport with havoc. This collection of buildings seemed  whole and perfect.    There was, oddly enough, no landing strip within the city. The globe  coasted over the rough oval and came down in open fields to the west.  It was a maneuver which Raf copied, though he first dropped a flare as  a precaution and brought the flier down in its red glare, with the  warrior expressing shrill disapproval.    \"I don't think they like fireworks,\" Soriki remarked.    Raf snorted. \"So they don't like fireworks! Well, I don't like  crack-ups, and I'm the pilot!\" But he didn't believe that the com-tech  was really protesting. Soriki had been very quiet since they had  witnessed the attack on the island.    \"Grim-looking place,\" was his second comment as they touched ground.    Since Raf privately had held that opinion of all the alien settlements  he had so far seen, he agreed. Their two alien passengers were out of  the flitter as soon as he opened the bubble shield. And as they stood  by the Terran flyer, they held their weapons ready, facing out into  the dusk as if they half expected trouble. After the earlier episode  that day, Raf did not wonder at their preparedness. Terror begets  terror, and ruthlessness arouses retaliation in kind.    \"Kurbi! Soriki!\" Hobart's voice sounded out of the shadows. \"Stay  where you are for the present.\"    Soriki settled deeper in his seat. \"He doesn't have to tell me to  brake jets,\" he muttered. \"I like it here--\"    Raf did not need to echo that. He had a strong surmise that had he  been tempted to roam away from the flitter the move would not have  been encouraged by the alien guardsmen. If this was their treasure  city, they would not welcome any independent investigation by  strangers.    When the captain joined them, he was accompanied by the officer who  had first shown Raf the globe. And the warrior was either disturbed or  angry, for he was talking in a steady stream and his hands were  whirling in explanatory gestures.    \"They didn't like that flare,\" Hobart remarked. But there was no  reproof in his words. As a spacer pilot he knew that Raf had only done  what duty demanded. \"We're to remain here--for the night.\"    \"Where's Lablet?\" Soriki wanted to know.    \"He's staying with Yussoz, the alien commander. He thinks he has the  language problem about solved.\"    \"Good enough.\" Soriki pulled out his bed roll. \"We're out of touch  with the ship--\"    There was a second of silence, unduly prolonged it seemed to Raf. Then  Hobart spoke:    \"We couldn't expect to keep in call forever. The best com has its  range. When did you lose contact?\"    \"Just before these wrapped-up heroes played with fire back there. I  gave the boys all I knew up until then. They know we were headed west,  and they had us beamed as long as they could.\"    So it wasn't too bad, thought Raf. But he didn't like it, even with  that mitigating factor. To all purposes the four Terrans were now  surrounded by some twenty times their number, in an unknown country,  out of all communication with the rest of their kind. It could add up  to disaster.          9    SEA GATE      \"What is it?\" Dalgard asked his question as Sssuri, his attention still  on their back trail, stole along cautiously on a retracing of their  path.    But that retreat ended abruptly with the merman plastered against the  wall, his whole shadowy form a tense warning which stopped Dalgard  short. In that moment the answer flashed from mind to mind.    \"There are those which follow--\"    \"Snake-devils? Those Others?\" The colony scout supplied the only two  explanations he had, sending his own thought out questing. But as  usual he could not hope to equal the more sensitive merman whose race  had always used that form of communication.    \"Those who have long haunted the darkness,\" was the only reply he  could get.    But Sssuri's actions were far more indicative of danger. For the  merman turned and caught at Dalgard, pulling the larger colonist along  a step or two with the urgency of his grip.    \"We cannot return this way--and we must travel fast!\"    For Sssuri who would face and had faced up to a snake-devil with a  spear his sole weapon, this timidity was new. Dalgard was wise enough  to accept his verdict of the wisdom of flight. Together they ran along  the underground corridor, soon putting a mile between them and the  point where the merman had first taken alarm.    \"From what do we flee?\" As the merman began to slacken pace, Dalgard  sent that query.    \"There are those who live in this darkness. By one, or by two, we  could speedily remove them from life. But they hunt in packs and they  are as greedy for the kill as are the snake-devils scenting meat. Also  they are intelligent. Once, long before the days of burning, they  served Those Others as hunters of game. And Those Others tried to make  them ever more intelligent and crafty so they might be sent to hunt  without a huntsman. At last they grew too knowing for their masters.  Then Those Others, realizing their menace, tried to kill them all with  traps and tricks. But only the most stupid and the slowest were so  disposed of. The others withdrew into underground ways such as this,  venturing forth only in the dark of night.\"    \"But if they are intelligent,\" countered the scout, \"why can they not  be reached by the mind touch?\"    \"Through the years they have developed their own ways of thought. And  these are not the simple creatures of the sun, or such as the runners.  Once they were taught to answer only to Those Others. Now they answer  only to each other. But\"--he spread out his hands in one of his quick,  nervous gestures--\"to those who are cornered by one of their packs,  they are sudden death!\"    Since they could not, by Sssuri's reckoning, turn back, there was only  one course before them, to follow the passage they had chanced upon.  The merman was certain that it underran the river and that eventually  they would reach the sea--unless some side turn before that point  would make them free in the countryside once more.    Dalgard doubted if it had ever been a well-used way. And the presence  of earth falls here and there, over which they stumbled and clawed  their way, led him to consider the wisdom of keeping on to what might  be a dead end. But his trust in Sssuri's judgment was great, and as  the merman plowed forward with every appearance of confidence, he  continued to trot along without complaint.    They snatched moments of rest, taking turns at guard. But the walls  about them were so unchanging that it was hard to measure time or  distance. Dalgard chewed at his emergency rations, a block of dried  meat and fruit pounded together to an almost rocklike consistency, and  tried to make the crumbs he sucked loose satisfy his growing hunger.    The passageway was growing damper; water trickled down the walls and  gathered in fetid pools on the floor. Dalgard's dislike of the place  grew. His shoulders hunched involuntarily as he strode along, for his  imagination pictured the rock above them giving away to dump tons of  the oily river water down to engulf them. But though Sssuri avoided  splashing through the pools wherever he might, he did not appear to  find anything upsetting about the moisture.    At last the human could stand it no longer. \"How much farther to the  sea?\" he asked without any hope of a real answer.    As he had expected him to do, Sssuri shrugged. \"We should be close.  But having never trod this way before, how can I tell you?\"    Once more they rested, choosing a stretch which was reasonably dry,  munching their dried food and drinking sparingly from the stoppered  duocorn horns which swung from their belts. A man would have to be  dying of thirst, Dalgard thought, before he would palm up any of the  stagnant water from the passage pools.    He drifted off into a troubled sleep in which he fled beneath a sky  which was a giant lid in the hand of an unseen enemy, a lid which was  slowly lowered to crush him flat. He awoke with a start to find  Sssuri's cool, scaled fingers stroking his shoulder.    \"Dream demons walk these roads.\" The words drifted into his half-awake  mind.    \"They do indeed,\" he roused to answer.    \"It is always so where Those Others have been. They leave behind them  the thoughts which breed such dreams to trouble the sleep of those who  are not of their kind. Let us go. I would like to be out of this place  under the clean sky, where no ancient wickedness hangs to poison the  air and thought.\"    Either the merman had miscalculated the direction of their route or  the river mouth was much farther from the inland city than they had  believed, for, though they pushed on for what seemed like weary hours,  they came to no upward slope, no exit to the world they knew.    Instead Dalgard began to realize that just the opposite was true. At  last he could stand it no longer and broke out with what he feared,  hoping that Sssuri would deny that fear.    \"We are going downhill!\"    To his disappointment the merman agreed. \"It has been so for the last  thousand of our paces. It is my belief that this leads not to the sun  but out under the sea.\"    Dalgard missed a step. To Sssuri the sea was home and perhaps the  thought of being under its floor was not disturbing. The land-born  human was not so prepared. If he had experienced discomfort under the  river, what would it be like under the ocean? His terrifying dream of  a lid being pressed down upon him flashed back into his mind. But his  companion was continuing:    \"There will be doors, perhaps into the sea itself.\"    "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/18464"],[0,"The Wit and Humor of America, Volume I. (of X.) (#16)"],[1,"fruit grown in the soft  atmosphere of those back courts.    It was in this quarter, then, that we heard of Mrs. Johnson; and it was  from a colored boarding-house there that she came out to Charlesbridge  to look at us, bringing her daughter of twelve years with her. She was a  matron of mature age and portly figure, with a complexion like coffee  soothed with the richest cream; and her manners were so full of a  certain tranquillity and grace, that she charmed away all our will to  ask for references. It was only her barbaric laughter and lawless eye  that betrayed how slightly her New England birth and breeding covered  her ancestral traits, and bridged the gulf of a thousand years of  civilization that lay between her race and ours. But in fact, she was  doubly estranged by descent; for, as we learned later, a sylvan wildness  mixed with that of the desert in her veins: her grandfather was an  Indian, and her ancestors on this side had probably sold their lands for  the same value in trinkets that bought the original African pair on the  other side.    The first day that Mrs. Johnson descended into our kitchen, she conjured  from the malicious disorder in which it had been left by the flitting  Irish kobold a dinner that revealed the inspirations of genius, and was  quite different from a dinner of mere routine and laborious talent.  Something original and authentic mingled with the accustomed flavors;  and, though vague reminiscences of canal-boat travel and woodland camps  arose from the relish of certain of the dishes, there was yet the  assurance of such power in the preparation of the whole, that we knew  her to be merely running over the chords of our appetite with  preliminary savors, as a musician acquaints his touch with the keys of  an unfamiliar piano before breaking into brilliant and triumphant  execution. Within a week she had mastered her instrument; and thereafter  there was no faltering in her performances, which she varied constantly,  through inspiration or from suggestion.... But, after all, it was in  puddings that Mrs. Johnson chiefly excelled. She was one of those  cooks--rare as men of genius in literature--who love their own dishes;  and she had, in her personally child-like simplicity of taste, and the  inherited appetites of her savage forefathers, a dominant passion for  sweets. So far as we could learn, she subsisted principally upon  puddings and tea. Through the same primitive instincts, no doubt, she  loved praise. She openly exulted in our artless flatteries of her skill;  she waited jealously at the head of the kitchen stairs to hear what was  said of her work, especially if there were guests; and she was never too  weary to attempt emprises of cookery.    While engaged in these, she wore a species of sightly handkerchief like  a turban upon her head, and about her person those mystical swathings in  which old ladies of the African race delight. But she most pleasured our  sense of beauty and moral fitness when, after the last pan was washed  and the last pot was scraped, she lighted a potent pipe, and, taking her  stand at the kitchen door, laded the soft evening air with its pungent  odors. If we surprised her at these supreme moments, she took the pipe  from her lips, and put it behind her, with a low, mellow chuckle, and a  look of half-defiant consciousness; never guessing that none of her  merits took us half so much as the cheerful vice which she only feigned  to conceal.    Some things she could not do so perfectly as cooking because of her  failing eyesight, and we persuaded her that spectacles would both become  and befriend a lady of her years, and so bought her a pair of  steel-bowed glasses. She wore them in some great emergencies at first,  but had clearly no pride in them. Before long she laid them aside  altogether, and they had passed from our thoughts, when one day we heard  her mellow note of laughter and her daughter's harsher cackle outside  our door, and, opening it, beheld Mrs. Johnson in gold-bowed spectacles  of massive frame. We then learned that their purchase was in fulfilment  of a vow made long ago, in the life-time of Mr. Johnson, that, if ever  she wore glasses, they should be gold-bowed; and I hope the manes of the  dead were half as happy in these votive spectacles as the simple soul  that offered them.    She and her late partner were the parents of eleven children, some of  whom were dead, and some of whom were wanderers in unknown parts. During  his life-time she had kept a little shop in her native town; and it was  only within a few years that she had gone into service. She cherished a  natural haughtiness of spirit, and resented control, although disposed  to do all she could of her own notion. Being told to say when she wanted  an afternoon, she explained that when she wanted an afternoon she always  took it without asking, but always planned so as not to discommode the  ladies with whom she lived. These, she said, had numbered twenty-seven  within three years, which made us doubt the success of her system in all  cases, though she merely held out the fact as an assurance of her faith  in the future, and a proof of the ease with which places are to be  found. She contended, moreover, that a lady who had for thirty years had  a house of her own, was in nowise bound to ask permission to receive  visits from friends where she might be living, but that they ought  freely to come and go like other guests. In this spirit she once invited  her son-in-law, Professor Jones of Providence, to dine with her; and her  defied mistress, on entering the dining-room, found the Professor at  pudding and tea there,--an impressively respectable figure in black  clothes, with a black face rendered yet more effective by a pair of  green goggles. It appeared that this dark professor was a light of  phrenology in Rhode Island, and that he was believed to have uncommon  virtue in his science by reason of being blind as well as black.    I am loath to confess that Mrs. Johnson had not a flattering opinion of  the Caucasian race in all respects. In fact, she had very good  philosophical and Scriptural reasons for looking upon us as an upstart  people of new blood, who had come into their whiteness by no creditable  or pleasant process. The late Mr. Johnson, who had died in the West  Indies, whither he voyaged for his health in quality of cook upon a  Down-East schooner, was a man of letters, and had written a book to show  the superiority of the black over the white branches of the human  family. In this he held that, as all islands have been at their  discovery found peopled by blacks, we must needs believe that humanity  was first created of that color. Mrs. Johnson could not show us her  husband's work (a sole copy in the library of an English gentleman at  Port au Prince is not to be bought for money), but she often developed  its arguments to the lady of the house; and one day, with a great show  of reluctance, and many protests that no personal slight was meant,  let fall the fact that Mr. Johnson believed the white race descended  from Gehaz, the leper, upon whom the leprosy of Naaman fell when the  latter returned by Divine favor to his original blackness. \"And he  went out from his presence a leper as white as snow,\" said Mrs.  Johnson, quoting irrefutable Scripture. \"Leprosy, leprosy,\" she  added thoughtfully,--\"nothing but leprosy bleached you out.\"    It seems to me much in her praise that she did not exult in our taint  and degradation, as some white philosophers used to do in the opposite  idea that a part of the human family were cursed to lasting blackness  and slavery in Ham and his children, but even told us of a remarkable  approach to whiteness in many of her own offspring. In a kindred spirit  of charity, no doubt, she refused ever to attend church with people of  her elder and wholesomer blood. When she went to church, she said, she  always went to a white church, though while with us I am bound to say  she never went to any. She professed to read her Bible in her bedroom  on Sundays; but we suspected, from certain sounds and odors which used  to steal out of this sanctuary, that her piety more commonly found  expression in dozing and smoking.    I would not make a wanton jest here of Mrs. Johnson's anxiety to claim  honor for the African color, while denying this color in many of her own  family. It afforded a glimpse of the pain which all her people must  endure, however proudly they hide it or light-heartedly forget it, from  the despite and contumely to which they are guiltlessly born; and when I  thought how irreparable was this disgrace and calamity of a black skin,  and how irreparable it must be for ages yet, in this world where every  other shame and all manner of wilful guilt and wickedness may hope for  covert and pardon, I had little heart to laugh. Indeed, it was so  pathetic to hear this poor old soul talk of her dead and lost ones, and  try, in spite of all Mr. Johnson's theories and her own arrogant  generalizations, to establish their whiteness, that we must have been  very cruel and silly people to turn her sacred fables even into matter  of question. I have no doubt that her Antoinette Anastasia and her  Thomas Jefferson Wilberforce--it is impossible to give a full idea of  the splendor and scope of the baptismal names in Mrs. Johnson's  family--have as light skins and as golden hair in heaven as her reverend  maternal fancy painted for them in our world. There, certainly, they  would not be subject to tanning, which had ruined the delicate  complexion, and had knotted into black woolly tangles the once wavy  blonde locks of our little maid-servant Naomi; and I would fain believe  that Toussaint Washington Johnson, who ran away to sea so many years  ago, has found some fortunate zone where his hair and skin keep the same  sunny and rosy tints they wore to his mother's eyes in infancy.
