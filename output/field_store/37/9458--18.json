Then he went  back to his room and slammed the door hard enough to burst it off its  hinges.\"    \"Do you suppose he reported the matter to Colonel Colby?\" had been  Fred's question.    \"I don't know about that. You see, when a fellow gets as mad as Martell  was he's liable to do almost anything.\" And that was all Bart White had  had to relate concerning the affair.    So far, the Rover boys had not had anything to do with Asa Lemm. They  had met the sharp-faced professor once in the hallway and he had stared  at them in a fashion which made Andy shiver.    \"He's got it in for me all right!\" had been the declaration of the  fun-loving youth.    \"I guess Gif was right,\" had been Jack's comment. \"He'll have it in for  us the whole term. Too bad! I'd rather be friendly with every one than  have any enemies.\"    The Rover boys were just leaving the boathouse after having admired the  beautiful four- and eight-oared shells stored there, when they saw  Fatty Hendry coming towards them as rapidly as his stoutness permitted.    \"Say! I've got something to tell you fellows,\" puffed the fat boy as he  came closer. \"I just saw that sneak of a Codfish coming from Fred's  room. He looked awful sneakish, and I'm sure he was up to no good.\"    \"I'll go up to my room at once and see,\" answered the youngest Rover,  and lost no time in speeding back to the Hall.    He bounded up the stairs two steps at a time. But when he reached the  room he occupied, a surprise awaited him. Everything was exactly as he  had left it. It may be as well to state here that every cadet at Colby  Hall was required to keep his room in absolute order, and a monitor  came around twice a day to see that this regulation was carried out. If  a pupil was lax in any particular regarding his room, he was given a  demerit in consequence thereof.    \"Well, thank goodness! he didn't upset anything, even if he was here,\"  murmured Fred to himself. \"I wonder what the little imp was up to?\"  Then a sudden thought struck him and he walked to the clothes closet in  the bottom of which he had deposited his suitcase. He found the bag in  the closet, but it was placed there in such a way that he was sure it  had been handled.    \"Well, what have you found?\" questioned Andy, who had followed his  cousin to the room.    \"I think I know why he came here,\" declared Fred. \"More than likely  Martell sent him here to find out whether I really had the suitcase or  not. The bag I know has been handled. When I placed it in the closet I  put the open end of the straps against the wall. Now the open ends are  on this side.\"    \"Say! you're some detective, Fred!\"    \"I know how I left the bag. And he certainly had it out of the closet  and put it back.\"    \"See if he did anything to it,\" went on Andy, quickly; and thereupon  Fred brought the bag forth and examined it. It was empty, just as he  had left it.    \"Well, that will take the worry of the missing bag from Martell's  mind,\" was Fred's comment, as he and Andy left the room, this time  locking the door.    \"Martell must have had some kind of a clue to the truth or he wouldn't  have sent Codfish here,\" was Andy's comment. \"Maybe he got on to what  part Walt Baxter and Ned Lowe played in the trick.\" And in this surmise  Andy was correct. By the merest accident Codfish had overheard Walt and  Ned speaking about the joke, and at once he had gone to Nappy with the  news; and the upshot had been that Nappy had sent the sneak to Fred's  room to learn if the suitcase with Fred's initials upon it was there.    Late that afternoon both the old and the new cadets were assigned to  their places in the various classrooms and also given the text-books  which they were to study during the term.    \"This begins to look like work,\" sighed Randy.    \"Well, we didn't come here just for the fun of it,\" declared Jack. \"We  came here, if you'll remember, to get an education.\"    \"Oh, I'm not going to complain,\" returned his cousin quickly. \"I'm  willing to do my share of studying. But after the splendid vacation we  had this Summer it will be a little tough at the beginning to get down  to the grind.\"    \"That's just what I was thinking,\" declared Andy. \"I wish a fellow  didn't have to study. Why can't some of our great inventors invent some  kind of knowledge pill so a fellow can just go and buy a few boxes and  then take them regularly?\"    \"Great idea, Andy!\" exclaimed his twin merrily.    By the next morning all of the cadets had arrived, and also all of the  teachers and the other persons connected with Colby Hall. Then the  cadets were assembled on the parade ground and made to march into the  general assembly room of the institution, where Colonel Colby addressed  them. He spoke about the good work done by the cadets during the former  term at the school, and said he trusted that the present term would  turn out still better.    \"At present all of our old officers of the battalion will hold over,\"  he announced. \"But in the near future--just as soon as we have got  settled in our classes--I will announce the time for a new election.  The major and the two captains to be elected must be in their senior  year at this institution. The other officers may be either sophomores  or juniors.\"    \"That lets us out,\" whispered Andy to Jack. \"Evidently no freshmen can  be officers.\"    \"Well, why should we be officers?\" answered his cousin. \"We hardly know  a thing about soldiering yet. I think Colonel Colby's rule is a very  good one.\"    During the meeting in the assembly room all of the professors were  called on to say a few words to the cadets. The addresses delivered by  Professors Grawson and Brice and one or two of the other teachers were  well received; but it was plainly evident that when Asa Lemm came  forward to speak to the boys there was a distinctly cold feeling  towards him.    \"I want to speak about attention to work,\" he said in a severe tone of  voice. \"During the last term at this school there was not that  attention in classes that I desire. From now on I expect every one who  comes to me to pay strict attention at all times. Any laxity will be  severely punished.\"    \"Gosh! He's a cheerful customer!\" was Fred's comment.    \"He'd make a fellow down on him almost before the term began,\" was  another cadet's comment.    \"I don't wonder they call him old Lemon,\" added another youth.    \"And now we're all ready to go to work,\" said Jack, after the cadets  had been dismissed. On the following day the classes were to begin.    There had been so much bustle and confusion throughout the school that  day that Fred, who was not feeling extra well, got quite a headache.    \"You had better lie down for a while and rest,\" said Jack, kindly. \"You  don't want to get sick.\"    \"Oh, it's only a headache, and I'll soon be over it,\" declared Fred. \"I  think I'll go out for a quiet walk along the river.\"    \"Do you want me to go along?\"    \"No. I'd just as lief go alone, Jack. I think the quietness will do me  more good than anything.\"    This mood was not a new one with the youngest Rover, so Jack said no  more, and a few minutes later Fred slipped on his heavy sweater and  donned his cap and set out for his walk. His steps took him towards the  boathouse and the bathing houses, and then he continued on along a path  running close to the shore of the river.    Although the youngest Rover did not know it, his departure had been  watched by Codfish. The small boy lost no time in hurrying to Nappy  Martell and Slugger Brown with his information.    \"You're sure he's alone?\" asked Nappy, quickly.    \"Yes. Nobody went out with him.\"    \"Then that's our chance, Slugger,\" went on the boy from New York. \"Come  ahead, if you want to help me.\"    \"All right, Nap. But I thought you said you could polish him off  alone?\"    \"So I can. But I thought you'd like to see the fun.\"    \"Can't I go along too?\" put in Codfish.    \"Yes, if you'll promise to keep your mouth shut about it.\"    \"Oh, I won't say a word,\" returned the little cadet, quickly.    Putting on their hats and coats, the three cadets lost no time in  following Fred. It was quite dark on the campus and parade ground, but  they soon caught sight of the figure ahead as the youngest Rover moved  past the bathhouses to the river path beyond.    \"He's alone all right enough,\" was Slugger Brown's comment.    \"I thought I'd catch him sooner or later after I set Codfish to  watching him,\" answered Nappy Martell. \"Now I guess I'll be able to  teach him to play tricks on me,\" he added sourly.    The three cadets quickened their pace, and in a moment more caught up  to Fred just as he reached a point on the river shore almost out of  sight of the Hall. Fred had dipped his handkerchief in the water and  used the same for wiping off his aching brow.    \"See here, Rover, I want to talk to you!\" cried Nappy Martell, and,  striding forward, he caught Fred roughly by the arm.    Of course, the youngest Rover was startled, not dreaming that anyone  was following him. Yet he showed no signs of fear.    \"What do you want of me, Martell?\" he asked quietly.    \"I'll show you what I want of you!\" cried Nappy Martell in sudden  wrath. \"I'll teach you to play tricks on me! Try to make me believe  your suitcase was stolen, will you? And then come to my room and  rough-house things, eh? Just wait till I get through with you and  you'll wish you'd never been born!\"          CHAPTER XIV    THE FIGHT      Fred Rover realized that he was in an unenviable situation. Nappy  Martell was thoroughly angry, and evidently Slugger Brown and Codfish  were present to aid him in anything he might undertake to do.    Many another boy might have thought discretion the better part of valor  and taken to his heels. But the youngest Rover was not built that way.  He had been taught to stick up"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/21899"],[0,"A Rip Van Winkle Of The Kalahari (#16)"],[1," beauty alone, and the long stagnant blood coursed  through my veins as I gazed entranced, and for ever enthralled.    No thought of that woman who waited crossed my mind, nothing but mad  desire and adoration filled me for this creature of unearthly beauty;  and spirit, woman, devil, be she what she might, my one mad longing was  to gaze upon her, to worship her, to possess her for ever.    And as I gazed spellbound she spoke again.    \"Nay, I see thou wilt never forget,\" she smiled gravely, \"yet must thou  eat of the fruit that will bring forgetfulness of all other things.\"    She called to the priest in another tongue; and one came scowlingly,  bringing with him a small box of ebony. The priestess took something  from it, and again turned her piercing eyes upon my own, compelling,  commanding, dominating me, as she had done when I first opened my eyes.  I tried to speak to beg, to implore, that I might remain her slave, if  need be, but near her, but she had put a spell upon my tongue, and I  could not.    Slowly she held forth her hand, and in the palm I now saw a small  withered berry, black and shriveled, but in shape like the scarlet  berries I had eaten so often in the crater. \"Eat and forget! . . . Eat  and forget!\" the voice commanded; and now the eyes sought mine again  and fascinated and mastered me.    No! I would not eat. ... I would not go! and with all my strength I  opposed her will . . . this was poison surely ... I would not eat!    \"I seek not thy life rather would I save it,\" came the warning, as I  struggled against the domination, \"I have but to hold forth my hand to  these my servants, and they would tear thee limb from limb. See, then!\"    A gesture, and the crowd of frowning priests sprang up the steps and  swarmed round me; their fierce, vulpine faces aglow with terrible joy,  their long talon-like nails outstretched to rend me fearful horrifying!    At a word, and just as they had almost reached me, the priestess stayed  them; but now their hot breath beat close upon me, and in deadly fear I  stretched out my hand and took the berry. \"Eat eat, and be safe, no  harm shall come thee eat and forget eat and forget!\" and with the  clarion accents ringing in my ears, and with those unfathomable eyes  gazing steadily into my own, I crushed the berry between my teeth and  swallowed it. A strange, acrid taste, similar but vastly stronger than  the berries I had eaten before . . . a rush of blood to my head, a  tingling through all my veins, and then a blackness surging up and  hiding all, even blotting out the star-like eyes before me, till all,  all was black.    An endless dream of wanderings in thick pathless forests, an endless  search for something lost: an eternity of vague formless dreams.  Searching searching, and finding nothing: an infinite sorrow for  something I could never again find.    Eyes gleaming at me from the dark forest; a myriad eyes, coming and  going in the vague shadows, and a voice calling; something I could not  understand; and through all, the sorrow for something precious, lost  beyond recall.        CHAPTER IX        FORTY YEARS! THE AWAKENING     And then voices in my own tongue, low voices in the tongue I had not  heard for so long; and kind English faces coming and going beside my  bed, and mingling with my dreams.    And there came a time when I awoke to full sanity again, a time when  dreams no longer blended with reality.    I lay in a cool, green-shuttered room, and beside me sat a pleasant-  faced man, dressed in white, who was looking at me intently, and who  nodded vigorously as I looked back at him.    \"Better, eh?\" he asked \"There, don't speak. I can see you are. Take  this, and go to sleep; you have had a bad time, and must get stronger  before you talk.\"    And strong I got rapidly, and in a few days he told me where I was, and  how I came there.    He was the British Consul at Loanda in Portuguese West Africa, and one  morning about two months before, some natives had brought me in to him  slung in a machilla.    They said they had been paid to bring me in, and that I was sick, and  before he had had time to question them closely they had disappeared,  without anyone finding out where they came from.    Sick and delirious, the Consul had been on the point of sending me to  the Portuguese hospital, when a few words in English caught his  attention, and feeling that he could not leave a fellow-countryman to  the mercy of strangers and foreigners in such a plight, he had seen me  through the stiff bout of brain fever in his own house.    As he told me all this, I decided to tell him all in return; for I now  remembered all that had happened up to the time I had swallowed the  berry; though after that it seemed nothing but a dream.    And first I asked him if the natives had brought anything with me.  \"Nothing whatever,\" he replied, \"except a small skin bag of stones!\"    He had not opened it, nor did I need to then, for the feel was enough.  And it had been no dream then the crater, the deluge, the priestess,  and the promise she gave me.    Quietly, and as briefly as I could, I told him my story. Half way  through it he stopped me. \"Look here,\" he said, \"you mustn't go on like  this. You are wandering again!\" and though I assured him I was not, he  felt my pulse and took my temperature. Then he let me go on again, and  though he looked puzzled and uneasy he listened till I was finished.  And then, looking at his pained and startled expression, I could see  that he believed I was lying or mad.    And then and then only I opened the bag. And the diamonds were there  enough to make a dozen men rich many more than the few blue ones I had  with me when I first escaped.    And never was a man more astounded than the Consul; again and again he  made me repeat my story, and at last, in considerable agitation, he got  up and walked to the window, where he stood looking out in silence for  some time.    Then he came back to the bed where I lay, and looked searchingly at me  again.    \"You are a young man,\" he said slowly; \"to all appearance you are a  young, strong man in spite of your scarred face and your bent spine,  you look a young man! Now how long were you there in that pit how long  do you think has passed since your terrible experience with the Snake?\"    \"It all seems like a dream,\" I answered him, \"and I cannot tell. But I  must have been several months in the crater perhaps a year. Since then  I cannot have wandered long.\"    \"Well, then,\" he questioned, \"what month and year was it that you went  to Walfisch Bay, and found Inyati?\"    \"In 1860,\" I said; \"I landed there in November, 1860. What is it now?\"    \"Good God, man,\" he exclaimed, \"you must be mistaken. Are you sure it  was 1860?\"    \"Sure,\" I repeated, \"November, 1860; and it was some time in the  following May that I lost Inyati May, 1861. Last year, was it?\"    \"Last year! Last year!\" he repeated as though dazed in fact I could see  that he was absolutely frightened. \"Why man, what you tell me is  incredible impossible! If it were true, you have slept for nearly forty  years. For it is now 1900.\"    And now it was my turn to be amazed, for truly what he had told me was  incredible . . . surely he must be mad himself!    But he went to the door and called the little Portuguese doctor, who  had also been kindness itself to me.    \"Aha,\" he said as he looked me over and felt my pulse, \"now you are  well and have sense again, eh? That is good, it is good that you are  strong very strong never have I see so strong a man never! And if you  have not been strong, you would die, for your head it was quite mad!\"    \"Look here, Doctor Santos,\" said the Consul, \"our friend has forgotten  a lot of what has happened to him, . . there is a long period about  which his mind is a blank months in fact years!\"    \"That can be if it is the fever, yes! he will remember again. But his  head have been hurt, it is to be seen, that too may make forget, for  months even a year!\"    \"Forty years?\" suggested the Consul tentatively.    \"Ah, you joke, my friend!\" replied Santos, \"that would not be possible,  he is surely not that age himself?\"    And laughing, as he thought, at the Consul's joke, the little man gave  me a few instructions that I did not even hear, and left us.    And the Consul, without a word, handed me a newspaper, and a glance at  it was enough to show that he at least had made no mistake, for it was  dated September, 1900.    And now I was like to go crazy again, with the shock and bewilderment.  Forty years! A lifetime lost. My friends would be dead, or old, old  people who had long forgotten me. Of what use would all this wealth be  to me an old and forgotten friendless man. Old! yes, I must be an old,  old man myself. And yet, now the fever had gone, I felt strong and  vigorous indeed, the doctor had said that I was exceptionally strong  and that I was not forty and the Consul too had said I was a \"young,  strong man!\"    Surely this was pure hallucination . . . but no! the paper was real  enough. And turning it over I saw that indeed I had slept a lifetime,  for although it was in my own tongue, all it referred to was absolutely  strange to me. New inventions, places I had never heard of, nations  even that were unknown to me; it was as though I read of a new world,  as, uncomprehending, I glanced through this first newspaper that I had  seen for forty years.    The Consul had sat watching me in silence. He saw my agitation, and  realized something of what I felt, for putting out his hand and  grasping mine he said, kindly: \"It must be a blow . . . friends all  dead, eh? Well, I'm your friend, anyhow . . . and you'll remember  later. Why, man, you must get that forty years out of your mind you are  surely younger than myself, and will be as strong as a bull in a week  or two. Try and sleep, my friend; you'll remember better to-morrow!\"    But well I knew that the memory of those lost years"]]]
