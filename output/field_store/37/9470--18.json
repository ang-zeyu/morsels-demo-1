Then he suddenly  dropped the barrel of his shotgun, stepped forward, and took hold of the  snake by the tail.    \"It's a stuffed snake,\" he said. \"It belongs in the case in the  laboratory.\"    \"A stuffed snake?\" queried Tad Sobber, and when he realized the truth he  was the maddest boy in that school.    \"See here,\" said the master of the Hall, turning to Dick. \"Was this what  you saw last night?\"    \"No, sir,\" was the prompt reply. \"What we saw was a real, live snake.\"    \"Indeed it was,\" said George Strong.    \"Are you sure this one is from the case in the laboratory, Captain  Putnam?\" questioned Andrew Garmore, one of the teachers.    \"Yes, I know it well. Besides, here is the label on it.\"    \"Well, I looked at the case early this morning and it was filled as it  has always been.\"    \"It's a trick on me!\" roared Tad Sobber, angrily. \"Just wait, I'll get  square with somebody for this!\" And he looked sharply at the Rovers.    \"Sobber must like snakes--I saw him at the museum in Cedarville one  day,\" answered Dick, and eyed the bully boldly. At this Sobber grew red  in the face and slunk out of sight.    \"Get to bed, all of you,\" said Captain Putnam sharply. \"I'll investigate  this in the morning.\"    As on the night before, it took the school a long time to quiet down.  The Rover boys and their chums had a hearty laugh over the success of  the trick.    \"My! but Sobber is mad,\" said Fred. \"You want to watch out, he'll do  almost anything to get square.\"    The promised investigation the next day did not materialize, for the  reason that Captain Putnam was called away on important business. Thus  two days passed, and the snake incident was again practically forgotten  by the majority of the students.    On the following day the master of the Hall came back and said he would  start his investigation that afternoon after the school session.    \"And let me tell you one thing,\" he announced. \"Whoever brought that  real snake into this academy will have to suffer for it.\"    That afternoon in one of the classrooms some of the pupils were reciting  history when of a sudden a wild shriek rang through the air and Nick  Pell was seen to bounce up out of his seat and run away from his desk as  if a demon was after him.    \"What is it, Pell?\" demanded the teacher.    \"The--the snake!\" groaned Nick. \"Oh, I'm a dead boy!\"    \"Where is it?\" asked a score of voices.    \"In my desk! It just bit me in the hand! Oh, I'm a dead boy, I know I  am!\" And Nick Pell shook from head to foot in his terror.    The announcement that the snake was in Nick's desk was received in  various ways by the boys present. Some thought it must be the real snake  and others thought it might be only a trick. With caution the teacher  approached the desk, armed with a ruler. Then came a hissing sound and  the snake stuck out its head.    \"It's alive!\" yelled a dozen cadets.    \"Kill it! Kill it!\"    \"You go and kill it!\"    \"I haven't anything.\"    \"Neither have I.\"    \"Throw a book at it,\" suggested Tom, and let fly his Caesar. His aim was  good and the snake was hit in the neck and tumbled to the floor. Then  the boys threw books, rulers and inkwells at the reptile, and it was  driven into a corner. Dick took up a big geography, let it fall on top  of the snake, and stood on it. The reptile squirmed, but could not get  away, and in a few seconds more it was killed.    \"That's the end of that snake,\" said Sam, breathing a sigh of relief.  \"And I am mighty glad of it.\"    \"I am poisoned! I am poisoned!\" screamed Nick Pell. \"See, my hand is  swelling up already!\"    \"Do you think he was really bitten?\" whispered Tom.    \"It looks like it,\" answered Dick. \"Too bad--if the snake really was  poisonous.\"    By this time Captain Putnam had come in. He glanced at the dead snake  and gave a start.    \"Did that thing bite you, Pell?\" he questioned.    \"Yes, sir, right here--in--the--the palm of the hand,\" cried the youth  addressed. \"See how it is swelling.\"    \"I'll telephone for a doctor at once. Come to my office and I will see  what I can do for you.\"    Nick had certainly been bitten and now the hand was twice its ordinary  size, while the pain was acute. The boy shook like a leaf.    \"I'm poisoned, I know I am!\" he wailed. \"It's all Tad Sobber's fault,  too! Oh, if I should die!\" And then of a sudden he fell to the floor in  convulsions.          CHAPTER XVIII    IN WHICH TAD SOBBER DISAPPEARS      All standing near Nick Pell were amazed to see the boy fall to the  floor. Captain Putnam and Dick Rover raised him up. His eyes were  rolling frightfully and his jaws opened and shut with a snap that was  sickening.    \"Something is certainly wrong with him,\" whispered Sam to Tom.    \"Yes, he wouldn't act that way if he was simply frightened,\" was the  reply. \"And see his hand!\"    \"We will carry him up to one of the spare bedrooms,\" said Captain  Putnam. \"And, Mr. Strong, see to it that we get a doctor here as soon as  possible. Tell him it is a case of snake poisoning, and ask him over the  telephone what we had best do.\"    Nick Pell was carried upstairs. By this time he had ceased to move and  lay like a log in the hands of those who supported him.    Many had heard him mention Tad Sobber and all looked at the bully  inquiringly. Sobber was deadly pale, but managed to keep up a bold  front.    \"I am not to blame,\" he said, in answer to a question from one of the  teachers. \"I didn't put the snake in Pell's desk.\"    \"Did you bring the snake into the school?\"    \"Certainly not,\" answered the bully shamelessly. He made up his mind to  keep out of \"hot water\" even if it was necessary to lie to do it.    A hurry call was sent to Doctor Fremley of Cedarville and he came as  quickly as his mare could bring him. Only the teachers and the physician  were allowed in the bedroom with Pell, so the cadets did not know what  took place.    \"It's as plain as day,\" said Dick to his brother and his chums. \"Sobber  got the snake and put it in the box. That is why Pell said he was to  blame.\"    \"But Sobber told a teacher he did not bring the snake into the Hall,\"  answered Songbird.    \"I do not believe him,\" came from Tom.    \"Nor do I,\" added Sam. \"He's a bad egg, if ever there was one.\"    The poisoning of Nick Pell cast a damper over the whole school, and  neither the teachers nor the pupils could settle down to lessons. The  doctor remained with the sufferer for two hours, and when he went away  he looked very grave.    \"He is by no means out of danger,\" announced the physician. \"But let us  hope for the best. I think his parents ought to be notified.\"    This was done, and Mr. and Mrs. Pell came on the very next day to see  their son. They found him in something of a fever and out of his mind,  crying continually for Sobber to take the snake away.    \"Richard, I want to see you,\" said Captain Putnam that evening, and led  Dick to his private office. There he demanded to know what the eldest  Rover knew of the snake incident.    \"Captain Putnam, I will tell you everything from beginning to end,\"  answered Dick. \"If I am to suffer I'll take my punishment, and Tom and  Sam say they stand ready to do the same.\" And thereupon Dick related the  particulars of the trouble with the bully and Pell, and of how he and  his brothers and Songbird and Hans had seen Sobber and Pell at the  museum where the snakes had been. Then he told of the feast, and how the  snake had been discovered in the box.    \"I have kept the box,\" he added, \"and you can look at the writing if you  wish. I think it is in Tad Sobber's hand, although somewhat disguised.\"    The address on the box was investigated by the master of the Hall, who  sent for several compositions Tad Sobber had written. The bully was much  disturbed when he had to give up the compositions to George Strong.    \"What's that for?\" he asked, with a scowl on his face.    \"Captain Putnam wants them,\" answered the teacher, and would say no  more.    With anxious eyes the bully watched the first assistant disappear into  the office with the compositions. Then, looking to make sure that he was  not observed, he stole up to the door and applied his ear to the  keyhole. What he heard filled him with increased alarm.    \"It is Sobber's handwriting beyond a doubt,\" said Captain Putnam, after  comparing the compositions with the address on the box cover. \"I wonder  if he knew that the snake was a poisonous one?\"    \"Perhaps Nick Pell can tell that--after he gets over his trouble,\"  returned Dick.    \"Provided he does get over it, Richard.\"    \"Don't you think he'll recover?\" cried Dick, in consternation.    \"He may not. It is a very serious case, so Doctor Fremley informs me.\"    \"What does Mr. Pell say about it?\"    \"He wants me to investigate. He says he may have somebody arrested for  this--and I can hardly blame him. It was a vile thing to do--bring a  poisonous snake into the school.\"    At the mention of arrest Tad Sobber shut his teeth hard.    \"I guess it's about time I made myself scarce,\" he muttered. \"Perhaps I  had better leave and join Uncle Sid.\" And he walked away silently and up  to his room. He remained there about ten minutes, then stole forth and  down a back way, a fair-sized bundle under his arm.    At the conclusion of the interview in the office Captain Putnam sent for  Tad Sobber. One of the monitors went on the errand and came back in  quarter of an hour with the information that the youth could not be  found.    \"Did he have permission to leave the grounds?\" asked the captain of the  teachers.    \"Not from me,\" said one instructor after another.    Then Peleg Snuggers was sent out to hunt the bully up and soon came back  with the information that Sobber was not around the grounds, but had  been seen by two of the cadets walking in the"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/22168"],[0,"The Golden Spears (#16)"],[1,"d. There also are  a hundred cakes, and it is only on eating these the hundred hounds can  die. But mind what I say to you: if you eat or drink until you reach the  palace of the little cat in the island in the unknown seas, you will  forget the Princess Eileen.\"    \"I will forget myself first,\" said the prince, as he stepped into the  silver boat, which floated away so quickly that it was soon out of sight  of land.    The day passed and the night fell, and the stars shone down upon the  waters, but the boat never stopped. On she went for two whole days  and nights, and on the third morning the prince saw an island in the  distance, and very glad he was; for he thought it was his journey's end,  and he was almost fainting with thirst and hunger. But the day passed  and the island was still before him.    At long last, on the following day, he saw by the first light of the  morning that he was quite close to it, and that trees laden with fruit  of every kind were bending down over the water. The boat sailed round  and round the island, going closer and closer every round, until, at  last, the drooping branches almost touched it. The sight of the fruit  within his reach made the prince hungrier and thirstier than he was  before, and forgetting his promise to the little cat--not to eat  anything until he entered the palace in the unknown seas--he caught one  of the branches, and, in a moment, was in the tree eating the delicious  fruit. While he was doing so the boat floated out to sea and soon was  lost to sight; but the prince, having eaten, forgot all about it, and,  worse still, forgot all about the princess in the giant's castle. When  he had eaten enough he descended the tree, and, turning his back on the  sea, set out straight before him. He had not gone far when he heard the  sound of music, and soon after he saw a number of maidens playing on  silver harps coming towards him. When they saw him they ceased playing,  and cried out:    \"Welcome! welcome! Prince of the Silver River, welcome to the island of  fruits and flowers. Our king and queen saw you coming over the sea, and  they sent us to bring you to the palace.\"    The prince went with them, and at the palace gates the king and queen  and their daughter Kathleen received him, and gave him welcome. He  hardly saw the king and queen, for his eyes were fixed on the Princess  Kathleen, who looked more beautiful than a flower. He thought he had  never seen anyone so lovely, for, of course, he had forgotten all about  poor Eileen pining away in her castle prison in the lonely valley. When  the king and queen had given welcome to the prince a great feast was  spread, and all the lords and ladies of the court sat down to it, and  the prince sat between the queen and the Princess Kathleen, and long  before the feast was finished he was over head and ears in love with  her. When the feast was ended the queen ordered the ballroom to be made  ready, and when night fell the dancing began, and was kept up until the  morning star, and the prince danced all night with the princess, falling  deeper and deeper in love with her every minute. Between dancing by  night and feasting by day weeks went by. All the time poor Eileen in the  giant's castle was counting the hours, and all this time the dwarfs were  winding the balls, and a ball and a half were already wound. At last the  prince asked the king and queen for their daughter in marriage, and they  were delighted to be able to say yes, and the day was fixed for the  wedding. But on the evening before the day on which it was to take place  the prince was in his room, getting ready for a dance, when he felt  something rubbing against his leg, and, looking down, who should he see  but the little white cat. At the sight of him the prince remembered  everything, and sad and sorry he was when he thought of Eileen watching  and waiting and counting the days until he returned to save her. But he  was very fond of the Princess Kathleen, and so he did not know what to  do.    [Illustration: \"At the sight of him the prince remembered everything\"]    \"You can't do anything to-night,\" said the cat, for he knew what the  prince was thinking of, \"but when morning comes go down to the sea, and  look not to the right or the left, and let no living thing touch you,  for if you do you shall never leave the island. Drop the second ball  into the water, as you did the first, and when the boat comes step in  at once. Then you may look behind you, and you shall see what you shall  see, and you'll know which you love best, the Princess Eileen or the  Princess Kathleen, and you can either go or stay.\"    The prince didn't sleep a wink that night, and at the first glimpse of  the morning he stole from the palace. When he reached the sea he threw  out the ball, and when it had floated out of sight, he saw the little  boat sparkling on the horizon like a newly-risen star. The prince had  scarcely passed through the palace doors when he was missed, and the  king and queen and the princess, and all the lords and ladies of the  court, went in search of him, taking the quickest way to the sea. While  the maidens with the silver harps played sweetest music, the princess,  whose voice was sweeter than any music, called on the prince by his  name, and so moved his heart that he was about to look behind, when he  remembered how the cat had told him he should not do so until he was in  the boat. Just as it touched the shore the princess put out her hand and  almost caught the prince's arm, but he stepped into the boat in time  to save himself, and it sped away like a receding wave. A loud scream  caused the prince to look round suddenly, and when he did he saw no sign  of king or queen, or princess, or lords or ladies, but only big green  serpents, with red eyes and tongues, that hissed out fire and poison as  they writhed in a hundred horrible coils.    The prince, having escaped from the enchanted island, sailed away for  three days and three nights, and every night he hoped the coming morning  would show him the island he was in search of. He was faint with hunger  and beginning to despair, when on the fourth morning he saw in the  distance an island that, in the first rays of the sun, gleamed like  fire. On coming closer to it he saw that it was clad with trees, so  covered with bright red berries that hardly a leaf was to be seen. Soon  the boat was almost within a stone's cast of the island, and it began to  sail round and round until it was well under the bending branches. The  scent of the berries was so sweet that it sharpened the prince's hunger,  and he longed to pluck them; but, remembering what had happened to him  on the enchanted island, he was afraid to touch them. But the boat kept  on sailing round and round, and at last a great wind rose from the sea  and shook the branches, and the bright, sweet berries fell into the boat  until it was filled with them, and they fell upon the prince's hands,  and he took up some to look at them, and as he looked the desire to eat  them grew stronger, and he said to himself it would be no harm to taste  one; but when he tasted it the flavor was so delicious he swallowed it,  and, of course, at once he forgot all about Eileen, and the boat drifted  away from him and left him standing in the water.    He climbed on to the island, and having eaten enough of the berries, he  set out to see what might be before him, and it was not long until he  heard a great noise, and a huge iron ball knocked down one of the trees  in front of him, and before he knew where he was a hundred giants came  running after it. When they saw the prince they turned towards him, and  one of them caught him up in his hand and held him up that all might see  him. The prince was nearly squeezed to death, and seeing this the giant  put him on the ground again.    \"Who are you, my little man?\" asked the giant.    \"I am a prince,\" replied the prince.    \"Oh, you are a prince, are you?\" said the giant. \"And what are you good  for?\" said he.    The prince did not know, for nobody had asked him that question before.    \"I know what he's good for,\" said an old giantess, with one eye in her  forehead and one in her chin. \"I know what he's good for. He's good to  eat.\"    When the giants heard this they laughed so loud that the prince was  frightened almost to death.    \"Why,\" said one, \"he wouldn't make a mouthful.\"    \"Oh, leave him to me,\" said the giantess, \"and I'll fatten him up; and  when he is cooked and dressed he will be a nice dainty dish for the  king.\"    The giants, on this, gave the prince into the hands of the old giantess.  She took him home with her to the kitchen, and fed him on sugar and  spice and all things nice, so that he should be a sweet morsel for the  king of the giants when he returned to the island. The poor prince would  not eat anything at first, but the giantess held him over the fire until  his feet were scorched, and then he said to himself it was better to eat  than to be burnt alive.    Well, day after day passed, and the prince grew sadder and sadder,  thinking that he would soon be cooked and dressed for the king; but sad  as the prince was, he was not half as sad as the Princess Eileen in the  giant's castle, watching and waiting for the prince to return and save  her.    And the dwarfs had wound two balls, and were winding a third.    At last the prince heard from the old giantess that the king of the  giants was to return on the following day, and she said to him:    \"As this is the last night you have to live, tell me if you wish for  anything, for if you do your wish will be granted.\"    \"I don't wish for anything,\" said the prince, whose heart was dead  within him.    \"Well, I'll come back again,\" said the giantess, and she went away.    The prince sat down in a corner, thinking and thinking, until he heard  close to his ear a sound like \"purr, purr!\" He looked around, and there  before him"]]]
