[25] The Amidei, who were the source of much of the misery of  Florence, through their long and bitter feud with the  Buondelmonti, by which the whole city was divided.    [26] The quarrel between the Amidei and the Buondelmonti arose  from the slighting by Buondelmonto dei Buondelmonti of a daughter  of the former house, to whom he was betrothed, for a daughter of  the Donati, induced thereto by her mother. This was in 1215.    [27] The Ema, a little stream that has to be crossed in coming  from Montebuono, the home of the Buondelmonti, to Florence.    [28] That victim was Buondelmonte himself, slain by the outraged  Amidei, at the foot of the mutilated statue of Mars, which stood  at the end of the Ponte Vecchio.      \"With these families, and with others with them, I saw Florence  in such repose that she had no occasion why she should weep. With  these families I saw her people so glorious and so just, that the  lily was never set reversed upon the staff, nor had it been made  blood-red by division.\"[1]    [1] The banner of Florence had never fallen into the hands of her  enemies, to be reversed by them in scoff. Of old it had borne a  white lily in a red field, but in 1250, when the Ghibellines  were expelled, the Guelphs adopted a red lily in a white field,  and this became the ensign of the Commune.        CANTO XVII. Dante questions Cacciaguida as to his fortunes.--  Cacciaguida replies, foretelling the exile of Dante, and the  renown of his Poem.    As he who still makes fathers chary toward their sons[1] came to  Clymene, to ascertain concerning that which he had heard against  himself; such was I, and such was I perceived to be both by  Beatrice, and by the holy lamp which first for my sake had  changed its station. Whereon my Lady said to me, \"Send forth  the flame of thy desire so that it may issue sealed well by the  internal stamp; not in order that our knowledge may increase  through thy speech, but that thou accustom thyself to tell thy  thirst, so that one may give thee drink.\"    [1] Phaethon, son of Clymene by Apollo, having been told that  Apollo was not his father, went to his mother to ascertain the  truth.      \"O dear plant of me, who so upliftest thyself that, even as  earthly minds see that two obtuse angles are not contained in a  triangle, so thou, gazing upon the point to which all times are  present, seest contingent things, ere in themselves they are;  while I was conjoined with Virgil up over the  mountain which cures the souls, and while descending in the world  of the dead, grave words were said to me of my future life;  although I feel myself truly four-square against the blows of  chance. Wherefore my wish would be content by hearing what sort  of fortune is drawing near me; for arrow foreseen comes more  slack.\" Thus said I unto that same light which before had spoken  to me, and as Beatrice willed was my wish confessed.    Not with ambiguous terms in which the foolish folk erst were  entangled,[1] ere yet the Lamb of God which taketh away sins had  been slain, but with clear words and with distinct speech that  paternal love, hid and apparent by his own proper smile, made  answer: \"Contingency, which extends not outside the volume of  your matter, is all depicted in the eternal aspect. Therefrom,  however, it takes not necessity, more than from the eye in which  it is mirrored does a ship which descends with the downward  current. Thence, even as sweet harmony comes to the ear from an  organ, comes to my sight the time that is preparing for thee. As  Hippolytus departed from Athens, by reason of his pitiless and  perfidious stepmother, so out from Florence thou must needs  depart. This is willed, this is already sought for, and soon it  shall be brought to pass, by him I who designs it there where  every day Christ is bought and sold. The blame will follow the  injured party, in outcry, as it is wont; but the vengeance will  be testimony to the truth which dispenses it. Thou shalt leave  everything beloved most dearly; and this is the arrow which the  bow of exile first shoots. Thou shalt prove how the bread of  others savors of salt, and how the descending and the mounting of  another's stairs is a hard path. And that which will heaviest  weigh upon thy shoulders will be the evil and foolish company[2]  with which into this valley thou shalt fall; which all  ungrateful, all senseless, and impious will turn against thee;  but short while after, it, not thou, shall have the forehead red  therefor. Of its bestiality, its own procedure will give the  proof; so that it will be seemly for thee to have made thyself a  party by thyself.

With him shalt thou see one,[2] who was so  impressed, at his birth, by this strong star, that his deeds will  be notable. Not yet are the people aware of him, because of his  young age; for only nine years have these wheels revolved around  him. But ere the Gascon cheat the lofty Henry[3] some sparkles of  his virtue shall appear, in caring not for silver nor for toils.  His magnificences shall hereafter be so known, that his enemies  shall not be able to keep their tongues mute about them. Await  thou for him, and for his benefits; by him shall many people be  transformed, rich and mendicant changing condition. And thou  shalt bear hence written of him in thy mind, but thou shalt not  tell it;\" and he said things incredible to those who shall be  present. Then he added, \"Son, these are the glosses on what was  said to thee; behold the ambushes which are bidden behind few  revolutions. Yet would I not that thou bate thy neighbors,  because thy life hath a future far beyond the punishment of their  perfidies.\"    [[1] Bartolommeo della Scala, lord of Verona, whose armorial  bearings were the imperial eagle upon a ladder (scala).

When by its silence that holy soul showed it had finished  putting the woof into that web which I had given it warped, I  began, as he who, in doubt, longs for counsel from a person who  sees, and uprightly wills, and loves: \"I see well, my Father,  how the time spurs on toward me to give me such a blow as is  heaviest to him who most deserts himself; wherefore it is good  that I arm me with foresight, so that if the place most dear be  taken from me, I should not lose the others by my songs. Down  through the world of endless bitterness, and over the mountain  from whose fair summit the eyes of my Lady have lifted me, and  afterward through the heavens from light to light, I have learned  that which, if I repeat it, shall be to many a savor keenly sour;  and if I am a timid friend to the truth I fear to lose life among  those who will call this time the olden.\" The light, in which my  treasure which I had found there was smiling, first became  flashing as a mirror of gold in the sunbeam; then it replied, \"A  conscience dark, either with its own or with another's shame,  will indeed feel thy speech as harsh; but nevertheless, all  falsehood laid aside, make thy whole vision manifest, and let the  scratching be even where the itch is; for if at the first taste  thy voice shall be molestful, afterwards, when it shall be  digested, it will leave vital nourishment. This cry of thine  shall do as the wind, which heaviest strikes the loftiest  summits; and that will be no little argument of honor. Therefore  to thee have been shown within these wheels, upon the mountain,  and in the woeful valley, only the souls which are known of fame.  For the mind of him who bears rests not, nor confirms its faith,  through an example which has its root unknown and hidden, nor by  other argument which is not apparent.\"        CANTO XVIII.

Now was that blessed mirror enjoying alone its own word,[1] and I  was tasting mine, tempering the bitter with the sweet. and that  Lady who to God was leading me said, \"Change thy thought; think  that I am near to Him who lifts the burden of every wrong.\" I  turned me round at the loving sound of my Comfort, and what love  I then saw in the holy eyes, I here leave it; not only because I  distrust my own speech, but because of the memory which cannot  return so far above itself, unless another guide it. Thus much of  that moment can I recount, that, again beholding her, my  affection was free from every other desire.    [1] Its own thoughts in contemplation.      While the eternal pleasure, which was raying directly upon  Beatrice, from her fair face was contenting me with its second  aspect,[1] vanquishing me with the light of a smile, she said to  me, \"Turn thee, and listen, for not only in my eyes is Paradise.\"    [1] Its aspect reflected from the eyes of Beatrice.      As sometimes here one sees the affection in the countenance, if  it be so great that by it the whole soul is occupied, so in the  flaming of the holy effulgence to which I turned me, I recognized  the will in it still to speak somewhat with me.

The singing of carols is now confined to Christmas day; but it was not  always so, appropriate carols being sung during the Christ-tide  preceding the day of the Nativity--such, for instance, as the  following examples. The first is taken from Sloane MS. 2593, in the  British Museum, and in this one I have preserved the old spelling,  which is ascribed to the time of Henry VI. It will be seen that  Christ-tide is prolonged till Candlemas day, the Feast of the  Purification of the Blessed Virgin Mary, which is kept on the 2nd of  February, on which day all Christ-tide decorations are taken down.

[Footnote 26: Yule.]    [Footnote 27: St. Thomas a Becket, of Canterbury, was commemorated on  29th December.]    The following is taken from a MS. of the latter half of the fifteenth  century, which Mr. Thomas Wright edited for the Percy Society in 1847.  The spelling is even more archaic than the above, so that it is  modernised, and a gloss given for all those words which may not be  easily understood wherever possible:--             This endris[28] night           I saw a sight,             A star as bright as day;           And ever among           A maiden sung,             Lullay, by by, lullay.         The lovely lady sat and sang, and to her Child said--       My son, my brother, my father dear, why lyest Thou thus in hayd.           My sweet bird,           Thus it is betide             Though Thou be King veray;[29]           But, nevertheless,           I will not cease             To sing, by by, lullay.         The Child then spake in His talking, and to His mother said--       I bekyd[30] am King, in Crib[31] there I be laid;           For Angels bright           Down to Me light,             Thou knowest it is no nay;           And of that sight           Thou mays't be light             To sing, by by, lullay.         Now, sweet Son, since Thou art King, why art Thou laid in stall?       Why not Thou ordained Thy bedding in some great King his hall?           Me thinketh it is right           That King or Knight             Should lie in good array;           And then among           It were no wrong             To sing, by by, lullay.         Mary, mother, I am thy child, though I be laid in stall,       Lords and dukes shall worship Me, and so shall Kings all;           Ye shall well see           That Kings three             Shall come the twelfth day;           For this behest           Give me thy breast             And sing, by by, lullay.         Now tell me, sweet Son, I pray Thee, Thou art my love and dear,       How should I keep Thee to Thy pay,[32] and make Thee glad of cheer;           For all Thy will           I would fulfil             Thou witest[33] full well, in fay,[34]           And for all this           I will Thee kiss             And sing, by by, lullay.         My dear mother, when time it be, thou take Me up aloft,       And set Me upon thy knee, and handle Me full soft;           And in thy arm,           Thou wilt Me warm,             And keep night and day;           If I weep,           And may not sleep,             Thou sing, by by, lullay.         Now, sweet Son, since it is so, that all thing is at Thy will,       I pray Thee grant me a boon, if it be both right and skill.[35]           That child or man,           That will or can             Be merry upon my day;           To bliss them bring,           And I shall sing             Lullay, by by, lullay.    [Footnote 28: Last.]    [Footnote 29: True.]    [Footnote 30: I am renowned as.]    [Footnote 31: Manger.]    [Footnote 32: Satisfaction.]    [Footnote 33: Knowest.]    [Footnote 34: In faith.]    [Footnote 35: Reasonable.]    A very popular carol, too, was that of the Legend of the Cherry Tree,  which is very ancient, and is one of the scenes in the fifteenth of  the Coventry Mysteries, which were played in the fifteenth century, on  _Corpus Christi Day_.         Joseph was an old man,         And an old man was he,       And he married Mary         The Queen of Galilee.         When Joseph was married,         And Mary home had brought,       Mary proved with child,         And Joseph knew it not.         Joseph and Mary walked         Through a garden gay,       Where the cherries they grew         Upon every tree.         O, then bespoke Mary,         With words both meek and mild,       \"O, gather me cherries, Joseph,         They run so in my mind.\"         And then replied Joseph,         With his words so unkind,       \"Let him gather thee cherries,         That got thee with child.\"         O, then bespoke our Savior,         All in His mother's womb,       \"Bow down, good cherry tree,         To My mother's hand.\"         The uppermost sprig         Bowed down to Mary's knee,       \"Thus you may see, Joseph,         These cherries are for me.\"         \"O, eat your cherries, Mary,         O, eat your cherries now,       O, eat your cherries, Mary,         That grow upon the bow.\"    The parable of Dives and Lazarus was a great favourite at Christ-tide,  as, presumably, it served to stir up men to deeds of charity towards  their poorer brethren; but the following carol, parts of which are  very curious, has nothing like the antiquity of the foregoing  examples:--         As it fell out upon a day,         Rich Dives made a feast,       And he invited all his guests,         And gentry of the best.         Then Lazarus laid him down, and down,         And down at Dives' door,       \"Some meat, some drink, brother Dives,         Bestow upon the poor.\"         \"Thou art none of my brother, Lazarus,         That lies begging at my door,       No meat, nor drink will I give thee,         Nor bestow upon the poor.\"         Then Lazarus laid him down, and down,         And down at Dives' wall,       \"Some meat, some drink, brother Dives,         Or with hunger starve I shall.\"         \"Thou art none of my brother, Lazarus,         That lies begging at my wall,       No meat, nor drink will I give thee,         But with hunger starve you shall.\"         Then Lazarus laid him down, and down,         And down at Dives' gate,       \"Some meat, some drink, brother Dives,         For Jesus Christ, His sake.\"         \"Thou art none of my brother, Lazarus,         That lies begging at my gate,       No meat, nor drink I'll give to thee,         For Jesus Christ, His sake.\"         Then Dives sent out his merry men,         To whip poor Lazarus away,       But they had no power to strike a stroke,         And flung their whips away.         Then Dives sent out his hungry dogs,         To bite him as he lay.       But they had no power to bite at all,         So licked his sores away.         As it fell upon a day,         Poor Lazarus sickened and died,       There came an Angel out of heaven,         His soul there for to guide.         \"Rise up, rise up, brother Lazarus,         And come along with me,       For there's a place in heaven provided         To site on an Angel's knee.\"         As it fell upon a day,         Rich Dives sickened and died,       There came a serpent out of hell,         His soul there for to guide.         \"Rise up, rise up, brother Dives,         And come along with me,       For there's a place in hell provided,         To sit on a "]]]
