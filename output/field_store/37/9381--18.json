A studious and elegant writer, Mr. Douglas Campbell, has presented in  two ample and interesting volumes[74:1] the evidence in favor of his  thesis that the characteristic institutions established by the Puritans  in New England were derived, directly or indirectly, not from England,  but from Holland. One of the gravest answers to an argument which  contains so much to command respect is found in the history of the New  Netherlands. In the early records of no one of the American colonies is  there less manifestation of the Puritan characteristics than in the  records of the colony that was absolutely and exclusively under Dutch  control and made up chiefly of Dutch settlers. Nineteen years from the  beginning of the colony there was only one church in the whole extent of  it; at the end of thirty years there were only two churches. After ten  years of settlement the first schoolmaster arrived; and after thirty-six  years a Latin school was begun, for want of which up to that time young  men seeking a classical education had had to go to Boston for it. In no  colony does there appear less of local self-government or of central  representative government, less of civil liberty, or even of the  aspiration for it. The contrast between the character of this colony and  the heroic antecedents of the Dutch in Holland is astonishing and  inexplicable. The sordid government of a trading corporation doubtless  tended to depress the moral tone of the community, but this was an evil  common to many of the colonies. Ordinances, frequently renewed, for the  prevention of disorder and brawling on Sunday and for restricting the  sale of strong drinks, show how prevalent and obstinate were these  evils. In 1648 it is boldly asserted in the preamble to a new law that  one fourth of the houses in New Amsterdam were devoted to the sale of  strong drink. Not a hopeful beginning for a young commonwealth.           *       *       *       *       *    Before bidding a willing good-bye to the Dutch regime of the New  Netherlands, it remains to tell the story of another colony, begun under  happy auspices, but so short-lived that its rise and fall are a mere  episode in the history of the Dutch colony.    As early as 1630, under the feudal concessions of the Dutch West India  Company, extensive tracts had been taken on the South River, or  Delaware, and, after purchase from the Indians, settled by a colony  under the conduct of the best of all the Dutch leaders, De Vries.  Quarrels with the Indians arose, and at the end of a twelvemonth the  colony was extinguished in blood. The land seemed to be left free for  other occupants.    Years before, the great Gustavus Adolphus had pondered and decided on an  enterprise of colonization in America.[76:1] The exigencies of the  Thirty Years' War delayed the execution of his plan, but after the fatal  day of Luetzen the project resumed by the fit successor of Gustavus in  the government of Sweden, the Chancellor Oxenstiern. Peter Minuit, who  had been rejected from his place as the first governor of New Amsterdam,  tendered to the Swedes the aid of his experience and approved wisdom;  and in the end of the year 1637, against the protest of Governor Kieft,  the strong foundations of a Swedish Lutheran colony were laid on the  banks of the Delaware. A new purchase was made of the Indians (who had  as little scruple as the Stuart kings about disposing of the same land  twice over to different parties), including the lands from the mouth of  the bay to the falls near Trenton. A fort was built where now stands the  city of Wilmington, and under the protection of its walls Christian  worship was begun by the first pastor, Torkillus. Strong reinforcements  arrived in 1643, with the energetic Governor Printz and that man of  \"unwearied zeal in always propagating the love of God,\" the Rev. John  Campanius, who through faith has obtained a good report by his brief  most laborious ministry both to his fellow-countrymen and to the  Delaware Indians.    The governor fixed his residence at Tinicum, now almost included within  the vast circumference of Philadelphia, and there, forty years before  the arrival of William Penn, Campanius preached the gospel of peace in  two languages, to the red men and to the white.    The question of the Swedish title, raised at the outset by the protest  of the Dutch governor, could not long be postponed. It was suddenly  precipitated on the arrival of Governor Rising, in 1654, by his capture  of Fort Casimir, which the Dutch had built for the practical assertion  of their claim. It seems a somewhat grotesque act of piety on the part  of the Swedes, when, having celebrated the festival of Trinity Sunday by  whipping their fellow-Christians out of the fort, they commemorated the  good work by naming it the Fort of the Holy Trinity. It was a fatal  victory. The next year came Governor Stuyvesant with an overpowering  force and demanded and received the surrender of the colony to the  Dutch. Honorable terms of surrender were conceded; among them, against  the protest, alas! of good Domine Megapolensis, was the stipulation of  religious liberty for the Lutherans.    It was the end of the Swedish colony, but not at once of the church. The  Swedish community of some seven hundred souls, cut off from  reinforcement and support from the fatherland, cherished its language  and traditions and the mold of doctrine in which it had been shaped;  after more than forty years the reviving interest of the mother church  was manifested by the sending out of missionaries to seek and succor the  daughter long absent and neglected in the wilderness. Two venerable  buildings, the Gloria Dei Church in the southern part of Philadelphia,  and the Old Swedes' Church at Wilmington, remain as monuments of the  honorable story. The Swedish language ceased to be spoken; the people  became undistinguishably absorbed in the swiftly multiplying population  about them.           *       *       *       *       *    It was a short-lived triumph in which the Dutch colony reduced the  Swedish under its jurisdiction. It only prepared a larger domain for it  to surrender, in its turn, to superior force. With perfidy worthy of  the House of Stuart, the newly restored king of England, having granted  to his brother, the Duke of York, territory already plighted to others  and territory already occupied by a friendly power, stretching in all  from the Connecticut to the Delaware, covered his designs with friendly  demonstrations, and in a time of profound peace surprised the quiet town  of New Amsterdam with a hostile fleet and land force and a peremptory  demand for surrender. The only hindrance interposed was a few hours of  vain and angry bluster from Stuyvesant. The indifference of the Dutch  republic, which had from the beginning refused its colony any promise of  protection, and the sordid despotism of the Company, and the arrogant  contempt of popular rights manifested by its governors, seem to have  left no spark of patriotic loyalty alive in the population. With inert  indifference, if not even with satisfaction, the colony transferred its  allegiance to the British crown, henceforth sovereign from Maine to the  Carolinas. The rights of person and property, religious liberty, and  freedom of trade were stipulated in the capitulation.    The British government was happy in the character of Colonel Nicolls,  who came as commandant of the invading expedition and remained as  governor. Not only faithful to the terms of the surrender, but  considerate of the feelings and interests of the conquered province, he  gave the people small reason to regret the change of government. The  established Dutch church not only was not molested, but was continued in  full possession of its exceptional privileges. And it continued to  languish. At the time of the surrender the province contained \"three  cities, thirty villages, and ten thousand inhabitants,\"[78:1] and for  all these there were six ministers. The six soon dribbled away to  three, and for ten years these three continued without reinforcement.  This extreme feebleness of the clergy, the absence of any vigorous  church life among the laity, and the debilitating notion that the power  and the right to preach the gospel must be imported from Holland, put  the Dutch church at such a disadvantage as to invite aggression. Later  English governors showed no scruple in violating the spirit of the terms  of surrender and using their official power and influence to force the  establishment of the English church against the almost unanimous will of  the people. Property was unjustly taken and legal rights infringed to  this end, but the end was not attained. Colonel Morris, an earnest  Anglican, warned his friends against the folly of taking by force the  salaries of ministers chosen by the people and paying them over to \"the  ministers of the church.\" \"It may be a means of subsisting those  ministers, but they won't make many converts among a people who think  themselves very much injured.\" The pious efforts of Governor Fletcher,  the most zealous of these official propagandists, are even more severely  characterized in a dispatch of his successor, the Earl of Bellomont:  \"The late governor, ... under the notion of a Church of England to be  put in opposition to the Dutch and French churches established here,  supported a few rascally English, who are a scandal to their nation and  the Protestant religion.\"[79:1] Evidently such support would have for  its main effect to make the pretended establishment odious to the  people. Colonel Morris sharply points out the impolicy as well as the  injustice of the course adopted, claiming that his church would have  been in a much better position"]]]
