[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/19036"],[0,"Germany and the Germans from an American Point of View (#16)"],[1,"regard to the views and opinions of the day.\"    Prince Henry of Prussia, the popular, and deservedly popular, sailor  brother of the Emperor, has signified his entire allegiance to this  doctrine by saying that he was actuated by one single motive: \"a  desire to proclaim to the nations the gospel of your Majesty's sacred  person, and to preach that gospel alike to those who will listen and  to those who will not.\"    This language has a strange and far-away sound to us. It is as though  one should come into the market-place with the bannered pomp of  Milton's prose upon his lips. The vicious would think it a trick, the  idle would look upon it as a heavy form of joking, the intelligent  would see in it a superstition, or a dream of knighthood that has  faded into unrecognizable dimness. Some men, on the other hand, might  wish that all rulers and governors whatsoever were equally touched  with the sanctity of their obligations.    It is somewhat strange in this connection to remember, that we all  wish to have our wives and daughters believers; that we all wish to  bind to us those whom we love with more sacred bonds than those which  we ourselves can supply. We are none of us loath to have those who  keep our treasures, believe in some code higher than that of \"honesty  is the best policy.\" As Archbishop Whately said: \"Honesty is the best  policy, but he who is honest for that reason is not an honest man.\"    Far be it from me to appear as an advocate of the divine right of  kings; but I am no fit person for this particular task if I have only  a sniff, or a guffaw, as an explanation of another's beliefs. History  sparkles with the lives of men and women, who proclaimed themselves  messengers and servants of God, obedient to him first, and utterly and  courageously negligent of that feline commodity, public opinion. Every  man, even to-day,    \"Who each for the joy of the working, and each in his separate star,  Shall draw the Thing as he sees It for the God of Things as They Are,\"  has a grain of this salt of divine independence in him. To-day, even  as in the days of Pericles: \"It is ever from the greatest hazards that  the greatest honors are gained,\" and the greatest hazard of all is to  shut your visor and couch your lance and have at your task with a  whispered: God and my Right! It is well to remember that under no  government, whether democratic or aristocratic, has the individual  ever been given any rights. He has always everywhere been pointed to  his duties; his rights he must conquer for himself.    The liberal in theology, as the liberal in politics, has perhaps  leaned too far toward softness. The democratization of religion has  gone on with the rest, and in our rebound from Calvin, and John Knox,  and Jonathan Edwards, we have left all discipline and authority out of  account. We have preached so persistently of the fatherhood of God, of  his nearness to us, of his profound pity for us, that we have lost  sight of his justice and his power. This nearness has become a sort of  innocuous neighborliness, and God is looked upon not as a ruler, but  as a vaporish good fellow whose chief business it is to forgive. We  have substituted a feverish-handed charity for a sinewy faith, and are  excusing our divorce from divinely imposed duties, by a cheerful but  illicit intercourse with chance acquaintances, all of whom are dubbed  social service.    This Cashmere-shawl theology is as idle an interpretation of man's  relation to the universe, and far more debilitating, than any that has  gone before. When we come to measure rulers who make divine claims for  their duties, from any such coign of flabbiness as this, no wonder we  stand dumb. I am willing to concede that perhaps even an emperor has  been baptized with the blood of the martyrs, and feels himself to be  in all sincerity the instrument of God; if we are to understand this  one, we must admit so much.    In certain departments of life, we not only grant, but we demand, that  our wives and mothers should look upon their special duties and  peculiar functions as divinely imparted, and as beyond argument, and  as above coercion. This assumption, therefore, of inalienable rights  is not so strange to us; on the contrary, it is an every-day affair in  most of our lives. This particular manifestation of it is all that is  new or surprising. We Americans and English look upon it as dangerous,  but the Germans, more mystical and far more lethargic about liberty  than are we, are not greatly disturbed by it. The secular press,  largely in Jewish hands, and the new socialist members of the  Reichstag, jealous of their prerogatives but unable to assert them,  criticise and even scream their abhorrence and unbelief; but I am much  mistaken, if the mass of the Germans are at heart much disturbed by  their Emperor's assertions of his divine right to rule. A conservative  member of the Reichstag speaks of, \"a parliament which will maintain  the monarch in his strong position as the wearer of the German  imperial crown, not the semblance of a monarch but one that is  dependent upon something higher than party and parliament -- one  dependent upon the King of all kings.\"    To a thoroughbred American, with two and more centuries of the  traditions of independence behind him, this question of the divine  right of kings is a commonplace. He is a king himself, he holds his  own rights to be divine, and his influence and his power to be limited  only by his character and his abilities, like that of any other  sovereign. He may rule over few or many, he may control the destiny of  only one or of many subjects, he may be well known or little known,  but that he is a sovereign individual by the grace of God, it never  occurs to him to doubt. It is perhaps for this reason that the real  American is placid and unself-conscious before this claim. It is those  who admit and suffer from the exactions and tyrannies of such a claim  that he pities, not the man who makes it, whom he distrusts. I carry  my sovereignty under my hat, says the American; if any man or men can  knock off the hat and take away the sovereignty, there is a fair field  and no favor; for those who whimper and complain of tyranny he has  long since ceased to have a high regard.    That William the Second is the chief figure of interest in the world  to-day is due, not alone to this assumption of a divine relation to  the state, or to his own vigorous and electric personality, but to the  freedom to develop and to express that personality. Men in politics  have dwindled in importance and in power, as the voters have increased  in numbers and in influence. Genius must be true to itself to bloom  luxuriantly. It is impossible to be seeking the suffrage of a  constituency and at the same time to be wholly one's self. The German  Emperor is unhampered, as is no other ruler, by considerations of  popular favor; and at the same time he directs and influences not  Russian peasants, nor Turkish slaves, but an instructed, enlightened,  and ambitious people. This environment is unique in the world to-day,  and the Germans as a whole seem to consider their ruler a valuable  asset, despite occasional vagaries that bring down their own and  foreign criticism upon him.    Here we have a versatile and vigorous personality with no shadow of a  stain upon his character, and with no question upon the part of his  bitterest enemy of the honesty of his intentions, or of his devotion  to his country's interests. So far as he has been assailed abroad, it  is on the score that he has made his country so powerful in the last  twenty-five years that Germany is a menace to other powers; so far as  he has been criticised at home it is on the score of his  indiscretions.    It is of prime importance, therefore, both to glance at the progress  of Germany and to examine these so-called indiscretions. Throughout  these chapters will be found facts and figures dealing with the fairy-like  change which has taken place in Germany since my own student  days. I can remember when a chimney was a rare sight. Now there are  almost as many manufacturing towns as then there were chimneys.  Leipzig was a big country town, Pforzheim, Chemnitz, Oschatz,  Elberfeld, Riessa, Kiel, Essen, Rheinhausen, and their armies of  laborers, and their millions of output, were mere shadows of what they  are now.    In 1873, when Bismarck began his attempts at railway legislation,  Germany was divided into sixty-three \"railway provinces,\" and there  were fifteen hundred different tariffs, and it is to be remembered  that it was only as late as 1882 that the state system of railways at  last triumphed in Prussia. In only ten years the railway trackage has  increased from 49,041 to 52,216 miles; the number of locomotives from  18,291 to 26,612; freight-cars from 398,000 to 558,000; the passengers  carried from 804,000,000 to 1,457,000,000; and the tons of freight  carried from 341,000,000 tons to 519,000,000 tons. In Prussia alone  there are 1,000,000 more horses, 1,000,000 more beef cattle, and  10,000,000 more pigs. The total production of beet sugar in the world  approximates 7,000,000 tons; of this amount Germany produces 2,500,000  tons. Great Britain consumes more sugar per head of the population  than any other country, and of her consumption of 1,460,000 tons of  beet sugar all of it is produced from beets grown on the continent.  Between 1885 and 1912 the population increased from 46,000,000 to  66,000,000. The expenditure on the navy has increased in the last ten  years from $47,500,000 to $110,000,000, and the number of men from  31,157 to 60,805, with another increase in both money and men, voted  at the moment of this writing in the summer of 1912.    The debt of Germany, exclusive of paper money, in 1887 was 486,201,000  marks; in 1903 it stood at 2,733,500,000. In 1911 the funded debt of  the empire was 4,524,000,000 marks, and the funded "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/19042"],[0,"Animal Figures in the Maya Codices (#16)"],[1,"determine to which of these species belong the few  representations found. Several drawings, shown in Pl. 30, figs. 3, 4, 7,  8, are at once identifiable as rabbits from their long ears, round  heads, and the presence of the prominent gnawing teeth.[354-*] In two  of the figures (Pl. 30, figs. 7, 8), the entire animal is shown, sitting  erect on its haunches, the first with one ear in advance of the other, a  trait more characteristic of the jack rabbit than of the short-eared  rabbits. For convenience of comparison, we have placed beside these two  figures one of a deer in much the same position. It is at once  distinguished, however, by its long head, longer bushy tail, and by the  marks at each end of the eye. What at first sight appear to be two  gnawing teeth of the rabbit seem to be the incisors of the lower jaw.  This is the animal identified by Stempell as a dog.    The animal shown to be a rabbit in Dresden 61 (Pl. 30, fig. 8) is  pictured seated on the open jaws of a serpent in the same way as the  peccary on the following page. These two animals, together with two  representations of god B and the black god (Dresden 61), are each  clearly connected with the serpents on which they are sitting.    The Nahua day _Tochtli_ signifies rabbit and naturally the animal occurs  throughout the Mexican manuscripts as representing this day (Pl. 30,  figs. 3, 4).    OTHER RODENTS. We have included in Pl. 29, figs. 5, 7, 8, three  undetermined mammals. The second of these is characterized by the two  prominent gnawing teeth of a rodent and by its long tail. It may  represent a pack rat (_Neotoma_) of which many species are described  from Mexico. In its rounded ears and long tail, fig. 5 somewhat  resembles fig. 7, but it lacks the gnawing incisors. Still less  satisfactory is fig. 8 from Tro-Cortesianus 24d, at whose identity it  seems unsafe to hazard a guess. It is shown as eating the corn being  sowed by god D.    JAGUAR (_Felis hernandezi_; _F. h. goldmani_). Throughout its range, the  jaguar (Maya, _balam_ or _t[vs]akmul_) is the most dreaded of the  carnivorous mammals. It is, therefore, natural that the Mayas held it in  great awe and used it as a symbol of strength and courage. A few  characteristic figures are shown in Pl. 34, figs. 1-3; Pl. 35, figs.  5-14. The species represented is probably _Felis hernandezi_, the  Mexican race of jaguar, or one or the other of the more or less nominal  varieties named from Central America. The distinguishing mark of the  jaguar, in addition to the general form with the long tail, short ears  and claws, is the presence of the rosette-like spots. These are  variously conventionalized as solid black markings, as small circles, or  as a central spot ringed by a circle of dots (Pl. 35, fig. 12).  Frequently the solid black spots are used, either in a line down the  back and tail or scattered over the body. The tip of the tail is  characteristically black, and the teeth are often prominent. Such a  figure as this (Pl. 35, fig. 10) Stempell considers to be a water  opossum (_Chironectes_), for the reason that it is held by the goddess  from whose breast water is flowing. This can hardly be, however, for not  only are the markings unlike those of the water opossum, but the large  canine tooth indicates a large carnivore. Moreover, the water opossum is  a small animal, hardly as big as a rat, of shy and retiring habits, and  so is unlikely to figure in the drawings of the Mayas.    As for the significance of the jaguar in the life of the Mayas, it may  be said that this animal seems to have played a most prominent part. At  Chichen Itza, the building on top of the southern end of the eastern  wall of the Ball Court, usually called the Temple of the Tigers, has a  line of jaguars carved in stone as frieze around the outside of the  building, and in the Lower Chamber of the same structure, the figure of  a jaguar (Maudslay, III, Pl. 43) serves as an altar. The front legs and  the head of a jaguar often are seen as the support of a seat or altar on  which a god is represented as at Palenque in the Palace, House E  (Maudslay, IV, Pl. 44) and in the Temple of the Beau Relief (Holmes,  1895-1897, Pl. 20). Altar F at Copan (Pl. 35, fig. 7) shows the same  idea. The head of a puma or jaguar (Pl. 34, fig. 6) appears in the  bas-relief of the Lower Chamber of the Temple of the Tigers, evidently  representing a part of an altar. A realistic carving of a jaguar was  found on a stone near the Temple of the Cones at Chichen Itza (Maudslay,  III, Pl. 52, fig. a), and another occurs near the present hacienda of  Chichen Itza carved in relief on a ledge of rock.    In the Maya manuscripts the jaguar appears in a number of connections.  Its mythological character is shown in Dresden 8a (Pl. 35, fig. 5),  where it is pictured as the _tonalamatl_ figure. The day reached here in  the reckoning is _Ix_, and this corresponds to the Nahua _Oceolotl_,  which means jaguar. In Dresden 26, in the pages showing the ceremonies  of the years, the jaguar is carried on the back of the priest, evidently  representing one of the year bearers (_Ti cuch haab_). Balam, the name  of the jaguar, is the title given to the four _Bacabs_ or _Chacs_, the  gods of the four cardinal points. In Tro-Cortesianus 64a, two jaguar  heads are noted as the end of curious bands of _Caban_ signs over a  flaming pot. The second one is shown as dead. A jaguar head is employed  in two places in the Tro-Cortesianus, 34a and 36a, as a head-dress for a  god who is in the act of sowing corn. This animal appears very  infrequently in the pages of the Tro-Cortesianus given over to the  hunting scenes, 41c, 40c, 43b, and, even here, it never appears in the  same way as the deer and peccary, as an animal for sacrifice.    The jaguar as a predacious beast is noted in Tro-Cortesianus 28b (Pl.  35, fig. 8), where it is attacking god F in a similar way as the  vultures in the preceding picture. The jaguar appears in Tro-Cortesianus  30b (Pl. 35, fig. 10) seated on the right hand of the goddess from whose  breasts water is flowing. The figure in Tro-Cortesianus 12b between the  various offerings may be a jaguar or a dog, more probably from its  connection with an offering, the dog. A curious modification of the  jaguar may be shown in Tro-Cortesianus 20a (Pl. 34, fig. 2), where a god  is seated on the gaping jaws of some animal whose identity is uncertain.  It may be a serpent, although the black-tipped tail from which the head  appears to come certainly suggests the jaguar.    There are several carved glyphs in stone that probably represent  jaguars. Two of these (Pl. 28, fig. 4; Pl. 35, fig. 9) have the  characteristic round spots, but others are unmarked, and suggest the  jaguar by their general character only (Pl. 35, fig. 6). This latter  may, of course, represent the puma quite as well. A realistic jaguar  head appears as a glyph in Tro-Cortesianus 2a (Pl. 35, fig. 13). The  more usual glyph for the jaguar is more highly conventionalized,  although the spots and the short rounded ear are still characteristic  (Pl. 35, fig. 11). A slight modification of this glyph appears in  Dresden 8a in connection with the full drawing of the animal below.    The Nahua day _Oceolotl_, as already noted, means jaguar, and the jaguar  glyph is found among the day signs (Pl. 34, fig. 3). Seler (1904, p.  379) associates the jaguar in the Vaticanus and the Bologna with  _Tezcatlipoca_. He notes that the second age of the world, in which the  giants lived and in which _Tezcatlipoca_ shone as the sun, is called the  \"jaguar sun.\" _Tezcatlipoca_ is supposed to have changed himself into a  jaguar.    PUMA (_Felis bangsi costaricensis_). As shown by Stempell, there can be  little doubt that some one of the mainly nominal species of Central  American puma is represented in Dresden 47 (Pl. 34, fig. 7). This animal  is colored reddish in the original, as is the puma, is without spots,  although the tip of the tail, as in the pictures of the jaguar, is  black. The animal is represented as being transfixed with a  spear.[358-*] Another animal colored red in Dresden 41c seems to  represent a puma. God B is shown seated upon him. A crude figure from  the Painted Chamber of the Temple of the Tigers (Pl. 34, fig. 5) is  probably the same species of puma. The cleverly executed head, shown in  profile in Pl. 34, fig. 6, is also perhaps the same animal, although it  may possibly represent the jaguar. One or the other of these two cats is  also intended, in Pl. 34, fig. 4, a drawing of a piece of pottery.    COYOTE (_Canis_). Two figures from the Nuttall Codex have been included  as possibly representing coyotes (Pl. 35, figs. 1, 2). They are chiefly  characterized by their prominent ears and bristling hair, and seem to be  engaged in active combat. Coyotes of several species occur in Mexico and  though not generally regarded as aggressive animals are of a predacious  nature. No drawings of the coyote have been noted in the Maya codices.    DOG (_Canis_). The dog (Maya, _peq_) evidently played an important part  in the life of the Mayas as it does with other races of men generally.  On Pls. 36, 37, we have included certain figures of dogs from several  manuscripts. These may represent two breeds, for it is well known that  both a hairy and a hairless variety were found by the early discoverers  in Mexico.[359-*] Hairiness is more or less clearly indicated in the  following figures:--Pl. 36, figs. 1-7, 12; Pl. 37, figs. 4, 5. The  figures of dogs usually agree in having a black mark about the eyes that  frequently is produced as a downward curved tongue from the posterior  canthus. Sometimes, as in Pl. 37, figs. 1-3, 10, this tongue is not  blackened. Commonly also black patches are elsewhere distributed on the  body, generally on the back. These markings are probably the patches of  color separated by white areas that occur frequently in dogs or other  animals after long"]]]
