Then the boat they were watching turned out straight into the lagoon.  It was rather lighter here than in the canal, bordered on each side by  houses, and Francis did not turn the head of his gondola for a minute  or two.    \"It will be very difficult to keep them in sight out here without their  making us out,\" Giuseppi said.    \"Yes, and it is likely enough that they are only going out there in  order that they may be quite sure that they are not followed, before  striking off to the place they want to go to. They may possibly have  made us out, and guess that we are tracking them. They would be sure to  keep their eyes and ears open.\"    \"I can only just make them out now, Messer Francisco, and as we shall  have the buildings behind us, they will not be able to see us as well  as we can see them. I think we can go now.\"    \"We will risk it, at any rate, Giuseppi. I have lost sight of them  already, and it will never do to let them give us the slip.\"    They dipped their oars in the water, and the gondola darted out from  the shore. They had not gone fifty strokes when they heard the sound of  oars close at hand.    \"To the right, Giuseppi, hard!\" Francis cried as he glanced over his  shoulder.    A sweep with both oars brought the gondola's head, in a moment, almost  at right angles to the course that she had been pursuing; and the next  sent her dancing on a new line, just as a four-oared gondola swept down  upon them, missing their stern by only three or four feet. Had they  been less quick in turning, the iron prow would have cut right through  their light boat.    Giuseppi burst into a torrent of vituperation at the carelessness of  the gondoliers who had so nearly run into them, but Francis silenced  him at once.    \"Row, Giuseppi. It was done on purpose. It is the gondola the other  spoke to.\"    Their assailant was turning also, and in a few seconds was in pursuit.  Francis understood it now. The gondola they had been following had  noticed them, and had informed their friends, waiting off Saint Mark's,  of the fact. Intent upon watching the receding boat, he had paid no  further attention to the four-oared craft, which had made a turn, and  lay waiting in readiness to run them down, should they follow in the  track of the other boat.    Francis soon saw that the craft behind them was a fast one, and rowed  by men who were first-rate gondoliers. Fast as his own boat was flying  through the water, the other gained upon them steadily. He was heading  now for the entrance to the Grand Canal, for their pursuer, in the  wider sweep he had made in turning, was nearer to the Piazza than they  were, and cut off their flight in that direction.    \"Keep cool, Giuseppi,\" he said. \"They will be up to us in a minute or  two. When their bow is within a yard or two of us, and I say, 'Now!'  sweep her head straight round towards the lagoon. We can turn quicker  than they can. Then let them gain upon us, and we will then turn  again.\"    The gondola in pursuit came up hand over hand. Francis kept looking  over his shoulder, and when he saw its bow gliding up within a few feet  of her stern he exclaimed \"Now!\" and, with a sudden turn, the gondola  again swept out seaward.    Their pursuer rushed on for a length or two before she could sweep  round, while a volley of imprecations and threats burst from three men  who were standing up in her with drawn swords. Francis and Giuseppi  were now rowing less strongly, and gaining breath for their next  effort. When the gondola again came up to them they swept round to the  left, and as their pursuers followed they headed for the Grand Canal.    \"Make for the steps of Santa Maria church. We will jump out there and  trust to our feet.\"    The two lads put out all their strength now. They were some three  boats' lengths ahead before their pursuers were fairly on their track.  They were now rowing for life, for they knew that they could hardly  succeed in doubling again, and that the gondola behind them was so well  handled, that they could not gain on it at the turnings were they to  venture into the narrow channels. It was a question of speed alone, and  so hard did they row that the gondola in pursuit gained but slowly on  them, and they were still two lengths ahead when they dashed up to the  steps of the church.    Simultaneously they sprang on shore, leaped up the steps, and dashed  off at the top of their speed, hearing, as they did so, a crash as the  gondola ran into their light craft. There was a moment's delay, as the  men had to step across their boat to gain the shore, and they were  fifty yards ahead before they heard the sound of their pursuers' feet  on the stone steps; but they were lightly clad and shoeless, and  carried nothing to impede their movements, and they had therefore  little fear of being overtaken.    After racing on at the top of their speed for a few minutes, they  stopped and listened. The sound of their pursuers' footsteps died away  in the distance; and, after taking a few turns to put them off their  track, they pursued their way at a more leisurely pace.    \"They have smashed the gondola,\" Giuseppi said with a sob, for he was  very proud of the light craft.    \"Never mind the gondola,\" Francis said cheerfully. \"If they had smashed  a hundred it would not matter.\"    \"But the woman has got away and we have learned nothing,\" Giuseppi  said, surprised at his master's cheerfulness.    \"I think we have learned something, Giuseppi. I think we have learned  everything. I have no doubt the girls are confined in that hut on San  Nicolo. I wonder I never thought of it before; but I made so sure that  they would be taken somewhere close to where Mocenigo was staying, that  it never occurred to me that they might hide them out there. I ought to  have known that that was just the thing they would do, for while the  search would be keen among the islets near the land, and the villages  there, no one would think of looking for them on the seaward islands.    \"I have no doubt they are there now. That woman came ashore to report  to his friends, and that four-oared boat which has chased us was in  waiting off Saint Mark's, to attack any boat that might be following  them.    \"We will go to Signor Polani at once and tell him what has happened. I  suppose it is about one o'clock now, but I have not noticed the hour.  It was past eleven before we first met the gondola, and we must have  been a good deal more than an hour lying there waiting for them.\"    A quarter of an hour's walking took them to the palazzo of Polani. They  rang twice at the bell at the land entrance, before a face appeared at  the little window of the door, and asked who was there.    \"I wish to see Signor Polani at once,\" Francis said.    \"The signor retired to rest an hour ago,\" the man said.    \"Never mind that,\" Francis replied. \"I am Francis Hammond, and I have  important news to give him.\"    As soon as the servitor recognized Francis' voice, he unbarred the  door.    \"Have you news of the ladies?\" he asked eagerly.    \"I have news which will, I hope, lead to something,\" Francis replied.    A moment later the voice of Polani himself, who, although he had  retired to his room, had not yet gone to sleep, was heard at the top of  the grand stairs, inquiring who it was who had come so late; for  although men had been arriving all day, with reports from the various  islands and villages, he thought that no one would come at this hour  unless his news were important.    Francis at once answered:    \"It is I, Signor Polani, Francis Hammond. I have news which I think may  be of importance, although I may be mistaken. Still, it is certainly  news that may lead to something.\"    The merchant hurried down.    \"What is it, Francisco? What have you learned?\"    \"I have seen the woman Castaldi, and have followed her. I do not know  for certain where she was going, for we have been chased by a large  gondola, and have narrowly escaped with our lives. Still, I have a clue  to their whereabouts.\"    Francis then related the events of the evening.    \"But why did you not run into the boat and give the alarm at once,  Francisco? Any gondolas passing would have given their assistance, when  you declared who she was, for the affair is the talk of the city. If  that woman were in our power we should soon find means to make her  speak.\"    \"Yes, signor; but the moment she was known to be in your power, you may  be sure that they would remove your daughters from the place where they  have been hiding them. I thought, therefore, the best plan would be to  track them. No doubt we should have succeeded in doing so, had it not  been for the attack upon us by another gondola.\"    \"You are right, no doubt, Francisco. Still, it is unfortunate, for I do  not see that we are now any nearer than we were before, except that we  know that this woman is in the habit of coming into the city.\"    \"I think we are nearer, sir, for I had an adventure some time ago that  may afford a clue to their hiding place.\"    He then told the merchant how he had, one evening, taken a man out to  San Nicolo, and had discovered that a hut in that island was used as a  meeting place by various persons, among whom was Ruggiero Mocenigo.    \"I might have thought of the place before, signor; but, in fact, it  never entered my mind. From the first, we considered it so certain that  the men who carried off your daughters would take them to some hiding  place where Mocenigo could speedily join them, that San Nicolo never  entered my mind. I own that it was very stupid, for it seems now to me  that the natural thing for them to do, would be to take them in the  very opposite direction to that in which the search "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/17567"],[0,"The Way of the Wild (#16)"],[1," and cold.  Now, what is one to say of  such a cat?    [Illustration: \"Landed full upon the dumbfounded water-vole--splash!\"]      III    Long did the keepers, in Colonel Lymington's woods and along the  hedges, search with dog and gun for Pharaoh, and many traps did they  set.  The dogs truly found a cat--two cats, and the guns stopped them,  but one had a nice blue ribbon round his neck, and the other had  kittens; the traps were found by one cat--and that was the pet of the  colonel's lady--one stoat, one black \"Pom\"--and that was the idol of  the parson's daughter--and one vixen--and she was buried secretly and  at night--but Pharaoh remained where he had chosen to remain, and he  remained also an enigma.    Then the colonel's rare birds began to evaporate in real earnest.  Hawkley's little efforts at depleting them were child's-play to those  of Pharaoh that followed, although, of course, Pharaoh himself did not  know, or care the twitch of a whisker, whether the birds he slew were  rare or not.    Now, if there was one thing more than another about which the colonel  prided himself in his bird sanctuary, it was the presence of the  bittern.  I don't know where the bittern came from, nor does the  colonel.  Perhaps the head-keeper knew.  Bitterns migrate sometimes,  but--well, that keeper was no fool, and knew his master's soft spot.    It was a night or two later that Pharaoh surmounted the limit, so to  speak, and \"sprung all mines in quick succession.\"  He had been curled  up all day in his furze fortress, that vast stretch of prickly  impenetrability which, even if a dog had been found with pluck enough  to push through to its heart, would still, in its massed and tangled  boughs, have given a cat with Pharaoh's fighting prowess full chance to  defy any dog.    He was beautifully oblivious of the stir his previous doings had kicked  up, and of the winged words the colonel had used to the head-keeper; of  the traps set all about, of the gins doubled and trebled in the wood  and round the park, and of the under-keepers who, with guns and  tempting baits, took up their positions to wait for him as night fell.    No one seemed to have suspected the furze a mile away, and still less  the marsh and the coverless bleak shore of the estuary, as his home.  Indeed, no one looks for a cat on a wind-whipped marsh when woods are  near at all.  Yet this open, wet country seemed to be a peculiarly  favorite hunting-ground of Pharaoh's.    It was a night of rain-squalls and moonlit streaks when Pharaoh,  wandering devious among the reeds, first became aware of the bittern,  in the shape of reptilian green eyes steadily regarding him from the  piebald shadows.  Possibly the cat's whiskers first hinted at some new  presence by reason of the \"ancient and fish-like smell\" which pervaded  this precise reed jungle.    Pharaoh stopped dead.  Pharaoh, with cruel, thin ears pressed back,  sank like a wraith into the soft ground.  Pharaoh ceased to be even a  grayish-yellow, smoky something, and became nothing but eyes--eyes  floating and wicked.  A domestic cat, after one frozen interval, would  have crept away from the foe it could not fathom, but Pharaoh had other  blood in his veins.    To begin with, he was wondering what manner of beast the owner of those  saurian-like orbs might be.  To go on with, he was hungry, and--smelt  fish.  But though he was looking full at the big bird, he could not see  it, which is the bittern's own private little bit of magic.    Nature has given him a coat just like a bunch of dried reeds and the  shadows between, and he does the rest by standing with his bead stuck  straight up and as still as a brass idol.  Result--invisibility.    None know how long those two sought to \"outfreeze\" the \"freezer,\" while  the rain-showers came up and passed hissing, and the moon played at  hide-and-seek.  None knew when Pharaoh, flat as a snake, first began  that deadly, silent circling, which was but acting in miniature the  ways of the lion.  None knew, either, at what point of bittern first  begun to sink and sink, till he crouched, and puffed, his neck curved  on his back like a spring ready set, his beak, like a sharpened  assegai, upright.    Only the short-eared owl, with his wonderful eyes, beheld Pharaoh make  his final rush; watched that living spring _sprung_ quick as light,  shooting out straight at the cat's glaring eyes, and saw--greatest  miracle of all the lot--Pharaoh dodge his head aside in the twentieth  of a second, and blink, letting the blow that spelt death whiz by.    And only those same owl's ears--sharpest of all the ears of the  wild--heard the diabolical yell of Pharaoh as the long, sharp beak  pierced through the loose skin of his shoulders, and, thanks to that  same looseness, came out again an inch or two farther on, transfixing  him; or listened to the devilish noise of the \"worry,\" as the cat  turned in agony on himself and buried his fangs where he could behind  those expressionless green reptilian eyes; or caught the stupendous  flurry and whirl of wings and fur and gripping claws and scaly legs, as  a cloud put out the moon and darkness fell with silence, like the  falling curtain that ends a play.          *      *      *      *      *      *    The very last pale rays of a watery setting sun slid bar-like through  the cottage window, and fell, twirling, aslant the floor.    A late spider had spun a web across the fireplace, and the one last fly  that always lingers sat in the sunbeam.  It was Hawkley's cottage,  dismantled and derelict.    Something like a furry round hassock, lying motionless in a far corner,  moved at the sound of rain, and lifted a round head with round eyes  that glared with so terrible an expression that one caught one's  breath.  There was blood--dried blood--by the furry shape, and drops of  dried blood across the floor from the window in the next room, that it  had been nobody's business to shut.    The day went out in gloom and howling rain-rushes.  Darkness took  possession of the room.  And--_the gate clicked_.    Truly, it might only have been the wind, but--Pharaoh was on his feet  in a flash, growling, and there was a glint of green-yellow light as  his eyes whipped round.    Followed a pause.  Then, in a lull, once, twice, the unmistakable  crunch of a shod foot on gravel.    Another pause.  Pharaoh was crouching close now, trembling from head to  foot.    \"Pharaoh!  Pharaoh!  Pharaoh, old cat, are--are you in there?\"    The voice, strained and husky, came in at the open window.  In the last  lingering afterglow of dying day, a face, haggard and set, showed  there, framed in the lead casement.    \"Phar----  Ah!\"    Pharaoh was up.  Pharaoh had given a strange, coaxing little cry, such  as a she-cat gives to her kittens.  Pharaoh, lame and stiff, but with  tail straight as a poker, was running to the window in the next room,  was up on the sill, was rubbing against and caressing the haggard face  like a mad thing.    There was a long, tense pause, broken only by a continuous purring.  Then the creaking sound as of the lid of a wicker basket being opened.  The purring ceased.  The creaking came again, as if the lid were being  shut.  There came the crunch once more of stealthy shod feet on gravel,  the click of the gate, and--silence!    Hawkley had come for, and found, his cat.          VI    THE CRIPPLE    It was gradually getting colder and colder as he flew, till at last, in  a wonderful, luminous, clear, moonlit sunset, when day passed,  lingering almost imperceptibly, into night, the wind fixed in the  north, and a hard white frost shone on the glistening roofs--far, far  below.    Up there, at the three-thousand or four-thousand feet level, where he  was flying, the air was as clear and sparkling as champagne, and as  still as the tomb.  If he had been passing over the moon instead of  over the earth, the effect would have been something like it, perhaps.    He was only a thrush, _Turdus philomelus_ the songster, but big and  dull and dark for his kind, and he had come from--well, behind him, all  shimmering and restless in the moonlight, like a fountain-basin full of  quicksilver, lay the North Sea; ahead and beneath lay England; and  across that sea, three hundred miles, as I count it, at the very least,  to the lands of melting snow, he was going when late cold weather had  caught him and warned him to come back.  And alone?  No, sirs, not  quite.  Ahead, just visible, blurredly--a little phantom form rose and  fell on the magic air; behind, another; on his right, a third--all  thrushes, flying steadily westward in silence; and there may have been  a few more that could not be seen, or there may not.    His crop, as were the crops of the others, was perfectly empty.  Indeed, he appeared to prefer traveling in ballast that way.  But his  eyes shone, and his wing-strokes, with little pauses of rigidity  between, such as many birds take--only one doesn't notice it much--were  strong and sure.    Once a large-winged, smudged shape, making no sound as it slipped  across the heavens, came flapping almost up to him, peering this way  and that at him and his companions, with amber flaming eyes set in a  cat-like, oval face.  The thrush's heart gave a great jump, and seemed  threatening to choke him, for that shape--and it howled at him  suddenly, in a voice calculated to make strong men jump--was death of  the night, otherwise a short-eared owl.    But a gun went \"boomp!\" with that thick, damp sort of sound that smacks  of black powder, somewhere down on earth, and a huge \"herd\" of green  plover, _alias_ peewits, which are lapwings, rose, as if blown up by an  explosion, to meet them, their thousand wings flickering in the  frost-haze like a shower of confetti, and the owl was so disconcerted  by the disturbance that he dropped back into the night whence he came,  as one who falls into a sea.    Then suddenly the thrush--all the"]]]
