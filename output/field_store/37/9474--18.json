This showed justice and courage, and  a good \"nerve\" too. In some armies, I suspect, the Turk would have been  shot, or hanged first and left to explain afterwards, if he could. And  this was among the Bulgarians, who some insist are a bloodthirsty,  cut-throat race, with no sense of justice or of mercy!          CHAPTER VIII    INCIDENTS OF BULGARIAN CHARACTER      Some further incidents of Bulgarian life gleaned during war-time will  illustrate the national characteristics of the people.    Peter was a secretary-servant whom I engaged at Sofia to accompany me to  the front because he could speak English, a language he had learned at  the Robert (American) College in Constantinople, where he was educated.  Peter was to be partly a secretary, partly a servant. He was to  interpret for me, translate Bulgarian papers and documents, also to cook  and to carry if need be. He was destined to be a lawyer, and was the son  of a small trader.    [Illustration: A PEASANT OF THE TSARIBROD DISTRICT]    Peter was interesting as illustrating the transition stage between the  Bulgarian peasant (for whom I have the heartiest admiration) and the  Bulgarian statesman, diplomat, \"personage\" (for whom I have  not--generally speaking and with particular exceptions--nearly so much  admiration). He had not lost the peasant virtues. He was loyal, plucky,  patriotic. But he had lost the good health and the practical knowledge  of life of the peasant stock from which he sprang.    The Bulgarian on the land lives a laborious life, bread and cheese his  usual sole food, with a little meat as a rare treat, and a glass of  vodka as his indulgence for Sundays and feast days only. Marrying early  he is astonishingly fecund. Transfer him to town life and he soon shows  a weakening in physical fibre. The streets sap away his field-bred  health. A more elaborate diet attacks the soundness of his almost bovine  digestion. There is no greater contrast between the Bulgarian peasant on  the land, physically the healthiest type one could imagine, and the  Bulgarian town resident, who has not yet learned to adapt himself to the  conditions of closely hived life and shows a marked susceptibility to  dyspepsia, phthisis, and neurasthenia. The Bulgarian peasant has the  nerves, the digestion of an ox. The Bulgarian town-dweller, the son or  grandson of that peasant, might pass often for the tired-out progeny of  many generations of city workers.    Peter could not serve in the army because his lungs were affected. That  was why he was available as my secretary-servant. Peter was, as regards  any practical knowledge of life, the most pathetically useless young man  one could imagine. He could make coffee, after the Turkish fashion, and  had equipped himself for a long campaign with a most elaborate coffee  machine, all glass and gimcrackery, which of course did not survive one  day's travel. But he had not brought food nor cooking pots nor knife nor  fork nor spoon: no blankets had he, and no change of clothing--just the  coffee-pot, a picture of a saint, and an out-of-date book of Bulgarian  statistics, which he solemnly presented to me, with his name  affectionately inscribed on the fly-leaf. I dared not throw it away, and  so had to carry its useless bulk about with me until Peter and I parted.  In addition to his lack of equipment, Peter could not roll a rug, make a  bed, or fend for himself in any way.    The Bulgarian peasant in his life on the land is on the whole a very  clever chap as regards the practical things of existence. During the  campaign I noticed how he made himself very comfortable. Whenever he was  stationed as a guard for a railway bridge or in any other  semi-permanent post, he half-dug, half-thatched himself an excellent  shelter. He made use for food supplies of every scrap of eatable stuff  that came his way, and could do wonders in the manipulation and repair  of an ox-cart. But clearly these simple skills do not survive town life.  Peter was only one example of many that I encountered. The problem that  troubles Bulgaria to-day and will trouble her for some time to come is  that of finding from her almost exclusively peasant population enough  statesmen, lawyers, priests, teachers, leaders generally who will have  substituted for peasant virtues and peasant abilities the _savoir faire_  of the cultivated European. They show a tendency to lose the one before  they gain the other.    My life with Peter was brief. He was such a good fellow that I was quite  willing to retain him, even though I had to be the servant really, and  his services were only useful as interpreter. But his health improved.  Possibly the better food and the open-air regime that I insisted upon  were responsible. Peter became healthy enough to do something for the  army and, of course, he went away to do that something. Though he had  become a good deal devoted to me his chief devotion was to his country.  I honoured him for deserting me.    Incidents of the mobilisation of the troops showed this strong and  general patriotic ardour. At the call this trained nation was in arms in  a day. The citizen soldiers hurried to the depots for their arms and  uniforms. In one district the rumour that mobilisation had been  authorised was bruited abroad a day before the actual issue of the  orders, and the depot was besieged by the peasants who had rushed in  from their farms. The officer in charge could not give out the rifles,  so the men lit fires, got food from the neighbours, and camped around  the depot until they were armed. Some navvies received their  mobilisation orders on returning to their camp after ten hours' work at  railway-building. They had supper and marched through the night to their  respective headquarters. For one soldier, the march was twenty-four  miles. The railway carriages were not adequate to bring all the men to  their assigned centres. Some rode on the steps, on the roofs of  carriages, on the buffers even.    At Stara Zagora I noted a mother of the people who had come to see some  Turkish prisoners just brought in from Mustapha Pasha. To one she gave  a cake. \"They are hungry,\" she said. This woman had five men at the war,  her four sons in the fighting-line, her husband under arms guarding a  line of communication. She had sent them proudly. It was the boast of  the Bulgarian women that not a tear was shed at the going away of the  soldiers.    At a little village outside Kirk Kilisse a young civil servant, an  official of the Foreign Office, spoke of the war whilst we ate a dish of  cheese and eggs. \"It is a war,\" he said, \"of the peasants and the  intellectuals. It is not a war made by the politicians or the soldiers  of the staff. That would be impossible. In our nation every soldier is a  citizen and every citizen a soldier. There could not be a war, unless it  were a war desired by the people. In my office it was with rage that  some of the clerks heard that they must stay at Sofia, and not go to the  front. We were all eager to take arms.\"    At Nova Zagora, travelling by a troop train carrying reserves to the  front, I crossed a train bringing wounded from the battlefields. For  some hours both trains were delayed. The men going to the front were  decorated with flowers as though going to a feast. They filled the  waiting time by dancing to the music of the national bagpipes, and  there joined in the dance such of the wounded as could stand on their  feet.    At Mustapha Pasha I arrived one night from Stara Zagora with a great  body of correspondents. With me I had brought about a week's supply of  food, leaving other supplies with my heavy baggage. But on the train  journey, taking up a full day, this supply disappeared. No one else  seemed to have food supplies handy, and I fed all I could, including a  Bulgarian bishop (who showed his gratitude afterwards by \"cutting me  dead\" when it was in his power to do me a slight favour). When we  reached Mustapha Pasha it was to find no hotels, lodging-houses, cafes,  or stores. All the food supplies had been requisitioned by the Bulgarian  military authorities. There was plenty of food in the town but none  could be bought. I tried to get a loaf of bread from a military bakery,  offering to the soldier in charge up to five francs for a loaf. He was  sturdily proof against bribes. But subsequently I was given a loaf for  nothing on the ground that I was \"in distress\"; as indeed I was, though  with L100 in my pocket.    Between Silivri and Ermenikioi, travelling with a fine equipment for  the time being--a cart and two good horses and a full supply of food,  purchased at Tchorlu and Silivri--I was eating lunch by the roadside  when four Bulgarian soldiers came up and with signs told me that they  were starving, and asked for food. They had become separated from their  regiment and, I gathered, had had no food for two days. They were armed  with rifles and bayonets and could have taken from me all they needed if  they had wished. But that thought did not seem to have entered their  heads. I gave them a meal and a little bread and cheese to see them on  their way. One of these poor peasant soldiers fumbled in his purse and  brought out some coppers, wishing to pay for what he had had.    Repeatedly in my travels I would come at nightfall to some little  vedette outpost and be made welcome of the officers' Mess. That meant  sharing their meal, whatever it was,--a very poor one sometimes. After  the main dish I would bring out dates and biscuits, of which I had a  small store, to find usually that the Bulgarian officers would refuse to  trench upon my supplies, as I was going forward \"to the front\" and  would need them. That was not the attitude of savages but of gentlemen.    These and a score of similar incidents showed me the Bulgarian national  character as kind, honest, patient, courageous. They made it"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/22260"],[0,"Bell's Cathedrals: The Abbey Church of Tewkesbury (#16)"],[1,"s) will be seen a round-headed doorway, which gave  access to the choir from the aisles. They were walled up at an early  date, as they were probably too narrow for processional use.    Since the restoration of the choir the old stalls of the monks have  been collected from the various places in the church to which they had  been removed, and placed in their present position across the arches  of the tower, eleven on the north side and twelve on the south. Those  on the north have lost most of their misericordes, and all the canopy  work. Those on the south side are more perfect, and the backs are in  better preservation, though the plain panels have been removed.    In the majority of the misericordes the carving, originally fanciful,  has suffered at the hands of bigots. It is only possible to conjecture  what the stalls were like in monastic times, but they were probably,  though less elaborate, similar to those at Gloucester. As carvings  they cannot be compared with those at the Priory Church of Great  Malvern.      THE TOMBS AND CHANTRIES.    One of the chief glories of Tewkesbury consists in the series of  historic tombs and chantries which encircle the choir and presbytery  and the surrounding ambulatory. It may safely be asserted that in no  church, with the single exception of Westminster Abbey, can such a  noble collection of sepulchral monuments be found. They are well  worthy of detailed study, and for that reason have been grouped  together in one section. It is not possible to examine or describe  them adequately from the ambulatory only, and the most important are  best viewed from the choir or presbytery, whence access to the  chantries is obtained.    All these tombs have suffered terrible mutilation at the hands of  fanatics and bigots, but it is surprising to find how much of what was  really fine pierced work, almost as delicate as lace, has survived the  zeal of the destroyers. Close inspection will show that a considerable  amount of repair and refitting has been done in places. It must have  been a task of great difficulty, and involved that \"infinite capacity  for taking pains\" of which we hear so much but find so seldom; and  considering the date (1825) at which this piece of genuine restoration  was done, more praise must be given to the restorer. Had it not been  undertaken then it might have been done later, and certainly not so  lovingly, and possibly not so well.    =Warwick Chapel.=--This beautiful piece of work [A in the plan] is a  chantry chapel, erected in 1422 by Isabelle le Despenser, to the  memory of her first husband, Richard Beauchamp, Earl of Abergavenny  and Worcester, or, as the chronicle calls him, Ricardus de Bello  Campo. It is situate, as will be seen from the plan, under the  westernmost arch of the north side of the choir. An inscription, which  is only legible here and there, runs round the moulding: \"Mementote  dne Isabelle le Despenser, Cometisse de Warrewyk, quae hanc capellam  fundavit in honor[~e] bte Marie Magdalene, et obiit Londiniis apud  Mn[~e]s a[~o] dni MCCCCXXXIX. die Scti Jhis Evngste. Et sepulta est  [~i] choro [~i] dextra patris sui: cuj. a[~m]e ppitietur Deus. Amen\"  (_i.e._, \"Be mindful of the Lady Isabelle Despenser, Countess of  Warwick, who founded this chapel to the honour of St. Mary Magdalen,  and died in London in the Minories, A.D. 1439, on St. John the  Evangelist's Day. And was buried in the choir on the right hand of her  father. On whose soul may God have pity. Amen\").    The chapel was dedicated in the names of St. Mary Magdalen, St.  Barbara, and St. Leonard just two years after Richard Beauchamp had  died.    This Richard Beauchamp, after whom in truth the chapel should be  called, had shown his bravery at Agincourt in 1415, and in 1420 been  made Earl of Worcester. He was slain at the siege of Meaux, in France,  in 1421. In Dyde's \"History of Tewkesbury\" it is spoken of as \"Mary  Magdalen's Chapel, now commonly called 'Spenser's Chapel.\" It may have  been designed to surpass in glory the chantries previously existing in  the building, and if so, the Countess, who was only twenty-one years  of age, spared no expense in causing this beautiful work to be made.    The chapel consists of two parts or stories, the lower of which has a  door into the north aisle as well as into the choir. The lowest  portion or base on either side consists of figures of angels, much  mutilated, bearing shields.    The chantry has two roofs, both with fine vaulting, formerly richly  painted, but the lower roof only covers the western half of the  chapel. The pendent bosses have been destroyed. At the top the canopy  work is so delicately sculptured that it resembles lace.    The lower ceiling, extending over half the chapel, consists of large  and small circles. Of these, the larger ones are ribbed with sixteen  ribs, while the smaller ones are quatrefoils, each member being  composed of a trefoil with an elegantly carved cusp. Between these  smaller circles are still smaller ones composed of quatrefoils. This  ceiling is supported by two slender shafts. Along the exposed front of  the ceiling are four double cinquefoil arches, between which were  three busts. Of these, one only, viz., an angel with a scroll,  remains.    In the upper storey of the chapel the ceiling is made up of hexagons  and octagons, the intervening space being filled up with circles,  trefoils of irregular shapes, though symmetrically disposed, and  quatrefoils. The points of the pendant have been ruthlessly destroyed.       [Illustration: _Photo. A.H. Hughes._     THE WARWICK CHAPEL.]    Of this chantry Mr. Knight wrote: \"There can be but one opinion on the  praise which belongs to the exquisiteness of finishing by which the  several parts of it are distinguished; the entablature, wedged between  two of the old pillars of the choir, and appearing to rest upon light  columnar buttresses of singular beauty, give us an assemblage of  filigree and fretwork, which may vie with the finest specimens of  similar workmanship in the kingdom: the elegant palm-leaved parapet,  which occurs in the division between the storeys,--the numerous  escutcheons blazoned in their proper colours,--the niches, and  pedestals, under their respective canopies, once ornamented with  figures which fanaticism has dislodged,--the slender shafts supporting  a higher apartment, probably the rood-loft, in the inside of the  fabric, from whence half-figures of angels are seen to issue,--the  pendants dropping, like congelations in a grotto, from a roof adorned  with the most delicate tracery spread over it like a web,--these and a  countless multitude of minuter beauties, almost distract attention,  and overwhelm the judgment with their different claims to notice.\"    Some have thought the upper portion was intended to serve as a private  pew for the Lady Isabelle. To this the difficulty of access may well  be urged as a valid objection. Others have thought that the upper part  was a rood-loft. Others again have thought that the half-roof was a  platform upon which a kneeling figure (in imitation of that in the  Trinity Chapel) was placed.[25] By her will the Lady Isabelle gave  instructions that her statue was to be placed on the right hand of her  father in the choir, and that it was to represent her entirely naked  (_i.e._ without any state robes), with her hair cast backwards; with  St. Mary Magdalen (one of the saints to whom the chapel was dedicated)  laying her hands across: with St. John the Evangelist on her right  side and St. Anthony on her left. At her feet there was to be an  escutcheon, bearing her arms impaled with those of her late  husband--who had died just three months before her--supported by two  griffins; and at the side there were to be statues of poor men and  women in humble apparel with their beads in their hands. From the  Abbey Register this part of the lady's last will and testament seems  to have been carried out; but nothing remains of these added figures  or of the tomb. The chapel is less perfect on the south, or choir  side, than on that which faces the north aisle.    The appearance of the chantry when first finished, with all its rich  colour and profuse gilding, must have been very rich. Some have  thought it too elaborate and overweighted with ornament, but we may  well call it one of the most glorious specimens of its time.    Among the heraldic decorations are to be found the chevrons of the  Clares, and the arms of the deceased Earl. On the outside are to be  traced the arms of the royal ancestors of Isabelle, of the Clares, and  of the Despensers.    The arms upon the chapel are given in \"Neale's Views of Tewkesbury\" as  follows:    On the side of the chapel next the choir, over the door--      1. France and England, quarterly, King Edward III.      2. Castile and Leon, quarterly, and Peter, King of Castile and        Leon.      3. France and England, quarterly, Edmund of Langley, Duke of York.      4. France and England impaling Castile and Leon--for Isabelle of        Castile, Duchess of York.      5. Clare quartering Despenser (Thomas Despenser, Earl of        Gloucester).      6. Clare quartering Despenser and impaling France and England        (Constance, the mother of the foundress of the chapel).    On the side next to the aisle--in the basement or lowest portion and  in the first division, three angels bearing shields--(1) as 1 above;  (2) destroyed but presumably as 2 above; (3) as 3 above.    In the second division, two angels bearing shields--(1) as 4 above;  (2) as 5 above.    In the third division, two angels bearing shields--(1) France and  England quarterly in chief.    The arms on the fascia and over the door are, in each compartment,  three:      1. The royal arms of England.      2. The arms of the Clares, Earls of Gloucester.      3. Clare impaling England (Isabel, Countess of Gloucester, and        John, afterwards King of England).      4."]]]
