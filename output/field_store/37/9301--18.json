No part of the body is  so well supplied with blood as the lungs.                                    [Fig. 40]      Fig. 40--*The pleurae.* Diagram showing the general form of the pleural sacs  as they surround the lungs and line the inner surfaces of the chest (other    parts removed). _A, A'._ Places occupied by the lungs. _B, B'._ Slight   space within the pleural sacs containing the pleural secretion, _a, a'._     Outer layer of pleura and lining of chest walls and upper surface of  diaphragm. _b, b'._ Inner layer of pleura and outer lining of lungs. _C._                 Space occupied by the heart. _D._ Diaphragm.      *The Pleura.*--The pleura is a thin, smooth, elastic, and tough membrane  which covers the outside of the lungs and lines the inside of the chest  walls. The covering of each lung is continuous with the lining of the  chest wall on its respective side and forms with it a closed sac by which  the lung is surrounded, the arrangement being similar to that of the  pericardium. Properly speaking, there are two pleurae, one for each lung,  and these, besides inclosing the lungs, partition off a middle space which  is occupied by the heart (Fig. 40). They also cover the upper surface of  the diaphragm, from which they deflect upward, blending with the  pericardium. A small amount of liquid is secreted by the pleura, which  prevents friction as the surfaces glide over each other in breathing.    *The Thorax.*--The force required for breathing is supplied by the box-like  portion of the body in which the lungs are placed. This is known as the  thorax, or chest, and includes that part of the trunk between the neck and  the abdomen. The space which it incloses, known as the thoracic cavity, is  a _variable_ space and the walls surrounding this space are _air-tight._ A  framework for the thorax is supplied by the ribs which connect with the  spinal column behind and with the sternum, or breast-bone, in front. They  form joints with the spinal column, but connect with the sternum by strips  of cartilage. The ribs do not encircle the cavity in a horizontal  direction, but slope downward from the spinal column both toward the front  and toward the sides, this being necessary to the service which they  render in breathing.    *How Air is Brought into and Expelled from the Lungs.*--The principle  involved in breathing is that air flows from a place of _greater_ to a  place of _less_ pressure. The construction of the thorax and the  arrangement of the lungs within it provide for the application of this  principle in a most practical manner. The lungs are suspended from the  upper portion of the thoracic cavity, and the trachea and the upper air  passages provide the only opening to the outside atmosphere. Air entering  the thorax must on this account pass into the lungs. As the thorax is  enlarged the air in the lungs expands, and there is produced within them a  place of _slightly less_ air pressure than that of the atmosphere on the  outside of the body. This difference causes the air to flow into the  lungs.                                    [Fig. 41]       Fig. 41--*Diagram illustrating the bellows principle in breathing.* _A._       The human bellows. _B._ The hand bellows. Compare part for part.      When the thorax is diminished in size, the air within the lungs is  slightly compressed. This causes it to become denser and to exert on this  account a pressure _slightly greater_ than that of the atmosphere on the  outside. The air now flows out until the equality of the pressure is again  restored. Thus the thorax, by making the pressure within the lungs first  slightly less and then slightly greater than the atmospheric pressure,  causes the air to move into and out of the lungs.    Breathing is well illustrated by means of the common hand bellows, its  action being similar to that of the thorax. It will be observed that when  the sides are spread apart air flows into the bellows. When they are  pressed together the air flows out. If an air-tight sack were hung in the  bellows with its mouth attached to the projecting tube, the arrangement  would resemble closely the general plan of the breathing organs (Fig. 41).  One respect, however, in which the bellows differs from the thorax should  be noted. The thorax is never sufficiently compressed to drive out all the  air. Air is always present in the lungs. This keeps them more or less  distended and pressed against the thoracic walls.    *How the Thoracic Space is Varied.*--One means of varying the size of the  thoracic cavity is through the movements of the ribs and their resultant  effect upon the walls of the thorax. In bringing about these movements the  following muscles are employed:    1. The _scaleni_ muscles, three in number on each side, which connect at  one end with the vertebrae of the neck and at the other with the first and  second ribs. Their contraction slightly raises the upper portion of the  thorax.    2. The _elevators of the ribs_, twelve in number on each side, which are  so distributed that each single muscle is attached, at one end, to the  back portion of a rib and, at the other, to a projection of the vertebra a  few inches above. The effect of their contraction is to' elevate the  middle portion of the ribs and to turn them outward or spread them apart.    3. The _intercostal_ muscles, which form two thin layers between the ribs,  known as the _internal_ and the _external_ intercostal muscles. The  external intercostals are attached between the outer lower margin of the  rib above and the outer upper margin of the rib below, and extend  obliquely downward and forward. The internal intercostals are attached  between the inner margins of adjacent ribs, and they extend obliquely  downward and backward from the front. The contraction of the external  intercostal muscles raises the ribs, and the contraction of the internal  intercostals tends to lower them.                                    [Fig. 42]        Fig. 42--*Simple apparatus* for illustrating effect of movements of the   ribs upon the thoracic space; strips of cardboard held together by pins,       the front part being raised or lowered by threads moving through     attachments at 1 and 2. As the front is raised the space between the   uprights is increased. The front upright corresponds to the breastbone,  the back one to the spinal column, the connecting strips to the ribs, and                   the threads to the intercostal muscles.      By slightly raising and spreading apart the ribs the thoracic space is  increased in two directions--from front to back and from side to side.  Lowering and converging the ribs has, of course, the opposite effect (Fig.  42). Except in forced expirations the ribs are lowered and converged by  their own weight and by the elastic reaction of the surrounding parts.    *The Diaphragm.*--Another means of varying the thoracic space is found in  an organ known as the diaphragm. This is the dome-shaped, _movable  partition_ which separates the thoracic cavity from the cavity of the  abdomen. The edges of the diaphragm are firmly attached to the walls of  the trunk, and the center is supported by the pericardium and the pleura.  The outer margin is muscular, but the central portion consists of a strong  sheet of connective tissue. By the contraction of its muscles the  diaphragm is pulled down, thereby increasing the thoracic cavity. By  raising the diaphragm the thoracic cavity is diminished.    The diaphragm, however, is not raised by the contraction of its own  muscles, but _is pushed up_ by the organs beneath. By the elastic reaction  of the abdominal walls (after their having been pushed out by the lowering  of the diaphragm), pressure is exerted on the organs of the abdomen and  these in turn press against the diaphragm. This crowds it into the  thoracic space. In forced expirations the muscles in the abdominal walls  contract to push up the diaphragm.    *Interchange of Gases in the Lungs.*--During each inspiration the air from  the outside fills the entire system of bronchial tubes, but the alveoli  are largely filled, at the same time, by the air which the last expiratory  effort has left in the passages. By the action of currents and eddies and  by the rapid diffusion of gas particles, the air from the outside mixes  with that in the alveoli and comes in contact with the membranous walls.  Here the oxygen, after being dissolved by the moisture in the membrane,  diffuses into the blood. The carbon dioxide, on the other hand, being in  excess in the blood, diffuses toward the air in the alveoli. The  interchange of gases at the lungs, however, is not fully understood, and  it is possible that other forces than osmosis play a part.                                    [Fig. 43]                    Fig. 43--*Diagram* illustrating lung capacity.      *Capacity of the Lungs.*--The air which passes into and from the lungs in  ordinary breathing, called the _tidal_ air, is but a small part of the  whole amount of air which the lungs contain. Even after a forced  expiration the lungs are almost half full; the air which remains is called  the _residual_ air. The air which is expelled from the lungs by a forced  expiration, less the tidal air, is called the _reserve_, or supplemental,  air. These several quantities are easily estimated. (See Practical Work.)  In the average individual the total capacity of the lungs (with the chest  in repose) is about one gallon. In forced inspirations this capacity may  be increased about one third, the excess being known as the _complemental_  air (Fig. 43).                                    [Fig. 44]      Fig. 44--*Diagram* illustrating internal respiration and its dependence on           external respiration. (Modified from Hall.) (See text.)      *Internal, or Cell, Respiration.*--The oxygen which enters the blood in the  lungs leaves it in the tissues, passing through the lymph into the cells  (Fig"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/18790"],[0,"The Insect Folk (#16)"],[1,"they need to grow on, and the rest escapes from the  insect's body in the form of \"honey dew.\" It is a sweet liquid of which  ants and bees are very fond.    What, John, you have heard that the aphids give out honey dew from two  little horns near the tip of the abdomen?    Let us see if we can find these horns. Yes, we can see them plainly, and  _very_ plainly with a magnifying glass.    But now listen; the honey dew does not come from the horns. On the end  of some of the horns, or tubes, we can see a drop of clear liquid.    For a long time people believed this was honey dew, but instead, it is a  waxy substance which is not sweet.    It has been very carefully studied by wise men who tell us it contains  no sugar and is probably used as a means of defence, as aphides have  been seen to smear the faces of insect enemies with this wax.    There are a great many species of aphides, and not all of them have the  little tubes or horns on their backs. But probably many that have no  horns give forth honey dew.    It is really a waste substance from the body of the aphid.    Ants are so fond of the honey dew that certain species of aphides have  been called the _ants' cows_, because the ants take care of them for the  sake of the honey dew.    Some ants protect the aphids from their enemies. They drive off those  insects that would devour the aphids, and when winter comes these ants  carry the aphids down into their warm nests under ground, and keep them  safe through the cold weather.    The aphides cannot stand wet weather, but after a long spell of dry  weather they will be found in great abundance.    [Illustration]    Sometimes they eat so fast and so much that the honey dew falls like a  shower from the trees upon which they are. It covers the ground beneath  and the leaves of plants, and makes everything very sticky and  disagreeable to the touch. The dust settles on it, too and a growth  something like mould often turns it black--as we find to our discomfort.    But when the honey dew is fresh the bees love it. They collect large  quantities of it and make it into honey. Squirrels like it to.    It is great fun to watch the nimble squirrel folk sitting in the trees  and holding a leaf between their little hands while they lick off the  honey dew.    Children sometimes suck the honey dew from the leaves in back country  places, where sugar is scarce and where candy is seldom to be had.    Which side of the leaf does the aphid prefer?    Yes, it is on the under side always.    I wonder why.    John says the aphides would be better protected in case of a shower.    Ned says the skin is tenderer on the under side and easier to pierce.    Mollie thinks they want to be in the shade out of the hot sunshine.    I should not wonder if all of these reasons were right.    My little aphid, how many wings have you when you have any?    Yes, little Nell, they have four of the daintiest, prettiest little  wings you ever saw.    [Illustration]    True enough, most of them have no wings at all.    [Illustration]    John thinks those must be young ones.    Sometimes they are, but not always. Many of the adult aphids have no  wings.    The aphids are very curious insects, and when you are older I hope you  will remember to study them carefully.    No, John, not all species of aphides make honey dew.    Some form instead a white, powdery substance that is seen scattered over  the body.    May says that must be the kind she has.    Let us see. Yes, May's aphids produce the white powder instead of honey  dew.    That is _their_ way of getting rid of the waste matter.    May says she is glad to know that; she thought her aphids had something  the matter with them. They seemed to be falling to pieces.    No, May, they are not falling to pieces; that powder can all be rubbed  off, and there are your aphids whole and sound beneath it.    Do you know that some species of your funny little tree hoppers secrete  honey dew also, and even have ants to attend them? See if you can find  some of these this summer.    Sometimes aphids live on the roots of plants as well as on the leaves.    Yes, indeed, May, they are very destructive insects. We have to spray  our house plants to get rid of them, and often our garden flowers as  well, and they do a great deal of damage to fruits and vegetables, and  one of them, the phylloxera, has nearly destroyed the vineyards of  France. It lives on the leaves of some species of grapes and on the  roots of others. We have to be very careful about getting grape vines  from Europe to plant in this country on account of the phylloxera.    [Illustration]    What have you found now, John? Ah, yes, an alder branch, with a white,  cottony substance on it. You have been poking into it with a little  stick, and you think there are insects beneath it.    What, May, you always thought that white stuff was a plant growth, like  mould?    We can easily find out. Get out some of the little things inside if you  can, John. It is not easy to separate them from their cottony covering  without crushing them, but now we can see quite well with the magnifying  glass--and yes--you see they are little insects.    We call them the woolly aphids.    They also secrete honey dew.    You say the ground below the alder bush was all sticky and black, John?    That was the honey dew, blackened by a little plant something like  mould, that grows on it.    We often see woolly plant lice in the summer-time on different plants,  and one species injures apple trees. It gets on the roots as well as on  the tender bark of young trees and kills them.    Yes, indeed, Mollie, the aphids are bugs. They belong to the bug order,  which is a very large and important insect family, and contains some  members that are exceedingly troublesome to us.          SCALE BUGS      What, May, you are tired out?    What have you been doing?    Oh, yes, washing the scales off the leaves of your mother's window fern.    [Illustration]    It must indeed have been a task; what did you wash them off with? Why  did you use soap suds?    Because your mother told you to; well, that is a good reason, but why do  you think she told you to use soap suds?    You say you don't know, but you think very likely these scales are some  sort of bug, as everything nowadays seems to be bugs.    Well, I don't know about everything being bugs, but those scales  certainly are. They are scale bugs.    Did you stop to look at them under the magnifying glass?    [Illustration]    No, but you brought a piece of the fern for us to look at.    It will be necessary to put it under the microscope.    There, now look.    Yes, that scale looks like a tiny mussel shell; but look carefully, and  you will see it has legs.    Lift it up with the point of a pin, and under it you will find a mass of  eggs. Yes, Ned; it is like a quantity of eggs under a dish cover.    The cover is the female scale bug, and she has laid all those eggs.    Yes, the scales we see on so many plants are the scale bugs.    They are not all alike in shape, or size, or color; here is a different  kind, you see.    [Illustration]    But they are all very prolific; that is to say, they produce a great  many young, and do it in a short time.    Yes, John, the tiny, dark-colored scales that look like little oyster  shells on the skins of oranges are a form of scale bug, and a very  troublesome one, too, to the orange grower.    But though most of these insects are troublesome, the family is redeemed  by a few members that are of great value to us.    One of these is the scale bug that supplies shellac, and all that comes  from it to our markets. These curious bugs give forth a resinous  substance that envelops the eggs and glues them to the twigs whose  juices the bug sucks out. It is this resinous substance that is  collected by breaking off the twigs where the insects are. It is used  for varnishes, as you know, and for polishing wood and other substances.    There are other scale bugs that secrete wax, and some of them produce it  so abundantly, and of such good quality, that it has become an article  of commerce. China wax, which is wax of a very fine quality, is secreted  by a Chinese scale bug, and the wax is used for making fine candles, as  well as for other purposes.    In Mexico we have the cochineal insect, which is a scale bug that lives  on a cactus that grows in Mexico.    Like many others of the scale bugs, the cochineal males have wings and  are not so scalelike as their helpless mates.    But they are of no use to us. It is only the female cochineal we use.    She is raised in great numbers in cactus gardens planted on purpose.    Here is the picture of a cactus with cochineal insects upon it.    [Illustration]    These insects contain a very brilliant, red coloring matter that is used  by us in dyeing leather and wool, and in making paints. The insects are  gathered and dried, and thus sent to market.    Although a few of them are useful to us, the scale bugs, on the whole,  are a serious pest; and they are found on nearly all kinds of plants all  over the world.    You should think all the plants would soon be gone, so many insects eat  them?    Well, they would, only other things eat the insects.    Insects have a great many enemies, after all.    Sometimes the weather is bad for them, the season is too hot or too  cold, too wet or too dry, and then they do not appear in large numbers.    Sometimes one kind of insect eats another kind.    Sometimes tiny plants, like moulds, grow on the insects and kill them;  and birds destroy a very large number.    If the farmers only knew how much good the birds do them, they would  never allow one to be killed. Even the crows that pull up their corn are  worth many times the corn they eat in the insects they destroy. There is  scarcely a bird but what is of value to the farmer.    The hawks that catch his chickens catch more mice and moles in his  fields, than"]]]
