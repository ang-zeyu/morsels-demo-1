The captain then took  leave, and set sail with a fair wind, and arrived safe at London.    One morning, when Mr. Fitzwarren had come into the counting house, and  seated himself at the desk, somebody came tap, tap, tap, at the door.    \"Who is there?\" asked Mr. Fitzwarren.    \"A friend,\" answered someone; and who should it be but the captain,  followed by several men carrying vast lumps of gold, that had been paid  him by the King of Barbary for the ship's cargo. They then told the  story of the cat, and showed the rich present that the King had sent to  Dick for her; upon which the merchantman called out to his servants:        \"Go fetch him, we will tell him of the same;       Pray call him Mr. Whittington by name.\"    Mr. Fitzwarren now showed himself a really good man, for while some of  his clerks said so great a treasure was too much for such a boy as  Dick, he answered:    \"I will not keep the value of a single penny from him! It is all his  own, and he shall have every farthing's worth of it.\"    He sent for Dick, who happened to be scouring the cook's kettles, and  was quite dirty; so that he wanted to excuse himself from going to his  master. Mr. Fitzwarren, however, made him come in, and ordered a chair  to be set for him, so that poor Dick thought they were making fun of  him, and began to beg his master not to play tricks with a poor boy,  but to let him go again to his work.    \"Indeed, Mr. Whittington,\" said the merchant, \"we are all in earnest  with you; and I heartily rejoice in the news these gentlemen have  brought you; for the captain has sold your cat to the King of Barbary,  and brought you, in return for her, more riches than I possess; and I  wish you may long enjoy them!\"    Mr. Fitzwarren then told the men to open the great treasure they had  brought with them, and said, \"Mr. Whittington has now nothing to do  but to put it in some place of safety.\"    Poor Dick hardly knew how to behave himself for joy. He begged his  master to take what part of it he pleased, since he owed it all to  his kindness.    [Illustration]    \"No, no,\" answered Mr. Fitzwarren, \"this is all your own; and I have no  doubt you will use it well.\"    Dick next asked his mistress, and then Miss Alice, to accept a part of  his good fortune; but they would not, and at the same time told him that  his success afforded them great pleasure. But the poor fellow was too  kind-hearted to keep it all to himself; so he made a handsome present to  the captain, the mate, and every one of the sailors, and afterwards to  his good friend the footman, and the rest of Mr. Fitzwarren's servants;  and even to the ill-natured cook. After this, Mr. Fitzwarren advised  him to get himself dressed like a gentleman; and told him he was welcome  to live in his house till he could provide himself with a better.    When Whittington's face was washed, his hair curled, his hat cocked,  and he was dressed in a nice suit of clothes, he was as handsome as any  young man who visited at Mr. Fitzwarren's; so that Miss Alice, who had  been so kind to him, and thought of him with pity, now looked upon him  as fit to be her sweetheart; and the more so, no doubt, because  Whittington was now always thinking what he could do to oblige her,  and making her the prettiest presents that could be. Mr. Fitzwarren  soon saw their love for each other, and proposed to join them in  marriage; and to this they both readily agreed. A day for the wedding  was soon fixed; and they were attended to church by the Lord Mayor,  the Court of Aldermen, the Sheriffs, and a great number of the richest  merchants in London, whom they afterwards treated with a fine feast.    History tells us that Mr. Whittington and his lady lived in great  splendor, and were very happy. They had several children. He was Sheriff  of London in the year 1360, and several times afterwards Lord Mayor;  the last time, he entertained King Henry the Fifth, on his Majesty's  return from the famous Battle of Agincourt. In this company, the King,  on account of Whittington's gallantry, said:    \"Never had prince such a subject;\" and when Whittington was told this at  the table, he answered:    \"Never had subject such a king.\"    Going with an address from the city, on one of the King's victories, he  received the honor of knighthood. Sir Richard Whittington supported many  poor; he built a church, and also a college, with a yearly allowance to  poor scholars, and near it raised a hospital. The figure of Sir Richard  Whittington, with his cat in his arms, carved in stone, was to be seen  till the year 1780, over the archway of the old prison of Newgate, that  stood across Newgate Street.          THE STORY OF BLUE BEARD    [Illustration]      Many years ago there was a rich man who had a singular blue beard, which  made him very ugly. Being left a widower, he wished to marry one of the  two beautiful daughters of a neighboring lady, and at last the younger  of these girls consented to be his wife.    About a month after the marriage, Blue Beard told his bride that he must  leave her for a time, as he had some business to attend to at a  distance. He gave her his keys, and told her to make free of everything  and entertain her friends while he was absent, but ending by drawing  one key from the bunch and saying:    \"This small key belongs to the room at the end of the long gallery--and  that, my dear, is the one room you must not enter, nor even put the key  into the lock. Should you disobey, your punishment would be dreadful.\"    [Illustration]    Blue Beard set out on his journey, and for a time his wife found  pleasure in showing her friends all her magnificence; but again and  again she wondered what could be the reason why she was not to visit the  room at the end of the long gallery. At last her curiosity became such  that she could not resist the temptation to take just one peep within  the forbidden door. When she reached the door she stopped for a few  moments to think of her husband's warning, that he would not fail to  keep his word should she disobey him. But she was so very curious to  know what was inside, that she determined to venture in spite of  everything.    So, with a trembling hand, she put the key into the lock, and the door  immediately opened. The window shutters being closed, she at first saw  nothing; but in a short time she noticed that the floor was covered with  clotted blood, on which the bodies of several dead women were lying.  (These were all the wives whom Blue Beard had married, and murdered one  after another!) She was ready to sink with fear, and the key of the  door, which she held in her hand, fell on the floor. When she had  somewhat recovered from her fright, she took it up, locked the door  and hurried to her own room, terrified by what she had seen.    As she observed that the key had got stained with blood in falling on  the floor, she wiped it two or three times to clean it; but the blood  still remained; she next washed it; but the blood did not go; she then  scoured it with brickdust, and afterwards with sand. But notwithstanding  all she could do, the blood was still there, for the key was a fairy,  who was Blue Beard's friend, so that as fast as she got the stain off  one side it appeared again on the other. Early in the evening Blue  Beard returned, saying he had not proceeded far before he was met by a  messenger, who told him that the business was concluded without his  presence being necessary. His wife said everything she could think of  to make him believe that she was delighted at his unexpected return.    [Illustration]    The next morning, he asked for the keys. She gave them, but, as she  could not help showing her fright, Blue Beard easily guessed what had  happened.    \"How is it,\" said he, \"that the key of the closet upon the ground floor  is not here.\"    \"Is it not?\" said the wife. \"I must have left it on my dressing table.\"    \"Be sure you give it me by and by,\" replied Blue Beard.    After going several times backwards and forwards, pretending to look for  the key, she was at last obliged to give it to Blue Beard. He looked at  it attentively, and then said:    \"How came this blood upon the key?\"    \"I am sure I do not know,\" replied the lady, turning as pale as death.    \"You do not know?\" said Blue Beard sternly. \"But I know well enough. You  have been in the closet on the ground floor. Very well, madam; since you  are so mightily fond of this closet, you shall certainly take your place  among the ladies you saw there.\"    [Illustration]    His wife, almost dead with fear, fell upon her knees, asked his pardon  a thousand times for her disobedience, and begged him to forgive her,  looking all the time so sorrowful and lovely that she would have melted  any heart that was not harder than a rock.    But Blue Beard answered:    \"No, no, madam; you shall die this very minute.\"    \"Alas,\" said the poor creature, \"if I must die, allow me, at least, a  little time to say my prayers!\"    \"I give you,\" replied the cruel Blue Beard, \"half a quarter of an  hour--not one moment longer.\"    When Bluebeard had left her to herself, she called her sister; and,  after telling her that she had but half a quarter of an hour to live:    \"Please,\" said she, \"Sister Ann\" (this was her sister's name), \"run up  to the tower, and see if my brothers are in sight; they promised to come  and visit me to-day; and if you see them, make a sign for them to gallop  on as fast as possible.\"    Her sister instantly did as she was desired, and the terrified lady  every minute called out:    \"Sister Ann, do you see anyone coming?\"    And her sister answered:    \"I see nothing but the sun, which makes a dust, and the grass, which  looks green.\"    In the meanwhile, Blue Beard, with a great simitar in his hand, bawled  as loud as he could:    \"Come down"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/20750"],[0,"Journal of the Proceedings of the Linnean Society - Vol. 3 (#16)"],[1,"in the condition of wild and domestic animals is  this,--that among the former, their well-being and very existence depend  upon the full exercise and healthy condition of all their senses and  physical powers, whereas, among the latter, these are only partially  exercised, and in some cases are absolutely unused. A wild animal has to  search, and often to labour, for every mouthful of food--to exercise  sight, hearing, and smell in seeking it, and in avoiding dangers, in  procuring shelter from the inclemency of the seasons, and in providing  for the subsistence and safety of its offspring. There is no muscle of  its body that is not called into daily and hourly activity; there is no  sense or faculty that is not strengthened by continual exercise. The  domestic animal, on the other hand, has food provided for it, is  sheltered, and often confined, to guard it against the vicissitudes of  the seasons, is carefully secured from the attacks of its natural  enemies, and seldom even rears its young without human assistance. Half  of its senses and faculties are quite useless; and the other half are  but occasionally called into feeble exercise, while even its muscular  system is only irregularly called into action.    Now when a variety of such an animal occurs, having increased power or  capacity in any organ or sense, such increase is totally useless, is  never called into action, and may even exist without the animal ever  becoming aware of it. In the wild animal, on the contrary, all its  faculties and powers being brought into full action for the necessities  of existence, any increase becomes immediately available, is  strengthened by exercise, and must even slightly modify the food, the  habits, and the whole economy of the race. It creates as it were a new  animal, one of superior powers, and which will necessarily increase in  numbers and outlive those inferior to it.    Again, in the domesticated animal all variations have an equal chance of  continuance; and those which would decidedly render a wild animal unable  to compete with its fellows and continue its existence are no  disadvantage whatever in a state of domesticity. Our quickly fattening  pigs, short-legged sheep, pouter pigeons, and poodle dogs could never  have come into existence in a state of nature, because the very first  step towards such inferior forms would have led to the rapid extinction  of the race; still less could they now exist in competition with their  wild allies. The great speed but slight endurance of the race horse, the  unwieldy strength of the ploughman's team, would both be useless in a  state of nature. If turned wild on the pampas, such animals would  probably soon become extinct, or under favourable circumstances might  each lose those extreme qualities which would never be called into  action, and in a few generations would revert to a common type, which  must be that in which the various powers and faculties are so  proportioned to each other as to be best adapted to procure food and  secure safety,--that in which by the full exercise of every part of his  organization the animal can alone continue to live. Domestic varieties,  when turned wild, _must_ return to something near the type of the  original wild stock, _or become altogether extinct_.    We see, then, that no inferences as to varieties in a state of nature  can be deduced from the observation of those occurring among domestic  animals. The two are so much opposed to each other in every circumstance  of their existence, that what applies to the one is almost sure not to  apply to the other. Domestic animals are abnormal, irregular,  artificial; they are subject to varieties which never occur and never  can occur in a state of nature: their very existence depends altogether  on human care; so far are many of them removed from that just proportion  of faculties, that true balance of organization, by means of which alone  an animal left to its own resources can preserve its existence and  continue its race.    The hypothesis of Lamarck--that progressive changes in species have been  produced by the attempts of animals to increase the development of their  own organs, and thus modify their structure and habits--has been  repeatedly and easily refuted by all writers on the subject of varieties  and species, and it seems to have been considered that when this was  done the whole question has been finally settled; but the view here  developed renders such an hypothesis quite unnecessary, by showing that  similar results must be produced by the action of principles constantly  at work in nature. The powerful retractile talons of the falcon- and the  cat-tribes have not been produced or increased by the volition of those  animals; but among the different varieties which occurred in the earlier  and less highly organized forms of these groups, _those always survived  longest which had the greatest facilities for seizing their prey_.  Neither did the giraffe acquire its long neck by desiring to reach the  foliage of the more lofty shrubs, and constantly stretching its neck for  the purpose, but because any varieties which occurred among its  antitypes with a longer neck than usual _at once secured a fresh range  of pasture over the same ground as their shorter-necked companions, and  on the first scarcity of food were thereby enabled to outlive them_.  Even the peculiar colours of many animals, especially insects, so  closely resembling the soil or the leaves or the trunks on which they  habitually reside, are explained on the same principle; for though in  the course of ages varieties of many tints may have occurred, _yet those  races having colours best adapted to concealment from their enemies  would inevitably survive the longest_. We have also here an acting cause  to account for that balance so often observed in nature,--a deficiency  in one set of organs always being compensated by an increased  development of some others--powerful wings accompanying weak feet, or  great velocity making up for the absence of defensive weapons; for it  has been shown that all varieties in which an unbalanced deficiency  occurred could not long continue their existence. The action of this  principle is exactly like that of the centrifugal governor of the steam  engine, which checks and corrects any irregularities almost before they  become evident; and in like manner no unbalanced deficiency in the  animal kingdom can ever reach any conspicuous magnitude, because it  would make itself felt at the very first step, by rendering existence  difficult and extinction almost sure soon to follow. An origin such as  is here advocated will also agree with the peculiar character of the  modifications of form and structure which obtain in organized  beings--the many lines of divergence from a central type, the increasing  efficiency and power of a particular organ through a succession of  allied species, and the remarkable persistence of unimportant parts such  as colour, texture of plumage and hair, form of horns or crests, through  a series of species differing considerably in more essential characters.  It also furnishes us with a reason for that \"more specialized structure\"  which Professor Owen states to be a characteristic of recent compared  with extinct forms, and which would evidently be the result of the  progressive modification of any organ applied to a special purpose in  the animal economy.    We believe we have now shown that there is a tendency in nature to the  continued progression of certain classes of _varieties_ further and  further from the original type--a progression to which there appears no  reason to assign any definite limits--and that the same principle which  produces this result in a state of nature will also explain why domestic  varieties have a tendency to revert to the original type. This  progression, by minute steps, in various directions, but always checked  and balanced by the necessary conditions, subject to which alone  existence can be preserved, may, it is believed, be followed out so as  to agree with all the phenomena presented by organized beings, their  extinction and succession in past ages, and all the extraordinary  modifications of form, instinct, and habits which they exhibit.

The dissection of the Cetacea, and more especially of the larger kinds,  is attended with great difficulty, and not unfrequently entails heavy  expenses on those who attempt it. For these reasons I have thought that  zoologists might be pleased to have, even now, submitted to them the  results of numerous dissections made many years ago, when, not stinted  in means, and having the aid of excellent assistants, I attempted the  dissection even of the gigantic Arctic Rorqual, the largest, perhaps, of  all living beings. Certain of the details have been from time to time  laid before the public, but in an extremely scattered and incomplete  form, and without the illustrations (artistic), which explain so much  better than any verbal description. The greater part is still before me  in manuscript. It is my intention in the following contributions to  endeavour to connect them together, adding to those already published  many facts I find in MSS.

Edward Forbes and Henry Goodsir (who were at that time my  students and assistants), are still in my possession.    _Determination of Species._--The determination of species as regards the"]]]
