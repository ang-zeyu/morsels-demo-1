We are approaching the  abominable crisis of that mournful day, the 4th; we are approaching  that monstrous deed from which emerged the success of the _coup  d'etat_, dripping with blood. We are about to unveil the most  horrible of the premeditated acts of Louis Bonaparte; we are about to  reveal, to narrate, to describe what all the historiographers of the  2nd of December have concealed; what General Magnan carefully omitted  in his report; what, even at Paris, where these things were seen, men  scarcely dare to whisper to each other. We are about to enter upon the  ghastly.    \"The 2nd of December is a crime covered with darkness, a coffin closed  and silent, from the cracks in which streams of blood gush forth.    \"We are about to raise the coffin-lid.\"          II      \"From an early hour in the morning,--for here (we insist upon this  point) premeditation is unquestionable,--from an early hour in the  morning, strange placards had been posted up at all the street-corners;  we have transcribed these placards, and our readers will remember them.  During sixty years that the cannon of revolution have, on certain days,  boomed through Paris, and that the government, when menaced, has had  recourse to desperate measures, nothing has ever been seen like these  placards. They informed the inhabitants that all assemblages, no matter  of what kind, would be dispersed by armed force, _without previous  warning_. In Paris, the metropolis of civilization, people do not  easily believe that a man will push his crime to the last extremity;  and, therefore, these notices had been looked upon as a means of  intimidation that was hideous and barbarous, but almost ridiculous.    \"The public were wrong. These placards contained in germ Louis  Bonaparte's whole plan. They were seriously meant.    \"One word as to the spot which is about to be the theatre of the  unheard-of drama, prepared and perpetrated by the man of December.    \"From the Madeleine to Faubourg Poissonniere, the boulevard was  unobstructed; from the Gymnase Theatre to the Theatre of the Porte  Saint-Martin it was barricaded, as were Rue de Bondy, Rue Neslay, Rue  de la Lune, and all the streets which bound, or debouch at, Porte  Saint-Denis and Porte Saint-Martin. Beyond Porte Saint-Martin the  boulevard was again free as far as the Bastile, with the exception of a  single barricade, which had been begun opposite the Chateau d'Eau.  Between Porte Saint-Denis and Porte Saint-Martin, seven or eight  redoubts crossed the street at intervals. A square of four barricades  shut in Porte Saint-Denis. Of these four barricades, that one which  looked towards the Madeleine, and which was destined to receive the  first impact of the troops, had been constructed at the culminating  point of the boulevard, with its left resting on the corners of Rue de  la Lune, and its right on Rue Mazagran. Four omnibuses, five  furniture-moving vans, the office of the inspector of hackney coaches,  which had been thrown down, the vespasian columns, which had been  broken up, the public seats on the boulevards, the flag-stones of the  steps on Rue de la Lune, the entire iron railing of the sidewalk, which  had been wrenched from its place at a single effort by the powerful  hand of the crowd--such was the composition of this fortification,  which was hardly sufficient to block the boulevard, which, at this  point, is very broad. There were no paving-stones, as the roadway is  macadamized. The barricade did not even extend from one side of the  boulevard to the other, but left a large open space on the side toward  Rue Mazagran, where there was a house in course of erection. Observing  this gap, a well-dressed young man got upon the scaffolding, and, quite  unaided, without the least hurry, without even taking the cigar from  his mouth, cut all the ropes of the scaffolding. The people at the  neighbouring windows laughed and applauded him. An instant afterwards  the scaffolding fell all at once, and with a loud noise; this completed  the barricade.    \"While this redoubt was being completed, a score or more of men entered  the Gymnase Theatre by the stage-door, and came out a few seconds later  with some muskets and a drum which they had found in the wardrobe, and  which were a part of what, in theatrical language, are termed 'the  properties,' One of the men took the drum and began beating to arms.  The others, with the overturned vespasian columns, carriages thrown  on their sides, blinds and shutters torn from their hinges, and old  scenery, constructed, opposite the guard-house of Boulevard  Bonne-Nouvelle, a small barricade as a sort of advanced post, or rather  a lunette, which commanded Boulevards Poissonniere and Montmartre as  well as Rue Hauteville. The troops had evacuated the guard-house in the  morning. They took the flag belonging to it and planted it on the  barricade. It was this same flag which was afterwards declared by the  newspapers of the _coup d'etat_ to have been a 'red flag.'    \"Some fifteen men took up their position at this advanced post. They  had muskets, but no cartridges, or, at most, very few. Behind them, the  large barricade, which covered Porte Saint-Denis, was held by about a  hundred combatants, in the midst of whom were observed two women and an  old man with white hair, supporting himself on a cane with his left  hand, and, in his right, holding a musket. One of the two women wore a  sabre suspended over her shoulder; while helping to tear up the railing  of the sidewalk, she had cut three fingers of her right hand with the  sharp edge of an iron bar. She showed the wound to the crowd, crying:  '_Vive la Republique!_' The other woman had ascended to the top of  the barricade, where, leaning on the flag-staff, and escorted by two  men in blouses, who were armed with muskets and presented arms, she  read aloud the call to arms issued by the Representatives of the Left.  The crowd clapped their hands.    \"All this occurred between noon and one o'clock. On this side of the  barricades an immense number of people covered the pavement on both  sides of the boulevard; in some places, silent; in others, crying:  'Down with Soulouque! Down with the traitor!'    \"From time to time, mournful processions traversed the multitude; they  consisted of files of closed litters borne by hospital attendants and  soldiers. At their head marched men holding long poles, from which hung  blue placards, on which was inscribed, in huge letters: _Service of  the Military Hospitals_. On the curtains of the litters: _Wounded,  Ambulance_. The weather was dull and rainy.    \"At this time there was a great crowd at the Bourse. On all the walls  bill-stickers were posting despatches announcing the adhesion of the  departments to the _coup d'etat_. Even the stockbrokers, while  trying to bull the market, laughed and shrugged their shoulders at  these placards. Suddenly, a well-known speculator, who had for two days  been a great admirer of the _coup d'etat_, made his appearance,  pale and breathless, like a fugitive, and exclaimed: 'They are firing  on the boulevards!'    \"This is what had happened:          III      \"A little after one o'clock, a quarter of an hour after the last order  given by Louis Bonaparte to General Roguet, the boulevards throughout  their whole length, from the Madeleine, were suddenly covered with  cavalry and infantry. Almost the whole of Carrelet's division, composed  of the five brigades of Cotte, Bourgon, Canrobert, Dulac, and Reibell,  making a total of sixteen thousand four hundred and ten men, had taken  up their position, and extended in echelon from Rue de la Paix to  Faubourg Poissonniere. Each brigade had its battery with it. Eleven  pieces were counted on Boulevard Poisonniere alone. Two of the guns,  with their muzzles turned different ways, were levelled at the entrance  to Rue Montmartre and Faubourg Montmartre respectively; no one knew  why, as neither the street nor the faubourg presented even the  appearance of a barricade. The spectators, who crowded the sidewalks  and the windows, gazed in dismay at all these guns, sabres, and  bayonets.    \"'The troops were laughing and chatting,' says one witness. Another  witness says: 'The soldiers acted strangely. Most of them were leaning  on their muskets, with the butt-end on the ground, and seemed nearly  falling from fatigue, or something else.' One of those old officers who  are accustomed to read a soldier's thoughts in his eyes, General L----,  said, as he passed Cafe Frascati: 'They are drunk.'    \"There were now some indications of what was about to happen.    \"At one moment, when the crowd was crying to the troops, '_Vive la  Republique!_' 'Down with Louis Bonaparte!' one of the officers was  heard to say, in a low voice: 'There's going to be some pigsticking!'    \"A battalion of infantry debouches from Rue Richelieu. Before the Cafe  Cardinal it is greeted by a unanimous cry of '_Vive la Republique!_'  A writer, the editor of a Conservative paper, who happens to be on the  spot, adds: '_Down with Soulouque!_' The staff officer in command of  the detachment aims a blow at him with his sabre, which, being dodged  by the journalist, cuts in two one of the small trees on the boulevard.    \"As the 1st Regiment of Lancers, commanded by Colonel Rochefort,  reached a point abreast of Rue Taitbout, a numerous crowd covered  the pavement of the boulevard. They were residents of the quarter,  tradesmen, artists, journalists, and among them several young mothers  leading their children by the hand. As the regiment was passing, men  and women--every one--cried: '_Vive la Constitution!_' _'Vive"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/20587"],[0,"Integration of the Armed Forces, 1940-1965 (#16)"],[1,"v.

For effect of segregated blood banks on                     black morale, see Mary A. Morton, \"The Federal                     Government and Negro Morale,\" _Journal of Negro                     Education_ (Summer 1943): 452, 455-56.]    Black morale suffered further in the leadership crisis that developed  in black units early in the war. The logic of segregated units  demanded a black officer corps, but there were never enough black  officers to command all the black units. In 1942 only 0.35 percent of  the Negroes in the Army were officers, a shortcoming that could not be  explained by poor education alone.[2-48] But when the number of black  officers did begin to increase, obstacles to their employment  appeared: some white commanders, assuming that Negroes did not  possess leadership ability and that black troops preferred white   (p. 037)  officers, demanded white officers for their units. Limited segregated  recreational and living facilities for black officers prevented their  assignment to some bases, while the active opposition of civilian  communities forced the Army to exclude them from others. The Army  staff practice of forbidding Negroes to outrank or command white  officers serving in the same unit not only limited the employment and  restricted the rank of black officers but also created invidious  distinctions between white and black officers in the same unit. It  tended to convince enlisted men that their black leaders were not  full-fledged officers. Thus restricted in assignment and segregated  socially and professionally, his ability and status in question, the  black officer was often an object of scorn to himself and to his men.                       [Footnote 2-48: Eli Ginzberg, _The Negro Potential_                     (New York: Columbia University Press, 1956), p. 85.                     Ginzberg points out that only about one out of ten                     black soldiers in the upper two mental categories                     became an officer, compared to one out of four                     white soldiers.]    The attitude and caliber of white officers assigned to black units  hardly compensated for the lack of black officers. In general, white  officers resented their assignment to black units and were quick to  seek transfer. Worse still, black units, where sensitive and patient  leaders were needed to create an effective military force, often  became, as they had in earlier wars, dumping grounds for officers  unwanted in white units.[2-49] The Army staff further aggravated black  sensibilities by showing a preference for officers of southern birth  and training, believing them to be generally more competent to  exercise command over Negroes. In reality many Negroes, especially  those from the urban centers, particularly resented southern officers.  At best these officers appeared paternalistic, and Negroes disliked  being treated as a separate and distinct group that needed special  handling and protection. As General Davis later circumspectly  reported, \"many colored people of today expect only a certain line of  treatment from white officers born and reared in the South, namely,  that which follows the southern pattern, which is most distasteful to  them.\"[2-50]                       [Footnote 2-49: Memo, DCofS to CG, AAF, 10 Aug 42,                     sub: Professional Qualities of Officers Assigned to                     Negro Units, WDGAP 322.99; Memo, CG, VII Corps, to                     CG, AGF, 28 Aug 42, same sub, GNAGS 210.31.]                       [Footnote 2-50: Brig Gen B. O. Davis, \"History of a                     Special Section Office of the Inspector General (29                     June 1941 to 16 November 1944),\" p. 8, in CMH.]    Some of these humiliations might have been less demeaning had the  black soldier been convinced that he was a full partner in the crusade  against fascism. As news of the conversion of black units from combat  to service duties and the word that no new black combat units were  being organized became a matter of public knowledge, the black press  asked: Will any black combat units be left? Will any of those left be  allowed to fight? In fact, would black units ever get overseas?    Actually, the Army had a clear-cut plan for the overseas employment of  both black service and combat units. In May 1942 the War Department  directed the Army Air Forces, Ground Forces, and Service Forces to  make sure that black troops were ordered overseas in numbers not less  than their percentage in each of these commands. Theater commanders  would be informed of orders moving black troops to their commands, but  they would not be asked to agree to their shipment beforehand. Since  troop shipments to the British Isles were the chief concern at     (p. 038)  that time, the order added that \"there will be no positive  restrictions on the use of colored troops in the British Isles, but  shipment of colored units to the British Isles will be limited,  initially, to those in the service categories.\"[2-51]                       [Footnote 2-51: Ltr, TAG to CG, AAF, et al., 13 May                     42, AG 291.21 (3-31-42).]    The problem here was not the Army's policy but the fact that certain  foreign governments and even some commanders in American territories  wanted to exclude Negroes. Some countries objected to black soldiers  because they feared race riots and miscegenation. Others with large  black populations of their own felt that black soldiers with their  higher rates of pay might create unrest. Still other countries had  national exclusion laws. In the case of Alaska and Trinidad, Secretary  Stimson ordered, \"Don't yield.\" Speaking of Iceland, Greenland, and  Labrador, he commented, \"Pretty cold for blacks.\" To the request of  Panamanian officials that a black signal construction unit be  withdrawn from their country he replied, \"Tell them [the black unit]  they must complete their work--it is ridiculous to raise such  objections when the Panama Canal itself was built with black labor.\"  As for Chile and Venezuela's exclusion of Negroes he ruled that \"As we  are the petitioners here we probably must comply.\"[2-52] Stimson's  rulings led to a new War Department policy: henceforth black soldiers  would be assigned without regard to color except that they would not  be sent to extreme northern areas or to any country against its will  when the United States had requested the right to station troops in  that country.[2-53]                       [Footnote 2-52: Stimson's comments were not limited                     to overseas areas. To a request by the Second Army                     commander that Negroes be excluded from maneuvers                     in certain areas of the American south he replied:                     \"No, get the Southerners used to them!\" Memo,                     ACofS, WPD, for CofS, 25 Mar 42, sub: The Colored                     Troop Problem, OPD 291.2. Stimson's comments are                     written marginally in ink and initialed \"H.L.S.\"]                       [Footnote 2-53: Memo, G-1 for TAG, 4 Apr 42, and                     Revised Proposals, 22 Apr and 30 Apr 42. All in                     G-1/15640-2.]    Ultimately, theater commanders decided which troops would be committed  to action and which units would be needed overseas; their decisions  were usually respected by the War Department where few believed that  Washington should dictate such matters. Unwilling to add racial  problems to their administrative burdens, some commanders had been  known to cancel their request for troops rather than accept black  units. Consequently, very few Negroes were sent overseas in the early  years of the war.    Black soldiers were often the victims of gross discrimination that  transcended their difficulties with the Army's administration. For  instance, black soldiers, particularly those from more integrated  regions of the country, resented local ordinances governing  transportation and recreation facilities that put them at a great  disadvantage in the important matters of leave and amusement.  Infractions of local rules were inevitable and led to heightened  racial tension and recurring violence.[2-54] At times black soldiers  themselves, reflecting the low morale and lack of discipline in their  units, instigated the violence. Whoever the culprits, the Army's files  are replete with cases of discrimination charged, investigations  launched, and exonerations issued or reforms ordered.[2-55] An  incredible amount of time and effort went into handling these cases  during the darkest days of the war--cases growing out of a policy  (p. 039)  created in the name of military efficiency.                       [Footnote 2-54: Memo, Civilian Aide to SW, 17 Nov 42,                     ASW 291.2 NT.]                       [Footnote 2-55: See, for example, AAF Central Decimal                     Files for October 1942-May 1944 (RG 18). For an                     extended discussion of this subject, see Lee,                     _Employment of Negro Troops_, ch XI-XIII.]    Nor was the violence limited to the United States. Racial friction  also developed in Great Britain where some American troops, resenting  their black countrymen's social acceptance by the British, tried to  export Jim Crow by forcing the segregation of recreational facilities.  Appreciating the treatment they were receiving from the British, the  black soldiers fought back, and the clashes grew at times to riot  proportions. General Davis considered discrimination and prejudice the  cause of trouble, but he placed the immediate blame on local  commanders. Many commanders, convinced that they had little  jurisdiction over racial disputes in the civilian community or simply  refusing to accept responsibility, delegated "]]]
