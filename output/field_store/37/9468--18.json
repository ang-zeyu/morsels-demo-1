PALAZZO REALE,"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/22131"],[0,"The Story of the Upper Canadian Rebellion, Volume 1 (#16)"],[1,"oft-repeated story,  I have taken the trouble to consult the records in the Crown Lands  Office, where I find that Mr. Russell on several occasions made grants  of land to himself. Among other such grants I may mention lot number  twenty-two, in the third concession of the township of York, which was  made on the 16th of July, 1797. See Liber A., folio 382, Provincial  Registry Office. He also granted various tracts of land to his sister,  Miss Elizabeth Russell, the first of which bears date the 15th of  December, 1796. See Liber B., folio 334. So that the President appears  to have begun to \"do good unto himself\" and his family before he had  been three months in office as Administrator of the Government. Further  investigation would doubtless prove that he kept up the practice until  the arrival of Governor Hunter.    [25] See his speech at the close of the first session of the First  Parliament of Upper Canada, on the 15th of October, 1792.    [26] The property qualification for a voter was, in counties, the  possession of lands or tenements of the yearly value of forty shillings  sterling or upwards, over and above all rents and charges; and in towns  or townships, the possession of a dwelling house and lot of the yearly  value of five pounds sterling or upwards, or the having been a resident  for twelve months, and the having paid a year's rent at the rate of ten  pounds sterling or upwards. See the twentieth section of the  Constitutional Act.    [27] The latter part of this clause has no application to Brock, who was  made of manlier stuff. Brock, however, was not Lieutenant-Governor, but  merely Provisional Administrator of the Province.    [28] _Report on the Affairs of British North America_, English folio  edition, p. 29.    [29] _The Constitutional History of Canada_, by Samuel James Watson,  Vol. I., p. 128.    [30] The abuses specified in the present chapter were not confined to  Upper Canada. They existed, with certain local variations, throughout  all the British North American colonies, and produced similar results in  each; viz., ever-recurring conflicts between the Executive and the  popular branch of the Legislature, followed by more or less alienation  of loyalty to the mother country on the part of the more radical element  in the community. In the Maritime Provinces the alienation was not  sufficiently widespread to manifest itself in actual rebellion, though  the conflict between the oligarchy and the popular tribunes sometimes  produced a very disturbed state of feeling. In Lower Canada, where the  element of race-hatred was added to all other sources of disturbance,  the conflict attained an intensity far beyond what was reached in any of  the other colonies, and left traces behind it which are not even yet  wholly obliterated.    [31] _Statistical Account_, Vol. II., p. 296.    [32] _Canadiana_, by W. B. Wells, p. 103.    [33] Ib.    [34] Ib., p. 104.    [35] These grants of five thousand acres to members of the Executive  Council were in direct violation of the instructions framed by the Home  Government for the regulation of land-granting in Upper Canada. They  continued to be made down to 1807, when they were stopped by a  peremptory order to that effect from the Colonial Secretary. There is  one instance on record of a reserve being applied for and made on behalf  of the child of a member of the Legislative Council, though the child  was not three days old. See the evidence of John Radenhurst, Chief Clerk  in the office of the Surveyor-General, in Appendix B. to Lord Durham's  _Report on the Affairs of British North America_.    [36] Most of these facts with reference to the granting of public lands  may be obtained from the archives of the Crown Lands Office in Toronto,  and from the newspapers and official reports of the period. They may  also be found, together with a vast accumulation of other important  facts bearing on the same subject, in Charles Buller's Report on Public  Lands and Emigration, forming Appendix B. to Lord Durham's _Report on  the Affairs of British North America_.    [37] _Canadiana_, p. 130.    [38] In 1796 or thereabouts the Executive offered to grant entire  townships to persons who would undertake to settle them with a certain  number of colonists within a specified time. The number of colonists  required was made proportionate to the extent of territory to be  settled. This offer was taken advantage of by ten different individuals.  The grants were not actually made, but the respective townships were  allocated in the official books to the various persons concerned. Upon  the faith of the pledge of the Executive, several of the ten assignees  proceeded to carry out the conditions imposed. Among them was Mr.  William Berczy, who, having obtained an assignment of the township of  Markham, went to great expense in bringing over a number of German  families, whom he settled according to the conditions of the  contemplated grant. After he had spent a sum of money variously stated  at from twenty to thirty thousand pounds sterling, the Executive coolly  announced that they had determined to abandon the township system, and  that they did not even intend to carry out the grants to those who had  complied with the conditions. The compensation offered for this  unparalleled breach of faith was a grant of twelve hundred acres to each  assignee. Nine of the individuals concerned assented to those terms, but  Mr. Berczy refused to accept any such inadequate recompense, and he  remained for the rest of his life a ruined man. He shook the dust of  Upper Canada from his feet, and took up his abode in Montreal, whence he  subsequently repaired to New York, where he died in the year 1813.    [39] See Appendix B. to Lord Durham's _Report_, folio edition, p. 99.  Mr. Charles Rankin, Deputy-Surveyor in the Western District, in his  evidence before the Commission (_ib._ pp. 120, 121), says:--\"The system  of making large grants to individuals who had no intention of settling  them has tended to retard the prosperity of the colony by separating the  actual settlers, and rendering it so much more difficult, and in some  cases impossible, for them to make the necessary roads. It has also made  the markets more distant and more precarious. To such an extent have  these difficulties been experienced as to occasion the abandonment of  settlements which had been formed. I may mention, as an instance of  this, the township of Rama, where after a trial of three years, the  settlers were compelled to abandon their improvements. It should be  noticed that the settlers in this instance were not of a class fitted to  encounter the privations of the wilderness, being half-pay officers. In  the township of St. Vincent almost all the most valuable settlers have  left their farms from the same cause, the townships of Nottawasaga and  Collingwood, the whole of the land in which had been granted, and which  are almost entirely unsettled (Collingwood, I believe, has only one  settler), intervening between them and the settled township, and  rendering communication impossible. There have been numerous instances  in which, though the settlement has not been altogether abandoned, the  most valuable settlers, after unavailing struggles of several years with  the difficulties which I have described, have left their farms.\" This  witness further states his belief that nine-tenths of the lands in the  Western District were still--in 1838--in a state of wilderness.    [40] See his _Report, passim_; also see the portion of Appendix B.  relating to Upper Canada.    [41] See the Special Report of Mr. R. Davies Hanson, Assistant  Commissioner of Crown Lands and Emigration, forming the commencement of  Appendix A. to Lord Durham's _Report on the Affairs of British North  America_.    [42] I use this word for want of a better, though it is not strictly  accurate as applied to Upper Canada, where there were no clearly  prescribed standards of religious faith from which non-supporters of  Episcopacy could be said to dissent. The word \"Nonconformist\" is  objectionable for a similar reason.    [43] See _Seventh Grievance Committee's Report_, p. 164.    [44] _Ante_, p. 51.          CHAPTER III.    THE FAMILY COMPACT.      What was the nature and origin of this powerful organization--this  informally-constituted league, the name whereof has been familiar to the  ears of Upper Canadians during the whole, or nearly the whole, of the  present century; which is referred to in nearly all books dealing with  the political and social life of this Province before the Union of 1841;  which for forty years regulated the public policy of the colony, and  ruled with an iron hand over the liberties of the inhabitants?    Immediately after the ratification of the Treaty of Paris, in 1763,  whereby Canada was ceded by France to Great Britain, it became necessary  for the British Government to appoint a considerable number of officials  to fill the public offices in the country so ceded. It did not suit the  policy of the conquerors to leave much power in the hands of the  conquered. The introduction of the English language and laws was  moreover a practical disqualification for most of the native inhabitants  of the colony, and the new officials were nearly all sent over from  England. Some of the principal personages among them were men of probity  and brains. Others, though possessed of a full share of brains, had but  a younger brother's portion of the other commodity. The underlings,  generally speaking, had but a slender allowance of either. They were for  the most part appointed on the recommendation of various supporters of  the Government of the day, who were thus able to provide for a number of  their needy relatives and dependants--a matter of vastly greater  importance in their eyes than the proper administration of the affairs  of a distant and newly-acquired colony. The Conquest thus proved a boon  to many"]]]
