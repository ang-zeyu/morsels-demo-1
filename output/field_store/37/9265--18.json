They are either fixed on the fibre by mechanical means or  by precipitation. For example, you use blacklead or plumbago to colour  or darken your hats, and you work on this pigment colour by mechanical  means. I will show you by experiment how to fix a coloured insoluble  pigment in the fibre. I take a solution of acetate of lead (sugar of  lead), and to it I add some solution of bichrome (potassium bichromate).  Acetate of lead (soluble in water) with bichromate of potash (also  soluble in water) yields, on mixing the two, acetate of potash (soluble  in water), and chromate of lead, or chrome yellow (insoluble in water),  and which is consequently precipitated or deposited. Now suppose I boil  some of that chrome-yellow precipitate with lime-water, I convert that  chrome yellow into chrome orange. This, you see, takes place without any  reference to textile fibres. I will now work a piece of cotton in a lead  solution, so that the little tubes of the cotton fibre shall be filled  with it just as the larger glass tube or vessel was filled in the first  experiment. I next squeeze and wash the piece, so as to remove  extraneous solution of lead, just as if I had filled my glass tube by  roughly dipping it bodily into the lead solution, and then washed and  cleansed the outside of that tube. Then I place the fabric in a warm  solution of bichromate of potash (bichrome), when it becomes dyed a  chrome yellow, for just as chromate of lead is precipitated in the glass  tube, so it is now precipitated in the little tubes of the cotton fibre  (see Lecture I.). Let us see if we can now change our chrome yellow to  chrome orange, just as we did in the glass vessel by boiling in  lime-water. I place the yellow fabric in boiling lime-water, when it is  coloured or dyed orange. In each little tubular cotton fibre the same  change goes on as went on in the glass vessel, and as the tube or glass  vessel looks orange, so does the fabric, because the cotton fibres or  tubes are filled with the orange chromium compound. You see this is  quite a different process of pigment colouring from that of rubbing or  working a colour mechanically on to the fibre.    Let us now turn to the substantive colours (Group I.), and see if we can  further sub-divide this large group for the sake of convenience. We can  divide the group into two--(_a_) such colours as exist ready formed in  nature, and chiefly occur in plants, of which the following are the most  important: indigo, archil or orchil, safflower, turmeric, and annatto;  (_b_) the very large sub-group of the artificial or coal-tar colours. We  will briefly consider now the dyestuffs mentioned in Group (_a_).    _Natural Substantive Colours._--Indigo, one of the most valuable dyes,  is the product of a large number of plants, the most important being  different species of _indigofera_, which belong to the pea family. None  of the plants (of which _indigofera tinctoria_ is the chief) contain the  colouring matter in the free state, ready-made, so to say, but only as a  peculiar colourless compound called _indican_, first discovered by  Edward Schunck. When this body is treated with dilute mineral acids it  splits up into Indigo Blue and a kind of sugar. But so easily is this  change brought about that if the leaf of the plant be only bruised, the  decomposition ensues, and a blue mark is produced through separation of  the Indigo Blue. The possibility of dyeing with Indigo so readily and  easily is due to the fact that Indigo Blue absorbs hydrogen from bodies  that will yield it, and becomes, as we say, reduced to a body without  colour, called Indigo White, a body richer in hydrogen than Indigo Blue,  and a body that is soluble. If this white body (Indigo White) be exposed  to the air, the oxygen of the air undoes what the hydrogen did, and  oxidises that Indigo White to insoluble Indigo Blue. Textile fabrics  dipped in such reduced indigo solutions, and afterwards exposed to the  air, become blue through deposit in the fibres of the insoluble Indigo  Blue, and are so dyed. This is called the indigo-vat method. We can  reduce this indigo so as to prepare the indigo-vat by simply mixing  Indigo Blue, copperas (ferrous sulphate) solution, and milk of lime in a  closely-stoppered bottle with water, and letting the mixture stand. The  clear liquor only is used. A piece of cotton dipped in it, and exposed  to the air, quickly turns blue by absorbing oxygen, and is thus dyed.  The best proportions for the indigo-vat are, for cloth dyeing, 4000  parts of water, 40 of indigo, 60 to 80 of copperas crystals, and 50 to  100 of dry slaked lime. The usual plan is to put in the water first,  then add the indigo and copperas, which should be dissolved first, and  finally to add the milk of lime, stirring all the time. Artificial  indigo has been made from coal-tar products. The raw material is a  coal-tar naphtha called toluene or toluol, which is also the raw  material for saccharin, a sweetening agent made from coal-tar. This  artificial indigo is proving a formidable rival to the natural product.    Orchil paste, orchil extract, and cudbear are obtained by exposing the  plants (species of lichens) containing the colouring principle, called  _Orcin_, itself a colourless substance, to the joint action of ammonia  and air, when the oxygen of the air changes that orcin by oxidising it  into _Orcein_, which is the true red colouring matter contained in the  preparations named. The lichens thus treated acquire gradually a deep  purple colour, and form the products called \"cudbear.\" This dye works  best in a neutral bath, but it will do what not many dyes will, namely,  dye in either a slightly alkaline or slightly acid bath as well. Orchil  is not applicable in cotton dyeing. Being a substantive colour no  mordants are needed in dyeing silk and wool with it. The colour produced  on wool and silk is a bright magenta-red with bluish shade.    Litmus is also obtained from the same lichens as yield orchil. It is not  used in dyeing, and is a violet-blue colouring matter when neither acid  nor alkaline, but neutral as it is termed. It turns red with only a  trace of acid, and blue with the least trace of alkali, and so forms a  very delicate reagent when pieces of paper are soaked with it, and  dipped into the liquids to be tested.    Safflower: This vegetable dyeing material, for producing pink colours on  cotton without the aid of a mordant, consists of the petals of the  flower of _carthamus tinctorius_. It contains a principle termed  \"Carthamin\" or \"carthamic acid,\" which can be separated by exhausting  safflower with cold acidulated water (sulphuric acid) to dissolve out a  yellow colouring matter which is useless. The residue after washing free  from acid is treated with a dilute solution of soda crystals, and the  liquid is then precipitated by an acid. A red precipitate is obtained,  which fixes itself directly on cotton thread immersed in the liquid, and  dyes it a delicate rose pink, which is, unfortunately, very fugitive.  Silk can be dyed like cotton. The colour is not fast against light.    Turmeric is the root portion of a plant called _curcuma tinctoria_, that  grows in Southern Asia. The principle forming the colouring matter is  \"Curcumin.\" It is insoluble in cold water, not much soluble in hot, but  easily soluble in alcohol. From the latter solution it separates in  brilliant yellow crystals. Although the colour it yields is very  fugitive, the wool and silk dyers still use it for producing especially  olives, browns, and similar compound shades. It produces on cotton and  wool a bright yellow colour without the aid of any mordant. To show you  how easily dyeing with turmeric is effected, I will warm some powdered  turmeric root in a flask with alcohol, and add the extract to a vessel  of water warmed to about 140 deg. F. (60 deg. C.), and then dip a piece of  cotton in and stir it about, when it will soon be permanently dyed a  fine bright yellow. A piece of wool similarly worked in the bath is also  dyed. However, the unfortunate circumstance is that this colour is fast  neither to light nor alkalis. Contact with soap and water, even, turns  the yellow-dyed cotton, reddish-brown.    Annatto is a colouring principle obtained from the pulpy matter  enclosing the seeds of the fruit of a tree, the _Bixa orellana_, growing  in Central and Southern America. The red or orange colour it yields is  fugitive, and so its use is limited, being chiefly confined to silk  dyeing. The yellow compound it contains is called \"Orellin,\" and it also  contains an orange compound called \"Bixin,\" which is insoluble in water,  but readily soluble in alkalis and in alcohol with a deep yellow colour.  To dye cotton with it, a solution is made of the colour in a boiling  solution of carbonate of soda. The cotton is worked in the diluted  alkaline solution whilst hot. By passing the dyed cotton through water  acidulated with a little vitriol or alum, a redder tint is assumed. For  wool and silk, pale shades are dyed at 106 deg. F. (50 deg. C.) with the  addition of soap to the bath, dark shades at 200 deg. to 212 deg. F. (80 deg. to  100 deg. C.).          LECTURE X    DYESTUFFS AND COLOURS--_Continued_      _Artificial Substantive Dyestuffs._--You may remember that in the last  lecture we divided the colouring matters as follows: I. Substantive  colours, fixing themselves directly on animal fibres without a mordant,  only a few of them doing this, however, on vegetable fibres, like  cotton. We sub-divided them further as--(_a_) those occurring in nature,  and (_b_) those prepared artificially, and chiefly, but not entirely,  the coal-tar colouring matters. II.

After thoroughly scratching one side on mother earth they  roll over and treat the other in like manner. Notwithstanding his sharp  and lofty hump, a buffalo bull can roll completely over with as much  ease as any horse.    The vast amount of rolling and side-scratching on the earth indulged in  by bull buffaloes is shown in the worn condition of the horns of every  old specimen. Often a thickness of half an inch is gone from the upper  half of each horn on its outside curve, at which point the horn is worn  quite flat. This is well illustrated in the horns shown in the  accompanying plate, fig. 6.    [Illustration: DEVELOPMENT OF THE HORNS OF THE AMERICAN BISON.    1. The Calf. 2. The Yearling. 3. Spike Bull, 2 years old.  4. Spike Bull, 3 years old. 5. Bull, 4 years old.  6. Bull, 11 years old. 7. Old \"stub-horn\" Bull, 20 years old.]    Mr. Catlin[36] affords some very interesting and valuable information in  regard to the bison's propensity for wollowing in mad, and also the  origin of the \"fairy circles,\" which have caused so much speculation  amongst travelers:    [Note 36: North American Indians, vol. I, p. 249, 250.]    \"In the heat of summer, these huge animals, which no doubt suffer very  much with the great profusion of their long and shaggy hair, or fur,  often graze on the low grounds of the prairies, where there is a little  stagnant water lying amongst the grass, and the ground underneath being  saturated with it, is soft, into which the enormous bull, lowered down  upon one knee, will plunge his horns, and at last his head, driving up  the earth, and soon making an excavation in the ground into which the  water filters from amongst the grass, forming for him in a few moments a  cool and comfortable bath, into which he plunges like a hog in his mire.    \"In this delectable laver he throws himself flat upon his side, and  forcing himself violently around, with his horns and his huge hump on  his shoulders presented to the sides, he ploughs up the ground by his  rotary motion, sinking himself deeper and deeper in the ground,  continually enlarging his pool, in which he at length becomes nearly  immersed, and the water and mud about him mixed into a complete mortar,  which changes his color and drips in streams from every part of him as  he rises up upon his feet, a hideous monster of mud and ugliness, too  frightful and too eccentric to be described!    \"It is generally the leader of the herd that takes upon him to make this  excavation, and if not (but another one opens the ground), the leader  (who is conqueror) marches forward, and driving the other from it  plunges himself into it; and, having cooled his sides and changed his  color to a walking mass of mud and mortar, he stands in the pool until  inclination induces him to step out and give place to the next in  command who stands ready, and another, and another, who advance forward  in their turns to enjoy the luxury of the wallow, until the whole band  (sometimes a hundred or more) will pass through it in turn,[37] each one  throwing his body around in a similar manner and each one adding a  little to the dimensions of the pool, while he carries away in his hair  an equal share of the clay, which dries to a gray or whitish color and  gradually falls off. By this operation, which is done perhaps in the  space of half an hour, a circular excavation of fifteen or twenty feet  in diameter and two feet in depth is completed and left for the water to  run into, which soon fills it to the level of the ground.    [Note 37: In the District of Columbia work-house we have a counterpart  of this in the public bath-tub, wherein forty prisoners were seen by a  _Star_ reporter to bathe one after another in the same water!]    \"To these sinks, the waters lying on the surface of the prairies are  continually draining and in them lodging their vegetable deposits, which  after a lapse of years fill them up to the surface with a rich soil,  which throws up an unusual growth of grass and herbage, forming  conspicuous circles, which arrest the eye of the traveler and are  calculated to excite his surprise for ages to come.\"    During the latter part of the last century, when the bison inhabited  Kentucky and Pennsylvania, the salt springs of those States were  resorted to by thousands of those animals, who drank of the saline  waters and licked the impregnated earth. Mr. Thomas Ashe[38] affords us  a most interesting account, from the testimony of an eye witness, of the  behavior of a bison at a salt spring. The description refers to a  locality in western Pennsylvania, where \"an old man, one of the first  settlers of this country, built his log house on the immediate borders  of a salt spring. He informed me that for the first several seasons the  buffaloes paid him their visits with the utmost regularity; they  traveled in single files, always following each other at equal  distances, forming droves, on their arrival, of about 300 each.    [Note 38: Travels in America in 1806. London, 1808.]    \"The first and second years, so unacquainted were these poor brutes with  the use of this man's house or with his nature, that in a few hours they  _rubbed_ the house completely down, taking delight in turning the logs  off with their horns, while he had some difficulty to escape from being  trampled under their feet or crushed to death in his own ruins. At that  period he supposed there could not have been less than 2,000 in the  neighborhood of the spring. They sought for no manner of food, but only  bathed and drank three or four times a day and rolled in the earth, or  reposed with their flanks distended in the adjacent shades; and on the  fifth and sixth days separated into distinct droves, bathed, drank, and  departed in single files, according to the exact order of their arrival.  They all rolled successively in the same hole, and each thus carried  away a coat of mud to preserve the moisture on their skin and which,  when hardened and baked in the sun, would resist the stings of millions  of insects that otherwise would persecute these peaceful travelers to  madness or even death.\"    It was a fixed habit with the great buffalo herds to move southward from  200 to 400 miles at the approach of winter. Sometimes this movement was  accomplished quietly and without any excitement, but at other times it  was done with a rush, in which considerable distances would be gone over  on the double quick. The advance of a herd was often very much like that  of a big army, in a straggling line, from four to ten animals abreast.  Sometimes the herd moved forward in a dense mass, and in consequence  often came to grief in quicksands, alkali bogs, muddy crossings, and on  treacherous ice. In such places thousands of buffaloes lost their lives,  through those in the lead being forced into danger by pressure of the  mass coming behind. In this manner, in the summer of 1867, over two  thousand buffaloes, out of a herd of about four thousand, lost their  lives in the quicksands of the Platte River, near Plum Creek, while  attempting to cross. One winter, a herd of nearly a hundred buffaloes  attempted to cross a lake called Lac-qui-parle, in Minnesota, upon the  ice, which gave way, and drowned the entire herd. During the days of the  buffalo it was a common thing for voyagers on the Missouri River to see  buffaloes hopelessly mired in the quicksands or mud along the shore,  either dead or dying, and to find their dead bodies floating down the  river, or lodged on the upper ends of the islands and sand-bars.    Such accidents as these: it may be repeated, were due to the great  number of animals and the momentum of the moving mass. The forced  marches of the great herds were like the flight of a routed army, in  which helpless individuals were thrust into mortal peril by the  irresistible force of the mass coming behind, which rushes blindly on  after their leaders. In this way it was possible to decoy a herd toward  a precipice and cause it to plunge over en masse, the leaders being  thrust over by their followers, and all the rest following of their own  free will, like the sheep who cheerfully leaped, one after another,  through a hole in the side of a high bridge because their bell-wether  did so.    But it is not to be understood that the movement of a great herd,  because it was made on a run, necessarily partook of the nature of a  stampede in which a herd sweeps forward in a body. The most graphic  account that I ever obtained of facts bearing on this point was  furnished by Mr. James McNaney, drawn from his experience on the  northern buffalo range in 1882. His party reached the range (on Beaver  Creek, about 100 miles south of Glendive) about the middle of November,  and found buffaloes already there; in fact they had begun to arrive from  the north as early as the middle of October. About the first of December  an immense herd arrived from the north. It reached their vicinity one  night, about 10 o'clock, in a mass that seemed to spread everywhere. As  the hunters sat in their tents, loading cartridges and cleaning their  rifles, a low rumble was heard, which gradually increased to \"a  thundering noise,\" and some one exclaimed, \"There! that's a big herd of  buffalo coming in!\" All ran out immediately, and hallooed and discharged  rifles to keep the buffaloes from running over their tents. Fortunately,  the horses were picketed some distance away in a grassy coulée, which  the buffaloes did not enter. The herd came at a jog trot, and moved  quite rapidly. \"In the morning the whole country was black with  buffalo.\" It was estimated that 10,000 head were in sight. One immense  detachment went down on to a \"flat\" and laid down. There it remained  quietly, enjoying a long rest, for about ten days. It gradually broke up  into small bands, which strolled off in various directions looking for  food, and which the hunters quietly attacked.    A still more"]]]
