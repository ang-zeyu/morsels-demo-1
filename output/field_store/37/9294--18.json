The man who brought me here is a bad man, who is trying to cheat his  cousin--a young lady--out of a fortune.\"    \"Don't know nothin' 'bout that,\" said Julius.    \"He has no right to keep me here.\"    \"Don't know nothin' 'bout that, either. I'm actin' accordin' to  orders.\"    \"Look here,\" said Dodger, bethinking himself of what had just  happened. \"Did you tell that young man who called here just now that I  was crazy?\"    Julius burst into a loud guffaw.    \"I expect I did,\" he laughed. \"Said you'd got a long carvin'-knife hid  in de room.\"    \"What made you lie so?\" demanded Dodger, sternly.    \"Couldn't get rid of him no other way. Oh, how scared he looked when I  told him you tried to kill your mother.\"    And the negro burst into another hearty laugh which exasperated Dodger  exceedingly.    \"How long is Mr. Waring going to keep me here? Did he tell you?\"  Dodger asked, after a pause.    \"No; he didn't say.\"    \"When is he coming here again?\"    \"Said he'd come to-morrow most likely.\"    \"Will you bring me a light?\"    \"Couldn't do it. You'd set the house on fire.\"    It seemed useless to prolong the conversation.    Dodger threw himself on the bed at an early hour, but he did not  undress, thinking there might possibly be a chance to escape during  the night.    But the morning came and found him still a prisoner, but not in the  solitary dwelling.          Chapter XX.  A Midnight Ride.      Curtis Waring had entrapped Dodger for a double purpose.    It was not merely that he thought it possible the boy had the will, or  knew where it was. He had begun to think of the boy's presence in New  York as dangerous to his plans.    John Linden might at any time learn that the son, for whose appearance  he had grieved so bitterly, was still living in the person of this  street boy. Then there would be an end of his hopes of inheriting the  estate.    Only a few months more and the danger would be over, for he felt  convinced that his uncle's tenure of life would be brief. The one  essential thing, then, seemed to be to get Dodger out of the city.    The first step had already been taken; what the next was will soon  appear.    Scarcely had Dodger failed in his attempt to obtain outside assistance  when an unaccountable drowsiness overcame him, considerably to his  surprise.    \"I don't know what's come to me,\" he said to himself. \"It can't be  more than seven or eight o'clock, and yet I feel so sleepy I can  hardly keep my eyes open. I haven't worked any harder than usual  to-day, and I can't understand it.\"    Dodger had reason to be surprised, for he didn't usually retire till  eleven o'clock.    In a city like New York, where many of the streets are tolerably well  filled even at midnight, people get in the way of sitting up much  later than in the country, and Dodger was no exception to this rule.    Yet here he was ready to drop off to sleep before eight o'clock. To  him it was a mystery, for he did not know that the cup of tea which he  had drunk at supper had been drugged by direction of Curtis Waring,  with an ulterior purpose, which will soon appear.    \"I may as well lie down, as there is nothing else to do,\" thought  Dodger. \"There isn't much fun sitting in the dark. If I can sleep, so  much the better.\"    Five minutes had scarcely passed after his head struck the pillow,  when our hero was fast asleep.    At eleven o'clock a hack stopped in front of the house, and Curtis  Waring descended from it.    \"Stay here,\" he said to the driver. \"There will be another passenger.  If you are detained I will make it right when I come to pay you.\"    \"All right, sir,\" said the hackman. \"I don't care how long it is if I  am paid for my time.\"    Curtis opened the door with a pass-key, and found Julius dozing in a  chair in the hall.    \"Wake up, you sleepy-head,\" he said. \"Has anything happened since I  left here?\"    \"Yes, sir; the boy tried to get away.\"    \"Did he? I don't see how he could do that. You kept the door bolted,  didn't you?\"    \"Yes, sir; but he throwed a piece of paper out'n de window, sayin' he  was kep' a prisoner here. A young man picked it up, and came to de  house to ax about it.\"    Curtis looked alarmed.    \"What did you say?\" he inquired, apprehensively.    \"Told him de boy was crazy as a loon--dat he tried to kill his mother  las' week, and had a carvin'-knife hid in his room.\"    \"Good, Julius! I didn't give you credit for such a fertile  imagination.    \"What's dat, massa?\" asked Julius, looking puzzled.    \"I didn't know you were such a skillful liar.\"    \"Yah! yah!\" laughed Julius, quite comprehending this compliment. \"I  reckon I can twis' de trufe pretty well, Massa Curtis!\"    \"You have done well, Julius,\" said Curtis, approvingly. \"Here's a  dollar!\"    The negro was quite effusive in his gratitude.    \"What did the young man say?\"    \"He looked scared. I tol' him he could go up and see de boy if he  wasn't afeared of the carvin'-knife, but he said he guessed he  wouldn't--he didn't like crazy folks.\"    Curtis laughed heartily.    \"So it all ended as it should. Did the boy make any more trouble?\"    \"Yes; he pounded and kicked till I had to go up and see what was the  matter. I didn't give him no satisfaction, and I guess he went to  bed.\"    \"He ought to be in a deep sleep by this time. I will go up and see. Go  up with me, Julius, for I may have to ask you to help me bring him  down.\"    Though Julius was naturally a coward, he felt quite brave when he had  company, and he at once went upstairs with Curtis Waring.    Curtis drew the bolt, and, entering the chamber, his glance fell upon  Dodger, fast asleep on the bed.    \"I am glad the boy did not undress,\" he said. \"It will save me a great  deal of trouble. Now, Julius, you can take his feet and I will lift  his head, and we will take him downstairs.\"    \"S'pos'n he wakes up, Massa Curtis?\"    \"He won't wake up. I took care the sleeping potion should be strong  enough to produce profound slumber for eighteen hours.\"    \"Seems as if he was dead,\" said Julius, nervously.    \"Tush, you fool! He's no more dead than you or I.\"    The hackman looked curious when the two men appeared with their  sleeping burden, and Curtis felt that some explanation was required.    \"The boy has a very painful disease,\" he said, \"and the doctor gave  him a sleeping draught. He is going abroad for his health, and, under  the circumstances, I think it best not to wake him up. Drive slowly  and carefully to Pier No. --, as I don't want the boy aroused if it  can be helped.\"    \"All right, sir.\"    \"Julius, you may lock the door and come with me. I shall need your  help to get him on board the ship.\"    \"All right, Massa Curtis.\"    \"And, mind you, don't go to sleep in the carriage, you black rascal!\"  added Curtis, as he saw that the negro found it hard to keep his eyes  open.    \"All right, massa, I'll keep awake. How am I to get home?\"    \"I will instruct the hackman to take you home.\"    \"Yah, yah; I'll be ridin' like a gentleman!\"    The journey was successfully accomplished, but it took an hour, for,  according to directions, the hackman did not force his pace, but drove  slowly, till he reached the North River pier indicated.    At the pier was a large, stanch vessel--the _Columbia_--bound for San  Francisco, around Cape Horn.    All was dark, but the second officer was pacing the deck.    Curtis Waring hailed him.    \"What time do you get off?\"    \"Early to-morrow morning.\"    \"So the captain told me. I have brought you a passenger.\"    \"The captain told me about him.\"    \"Is his stateroom ready?\"    \"Yes, sir. You are rather late.\"    \"True; and the boy is asleep, as you will see. He is going to make the  voyage for his health, and, as he has been suffering some pain, I  thought I would not wake him up. Who will direct me to his stateroom?\"    The mate summoned the steward, and Dodger, still unconscious, was  brought on board and quietly transferred to the bunk that had been  prepared for him.    It was a critical moment for poor Dodger, but he was quite unconscious  of it.    \"What is the boy's name?\" asked the mate.    \"Arthur Grant. The captain has it on his list. Is he on board?\"    \"Yes; but he is asleep.\"    \"I do not need to see him. I have transacted all necessary business  with him--and paid the passage money. Julius, bring the valise.\"    Julius did so.    \"This contains the boy's clothing. Take it to the stateroom, Julius.\"    \"All right, Massa Curtis.\"    \"What is your usual time between New York and San Francisco?\" asked  Curtis, addressing the mate.    \"From four to six months. Four months is very short, six months very  long. We ought to get there in five months, or perhaps a little  sooner, with average weather.\"    \"Very well. I believe there is no more to be said. Good-night!\"    \"Good-night, sir.\"    \"So he is well out of the way for five months!\" soliloquized Curtis.  \"In five months much may happen. Before that time I hope to be in  possession of my uncle's property. Then I can snap my fingers at  fate.\"          Chapter XXI.  A Seasick Passenger.      The good ship _Columbia_ had got fifty miles under way before Dodger  opened his eyes.    He looked about him languidly at first, but this feeling was succeeded  by the wildest amazement, as his eyes took in his unusual  surroundings.    He had gone to sleep on a bed--he found himself on awakening in a  ship's bunk.    He half arose in his birth, but the motion of the vessel and a slight  feeling of dizziness compelled him to resume a recumbent position.    \"I must be dreaming,\" thought Dodger. \"It's very queer. I am dreaming  I am at sea. I suppose that explains it.\"    He listened and heard the swish of the waters as they beat against the  sides of the vessel.    He noted the pitching of the ship, and there was an unsteady feeling  "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/1860"],[0,"Westward Ho! Or, The Voyages and Adventures of Sir Amyas Leigh, Knight, of (#16)"],[1,"at five o'clock that morning, after the wholesome early  ways of the time, to rouse a well-known stag in the glens at Buckish, by  help of Mr. Coffin's hounds from Portledge. Who being as good a Latiner  as Campian's self, and overhearing both the scraps of psalm and the  \"barbarous islanders,\" pushed his horse alongside of Mr. Eustace  Leigh, and at the first check said, with two low bows towards the two  strangers--    \"I hope Mr. Leigh will do me the honor of introducing me to his guests.  I should be sorry, and Mr. Cary also, that any gentle strangers should  become neighbors of ours, even for a day, without our knowing who they  are who honor our western Thule with a visit; and showing them ourselves  all due requital for the compliment of their presence.\"    After which, the only thing which poor Eustace could do (especially as  it was spoken loud enough for all bystanders), was to introduce in due  form Mr. Evan Morgans and Mr. Morgan Evans, who, hearing the name, and,  what was worse, seeing the terrible face with its quiet searching eye,  felt like a brace of partridge-poults cowering in the stubble, with a  hawk hanging ten feet over their heads.    \"Gentlemen,\" said Sir Richard blandly, cap in hand, \"I fear that your  mails must have been somewhat in your way in this unexpected gallop. If  you will permit my groom, who is behind, to disencumber you of them  and carry them to Chapel, you will both confer an honor on me, and be  enabled yourselves to see the mort more pleasantly.\"    A twinkle of fun, in spite of all his efforts, played about good Sir  Richard's eye as he gave this searching hint. The two Welsh gentlemen  stammered out clumsy thanks; and pleading great haste and fatigue from  a long journey, contrived to fall to the rear and vanish with their  guides, as soon as the slot had been recovered.    \"Will!\" said Sir Richard, pushing alongside of young Cary.    \"Your worship?\"    \"Jesuits, Will!\"    \"May the father of lies fly away with them over the nearest cliff!\"    \"He will not do that while this Irish trouble is about. Those fellows  are come to practise here for Saunders and Desmond.\"    \"Perhaps they have a consecrated banner in their bag, the scoundrels!  Shall I and young Coffin on and stop them? Hard if the honest men may  not rob the thieves once in a way.\"    \"No; give the devil rope, and he will hang himself. Keep thy tongue at  home, and thine eyes too, Will.\"    \"How then?\"    \"Let Clovelly beach be watched night and day like any mousehole. No one  can land round Harty Point with these south-westers. Stop every fellow  who has the ghost of an Irish brogue, come he in or go he out, and send  him over to me.\"    \"Some one should guard Bude-haven, sir.\"    \"Leave that to me. Now then, forward, gentlemen all, or the stag will  take the sea at the Abbey.\"    And on they crashed down the Hartland glens, through the oak-scrub and  the great crown-ferns; and the baying of the slow-hound and the tantaras  of the horn died away farther and fainter toward the blue Atlantic,  while the conspirators, with lightened hearts, pricked fast across  Bursdon upon their evil errand. But Eustace Leigh had other thoughts  and other cares than the safety of his father's two mysterious guests,  important as that was in his eyes; for he was one of the many who had  drunk in sweet poison (though in his case it could hardly be called  sweet) from the magic glances of the Rose of Torridge. He had seen her  in the town, and for the first time in his life fallen utterly in love;  and now that she had come down close to his father's house, he looked on  her as a lamb fallen unawares into the jaws of the greedy wolf, which  he felt himself to be. For Eustace's love had little or nothing of  chivalry, self-sacrifice, or purity in it; those were virtues which were  not taught at Rheims. Careful as the Jesuits were over the practical  morality of their pupils, this severe restraint had little effect in  producing real habits of self-control. What little Eustace had learnt of  women from them, was as base and vulgar as the rest of their teaching.  What could it be else, if instilled by men educated in the schools of  Italy and France, in the age which produced the foul novels of Cinthio  and Bandello, and compelled Rabelais in order to escape the rack and  stake, to hide the light of his great wisdom, not beneath a bushel, but  beneath a dunghill; the age in which the Romish Church had made  marriage a legalized tyranny, and the laity, by a natural and pardonable  revulsion, had exalted adultery into a virtue and a science? That all  love was lust; that all women had their price; that profligacy, though  an ecclesiastical sin, was so pardonable, if not necessary, as to be  hardly a moral sin, were notions which Eustace must needs have gathered  from the hints of his preceptors; for their written works bear to this  day fullest and foulest testimony that such was their opinion; and that  their conception of the relation of the sexes was really not a whit  higher than that of the profligate laity who confessed to them. He  longed to marry Rose Salterne, with a wild selfish fury; but only that  he might be able to claim her as his own property, and keep all others  from her. Of her as a co-equal and ennobling helpmate; as one in whose  honor, glory, growth of heart and soul, his own were inextricably wrapt  up, he had never dreamed. Marriage would prevent God from being angry  with that, with which otherwise He might be angry; and therefore the  sanction of the Church was the more \"probable and safe\" course. But as  yet his suit was in very embryo. He could not even tell whether Rose  knew of his love; and he wasted miserable hours in maddening thoughts,  and tost all night upon his sleepless bed, and rose next morning fierce  and pale, to invent fresh excuses for going over to her uncle's house,  and lingering about the fruit which he dared not snatch.        CHAPTER IV    THE TWO WAYS OF BEING CROST IN LOVE         \"I could not love thee, dear, so much,       Loved I not honor more.\"--LOVELACE.    And what all this while has become of the fair breaker of so many  hearts, to whom I have not yet even introduced my readers?    She was sitting in the little farm-house beside the mill, buried in the  green depths of the valley of Combe, half-way between Stow and Chapel,  sulking as much as her sweet nature would let her, at being thus  shut out from all the grand doings at Bideford, and forced to keep a  Martinmas Lent in that far western glen. So lonely was she, in fact,  that though she regarded Eustace Leigh with somewhat of aversion, and  (being a good Protestant) with a great deal of suspicion, she could not  find it in her heart to avoid a chat with him whenever he came down to  the farm and to its mill, which he contrived to do, on I know not what  would-be errand, almost every day. Her uncle and aunt at first looked  stiff enough at these visits, and the latter took care always to make a  third in every conversation; but still Mr. Leigh was a gentleman's  son, and it would not do to be rude to a neighboring squire and a good  customer; and Rose was the rich man's daughter and they poor cousins,  so it would not do either to quarrel with her; and besides, the  pretty maid, half by wilfulness, and half by her sweet winning tricks,  generally contrived to get her own way wheresoever she went; and  she herself had been wise enough to beg her aunt never to leave them  alone,--for she \"could not a-bear the sight of Mr. Eustace, only  she must have some one to talk with down here.\" On which her aunt  considered, that she herself was but a simple country-woman; and that  townsfolks' ways of course must be very different from hers; and that  people knew their own business best; and so forth, and let things go  on their own way. Eustace, in the meanwhile, who knew well that the  difference in creed between him and Rose was likely to be the very  hardest obstacle in the way of his love, took care to keep his private  opinions well in the background; and instead of trying to convert the  folk at the mill, daily bought milk or flour from them, and gave it  away to the old women in Moorwinstow (who agreed that after all, for  a Papist, he was a godly young man enough); and at last, having taken  counsel with Campian and Parsons on certain political plots then on  foot, came with them to the conclusion that they would all three go to  church the next Sunday. Where Messrs. Evan Morgans and Morgan Evans,  having crammed up the rubrics beforehand, behaved themselves in a most  orthodox and unexceptionable manner; as did also poor Eustace, to the  great wonder of all good folks, and then went home flattering himself  that he had taken in parson, clerk, and people; not knowing in his  simple unsimplicity, and cunning foolishness, that each good wife in the  parish was saying to the other, \"He turned Protestant? The devil turned  monk! He's only after Mistress Salterne, the young hypocrite.\"    But if the two Jesuits found it expedient, for the holy cause in which  they were embarked, to reconcile themselves outwardly to the powers  that were, they were none the less busy in private in plotting their  overthrow.    Ever since April last they had been playing at hide-and-seek through the  length and breadth of England, and now they were only lying quiet till  expected news from Ireland should give them their cue, and a great  \"rising of the West\" should sweep from her throne that stiff-necked,  persecuting, excommunicate, reprobate, illegitimate, and profligate  usurper, who falsely called herself the Queen of England.    For they had as stoutly persuaded themselves in those days, as they  have in these (with a real Baconian contempt of the results of sensible  experience), that the heart of England was really with them, and that  the British nation was on the point of returning to the bosom of the  Catholic Church, and"]]]
