[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/18500"],[0,"The Complete Works of Robert Burns: Containing his Poems, Songs, and (#16)"],[1," to remember her:--when wine circulated, Mrs. Mac  was his favourite toast.    During this season he began his lyric contributions to the Musical  Museum of Johnson, a work which, amid many imperfections of taste and  arrangement, contains more of the true old music and genuine old songs  of Scotland, than any other collection with which I am acquainted.  Burns gathered oral airs, and fitted them with words of mirth or of  woe, of tenderness or of humour, with unexampled readiness and  felicity; he eked out old fragments and sobered down licentious  strains so much in the olden spirit and feeling, that the new cannot  be distinguished from the ancient; nay, he inserted lines and half  lines, with such skill and nicety, that antiquarians are perplexed to  settle which is genuine or which is simulated. Yet with all this he  abated not of the natural mirth or the racy humour of the lyric muse  of Scotland: he did not like her the less because she walked like some  of the maidens of her strains, high-kilted at times, and spoke with  the freedom of innocence. In these communications we observe how  little his border-jaunt among the fountains of ancient song  contributed either of sentiment or allusion, to his lyrics; and how  deeply his strains, whether of pity or of merriment, were coloured by  what he had seen, and heard, and felt in the Highlands. In truth, all  that lay beyond the Forth was an undiscovered land to him; while the  lowland districts were not only familiar to his mind and eye, but all  their more romantic vales and hills and streams were already musical  in songs of such excellence as induced him to dread failure rather  than hope triumph. Moreover, the Highlands teemed with jacobitical  feelings, and scenes hallowed by the blood or the sufferings of men  heroic, and perhaps misguided; and the poet, willingly yielding to an  impulse which was truly romantic, and believed by thousands to be  loyal, penned his songs on Drumossie, and Killiecrankie, as the  spirit of sorrow or of bitterness prevailed. Though accompanied,  during his northern excursions, by friends whose socialities and  conversation forbade deep thought, or even serious remark, it will be  seen by those who read his lyrics with care, that his wreath is  indebted for some of its fairest flowers to the Highlands.    The second winter of the poet's abode in Edinburgh had now arrived: it  opened, as might have been expected, with less rapturous welcomes and  with more of frosty civility than the first. It must be confessed,  that indulgence in prolonged socialities, and in company which, though  clever, could not be called select, contributed to this; nor must it  be forgotten that his love for the sweeter part of creation was now  and then carried beyond the limits of poetic respect, and the  delicacies of courtesy; tending to estrange the austere and to lessen  the admiration at first common to all. Other causes may be assigned  for this wane of popularity: he took no care to conceal his contempt  for all who depended on mere scholarship for eminence, and he had a  perilous knack in sketching with a sarcastic hand the characters of  the learned and the grave. Some indeed of the high literati of the  north--Home, the author of Douglas, was one of them--spoke of the poet  as a chance or an accident: and though they admitted that he was a  poet, yet he was not one of settled grandeur of soul, brightened by  study. Burns was probably aware of this; he takes occasion in some of  his letters to suggest, that the hour may be at hand when he shall be  accounted by scholars as a meteor, rather than a fixed light, and to  suspect that the praise bestowed on his genius was partly owing to the  humility of his condition. From his lingering so long about Edinburgh,  the nobility began to dread a second volume by subscription, the  learned to regard him as a fierce Theban, who resolved to carry all  the outworks to the temple of Fame without the labour of making  regular approaches; while a third party, and not the least numerous,  looked on him with distrust, as one who hovered between Jacobite and  Jacobin; who disliked the loyal-minded, and loved to lampoon the  reigning family. Besides, the marvel of the inspired ploughman had  begun to subside; the bright gloss of novelty was worn off, and his  fault lay in his unwillingness to see that he had made all the sport  which the Philistines expected, and was required to make room for some  \"salvage\" of the season, to paw, and roar, and shake the mane. The  doors of the titled, which at first opened spontaneous, like those in  Milton's heaven, were now unclosed for him with a tardy courtesy: he  was received with measured stateliness, and seldom requested to repeat  his visit. Of this changed aspect of things he complained to a friend:  but his real sorrows were mixed with those of the fancy:--he told Mrs.  Dunlop with what pangs of heart he was compelled to take shelter in a  corner, lest the rattling equipage of some gaping blockhead should  mangle him in the mire. In this land of titles and wealth such  querulous sensibilities must have been frequently offended.    Burns, who had talked lightly hitherto of resuming the plough, began  now to think seriously about it, for he saw it must come to that at  last. Miller, of Dalswinton, a gentleman of scientific acquirements,  and who has the merit of applying the impulse of steam to navigation,  had offered the poet the choice of his farms, on a fair estate which  he had purchased on the Nith: aided by a westland farmer, he selected  Ellisland, a beautiful spot, fit alike for the steps of ploughman or  poet. On intimating this to the magnates of Edinburgh, no one lamented  that a genius so bright and original should be driven to win his bread  with the sweat of his brow: no one, with an indignant eye, ventured to  tell those to whom the patronage of this magnificent empire was  confided, that they were misusing the sacred trust, and that posterity  would curse them for their coldness or neglect: neither did any of the  rich nobles, whose tables he had adorned by his wit, offer to enable  him to toil free of rent, in a land of which he was to be a permanent  ornament;--all were silent--all were cold--the Earl of Glencairn  alone, aided by Alexander Wood, a gentleman who merits praise oftener  than he is named, did the little that was done or attempted to be done  for him: nor was that little done on the peer's part without  solicitation:--\"I wish to go into the excise;\" thus he wrote to  Glencairn; \"and I am told your lordship's interest will easily procure  me the grant from the commissioners: and your lordship's patronage and  goodness, which have already rescued me from obscurity, wretchedness,  and exile, emboldens me to ask that interest. You have likewise put it  in my power to save the little tie of home that sheltered an aged  mother, two brothers, and three sisters from destruction. I am ill  qualified to dog the heels of greatness with the impertinence of  solicitation, and tremble nearly as much at the thought of the cold  promise as the cold denial.\" The farm and the excise exhibit the  poet's humble scheme of life: the money of the one, he thought, would  support the toil of the other, and in the fortunate management of  both, he looked for the rough abundance, if not the elegancies  suitable to a poet's condition.    While Scotland was disgraced by sordidly allowing her brightest genius  to descend to the plough and the excise, the poet hastened his  departure from a city which had witnessed both his triumph and his  shame: he bade farewell in a few well-chosen words to such of the  classic literati--the Blairs, the Stewarts, the Mackenzies, and the  Tytlers--as had welcomed the rustic bard and continued to countenance  him; while in softer accents he bade adieu to the Clarindas and  Chlorises of whose charms he had sung, and, having wrung a settlement  from Creech, he turned his steps towards Mossgiel and Mauchline. He  had several reasons, and all serious ones, for taking Ayrshire in his  way to the Nith: he desired to see his mother, his brothers and  sisters, who had partaken of his success, and were now raised from  pining penury to comparative affluence: he desired to see those who  had aided him in his early struggles into the upper air--perhaps  those, too, who had looked coldly on, and smiled at his outward  aspirations after fame or distinction; but more than all, he desired  to see one whom he once and still dearly loved, who had been a  sufferer for his sake, and whom he proposed to make mistress of his  fireside and the sharer of his fortunes. Even while whispering of love  to Charlotte Hamilton, on the banks of the Devon, or sighing out the  affected sentimentalities of platonic or pastoral love in the ear of  Clarinda, his thoughts wandered to her whom he had left bleaching her  webs among the daisies on Mauchline braes--she had still his heart,  and in spite of her own and her father's disclamation, she was his  wife. It was one of the delusions of this great poet, as well as of  those good people, the Armours, that the marriage had been dissolved  by the destruction of the marriage-lines, and that Robert Burns and  Jean Armour were as single as though they had neither vowed nor  written themselves man and wife. Be that as it may, the time was come  when all scruples and obstacles were to be removed which stood in the  way of their union: their hands were united by Gavin Hamilton,  according to law, in April, 1788: and even the Reverend Mr. Auld, so  mercilessly lampooned, smiled forgivingly as the poet satisfied a  church wisely scrupulous regarding the sacred ceremony of marriage.    Though Jean Armour was but a country lass of humble degree, she had  sense and intelligence, and personal charms sufficient not only to win  and fix the attentions of the poet, but to sanction the praise which  he showered on her in song.

Somebody put the tables back, please, and  be sure the trestles are in their right places this time, we don't want  another collapse! Phyllis, your cough's worse. Nurse shall rub your  chest with camphorated oil, and you mustn't kiss anybody. Betty too?  I'll give you a lozenge, but don't suck it lying down in bed, in case  you choke.\"    So saying, Mrs. Best, who generally mothered the hostel, dismissed her  large family and bustled away with Nurse to superintend the putting to  bed of the juniors and the due care of those who might be regarded as  even ever so slightly on the sick list. It was perhaps owing to the  excitement of their spirited performance that the members of No. 2  Dormitory could not get to sleep that night. They all lay wide awake in  bed, and told each other tales about burglars, in whispers. Verity's  stories were blood-curdling in the extreme; she was a great reader, and  had got them from magazines. Her three room-mates listened with cold  shivers running down their spines. According to Verity's accounts it was  a common and every day occurrence for a house-breaker to force an  entrance, murder the occupants, and depart, leaving a case to baffle the  police until some amateur detective turned up and solved the mystery.    \"Has it ever struck you that the hostel would be a very easy place to  burgle?\" asked Fil. \"Those French windows have no shutters, and the  glass could be cut with a diamond.\"    \"Or the doors could be opened with a skeleton key!\" quavered Nora.    \"I suppose they generally wear goloshes, so as to tread softly,\"  ventured Ingred.    \"Wouldn't it be dreadful,\" continued Verity, whose mind still ran on  magazine stories, \"to marry a fascinating man whom you'd met by chance,  and then find out that he was a gentleman-burglar? What would you do?\"    \"It often happens on the cinema,\" said Nora. \"The girl wavers about in  an agony whether to tell or not, and wrings her hands and rolls her  eyes, like they always _do_ roll them on the films, and then, just when  things are at the very last gasp, the husband tumbles over a precipice,  or is wrecked at sea, or smashed in a railway accident, and she marries  the other, who's as good as gold, and loved her first.\"    \"Is the man who loves you first always as good as gold?\" asked Fil.    \"Well, generally on the Pictures. He's loved you as a child, you see.  You come on the film hand in hand, in socks, and he gives you his  apple.\"    \"But suppose they don't love you from a child?\" said Fil plaintively.  \"I've only known a lot of horrid little boys whom I didn't care for in  the least. None of them ever gave me his apple, though I remember one  taking mine. Is the first fascinating man I meet the true lover or the  burglar? How am I to know which is which?\"    \"You'd better let me be there to decide for you, child, or you'll be  snapped up by the first adventurer that comes along,\" declared Nora.  \"Don't trust him if he has a mustache. 'Daring Dick of the Black Gang'  had a little twisted mustache like Mephistopheles in 'Faust'.\"    \"Oh dear! And the last piece I saw on the Pictures, the villain was  clean shaven! That's no guide at all!\"    \"Girls, you're breaking the silence rule!\" said Mrs. Best, opening the  door of Dormitory 2, where the conversation, which had begun in  whispers, had risen to a pitch audible on the landing outside. \"This  doesn't look like scoring again next week, and giving another  performance. Why, Nora, the rain's driving through that open window  straight on to your bed! You'll be getting rheumatism! I shall shut it,  and leave the door wide open for air instead. Now be good girls and go  to sleep at once. Don't let me hear any more talking.\"    The Foursomes, in common with most of the hostel, were fond of Mrs.  Best, so they turned over obediently, and composed themselves to  slumber. They were really tired by this time, and dropped off into the  land of Nod before the clock on the stairs had chimed another quarter.  How long she slept, Ingred did not know. She dreamt quite a long and  circumstantial dream of wandering on the cliffs near the sea with a  gentleman-burglar, who was telling her his intention of raiding  Buckingham Palace and taking away the Crown Jewels, and she heard his  daring designs (as we always do in dreams) without the slightest  surprise or any suggestion that the Crown Jewels are kept at the Tower  instead of at Buckingham Palace. She woke suddenly, and laughed at the  absurdity of the idea. She felt hot, and threw back her eiderdown. The  other girls were sleeping quietly, and the rain was still beating  against the window in heavy showers, for it was a stormy night. The door  of the bedroom stood wide open. What was that sound coming up the stairs  from the hall below? It was certainly not the ticking of the clock. It  seemed more like muffled and stealthy footsteps. In an instant Ingred  was very wide awake indeed, and listening intently. There it came again!  She could not lie still and ignore it. She got out of bed, and with  rather shaking knees walked on to the landing and peeped over the  banisters. There was a tiny oil-lamp hanging on the wall; it faintly  illuminated the stairs. Was that somebody moving about in the darkness  of the hall? If it was a burglar, he certainly must not come upstairs,  or she would die of fright. An idea occurred to her, and acting on a  sudden impulse she dashed into Dormitory 2, roused the others, and told  them to snatch what missiles they could, and hurry to her aid.    \"We'll fling things at him if he tries to come up!\" she gasped, groping  for her boots.    It was a horrible experience: four nervous, quaking girls stood in the  dim light on the landing gazing down into the haunted blackness of the  shadowy hall. The sounds had ceased temporarily, but now they began  again--a distinct shuffling as of footsteps, and even a subdued sniff,  then the outline of a dark figure made its appearance, bearing straight  for the stairs.    With quite commendable bravery Ingred flung her boots at it, which  missiles were instantly followed by Nora's hairbrush, Fil's dispatch  case, and Verity's pillow. It screamed in a most unburglar-like voice,  and apparently with genuine fright.    \"If you t-t-t-try to c-c-come nearer, I'll sh-sh-shoot you dead!\"  quavered Ingred, wishing she had at least some semblance of a pistol to  bluff with.    \"What _are_ you doing, girls?\" replied the dark shadow, persisting in  its movement towards the staircase, and, as it came into the faint  circle of radiance spread by the lamp, resolving itself into the  familiar form of Nurse Warner. \"Have you suddenly gone mad?\"    Here was a situation! The four girls flew back to their dormitory in  great haste, especially as Mrs. Best, disturbed by the noise, had opened  her door and come on to the scene in a pink-and-gray dressing-gown. They  were followed, however, by both Matron and Nurse, and forced to give an  explanation of their extraordinary conduct.    \"I couldn't sleep for the wind, so I put on my felt slippers and my  cloak, and went downstairs for a biscuit,\" declared Nurse Warner, whose  voice sounded rather aggrieved. \"I didn't think I should disturb  anybody.\"    \"You girls are the limit with your silly notions!\" said Mrs. Best,  really angry for once. \"If you fill your heads with absurd ideas about  burglars before you go to sleep, of course you can imagine anything. If  I hear any more talking in No. 2 another night after the lights are out,  I shall separate you, and send each of you to sleep in another  dormitory. I'll not have the house upset like this! So you know what to  expect. Are you all in your beds? Then not another word!\"    \"It's very uncomfy without my pillow!\" whispered naughty Verity, in  distinct disobedience to this mandate, as the door of Mrs. Best's room  closed. \"Dare I go and fetch it?\"    \"Sh! Sh! No!\"    \"I know what we'll give Nursie for a Christmas present,\" murmured Fil  softly. \"A nice ornamental tin box of biscuits to keep in her bedroom.  She shan't get hungry in the night again, poor dear!\"    \"_Sh! Sh! Will_ you go to sleep!\" warned Ingred emphatically.          CHAPTER X    The Whispering Stones      The Saxon family had squeezed themselves and certain of their  possessions into the little home at Wynch-on-the-Wold, and while flowers  still bloomed in the garden and apples hung ripe on the trees it seemed  a kind of continuation of their summer holiday; but as the novelty wore  off, and stormy weather came on, their altered circumstances began to be  more evident. Most of us can make a plucky fight against fate at  first--there had been something rather romantic about retiring to the  bungalow--but the plain prose of the proceeding was yet to come, and  there were certainly many disadvantages to be faced. Mr. Saxon was  worried about business affairs; he was a proud, sensitive man, and felt  it a great \"come down\" to be obliged to resign Rotherwood, and the  social position it had stood for, and confess himself to the world as  one of the \"newly poor.\" It was humiliating to have to walk or take a  tram where he had formerly used his car in fulfilling his professional  engagements, hard not to be able to entertain his friends, and perhaps  hardest of all to be obliged to refuse subscriptions to the numerous  charities in the town where his name had always stood conspicuously upon  the liberal list. His temper, never his strongest point, suffered under  the test, and he would come home from Grovebury in the evenings tired  out, moody and fretful, and inclined to find fault with everything and  everybody.    It took all his wife's sunny sweetness of disposition to keep the home  atmosphere cheerful and peaceful, for Egbert also had a temper, and was  bitterly disappointed at not being sent to Cambridge, and at having to  settle down in"]]]
