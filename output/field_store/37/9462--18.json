It was too early yet to  see about lodgings. He went to a little coffee-house that was already  open for the use of the workmen, had some breakfast there, and then  walked about for two or three hours until London was astir, leaving his  things at the coffee-house. Then he went to a pawnbroker's and pawned  his watch and chain. Then, having fetched his things from the  coffee-house, he went into the Edgware Road and took an omnibus down to  Victoria and then walked on across Vauxhall Bridge, and set to work to  look for lodgings.    He was not long in finding a bed-room to let, and here he installed  himself. He was convinced Captain Clinton would have a vigilant search  made for him, but he thought that he was now fairly safe, however sharp  the detectives might be in their hunt for him. He felt deeply the sorrow  there would be at home, for he knew that up to now he and Rupert had  been loved equally, and that even the discovery that he had had no right  to the care and kindness he had received would make no great difference  in their feeling towards him. Had the change of children been really the  result of accident, he would not have acted as he had done.    He himself had had no hand in the fraud, but were he to accept anything  now from Captain Clinton he felt that he would be an accessary to it.  Had not his mother, his own mother, proposed that he should take part in  the plot, that he should go on deceiving them, and even that he should  rob Rupert altogether of his inheritance? It was too horrible to think  of. There was nothing for it that he could see but for him to go out  utterly from their lives, and to fight his way alone until he could, at  any rate, show them that he needed nothing and would accept nothing. He  was dimly conscious himself that he was acting unkindly and unfairly to  them, and that after all they had done for him they had a right to have  a say as to his future; but at present his pride was too hurt, he was  too sore and humiliated to listen to the whisper of conscience, and his  sole thought was to hide himself and to make his own way in the world.    Lest his resolution should be shaken he carefully abstained from a  perusal of the papers, lest his eye might fall upon an advertisement  begging him to return. His mind was made up that he would enlist. He  knew that at present he could not do so as a private, but he thought  that he might be accepted as a trumpeter. He thought it probable that  they would guess that such was his intention, and would have given a  description of him at the recruiting offices. It was for this reason  that he determined to live as long as he could upon his money before  trying to enlist, as if some time elapsed he would be less likely to be  recognized as answering the description that might be given by Captain  Clinton than if he made the attempt at once. From Vauxhall he often  crossed to Westminster, and soon struck up an acquaintance with some of  the recruiting sergeants.    \"Want to enlist, eh?\" one of them said.    \"I am thinking of entering as a trumpeter.\"    \"Well, you might do that. There are plenty of younger lads than you are  trumpeters in the cavalry. I will look at the list and see what  regiments have vacancies; but I doubt whether they will take you without  a letter from your father saying that you are enlisting with his  consent.\"    \"I have no father that I know of,\" Edgar said.    \"Well, then, it is likely they will want a certificate from a clergyman  or your schoolmaster as to character; and I expect,\" the sergeant said  shrewdly, \"you would have a difficulty in getting such a paper.\"    Edgar nodded.    \"Well, lad, if you have quite made up your mind about it, my advice  would be, do not try here. In London they are a lot more particular than  they are down in the country, and I should say you are a good deal more  likely to rub through at Aldershot or Canterbury than you would be here.  They are more particular here. You see, they have no great interest in  filling up the ranks of a regiment, while when you go to the regiment  itself, the doctors and officers and all of them like seeing it up to  its full strength, so their interest is to pass a recruit if they can. I  have known scores and hundreds of men rejected here tramp down to  Aldershot, or take the train if they had money enough in their pockets  to pay the fare, and get passed without a shadow of difficulty.\"    \"I would rather not enlist for the next month or two,\" Edgar said;  \"there might be somebody asking after me.\"    \"If you will take my advice, lad, you will go back to your friends.  There are many young fellows run away from home, but most of them are  precious sorry for it afterwards.\"    \"I am not likely to be sorry for it, sergeant, and if I am I shall not  go back. Do you think I could find anyone who would give me lessons on  the trumpet?\"    \"I should say that there would not be any difficulty about that. There  is nothing you cannot have in London if you have got money to pay for  it. If you were to go up to the Albany Barracks and get hold of the  trumpet-major, he would tell you who would teach you. He would not do it  himself, I daresay, but some of the trumpeters would be glad to give you  an hour a day if you can pay for it. Of course it would save you a lot  of trouble afterwards if you could sound the trumpet before you joined.\"    Edgar took the advice, and found a trumpeter in the Blues who agreed to  go out with him for an hour every day on to Primrose Hill, and there  teach him to sound the trumpet. He accordingly gave up his room at  Vauxhall, and moved across to the north side of Regent's Park. For six  weeks he worked for an hour a day with his instructor, who, upon his  depositing a pound with him as a guarantee for its return, borrowed a  trumpet for him, and with this Edgar would start of a morning, and  walking seven or eight miles into the country, spend hours in eliciting  the most mournful and startling sounds from the instrument.    At the end of the six weeks his money was nearly gone, although he had  lived most economically, and accordingly, after returning the trumpet to  his instructor, who, although he had been by no means chary of abuse  while the lessons were going on, now admitted that he had got on  first-rate, he went down to Aldershot, where his friend the recruiting  sergeant had told him that they were short of a trumpeter or two in the  1st Hussars.    It was as well that Edgar had allowed the two months to pass before  endeavouring to enlist, for after a month had been vainly spent in the  search for him, Rupert had suggested to his father that although too  young to enlist in the ranks Edgar might have tried to go in as a  trumpeter, and inquiries had been made at all the recruiting depots  whether a lad answering to his description had so enlisted. The sergeant  had given him a note to a sergeant of his acquaintance in the Hussars.    \"I put it pretty strong, young un,\" his friend had said when he gave him  the note; \"mind you stick to what I say.\"    The sergeant had indeed--incited partly perhaps by a liking for the lad,  partly by a desire to return an equivalent for the sovereign with which  Edgar had presented him--drawn somewhat upon his imagination. \"I have  known the young chap for a very long time,\" he said; \"his father and  mother died years ago, and though I am no relation to him he looks upon  me as his guardian as it were. He has learned the trumpet a bit, and  will soon be able to sound all the calls. He will make a smart young  soldier, and will, I expect, take his place in the ranks as soon as he  is old enough. Do the best you can for him, and keep an eye on him.\"    \"I will take you round to the trumpet-major,\" the sergeant said; \"he had  better go with you to the adjutant. You know what Sergeant M'Bride says  in this letter?\"    \"No, I don't know exactly what he says. He told me he would introduce me  to you, and that you would, he was sure, do your best to put me  through.\"    \"Well, you had better hear what he does say. It is always awkward to  have misunderstandings. He says you have lost your father and mother;  you understand that?\"    \"That's right,\" Edgar said quietly.    \"And that he has known you for a very long time?\"    Edgar nodded.    \"It seems to me a very long time,\" he added.    \"And that though he is no actual relation of yours he considers he  stands in the light of your guardian. That is important, you know.\"    \"I will remember that,\" Edgar said. \"There is certainly no one as far as  I know who has a better right than Sergeant M'Bride to advise me, or  give me permission to enlist.\"    \"Well, you stick to that and you are all right. Now, come along.\"    \"I wonder who the young chap is,\" the sergeant said to himself as they  crossed the barrack yard. \"As to what M'Bride said, we know all about  that; I have been on the recruiting staff myself. But I think the young  un was speaking the truth. He has lost his father and mother, he has  known M'Bride for some time, and he has got no one who has any right to  interfere with him. Rum, too. The boy is a gentleman all over, though he  has rigged himself out in those clothes. Well, we are short of  trumpeters, and I don't suppose the adjutant will inquire very closely.\"    The trumpet-major was quite willing to do his share of the business. He  was glad to fill up one of the vacancies, especially as it seemed that  the new-comer would soon be able to take his place in the ranks; and  after asking a few questions he went across with him to the adjutant.  The latter looked at Edgar critically.    \"Smart young fellow,\" he said to himself. \"Got into some scrape at home,  I suppose, and run away. Of course he has some got-up lie ready. Well,  sergeant, what is it?\"    \"Lad wishes to enlist as a trumpeter, sir. Here is a letter from his  next friend, "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/22010"],[0,"The Tribes and Castes of the Central Provinces of India, Volume 2 (#16)"],[1,"69] that in northern India,  \"The standard of morality is very low because in Muzaffarnagar it is  extremely rare for a Bawaria woman to live with her husband. Almost  invariably she lives with another man: but the official husband is  responsible for the children.\" The great difference in the standard  of morality is certainly surprising.    In Gujarat [70] the Vaghris have _gurus_ or religious preceptors of  their own. These men take an eight-anna silver piece and whisper in the  ear of their disciples \"Be immortal.\"... \"The Bhuvas or priest-mediums  play an important part in many Vaghri ceremonies. A Bhuva is a male  child born after the mother has made a vow to the goddess Vihat  or Devi that if a son be granted to her she will devote him to the  service of the goddess. No Bhuva may cut or shave his hair on pain  of a fine of ten rupees, and no Bhuva may eat carrion or food cooked  by a Muhammadan.\"        17. Criminal practices.      The criminal Bagris still usually travel about in the disguise of  Gosains and Bairagis, and are very difficult of detection except to  real religious mendicants. Their housebreaking implement or jemmy  is known as _Gyan_, but in speaking of it they always add _Das_,  so that it sounds like the name of a Bairagi. [71] They are usually  very much afraid of the _gyan_ being discovered on their persons,  and are careful to bury it in the ground at each halting-place,  while on the march it may be concealed in a pack-saddle. The means of  identifying them, Mr. Kennedy remarks, [72] is by their family _deo_  or god, which they carry about when wandering with their families. It  consists of a brass or copper box containing grains of wheat and the  seeds of a creeper, both soaked in _ghi_ (melted butter). The box with  a peacock's feather and a bell is wrapped in two white and then in  two red cloths, one of the white cloths having the print of a man's  hand dipped in goat's blood upon it. The grains of wheat are used  for taking the omens, a few being thrown up at sun-down and counted  afterwards to see whether they are odd or even. When even, two grains  are placed on the right hand of the omen-taker, and if this occurs  three times running the auspices are considered to be favourable. [73]  Mr. Gayer [74] notes that the Badhaks have usually from one to three  brands from a hot iron on the inside of their left wrist. Those of  them who are hunters brand the muscles of the left wrist in order to  steady the hand when firing their matchlocks. The customs of wearing  a peculiar necklace of small wooden beads and a kind of gold pin  fixed to the front teeth, which Mr. Crooke [75] records as having  been prevalent some years ago, have apparently been since abandoned,  as they are not mentioned in more recent accounts. The Dehliwal and  Malpura Baorias have, Mr. Kennedy states, [76] an interesting system of  signs, which they mark on the walls of buildings at important corners,  bridges and cross-roads and on the ground by the roadside with a stick,  if no building is handy. The commonest is a loop, the straight line  indicating the direction a gang or individual has taken:                           ________________________                       /                      /  /---\\                     (  ( /// )                      \\  \\---/                       \\________      The addition of a number of vertical strokes inside the loop signifies  the number of males in a gang. If these strokes are enclosed by a  circle it means that the gang is encamped in the vicinity; while  a square inside a circle and line as below means that property has  been secured by friends who have left in the direction pointed by the  line. It is said that Baorias will follow one another up for fifty  or even a hundred miles by means of these hieroglyphics. The signs  are bold marks, sometimes even a foot or more in length, and are  made where they will at once catch the eye. When the Marwari Baorias  desire to indicate to others of their caste, who may follow in their  footsteps, the route taken, a member of the gang, usually a woman,  trails a stick in the dust as she walks along, leaving a spiral track  on the ground. Another method of indicating the route taken is to  place leaves under stones at intervals along the road. [77] The form  of crime most in favour among the ordinary Baoris is housebreaking  by night. Their common practice is to make a hole in the wall beside  the door through which the hand passes to raise the latch; and only  occasionally they dig a hole in the base of the wall to admit of the  passage of a man, while another favoured alternative is to break in  through a barred window, the bars being quickly and forcibly bent and  drawn out. [78] One class of Marwari Bagris are also expert coiners.                           /-------\\                      /  +---+  \\                      |  |   |  |---------------------                      \\  +---+  /                       \\-------/              Bahna        1. Nomenclature and internal structure.        _Bahna, Pinjara, Dhunia._ [79]--The occupational caste of  cotton-cleaners. The Bahnas numbered 48,000 persons in the Central  Provinces and Berar in 1911. The large increase in the number  of ginning-factories has ruined the Bahna's trade of cleaning  hand-ginned cotton, and as no distinction attaches to the name of  Bahna it is possible that members of the caste who have taken to  other occupations may have abandoned it and returned themselves simply  as Muhammadans. The three names Bahna, Pinjara, Dhunia appear to be  used indifferently for the caste in this Province, though in other  parts of India they are distinguished. Pinjara is derived from the  word _pinjan_ used for a cotton-bow, and Dhunia is from _dhunna_,  to card cotton. The caste is also known as Dhunak Pathani. Though  professing the Muhammadan religion, they still have many Hindu  customs and ceremonies, and in the matter of inheritance our courts  have held that they are subject to Hindu and not Muhammadan law. [80]  In Raipur a girl receives half the share of a boy in the division of  inherited property. The caste appears to be a mixed occupational group,  and is split into many territorial subcastes named after the different  parts of the country from which its members have come, as Badharia from  Badhas in Mirzapur, Sarsutia from the Saraswati river, Berari of Berar,  Dakhni from the Deccan, Telangi from Madras, Pardeshi from northern  India, and so on. Two groups are occupational, the Newaris of Saugor,  who make the thick _newar_ tape used for the webbing of beds, and  the Kanderas, who make fireworks and generally constitute a separate  caste. There is considerable ground for supposing that the Bahnas  are mainly derived from the caste of Telis or oil-pressers. In the  Punjab Sir D. Ibbetson says [81] that the Penja or cotton-scutcher is  an occupational name applied to Telis who follow this profession; and  that the Penja, Kasai and Teli are all of the same caste. Similarly  in Nasik the Telis and Pinjaras are said to form one community,  under the government of a single _panchayat_. In cases of dispute  or misconduct the usual penalty is temporary excommunication, which  is known as the stopping of food and water. [82] The Telis are an  enterprising community of very low status, and would therefore be  naturally inclined to take to other occupations; many of them are  shopkeepers, cultivators and landholders, and it is quite probable  that in past times they took up the Bahna's profession and changed  their religion with the hope of improving their social status. The  Telis are generally considered to be quarrelsome and talkative,  and the Bahnas or Dhunias have the same characteristics. If one man  abusing another lapses into Billingsgate, the other will say to him,  '_Hamko Julaha Dhunia neh jano_,' or 'Don't talk to me as if I was  a Julaha or a Dhunia.'        2. Marriage.      Some Bahnas have exogamous sections with Hindu names, while others  are without these, and simply regulate their marriages by rules of  relationship. They have the primitive Hindu custom of allowing a  sister's son to marry a brother's daughter, but not _vice versa_. A  man cannot marry his wife's younger sister during her lifetime, nor  her elder sister at any time. Children of the same foster-mother are  also not allowed to marry. Their marriages are performed by a Kazi  with an imitation of the Nikah rite. The bridegroom's party sit under  the marriage-shed, and the bride with the women of her party inside  the house. The Kazi selects two men, one from the bride's party, who  is known as the Nikahi Bap or 'Marriage Father,' and the other from  the bridegroom's, who is called the Gowah or 'Witness.' These two  men go to the bride and ask her whether she accepts the bridegroom,  whose name is stated, for her husband. She answers in the affirmative,  and mentions the amount of the dowry which she is to receive. The  bridegroom, who has hitherto had a veil (_mukhna_) over his face, now  takes it off, and the men go to him and ask him whether he accepts the  bride. He replies that he does, and agrees to pay the dowry demanded  by her. The Kazi reads some texts and the guests are given a meal  of rice and sugar. Many of the preliminaries to a Hindu marriage  are performed by the more backward members of the caste, and until  recently they erected a sacred post in the marriage-shed, but now  they merely hang the green branch of a mango tree to the roof. The  minimum amount of the _mehar_ or dowry is said to be Rs. 125, but it  is paid to the girl's parents as a bride-price and not to herself,  as among the Muhammadans. A widow is expected, but not obliged, to  marry her deceased husband's younger brother. Divorce is permitted  by means of a written deed known as 'Farkhati.'        3. Religious and other customs.      The Bahnas venerate Muhammad, and also worship the tombs of Muhammadan"]]]
