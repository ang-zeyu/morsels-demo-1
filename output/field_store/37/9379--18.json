But to me, although  I saw the facts before me, the causes were as dark as ever.  All that I  could comprehend was, that the Circle had made himself smaller and  vanished, and that he had now reappeared and was rapidly making himself  larger.    When he regained his original size, he heaved a deep sigh; for he  perceived by my silence that I had altogether failed to comprehend him.  And indeed I was now inclining to the belief that he must be no Circle  at all, but some extremely clever juggler; or else that the old wives'  tales were true, and that after all there were such people as  Enchanters and Magicians.    After a long pause he muttered to himself, \"One resource alone remains,  if I am not to resort to action.  I must try the method of Analogy.\"  Then followed a still longer silence, after which he continued our  dialogue.    SPHERE.  Tell me, Mr. Mathematician; if a Point moves Northward, and  leaves a luminous wake, what name would you give to the wake?    I.  A straight Line.    SPHERE.  And a straight Line has how many extremities?    I.  Two.    SPHERE.  Now conceive the Northward straight Line moving parallel to  itself, East and West, so that every point in it leaves behind it the  wake of a straight Line.  What name will you give to the Figure thereby  formed?  We will suppose that it moves through a distance equal to the  original straight Line. --What name, I say?    I.  A Square.    SPHERE.  And how many sides has a Square?  How many angles?    I.  Four sides and four angles.    SPHERE.  Now stretch your imagination a little, and conceive a Square  in Flatland, moving parallel to itself upward.    I.  What?  Northward?    SPHERE.  No, not Northward; upward; out of Flatland altogether.    If it moved Northward, the Southern points in the Square would have to  move through the positions previously occupied by the Northern points.  But that is not my meaning.    I mean that every Point in you--for you are a Square and will serve the  purpose of my illustration--every Point in you, that is to say in what  you call your inside, is to pass upwards through Space in such a way  that no Point shall pass through the position previously occupied by  any other Point; but each Point shall describe a straight Line of its  own.  This is all in accordance with Analogy; surely it must be clear  to you.    Restraining my impatience--for I was now under a strong temptation to  rush blindly at my Visitor and to precipitate him into Space, or out of  Flatland, anywhere, so that I could get rid of him--I replied:--    \"And what may be the nature of the Figure which I am to shape out by  this motion which you are pleased to denote by the word 'upward'?  I  presume it is describable in the language of Flatland.\"    SPHERE.  Oh, certainly.  It is all plain and simple, and in strict  accordance with Analogy--only, by the way, you must not speak of the  result as being a Figure, but as a Solid.  But I will describe it to  you.  Or rather not I, but Analogy.    We began with a single Point, which of course--being itself a  Point--has only ONE terminal Point.    One Point produces a Line with TWO terminal Points.    One Line produces a Square with FOUR terminal Points.    Now you can give yourself the answer to your own question:  1, 2, 4,  are evidently in Geometrical Progression.  What is the next number?    I.  Eight.    SPHERE.  Exactly.  The one Square produces a SOMETHING-WHICH-  YOU-DO-NOT-AS-YET-KNOW-A-NAME-FOR-BUT-WHICH-WE-CALL-A-CUBE with EIGHT  terminal Points.  Now are you convinced?    I.  And has this Creature sides, as well as angles or what you call  \"terminal Points\"?    SPHERE.  Of course; and all according to Analogy.  But, by the way, not  what YOU call sides, but what WE call sides.  You would call them  SOLIDS.    I.  And how many solids or sides will appertain to this Being whom I am  to generate by the motion of my inside in an \"upward\" direction, and  whom you call a Cube?    SPHERE.  How can you ask?  And you a mathematician!  The side of  anything is always, if I may so say, one Dimension behind the thing.  Consequently, as there is no Dimension behind a Point, a Point has 0  sides; a Line, if I may say, has 2 sides (for the Points of a Line may  be called by courtesy, its sides); a Square has 4 sides; 0, 2, 4; what  Progression do you call that?    I.  Arithmetical.    SPHERE.  And what is the next number?    I.  Six.    SPHERE.  Exactly.  Then you see you have answered your own question.  The Cube which you will generate will be bounded by six sides, that is  to say, six of your insides.  You see it all now, eh?    \"Monster,\" I shrieked, \"be thou juggler, enchanter, dream, or devil, no  more will I endure thy mockeries.  Either thou or I must perish.\" And  saying these words I precipitated myself upon him.          Section 17.  How the Sphere, having in vain tried words,                 resorted to deeds        It was in vain.  I brought my hardest right angle into violent  collision with the Stranger, pressing on him with a force sufficient to  have destroyed any ordinary Circle:  but I could feel him slowly and  unarrestably slipping from my contact; no edging to the right nor to  the left, but moving somehow out of the world, and vanishing to  nothing.  Soon there was a blank.  But still I heard the Intruder's  voice.    SPHERE.  Why will you refuse to listen to reason?  I had hoped to find  in you--as being a man of sense and an accomplished mathematician--a  fit apostle for the Gospel of the Three Dimensions, which I am allowed  to preach once only in a thousand years:  but now I know not how to  convince you.  Stay, I have it.  Deeds, and not words, shall proclaim  the truth.  Listen, my friend.    I have told you I can see from my position in Space the inside of all  things that you consider closed.  For example, I see in yonder cupboard  near which you are standing, several of what you call boxes (but like  everything else in Flatland, they have no tops nor bottoms) full of  money; I see also two tablets of accounts.  I am about to descend into  that cupboard and to bring you one of those tablets.  I saw you lock  the cupboard half an hour ago, and I know you have the key in your  possession.  But I descend from Space; the doors, you see, remain  unmoved.  Now I am in the cupboard and am taking the tablet.  Now I  have it.  Now I ascend with it.    I rushed to the closet and dashed the door open.  One of the tablets  was gone.  With a mocking laugh, the Stranger appeared in the other  corner of the room, and at the same time the tablet appeared upon the  floor.  I took it up.  There could be no doubt--it was the missing  tablet.    I groaned with horror, doubting whether I was not out of my senses; but  the Stranger continued:  \"Surely you must now see that my explanation,  and no other, suits the phenomena.  What you call Solid things are  really superficial; what you call Space is really nothing but a great  Plane.  I am in Space, and look down upon the insides of the things of  which you only see the outsides.  You could leave this Plane yourself,  if you could but summon up the necessary volition.  A slight upward or  downward motion would enable you to see all that I can see.    \"The higher I mount, and the further I go from your Plane, the more I  can see, though of course I see it on a smaller scale.  For example, I  am ascending; now I can see your neighbour the Hexagon and his family  in their several apartments; now I see the inside of the Theatre, ten  doors off, from which the audience is only just departing; and on the  other side a Circle in his study, sitting at his books.  Now I shall  come back to you.  And, as a crowning proof, what do you say to my  giving you a touch, just the least touch, in your stomach?  It will not  seriously injure you, and the slight pain you may suffer cannot be  compared with the mental benefit you will receive.\"    Before I could utter a word of remonstrance, I felt a shooting pain in  my inside, and a demoniacal laugh seemed to issue from within me.  A  moment afterwards the sharp agony had ceased, leaving nothing but a  dull ache behind, and the Stranger began to reappear, saying, as he  gradually increased in size, \"There, I have not hurt you much, have I?  If you are not convinced now, I don't know what will convince you.  What say you?\"    My resolution was taken.  It seemed intolerable that I should endure  existence subject to the arbitrary visitations of a Magician who could  thus play tricks with one's very stomach.  If only I could in any way  manage to pin him against the wall till help came!    Once more I dashed my hardest angle against him, at the same time  alarming the whole household by my cries for aid.  I believe, at the  moment of my onset, the Stranger had sunk below our Plane, and really  found difficulty in rising.  In any case he remained motionless, while  I, hearing, as I thought, the sound of some help approaching, pressed  against him with redoubled vigour, and continued to shout for  assistance.    A convulsive shudder ran through the Sphere.  \"This must not be,\" I  thought I heard him say:  \"either he must listen to reason, or I must  have recourse to the last resource of civilization.\" Then, addressing  me in a louder tone, he hurriedly exclaimed, \"Listen:  no stranger must  witness what you have witnessed.  Send your Wife back at once, before  she enters the apartment.  The Gospel of Three Dimensions must not be  thus frustrated.  Not thus must the fruits of one thousand years of  waiting be thrown away.  I hear her coming.  Back! back!  Away from me,  or you must go with me--whither you know not--into the Land of Three  Dimensions!\"    \"Fool!  Madman!  Irregular!\" I exclaimed; \"never will I release thee;  thou shalt pay the penalty of"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/20102"],[0,"The International Monthly Magazine - Volume V - No II (#16)"],[1,"just then  recollected he had read that Alexander had a wart on the nape of his neck;  and with proper precautions Faustus allowed the emperor to examine the  apparition by this test. Alexander then vanished.    As Faustus was approaching the last year of his term, he seemed resolved  to pamper his appetite with every species of luxury. He carefully  accumulated all the materials of voluptuousness and magnificence. He was  particularly anxious in the selection of women who should serve for his  pleasures. He had one Englishwoman, one Hungarian, one French, two of  Germany, and two from different parts of Italy, all of them eminent for  the perfections which characterized their different countries.    At length he arrived at the end of the term for which he had contracted  with the devil. For two or three years before it expired his character  gradually altered. He became subject to fits of despondency, was no longer  susceptible of mirth and amusement, and reflected with bitter agony on the  close in which the whole must terminate. He assembled his friends together  at a grand entertainment, and when it was over, addressed them, telling  them that this was the last day of his life, reminding them of the wonders  with which he had frequently astonished them, and informing them of the  condition upon which he had held this power. They, one and all, expressed  the deepest sorrow at the intelligence. They had had the idea of something  unlawful in his proceedings; but their notions had been very far from  coming up to the truth. They regretted exceedingly that he had not been  unreserved in his communications at an earlier period. They would have had  recourse in his behalf, to the means of religion, and have applied to  pious men, desiring them to employ their power to intercede with Heaven in  his favor. Prayer and penitence might have done much for him; and the  mercy of Heaven was unbounded. They advised him to still call upon God,  and endeavor to secure an interest in the merits of the Saviour.    Faustus assured them that it was all in vain, and that his tragical fate  was inevitable. He led them to their sleeping apartment, and recommended  to them to pass the night as they could, but by no means, whatever they  might happen to hear, to come out of it; as their interference could in no  way be beneficial to him, and might be attended with the most serious  injury to themselves. They lay still, therefore, as he had enjoined them;  but not one of them could close his eyes. Between twelve and one in the  night they heard first a furious storm of wind round all sides of the  house, as if it would have torn away the walls from their foundations.  This no sooner somewhat abated, than a noise was heard of discordant and  violent hissing, as if the house was full of all sorts of venomous  reptiles, but which plainly proceeded from Faustus's chamber. Next they  heard the doctor's room-door vehemently burst open, and cries for help  uttered with dreadful agony, but in a half-suppressed voice, which  presently grew fainter and fainter. Then every thing became still, as if  the everlasting motion of the world was suspended.    When at length it became broad day, the students went in a body to the  doctor's apartment. But he was nowhere to be seen. Only the walls were  found smeared with his blood, and marks as if his brains had been dashed  out. His body was finally discovered at some distance from the house, his  limbs dismembered, and marks of great violence about the features of his  face. The students gathered up the mutilated parts of his body, and  afforded them private burial at the temple of Mars, in the village where  he died.            SOME SMALL POEMS.                   WRITTEN FOR THE INTERNATIONAL MONTHLY MAGAZINE.      BY R. H. STODDARD.    A PROLOGUE.      Without, the winds of Winter blow;    Without, the Winter sifts its snow:    Within, the hearths are warm and bright,    And all the chambers full of light,    And we again are gathered here,    To greet the advent of the year.      Pile on the wood, and stir the fires,    And in our souls the sweet desires;    And let us frame a mingled rhyme,    To suit the singers and the time;    With different stops, and keys of art,    In quaint old measures, got by heart.    BY THE SEA.      By the rolling waves I roam,      And look along the sea,    And dream of the day and the gleaming sail,      That bore my love from me.      His bark now sails the Indian seas,      Far down the summer zone:    But his thoughts, like swallows, fly to me      By the Northern waves alone.      Nor will he delay, when winds are fair,      To waft him back to me;    But haste, my love! or my grave will be made      By the sad and moaning sea!    WHEAT AND SHEAVES.      Before me now the village stands,      Its cottages embowered in bloom;    Behind me lies the burying ground,      Its sepulchres in cypress gloom.      The bells before me ring aloud,      A paean for the live and bold;    The bells behind are tolling low,      A requiem for the dead and cold.      The crowd before me tramp away,      And shout until the winds are stirred;    The crowd behind no longer move,      And never breathe a single word.      Before me many moan, and weep:      Behind, there is not one who grieves;    For blight but wastes the standing wheat.      It cannot touch the garnered sheaves!    FRAGMENT.      The gray old Earth goes on      At its ancient pace,    Lifting its thunder voice      In the choir of Space;        And the Years, as they go,        Are singing slow,    Solemn dirges, full of woe!      Tears are shed, and hearts are broken,    And many bitter words are spoken,      And many left unsaid;    And many are with the living,    That were better--better dead!      Tyrants sit upon their thrones,    And will not hear the people's moans,      Nor hear their clanking chains;    Or if they do, they add thereto,      And mock, not ease, their pains;      But little liberty remains--    There is but little room for thee,    In this wide world, O Liberty!    But where thou hast once set thy foot,      Thou wilt remain, though oft unseen;    And grow like thought, and move like wind,    Upon the troubled sea of Mind,      No longer now serene.    Thy life and strength thou dost retain,    Despite the cell, the rack, the pain,    And all the battles won--in vain!    And even now thou seest the hour    That lays in dust the tyrant's power,    When man shall once again be free,    And Earth renewed, and young like thee,      O Liberty! O Liberty!    CERTAIN MERRY STANZAS.      I often wish that I could know      The life in store for me,    The measure of the joy and woe      Of my futurity.    I do not fear to meet the worst      The gathering years can give;    My life has been a life accurst      From youth, and yet I live;    The Future may be overcast,    But never darker than the Past!      My mind will grow, as years depart    With all the winged hours;    And all my buried seeds of Art    Will bloom again in flowers;    But buried hopes no more will bloom,    As in the days of old;    My youth is lying in its tomb,    My heart is dead and cold!    And certain sad, but nameless cares    Have flecked my locks with silver hairs!      No bitter feeling clouds my grief,    No angry thoughts of thee;    For thou art now a faded leaf    Upon a fading tree.    From day to day I sea thee sink,    From deep to deep in shame;    I sigh, but dare not bid thee think    Upon thine ancient fame--    For oh! the thought of what thou art    Must be a hell within thy heart!      My life is full of care and pain--    My heart of old desires;    But living embers yet remain    Below its dying fires;    Nor do I fear what all the years    May have in store for me,    For I have washed away with tears    The blots of Memory:    But thou--despite the love on high--    What is there left thee but to die!            MR. JUSTICE STORY, WITH SOME REMINISCENT REFLECTIONS.(4)                       WRITTEN FOR THE INTERNATIONAL MAGAZINE.      BY A. OAKEY HALL.    The hurrying pedestrian in Wall-street, or in some of its bisecting  avenues of commercial bustle, if he have time to glance over his shoulder,  is sure to observe a freshly-painted piece of tin (its brief rhetoric  revelling in the pride and pomp of gold leaf alphabetically shaped),  denominated by lawyers \"a shingle\"--setting forth that some sanguine  gentleman has then and there established himself as an Attorney and  Counsellor at Law.    The sign is by the front door, shining with self-conceit at the passers  by; and its owner is up some weary stairway, yawning over \"twice told  tales\" of legal lore, copying precedents for the sake of practice, or  keeping hope alive upon the back benches of the court-rooms in listening  to the eloquence of his seniors while _he_ is waiting for clients.    Heaven help many a young attorney in this \"babel\" of money-getting. The  race should be prayed for in churches: and it should meet with a  consideration as nearly divine as mortals can call up from crowded  heart-chambers.    Well: the sign keeps nailed up: and by and by the sun blisters it, and  dries out the pomp of the gilded letters, and perhaps the owner yawns over  his one case, or sitting upon a front bench in the court-room while case  number thirty is being heard, waits for case nine hundred and thirty,  against which on the calendar that is reposing by the side of the  complaisant clerk in the corner, his name is placed as counsel--shining  there like a pebble on a wide and extended beach.    The Physiology of the Medical Student from facetious pens was reached to  us over the Atlantic by friendly booksellers some years ago; and we should  have had by this time \"the Physiology of the young Attorney.\" He is a good  subject for dissection; there's plenty of venous humor in his composition;  and oh! a deal of nerve!
