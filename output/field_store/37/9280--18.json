Is this a thing to say gaily? Is it not, on the contrary, a thing  to say sadly, as the saddest thing in the world?    If they thought of it seriously, they would see that this is so bad a  mistake, so contrary to good sense, so opposed to decency and so removed  in every respect from that good breeding which they seek, that they  would be more likely to correct than to pervert those who had an  inclination to follow them. And indeed, make them give an account of  their opinions, and of the reasons which they have for doubting  religion, and they will say to you things so feeble and so petty, that  they will persuade you of the contrary. The following is what a person  one day said to such a one very appositely: \"If you continue to talk in  this manner, you will really make me religious.\" And he was right, for  who would not have a horror of holding opinions in which he would have  such contemptible persons as companions!    Thus those who only feign these opinions would be very unhappy, if they  restrained their natural feelings in order to make themselves the most  conceited of men. If, at the bottom of their heart, they are troubled at  not having more light, let them not disguise the fact; this avowal will  not be shameful. The only shame is to have none. Nothing reveals more an  extreme weakness of mind than not to know the misery of a godless man.  Nothing is more indicative of a bad disposition of heart than not to  desire the truth of eternal promises. Nothing is more dastardly than to  act with bravado before God. Let them then leave these impieties to  those who are sufficiently ill-bred to be really capable of them. Let  them at least be honest men, if they cannot be Christians. Finally, let  them recognise that there are two kinds of people one can call  reasonable; those who serve God with all their heart because they know  Him, and those who seek Him with all their heart because they do not  know Him.    But as for those who live without knowing Him and without seeking Him,  they judge themselves so little worthy of their own care, that they are  not worthy of the care of others; and it needs all the charity of the  religion which they despise, not to despise them even to the point of  leaving them to their folly. But because this religion obliges us always  to regard them, so long as they are in this life, as capable of the  grace which can enlighten them, and to believe that they may, in a  little time, be more replenished with faith than we are, and that, on  the other hand, we may fall into the blindness wherein they are, we must  do for them what we would they should do for us if we were in their  place, and call upon them to have pity upon themselves, and to take at  least some steps in the endeavour to find light. Let them give to  reading this some of the hours which they otherwise employ so uselessly;  whatever aversion they may bring to the task, they will perhaps gain  something, and at least will not lose much. But as for those who bring  to the task perfect sincerity and a real desire to meet with truth,  those I hope will be satisfied and convinced of the proofs of a religion  so divine, which I have here collected, and in which I have followed  somewhat after this order ...      195    Before entering into the proofs of the Christian religion, I find it  necessary to point out the sinfulness of those men who live in  indifference to the search for truth in a matter which is so important  to them, and which touches them so nearly.    Of all their errors, this doubtless is the one which most convicts them  of foolishness and blindness, and in which it is easiest to confound  them by the first glimmerings of common sense, and by natural feelings.    For it is not to be doubted that the duration of this life is but a  moment; that the state of death is eternal, whatever may be its nature;  and that thus all our actions and thoughts must take such different  directions according to the state of that eternity, that it is  impossible to take one step with sense and judgment, unless we regulate  our course by the truth of that point which ought to be our ultimate  end.    There is nothing clearer than this; and thus, according to the  principles of reason, the conduct of men is wholly unreasonable, if they  do not take another course.    On this point, therefore, we condemn those who live without thought of  the ultimate end of life, who let themselves be guided by their own  inclinations and their own pleasures without reflection and without  concern, and, as if they could annihilate eternity by turning away their  thought from it, think only of making themselves happy for the moment.    Yet this eternity exists, and death, which must open into it, and  threatens them every hour, must in a little time infallibly put them  under the dreadful necessity of being either annihilated or unhappy for  ever, without knowing which of these eternities is for ever prepared for  them.    This is a doubt of terrible consequence. They are in peril of eternal  woe; and thereupon, as if the matter were not worth the trouble, they  neglect to inquire whether this is one of those opinions which people  receive with too credulous a facility, or one of those which, obscure in  themselves, have a very firm, though hidden, foundation. Thus they know  not whether there be truth or falsity in the matter, nor whether there  be strength or weakness in the proofs. They have them before their eyes;  they refuse to look at them; and in that ignorance they choose all that  is necessary to fall into this misfortune if it exists, to await death  to make trial of it, yet to be very content in this state, to make  profession of it, and indeed to boast of it. Can we think seriously on  the importance of this subject without being horrified at conduct so  extravagant?    This resting in ignorance is a monstrous thing, and they who pass their  life in it must be made to feel its extravagance and stupidity, by  having it shown to them, so that they may be confounded by the sight of  their folly. For this is how men reason, when they choose to live in  such ignorance of what they are, and without seeking enlightenment. \"I  know not,\" they say ...      196    Men lack heart; they would not make a friend of it.      197    To be insensible to the extent of despising interesting things, and to  become insensible to the point which interests us most.      198    The sensibility of man to trifles, and his insensibility to great  things, indicates a strange inversion.      199    Let us imagine a number of men in chains, and all condemned to death,  where some are killed each day in the sight of the others, and those who  remain see their own fate in that of their fellows, and wait their turn,  looking at each other sorrowfully and without hope. It is an image of  the condition of men.      200    A man in a dungeon, ignorant whether his sentence be pronounced, and  having only one hour to learn it, but this hour enough, if he know that  it is pronounced, to obtain its repeal, would act unnaturally in  spending that hour, not in ascertaining his sentence, but in playing  piquet. So it is against nature that man, etc. It is making heavy the  hand of God.    Thus not only the zeal of those who seek Him proves God, but also the  blindness of those who seek Him not.      201    All the objections of this one and that one only go against themselves,  and not against religion. All that infidels say ...      202    [From those who are in despair at being without faith, we see that God  does not enlighten them; but as to the rest, we see there is a God who  makes them blind.]      203    _Fascinatio nugacitatis._[87]--That passion may not harm us, let us act  as if we had only eight hours to live.      204    If we ought to devote eight hours of life, we ought to devote a hundred  years.      205    When I consider the short duration of my life, swallowed up in the  eternity before and after, the little space which I fill, and even can  see, engulfed in the infinite immensity of spaces of which I am  ignorant, and which know me not, I am frightened, and am astonished at  being here rather than there; for there is no reason why here rather  than there, why now rather than then. Who has put me here? By whose  order and direction have this place and time been allotted to me?  _Memoria hospitis unius diei praetereuntis._[88]      206    The eternal silence of these infinite spaces frightens me.      207    How many kingdoms know us not!      208    Why is my knowledge limited? Why my stature? Why my life to one hundred  years rather than to a thousand? What reason has nature had for giving  me such, and for choosing this number rather than another in the  infinity of those from which there is no more reason to choose one than  another, trying nothing else?      209    Art thou less a slave by being loved and favoured by thy master? Thou  art indeed well off, slave. Thy master favours thee; he will soon beat  thee.      210    The last act is tragic, however happy all the rest of the play is; at  the last a little earth is thrown upon our head, and that is the end for  ever.      211    We are fools to depend upon the society of our fellow-men. Wretched as  we are, powerless as we are, they will not aid us; we shall die alone.  We should therefore act as if we were alone, and in that case should we  build fine houses, etc.? We should seek the truth without hesitation;  and, if we refuse it, we show that we value the esteem of men more than  the search for truth.      212    _Instability._[89]--It is a horrible thing to feel all that we possess  slipping away.      213    Between us and heaven or hell there is only life, which is the frailest  thing in the world.      214    _Injustice._--That presumption"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/18273"],[0,"The Wild Tribes of Davao District, Mindanao (#16)"],[1,"even greater number of sacrifices. Prior to his elevation  to the office of _datu_ he had aided in several of the yearly offerings.  At the time he became _datu_ he entertained all his people for seven  days and on the morning of the last day, in the presence of his  subjects, he alone sacrificed a decrepit Bila-an slave for whom he had  paid three _agongs_. Hence, probably, no man in the tribe is better  fitted to describe this event than he.    According to him, a sacrifice should be held each year following the  appearance in the sky of a constellation of seven stars known as  _Balatik_ (\"pig trap\").[51] The stars are placed there by the spirits  for two purposes:--first, to inform the people that it is time to prepare  for the clearing of new fields; second, to remind them that they should  offer a slave to Mandarangan, Darago, and Balakat as payment for the  good year they have enjoyed, and to secure their good will for the  coming season. A great epidemic or continued calamaties[sic] might also  be signs that the spirits were in need of another offering, and this  could take place at any time. Upon the death of an adult it becomes the  duty of the family to make a sacrifice, but, unless the deceased is of  very great importance, they may wait until the yearly sacrifice[52] when  they can purchase a share in it. The one other occasion for which this  offering is obligatory is the installation of a new _datu_ in office.  For the yearly event the ruler should provide a decrepit slave, and then  invite all those who have had death or trouble in the family and who  wish a part in the sacrifice to help bear the expense of the ceremony.  Guests gather from near and far and for two or three days, feast, dance,  and make merry in the house of the _datu_. On the morning of the last  day they accompany their leader to a great tree in the forest and there  witness or take part in the sacrifice. The victim is tied with his back  to the tree, his arms stretched high above his head. Meanwhile a little  table or altar is constructed near by, and on it the principals place  their offerings of betel nut, clothes, or weapons, and on top of all is  a dish of white food for Eugpamolak Manobo. When all is ready one of the  _magani_ begins a prayer, begging the spirits to look and see that the  people are following the old custom, to give them success in battle, and  to protect their homes from sickness and enemies. The prayer being  completed, the _datu_ places his spear below and just in front of the  right armpit; then all those who have purchased a share in the victim  take hold of the weapon, and at a signal given by the _datu_, thrust it  through the body. As soon as it is withdrawn, the _magani_ who has  offered the greatest price for the privilege attempts to cut the body in  two with one blow of his fighting knife. If he fails in the attempt,  another tries, and so on until someone succeeds. The two portions are  then released from the tree and cast into a shallow grave near by.  Before the body is covered with earth any person who wishes may cut off  a portion of the flesh or hair and carry it to the grave of some  relative whom he may have reason to believe is being troubled by evil  spirits. In such a case the evil spirit will be content to eat of the  slave, and cease disturbing the other body. Returning to the house of  the _datu_, the people continue the dancing and merry-making throughout  another night.    [51] This is the constellation Orion which appears early in December.    [52] We have already seen that this offering sometimes occurs during the  _GinEm_ ceremony.    The following accounts are extracts from the official correspondence  forwarded by the Governor of Davao to the Governor of the Moro Province:    \"I have the honor to submit herewith a full report of an investigation  made by myself and the Senior Inspector of Constabulary of Davao,  regarding a human sacrifice made by the Bagobos at Talun near Digos on  Dec. 9th, 1907.    \"We left Davao on the morning of the 27th of December and arrived at  Digos in the afternoon of the same day. An order was immediately sent  out to the Bagobos of Talun to come down to Digos to meet us.    \"On the morning of the 30th, the entire population of Talun--men, women  and children, to the number of almost one hundred and fifty--arrived at  Digos. They were informed that it was reported that a human sacrifice  had been made at their town and that the authorities desired to know if  this was so.    \"Datto[sic] Ansig replied that it was true that a sacrifice had been  held as stated and that both he and his people were ready to tell all  about it as to the best of their belief they had committed no crime, but  only followed out a religious custom practiced by themselves and their  ancestors from time immemorial.    \"From the statements made by Ansig and his followers, it appears as  follows:    \"That the Bagobos have several gods, 'Bacalad,' God of the spirits,  Agpanmole[sic] Monobo[sic], God of good and his wife the goddess Dewata;  Mandarangan, the God of evil (corresponding perhaps to our devil) and to  whom sacrifice is made to appease his wrath which is shown by  misfortune, years of drought, or evil befalling the tribe or its  members, also it is at times necessary to offer him human sacrifice so  that he will allow the spirits of the deceased to rest, etc. They say  that in case a Bagobo of rank or influence dies, and his widow be unable  to secure another husband, it is necessary for her to offer sacrifice to  appease the spirit of her departed husband in order that she may secure  another. In order that these sacrifices be not made too often, it is  customary for the old men of the town to gather together once each year  during a time when a collection of seven stars, three at right angle to  the other four, are seen in the heavens at seven o'clock in the evening,  which is said to occur once each year during the first part of the month  of December.    \"This collection of stars is called by the Bagobos 'Balatic,' and is the  sign of the sacrifice, that is, if a sacrifice is to occur, it must take  place during the time that the stars are in this position.    \"The old men meet and decide if enough misfortune has overtaken the  tribe or village during the period since the last sacrifice to render  necessary another tribute to the god of evil. It is not necessary to  offer a sacrifice for each evil, but when the misfortunes amount to a  considerable, a sacrifice is held to cover the entire lot.    \"In this case it appears that two widows, Addy and Obby, went to  Datto[sic] Ansig and requested that he arrange a sacrifice to appease  the spirits of their departed husbands which were bothering them. Ansig  called a meeting of the old men at which were present besides himself  Bagobos Oling, Pandaya, and Ansig, and these four decided that as they  had not had a sacrifice since the great drought (about three years ago)  and that since that time many evils had befallen them, it would be well  to offer a sacrifice. These four men sent out to find a slave for  sacrifice, the finder becoming the chief of the sacrifice.    \"Ongon, a henchman of Datto Ansig, purchased from Bagobo Ido, a Bilan  slave boy named Sacum about eight years old and who was deaf and  cross-eyed, and had other defects of vision, making him of little or no  value as a laborer. Ido originally received this slave from Duon, a  Bilan, as a wedding present when he married Duon's daughter about a year  ago.    \"Ongon agreed to pay Ido five agongs for the boy and took him to the  house of Ansig where arrangements were made for the sacrifice by calling  on all who for any reason had need to appease the evil spirits to come  and take part. Three days after the slave was brought to the house of  Ansig, the people met at Talun near the river Inolia, a short distance  from Ansig's house, this being the regular place of sacrifice.    \"Leaving the house of Ansig the boy Sacum was seated upon the ground  near the place of sacrifice. He was naked but no other preparation was  made with regard to the person. Upon a platform or bench of bamboo about  two feet high and a foot or two square was placed a small basket or  receptacle made of the bark of the bunga tree; in this each person  present and taking part in the sacrifice placed a piece of betel-nut,  over this the men placed their head handkerchiefs and the women strips  of the bark of the palma tree. Upon this the men laid their bolos, and  spears were then stuck in the ground in a circle around the platform.  Next Datto Ansig as chief of the sacrifice made an oration which was  about as follows: 'Oh, Mandarangan, chief of evil spirits and all the  other spirits, come to our feast and accept our sacrifice. Let this  sacrifice appease your wrath and take from us our misfortunes, granting  us better times.'    \"After this, the boy Sacum was brought forward by Ongon, placed against  a small tree about six feet high, his hands tied above his head, and his  body tied to the tree with bejuco strips at the waist and knees. Ansig  then placed a spear at the child's right side at a point below the right  arm and above the margin of the ribs. This lance was grasped by the  widows Addy and Obby, who at a signal from Ansig forced it through the  child's body, it coming out at the other side. It was immediately  withdrawn and the body cut in two at the waist by bolos in the hands of  Moesta Barraro and Ola, after which the body was cut down and chopped  into bits by the people present, each of whom was allowed to take a  small portion as a momento[sic] of the occasion, the remainder of the  body being buried in a hole prepared for it.    \"It is said the child was deaf and almost blind and that it did not  realize what was to happen to it until the moment it was tied up when it  began to cry; further, that death was almost instantaneous, the only cry  being one uttered "]]]
