She was obliged to receive the united congratulations of the  school, to accept, with feigned surprise, the present which was offered  her, and to say a few appropriate words of appreciation and thanks. She  did not do it well, for her manner was always abrupt, and even verged on  the ungracious, the greatest contrast to the bland and tactful  utterances of Miss Bowes.    This year the annual ceremony was gone through as usual: Catherine, as  head girl, proffered the good wishes and the volume of Carlyle; Lucy  Morris, on behalf of the Nature Study Union, handed a bouquet of  polyanthus, rosemary, periwinkle, pansies, and pink daisies culled from  the garden, the earliness of which Miss Teddington remarked upon, as  though she had not watched their progress for the last week.    \"I'm very much obliged to you all,\" she said jerkily, looking  nevertheless as if she were longing to bolt for the door.    But she was not yet to make her escape. There was another time-honoured  ceremony to be observed. All eyes were turned to Miss Bowes, who rose as  usual to the occasion.    \"I think, girls,\" she said pleasantly, \"that, considering it is Miss  Teddington's birthday, we ought to take some special notice of the  occasion. Suppose we ask her to grant a holiday, so that we may make an  expedition in her honour. Who votes for this?\"    Forty-nine hands were instantly raised, and forty-nine voices cried \"I  do!\" Miss Teddington, who utterly disapproved of odd holidays during  term-time, submitted with what grace she could muster, and gave a rather  chilly assent, which was immediately drowned in a storm of clapping. The  girls, who always suspected the Principals of an annual argument on the  subject, felt they had scored for this year at any rate, and were  certainly one holiday to the good.    There was no question at all as to where they should walk. Every 21st  January, weather permitting, they turned their steps in the same  direction. On certain portions of the marsh, near the river, grew fields  of wild snowdrops, and to go snowdropping before February set in was as  much an institution as turning their money when they first heard the  cuckoo, or wishing at the sight of the earliest white butterfly. As a  matter of fact, though the delicate fiction of asking for the holiday  was preserved, it was such a _sine qua non_ that the cook was prepared  for it. She had baked jam tartlets and made potted meat the day before,  and was already cutting sandwiches and packing them in greaseproof  paper. Every girl at The Woodlands possessed a basket, just as she owned  a penknife or a French dictionary. It was equally indispensable. She  would carry out her lunch in it, and bring it back filled with flowers,  berries, or nature specimens, as the case might be. Each was labelled  with the owner's name, and hung in a big cupboard under the stairs. Some  of the girls also used walking-sticks with crooked handles, which were  found convenient weapons for hooking down brambles or branches of  catkins.    Shortly after ten o'clock the school started, every Woodlander bearing  her basket, containing sandwiches, two tartlets, an orange, and a small  enamelled drinking-mug. There were to be no camp-fires to-day, so cold  water from the stream would have to suffice, and would make tea all the  more welcome when they returned home. It was quite a fine morning, with  sudden gleams of sunshine that burst from the clouds and spread in  long, slanting, golden rays over the valley; just the kind of sky the  early masters of landscape painting loved to put in their pictures, with  a background of neutral tint and a bright, scraped-out light in the  foreground. The little solitary farms stood out white here and there  against the green of the fields, the pine-trees on the hill-sides showed  darkly in contrast to the bare larches. Cwm Dinas was inky purple  to-day, but Penllwyd was capped with snow. Miss Bowes, who was not a  good walker, had not ventured to join the expedition, but Miss  Teddington strode along at the head of the party, chatting to some of  the Sixth Form.    \"I'm sure she's wishing she were giving a Latin lesson instead,\" said  Lizzie Lonsdale. \"She looks rather grim.\"    \"Perhaps she's remembering she's a year older to-day,\" returned Beth  Broadway.    \"How old is she, do you think?\" giggled Addie Knighton.    \"That, my child, is a secret that will never be divulged. I dare say  you'd like to know?\"    \"I should, immensely.\"    \"Then you won't be gratified, unless you go to Somerset House and hunt  her name up in the register of births. Even then you'd find it  difficult, for you don't know her Christian name, only her initial.\"    \"Yes; she never will write more than 'M. Teddington' in anybody's  birthday-book. M might stand for Mary or Martha or Margaret or  Millicent or anything. Doesn't even Miss Bowes know?\"    \"If she does she won't tell. It's a state-secret.\"    \"Well, never mind; we call her Teddie, and that will do.\"    Many were the ingenious devices which the girls had adopted for trying  to find out both Miss Teddington's Christian name and her age. They  spoke of historic events that had happened before their parents had been  born, fondly hoping she might betray some memory of them and commit  herself. But she was not to be caught; she treated all events, however  recent or old, from a purely impersonal standpoint, and left them still  in the dark as to whether she was an infant in arms at the time or an  adult able to enjoy the newspapers. On the subject of names she was  indifferent, and would express no opinion on the relative merits of  Mary, Martha, Margaret, Millicent, Marion, Muriel, Mona, or Maud.    \"It's either plain Mary, or something so fearfully fancy she won't own  up to it,\" decided the girls.    In whatever decade Miss Teddington's birthday placed her, this year she  was certainly in the prime of life and energy as concerned the school.  Her keen eyes noticed everything, and woe betide the slacker who thought  to escape her, and dared bring an unprepared lesson to class. Her  sarcasms on such occasions made her victims writhe, though they were apt  to be witty enough to amuse the rest of the form. Though, like John  Gilpin's wife, she was on pleasure bent to-day, she never for a moment  forgot she was in charge, and kept turning to see that everybody was  following, and nobody straggling far off in the rear.    It was a three-mile walk from The Woodlands to the snowdrop  meadows--first along the high road, with an occasional short cut across  a field or through a spinney, then down a deep, narrow lane past a farm,  where the sight of a new-born lamb (the first of the season) caused  great excitement. Some of the girls, who loved old superstitions,  pretended to divine their luck by whether it was standing facing them or  otherwise when they first caught a glimpse of it; but, the general  verdict deciding that it was exactly sideways, they found it impossible  to give any accurate predictions for the future.    \"You'd better keep to something vague that can be construed two ways,  like the Delphic Oracle or _Old Moore's Almanac_,\" laughed Ulyth.    Once past the farm the walk began to grow specially interesting. The  deep lane, only intended for use in summer, when carts brought loads of  hay from the marsh, was turned by winter rains into the bed of a stream.  The girls picked their way at first along the bank, then by jumping from  stone to stone, but finally the water grew so deep it was impossible to  proceed farther without wading. They had been in the same emergency  before, so it did not daunt their enthusiasm. One and all they scaled  the high, wide, loosely built wall to their left. Here they could walk  as on a terrace, with the flooded lane on one side and on the other the  rushing Porth Powys stream, making its hurrying way to join the Craigwen  River. It was not at all an easy progress, for the wall was overgrown  with hazel bushes and a tangle of brambles, and its unmortared surface  had deep holes, into which the unwary might put a foot. For several  hundred yards they struggled on, decidedly to the detriment of their  clothing, and rather encumbered by their baskets; then at last they  reached the particular corner they were seeking, and scrambled down into  the meadow.    This field was such a favourite with the girls that they had come to  regard it almost as their own property. Miss Teddington had found it out  many years ago, and its discovery was always considered a point in her  roll of merit. It was an expanse of grassy land, bounded on one side by  the Porth Powys stream and on the other by a deep dyke, and leading down  over a rushy tract to the reed-grown banks of the river. The view over  the many miles of marshland, with the blue mountains rising up behind  and the silvery gleam of the river, was superb. The brown, quivering,  feathery reeds made a glorious foreground for the amber and vivid green  of the banks farther on; and the gorgeous sky effects of rolling clouds,  glinting sun, and patches of bluest heaven were like the beginning of  one of St. John's visions.    Near at hand, dotted all over the field, bloomed the wild snowdrops in  utmost profusion, with a looser habit of growth, a longer stalk, and a  wider flower than the garden variety. Lovely pure-white blossoms, with  their tiny green markings, they stood like fairy bells among the grass,  so dainty and perfect, it seemed almost a sacrilege to disturb them. The  girls, however, were not troubled with any such scruples, and set to  work to pick in hot haste.    \"I'm going down by the stream,\" said Ulyth; \"one gets far the best there  if one hunts about, and I brought my stick.\"    Rona, Addie and Lizzie joined her, and with considerable difficulty"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/20733"],[0,"Critical Miscellanies (Vol. 1 of 3), Essay 1: Robespierre (#16)"],[1,"sur-Aube, to seek repose and a little clearness of  sight in the night that wrapped him about. He was devoid of personal  ambition; he never had any humour for mere factious struggles. His,  again, was the temperament of violent force, and in such types the  reaction is always tremendous. The indomitable activity of the last  twenty months had bred weariness of spirit. The nemesis of a career of  strenuous Will in large natures is apt to be a sudden sense of the irony  of things. In Danton, as with Byron it happened afterwards, the  vehemence of the revolutionary spirit was touched by this desolating  irony. His friends tried to rouse him. It is not clear that he could  have done anything. The balance of force, after the suppression of the  Hebertists, was irretrievably against him, as calculation had already  revealed to Robespierre.    There are various stories of the pair having met at dinner almost on the  eve of Danton's arrest, and parting with sombre disquietude on both  sides. The interview, with its champagne, its interlocutors, its play of  sinister repartee, may possibly have taken place, but the alleged  details are plainly apocryphal. After all, 'Religion ist in der Thiere  Trieb,' says Wallenstein; 'the very savage drinks not with the victim,  into whose breast he means to plunge a sword.' Danton was warned that  Robespierre was plotting his arrest. 'If I thought he had the bare  idea,' said Danton with something of Gargantuan hyperbole, 'I would eat  his bowels out.' Such was the disdain with which the 'giant of the  mighty bone and bold emprise' thought of our meagre-hearted pedant. The  truth is that in the stormy and distracted times of politics, and  perhaps in all times, contempt is a dangerous luxury. A man may be a  very poor creature, and still have a faculty for mischief. And  Robespierre had this faculty in the case of Danton. With singular  baseness, he handed over to Saint Just a collection of notes, to serve  as material for the indictment which Saint Just was to present to the  Convention. They comprised everything that suspicion could interpret  malignantly, from the most conspicuous acts of Danton's public life,  down to the casual freedom of private discourse.    Another infamy was to follow. After the arrest, and on the proceedings  to obtain the assent of the Convention to the trial of Danton and others  of its members, one only of their friends had the courage to rise and  demand that they should be heard at the bar. Robespierre burst out in  cold rage; he asked whether they had undergone so many heroic  sacrifices, counting among them these acts of 'painful severity,' only  to fall under the yoke of a band of domineering intriguers; and he cried  out impatiently that they would brook no claim of privilege, and suffer  no rotten idol. The word was felicitously chosen, for the Convention  dreaded to have its independence suspected, and it dreaded this all the  more because at this time its independence did not really exist. The  vote against Danton was unanimous, and the fact that it was so is the  deepest stain on the fame of this assembly. On the afternoon of the  Sixteenth Germinal (April 5, 1794) Paris in amazement and some  stupefaction saw the once-dreaded Titan of the Mountain fast bound in  the tumbril, and faring towards the sharp-clanging knife. 'I leave it  all in a frightful welter,' Danton is reported to have said. 'Not a man  of them has an idea of government. Robespierre will follow me; he is  dragged down by me. Ah, better be a poor fisherman than meddle with the  governing of men!'           *       *       *       *       *    Let us pause for a moment over a calmer reminiscence. This was the very  day on which the virtuous and high-minded Condorcet quitted the friendly  roof that for nine months had concealed him from the search of  proscription. The same week he was found dead in his prison. While  Danton was storming with impotent thunder before the tribunal, Condorcet  was writing those closing words of his Sketch of Human Progress, which  are always so full of strength and edification. 'How this picture of the  human race freed from all its fetters,--withdrawn from the empire of  chance, as from that of the enemies of progress, and walking with firm  and assured step in the way of truth, of virtue, and happiness, presents  to the philosopher a sight that consoles him for the errors, the crimes,  the injustice, with which the earth is yet stained, and of which he is  not seldom the victim! It is in the contemplation of this picture that  he receives the reward of his efforts for the progress of reason, for  the defence of liberty. He ventures to link them with the eternal chain  of the destinies of man: it is there he finds the true recompense of  virtue, the pleasure of having done a lasting good; fate can no longer  undo it, by any disastrous compensation that shall restore prejudice and  bondage. This contemplation is for him a refuge, into which the  recollection of his persecutors can never follow him; in which, living  in thought with man reinstated in the rights and the dignity of his  nature, he forgets man tormented and corrupted by greed, by base fear,  by envy: it is here that he truly abides with his fellows, in an elysium  that his reason has known how to create for itself, and that his love  for humanity adorns with all purest delights.'           *       *       *       *       *    In following the turns of the drama which was to end in the tragedy of  Thermidor, we perceive that after the fall of the anarchists and the  death of Danton, the relations between Robespierre and the Committees  underwent a change. He, who had hitherto been on the side of government,  became in turn an agency of opposition. He did this in the interest of  ultimate stability, but the difference between the new position and the  old is that he now distinctly associated the idea of a stable republic  with the ascendency of his own religious conceptions. How far the  ascendency of his own personality was involved, we have no means of  judging. The vulgar accusation against him is that he now deliberately  aimed at a dictatorship, and began to plot with that end in view. It is  always the most difficult thing in the world to draw a line between mere  arrogant egoism on the one hand, and on the other the identification of  a man's personal elevation with the success of his public cause. The two  ends probably become mixed in his mind, and if the cause be a good one,  it is the height of pharisaical folly to quarrel with him, because he  desires that his authority and renown shall receive some of the lustre  of a far-shining triumph. What we complain of in Napoleon Bonaparte, for  instance, is not that he sought power, but that he sought it in the  interests of a coarse, brutal, and essentially unmeaning personal  ambition. And so of Robespierre. We need not discuss the charge that he  sought to make himself master. The important thing is that his mastery  could have served no great end for France; that it would have been like  himself, poor, barren, and hopelessly mediocre. And this would have been  seen on every side. France had important military tasks to perform  before her independence was assured. Robespierre hated war, and was  jealous of every victory. France was in urgent need of stable  government, of new laws, of ordered institutions. Robespierre never said  a word to indicate that he had a single positive idea in his head on any  of these great departments. And, more than this, he was incapable of  making use of men who were more happily endowed than himself. He had  never mastered that excellent observation of De Retz, that of all the  qualities of a good party chief, none is so indispensable as being able  to suppress on many occasions, and to hide on all, even legitimate  suspicions. He was corroded by suspicion, and this paralyses able  servants. Finally, Robespierre had no imperial quality of soul, but only  that very sorry imitation of it, a lively irritability.    The base of Robespierre's schemes of social reconstruction now came  clearly into view; and what a base! An official Supreme Being, and a  regulated Terror. The one was to fill up the spiritual void, and the  other to satisfy all the exigencies of temporal things. It is to the  credit of Robespierre's perspicacity that he should have recognised the  human craving for religion, but this credit is as naught when we  contemplate the jejune thing that passed for religion in his dim and  narrow understanding. Rousseau had brought a new soul into the  eighteenth century by the Savoyard Vicar's Profession of Faith, the most  fervid and exalted expression of emotional deism that religious  literature contains; vague, irrational, incoherent, cloudy; but the  clouds are suffused with glowing gold. When we turn from that to the  political version of it in Robespierre's discourse on the relations of  religious and moral ideas with republican principles, we feel as one who  revisits a landscape that had been made glorious to him by a summer sky  and fresh liquid winds from the gates of the evening sun, only to find  it dead under a gray heaven and harsh blasts from the northeast.  Robespierre's words on the Supreme Being are never a brimming stream of  deep feeling; they are a literary concoction: never the self-forgetting  expansion of the religious soul, but only the composite of the  rhetorician. He thought he had a passion for religion; what he took for  religion was little more than mental decorum. We do not mean that he was  insincere, or that he was without a feeling for high things. But here,  as in all else, his aspiration was far beyond his faculty; he yearned  for great spiritual emotions, as he had yearned for great thoughts and  great achievements, but his spiritual capacity was as scanty and obscure  as his intelligence. And where unkind Nature thus unequally yokes lofty  objects in a"]]]
