Paul  _well knew_ that lying--that \"faith\"--was necessary; later on the church  borrowed the fact from Paul.--The God that Paul invented for himself, a  God who \"reduced to absurdity\" \"the wisdom of this world\" (especially  the two great enemies of superstition, philology and medicine), is in  truth only an indication of Paul's resolute _determination_ to  accomplish that very thing himself: to give one's own will the name of  God, _thora_--that is essentially Jewish. Paul _wants_ to dispose of the  \"wisdom of this world\": his enemies are the _good_ philologians and  physicians of the Alexandrine school--on them he makes his war. As a  matter of fact no man can be a _philologian_ or a physician without  being also _Antichrist_. That is to say, as a philologian a man sees  _behind_ the \"holy books,\" and as a physician he sees _behind_ the  physiological degeneration of the typical Christian. The physician says  \"incurable\"; the philologian says \"fraud.\"...      48.    --Has any one ever clearly understood the celebrated story at the  beginning of the Bible--of God's mortal terror of _science_?... No one,  in fact, has understood it. This priest-book _par excellence_ opens, as  is fitting, with the great inner difficulty of the priest: _he_ faces  only one great danger; _ergo_, \"God\" faces only one great danger.--    The old God, wholly \"spirit,\" wholly the high-priest, wholly perfect, is  promenading his garden: he is bored and trying to kill time. Against  boredom even gods struggle in vain.[21] What does he do? He creates  man--man is entertaining.... But then he notices that man is also bored.  God's pity for the only form of distress that invades all paradises  knows no bounds: so he forthwith creates other animals. God's first  mistake: to man these other animals were not entertaining--he sought  dominion over them; he did not want to be an \"animal\" himself.--So God  created woman. In the act he brought boredom to an end--and also many  other things! Woman was the _second_ mistake of God.--\"Woman, at bottom,  is a serpent, Heva\"--every priest knows that; \"from woman comes every  evil in the world\"--every priest knows that, too. _Ergo_, she is also to  blame for _science_.... It was through woman that man learned to taste  of the tree of knowledge.--What happened? The old God was seized by  mortal terror. Man himself had been his _greatest_ blunder; he had  created a rival to himself; science makes men _godlike_--it is all up  with priests and gods when man becomes scientific!--_Moral_: science is  the forbidden _per se_; it alone is forbidden. Science is the _first_ of  sins, the germ of all sins, the _original_ sin. _This is all there is of  morality._--\"Thou shall _not_ know\":--the rest follows from that.--God's  mortal terror, however, did not hinder him from being shrewd. How is one  to _protect_ one's self against science? For a long while this was the  capital problem. Answer: Out of paradise with man! Happiness, leisure,  foster thought--and all thoughts are bad thoughts!--Man _must_ not  think.--And so the priest invents distress, death, the mortal dangers of  childbirth, all sorts of misery, old age, decrepitude, above all,  _sickness_--nothing but devices for making war on science! The troubles  of man don't _allow_ him to think.... Nevertheless--how terrible!--, the  edifice of knowledge begins to tower aloft, invading heaven, shadowing  the gods--what is to be done?--The old God invents _war_; he separates  the peoples; he makes men destroy one another (--the priests have always  had need of war....). War--among other things, a great disturber of  science!--Incredible! Knowledge, _deliverance from the priests_,  prospers in spite of war.--So the old God comes to his final resolution:  \"Man has become scientific--_there is no help for it: he must be  drowned!_\"...    [21] A paraphrase of Schiller's \"Against stupidity even gods struggle in  vain.\"      49.    --I have been understood. At the opening of the Bible there is the  _whole_ psychology of the priest.--The priest knows of only one great  danger: that is science--the sound comprehension of cause and effect.  But science flourishes, on the whole, only under favourable  conditions--a man must have time, he must have an _overflowing_  intellect, in order to \"know.\"... \"_Therefore_, man must be made  unhappy,\"--this has been, in all ages, the logic of the priest.--It is  easy to see just _what_, by this logic, was the first thing to come into  the world:--\"_sin_.\"... The concept of guilt and punishment, the whole  \"moral order of the world,\" was set up _against_ science--_against_ the  deliverance of man from priests.... Man must _not_ look outward; he must  look inward. He must _not_ look at things shrewdly and cautiously, to  learn about them; he must not look at all; he must _suffer_.... And he  must suffer so much that he is always in need of the priest.--Away with  physicians! _What is needed is a Saviour._--The concept of guilt and  punishment, including the doctrines of \"grace,\" of \"salvation,\" of  \"forgiveness\"--_lies_ through and through, and absolutely without  psychological reality--were devised to destroy man's _sense of  causality_: they are an attack upon the concept of cause and  effect!--And _not_ an attack with the fist, with the knife, with honesty  in hate and love! On the contrary, one inspired by the most cowardly,  the most crafty, the most ignoble of instincts! An attack of _priests_!  An attack of _parasites_! The vampirism of pale, subterranean  leeches!... When the natural consequences of an act are no longer  \"natural,\" but are regarded as produced by the ghostly creations of  superstition--by \"God,\" by \"spirits,\" by \"souls\"--and reckoned as merely  \"moral\" consequences, as rewards, as punishments, as hints, as lessons,  then the whole ground-work of knowledge is destroyed--_then the greatest  of crimes against humanity has been perpetrated_.--I repeat that sin,  man's self-desecration _par excellence_, was invented in order to make  science, culture, and every elevation and ennobling of man impossible;  the priest _rules_ through the invention of sin.--      50.    --In this place I can't permit myself to omit a psychology of \"belief,\"  of the \"believer,\" for the special benefit of \"believers.\" If there  remain any today who do not yet know how _indecent_ it is to be  \"believing\"--_or_ how much a sign of _decadence_, of a broken will to  live--then they will know it well enough tomorrow. My voice reaches even  the deaf.--It appears, unless I have been incorrectly informed, that  there prevails among Christians a sort of criterion of truth that is  called \"proof by power.\" \"Faith makes blessed: _therefore_ it is  true.\"--It might be objected right here that blessedness is not  demonstrated, it is merely _promised_: it hangs upon \"faith\" as a  condition--one _shall_ be blessed _because_ one believes.... But what of  the thing that the priest promises to the believer, the wholly  transcendental \"beyond\"--how is _that_ to be demonstrated?--The \"proof  by power,\" thus assumed, is actually no more at bottom than a belief  that the effects which faith promises will not fail to appear. In a  formula: \"I believe that faith makes for blessedness--_therefore_, it is  true.\"... But this is as far as we may go. This \"therefore\" would be  _absurdum_ itself as a criterion of truth.--But let us admit, for the  sake of politeness, that blessedness by faith may be demonstrated  (--_not_ merely hoped for, and _not_ merely promised by the suspicious  lips of a priest): even so, _could_ blessedness--in a technical term,  _pleasure_--ever be a proof of truth? So little is this true that it is  almost a proof against truth when sensations of pleasure influence the  answer to the question \"What is true?\" or, at all events, it is enough  to make that \"truth\" highly suspicious. The proof by \"pleasure\" is a  proof _of_ \"pleasure\"--nothing more; why in the world should it be  assumed that _true_ judgments give more pleasure than false ones, and  that, in conformity to some pre-established harmony, they necessarily  bring agreeable feelings in their train?--The experience of all  disciplined and profound minds teaches _the contrary_. Man has had to  fight for every atom of the truth, and has had to pay for it almost  everything that the heart, that human love, that human trust cling to.  Greatness of soul is needed for this business: the service of truth is  the hardest of all services.--What, then, is the meaning of _integrity_  in things intellectual? It means that a man must be severe with his own  heart, that he must scorn \"beautiful feelings,\" and that he makes every  Yea and Nay a matter of conscience!--Faith makes blessed: _therefore_,  it lies....      51.    The fact that faith, under certain circumstances, may work for  blessedness, but that this blessedness produced by an _idee fixe_ by no  means makes the idea itself true, and the fact that faith actually moves  no mountains, but instead _raises them up_ where there were none before:  all this is made sufficiently clear by a walk through a _lunatic  asylum_. _Not_, of course, to a priest: for his instincts prompt him to  the lie that sickness is not sickness and lunatic asylums not lunatic  asylums. Christianity finds sickness _necessary_, just as the Greek  spirit had need of a superabundance of health--the actual ulterior  purpose of the whole system of salvation of the church is to _make_  people ill. And the church itself--doesn't it set up a Catholic lunatic  asylum as the ultimate ideal?--The whole earth as a madhouse?--The sort  of religious man that the church _wants_ is a typical _decadent_; the  moment at which a religious crisis dominates a people is always marked  by epidemics of nervous disorder; the \"inner world\" of the religious man  is so much like the \"inner"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/19331"],[0,"Ceremonial of Hasjelti Dailjis and Mythical Sand Painting of the Navajo Indians (#16)"],[1,"  proved to be a large white shell, quite as large as a Tusayan basket. The  following day Etseastin discovered another kind of fruit in the spring  which the spider woman also brought him; this fruit was the turquoise. The  third day still another kind of fruit was discovered by him and obtained  by the spider woman; this was the abalone shell. The fourth day produced  the black stone bead, which was also procured.    After ascending into the upper world Etseastin visited the four corners to  see what he could find. (They had brought a bit of everything from the  lower world with them). From the east he brought eagle feathers; from the  south feathers from the bluejay; in the west he found hawk feathers, and  in the north speckled night bird (whippoorwill) feathers. Etseastin and  Etseasun carried these to a spring, placing them toward the cardinal  points. The eagle plumes were laid to the east and near by them white corn  and white shell; the blue feathers were laid to the south with blue corn  and turquoise; the hawk feathers were laid to the west with yellow corn  and abalone shell; and to the north were laid the whippoorwill feathers  with black beads and corn of all the several colors. The old man and woman  sang and prayed as they had done at the spring in the lower world. They  prayed to the east, and the white wolf was created; to the south, and the  otter appeared; to the west, and the mountain lion came; and to the north,  the beaver. Etseastin made these animals rulers over the several points  from which they came.    When the white of daylight met the yellow of sunset in mid-heavens they  embraced, and white gave birth to the coyote; yellow to the yellow fox.  Blue of the south and black of the north similarly met, giving birth, blue  to blue fox and north to badger.    Blue and yellow foxes were given to the Pueblos; coyote and badger remain  with the Navajo; but Great Wolf is ruler over them all. Great Wolf was the  chief who counseled separation of the sexes.              FOOTNOTES          1 In the decoration of the bodies several men assisted, but the        personators of the gods did much of the work on their own persons,        and they seemed quite fastidious. The fingers were dipped into the        paint and rubbed on the body.        2 Continency must be observed by the personators of the gods until all        paint is removed from their bodies.        3 The suds were crossed and encircled with the pollen to give them        additional power to restore the invalid to health.        4 I noticed that the priest of the sweat house on no occasion sat with        the song-priest and his attendants.        5 This food is dried and made into a powder, and used as a medicine by        the theurgist.        6 The old priest relating this myth now produced a pouch containing        corn pollen and a crystal, which he dipped in the pollen and said,        \"Now we must all eat of this pollen and place some on our heads, for        we are to talk about it.\"        7 The Naaskiddi are hunchbacks; they have clouds upon their backs, in        which seeds of all vegetation are held.        8 The Navajo will not use real blue coloring in their sand painting,        but adhere strictly to the instructions of the gods. They do,        however, use a bit of vermilion, when it can be obtained, to        heighten the red coloring in the pouches.        9 The _Bigelovia Douglasii_ is made into rings and used in the        ceremonial Hasjelti Dailjis with direct reference to this        occurrence.       10 Ceremonial rings are also made of the Spanish bayonet (yucca)."]]]
