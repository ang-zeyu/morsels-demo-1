The government, alarmed at the situation and the pessimistic  tone of Buller's messages, sent out Lord Roberts to supersede him in the  chief command, Sir Redvers being left in subordinate command of the Natal  force. His second attempt to relieve Ladysmith (January 10-27) proved  another failure, the result of the operations at Spion Kop (January 24)  causing consternation in England. A third attempt (Vaalkrantz, February  5-7) was unsuccessful, but the Natal army finally accomplished its task in  the series of actions which culminated in the victory of Pieter's Hill and  the relief of Ladysmith on the 27th of February. Sir Redvers Buller  remained in command of the Natal army till October 1900, when he returned  to England (being created G.C.M.G.), having in the meanwhile slowly done a  great deal of hard work in driving the Boers from the Biggarsberg (May 15),  forcing Lang's Nek (June 12), and occupying Lydenburg (September 6). But  though these latter operations had done much to re-establish his reputation  for dogged determination, and he had never lost the confidence of his own  men, his capacity for an important command in delicate and difficult  operations was now seriously questioned. The continuance, therefore, in  1901 of his appointment to the important Aldershot command met with a  vigorous press criticism, in which the detailed objections taken to his  conduct of the operations before Ladysmith (and particularly to a message  to Sir George White in which he seriously contemplated and provided for the  contingency of surrender) were given new prominence. On the 10th of October  1901, at a luncheon in London, Sir Redvers Buller made a speech in answer  to these criticisms in terms which were held to be a breach of discipline,  and he was placed on half-pay a few days later. For the remaining years of  his life he played an active part as a country gentleman, accepting in  dignified silence the prolonged attacks on his failures in South Africa;  among the public generally, and particularly in his own county, he never  lost his popularity. He died on the 2nd of June 1908. He had married in  1882 Lady Audrey, daughter of the 4th Marquess Townshend, who survived him  with one daughter.    A _Memoir_, by Lewis Butler, was published in 1909.    BULLET (Fr. _boulet_, diminutive of _boule_, ball). The original meaning (a  \"small ball\") has, since the end of the 16th century, been narrowed down to  the special case of the projectile used with small arms of all kinds,  irrespective of its size or shape. (For details see AMMUNITION; GUN; RIFLE,  &c.)    BULL-FIGHTING, the national Spanish sport. The Spanish name is  _tauromaquia_ (Gr. [Greek: tauros], bull, and [Greek: mache], combat).  Combats with bulls were common in ancient Thessaly as well as in the  amphitheatres of imperial Rome, but probably partook more of the nature of  worrying than fighting, like the bull-baiting formerly common in England.  The Moors of Africa also possessed a sport of this kind, and it is probable  that they introduced it into Andalusia when they conquered that province.  It is certain that they held bull-fights in the half-ruined Roman  amphitheatres of Merida, Cordova, Tarragona, Toledo and other places, and  that these constituted the favourite sport of the Moorish chieftains.  Although patriotic tradition names the great Cid himself as the original  Spanish bull-fighter, it is probable that the first Spaniard to kill a bull  in the arena was Don Rodrigo Diaz de Vivar, who about 1040, employing the  lance, which remained for centuries the chief weapon used in the sport,  proved himself superior to the flower of the Moorish knights. A spirited  rivalry in the art between the Christian and Moorish warriors resulted, in  which even the kings of Castile and other Spanish princes took an ardent  interest. After the Moors were driven from Spain by Ferdinand II.,  bull-fighting continued to be the favourite sport of the aristocracy, the  method of fighting being on horseback with the lance. At the time of the  accession of the house of Austria it had become an indispensable accessory  of every court function, and Charles V. ensured his popularity with the  people by killing a bull with his own lance on the birthday of his son,  Philip II. Philip IV. is also known to have taken a personal part in  bull-fights. During this period the lance was discarded in favour of the  short spear (_rejoncillo_), and the leg armour still worn by the  _picadores_ was introduced. The accession of the house of Bourbon witnessed  a radical transformation in the character of the bullfight, which the  aristocracy began gradually to neglect, admitting to the combats  professional subordinates who, by the end of the 17th century, had become  the only active participants in the bull-ring. The first great professional  _espada_ (_i.e._ swordsman, the chief bull-fighter, who actually kills the  bull) was Francisco Romero, of Ronda in Andalusia (about 1700), who  introduced the _estoque_, the sword still used to kill the bull, and the  _muleta_, the red flag carried by the _espada_ (see below), the spear  falling into complete disuse.    For the past two centuries the art of bull-fighting has developed gradually  into the spectacle of to-day. Imitations of the Spanish bull-fights have  been repeatedly introduced into France and Italy, but the cruelty of the  sport has prevented its taking firm root. In Portugal a kind of  bull-baiting is practised, in which neither man nor beast is much hurt, the  bulls having their horns truncated and padded and never being killed. In  Spain many vain attempts have been made to abolish the sport, by Ferdinand  II. himself, instigated by his wife Isabella, by Charles III., by Ferdinand  VI., and by Charles IV.; and several popes placed its devotees under the  ban of excommunication with no perceptible effect upon its popularity.  Before the introduction of railways there were comparatively few bull-rings  (_plazas de toros_) in Spain, but these have largely multiplied in recent  years, in both Spain and Spanish America. At the present day nearly every  larger town and city in Spain has its _plaza de toros_ (about 225  altogether), built in the form of the Roman circuses with an oval open  arena covered with sand, surrounded by a stout fence about 6 ft. high.  Between this and the seats of the spectators is a narrow passage-way, where  those bull-fighters who are not at the moment engaged take their stations.  The _plazas de toros_ are of all sizes, from that of Madrid, which holds  more than 12,000 spectators, down to those seating only two or three  thousand. Every bull-ring has its hospital for the wounded, and its chapel  where the _toreros_ (bull-fighters) receive the Holy Eucharist.    The bulls used for fighting are invariably of well-known lineage and are  reared in special establishments (_vacadas_), the most celebrated of which  is now that of the duke of Veragua in Andalusia. When quite young they are  branded with the emblems of their owners, and later are put to a test of  their courage, only those that show a fighting spirit being trained  further. When full grown, the health, colour, weight, character of horns,  and action in attack are all objects of the keenest observation and study.  The best bulls are worth from L40 to L60. About 1300 bulls are killed  annually in Spain. Bull-fighters proper, most of whom are Andalusians,  consist of _espadas_ (or _matadores_), _banderilleros_ and _picadores_, in  addition to whom there are numbers of assistants (_chulos_), drivers and  other servants. For each bull-fight two or three _espadas_ are engaged,  each providing his own quadrille (_cuadrilla_), composed of several  _banderilleros_ and _picadores_. Six bulls are usually killed during one  _corrida_ (bull-fight), the _espadas_ engaged taking them in turn. The  _espada_ must have passed through a trying novitiate in the art at the  royal school of bull-fighting, after which he is given his _alternativa_,  or licence.    The bull-fight begins with a grand entry of all the bull-fighters with  _alguaciles_, municipal officers in ancient costume, at the head, followed,  in three rows, by the _espadas, banderilleros, picadores, chulos_ and the  richly caparisoned triple mule-team used to drag from the arena the  carcasses of the slain bulls and horses. The greatest possible brilliance  of costume and accoutrements is aimed at, and the picture presented is one  of dazzling colour. The _espadas_ and _banderilleros_ wear short jackets  and small-clothes of satin richly embroidered in gold and silver, with  [v.04 p.0790] light silk stockings and heelless shoes; the _picadores_  (pikemen on horseback) usually wear yellow, and their legs are enclosed in  steel armour covered with leather as a protection against the horns of the  bull.    The fight is divided into three divisions (_suertes_). When the opening  procession has passed round the arena the president of the _corrida_,  usually some person of rank, throws down to one of the _alguaciles_ the key  to the _toril_, or bull-cells. As soon as the supernumeraries have left the  ring, and the _picadores_, mounted upon blindfolded horses in wretched  condition, have taken their places against the barrier, the door of the  _toril_ is opened, and the bull, which has been goaded into fury by the  affixing to his shoulder of an iron pin with streamers of the colours of  his breeder attached, enters the ring. Then begins the _suerte de picar_,  or division of lancing. The bull at once attacks the mounted _picadores_,  ripping up and wounding the horses, often to the point of complete  disembowelment. As the bull attacks the horse, the _picador_, who is armed  with a short-pointed, stout pike (_garrocha_), thrusts this into the bull's  back with all his force, with the usual result that the bull"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/19850"],[0,"The Human Side of Animals (#16)"],[1,"sound uttered  during their conversation, but that they used the language of look and  gesture, and while it was not understood by their masters, it was  entirely comprehended by themselves.    Another instance of canine language is given by John Burroughs, who says  that a certain tone in his dog's bark implies that he has found a snake.    There is an old maxim which says: \"The empty wagon makes the most  noise,\" and it is interesting to note that the loudest-mouthed and most  loquacious of all the animals are the lemurs, who are the least  intelligent members of their great family. They chatter, scream, squeak,  and grunt from morning till night, and two of them can make more noise  than a cageful of apes and monkeys. The orangs and chimpanzees, on the  other hand, exceptionally wise and gifted linguists, seldom utter a word  or cry, except under extraordinary circumstances, and then briefly.    Prof. Richard L. Garner, who has spent much time in studying the  language of animals, has attracted a great amount of attention through  his special study of the anthropoid apes. He has lived among these  animals in a steel cage in their native haunts and has used a phonograph  to record their language. Prof. Garner told recently of an exceptionally  intelligent ape, named Susie, whose home used to be at the Zoological  Park, under the care of the Zoological Society, and he claimed that  Susie could speak \"in her own language\" at least five words. They were  \"yes,\" \"no,\" \"protest,\" \"satisfaction\" and \"contempt.\"    Mr. George Gladden, writing in the _Outlook_ on the chimpanzee's voice,  did not exactly commit himself as to his belief regarding this matter,  but he says: \"Now, although Mr. Engeholm (for four years in charge of  the Primates House in the New York Zoological Park) has not been able to  discover that his apes use any language, correctly speaking, he is  confident that the chimpanzees Susie, Dick, and Baldy comprehend the  definite meaning of many words, and that their minds react promptly  when these words are addressed to them in the form of commands. This  capacity is more highly developed in Susie than in any other of the apes  in this particular group....    \"It is difficult, of course, to determine from the commands which an  animal will obey precisely how many words employed in these commands are  plainly understood; but I have endeavoured to do this tentatively in the  case of Mr. Engeholm's commands to Susie, all of which I have seen her  obey repeatedly and promptly.\"    Mr. Gladden enumerates about forty-three commands which he claims to  have seen Susie obey promptly. And he further states that the belief  which many students of animal psychology hold that an animal gets more  of the meaning of a command from the gesture which accompanies the  command than he does from the actual words by which he is commanded, is  false, and he adds, \"as to this, I can testify that of the forty-three  commands ... thirty-six may be, and generally are, unaccompanied by any  gesture whatever. How, then, does Susie comprehend those commands unless  through her understanding of the meaning of the words in which they are  conveyed?\"    The distinguished phrenologist Gall had a dog whose memory was  remarkable, and he thoroughly understood words and phrases. \"On this  subject I have made,\" says Gall, \"the following observations: I have  often spoken intentionally of things which might interest my dog,  avoiding the mention of his name, and not letting any gesture escape me  which would be likely to arouse his attention. He always exhibited  pleasure or pain suitable to the occasion, and by his conduct afterwards  showed that he understood perfectly well.\"    Col. W. Campbell in his _Indian Journal_ gives two remarkable instances  of language and unity of work among animals which he saw at Ranee  Bennore, while he was on a hunting trip. He witnessed, one morning, a  striking case of wolfish generalship, which in his belief proved that  animals are endowed to a certain extent not only with reason but are  able to communicate their ideas to others. He was scanning the horizon  one morning to see if any game was in sight when he discovered a small  herd of antelopes feeding in a nearby field. In another remote corner of  the field, hidden from the antelopes, he saw six wolves sitting with  their heads close together as though they were in deep conversation.    He knew at once that they were also seeking venison for breakfast and he  determined to watch them. He concealed himself behind a clump of  bushes, and the wolves who had evidently already decided upon their mode  of attack began their manoeuvres: one remained stationary, while the  other five crept to the edge of the field and one by one took the most  advantageous positions, the fifth concealing himself in a deep furrow in  the centre of the field.    The sixth, which had made no previous movements, dashed at the  antelopes. The swift, graceful creatures, trusting in their incomparable  speed, tossed their heads as if in disdain of so small an enemy and  galloped away as though they were riding on the winds with their enemy  far behind. But as soon as they reached the edge of the field, one of  the hiding wolves sprang up and chased them in an opposite direction,  while his fatigued accomplice lay down to recuperate. Again the  light-heeled herd darted across the field, evidently hoping to escape on  the opposite side, but here again they met another crafty wolf who  chased them directly toward another of the pack. The chase had begun in  earnest, the persecuted antelopes were driven from place to place, a  fresh enemy springing up at every turn, till at last they became so  terrorised with fear that they crowded together in the center of the  field and began running around in diminishing circles.    During all this performance, the wolf which was hidden in a furrow in  the centre of the field had not moved, although the antelopes had passed  around and over him dozens of times. He well realised his time for  action had not yet come and crouched closer and closer awaiting a signal  from his fellow hunters to spring into their midst, and down one of the  weakened antelopes.    At this point Col. Campbell shot one of the wolves, and the other five  ran away and allowed the antelopes to escape. Surely no human  combination could have shown greater reason and concerted action than  was shown by the wolves under such conditions. Each had a particular  post assigned, and evidently some means of communication was used in  indicating their respective locations. Each had a definite part to play  in the complex scheme--so that their language quite evidently expressed  abstract ideas. That these ideas were carried out shows that the wolves  were capable not only of laying ambitious plans for capturing prey, but  of carrying them out as well.    \"That beasts possess a language, which enables them to communicate their  ideas,\" says Thomas Gentry, \"has been clearly shown. It is just as  apparent that they can act upon the ideas so conveyed. We have now to  see whether they can convey their ideas to man, and so bridge over the  gulf between the higher and the lower beings. Were there no means of  communicating ideas between man and animals, domestication would be  impossible. Every one who has possessed and cared for some favourite  animal must have observed that they can do so. Their own language  becomes, in many instances, intelligible to man. Just as a child that is  unable to pronounce words, can express its meaning by intimation, so a  dog can do the same by its different modes of barking. There is the bark  of joy or welcome, when the animal sees its master, or anticipates a  walk with him; the furious bark of anger, if the dog suspects that any  one is likely to injure himself or master, and the bark of terror when  the dog is suddenly frightened at something which he cannot understand.  Supposing, now, that his master could not see the dog, but could only  hear his bark, would he not know perfectly well the ideas which were  passing through the animal's mind?\"    There is no doubt that animals understand something of our human  language. They may not be able to comprehend the exact words used, but  it is evident they get the meaning to a certain extent. I once had a  small Mexican dog sent me from Mexico; he seemed not to understand what  was said to him, until a friend called who spoke to him in Spanish,  whereupon he showed his delight and became at once a friend to the man  who spoke his own language.    The Rev. J. G. Wood tells the following incident, which forcibly  illustrates the ability possessed by animals to commune with each other.  \"While I was living in the country with a friend, a most interesting  incident was observed in the history of the dog. My friend had several  dogs, of which two had a special attachment to, and an understanding  with, each other. The one was a Scotch terrier, gentle and ready to  fraternise with all honest comers. The other was as large as a mastiff,  and looked like a compound between the mastiff and the large rough  stag-hound. He was fierce, and required some acquaintance before you  knew what faithfulness and kindness lay beneath his rough and  savage-looking exterior. The one was gay and lively, the other, stern  and thoughtful.    \"These two dogs were often observed to go to a certain point together,  when the small one remained behind at a corner of a large field, while  the mastiff took a round by the side of the field, which ran up-hill for  nearly a mile, and led to a wood on the left. Game abounded in those  districts and the object of the dogs' arrangement was soon seen. The  terrier would start a hare, and chase it up the hill towards the large  wood at the summit, where they arrived somewhat tired. At this point,  the large dog, who was fresh and had rested after his walk, darted after  the animal, which he "]]]
