Therefore, if it is agreed that number was found out from the human  fingers, and that there is a symmetrical correspondence between the  members separately and the entire form of the body, in accordance with a  certain part selected as standard, we can have nothing but respect for  those who, in constructing temples of the immortal gods, have so  arranged the members of the works that both the separate parts and the  whole design may harmonize in their proportions and symmetry.          CHAPTER II    CLASSIFICATION OF TEMPLES      1. There are certain elementary forms on which the general aspect of a  temple depends. First there is the temple in antis, or [Greek: naos en  parastasin] as it is called in Greek; then the prostyle, amphiprostyle,  peripteral, pseudodipteral, dipteral, and hypaethral. These different  forms may be described as follows.    2. It will be a temple in antis when it has antae carried out in front  of the walls which enclose the cella, and in the middle, between the  antae, two columns, and over them the pediment constructed in the  symmetrical proportions to be described later in this work. An example  will be found at the Three Fortunes, in that one of the three which is  nearest the Colline gate.    3. The prostyle is in all respects like the temple in antis, except that  at the corners, opposite the antae, it has two columns, and that it has  architraves not only in front, as in the case of the temple in antis,  but also one to the right and one to the left in the wings. An example  of this is the temple of Jove and Faunus in the Island of the Tiber.    4. The amphiprostyle is in all other respects like the prostyle, but has  besides, in the rear, the same arrangement of columns and pediment.    5. A temple will be peripteral that has six columns in front and six in  the rear, with eleven on each side including the corner columns. Let  the columns be so placed as to leave a space, the width of an  intercolumniation, all round between the walls and the rows of columns  on the outside, thus forming a walk round the cella of the temple, as  in the cases of the temple of Jupiter Stator by Hermodorus in the  Portico of Metellus, and the Marian temple of Honour and Valour  constructed by Mucius, which has no portico in the rear.    [Illustration: THE CLASSIFICATION OF TEMPLES ACCORDING TO THE  ARRANGEMENTS OF THE COLONNADES]    [Illustration: THE HYPAETHRAL TEMPLE OF VITRUVIUS COMPARED WITH THE  PARTHENON AND THE TEMPLE OF APOLLO NEAR MILETUS]    6. The pseudodipteral is so constructed that in front and in the rear  there are in each case eight columns, with fifteen on each side,  including the corner columns. The walls of the cella in front and in the  rear should be directly over against the four middle columns. Thus there  will be a space, the width of two intercolumniations plus the thickness  of the lower diameter of a column, all round between the walls and the  rows of columns on the outside. There is no example of this in Rome, but  at Magnesia there is the temple of Diana by Hermogenes, and that of  Apollo at Alabanda by Mnesthes.    7. The dipteral also is octastyle in both front and rear porticoes, but  it has two rows of columns all round the temple, like the temple of  Quirinus, which is Doric, and the temple of Diana at Ephesus, planned by  Chersiphron, which is Ionic.    8. The hypaethral is decastyle in both front and rear porticoes. In  everything else it is the same as the dipteral, but inside it has two  tiers of columns set out from the wall all round, like the colonnade of  a peristyle. The central part is open to the sky, without a roof.  Folding doors lead to it at each end, in the porticoes in front and in  the rear. There is no example of this sort in Rome, but in Athens there  is the octastyle in the precinct of the Olympian.          CHAPTER III    THE PROPORTIONS OF INTERCOLUMNIATIONS AND OF COLUMNS      1. There are five classes of temples, designated as follows: pycnostyle,  with the columns close together; systyle, with the intercolumniations a  little wider; diastyle, more open still; araeostyle, farther apart than  they ought to be; eustyle, with the intervals apportioned just right.    [Illustration: THE CLASSIFICATION OF TEMPLES ACCORDING TO  INTERCOLUMNIATION]    2. The pycnostyle is a temple in an intercolumniation of which the  thickness of a column and a half can be inserted: for example, the  temple of the Divine Caesar, that of Venus in Caesar's forum, and others  constructed like them. The systyle is a temple in which the thickness  of two columns can be placed in an intercolumniation, and in which the  plinths of the bases are equivalent to the distance between two plinths:  for example, the temple of Equestrian Fortune near the stone theatre,  and the others which are constructed on the same principles.    3. These two kinds have practical disadvantages. When the matrons mount  the steps for public prayer or thanksgiving, they cannot pass through  the intercolumniations with their arms about one another, but must form  single file; then again, the effect of the folding doors is thrust out  of sight by the crowding of the columns, and likewise the statues are  thrown into shadow; the narrow space interferes also with walks round  the temple.    4. The construction will be diastyle when we can insert the thickness of  three columns in an intercolumniation, as in the case of the temple of  Apollo and Diana. This arrangement involves the danger that the  architraves may break on account of the great width of the intervals.    5. In araeostyles we cannot employ stone or marble for the architraves,  but must have a series of wooden beams laid upon the columns. And  moreover, in appearance these temples are clumsy-roofed, low, broad, and  their pediments are adorned in the Tuscan fashion with statues of  terra-cotta or gilt bronze: for example, near the Circus Maximus, the  temple of Ceres and Pompey's temple of Hercules; also the temple on the  Capitol.    6. An account must now be given of the eustyle, which is the most  approved class, and is arranged on principles developed with a view to  convenience, beauty, and strength. The intervals should be made as wide  as the thickness of two columns and a quarter, but the middle  intercolumniations, one in front and the other in the rear, should be of  the thickness of three columns. Thus built, the effect of the design  will be beautiful, there will be no obstruction at the entrance, and the  walk round the cella will be dignified.    [Illustration: THE EUSTYLE TEMPLE OF VITRUVIUS COMPARED WITH THE TEMPLE  OF TEOS]    7. The rule of this arrangement may be set forth as follows. If a  tetrastyle is to be built, let the width of the front which shall have  already been determined for the temple, be divided into eleven parts and  a half, not including the substructures and the projections of the  bases; if it is to be of six columns, into eighteen parts. If an  octastyle is to be constructed, let the front be divided into  twenty-four parts and a half. Then, whether the temple is to be  tetrastyle, hexastyle, or octastyle, let one of these parts be taken,  and it will be the module. The thickness of the columns will be equal to  one module. Each of the intercolumniations, except those in the middle,  will measure two modules and a quarter. The middle intercolumniations in  front and in the rear will each measure three modules. The columns  themselves will be nine modules and a half in height. As a result of  this division, the intercolumniations and the heights of the columns  will be in due proportion.    8. We have no example of this in Rome, but at Teos in Asia Minor there  is one which is hexastyle, dedicated to Father Bacchus.    These rules for symmetry were established by Hermogenes, who was also  the first to devise the principle of the pseudodipteral octastyle. He  did so by dispensing with the inner rows of thirty-eight columns which  belonged to the symmetry of the dipteral temple, and in this way he made  a saving in expense and labour. He thus provided a much wider space for  the walk round the cella between it and the columns, and without  detracting at all from the general effect, or making one feel the loss  of what had been really superfluous, he preserved the dignity of the  whole work by his new treatment of it.    9. For the idea of the pteroma and the arrangement of the columns round  a temple were devised in order that the intercolumniations might give  the imposing effect of high relief; and also, in case a multitude of  people should be caught in a heavy shower and detained, that they might  have in the temple and round the cella a wide free space in which to  wait. These ideas are developed, as I have described, in the  pseudodipteral arrangement of a temple. It appears, therefore, that  Hermogenes produced results which exhibit much acute ingenuity, and  that he left sources from which those who came after him could derive  instructive principles.    [Illustration: VITRUVIUS' RULES FOR THE DIAMETER AND HEIGHT OF COLUMNS  IN THE DIFFERENT CLASSES OF TEMPLE COMPARED WITH ACTUAL EXAMPLES]    10. In araeostyle temples, the columns should be constructed so that  their thickness is one eighth part of their height. In the diastyle, the  height of a column should be measured off into eight and a half parts,  and the thickness of the column fixed at one of these parts. In the  systyle, let the height be divided into nine and a half parts, and one  of these given to the thickness of the column. In the pycnostyle, the  height should be divided into ten parts, and one of these used for the  thickness of the column. In the eustyle temple, let the height of a  column be divided, as in the systyle, into nine and a half parts, and  let one part be taken for the thickness at the bottom of the shaft. With  these dimensions we shall be taking into account the proportions of the"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/20248"],[0,"The Necessity of Atheism (#16)"],[1,"1) The belief in a personal God:    The Martian, as our guest, had by this time had ample opportunity to  survey our civilization, and to acquaint himself with the things with  which God in His goodness had endowed His earthly children. A proponent  of a personal God informs him that his deity is an infinite personal  being of consciousness, intelligence, will, good, unity, and Beauty; the  Supreme, the infinite personality, who was loving, benevolent,  omnipotent, and omniscient. Like the American from Missouri, the visitor  hastened to see for himself the marvelous workings of such an exalted  being, for surely such a being, with such attributes as he was credited  with, would certainly be in an excellent position to bestow great gifts  upon his earthly children.    The Martian is informed that the vast majority of our inhabitants, no  matter what their geographical distribution may be, are suffering from a  \"financial depression\" brought on by the last World War. War and cruelty  are synonymous in the mind of our seeker for God; and immediately, there  arises a conflict between the conception of an omnipotent, all-wise and  loving God and one who would permit war and cruelty. Fearing that he has  not comprehended the meaning of an omnipotent being, he turns to the  lexicon for verification, only to learn that it means an all-powerful  being. How, then, could an omnipotent being permit wholesale and  private murder? Is He not rather a demon than a God? On the other hand,  if this being is not omnipotent, then He is a useless god, and there is  no need for all the fears which religion breeds, no need for creed and  worship. Every war, particularly this last one, is an indictment of God.  \"God's in His Heaven, all's right with the world,\" is seemly only to  minds drugged with an irrational creed.    \"If there is a God, he is quite careless of human well-being or human  suffering. The deaths of a hundred thousand men mean no more to him than  the deaths of a hundred thousand ants. A couple of million men locked in  a death struggle on the battlefield is only a replica of the struggle  that has been going on in the animal world throughout time. If there be  a God, he made, he designed all this. He fashioned the hooks for the  slaughter, the teeth for the tearing, the talons for destruction, and  man with his multiplied weapons of destruction has but imitated his  example. A world without God, and in which humanity is gradually  learning the way to better things, is an inspiration to renewed effort  after the right. A world such as this, with God, is enough to drive  insane all with intelligence enough to appreciate the situation.\"  (_Chapman Cohen: \"War, Civilization and the Churches.\"_)    When the Martian investigated the annals of the World War he found,  despite the opportunities Providence had had of showing its benevolence,  the affair of the sinking of the _Lusitania_, the torpedoing of hospital  ships, vessels that were not engaged in fighting but in bringing home  wounded men who had fought in \"God's Cause.\" He found descriptions of  the slaughter of men and women and children in air raids, and he  naturally concludes that the \"providence of God\" is an insult to the  earthly intelligence.    Greatly disturbed, he picks up one of our newspapers and the stories of  hate and racial antagonism rear their ugly heads. These, together with  jealousy and fear, seem to him to be the outstanding features of our  attitudes. A benevolent, loving, omnipotent father, guiding our  destinies, yet allowing such monstrosities to exist! The conundrum grows  deeper as he proceeds.    It is a bright day, and the Martian is aware of a head-ache brought on  by the effort to understand the ways of earthlings, and therefore  decides to drive through the city streets. Yet this drive affords him no  relaxation, for on every side two diametrically opposed sights meet his  keen eyes--luxury and poverty. Poverty and starvation, yet the Lord's  Prayer: \"Our Father which art in Heaven, give us this day our daily  bread!\" No Martian father would allow his children to starve; if he did,  the law would fine him and imprison him. Since these earthlings are  neglected by their Heavenly Father, and are powerless to indict him, the  least they could do would be to stop paying tribute to him. If the God  of these earthlings bothers not about them, why should they trouble  about God? The Son of God who could once create a miraculous batch of  fish to satisfy a few fishermen, can do nothing to help these starving  millions! Aloud he muses, \"Is there no place on Earth which is free from  this contradiction?\"    His automobile happens to stop in front of an immense edifice marked  \"Hospital,\" and his curiosity is sufficiently aroused to cause him to  alight and enter. The physician in charge courteously asks his  distinguished visitor to inspect this refuge for those suffering with  pain. He remembers that a religionist had told him that disease is a  visitation of the Lord for our sins, in the same breath with which he  had added that the Lord was loving and compassionate. If that were so,  then this was the ideal place to witness the infinite goodness and  compassion of the Creator of all earthlings. But, the first scene to  meet his gaze was that of a woman in childbirth. The torture, the  excruciating pain, and the mental anguish of the human female before his  eyes, defied his Martian power of expression. This process of birth, it  was explained to him, was not a pathological one, nor a disease, but a  physiological function. To this, the Martian could not refrain from  replying, \"From your own words, Doctor, it is readily understood that  your women experience a torture more acute, more nerve-wracking, and of  longer duration than your Jesus experienced during his crucifixion. And  your world commiserates and sheds oceans of tears when they contemplate  the anguish of Jesus on the cross; but no mention is made of the agony  which is the fate of every woman who brings another human being into  this 'best of worlds.'\"    \"But, my dear Martian,\" exclaims the physician, \"the Heavenly Father has  ordained that in anguish shall woman bring forth her young.\" The other  deliberated on the compassion of the Benevolent Father in silence, and  continued on his rounds through the hospital.    Nearby was the crib containing a baby of a few days, suffering with a  congenital heart disease. The infant's lips were blue, so was the body  blue, and the gasping for breath and heaving of the small chest were  pitiful to behold.    \"This infant,\" nonchalantly remarked the physician, \"was born with a  greatly defective heart. It will live for a few days, it will thirst for  air, it will have intense air-hunger, the lungs will fill with fluid and  then it will drown in its own secretions.\"    The Martian recalled the time he had plunged under the water and  remained there too long; vividly, he remembered the thirst for air, the  seeming bursting of the lungs, the compression and vise-like grip of  the muscles of the throat and chest, and he could not help exclaiming,  \"Benevolent, Compassionate Being!\"    The physician continued, \"This child,\" pointing to a beautiful, robust  boy of ten years, \"was in perfect health, until he fell in the street  and received a minor cut which the parents treated with home remedies,  but which in a few days was diagnosed as Tetanus.\" And the doctor went  on to explain that the compassion of the Lord is great when this occurs,  for the child gets convulsions, the jaws become locked, and beads of  cold sweat stand out on the child's forehead in his anguish; the  convulsions increase in severity and in duration so that finally they  are continuous and the child lies with the heels and back of the head  only touching the bed, the rest of the body is arched. The convulsions  then become so severe that the body is so bent backwards at times that  the head and trunk touch the heels. The misery of such a child is  sufficient to cause a physician to lose his reason. Again the Martian  murmurs, \"Verily, the compassion of the Lord is beyond understanding.\"    The child in the next bed had just become paralyzed by an attack of  poliomyelitis (infantile paralysis). The Martian observes how the Lord  in His compassion saved a certain number of these children upon whom he  vents His anger for their sins, by inflicting upon them this hideous  disease. He saves their lives, but to serve as an everlasting reminder,  as a covenant between them and their Lord, He paralyzes their limbs. The  spectacle of these children attempting to move, making intense effort to  move paralyzed limbs, was the most revolting and heart-breaking sight  that he had ever witnessed. This time, too, the Martian remarked,  \"Verily, the Lord in His infinite wisdom and goodness strange tasks does  perform.\"    The physician then informed him of the many men and women who have died  of cancer. A large number of these individuals had reached a period in  life where they could just afford to relax from their struggles for mere  sustenance; men and women who had reached a calm lake after journeying  through troubled and tortuous waters; who had fought the \"good fight,\"  and had won the just reward of resting after their labors. But no, the  Lord must trouble them for their sins.    A group of these sufferers is shown to the Martian, and the normal  course of this disease is explained. This time all he can do is to  protest that he firmly asserts that not one of our savage chiefs, even  were he of the most primitive tribe, of the cruelest imagination, of the  most base and insane nature, would nor could conceive of such torture as  the Loving Father conceived when he decided upon cancer as a visitation  for our sins. The roasting of a witch alive is but a mere trifle  compared to the long-drawn-out agony, the slow wasting, the anguish of a  cancer patient watching himself sink to "]]]
