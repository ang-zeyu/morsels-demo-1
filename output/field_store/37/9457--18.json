For the general health and  condition of the mother does influence the child.    And still I feel impelled to say something which may meet with violent  opposition in some quarters. The trouble is, there are too many  half-baked scientists in our midst. They spread misleading information  and the public at large is too apt to take every statement that has a  quasi-scientific seal for something absolute, for something positive,  for something that admits of no exceptions.    I have seen so much misery caused by wrong prenatal care teaching and  by the foolish, exaggerated ideas on the subject, that I consider it  my duty to say something in order to counteract those erroneous  notions. I consider it my special mission to destroy error, mysticism  and superstition. And the prenatal care teaching as imparted by some  unfortunately partakes of all three of the above.    Of course, I repeat, the mother should try to be in the best possible  condition while she is carrying the child. Nevertheless, it is foolish  to imagine if the mother is not quite well, or is worried about  something, or has a fit of anger, that it is invariably going to be  reflected on the child. The child, as we know, has no nervous  connection whatever with the mother, and it is only very violent or  prolonged shocks that are apt to have an injurious influence.    I know of children that were carried by their mothers in anger and in  anguish from the day of conception to the day of delivery. And still  they were born perfectly normal. I know of a child whose mother was  suffering the most hellish tortures of jealousy during the entire  period of pregnancy, and still the child was born perfectly healthy,  perfectly normal, and is now a splendid specimen of manhood. I know  children whose mothers went through severe attacks of pneumonia,  typhoid fever, etc., and still they were born perfectly healthy and  perfectly normal. I know children whose mothers were using every means  to abort them, took all kinds of internal medicines until they were  deathly sick, and still they were born perfectly healthy and normal. I  know children whose mothers tried to abort them by mechanical means,  who went to abortionists who made one or more attempts to induce the  abortion--I know even cases where the mothers bled as a result of such  attempts--and nevertheless, the children were born perfectly healthy,  developed normally physically and mentally.    Of course these are not things that I would advise women to do or to  undergo. I would not advise pregnant women to worry, to be sick, to  take poisonous medicines or to make attempts at abortion, but I merely  bring up these points to emphasize to my readers not to take the  necessity of prenatal care in too absolute a sense, and not to worry  themselves unnecessarily if the conditions during their pregnancy are  not all that could be desired. The child is not necessarily going to  be affected. The condition of the germ-plasms, i.e., the condition of  the ovum and the spermatozoa at the time of conception is more  important than all subsequent care during gestation.    As there are foolish people who possess a peculiar knack of  misinterpreting and misunderstanding everything, I wish to emphasize  that hygiene during pregnancy should not be neglected. Everything  possible should be done to put the mother in the best possible  physical and mental condition. All I want to say is that it is bad to  be insane on the subject, that it is bad to take things in an absolute  sense, and that it is bad to exaggerate.    You will often hear it said that a child that was conceived when the  father was in an exhilarated condition is apt to be epileptic, or  nervous, or insane, and what not. This is also to be taken with a  grain of salt. A chronic alcoholic has a defective germ-plasm, and his  children are apt to be defective. But a glass of wine at a wedding  banquet cannot affect the previously formed spermatozoa. And the  statements about children being born defective or developing  defectively because their fathers took an occasional glass of wine are  unworthy of serious consideration; are unworthy of any consideration.    In connection with the above the reports of some cases of _violence_  and _accidents_ during pregnancy which, in spite of their severity,  did not affect the children, will prove of interest.    A delicate little woman missed her periods. She was sure she couldn't  be more than two weeks over-due. And this is what she did. For five  nights in succession she took hot mustard baths and she took them so  hot that each time she nearly fainted and came out from them like a  broiled lobster. No effect. She then took a box of pills which cost  her two dollars. No effect except causing diarrhea. She then took two  boxes of capsules which upset her stomach and made her fearfully  nauseous. No other effect. She then ate one-half a colocynth, which  made her terribly sick, causing a bloody diarrhea. She had to stay in  bed for three or four days. She then took burning vaginal injections  with some ipecac in them. No effect except making her feel raw so that  she needed large amounts of cold cream. She then took secale cornutum  and radix gossypii. No effect except giving her a headache, making her  sick to her stomach and completely destroying her appetite, so that  within a very short time she lost nearly ten pounds. She was then told  that long walks might be efficient. She took walks of six and seven  miles at a time, coming home more dead than alive. No effect. She then  heard that jumping off a table is a very efficient means. She did it  a dozen times in succession so that she was completely fagged out and  out of breath. Eight and a half months later she gave birth to a  perfectly healthy, well-formed boy weighing eight pounds.    The following case was reported by Brillaud-Laujardiere. A farmer who  was responsible for the condition of a servant of his household  conceived the idea of riding horseback with her in order to bring  about an abortion, and pushing her off when the horse was running at  great speed. This he repeated several times. The woman gave birth to a  perfectly normal infant at full term.    Hofmann reports that another farmer, under similar circumstances,  brutally kicked the woman in the abdomen repeatedly until she lost  consciousness. The pregnancy continued to full term notwithstanding.  In another case of Hofmann's, a woman allowed a heavy door to fall  upon her, but the pregnancy was not affected.    Dr. Guibout relates that a German woman, living with her husband in  California, being pregnant, wished to return to Munich, her home-town,  to be delivered. The train in which she travelled through Panama  collided with another train. Threatened abortion required her to take  a rest. She took a steamer and after a very rough passage reached  Portsmouth. From there she went to Paris. Here she fell down a flight  of stairs in the hotel where she was stopping. Again she was  threatened with abortion, but after a rest was in good condition and  continued her journey. She finally reached home, and was delivered at  full term of a normal infant.    Vibert reports the case of a woman who was in a train accident which  injured her severely, killed two of her children, but did not affect  her pregnancy. She was delivered at the proper time of a normal baby.          CHAPTER EIGHTEEN    THE MENOPAUSE OR CHANGE OF LIFE     Time of Menopause--Cause of Suffering During Menopause--    Reproductive Function and Sexual Function Not Synonymous--    Increased Libido During Menopause--Change of Life in Men.      In the chapter on menstruation I referred briefly to the menopause. I  will consider it here somewhat more in detail.    The menopause, also called the climacteric, and in common language  \"change of life,\" is the period at which woman ceases to menstruate.  The average age at which this occurs is about forty-eight. But while  some women continue to menstruate up to the age of fifty, fifty-two,  and even fifty-five, others cease to menstruate at the age of  forty-five or even forty-two. Between forty-four and fifty-two are the  normal limits. Anything before or beyond that is exceptional.    Just as the beginning of menstruation may set in without any trouble  of any kind, and just as some women have not the slightest unpleasant  symptoms during the entire period of their menstrual life, so the  menopause occurs in some women without any trouble, physical or  psychic. The periods between the menses become perhaps a little  longer, or a little irregular, the menstrual flow becomes more and  more scanty, then one or several periods may be skipped altogether,  and the menopause is permanently established. Many women, however, the  majority probably, suffer considerably during the transitional year or  years of the menopause. Symptoms are both of a physical and of a  psychic character, but the psychic symptoms predominate. There may be  headache, capricious appetite, or complete loss of appetite,  considerable loss of flesh, or on the contrary very sudden and rapid  putting on of fat, great irritability, insomnia, profuse perspiration;  hot flashes throughout the body, and particularly in the face, which  make the face \"blushing\" and congested, are particularly frequent.  Then the woman's character may be completely changed. From gentle and  submissive she may become pugnacious and quarrelsome. Jealousy without  any grounds for it may be one of the disagreeable symptoms, making  both the wife and the husband very unhappy. In some exceptional cases  a genuine neurosis or psychosis may develop.    =Cause of Suffering During Menopause.= It is my conviction, and I have  had this conviction for many years, that many, if not most, of the  distressing symptoms of the menopause are due, not to the menopause"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/21880"],[0,"The Medallic History of the United States of America 1776-1876 (#16)"],[1,"ON.
