[Drawing: _Favorite Way of Being Photographed_]    The lower Tana River country is admirably adapted to the life habits of  the rhinos. Formerly the district was well settled by natives, but now,  owing to the fever conditions prevailing there, the natives have all  moved away to more wholesome places and only the forlorn remains of  deserted villages mark where former prosperity reigned. The country has  been abandoned to game, with the result that it has been enormously  increasing during the last few years. In addition to the great numbers  of rhinos there are big herds of buffalo, enormous numbers of hippo in  the river, and many small droves of eland. Waterbuck, bushbuck,  steinbuck, impalla, hartebeest and zebra dwell in comparative immunity  from danger and may be seen in hundreds, grazing on the hills or in the  woods that fringe the river. It is a sportsman's paradise, if he manages  to escape the fever, and we enjoyed it tremendously, even though we shot  only a hundredth part of what we might easily have shot. The charm of  hunting in such a region lies in what one sees rather than in what one  kills.          CHAPTER VIII    MEETING COLONEL ROOSEVELT IN THE UTTERMOST OUTPOST OF SEMI-CIVILIZATION.  HE TALKS OF MANY THINGS, HEARS THAT HE HAS BEEN REPORTED DEAD, AND  PROMPTLY PLANS AN ELEPHANT HUNT      After one has been in British East Africa two months he begins to  readjust his preconceived ideas to fit real conditions. He discovers  that nothing is really as bad as he feared it would be, and that  distance, as usual, has magnified the terrors of a far-away land. In  spite of the fact that he is in the heart of a primitive country,  surrounded by native tribes that still are mystified by a glass mirror,  and perhaps many days' march from the nearest white person, he still may  feel that he is in touch with the great world outside. His mail reaches  him somehow or other, even if he is in the center of some vast unsettled  district devoid of roads or trails.    How it is done is a mystery; but the fact remains that every once in a  while a black man appears as by magic and hands one a package containing  letters and telegrams. He is a native \"runner,\" whose business it is to  find you wherever you may be, and he does it, no matter how long it may  take him. A telegram addressed to any sportsman in East Africa would  reach him if only addressed with his name and the words \"British East  Africa.\" There are only four or five thousand white residents in the  whole protectorate, and the names of these are duly catalogued and known  to the post-office officials both in Mombasa and Nairobi.    [Photograph: _In the Forest_]    If a strange name appears on a letter or despatch, inquiries are made  and the identity of the stranger is quickly established. If he is a  sportsman, the outfitters in Nairobi will know who he is. They will have  equipped him with porters and the other essentials of a caravan, and  they will know exactly in which section of the protectorate he is  hunting. So the letter is readdressed in care of the _boma_ or  government station, nearest to that section. The letter duly arrives at  the _boma_, and a native runner is told to go out and deliver the  message. He starts off, and by inquiry of other natives and by relying  on a natural instinct that is little short of marvelous he ultimately  finds the object of his search and delivers his message.    If you look at a map of British East Africa you will be amazed at the  number of names that are marked upon it. You would quite naturally think  that the country was rather thickly settled, whereas in fact there are  very few places of settlement away from the single line of railroad that  runs from Mombasa to Victoria Nyanza. The protectorate is divided into  subdistricts, each one of which has a capital, or _boma_, as it is  called. This _boma_ usually consists of a white man's residence, a  little post-office, one or two Indian stores where all the necessities  of a simple life may be procured, and a number of native grass huts.  There is usually a small detachment of askaris, or native soldiers, who  are necessary to enforce the law, repress any native uprising, and  collect the hut tax of one dollar a year that is imposed upon each  household in the district.    Other names on the map may look important, but will prove to be only  streams, or hills, or some landmarks that have been used by the  surveyors to signify certain places. In our five weeks' trip through  Trans-Tanaland we found only two _bomas_, Fort Hall and Embo, and three  or four ranches where one or more white men lived. In our expedition to  Mount Elgon we encountered only two places where the mark of  civilization showed--Eldoma Ravine and Sergoi. In the former place the  only white man was the subcommissioner, and in the latter there was one  policeman, and a general store kept by a South African. A number of Boer  settlers are scattered over the plateau, trying to reclaim little  sections of land from its primitive state.    Between Sergoi and Londiani, on the railroad, ninety miles south, there  is one little store where caravans may buy food for porters and some of  the simpler necessities that white men may require. All the rest of the  country for thousands of square miles is given up to the lion and zebra  and the vast herds of antelope that feed upon the rich grass of the  plateau.    Yet in spite of the sparsity of settlement the native runner manages to  find you, even after days of traveling, without compass or directions to  aid him.    [Photograph: By courtesy of W.D. Boyce. An Askari Who Looked Like a  Tragedian]    [Photograph: By courtesy of W.D. Boyce. Mr. Akeley]    Hunters who come to East Africa usually are sent to certain districts  where game is known to be abundant. These districts are well defined and  oftentimes there may be a number of _safaris_ in them at the same time,  but so large are the districts that one group of hunters very rarely  encroaches upon the others.    Some parties are sent to Mount Kilima-Njaro, in the vicinity of which  there is good hunting. Others are sent out from points along the  railroad for certain classes of game that may be found only in those  spots. Simba, on the railroad, is a favorite place for those who are  after the yellow-maned or \"plains\" lion. Muhorini, also on the railroad,  is a favorite place for those who want the roan antelope; Naivasha is a  good place for hippo, and south of Kijabe, in what is called the Sotik,  is a district where nearly all sorts of game abound. The Tana River is a  favorite place for rhino, buffalo, nearly all sorts of antelope, and  some lion; Mount Kenia is an elephant hunting ground, and the Aberdare  Range, between Kenia and Naivasha, also is good for elephant. North of  Kenia is the Guas Nyiro River, a rich district for game of many kinds.  And so the country is divided up into sections that are sure to attract  many sporting parties who desire certain kinds of game.    Our first expedition out from Nairobi was across the Athi Plains to the  Tana River and Mount Kenia, a wonderful trip for those who are willing  to take chances with the fever down the Tana River. In five weeks we saw  lion, rhino, buffalo, and elephant--the four groups of animals that are  called \"royal game\"; also hippo, giraffe, eland, wildebeest, and many  varieties of smaller game. It is doubtful whether there is any other  section of East Africa where one could have a chance for so many  different species of game in such a short time as the Tana River  country.    For our second expedition we selected the Guas Ngishu Plateau, the Nzoia  River, and Mount Elgon. It is a long trip which involves elaborate  preparation and some difficulty in keeping up supplies for the camp and  the porters. It is the most promising place, however, for black-maned  lion and elephant, and on account of these two capital prizes in the  lottery of big game hunting occasional parties are willing to venture  the time and expense necessary to reach this district.    We disembarked, or \"detrained,\" as they say down there, at a little  station on the railroad called Londiani, eight miles south of the  equator and about eighty miles from Victoria Nyanza. Then with two  transport wagons drawn by thirty oxen, our horses for \"galloping\" lions,  and one hundred porters, we marched north, always at an altitude of from  seventy-five hundred to ninety-two hundred feet, through vast forests  that stretched for miles on all sides. The country was beautiful beyond  words--clean, wholesome, and vast. In many places the scenery was as  trim, and apparently as finished as sections of the wooded hills and  meadows of Surrey. One might easily imagine oneself in a great private  estate where landscape gardeners had worked for years.    [Drawing: _One of the Transport Wagons_]    At night the cold was keen and four blankets were necessary the night we  camped two miles from the equator. In the day the sun was hot in the  midday hours, but never unpleasantly so. After two days of marching  through forests and across great grassy folds in the earth we reached  Eldoma Ravine, a subcommissioner's _boma_ that looks for all the world  like a mountain health resort. From the hill upon which the station is  situated one may look across the Great Rift Valley, two thousand feet  below, and stretching away for miles across, like a Grand Canon of  Arizona without any mountains in it. Strong stone walls protect the  white residence, for this is a section of the country that has suffered  much from native uprisings during the last few years. We called on the  solitary white resident one evening, and, true to the creed of the  Briton, he had dressed for dinner. The sight of a man in a dinner-coat  miles from a white man and leagues from a white woman was something"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/2126"],[0,"The Quest of the Sacred Slipper (#16)"],[1,"body violently in a wild  endeavour to free myself.  A dreadful pain shot through my left  shoulder, and the whole nightmare scene--the thing with the knife  at the window--the low-ceiled room-began to fade away from me.  I  seemed to be falling into deep water.    A splintering crash and the sound of shouting formed my last  recollections ere unconsciousness came.    I found myself lying in an armchair with Bristol forcing brandy  between my lips.  My left arm hung limply at my side and the pain  in my dislocated shoulder was excruciating.    \"Thank God you are all right, Mr. Cavanagh!\" said the inspector.  \"I got the surprise of my life when we smashed the door in and  found you tied up here!\"    \"You came none too soon,\" I said feebly.  \"God knows how Providence  directed you here.\"    \"Providence it was,\" replied Bristol.  \"From the roof of Wyatt's  Buildings--you know the spot?--I saw the second yellow devil  coming.  By God!  They meant to have it to-night!  They don't value  their lives a brass farthing against that damned slipper!\"    \"But how--\"    \"Along the telegraph-wires, Mr. Cavanagh!  They cross Wyatt's  Buildings and cross this house.  It was a moonless night or we  should have seen it at once!  I watched him, saw him drop to this  roof--and brought the men around to the front.\"    \"Did he, that awful thing, escape?\"    \"He dropped full forty feet into a tree--from the tree to the  ground, and went off like a cat!\"    \"Earl Dexter has escaped us,\" I said, \"and he has the slipper!\"    \"God help him!\" replied Bristol.  \"For by now he has that hell-pack  at his heels!  What a case!  Heavens above, it will drive me mad!\"          CHAPTER XIX    A RAPPING AT MIDNIGHT      Inspector Bristol finished his whisky at a gulp and stood up, a tall,  massive figure, stretching himself and yawning.    \"The detective of fiction would be hard at work on this case, now,\"  he said, smiling, \"but I don't even pretend to be.  I am at a  standstill and I don't care who knows it.\"    \"You have absolutely no clue to the whereabouts of Earl Dexter?\"    \"Not the slightest, Mr. Cavanagh.  You hear a lot about the machinery  of the law, but as a matter of fact, looking for a clever man hidden  in London is a good deal like looking for a needle in a haystack.  Then, he may have been bluffing when he told you he had the Prophet's  slipper.  He's already had his hand cut off through interfering with  the beastly thing, and I really can't believe he would take further  chances by keeping it in his possession.  Nevertheless, I should like  to find him.\"    He leaned back against the mantelpiece, scratching his head  perplexedly.  In this perplexity he had my sympathy.  No such  pursuit, I venture to say, had ever before been required of Scotland  Yard as this of the slipper of the Prophet.  An organization founded  in 1090, which has made a science of assassination, which through  the centuries has perfected the malign arts, which, lingering on in  a dark spot in Syria, has suddenly migrated and established itself  in London, is a proposition almost unthinkable.    It was hard to believe that even the daring American cracksman  should have ventured to touch that blood-stained relic of the  Prophet, that he should have snatched it away from beneath the very  eyes of the fanatics who fiercely guarded it.  What he hoped to  gain by his possession of the slipper was not evident, but the fact  remained that if he could be believed, he had it, and provided  Scotland Yard's information was accurate, he still lurked in hiding  somewhere in London.    Meanwhile, no clue offered to his hiding-place, and despite the  ceaseless vigilance of the men acting under Bristol's orders, no  trace could be found of Hassan of Aleppo nor of his fiendish  associates.    \"My theory is,\" said Bristol, lighting a cigarette, \"that even  Dexter's cleverness has failed to save him.  He's probably a dead  man by now, which accounts for our failing to find him; and Hassan  of Aleppo has recovered the slipper and returned to the East, taking  his gruesome company with him--God knows how!  But that accounts  for our failing to find him.\"    I stood up rather wearily.  Although poor Deeping had appointed me  legal guardian of the relic, and although I could render but a poor  account of my stewardship, let me confess that I was anxious to  take that comforting theory to my bosom.  I would have given much  to have known beyond any possibility of doubt that the accursed  slipper and its blood-lustful guardian were far away from England.  Had I known so much, life would again have had something to offer  me besides ceaseless fear, endless watchings.  I could have slept  again, perhaps; without awaking, clammy, peering into every shadow,  listening, nerves atwitch to each slightest sound disturbing the  night; without groping beneath the pillow for my revolver.    \"Then you think,\" I said, \"that the English phase of the slipper's  history is closed?  You think that Dexter, minus his right hand,  has eluded British law--that Hassan and Company have evaded  retribution?\"    \"I do!\" said Bristol grimly, \"and although that means the biggest  failure in my professional career, I am glad--damned glad!\"    Shortly afterward he took his departure; and I leaned from the  window, watching him pass along the court below and out under the  arch into Fleet Street.  He was a man whose opinions I valued, and  in all sincerity I prayed now that he might be right; that the  surcease of horror which we had recently experienced after the  ghastly tragedies which had clustered thick about the haunted  slipper, might mean what he surmised it to mean.    The heat to-night was very oppressive.  A sort of steaming mist  seemed to rise from the court, and no cooling breeze entered my  opened windows.  The clamour of the traffic in Fleet Street came  to me but remotely.  Big Ben began to strike midnight.  So far  as I could see, residents on the other stairs were all abed and  a velvet shadow carpet lay unbroken across three parts of the  court.  The sky was tropically perfect, cloudless, and jewelled  lavishly.  Indeed, we were in the midst of an Indian summer; it  seemed that the uncanny visitants had brought, together with an  atmosphere of black Eastern deviltry, something, too, of the  Eastern climate.    The last stroke of the Cathedral bell died away.  Other more  distant bells still were sounding dimly, but save for the  ceaseless hum of the traffic, no unusual sound now disturbed the  archaic peace of the court.    I returned to my table, for during the time that had passed I had  badly neglected my work and now must often labour far into the  night.  I was just reseated when there came a very soft rapping  at the outer door!    No doubt my mood was in part responsible, but I found myself  thinking of Poe's weird poem, \"The Raven\"; and like the character  therein I found myself hesitating.    I stole quietly into the passage.  It was in darkness.  How odd it  is that in moments of doubt instinctively one shuns the dark and  seeks the light.  I pressed the switch lighting the hall lamp, and  stood looking at the closed door.    Why should this late visitor have rapped in so uncanny a fashion  in preference to ringing the bell?    I stepped back to my table and slipped a revolver into my pocket.    The muffled rapping was repeated.  As I stood in the study doorway  I saw the flap of the letter-box slowly raised!    Instantly I extinguished both lights.  You may brand me as  childishly timid, but incidents were fresh in my memory which  justified all my fears.    A faintly luminous slit in the door showed me that the flap was now  fully raised.  It was the dim light on the stairway shining through.  Then quite silently the flap was lowered.  Came the soft rapping  again.    \"Who's there?\" I cried.    No one answered.    Wondering if I were unduly alarming myself, yet, I confess, strung  up tensely in anticipation that this was some device of the phantom  enemy, I stood in doubt.    The silence remained unbroken for thirty seconds or more.  Then yet  again it was disturbed by that ghostly, muffled rapping.    I advanced a step nearer to the door.    \"Who's there?\" I cried loudly.  \"What do you want?\"    The flap of the letter box began to move, and I formed a sudden  determination.  Making no sound in my heelless Turkish slippers  I crept close up to the door and dropped upon my knees.    Thereupon the flap became fully lifted, but from where I crouched  beneath it I was unable to see who or what was looking in; yet I  hesitated no longer.  I suddenly raised myself and thrust the  revolver barrel through the opening!    \"Who are you?\" I cried.  \"Answer or I fire!\"--and along the barrel  I peered out on to the landing.    Still no one answered.  But something impalpable--a powder--a  vapour--to this hour I do not know what--enveloped me with its  nauseating fumes; was puffed fully into my face!  My eyes, my  mouth, my nostrils became choked up, it seemed, with a deadly  stifling perfume.    Wildly, feeling that everything about me was slipping away, that I  was sinking into a void, for ought I knew that of dissolution, I  pulled the trigger once, twice, thrice...    \"My God!\"--the words choked in my throat and I reeled back into  the passage--\"it's not loaded!\"    I threw up my arms to save myself, lurched, and fell forward into  what seemed a bottomless pit.          CHAPTER XX    THE GOLDEN PAVILION      When I opened my eyes it was to a conviction that I dreamed.  I  lay upon a cushioned divan in a small apartment which I find myself  at a loss adequately to describe.    It was a yellow room, then, its four walls being hung with yellow  silk, its floor being entirely covered by a yellow Persian carpet.  One lamp, burning in a frame of some lemon coloured wood and having  its openings filled with green glass, flooded the place with a  ghastly illumination.  The lamp hung by gold"]]]
