When we know the elements out of which our bodies are composed,  elements in common to the humblest vegetable plants, can it signify  whether the All-Wise combined those elements out of one form more than  another, in order to create that in which He has placed the capacity to  receive the idea of Himself, and all the varied grandeurs of intellect  to which that idea gives birth? The An in reality commenced to exist  as An with the donation of that capacity, and, with that capacity, the  sense to acknowledge that, however through the countless ages his race  may improve in wisdom, it can never combine the elements at its command  into the form of a tadpole.\"    \"You speak well, Zee,\" said Aph-Lin; \"and it is enough for us shortlived  mortals to feel a reasonable assurance that whether the origin of the  An was a tadpole or not, he is no more likely to become a tadpole again  than the institutions of the Vril-ya are likely to relapse into the  heaving quagmire and certain strife-rot of a Koom-Posh.\"      Chapter XVII.      The Vril-ya, being excluded from all sight of the heavenly bodies, and  having no other difference between night and day than that which they  deem it convenient to make for themselves,--do not, of course, arrive at  their divisions of time by the same process that we do; but I found it  easy by the aid of my watch, which I luckily had about me, to compute  their time with great nicety. I reserve for a future work on the science  and literature of the Vril-ya, should I live to complete it, all details  as to the manner in which they arrive at their rotation of time; and  content myself here with saying, that in point of duration, their year  differs very slightly from ours, but that the divisions of their year  are by no means the same. Their day, (including what we call night)  consists of twenty hours of our time, instead of twenty-four, and of  course their year comprises the correspondent increase in the number of  days by which it is summed up. They subdivide the twenty hours of their  day thus--eight hours,* called the \"Silent Hours,\" for repose; eight  hours, called the \"Earnest Time,\" for the pursuits and occupations of  life; and four hours called the \"Easy Time\" (with which what I may term  their day closes), allotted to festivities, sport, recreation, or family  converse, according to their several tastes and inclinations.    * For the sake of convenience, I adopt the word hours, days, years,  &c., in any general reference to subdivisions of time among the Vril-ya;  those terms but loosely corresponding, however, with such subdivisions.    But, in truth, out of doors there is no night. They maintain, both  in the streets and in the surrounding country, to the limits of their  territory, the same degree of light at all hours. Only, within doors,  they lower it to a soft twilight during the Silent Hours. They have  a great horror of perfect darkness, and their lights are never wholly  extinguished. On occasions of festivity they continue the duration of  full light, but equally keep note of the distinction between night and  day, by mechanical contrivances which answer the purpose of our clocks  and watches. They are very fond of music; and it is by music that these  chronometers strike the principal division of time. At every one  of their hours, during their day, the sounds coming from all the  time-pieces in their public buildings, and caught up, as it were, by  those of houses or hamlets scattered amidst the landscapes without the  city, have an effect singularly sweet, and yet singularly solemn.  But during the Silent Hours these sounds are so subdued as to be only  faintly heard by a waking ear. They have no change of seasons, and, at  least on the territory of this tribe, the atmosphere seemed to me very  equable, warm as that of an Italian summer, and humid rather than dry;  in the forenoon usually very still, but at times invaded by strong  blasts from the rocks that made the borders of their domain. But time  is the same to them for sowing or reaping as in the Golden Isles of the  ancient poets. At the same moment you see the younger plants in blade or  bud, the older in ear or fruit. All fruit-bearing plants, however, after  fruitage, either shed or change the colour of their leaves. But that  which interested me most in reckoning up their divisions of time was the  ascertainment of the average duration of life amongst them. I found on  minute inquiry that this very considerably exceeded the term allotted to  us on the upper earth. What seventy years are to us, one hundred  years are to them. Nor is this the only advantage they have over us in  longevity, for as few among us attain to the age of seventy, so, on the  contrary, few among them die before the age of one hundred; and they  enjoy a general degree of health and vigour which makes life itself a  blessing even to the last. Various causes contribute to this result:  the absence of all alcoholic stimulants; temperance in food; more  especially, perhaps, a serenity of mind undisturbed by anxious  occupations and eager passions. They are not tormented by our avarice  or our ambition; they appear perfectly indifferent even to the desire of  fame; they are capable of great affection, but their love shows  itself in a tender and cheerful complaisance, and, while forming their  happiness, seems rarely, if ever, to constitute their woe. As the Gy is  sure only to marry where she herself fixes her choice, and as here, not  less than above ground, it is the female on whom the happiness of home  depends; so the Gy, having chosen the mate she prefers to all others, is  lenient to his faults, consults his humours, and does her best to secure  his attachment. The death of a beloved one is of course with them, as  with us, a cause for sorrow; but not only is death with them so much  more rare before that age in which it becomes a release, but when it  does occur the survivor takes much more consolation than, I am afraid,  the generality of us do, in the certainty of reunion in another and yet  happier life.    All these causes, then, concur to their healthful and enjoyable  longevity, though, no doubt, much also must be owing to hereditary  organisation. According to their records, however, in those earlier  stages of their society when they lived in communities resembling ours,  agitated by fierce competition, their lives were considerably shorter,  and their maladies more numerous and grave. They themselves say that  the duration of life, too, has increased, and is still on the increase,  since their discovery of the invigorating and medicinal properties of  vril, applied for remedial purposes. They have few professional and  regular practitioners of medicine, and these are chiefly Gy-ei, who,  especially if widowed and childless, find great delight in the healing  art, and even undertake surgical operations in those cases required by  accident, or, more rarely, by disease.    They have their diversions and entertainments, and, during the Easy  Time of their day, they are wont to assemble in great numbers for those  winged sports in the air which I have already described. They have also  public halls for music, and even theatres, at which are performed  pieces that appeared to me somewhat to resemble the plays of the  Chinese--dramas that are thrown back into distant times for their events  and personages, in which all classic unities are outrageously violated,  and the hero, in once scene a child, in the next is an old man, and so  forth. These plays are of very ancient composition, and their stories  cast in remote times. They appeared to me very dull, on the whole,  but were relieved by startling mechanical contrivances, and a kind of  farcical broad humour, and detached passages of great vigour and power  expressed in language highly poetical, but somewhat overcharged with  metaphor and trope. In fine, they seemed to me very much what the plays  of Shakespeare seemed to a Parisian in the time of Louis XV., or perhaps  to an Englishman in the reign of Charles II.    The audience, of which the Gy-ei constituted the chief portion, appeared  to enjoy greatly the representation of these dramas, which, for so  sedate and majestic a race of females, surprised me, till I observed  that all the performers were under the age of adolescence, and  conjectured truly that the mothers and sisters came to please their  children and brothers.    I have said that these dramas are of great antiquity. No new plays,  indeed no imaginative works sufficiently important to survive their  immediate day, appear to have been composed for several generations. In  fact, though there is no lack of new publications, and they have even  what may be called newspapers, these are chiefly devoted to mechanical  science, reports of new inventions, announcements respecting various  details of business--in short, to practical matters. Sometimes a child  writes a little tale of adventure, or a young Gy vents her amorous hopes  or fears in a poem; but these effusions are of very little merit,  and are seldom read except by children and maiden Gy-ei. The most  interesting works of a purely literary character are those of  explorations and travels into other regions of this nether world,  which are generally written by young emigrants, and are read with great  avidity by the relations and friends they have left behind.    I could not help expressing to Aph-Lin my surprise that a community in  which mechanical science had made so marvellous a progress, and in  which intellectual civilisation had"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/19511"],[0,"Bell's Cathedrals: Wimborne Minster and Christchurch Priory (#16)"],[1,"up to the vaulting, entirely separates the  latter from the Lady Chapel. In mediaeval times the choir was reserved  for the use of the canons; the nave was the parish church with its own  high altar; the rood loft was an excellent point of vantage from which  a preacher could address a large congregation. In those times pews had  not been introduced; open benches may have existed. At present the nave  is occupied by pews; these with their cast-iron poppies were erected in  1840, and were then higher than at present. Still, even in their present  form, they hide the bases of the pillars, and might with much advantage  be swept away, and their places taken by open benches or movable chairs.  The pews in the transepts are of older date; these, together with  the galleries above them--that in the south transept supporting the  organ--are a sad disfigurement to the church, and it is to be hoped that  they will be soon removed; they hide some splendid Norman work. The case  of the north gallery is worse than the south, as a staircase leading to  it disfigures the beautiful Early English chapel attached to the east  side of the transept. This gallery, however, contains some faculty pews.  All the owners of these, save one, consented to its removal; but one  stood out against it, and, having the legal right to prevent any  alteration, has up to the present time kept the gallery intact. But as  he has recently died there can be little doubt that no long time will  now elapse before this disfigurement to the church will be a thing of  the past. There seems little need for the gallery, as there is ample  accommodation on the floor of the church for any congregation that is  likely to assemble within the walls. Many alterations, some of which are  certainly improvements, have already been made. In an engraving, dated  1834, the organ is represented standing on the rood screen, probably the  best place for it; and the four eastern bays of the nave are seen to be  partitioned off by a wooden screen with a rod for curtains. On a level  with the capitals of the pillars, to the west of this partition, stands  the font. At this time also the triforium was boarded off in order to  shut out draughts and cold; but this boarding has happily been swept  away, the partition across the nave has been removed, and an oaken  screen with glazed panels runs across the church, cutting off the  western bay from the remainder of the nave. The font, a modern one,  now stands under the tower; a modern pulpit on the south side, under the  crossing, where also desks for the clergy and choir have been placed. It  is now the custom on Sunday mornings to read the whole of the service up  to the end of the Nicene Creed, in the nave; after the sermon is over,  the communicants alone enter the choir to receive the sacrament. The  choir is also used for week-day services. The Lady Chapel is not used.  The nave is Early Norman work, and was chiefly built during the reign  of William II.; the clerestory, however, was added at the beginning of  the thirteenth century by Peter, who was prior from 1195 to 1225. The  original nave was probably covered by a flat wooden ceiling, the Early  Norman builders rarely venturing to span any wide space by a stone  vaulting. The present vaulting is of stucco, and was added by Garbett  in 1819. The roof was altered in Perpendicular times more than once, as  indications of a higher pitched roof than the present one exists on the  east face of the fifteenth-century tower. As springing stones for a  vaulted roof exist, it is probable that a stone roof was at one time  contemplated; but possibly the idea was abandoned on account of the fear  that the walls, unsupported by any exterior flying buttress to resist  the thrust, would not have borne the weight. It will be remembered that  such buttresses are to be met with along the walls of the choir, which  is covered with a stone vaulting. The nave consists of seven bays. The  pillars of this arcading, unlike those of Flambard's nave at Durham,  are not cylindrical, but consist of half columns set against piers  rectangular in section. The capitals are of the early cushion shape;  some of them seem to have been subsequently carved with ornamentation  which bears some resemblance to classical forms. The wall spaces above  the semicircular arches, and below the chevron string-course which runs  beneath the triforium, are decorated with hatchet-work carving, as will  be seen from the illustrations. The triforium on either side consists,  in each bay, of two coupled arches supported by a central pillar,  enclosed by a comprising arch with bold mouldings and double columns,  separated by square members. The most beautiful bay is the easternmost,  on the north side, where the wall surface above the smaller arches,  and beneath the enclosing arch, is carved with a kind of scale-work.  Possibly the opposite bay, on the south side, was as richly ornamented,  but the lower arches and the central column no longer exist, as they  were cut away to make room for a faculty pew in 1820. These two bays  were included within the original Norman choir. The central shaft, on  the north side, is twisted. Two of the central shafts, on the south  side, are richly ornamented--one with twisted decoration, the other with  a projecting reticulated pattern. The shaft and sub-arches of the second  bay from the east on this side is a modern renewal, as here also the old  work was destroyed in 1820 to make room for a pew. The north triforium  can be reached by a staircase continued up into the tower, entered from  the western part of the aisle; access to the south triforium can only be  gained by the use of a ladder. The north triforium deserves examination.  It will be found that pointed arches have been added at the back, and  buttresses have been built against the back of the wall behind the  arches; the floor is rendered uneven by humps necessitated by the Early  English vaulting of the aisle below--probably the aisles were originally  covered with a barrel roof. At the east end of the north triforium an  arch may be seen, which once opened out into the transept; this is now  walled up, and traces of painting may still be seen on it. There is  a passage under the clerestory, to which access may be obtained by a  passage across the transept; this was, no doubt, made in order that  the shutters of the windows might be opened or closed, according to the  state of the weather. From the staircase which leads up to the north  triforium a passage leads into the chamber over the north porch. This is  a large room, about 40 feet in length from north to south, and is now  used as a practising room for the choir; it is fitted with benches and  a grand piano, and has a modern wooden gallery running along its south  end.    [Illustration: THE NAVE IN 1834.]    [Illustration: THE NAVE.]    [Illustration: NORTH ARCADE OF NAVE.]    [Illustration: FROM THE NORTH TRIFORIUM.]    [Illustration: BAY OF THE TRIFORIUM, SOUTH SIDE.]    The #South Aisle# is much more elaborately decorated than the north.  Along the south wall runs a fine Norman arcade, the arches ornamented  with billet and cable moulding. The window in the western bay is the  original Norman one; the others were altered either in Early English or  Decorated times, and are now filled with modern tracery in the Decorated  style designed by Mr Ferrey. In the third bay is a holy water stoop, and  in the fifth a large aumbry or recess, entered by a door; in this used  to be kept the bier and lights used at funerals. Along the walls of each  aisle runs a stone bench. There is no arcading on the wall of the north  aisle. The vaulting of both aisles is Early English, dating from the  time of Peter, the third prior, who, as previously stated, built the  clerestory. The tracery of the north aisle windows is transitional in  character between Early English and Decorated.    [Illustration: THE SOUTH AISLE OF NAVE.]    [Illustration: THE MONTACUTE CHANTRY.]    The #Transepts# are much encumbered by modern pews and galleries,  and it is only by careful examination that much of the beautiful work  that they contain can be seen. The arch opening from the south aisle  into the transept is Early English, and the skilful junction of Early  English and Norman work at this point is deserving of attention.  This transept was at one time covered by a stone vaulting, which was  destroyed at the latter end of the eighteenth century and in the  beginning of the nineteenth. Some of the bosses taken from this may be  seen, piled up with the old font and other fragments, at the west end of  the north choir aisle. The west wall of the transept contains a Norman  window. A doorway into the slype remains in the wall, and communicates  with a wall passage. At the eastern side of the transept an arch opens  out into an apsidal chapel, but pews block up the entrance. This chapel  has been so completely restored that it has a thoroughly neat and modern  appearance, and has lost all its archaeological value; round it runs a  Norman arcade, and on the north side an aumbry may be seen. The north  transept retains its Norman arcading, which, fortunately, has not been  touched by the restorer's hand; how long it may escape is doubtful,  as it is much mutilated. Still, as it is simply decorative, and not  necessary for the stability of the wall, it would be well to leave it  untouched, as genuine old work, even though it may have suffered at the  hand of time or of former generations, is, from a decorative point of  view, infinitely preferable to any modern reproduction. There are  two small windows in the west wall to light the wall passage to the  clerestory, which is reached by a gallery running across the base of  the north window. In the north wall, behind the back of the pews, is a  thirteenth-century recess. From this transept access is gained to the  circular staircase leading downward to"]]]
