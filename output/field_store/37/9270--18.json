And if you do not succeed in winning the prince's love, so that for your  sake he will forget father and mother, cleave to you with his whole  heart, let the priest join your hands and make you man and wife, you  will gain no immortal soul! The first morning after his marriage with  another your heart will break, and you will turn into foam of the sea.'    'I will do it,' said the little mermaid as pale as death.    'But you will have to pay me, too,' said the witch, 'and it is no trifle  that I demand. You have the most beautiful voice of any at the bottom of  the sea, and I daresay that you think you will fascinate him with it;  but you must give me that voice; I will have the best you possess in  return for my precious potion! I have to mingle my own blood with it so  as to make it as sharp as a two-edged sword.'    'But if you take my voice,' said the little mermaid, 'what have I left?'    'Your beautiful form,' said the witch, 'your gliding gait, and your  speaking eyes; with these you ought surely to be able to bewitch a human  heart. Well! have you lost courage? Put out your little tongue, and I  will cut it off in payment for the powerful draught.'    'Let it be done,' said the little mermaid, and the witch put on her  caldron to brew the magic potion. 'There is nothing like cleanliness,'  said she, as she scoured the pot with a bundle of snakes; then she  punctured her breast and let the black blood drop into the caldron, and  the steam took the most weird shapes, enough to frighten any one. Every  moment the witch threw new ingredients into the pot, and when it boiled  the bubbling was like the sound of crocodiles weeping. At last the  potion was ready and it looked like the clearest water.    'There it is,' said the witch, and thereupon she cut off the tongue of  the little mermaid, who was dumb now and could neither sing nor speak.    'If the polyps should seize you, when you go back through my wood,' said  the witch, 'just drop a single drop of this liquid on them, and their  arms and fingers will burst into a thousand pieces.' But the little  mermaid had no need to do this, for at the mere sight of the bright  liquid, which sparkled in her hand like a shining star, they drew back  in terror. So she soon got past the wood, the bog, and the eddying  whirlpools.    She saw her father's palace; the lights were all out in the great  ballroom, and no doubt all the household was asleep, but she did not  dare to go in now that she was dumb and about to leave her home for  ever. She felt as if her heart would break with grief. She stole into  the garden and plucked a flower from each of her sisters' plots, wafted  with her hand countless kisses towards the palace, and then rose up  through the dark blue water.    [Illustration: _But the little mermaid had no need to do this, for at  the mere sight of the bright liquid which sparkled in her hand like a  shining star, they drew back in terror._]    The sun had not risen when she came in sight of the prince's palace  and landed at the beautiful marble steps. The moon was shining bright  and clear. The little mermaid drank the burning, stinging draught, and  it was like a sharp, two-edged sword running through her tender frame;  she fainted away and lay as if she were dead. When the sun rose on the  sea she woke up and became conscious of a sharp pang, but just in front  of her stood the handsome young prince, fixing his coal black eyes on  her; she cast hers down and saw that her fish's tail was gone, and that  she had the prettiest little white legs any maiden could desire; but she  was quite naked, so she wrapped her long thick hair around her. The  prince asked who she was and how she came there. She looked at him  tenderly and with a sad expression in her dark blue eyes, but could not  speak. Then he took her by the hand and led her into the palace. Every  step she took was, as the witch had warned her beforehand, as if she  were treading on sharp knives and spikes, but she bore it gladly; led by  the prince, she moved as lightly as a bubble, and he and every one else  marvelled at her graceful gliding gait.    Clothed in the costliest silks and muslins she was the greatest beauty  in the palace, but she was dumb, and could neither sing nor speak.  Beautiful slaves clad in silks and gold came forward and sang to the  prince and his royal parents; one of them sang better than all the  others, and the prince clapped his hands and smiled at her; that made  the little mermaid very sad, for she knew that she used to sing far  better herself. She thought, 'Oh! if he only knew that for the sake of  being with him I had given up my voice for ever!' Now the slaves began  to dance, graceful undulating dances to enchanting music; thereupon the  little mermaid, lifting her beautiful white arms and raising herself on  tiptoe, glided on the floor with a grace which none of the other dancers  had yet attained. With every motion her grace and beauty became more  apparent, and her eyes appealed more deeply to the heart than the songs  of the slaves. Every one was delighted with it, especially the prince,  who called her his little foundling; and she danced on and on,  notwithstanding that every time her foot touched the ground it was like  treading on sharp knives. The prince said that she should always be near  him, and she was allowed to sleep outside his door on a velvet cushion.    He had a man's dress made for her, so that she could ride about with  him. They used to ride through scented woods, where the green branches  brushed her shoulders, and little birds sang among the fresh leaves. She  climbed up the highest mountains with the prince, and although her  delicate feet bled so that others saw it, she only laughed and followed  him until they saw the clouds sailing below them like a flock of birds,  taking flight to distant lands.    [Illustration: _The prince asked who she was and how she came there; she  looked at him tenderly and with a sad expression in her dark blue eyes,  but could not speak._]    At home in the prince's palace, when at night the others were  asleep, she used to go out on to the marble steps; it cooled her  burning feet to stand in the cold sea-water, and at such times she used  to think of those she had left in the deep.    One night her sisters came arm in arm; they sang so sorrowfully as they  swam on the water that she beckoned to them, and they recognised her,  and told her how she had grieved them all. After that they visited her  every night, and one night she saw, a long way out, her old grandmother  (who for many years had not been above the water), and the Merman King  with his crown on his head; they stretched out their hands towards her,  but did not venture so close to land as her sisters.    Day by day she became dearer to the prince; he loved her as one loves a  good sweet child, but it never entered his head to make her his queen;  yet unless she became his wife she would never win an everlasting soul,  but on his wedding morning would turn to sea-foam.    'Am I not dearer to you than any of them?' the little mermaid's eyes  seemed to say when he took her in his arms and kissed her beautiful  brow.    'Yes, you are the dearest one to me,' said the prince, 'for you have the  best heart of them all, and you are fondest of me; you are also like a  young girl I once saw, but whom I never expect to see again. I was on  board a ship which was wrecked; I was driven on shore by the waves close  to a holy Temple where several young girls were ministering at a  service; the youngest of them found me on the beach and saved my life; I  saw her but twice. She was the only person I could love in this world,  but you are like her, you almost drive her image out of my heart. She  belongs to the holy Temple, and therefore by good fortune you have been  sent to me; we will never part!'    'Alas! he does not know that it was I who saved his life,' thought the  little mermaid. 'I bore him over the sea to the wood where the Temple  stands. I sat behind the foam and watched to see if any one would come.  I saw the pretty girl he loves better than me.' And the mermaid heaved a  bitter sigh, for she could not weep.    'The girl belongs to the holy Temple, he has said; she will never return  to the world, they will never meet again. I am here with him; I see him  every day. Yes! I will tend him, love him, and give up my life to him.'    But now the rumour ran that the prince was to be married to the  beautiful daughter of a neighbouring king, and for that reason was  fitting out a splendid ship. It was given out that the prince was going  on a voyage to see the adjoining countries, but it was without doubt to  see the king's daughter; he was to have a great suite with him. But the  little mermaid shook her head and laughed; she knew the prince's  intentions much better than any of the others. 'I must take this  voyage,' he had said to her; 'I must go and see the beautiful princess;  my parents demand that, but they will never force me to bring her home  as my bride; I can never love her! She will not be like the lovely girl  in the Temple whom you resemble. If ever I had to choose a bride it  would sooner be you with your speaking eyes, my sweet, dumb foundling!'  And he kissed her rosy mouth, played with her long hair, and laid his  head upon her heart, which already dreamt of human joys and an immortal  soul.    'You are not frightened of the sea, I suppose, my dumb child?' he said,  as they stood on the proud ship which was to carry them to the country  of the neighbouring king; and he told her about storms and calms, about  curious fish in the deep, and the marvels seen by divers; and she smiled  at his tales, for she knew all about the bottom of the sea much better  than any one"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/17866"],[0,"Murder in the Gunroom (#16)"],[1,"cars in the garage. The Packard sedan had not been moved,  but the station-wagon was facing in the opposite direction. The gray  Plymouth was in the space from which Rand had driven earlier in the  evening, and a black Chrysler Imperial had been run in on the left of the  Plymouth. He put his own car in on the right of the station-wagon, made  sure that the Leech & Rigdon was locked in his glove-box, and closed and  locked the garage doors. Then he went up into the house, through the  library, and by the spiral stairway to the gunroom.    The garage had been open, he recalled, at the time of Lane Fleming's  death. The availability of such an easy means of undetected ingress and  egress threw the suspect field wide open. Anybody who knew the habits of  the Fleming household could have slipped up to the gunroom, while Varcek  was in his lab, Dunmore was in the bathroom, and Gladys and Geraldine  were in the parlor. As he crossed the hall to his own room, Rand was  thinking of how narrowly Arnold Rivers had escaped a disastrous lawsuit  and criminal action by the death of Lane Fleming.          CHAPTER 10      When Rand came down to breakfast the next morning, he found Gladys,  Nelda, and a man whom he decided, by elimination, must be Anton Varcek,  already at the table. The latter rose as Rand entered, and bowed jerkily  as Gladys verified the guess with an introduction.    He was about Rand's own age and height; he had a smooth-shaven,  tight-mouthed face, adorned with bushy eyebrows, each of which was almost  as heavy as Rand's mustache. It was a face that seemed tantalizingly  familiar, and Rand puzzled for a moment, then nodded mentally. Of course  he had seen a face like that hundreds of times, in newsreels and  news-photos, and, once in pre-war Berlin, its living double. Rudolf Hess.  He wondered how much deeper the resemblance went, and tried not to let it  prejudice him.    Nelda greeted him with a trowelful of sweetness and a dash of  bedroom-bait. Gladys waved him to a vacant seat at her right and summoned  the maid who had been serving breakfast. After Rand had indicated his  preference of fruit and found out what else there was to eat, he inquired  where the others were.    \"Oh, Fred's still dressing; he'll be down in a minute,\" Nelda told him.  \"And Geraldine won't; she never eats with her breakfast.\"    Varcek winced slightly at this, and shifted the subject by inquiring if  Rand were a professional antiques-expert.    \"No, I'm a lily-pure amateur,\" Rand told him. \"Or was until I took this  job. I have a collection of my own, and I'm supposed to be something of  an authority. My business is operating a private detective agency.\"    \"But you are here only as an arms-expert?\" Varcek inquired. \"You are not  making any sort of detective investigation?\"    \"That's right,\" Rand assured him. \"This is practically a paid vacation,  for me. First time I ever handled anything like this; it's a real  pleasure to be working at something I really enjoy, for a change.\"    Varcek nodded. \"Yes, I can understand that. My own work, for instance. I  would continue with my research even if I were independently wealthy and  any sort of work were unnecessary.\"    \"Tell Colonel Rand what you're working on now,\" Nelda urged.    Varcek gave a small mirthless laugh. \"Oh, Colonel Rand would be no more  interested than I would be in his pistols,\" he objected, then turned to  Rand. \"It is a series of experiments having to do with the chemical  nature of life,\" he said. Another perfunctory chuckle. \"No, I am not  trying to re-create Frankenstein's monster. The fact is, I am working  with fruit flies.\"    \"Something about heredity?\" Rand wanted to know.    Varcek laughed again, with more amusement. \"So! One says: 'Fruit flies,'  and immediately another thinks: 'Heredity.' It is practically a standard  response. Only, in this case, I am investigating the effect of diet  changes. I use fruit flies because of their extreme adaptability. If  I find that I am on the right track, I shall work with mice, next.\"    \"Fred Dunmore mentioned a packaged diabetic ration you'd developed,\" Rand  mentioned.    \"Oh, yes.\" Varcek shrugged. \"Yes. Something like an Army field-ration,  for diabetics to carry when traveling, or wherever proper food may be  unobtainable. That is for the company; soon we put it on the market, and  make lots of money. But this other, that is my own private work.\"    Dunmore had come in while Varcek was speaking and had seated himself  beside his wife.    \"Don't let him kid you, Colonel,\" he said. \"Anton's just as keen  about that dollar as the rest of us. I don't know what he's cooking  up, up there in the attic, but I'll give ten-to-one we'll be selling  it in twenty-five-cent packages inside a year, and selling plenty of  them.... Oh, and speaking about that dollar; how did you make out with  Gresham and his friends?\"    \"I didn't. They'd expected to pay about twenty thousand for the  collection; Rivers's offer has them stopped. And even if they could go  over twenty-five, I think Rivers would raise them. He's afraid to let  them get the collection; Pierre Jarrett and Karen Lawrence intended  using their share of it to go into the old-arms business, in competition  with him.\"    \"Uh-huh, that's smart,\" Dunmore approved. \"It's always better to take a  small loss stopping competition than to let it get too big for you. You  save a damn-sight bigger loss later.\"    \"How soon do you think the pistols will be sold?\" Gladys asked.    \"Oh, in about a month, at the outside,\" Rand said, continuing to explain  what had to be done first.    \"Well, I'm glad of that,\" Varcek commented. \"I never liked those things,  and after what happened ... The sooner they can be sold, the better.\"    Breakfast finally ended, and Varcek and Dunmore left for the Premix  plant. Rand debated for a moment the wisdom of speaking to Gladys about  the missing pistols, then decided to wait until his suspicions were  better verified. After a few minutes in the gunroom, going over Lane  Fleming's arms-books on the shelf over the workbench without finding any  trace of the book in which he had catalogued his collection, he got his  hat and coat, went down to the garage, and took out his car.    It had stopped raining for the time being; the dingy sky showed broken  spots like bits of bluing on a badly-rusted piece of steel. As he got out  of his car in front of Arnold Rivers's red-brick house, he was wondering  just how he was going to go about what he wanted to do. After all ...    The door of the shop was unlocked, and opened with a slow clanging of the  door-chime, but the interior was dark. All the shades had been pulled,  and the lights were out. For a moment Rand stood in the doorway,  adjusting his eyes to the darkness within and wondering where everybody  was.    Then, in the path of light that fell inward from the open door, he saw  two feet in tan shoes, toes up, at the end of tweed-trousered legs, on  the floor. An instant later he stepped inside, pulled the door shut after  him, and was using his pen-light to find the electric switch.    For a second or so after he snapped it nothing happened, and then the  darkness was broken by the flickering of fluorescent tubes. When they  finally lit, he saw the shape on the floor, arms outflung, the inverted  rifle above it. For a seemingly long time he stood and stared at the  grotesquely transfixed body of Arnold Rivers.    The dead man lay on his back, not three feet beyond the radius of the  door, in a pool of blood that was almost dried and gave the room a  sickly-sweet butchershop odor. Under the back of Rand's hand, Rivers's  cheek was cold; his muscles had already begun to stiffen in _rigor  mortis_. Rand examined the dead man's wounds. His coat was stained with  blood and gashed in several places; driven into his chest by a downward  blow, the bayonet of a short German service Mauser pinned him to the  floor like a specimen on a naturalist's card. Beside the one in which  the weapon remained, there were three stab-wounds in the chest, and the  lower part of the face was disfigured by what looked like a butt-blow.  Bending over, Rand could see the imprint of the Mauser butt-plate on  Rivers's jaw; on the butt-plate itself were traces of blood.    The rifle, a regulation German infantry weapon, the long-familiar _Gewehr  '98_ in its most recent modification, was a Nazi product, bearing the  eagle and encircled swastika of the Third Reich and the code-letters  _lza_--the symbol of the Mauserwerke A.G. plant at Karlsruhe. It had  doubtless been sold to Rivers by some returned soldier. In a rack beside  the door were a number of other bolt-action military rifles--a Krag, a  couple of Arisakas, a long German infantry rifle of the first World War,  a Greek Mannlicher, a Mexican Mauser, a British short model Lee-Enfield.  All had fixed bayonets; between the Lee-Enfield and one of the Arisakas  there was a vacancy.    Rivers's carved ivory cigarette-holder was lying beside the body, crushed  at the end as though it had been stepped on. A half-smoked cigarette had  been in it; it, too, was crushed. There was no evidence of any great  struggle, however; the attack which had ended the arms-dealer's life must  have come as a complete surprise. He had probably been holding the  cigarette-holder in his hand when the butt-blow had been delivered, and  had dropped it and flung up his arms instinctively. Thereupon, his  assailant had reversed his weapon and driven the bayonet into his chest.  The first blow, no doubt, had been fatal--it could have been any of the  three stabs in the chest--but the killer had given him two more, probably  while he was on the floor. Then, grasping the rifle in both hands, he had  stood over his victim and pinned the body to the floor. That last blow  could have only been inspired by pure anger and hatred.    Yet, apparently, Rivers had been unaware of his visitor's murderous"]]]
