That's what  good Old Master Ben tells me when I gets older.    I stay with Master Ben's married daughter, Mary, till the coming of  the War. Times was good before the War, and I wasn't suffering none  from slavery, except once in a while the Mistress would fan me with  the stick--bet I needed it, too.    When the War come along Master he say to leave Mistress Mary and get  ready to go to Texas. Jim Moore, one of the meanest men I ever see,  was the son of Master Ben; he's going take us there.    Demon Jim, that's what I call him when he ain't round the place, but  when he's home it was always Master Jim 'cause he was reckless with  the whip. He was a Rebel officer fighting round the country and didn't  take us slaves to Texas right away. So I stayed on at his place not  far from Master Ben's plantation.    Master Jim's wife was a demon, just like her husband. Used the whip  all the time, and every time Master Jim come home he whip me 'cause  the Mistress say I been mean.    One time I tell him, you better put me in your pocket (sell me),  Master Jim, else I'se going run away'. He don't pay no mind, and I  don't try to run away 'cause of the whips.    I done see one whipping and that enough. They wasn't no fooling about  it. A runaway slave from the Jenkin's plantation was brought back, and  there was a public whipping, so's the slaves could see what happens  when they tries to get away.    The runaway was chained to the whipping post, and I was full of misery  when I see the lash cutting deep into that boy's skin. He swell up  like a dead horse, but he gets over it, only he was never no count for  work no more.    While Master Jim is out fighting the Yanks, the Mistress is fiddling  round with a neighbor man, Mister Headsmith. I is young then, but I  knows enough that Master Jim's going be mighty mad when he hears about  it.    The Mistress didn't know I knows her secret, and I'm fixing to even up  for some of them whippings she put off on me. That's why I tell Master  Jim next time he come home.    See that crack in the wall? Master Jim say yes, and I say, it's just  like the open door when the eyes are close to the wall. He peek and  see into the bedroom.    That's how I find out about the Mistress and Mister Headsmith, I tells  him, and I see he's getting mad.    What you mean? And Master Jim grabs me hard by the arm like I was  trying to get away.    I see them in the bed.    That's all I say. The Demon's got him and Master Jim tears out of the  room looking for the Mistress.    Then I hears loud talking and pretty soon the Mistress is screaming  and calling for help, and if old Master Ben hadn't drop in just then  and stop the fight, why, I guess she be beat almost to death, that how  mad the Master was.    Then Master Ben gets mad 'cause his boy Jim ain't got us down in Texas  yet. Then we stay up all the night packing for the trip. Master Jim  takes us, but the Mistress stay at home, and I wonder if Master Jim  beat her again when he gets back.    We rides the wagons all the way, how many days, I dunno. The country  was wild most of the way, and I know now that we come through the same  country where I lives now, only it was to the east. (The trip was  evidently made over the \"Texas Road.\") And we keeps on riding and  comes to the big river that's all brown and red looking, (Red River)  and the next thing I was sold to Mrs. Vaughn at Bonham, Texas, and  there I stays till after the slaves is free.    The new Mistress was a widow, no children round the place, and she  treat me mighty good. She was good white folks--like old Master Ben,  powerful good.    When the word get to us that the slaves is free, the Mistress says I  is free to go anywheres I want. And I tell her this talk about being  free sounds like foolishment to me--anyway, where can I go? She just  pat me on the shoulder and say I better stay right there with her, and  that's what I do for a long time. Then I hears about how the white  folks down at Dallas pays big money for house girls and there I goes.    That's all I ever do after that--work at the houses till I gets too  old to hobble on these tired old feets and legs, then I just sits  down.    Just sits down and wishes for old Master Ben to come and get me, and  take care of this old woman like he use to do when she is just a  little black child on the plantation in Missouri!    God Bless old Master Ben--he was good white folks!          Oklahoma Writers' Project  Ex-Slaves    ELIZA EVANS  Age 87  McAlester, Okla.      I sho' remember de days when I was a slave and belonged to de best old  Master what ever was, Mr. John Mixon. We lived in Selma, Dallas  County, Alabama.    My grandma was a refugee from Africa. You know dey was white men who  went slipping 'round and would capture or entice black folks onto  their boats and fetch them over here and sell 'em for slaves. Well,  grandma was a little girl 'bout eight or nine years old and her  parents had sent her out to get wood. Dey was going to have a feast.  Dey was going to roast a baby. Wasn't that awful? Well, they captured  her and put a stick in her mouth. The stick held her mouth wide open  so she wouldn't cry out. When she got to de boat she was so tired out  she didn't do nothing.    They was a lot of more colored folks on de boat. It took about four  months to get across on de boat and Mr. John Mixon met the boat and  bought her. I think he gave five hundred dollars for her. She was  named Gigi, but Master John called her Gracie. She was so good and  they thought so much of her dat they gave her a grand wedding when she  was married. Master John told her he'd never sell none of her chillun.  He kept dat promise and he never did sell any of her grandchillun  either. He thought it was wrong to separate famblys. She was one  hundred and three years old when she died. I guess her mind got kind  of feeble 'cause she wandered off and fell into a mill race and was  drowned.    Master John Mixon had two big plantations. I believe he owned about  four hundred slaves, chillun and all. He allowed us to have church one  time a month with de white folks and we had prayer meeting every  Sunday. Sometimes when de men would do something like being sassy or  lazy and dey knowed dey was gonna be whipped, dey'd slip off and hide  in de woods. When dey'd slip back to get some food dey would all pray  for 'em dat Master wouldn't have 'em whipped too hard, and for fear  the Patroller would hear 'em they'd put their faces down in a dinner  pot. I'd sit out and watch for the Patroller. He was a white man who  was appointed to catch runaway niggers. We all knew him. His name was  Howard Campbell. He had a big pack of dogs. The lead hound was named  Venus. There was five or six in the pack, and they was vicious too.    My father was a carriage driver and he allus took the family to  church. My mother went along to take care of the little chilluns.  She'd take me too. They was Methodist and after they would take the  sacrament we would allus go up and take it. The niggers could use the  whitefolks church in the afternoon.    De Big House was a grand place. It was a two-story house made out of  logs dat had been peeled and smoothed off. There was five big rooms  and a big open hall wid a wide front porch clean across de front. De  porch had big posts and pretty banisters. It was painted white and had  green shutters on de windows. De kitchen was back of de Big House.    De slaves quarters was about a quarter of a mile from de Big House.  Their houses was made of logs and the cracks was daubed with mud. They  would have two rooms. Our bedsteads was made of poplar wood and we  kept them scrubbed white with sand. We used roped woven together for  slats. Our mattresses were made of cotton, grass, or even shucks. My  mother had a feather bed. The chairs was made from cedar with split  white oak bottoms.    Each family kept their own home and cooked and served their own meals.  We used wooden trays and wooden spoons. Once a week all the cullud  chillun went to the Big House to eat dinner. The table was out in de  yard. My nickname was \"Speck\". I didn't like to eat bread and milk  when I went up there and I'd just sit there. Finally they'd let me go  in de house and my mother would feed me. She was the house woman and  my Auntie was cook. I don't know why they had us up there unless it  was so they could laugh at us.    None of old Master's young niggers never did much work. He say he want  'em to grow up strong. He gave us lots to eat. He had a store of  bacon, milk, bread, beans and molasses. In summer we had vegetables.  My mother could make awful good corn pone. She would take meal and put  salt in it and pour boiling water over it and make into pones. She'd  wrap these pones in wet cabbage or collard leaves and roll dem into  hot ashes and bake dem. They sho' was good. We'd have possum and coon  and fish too.    The boys never wore no britches in de summer time. Boys fifteen years  old would wear long shirts with no sleeves and they went barefooted.  De girls dressed in shimmys. They was a sort of dress with two seams  in it and no sleeves.    Old Master had his slaves to get up about five o'clock. Dey did an  ordinary day's work. He never whipped them unless they was lazy or  sassy or had a fight. Sometimes his slaves would run away but they  allus come back. We didn't have no truck with railroaders 'cause we  like our home.    A woman cussed my mother and it made her mad and they had a fight. Old  Master had them both whipped. My mother got ten licks and de other  woman got twenty-five. Old Mistress sho' was mad 'cause mother got  whipped. Said he wouldn't have done it if she had known it. Old  Mistress taught mother how to read and write and mother taught my  father. I went to school jest one day so I can't read and write now.    Weddings was big days. We'd have big dinners and dances once in a  while [HW: and] when somebody died they'd hold a "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/20788"],[0,"Storm Over Warlock (#16)"],[1,"obviously well  fed and contented after their early morning activity.    When Shann protested with some heat, the other countered: \"Didn't you  ever hear of fish, Lantee? After a storm such as last night's, we ought  to discover good pickings along the shore.\"    But Shann was also sure that it was not only the thought of food which  drew Thorvald back to the sea.    They crawled back through the bolt hole. The beach of gravel-sand had  vanished save for a narrow ribbon of land just at the foot of the  cliffs, where the water curled in white lace about the barrier of  boulders. There was no change in the dullness of the sky; no sun broke  through the thick lid of clouds. And the green of the sea was ashened to  gray which matched that overcast until one could strain one's eyes  trying to find the horizon, unable to mark the dividing line here  between air and water.    Utgard was a broken necklace, the outermost island-beads lost, the inner  ones more isolated by the rise in water, more forbidding. Shann let out  a startled hiss of breath.    The top of a near-by rock detached itself, drew up into a hunched thing  of armor-plated scales and heavy wide-jawed head. A tail cracked into  the air; a double tail split into equal forks for half-way down its  length. A leg lifted as a forefoot, webbed, clawed for a new hold. This  sea beast was the most formidable native thing he had sighted on  Warlock, approaching in its ugliness the hound of the Throgs.    Breathing in labored gusts, the thing slapped its tail down on the  stones with a limpness which suggested that the raising of that  appendage had overtaxed its limited supply of strength. The head sank  forward, resting across one of the forelimbs. Then Shann sighted the  fearsome wound in the side just before one of the larger hind legs, a  ragged hole through which pumped with every one of those breaths a dark  purplish stream, licked away by the waves as it trickled slickly down  the rock.    \"What is that?\"    Thorvald shook his head. \"Not on our records,\" he replied absently,  studying the dying creature with avid attention. \"Must have been driven  in by the storm. This proves there is more in the sea then we knew!\"    Again the forked tail lifted and fell, the head, raised from the  forelimb, stretching up and back until the white underfolds of the  throat were exposed as the snout pointed almost vertically to the sky.  The jaws opened and from between them came a moaning whistle, a  complaint which was drowned out by the wash of the waves. Then, as if  that was the last effort, the webbed, clawed feet relaxed their grip of  the rock and the scaled body slid sidewise, out of their sight, into the  water. There was a feather of spume to mark the plunge and nothing else.    Shann, watching to see if the reptile would surface again, sighted  another object, a rounded shape floating on the sea, bobbing lightly as  had their river raft.    \"Look!\"    Thorvald's gaze followed his pointing finger and then before Shann could  protest, the officer leaped outward from their perch on the cliff to the  broad rock where the scaled sea dweller had lain moments earlier. He  stood there, watching that drifting object with the closest attention,  as Shann made the same crossing in his wake.    The drifting thing was oval, perhaps some six feet long and three wide,  the mid point rising in a curve from the water's edge. As far as Shann  could make out in the half-light the color was a reddish-brown, the  surface rough. And he thought by the way that it moved that it must be  flotsam of the storm, buoyant enough to ride the waves with close to  cork resiliency. To Shann's dismay his companion began to strip.    \"What are you going to do?\"    \"Get that.\"    Shann surveyed the water about the rock. The forked tail had sunk just  there. Was the Survey officer mad enough to think he could swim  unmenaced through a sea which might be infested with more such  creatures? It seemed that he was, for Thorvald's white body arched out  in a dive. Shann waited, half crouched and tense, as though he could in  some way attack anything rising from the depths to strike at his  companion.    A brown arm flashed above the surface. Thorvald swam strongly toward the  floating object. He reached it, his outstretched hand rasping across the  surface. And it responded so quickly to that touch that Shann guessed it  was even lighter and easier to handle than he had first thought.    Thorvald headed back, herding the thing before him. And when he climbed  out on the rock, Shann was pulling up his trophy. They flipped the find  over, to discover it hollow. They had, in effect, a ready-made craft not  unlike a canoe with blunted bows. But the substance was surely organic:  Was it shell? Shann speculated, running his finger tips over the  irregular surface.    The Survey officer dressed. \"We have our boat,\" he commented. \"Now for  Utgard--\"    Use this frail thing to dare the trip to the islands? But Shann did not  protest. If the officer determined to try such a voyage, he would do it.  And neither did the younger man doubt that he would accompany Thorvald.          9. ONE ALONE      Once again the beach was a wide expanse of shingle, drying fast under a  sun hotter than any Shann had yet known on Warlock. Summer had taken a  big leap forward. The Terrans worked in partial shade below a cliff  overhang, not only for the protection against the sun's rays, but also  as a precaution against any roving Throg air patrol.    Under Thorvald's direction the curious shell dragged from the sea--if it  were a shell, and the texture as well as the general shape suggested  that--was equipped with a framework to act as a stabilizing outrigger.  What resulted was certainly an odd-looking craft, but one which obeyed  the paddles and rode the waves easily.    In the full sunlight the outline of islands was  clear-cut--red-and-gray-rock above an aquamarine sea. The Terrans had  sighted no more of the sea monsters, and the major evidence of native  life along the shore was a new species of clak-claks, roosting in cliff  holes and scavenging along the sands, and various queer fish and shelled  things stranded in small tide pools--to the delight of the wolverines,  who fished eagerly up and down the beach, ready to investigate all  debris of the storm.    \"That should serve.\" Thorvald tightened the last lashing, straightening  up, his fists resting on his hips, to regard the craft with a measure of  pride.    Shann was not quite so content. He had matched the Survey officer in  industry, but the need for haste still eluded him. So the ship--such as  it was--was ready. Now they would be off to explore Thorvald's Utgard.  But a small and nagging doubt inside the younger man restrained his  enthusiasm over such a voyage. Fork-tail had come out of the section of  ocean which they must navigate in this very crude transport. And Shann  had no desire to meet an uninjured and alert fork-tail in the latter's  own territory.    \"Which island do we head for?\" Shann kept private his personal doubts of  their success. The outmost tip of that chain was only a distant smudge  lying low on the water.    \"The largest ... that one with trees.\"    Shann whistled. Since the night of the storm the wolverines were again  more amenable to the very light discipline he tried to keep. Perhaps the  fury of that elemental burst had tightened the bond between men and  animals, both alien to this world. Now Taggi and his mate padded toward  him in answer to his summons. But would the wolverines trust the boat?  Shann dared not risk their swimming, nor would he agree to leaving them  behind.    Thorvald had already stored their few provisions on board. And now Shann  steadied the craft against a rock which served them as a wharf, while he  coaxed Taggi gently. Though the wolverine protested, he at last  scrambled in, to hunch at the bottom of the shell, the picture of  apprehension. Togi took longer to make up her mind. And at length Shann  picked her up bodily, soothing her with quiet speech and stroking hands,  to put her beside her mate.    The shell settled under the weight of the passengers, but Thorvald's  foresight concerning the use of the outrigger proved right, for the  craft was seaworthy. It answered readily to the dip of their paddles as  they headed in a curve, keeping the first of the islands between them  and the open sea for a breakwater.    From the air, Thorvald's course would have been a crooked one, for he  wove back and forth between the scattered islands of the chain, using  their lee calm for the protection of the canoe. About two thirds of the  group were barren rock, inhabited only by clak-claks and creatures  closer to true Terran birds in that they wore a body plumage which  resembled feathers, though their heads were naked and leathery. And,  Shann noted, the clak-claks and the birds did not roost on the same  islands, each choosing their own particular home while the other species  did not invade that territory.    The first large-sized island they approached was crowned by trees, but  it had no beach, no approach from sea level. Perhaps it might be  possible to climb to the top of the cliff walls. But Thorvald did not  suggest that they try it, heading on toward the next large outcrop of  land and rock.    Here white lace patterned in a ring well out from the shore to mark a  circle of reefs. They nosed their way patiently around the outer  circumference of that threatening barrier, hunting the entrance to the  lagoon. Within, there were at least two beaches with climbable ascents  to the upper reaches inland. Though Shann noted that the vegetation  showing was certainly not luxuriant, the few trees within their range of  vision being pallid growths, rather like those they had sighted on the  fringe of the desert. Leather-headed flyers wheeled out over their  canoe, coasting on outspread wings to peer down at"]]]
