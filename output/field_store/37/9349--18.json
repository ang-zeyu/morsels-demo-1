He was, on a complaint  made by the Bishop, cited before the King's Court and called on to  justify his action. After a protracted investigation lasting for three  or four years, the King assented to the Abbot's wearing a mitre, and  recommended him to buy off further opposition on the part of the Bishop  by a grant of certain lands, which were worth L10 a year. At Easter,  1163, Abbot Robert celebrated Mass wearing for the first time mitre,  ring, gloves, and sandals. He also at the Council of Tours in the same  year took the first seat among the English Abbots, the Abbot of St.  Edmondsbury vainly attempting to take it from him. He gave costly gifts  to the church, built the chapter-house and the Locutorium, the Chapel of  St. Nicholas, part of the cloister, the long stable, granary, larder,  and two solars. He was buried in the new chapter-house, leaving the  monastery in debt, caused no doubt by his lavish expenditure in bribery  at Rome. On his death in October, 1166, the King kept the abbacy vacant  for several months, for at this time the great conflict between the King  and the Archbishop, Becket, was raging, and the King wished visibly to  assert his authority.    19. #Symeon# (1167-1183). Symeon had been Prior, and therefore had been  acting head of the monastery since Robert's death. He was a literary man  and an encourager of learning. Being an intimate friend of Thomas  Becket, he went to Prince Henry, the King's son, to intercede for the  Archbishop and bring about a reconciliation, if possible, with the King;  but he was driven from the court with contumely. Symeon finished the  shrine. The feretory made by Abbot Geoffrey still contained the bones of  the martyr; this was now covered by the work of Abbot Symeon, which was  made of large size so as to contain the other. The relics of Amphibalus  were discovered about this time at Redbourn, where he had been put to  death. The Bishop of Durham dedicated the Chapel of St. Cuthbert which  had been built by Richard (fifteenth Abbot). Like several of the other  Abbots, Symeon enriched his relations and left the Abbey in debt.    20. #Warren#, or #Warin, of Cambridge# (1183-1195). This Abbot was of  low birth, but had risen to the position of Prior. The sacrist alone  opposed his election on account of his birth and also because he  squinted, and predicted all manner of evils to the monastery if he were  elected Abbot. Henry II., soon after the new Abbot had been appointed,  and the Bishop of Lincoln happening to be at St. Albans at the same  time, the Bishop brought up the old grievance about the Abbey having  been made independent of him, but the King silenced him with angry  words. Warren founded a leper hospital for women as Geoffrey had founded  one for men. This hospital was dissolved by Wolsey in 1526, its revenues  going towards the endowment of Christ Church, Oxford. The bones of  Amphibalus were removed from the locker in which they were kept, and  placed in a new shrine adorned with gold and silver. This Abbot made  numerous regulations concerning the domestic affairs of the monastery;  one dealt with the dress, another made better provision for sick monks,  another shortened the services, another allowed meat in the infirmary,  yet another ordered that all dead monks should be buried in stone  coffins, not merely laid in earth graves. This Abbot, in lieu of  delivering up the chalice which Richard I. had demanded from all English  abbeys wherewith to pay his ransom, sent 200 marks of silver. Shortly  before his death he set aside 100 marks to be given to his successor for  renewing the west front of the church. Among his faults it is noted that  he was self-willed, that he banished to distant cells any of the  brethren that offended him, and that he felled timber belonging to the  Abbey and sent the proceeds as presents to the King and Queen.    21. #John de Cella# (1195-1214). This Abbot derived his name from the  Cell of Wallingford, of which he had been Prior. He was learned, pious,  and a good disciplinarian. He left the secular affairs of the Abbey to  be managed by the Prior and Cellarer, and devoted himself to his  religious duties, and to the fabric. He pulled down the Norman west  front with the intention of rebuilding it; he dug foundations, but after  he had spent Warren's legacy of 100 marks his walls had not risen above  the ground level. His master of the works led him into needless expense,  and as progress was so slow the Abbot became dispirited. He, however,  got another master of the works and started afresh, assigning to the  building fund one sheaf of wheat from every acre. This arrangement  lasted during the whole of his rule and for many years afterwards, but  progress was still slow. Gifts of gold and silver, considerable sums of  money collected by a wandering preacher, who pretended to be Amphibalus,  restored to life, were all consumed. At last in weariness of heart the  Abbot gave himself to other work; he began to build a new refectory and  dormitory, persuading the monks to give up wine for fifteen years, and  contribute the money so saved to the cost of the new building. He had a  great reputation for sanctity. At times, when he was saying mass,  responses were sung, so it is said, by voices not of this world. He  limited the number of monks to a hundred. King John ordered him to say  mass during the interdict, but he refused, whereupon John seized the  monastery and ejected the monks, and only on payment of 600 marks, and  afterwards of 500 more, would he restore the Abbey to its rightful  owners.    22. #William of Trumpington# (1214-1235). This Abbot was an entirely  different style of man from his predecessor. He was much addicted to  social enjoyment, was a good man of business, and looked into matters  thoroughly for himself; he visited all the cells belonging to the Abbey,  and carried on the work of building in an energetic manner. The  dormitory was finished, the aisles were roofed with oak, an octagon  built on the tower, and, chief of all, the long-delayed work at the west  end was resumed and finished. The sacrist, Walter of Colchester, was an  excellent carver and carved a handsome pulpit with a great cross  thereon, and statues of St. John and the Virgin. The shrine of St.  Amphibalus, which had stood to the south of that of St. Alban, was moved  to the middle of the nave and inclosed within iron screenwork; much  other carving was done in the church and many new altars dedicated. A  fine bell was given for services in honour of our Lady; the Chapel of  St. Cuthbert with a dormitory over it for seven monks was rebuilt; most  of the walls were replastered; cloister walks were built, fitted with  oak beams, ceiled and covered with oak shingles. This Abbot acquired  much property for the Abbey, but during the civil wars large sums were  extorted by either party. In 1235 the church was struck by lightning and  set on fire, but fortunately a tank of rainwater was close at hand, and  the fire was soon extinguished. As the Abbot died eight days afterwards,  the accident was looked upon as a presage of his coming death.    23. #John of Hertford# (1235-1260). He had been sacristan and afterwards  prior of the cell at Hertford. The Pope's bull confirming his election  required him to present himself at Rome every three years. The church  was again struck by lightning, notwithstanding the fact that the  impression of the Pope's seal, bearing an image of the Lamb of God, had  been duly placed on the top of the tower as a protection against  lightning. Abbot John built the guest-house, and devoted the revenues of  three rectories to the improvement of the quality of the ale, and for  the providing of better entertainment for guests. He repaired many of  the buildings belonging to the Abbey, the granary, water mills, houses  in London, etc. At the coronation of Henry III. the Abbot of St. Albans  took precedence of all the mitred abbots; and though afterwards the  Abbot of Westminster obtained precedence, yet in 1536 the signature of  Abbot Catton of St. Albans stands first, that of Abbot Benson of  Westminster following, in the list of names attached to the \"Articles of  Faith\" drawn up by Convocation. So it would appear that the Abbots of  St. Albans had by this time recovered their rights of precedence. When  the see of Lincoln was vacant, the Archbishop proposed to hold an  ordination in St. Albans Abbey, but was refused permission. During this  Abbot's rule the Pope demanded more than once large sums of money; the  Abbot refused to pay, and in consequence of his refusal the church was  put under an interdict. At this time lived the celebrated monk Matthew  of Paris, to whom we owe much of the knowledge we possess of the history  of the Abbey up to his own days. The Chronicles carry us nearly up to  the end of Abbot John's rule, Matthew himself dying only a year before  the Abbot. For the subsequent history, up to the abbacy of Thomas de la  Mare, thirtieth Abbot, we are indebted to Thomas of Walsingham. Matthew  was born about 1200, and though of English descent derived his surname  from the French capital, either because it was his birthplace, or  because he was a student at its university. He became a monk of St.  Albans on January 21st, 1217. He went with Abbot John of Hertford to  London to be present at the marriage of Henry III. to Eleanor of  Provence, 1236; and again he went to Westminster Abbey for the  celebration of the feast of the founder, on which occasion he was asked  by the King to write an account of the proceedings. He was sent on a  mission to the Benedictine monastery at Trondhjem in 1248, attended the  royal court at Winchester in 1251, and was present at the marriage of  Henry's daughter to the Scottish King, Alexander II. When Henry III.  spent a week at St. Albans in 1257, he admitted Matthew to his table and  treated him with great confidence, communicating many facts "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/19499"],[0,"Music Notation and Terminology (#16)"],[1,"erformance.         When secular in subject the _cantata_ differs from the opera       in not usually having definite characters, and in being always       rendered without scenery or action.         Examples of the _sacred cantata_ are: Stainer's \"The       Crucifixion,\" Clough-Leighter's \"The Righteous Branch,\" and       Gaul's \"The Holy City.\" Examples of the _secular cantata_ are:       Bruch's \"Armenius,\" Coleridge-Taylor's \"Hiawatha.\"    167. An _oratorio_ is a composition on a large scale for chorus,  soloists, and orchestra, the text usually dealing with some religious  subject. The _oratorio_, as noted above, is not intended for the church  service, but is written for concert performance.    168. An _opera_ is a composition for vocal soloists, chorus, and  orchestra, with characters, action, scenery, and dramatic movement. It  is a drama set to music.         _Grand opera_ is opera with a serious plot, in which       everything is sung, there being no spoken dialog at all.         _Opera comique_ is a species of opera in which part of the       dialog is spoken and part sung. _Opera comique_ is not       synonymous with _comic opera_, for the plot of opera comique       is as often serious as not. In fact the entire distinction       between the terms _grand opera_ and _opera comique_ is being       broken down, the latter term referring merely to operas first       given at the Opera Comique in Paris, and the former term to       those given at the Grand Opera House in the same city.         A _comic opera_ is a humorous opera, the plot providing many       amusing situations and the whole ending happily. It       corresponds with the _comedy_ in literature.         A _light opera_ is one with an exceedingly trivial plot, in       which songs, dances, and pretty scenery contribute to the       amusement of the audience. The music is lively, but usually as       trivial as the plot.         The term _music drama_ was used by Wagner in referring to his       own _operas_, and is also sometimes applied to other modern       _operas_ in which the dramatic element is supposed to       predominate over the musical.    169. A _libretto_ (lit.--little book) is the word-text of an opera,  oratorio, cantata, or some other similar work.    170. _Recitative_ is a style of vocal solo common to operas, oratorios,  and cantatas, especially those written some time ago. Its main  characteristic is that the word-text is of paramount importance, both  rhythm and tone-progression being governed by rhetorical rather than by  musical considerations.         _Recitative_ undoubtedly originated in the intoning of the       priest in the ritualistic service of the Church, but when       applied to the opera it became an important means of securing       dramatic effects, especially in situations in which the action       of the play moved along rapidly. _Recitative_ is thus seen to       be a species of musical declamation.         In the early examples of _recitative_ there was scarcely any       accompaniment, often only one instrument (like the cello)       being employed to play a sort of obbligato melody: when full       chords were played they were not written out in the score, but       were merely indicated in a more or less general way by certain       signs and figures. (See \"thorough-bass,\" p. 85, Sec. 200.)         But about the middle of the seventeenth century a slightly       different style of _recitative_ was invented, and in this type       the orchestra was employed much more freely in the       accompaniment, especially in the parts between the phrases of       the text, but to some extent also to support the voice while       singing. This new style was called _recitativo stromento_       (_i.e._, accompanied recitative), while the original type was       called _recitativo secco_ (_i.e._, dry recitative).         During the last century the style of _recitative_ has been       still further developed by Gluck and Wagner, both of whom used       the orchestra as an independent entity, with interesting       melodies, harmonies and rhythms all its own, while the vocal       part is a sort of obbligato to this accompaniment. But even in       this latest phase of _recitative_, it is the word-text that       decides the style of both melody and rhythm in the voice part.       Fig. 61 shows an example of _dry recitative_, taken from \"The       Messiah.\"         [Illustration: ALTO VOICE. Be-hold! a vir-gin shall con-ceive,       and bear a son, and shall call his name Em-man-u-el; God with       us.]    171. _Aria_ is likewise a style of vocal solo found in operas, etc., but  its predominating characteristic is diametrically opposed to that of the  recitative. In the _aria_ the word-text is usually entirely subordinate  to the melody, and the latter is often very ornate, containing trills,  runs, etc.    The rendition of this ornate style of music is often referred to as  \"coloratura singing,\" but it should be noted that not all _arias_ are  coloratura in style.         The familiar solos from The Messiah--\"Rejoice Greatly,\" and       \"The trumpet shall sound\" are good examples of the aria style.    172. A _lied_ (Ger. = song) is a vocal solo in which the text, the  melody, and the accompaniment contribute more or less equally to the  effect of the whole.         Strictly speaking the word _lied_ means \"a poem to be sung,\"       and this meaning will explain at once the difference between       the _lied_ on the one hand, and the Italian recitative and       aria on the other, for in the _lied_ the text is of great       importance, but the music is also interesting, while in the       recitative the text was important but the music very slight,       and in the aria the text was usually inconsequential while the       music held the center of interest.    The most pronounced characteristic of the _lied_ is the fact that it  usually portrays a single mood, sentiment, or picture, thus differing  from the ballad, which is narrative in style. It will be noted that this  \"single mood, or sentiment, or picture\" was originally conceived by the  poet who wrote the word-text, and that the composer in writing music to  this text has first tried to get at the thought of the poet, and has  then attempted to compose music which would intensify and make more  vivid that thought. This intensification of the poet's thought comes as  often through the rhythm, harmony, and dynamics of the accompaniment as  through the expressiveness of the voice part.         The style of song-writing in which each verse is sung to the       same tune is called the \"strophe form,\" while that in which       each verse has a different melody is often referred to as the       \"continuous\" or \"through-composed\" form (Ger.       durch-componiert).    173. A _ballad_ was originally a short, simple song, the words being in  narrative style, _i.e._, the word-text telling a story. In the earlier  _ballads_ each verse of the poem was usually sung to the same tune  (strophe form), but in the _art-ballad_ as developed by Loewe and others  the continuous style of composition is employed, this giving the  composer greater opportunities of making vivid through his music the  events described by the poem. These later _ballads_ are in consequence  neither \"short\" nor \"simple\" but compare in structure with the lied  itself.    174. A _folk-song_ is a short song sung by and usually originating among  the common people. Its dominant characteristic is usually _simplicity_,  this applying to word-text, melody, and accompaniment (if there is one).  The text of the _folk-song_ is usually based on some event connected  with ordinary life, but there are also many examples in which historical  and legendary happenings are dealt with. Auld Lang Syne, and Comin' thru  the Rye, are examples of _folk-songs_.         There has been some difference of opinion as to whether a       song, the composer of which is known, can ever constitute a       real _folk-song_: recent writers seem to be taking the       sensible view of the matter, viz.: that if a song has the       characteristics of a folk- rather than an art-song, and if it       remains popular for some time among the common people, then it       is just as much a _folk-song_ whether the composer happens to       be known or not.    175. A _madrigal_ is a secular vocal composition having from three to  eight parts. It is in contrapuntal style, like the motet, and is usually  sung a capella.    176. A _glee_ is a vocal composition in three or more parts, being  usually more simple in style than the madrigal, and sometimes having  more than one movement. The _glee_ may be either gay or sad in mood, and  seems to be a composition peculiar to the English people.    177. A _part-song_ is a composition for two or more voices, (usually  four) to be sung a capella. It is written in monophonic rather than in  polyphonic style, thus differing from the madrigal and glee. Morley's  \"Now is the Month of Maying\" is an example of the _part-song_, as is  also Sullivan's \"O Hush Thee, My Baby.\" The term _part-song_ is often  loosely applied to glees, madrigals, etc.          CHAPTER XVII    RHYTHM, MELODY, HARMONY AND INTERVALS      178. The _four elements_ commonly attributed to music (in the order of  their development) are: Rhythm, Melody, Harmony, and Timbre (or  tone-color).    179. _Rhythm_ is the regular recurrence of accent. In music it is more  specifically the regular recurrence of groups of accented and  non-accented beats (or pulses)--according to some specified  measure-system. Since rhythm implies continuity, there must usually be  at least two such measure groups in order to make musical rhythm  possible. (See p. 44, Sec. 97.)    180. A _melody_ is a succession of single tones of various pitches so  arranged that the effect of the whole will be unified, coherent, and  pleasing to the ear.         The soprano part of"]]]
