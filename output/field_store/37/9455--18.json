But now, I confess,  I'm very much at a loss what to suggest.  It seems to me we have only  purchased a brief delay.\"    \"True,\" answered Jack.  \"The delay is not so brief, however, but that we  may plan some method of getting the poor girl out of this scrape.--What  say you, Mak?\"    \"If _you_ no can tink 'pon someting, I gib up all hope,\" replied our  guide sorrowfully.    \"Come, Mak, cheer up,\" cried Peterkin.  \"If the worst comes to the  worst, you can, at any rate, fight for your bride.\"    \"Fight!\" exclaimed the negro, displaying his white teeth like a mastiff,  rolling his eyes and clinching his fists convulsively.  Then in a calmer  tone he continued, \"Ay, me can fight.  Me could kill all de guards an'  take Okandaga by de hand, an' run troo de bushes for eber.  But guards  no die widout hollerin' an' yellerin' like de gorilla; an' nigger mans  can run fasterer dan womans.  No, no, dat am dumpossobable.\"    \"Nothing's `dumpossobable' to brave hearts and stout arms,\" replied  Jack.  \"There are only four guards put over her, I believe.  Well, there  are just four of us--not that we require to be equal, by any means.  Peterkin and I could settle them easily; but we require to be equal in  numbers, in order to do it quietly.  I have a plan in my head, but  there's one hitch in it that I cannot unravel.\"    \"And what may that be?\"  If asked.    \"Why, I don't see how, after getting clear off with Okandaga, we are to  avoid being pursued on suspicion and captured.\"    \"Dere is one cave,\" remarked the guide, \"not far off to here.  P'raps we  be safe if we git into 'im.  But I 'fraid it not do, cause him be  peepiled by fiends an' dead man's spirits.\"    \"That's a grave objection,\" said Peterkin, laughing.    \"Yes, an' de tribe neber go near dere; dey is most drefful terrorfied to  be cotched dere.\"    \"Then, that will just do,\" cried Jack, with animation.  \"The very thing.  And now I'll tell you what my plan is.  To-morrow morning early we will  tell the king that we wish to be off at once--that we have put off too  much time already, and wish to make no further delay.  Then we'll pack  up and start.  At night we will encamp in a quiet, out-of-the-way part  of the woods, and slip back to the village in the dark a short time  before midnight.  The whole village will at that time be assembled,  probably, at the spot where the execution is to take place; so we can  rush in, overpower the guard, free Okandaga, and make our escape to the  cave, where they will never think of looking for us.\"    Peterkin shook his head.  \"There are two difficulties in your plan,  Jack.  First, what if the natives are _not_ assembled on the place of  execution, and we find it impossible to make our entrance into or exit  from the village quietly?\"    \"I propose,\" replied Jack, \"that we shall undress ourselves, rub  ourselves entirely over with charcoal and grease, so that they shall not  recognise us, and dash in and carry the girl off by a _coup de main_.  In which case it will, of course, be neck or nothing, and a tremendous  race to the cave, where, if they follow us, we will keep them at bay  with our rifles.\"    \"Umph! dashing, no doubt, but risky,\" said Peterkin--\"extremely risky.  Yet it's worth trying.  Well, my second difficulty is--what if they  don't stick to their promise after we quit, and kill the poor thing  before midnight?\"    \"We must take our chance of that.  But I shall put the king on his  honour before leaving, and say that I will make particular inquiry into  the way in which the trial has been conducted on my return.\"    \"Put the king on his honour!\" observed Peterkin.  \"I'm afraid that  you'll put his majesty on an extremely unstable foundation.  However, I  see nothing better that can be done.\"    \"Have you any more difficulties?\"    \"Yes,\" said I.  \"There is one other.  What do you propose to do with the  men who are to be supplied us by the king during these extremely  delicate and difficult manoeuvres?\"    The countenances of my comrades fell at this question.    \"I never thought of them,\" said Jack.    \"Nor I,\" said Peterkin.    Makarooroo groaned.    \"Well,\" said I, \"if you will allow me to suggest, I would recommend that  we should, towards the close of the day, send them on ahead of us, and  bid them encamp at a certain place, saying that we shall spend the night  in hunting, and return to them in the morning.\"    \"The very thing,\" said Jack.  \"Now, comrades, to rest.  I will occupy  myself until I fall asleep in maturing my plans and thinking out the  details.  Do you the same, and if anything should occur to you let us  consult over it in the morning.\"    We were all glad to agree to this, being wearied more perhaps by  excitement than want of rest; so bidding each other good-night, we lay  down side by side to meditate, and for my part to dream of the difficult  and dangerous work that awaited us on the morrow.        CHAPTER SEVEN.    WE CIRCUMVENT THE NATIVES.    We arose on the following morning with the dawn of day, and began to  make preparation for our departure.    To our satisfaction we found the king quite willing that we should go;  so embarking our goods in one of the native canoes, we ordered our  negroes to embark, and commenced our journey amid the firing of guns and  the good wishes of the natives.  I must confess that I felt some  probings of conscience at the thought of the double part we were  compelled to play; but the recollection of the horrid fate that awaited  the poor negro girl put to flight such feelings, and induced a longing  for the time of action to arrive.    I have more than once referred to our goods.  Perhaps it may be as well  to explain that, when we first landed on the African coast, we made  inquiries of those who were best acquainted with the nature and  requirements of the country we were about to explore, as to what goods  we ought to purchase of the traders, in order to be in a position to pay  our way as we went along; for we could not, of course, expect the  savages to feed us and lodge us and help us on our way for nothing.  After mature consideration, we provided ourselves with a supply of such  things as were most necessary and suitable--such as tobacco, powder, and  shot, and ball, a few trade-guns, several pieces of brightly-coloured  cloth, packages of beads (some white enamelled, others of coloured  glass), coffee and tea, knives, scissors, rings, and a variety of other  knick-knacks.  These, with a little brandy to be used medicinally, our  blankets and camp cooking utensils, formed a heavy load for ten men;  but, of course, as we advanced, the load was lightened by the  consumption of our provisions and the giving away of goods.  The  additions which I made, however, in the shape of stuffed specimens,  began in the course of time to more than counterbalance this advantage.    Being resolved to impress the natives with a respect for our physical  powers, we made a point of each carrying a pretty heavy load on our  journeys--excepting, of course, when we went out a-hunting.  But to  return.    Our crew worked willingly and well, so that ere night closed in upon us  we were a considerable distance away from the village.  As the sun set  we landed, and ordering our men to advance in the canoe to a certain  bend in the river, and there encamp and await our return, we landed and  went off into the woods as if to search for game.    \"Now, Makarooroo, quick march, and don't draw rein till we reach the  cave,\" said Jack when we were out of sight of the canoe.    Our guide obeyed in silence, and for the next two hours we travelled  through the woods at a sort of half trot that must have carried us over  the ground at the rate of five miles in hour.  The pace was indeed  tremendous, and I now reaped the benefit of those long pedestrian  excursions which for years past I had been taking, with scientific ends  in view, over the fields and hills of my native land.  Jack and Peterkin  seemed both to be made of iron, and incapable of suffering from fatigue.  But I have no doubt that the exciting and hazardous nature of the  expedition on which we had embarked had much to do with our powers of  endurance.    After running and doubling, gliding and leaping through the dense woods,  as I have said, for two hours, we arrived at a broken, rocky piece of  ground, over which we passed, and eventually came upon a thick jungle  that concealed a vast cliff almost entirely from view.  The cracking of  the bushes as we approached showed that we had disturbed the slumbers of  more than one of the wild beasts that inhabited the spot.  Here  Makarooroo paused, and although it was intensely dark I could observe  that he was trembling violently.    \"Come, Mak,\" said I in a whisper, \"surely you, who have received a  Christian education, do not really believe that devils inhabit this  spot?\"    \"Me don know, massa.  Eber since me was be a pikaniny me 'fraid--  horrobably 'fraid ob dat cave.\"    \"Come, come,\" said Jack impatiently; \"we have no time for fears of any  kind this night.  Think of Okandaga, Mak, and be a man.\"    This was sufficient.  The guide pushed boldly forward, and led us to the  mouth of a large cavern, at which he halted and pointed to the gloomy  interior.    \"You have the matches, Peterkin; quick, strike a light.  It is getting  late,\" said Jack.    In another moment a light was struck, and with it we kindled three  goodly-sized torches with which we had provided ourselves.  Holding  these high over our heads, we entered the cavern--Jack first, Peterkin  second, I next, and the terrified negro in rear.    We had scarcely entered, and were peering upwards at the black vault  overhead, when an indescribable rushing sound filled the air of the  cavern, and caused the flame of our torches to flicker with such  violence that we could not see any object distinctly.  We all came to a  "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/2176"],[0,"Seven Discourses on Art (#16)"],[1,"of nothing.    Homer is supposed to be possessed of all the learning of his time.  And  we are certain that Michael Angelo and Raffaelle were equally possessed  of all knowledge in the art which was discoverable in the works of their  predecessors.    A mind enriched by an assemblage of all the treasures of ancient and  modern art will be more elevated and fruitful in resources in proportion  to the number of ideas which have been carefully collected and thoroughly  digested.  There can be no doubt that he who has the most materials has  the greatest means of invention; and if he has not the power of using  them, it must proceed from a feebleness of intellect or from the confused  manner in which those collections have been laid up in his mind.    The addition of other men's judgment is so far from weakening, as is the  opinion of many, our own, that it will fashion and consolidate those  ideas of excellence which lay in their birth feeble, ill-shaped, and  confused, but which are finished and put in order by the authority and  practice of those whose works may be said to have been consecrated by  having stood the test of ages.    The mind, or genius, has been compared to a spark of fire which is  smothered by a heap of fuel and prevented from blazing into a flame.  This  simile, which is made use of by the younger Pliny, may be easily mistaken  for argument or proof.    There is no danger of the mind's being over-burdened with knowledge, or  the genius extinguished by any addition of images; on the contrary, these  acquisitions may as well, perhaps better, be compared, if comparisons  signified anything in reasoning, to the supply of living embers, which  will contribute to strengthen the spark that without the association of  more would have died away.    The truth is, he whose feebleness is such as to make other men's thoughts  an incumbrance to him can have no very great strength of mind or genius  of his own to be destroyed, so that not much harm will be done at worst.    We may oppose to Pliny the greater authority of Cicero, who is  continually enforcing the necessity of this method of study.  In his  dialogue on Oratory he makes Crassus say, that one of the first and most  important precepts is to choose a proper model for our imitation.  _Hoc  fit primum in preceptis meis ut demonstremus quem imitemur_.    When I speak of the habitual imitation and continued study of masters, it  is not to be understood that I advise any endeavour to copy the exact  peculiar colour and complexion of another man's mind; the success of such  an attempt must always be like his who imitates exactly the air, manner,  and gestures of him whom he admires.  His model may be excellent, but the  copy will be ridiculous; this ridicule does not arise from his having  imitated, but from his not having chosen the right mode of imitation.    It is a necessary and warrantable pride to disdain to walk servilely  behind any individual, however elevated his rank.  The true and liberal  ground of imitation is an open field, where, though he who precedes has  had the advantage of starting before you, yet it is enough to pursue his  course; you need not tread in his footsteps, and you certainly have a  right to outstrip him if you can.    Nor, whilst I recommend studying the art from artists, can I be supposed  to mean that nature is to be neglected?  I take this study in aid and not  in exclusion of the other.  Nature is, and must be, the fountain which  alone is inexhaustible; and from which all excellences must originally  flow.    The great use of studying our predecessors is to open the mind, to  shorten our labour, and to give us the result of the selection made by  those great minds of what is grand or beautiful in nature: her rich  stores are all spread out before us; but it is an art, and no easy art,  to know how or what to choose, and how to attain and secure the object of  our choice.    Thus the highest beauty of form must be taken from nature; but it is an  art of long deduction and great experience to know how to find it.    We must not content ourselves with merely admiring and relishing; we must  enter into the principles on which the work is wrought; these do not swim  on the superficies, and consequently are not open to superficial  observers.    Art in its perfection is not ostentatious; it lies hid, and works its  effect itself unseen.  It is the proper study and labour of an artist to  uncover and find out the latent cause of conspicuous beauties, and from  thence form principles for his own conduct; such an examination is a  continual exertion of the mind, as great, perhaps, as that of the artist  whose works he is thus studying.    The sagacious imitator not only remarks what distinguishes the different  manner or genius of each master; he enters into the contrivance in the  composition, how the masses of lights are disposed, the means by which  the effect is produced, how artfully some parts are lost in the ground,  others boldly relieved, and how all these are mutually altered and  interchanged according to the reason and scheme of the work.  He admires  not the harmony of colouring alone, but he examines by what artifice one  colour is a foil to its neighbour.  He looks close into the tints, of  what colours they are composed, till he has formed clear and distinct  ideas, and has learnt to see in what harmony and good colouring consists.  What is learnt in this manner from the works of others becomes really our  own, sinks deep, and is never forgotten; nay, it is by seizing on this  clue that we proceed forward, and get further and further in enlarging  the principle and improving the practice.    There can be no doubt but the art is better learnt from the works  themselves than from the precepts which are formed upon these works; but  if it is difficult to choose proper models for imitation, it requires no  less circumspection to separate and distinguish what in those models we  ought to imitate.    I cannot avoid mentioning here, though it is not my intention at present  to enter into the art and method of study, an error which students are  too apt to fall into.    He that is forming himself must look with great caution and wariness on  those peculiarities, or prominent parts, which at first force themselves  upon view, and are the marks, or what is commonly called the manner, by  which that individual artist is distinguished.    Peculiar marks I hold to be generally, if not always, defects, however  difficult it may be, wholly to escape them.    Peculiarities in the works of art are like those in the human figure; it  is by them that we are cognisable and distinguished one from another, but  they are always so many blemishes, which, however, both in the one case  and in the other, cease to appear deformities to those who have them  continually before their eyes.  In the works of art, even the most  enlightened mind, when warmed by beauties of the highest kind, will by  degrees find a repugnance within him to acknowledge any defects; nay, his  enthusiasm will carry him so far as to transform them into beauties and  objects of imitation.    It must be acknowledged that a peculiarity of style, either from its  novelty, or by seeming to proceed from a peculiar turn of mind, often  escapes blame; on the contrary, it is sometimes striking and pleasing;  but this it is vain labour to endeavour to imitate, because novelty and  peculiarity being its only merit, when it ceases to be new, it ceases to  have value.    A manner, therefore, being a defect, and every painter, however  excellent, having a manner, it seems to follow that all kinds of faults,  as well as beauties, may be learned under the sanction of the greatest  authorities.    Even the great name of Michael Angelo may be used to keep in countenance  a deficiency, or rather neglect of colouring, and every other ornamental  part of the art.    If the young student is dry and hard, Poussin is the same.  If his work  has a careless and unfinished air, he has most of the Venetian School to  support him.  If he makes no selection of objects, but takes individual  nature just as he finds it, he is like Rembrandt.  If he is incorrect in  the proportions of his figures, Correggio was likewise incorrect.  If his  colours are not blended and united, Rubens was equally crude.    In short, there is no defect but may be excused, if it is a sufficient  excuse that it can be imputed to considerable artists; but it must be  remembered that it was not by these defects they acquired their  reputation: they have a right to our pardon, but not to our admiration.    However, to imitate peculiarities or mistake defects for beauties that  man will be most liable who confines his imitation to one favourite  master; and, even though he chooses the best, and is capable of  distinguishing the real excellences of his model, it is not by such  narrow practice that a genius or mastery in the art is acquired.  A man  is as little likely to form a true idea of the perfection of the art by  studying a single artist as he would be of producing a perfectly  beautiful figure by an exact imitation of any individual living model.    And as the painter, by bringing together in one piece those beauties  which are dispersed amongst a great variety of individuals, produces a  figure more beautiful than can be found in nature, so that artist who can  unite in himself the excellences of the various painters, will approach  nearer to perfection than any one of his masters.    He who confines himself to the imitation of an individual, as he never  proposes to surpass, so he is not likely to equal, the object of  imitation.  He professes only to follow, and he that follows must  necessarily be behind.    We should imitate the conduct of the great artists in the course of their  studies, as well as the works which they produced, when they were  perfectly formed.  Raffaelle began by imitating"]]]
