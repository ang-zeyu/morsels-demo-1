In four or five years at least I ought to get through my  course here, and then there is nothing to prevent my settling down at  once.  By that time I hope you'll be well enough to come and keep house  for me, for all country doctors, you know, are bachelors,\" and so on.    All this was very well, and, as one of Tom's friends, I rejoiced to see  him thus setting himself in earnest to the duties of his calling.  But I  rejoiced with trembling.  Although he kept clear, for the most part, of  his fellow-students, choosing his friends charily and shyly, I could yet  see that he had no objection to contemplate from a distance the humours  and festivities of his more high-spirited companions.  He was not one of  those impulsive fellows who shut their eyes and take a header into the  midst of a new good-fellowship, only to discover too late their error,  and repent their rashness at leisure.    No, Tom had his eyes open.  He saw the evil as well as the good, and,  alas for him, having seen it, he looked still!    The students of Saint Elizabeth's Hospital were not on the whole a bad  set.  On Tom's arrival in London, however, he had the firm impression in  his mind that all medical students were bad characters, and this foolish  notion did him much harm.  If two or three of them were to go off for a  spree, his imagination would at once picture them in scenes and places  such as no respectable man would like to frequent, whereas, if the truth  were known, these misjudged young men had committed no greater crime  than that of taking a boat up the river, or a drive in a dog-cart.  If a  group of them should be seen by him laughing and talking, he  instinctively concluded their topic must be ribaldry, whereas they would  perhaps be only joking at the expense of some eccentric professor, or  else chaffing one of their own number.  And so it happened that Tom  failed in time to distinguish between the really bad and such as he only  imagined to be bad; and from his habit of looking on at them and their  doings from a studied distance, their presence began gradually and  insensibly to exercise a very considerable influence over his mind.    \"After all,\" he would sometimes say to himself, \"these fellows get on.  They pass their exams, they pay their bills, they gain the confidence of  their professors, and at the same time they manage to enjoy themselves.  Perhaps I am a fool to take so much pains about the first three of these  things, and to deny myself the fourth.  Perhaps, after all, these  fellows are not so bad as I have fancied, or perhaps I am prudish.\"    And then the silly fellow, having once inclined to admit there was  something to be said for medical students, and having before considered  all bad alike, became tolerant all round, more particularly of the  really bad set, who appeared to him to enjoy themselves the most.    As his companions became more attractive to him, his work became less  interesting.    \"Why should I grind and plod here,\" he said, \"while every one else is  enjoying himself?  If young Charlie were here, I'm pretty sure _he'd_ be  in for some of their sprees, and laugh at me for wearing my eyes out as  I'm doing.\"    And then he leaned back in his chair and took to wondering what the six  fellows who started that afternoon for Richmond were doing.  Smashing  the windows of the \"Star and Garter,\" perhaps, or fighting the bargees  on the river, or capturing a four-in-hand drag, or disporting themselves  in some such genial and truly English manner.  And as Tom conjured up  the picture he half envied them their sport.    So he gradually became restless and discontented.  The days were weary  and the evenings intolerably dull.  The visits to Mr Newcome were of  course pleasant enough, but it was slow being cooped up an entire Sunday  with two old people.  On the whole, life in London was becoming stupid.    One of the first symptoms of his altered frame of mind was the  occasional neglect of his regular letter to Charlie.  That ever-faithful  young man wrote as punctually as clockwork.  Every Thursday morning a  letter lay on Tom's plate at breakfast-time, addressed in the well-known  hand, and bearing the Randlebury post-mark.  And jolly lively letters  they were.    I remembered one of them well.  It came after two weeks' omission on  Tom's part, and ran thus:--      \"Dear Tom,      \"A pretty fellow you are to correspond with!  Here am I, piping to you    with all my might, but I can't get you to dance.  I know what you'll    tell me, you old humbug--`awfully hard grind'--`exam coming    on'--`lectures day and night,' and rubbish like that.  All very well,    but look here, Thomas, don't fancy that your diligence in cutting off    legs and arms can be an excuse for cutting yours truly in this    heartless manner.  Not having a letter of yours to answer, I don't    know how I shall scrape up material enough for a yarn.  There was a    big football-match on Saturday, and Jim and I were in it.  You should    have seen me turning somersaults, and butting my head into the    fellows' stomachs.  Jim and I got shoulder to shoulder once in the    game.  You know old Howe?  Well, he was running with the ball to wards    our goal, and Jim and I were in front of him.      I was nearest, and charged, and over I went like a ninepin; then Jim    was on him, and over _he_ went too.  However, I was up again in time    to jump on Howe's back; but he shook me off on to the ground on my    nose.  Then Jim, having recovered, took _his_ fling, and a rare fling    it was, for Howe dodged him just as he was at the top of a kangaroo    leap, and left him looking very foolish in a sitting posture on the    ground.  However, in dodging, Howe had allowed me time to extricate my    nose from the earth and make my third attempt.  This time was more    successful, for I got my hands round the ball; but I shouldn't have    kept them there if Jim hadn't taken the opportunity of executing    another astounding buck-jump, which landed him safe on his man's    shoulders, where he stuck like a scared cat on the back of a    somnambulist.  So between us we brought our quarry to earth and gained    no end of applause.  Wasn't it prime?      That's about all the news here, except that Willoughby is going to    Trinity at Midsummer, and that Salter is laid up from the effects of    an explosion of crackers in his trousers pockets.      \"I've taken a turn at reading hard, which may astonish you.  The    doctor told me, if I really thought of some day arraying my manly form    in a scarlet jacket and wearing a sword, I ought to put it on with my    mathematics, which are not my _forte_, you know.  So now I'm drawing    circles and triangles at every available moment, and my logarithm    tables are thumbed almost to death.  Don't imagine _you're_ the only    burner of midnight oil.      \"I had a letter from home to-day.  They were saying they hadn't seen    you lately.  I hope you'll go up when you can; it would be a charity    to the dear old folk; besides, they are very fond of you--queer taste!    How's the ticker?  Give it a cuff from me for not reminding you to    write the last two weeks.      The repeater goes on all serene.  It has already gained some    notoriety, as I was publicly requested, before the whole Fifth, the    other day, to abstain from evoking its musical talents in the course    of the Latin prose lesson.  Now I must shut up.  Seriously, old man,    don't overwork yourself, and don't bother to write unless you've time;    but you know how welcome your letters are to      \"Your affectionate chum,      \"C.N.\"    Of course Tom sat down and answered this letter at once, much  reproaching himself for his past neglect.    With the vision of Charlie before his eyes, and with the sound of his  voice again in his ears, all his old resolutions and impulses returned  that morning.  He worked hard, and flung the trashy novel, over which he  had been wasting his time the day before, into the fire; he went off to  lectures with something like his old eagerness, and discharged his  duties in the wards with interest and thoroughness; he refused to allow  his mind to be distracted by the proceedings of his fellow-students, and  he resolved to spend that very evening at Mr Newcome's.    Tom Drift would probably have laughed at the idea that this sudden  change was due entirely to Charlie's letter.  To him it seemed like a  spontaneous reassertion of its natural self by his mind, and a matter  for such self-congratulation and satisfaction, that it at once covered  the multitude of past omissions.    Indeed, Tom felt very virtuous as he returned that afternoon to his  lodgings; and so felt no need to look away from self to Him who alone  can keep us from falling.    He read Charlie's letter over again, and smiled at the idea of _his_  getting up mathematics in his spare time.    \"He's not the sort of fellow to stick to work of that sort,\" said Tom to  himself, secretly comparing his own remarkable powers of application  with those of his Randlebury friend.    Then he sat down, and more than ever admiring and wondering at his own  greediness for hard work, read till it was time to start for Mr  Newcome's.    It was a good long way, but being a fine evening, Tom determined to  walk.  He felt that after his work the fresh air would do him good, and  besides, as he was in plenty of time, he could indulge himself in that  very cheap and harmless luxury, an inspection of the shop windows as he  went along.  He therefore selected a longer and more crowded route than  perhaps he need have done, and certainly, as far as the shops went, was  rewarded for his pains.    However, Tom seemed to me to have as much interest in watching the  people who passed to and fro as in the shops.  He amused himself by  wondering where this one was going and what that one"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/21036"],[0,"My Friend Smith: A Story of School and City Life (#16)"],[1,"  My first sensations were selfish, and as I curled myself up in bed,  with his note fast in my hand, I felt utterly wretched, to know that my  only friend, the only comfort I had at Stonebridge House, had been taken  away.  What should I do without him?    Expelled!  Where had he gone to, then?  Packworth, I knew, was a large  town about ten miles from Brownstroke, where my uncle now and then went  on business.  Did Jack live there, then?  And if he did, why had he  never told me?  At any rate, I could get over and see him in the  holidays.  \"Write to me.\"  How was that possible here? unless, indeed--  unless I could smuggle the letter into the post.  Poor Jack expelled!  Why should he be expelled more than any of us, except Hawkesbury?  What  a fury he had been in with Hawkesbury that very morning!  Certainly  Hawkesbury was aggravating.  Strange that my friend Smith and  Hawkesbury--that my friend Jack--that Jack and Hawk--    And here, in a piteous muddle of mind and spirit, I fell asleep.    I remained another year at Stonebridge House after Jack Smith had been  expelled.  We did not get a single holiday during that period, so that  my scheme of walking over from Brownstroke, and finding him out at  Packworth, never came off.  And I only contrived to write to him once.  That was the first time, the Sunday after he had left, when the Henniker  saw me dropping my letter into the post.  After that I was closely  watched, and I need hardly say, if Jack ever wrote to me, I never got  his letter.  Still I cherished the memory of my friend, and even when  Stonebridge House was most desolate, found some consolation in feeling  pretty sure I had a friend somewhere, which is more than every one can  say.    I made steady progress with my arithmetic and other studies during the  year, thanks to Mr Hashford, who, good fellow that he was, took special  pains with me, so that at the end of the year I was pronounced competent  to take a situation as an office-boy or junior clerk, or any like post  to which my amiable uncle might destine me.    I was not sorry to leave Stonebridge House, as you may guess.  During  the last year, certainly, things were better than they had been.  No  reference was made on any occasion, either in public or in private, to  the great rebellion of that summer.  The Henniker never quite got over  the shake she had had when we rose in arms against her, and Mr Ladislaw  appeared proportionately subdued, so on the whole things were rather  more tolerable.  And for lack of my lost friend, I managed to improve  the acquaintance of the good-natured Flanagan, besides retaining the  favour of the smiling Hawkesbury.    So passed another year, at the end of which I found myself a wiser and a  sadder boy, with my back turned at length on Stonebridge House, and my  face towards the wide, wide world.        CHAPTER NINE.    HOW I REPLIED TO AN ADVERTISEMENT AND WAITED FOR THE ANSWER.    The day that witnessed my departure from Stonebridge House found me, I  am bound to confess, very little improved by my year or two's residence  under that dull roof.  I do not blame it all on the school, or even on  Miss Henniker, depressing as both were.    There is no reason why, even at a school for backward and troublesome  boys, a fellow shouldn't improve, if he gave his mind to it.  But that  is just where I failed.  I didn't give my mind to it.  In fact, I made  up my mind it was no use trying to improve, and therefore didn't try.  The consequence was, that after Jack Smith left, I cast in my lot with  the rest of the backward and troublesome boys, and lost all ambition to  be much better than the rest of them.    Flanagan, the fellow I liked best, was always good-humoured and lively,  but I'm not sure that he would have been called a boy of good  principles.  At any rate, he never professed to be particularly  ambitious in any such way, and in that respect was very different from  Hawkesbury, who, by the time he left Stonebridge House, six months  before me, to go to a big public school, had quite impressed me with the  worth of his character.    But this is a digression.  As I was saying, I left Stonebridge House a  good deal wilder, and more rackety, and more sophisticated, than I had  entered it two years before.  However, I left it also with considerably  more knowledge of addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division;  and that in my uncle's eye appeared to be of far more moment than my  moral condition.    \"Fred,\" he said to me the day after I had got home, and after I had  returned from a triumphant march through Brownstroke, to show myself off  to my old comrades generally, and Cad Prog in particular--\"Fred,\" said  my uncle, \"I am going to send you to London.\"    \"To London!\" cried I, not knowing exactly whether to be delighted, or  astonished, or alarmed, or all three--\"to London.\"    \"Yes.  You must get a situation, and do something to earn your living.\"    I ruminated over this announcement, and my uncle continued, \"You are old  enough to provide for yourself, and I expect you to do so.\"    There was a pause, at the end of which, for lack of any better remark, I  said, \"Yes.\"    \"The sooner you start the better,\" continued my uncle.  \"I have marked a  few advertisements in that pile of newspapers,\" added he, pointing to a  dozen or so of papers on his table.  \"You had better take them and look  through them, and tell me if you see anything that would suit you.\"    Whereat my uncle resumed his writing, and I, with the papers in my arms,  walked off in rather a muddled state of mind to my bedroom.    Half way up stairs a sudden thought occurred to me, which caused me to  drop my burden and hurry back to my uncle's room.    \"Uncle, do you know the Smiths of Packworth?\"    My uncle looked up crossly.    \"Haven't you learned more sense at school, sir, than that?  Don't you  know there are hundreds of Smiths at Packworth?\"    This was a crusher.  I meekly departed, and picking up my papers where I  had dropped them, completed the journey to my room.    It had been a cherished idea of mine, the first day I got home to make  inquiries about my friend Smith.  It had never occurred to me before  that Smith was such a very common name; but it now dawned slowly on me  that to find a Smith in Packworth would be about as simple as to find a  needle in a bottle of hay.    Anyhow, I could write to him now without fear--that was a comfort.  So I  turned to my newspapers and began to read through a few of the  advertisements my uncle had considerately marked.    The result was not absolutely exhilarating.  My uncle evidently was not  ambitious on my account.    \"Sharp lad wanted to look after a shop.\"  That was the first I caught  sight of.  And the next was equally promising.    \"Page wanted by a professional gentleman.  Must be clean, well-behaved,  and make himself useful in house.  Attend to boots, coals, windows,  etcetera.  Good character indispensable.\"    I was almost grateful to feel that no one could give me a good character  by any stretch of imagination, so that at any rate I was safe from this  fastidious professional gentleman.  Then came another:    \"News-boy wanted.  Must have good voice.  Apply Clerk, Great Central  Railway Station.\"    Even this did not tempt me.  It might be a noble sphere of life to  strive to make my voice heard above a dozen shrieking engines all day  long, but I didn't quite fancy the idea.    In fact, as I read on and on, I became more and more convinced that my  splendid talents would be simply wasted in London.  Nothing my uncle had  marked tempted me.  A \"muffin boy's\" work might be pleasant for a week,  till the noise of the bell had lost its novelty; a \"boy to learn the art  of making button-holes in braces\" might perhaps be a promising opening;  and a printer's boy might be all very well, but they none of them  accorded with my own ideas, still less with my opinion of my own value.    I was getting rather hopeless, and wondering what on earth I should say  to my uncle, when the brilliant idea occurred to me of looking at some  of the other advertisements which my uncle hadn't marked.  Some of these  were most tempting.    \"A junior partner wanted in an old-established firm whose profits are  L10,000 a year.  Must bring L15,000 capital into the concern.\"    There!  If I only had L15,000, my fortune would be made at once!    \"Wanted a companion for a nobleman's son about to travel abroad.\"    There again, why shouldn't I try for that?  What could a nobleman's son  require more in a companion than was to be found in me?    And so I travelled on, beginning at the top of the ladder and sliding  gently down, gradually losing not only the hope of finding a situation  to suit me, but also relinquishing my previous strong faith in my own  wonderful merits.  I was ready to give it up as a bad job, and go and  tell my uncle I must decline all his kind suggestions, when, in an  obscure corner of one paper, my eye caught the following:    \"Junior clerkship.  An intelligent lad, respectable, and quick at  figures, wanted in a merchant's office.  Wages 8 shillings a week to  commence.  Apply by letter to Merrett, Barnacle, and Company, Hawk  Street, London.\"    I jumped up as if I had been shot, and rushed headlong with the paper to  my uncle's study.    \"Look at this, uncle!  This will do, I say!  Read it, please.\"    My uncle read it gravely, and then pushed the paper from him.    \"Absurd.  You would not do at all.  That is not one of those I marked,  is it?\"    \"No.  But they were all awful.  I say, uncle, let's try for this.\"    My uncle stared at me, and I looked anxiously at my uncle.    \"Fred,\" said he sternly, \"I'm sorry to see you making a fool of  yourself.  However, it's your affair, not mine.\"    \"But, uncle, I'm pretty quick at figures,\" said I.    \"And intelligent and respectable too, I suppose?\" added my uncle,  looking at me over his glasses.  \"Well, do as you"]]]
