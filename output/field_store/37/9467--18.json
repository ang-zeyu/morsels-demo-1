No. 227. ICELAND-MOSS JELLY.    Boil four ounces of Iceland moss in one quart of water very slowly for  one hour, then add the juice of two lemons and a bit of rind, four  ounces of sugar, and a gill of sherry; boil up, and remove the scum from  the surface; strain the jelly through a muslin bag into a basin, and set  it aside to become cold; in which state it may be eaten, but it is far  more efficacious in its beneficial results when taken warm. The use of  Iceland moss jelly is strongly recommended in cases of consumption, and  in the treatment of severe colds, catarrhs, and all phlegmatic diseases  of the chest.      No. 228. ANTISPASMODIC TEA.    Infuse two-pennyworth of hay saffron (sold at all chemists') in a gill  of boiling water in a tea-cup for ten minutes; add a dessert-spoonful of  brandy, and sugar to sweeten, and drink the tea hot. This powerful yet  harmless remedy will quickly relieve you from spasmodic pains occasioned  by indigestion.      No. 229. DANDELION TEA.    Infuse one ounce of dandelion in a jug with a pint of boiling water for  fifteen minutes; sweeten with brown sugar or honey, and drink several  tea-cupfuls during the day. The use of this tea is recommended as a safe  remedy in all bilious affections; it is also an excellent beverage for  persons afflicted with dropsy.      No. 230.

A CURE FOR SPRAINS.    Bruise thoroughly a handful of sage-leaves, and boil them in a gill of  vinegar for ten minutes, or until reduced to half the original quantity;  apply this in a folded rag to the part affected, and tie it on securely  with a bandage.

HOW TO MAKE COFFEE.    Mix one ounce of ground coffee in a clean pot with a pint of cold water,  stir this on the fire till it boils, then throw in a very little more  cold water, and after allowing the coffee to boil up twice more, set it  aside to settle, and become clear and bright. The dregs saved from twice  making, added to half the quantity of fresh coffee, will do for the  children. It is best to make your coffee over-night, as it has then  plenty of time to settle. If, as I recommend, you grind your coffee at  home, you will find Nye's machines very good.      No. 238. HOW TO PREPARE COCOA NIBS.    Boil gently two ounces of cocoa nibs in three pints of water for two  hours and a-half, without allowing it to reduce more than one-third;  that is, the three pints should be boiled down to one quart. When  sufficiently boiled, strain the cocoa from the nibs, mix it with equal  proportions of milk, and sweeten with sugar. Two ounces of cocoa nibs  cost a penny three-farthings, one quart of skim milk twopence (in the  country one penny), two ounces of moist sugar three-farthings; thus, for  about fourpence halfpenny, you may prepare sufficient cocoa for the  breakfasts of four persons. This would be much wholesomer and cheaper  than tea. To be sure, it would take some trouble and care to prepare it,  and this should be attended to over-night.          ECONOMICAL AND SUBSTANTIAL SOUP FOR DISTRIBUTION TO THE POOR.      I am well aware, from my own experience, that the charitable custom of  distributing wholesome and nutritious soup to poor families living in  the immediate neighbourhood of noblemen and gentlemen's mansions in the  country, already exists to a great extent; yet, it is certainly  desirable that this excellent practice should become more generally  adopted, especially during the winter months, when their scanty means of  subsistence but insufficiently yield them food adequate in quantity to  sustain the powers of life in a condition equal to their hard labour. To  afford the industrious well-deserving poor a little assistance in this  way, would call forth their gratitude to the givers, and confer a  blessing on the needy. The want of knowing how to properly prepare the  kind of soup best adapted to the purpose has, no doubt, in a great  measure, militated against its being more generally bestowed throughout  the kingdom; and it is in order to supply that deficient knowledge, that  I have determined on giving easy instructions for its preparation.      No. 239. HOW TO PREPARE A LARGE QUANTITY OF GOOD SOUP FOR THE POOR.    It is customary with most large families, while living in the country,  to kill at least some portion of the meat consumed in their households;  and without supposing for a moment that any portion of this is ever  wasted, I may be allowed to suggest that certain parts, such as sheep's  heads, plucks, shanks, and scrag-ends, might very well be spared towards  making a good mess of soup for the poor. The bones left from cooked  joints, first baked in a brisk oven for a quarter of an hour, and  afterwards boiled in a large copper of water for six hours, would  readily prepare a gelatinized foundation broth for the soup; the bones,  when sufficiently boiled, to be taken out. And thus, supposing that your  copper is already part filled with the broth made from bones (all the  grease having been removed from the surface), add any meat you may have,  cut up in pieces of about four ounces weight, garnish plentifully with  carrots, celery, onions, some thyme, and ground allspice, well-soaked  split peas, barley, or rice; and, as the soup boils up, skim it well  occasionally, season moderately with salt, and after about four hours'  gentle and continuous boiling, the soup will be ready for distribution.  It was the custom in families where I have lived as cook, to allow a  pint of this soup, served out with the pieces of meat in it, to as many  as the recipients' families numbered; and the soup was made for  distribution twice every week during winter.      No. 240. ANOTHER METHOD FOR MAKING ECONOMICAL SOUP.    In households where large joints of salt beef, or pork, are cooked  almost daily for the family, the liquor in which they have been boiled  should be saved, all grease removed therefrom, and put into the copper  with a plentiful supply of carrots, parsnips, celery, and onions, all  cut in small pieces, the whole boiled and well skimmed till the  vegetables are done; the soup is then to be thickened with either  oatmeal, peasemeal, or Indian corn meal, seasoned with pepper and ground  allspice, and stirred continuously until it boils up again; it must then  be skimmed, and the best pieces of meat selected from the stock-pot  should be kept in careful reserve, to be added to the soup, and allowed  to boil therein for half an hour longer.      No. 241. HOW TO MAKE FISH SOUP IN LARGE QUANTITIES FOR DISTRIBUTION TO  THE POOR.    This kind of soup, it will be easily understood, is applicable only on  the sea-coast, and wherever fish is to be had very cheap. Chop fine a  dozen onions, some thyme, and winter savory, and put these into a  copper, or some large pot, with about six gallons of water, one pound of  butter, pepper and salt enough to season; allow the whole to boil for  ten minutes, then thicken the broth with about four pounds of oatmeal,  peasemeal, or flour; stir the soup continuously until it boils, and then  throw in about fifteen pounds of fish cut up in one-pound size pieces,  and also some chopped parsley; boil all together until the fish is done,  and then serve out the soup to the recipients. All kinds of fish, except  sprats, herrings, and pilchards, are equally well adapted for making  fish soup, but codfish, cod's heads, skate, eels, etc., and all  glutinous fish, suit the purpose best.

A  most beautiful palace in European architecture of good taste faced the  garden.    I was admitted into a spacious drawing-room, furnished in good European  style, where Meftah-es-Sultaneh--a rotund and jovial gentleman--greeted  me with effusion. Although he had never been out of Persia, he spoke  French, with a most perfect accent, as fluently as a Frenchman.    What particularly struck me in him, and, later, in many other of the  younger generation of the upper classes in Persia, was the happy mixture  of the utmost charm of manner with a keen business head, delightful tact  and no mean sense of humour. Meftah-es-Sultaneh, for instance, spoke most  interestingly for over an hour, and I was agreeably surprised to find  what an excellent foreign education students can receive without leaving  Persia. It is true that Meftah is an exceptionally clever man, who would  make his mark anywhere; still it was nevertheless remarkable how well  informed he was on matters not concerning his country.    He comes from a good stock. His father, Meftah-el-Mulk, was Minister  member of the Council of State, a very wealthy man, who devoted much of  his time and money to doing good to his country. Among the many  praiseworthy institutions founded and entirely supported by him was the  college for orphans, the Dabetsane Daneshe, and the Eftetahie School. The  colleges occupy beautiful premises, and first-rate teachers are provided  who instruct their pupils in sensible, useful matters. The boys are well  fed and clothed and are made quite happy in every way.    Meftah told me that His Excellency the Minister of Foreign Affairs wished  to see me, so it was arranged that I should drive to Tejerish the next  morning to the Minister's country residence.    As early as five a.m. the following day I was digging in my trunks in  search of my frock-coat, the only masculine attire in Persia that is  considered decent, and without which no respectable man likes to be seen.  Then for the tall hat; and with the temperature no less than 98 deg. in the  shade I started in an open victoria to drive the nine miles or so to the  appointment.    Not being a Persian myself, and not quite sharing the same ideas of  propriety, I felt rather ridiculous in my get-up, driving across the  sunny, dusty and barren country until we reached the hills. I had to keep  my feet under the seat of the carriage, for when the sun's rays  (thermometer above 125 deg.) struck my best patent-leather shoes, the heat  was well-nigh intolerable.    At last, after going slowly up-hill through winding lanes enclosed in mud  walls, and along dry ditches with desiccated trees on either side, we  arrived at the _Campagne de Tejerish_, and pulled up in front of a big  gate, at the residence of the Minister.    The trials of the long drive had been great. With the black frock-coat  white with dust, my feet absolutely broiled in the patent shoes, and the  perspiration streaming down my forehead and cheeks, I really could not  help laughing at the absurdity of civilised, or semi-civilised fashions,  and at the purposeless suffering inflicted by them.    There were a number of soldiers at the gate with clothes undone--they  were practical people--and rusty muskets resting idle on a rack.    \"Is Meftah-es-Sultaneh here?\" I inquired.    \"Yes, he is waiting for you,\" answered a soldier as he sprang to his  feet. He hurriedly buttoned up his coat and hitched his belt, and,  seizing a rifle, made a military salute in the most approved style.    An attendant led me along a well-shaded avenue to the house, and here I  was ushered into a room where, round tables covered with green cloth, sat  a great many officials. All these men wore pleated frock-coats of all  tints and gradations of the colours of the rainbow. One and all rose and  politely saluted me before I sat down.    Through the passage one could see another room in which a number of other  officials, similarly clad and with black astrakan caps, were opening and  sorting out correspondence.    Suddenly there was a hurried exit of all present--very much like a  stampede. Up the avenue a stately, tall figure, garbed in a whitish  frock-coat over which a long loose brown coat was donned, walked slowly  and ponderously with a crowd of underlings flitting around--like  mosquitoes round a brilliant light. It was Mushir-ed-Doulet, the Minister  of Foreign Affairs. He turned round, now to one, then to another  official, smiling occasionally and bowing gracefully, then glancing  fiercely at another and sternly answering a third.    [Illustration: H. E. Mushir-ed-Doulet, Minister of Foreign Affairs.]    I was rather impressed by the remarkable facility with which he could  switch on extreme courteousness and severity, kindliness and contempt.  His face was at no time, mind you, subjected to very marked exaggerated  changes or grimaces, such as those by which we generally expect emotions  to show themselves among ourselves, but the changes in his expression,  though slight, were quite distinct and so expressive that there was no  mistake as to their meaning. A soft look of compassion; a hard glance of  offended dignity; the veiled eyes deeply absorbed in reflection; the  sudden sparkle in them at news of success, were plainly visible on his  features, as a clerk approached him bringing correspondence, or asking  his opinion, or reporting on one matter or another.    A considerable amount of the less important business was disposed of in  this fashion, as the Minister strode up the avenue to the Foreign Office  building, and more still with two or three of the more important  personages who escorted him to his tents some little way from the avenue.    Meftah-es-Sultaneh, who had disappeared with the Minister, hurriedly  returned and requested me to follow him. On a sofa under a huge tent, sat  Mushir-ed-Doulet, the Minister, who instantly rose and greeted me  effusively as I entered. He asked me to sit on his right on the sofa  while Meftah interpreted. His Excellency only spoke Persian. Cigarettes,  cigars, coffee and tea were immediately brought.    The Minister had a most intelligent head. As can be seen by the  photograph here reproduced, he might have passed for a European. He was  extremely dignified and business-like in his manner. His words were few  and much to the point.    Our interview was a pleasant one and I was able to learn much of interest  about the country. The Minister seemed to lay particular stress on the  friendly relations of Russia and England, and took particular care to  avoid comments on the more direct relations between Persia and Russia.    One point in our conversation which his Excellency seemed very anxious to  clear up was, what would be the future of China? He seemed keenly  interested in learning whether Russia's or England's influence had the  supremacy in the Heavenly Empire, and whether either of these nations was  actually feared by the Chinese.    \"Will the Chinese ever be able to fight England or Russia with success?  Were the Chinese well-armed during the war of 1900? If properly armed and  drilled, what chances had the Chinese army of winning against the Allies?  Would China be eventually absorbed and divided into two or more shares by  European powers, or would she be maintained as an Empire?\"    Although the Minister did not say so himself, I could not help suspecting  that in his mind the similarity and probably parallel futures of China  and Persia afforded ground for reflection.    There is no doubt that in many ways the two countries resemble one  another politically, although Persia, owing to her more important  geographical position, may have a first place in the race of European  greed.    The interest displayed by Persians of all classes in the Chinese war of  1900 was intense, and, curiously enough, the feeling seemed to prevail  that China had actually won the war because the Allies had retreated,  leaving the capital and the country in the hands of the Chinese.    \"More than in our actual strength,\" said a Persian official once to me,  \"our safety lies in the rivalry of Great Britain and Russia, between  which we are wedged. Let those two nations be friends and we are done  for!\"    After my visit to the Minister of Foreign Affairs I had the pleasure of  meeting the Prime Minister, the Minister of War, and the Minister of  Public Works. I found them all extremely interesting and courteous and  well up in their work. But although talent is not lacking in Persia  among statesmen, the country itself, as it is to-day, does not give these  men an opportunity of shining as brightly as they might. The whole  country is in such a decayed condition that it needs a thorough  overhauling. Then only it might be converted into quite a formidable  country. It possesses all the necessary requirements to be a first-class  nation. Talent in exuberance, physical strength, a convenient  geographical position, a good climate, considerable mineral and some  agricultural resources, are all to be found in Persia. All that is wanted  at present is the development of the country on a solid, reliable basis,  instead of the insecure, unsteady intrigues upon which business, whether  political or commercial, is unfortunately carried on in the present state  of affairs.    No one realises this better than the well-to-do Persian, and nothing  would be more welcome to him than radical reform on the part of the Shah,  and the establishment of the land of Iran on unshakable foundations. With  a national debt so ridiculously small as Persia has at present, there is  no reason why, with less maladministration, with her industries pushed,  with her army reorganised and placed on a serviceable footing, she should  not rank"]]]
