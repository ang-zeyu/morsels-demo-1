These frescos, painted with  an intrepid and learned mediocrity, display the commonplace tones,  swelling muscles and anatomical tricks in use at that epoch among  artists.    We have already called attention to the fact that colossal dimensions  are not at all necessary to produce effect in architecture. The Loggia  de Lanzi, that gem of the Place of the Grand Duke, consists of a portico  composed of four arcades, three on the facade, one in return on the  gallery of the offices. It is a miniature of a monument; but the harmony  of its proportions is so perfect that the eye in contemplating it  experiences a sense of satisfaction. The nearness of the Palace of the  Seigneurie, with its compact mass, admirably sets off the elegant  slenderness of its arches and columns. The Loggia is a species of Museum  in the open air. The \"Perseus\" of Benvenuto Cellini, the \"Judith\" of  Donatello, the \"Rape of the Sabines\" of John of Bologna, are framed in  the arcades. Six antique statues--the cardinal and monastic virtues--by  Jacques, called Pietro, a Madonna by Orgagna adorn the interior wall.  Two lions, one antique, the other modern, by Vacca, almost as good as  the Greek lions of the arsenal at Venice, complete the decoration.    The Perseus may be regarded as the masterpiece of Benvenuto Cellini, an  artist so highly spoken of in France, without scarcely anything being  known about him. This statue, a little affected in its pose, like all  the works of the Florentine school, has a juvenile grace which is very  attractive.          THE ORIGINS OF THE CITY[29]    BY GRANT ALLEN      Only two considerable rivers flow from the Apennines westward into the  Mediterranean. The Tiber makes Rome; the Arno makes Florence. In  prehistoric and early historic times, the mountainous region which forms  the basin of these two rivers was occupied by a gifted military race,  the Etruscans, who possest a singular assimilative power for Oriental  and Hellenic culture. Intellectually and artistically, they were the  pick of Italy. Their blood still runs in the veins of the people of  Tuscany. Almost every great thing done in the Peninsula, in ancient or  modern times, has been done by Etruscan hands or brains. The poets and  painters, in particular, with few exceptions, have been, in the wide  ethnical sense, Tuscans.    The towns of ancient Etruria were hill-top strongholds. Florence was not  one of these; even its neighbor, Fiesole (Faesulue), did not rank among  the twelve great cities of the Etruscan league. But with the Roman  conquest and the Roman peace, the towns began to descend from their  mountain peaks into the river valleys; roads grew important, through  internal trade; and bridges over rivers assumed a fresh commercial  value. Florence (Florentia), probably founded under Sulla as a Roman  municipium, upon a Roman road, guarded the bridge across the Arno, and  gradually absorbed the population of Fiesole. Under the later empire,  it was the official residence of the \"Corrector\" of Tuscany and Umbria.  During the Middle Ages, it became, for all practical purposes, the  intellectual and artistic capital of Tuscany, inheriting in full the  remarkable mental and esthetic excellences of the Etruscan race.    The valley of the Arno is rich and fertile, bordered by cultivable  hills, which produce the famous Chianti wine. It was thus predestined by  nature as the seat of the second city on the west slope of Italy.  Florence, however, was not always that city. The seaport of Pisa (now  silted up and superseded by Leghorn) first rose into importance; possest  a powerful fleet; made foreign conquests; and erected the magnificent  group of buildings just outside the town which still form its chief  claim upon the attention of tourists. But Florence with its bridge  commanded the inland trade, and the road to Rome from Germany. After the  destruction of Fiesole in 1125, it grew rapidly in importance; and, Pisa  having sustained severe defeats from Genoa, the inland town soon rose to  supremacy in the Arno basin. Nominally subject to the Emperor, it became  practically an independent republic, much agitated by internal quarrels,  but capable of holding its own against neighboring cities. Its chief  buildings are thus an age or two later than those of Pisa; it did not  begin to produce splendid churches and palaces, in emulation of those of  Pisa and Siena, till about the close of the 13th century. To the same  period belongs the rise of its literature under Dante, and its painting  under Giotto. This epoch of rapid commercial, military, and artistic  development forms the main glory of early Florence.    The 14th century is chiefly interesting at Florence as the period of  Giottesque art, finding its final crown in Fra Angelico. With the  beginning of the 15th, we get the dawn of the Renaissance--the age when  art set out once more to recover the lost perfection of antique  workmanship. In literature, this movement took the form of humanism; in  architecture and sculpture, it exhibited itself in the persons of  Alberti, Ghiberti, Della Robbia, and Donatello; in painting, it showed  itself in Lippi, Botticelli, Ghirlandajo, and Verrocchio....    We start, then, with the fact that up to nearly the close of the 13th  century (1278), Florence was a comparatively small and uninteresting  town, without any buildings of importance, save the relatively  insignificant Baptistery; without any great cathedral, like Pisa and  Siena; without any splendid artistic achievement of any kind. It  consisted at that period of a labyrinth of narrow streets, enclosing  huddled houses and tall towers of the nobles, like the two to be seen to  this day at Bologna. In general aspect, it could not greatly have  differed from Albenga or San Gimignano in our own time. But commerce was  active; wealth was increasing; and the population was seething with the  intellectual and artistic spirit of its Etruscan ancestry. During the  lifetime of Dante, the town began to transform itself and to prepare for  becoming the glorious Florence of the Renaissance artists. It then set  about building two immense and beautiful churches--Santa Croce and  Santa Maria Novella--while, shortly after, it grew to be ashamed of its  tiny San Giovanni (the existing Baptistery), and girded itself up to  raise a superb cathedral, which should cast into the shade both the one  long since finished at maritime Pisa and the one then still rising to  completion on the height of Siena.    Florence at that time extended no further than the area known as Old  Florence, which means from the Ponte Vecchio to the Cathedral in one  direction, and from the Ponte alla Carraja to the Grazie in the other.  Outside the wall lay a belt of fields and gardens, in which one or two  monasteries had already sprung up. But Italy at that moment was filled  with religious enthusiasm by the advent of the Friars both great orders  of whom, the Franciscans and the Dominicans, had already established  themselves in the rising commercial city of Florence. Both orders had  acquired sites for monastic buildings in the space outside the walls and  soon began to erect enormous churches. The Dominicans came first, with  Santa Maria Novella, the commencement of which dates from 1278; the  Franciscans were a little later in the field, with Santa Croce, the  first stone not being placed till 1294.          THE CATHEDRAL[30]    BY HIPPOLYTE ADOLPHE TAINE      Desirous of seeing the beginnings of this Renaissance we go from the  Palazzo-Vecchio to the Duomo. Both form the double heart of Florence,  such as it beat in the Middle Ages, the former for politics, and the  latter for religion, and the two so well united that they formed but  one. Nothing can be nobler than the public edict passed in 1294 for the  construction of the national cathedral.    \"Whereas, it being of sovereign prudence on the part of a people of high  origin to proceed in its affairs in such a manner that the wisdom no  less than the magnanimity of its proceedings can be recognized in its  outward works, it is ordered that Arnolfo, master architect of our  commune, prepare models or designs for the restoration of Santa Maria  Reparata, with the most exalted and most prodigal magnificence, in order  that the industry and power of men may never create or undertake  anything whatsoever more vast and more beautiful; in accordance with  that which our wisest citizens have declared and counselled in public  session and in secret conclave, to wit, that no hand be laid upon the  works of the commune without the intent of making them to correspond to  the noble soul which is composed of the souls of all its citizens united  in one will.\"      [FLORENCE: BRIDGE ACROSS THE ARNO  Illustration: Courtesy John C.

The story goes that Wiltcher the  First, who took great pride in his table, found it during one winter  time almost impossible to give anything else as dessert beyond apples,  oranges, pears, and nuts, there being no other fruit on the market. One  day some diners rudely complained, and insisted on a change, expecting  perhaps that pineapple should be included in a dinner at this price.  \"You wish a change in the dessert, I hear,\" said Mr. Wiltcher, in the  suave and courtly manner which had earned for him the sobriquet of \"the  Duke\"; \"Very well, to-morrow you shall have a change.\" To-morrow, there  was no dessert upon the menu. When the reason for this was demanded, he  simply answered, \"You wanted a change, and you've got it. I shall give  no fruit in future.\" This has become a tradition. Notwithstanding, it is  a remarkable dinner, and there is usually a good variety of sweets. As a  tip to people who want to drink champagne and are sometimes deterred by  the high prices demanded for well-known brands, while being always  suspicious of the sugary _tisanes_ supplied on the Continent, I may  mention that the champagne wines bearing Mr. Wiltcher's own name and  labelled according to taste as Dry Royal and Grand Cremant respectively,  are specially bottled for his establishment at Rheims; and, though the  price is little more than half that charged for _les grandes marques_,  they will be found pure, wholesome, and to the English and American  taste. Wiltcher's is rapidly becoming essentially an American house.    Justine's is a little fish restaurant on the Quai au Bois a Bruler, by  the side of the fish market. It has distinctly a bourgeois character. It  is not the sort of place you would choose to take a lady in her summer  frocks to, but you get a fine fish dinner there nevertheless. There is  no restaurant in the world where _moules a la mariniere_ are served in  such perfection, and you can rely on every bit of fish supplied there  being fresh. The exterior is unattractive, even dirty, and the service  inside is somewhat rough. On Fridays the place is always crowded, and  there may be a difficulty about retaining a room upstairs, where it is  best to go when you wish to be specially well served. In the old days,  it was the fashion to go on Fridays (or on any day for a fish lunch) to  Le Sabot, a _restaurant-estaminet_ of the same order a little lower down  on the quay, which has a reputation for its manner of cooking mussels;  but, since the death of old Francois, who kept it, the place does not  appear to be so much in favour, and the tide of custom now flows towards  Justine's. It must be remembered that this house is mentioned simply as  a feature of Brussels life and not as a representative restaurant.    L'Etoile, in the Rue des Harengs, is the most famous restaurant in  Brussels. In the time of Louis Dot, it certainly held rank as the first  of all, both for cooking and for wine, and Emile Ollivier, Dot's  successor, is doing his best to sustain the reputation. Neatly framed  and hung on one of the walls is still to be seen the card signed by the  late Henry Pettitt, the dramatist, attesting to the fact that he had  just eaten the best lunch of his life. This card some years later was  countersigned by a Lord Mayor of London; and a Lord Mayor surely should  be a good judge of a lunch. Whatever place is visited in Brussels,  L'Etoile should not be missed. The stranger should be very careful to go  in at the right door. The wines at L'Etoile have always been good, and  Dot used to have some Burgundy that was world-renowned. His _fine  champagne_ was also famous, and he had some extra-special for which he  used to charge 4 francs 50 centimes a glass. I have heard Dot himself  tell the story how a well-known _restaurateur_ from London came one  evening with two friends to see how things were done at L'Etoile. After  dinner they sent for Dot, to compliment him and ask him to join them  with a liqueur, and he was to give them some of his best brandy. They  smacked their lips on tasting it, and the glasses were filled a second  time; but the gentleman who paid the bill rather raised his eyebrows  when he saw the item, \"liqueurs, 36 francs.\" \"He got even with me,  however,\" said Dot, \"for when I went to London I returned his visit. I  had a good dinner (not so good, I think, as I should have served), and I  sent for him to join me with the coffee. While we chatted, I ordered  cigars, repeating his words, 'Give us some of your very best.' He did,  and he charged me 7s. 6d. a piece for them.\" The rooms at L'Etoile are  very small, and if any one wants to prove the establishment at its best,  he should take the precaution of retaining a table and ordering dinner  beforehand.    Le Belveder is in the Rue Chair et Pain; it has lately been opened by  Jules Letellier, _ex-maitre-d'hotel_ of the Filet de Sole and brother to  Adolph Letellier of the Lion d'Or. Here the restaurant is _a la carte_,  and a speciality is made of fish and game. Things are well done, and it  is a safe place to \"take on.\"    The Cafe Riche is opposite the Helder, and nearer to the Opera House. It  was founded in 1865 by Gautier, the nephew of Bignon of Paris, who  retains the proprietorship and management until the present time. It has  always had an aristocratic _clientele_, and is specially favoured by  Parisians visiting Brussels. During the political troubles in France the  Duc d'Orleans, Prince Victor Napoleon, and Henri Rochefort were all  patrons of the Cafe Riche, and it required all the tact and _savoir  faire_ of the proprietor to keep apart and at the same time give  satisfaction and pleasure to the conflicting parties. The Cafe Riche is  one of the best places in Brussels for a banquet or a large  dinner-party. Woodcock and snipe _a la Riche_ are specialities. Although  the prices are generally _a la carte_, one can have a lunch and dinner  at fixed price by ordering beforehand.    Duranton's, on the Avenue Louise, is now \"run\" by Monsieur Pierre  Strobbe, who took a first prize at the Brussels cookery exhibition. The  restaurant is pleasantly situated, and on Sunday, if you wish to go to  the races in the afternoon, it is very convenient, being on the direct  route to Boitsfort. There are three rooms on the ground floor, in which  you can lunch. That on the right, a small narrow room under the orders  of Charles, from the Black Forest, is the smartest. He will introduce  you to some special Kirsch--from the Black Forest. The cooking in all  the rooms is the same, and it is good. Order your cab to be at the door  half an hour before the first race.    The Laiterie is in the Bois de la Cambre. In summer time it is indeed  the most pleasant place to dine in Brussels. In the Bois there are  several places that supply lunches, dinners, and light refreshments, but  the Laiterie is the only one that is really first class. For seventeen  years it has been under the management of M. Artus and his son. The  establishment is the property of the town of Brussels, and is well kept  up in every respect. Here on a Sunday as many as 1500 chairs and 400  tables are often occupied. In the evenings the gardens are brilliantly  illuminated, there being 1100 gas lamps. Music is discoursed by a  Tzigane orchestra, and the late Queen of the Belgians, who often used to  stop her pony chaise at the Laiterie to hear them play, subscribed from  her private purse 200 francs every year to these musicians. Dinners are  served at separate tables, under Japanese umbrellas, and the cooking is  excellent; but it is as well to secure a seat as near to the main  building as possible, to overcome that objection to _al-fresco_  meals--cold dishes. The wines are good, and M. Artus has some fine  Ayala--'93, in magnums--unless it is all drunk by now. There must be  something about the cellars of these out-door places peculiarly  favourable to beer, for no pale ale in the world can compare with that  drawn at the bars of the Epsom grand-stand, and in Belgium there is no  bottled Bass so fresh and palatable as that which one gets at the  Laiterie.    If my friend were staying in Brussels longer than a week, the other  restaurants to which I might take him would be the Taverne Royale, at  the corner of the Galeries Saint Hubert, where some real 1865 cognac can  be had at 75 centimes the glass; the Freres Provencaux, in the Rue  Royale; the Restaurant de la Monnaie (a large place, generally noisy,  with not the most rapid of service); Stielen's, in the Rue de l'Eveque;  and the Taverne Restaurant des Eleveurs on the Avenue de la Toison d'Or.  At the Taverne de Londres, in the Rue de l'Ecuyer, there is always a  fine cut of cold roast beef with English pickles.    On Wednesdays all the Brussels restaurants are crowded, it being Bourse  day, and in a wide sense \"market\" day, when over 5000 strangers, mostly  men, come into the city from provincial towns. In conclusion, I may  mention that I have failed to discover the restaurant where George  Osborne gave his \"great dinner\" to the Bareacres a few days before the  battle of Waterloo. Thackeray records that as they came away from the  feast, Lord Bareacres asked to see the bill, and \"pronounced it a d----  bad dinner and d---- dear!\" Probably the place, therefore, is extinct;  for happily the double pronouncement can nowadays be seldom applied to  any of the restaurants mentioned in this chapter.
