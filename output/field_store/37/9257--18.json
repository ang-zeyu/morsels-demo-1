Give  me your hands, as when you brought me the story of little Lotte, which  Daddy Daae had told you.  I am very fond of you, M. Raoul, you know.  And so is Christine too!\"    \"She is fond of me!\" sighed the young man.  He found a difficulty in  collecting his thoughts and bringing them to bear on Mamma Valerius'  \"good genius,\" on the Angel of Music of whom Christine had spoken to  him so strangely, on the death's head which he had seen in a sort of  nightmare on the high altar at Perros and also on the Opera ghost,  whose fame had come to his ears one evening when he was standing behind  the scenes, within hearing of a group of scene-shifters who were  repeating the ghastly description which the hanged man, Joseph Buquet,  had given of the ghost before his mysterious death.    He asked in a low voice:  \"What makes you think that Christine is fond  of me, madame?\"    \"She used to speak of you every day.\"    \"Really? ... And what did she tell you?\"    \"She told me that you had made her a proposal!\"    And the good old lady began laughing wholeheartedly.  Raoul sprang from  his chair, flushing to the temples, suffering agonies.    \"What's this?  Where are you going?  Sit down again at once, will you?  ... Do you think I will let you go like that? ... If you're angry with  me for laughing, I beg your pardon... After all, what has happened  isn't your fault... Didn't you know? ... Did you think that Christine  was free? ...\"    \"Is Christine engaged to be married?\" the wretched Raoul asked, in a  choking voice.    \"Why no!  Why no! ... You know as well as I do that Christine couldn't  marry, even if she wanted to!\"    \"But I don't know anything about it! ... And why can't Christine marry?\"    \"Because of the Angel of Music, of course! ...\"    \"I don't follow ...\"    \"Yes, he forbids her to! ...\"    \"He forbids her! ... The Angel of Music forbids her to marry!\"    \"Oh, he forbids her ... without forbidding her.  It's like this: he  tells her that, if she got married, she would never hear him again.  That's all! ... And that he would go away for ever! ... So, you  understand, she can't let the Angel of Music go.  It's quite natural.\"    \"Yes, yes,\" echoed Raoul submissively, \"it's quite natural.\"    \"Besides, I thought Christine had told you all that, when she met you  at Perros, where she went with her good genius.\"    \"Oh, she went to Perros with her good genius, did she?\"    \"That is to say, he arranged to meet her down there, in Perros  churchyard, at Daae's grave.  He promised to play her The Resurrection  of Lazarus on her father's violin!\"    Raoul de Chagny rose and, with a very authoritative air, pronounced  these peremptory words:    \"Madame, you will have the goodness to tell me where that genius lives.\"    The old lady did not seem surprised at this indiscreet command.  She  raised her eyes and said:    \"In Heaven!\"    Such simplicity baffled him.  He did not know what to say in the  presence of this candid and perfect faith in a genius who came down  nightly from Heaven to haunt the dressing-rooms at the Opera.    He now realized the possible state of mind of a girl brought up between  a superstitious fiddler and a visionary old lady and he shuddered when  he thought of the consequences of it all.    \"Is Christine still a good girl?\" he asked suddenly, in spite of  himself.    \"I swear it, as I hope to be saved!\" exclaimed the old woman, who, this  time, seemed to be incensed.  \"And, if you doubt it, sir, I don't know  what you are here for!\"    Raoul tore at his gloves.    \"How long has she known this 'genius?'\"    \"About three months ...  Yes, it's quite three months since he began to  give her lessons.\"    The viscount threw up his arms with a gesture of despair.    \"The genius gives her lessons! ... And where, pray?\"    \"Now that she has gone away with him, I can't say; but, up to a  fortnight ago, it was in Christine's dressing-room. It would be  impossible in this little flat.  The whole house would hear them.  Whereas, at the Opera, at eight o'clock in the morning, there is no one  about, do you see!\"    \"Yes, I see!  I see!\" cried the viscount.    And he hurriedly took leave of Mme. Valerius, who asked herself if the  young nobleman was not a little off his head.    He walked home to his brother's house in a pitiful state.  He could  have struck himself, banged his head against the walls!  To think that  he had believed in her innocence, in her purity!  The Angel of Music!  He knew him now!  He saw him!  It was beyond a doubt some unspeakable  tenor, a good-looking jackanapes, who mouthed and simpered as he sang!  He thought himself as absurd and as wretched as could be.  Oh, what a  miserable, little, insignificant, silly young man was M. le Vicomte de  Chagny! thought Raoul, furiously.  And she, what a bold and damnable  sly creature!    His brother was waiting for him and Raoul fell into his arms, like a  child.  The count consoled him, without asking for explanations; and  Raoul would certainly have long hesitated before telling him the story  of the Angel of Music.  His brother suggested taking him out to dinner.  Overcome as he was with despair, Raoul would probably have refused any  invitation that evening, if the count had not, as an inducement, told  him that the lady of his thoughts had been seen, the night before, in  company of the other sex in the Bois.  At first, the viscount refused  to believe; but he received such exact details that he ceased  protesting.  She had been seen, it appeared, driving in a brougham,  with the window down.  She seemed to be slowly taking in the icy night  air.  There was a glorious moon shining.  She was recognized beyond a  doubt.  As for her companion, only his shadowy outline was  distinguished leaning back in the dark.  The carriage was going at a  walking pace in a lonely drive behind the grand stand at Longchamp.    Raoul dressed in frantic haste, prepared to forget his distress by  flinging himself, as people say, into \"the vortex of pleasure.\" Alas,  he was a very sorry guest and, leaving his brother early, found  himself, by ten o'clock in the evening, in a cab, behind the Longchamp  race-course.    It was bitterly cold.  The road seemed deserted and very bright under  the moonlight.  He told the driver to wait for him patiently at the  corner of a near turning and, hiding himself as well as he could, stood  stamping his feet to keep warm.  He had been indulging in this healthy  exercise for half an hour or so, when a carriage turned the corner of  the road and came quietly in his direction, at a walking pace.    As it approached, he saw that a woman was leaning her head from the  window.  And, suddenly, the moon shed a pale gleam over her features.    \"Christine!\"    The sacred name of his love had sprung from his heart and his lips.  He  could not keep it back... He would have given anything to withdraw it,  for that name, proclaimed in the stillness of the night, had acted as  though it were the preconcerted signal for a furious rush on the part  of the whole turn-out, which dashed past him before he could put into  execution his plan of leaping at the horses' heads.  The carriage  window had been closed and the girl's face had disappeared.  And the  brougham, behind which he was now running, was no more than a black  spot on the white road.    He called out again:  \"Christine!\"    No reply.  And he stopped in the midst of the silence.    With a lack-luster eye, he stared down that cold, desolate road and  into the pale, dead night.  Nothing was colder than his heart, nothing  half so dead:  he had loved an angel and now he despised a woman!    Raoul, how that little fairy of the North has trifled with you!  Was it  really, was it really necessary to have so fresh and young a face, a  forehead so shy and always ready to cover itself with the pink blush of  modesty in order to pass in the lonely night, in a carriage and pair,  accompanied by a mysterious lover?  Surely there should be some limit  to hypocrisy and lying! ...    She had passed without answering his cry ...  And he was thinking of  dying; and he was twenty years old! ...    His valet found him in the morning sitting on his bed.  He had not  undressed and the servant feared, at the sight of his face, that some  disaster had occurred.  Raoul snatched his letters from the man's  hands.  He had recognized Christine's paper and hand-writing. She said:    DEAR:    Go to the masked ball at the Opera on the night after to-morrow.  At  twelve o'clock, be in the little room behind the chimney-place of the  big crush-room. Stand near the door that leads to the Rotunda.  Don't  mention this appointment to any one on earth.  Wear a white domino and  be carefully masked.  As you love me, do not let yourself be  recognized.  CHRISTINE.        Chapter IX  At the Masked Ball      The envelope was covered with mud and unstamped.  It bore the words \"To  be handed to M. le Vicomte Raoul de Chagny,\" with the address in  pencil.  It must have been flung out in the hope that a passer-by would  pick up the note and deliver it, which was what happened.  The note had  been picked up on the pavement of the Place de l'Opera.    Raoul read it over again with fevered eyes.  No more was needed to  revive his hope.  The somber picture which he had for a moment imagined  of a Christine forgetting her duty to herself made way for his original  conception of an unfortunate, innocent child, the victim of imprudence  and exaggerated sensibility.  To what extent, at this time, was she  really a victim?  Whose prisoner was she?  Into what whirlpool had she  been dragged?  He asked himself these questions with a cruel anguish;  but even this pain seemed endurable beside the frenzy into which he was  thrown at the thought of a lying and deceitful Christine.  What had  happened?  What influence had she undergone?  What monster had carried  her off and by what means? "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/17530"],[0,"Maida's Little Shop (#16)"],[1,"he should not see that  she was trembling. She began to wish that she had followed Billy's  advice. Sitting in the shop all alone--Granny, it happened again, was  out--it occurred to her that it was, perhaps, too serious a situation  for a little girl to deal with.    She had made up her mind that when Arthur was in the shop, she would  not turn her back to him. She was determined not to give him the  chance to fall into temptation. But he asked for pencil-sharpeners  and pencil-sharpeners were kept in the lower drawer. There was  nothing for her to do but to get down on the floor. She remembered  with a sense of relief that she had left no stock out on the  counter. She knelt upright on the floor, seeking for the box.  Suddenly, reflected in the glass door, she saw another terrifying  picture.    _Arthur Duncan's arm was just closing the money drawer._    For an instant Maida felt so sick at heart that she wanted to run  back into the living-room, throw herself into Granny's big chair and  cry her eyes out. Then suddenly all this weakness went. A feeling,  such as she had never known, came into its place. She was still  angry but she was singularly cool. She felt no more afraid of Arthur  Duncan than of the bowl of dahlias, blooming on the counter.    She whirled around in a flash and looked him straight in the eye.    \"If there is anything in this shop that you want so much that you  are willing to steal, tell me what it is and I'll give it to you,\"  she said.    \"Aw, what are you talking about?\" Arthur demanded. He attempted to  out-stare her.    But Maida kept her eyes steadily on his. \"You know what I'm talking  about well enough,\" she said quietly. \"In the last week you've  stolen a rubber and a pencil and a blank-book from me and just now  you tried to take some money from the money-drawer.\"    Arthur sneered. \"How are you going to prove it?\" he asked  impudently.    Maida was thoroughly angry. But something inside warned her that she  must not give way to temper. For all her life, she had been  accustomed to think before she spoke. Indeed, she herself had never  been driven or scolded. Her father had always reasoned with her.  Doctors and nurses had always reasoned with her. Even Granny had  always reasoned with her. So, now, she thought very carefully before  she spoke again. But she kept her eyes fixed on Arthur. His eyes did  not move from hers but, in some curious way, she knew that he was  uneasy.    \"I can't prove it,\" she said at last, \"and I hadn't any idea of  trying to. I'm only warning you that you must not come in here if  you're not to be trusted. And I told you the truth when I said I  would rather give you anything in the shop than have you steal it.  For I think you must need those things very badly to be willing to  get them that way. I don't believe anybody _wants_ to steal. Now  when you want anything so bad as that, come to me and I'll see if I  can get it for you.\"    Arthur stared at her as if he had not a word on his tongue. \"If you  think you can frighten me,--\" he said. Then, without ending his  sentence, he swaggered out of the shop. But to Maida his swagger  seemed like something put on to conceal another feeling.    Maida suddenly felt very tired. She wished that Granny Flynn would  come back. She wanted Granny to take her into her lap, to cuddle  her, to tell her some merry little tale of the Irish fairies. But,  instead, the bell rang and another customer came in. While she was  waiting on her, Maida noticed somebody come stealthily up to the  window, look in and then duck down. She wondered if it might be  Billy playing one of his games on her.    The customer went out. In a few moments the bell tinkled again.  Maida had been leaning against the counter, her tired head on her  outstretched arms. She looked up. It was Arthur Duncan.    He strode straight over to her.    \"Here's three cents for your rubber,\" he said, \"and five for your  pencil, five for the blank book and there's two dimes I took out of  the money-drawer.\"    Maida did not know what to say. The tears came to her eyes and  rolled down her cheeks. Arthur shifted his weight from one foot to  the other in intense embarrassment.    \"I didn't know it would make you feel as bad as that,\" he said.    \"I don't feel bad,\" Maida sobbed--and to prove it she smiled while  the tears ran down her cheeks--\"I feel glad.\"    What he would have answered to this she never knew. For at that  moment the door flew open. The little rowdy boys who had been  troubling her so much lately, let out a series of blood-curdling  yells.    \"What's that?\" Arthur asked.    \"I don't know who they are,\" Maida said wearily, \"but they do that  three or four times every night. I don't know what to do about it.\"    \"Well, I do,\" Arthur said. \"You wait!\"    He went over to the door and waited, flattening himself against the  wall. After a long silence, they could hear footsteps tip-toeing on  the bricks outside. The door flew open. Arthur Duncan leaped like a  cat through the opening. There came back to Maida the sound of  running, then a pause, then another sound very much as if two or  three naughty little heads were being vigorously knocked together.  She heard Arthur say:    \"Let me catch one of you doing that again and I'll lick you till you  can't stand up. And remember I'll be watching for you every night  now.\"    Maida did not see him again then. But just before dinner the bell  rang. When Maida opened the door there stood Arthur.    \"I had this kitten and I thought you might like him,\" he said  awkwardly, holding out a little bundle of gray fluff.    \"Want it!\" Maida said. She seized it eagerly. \"Oh, thank you,  Arthur, ever so much. Oh, Granny, look at this darling kit-kat. What  a ball of fluff he is! I'll call him Fluff. And he isn't an Angora  or a prize kitty of any kind--just a beautiful plain everyday cat--the  kind I've always wanted!\"    Even this was not all. After dinner the shop bell rang again. This  time it was Arthur and Rosie. Rosie's lips were very tight as if she  had made up her mind to some bold deed but her flashing eyes showed  her excitement.    \"Can we see you alone for a moment, Maida?\" she asked in her most  business-like tones.    Wondering, Maida shut the door to the living-room and came back to  them.    \"Maida,\" Rosie began, \"Arthur told me all about the rubber and the  pencil and the blank book and the dimes. Of course, I felt pretty  bad when I heard about it. But I wanted Arthur to come right over  here and explain the whole thing to you. You see Arthur took those  things to give away to Dicky because Dicky has such a hard time  getting anything he wants.\"    \"Yes, I saw them over at Dicky's,\" Maida said.    \"And then, there was a great deal more to it that Arthur's just told  me and I thought you ought to know it at once. You see Arthur's  father belongs to a club that meets once a month and Arthur goes  there a lot with him. And those men think that plenty of people have  things that they have no right to--oh, like automobiles--I mean,  things that they haven't earned. And the men in Mr. Duncan's club  say that it's perfectly right to take things away from people who  have too much and give them to people who have too little. But I say  that may be all right for grown people but when children do it, it's  just plain _stealing_. And that's all there is to it! But I wanted  you to know that Arthur thought it was right--well sort of right, you  understand--when he took those things. You don't think so now, do  you, after the talking-to I've given you?\" She turned severely on  Arthur.    Arthur shuffled and looked embarrassed. \"No,\" he said sheepishly,  \"not until you're grown up.\"    \"But what I wanted to say next, Maida,\" Rosie continued, \"is, please  not to tell Dicky. He would be so surprised--and then he wouldn't  keep the things that Arthur gave him. And of course now that Arthur  has paid for them--they're all right for him to have.\"    \"Of course I wouldn't tell anybody,\" Maida said in a shocked voice,  \"not even Granny or Billy--not even my father.\"    \"Then that's settled,\" Rosie said with a sigh. \"Good night.\"    The next day the following note reached Maida:          You are cordully invited to join the W.M.N.T. Club which meets      three times a week at the house of Miss Rosie Brine, or Mr.      Richard Dore or Mr. Arthur Duncan.        P.S. The name means, WE MUST NEVER TELL.      Maida dreamed nothing but happy dreams that night.                                  CHAPTER VIII: A RAINY DAY      The next day it rained dismally. Maida had been running the shop for  three weeks but this was her first experience with stormy weather.  Because she, herself, had never been allowed to set her foot  outdoors when the weather was damp, she expected that she would see  no children that day. But long before the bell rang they crowded in  wet streaming groups into the shop. And at nine the lines  disappearing into the big school doorways seemed as long as ever.    Even the Clark twins in rubber boots, long rain-capes and a baby  umbrella came in to spend their daily pennies.    \"I guess it'll be one session, Maida,\" Dorothy whispered.    \"Oh goody, Dorothy!\" Mabel lisped. \"Don't you love one session,  Maida?\"    Maida was ashamed to confess to two such tiny girls that she did not  know what \"one session\" meant. But she puzzled over it the whole  morning. If Rosie and Arthur had come in she would have asked them.  But neither of them appeared. Indeed, they were not anywhere in the  lines--Maida looked very carefully.    At twelve o'clock the school bell did not ring. In surprise, Maida  craned out of the window to consult the big church clock. It agreed  exactly with the tall grandfather's clock in the living-room. Both  pointed to twelve, then to five minutes after and ten and  fifteen--still no bell.    A little later Dicky came swinging along, the sides of his old rusty  raincoat flapping like the"]]]
