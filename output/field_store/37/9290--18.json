When we say that we _will_ to do a certain thing, all we can mean is  that the _idea of this act_ is clearest and holds its focal place in  consciousness to the exclusion of other ideas. It therefore goes over  into action.    (2) The training just discussed may be called a general training of  attention giving us a general power and control over our lives, but  there is another type of training which is specific. As with the  machinist mentioned above, so with all of us; we attend to the type of  thing that we have formed a habit of attending to. Continued experience  in a certain field makes it more and more easy to attend to things in  that field. One can take a certain subject and work at it day after day,  year after year. By and by, the whole world takes on the aspect of this  chosen subject. The entomologist sees bugs everywhere, the botanist sees  only plants, the mechanic sees only machines, the preacher sees only the  moral and religious aspects of action, the doctor sees only disease, the  mathematician sees always the quantitative aspect of things. Ideas and  perceptions related to one's chosen work go at once and readily to the  focus of consciousness; other things escape notice.    It is for this reason that we become \"crankier\" every year that we live.  We are attending to only one aspect of the world. While this blinds us  to other aspects of the world, it brings mastery in our individual  fields. We can, then, by training and practice, get a general control  over attention, and by working in a certain field or kind of work, we  make it easy to attend to things in that field or work. This to an  extent gives us control of our lives, of our destiny.    =Interest.= The essential elements of interest are attention and feeling.  When a person is very attentive to a subject and gets pleasure from  experience in that subject, we commonly say that he is _interested_ in  that subject.    Since the importance of attention and feeling in learning has already  been shown and will be further developed in the chapters which follow in  connection with the subjects of habit, memory, and thinking, little more  need be said here.    The key to all forms of learning is _attention_. The key to attention is  _feeling_. Feeling depends upon the nature of the child, inherited and  acquired. In our search for the means of arousing interest, we look  first to the original nature of the child, to the instincts and the  emotions. We look next to the acquired nature, the habits, the ideals,  the various needs that have grown up in the individual's life.  Educational writers have overemphasized the original nature of the child  as a basis of interest and have not paid enough attention to acquired  nature. We should not ask so much what a child's needs are, but what  they _ought_ to be. Needs can be created. The child's nature to some  extent can be changed. The problem of arousing interest is therefore one  of finding in the child's nature a basis for attention and pleasure. If  the basis is not to be found there, then it must be built up. How this  can be done, how human nature can be changed, is to some extent the main  problem of psychology. Every chapter in this book, it is hoped, will be  found to throw some light on the problem.      SUMMARY. The two elementary feeling states are pleasantness and    unpleasantness. The emotions are complex mental states composed of    feeling and the sensations from bodily reactions to the situations.    Feeling and emotion are the motive forces of life, at the bottom of    all important actions. The bodily reactions of emotions are reflex    and instinctive. Attention is a matter of the relative clearness of    the contents of consciousness. The function of attention is to unify    thought and action. It is the important factor in all learning and    thinking, for it is only the attentive part of consciousness that is    effective.      CLASS EXERCISES    1. Make out a complete list of the more important emotions.    2. Indicate the characteristic expression of each emotion in your list.    3. Can you have an emotion without its characteristic expression? If,  for example, when a situation arises which ordinarily arouses anger in  you, you inhibit all the usual motor accompaniments of anger, are you  really angry?    4. Are the expressions of the same emotion the same for all people?    5. Try to analyze some of your emotional states: anger, or fear, or  grief. Can you detect the sensations that come from the bodily  reactions?    6. Try to induce an emotional state by producing its characteristic  reactions.    7. Try to change an emotional state to an opposite emotion; for example,  grief to joy.    8. Try to control and change emotional states in children.    9. Name some sensations that for you are always pleasant, others that  are always unpleasant--colors, sounds, tastes, odors, temperatures.    10. Confirm by observation the statement of the text as to the  importance of emotions in all the important actions of life.    11. To what extent do you have control of your emotional states? What  have you observed about differences in expression of deep emotions by  different people? In case of death in the family, some people wail and  moan and express their grief in the most extreme manner, while others do  not utter a sound and show great control. Why the difference?    12. Make an introspective study of your conscious states to note the  difference in clearness of the different processes that are going on in  consciousness. Do you find a constant shifting?    13. Perform experiments to show the effects of attention in forming  habits and acquiring knowledge.    (1) Perform tests in learning, using substitution tests as described in  Chapter X. Use several different keys. In some experiments have no  distractions, in others, have various distracting noises. What  differences do you find in the results?    (2) Try learning nonsense syllables, some lists with distractions,  others without distractions.    (3) Try getting the ideas from stories read to you, as in the logical  memory experiment described in Chapter X. Some stories should be read  without distractions, others with distractions.    14. Why are you unable to study well when under the influence of some  strong emotion?    15. Are you trained to the extent that you can concentrate on a task and  hold yourself to it for a long time?    16. Do you see that as far as will and attention and the emotions are  concerned, your life and character are in large measure in your own  hands?    17. Make a complete outline of the chapter.

CHAPTER VI    HABIT      =The Nature of Habit.= We now turn from man's inherited nature to his  acquired nature. Inherited tendencies to action we have called  instincts; acquired tendencies to action we shall call habits. We can  best form an idea of the nature of habit by considering some concrete  cases.    Let us take first the case of a man forming the habit of turning out the  basement light. It usually happens that when a man has an electric light  in the basement of his house, it is hard for him at first to think to  turn out the light at night when he retires, and as a consequence the  light often burns all night. This is expensive and unnecessary, so there  is a strong incentive for the man to find a plan which will insure the  regular turning-off of the light at bedtime. The plan usually hit upon  is the following: The electric switch that controls the basement light  is beside the basement stairway. The man learns to look at the switch as  he comes up the stairs, after preparing the furnace fire for the night,  and learns to take hold of the switch when he sees it and turn off the  light. Coming up the stairs means to look at the switch. Seeing the  switch means to turn it. Each step of the performance touches off the  next. The man sees that in order to make sure that the light will always  be turned off, the acts must all be made automatic, and each step must  touch off the next in the series. At first, the man leaves the light  burning about as often as he turns it off. After practicing for a time  on the scheme, the different acts become so well connected that he  seldom leaves the light burning. We say that he has formed the _habit_  of turning off the light.    For a second illustration, let us take the process of learning that nine  times nine equals eighty-one. At first, one does not say or write  \"eighty-one\" when one sees \"nine times nine,\" but one can acquire the  habit of doing so. It does not here concern us how the child learns what  the product of nine times nine is. He may learn it by counting, by being  told, or by reading it in a book. But however he first learns it, he  fixes it and makes it automatic and habitual by _continuing_ to say or  to write, \"nine times nine equals eighty-one.\" The essential point is  that at first the child does not know what to say when he hears or sees  the expression \"nine times nine,\" but after long practice he comes to  give automatically and promptly the correct answer. For the definite  problem \"nine times nine\" there comes the definite response  \"eighty-one.\"    For a third illustration, let us take the case of a man tipping his hat  when he meets a lady. A young boy does not tip his hat when he meets a  lady until he has been taught to do so. After he learns this act of  courtesy he does it quite automatically without thinking of it. For the  definite situation, meeting a lady of his acquaintance,"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/18485"],[0,"Slave Narratives: A Folk History of Slavery in the United States from Interviews (#16)"],[1,"Ann had six chillun. Dey was Miss  Lucy, Miss Myrt, Miss Sarah, Miss Nettie, Marse Charlie, and Marse Tom.  Marse Ike's ma, Old Miss, wouldn't move to town wid him and Miss Ann;  she stayed on in de big house on de plantation. To tell de truf I done  forgot Old Miss' name. De overseer and his wife was Mr. Edmond and Miss  Betsey, and dey moved up to de big house wid old Miss atter Marse Ike  and Miss Ann moved to town. Stiles Vinson was de carriage driver, and he  fotched Marse Ike out to de plantation evvy day. Lord! Gracious alive!  It would take a week to walk all over dat plantation. Dere was more'n a  thousand acres in it and, countin' all de chillun, dere was mighty nigh  a hunnert slaves.    \"Long 'fore day, dat overseer blowed a bugle to wake up de Niggers. You  could hear it far as High Shoals, and us lived dis side of Watkinsville.  Heaps of folkses all over dat part of de country got up by dat old  bugle. I will never forgit one time when de overseer said to us chillun,  'You fellows go to do field and fetch some corn tops.' Mandy said: 'He  ain't talkin' to us 'cause us ain't fellows and I ain't gwine.' Bless  your sweet life, I runned and got dem corn tops, 'cause I didn't want no  beatin'. Dem udder 'chillun got deir footses most cut off wid dem  switches whan dat overseer got to wuk to sho 'em dey had to obey him.  Dat overseer sho did wuk de Niggers hard; he driv' 'em all de time. Dey  had to go to de field long 'fore sunup, and it was way atter sundown  'fore dey could stop dat field wuk. Den dey had to hustle to finish deir  night wuk in time for supper, or go to bed widout it.    [HW sidenote: Beating]    \"You know dey whupped Niggers den. Atter dey had done wukked hard in de  fields all day long, de beatin' started up, and he allus had somepin in  mind to beat 'em about. When dey beat my Aunt Sallie she would fight  back, and once when Uncle Randall said somepin he hadn't oughta, dat  overseer beat him so bad he couldn't wuk for a week. He had to be grez  all over evvy day wid hoalin' ointment for a long time 'fore dem gashes  got well.    \"Rita and Retta was de Nigger 'omans what put pizen in some collards  what dey give Aunt Vira and her baby to eat. She had been laughin' at a  man 'cause his coattail was a-flappin' so funny whilst he was dancin',  and dem two Jezebels thought she was makin' fun of dem. At de graveyard,  'fore dey buried her, dey cut her open and found her heart was all  decayed. De overseer driv dem 'omans clear off de plantation, and  Marster, he was mighty mad. He said he had done lost 'bout $2,000. If he  had kotched dem 'omans he woulda hung 'em, cause he was de hanger. In  'bout two weeks dat overseer left dar, and Old Marse had to git him  anudder man to take his place.    \"Sho! Dere was a jail for slaves and a hangin' place right in front of  de jail, but none of Old Marster's Niggers warn't never put in no  jailhouse. Oh God! Yes, dey sold slaves. My own granddaddy was made to  git up on dat block, and dey sold him. One time I seed Old Marse buy  four boys.\" At this point the narrative ceased when Addie suddenly  remembered that she must stop to get supper for the daughter, who would  soon be returning from work.    The visitor called early in the morning of the following day, and found  Addie bent over her washtubs in the back yard. \"Have dat cheer,\" was the  greeting as the old Negress lifted a dripping hand to point out a chair  under the spreading branches of a huge oak tree, \"You knows you don't  want to hear no more 'bout dat old stuff,\" she said, \"and anyhow, is you  gittin' paid for doin' dis?\" When the visitor admitted that these  interviews were part of her salaried work, Addie quickly asked: \"What is  you gwine to give me?\"    When the last piece of wash had been hung on the line and Addie had  turned a large lard can upside down for a stool, she settled down and  began to talk freely.    \"No Ma'm, dey didn't low Niggers to larn how to read and write. I had to  go wid de white chillun to deir school on Hog Mountain road evvy day to  wait on 'em. I toted water for 'em kep' de fire goin', and done all  sorts of little jobs lak dat. Miss Martha, de overseer's daughter, tried  to larn me to read and write, but I wouldn't take it in.    \"No Ma'm dere warn't no churches for Niggers in slavery time, so slaves  had to go to deir white folkses churches. Us went to church at Betty  Berry (Bethabara) and Mars Hill. When time come for de sermon to de  Niggers, sometimes de white folkses would leave and den again dey would  stay, but dat overseer, he was dar all de time. Old man Isaac Vandiver,  a Nigger preacher what couldn't read a word in de Bible, would git up in  dat pulpit and talk from his heart. You know dere's heaps of folkses  what's got dat sort of 'ligion--it's deep in deir hearts. De Reverend  Freeman was de white folkses' preacher. I laked him best, for what he  said allus sounded good to me.    \"At funerals us used to sing _Hark From De Tomb A Doleful Sound_. I  never went to no funerals, but Old Marster's and Aunt Nira's, 'fore de  end of de war.    \"When Old Marster went off to de war, he had all his slaves go to de  musterin' ground to see him leave. He was captain of his company from  Oconee County, and 'fore he left he had de mens in dat company bury deir  silver and gold, deir watches, rings, and jus' anything dey wanted to  keep, on Hog Mountain. Ha lef' a guard to watch de hidin' place so as  dey would have somepin when dey come back home, den dey marched back to  de musterin' ground dat was twixt de Hopkins' plantation and Old  Marster's place. Uncle Solomon went along to de war to tote Marster's  gun, cook for him, and sich lak. It warn't long 'fore old Marse was kilt  in dat war, and Uncle Solomon fetches him back in a coffin. All de  slaves dat went to de buryin' jus' trembled when guns was fired over Old  Marster's grave. Dat was done to show dat Old Marster had been a  powerful high-up man in de army.    \"Good Gracious! Dere didn't nary a Nigger go off from our place to de  North, 'cause us was skeered of dem Yankees. Dere was a white  slave-trader named McRaleigh what used to come to Old Marster's  plantation to buy up Niggers to take 'em to de Mississippi bottoms. When  us seed him comin' us lit out for de woods. He got Aunt Rachel; you  could hear her hollerin' a mile down de road.    \"Oh! Good Lord! Dem patterollers was awful. Folkses what dey cotched  widout no paper, dey jus' plum wore out. Old man John was de fiddler on  our place, and when de patterollers cotched him dey beat him up de wust  of all, 'cause him and his fiddle was all de time drawin' Niggers out to  do dances.    \"If Old Marster wanted to send a massage he sont Uncle Randall on a mule  named Jim. Sometimes dat old mule tuk a notion he didn't want to go; den  he wouldn't budge. I ricollects one time dey tuk a bundle of fodder and  tied it to Old Jim's tail, but still he wouldn't move. Old Marster kep'  a special man to fetch and carry mail for de plantation in a road cyart,  and nobody warn't 'lowed to go nigh dat cyart.    \"When slaves got in from de fields at night dey cooked and et deir  supper and went to bed. Dey had done been wukin' since sunup. When dere  warn't so much to do in de fields, sometimes Old Marster let his Niggers  lay off from wuk atter dinner on Saddays. If de chinches was most eatin'  de Niggers up, now and den de 'omans was 'lowed to stay to de house to  scald evvything and clear 'em out, but de menfolkses had to go on to de  field. On Sadday nights de 'omans patched, washed, and cut off peaches  and apples to dry in fruit season. In de daytime dey had to cut off and  dry fruit for Old Miss. When slaves got smart wid deir white folkses,  deir Marsters would have 'em beat, and dat was de end of de matter. Dat  was a heap better'n dey does now days, 'cause if a Nigger gits out of  place dey puts him on de chaingang. [TR: 'Whipping' written in margin.]    \"Sunday was a day off for all de slaves on our plantation. Cause, de  mens had to look atter de stock in de lot right back of de cabins. De  'omans cooked all day for de next week. If dey tuk a notion to go to  church, mules was hitched to wagons made lak dippers, and dey jigged off  down de road. Us had four days holiday for Christmas. Old Miss give us  lots of good things to eat dem four days; dere was cake, fresh meat, and  all kinds of dried fruit what had been done stored away. All de Niggers  tuk dat time to rest but my Mammy. She tuk me and went 'round to de  white folkses' houses to wash and weave. Dey said I was a right smart,  peart little gal, and white folkses used to try to hire me from Old  Miss. When dey axed her for me, Old Miss allus told 'em: 'You don't want  to hire dat gal; she ain't no 'count.' She wouldn't let nobody hire her  Niggers, 'cept Mammy, 'cause she knowed Mammy warn't gwine to leave her  nohow. On New Year's Day, if dere warn't too much snow on de ground, de  Niggers burnt brush and cleared new ground.    \"When Aunt Patience led de singin' at cornshuckin's, de shucks sho'ly  did fly. Atter de corn was shucked, dey fed us lots of good things and  give us plenty of liquor. De way cotton pickin' was managed was dis:  evvybody dat picked a thousand pounds of cotton in a week's time was  'lowed a day off. Mammy picked her thousand pounds evvy week.    \"Dances? Now you's talkin' 'bout somepin' sho' 'nough. Old John, de  fiddler man, was right dere on our plantation. Niggers dat had done  danced half de night would be so sleepy when de bugle sounded dey  wouldn't have time to cook breakfast. Den 'bout de middle of de mawnin'  dey would complain 'bout bein' so weak and hongry dat de overseer would  fetch 'em in and have 'em fed. He let 'em rest 'bout a hour and a half;  den he marched 'em back to de field and wuked 'em 'til slap black dark.  Aunt Sook was called de lead wench. If de moon warn't out, she put a  white cloth 'round her shoulders and led 'em on.    \"Di"]]]
