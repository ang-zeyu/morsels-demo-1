[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/17579"],[0,"The History of Napoleon Buonaparte (#16)"],[1," omit any favourable opportunity of  aiding Austria in the great and common object of ridding Italy of the  French. Buonaparte heard without surprise that the Doge had been raising  new levies, and that the senate could command an army of 50,000,  composed chiefly of fierce and semi-barbarous Sclavonian mercenaries. He  demanded what these demonstrations meant, and was answered that Venice  had no desire but to maintain a perfect neutrality. Meantime there was  not wanting a strong party, throughout the Venetian territories of the  mainland, who were anxious to emulate the revolutionary movements of the  great cities of Lombardy, and to emancipate themselves from the yoke of  the Venetian oligarchy, as their neighbours had done by that of the  Austrian crown. Insurrections occurred at Bergamo, Brescia, and  elsewhere; and Buonaparte, though little disposed to give the  inhabitants of these places the boon they were in quest of, saw and  profited by the opportunity of dividing, by their means, the resources,  and shaking the confidence, of the senate. After some negotiation, he  told the Venetian envoy that he granted the prayer of his masters. \"Be  neuter,\" said he, \"but see that your neutrality be indeed sincere and  perfect. If any insurrection occur in my rear, to cut off my  communications in the event of my marching on Germany--if any movement  whatever betray the disposition of your senate to aid the enemies of  France, be sure that vengeance will follow--from that hour the  independence of Venice has ceased to be.\"    More than a month had now elapsed since Alvinzi's defeat at Rivoli; in  nine days the war with the Pope had reached its close; and, having left  some garrisons in the towns on the Adige, to watch the neutrality of  Venice, Napoleon hastened to carry the war into the hereditary dominions  of the Emperor. Twenty thousand fresh troops had recently joined his  victorious standard from France; and, at the head of perhaps a larger  force than he had ever before mustered, he proceeded to the frontier of  the Frioul, where, according to his information, the main army of  Austria, recruited once more to its original strength, was preparing to  open a sixth campaign--under the orders, not of Alvinzi, but of a  general young like himself, and hitherto eminently successful--the same  who had already by his combinations baffled two such masters in the art  of war as Jourdan and Moreau--the Archduke Charles; a prince on whose  high talents the last hopes of the empire seemed to repose.    To give the details of the sixth campaign, which now commenced, would be  to repeat the story which has been already five times told. The  Archduke, fettered by the Aulic Council of Vienna, saw himself compelled  to execute a plan which he had discrimination enough to condemn. The  Austrian army once more commenced operations on a double basis--one  great division on the Tyrolese frontier, and a greater under the  Archduke himself on the Friulese; and Napoleon--who had, even when  acting on the defensive, been able, by the vivacity of his movements, to  assume the superiority on whatever point he chose to select--was not  likely to strike his blows with less skill and vigour, now that his  numbers, and the acquiescence of Italy behind him, permitted him to  assume the offensive.    Buonaparte found the Archduke posted behind the river Tagliamento, in  front of the rugged Carinthian mountains, which guard the passage in  that quarter from Italy to Germany. Detaching Massena to the Piave,  where the Austrian division of Lusignan were in observation, he himself  determined to charge the Archduke in front. Massena was successful in  driving Lusignan before him as far as Belluno, (where a rear guard of  500 surrendered,) and thus turned the Austrian flank. Buonaparte then  attempted and effected the passage of the Tagliamento. After a great and  formal display of his forces, which was met by similar demonstrations  on the Austrian side of the river, he suddenly broke up his line and  retreated. The Archduke, knowing that the French had been marching all  the night before, concluded that the general wished to defer the battle  till another day; and in like manner withdrew to his camp. About two  hours after Napoleon rushed with his whole army, who had merely lain  down in ranks, upon the margin of the Tagliamento, no longer adequately  guarded--and had forded the stream ere the Austrian line of battle could  be formed. In the action which followed (March 12) the troops of the  Archduke displayed much gallantry, but every effort to dislodge Napoleon  failed; at length retreat was judged necessary. The French followed hard  behind. They stormed Gradisca, where they made 5000 prisoners; and--the  Archduke pursuing his retreat--occupied in the course of a few days  Trieste, Fiume, and every stronghold in Carinthia. In the course of a  campaign of twenty days, the Austrians fought Buonaparte ten times, but  the overthrow on the Tagliamento was never recovered; and the Archduke,  after defending Styria inch by inch as he had Carinthia, at length  adopted the resolution of reaching Vienna by forced marches, there to  gather round him whatever force the loyalty of his nation could muster,  and make a last stand beneath the walls of the capital.    This plan, at first sight the mere dictate of despair, was in truth that  of a wise and prudent general. The Archduke had received intelligence  from two quarters of events highly unfavourable to the French. General  Laudon, the Austrian commander on the Tyrol frontier, had descended  thence with forces sufficient to overwhelm Buonaparte's lieutenants on  the upper Adige, and was already in possession of the whole Tyrol, and  of several of the Lombard towns. Meanwhile the Venetian Senate, on  hearing of these Austrian successes, had plucked up courage to throw  aside their flimsy neutrality, and not only declared war against France,  but encouraged their partizans in Verona to open the contest with an  inhuman massacre of the French wounded in the hospitals of that city.  The vindictive Italians, wherever the French party was inferior in  numbers, resorted to similar atrocities. The few troops left in Lombardy  by Napoleon were obliged to shut themselves up in garrisons, which the  insurgent inhabitants of the neighbouring districts invested. The  Venetian army passed the frontier; and, in effect, Buonaparte's means  of deriving supplies of any kind from his rear were for the time wholly  cut off. It was not wonderful that the Archduke should, under such  circumstances, anticipate great advantage from enticing the French army  into the heart of Austria; where, divided by many wide provinces and  mighty mountains and rivers from France, and with Italy once more in  arms behind them, they should have to abide the encounter of an imperial  army, animated by all the best motives that can lend vigour to the arm  of man; fighting for their own hearths under the eyes of their own  sovereign; seconded everywhere by the loyalty of the peasants; and well  convinced that, if they could compel their enemy to a retreat, his total  ruin must be the consequence.    The terror of the Aulic Council stepped in to prevent the Archduke from  reaping either the credit or the disgrace of this movement. Vienna was  panic-struck on hearing that Buonaparte had stormed the passes of the  Julian Alps; the imperial family sent their treasure into Hungary; the  middle ranks, whose interest is always peace, became clamorous for some  termination to a war, which during six years had been so unfortunate;  and the Archduke was ordered to avail himself of the first pretence  which circumstances might afford for the opening of a negotiation.    That prince had already, acting on his own judgment and feelings,  dismissed such an occasion with civility and with coldness. Napoleon had  addressed a letter to his Imperial Highness from Clagenfurt, in which he  called on him, as a brother soldier, to consider the certain miseries  and the doubtful successes of war, and put an end to the campaign by a  fair and equitable treaty. The Archduke replied, that he regarded with  the highest esteem the personal character of his correspondent, but that  the Austrian government had committed to his trust the guidance of a  particular army, not the diplomatic business of the empire. The prince,  on receiving these new instructions from Vienna, perceived, however  reluctantly, that the line of his duty was altered; and the result was a  series of negotiations--which ended in the provisional treaty of Leoben,  signed April 18, 1797.    It was here, at Leoben, that Buonaparte's schoolfellow, De Bourienne,  who had been summoned to act as secretary to the general, reached  headquarters. He found his old comrade (whom he had not met with since  the days of his envying small houses and cabriolets in Paris) in the  midst of a splendid staff. \"So thou art come at last,\" cried Napoleon,  in the ancient tone of familiarity; but De Bourienne knew the world, and  greeted the general of the army of Italy with profound and distant  respect. When the company were gone, Buonaparte signified that he  understood and approved this change of demeanour.    But to resume--no sooner was the negotiation in a fair train, than  Napoleon, abandoning for the moment the details of its management to  inferior diplomatists, hastened to retrace his steps, and pour the full  storm of his wrath on the Venetians. The Doge and the Senate, whose only  hopes had rested on the successes of Austria on the Adige, heard with  utter despair that the Archduke had shared the fate of Beaulieu, of  Wurmser, and of Alvinzi, and that the preliminaries of peace were  actually signed. The rapidity of Buonaparte's return gave them no  breathing-time. They hastened to send offers of submission, and their  messengers were received with anger and contempt. \"French blood has been"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/17587"],[0,"Field Hospital and Flying Column (#16)"],[1," would be brought down, but they were too high  for that. The bombs were only a little diversion of theirs by the  way--they were really trying to locate the Russian battery, as they were  evidently making signals to their own headquarters. Danger always adds  a spice to every entertainment, and as the wounded were all out and we  had nobody but ourselves to think about, we could enjoy our thrilling  departure from Lodz under heavy fire to the uttermost. And I must say I  have rarely enjoyed anything more. It was simply glorious spinning along  in that car, and we got out safely without anyone being hurt.    We passed through Breeziny, where the tail-end of a battle was going on,  and the Prince stopped the car for a few minutes so that we could see  the men in the trenches. On our way we passed crowds of terrified  refugees hurrying along the road with their few possessions on their  backs or in their arms; it reminded me of those sad processions of  flying peasants in Belgium, but I think these were mostly much poorer,  and had not so much to lose. Just as the sun was setting we stopped for  a rest at a place the Prince knew of, half inn, half farm-house. We  looked back, and the sky was bloody and lurid over the western plain  where Lodz lay. To us it seemed like an ill omen for the unhappy town,  but it may be that the Germans took those flaming clouds to mean that  even the heavens themselves were illuminated to signal their victory.    Some bread and some pale golden Hungarian Tokay were produced by our  host for our refreshment. The latter was delicious, but it must have  been much more potent than it looked, for though I only had one small  glass of it, I collapsed altogether afterwards, and lay on the floor of  the car, and could not move till the lights of Warsaw were in sight. In  a few minutes more we arrived at the Hotel Bristol, and then the Flying  Column went to bed at last.          IX    MORE DOINGS OF THE FLYING COLUMN      The Grand Duchess Cyril happened to be staying at the Hotel Bristol too.  Like most of the other members of the Russian Royal Family, since the  beginning of the war she has been devoting her whole time to helping  wounded soldiers, and is the centre of a whole network of activities.  She has a large hospital in Warsaw for men and officers, a very  efficient ambulance train that can hold 800 wounded, and one of the best  surgeons in Petrograd working on it, and a provision train which sets up  feeding-stations for the troops and for refugees in places where food is  very scarce, which last is an indescribable boon to all who benefit by  it. The Grand Duchess's hospital in Warsaw, like every other just at  this time, was crammed to overflowing with wounded from Lodz, and the  staff was inadequate to meet this unexpected need.    The Grand Duchess met Princess V. in the lounge just as we arrived from  Lodz, and begged that our Column might go and help for a time at her  hospital. Accordingly, the next day, the consent of the Red Cross Office  having been obtained, we went off to the Grand Duchess's hospital for a  time to supplement and relieve their staff. They met us with open arms,  as they were all very tired and very thankful for our help. They only  had room for fifty patients and had had about 150 brought in.  Fortunately the Grand Duchess's ambulance train had just come back to  Warsaw, so the most convalescent of the old cases were taken off to  Petrograd, but even then we were working in the operating-theatre till  twelve or one every night. They hoped we had come for two or three weeks  and were very disgusted when, in five days' time, the order came for us  to go off to Skiernevice with the automobiles. The hospital staff gave  us such a nice send-off, and openly wished that they belonged to a  flying column too. I must say it was very interesting these startings  off into the unknown, with our little fleet of automobiles containing  ourselves and our equipment. We made a very flourishing start out of  Warsaw, but very soon plunged into an appalling mess of mud. One could  really write an epic poem on Russian roads. At the best of times they  are awful; on this particular occasion they were full of large holes  made by shells and covered with thick swampy mud that had been snow the  week before. It delayed us so much that we did not get to Skiernevice  till late that night.    Skiernevice is a small town, important chiefly as a railway junction, as  two lines branch off here towards Germany and Austria north-west and  south-west. The Tsar has a shooting-box here in the midst of beautiful  woods, and two rooms had been set apart in this house for our Column.    We arrived late in the evening, secretly hoping that we should get a  night in bed, and were rather rejoiced at finding that there were no  wounded there at all at present, though a large contingent was expected  later. So we camped in the two rooms allotted to us: Princess, Sister  G., and myself in one, and all the men of the party in the other. No  wounded arrived for two or three days, and we thoroughly enjoyed the  rest and, above all, the beautiful woods. How delicious the pines smelt  after that horrible Lodz. Twice a day we used to go down the railway  line, where there was a restaurant car for the officers; it seemed odd  to be eating our meals in the Berlin-Warsaw International Restaurant  Car. There was always something interesting going on at the station. One  day a regiment from Warsaw had just been detrained there when a German  Taube came sailing over the station throwing down grenades. Every man  immediately began to fire up in the air, and we ran much more risk of  being killed by a Russian bullet than by the German Taube. It was like  being in the middle of a battle, and I much regretted I had not my  camera with me. Another day all the debris of a battlefield had been  picked up and was lying in piles in the station waiting to be sent off  to Warsaw. There were truck-loads of stuff; German and Russian  overcoats, boots, rifles, water-bottles, caps, swords, and helmets and  all sorts of miscellaneous kit.    We often saw gangs of prisoners, mostly Austrian, but some German, and  they always seemed well treated by the Russians. The Austrian prisoners  nearly always looked very miserable, cold, hungry, and worn out. Once we  saw a spy being put into the train to go to Warsaw, I suppose to be  shot--an old Jewish man with white hair in a long, black gaberdine,  strips of coloured paper still in his hand with which he had been caught  signalling to the Germans. _How_ angry the soldiers were with him--one  gave him a great punch in the back, another kicked him up into the  train, and a soldier on the platform who saw what was happening ran as  fast as he could and was just in time to give him a parting hit on the  shoulder. The old man did not cry out or attempt to retaliate, but his  face was ashy-white with terror, and one of his hands was dripping with  blood. It was a very horrible sight and haunted me all the rest of the  day. It was quite right that he should be shot as a spy, but the  unnecessary cruelty first sickened me.    There were masses of troops constantly going up to the positions from  Skiernevice, and as there was a short cut through the park, which they  generally used, we could see all that was going on from our rooms. On  Sunday it was evident that another big battle was pending. Several  batteries went up through our woods, each gun-carriage almost up to its  axles in mud, dragged by eight strong horses. They were followed by a  regiment of Cossacks, looking very fierce in their great black fur  head-dresses, huge sheep-skin coats, and long spears. There was one  small Cossack boy who was riding out with his father to the front and  who could not have been more than eleven or twelve years old. There are  quite a number of young boys at the front who make themselves very  useful in taking messages, carrying ammunition, and so on. We had one  little boy of thirteen in the hospital at Warsaw, who was badly wounded  while carrying a message to the colonel, and he was afterwards awarded  the St. George's Cross.    There were enormous numbers of other troops too: Siberians, Tartars,  Asiatic Russians from Turkestan, Caucasians in their beautiful  black-and-silver uniforms, Little Russians from the south, and great  fair-haired giants from the north.    The little Catholic Church in the village was full to overflowing at the  early Mass that Sunday morning with men in full marching kit on their  way out to the trenches. A very large number of them made their  Confession and received the Blessed Sacrament before starting out, and  for many, many of these it was their Viaticum, for the great battle  began that afternoon, and few of the gallant fellows we saw going up to  the trenches that morning ever returned again.    That afternoon the Prince had business at the Staff Headquarters out  beyond Lowice, and I went out there in the automobile with him and  Monsieur Goochkoff. We went through Lowice on the way there. The little  town had been severely bombarded (it was taken two or three days later  by the Germans), and we met many of the peasants hurrying away from it  carrying their possessions with them. You may know the peasants of  Lowice anywhere by their distinctive dress, which is the most  brilliantly coloured peasant dress imaginable. The women wear gorgeous  petticoats of orange, red and blue, or green in vertical stripes and a  cape of the same material over their shoulders, a bright-coloured shawl,  generally orange, on their heads, and brilliant bootlaces--magenta is  the colour most affected. The men, too, wear trousers of the same kind  of vertical stripes, generally of orange and black. These splashes of  bright colour are delicious in this sad, grey country.    The General of the Staff was quartered at Radzivilow Castle, and I  explored the place while the Prince "]]]
