Sometimes the first movement is preceded by a slow  introduction, intended to prepare the mind of the listener for the  proclamation which shall come with the _Allegro_. The key of the  principal subject is set down as the key of the symphony, and unless  the composer gives his work a special title for the purpose of  providing a hint as to its poetical contents (\"Eroica,\" \"Pastoral,\"  \"Faust,\" \"In the Forest,\" \"Lenore,\" \"Pathetique,\" etc.), or to  characterize its style (\"Scotch,\" \"Italian,\" \"Irish,\" \"Welsh,\"  \"Scandinavian,\" \"From the New World\"), it is known only by its key, or  the number of the work (_opus_) in the composer's list. Therefore we  have Mozart's Symphony \"in G minor,\" Beethoven's \"in A major,\"  Schumann's \"in C,\" Brahms's \"in F,\" and so on.    [Sidenote: _The second movement._]    [Sidenote: _Variations._]    The second movement in the symphonic scheme is the slow movement.  Musicians frequently call it the Adagio, for convenience, though the  tempi of slow movements ranges from extremely slow (_Largo_) to the  border line of fast, as in the case of the Allegretto of the Seventh  Symphony of Beethoven. The mood of the slow movement is frequently  sombre, and its instrumental coloring dark; but it may also be  consolatory, contemplative, restful, religiously uplifting. The  writing is preferably in a broadly sustained style, the effect being  that of an exalted hymn, and this has led to a predilection for a  theme and variations as the mould in which to cast the movement. The  slow movements of Beethoven's Fifth and Ninth Symphonies are made up  of variations.    [Sidenote: _The Scherzo._]    [Sidenote: _Genesis of the Scherzo._]    [Sidenote: _The Trio._]    The Scherzo is, as the term implies, the playful, jocose movement of a  symphony, but in the case of sublime geniuses like Beethoven and  Schumann, who blend profound melancholy with wild humor, the  playfulness is sometimes of a kind which invites us to thoughtfulness  instead of merriment. This is true also of some Russian composers,  whose scherzos have the desperate gayety which speaks from the music  of a sad people whose merrymaking is not a spontaneous expression of  exuberant spirits but a striving after self-forgetfulness. The Scherzo  is the successor of the Minuet, whose rhythm and form served the  composers down to Beethoven. It was he who substituted the Scherzo,  which retains the chief formal characteristics of the courtly old  dance in being in triple time and having a second part called the  Trio. With the change there came an increase in speed, but it ought to  be remembered that the symphonic minuet was quicker than the dance of  the same name. A tendency toward exaggeration, which is patent among  modern conductors, is threatening to rob the symphonic minuet of the  vivacity which gave it its place in the scheme of the symphony. The  entrance of the Trio is marked by the introduction of a new idea (a  second minuet) which is more sententious than the first part, and  sometimes in another key, the commonest change being from minor to  major.    [Sidenote: _The Finale._]    [Sidenote: _Rondo form._]    The final movement, technically the Finale, is another piece of large  dimensions in which the psychological drama which plays through the  four acts of the symphony is brought to a conclusion. Once the purpose  of the Finale was but to bring the symphony to a merry end, but as the  expressive capacity of music has been widened, and mere play with  aesthetic forms has given place to attempts to convey sentiments and  feelings, the purposes of the last movement have been greatly extended  and varied. As a rule the form chosen for the Finale is that called  the Rondo. Borrowed from an artificial verse-form (the French  _Rondeau_), this species of composition illustrates the peculiarity of  that form in the reiteration of a strophe ever and anon after a new  theme or episode has been exploited. In modern society verse, which  has grown out of an ambition to imitate the ingenious form invented by  mediaeval poets, we have the Triolet, which may be said to be a rondeau  in miniature. I choose one of Mr. H.C. Bunner's dainty creations to  illustrate the musical refrain characteristic of the rondo form  because of its compactness. Here it is:    [Sidenote: _A Rondo pattern in poetry._]        \"A pitcher of mignonette        In a tenement's highest casement:      Queer sort of a flower-pot--yet        That pitcher of mignonette      Is a garden in heaven set,        To the little sick child in the basement--      The pitcher of mignonette,        In the tenement's highest casement.\"    [Sidenote: _Other forms for the Finale._]    If now the first two lines of this poem, which compose its refrain, be  permitted to stand as the principal theme of a musical piece, we have  in Mr. Bunner's triolet a rondo _in nuce_. There is in it a threefold  exposition of the theme alternating with episodic matter. Another form  for the finale is that of the first movement (the Sonata form), and  still another, the theme and variations. Beethoven chose the latter  for his \"Eroica,\" and the choral close of his Ninth, Dvorak, for his  symphony in G major, and Brahms for his in E minor.    [Sidenote: _Organic Unities._]    [Sidenote: _How enforced._]    [Sidenote: _Berlioz's \"idee fixe.\"_]    [Sidenote: _Recapitulation of themes._]    I am attempting nothing more than a characterization of the symphony,  and the forms with which I associated it at the outset, which shall  help the untrained listener to comprehend them as unities despite the  fact that to the careless hearer they present themselves as groups of  pieces each one of which is complete in itself and has no connection  with its fellows. The desire of composers to have their symphonies  accepted as unities instead of compages of unrelated pieces has led to  the adoption of various devices designed to force the bond of union  upon the attention of the hearer. Thus Beethoven in his symphony in C  minor not only connects the third and fourth movements but also  introduces a reminiscence of the former into the midst of the latter;  Berlioz in his \"Symphonie Fantastique,\" which is written to what may  be called a dramatic scheme, makes use of a melody which he calls  \"_l'idee fixe_,\" and has it recur in each of the four movements as an  episode. This, however, is frankly a symphony with programme, and  ought not to be treated as a modification of the pure form. Dvorak in  his symphony entitled \"From the New World,\" in which he has striven to  give expression to the American spirit, quotes the first period of his  principal subject in all the subsequent movements, and then  sententiously recapitulates the principal themes of the first, second,  and third movements in the finale; and this without a sign of the  dramatic purpose confessed by Berlioz.    [Sidenote: _Introduction of voices._]    [Sidenote: _Abolition of pauses._]    In the last movement of his Ninth Symphony Beethoven calls voices to  the aid of his instruments. It was a daring innovation, as it seemed  to disrupt the form, and we know from the story of the work how long  he hunted for the connecting link, which finally he found in the  instrumental recitative. Having hit upon the device, he summons each  of the preceding movements, which are purely instrumental, into the  presence of his augmented forces and dismisses it as inadequate to the  proclamation which the symphony was to make. The double-basses and  solo barytone are the spokesmen for the tuneful host. He thus achieves  the end of connecting the Allegro, Scherzo, and Adagio with each  other, and all with the Finale, and at the same time points out what  it is that he wishes us to recognize as the inspiration of the whole;  but here, again, the means appear to be somewhat extraneous.  Schumann's example, however, in abolishing the pauses between the  movements of the symphony in D minor, and having melodic material  common to all the movements, is a plea for appreciation which cannot  be misunderstood. Before Schumann Mendelssohn intended that his  \"Scotch\" symphony should be performed without pauses between the  movements, but his wishes have been ignored by the conductors, I fancy  because he having neglected to knit the movements together by  community of ideas, they can see no valid reason for the abolition of  the conventional resting-places.    [Sidenote: _Beethoven's \"choral\" symphony followed._]    Beethoven's augmentation of the symphonic forces by employing voices  has been followed by Berlioz in his \"Romeo and Juliet,\" which, though  called a \"dramatic symphony,\" is a mixture of symphony, cantata, and  opera; Mendelssohn in his \"Hymn of Praise\" (which is also a composite  work and has a composite title--\"Symphony Cantata\"), and Liszt in his  \"Faust\" symphony, in the finale of which we meet a solo tenor and  chorus of men's voices who sing Goethe's _Chorus mysticus_.    [Sidenote: _Increase in the number of movements._]    A number of other experiments have been made, the effectiveness of  which has been conceded in individual instances, but which have failed  permanently to affect the symphonic form. Schumann has two trios in  his symphony in B-flat, and his E-flat, the so-called \"Rhenish,\" has  five movements instead of four, there being two slow movements, one in  moderate tempo (_Nicht schnell_), and the other in slow (_Feierlich_).  In this symphony, also, Schumann exercises the license which has been  recognized since Beethoven's time, of changing the places in the  scheme of the second and third movements, giving the second place to  the jocose division instead of the slow. Beethoven's \"Pastoral\" has  also five movements, unless one chooses to take the storm which  interrupts the \"Merry-making of the Country Folk\" as standing toward  the last movement as an introduction, as, indeed, it does in the "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/17478"],[0,"Great Pictures, As Seen and Described (#16)"],[1,"forests, on the banks of his ponds and rivers, in the  neighbourhood of his huts and mills, Hobbema wants to have company; so  he has sown his landscapes with figures, and they are constantly  animated with people and animals. Are these figures always his own? It  would be imprudent to affirm this, although they harmonize in most cases  so marvellously with the rest of the picture, and it would therefore  seem difficult for them to be by another hand. However, if we must defer  to his historian, von Wurzbach, they are very frequently the work of  Nicholaas Berghem, Adriaen Van de Velde, Lingelbach, Philip Wouwerman,  Isack van Ostade, Pijnacker, etc., which would prove, at least, that he  knew how to select his collaborators.    The painter of the _Avenue of Middelharnais_ in the National Gallery, of  the _Mill_ in our Louvre, and of many other masterpieces was yet  unknown, or rather despised, not very long ago, and it is quite recently  that his name has emerged from the unjust neglect in which it was  buried. This great name of Hobbema had fallen into such discredit that  when one of his pictures fell by chance into the hands of an amateur or  merchant the signature would be effaced as quickly as possible and  replaced by that of J. Ruysdael, the sole painter worthy of entering  into competition with him.    Who then is this Meindert Hobbema? Where was he born? Where did he live?  What was his life? Alas, we know very little concerning this impeccable  master, one of the greatest glories of Dutch painting. The principal  historians of the Netherland school are ignorant of him or pass him by  in silence. Houbraken, Descamps, and d'Argenville are dumb regarding  him. Those who, by chance, treat of him, commit so many errors that it  is best to take no account of their words. Three cities, Amsterdam,  Koeverden, and a village, Middelharnais, in the province of Guelder,  which he has made famous by the marvellous picture, the subject of our  notice, dispute the honour of being his birthplace. But, it seems,  although nothing can be affirmed with certainty, that he first saw the  light in Amsterdam in 1638. He was the son of a sergeant in the  Netherland army and spent his early life in Koeverden, where he was  baptized and where his father was in garrison. At a later period he  established himself in Amsterdam, where he became the pupil and soon the  comrade and friend of J. Ruysdael, who served as witness to his marriage  with Eeltie Vinck, celebrated in this same city, Oct. 2, 1668. From that  time he scarcely ever left Amsterdam, where he died, Dec. 14, 1709, five  years after his wife, in the sad Roosegraft, which had seen Rembrandt  expire thirty years before. He was sixty-seven years of age. Have we any  need to add that, like Rembrandt, the painter of painters, he died  poor?    That is all we know of Meindert Hobbema. It is little enough, but quite  sufficient. Have we not the man complete in his work? What more could we  wish?        Jouin, _Chefs-d'oeuvre: Peinture, Sculpture, Architecture_      (Paris, 1895-97).          THE DANCE OF THE DAUGHTER OF HERODIAS    (_ANDREA DEL SARTO_)    ALGERNON CHARLES SWINBURNE      With the majestic and tragic things of art we began, at the landmarks  set by Leonardo and Michael Angelo; and are come now, not quite at  random, to the lyric and elegiac loveliness of Andrea del Sarto. To  praise him would need sweeter and purer speech than this of ours. His  art is to me as the Tuscan April in its temperate days, fresh and tender  and clear, but lulled and kindled by such air and light as fills the  life of the growing year with fire. At Florence only can one trace and  tell how great a painter and how various he was. There only, but surely  there, can the influence and pressure of the things of time on his  immortal spirit be understood; how much of him was killed or changed,  how much of him could not be. There are the first-fruits of his  flowering manhood, when the bright and buoyant genius in him had free  play and large delight in its handiwork; when the fresh interest of  invention was still his, and the dramatic sense, the pleasure in the  play of life, the power of motion and variety; before the old strength  of sight and of flight had passed from weary wing and clouding eye, the  old pride and energy of enjoyment had gone out of hand and heart. How  the change fell upon him, and how it wrought, any one may see who  compares his later with his earlier works, with the series, for  instance, of outlines representing the story of St. John Baptist in the  desolate little cloister of Lo Scalzo. In these mural designs there is  such exultation and exuberance of young power, of fresh passion and  imagination, that only by the innate grace can one recognize the hand of  the master whom hitherto we know by the works of his after life, when  the gift of grace had survived the gift of invention. This and all other  gifts it did survive; all pleasure of life and power of mind, all the  conscience of the man, his will, his character, his troubles, his  triumphs, his sin and honour, heart-break and shame. All these his charm  of touch, his sweetness of execution, his \"Elysian beauty, melancholy  grace,\" outlived, and blossomed in their dust. Turn from that cloistral  series to those later pictures, painted when he was \"faultless\" and  nothing more; and seeing all the growth and all the gain, all the change  and all the loss, one to whom the second was unknown would feel and  foreknow his story and his sorrow. In the cloister, what life and  fullness of growing and strengthening genius, what joyous sense of its  growth and the fair field before it, what dramatic delight in character  and action! where St. John preaches in the wilderness and the few first  listeners are gathered together at his feet, old people and poor,  soul-stricken, silent--women with worn still faces, and a spirit in  their tired aged eyes that feeds heartily and hungrily on his words--all  the haggard funereal group filled from the fountain of his faith with  gradual fire and white-heat of soul; or where Salome dances before  Herod, an incarnate figure of music, grave and graceful, light and  glad, the song of a bird made flesh, with perfect poise of her sweet  slight body from the maiden face to the melodious feet; no tyrannous or  treacherous goddess of deadly beauty, but a simple virgin, with the cold  charm of girlhood and the mobile charm of childhood; as indifferent and  innocent when she stands before Herodias and when she receives the  severed head of John with her slender and steady hands; a pure bright  animal, knowing nothing of man, and of life nothing but instinct and  motion. In her mother's mature and conscious beauty there is visible the  voluptuous will of a harlot and a queen; but, for herself, she has  neither malice nor pity; her beauty is a maiden force of nature, capable  of bloodshed without bloodguiltiness; the King hangs upon the music of  her movement, the rhythm of leaping life in her fair fleet limbs, as one  who listens to a tune, subdued by the rapture of sound, absorbed in  purity of passion. I know not where the subject has been touched with  such fine and keen imagination as here. The time came when another than  Salome was to dance before the eyes of the painter; and she required of  him the head of no man, but his own soul; and he paid the forfeit into  her hands. With the coming of that time upon him came the change upon  his heart and hand; \"the work of an imperious whorish woman.\" Those  words, set by the prophet as a brand upon the fallen forehead of the  chosen bride, come back to mind as one studies in her husband's pictures  the full calm lineaments, the large and serene beauty of Lucrezia del  Fede; a predominant and placid beauty, placid and implacable, not to be  pleaded with or fought against. Voluptuous always and slothful, subtle  at times no doubt and sweet beyond measure, full of heavy beauty and  warm, slow grace, her features bear no sign of possible love or  conscience. Seen side by side with his clear sad face, hers tells more  of the story than any written record, even though two poets of our age  have taken it up. In the feverish and feeble melodrama of Alfred de  Musset there is no touch of tragedy, hardly a shadow of passionate and  piteous truth; in Mr. Browning's noblest poem--his noblest it seems to  me--the whole tragedy is distilled into the right words, the whole man  raised up and reclothed with flesh. One point only is but lightly  touched upon--missed it could not be by an eye so sharp and skilful--the  effect upon his art of the poisonous solvent of love. How his life was  corroded by it and his soul burnt into dead ashes, we are shown in full;  but we are not shown in full what as a painter he was before, what as a  painter he might have been without it. This is what I think the works of  his youth and age, seen near together as at Florence, make manifest to  any loving and studious eye. In those later works, the inevitable and  fatal figure of the woman recurs with little diversity or change. She  has grown into his art, and made it even as herself; rich, monotonous in  beauty, calm, complete, without heart or spirit. But his has not been  always \"the low-pulsed forthright craftsman's hand\" it was then. He had  started on his way towards another goal than that. Nothing now is left  him to live for but his faultless hand and her faultless face--still and  full, suggestive of no change in the steady deep-lidded eyes and heavy  lovely lips without love or pudency or pity. Here among his sketches we  find it again and ever the same, crowned and clothed only with the  glory and the joy and the majesty of the flesh. When the luxurious and  subtle sense which serves the woman for a soul looks forth and speaks  plainest from those eyes and lips, she is sovereign and stately still;  there is in her beauty nothing common or unclean.
