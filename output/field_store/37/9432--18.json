Proudly leading his party of beaters, the Hottentot approached and,  giving a sort of semi-military salute, announced that the villagers but  awaited the orders of the white chiefs to proceed.  Then, leading  forward a tall savage of some thirty-five years of age, of magnificent  physique, he introduced the man as Mafuta, the half-brother of the  injured man, and informed Dick that he, Mafuta, had specially requested  the honour of being allowed to act as gunbearer to his brother's  benefactor on this occasion.  Dick ran his eye over the man, noted the  splendid development of his thews and sinews, marked several ugly scars  on his body and limbs bearing mute testimony to the fact that he had  already proved himself a warrior, met his unflinching glance, proud and  resolute, yet respectful, and instantly decided that here was a man who  might be absolutely trusted.  Without hesitation he placed his spare  rifle in Mafuta's hands, explaining to him, through Jantje, exactly what  he wished him to do with it; and then issued his final instructions to  the beaters, who at once moved off to work round to the windward side of  the clump of bush in which the lions were said to be hiding, while  Grosvenor and he, followed respectively by Jantje and Mafuta, took their  leisurely way toward the points where they intended to station  themselves.  For a considerable part of the distance they walked  together; and when at length they separated, Dick, who somehow seemed to  have assumed the direction of affairs as a matter of course, with  Grosvenor's tacit consent and approval, said:    \"Now, Phil, anything that may break cover to the right of that baobab,  as we stand facing it, belongs to you, while anything that emerges to  the left belongs to me, neither of us to interfere with the other's  chances unless the brutes seem likely to get away and make good their  escape.  And, just one caution, old chap: don't fire until your quarry  has passed out clear of the line of bush, or you may quite  unintentionally shoot one of the beaters.  Ah! there are the dogs giving  tongue; the beaters are putting them into the bush.  To your station,  old man, and good luck to you!\"    \"Thanks! same to you, old chap,\" cheerily responded Grosvenor, as he  wheeled and strode away to the spot fixed upon as his station.    The clump of bush in which the lions were said to have secreted  themselves was an isolated one, with nothing in particular to  distinguish it from the thousands of other clumps that dotted the  visible country, except that one extremity of it abutted upon the edge  of a small shallow ravine, through which trickled a tiny rivulet  discharging itself into the larger stream which flows through the long  valley that intersected the landscape.  Close to the spot where the  clump of bush touched the edge of the ravine the rivulet flowed into and  through a shallow basin of rock, which formed an ideal drinking place  for animals; and it was possibly this circumstance that had caused the  lions to take up their temporary abode in that particular clump.  There  was the possibility that the lions, when breaking cover, might attempt  to escape by bolting into and up the ravine; and accordingly, when this  fact had been pointed out and explained to Dick, he had very unselfishly  placed his friend Grosvenor on that side in order that the latter might  have the benefit of the most likely chances.    The barking and yelping of the dogs grew steadily louder and more  insistent, and to it was presently added the shouts and shrill  whistlings of the Kafirs as they forced their way through the thick  undergrowth.  A few birds flew out with startled cries, but for about a  quarter of an hour there was no further result.  Then suddenly the dogs  burst into a chorus of sharp, savage barks, entirely different in  character from their former utterances, and quite sufficient in itself  to inform even the veriest novice that game of some sort was afoot; the  Kafirs' cries of encouragement were redoubled; an occasional rustling  and crackling of branches became audible to the intent watchers.  Presently there arose a terrific outburst of furious snarlings, growls,  and yappings, intermingled with the violent swishing and crackling of  dry leaves and twigs, evidence conclusive that a fight was proceeding in  the heart of the bush.  Then the sudden, sharp, agonised pow-wow of a  dog in pain rang out, accompanied by a horrible sound of worrying; a  still further increase of the hubbub followed, then a heavy crashing of  bushes, and out sprang a magnificent tawny-maned lion into the open.  He  broke into view immediately opposite to Dick, and not more than twenty  yards distant, stopping dead as he sighted the lad standing rifle in  hand, with Mafuta like a bronze statue behind him.  As the splendid  beast stood at gaze, with blazing eyes, and his tail switching in short,  angry jerks from side to side, the feeling of anxiety and nervousness  that had been oppressing Dick seemed to drop from him like a garment.  In an instant he became absolutely cool, steady, and self-possessed, and  lifting his rifle to his shoulder with a lightning-like movement, while  the sights of the weapon seemed to line themselves of their own volition  upon the centre of the beast's broad forehead, right between the eyes,  he pressed the trigger.  There was a flash, a sharp, whip-like report, a  faint puff of smoke, and the lion dropped stone dead where he stood.    Meanwhile the hubbub in the bush was raging even more fiercely than  ever, showing that the beast which had just fallen to Dick's rifle had  not been the cause of it, and that the sport was by no means over.  Dick's weapon was a magazine rifle, and with a quick movement he jerked  another cartridge into position, just as the uproar grew so loud and  near at hand that it became evident another break was imminent.    The next instant it occurred.  A splendid lioness, carrying a small cub  in her mouth, crashed into the open, with a dozen or more yapping and  snarling curs at her heels.  She broke cover well on Grosvenor's side of  the baobab; and, like the lion, came to an abrupt halt as soon as she  saw Grosvenor, straight toward whom she was charging.  In an instant the  white man's rifle leapt to his shoulder, and the next instant he fired.  But even as he pressed the trigger, a dog, more valiant or more  foolhardy than the rest, dashed in upon her, and with the rapidity of  lightning she turned to meet his rush, dropping her cub, and nearly  tearing the miserable cur's head from his shoulders with a single stroke  of her powerful fore paw.  At the same instant Grosvenor's bullet, aimed  at her head, crashed into her flank, passing right through it and  utterly paralysing her hind quarters.  With a whining, snarling roar the  poor beast rolled over on her side, but instantly recovered herself so  far as to raise herself on her fore legs--between which the cub, but a  trifle bigger than a well-grown cat, took refuge--her jaws champing and  foaming, and her eyes blazing lightnings at the dogs, which, recognising  her helplessness, closed in round her.    \"Save the cub!\" shouted Dick; \"don't let the dogs worry it; I want to  keep the little beast alive.\"  And, leaving his position, he hurried  forward, regardless of danger, to beat off the dogs.  Grosvenor and  Jantje also rushed forward at his shouts, and were quickly joined by  Mafuta, who seemed to divine what Dick required.  Dashing fearlessly in  among the snarling and snapping dogs, the Kafir and the Hottentot at  length succeeded in beating them off, upon which Grosvenor stepped close  up to the lioness and gave her the _coup de grace_ by sending a bullet  through her brain.  As she rolled over dead, Mafuta sprang in and  grabbed the cub by the skin of the neck, despite the fact that it  snarled and spat like an angry cat and struck out viciously with its  claws, which were already strong enough to inflict quite a painful  scratch, and carried it off to the wagon, tying it to a wheel by a stout  reim.    Having ensured the safety of the cub, Dick, carrying his own and the  spare rifle which he had snatched from Mafuta, hurried back to the point  which he had so hurriedly deserted; for the commotion in the heart of  the bush clearly evidenced the fact that the remaining members of the  troop of lions still clung to cover, and that the beaters and dogs were  doing their utmost to dislodge them.  Laying the spare rifle at his  feet, Dick stood facing the great clump, with the rifle in his hand at  the ready, prepared for any emergency.  The noise and confusion,  however, seemed to indicate that the next event would occur in the area  under Grosvenor's jurisdiction, and, sure enough, about a minute later  another lion and lioness broke cover together, followed by the remainder  of the dogs.  The noble beasts, both of which were apparently young  animals, and but barely full-grown, evidently intended to make for fresh  cover in the ravine, but, finding Grosvenor blocking the way, came to a  sudden halt, upon which the dogs instantly gathered round them, yapping  and snarling furiously, while individual members made sudden feints of  dashing in, only to retreat precipitately with their tails between their  legs as the infuriated beasts turned this way and that to meet the rush.    The crowding, clamouring dogs, with their quick rushes, and the  incessant twists and turns of the regal pair to meet those rushes, were  anything but conducive to good shooting, and Grosvenor, with rifle to  shoulder, held his fire, watching for a favourable opportunity.  Suddenly it came: a dog more venturesome "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/21070"],[0,"A Middy of the Slave Squadron: A West African Story (#16)"],[1," other matters as he thought might be useful; and, lastly, poor  Nugent's body was taken down and reverently covered over with the ship's  ensign, which had been saved, laid on a rough, impromptu platform on the  thwarts amidships--the other poor fellows who had fallen in the fight  had been buried before the setting-out of the boat expedition, I now  learned.  A final look round the camp was then taken by Purchase and  Hutchinson; a few more articles that were thought worth preserving from  possible midnight raiders were brought down; and then we got under way  and stood up the river, keeping in the slack water as much as possible,  in order to cheat the current.    It was within an hour of sunset when Purchase, who had been standing up  in the stern-sheets of the boat, intently studying the shore of the  right bank of the river for some ten minutes, gave the order to douse  the canvas and stand by to ship the oars; and as he did so he waved his  hand to the coxswain, who put down his helm and sheered the boat in  toward what looked like an unbroken belt of mangroves stretching for  miles along the bank.  But as the launch, with plenty of way on her,  surged forward, an opening gradually revealed itself; and presently we  slid into a creek, or channel, some two hundred feet wide, the margins  of which were heavily fringed with mangroves, and at once found  ourselves winding along this narrow passage of oil-smooth, turbid water,  in a stagnant atmosphere of roasting heat that was redolent of all the  odours of foetid mud and decaying vegetation.  This channel proved to be  about a mile long, and curved round gradually from a north-easterly to a  south-easterly direction, ending in a fine spacious lagoon about eight  miles long by from three to four miles wide at its widest point, arrived  in which we once more felt the breeze and the sails were again set, the  boat heading about south-east, close-hauled on the port tack, toward  what eventually proved to be an island of very fair size, fringed with  the inevitable mangroves, but heavily timbered, as to its interior, with  magnificent trees of several descriptions, among which I distinguished  several very fine specimens of the _bombax_.  Handsomely weathering this  island, with a few fathoms to spare, and standing on until we could  weather a small, low-lying island to windward of us on the next tack, we  then hove about and stood for the northern shore of the lagoon, by that  time some five miles distant, finally shooting in between the mainland  and an island nearly two miles long, upon which stood the slave factory  that our lads had captured earlier in the day.  The whole surface of  this island, except a narrow belt along its southern shore, had been  completely cleared of vegetation; and upon the cleared space had been  erected two enormous barracoons and, as Purchase had said, a regular  village of well-constructed, stone-built houses raised on massive piers  of masonry, and with broad galleries and verandahs all round them,  evidently intended for the occupation of the slave-dealers and their  dependants.  A fine timber wharf extended along the entire northern side  of the island, with massive bollards sunk into the soil at regular  intervals for ships to make fast to; half a dozen trunk buoys occupied  the middle of the fairway; and the whole settlement was completely  screened from prying eyes by the heavy belt of standing timber that had  been left undisturbed on the southern shore of the island.  I had  thought that the factory on the Camma Lagoon represented the last word  in the construction of slave-dealing establishments; but this concern  was quite twice as extensive, and more elaborately complete in every  respect.    By the time that we invalids were landed it was close upon sunset, and  under Purchase's guidance we were all conducted up to the largest house  in the place, where, in one of the rooms, Murdoch was still hard at work  attending to the batch of patients that were the result of that day's  work.  We, the new arrivals, however, were shepherded into another room,  where fairly comfortable beds were arranged along the two sides, and  into these beds the worst cases were at once put and turned over to  Murdoch's care, while Hutchinson promptly pulled off his coat and took  up Murdoch's work in what might be termed the operating-room.  I,  however, was not considered a bad case, and was accordingly placed in  another smaller room, or ward, along with about half a dozen others in  like condition with myself.    While these arrangements were proceeding, a fatigue-party had been busy  at work in a secluded spot chosen by the skipper, at some distance from  the houses; and before we, the wounded, had all been comfortably  disposed of for the night, the dead Nugent included--were laid to rest  with such honourable observance as the exigencies of the moment would  permit.    The casualties in this last affair were, of course, by no means all on  the British side; we had suffered pretty severely in the three affairs  in which we had been involved since the departure of the boat expedition  from the ship, our total amounting to eleven killed and twenty-six  wounded; but the losses on the part of the enemy had been very  considerably greater, their dead, in this last fight alone, numbering  nineteen killed, while thirty-three wounded had been hurriedly bestowed  in one of the houses, to be attended to by the surgeons as soon as our  own people had been patched up; thus Hutchinson and Murdoch were kept  busy the whole of that night, while Copplestone, Keene, and Parkinson--  the three uninjured midshipmen--were impressed as ward-attendants to  keep watch over our own wounded, and administer medicine, drink, and  nourishment from time to time.    It was a most fortunate circumstance for all hands that this last  factory had been discovered and captured; for we were thus provided with  cool, comfortable living quarters, instead of being compelled to camp  out on the exposed beach opposite the wreck; and to this circumstance  alone may be attributed the saving of several of the more severely  wounded, to say nothing of the fact that we now occupied a position  which could be effectually defended from such attacks as that to which  we had been exposed on the spit during the previous night.  Moreover, it  relieved the captain of a very heavy load of anxiety, since, but for the  fortunate circumstance of this capture, he would have had no alternative  but to have continued in the occupation of our makeshift camp on the  spit, it being impossible for him to undertake a boat voyage to Sierra  Leone with so many wounded on his hands.  It is true that he might have  sent away the launch, with an officer and half a dozen hands, to Sierra  Leone to summon assistance; but his ambition was not to be so easily  satisfied.  We had done splendid service in capturing two factories and  destroying one of them--the second would also, of course, be destroyed  when we abandoned it--but the loss of the _Psyche_ was a very serious  matter, which must be atoned for in some shape or another; and he soon  allowed it to be understood that he was in no particular hurry to quit  our present quarters, where the wounded were making admirable progress,  and the sound were comfortably housed, while provisions of all kinds  were plentiful and the water was good.  But this, excellent as it was in  itself, was by no means all; with two such perfectly equipped factories  as we had found upon the river it was certain that the slave traffic on  the Fernan Vaz must have assumed quite formidable proportions; and it  was the skipper's idea that before our wounded should be lit to be  moved, one or more slavers would certainly enter the river, when it  would be our own fault if we did not capture them.    The most careful dispositions were accordingly made, with this object in  view; the gig, in charge of an officer, was daily dispatched to the  entrance of the lagoon in order that, herself concealed, her crew might  maintain a watch upon the river and report the passage of any vessels  upward-bound for the Camma Lagoon, while, so far as our own quarters  were concerned, everything was allowed to remain as nearly as possible  as it was before it fell into our hands, in order that, should a slaver  arrive at the factory, there should be nothing about the place to give  the alarm until it should be too late for her to effect her escape.  As  a final precaution, a sort of crow's-nest arrangement was rigged up in a  lofty silk-cotton tree which had been left standing in the screening  belt of timber along the southern shore of the island, in order that a  look-out might be maintained upon the approach channel during the hours  of daylight, and timely notice given to us of the approach of slavers to  the factory of which we were in occupation.    A full week elapsed from the date of our desperate fight on the sand  spit, with no occurrence of any moment save that, thanks to the skill  and indefatigable exertions of Hutchinson and Murdoch, all our wounded  were doing remarkably well, two or three of them, indeed, having so far  recovered that they were actually able to perform such light duty as  that of hospital ward-attendants; while the unwounded had been kept  perpetually busy at the scene of the wreck, salving such matters as were  washed ashore, and transferring everything of any value to our quarters.  Meanwhile, the ship had parted amidships, and was fast going to pieces,  so that our labours in that direction were coming to an end, and in the  course of another week or two there would be nothing more than a rib  showing here and there above water, and a few trifles of wreckage  scattered along the beach to tell to strangers the story of our  disaster.  The enemy's wounded also, who were sharing with us the  attentions of the surgeon and his mate, were doing well upon the whole,"]]]
