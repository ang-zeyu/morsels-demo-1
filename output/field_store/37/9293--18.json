As a last, convincing  argument, he gently hints that it is very easy for a student in  Heidelberg to borrow money at 10 per cent. interest. He got the money  and enjoyed his Swiss tour, mostly on foot and alone; but in Italy  various misfortunes overtook him--he fell ill, his money ran out, and  he was only too glad to return to Heidelberg in the same condition as  when he had first arrived there, on which occasion the state of his  purse compelled him to make the last part of the journey from Leipsic  on foot.    On this trip he enjoyed that unique emotional thrill of the German,  the first sight of the Rhine, with which he was so enchanted that he  went to the extreme forward end of the deck, smoking a good cigar  given him by an Englishman: \"Thus I sat alone all the afternoon,  revelling in the wild storm which ploughed through my hair, and  composing a poem of praise to the Northeast wind\"--for Schumann often  indulged in poetic efforts, especially when inspired to flights of  fancy by his favorite author, Jean Paul.    At Heidelberg, which he called \"ein ganzes Paradies von Natur,\" he  spent one of the happiest years of his life. Student life at this town  he thus compares with Leipsic:    \"In and near Heidelberg the student is the most prominent and  respected individual, since it is he who supports the town, so that  the citizens and Philistines are naturally excessively courteous. I  consider it a disadvantage for a young man, especially for a student,  to live in a town where the student only and solely rules and  flourishes. Repression alone favors the free development of a youth,  and the everlasting loafing with students greatly limits  many-sidedness of thought, and consequently exerts a bad influence on  practical life. This is one great advantage Leipsic has over  Heidelberg--which, in fact, a large city always has over a small  one.... On the other hand, Heidelberg has this advantage, that the  grandeur and beauty of the natural scenery prevent the students from  spending so much of their time in drinking; for which reason the  students here are ten times more sober than in Leipsic.\"    Schumann himself, as we have said, was fond of a glass of good wine.  On his first journey, at Prague, he tells us, the Tokay made him  happy. And in another place he exclaims, \"Every day I should like to  drink champagne to excite myself.\" But, though of a solitary  disposition, he did not care to drink alone, for \"only in the intimate  circle of sympathetic hearts does the vine's blood become transfused  into our own and warm it to enthusiasm.\" Schumann's special vice was  the constant smoking of very strong cigars; nor does he appear to have  devoted to gastronomic matters the attention necessary to nourish such  an abnormally active brain as his. At one time he lived on potatoes  alone for several weeks; at another he saved on his meals to get money  for French lessons; and although he took enough interest in a good  _menu_ to copy it in a letter, he repeatedly laments the time which is  uselessly wasted in eating. Such tenets, combined with his smoking  habit, doubtless helped to shatter his powers, leading finally to the  lunatic asylum and a comparatively early death.    His frequent fits of melancholy may also perhaps be traced in part to  these early habits. Though probably unacquainted with Burton, he held  that \"there is in melancholy sentiments something extremely attractive  and even invigorating to the imagination.\" Attempts were frequently  made by his friends to teach him more sociable habits. Thus, at  Leipsic, \"Dr. Carus's family are anxious to introduce me to  innumerable families--'it would be good for my prospects,' they  think, and so do I, and yet I don't get there, and in fact seldom go  out at all. Indeed, I am often very leathery, dry, disagreeable, and  laugh much inwardly.\" That his apparent coldness and indifference to  his neighbors and friends were due chiefly to his absorption in his  world of ideas, and his consequent want of sympathy with the  artificial usages of society, becomes apparent from this confession,  written to Clara in 1838:    \"I should like to confide to you many other things regarding my  character--how people often wonder that I meet the warmest expressions  of love with coldness and reserve, and often offend and humiliate  precisely those who are most sincerely devoted to me. Often have I  queried and reproached myself for this, for inwardly I acknowledge  even the most trifling favor, understand every wink, every subtle  trait in the heart of another, and yet I so often blunder in what I  say and do.\"    In these melancholy moods nature was his refuge and consolation.  He objected to Leipsic because there were no delights of  nature--\"everything artificially transformed; no valley, no mountain,  where I might revel in my thoughts; no place where I can be alone,  except in the bolted room, with the eternal noise and turmoil below.\"  Although he had but a few intimate friends, he was liked by all the  students, and even enjoyed the name of \"a favorite of the Heidelberg  public.\" One of his intimate friends was Flechsig, but even of him he  paradoxically complains that he is too sympathetic: \"He never cheers  me up; if I am occasionally in a melancholy mood, he ought not to be  the same, and he ought to have sufficient humanity to stir me up.  That I often need cheering up, I know very well.\" Yet he was as often  in a state of extreme happiness and enjoyment of life and his  talents. He even, on occasion, indulged in students' pranks. On his  journey to Heidelberg he induced the postilion to let him take the  reins: \"Thunder! how the horses ran, and how extravagantly happy I  was, and how we stopped at every tavern to get fodder, and how I  entertained the whole company, and how sorry they all were when I  parted from them at Wiesbaden!!\" At Frankfort, one morning, he  writes: \"I felt an extraordinary longing to play on a piano. So I  calmly went to the nearest dealer, told him I was the tutor of a  young English lord who wished to buy a grand piano, and then I  played, to the wonder and delight of the bystanders, for three hours.  I promised to return in two days and inform them if the lord wanted  the instrument; but on that date I was at Ruedesheim, drinking  Ruedesheimer.\" In another place he gives an account of \"a scene  worthy of Van Dyck, and a most genial evening\" he spent with some  students at a tavern filled with peasants. They had some grog, and at  the request of the peasants one of the students declaimed, and  Schumann played. Then a dance was arranged. \"The peasants beat time  with their feet. We were in high spirits, and danced dizzily among  the peasant feet, and finally took a touching farewell of the company  by giving all the peasant girls, Minchen, etc., smacking kisses on  the lips.\"    Were women, like men, afflicted with retrospective jealousy,  Schumann's widow, in editing these letters, would have received a pang  from many other passages revealing Schumann's fondness for the fair  sex. He allowed no good-looking woman to pass him on the street  without taking the opportunity to cultivate his sense of beauty. After  his engagement to Clara he gives her fair warning that he has the  \"very mischievous habit\" of being a great admirer of beautiful women  and girls. \"They make me positively smirk, and I swim in panegyrics on  your sex. Consequently, if at some future time we walk along the  streets of Vienna and meet a beauty, and I exclaim, 'Oh, Clara! see  this heavenly vision,' or something of the sort, you must not be  alarmed nor scold me.\" He had a number of transient passions before he  discovered that Clara was his only true love. There was Nanni, his  \"guardian angel,\" who saved him from the perils of the world and  hovered before his vision like a saint. \"I feel like kneeling before  her and adoring her like a Madonna.\" But Nanni had a dangerous rival  in Liddy. Not long, however, for he found Liddy silly, cold as marble,  and--fatal defect--she could not sympathize with him regarding Jean  Paul. \"The exalted image of my ideal disappears when I think of the  remarks she made about Jean Paul. Let the dead rest in peace.\"    Several of his flames are not alluded to in this correspondence. On  his travels he appears to have had the habit of noting down in his  diary the prevalence and peculiarities of feminine beauty. He  complains that from Mainz to Heidelberg he \"did not see a single  pretty face.\" Yet, as a whole, the Rhine maidens seem to have won his  admiration:    \"What characteristic faces among the lowest classes! On the west shore  of the Rhine the girls have very delicate features, indicating  amiability rather than intelligence; the noses are mostly Greek, the  face very oval and artistically symmetrical, the hair brown; I did not  see a single blonde. The complexion is soft, delicate, with more white  than red; melancholy rather than sanguine. The Frankfort girls, on the  other hand, have in common a sisterly trait--the character of German,  manly, sad earnestness which we often find in our quondam free  cities, and which toward the east gradually merges into a gentle  softness. Characteristic are the faces of all the Frankfort girls:  intellectual or beautiful few of them; the noses mostly Greek, often  snub-noses; the dialect I did not like.\"    The English type of beauty appears to have especially won his  approval. \"When she spoke it sounded like the whispering of angels,\"  he says of an Englishwoman, \"as pretty as a picture,\" whom he met.  Elsewhere he says, laconically: \"On the 24th I arrived at Mainz with  the steamer, in company with twenty to thirty English men and women.  Next day the number of English increased to fifty. If I ever marry, it  must be an English woman.\" Some years later, however, with the  fickleness of genius, he writes about Ernestine, the daughter of a  rich"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/18571"],[0,"The Northmen, Columbus and Cabot, 985-1503 (#16)"],[1,"guage.  The Skrellings put down their bundles then, and loosed them, and offered  their wares [for barter], and were especially anxious to exchange these  for weapons, but Karlsefni forbade his men to sell their weapons, and  taking counsel with himself, he bade the women carry out milk to the  Skrellings, which they no sooner saw, than they wanted to buy it, and  nothing else. Now the outcome of the Skrellings' trading was, that they  carried their wares away in their stomachs, while they left their packs  and peltries behind with Karlsefni and his companions, and having  accomplished this [exchange] they went away. Now it is to be told, that  Karlsefni caused a strong wooden palisade to be constructed and set up  around the house. It was at this time that Gudrid, Karlsefni's wife, gave  birth to a male child, and the boy was called Snorri. In the early part  of the second winter the Skrellings came to them again, and these were  now much more numerous than before, and brought with them the same wares  as at first. Then said Karlsefni to the women: \"Do ye carry out now the  same food, which proved so profitable before, and nought else.\" When they  saw this they cast their packs in over the palisade. Gudrid was sitting  within, in the doorway, beside the cradle of her infant son, Snorri, when  a shadow fell upon the door, and a woman in a black namkirtle entered.  She was short in stature, and wore a fillet about her head; her hair was  of a light chestnut color, and she was pale of hue, and so big-eyed, that  never before had eyes so large been seen in a human skull. She went up to  where Gudrid was seated, and said: \"What is thy name?\" \"My name is  Gudrid; but what is thy name?\" \"My name is Gudrid,\" says she. The  housewife, Gudrid, motioned her with her hand to a seat beside her; but  it so happened, that at that very instant Gudrid heard a great crash,  whereupon the woman vanished, and at that same moment one of the  Skrellings, who had tried to seize their weapons, was killed by one of  Karlsefni's followers. At this the Skrellings fled precipitately, leaving  their garments and wares behind them; and not a soul, save Gudrid alone,  beheld this woman. \"Now we must needs take counsel together,\" says  Karlsefni, \"for that I believe they will visit us a third time, in great  numbers, and attack us. Let us now adopt this plan: ten of our number  shall go out upon the cape, and show themselves there, while the  remainder of our company shall go into the woods and hew a clearing for  our cattle, when the troop approaches from the forest. We will also take  our bull, and let him go in advance of us.\" The lie of the land was such  that the proposed meeting-place had the lake upon the one side, and the  forest upon the other. Karlsefni's advice was now carried into execution.  The Skrellings advanced to the spot which Karlsefni had selected for the  encounter, and a battle was fought there, in which great numbers of the  band of the Skrellings were slain. There was one man among the  Skrellings, of large size and fine bearing, whom Karlsefni concluded must  be their chief. One of the Skrellings picked up an axe, and having looked  at it for a time, he brandished it about one of his companions, and  hewed at him, and on the instant the man fell dead. Thereupon the big man  seized the axe, and after examining it for a moment, he hurled it as far  as he could, out into the sea; then they fled helter-skelter into the  woods, and thus their intercourse came to an end. Karlsefni and his party  remained there throughout the winter, but in the spring Karlsefni  announces, that he is not minded to remain there longer, but will return  to Greenland. They now made ready for the voyage, and carried away with  them much booty in vines and grapes, and peltries. They sailed out upon  the high seas, and brought their ship safely to Ericsfirth, where they  remained during the winter.    _Freydis causes the Brothers to be put to Death._--There was now much  talk anew, about a Wineland-voyage, for this was reckoned both a  profitable and an honorable enterprise. The same summer that Karlsefni  arrived from Wineland, a ship from Norway arrived in Greenland. This ship  was commanded by two brothers, Helgi and Finnbogi, who passed the winter  in Greenland. They were descended from an Icelandic family of the  East-firths. It is now to be added, that Freydis,[62-1] Eric's daughter,  set out from her home at Gardar, and waited upon the brothers, Helgi and  Finnbogi, and invited them to sail with their vessel to Wineland, and to  share with her equally all of the good things which they might succeed in  obtaining there. To this they agreed, and she departed thence to visit  her brother, Leif, and ask him to give her the house which he had caused  to be erected in Wineland, but he made her the same answer [as that which  he had given Karlsefni], saying, that he would lend the house, but not  give it. It was stipulated between Karlsefni and Freydis, that each  should have on shipboard thirty able-bodied men, besides the women; but  Freydis immediately violated this compact, by concealing five men more  [than this number], and this the brothers did not discover before they  arrived in Wineland. They now put out to sea, having agreed beforehand,  that they would sail in company, if possible, and although they were not  far apart from each other, the brothers arrived somewhat in advance, and  carried their belongings up to Leif's house. Now when Freydis arrived,  her ship was discharged, and the baggage carried up to the house,  whereupon Freydis exclaimed: \"Why did you carry your baggage in here?\"  \"Since we believed,\" said they, \"that all promises made to us would be  kept.\" \"It was to me that Leif loaned the house,\" says she, \"and not to  you.\" Whereupon Helgi exclaimed: \"We brothers cannot hope to rival thee  in wrong-dealing.\" They thereupon carried their baggage forth, and built  a hut, above the sea, on the bank of the lake, and put all in order about  it; while Freydis caused wood to be felled, with which to load her ship.  The winter now set in, and the brothers suggested, that they should amuse  themselves by playing games. This they did for a time, until the folk  began to disagree, when dissensions arose between them, and the games  came to an end, and the visits between the houses ceased; and thus it  continued far into the winter. One morning early, Freydis arose from her  bed, and dressed herself, but did not put on her shoes and stockings. A  heavy dew had fallen, and she took her husband's cloak, and wrapped it  about her, and then walked to the brothers' house, and up to the door,  which had been only partly closed by one of the men, who had gone out a  short time before. She pushed the door open, and stood, silently, in the  doorway for a time. Finnbogi, who was lying on the innermost side of the  room, was awake, and said: \"What dost thou wish here, Freydis?\" She  answers: \"I wish thee to rise, and go out with me, for I would speak with  thee.\" He did so, and they walked to a tree, which lay close by the wall  of the house, and seated themselves upon it. \"How art thou pleased here?\"  says she. He answers: \"I am well pleased with the fruitfulness of the  land, but I am ill-content with the breach which has come between us,  for, methinks, there has been no cause for it.\" \"It is even as thou  sayest,\" says she, \"and so it seems to me; but my errand to thee is, that  I wish to exchange ships with you brothers, for that ye have a larger  ship than I, and I wish to depart from here.\" \"To this I must accede,\"  says he; \"if it is thy pleasure.\" Therewith they parted, and she returned  home, and Finnbogi to his bed. She climbed up into bed, and awakened  Thorvard with her cold feet, and he asked her why she was so cold and  wet. She answered, with great passion: \"I have been to the brothers,\"  says she, \"to try to buy their ship, for I wished to have a larger  vessel, but they received my overtures so ill, that they struck me, and  handled me very roughly; what time thou, poor wretch, wilt neither avenge  my shame nor thy own, and I find, perforce, that I am no longer in  Greenland, moreover I shall part from thee unless thou wreakest vengeance  for this.\" And now he could stand her taunts no longer, and ordered the  men to rise at once, and take their weapons, and this they did, and they  then proceeded directly to the house of the brothers, and entered it,  while the folk were asleep, and seized and bound them, and led each one  out, when he was bound; and as they came out, Freydis caused each one to  be slain. In this wise all of the men were put to death, and only the  women were left, and these no one would kill. At this Freydis exclaimed:  \"Hand me an axe!\" This was done, and she fell upon the five women, and  left them dead. They returned home, after this dreadful deed, and it was  very evident that Freydis was well content with her work. She addressed  her companions, saying: \"If it be ordained for us, to come again to  Greenland, I shall contrive the death of any man who shall speak of these  events. We must give it out, that we left them living here, when we came  away.\" Early in the spring, they equipped the ship, which had belonged to  the brothers, and freighted it with all of the products of the land,  which they could obtain, and which the ship would carry. Then they put  out to sea, and, after a prosperous voyage, arrived with their ship in  Ericsfirth early in the summer. Karlsefni was there, with his ship all  ready to sail, and was awaiting a fair wind; and people say, that a ship  richer laden, than that which he commanded, never left Greenland.    _Concerning Freydis._--Freydis now went to her home, since it had  remained unharmed during her absence. She bestowed liberal gifts upon all  of her companions, for she was anxious to screen her guilt. She now  established herself at her home; but her companions"]]]
