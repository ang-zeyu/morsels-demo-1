To the boys it was a weird scene, with the blood-red  glow on the waters and the sense of vastness and of wildness. They  were not afraid, but they could not help a feeling of weariness, and  they edged nearer the hunter for the comfort of his presence. For a  long time they watched, sitting silent; and by-and-by the fires on  the islands died down one by one, until only the flare on the bank  remained as a beacon to those on the river. Then the sound of  paddling drew near again.    Again the whine came from behind the screen of trees, and there was  a rustling among the branches.    Taking a bit of the dried meat he had been eating, Mr. Hume tossed  it through the leaves. There came a sniff, a snap of the jaws, and a  whimper. The hunter shifted his rifle till it pointed through the  boughs.    \"Peace,\" said a low voice.  \"It is Muata and his beast. They hunt me  yet.\"    \"Us also, O chief!\"    The canoes came rushing in. Already some of the crews had landed  near the fire; but others were coming down-stream, hugging the banks  for safety, or, maybe, having a last look for the Englishmen.    \"It is Muata!\" cried Venning, in a joyous whisper. \"Muata and his  jackal. What luck!\"    \"S-sh!\"    A canoe went by some distance out, after it another, and as they  swept into the darkness, a third announced its presence, coming more  slowly and closer in. While it was nearly opposite the hiding the  howl of the jackal rose from out the bush, wringing a startled  exclamation from the two boys by its suddenness.    \"What devil's noise is that?\" sang out a voice they recognized as  that of the Belgian officer.    A sharp order was given, the paddles ceased, and the canoe, looming  long and black on the water, drifted towards the Okapi.    \"I have heard that cry before,\" said a rasping voice. \"Be ready with  your weapons. Allah the merciful may yet deliver those we seek.\"    \"What would they be doing here inshore?\" asked the Belgian.    \"They would be here because it is here they would not expect us to  search. I think I see something gleam.\"    In the water by the shore there was a faint splash, and again the  jackal whined.    Mr. Hume pressed his hand on Compton's shoulder, forcing him into  the well; and he did the same by Venning.    \"Surely,\" said the Belgian, \"it is something. Shall we call in the  other canoes, and guard the place till daylight?\"    \"I will have them now,\" said Hassan, with fury.    \"They will not look on another sun;\" and he gave the order to his  men to kill when they closed in. \"It is they who let free the thief  of the forest--the dog Muata.\"    \"You lie, O woman stealer; Muata freed himself;\" and out of the  water, out of the blackness, came the voice, without warning, \"Muata  is here, by your side, man-thief.\"    The Arab fired, and the flash from his discharged rifle flamed into  the water, into which he peered with features convulsed.    \"Kill him!\" he yelled.    \"Muata!\" cried the paddlers. \"Haw! To the shore, to the shore, or we  perish! The water-wolf, he!\"    \"Yavuma!\" cried the voice from the water; and the canoe heeled over  as the chief rose under the sharp bow. \"Yavuma!\"--he wrenched a  paddle from one of the men and hurled it at the Arab. The crank  craft rolled as some of the excited men in the stem tried to use  their spears. \"Yavuma!\"--this time with a triumphant whoop, and the  canoe turned over!    With a couple of powerful strokes the swimmer had his hand on the  Okapi.    \"O great one,\" he cried, \"Muata is come to work and to watch--to be  your shield and your spear.\"    Mr. Hume reached out a strong hand and pulled the chief on board.    Muata gave a low cry, and with a frightened whimper the jackal shot  out from the bank and lighted on the deck. Then the Okapi slid out  silently into the river.    \"By Jenkins!\" gasped Venning.    \"It beats all,\" laughed Compton. \"Well done, Muata.\"    As the capsized crew struggled to the shore they yelled abuse and  threats, but their power for mischief had gone with the loss of  their weapons. Some of them went off down the bank shouting for the  canoes that had gone on, and others made their way to the fire; but  Mr. Hume and Muata took a spell at the levers, heedless of the noise  made, and under their powerful arms the boat was soon far out in the  waste of waters--safe, at any rate, for that night.        CHAPTER VIII    THE BULLS AND THE WILD DOGS    After an hour or so Muata was sent forward as look-out, and with his  jackal by his side, apparently aiding him in his task, he showed  such eyes for the night that they kept on safely till the morning,  when the sail was hoisted, and by breakfast-time they judged they  had covered about forty miles--quite enough for safety. They ran the  Okapi in among the islands which still stretched away as far as they  could see, and made fast, to eat and to sleep. The noon heat woke  them. They sat up under the awning and talked of the great drive, of  Muata's escape, and of his wonderful luck in finding them--though he  made out that there was nothing strange about it, since from the  woods he had seen the preparations for the hunt, and had, too, made  out the Okapi in the dusk. For the rest, his jackal had scented out  the white man's lair, and all he, the chief, had to do was to upset  the canoe of the Arab.    \"That was no great work for Muata--the otter, the water-wolf,\" he  said.    \"And how did the chief escape?\"    \"Before the shouting arose that Muata was gone, he found a calabash  of fat for the cooking, by the door of a hut. Some fat he rubbed on  the soles of his feet to kill the scent. Then he sent the jackal  into the woods and crawled into a hut, being stiff from the binding.  In the hut he remained, rubbing the fat into the joints, till the  people came back to the feast.\"    \"The feast was made by us, so that while the people ate we could  loosen your bonds.\"    \"Wow! Never yet have I known any to give such thought to a  stranger.\"    \"It is our way to stand by those who stand by us.\"    \"It is a great word that;\" and the chief turned the thought over in  his mind. \"Ow aye! They came again to the feast, and Muata went out  into the woods in peace.\"    \"And was that all?\"    \"There was a man gathering fruit in the morning as I passed through  a garden, and his knife I took.\"    \"And what did the man do?\"    \"He took a message to my father, the chief,\" said Muata,  enigmatically. \"The chief's son has been like a hunted dog. His  stomach hungers for red meat. His spirit thirsts for the hunt. Wow!  O hunter, set your shining boat for the shore, and let us follow the  trail. There be buffalo in the lands beyond the hills which line the  river.\"    \"That's a splendid idea!\" cried Venning.  \"I'm beginning to get  mouldy. A trip ashore would be ripping, now that we have distanced  our pursuers.\"    \"I second that motion,\" said Compton, with a longing glance  shorewards. \"Do you know, sir, that we have not shot a thing since  we entered the Congo?\"    \"I have no objection,\" said the hunter. \"And we must have a good  supply of biltong before we enter the forest; but we cannot afford  to take risks. Just examine the shore for a creek, and at dusk we  will run across.\"    The boys passed the afternoon searching the south bank for signs of  a creek, and in the evening the Okapi shaped her course across to a  likely spot they had marked out. But though they found a creek, it  was not one that commended itself as a hiding to Mr. Hume, and it  was not till after a wearisome hunt for hours in the dark that they  found a channel leading through the hills which he agreed to follow  up; and then, when they had entered about a mile, Muata, with his  jackal, was landed to \"feel\" around for native paths or villages.  Muata, after a long absence, reported all safe as far as he could  judge, and they tied up. In the morning they found themselves in the  thick of the woods, and pushed on down a dark and sluggish stream  strewn with fallen timber, till they came to a pool in a gorge. Here  they resolved to leave their boat.    They took the Okapi to pieces, stowed them away in a dry cavern in  the krantz, covered them with the tarpaulins, and pushed on down  through the gorge on foot, emerging beyond the hills which bordered  the Congo into a rolling country, park-like in appearance. They  studied the land well before they continued, first for signs of  native villages, and next for game. Smoke rose far away to the  right, but nearer, the country seemed deserted, and as plenty of  game appeared in sight, they determined to camp on the slopes of the  hill. So they looked about for a good pitch, and made choice of a  sunny spot at the foot of a rocky cliff, not far from the stream  they had followed, and well screened from view by a thicket of bush  in the front. They stowed away their blankets in a small cave at the  base of the cliff, and then started off for the first hunt, the boys  in a fine state of excitement. They struck into a game-path leading  through thick scrub, and five minutes from the start there was a  sullen snort, a tremendous crashing in the woods, as if, at least, a  herd of elephant were stampeding. Mr. Hume dashed down the game-  path, and before the boys could see what manner of beast it was, he  had fired and bowled it over with a bullet behind the ear.    \"A bit of luck,\" he said, as they reached him.    \"What is it?\" asked Venning, glancing around with bright eyes.    \"A buffalo, over there.\"    The two boys saw a dark form on the ground, half hidden by a bush,  and were running forward.    \"Quietly,\" said the hunter. \"Always approach dangerous game  cautiously when they are down--especially buffalo;\" and with his  finger on the trigger he went up slow-footed.    But the buffalo was stone-dead--a great bull with an immense boss  between the bend of his sharp"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/17636"],[0,"The Mystery at Putnam Hall: The School Chums' Strange Discovery (#16)"],[1,"  those things either.\"    \"Yes, but that was different, Andy,\" said the young major. \"You were on  a public highway, where anybody might pick up the things, supposing you  merely dropped them. But I was right here, where everybody is supposed  to be honest.\"    \"It gives the school a black eye, doesn't it?\"    \"That's it. I know Captain Putnam feels terrible about it, too.\"    \"Do you suspect any of the hired help?\"    \"I don't know what to think.\"    The weather grew colder rapidly, and one morning the cadets arose to  find the ground covered with snow to a depth of several inches.    \"Hurrah!\" shouted Fred. \"See the snow! Doesn't it look inviting?\"    \"Want a roll in it, Fred?\" questioned Bart Field.    \"Not exactly. I was thinking of a snowball fight.\"    \"That's the talk! Let us get up a fight after school hours!\" cried Bart  Conners.    Pepper was at the window. Slyly he raised the sash and scooped up a big  handful of snow from the broad ledge outside. Andy was nearby, bending  over, lacing up his shoe.    \"Welcome to the snow!\" cried The Imp, gaily, and let a portion of the  frozen mass slip down the acrobatic youth's collar.    \"Wow!\" snorted Andy, straightening up with a jerk. \"Hi, you, what do you  take me for, an ice-box?\" And he commenced to squirm as the cold snow  ran down his backbone. Then he made a dive for Pepper and chased The Imp  around the dormitory. Over two of the beds they flew, and then brought  up in a corner with a crash.    \"Have mercy on the furniture!\" cried Joe Nelson.    \"Don't knock over the table!\" added Stuffer.    \"Give me that snow!\" cried Andy, and managed to get a small portion from  Pepper. \"How do you like that?\" And he plastered the snow in The Imp's  left ear.    \"Hurrah! Snow from Snow!\" cried Jack.    \"'Twill warm Pepper's blood, so it will!\" was Emerald Hogan's comment.    More snow had been scooped from the window-sill by Fred and Joe, and  soon a battle-royal was in progress in the dormitory. But it came to an  abrupt end when Dave Kearney appeared.    \"Stop it!\" cried the young sergeant. \"Crabtree is coming!\"    \"All over!\" whispered Jack. \"All as orderly as lambs!\" And at once every  cadet settled down and started in an orderly fashion to finish his  morning toilet.    \"What was the noise in here?\" demanded Josiah Crabtree, as he threw open  the door and strode into the dormitory.    He glared around savagely, but nobody answered him.    \"I demand to know what was going on here!\" he continued.    \"Mr. Crabtree, did you speak to me?\" asked Pepper, meekly.    \"I spoke to you all!\" thundered the teacher. \"What were you doing in  here?\"    \"I am dressing, Mr. Crabtree,\" answered Andy.    \"I am dressing, Mr. Crabtree,\" came from Jack.    \"I am dressing, too,\" put in Fred.    \"And so was I dressing,\" said Stuffer, with a smile.    \"And I was dressing,\" supplemented Pepper. \"Come to think of it, I  rather fancy we were all dressing. You see, we always do dress when we  get up in the morning, Mr. Crabtree,\" he added with a simple smile.    \"I want none of your impudence, Ditmore.\"    \"Oh, dear, was I impudent?\" murmured The Imp. \"I didn't know it. I beg  ten thousand pardons--yes, a million, if you'd rather, sir.\"    \"Be quiet, you--you forward boy! Something was going on in here! If I  find out what it was, I shall punish all of you!\" And having thus  delivered himself, Josiah Crabtree strode out of the dormitory, banging  the door after him.    \"Isn't he an angel!\" murmured Andy.    \"The sweetest teacher that ever grew!\" returned Pepper.    \"I'd like to know how long Captain Putnam will put up with him,\" was  Jack's comment.    \"I don't believe it will be very long,\" answered Fred.    The cadets finished their dressing and hurried below. On account of the  storm the morning drill was held in the gymnasium, and then the young  soldiers marched to the mess-room. On the way several could not resist  the temptation to pick up some snow and throw it at each other.    \"Hi, you stop that!\" roared Reff Ritter, as a snowball took him in the  neck. \"Who threw that?\" he demanded; but nobody answered him. \"I believe  it was you, Ditmore!\" he went on, turning an ugly look on Pepper.    \"That's one for tampering with our bicycles, Ritter,\" retorted Pepper.    It was a chance shot, taken on the spur of the moment, but it told. Reff  Ritter started and turned pale.    \"Who--er--told you I--er--tampered with your bicycles?\" he stammered.    \"Never mind who told me, Ritter. We are going to get square with you,  and don't you forget it.\"    \"Who said I touched 'em?\" grumbled the bully.    \"Never mind about that.\"    \"You are trying to corner me, that what's you are up to!\" grumbled  Ritter. \"But you shan't do it! I never touched your wheels, and you  can't prove that I did. Now don't you throw any more snowballs at me,  or I'll report you.\" And then Ritter hurried into the mess-room as fast  as he could.    Pepper, Jack and Andy looked at each other.    \"He is guilty, I know it!\" said Pepper firmly.    \"I believe you,\" answered the young major; and Andy nodded his head to  show that he agreed with his chums.          CHAPTER XV    THE SNOWBALL BATTLE      \"Now then, fellows, for the greatest snowball battle of the age!\"    \"Here is where Company A smothers Company B!\"    \"Rats! You mean that Company B will bury Company A out of sight!\"    \"Hi, Major Ruddy! What side are you going on?\" queried Bart Conners, who  still commanded Company B.    \"He is coming on our side!\" answered Henry Lee, the captain of the other  company.    \"Well, I can't fight on both sides,\" answered the young major with a  laugh.    \"Go with the company that wins!\" suggested Pepper, with a grin.    \"Toss up a cent for it,\" suggested Andy.    \"All right, I'll toss up,\" answered Jack, and did so, and it was decided  that he should fight with Company B.    \"Good enough!\" cried Pepper, who was in that command. \"Now Company A is  licked, sure!\"    \"Not much!\" was the answer from Stuffer Singleton. \"We'll win, sure!\"    \"We will, unless you stop to eat a doughnut!\" put in Joe Nelson, and at  this remark a general laugh went up, for Stuffer had once lost a  long-distance running race because he stopped on the way to devour some  cookies he had in his pocket.    It was after school hours, and the cadets had gathered on the field  where, during the summer, corn had been raised. It was to be a battle  between the two companies of the school battalion, with the company  captain as leader on each side.    The preliminary rules were speedily arranged. Lines were drawn at either  end of the field, about five hundred feet apart. In the center, about a  hundred feet apart, two other lines were drawn. Along the latter lines  the cadets arranged themselves.    \"Now then, fighting will begin when the school-bell rings out four!\"  cried the cadet who had been made referee. \"The company that chases the  other company over its back line wins the contest. No fighting with  anything but snow allowed. Anybody using his fists, or a stone, or a  lump of ice, will be ruled out of the contest.\"    With all possible speed the young soldiers started to supply themselves  with snowballs, and soon each had ten to twenty in his hands and pockets  and under his arms or at his feet.    \"Get ready!\" shouted Bart, as he glanced hastily at his watch.    \"Give it to 'em hot when the bell rings!\" came from Henry Lee.    Half a minute more and the Hall bell commenced to toll out the hour. The  bell had not yet ceased to ring when there came a grand shower of  snowballs from each company. The shower was so thick that a few of the  snowballs hit each other.    \"Forward!\" shouted Captain Bart.    \"Forward!\" echoed Captain Henry.    And then the two long lines of cadets rushed forward over the  snow-covered field until they were within thirty or forty feet of each  other. Then came another shower of snowballs.    \"Wow!\" yelled one cadet. \"Oh, my nose!\"    \"Caesar's helmet! That hit me in the eye!\" came from another.    \"Say, don't try to knock out all my teeth!\" added a third.    \"Charge!\" yelled the captain of Company A. \"Charge! Get 'em on the run  right now!\"    \"Stand firm!\" came from the commander of Company B. \"Now then, fire!\"    The rush of Company A was met with an extra heavy volley of snowballs.  The cadets staggered under the onslaught and then came to a halt.    \"Now then, up and at 'em!\" yelled Captain Bart. And yelling like wild  Indians, his command charged on Company A. The snowballs flew thick and  fast, and slowly but surely Company A was forced to give ground until it  stood on the line from which it had started. But by that time Company B  was out of ammunition and had to pause to manufacture more snowballs.    In the ranks of Company A were Ritter, Coulter and Paxton. Paxton had of  late somewhat dropped the others, but Reff and Gus were as thick as  ever. They were now standing side by side.    \"Say, I'd like to give it to Ruddy and those others,\" muttered Coulter.    \"So would I,\" whispered Ritter in return. \"Confound 'em, I'd like to  know if they really know the truth about the bicycles.\"    \"I don't see how they found out; nobody was around when you fixed 'em  up.\"    \"Maybe somebody was spying; that sneak of a Mumps, for instance.\"    \"If he was, and told on us, I'll fix him for it.\"    Both cadets were making snowballs near a hollow. As Ritter scraped the  snow up he uncovered several jagged stones.    \"Say, look here!\" he whispered, and pointed at the stones. \"Let's fix  up some special snowballs for Ruddy & Company!\" he added with a knowing  look at his crony.    \"All right; but be careful you are not caught,\" answered Gus Coulter.    Both cadets got down close to the jagged stones and adroitly slipped  several of them into the snowballs they were making.    \"Wait till we are pretty close,\" directed Ritter. \"Then let drive for  all you are worth.\"    \"Who will you aim at?\"    \"Ruddy and Ditmore.\"    \"All right, I'll aim at"]]]
