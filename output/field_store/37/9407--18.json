Ellen had a moment of more than dread.  This keen-eyed, keen-eared  Indian might see right through her brushy covert, might hear the  throbbing of her heart.  It relieved her immeasurably to see him turn  away and take to pacing the promontory, with his head bowed and his  hands behind his back.  He had stopped looking off into the forest.  Presently he wheeled to the west, and by the light upon his face Ellen  saw that the time was near sunset.  Turkeys were beginning to gobble  back on the ridge.    Isbel walked to his horse and appeared to be untying something from the  back of his saddle.  When he came back Ellen saw that he carried a  small package apparently wrapped in paper.  With this under his arm he  strode off in the direction of Ellen's camp and soon disappeared in the  forest.    For a little while Ellen lay there in bewilderment.  If she had made  conjectures before, they were now multiplied.  Where was Jean Isbel  going?  Ellen sat up suddenly.  \"Well, shore this heah beats me,\" she  said.  \"What did he have in that package?  What was he goin' to do with  it?\"    It took no little will power to hold her there when she wanted to steal  after him through the woods and find out what he meant.  But his  reputation influenced even her and she refused to pit her cunning in  the forest against his.  It would be better to wait until he returned  to his horse.  Thus decided, she lay back again in her covert and gave  her mind over to pondering curiosity.  Sooner than she expected she  espied Isbel approaching through the forest, empty handed.  He had not  taken his rifle.  Ellen averted her glance a moment and thrilled to see  the rifle leaning against a rock.  Verily Jean Isbel had been far  removed from hostile intent that day.  She watched him stride swiftly  up to his horse, untie the halter, and mount.  Ellen had an impression  of his arrowlike straight figure, and sinuous grace and ease.  Then he  looked back at the promontory, as if to fix a picture of it in his  mind, and rode away along the Rim.  She watched him out of sight.  What  ailed her? Something was wrong with her, but she recognized only relief.    When Isbel had been gone long enough to assure Ellen that she might  safely venture forth she crawled through the pine thicket to the Rim on  the other side of the point.  The sun was setting behind the Black  Range, shedding a golden glory over the Basin.  Westward the zigzag Rim  reached like a streamer of fire into the sun.  The vast promontories  jutted out with blazing beacon lights upon their stone-walled faces.  Deep down, the Basin was turning shadowy dark blue, going to sleep for  the night.    Ellen bent swift steps toward her camp.  Long shafts of gold preceded  her through the forest.  Then they paled and vanished.  The tips of  pines and spruces turned gold.  A hoarse-voiced old turkey gobbler was  booming his chug-a-lug from the highest ground, and the softer chick of  hen turkeys answered him.  Ellen was almost breathless when she  arrived. Two packs and a couple of lop-eared burros attested to the  fact of Antonio's return.  This was good news for Ellen.  She heard the  bleat of lambs and tinkle of bells coming nearer and nearer.  And she  was glad to feel that if Isbel had visited her camp, most probably it  was during the absence of the herders.    The instant she glanced into her tent she saw the package Isbel had  carried.  It lay on her bed.  Ellen stared blankly.  \"The--the  impudence of him!\" she ejaculated.  Then she kicked the package out of  the tent. Words and action seemed to liberate a dammed-up hot fury.  She kicked the package again, and thought she would kick it into the  smoldering camp-fire.  But somehow she stopped short of that.  She left  the thing there on the ground.    Pepe and Antonio hove in sight, driving in the tumbling woolly flock.  Ellen did not want them to see the package, so with contempt for  herself, and somewhat lessening anger, she kicked it back into the  tent.  What was in it?  She peeped inside the tent, devoured by  curiosity.  Neat, well wrapped and tied packages like that were not  often seen in the Tonto Basin.  Ellen decided she would wait until  after supper, and at a favorable moment lay it unopened on the fire.  What did she care what it contained?  Manifestly it was a gift.  She  argued that she was highly incensed with this insolent Isbel who had  the effrontery to approach her with some sort of present.    It developed that the usually cheerful Antonio had returned taciturn  and gloomy.  All Ellen could get out of him was that the job of sheep  herder had taken on hazards inimical to peace-loving Mexicans.  He had  heard something he would not tell.  Ellen helped prepare the supper and  she ate in silence.  She had her own brooding troubles.  Antonio  presently told her that her father had said she was not to start back  home after dark.  After supper the herders repaired to their own tents,  leaving Ellen the freedom of her camp-fire.  Wherewith she secured the  package and brought it forth to burn.  Feminine curiosity rankled  strong in her breast.  Yielding so far as to shake the parcel and press  it, and finally tear a corner off the paper, she saw some words written  in lead pencil.  Bending nearer the blaze, she read,  \"For my sister  Ann.\" Ellen gazed at the big, bold hand-writing, quite legible and  fairly well done.  Suddenly she tore the outside wrapper completely  off.  From printed words on the inside she gathered that the package  had come from a store in San Francisco.  \"Reckon he fetched home a lot  of presents for his folks--the kids--and his sister,\" muttered Ellen.  \"That was nice of him.  Whatever this is he shore meant it for sister  Ann.... Ann Isbel.  Why, she must be that black-eyed girl I met and  liked so well before I knew she was an Isbel.... His sister!\"    Whereupon for the second time Ellen deposited the fascinating package  in her tent.  She could not burn it up just then.  She had other  emotions besides scorn and hate.  And memory of that soft-voiced,  kind-hearted, beautiful Isbel girl checked her resentment.  \"I wonder  if he is like his sister,\" she said, thoughtfully.  It appeared to be  an unfortunate thought.  Jean Isbel certainly resembled his sister.  \"Too bad they belong to the family that ruined dad.\"    Ellen went to bed without opening the package or without burning it.  And to her annoyance, whatever way she lay she appeared to touch this  strange package.  There was not much room in the little tent.  First  she put it at her head beside her rifle, but when she turned over her  cheek came in contact with it.  Then she felt as if she had been stung.  She moved it again, only to touch it presently with her hand.  Next she  flung it to the bottom of her bed, where it fell upon her feet, and  whatever way she moved them she could not escape the pressure of this  undesirable and mysterious gift.    By and by she fell asleep, only to dream that the package was a  caressing hand stealing about her, feeling for hers, and holding it  with soft, strong clasp.  When she awoke she had the strangest  sensation in her right palm.  It was moist, throbbing, hot, and the  feel of it on her cheek was strangely thrilling and comforting. She lay  awake then.  The night was dark and still.  Only a low moan of wind in  the pines and the faint tinkle of a sheep bell broke the serenity.  She  felt very small and lonely lying there in the deep forest, and, try how  she would, it was impossible to think the same then as she did in the  clear light of day.  Resentment, pride, anger--these seemed abated now.  If the events of the day had not changed her, they had at least brought  up softer and kinder memories and emotions than she had known for long.  Nothing hurt and saddened her so much as to remember the gay, happy  days of her childhood, her sweet mother, her, old home.  Then her  thought returned to Isbel and his gift.  It had been years since anyone  had made her a gift. What could this one be?  It did not matter.  The  wonder was that Jean Isbel should bring it to her and that she could be  perturbed by its presence.  \"He meant it for his sister and so he  thought well of me,\" she said, in finality.    Morning brought Ellen further vacillation.  At length she rolled the  obnoxious package inside her blankets, saying that she would wait until  she got home and then consign it cheerfully to the flames. Antonio tied  her pack on a burro.  She did not have a horse, and therefore had to  walk the several miles, to her father's ranch.    She set off at a brisk pace, leading the burro and carrying her rifle.  And soon she was deep in the fragrant forest.  The morning was clear  and cool, with just enough frost to make the sunlit grass sparkle as if  with diamonds.  Ellen felt fresh, buoyant, singularly full of, life.  Her youth would not be denied.  It was pulsing, yearning.  She hummed  an old Southern tune and every step seemed one of pleasure in action,  of advance toward some intangible future happiness.  All the unknown of  life before her called.  Her heart beat high in her breast and she  walked as one in a dream.  Her thoughts were swift-changing, intimate,  deep, and vague, not of yesterday or to-day, nor of reality.    The big, gray, white-tailed squirrels crossed ahead of her on the  trail, scampered over the piny ground to hop on tree trunks, and there  they paused to watch her pass.  The vociferous little red squirrels  barked and chattered at her.  From every thicket sounded the gobble of  turkeys. The blue jays squalled in the tree tops.  A deer lifted its  head from browsing and stood motionless, with long ears erect, watching  her go by.    Thus happily and dreamily absorbed, Ellen covered the forest miles and  soon reached the trail that led down into the wild brakes of Chevelon"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/20709"],[0,"From Pole to Pole: A Book for Young People (#16)"],[1,"Alps and  Pyrenees. The Pamir is like the body of a cuttlefish, which throws out  arms in all directions. The Pamir and all the huge mountain ranges which  have their roots in this ganglion are the skeleton of Asia, the  framework round which the lowlands cling like masses of muscle. Rivers,  streams, brooks, and rivulets, are the arteries and capillaries of the  Asiatic body. The deserts of the interior are the sickly consumptive  parts of the body where vitality is low, while the peninsulas are the  limbs which facilitate communication between different peoples across  the intervening seas.    In the month of February, 1894, I was at Margelan, which is the capital  of Ferghana, the granary of Central Asia, a rich and fruitful valley  begirt on all sides by mountains. I had got together a small reliable  caravan of eleven horses and three men, one of them being Islam Bay, who  was afterwards to serve me faithfully for many years. We did not need  to take tents with us, for the Governor gave orders to the Kirghizes,  to set up two of their black felt tents wherever I wished to pass the  night. We had a good supply of provisions in our boxes, straw and barley  in sacks, and steel spades, axes, and alpenstocks, for we had to travel  through deep snow, and over smooth, slippery ice. We forgot to procure a  dog, but one came to us on the way, begging to be allowed to follow us.    We march southwards up on to the Pamir, following a narrow valley where  a foaming stream tumbles over ice-draped boulders. We cross it by  narrow, shaking bridges of timber which look like matches when we gaze  down on them in the valley bottom from the slopes above. It thaws in the  sun, but freezes at night, and our path is like a channel of ice running  along the edge of a vertical precipice. We have several Kirghizes with  us to give assistance. One of them leads the first horse, which carries  two large sacks of straw with my tent bed between them. The horse is  shod and can keep his feet on ice, but at one place the path slopes to  the edge. The horse stumbles, tries in vain to recover his foothold,  rolls over the edge, falls into the chasm, and breaks his back on the  bank of the river. The straw is scattered among the stones, my bed  dances along the stream, and all the men rush down to save what they  can.    Now steps are cut in the ice and the path is strewn with sand. The  higher we go the worse the travelling. A Kirghiz leads each horse by the  bridle, while another holds on to his tail to help him if he stumbles.  To ride is impossible; we crawl along on hands and feet. Darkness  follows twilight; the rushing water of the stream gives forth a sound of  metallic clearness. We have been travelling more than twelve hours when  at last the valley opens, and we see blazing camp fires in front of  Kirghiz tents.    We mount higher day after day. We cross a pass, and at this giddy height  I experience the unpleasant feelings of mountain sickness--splitting  headache, nausea, and singing in the ears. On the further side one of  the affluents of the Amu-darya flows westwards. This valley, the Alai,  is broad and open, but full of snow in winter. We make our entry into  the Alai valley in a howling snowstorm and wade and plunge through  drifts. Two Kirghizes go in front with sticks to mark out the way, in  order that the horses may not sink in the snow. Our little caravan moves  slowly and painfully. One day the snow is so deep that we have to hire  four camels, which are led in front of the caravan to tramp out a  narrow path for the horses. Everything is white, sky and earth run into  one another, and there is nothing black to be seen but the men, camels,  and horses.    At every camp we find excellent felt tents set up in readiness for us.  Once we had only a short distance to go before reaching camp when we  were stopped by a trench filled with snow ten feet deep. The first horse  disappeared in a moment as though he had fallen through a trap-door. His  load was taken off, and he was pulled up with ropes. Then the Kirghizes  thought of a grand way of getting over the treacherous snow. They took  the felt covers of the tent and spread them over the snow and led the  horses one by one over this yielding bridge.    All this journey we waded and plunged through snowdrifts. One day I sent  a horseman on in front to examine the road, and only the horse's head  and the rider could be seen above the snow. Another time there was no  Kirghiz tent as usual, and we bivouacked round a fire behind a wall of  snow in a temperature of 29 deg. below freezing-point. The Kirghizes who  should have furnished us with a tent had been delayed on a pass by an  avalanche of snow which overwhelmed forty sheep. Six men had struggled  on to meet us, but two had stuck fast and were abandoned in the snow. Of  the four who arrived in a sorry condition, one had his foot frozen and  another had become snow-blind. The Kirghizes usually protect their eyes  by a long lock of horse-hair hanging down over the forehead from beneath  the cap, or blacken the eye cavities and nose with charcoal.    Wolves swarm in these mountains, and we often saw the spoor of these  blood-thirsty robbers. Hunger makes them very daring, and they do great  damage to the flocks of the Kirghizes, as they will kill even when they  do not wish to eat. A single wolf had recently worried 180 sheep  belonging to a Kirghiz. A travelling Kirghiz was attacked in this  neighbourhood by a pack of wolves, and when the body was found a couple  of days later only the skull and skeleton were left. Another Kirghiz,  who was mounted, was attacked and killed, horse and all. Two of my  guides had fallen in with twelve wolves the winter before, but  fortunately they were armed and killed two of them, which were at once  devoured by their comrades.    It is not difficult to imagine the terrible plight of an unarmed Kirghiz  attacked by wolves. They track him by scent and pursue him. Their  wicked eyes glow with fury and blood-thirstiness. They wrinkle up their  upper lips to leave their fangs exposed. Their dripping tongues hang out  of their jaws. The traveller hears their sneaking steps behind him, and  turning round can distinguish in the dusk their grey coats against the  white snow. He grows cold with fright, and putting up a prayer to Allah,  springs and dashes through the drifts in the hope of reaching the  nearest village of tents.    Every now and again the wolves halt and utter their awful prolonged  howl, but in an instant they are after the man again. Every minute they  become bolder. The man flies for his life. They know that he cannot hold  out long. Now they catch hold of a corner of his fur coat, but let go  when he throws his cap at them. They pounce upon it and tear it in  pieces. This only whets their appetites. The poor man staggers on until  he can hardly put one foot before another, and is almost at his last  gasp. This is the moment, and the wolves throw themselves upon him from  all sides. He screams, and fights with his hands; he draws out his knife  and stabs into the pack in front of him, but a large wolf springs upon  him from behind and brings him to the ground. There he has at any rate  his back protected, but the eyes and teeth of the wolves gleam above him  in the darkness, and he stabs at them with his knife. They know that he  will tire of this game soon. Two wolves tear open his boots to get at  his feet. He cannot reach them with his knife, so he sits up, and at the  same moment the leader seizes him by the neck so that the blood spurts  out over the white snow. The wolves have now tasted blood and nothing  can restrain them. The man is beside himself and throws himself about  thrusting desperately with his knife. The wolves attack him from behind  and he falls again on his back. Now his knife moves more slowly. The  wolves yelp, bark and pant, and the froth hangs round their teeth. The  unfortunate man's eyes grow dim and he closes them, consciousness leaves  him and he drops the knife from his hand, and the largest wolf is about  to plunge his fangs into his throat. But suddenly the leader stops and  utters a short bark, which in wolf's language is equivalent to an oath,  for at the foot of an adjacent hill are seen two mounted Kirghizes, who  have come out to seek their comrade. The wolves disappear like magic.  The poor man lies quite motionless in his tattered furs, and the snow  around is stained red with blood. He is unconscious, but is still  breathing and his heart beats. His friends bind up his wounds with  their girdles and carry him on the back of a horse to the tent, where he  soon comes back to life beside the flames of the evening fire.    Of course the Kirghiz must hate wolves. But the animals are cunning and  seldom expose themselves to gunshot. Woe to the wolf that is wounded or  caught! He is not killed, but the most cruel tortures are devised for  him.    When heavy winter snow falls in the Alai valley, the wolves return to  the higher wilds of the Pamir where the snow lies less deep, and here  they chase the wild sheep, _Ovis Poli_, as it is named after its  discoverer, Marco Polo. It has large, round, elegantly curved horns and  is somewhat larger than the wild sheep of Tibet. The wolves chase Marco  Polo's sheep by a cunningly devised method. They hunt up a herd and  single out some less cautious or less quick-footed member. This animal  is forced by a watch posted ready beforehand to take refuge on a  projecting rock which is surrounded by wolves. If they can get up to the  sheep they take him easily, but if not, they wait till his legs give way  with weariness and he falls into the jaws of his pursuers.    Many a time I have met wolves in various parts of Asia, and many sheep,  mules, and horses of mine have they destroyed. How often has their  dismal howl sounded outside my tent, as though they were calling for my  flesh and blood!    We had "]]]
