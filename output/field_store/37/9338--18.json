Thus it  was that Christ broke the Sabbath and forbade divorce. After Christ four  disciples, among whom were Peter and Paul, permitted the use of animal  food forbidden by the Bible, except the eating of those animals which had  been strangled, or which were sacrificed to idols, and of blood.(84) They  also forbade fornication. They maintained these four commandments.  Afterward, Paul permitted even the eating of strangled animals, those  sacrificed to idols, and blood, and only maintained the prohibition of  fornication. So in chapter 14, verse 14 of his Epistle to the Romans, Paul  writes: \"I know, and am persuaded by the Lord Jesus, that there is nothing  unclean of itself: but to him that esteemeth any thing to be unclean, to  him it is unclean.\"    Also in the Epistle of Paul to Titus, chapter 1, verse 15: \"Unto the pure  all things are pure: but unto them that are defiled and unbelieving is  nothing pure; but even their mind and conscience is defiled.\"    Now this change, these alterations and this abrogation are due to the  impossibility of comparing the time of Christ with that of Moses. The  conditions and requirements in the later period were entirely changed and  altered. The former laws were, therefore, abrogated.    The existence of the world may be compared to that of a man, and the  Prophets and Messengers of God to skillful doctors. The human being cannot  remain in one condition: different maladies occur which have each a  special remedy. The skillful physician does not give the same medicine to  cure each disease and each malady, but he changes remedies and medicines  according to the different necessities of the diseases and constitutions.  One person may have a severe illness caused by fever, and the skilled  doctor will give him cooling remedies; and when at some other time the  condition of this person has changed, and fever is replaced by chills,  without doubt the skilled doctor will discard cooling medicine and permit  the use of heating drugs. This change and alteration is required by the  condition of the patient and is an evident proof of the skill of the  physician.    Consider, could the Law of the Old Testament be enforced at this epoch and  time? No, in the name of God! it would be impossible and impracticable;  therefore, most certainly God abrogated the laws of the Old Testament at  the time of Christ. Reflect, also, that baptism in the days of John the  Baptist was used to awaken and admonish the people to repent from all sin,  and to watch for the appearance of the Kingdom of Christ. But at present  in Asia, the Catholics and the Orthodox Church plunge newly born children  into water mixed with olive oil, and many of them become ill from the  shock; at the time of baptism they struggle and become agitated. In other  places, the clergy sprinkle the water of baptism on the forehead. But  neither from the first form nor from the second do the children derive any  spiritual benefit. Then what result is obtained from this form? Other  peoples are amazed and wonder why the infant is plunged into the water,  since this is neither the cause of the spiritual awakening of the child,  nor of its faith or conversion, but it is only a custom which is followed.  In the time of John the Baptist it was not so; no, at first John used to  exhort the people, and to guide them to repentance from sin, and to fill  them with the desire to await the manifestation of Christ. Whoever  received the ablution of baptism, and repented of sins in absolute  humility and meekness, would also purify and cleanse his body from outward  impurities. With perfect yearning, night and day, he would constantly wait  for the manifestation of Christ, and the entrance to the Kingdom of the  Spirit of God.(85)    To recapitulate: our meaning is that the change and modification of  conditions, and the altered requirements of different centuries and times,  are the cause of the abrogation of laws. For a time comes when these laws  are no longer suitably adapted to conditions. Consider how very different  are the requirements of the first centuries, of the Middle Ages, and of  modern times. Is it possible that the laws of the first centuries could be  enforced at present? It is evident that it would be impossible and  impracticable. In the same manner, after the lapse of a few centuries, the  requirements of the present time will not be the same as those of the  future, and certainly there will be change and alteration. In Europe the  laws are unceasingly altered and modified; in bygone years, how many laws  existed in the organizations and systems of Europe, which are now  abrogated! These changes and alterations are due to the variation and  mutation of thought, conditions and customs. If it were not so, the  prosperity of the world of humanity would be wrecked.    For example, there is in the Pentateuch a law that if anyone break the  Sabbath, he shall be put to death. Moreover, there are ten sentences of  death in the Pentateuch. Would it be possible to keep these laws in our  time? It is clear that it would be absolutely impossible. Consequently,  there are changes and modifications in the laws, and these are a  sufficient proof of the supreme wisdom of God.    This subject needs deep thought. Then the cause of these changes will be  evident and apparent.    Blessed are those who reflect!          21: THE SYMBOLISM OF THE BREAD AND THE WINE      Question.--The Christ said: \"I am the living bread which came down from  heaven, that a man may eat thereof and not die.\"(86) What is the meaning  of this utterance?    Answer.--This bread signifies the heavenly food and divine perfections. So,  \"If any man eateth of this bread\" means if any man acquires heavenly  bounty, receives the divine light, or partakes of Christ's perfections, he  thereby gains everlasting life. The blood also signifies the spirit of  life and the divine perfections, the lordly splendor and eternal bounty.  For all the members of the body gain vital substance from the circulation  of the blood.    In the Gospel of St. John, chapter 6, verse 26, it is written: \"Ye seek  Me, not because ye saw the miracles, but because ye did eat of the loaves,  and were filled.\"    It is evident that the bread of which the disciples ate and were filled  was the heavenly bounty; for in verse 33 of the same chapter it is said:  \"For the bread of God is He which cometh down from heaven, and giveth life  unto the world.\" It is clear that the body of Christ did not descend from  heaven, but it came from the womb of Mary; and that which descended from  the heaven of God was the spirit of Christ. As the Jews thought that  Christ spoke of His body, they made objections, for it is said in the 42nd  verse of the same chapter: \"And they said, Is not this Jesus, the son of  Joseph, whose father and mother we know? how is it then that he saith, I  came down from heaven?\"    Reflect how clear it is that what Christ meant by the heavenly bread was  His spirit, His bounties, His perfections and His teachings; for it is  said in the 63rd verse: \"It is the spirit that quickeneth; the flesh  profiteth nothing.\"    Therefore, it is evident that the spirit of Christ is a heavenly grace  which descends from heaven; whosoever receives light from that spirit in  abundance--that is to say, the heavenly teachings--finds everlasting life.  That is why it is said in the 35th verse: \"And Jesus said unto them, I am  the bread of life: he that cometh to Me shall never hunger; and he that  believeth on Me shall never thirst.\"    Notice that \"coming to Him\" He expresses as eating, and \"belief in Him\" as  drinking. Then it is evident and established that the celestial food is  the divine bounties, the spiritual splendors, the heavenly teachings, the  universal meaning of Christ. To eat is to draw near to Him, and to drink  is to believe in Him. For Christ had an elemental body and a celestial  form. The elemental body was crucified, but the heavenly form is living  and eternal, and the cause of everlasting life; the first was the human  nature, and the second is the divine nature. It is thought by some that  the Eucharist is the reality of Christ, and that the Divinity and the Holy  Spirit descend into and exist in it. Now when once the Eucharist is taken,  after a few moments it is simply disintegrated and entirely transformed.  Therefore, how can such a thought be conceived? God forbid! certainly it  is an absolute fantasy.    To conclude: through the manifestation of Christ, the divine teachings,  which are an eternal bounty, were spread abroad, the light of guidance  shone forth, and the spirit of life was conferred on man. Whoever found  guidance became living; whoever remained lost was seized by enduring  death. This bread which came down from heaven was the divine body of  Christ, His spiritual elements, which the disciples ate, and through which  they gained eternal life.    The disciples had taken many meals from the hand of Christ; why was the  last supper distinguished from the others? It is evident that the heavenly  bread did not signify this material bread, but rather the divine  nourishment of the spiritual body of Christ, the divine graces and  heavenly perfections of which His disciples partook, and with which they  became filled.    In the same way, reflect that when Christ blessed the bread and gave it to  His disciples, saying, \"This is My body,\"(87) and gave grace to them, He  was with them in person, in presence, and form. He was not transformed  into bread and wine; if He had been turned into bread and wine, He could  not have remained with the disciples in body, in person and in presence.    Then it is clear that the bread and wine were symbols which signified: I  have given you My bounties and perfections, and when you have received  this bounty, you have"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/1929"],[0,"The School for Scandal (#16)"],[1,"rged----    SIR BENJAMIN. I heard nothing of this----    CRABTREE. Sir Peter forced Charles to take one and they fired--it seems  pretty nearly together--Charles's shot took Place as I tell you--and Sir  Peter's miss'd--but what is very extraordinary the Ball struck against  a little Bronze Pliny that stood over the Fire Place--grazed out of the  window at a right angle--and wounded the Postman, who was just coming to  the Door with a double letter from Northamptonshire.    SIR BENJAMIN. My Unkle's account is more circumstantial I must  confess--but I believe mine is the true one for all that.    LADY SNEERWELL. I am more interested in this Affair than they  imagine--and must have better information.--         [Exit.]    SIR BENJAMIN. Ah! Lady Sneerwell's alarm is very easily accounted for.--    CRABTREE. Yes yes, they certainly DO say--but that's neither here nor  there.    MRS. CANDOUR. But pray where is Sir Peter at present----    CRABTREE. Oh! they--brought him home and He is now in the House, tho'  the Servants are order'd to deny it----    MRS. CANDOUR. I believe so--and Lady Teazle--I suppose attending him----    CRABTREE. Yes yes--and I saw one of the Faculty enter just before me----    SIR BENJAMIN. Hey--who comes here----    CRABTREE. Oh, this is He--the Physician depend on't.    MRS. CANDOUR. O certainly it must be the Physician and now we shall  know----         Enter SIR OLIVER    CRABTREE. Well, Doctor--what Hopes?    MRS. CANDOUR. Aye Doctor how's your Patient?    SIR BENJAMIN. Now Doctor isn't it a wound with a small sword----    CRABTREE. A bullet lodged in the Thorax--for a hundred!    SIR OLIVER. Doctor!--a wound with a small sword! and a Bullet in the  Thorax!--oon's are you mad, good People?    SIR BENJAMIN. Perhaps, Sir, you are not a Doctor.    SIR OLIVER. Truly Sir I am to thank you for my degree If I am.    CRABTREE. Only a Friend of Sir Peter's then I presume--but, sir, you  must have heard of this accident--    SIR OLIVER. Not a word!    CRABTREE. Not of his being dangerously wounded?    SIR OLIVER. The Devil he is!    SIR BENJAMIN. Run thro' the Body----    CRABTREE. Shot in the breast----    SIR BENJAMIN. By one Mr. Surface----    CRABTREE. Aye the younger.    SIR OLIVER. Hey! what the plague! you seem to differ strangely in your  accounts--however you agree that Sir Peter is dangerously wounded.    SIR BENJAMIN. Oh yes, we agree in that.    CRABTREE. Yes, yes, I believe there can be no doubt in that.    SIR OLIVER. Then, upon my word, for a person in that Situation, he is  the most imprudent man alive--For here he comes walking as if nothing at  all was the matter.         Enter SIR PETER    Odd's heart, sir Peter! you are come in good time I promise you, for we  had just given you over!    SIR BENJAMIN. 'Egad, Uncle this is the most sudden Recovery!    SIR OLIVER. Why, man, what do you do out of Bed with a Small Sword  through your Body, and a Bullet lodg'd in your Thorax?    SIR PETER. A Small Sword and a Bullet--    SIR OLIVER. Aye these Gentlemen would have kill'd you without Law or  Physic, and wanted to dub me a Doctor to make me an accomplice.    SIR PETER. Why! what is all this?    SIR BENJAMIN. We rejoice, Sir Peter, that the Story of the Duel is not  true--and are sincerely sorry for your other Misfortune.    SIR PETER. So--so--all over the Town already! [Aside.]    CRABTREE. Tho', Sir Peter, you were certainly vastly to blame to marry  at all at your years.    SIR PETER. Sir, what Business is that of yours?    MRS. CANDOUR. Tho' Indeed, as Sir Peter made so good a Husband, he's  very much to be pitied.    SIR PETER. Plague on your pity, Ma'am, I desire none of it.    SIR BENJAMIN. However Sir Peter, you must not mind the Laughing and  jests you will meet with on the occasion.    SIR PETER. Sir, I desire to be master in my own house.    CRABTREE. 'Tis no Uncommon Case, that's one comfort.    SIR PETER. I insist on being left to myself, without ceremony,--I insist  on your leaving my house directly!    MRS. CANDOUR. Well, well, we are going and depend on't, we'll make the  best report of you we can.    SIR PETER. Leave my house!    CRABTREE. And tell how hardly you have been treated.    SIR PETER. Leave my House--    SIR BENJAMIN. And how patiently you bear it.    SIR PETER. Friends! Vipers! Furies! Oh that their own Venom would choke  them!    SIR OLIVER. They are very provoking indeed, Sir Peter.         Enter ROWLEY    ROWLEY. I heard high words: what has ruffled you Sir Peter--    SIR PETER. Pshaw what signifies asking--do I ever pass a Day without my  Vexations?    SIR OLIVER. Well I'm not Inquisitive--I come only to tell you, that I  have seen both my Nephews in the manner we proposed.    SIR PETER. A Precious Couple they are!    ROWLEY. Yes and Sir Oliver--is convinced that your judgment was right  Sir Peter.    SIR OLIVER. Yes I find Joseph is Indeed the Man after all.    ROWLEY. Aye as Sir Peter says, He's a man of Sentiment.    SIR OLIVER. And acts up to the Sentiments he professes.    ROWLEY. It certainly is Edification to hear him talk.    SIR OLIVER. Oh, He's a model for the young men of the age! But how's  this, Sir Peter? you don't Join us in your Friend Joseph's Praise as I  expected.    SIR PETER. Sir Oliver, we live in a damned wicked world, and the fewer  we praise the better.    ROWLEY. What do YOU say so, Sir Peter--who were never mistaken in your  Life?    SIR PETER. Pshaw--Plague on you both--I see by your sneering you have  heard--the whole affair--I shall go mad among you!    ROWLEY. Then to fret you no longer Sir Peter--we are indeed acquainted  with it all--I met Lady Teazle coming from Mr. Surface's so humbled,  that she deigned to request ME to be her advocate with you--    SIR PETER. And does Sir Oliver know all too?    SIR OLIVER. Every circumstance!    SIR PETER. What of the closet and the screen--hey[?]    SIR OLIVER. Yes yes--and the little French Milliner. Oh, I have been  vastly diverted with the story! ha! ha! ha!    SIR PETER. 'Twas very pleasant!    SIR OLIVER. I never laugh'd more in my life, I assure you: ha! ha!    SIR PETER. O vastly diverting! ha! ha!    ROWLEY. To be sure Joseph with his Sentiments! ha! ha!    SIR PETER. Yes his sentiments! ha! ha! a hypocritical Villain!    SIR OLIVER. Aye and that Rogue Charles--to pull Sir Peter out of the  closet: ha! ha!    SIR PETER. Ha! ha! 'twas devilish entertaining to be sure--    SIR OLIVER. Ha! ha! Egad, Sir Peter I should like to have seen your Face  when the screen was thrown down--ha! ha!    SIR PETER. Yes, my face when the Screen was thrown down: ha! ha! ha! O I  must never show my head again!    SIR OLIVER. But come--come it isn't fair to laugh at you neither my old  Friend--tho' upon my soul I can't help it--    SIR PETER. O pray don't restrain your mirth on my account: it does not  hurt me at all--I laugh at the whole affair myself--Yes--yes--I  think being a standing Jest for all one's acquaintance a very happy  situation--O yes--and then of a morning to read the Paragraphs about  Mr. S----, Lady T----, and Sir P----, will be so entertaining!--I shall  certainly leave town tomorrow and never look mankind in the Face again!    ROWLEY. Without affectation Sir Peter, you may despise the ridicule of  Fools--but I see Lady Teazle going towards the next Room--I am sure you  must desire a Reconciliation as earnestly as she does.    SIR OLIVER. Perhaps MY being here prevents her coming to you--well I'll  leave honest Rowley to mediate between you; but he must bring you all  presently to Mr. Surface's--where I am now returning--if not to reclaim  a Libertine, at least to expose Hypocrisy.    SIR PETER. Ah! I'll be present at your discovering yourself there with  all my heart; though 'tis a vile unlucky Place for discoveries.    SIR OLIVER. However it is very convenient to the carrying on of my Plot  that you all live so near one another!         [Exit SIR OLIVER.]    ROWLEY. We'll follow--    SIR PETER. She is not coming here you see, Rowley--    ROWLEY. No but she has left the Door of that Room open you  perceive.--see she is in Tears--!    SIR PETER. She seems indeed to wish I should go to her.--how dejected  she appears--    ROWLEY. And will you refrain from comforting her--    SIR PETER. Certainly a little mortification appears very becoming in a  wife--don't you think it will do her good to let her Pine a little.    ROWLEY. O this is ungenerous in you--    SIR PETER. Well I know not what to think--you remember Rowley the Letter  I found of her's--evidently intended for Charles?    ROWLEY. A mere forgery, Sir Peter--laid in your way on Purpose--this is  one of the Points which I intend Snake shall give you conviction on--    SIR PETER. I wish I were once satisfied of that--She looks this  way----what a remarkably elegant Turn of the Head she has! Rowley I'll  go to her--    ROWLEY. Certainly--    SIR PETER. Tho' when it is known that we are reconciled, People will  laugh at me ten times more!    ROWLEY. Let--them laugh--and retort their malice only by showing them  you are happy in spite of it.    SIR PETER. Efaith so I will--and, if I'm not mistaken we may yet be the  happiest couple in the country--    ROWLEY. Nay Sir Peter--He who once lays aside suspicion----    SIR PETER. Hold Master Rowley--if you have any Regard for me--never let  me hear you utter anything like a Sentiment. I have had enough of THEM  to serve me the rest of my Life.         [Exeunt.]          SCENE THE LAST.--The Library         SURFACE and LADY SNEERWELL    LADY SNEERWELL. Impossible! will not Sir Peter immediately be reconciled  to CHARLES? and of consequence no longer oppose his union with MARIA?  the thought is Distraction to me!    SURFACE. Can Passion--furnish a Remedy?    LADY SNEERWELL. No--nor cunning either. O I was a Fool, an Ideot--to  league with such a Blunderer!    SURFACE. Surely Lady Sneerwell I am the greatest Sufferer--yet you see I  bear the accident with Calmness.    LADY SNEERWELL. "]]]
