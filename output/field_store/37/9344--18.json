Then one young fellow, who was always worrying, said:  \"Supposing she should come out of the barn now! Supposing she should  come right toward this corn-crib! Supposing she should stand right under  the floor! Supposing she should catch us as we jumped down!  Supposing----\"    But here the other young Mice all squeaked to him to stop, and one of  them declared that it made her fur stand on end to think of it. The  Oldest Mouse spoke quite sharply. \"Supposing,\" said he to the first  young Mouse, \"you should eat more and talk less. There are enough  pleasant things to speak about without scaring all your friends in this  way.\"    The young Mouse who said that her fur stood on end couldn't eat anything  more, she was so frightened. \"What could we do,\" she said, \"if the Cat  should come?\"    \"Stay right where we are,\" answered her mother. \"She couldn't reach us  with the door closed. Now go on with your eating and don't be foolish.\"    A Rat ran up the board. \"Good-morning,\" said he. \"Have you heard the  news?\"    \"No, no!\" cried the Mice, hurrying to that side of the corn-crib, and  peeping through the crack.    \"The Yellow Kitten has been hunting with her mother, and they say that  her brother is going to-night.\"    \"Well,\" said a mother Mouse, \"I knew we would have to expect it, but I  did hope they would wait a while. Now, children,\" she added, \"do be  careful! I know that when you are looking for food you have to go into  dangerous places, but don't stop there to talk or to clean your fur.  Find safe corners for that, or I shall worry about you all the time.\"    \"We will,\" squeaked all the little Mice together. \"We will be very, very  careful.\"    \"Thank you for the news,\" said the Oldest Mouse to the Rat. \"We will try  to send you word of new dangers when we hear of them.\"    The Rat, who was a fine young fellow, ran down the board and away. They  could not ask him in to lunch, because he was too large and stout to  squeeze through the cracks, but he understood how it was, and knew that  he could find food elsewhere. Now he ran to the Pig-pen to snatch a  share of the breakfast which the farmer had just left there. He often  did this as soon as the farmer went away, and the Pigs never troubled  him. Perhaps that was because they knew that if they drove him away when  he came alone, he would bring all his sisters and his cousins and his  aunts, and his brothers and his uncles too, the next time, and would  eat every bit of food they had.    After he had taken a hearty breakfast, he ran under the edge of the barn  to clean himself. He was always very particular about this. His mother  had taught him when very small that he must keep his fur well brushed  and his face washed, and he did it just as a Cat would, by wetting his  paws and scrubbing his face and the top of his head. He brushed his fur  coat with his paws also.    While he was here, one of his cousins came from the barn above. She ran  down the inside of the wall, head foremost, and her hind feet were  turned around until they pointed backward. That let her hold on with her  long, sharp claws, quite as a Squirrel does, and kept her from tumbling.  She was much out of breath when she reached the ground, but it was not  from running.    \"What do you think that farmer has done now?\" she cried. \"It was bad  enough for him to nail tin over the holes we gnawed into his grain-bins,  but this is worse still. It needn't make us so much trouble, but it  hurts my feelings.\"    \"What is it?\" asked her cousin.    \"A trap!\" said she. \"A horrible, shining trap. The Rat from the other  farm told me about it. It lies open and flat on the floor of a  grain-bin,--the very one you and I gnawed into last night,--and there is  a lovely piece of cheese in the middle of it. The Rat who told me about  it says that as soon as one touches the cheese, the trap springs shut on  him.\"    \"Bah!\" exclaimed the young Rat who had just eaten breakfast in the  Pig-pen. \"Let it stay there! We don't have to touch it, although I do  mean to look at it some time. I believe in knowing about things.\"    \"I wish you wouldn't look at it,\" said his cousin, who was very fond of  him.    \"The Rat from the other farm says it is very dangerous to even look at  traps, especially if your stomach is empty.\"    \"Then the Rat from the other farm might better keep away,\" said this  young fellow, as he put one paw up to see that his whiskers were all  right. \"I don't think very much of him anyway. He thinks he knows  everything because he has travelled. I wish you would have nothing to do  with him. I dare say you were in the grain-bin with him when you saw the  trap.\"    \"Yes,\" said she, \"I was.\"    \"Well,\" said he, \"you both got away safely, and I shall too. I may not  be very clever, but I think I do know enough to keep out of a trap.\"  Then he turned into his hole and went to sleep. He had been running  around all night, and was very tired. He was cross, too. This was the  second time that his cousin had told him what the Rat from the other  farm had said, and he thought she liked him altogether too well.    When he awakened, it was night again and he was aroused by the stamping  of the Dappled Gray on the floor above his head. For a minute he could  hardly think where he was. Then it all came to him. He was in his own  cozy little hole under the barn, and it was night. He remembered  something about the Yellow Kitten. What was it? Oh yes, she had begun  hunting. Well, he was not afraid of her yet. But there was something  else--the trap! He wondered if his cousin were in that bin again. As  like as not her friend, the Rat from the other farm, was showing her the  trap now. He would go up there himself, and at once, too.    He ran up the wall, through an opening, and across the barn floor to the  grain-bin. It was a moonlight night and the barn was not very dark. The  cover of the bin was raised. Perhaps the farmer's man had forgotten to  close it. Perhaps there was so little grain left in it that the man  didn't care to. At any rate, he could now see the trap quite plainly.  There was nobody else in the bin, and he went close to it.    \"I would not touch it for anything,\" said he, as he entered the bin,  \"but it will not hurt me to look at it.\"    When he went nearer, he was very careful to see that his tail did not  even brush against the chain which held the trap down. \"So that is the  terrible, dangerous trap?\" said he. \"It doesn't look particularly  dreadful. That is fine-smelling cheese though.\" He sniffed two or three  times. \"I have tasted cheese only once in my whole life,\" said he, \"and  I am almost starved now. I wouldn't mind a nibble at that.\" He looked at  it and thought about it until it seemed to him he could not go away and  leave that cheese there.    Then he thought, \"If I am very careful to step over these shining steel  things and rest my feet only on the floor, it cannot spring the trap.  Then I will snatch the cheese and jump.... I am pretty sure I can do  it.... Why, yes, I know I can.\" So the Rat who had come just to look at  the trap, began to lift first one foot and then another over the shining  curved bars, and got all ready to catch up the cheese and run.    \"Now!\" he cried. \"One, two, three!\" He did snatch it and jump, but the  trap jumped, too, in its own trappy way, and the Rat who got the cheese  left the three tip rings of his tail to pay for it. \"Ouch!\" he cried.  \"My tail! My tail! My beautiful, long, bony tail, all covered with  scales and short hair!\" He did not care at all for the cheese now. He  did not want to see it, for he would rather have had the point on his  tail again than to eat a whole binful of cheese.    \"How it will look!\" said he. \"So stumpy and blunt. And it has been so  very useful always. I could wind it around a stick to hold myself up  when my paws were full, and many a time I have rolled eggs across the  floor by curling it around them.\" Then he heard Rat voices and scampered  out and down to his own hole.    His cousin and the Rat from the other farm came into the bin. \"Don't  look at the trap,\" he was saying, \"but just eat your grain from the  farther corner.\"    \"I won't,\" she answered, and she half closed her eyes to keep from  seeing it. He was beside her and they stumbled over the cheese, which  now lay on the floor away from the trap. \"How does this happen?\" said  he. \"We will eat it first and then find out.\" By this advice he showed  that he was a Rat of excellent sense.    When they had eaten it, they began to look toward the trap. As there was  no longer any cheese in it to tempt them, they felt perfectly safe in  doing so. They found that it had been sprung, and there lay the last  three rings of some Rat's tail.    \"How dreadful!\" she exclaimed. \"I hope that was not lost by any of our  friends.\"    \"Hum-hum!\" said the Rat from the other farm. \"Now, whom have I seen  wearing that? I have certainly seen that tail before--it was your  cousin!\"    \"Poor fellow!\" said she. \"I must go to see him.\"    \"Oh, don't go now,\" cried the Rat from the other farm. \"I think he might  want to be alone for a while. Besides,\" he added coaxingly, \"you haven't  tasted of the grain yet, and it is very good.\"    \"W-well,\" answered she, \"perhaps my cousin would just as soon not have  me come now.\" So she waited, and the Rat from the other farm told her  wonderful stories of his travels, and they had a very fine supper.    When her cousin began to run around again, he was a much sadder and  wiser Rat. Sometimes the younger Rats would ask him how he lost the tip  of his tail. \"By not turning it toward a tempting danger,\" he would  answer, very solemnly. Then, after he had told them the story, he always  added, \"The time to turn your tail toward a tempting danger is the  minute you see it, for if you wait and look and long for something you  ought not to take, there is sure to be trouble,"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/19400"],[0,"History Of Egypt, Chaldæa, Syria, Babylonia, and Assyria, Volume 1 (of 12) (#16)"],[1,"culinary use.[*] They had begun by eating  indiscriminately every kind of fruit which the country produced. Many  of these, when their therapeutic virtues had been learned by experience,  were gradually banished as articles of food, and their use restricted to  medicine; others fell into disuse, and only reappeared at sacrifices, or  at funeral feasts; several varieties continue to be eaten to the  present time--the acid fruits of the nabeca and of the carob tree,  the astringent figs of the sycamore, the insipid pulp of the dam-palm,  besides those which are pleasant to our Western palates, such as the  common fig and the date. The vine flourished, at least in Middle and  Lower Egypt; from time immemorial the art of making wine from it was  known, and even the most ancient monuments enumerate half a dozen famous  brands, red or white.[**]         *  I have often been obliged, from politeness, when dining       with the native agents appointed by the European powers at       Port Said, to eat salads and mayonnaise sauces flavoured       with castor-oil; the taste was not so disagreeable as might       be at first imagined.         **  The four kinds of canonical wine, brought respectively       from the north, south, east, and west of the country, formed       part of the official repast and of the wine-cellar of the       deceased from remote antiquity.    Vetches, lupins, beans, chick-peas, lentils, onions, fenugreek,[*] the  bamia,[**] the meloukhia,[***] the arum colocasia, all grew wild in the  fields, and the river itself supplied its quota of nourishing plants.         *  All these species have been found in the tombs and       identified by savants in archaeological botany--Kunth,       Unger, Schweinfurth (Loret, _La Flore Pharaonique_, pp. 17,       40, 42, 43, Nos. 33, 97, 102, 104, 105, 106).         **  The bamia, _Hibiscus esculentus_, L., is a plant of the       family of the Malvaceae, having a fruit of five divisions,       covered with prickly hairs, and pontaining round, white,       soft seeds, slightly sweet, but astringent in taste, and       very mucilaginous.    It figures on the monuments of       Pharaonic times.         ***  The meloukhia, _Corchorus Olitorius_, L., is a plant       belonging to the Tilliacese, which is chopped up and cooked       much the same as endive is with us, but which few Europeans       can eat with pleasure, owing to the mucilage it contains.       Theophrastus says it was celebrated for its bitterness; it       was used as food, however, in the Greek town of Alexandria.    [Illustration: 084.jpg THE EGYPTIAN LOTUS. 4]         4  Drawn by Faucher-Gudin from the _Description de       l'Egypte_, Histoire Naturelle, pl. 61.    Two of the species of lotus which grew in the Nile, the white and the  blue, have seed-vessels similar to those of the poppy: the capsules  contain small grains of the size of millet-seed. The fruit of the pink  lotus \"grows on a different stalk from that of the flower, and springs  directly from the root; it resembles a honeycomb in form,\" or, to take  a more prosaic simile, the rose of a watering-pot. The upper part has  twenty or thirty cavities, \"each containing a seed as big as an olive  stone, and pleasant to eat either fresh or dried.\" This is what the  ancients called the bean of Egypt. \"The yearly shoots of the papyrus are  also gathered. After pulling them up in the marshes, the points are cut  off and rejected, the part remaining being about a cubit in length. It  is eaten as a delicacy and is sold in the markets, but those who are  fastidious partake of it only after baking.\" Twenty different kinds of  grain and fruits, prepared by crushing between two stones, are kneaded  and baked to furnish cakes or bread; these are often mentioned in the  texts as cakes of nabeca, date cakes, and cakes of figs. Lily loaves,  made from the roots and seeds of the lotus, were the delight of the  gourmand, and appear on the tables of the kings of the XIXth dynasty.[*]         * _Tiu_, which is the most ancient word for bread, appears       in early times to have been used for every kind of paste,       whether made with fruits or grain; the more modern word aqu       applies specially to bread made from cereals. The lily       loaves are mentioned in the Papyrus Anastasi, No. 4, p. 14.       1. 1.    Bread and cakes made of cereals formed the habitual food of the people.  Durrah is of African origin; it is the \"grain of the South\" of the  inscriptions. On the other hand, it is supposed that wheat and six-rowed  barley came from the region of the Euphrates. Egypt was among the first  to procure and cultivate them.[*] The soil there is so kind to man, that  in many places no agricultural toil is required.         *  The position which wheat and barley occupy in the lists       of offerings, proves the antiquity of their existence in       Egypt. Mariette found specimens of barley in the tombs of       the Ancient Empire at Saqqarah.

As soon as the water of the Nile retires, the ground is sown without  previous preparation, and the grain, falling straight into the mud,  grows as vigorously as in the best-ploughed furrows. Where the earth is  hard it is necessary to break it up, but the extreme simplicity of the  instruments with which this was done shows what a feeble resistance it  offered. For a long time the hoe sufficed. It was composed either of a  large stone tied to a wooden handle, or was made of two pieces of wood  of unequal length, united at one of their extremities, and held together  towards the middle by a slack cord: the plough, when first invented was  but a slightly enlarged hoe, drawn by oxen. The cultivation of cereals,  once established on the banks of the Nile, developed, from earliest  times, to such a degree as to supplant all else: hunting, fishing,  the rearing of cattle, occupied but a secondary place compared with  agriculture, and Egypt became, that which she still remains, a vast  granary of wheat. The part of the valley first cultivated was from Gebel  Silsileh to the apex of the Delta.[*]         *  This was the tradition of all the ancients. Herodotus       related that, according to the Egyptians, the whole of       Egypt, with the exception of the Theban nome, was a vast       swamp previous to the time of Menes. Aristotle adds that the       Red Sea, the Mediterranean, and the area now occupied by the       Delta, formed one sea. Cf. pp. 3-5 of this volume, on the       formation of the Delta.

Between the Libyan and Arabian ranges it presents a slightly convex  surface, furrowed lengthways by a depression, in the bottom of which  the Nile is gathered and enclosed when the inundation is over. In the  summer, as soon as the river had risen higher than the top of its  banks, the water rushed by the force of gravity towards the lower lands,  hollowing in its course long channels, some of which never completely  dried up, even when the Nile reached its lowest level.[*] Cultivation  was easy in the neighbourhood of these natural reservoirs, but  everywhere else the movements of the river were rather injurious than  advantageous to man. The inundation scarcely ever covered the higher  ground in the valley, which therefore remained unproductive; it flowed  rapidly over the lands of medium elevation, and moved so sluggishly in  the hollows that they became weedy and stagnant pools.[**]         * The whole description of the damage which can be done by       the Nile in places where the inundation is not regulated, is       borrowed from Linant de Bellefonds, _Memoire sur les       principaux travaux d'utilite publique_, p. 3.         ** This physical configuration of the country explains the       existence at a very early date of those gigantic serpents       which I have already mentioned.    [Illustration: 089.jpg AN EGYPTIAN SAKIA (WELL) SHOWING METHOD OF  PROCURING WATER FOR IRRIGATION.]    In any year the portion not watered by the river was invaded by the  sand: from the lush vegetation of a hot country, there was but one  step to absolute aridity. At the present day an ingeniously established  system of irrigation allows the agriculturist to direct and distribute  the overflow according to his needs. From Gebel Ain to the sea, the Nile  and its principal branches are bordered by long dykes, which closely  follow the windings of the river and furnish sufficiently stable  embankments. Numerous canals lead off to right and left, directed more  or less obliquely towards the confines of the valley; they are divided  at intervals by fresh dykes, starting at the one side from the river,  and ending on the other either at the Bahr Yusuf or at the rising of  the desert. Some of these dykes protect one district only, and consist  merely of a bank of earth; others command a large extent of territory,  and a breach in them would entail the ruin of an entire province. These  latter are sometimes like real ramparts, made of crude brick carefully  cemented; a few, as at Qosheish, have a core of hewn stones, which later  generations have covered with masses of brickwork, and strengthened with  constantly renewed buttresses of earth. They wind across the plain with  many unexpected and apparently aimless turns; on closer examination,  however, it may be seen that this irregularity is not to be attributed  to ignorance or caprice. Experience had taught the Egyptians the art  of picking out, upon the almost imperceptible relief of the soil, the  easiest lines to use against the inundation: of these they have followed  carefully the sinuosities, and if the course of the dykes appears  singular, it is to be ascribed to "]]]
