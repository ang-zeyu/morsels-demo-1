Edgar repeated to  his friend the substance of their conversation, and they then returned  to their tent. The next day they wandered through the poorer portion of  the town. Groups of men were assembled in many places, talking  excitedly; when, as it sometimes happened, a party of French soldiers  came along, they broke up, only to assemble at another spot. Sidi and  Edgar mingled with them, and gathered that in a short time there would  be trouble. It was agreed that so long as the whole French army remained  there nothing could be done, but it was regarded as certain that it  would soon break up. It was argued that they could not remain at Cairo.  Mourad was gathering a large force higher up on the Nile. The Arabs were  moving again. Damietta and Rosetta would have to be occupied. There were  numbers of the Mamelukes between Cairo and Suez. The French could not  remain quietly until the whole country was in arms against them. No  doubt columns would be sent off, and as soon as they were gone, the time  for a rising would come.    They were going down a quiet lane when two men came out from a house.  One of them looked fixedly at Sidi and exclaimed:    \"This is the Arab boy who got us into trouble at Alexandria; now it is  our turn.\"    Paying no attention to Edgar, who was so entirely altered by his  disguise as to defy recognition, the two men seized Sidi, and began to  drag him into the house. Edgar sprang forward and struck one of them so  heavy a blow in the face that he released his hold of Sidi and staggered  back against the wall. Then with a shout of fury he drew his knife and  rushed at Edgar. The latter also snatched his knife from his girdle,  shifted it into his left hand, and threw himself into the usual boxing  attitude with his left foot forward. The Maltese paused in his rush.  This line of defence was altogether new to him. He had been engaged in  many a fierce fray, but his opponents had always, like himself, fought  with their knives in their right hands.    The momentary indecision was fatal to him. With the speed of a practised  boxer Edgar changed feet. Springing forward with his right foot in  advance he caught his opponent's wrist with his right hand, and snatched  the man's arm across his body, and plunged his own knife to the hilt  under the other's arm. He was but just in time, for the Greek, who,  having hurled Sidi into the passage, had turned to the assistance of his  comrade, was close upon him, giving vent to a hoarse howl of fury as his  comrade dropped. Edgar faced him in the same attitude as that in which  he had met the Maltese. The man paused out of reach and then crouched,  swaying his body from side to side in readiness for a spring, but he  never gave it. Sidi, although thrown heavily down, had leapt up again  with the activity of a cat, and with a single bound from the door he  reached the Greek and buried his knife between his shoulders. Almost at  the same moment there was a shout from the other end of the street, and  two or three men were seen running towards them.    \"Through the house, Sidi!\" Edgar exclaimed.    They rushed in, closed and fastened the door, and then ran out into the  yard behind the house, which was fortunately empty. They were over the  wall in a moment into another yard, entered a door that stood open, went  noiselessly along the passage, for both were barefooted, opened a door  and went out into the lane beyond, pausing for a moment before they did  so to see that there were no blood-stains that would attract attention  on their dress. As their arms were bare, there were but a few spots of  blood to be seen. They wiped the blood from the hands that held the  knives on the inside of their dress, and then walked quietly out, pulled  the door to, but did not attempt to close it, walked quietly down the  lane, took the first turning, turned again four or five times, and then  quickened their pace to a fast walk, and in ten minutes emerged from the  labyrinth of lanes they had been traversing. Up to this time not a word  had been spoken from the moment they entered the house.    \"We are well out of that, Sidi,\" Edgar said. \"Who would have thought of  our meeting those two scoundrels again? I am sorry that I had to kill  that man, but it was his life or mine.\"    \"You have assuredly again saved my life, Edgar. I am sure that they  would have murdered me.\"    \"No doubt they would,\" Edgar said. \"But as I was with you, and was not  likely to stand and look on while they did it, it was a fight of two  against two, and you did your share.\"    \"It was a poor share, brother. You drew off the attention of the man  that would have killed me, and I had but to strike him down without  danger to myself. Again you have saved my life.\"    \"That may be, but I think that you in turn saved mine, for I doubt  whether I should have got on as well with the second fellow as I did  with the first.\"    \"Oh, I have no doubt you would!\" the young Arab said confidently. \"How  did you kill him? I saw nothing of it.\"    \"It was simple enough,\" Edgar replied, and related how the short  conflict had begun and ended.    \"You must really teach me these things, Edgar. It is wonderful how quick  you are, and with a knife too; for I have heard you say that in England  people never fight with knives.\"    \"One learns quickness from boxing,\" Edgar said carelessly. \"That is one  of the advantages of it. It teaches one to think quickly and act  quickly; and if one can fight with one's fists, of course one can fight  with a knife. It was a boxing trick I used, and a very useful one, and  more easy than it would be against a good boxer, who would have hit me  with his left before I could strike my blow, but of course this fellow  had no idea of doing that, so that unless I had failed to grasp his  wrist it was a certainty. Did the other hurt you? I heard you go down  with a crash.\"    \"I feel stiff,\" Sidi replied, \"and I expect that I shall be a good deal  worse to-morrow, for I am sure I am bruised all down the back; but that  is no matter. It is a good thing that we have done with those two men; I  felt sure that they would try to be revenged on us if they ever fell in  with us again.\"    The next day, the anniversary of the establishment of the republic, was  celebrated by a grand review of the troops, and a few days later the  news came that Desaix's division, which had set out in pursuit of Mourad  on the day after the battle of the Pyramids, had overtaken him, and  another fierce fight had ensued. The charge of the Mamelukes had broken  one of the French squares, and for a time great confusion prevailed, but  Desaix shouted to the soldiers to throw themselves down on the ground,  and then the next square opened so terrible a fire on the Mamelukes that  they were forced to retreat. Two days later Kleber marched with his  division for Damietta.    In the native quarter the agitation continued, but so far peace had not  been broken, and the French took little heed of what was passing, and  had no idea that there was any danger of a rising. Had it been their  object to provoke such movement, they could hardly have taken steps  better calculated to bring it about. They had, in the first place, after  their arrival proceeded to largely strengthen and increase the  fortifications, and in doing so had altogether disregarded the feelings  of the people, had pulled down houses and mosques, had desecrated tombs,  and cleared away all buildings on spaces of ground across which the guns  would play. This desecration of their sacred places had given rise to  the deepest feelings of exasperation among the people.    In the next place, many of the fortifications were converted so that the  guns menaced the town instead of the country round, and at the citadel  especially, which dominated the whole city, guns were placed to overawe  it. The next step was deeply resented by the people, for interfering  with their ancient usages. Cairo was divided into fifty quarters, each  of which had a wall and gate. These gates were closed at night, or  indeed at any time, by the orders of the chief of the quarter, and the  interruption caused by these breaks in the line of communication had  given rise to many quarrels between the soldiers and the townspeople.  The inconvenience was a distinct one, and the French, without giving  any notice of their intentions, sent a strong party of engineers,  supported by troops, to demolish all these gateways.    The taxes were onerous in the extreme. By means of a council that had  been appointed, consisting of notabilities who had, either by fear or  bribery, been brought over to the side of the French, a crushing  taxation was imposed, and this rendered the trading and upper classes,  upon whom the burden principally fell, as hostile to the French  domination as were the lower classes. Thus the French themselves had, by  their high-handed conduct and their absolute disregard for the feelings  and religious sentiments of the people, prepared a mine that was on the  point of exploding.    That afternoon a messenger arrived from the sheik, saying that he should  be at the Pyramids on the following morning, at nine o'clock, and that  he wished them to meet him there.    \"Would you take the men with us, Edgar?\"    \"No, I think it would be best to leave them. They are well established  here now, and have come to be looked upon by those around them as having  left the tribe altogether and as intending to work as carriers. I should  tell one or other of them to go into the town every day, and see how  matters are going on. If your father, as I hope, decides to take no part  in any attack on the French here, he can easily send a messenger to  recall them.\"    Accordingly, the next morning they"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/22245"],[0,"Steve and the Steam Engine (#16)"],[1,"ountry. The roar of the  mighty city, its bustle and confusion, were both exhilarating and  terrifying. They had left their luggage at the hotel and now, while  Steve's father went to meet a business appointment, the boy was to take  a ride up the Avenue on one of the busses, a diversion of which he never  tired. To sit on top and look down on the throng in the streets was  always novel and entertaining to one who passed his days in a quiet New  England town. Therefore he stopped one of the moving vehicles and in  great good humor bade his father good-by; and feeling very  self-sufficient to be touring New York by himself, clambered eagerly up  to a seat.    There were few passengers on the top of the coach for the chill of early  morning still lingered in the air; but before they reached Riverside  Drive a man with a bright, ruddy countenance and iron-grey hair hailed  the bus and climbed up beside the boy. As he took his place he glanced  at him kindly and instantly Steve felt a sense of friendliness toward  the stranger; and after they had ridden a short distance in silence the  man spoke.    \"What a beautiful river the Hudson is!\" he remarked. \"Although I am an  old New Yorker I never cease to delight in its charm and its fascinating  history. It was on this body of water, you know, that the first  steamboat was tried out.\"    \"I didn't know it,\" Stephen confessed, with an honest blush.    \"You will be learning about it some day, I fancy,\" said the other, with  a smile. \"An interesting story it is, too. All the beginnings of our  great industries and inventions read like romances.\"    \"My father has just been telling me about the beginnings of some of our  railroads,\" observed Steve shyly, \"and certainly his stories were as  good as fairy tales.\"    \"Is your father especially interested in railroads?\" inquired the New  Yorker.    \"Yes, sir. He is in the railroad business.\"    \"Ah, then that accounts for his filling your ears with locomotives  instead of steamboats,\" declared the man, with a twinkle in his eyes.  \"Now if I were to spin a yarn for you, it would be of steamboats because  that happens to be the thing I am interested in; I believe their history  to be one of the most alluring tales to which a boy could listen.  Sometime you get a person who knows the drama from start to finish to  relate to you the whole marvelous adventure of early steamboating, and  you see if it does not beat the railroad story all out.\"    He laughed a merry laugh in which Stephen joined.    \"I wish you would tell it to me yourself,\" suggested the lad.    The man turned with an expression of pleasure on his red-cheeked face.    \"I should like nothing better, my boy,\" he said quickly, \"but you see it  is a long story and I am getting out at the next corner. Sometime,  however, we may meet again. Who knows? And if we do you shall hold me to  my promise to talk steamboats to you until you cry for mercy.\"    Bending down he took up a leather bag which he had placed between his  feet.    \"I am leaving you here, sonny,\" he said. \"I take it you are in New York  for a holiday.\"    \"Yes, sir, I am,\" returned Steve with surprise. \"My father and I are  staying here just for a few days.\"    \"I hope you will have a jolly good time during your visit,\" the man  said, rising.    Stephen murmured his thanks and watched the erect figure descend from  the coach and disappear into a side street. It was not until the New  Yorker was well out of sight and the omnibus on its way that his eye was  caught by the red bill book lying on the floor at his feet. None of the  few scattered passengers had noticed it and stooping, he picked it up  and quietly slipped it into his pocket.    What should he do with it?    Of course he could hand it over to the driver of the bus and tell him he  had found it. But the man might not be honest and instead of turning it  in to the company might keep it. There was little doubt in Steve's mind  that the pocketbook belonged to the stranger who had just vacated the  place and it was likely his address was inside it. If so, what a  pleasure it would be to return the lost article to its rightful owner  himself. By so doing he would not only be sure the pocketbook reached  its destination but he might see the steamboat man again.    He longed to open the bill book and investigate its contents. What was  in it, he wondered. Well, the top of a Fifth Avenue coach was no place  to be looking through pocketbooks, there was no question about that. Let  alone the fact that persons might be watching him, there was danger that  in the fresh morning breeze something might take wing, sail down to the  Hudson, and never be seen again. Therefore he decided to curb his  impatience and wait until he reached a more favorable spot to examine  his suddenly acquired treasure. Accordingly he tucked the long red  wallet farther down into the breast pocket of his ulster, and feeling  assured that nothing could be done about it at present, gave himself up  to the pleasure and excitement of the drive.    It was not until he had rejoined his father at the hotel and the two  were sitting at lunch in the great dining room that the thought of it  again flashed into his mind.    \"Gee, Dad!\" he suddenly exclaimed, looking up from his plateful of fried  chicken with fork suspended in mid-air. \"I meant to tell you I found a  pocketbook in the bus this morning.\"    \"A pocketbook!\"    \"Yes, sir. I think the man who had been sitting beside me must have  dropped it when he stooped over to get his bag. At any rate it was lying  there after he got out.\"    \"What did you do with it?\" Mr. Tolman inquired with no great warmth of  interest. \"Gave it to the conductor, I suppose.\"    The boy shook his head.    \"No, I didn't,\" was the answer. \"I was afraid he might not turn it in,  and as I liked the man who lost it I wanted to be sure he got it, so I  brought it back with me.\"    \"And where is it now?\" demanded Mr. Tolman, now all attention. \"I hope  you were not so careless as to leave it upstairs in our room.\"    \"No. I didn't leave it in the room,\" returned the lad. \"It is out in my  coat pocket. I meant to take it out and see what was in it; but so many  things happened that I forgot about it until this very minute.\"    \"You don't mean that you left it in your ulster pocket and let them hang  it out there on the rack?\"    \"Yes.\"    \"You checked your coat and left it there?\"    \"Why--yes,\" came the faltering reply.    Mr. Tolman was on his feet.    \"Wait here until I come back,\" he said in a sharp tone.    \"Where are you going?\"    \"Give me your check quickly,\" went on his father, without heeding the  question. \"Hurry!\"    Steve fumbled in his jacket pocket.    \"Be quick, son, be quick!\" commanded Mr. Tolman impatiently. \"Don't you  know it is never safe to leave anything of value in your coat when you  are staying at a large city hotel? Somebody may have taken the  pocketbook already.\"    Scarlet with consternation the lad produced the check.    \"If nothing has happened to that pocketbook you will be very fortunate,\"  asserted the man severely. \"Stay here! I will be right back.\"    With beating heart the boy watched him thread his way between the tables  and disappear from the dining room into the lobby.    Suppose the bill book should be gone!    What if there had been valuable papers in it, money--a great deal of  money--and now through his carelessness it had all disappeared? How  stupid he had been not to remember about it and give it to his father  the instant they had met! In fact, he would much better have taken a  chance and handed it to the bus conductor than to have done the foolish  thing he had. He had meant so well and blundered so grievously! How  often his father had cautioned him to be careful of money when he was  traveling!    Tensely he sat in his chair and waited with miserable anxiety, his eyes  fixed on the dining-room door. Then presently, to his great relief, he  saw his father returning.    \"Did you--\" he began.    \"You will have to come yourself, Steve,\" said the elder man whose brow  was wrinkled into a frown of annoyance. \"The maid who checked the coats  is not there, and the one who is insists that the ulster is not mine,  and in spite of the check will not allow me to search the pockets of  it.\"    Stephen jumped up.    \"I suppose she is right, too,\" went on Mr. Tolman breathlessly, \"but the  delay is very unfortunate.\"    They made their way into the corridor, where by this time an office  clerk and another man had joined the maid who was in charge of the coat  rack.    Stephen presented his check and without comment the woman handed him his  coat. With trembling hand he dived into the deep pocket and from it drew  forth the red bill book which he gave to his father.    \"There it is, Dad, safe and sound!\" he gasped.    Instantly the clerk was in their path.    \"I beg pardon, sir,\" said he with deference, \"but does that pocketbook  belong to you?\"    Mr. Tolman wheeled about.    \"Eh--what did you say?\" he inquired.    \"I asked, sir, if that pocketbook was your property?\" repeated the  clerk.    Mr. Tolman faced his inquisitor.    \"What business is that of yours?\" he demanded curtly.    \"I am sorry, sir, to appear rude,\" the hotel employee replied, \"but we  have been asked to be on the lookout for a young lad who rode this  morning on one of the Fifth Avenue busses where a valuable pocketbook  was lost. Your son tallies so well with the description that--\"    \"It was I,\" put in Stephen eagerly, without regard for consequences.  \"Who wants me?\"    With a smile of eagerness he turned, expecting to encounter the genial  face of his acquaintance of the morning. Then he would smile, hold out  the pocketbook, and they would laugh together as he explained the  adventure, and perhaps afterward have luncheon in company.    Instead no familiar form greeted him. On the contrary the slender man  who had been standing beside the clerk came"]]]
