You know that in England  the Sovereign is the head of the Church, and that the Church looks  upon the Protestant religion as it is established as the _State_  Religion. In times like the present, when the Crown is already a good  deal weakened, I believe that it is of importance to maintain as much  as possible this state of affairs, and I believe that you will do  well, whenever an occasion offers itself to do so without affectation,  to express your sincere interest for the Church, and that you  comprehend its position and count upon its good-will. The poor Church  will be a good deal persecuted, I have no doubt, but it would be  desirable that the men belonging to it should be united, _sensible_,  and moderate....          _The Princess Victoria to the King of the Belgians._    RAMSGATE, _14th November 1836._    ... What you say to me relative to Church matters I quite comprehend,  and always am very thankful for advice from you.    I am reading away famously. I like Mrs. Hutchinson's Life of her  husband[13] only _comme cela_; she is so dreadfully violent. She and  Clarendon are so totally opposite, that it is quite absurd, and I only  believe the _juste milieu_....    Your speech interested me very much; it is very fine indeed; you wrote  it yourself, did you not?    Belgium is indeed the happiest country in the world, and it is _all,  all_ owing to your _great care_ and _kindness_. \"Nous etions des  enfans perdus,\" General Goblet[14] said to me at Claremont, \"quand le  Roi est venu nous sauver.\" And so it is....    Pray, dear Uncle, say everything most kind from me to Ernest and  Albert, and believe me, always, your affectionate Niece,    VICTORIA.    Pray, dear Uncle, is the report of the King of Naples' marriage to the  Archduchess Theresa true? I hear the king has behaved uncommonly  well at Naples during the cholera panic. I enclose the measure of my  finger.        [Footnote 13: The regicide, Colonel Hutchinson's, fame rests      more on his wife's commemoration of him than on his own      exploits. She was the daughter of Sir Allen Apsley, Lieutenant      of the Tower of London, and highly educated. Between 1664 and      1671 she wrote the biography of her husband, first published      in 1806. \"The figure of Colonel Hutchinson,\" says J. R.      Green, \"stands out from his wife's canvas with the grace and      tenderness of a portrait by Van Dyck.\"]        [Footnote 14: The Belgian General, Albert Joseph Goblet. Count      d'Alviella.]          [Pageheading: DEATH OF CHARLES X]      _The King of the Belgians to the Princess Victoria._    LAEKEN, _18th November 1836._    ... Poor Charles X. is dead, it is said of the cholera. I regret  him; few people were ever kinder to me than the good old man. He was  blinded by certain absolute ideas, but a good man, and deserving to  be loved. History will state that Louis XVIII. was a most liberal  monarch, reigning with great mildness and justice to his end, but that  his brother, from his despotic and harsh disposition, upset all  the other had done, and lost the throne. Louis XVIII. was a clever,  hard-hearted man, shackled by no principle, very proud and false.  Charles X. an honest man, a kind friend, an honourable master, sincere  in his opinions, and inclined to do everything that is right. That  teaches us what we ought to believe in history as it is compiled  according to ostensible events and results known to the generality of  people. Memoirs are much more instructive, if written honestly and not  purposely fabricated, as it happens too often nowadays, particularly  at Paris.... I shall not fail to read the books you so kindly  recommend. I join you a small copy of our very liberal Constitution,  hitherto conscientiously executed--no easy matter. You may communicate  it to your Mother; it is the best answer to an infamous Radical or  Tory-Radical paper, the _Constitutional_, which seems determined to  run down the Coburg family. I don't understand the meaning of it;  the only happiness poor Charlotte knew was during her short wedded  existence, and there was but one voice on that subject, that we  offered a bright prospect to the nation. Since that period I have  (though been abused, and vilified merely for drawing an income which  was the consequence of a Treaty ratified by both Houses of Parliament,  and that without one dissenting voice, a thing not very likely to  happen again) done everything to see England prosperous and powerful.  I have spared her, in 1831, much trouble and expense, as _without  my coming here very serious complications, war and all the expensive  operations connected with it_, must have taken place. I give the whole  of my income, without the reservation of a farthing, to the country; I  preserve unity on the Continent, have frequently prevented mischief at  Paris, and to thank me for all that, I get the most scurrilous abuse,  in which the good people from _constant practice so much excel_....  The conclusion of all this--and that by people whose very existence  in political life may be but of a few years' standing--is scurrilous  abuse of the Coburg family. I should like to know what harm the Coburg  family has done to England? But enough of this. Your principle is very  good; one must not mind what newspapers say. Their power is a fiction  of the worst description, and their efforts marked by the worst faith  and the greatest untruths. If all the Editors of the papers in the  countries where the liberty of the press exists were to be assembled,  we should have a _crew_ to which you would _not_ confide a dog that  you would value, still less your honour and reputation....          [Pageheading: REVOLUTION AT LISBON]    [Pageheading: THE PRINCESS'S NAME]      _The Princess Victoria to the King of the Belgians._    _21st November 1836._    MY MOST DEARLY BELOVED UNCLE,--You cannot imagine how happy you have  made me by your very dear, kind, long, and interesting letter of the  18th, which I received yesterday morning, and for which I beg you  to accept my _very warmest_ and best thanks. You know, I think, my  dearest Uncle, that _no_ creature on earth _loves_ you _more_ dearly,  or has a higher sense of admiration for you, than I have. Independent  of all that you have done--which I never, never can be grateful enough  for--my love for you exceeds all that words can express; it is innate  in me, for from my earliest years the name of _Uncle_ was the dearest  I knew, the word _Uncle_, _alone_, meant no other but you!    Your letter is so interesting and instructive that I could read it  over and over again. I hope, dear Uncle, you will in process of time  give me the _apercu_ you mention, which would be so very interesting  for me.    I cannot tell you how distressed I was by the late unfortunate  _contre-revolution manquee_ at Lisbon,[15] and how sorry I was to see  by the letter you wrote me, that you were still unaware of it on the  18th. Mamma received a letter from Lord Palmerston yesterday morning,  which she has sent you, and which is consolatory, I think. He speaks  in the highest terms of our beloved Ferdinand, which proves that he  becomes daily more and more worthy of his arduous situation, and says  that the Queen's situation \"is better than it was,\" less bad than it  might have been \"after such an affair,\" and not so good as it would  have been had poor Donna Maria waited patiently till all was ripe for  action. Dietz[16] wrote Mamma a most desponding letter, so much so,  that had we not got Lord Palmerston's letter we must have thought  all, all was over.[17] I hope, dear Uncle, you will tell _me_ _your_  feeling about the whole, which will only satisfy me; no one else  could, for I take an interest in Ferdinand's welfare as though he were  my brother.    Allow me, dearest Uncle, to say a few words respecting my _name_, to  which you allude. You are aware, I believe, that about a year after  the accession of the _present_ King there was a desire to change my  favourite and dear name _Victoria_ to that of _Charlotte_, also _most  dear_, to which the King willingly consented. On its being told me, I  said nothing, though I felt grieved beyond measure at the thought of  any change. Not long after this, Lord Grey, and also the Archbishop of  Canterbury, acquainted Mamma that the country, having been accustomed  to hear me called Victoria, had become used to it, _enfin_, _liked  it_, and therefore, to my great delight, the idea of a change was  given up.[18]    I was sure the death of old Charles X. would strike you....    I thank you much for the _Constitution de la Belgique_. Those attacks  on you are infamous, but must not be minded; they are the language  of a _few jealous_, _envious_ people. _En revanche_, I enclose a  paragraph from a speech of O'Connell's[19] I think worth your reading.    Pray, dearest Uncle, say everything most kind to my beloved and  dearest Aunt, and thank her in my name for her kind letter, which I  shall answer on Friday. I am happy she and the dear little man are  well.    Believe me, always, your most devoted and affectionately attached  Niece,    VICTORIA.        [Footnote 15: Prince Ferdinand was appointed      Commander-in-Chief of the Portuguese army on the advice of      the Duc de Terceira, then Prime Minister. The appointment was      highly unpopular; riots broke out, the army mutinied, and rose      against the authorities, with the result that the Queen of      Portugal was compelled to accept the Radical Constitution of      1820, in the place of Dom Pedro's constitutional Charter      of 1826.

My only  regret in the matter is that I cannot persuade my mother to go with  me.\"    \"I think she is right, Reuben,\" the squire replied. \"You can  transplant a young tree, easily enough; but you can't an old one.  Somehow they won't take root in new soil.    \"Well, lad, I wish you every success. I suppose I shall hear  through Shrewsbury, from time to time, how you are going on.\"    As Reuben walked along the dock, he stopped to read the notices of  their destination, affixed to the shrouds of most of the vessels.  He had already gone on board three or four, which were loading for  Australia, but in none was there a vacancy for a carpenter. He  stopped before a fine-looking barque, to which no notice was  attached.    \"Where is she going to?\" he asked a sailor, who was passing along  the gangway to the shore.    \"She's bound for Sydney,\" the sailor said. \"She warps out of dock  tonight, and takes on board a cargo of prisoners in the Medway.\"    \"Do you mean men sentenced for transportation?\" Reuben asked.    \"Yes,\" the man said, \"and I wish she had any other sort of cargo. I  have been out with such a load before, and I would as soon go with  a cargo of wild beasts.\"    Reuben felt a sudden chill, as he thought how narrow had been his  escape of forming one of a similar party. However, he stepped on  board, and went up to the mate, who was superintending the cargo.    \"Do you want a carpenter for the voyage out?\"    \"A carpenter!\" the mate repeated. \"Well yes, we do want a  carpenter. The man who was to have gone has been taken ill. But you  are too young for the berth. Why, you don't look more than  eighteen; besides, you don't look like a carpenter.\"    \"I am a mill wright,\" Reuben said, \"and am capable of doing any  ordinary jobs, either in carpentering or smith work. I have  testimonials here from my late employers.\"    \"Well, you can see the captain, if you like,\" the mate said. \"You  will find him at Mr. Thompson's office, in Tower Street, Number  51.\"    Reuben at once made his way to the office. The captain refused, at  first, to entertain the application on the ground of his youth; but  ship's carpenters were scarce, the time was short, and there was a  difficulty in obtaining men for convict ships. Therefore, after  reading the very warm testimonial as to character and ability which  Mr. Penfold had given Reuben, he agreed to take him, on the terms  of his working his passage.    Reuben went back at once, to the inn where he had stopped, and had  his chest taken down to the docks; and went on board the Paramatta  which, at high water, warped out of dock into the stream.        Chapter 6: On The Voyage.      The next day the Paramatta weighed anchor and proceeded down the  river. Reuben had no time to look at the passing ships, for he was  fully occupied with the many odd jobs which are sure to present  themselves, when a ship gets under weigh. The wind was favourable,  and the Paramatta ran down to the mouth of the Medway before the  tide had ceased to ebb. She anchored for three hours, and then made  her way up to Chatham, where she brought up close to the government  yard.    It was not till late in the evening that Reuben had finished his  work, and was at liberty to look round, and to take an interest in  what was going on on deck.    \"This is your first voyage, my lad, I reckon,\" an old sailor, who  was standing leaning against the bulwark, smoking his pipe,  remarked.    \"Yes,\" Reuben said cheerfully, \"this is my first voyage. I have  shipped as carpenter, you know, to work my way out to Sydney.\"    \"You could not have chosen a better ship than this 'ere barkee,\"  the sailor said; \"though I wish she hadn't got them convicts on  board. She will sail all the faster, 'cause, you see, instead of  being choked up with cargo, the deck below there has been set aside  for them. That will make easy sailing and quick sailing; but I  don't like them, for all that. They are a lot of trouble, and they  has to be watched, night and day. There's never no saying what they  might be up to; there's mostly trouble on board, with them. Then  one can't help being sorry for the poor chaps, though they does  look such a villainous bad lot. They are treated mostly like dogs,  and I have been on board ships where the rations was not what a  decent dog would look at.\"    \"But I thought there was regular food, according to a scale,\"  Reuben said.    \"Ay, there's that,\" the sailor replied, \"and the government  officers see that the quantity's right; but, Lor' bless you! They  don't trouble as to quality, and some of the owners buys up  condemned stores, and such like; anything, thinks they, is good  enough for a convict ship--biscuits as is dropping to pieces, salt  junk as 'as been twenty years in cask, and which was mostly horse  to begin with. No wonder as they grumbles and growls. A convict is  a man, you see, though he be a convict; and it ain't in human  nature to eat such muck as that, without growling.\"    \"What tonnage is the vessel?\" Reuben asked.    \"'Leven hundred and fifty ton, and as fine and roomy a ship as  there is in the trade, and well officered. I have made three  v'yages with the captain and first mate, and the second mate was  with us on the last v'yage.\"    \"How many hands are there, altogether?\"    \"Twenty-five, counting you as one, and not a-counting the two  stewards.\"    \"We are going to take some passengers, I see,\" Reuben said. \"I have  been at work, putting up pegs and shelves for them.\"    \"Yes, there's eight or ten passengers, I hears,\" the sailor said.  \"Passengers don't mostly like going by convict ships, but then the  fares are lower than by other vessels, and that tempts a few.  Besides, the Paramatta is known to be a fast ship, and the skipper  has a good name; so we shall have a better class of passengers, I  expect, than usually voyages with convict ships; and besides the  passengers there will be the officer of the convict guard, and a  surgeon, so we shall be pretty full aft.\"    \"And what will my duties be, when we are at sea?\"    \"It just depends on the captain,\" the sailor said. \"You will be put  in a watch, and work with the others, except that they may not send  you aloft. That depends on the terms that you shipped.\"    \"I shipped as carpenter, and to make myself generally useful, and  to obey orders. I shall be happy to do anything I can; hard work is  better than doing nothing, any day.\"    \"That's the sort, my lad,\" the sailor said heartily. \"Now I am sail  maker, but, bless your heart! Except putting a patch on a sail, now  and then, there's nothing to do that way; and when not so wanted I  am one of the ordinary crew. Still, if you works your passage, it  ain't to be expected as they will drive you the same as a man as is  paid. He's a fair man, is the skipper; and you won't find yourself  put upon, on board the Paramatta.\"    \"Can't I go up aloft now?\" Reuben asked. \"I would rather accustom  myself to it while we are lying steady, than go up when the wind's  blowing, and she is heeling over.\"    \"Go up! To be sure you can, and I will go up with you, and tell you  some of the names of the ropes, and put you up to things. There's a  pleasure in helping a lad who seems in any way teachable. Some of  they boys as comes on board a ship ain't worth their salt, in these  days.\"    The sailor led the way up the shrouds. Reuben found it much more  difficult than it looked. He had seen the sailors running up and  down, and it looked as easy as mounting a ladder; but the slackness  of the ratlines--which, as the sailor told him, was the name of the  pieces of rope which answered to the rounds of a ladder--made it at  first awkward. When they reached the main top the sailor told him  to sit down, and look round quietly, till he became accustomed to  the height.    \"It looks unnatural and risky, at first,\" he said; \"but when you  get accustomed to it, you will feel just as safe, when you are  astraddle the end of a yard, and the ship rolling fit to take her  masts out, as if you were standing on the deck.\"    As Reuben had heard the sailors laughing and joking aloft, as they  hauled out the earrings of the sails, he had no doubt that what the  sailor said was true; but it seemed, to him, that he should never  accustom himself to sit at the end of a spar, with nothing but the  water at a vast depth below. It would be bad, even with the ship  lying quiet, as at present. It would be terrible with the vessel in  a heavy sea.    The sailor now told him the names of the masts and stays, giving  him a general idea of the work aloft, and presently asked him  whether he would like to return to the deck now, or to mount a bit  higher. Although Reuben was now becoming accustomed to the  position, he would, had he consulted his inner feelings, have  rather gone down than up; but he thought it was better to put a  good face on it, and to accustom himself, at once, to what he would  probably have to do sooner or later.    Holding on tight then, and following the instructions of his  companion, he made his way up until he was seated on the cap of the  top-gallant mast, holding tight to the spar, which towered still  higher above him. He was surprised at the size and strength of the  spars, which had looked so light and slender, from below.    \"Very well done, lad,\" the sailor said approvingly. \"You would make  a good sailor, in time, if you took to a seafaring life. There's  not one in ten as would get up there, the first time of going  aloft. You don't feel giddy, do you?\"    \"No,\" Reuben replied, \"I don't think I feel giddy, but I feel a  strange shaky feeling in my legs.\"    \"That will soon pass off,\" the sailor said. \"You look at them hills  behind the town, and the forts and works up there. Don't think  about the deck of the vessel, or anything, but just as if you were  sitting in a chair, watching the hills.\"    Reuben did as the sailor instructed him and, as he did "]]]
