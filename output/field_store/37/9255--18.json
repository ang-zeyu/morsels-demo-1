Debendra drew a flask of brandy from his pocket, and drank some of it  undiluted. Under the influence of this spirit he perceived that Hira's  eyes were beautiful. In truth they were so--large, dark, brilliant,  and seductive. He said, \"Your eyes are heavenly!\" Hira smiled.  Debendra saw in a corner a broken violin. Humming a tune, he took the  violin and touched it with the bow. \"Where did you get this  instrument?\" he asked.    \"I bought it of a beggar.\"    Debendra made it perform a sort of accompaniment to his voice, as he  sang some song in accordance with his mood.    Hira's eyes shone yet more brilliantly. For a few moments she forgot  self, forgot Debendra's position and her own. She thought, \"He is the  husband, I am the wife; the Creator, making us for each other,  designed long ago to bring us together, that we might both enjoy  happiness.\" The thoughts of the infatuated Hira found expression in  speech. Debendra discovered from her half-spoken words that she had  given her heart to him. The words were hardly uttered when Hira  recovered consciousness. Then, with the wild look of a frantic  creature, she exclaimed, \"Go from my house!\"    Astonished, Debendra said, \"What is the matter, Hira?\"    \"You must go at once, or I shall.\"    \"Why do you drive me away?\" said Debendra.    \"Go, go, else I will call some one. Why should you destroy me?\"    \"Is this woman's nature?\" asked Debendra.    Hira, enraged, answered: \"The nature of woman is not evil. The nature  of such a man as you is very evil. You have no religion, you care  nothing for the fate of others; you go about seeking only your own  delight, thinking only what woman you can destroy. Otherwise, why are  you sitting in my house? Was it not your design to compass my  destruction? You thought me to be a courtezan, else you would not  have had the boldness to sit down here. But I am not a courtezan; I am  a poor woman, and live by my labour. I have no leisure for such evil  doings. If I had been a rich man's wife, I can't say how it would have  been.\"    Debendra frowned.    Then Hira softened; she looked full at Debendra and said: \"The sight  of your beauty and your gifts has made me foolish, but you are not to  think of me as a courtezan. The sight of you makes me happy, and on  that account I wished you to stay. I could not forbid you; but I am a  woman. If I were too weak to forbid you, ought you to have sat down?  You are very wicked; you entered my house in order to destroy me. Now  leave the place!\"    Debendra, taking another draught of brandy, said: \"Well done, Hira!  you have made a capital speech. Will you give a lecture in our Brahmo  Samaj?\"    Stung to the quick by this mockery, Hira said, bitterly: \"I am not to  be made a jest of by you. Even if I loved so base a man as you, such  love would be no fit subject for a jest. I am not virtuous; I don't  understand virtue; my mind is not turned in that direction. The reason  I told you I was not a courtezan is because I am resolved not to bring  a stain upon my character in the hope of winning your love. If you had  a spark of love for me, I would have made no such pledge to myself. I  am not speaking of virtue; I should think nothing of infamy compared  with the treasure of your love; but you do not love me. For what  reward should I incur ill-fame? For what gain should I give up my  independence? If a young woman falls into your hands, you will not let  her go. If I were to give you my worship, you would accept it; but  to-morrow you would forget me, or, if you remembered, it would be to  jest over my words with your companions. Why, then, should I become  subject to you? Should the day come when you can love me, I will be  your devoted servant.\"    In this manner Debendra discovered Hira's affection for himself. He  thought: \"Now I know you, I can make you dance to my measure, and  whenever I please effect my designs through you.\"    With these thoughts in his mind, he departed. But Debendra did not yet  know Hira.          CHAPTER XX.    GOOD NEWS.      It is mid-day. Srish Babu is at office. The people in his house are  all taking the noon siesta after their meal. The _boita khana_ is  locked. A mongrel terrier is sleeping on the door-mat outside, his  head between his paws. A couple of servants are seizing the  opportunity to chat together in whispers.    Kamal Mani is sitting in her sleeping chamber at her ease, needle in  hand, sewing at some canvas work, her hair all loose; no one about but  Satish Babu, indulging in many noises. Satish Babu at first tried to  snatch away his mother's wool; but finding it securely guarded, he  gave his mind to sucking the head of a clay tiger. In the distance a  cat with outstretched paws sits watching them both. Her disposition  was grave, her face indicated much wisdom and a heart void of  fickleness. She is thinking: \"The condition of human creatures is  frightful; their minds are ever given to sewing canvas, playing with  dolls, or some such silly employment. Their thoughts are not turned to  good works, nor to providing suitable food for cats. What will become  of them hereafter?\" Elsewhere, a lizard on the wall with upraised face  is watching a fly. No doubt he is pondering the evil disposition of  flies. A butterfly is flying about. In the spot where Satish Babu sits  eating sweets, the flies collect in swarms; the ants also do their  share towards removing the sweet food. In a few moments the lizard,  not being able to catch the fly, moves elsewhere. The cat also, seeing  no means by which she could improve the disposition of mankind,  heaving a sigh, slowly departs. The butterfly wings its way out of  the room. Kamal Mani, tired of her work, puts it down, and turns to  talk with Satish Babu.    \"Oh, Satu Babu, can you tell me why men go to office?\"    \"Sli--li--bli,\" was the child's only answer.    \"Satu Babu,\" said his mother, \"mind you never go to office.\"    \"Hama,\" said Satu.    \"What do you mean by Hama? You must not go to office to do hama. Do  not go at all. If you do, the _Bou_ will sit crying at home before the  day is half done.\"    Satish Babu understood the word _Bou_, because Kamal Mani kept him in  order by saying that the _Bou_ would come and beat him; so he said,  \"_Bou_ will beat.\"    \"Remember that, then; if you go to office, the _Bou_ will beat you.\"    How long this sort of conversation would have continued does not  appear, for at that moment a maid-servant entered, rubbing her sleepy  eyes, and gave a letter to Kamal Mani. Kamal saw it was from Surja  Mukhi; she read it twice through, then sat silent and dejected. This  was the letter:    \"Dearest,--Since you returned to Calcutta you have forgotten me; else  why have I had only one letter from you? Do you not know that I always  long for news of you? You ask for news of Kunda. You will be delighted  to hear that she is found. Besides that, I have another piece of good  news for you. My husband is about to be married to Kunda. I have  arranged this marriage. Widow-marriage is allowed in the Shastras, so  what fault can be found with it? The wedding will take place in a  couple of days; but you will not be able to attend, otherwise I would  have invited you. Come, if you can, in time for the ceremony of _Phul  Saja_.[13] I have a great desire to see you.\"    [Footnote 13: _Phul Saja_. On the day following the wedding, the  bride's father sends flowers and sweetmeats to the friends.]    Kamal could not understand the meaning of this letter. She proceeded  to take counsel with Satish Babu, who sat in front of her nibbling at  the corners of a book. Kamal read the letter to him and said--    \"Now, Satish Babu, tell me the meaning of this.\"    Satish understood the joke; he stood up ready to cover his mother with  kisses.    Then for some moments Kamal forgot Surja Mukhi; but presently she  returned to the letter, reflecting--    \"This work is beyond Satish Babu, it needs the help of my minister;  will he never come in? Come, baby, we are very angry.\"    In due time Srish Chandra returned from office and changed his dress.  Kamal Mani attended to his wants and then threw herself on the couch  in a fume, the baby by her side. Srish Chandra, seeing the state of  things, smiled, and seated himself, with his huka, on a distant couch.  Invoking the _huka_ as a witness he said--    \"O _huka_! thou hast cool water in thy belly but a fire in thy head,  be thou a witness. Let her who is angry with me talk to me, else I  will sit smoking for hours.\"    At this Kamal Mani sat up, and in gentle anger turning to him her blue  lotus eyes, said--    \"It is no use speaking to you while you smoke; you will not attend.\"    Then she rose from the couch and took away the _huka_.    Kamal Mani's fit of sulking thus broken through, she gave Surja  Mukhi's letter to be read, by way of explanation saying--    \"Tell me the meaning of this, or I shall cut your pay.\"    \"Rather give me next month's pay in advance, then I will explain.\"    Kamal Mani brought her mouth close to that of Srish Chandra, who took  the coin he wished. After reading the letter he said--    \"This is a joke!\"    \"What is? your words, or the letter?\"    \"The letter.\"    \"I shall discharge you to-day. Have you not a spark of understanding?  Is this a matter a woman could jest about?\"    \"It is impossible it can be meant in earnest.\"    \"I fear it is true.\"    \"Nonsense! How can it be true?\"    \"I fear my brother is forcing on this marriage.\"    Srish Chandra mused a while; then said, \"I cannot understand this at  all. What do you say? Shall I write to Nagendra?\"    Kamal Mani assented. Srish made "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/17461"],[0,"The Great German Composers (#16)"],[1,"and histrionic extravagance. Yet our composer's conscience shows  its completeness in his obedience to the law of opera; for the music he  has written to express the situations cannot be surpassed for beauty,  pathos, and passion. Beethoven, like Mendelssohn, revolted from the idea  of lyric drama as an art-inconsistency, but he wrote \"Fidelio\" to show  his possibilities in a direction with which he had but little sympathy.    He composed four overtures for this opera at different periods, on  account of the critical caprices of the Viennese public--a concession to  public taste which his stern independence rarely made.      IV.    Beethoven's relations with women were peculiar and characteristic, as  were all the phases of a nature singularly self-poised and robust. Like  all men of powerful imagination and keen (though perhaps not delicate)  sensibility, he was strongly attracted toward the softer sex. But a  certain austerity of morals, and that purity of feeling which is the  inseparable shadow of one's devotion to lofty aims, always kept  him within the bounds of Platonic affection. Yet there is enough  in Beethoven's letters, as scanty as their indications are in this  direction, to show what ardor and glow of feeling he possessed.    About the time that he was suffering keenly with the knowledge of his  fast-growing infirmity, he was bound by a strong tie of affection to  Countess Giulietta Guicciardi, his \"immortal beloved,\" \"his angel,\"  \"his all,\" \"his life,\" as he called her in a variety of passionate  utterances. It was to her that he dedicated his song \"Adelaida,\" which  as an expression of lofty passion is world-famous. Beethoven was very  much dissatisfied with the work even in the glow of composition. Before  the notes were dry on the music paper, the composer's old friend Barth  was announced. \"Here,\" said Beethoven, putting a roll of score paper in  Earth's hands, \"look at that. I have just finished it, and don't like  it. There is hardly fire enough in the stove to burn it, but I will  try.\" Barth glanced through the composition, then sang it, and soon grew  into such enthusiasm as to draw from Beethoven the expression, \"No?  then we will not burn it, old fellow.\" Whether it was the reaction of  disgust, which so often comes to genius after the tension of work, or  whether his ideal of its lovely theme was so high as to make all effort  seem inadequate, the world came very near losing what it could not  afford to have missed.    The charming countess, however, preferred rank, wealth, and unruffled  ease to being linked even with a great genius, if, indeed, the affair  ever looked in the direction of marriage. She married another, and  Beethoven does not seem to have been seriously disturbed. It may be  that, like Goethe, he valued the love of woman not for itself or its  direct results, but as an art-stimulus which should enrich and fructify  his own intellectual life.    We get glimpses of successors to the fair countess. The beautiful Marie  Pachler was for some time the object of his adoration. The affair is a  somewhat mysterious one, and the lady seems to have suffered from the  fire through which her powerful companion passed unscathed. Again,  quaintest and oddest of all, is the fancy kindled by that \"mysterious  sprite of genius,\" as one of her contemporaries calls her, Bettina  Brentano, the gifted child-woman, who fascinated all who came within her  reach, from Goethe and Beethoven down to princes and nobles. Goethe's  correspondence with this strange being has embalmed her life in classic  literature.    Our composer's intercourse with women--for he was always alive to the  charms of female society--was for the most part homely and practical in  the extreme, after his deafness destroyed the zest of the more romantic  phases of the divine passion. He accepted adoration, as did Dean Swift,  as a right. He permitted his female admirers to knit him stockings and  comforters, and make him dainty puddings and other delicacies, which he  devoured with huge gusto. He condescended, in return, to go to sleep on  their sofas, after picking his teeth with the candle-snuffers (so  says scandal), while they thrummed away at his sonatas, the artistic  slaughter of which Beethoven was mercifully unable to hear.      V.    The friendship of the Archduke Rudolph relieved Beethoven of the  immediate pressure of poverty; for in 1809 he settled a small  life-pension upon him. The next ten years were passed by him in  comparative ease and comfort, and in this time he gave to the world five  of his immortal symphonies, and a large number of his finest sonatas and  masses. His general health improved very much; and in his love for his  nephew Karl, whom Beethoven had adopted, the lonely man found an outlet  for his strong affections, which was medicine for his soul, though the  object was worthless and ungrateful.    We get curious and amusing insights into the daily tenor of Beethoven's  life during this period--things sometimes almost grotesque, were they  not so sad. The composer lived a solitary life, and was very much at the  mercy of his servants on account of his self-absorption and deafness.  He was much worried by these prosaic cares. One story of a slatternly  servant is as follows: The master was working at the mass in D, the  great work which he commenced in 1819 for the celebration of the  appointment of the Archduke Rudolph as Archbishop of Olmutz, and which  should have been completed by the following year. Beethoven, however,  became so engrossed with his work, and increased its proportions so  much, that it was not finished until some two years after the event  which it was intended to celebrate. While Beethoven was engaged upon  this score, he one day woke up to the fact that some of his pages were  missing. \"Where on earth could they be?\" he asked himself, and the  servant too; but the problem remained unsolved. Beethoven, beside  himself, spent hours and hours in searching, and so did the servant, but  it was all in vain. At last they gave up the task as a useless one, and  Beethoven, mad with despair, and pouring the very opposite to blessings  upon the head of her who, he believed, was the author of the mischief,  sat down with the conclusion that he must rewrite the missing part. He  had no sooner commenced a new Kyrie--for this was the movement which was  not to be found--than some loose sheets of score paper were discovered  in the kitchen! Upon examination they proved to be the identical pages  that Beethoven so much desired, and which the woman, in her anxiety to  be \"tidy\" and to \"keep things straight,\" had appropriated at some time  or other for wrapping up, not only old boots and clothes, but also some  superannuated pots and pans that were greasy and black!    Thus he was continually fretted by the carelessness or the rascality of  the servants in whom he was obliged to trust. He writes in his diary:  \"Nancy is too uneducated for a housekeeper--indeed, quite a beast.\" \"My  precious servants were occupied from seven o'clock till ten trying to  kindle a fire.\" \"The cook's off again.\" \"I shied half a dozen books at  her head.\" They made his dinner so nasty he couldn't eat it. \"No soup  to-day, no beef, no eggs. Got something from the inn at last.\"    His temper and peculiarities, too, made it difficult for him to live in  peace with landlords and fellow-lodgers. As his deafness increased, he  struck and thumped harder at the keys of his piano, the sound of which  he could scarcely hear. Nor was this all. The music that filled his  brain gave him no rest. He became an inspired madman. For hours he would  pace the room \"howling and roaring\" (as his pupil Ries puts it); or he  would stand beating time with hand and foot to the music which was  so vividly present to his mind. This soon put him into a feverish  excitement, when, to cool himself, he would take his water-jug, and,  thoughtless of everything, pour its contents over his hands, after which  he could sit down to his piano. With all this it can easily be imagined  that Beethoven was frequently remonstrated with. The landlord complained  of a damaged ceiling, and the fellow-lodgers declared that either they  or the madman must leave the house, for they could get no rest where he  was. So Beethoven never for long had a resting-place. Impatient at being  interfered with, he immediately packed up and went off to some other  vacant lodging. From this cause he was at one time paying the rent of  four lodgings at once. At times he would get tired of this changing from  one place to another--from the suburbs to the town--and then he would  fall back upon the hospitable home of a patron, once again taking  possession of an apartment which he had vacated, probably without  the least explanation or cause. One admirer of his genius, who always  reserved him a chamber in his establishment, used to say to his  servants: \"Leave it empty; Beethoven is sure to come back again.\"    The instant that Beethoven entered the house he began to write and  cipher on the walls, the blinds, the table, everything, in the most  abstracted manner. He frequently composed on slips of paper, which he  afterward misplaced, so that he had great difficulty in finding them. At  one time, indeed, he forgot his own name and the date of his birth.    It is said that he once went into a Viennese restaurant, and, instead of  giving an order, began to write a score on the back of the bill-of-fare,  absorbed and unconscious of time and place. At last he asked how much  he owed. \"You owe nothing, sir,\" said the waiter. \"What! do you think I  have not dined?\" \"Most assuredly.\" \"Very well, then, give me something.\"  \"What do you wish?\" \"Anything.\"    These infirmities do not belittle the man of genius, but set off his  greatness as with a foil. They illustrate the thought of Goethe: \"It is  all the same whether one is great or small, he has to pay the"]]]
