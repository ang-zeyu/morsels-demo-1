Unfortunately, Iaveh, who was by chance walking  in the garden, surprised them, and seeing that they had become wise, he  fell into a most ungovernable rage. It is in his jealous fits that he is  most to be feared. Assembling all his forces, he created such a turmoil  in the lower air that these two weak beings were terrified. The fruit  fell from the man's hand, and the woman, clinging to the neck of her  luckless husband, said, \"I too will be ignorant and suffer with him.\"  The triumphant Iaveh kept Adam and Eve and all their seed in a condition  of hebetude and terror. His art, which consisted only in being able to  make huge meteors, triumphed over the science of the serpent, who was a  musician and geometrician. He made men unjust, ignorant, and cruel,  and caused evil to reign in the earth. He persecuted Cain and his sons  because they were skilful workmen; he exterminated the Philistines  because they composed Orphic poems, and fables like those of AEsop. He  was the implacable enemy of science and beauty, and for long ages  the human race expiated, in blood and tears, the defeat of the winged  serpent. Fortunately, there arose among the Greeks learned men, such as  Pythagoras, and Plato, who recovered by the force of genius, the figures  and the ideas which the enemy of Iaveh had vainly tried to teach the  first woman. The soul of the serpent was in them; and that is why the  serpent, as Dorion has said, is honoured by the Athenians. Finally, in  these latter days, there appeared, under human form, three celestial  spirits--Jesus of Galilee, Basilides, and Valentinus--to whom it was  given to pluck the finest fruits of that tree of knowledge, whose roots  pass through all the earth, and whose top reaches to the highest heaven.  I have said all this in vindication of the Christians, to whom the  errors of the Jews are too often imputed.    DORION. If I understood you aright, Zenothemis, you said that three  wonderful men--Jesus, Basilides, and Valentinus--had discovered secrets  which had remained hidden from Pythagoras and Plato, and all the  philosophers of Greece, and even from the divine Epicurus, who, however,  has freed men from the dread of empty terrors. You would greatly oblige  me by telling me by what means these three mortals acquired knowledge  which had eluded the most contemplative sages.    ZENOTHEMIS. Must I repeat to you, Dorion, that science and cogitation  are but the first steps to knowledge, and that ecstasy alone leads to  eternal truth?    HERMODORUS. It is true, Zenothemis, that the soul is nourished on  ecstasy, as the cicada is nourished on dew. But we may even say more:  the mind alone is capable of perfect rapture. For man is of a threefold  nature, composed of material body, of a soul which is more subtle, but  also material, and of an incorruptible mind. When, emerging from the  body as from a palace suddenly given over to silence and solitude and  flying through the gardens of the soul, the mind diffuses itself in God,  it tastes the delights of an anticipated death, or rather of a future  life, for to die is to live; and in that condition, partaking of divine  purity, it possesses both infinite joy and complete knowledge. It enters  into the unity which is All. It is perfected.    NICIAS. That is very fine; but, to say the truth, Hermodorus, I do not  see much difference between All and Nothing. Words even seem to fail to  make the distinction. Infinity is terribly like nothingness--they are  both inconceivable to the mind. In my opinion perfection costs too dear;  we pay for it with all our being, and to possess it must cease to  exist. That is a calamity from which God Himself is not free, for the  philosophers are doing their best to perfect Him. After all, if we do  not know what it is _not_ to be, we are equally ignorant what it is to  _be_. We know nothing. It is said that it is impossible for men to agree  on this question. I believe--in spite of our noisy disputes--that it is,  on the contrary, impossible for men not to become some day all at unity  buried under the mass of contradictions, a Pelion on Ossa, which they  themselves have raised.    COTTA. I am very fond of philosophy, and study it in my leisure time.  But I never understand it well, except in Cicero's books. Slaves, pour  out the honeyed wine!    CALLICRATES. It is a singular thing, but when I am hungry I think of  the time when the tragic poets sat at the boards of good tyrants, and my  mouth waters. But when I have tasted the excellent wine that you give  us so abundantly, generous Lucius, I dream of nothing but civil wars and  heroic combats. I blush to live in such inglorious times; I invoke the  goddess of Liberty; and I pour out my blood--in imagination--with the  last Romans on the field of Philippi.    COTTA. In the days of the decline of the Republic my ancestors died with  Brutus--for liberty. But there is reason to suspect that what the  Roman people called liberty was only in reality the right to govern  themselves. I do not deny that liberty is the greatest boon a nation can  have. But the longer I live the more I am persuaded that only a strong  government can bestow it on the citizens. For forty years I have filled  high positions in the State, and my long experience has shown me  that when the ruling power is weak the people are oppressed. Those,  therefore, who--like the great majority of rhetoricians--try to weaken  the government, commit an abominable crime. An autocrat, who governs by  his single will, may sometimes cause most deplorable results; but if  he governs by popular consent there is no remedy possible. Before the  majesty of the Roman arms had bestowed peace upon all the world, the  only nations which were happy were those which were ruled over by  intelligent despots.    HERMODORUS. For my part, Lucius, I believe that there is no such thing  as a good form of government, and that we shall never discover one,  because the Greeks, who had so many excellent ideas, were never able to  find one. In that respect, therefore, all hope of ultimate success is  taken from us. Unmistakable signs show that the world is about to fall  into ignorance and barbarism. It has been our lot, Lucius, to witness  terrible events. Of all the mental satisfactions which intelligence,  learning, and virtue can give, all that remains is the cruel pleasure of  watching ourselves die.    COTTA. It is true that the rapacity of the people, and the boldness of  the barbarians, are threatening evils. But with a good fleet, a good  army, and plenty of money----    HERMODORUS. What is the use of deceiving ourselves? The dying empire  will become an easy prey to the barbarians. Cities which were built  by Hellenic genius, or Latin patience, will soon be sacked by drunken  savages. Neither art nor philosophy will exist any longer on the earth.  The statues of the gods will be overturned in the temples, and in men's  hearts as well. Darkness will overcome all minds, and the world will  die. Can we believe that the Sarmatians will ever devote themselves to  intelligent work, that the Germani will cultivate music and philosophy,  and that the Quadi and the Marcomani will adore the immortal gods? No!  we are sliding toward the abyss. Our old Egypt, which was the cradle  of the world, will be its burial vault; Serapis, the god of Death, will  receive the last adoration of mortals, and I shall have been the last  priest of the last god.    At this moment a strange figure raised the tapestry, and the guests saw  before them a little hunchback, whose bald skull rose in a point. He was  clad, in the Asiatic fashion, in a blue tunic, and wore round his legs,  like the barbarians, red breeches, spangled with gold stars. On  seeing him, Paphnutius recognised Marcus the Arian, and fearing lest a  thunderbolt should fall from heaven, he covered his head with his arms,  and grew pale with fright. At this banquet of the demons, neither the  blasphemies of the pagans, nor the horrible errors of the philosophers,  had had any effect on him, but the mere presence of the heretic quenched  his courage. He would have fled, but his eyes met those of Thais, and  he felt at once strengthened. He read in her soul that she, who was  predestined to become a saint, already protected him. He seized the  skirt of her long, flowing robe, and inwardly prayed to the Saviour  Jesus.    A murmur of acclamation welcomed the arrival of the personage who had  been called the Christian Plato. Hermodorus was the first to speak.    \"Most illustrious Marcus, we rejoice to see you amongst us, and it  may be said that you come at the right moment. We know nothing of the  Christian doctrine, beyond what is publicly taught. Now, it is certain  that a philosopher, like you, cannot think as the vulgar think, and  we are curious to know your opinion of the principal mysteries of the  religion you profess. Our dear friend, Zenothemis, who, as you know,  is always hunting for symbolic meanings, just now questioned the  illustrious Paphnutius concerning the Jewish books. But Paphnutius made  no reply, and we should not be surprised at that, as our guest has made  a vow of silence, and God has sealed his tongue in the desert. But  you Marcus, who have spoken at the Christian synods, and even at  the councils of the divine Constantine, can if you wish, satisfy our  curiosity by revealing to us the philosophic truths which are wrapped up  in the Christian fables. Is not the first of these truths the existence  of an only God--in whom, for my part, I fervently believe?\"    MARCUS. Yes, venerable brethren, I believe in an only God, not  begotten--the only Eternal, the origin of all things.    NICIAS. We know, Marcus, that your God created the world. That must  certainly have been a great crisis in His existence. He had already  existed an eternity before He could"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/20781"],[0,"Heidi (#16)"],[1,"remained firm, however, promising to take  her to Switzerland himself the following summer, if she was good and  sensible now. So the child, resigning herself, begged to have Heidi's  trunk packed in her room. Mr. Sesemann encouraged her to get together  a good outfit for her little friend.    Heidi's aunt had arrived in the meantime. Being told to take her niece  home with her, she found no end of excuses, which plainly showed that  she did not want to do it; for Deta well remembered the uncle's  parting words. Mr. Sesemann dismissed her and summoned Sebastian. The  butler was told to get ready for travelling with the child. He was to  go to Basle that day and spend the night at a good hotel which his  master named. The next day the child was to be brought to her home.    \"Listen, Sebastian,\" Mr. Sesemann said, \"and do exactly as I tell you.  I know the Hotel in Basle, and if you show my card they will give you  good accommodations. Go to the child's room and barricade the windows,  so that they can only be opened by the greatest force. When Heidi has  gone to bed, lock the door from outside, for the child walks in her  sleep and might come to harm in the strange hotel. She might get up  and open the door; do you understand?\"    \"Oh!--Oh!--So it was she?\" exclaimed the butler.    \"Yes, it was! You are a coward, and you can tell John he is the same.  Such foolish men, to be afraid!\" With that Mr. Sesemann went to his  room to write a letter to Heidi's grandfather.    Sebastian, feeling ashamed, said to himself that he ought to have  resisted John and found out alone.    Heidi was dressed in her Sunday frock and stood waiting for further  commands.    Mr. Sesemann called her now. \"Good-morning, Mr. Sesemann,\" Heidi said  when she entered.    \"What do you think about it, little one?\" he asked her. Heidi looked  up to him in amazement.    \"You don't seem to know anything about it,\" laughed Mr. Sesemann.  Tinette had not even told the child, for she thought it beneath her  dignity to speak to the vulgar Heidi.    \"You are going home to-day.\"    \"Home?\" Heidi repeated in a low voice. She had to gasp, so great was  her surprise.    \"Wouldn't you like to hear something about it?\" asked Mr. Sesemann  smiling.    \"Oh yes, I should like to,\" said the blushing child.    \"Good, good,\" said the kind gentleman. \"Sit down and eat a big  breakfast now, for you are going away right afterwards.\"    The child could not even swallow a morsel, though she tried to eat out  of obedience. It seemed to her as if it was only a dream.    \"Go to Clara, Heidi, till the carriage comes,\" Mr. Sesemann said  kindly.    Heidi had been wishing to go, and now she ran to Clara's room, where a  huge trunk was standing.    \"Heidi, look at the things I had packed for you. Do you like them?\"  Clara asked.    There were a great many lovely things in it, but Heidi jumped for joy  when she discovered a little basket with twelve round white rolls for  the grandmother. The children had forgotten that the moment for  parting had come, when the carriage was announced. Heidi had to get  all her own treasures from her room yet. The grandmama's book was  carefully packed, and the red shawl that Miss Rottenmeier had  purposely left behind. Then putting on her pretty hat, she left her  room to say good-bye to Clara. There was not much time left to do so,  for Mr. Sesemann was waiting to put Heidi in the carriage. When Miss  Rottenmeier, who was standing on the stairs to bid farewell to her  pupil, saw the red bundle in Heidi's hand, she seized it and threw it  on the ground. Heidi looked imploringly at her kind protector, and Mr.  Sesemann, seeing how much she treasured it, gave it back to her. The  happy child at parting thanked him for all his goodness. She also sent  a message of thanks to the good old doctor, whom she suspected to be  the real cause of her going.    While Heidi was being lifted into the carriage, Mr. Sesemann assured  her that Clara and he would never forget her. Sebastian followed with  Heidi's basket and a large bag with provisions. Mr. Sesemann called  out: \"Happy journey!\" and the carriage rolled away.    Only when Heidi was sitting in the train did she become conscious of  where she was going. She knew now that she would really see her  grandfather and the grandmother again, also Peter and the goats. Her  only fear was that the poor blind grandmother might have died while  she was away.    The thing she looked forward to most was giving the soft white rolls  to the grandmother. While she was musing over all these things, she  fell asleep. In Basle she was roused by Sebastian, for there they were  to spend the night.    The next morning they started off again, and it took them many hours  before they reached Mayenfeld. When Sebastian stood on the platform of  the station, he wished he could have travelled further in the train  rather than have to climb a mountain. The last part of the trip might  be dangerous, for everything seemed half-wild in this country. Looking  round, he discovered a small wagon with a lean horse. A  broad-shouldered man was just loading up large bags, which had come by  the train. Sebastian, approaching the man, asked some information  concerning the least dangerous ascent to the Alp. After a while it was  settled that the man should take Heidi and her trunk to the village  and see to it that somebody would go up with her from there.    Not a word had escaped Heidi, until she now said, \"I can go up alone  from the village. I know the road.\" Sebastian felt relieved, and  calling Heidi to him, presented her with a heavy roll of bills and a  letter for the grandfather. These precious things were put at the  bottom of the basket, under the rolls, so that they could not possibly  get lost.    Heidi promised to be careful of them, and was lifted up to the cart.  The two old friends shook hands and parted, and Sebastian, with a  slightly bad conscience for having deserted the child so soon, sat  down on the station to wait for a returning train.    The driver was no other than the village baker, who had never seen  Heidi but had heard a great deal about her. He had known her parents  and immediately guessed she was the child who had lived with the  Alm-Uncle. Curious to know why she came home again, he began a  conversation.    \"Are you Heidi, the child who lived with the Alm-Uncle?\"    \"Yes.\"    \"Why are you coming home again? Did you get on badly?\"    \"Oh no; nobody could have got on better than I did in Frankfurt.\"    \"Then why are you coming back?\"    \"Because Mr. Sesemann let me come.\"    \"Pooh! why didn't you stay?\"    \"Because I would rather be with my grandfather on the Alp than  anywhere on earth.\"    \"You may think differently when you get there,\" muttered the baker.  \"It is strange though, for she must know,\" he said to himself.    They conversed no more, and Heidi began to tremble with excitement  when she recognized all the trees on the road and the lofty peaks of  the mountains. Sometimes she felt as if she could not sit still any  longer, but had to jump down and run with all her might. They arrived  at the village at the stroke of five. Immediately a large group of  women and children surrounded the cart, for the trunk and the little  passenger had attracted everybody's notice. When Heidi had been lifted  down, she found herself held and questioned on all sides. But when  they saw how frightened she was, they let her go at last. The baker  had to tell of Heidi's arrival with the strange gentleman, and assured  all the people that Heidi loved her grandfather with all her heart,  let the people say what they would about him.    Heidi, in the meantime, was running up the path; from time to time she  was obliged to stop, for her basket was heavy and she lost her  breath. Her one idea was: \"If only grandmother still sits in her  corner by her spinning wheel!--Oh, if she should have died!\" When the  child caught sight of the hut at last, her heart began to beat. The  quicker she ran, the more it beat, but at last she tremblingly opened  the door. She ran into the middle of the room, unable to utter one  tone, she was so out of breath.    \"Oh God,\" it sounded from one corner, \"our Heidi used to come in like  that. Oh, if I just could have her again with me before I die. Who has  come?\"    \"Here I am! grandmother, here I am!\" shouted the child, throwing  herself on her knees before the old woman. She seized her hands and  arms and snuggling up to her did not for joy utter one more word. The  grandmother had been so surprised that she could only silently caress  the child's curly hair over and over again. \"Yes, yes,\" she said at  last, \"this is Heidi's hair, and her beloved voice. Oh my God, I thank  Thee for this happiness.\" Out of her blind eyes big tears of joy fell  down on Heidi's hand. \"Is it really you, Heidi? Have you really come  again?\"    \"Yes, yes, grandmother,\" the child replied. \"You must not cry, for I  have come and will never leave you any more. Now you won't have to eat  hard black bread any more for a little while. Look what I have brought  you.\"    Heidi put one roll after another into the grandmother's lap.    \"Ah, child, what a blessing you bring to me!\" the old woman cried.  \"But you are my greatest blessing yourself, Heidi!\" Then, caressing  the child's hair and flushed cheeks, she entreated: \"Just say one more  word, that I may hear your voice.\"    While Heidi was talking, Peter's mother arrived, and exclaimed in her  amazement: \"Surely, this is Heidi. But how can that be?\"    The child rose to shake hands with Brigida, who could not get over  Heidi's splendid frock and hat.    \"You can have my hat, I don't want it any more; I have my old one  still,\" Heidi said, pulling out her old crushed straw hat. Heidi had  remembered her grandfather's words to Deta about her feather hat; that  was why she had kept her old hat so carefully. Brigida at last  accepted the gift after a great many"]]]
