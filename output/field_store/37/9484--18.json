That the males do not take on the protective colouring  is easily explained, because they are in general more numerous, and  the females are more important for the preservation of the species,  and must also live longer in order to deposit their eggs. We find the  same state of things in many other species, and in one case (_Elymnias  undularis_) in which the male is also mimetically coloured, it copies  quite a differently coloured immune species from the model followed by  the female. This is quite intelligible when we consider that if there  were _too many_ false immune types, the birds would soon discover that  there were palatable individuals among those with unpalatable warning  colours. Hence the imitation of different immune species by _Papilio  dardanus_!    I regret that lack of space prevents my bringing forward more examples  of mimicry and discussing them fully. But from the case of _Papilio  dardanus_ alone there is much to be learnt which is of the highest  importance for our understanding of transformations. It shows us  chiefly what I once called, somewhat strongly perhaps, _the  omnipotence of natural selection_ in answer to an opponent who had  spoken of its \"inadequacy.\" We here see that one and the same species  is capable of producing four or five different patterns of colouring  and marking; thus the colouring and marking are not, as has often been  supposed, a necessary outcome of the specific nature of the species,  but a true adaptation, which cannot arise as a direct effect of  climatic conditions, but solely through what I may call the sorting  out of the variations produced by the species, according to their  utility. That caterpillars may be either green or brown is already  something more than could have been expected according to the old  conception of species, but that one and the same butterfly should be  now pale yellow, with black; now red with black and pure white; now  deep black with large, pure white spots; and again black with a large  ocheous-yellow spot, and many small white and yellow spots; that in  one sub-species it may be tailed like the ancestral form, and in  another tailless like its Danaid model,--all this shows a far-reaching  capacity for variation and adaptation that we could never have  expected if we did not see the facts before us. How it is possible  that the primary colour-variations should thus be intensified and  combined remains a puzzle even now; we are reminded of the modern  three-colour printing,--perhaps similar combinations of the primary  colours take place in this case; in any case the direction of these  primary variations is determined by the artist whom we know as natural  selection, for there is no other conceivable way in which the model  could affect the butterfly that is becoming more and more like it. The  same climate surrounds all four forms of female; they are subject to  the same conditions of nutrition. Moreover, _Papilio dardanus_ is by  no means the only species of butterfly which exhibits different kinds  of colour-pattern on its wings. Many species of the Asiatic genus  Elymnias have on the upper surface a very good imitation of an immune  Euploeine (Danainae), often with a steel-blue ground-colour, while the  under surface is well concealed when the butterfly is at rest,--thus  there are two kinds of protective coloration each with a different  meaning! The same thing may be observed in many non-mimetic  butterflies, for instance in all our species of Vanessa, in which the  under side shows a grey-brown or brownish-black protective coloration,  but we do not yet know with certainty what may be the biological  significance of the gaily coloured upper surface.    In general it may be said that mimetic butterflies are comparatively  rare species, but there are exceptions, for instance _Limenitis  archippus_ in North America, of which the immune model (_Danaida  plexippus_) also occurs in enormous numbers.    In another mimicry-category the imitators are often more numerous than  the models, namely in the case of the imitation of _dangerous insects_  by harmless species. Bees and wasps are dreaded for their sting, and  they are copied by harmless flies of the genera Eristalis and Syrphus,  and these mimics often occur in swarms about flowering plants without  damage to themselves or to their models; they are feared and are  therefore left unmolested.    In regard also to the _faithfulness of the copy_ the facts are quite  in harmony with the theory, according to which the resemblance must  have arisen and increased _by degrees_. We can recognise this in many  cases, for even now the mimetic species show very _varying degrees of  resemblance_ to their immune model. If we compare, for instance, the  many different imitators of _Danaida chrysippus_ we find that, with  their brownish-yellow ground-colour, and the position and size, and  more or less sharp limitation of their clear marginal spots, they have  reached very different degrees of nearness to their model. Or compare  the female of _Elymnias undularis_ with its model _Danaida genutia_;  there is a general resemblance, but the marking of the Danaida is very  roughly imitated in Elymnias.    Another fact that bears out the theory of mimicry is, that even when  the resemblance in colour-pattern is very great, the _wing-venation_,  which is so constant, and so important in determining the systematic  position of butterflies, is never affected by the variation. The  pursuers of the butterfly have no time to trouble about entomological  intricacies.    I must not pass over a discovery of Poulton's which is of great  theoretical importance--that mimetic butterflies may reach the same  effect by very different means.[50] Thus the glass-like transparency  of the wing of a certain Ithomiine (Methona) and its Pierine mimic  (_Dismorphia orise_) depends on a diminution in the size of the  scales; in the Danaine genus Itune it is due to the fewness of the  scales and in a third imitator, a moth (_Castnia linus var.  heliconoides_) the glass-like appearance of the wing is due neither to  diminution nor to absence of scales, but to their absolute  colourlessness and transparency, and to the fact that they stand  upright. In another moth mimic (Anthomyza) the arrangement of the  transparent scales is normal. Thus it is not some unknown external  influence that has brought about the transparency of the wing in these  five forms, as has sometimes been supposed. Nor is it a hypothetical  _internal_ evolutionary tendency, for all three vary in a different  manner. The cause of this agreement can only lie in selection, which  preserves and intensifies in each species the favourable variations  that present themselves. The great faithfulness of the copy is  astonishing in these cases, for it is not _the whole_ wing which is  transparent; certain markings are black in colour, and these contrast  sharply with the glass-like ground. It is obvious that the pursuers of  these butterflies must be very sharp-sighted, for otherwise the  agreement between the species could never have been pushed so far. The  less the enemies see and observe, the more defective must the  imitation be, and if they had been blind, no visible resemblance  between the species which required protection could ever have arisen.    A seemingly irreconcilable contradiction to the mimicry theory is  presented in the following cases, which were known to Bates, who,  however, never succeeded in bringing them into line with the principle  of mimicry.    In South America there are, as we have already said, many mimics of  the immune Ithomiinae (or as Bates called them Heliconidae). Among  these there occur not merely species which are edible, and thus  require the protection of a disguise, but others which are rejected on  account of their unpalatableness. How could the Ithomiine dress have  developed in their case, and of what use is it, since the species  would in any case be immune? In Eastern Brazil, for instance, there  are four butterflies, which bear a most confusing resemblance to one  another in colour, marking, and form of wing, and all four are  unpalatable to birds. They belong to four different genera and three  sub-families, and we have to inquire: Whence came this resemblance and  what end does it serve? For a long time no satisfactory answer could  be found, but Fritz Mueller,[51] seventeen years after Bates, offered a  solution to the riddle, when he pointed out that young birds could not  have an instinctive knowledge of the unpalatableness of the  Ithomiines, but must learn by experience which species were edible and  which inedible. Thus each young bird must have tasted at least one  individual of each inedible species and discovered its unpalatability,  before it learnt to avoid, and thus to spare the species. But if the  four species resemble each other very closely the bird will regard  them all as of the same kind, and avoid them all. Thus there developed  a process of selection which resulted in the survival of the  Ithomiine-like individuals, and in so great an increase of resemblance  between the four species, that they are difficult to distinguish one  from another even in a collection. The advantage for the four species,  living side by side as they do e.g. in Bahia, lies in the fact that  only one individual from the _mimicry-ring_ (\"inedible association\")  need be tasted by a young bird, instead of at least four individuals,  as would otherwise be the case. As the number of young birds is great,  this makes a considerable difference in the ratio of elimination. The  four Brazilian species are _Lycorea halia_ (Danainae), _Heliconius  narcaea_ (_eucrate_) (Heliconinae), _Melinaea ethra_, and _Mechanitis  lysimnia_ (Ithomiinae).    These interesting mimicry-rings (trusts), which have"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/22460"],[0,"New York Times Current History; The European War, Vol 2, No. 5, August, 1915 (#16)"],[1,"ent. To provide the lacking sanction and  the physical force capable of compelling the payment of penalties for  violating international agreements would be one of the best functions  of the international council which the present alliance foreshadows.  Some years would probably be required to satisfy the nations concerned  that the sanction was real and the force trustworthy and sufficient.  The absolute necessity of inventing and applying a sanction for  international law, if Europe is to have international peace and any  national liberty, will be obvious to any one who has once perceived  that the present war became inevitable when Austria-Hungary, in  violation of an international agreement to which she was herself a  party, seized and absorbed Bosnia and Herzegovina, and became general  and fierce when Germany, under Prussian lead, in violation of an  international agreement to which she was herself a party, entered and  plundered neutralized Belgium.    A strong, trustworthy international alliance to preserve the freedom  of the seas under all circumstances would secure for Great Britain and  her federated commonwealths everything secured by the burdensome  two-navies policy which now secures the freedom of the seas for  British purposes. The same international alliance would secure for  Germany the same complete freedom of the seas which in times of peace  between Germany and Great Britain she has long enjoyed by favor of  Great Britain, but has lost in time of war with the Triple Entente.  This security, with the general acceptance of the policy of the \"open  door,\" would fully meet Germany's need of indefinite expansion for her  manufacturing industries and her commerce, and of room \"in the sun\"  for her surplus population.    It is a safe inference from the events of the past six months that the  longer the war lasts the more significant will be the political and  social changes which result from it. It is not to be expected, and  perhaps not to be desired, that the ruling class in the countries  autocratically governed should themselves draw this inference at  present, but all lovers of freedom and justice will find consolation  for the prolongation of the war in this hopeful reflection.    To devise the wise constitution of an international council or  commission with properly limited powers, and to determine the most  promising composition of an international army and an international  navy are serious tasks, but not beyond the available international  wisdom and goodwill, provided that the tasks be intrusted to  international publicists, business men of large experience, and  successful administrators, rather than to professional diplomatists  and soldiers. To dismiss such a noble enterprise with the remark that  it is \"academic,\" or beyond the reach of \"practical\" politics, is  unworthy of courageous and humane men; for it seems now to be the only  way out of the horrible abyss into which civilization has fallen. At  any rate, some such machinery must be put into successful operation  before any limitation of national armaments can be effected. The war  has shown to what a catastrophe competitive national arming has led,  and would probably again lead the most civilized nations of Europe.  Shall the white race despair of escaping from this hell? The only way  of escape in sight is the establishment of a rational international  community. Should the enterprise fail after fair trial, the world will  be no worse off than it was in July, 1914, or is today.    Whoever studies the events of the past year with some knowledge of  political philosophy and history, and with the love of his neighbor in  his heart, will discover, amid the horrors of the time and its moral  chaos, three hopeful leadings for humanitarian effort, each involving  a great constructive invention. He will see that humanity needs  supremely a sanction for international law, rescue from alcoholism,  and a sound basis for just and unselfish human relations in the great  industries, and particularly in the machinery industries. The war has  brought out all three of these needs with terrible force and  vividness. Somehow they must be met, if the white race is to succeed  in \"the pursuit of happiness,\" or even to hold the gains already made.    CHARLES W. ELIOT.          \"Revenge for Elisabeth!\"      _The Vienna \"Arbeiter Zeitung\" of June 22, 1915, prints the appeal of  Dr. Wolfgang Madjera, a well-known authority on municipal affairs,  which he has issued to Austrian soldiers departing for the Italian  front. He says:_    \"The day has arrived,\" says Herr Madjera, \"when you will have to  revenge your murdered Empress [the late Empress Elisabeth who was  murdered in Geneva by an Italian named Luccheni]. It was a son of that  land which has now committed a scandalous act of treason on Austria  who made your old Emperor a lonely man on his throne of thorns. Take a  thousandfold revenge on the brethren of that miserable wretch.  Austria's warriors feel the strength within them to defeat and smash  with iron hand the raised hand of the murderer. It is Luccheni's  spirit which leads the army of our enemy. May Elisabeth's spirit lead  our spirit!\"          A Year of the War in Africa and Asia    By Charles Johnston      I. RE-MAPPING THE WORLD.    Speaking on July 14, A. Bonar Law, British Colonial Secretary,  announced that the Entente Allies have already occupied 450,000 square  miles of German colonial possessions. Add Turkish possessions in Asia  in the hands of the Entente powers, and the total reaches 500,000  square miles.    Two outstanding facts are that this transfer, if permanent, will  change the destiny of all Africa and Asia, and that, for the first  time in history, the oversea dominions of Britain have initiated and  carried on wars of conquest, Australia and New Zealand, in union,  having already taken 100,000 square miles of German colonies in the  Pacific; while the Union of South Africa has conquered German  Southwest Africa.    In other parts of Africa, France and Belgium are co-operating with  English imperial forces, while in East Africa and on the Persian Gulf  the brunt of the fighting is being borne by British Indian troops and  troops provided by the Princes of India. The movement now in progress  will, if completed, give the Entente powers the whole of Africa; will  give Britain all Southern Asia, from the Mount Sinai peninsula to  Siam; and will, in all probability, make the Entente powers heirs of  the whole Eastern Hemisphere.    These immense territories are the ultimate stakes of the battles in  France, in Poland, on the Dardanelles. We lose sight of them, perhaps,  in the details of local fighting. In reality, nothing less is being  effected than the re-mapping of the whole eastern hemisphere.      II. TOGOLAND AND KAMERUN.    On Aug. 1, a year ago, German colonial possessions in Africa totaled  over a million square miles, in four regions--Togo, Kamerun, Southwest  Africa, and East Africa. Togo, running from the north shore of the  Gulf of Guinea, is wedged between French and English colonies. In  August, France and England joined in attacking it, and on Aug. 26  their occupation was complete, a rich area of 33,000 square miles thus  passing from Germany to the Entente powers.    [Illustration: Togo, the German Colony which was surrendered to a  Franco-English expeditionary force.]    [Illustration: German East Africa    Scene of Operation of Anglo-French forces against the German Colony of  Kamerun]    Kamerun, in the elbow of the Gulf of Guinea, is about ten times as  large, one-third of this having been conceded by France to Germany in  1911, through the agency of M. Caillaux. Recent letters to The  London Times describe the fighting there:         On the 7th (May) we had a trying experience. Our company       commander went out with myself and another subaltern and       about forty men. We crossed the Mungo River in canoes, and       then did a long and very difficult march all through the       night in absolute dense forest. However the guides managed       it passes comprehension.         About 5 in the morning, when it was just getting light, our       advance party were just on the point of stumbling on to the       German outpost, when what should happen but an elephant       suddenly walked in between and scattered our opposing       parties in all directions. I was in the rear of our little       column, and was left in bewilderment, all our carriers       dropping their loads and every one disappearing into the       bush. After a few minutes we got our men together and our       scouts went forward again, and found the Germans had bolted       from their outpost, but soon returned and opened fire on our       scouts.    A British officer writes:         I hope you have heard ere this of our capture of Duala and       Bonaberi, and our further advance along the Duala Railway to       Tusa, and along the Wari River to Jabassi. The heat and       climate are very trying. It's awfully hot, far hotter than       the last coast place I was in; a drier heat and sun       infinitely more powerful, and yet the rains are full on and       we get terrific tornadoes. The nights, however, are cooler.         We are surrounded by mangrove swamps, and they breed       mosquitos, and consequently malaria and black-water fever.         This is quite a pretty little place (Duala) with some jolly       houses, typical German of the Schloss villa type; nice       inside and out. The country is pretty, the soil good. A good       deal of timber and rubber. I found some beautiful tusks the       other day, worth a good bit. Elephants abound. The native       villages around are totally different from other West       African ones--here their houses are mostly one long mud or       palm erection, with thatched roof, and are divided into       compartments instead of the smaller separate huts one is       accustomed "]]]
