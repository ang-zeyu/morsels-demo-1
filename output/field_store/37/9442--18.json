Even before the  battle of the Fallen Timbers, he urged his people to treat with Wayne  rather than fight. \"We have beaten the enemy twice under separate  commanders,\" he said, referring to Har-mar and St. Clair. \"The Americans  are now led by a chief who never stops; the night and the day are alike  to him. And during all the time that he has been marching upon your  villages, notwithstanding the watchfulness of our young men, we have  never been able to surprise him. Think well of it. There is something  which whispers to me that it will be prudent to listen to his offers of  peace.\"          XIII. INDIAN FIGHTERS.    In the long war with the Indians, the great battles were nearly all  fought within the region that afterwards became our state, and the  smaller battles went on there pretty constantly. The first force on  the scale of an army sent against the Ohio tribes was that of Colonel  Bouquet in 1766; but, as we have seen, the chief object of this was  to treat for the return of their white captives. In 1774 Lord Dunmore  marched with three thousand Virginians to destroy the Indian towns on  the Scioto in Pickaway County. He cannot be said to have led his men,  who believed in neither his courage nor his good faith, and who thought  that he was more anxious to treat with the savages for the advantage  of England in the Revolutionary War, which he knew was coming, than to  attack their capital. This was that Old Chillicothe, which has been so  often mentioned before, and here Dunmore made peace with the Indians,  instead of punishing them, as the backwoodsmen expected. The feeling  among them was so bitter that one of them fired through Dunmore's tent  where he sat with two chiefs, hoping to kill all three. He missed, but  he easily escaped among his comrades, who looked upon Dunmore as an  enemy of their country and a traitor to their cause.    Their spirit, both lawless and fearless, was the spirit of that race of  Indian Fighters, as they were called, which grew up on the border in  the war ending with Wayne's victory. It led them into countless acts of  daring and into many acts of cruelty, and the story of their adventures  is too bloody to be fully told. But unless something of it is told we  cannot have a true notion of what the life of our backwoodsmen was.  We have seen what they could do when they were at their worst in the  Gnadenhutten massacre; but we cannot understand them unless we realize  that they not only held all life cheap, but held the life of an Indian  no dearer than that of a wolf.    Belmont County was the scene of two exploits of Lewis Wetzel, perhaps  the most famous of these Indian fighters. One day he went home with a  young man whom he met while hunting, and they found the cabin burnt and  the whole family murdered except a girl who had lived with them, and  whom the young man was in love with. They started on the trail of  the Indians who had done the cruel deed, and came up with them after  nightfall sleeping round their camp-fire. The girl was awake, crying  and lamenting, and Wetzel had great ado to keep her lover from firing at  once upon the Indians. But he made him wait for daylight, so that they  could be sure of their aim; and then at the first light of dawn, they  each chose his mark and fired. Each killed his Indian, but two others  escaped into the woods, while the lover rushed, knife in hand, to free  the girl. Wetzel made after the Indians, firing into the air to draw  them out of their concealment. Then he turned, loading as he ran, and  wheeled about and shot the Indian nearest him. He fled again, dodging  from tree to tree till his gun was reloaded, when he shot the last  Indian left. He took their scalps, and got home with the girl and her  lover unhurt.    In 1782, together with one of Crawford's men, he fell in with a party  of forty Indians about two miles from St. Clairsville. Both sides  fired; Wetzel killed one of the Indians, but his friend was wounded and  promptly scalped, while four of the Indians followed Wetzel. He turned,  shot the foremost, and ran on, loading his rifle. The next was so close  upon him that when Wetzel turned again, the Indian caught the muzzle  of his gun. After a fearful struggle Wetzel got it against the Indian's  breast, pulled the trigger, and killed him. The remaining two followed  him a mile farther, and then Wetzel shot one of them as he was crossing  a piece of open ground. The last left of the Indians stopped with a  yell, and Wetzel heard him say as he turned back, \"No catch that man;  gun always loaded.\"    Wetzel had fought Indians nearly all his life. When he was a boy of  fourteen they attacked his father's cabin in Virginia, and Wetzel  was wounded before he was taken prisoner, with a younger brother, and  carried into the Ohio wilderness. One night the Indians forgot to tie  their captives, and the two boys escaped. Lewis returned to the camp,  after they had stolen away, for a pair of moccasins, and again for his  father's rifle, which the Indians had carried off. They followed the  boys, but the young Wetzels got safely back to the Ohio, and crossed the  river on a raft which they made of logs.    [Illustration: Wetzel, Indian Fighter 122]    In 1786 the settlers of Wheeling, who had been troubled by Indians,  offered a purse of a hundred dollars to the man who should first bring  in a scalp. A party crossed the Ohio, but after some days turned back,  leaving Wetzel alone in the woods, where he roamed about looking for  Indians. The second morning he came upon one sleeping, and drove his  knife through his heart. Then he went home with his scalp, and got the  reward.    One of the tricks of the savages was to imitate the cry, or call, of the  wild turkey and then to shoot the hunter who came looking for the bird.  Wetzel was one day in the woods when this call came to his ear from the  mouth of a cave, a place where several whites had been found scalped.  He watched till the feathered tuft of an Indiana head appeared from  the cave. The call of the wild turkey sounded, and at the same time the  sharp crack of Wetzel's rifle noted the Indian's death.    It was Wetzel's habit in the autumn to go on a long hunt into the Ohio  country. Once he went as far as the Muskingum, some ninety miles from  Wheeling, when he came on a camp of four Indians. He crept upon them  with no weapon but his knife, which he drove through the skulls of two  as they lay asleep. The two others struggled to their feet stupefied;  Wetzel killed one of them, but the fourth escaped in the shadow of the  woods. When Wetzel returned and was asked what his luck in hunting had  been, he said, \"Not much; I treed four Indians, but one got away.\"    These were acts of war, but they were very like mere murders, and one  of Wetzel's exploits could hardly be called anything but murder. General  Har-mar in 1779 had invited the Indians to come and make peace with him  in the fort near where Marietta now stands. Wetzel and another Indian  fighter lay in wait for the envoys who passed from the tribes to the  general, and in pure wantonness, shot one. He then took refuge with his  friends at Mingo Bottom, where the officer sent by Harmar to arrest  him, dared not even attempt it. Wetzel was the hero and darling of the  border, where the notion of punishing a man for shooting an Indian was  laughed at. But after a while he was taken, and lodged, heavily ironed,  in the fort. He sent for the general and asked him to give him up, with  a tomahawk, to a large band of armed Indians present, and let him fight  for his life with them. Of course Harmar could not do this, but Wetzel  won upon him so far that the general had his fetters removed, leaving  only the manacles on his wrists, and allowed him to walk about outside  the fort. He made a sudden dash for the woods; the guards fired upon  him, but Wetzel got safely away; and at a distant point he reached the  Ohio. He could not swim, with his hands in irons, but by good luck he  saw a friend on the Virginia shore, who came in answer to his signs and  set him over in his canoe. Later the soldiers found him in a tavern  at Marysville, and arrested him again. He was taken to the fort at  Cincinnati, where Harmar was now in command, but he was released by a  judge of the court just in time to save the fort from an attack by  the backwoodsmen, who were furious that Wetzel should be so persecuted  simply for killing an Indian.    One of the stories told of Wetzel's skill in Indian warfare relates to  an adventure he had after his escape from hanging by the soldiers. He  was coming home at the end of a hunt in the Ohio woods when he saw an  Indian lifting up his gun to fire. Each sprang behind a tree, and each  waited patiently for the other to expose himself. At last Wetzel put his  bearskin cap on his ramrod, and pushed it a little beyond the edge of  his shelter. The Indian took it for his enemy's head and fired. Before  he could load again Wetzel was upon him, and his end had come.    It is not easy for us at this day to understand how a man so  blood-stained as this should be by no means the worst man of the border.  Wetzel is said to have been even exemplary in his life apart from his  Indian killing, which, indeed, was accounted no wrong, but rather a  virtue by his savage white friends. In person he might well take their  rude fancy. He was tall, full-chested, and broad-shouldered; his dark  face was deeply pitted with smallpox; his hair, which he was very proud  of, fell to his knees when loose; his black eyes, when he was roused,  shone with dangerous fire. He was silent and shy with strangers, but the  life of any party of comrades. It is not certainly known how or where he  died. Some say that he went South, and ended his stormy life quietly at  Natchez; others that he went "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/21391"],[0,"Great African Travellers: From Mungo Park to Livingstone and Stanley (#16)"],[1,"by a large body of cavalry, who, as they  moved on, shouted the Arab war-cry.  Denham thought he could perceive a  smile pass between Barca Gana and his chief, at poor Boo-Khaloum's  expense.    Durkulla was quickly burned, and another small town near it.  The few  inhabitants found in them, being infants or aged persons, unable to  escape, were put to death or thrown into the flames.  A third town,  called Musfeia, built on a rising ground, and capable of being defended  against assailants ten times as numerous as the besiegers, was next  reached.  A strong fence of palisades, well pointed, and fastened  together with thongs of raw hide, six feet in height, had been carried  from one hill to the other.  Felatah bowmen were placed behind the  palisades and on the rising ground, with a _wady_ before them, while  their horses were all under cover of the hills.  This was a strong  position.  The Arabs, however, moved on with great gallantry, without  any support from the Bornou or Mandara troops, and, notwithstanding the  showers of arrows, some poisoned, which were poured on them from behind  the palisades, Boo-Khaloum carried them in about half an hour, and  dashed on, driving the Felatahs up the sides of the hills.  The women  were everywhere seen supplying their protectors with fresh arrows, till  they retreated, still shooting on their pursuers.  The women also rolled  down huge masses of rock, killing several Arabs.  Barca Gana, with his  spearmen, at length advanced to the support of Boo-Khaloum, and pierced  through and through some fifty unfortunates, who were left wounded near  the stakes.  The major rode by his side into the town, where a desperate  skirmish took place, but Barca Gana with his muscular arm threw eight  spears, some at a distance of thirty yards or more, which all told.  Had  either the Mandara or the sheikh's troops now moved up boldly, they must  have carried the town and the heights above it.  Instead of this, they  kept on the other side of the _wady_, out of reach of the arrows.  The  Felatahs, seeing their backwardness, made so desperate an attack that  the Arabs gave way.  The Felatah horse came on.  Had not Barca Gana and  Boo-Khaloum, with his few mounted Arabs, given them a very spirited  check, not one of their band would have lived to see the following day.  As it was, Barca Gana had three horses hit under him, two of which died  almost immediately, while poor Boo-Khaloum and his horse were both  wounded.  The major's horse was also wounded in the neck, shoulder, and  hind leg, and an arrow struck him in the face, merely drawing blood as  it passed.  He had two sticking in his bournous.  The Arabs suffered  terribly: most of them had two or three wounds; one dropped with five  arrows sticking in his head, and two of Boo-Khaloum's slaves were killed  near him.    No sooner did the Mandara and Bornou troops see the defeat of the Arabs  than they, one and all, took to flight in the most dastardly manner and  the greatest confusion.  The sultan led the way, having been prepared to  take advantage of whatever plunder the success of the Arabs might throw  into his hands; but no less determined to leave the field the moment the  fortune of the day appeared to be against them.    Major Denham had reason to regret his folly in exposing himself, badly  prepared as he was for accident.  By flight only could he save himself.  The whole army, which had now become a flying mass, plunged in the  greatest disorder into the wood which had lately been left.    He had got to the westward of Barca Gana in the confusion, when he saw  upwards of a hundred of the Bornou troops speared by the Felatahs, and  was following the steps of one of the Mandara officers, when the cries  behind, of the Felatah horse pursuing, made both quicken their pace.  His wounded horse at this juncture stumbled and fell.  Almost before he  was on his legs the Felatahs were upon him.  He had, however, kept hold  of the bridle, and, seizing a pistol from the holster, presented it at  two of the savages who were pressing him with their spears.  They  instantly went off; but another, who came on more boldly just as he was  endeavouring to mount, received the contents in his shoulder, and he was  enabled to place his foot in the stirrup.  Remounting, he again  retreated, but had not proceeded many hundred yards when his horse once  more came down, with such violence as to throw him against a tree at a  considerable distance.  At this juncture, alarmed by the horses behind  him, the animal got up and escaped, leaving the major on foot and  unarmed.    The Mandara officer and his followers were butchered and stripped within  a few yards of him.  Their cries were dreadful.  His hopes of life were  too faint to deserve the name.  He was almost instantly surrounded, and  speedily stripped, his pursuers making several thrusts at him with their  spears, wounding his hands severely, and his body slightly.  In the  first instance they had been prevented from murdering him by the fear of  injuring the value of his clothes, which appeared to them a rich booty.  His shirt was now torn off his back.  When his plunderers began to  quarrel for the spoil, the idea of escape came across his mind.  Creeping under the belly of the horse nearest him, he started as fast as  his legs would carry him, to the thickest part of the wood.  Two of the  Felatahs followed.  He ran in the direction the stragglers of his own  party had taken.  His pursuers gained on him, for the prickly underwood  tore his flesh and impeded his progress.  Just then he saw a mountain  stream gliding along at the bottom of a deep ravine.  His strength had  almost failed him, when, seizing the long branches of a tree overhanging  the water, he let himself down into it.  What was his horror to observe  a large liffa, the most venomous of serpents, rise from its coil as if  in the very act of striking!  His senses left him, the branch slipped  from his hand, and he tumbled headlong into the water.  The shock,  however, revived him, and with three strokes of his arms he reached the  opposite bank, which with great difficulty he crawled up.  He, at  length, felt that he was safe from his pursuers.  Still, the forlorn  situation in which he was placed, without even a rag to cover his body,  almost overwhelmed him.  Yet, fully alive to the danger to which he was  exposed, he had began to plan how he could best rest on the top of a  tamarind tree, in order to escape from panthers, when the idea of  liffas, almost as numerous, excited a shudder of despair.  While trying  to make his way through the woods, he observed two horsemen between the  trees, and, still further to the east, with feelings of gratitude, he  recognised Barca Gana and Boo-Khaloum, with about six Arabs.  Although  they were pressed closely by a party of Felatahs, the guns and pistols  of the Arabs kept the latter in check.  His shouts were drowned by the  cries of those who were falling under the Felatahs' spears and the  cheers of the Arabs rallying; but, happily, Maraymy distinguished him at  a distance.  Riding up, the faithful black assisted the major to mount  behind him, and, while the arrows whistled over their heads, they  galloped off to the rear as fast as the black's wounded horse could  carry them.  After they had gone a mile or two, Boo-Khaloum rode up and  desired one of the Arabs to cover the major with a houmous.  This was  the last act of Denham's unfortunate friend.  Directly afterwards  Maraymy exclaimed: \"Look, Boo-Khaloum is dead!\"  The major turned his  head, and saw the caravan leader drop from his horse into the arms of a  favourite Arab.  A poisoned arrow in his wounded foot had proved fatal.  The Arabs believed he had only swooned; but there was no water to revive  him, and before it could be obtained he was past the reach of  stimulants.  At the same time, Barca Gana offered the major a horse; but  Maraymy exclaimed: \"Do not mount him; he will die!\"  He therefore  remained with the black.  Two Arabs, however, mounted the animal, and in  less than an hour he fell to rise no more; and, before they could  recover themselves, both the Arabs were butchered by the Felatahs.    At last a stream was reached.  The horses, with the blood gushing from  their noses, rushed into the water, and the major, letting himself down,  knelt amongst them, and seemed to imbibe new life from the copious  draughts of the muddy beverage he swallowed.  He then lost all  consciousness; but Maraymy told him that he had staggered across the  stream and fallen down at the foot of a tree.  Here a quarter of an  hour's halt was made, to place Boo-Khaloum's body on a horse and to  collect stragglers, during which Maraymy had asked Barca Gana for  another horse, in order to carry the major on, when the chief, irritated  by his defeat, as well as by having had his horse refused, by which  means he said it had come by its death, replied: \"Then leave him behind.  By the head of the Prophet! believers enough have breathed their last  to-day!  What is there extraordinary in a Christian's death?\"  His old  antagonist, Malem Chadily, replied: \"No; God has preserved him, let us  not forsake him.\"  Maraymy returned to the tree, awoke the major, and,  again mounting, they moved on as before, though with less speed.    The effect produced on the horses wounded by arrows was extraordinary;  immediately after drinking they dropped and instantly died, the blood  gushing from their mouths, noses, and ears.  More than thirty horses  were lost at this spot from the effects of the poison.    After riding forty-five miles, it was past midnight before they halted  in the territories of the Sultan of Mandara, the major thoroughly  worn-out.  The bournous thrown over him by the Arab teemed with vermin,  and it was evening the next day before he could get a shirt, when a man  gave him one, on the promise of getting a new one at Kouka."]]]
