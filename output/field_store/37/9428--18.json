It may  be said here that this was precisely the character of the advance on  Kimberley about to be narrated. In such a direct operation, by its  very nature, the defence gains strength and shortens his line of  communications to be defended, while the reverse conditions  unremittingly drain the powers of the assailant.    As an abstract military question there need be no hesitation in saying  that the advance through the Orange Free State was in principle the  correct plan, even under the existing conditions, as far as these are  accurately known. But conditions are never accurately known to  outsiders so immediately after a war. Even the hard bottom facts which  ultimately appear, the residuum left after full publicity, and  discussion, and side lights from all sources have done their work, do  not correctly reproduce the circumstances as present to the mind of  the general officer who decides. What is known now was doubtful then;  what now is past and certain, was then future and contingent; what  this and that subordinate, this force and that force could {p.135}  endure and would endure we now know, but who could surely tell six  months ago? Who, whatever his faith in the heroism and patience of the  garrisons, believed in December, 1899, that Ladysmith and Kimberley  and Mafeking could hold out, without relief, as long as they did? What  therefore, between the known uncertainties of the past and the  certainly imperfect information of the present, we, who had not the  responsibilities of decision, may modestly refrain from positively  judging the particular decision, even by the generally sound  principles which commonly govern such cases. Warfare is an art, not a  science; it knows no unvarying laws, and possesses neither specifics  nor panaceas.    Whatever the reason, the decision was reached to attempt  simultaneously the relief of Kimberley and of Ladysmith. It is with  the former, which also was first in order of time, that we now have  immediately to do. This advance had begun, had reached its furthest  limit, had been brought to a standstill, and so had failed, before the  clash of arms at Colenso, on December 15, signalized the opening of  the campaign for the relief of Ladysmith. {p.136} This priority was  naturally to be expected; for not only was Cape Town the first port of  arrival from England, but the much larger number of the besiegers at  Ladysmith made a much longer time necessary to accumulate the force  adequate to contend successfully against them. The details of the  assembling of Methuen's division at Orange River Station need not  detain us. The 2,500 men there in the first week of November had been  increased by November 19 to nearly 10,000, and began to advance on the  21st. It will be well, however, to say a word about their objective,  Kimberley, its conditions, its defences, and its defenders, as well as  about the country through which runs the railroad that marks the  general line of Methuen's proposed operation.    Lieutenant-Colonel Kekewich, who had been ordered to command the  forces in Kimberley, had arrived there on the 13th of September.  Already portions of the Transvaal levies were out, \"on commando,\" as  the Boer phrase is, moving on the Free State side of the boundary  line; and many reasonably authenticated rumours were heard of  intentions {p.137} to destroy the railroad bridges--notably over the  Modder and Orange Rivers--south of the place, as well as others north  of it. The guard of the road generally was then in charge of a mounted  body called the Cape Police, detachments of which watched the bridges.  Political and other considerations prevented immediate steps from  being taken to fortify the town, but plans were matured, and  information concerning the surrounding country had already been  procured by subordinate officers, whose arrival had preceded that of  Kekewich. On the 18th of September, construction of defence works  began, reports of movements by the burghers of the Free State as well  as by Transvaalers being received, and arousing apprehension of a  sudden attack. On the 27th of September, an officer of the garrison,  by personal observation at Boshof in the Free State, ascertained that  the burghers of the latter had been ordered out. The works were then  pressed forward, and the formation of citizens into town guards  already planned, was begun; 1,156 combatant members being enrolled,  and placed under drill by non-commissioned officers of {p.138} the  regular battalion in garrison. The Boer forces continued to approach  Kimberley, and on October 4, a week before war began, advanced bodies  were within twelve miles. By October 7 the earthworks were so far  forward that Kekewich considered the place practically safe against  any attempt on the part of the enemy to rush it suddenly.    When the ultimatum expired, October 11, the garrison proper consisted  of 570 Imperial and 630 colonial troops, for the defence of an  unwalled town which contained 40,000 inhabitants and, being built in  rambling fashion, had a very long circuit--about eleven miles--to be  guarded. The ready co-operation of the citizens in military duty, both  those already belonging to volunteer bodies and those not previously  organised, but now enrolling themselves for the purpose, alone made  the defence possible. From them, particularly, was formed a corps of  irregular horse, which filled the want of mounted troops that at first  was severely felt. Colonel Kekewich, recognising the enemy's  overpowering superiority of numbers, rapidly drew {p.139} into  Kimberley all the outlying forces of every character under his  command.    Although deeply concerned for the safety of the Modder River bridge,  upon which in a measure would depend the advance of a relief column,  \"I was most anxious,\" he says, \"that no disposition of troops made by  me should give the enemy a chance of scoring a first success, even  where the smallest body of British troops might be concerned. Taking  into consideration that the enemy would probably not regulate his  movements in accordance with the dictates of sound strategy, that he  was in possession of mobile artillery in my immediate neighbourhood, I  felt that if I had detached a small body of troops, necessarily  without artillery, which it was not in my power to support from  Kimberley, the enemy would in all probability concentrate very  superior numbers, with artillery, against the small British post, and  endeavour to destroy the troops composing the same. It was principally  for this reason that I determined to concentrate all my available  forces, including the Cape Police, at the point of greatest importance  in my command--Kimberley.\"    The {p.140} inference of Colonel Kekewich as to the Boers' strategy  was as accurate as his general action was militarily judicious. The  concentration and development of his resources not merely deterred the  enemy from assault, but detained them there in force, to the neglect  of matters elsewhere much more urgently worthy of their efforts. The  gain of Kimberley, had they gained it, would have been poor  compensation for the daily increasing solidity of the still weak  British grasp on the central positions outlined by De Aar, Orange  River and Naauwport. This absorption of the Boers' attention by  Kimberley was maintained by frequent sorties of the garrison, in every  direction, which at an early period of the siege became possible  through the ready facility with which the citizens were converted into  irregular mounted troops. \"It will be observed,\" wrote Kekewich, \"that  portions of the mounted corps were employed on every occasion\" of the  continued sallies in greater or less force, especially at the period  of Methuen's advance.    At the same time the enemy was preparing to bombard, and was busily  engaged in {p.141} taking possession, by small bodies of from 100 to  250 men, of the undefended towns and villages in Griqualand West--the  thinly peopled district to the west of Kimberley. This pleasant but  useless pastime occupied them agreeably, and diverted them from  molesting the British at Orange River and De Aar.    \"My general plan for the defence of Kimberley,\" says Kekewich in his  report, \"was based on the principle of always keeping the enemy on the  move, and constantly in fear of an attack from an unexpected quarter.  Later, when the advance of the relief column from the Orange River  commenced, and I was put in possession of information concerning the  probable date of its arrival in Kimberley, I adopted such measures as  I hoped would cause the retention of a large force of the enemy in my  immediate neighbourhood, and thus enable the relief column to deal  with the Boer force in detail. It was with these objects that the  numerous sorties and demonstrations in force were made by portions of  the garrison of Kimberley.\"    Such {p.142} continual offensive action is of the essence of dexterous  defence, especially when designed in support of movements elsewhere  occurring. It is not surprising, therefore, that Lord Roberts, in  forwarding Kekewich's report, comments that \"the greatest credit is  due him for his able dispositions, for his rapid organisation of an  auxiliary force, and for the tact, judgment, and resolution which he  displayed throughout the siege.\" This admirable service was performed  at a loss of 38 killed and 133 wounded, of all the troops employed  from the beginning of the investment to the day of relief.    Orange River, where Methuen's relief force was assembling, is seventy  miles from Kimberley. The country between is part of the great inland  plateau, in general contour rolling, but with frequent stony hills,  which locally have the name of"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/2099"],[0,"A History of the Moravian Church (#16)"],[1,"to see the great Protestant leaders. At  Wittenberg, Augusta discussed good morals with Luther and Melancthon;  and at Strasburg, Cerwenka, the Brethren's historian, held friendly  counsel with Martin Bucer and Calvin. Never had the Brethren been so  widely known, and never had they received so many compliments. Formerly  Luther, who liked plain speech, had called the Brethren \"sour-looking  hypocrites and self-grown saints, who believe in nothing but what they  themselves teach.\" But now he was all good humour. \"There never have  been any Christians,\" he said, in a lecture to his students, \"so like  the apostles in doctrine and constitution as these Bohemian Brethren.\"    \"Tell your Brethren,\" he said to their deputies, \"to hold fast what God  has given them, and never give up their constitution and discipline. Let  them take no heed of revilements. The world will behave foolishly. If  you in Bohemia were to live as we do, what is said of us would be said  of you, and if we were to live as you do, what is said of you would be  said of us.\" \"We have never,\" he added, in a letter to the Brethren,  \"attained to such a discipline and holy life as is found among you, but  in the future we shall make it our aim to attain it.\"    The other great Reformers were just as enthusiastic. \"How shall I,\" said  Bucer, \"instruct those whom God Himself has instructed! You alone, in  all the world, combine a wholesome discipline with a pure faith.\" \"We,\"  said Calvin, \"have long since recognised the value of such a system,  but cannot, in any way, attain to it.\" \"I am pleased,\" said Melancthon,  \"with the strict discipline enforced in your congregations. I wish we  could have a stricter discipline in ours.\" It is clear what all this  means. It means that the Brethren, in their humble way, had taught the  famous Protestant leaders the value of a system of Church discipline and  the need of good works as the proper fruit of faith.    Meanwhile Augusta pushed his second plan. The task before him was  gigantic. A great event had taken place in Bohemia. At the battle of  Mohacz, in a war with the Turks, Louis, King of Bohemia, fell from his  horse when crossing a stream, and was drowned {1526.}. The old line of  Bohemian Kings had come to an end. The crown fell into the hands of the  Hapsburgs; the Hapsburgs were the mightiest supporters of the Church  of Rome; and the King of Bohemia, Ferdinand I., was likewise King of  Hungary, Archduke of Austria, King of the Romans, and brother of the  Emperor Charles V., the head of the Holy Roman Empire.    For the Brethren the situation was momentous. As Augusta scanned the  widening view, he saw that the time was coming fast when the Brethren,  whether they would or no, would be called to play their part like men in  a vast European conflict. Already the Emperor Charles V. had threatened  to crush the Reformation by force; already (1530) the Protestant princes  in Germany had formed the Smalkald League; and Augusta, scenting the  battle from afar, resolved to build a fortress for the Brethren. His  policy was clear and simple. If the King of Bohemia joined forces with  the Emperor, the days of the Brethren's Church would soon be over. He  would make the King of Bohemia their friend, and thus save the Brethren  from the horrors of war. For this purpose Augusta now instructed the  powerful Baron, Conrad Krajek, the richest member of the Brethren's  Church, to present the Brethren's Confession of Faith to King Ferdinand.  The Baron undertook the task. He was the leader of a group of Barons  who had recently joined the Church; he had built the great Zbor of the  Brethren in Jungbunzlau, known as \"Mount Carmel\"; he had been the first  to suggest a Confession of Faith, and now, having signed the Confession  himself, he sought out the King at Vienna, and was admitted to a private  interview {Nov. 11th, 1535.}. The scene was stormy. \"We would like to  know,\" said the King, \"how you Brethren came to adopt this faith. The  devil has persuaded you.\"    \"Not the devil, gracious liege,\" replied the Baron, \"but Christ the Lord  through the Holy Scriptures. If Christ was a Picard, then I am one too.\"    The King was beside himself with rage.    \"What business,\" he shouted, \"have you to meddle with such things? You  are neither Pope, nor Emperor, nor King. Believe what you will! We shall  not prevent you! If you really want to go to hell, go by all means!\"    The Baron was silent. The King paused.    \"Yes, yes,\" he continued, \"you may believe what you like and we shall  not prevent you; but all the same, I give you warning that we shall put  a stop to your meetings, where you carry on your hocus-pocus.\"    The Baron was almost weeping.    \"Your Majesty,\" he protested, \"should not be so hard on me and my noble  friends. We are the most loyal subjects in your kingdom.\"    The King softened, spoke more gently, but still held to his point.    \"I swore,\" he said, \"at my coronation to give justice to the Utraquists  and Catholics, and I know what the statute says.\"    As the King spoke those ominous words, he was referring, as the Baron  knew full well, to the terrible Edict of St. James. The interview ended;  the Baron withdrew; the issue still hung doubtful.    And yet the Baron had not spoken in vain. For three days the King was  left undisturbed; and then two other Barons appeared and presented the  Confession, signed by twelve nobles and thirty-three knights, in due  form {Nov. 14th}.    \"Do you really think,\" they humbly said, \"that it helps the unity of the  kingdom when priests are allowed to say in the pulpit that it is less  sinful to kill a Picard than it is to kill a dog.\"    The King was touched; his anger was gone, and a week later he promised  the Barons that as long as the Brethren were loyal subjects he would  allow them to worship as they pleased. For some years the new policy  worked very well, and the King kept his promise. The Brethren were  extending on every hand. They had now at least four hundred churches and  two hundred thousand members. They printed and published translations  of Luther's works. They had a church in the city of Prague itself. They  enjoyed the favour of the leading nobles in the land; and Augusta, in a  famous sermon, expressed the hope that before very long the Brethren and  Utraquists would be united and form one National Protestant Church.[36]  At this point a beautiful incident occurred. As the Brethren were now so  friendly with Luther, there was a danger that they would abandon their  discipline, become ashamed of their own little Church, and try to  imitate the teaching and practice of their powerful Protestant friends.  For some years after Luke's death they actually gave way to this  temptation, and Luke's last treatise, \"Regulations for Priests,\" was  scornfully cast aside. But the Brethren soon returned to their senses.  As John Augusta and John Horn travelled in Germany, they made the  strange and startling discovery that, after all, the Brethren's Church  was the best Church they knew. For a while they were dazzled by the  brilliance of the Lutheran preachers; but in the end they came to the  conclusion that though these preachers were clever men they had not  so firm a grip on Divine truth as the Brethren. At last, in 1546, the  Brethren met in a Synod at Jungbunzlau to discuss the whole situation.  With tears in his eyes John Horn addressed the assembly. \"I have never  understood till now,\" he said, \"what a costly treasure our Church is. I  have been blinded by the reading of German books! I have never found any  thing so good in those books as we have in the books of the Brethren.  You have no need, beloved Brethren, to seek for instruction from others.  You have enough at home. I exhort you to study what you have already;  you will find there all you need.\" Again the discipline was revived in  all its vigour; again, by Augusta's advice, the Catechism of Luke was  put into common use, and the Brethren began to open schools and teach  their principles to others.    But now their fondest hopes were doomed to be blasted. For the last  time Augusta went to Wittenberg to discuss the value of discipline with  Luther, and as his stay drew to a close he warned the great man that if  the German theologians spent so much time in spinning doctrines and  so little time in teaching morals, there was danger brewing ahead.  The warning soon came true. The Reformer died. The gathering clouds in  Germany burst, and the Smalkald War broke out. The storm swept on to  Bohemia. As the Emperor gathered his forces in Germany to crush the  Protestant Princes to powder, so Ferdinand in Bohemia summoned his  subjects to rally round his standard at Leitmeritz and defend the  kingdom and the throne against the Protestant rebels. For the first time  in their history the Bohemian Brethren were ordered to take sides in a  civil war. The situation was delicate. If they fought for Ferdinand they  would be untrue to their faith; if they fought against him they would be  disloyal to their country. In this dilemma they did the best they could.    As soon as they could possibly do so, the Elders issued a form of prayer  to be used in all their churches. It was a prayer for the kingdom  and the throne.[37] But meanwhile others were taking definite sides. At  Leitmeritz the Catholics and old-fashioned Utraquists mustered to fight  for the King; and at Prague the Protestant nobles met to defend the  cause of religious liberty. They met in secret at a Brother's House;  they formed a Committee of Safety of eight, and of those eight four were  Brethren; and they passed a resolution to defy the King, and send help  to the German Protestant leader, John Frederick, Elector of Saxony.    And then the retribution fell like a bolt from the blue. The great  battle of Muehlberg was fought {April 24th, 1547.}; the Protestant troops  were routed; the Elector of Saxony was captured; the Emperor"]]]
