No sooner did Evenos realise that his daughter was gone,  than, in furious anger against her and her lover, he gave chase. One  has watched a hawk in pursuit of a pigeon or a bird of the moors and  seen it, a little dark speck at first, gradually growing larger and  more large until at length it dominated and conquered its prey,  swooping down from above, like an arrow from a bow, to bring with it  sudden death.    So at first it seemed that Evenos must conquer Idas and Marpessa in  the winged chariot of Neptune's lending. But onwards Idas drove the  chariot, ever faster and faster, until before the eyes of Marpessa the  trees of the forest grew into blurs of blue and brown, and the streams  and rivers as they flew past them were streaks of silver. Not until he  had reached the river Lycormas did the angry father own that his  pursuit had been in vain. Over the swift-flowing stream flew the  chariot driven by Idas, but Evenos knew that his horses, flecked with  white foam, pumping each breath from hearts that were strained to  breaking-point, no longer could go on with the chase. The passage of  that deep stream would destroy them. The fierce water would sweep the  wearied beasts down in its impelling current, and he with them. A  shamed man would he be forever. Not for a moment did he hesitate, but  drew his sharp sword from his belt and plunged it into the breast of  one steed and then of the other who had been so willing and who yet  had failed him in the end. And then, as they, still in their traces,  neighed shrilly aloud, and then fell over and died where they lay,  Evenos, with a great cry, leaped into the river. Over his head closed  the eddies of the peat-brown water. Once only did he throw up his arms  to ask the gods for mercy; then did his body drift down with the  stream, and his soul hastened downwards to the Shades. And from that  day the river Lycormas no more was known by that name, but was called  the river _Evenos_ forever.    Onwards, triumphantly, drove Idas, but soon he knew that a greater  than Evenos had entered in the chase, and that the jealous sun-god's  chariot was in pursuit of the winged car of Neptune. Quickly it gained  on him--soon it would have swept down on him--a hawk indeed, this  time, striking surely its helpless prey--but even as Apollo saw the  white face of Marpessa and knew that he was the victor, a mighty  thunderbolt that made the mountains shake, and rolled its echoes  through the lonely fastnesses of a thousand hills, was sent to earth  by Jupiter. While the echoes still re-echoed, there came from Olympus  the voice of Zeus himself.    \"_Let her decide!_\" he said.    Apollo, like a white flame blown backward by the wind, withheld his  hands that would have seized from Idas the woman who was his heart's  desire.    And then he spoke, and while his burning gaze was fixed upon her, and  his face, in beautiful fury, was more perfect than any exquisite  picture of her dreams, his voice was as the voice of the sea as it  calls to the shore in the moonlit hours, as the bird that sings in the  darkness of a tropic night to its longing mate.    \"Marpessa!\" he cried, \"Marpessa! wilt thou not come to me? No woe nor  trouble, never any pain can touch me. Yet woe indeed was mine when  first I saw thy fairest face. For even now dost thou hasten to sorrow,  to darkness, to the dark-shadowed tomb. Thou art but mortal! thy  beauty is short-lived. Thy love for mortal man shall quickly fade and  die. Come to me, Marpessa, and my kisses on your lips shall make thee  immortal! Together we shall bring the sunbeams to a cold, dark land!  Together shall we coax the spring flowers from the still, dead earth!  Together we shall bring to men the golden harvest, and deck the trees  of autumn in our liveries of red and gold. I love thee, Marpessa--not  as mere mortal loves do I love thee. Come to me, Marpessa--my Love--my  Desire!\"    When his voice was silent, it seemed as if the very earth itself with  all its thousand echoes still breathed his words: \"Marpessa--my  Love--my Desire.\"    Abashed before the god's entreaties stood Idas. And the heart of  Marpessa was torn as she heard the burning words of the beautiful  Apollo still ringing through her head, and saw her mortal lover,  silent, white-lipped, gazing first at the god and then into her own  pale face. At length he spoke:        \"After such argument what can I plead?      Or what pale promise make? Yet since it is      In woman to pity rather than to aspire,      A little I will speak. I love thee then      Not only for thy body packed with sweet      Of all this world, that cup of brimming June,      That jar of violet wine set in the air,      That palest rose sweet in the night of life;      Nor for that stirring bosom all besieged      By drowsing lovers, or thy perilous hair;      Nor for that face that might indeed provoke      Invasion of old cities; no, nor all      Thy freshness stealing on me like strange sleep.      Nor for this only do I love thee, but      Because Infinity upon thee broods;      And thou art full of whispers and of shadows.      Thou meanest what the sea has striven to say      So long, and yearned up the cliffs to tell;      Thou art what all the winds have uttered not,      What the still night suggesteth to the heart.      Thy voice is like to music heard ere birth,      Some spirit lute touched on a spirit sea;      Thy face remembered is from other worlds,      It has been died for, though I know not when,      It has been sung of, though I know not where.      It has the strangeness of the luring West,      And of sad sea-horizons; beside thee      I am aware of other times and lands,      Of birth far-back, of lives in many stars.      O beauty lone and like a candle clear      In this dark country of the world! Thou art      My woe, my early light, my music dying.\"            Stephen Phillips.    Then Idas, in the humility that comes from perfect love, drooped low  his head, and was silent. In silence for a minute stood the three--a  god, a man, and a woman. And from on high the watching stars looked  down and marvelled, and Diana stayed for a moment the course of her  silver car to watch, as she thought, the triumph of her own invincible  brother.    From man to god passed the eyes of Marpessa, and back from god to man.  And the stars forgot to twinkle, and Diana's silver-maned horses pawed  the blue floor of the sky, impatient at the firm hand of the mistress  on the reins that checked their eager course.    Marpessa spoke at last, in low words that seemed to come \"remembered  from other worlds.\"    For all the joys he offered her she thanked Apollo. What grander fate  for mortal woman than to rule the sunbeams--to bring bliss to the  earth and to the sons of men? What more could mortal woman crave than  the gift of immortality shared with one whose power ruled the vast  universe, and who still had stooped to lay the red roses of his  passionate love at her little, human feet? And yet--and yet--in that  sorrow-free existence that he promised, might there not still be  something awanting to one who had once known tears?        \"Yet I, being human, human sorrow miss.\"    Then were he indeed to give her the gift of immortal life, what value  were life to one whose beauty had withered as the leaves in autumn,  whose heart was tired and dead? What uglier fate than this, to endure  an endless existence in which no life was, yoked to one whose youth  was immortal, whose beauty was everlasting?    Then did she turn to Idas, who stood as one who awaits the judgment of  the judge in whose hands lies the power of meting out life or death.  Thus she spoke:        \"But if I live with Idas, then we two      On the low earth shall prosper hand in hand      In odours of the open field, and live      In peaceful noises of the farm, and watch      The pastoral fields burned by the setting sun.      And he shall give me passionate children, not      Some radiant god that will despise me quite,      But clambering limbs and little hearts that err.      ... So shall we live,      And though the first sweet sting of love be past,      The sweet that almost venom is; though youth,      With tender and extravagant delight,      The first and secret kiss by twilight hedge,      The insane farewell repeated o'er and o'er,      Pass off; there shall succeed a faithful peace;      Beautiful friendship tried by sun and wind,      Durable from the daily dust of life.\"    The sun-god frowned as her words fell from her lips. Even now, as she  looked at him, he held out his arms. Surely she only played with this  poor mortal youth. To him she must come, this rose who could own no  lesser god than the sun-god himself.    But Marpessa spoke on:        \"And thou beautiful god, in that far time,      When in thy setting sweet thou gazest down      On his grey head, wilt thou remember then      That once I pleased thee, that I once was young?\"    So did her voice cease, and on the earth fell sudden darkness. For to  Apollo had come the shame of love rejected, and there were those who  said that to the earth that night there came no sunset, only the  sullen darkness that told of the flight of an angry god. Yet, later,  the silver moonbeams of Diana seemed to greet the dark earth with a  smile, and, in the winged car of Neptune, Idas and Marpessa sped on,  greater than the gods, in a perfect harmony of human love that feared  nor time, nor pain, nor Death himself.          ARETHUSA      \"We have victualled and watered,\" wrote Nelson from Syracuse in 1798,  \"and surely, watering at the fountain of Arethusa, we must have  victory. We shall sail with the first breeze; and be assured I will  return either crowned with laurel or covered with cypress.\" Three days  later, he won the Battle of the Nile, one of the greatest sea-fights  of history.

Lady R.'s desire for this bracelet, and its disappointment, were no  secret to Madame de N.; and on learning, from the gossiping confidant,  the response made by her rival to her complaint, a sudden thought darted  through her mind. \"_Chere amie_,\" said she to the confidant, \"I beg you  to say to her ladyship, that, since such is her opinion, I hold her to  the acceptance of the consequences of her maxim.\"    The confidant lost no time in delivering this message, to which Lady R.,  thinking only of her host of admirers, laughingly replied, that Madame  de N. was quite at liberty to make any practical application of the  principle that she pleased.    Within two hours from the reception of this challenge, the beautiful  bracelet, inclosed in an elegant case, on whose lid the initials of Lady  R., surrounded by her crest, were engraved in letters of gold, had  passed from the jeweller's show-rooms to the boudoir of Madame de N.,  who thenceforth, by means of an espionage that followed every movement  of her rival, kept her constantly in view. At length the tournament, to  be followed by the balloon-ascension (held a week or two ago in the  Champ de Mars), was announced to the great delight of the  spectacle-loving public; and having learned that the fair Englishwoman  was to be present in an open carriage, Madame de N. determined to avail  herself of this occasion to execute her scheme.    Accordingly on the appointed day, the bracelet, in its elegant case,  being placed in the carriage beside her, and the coachman duly  instructed in the part he was to play, Madame de N., holding in her hand  her _bonbonniere_, supplied with fresh crumbs of the most delicate  _brioche_, followed, at short distance, the carriage of her rival to the  Champ de Mars, and took her stand just in the rear of her ladyship's  phaeton.    Lady R. was in excellent spirits, receiving the homage of a crowd of  attendant cavaliers; Sylphide, to the unspeakable joy of Madame de N.,  being seated on the front seat nearest her carriage.    Madame de N. waited patiently through the various evolutions of the  gorgeous scene; and, at its close, when the great balloon of M. Poitevin  rose majestically from the field, surrounded by its graceful band of  nymphs that seemed to float, self-sustained, in the air, their silver  wands and wreaths of flowers shining in the light of the setting sun,  when all eyes followed the aeronauts, and deafening acclamations rent  the air, in less time than we take in recounting the movement, the  carriage of Madame de N. advanced to the side of Lady R.'s; Sylphide,  attracted by the well-known _bonbonniere_, leapt lightly into the  outstretched arms of her friend; and Madame de N. depositing the morocco  case on the very spot Sylphide had quitted, bowed gracefully to her  rival, and drove rapidly away, before Lady R. had had time to comprehend  what was passing.    Great was her ladyship's amazement, as may well be supposed; and great,  for the first few moments, was also her indignation; but the mystery was  soon explained; for, in opening the case, which occupied Sylphide's  vacant place, and which was unmistakably intended for her, she perceived  the rich bracelet she had so much wished for, and beside it, the card of  Madame de N., on which was written, in pencil, these words, which  contained the key of the enigma, \"_Exchange is no robbery_.\"    A hearty laugh, which she tried in vain to repress, broke from the lips  of the fair lady; much to the astonishment of the gentlemen who had  witnessed the scene, and to whom, notwithstanding their eager inquiries,  Lady R. very naturally declined giving any explanation of the affair.    I shall observe your instructions, to keep you advised of whatever  occurs here in the middle of the world.        STELLA.          _Authors and Books_.      The German book trade has, for some months, been fairly overwhelmed with  books upon Hungary. We notice among the latest, \"Flowers from Hungarian  Battlefields,\" a collection of novelettes, with scenes drawn from real  life in the late war, by Sajo, one of the most popular writers of  Hungary. The stories are spirited and vivid. \"Confessions of a  Civilian,\" and \"Confessions of a Soldier,\" are two books, of which the  last named has been for some time before the public, and has excited  attention by the thoroughness of its absolutist tendencies. The Civilian  is the opposite of the Soldier, being a liberal of the first stamp. Both  these writers, however, oppose the present Austrian ministry. A German  translation of Horwath's \"History of the Hungarians\" is coming out at  Pesth in numbers, and is welcomed by the German critics. This is  regarded by the most competent judges as an excellent work. \"Janos the  Hero,\" a Romance of Hungarian Peasant Life, by Alexander Petoefy, one of  the most popular Magyar writers, is spoken of as a most successful  delineation of national peculiarities. \"The Revolution and the Jews in  Hungary,\" is an interesting chapter out of the history of the Hungarian  Jews, by J. Eichorn. The fidelity of the Hebrews to the cause  represented by Kossuth and his associates, and defended by the entire  nation, is as well known as the extortions with which the butcher Haynau  attempted to punish their patriotism. _Rerum Hungaricum Monumenta_ is  the last work of the lamented antiquarian Eudlicher, and is designed to  open to the literary world the authentic sources of early Hungarian  history. It is, in short, a most valuable collection of ancient  documents relating to the origin of the Magyars, their first settlement  in Hungary, and their history under the native princes of the race of  Arpad. One of the best results of this work will be the provocation of  other savans to similar investigations, which cannot fail to throw light  on many obscure historical questions.           *       *       *       *       *    A very interesting work has just made its appearance at Leipsic, giving  an intimate though by no means flattering account of the condition of  the POLISH POPULATION IN GALLICIA. The peculiarities of this race of  people are described as wild barbarism combined with elegant politeness,  dreamy melancholy, and practical cunning. The author was in Gallicia  before the peasants' insurrection in 1846. He narrates a variety of the  most striking scenes, which though highly colored are apparently true in  the main. Among other things he gives an account of a dinner-party to  which he was invited, at the house of a nobleman. The house stood in the  midst of a scattered mass of outbuildings, none of which bore the  slightest appearance of neatness, order, or comfort. Every thing, in  fact, has the appearance of neglect and decay. Many of the walls are  supported by props to prevent them from tumbling. Around the doors the  slightest rain produces a disgusting morass, while the general aspect of  the whole reminds the beholder of Attila's wooden palace in Pannonia,  where he heaped up the booty of a world, and received the ambassadors of  Rome. When the writer reached the door, he found his host with some  other gentlemen waiting to receive him. The company was numerous, and  all, especially the ladies, expensively dressed, in the last Parisian  fashion, with abundant jewelry and ornaments. The saloon in which they  were received was large but low, the walls covered with dirty paper, the  floor of rough boards, the furniture of all sorts and sizes, and nowhere  a trace of art or refined taste. The conversation was carried on in  French, and the ladies exhibited a thorough acquaintance with Paris  matters, notabilities, and gossip generally. At the table the drinking  was almost incredible, and the topic of conversation, the emancipation  of Poland. Every word was aimed at the conversion of the German guest.  The hard treatment of the serfs was spoken of as necessary, as they must  be kept in complete subjection in order to be made useful in the great  work. The festivity grew more and more ardent, till at last one of the  gentlemen took a shoe off from a lady's foot, filled it with wine, and  after drinking from it himself, passed it to the others, so that all  could pledge the ladies from such a cup. The next morning the stranger  saw by chance a sight of another kind, as he was taking a walk. Behind a  wall a man lay on the earth; another held fast his head, and a third his  feet, while a fourth stood over him with a whip, laying on with all his  might. The lord stood by in his dressing-gown, smoking a long pipe, and  coolly directing the procedure. The guest turned away from the  spectacle, but was told by his servant that this was the tenth man who  had undergone the same punishment that morning. The offence was, that  they had not begun work at sunrise. Of course a peasantry so treated  could have no affection for their masters. All the work was done in the  worst manner, while the lord was plundered in every way by his servants.  Of the supplies for the family, more than half were regularly stolen,  there being no supervision in the household. The extravagance of the  masters was boundless, and when they got out of money they resorted to  the Jews, who had the whole commerce of the country in their hands,  besides having mortgages on most of the estates.    This is the merest outline of a small portion of the book. It renders  more intelligible the atrocities which took place in the insurrection of  1846, and which the Austrian Government permitted, if they did not  foment.           *       *       *       *       *    One of the most remarkable philologists and travellers of the present  day is the Hungarian Professor REGULY, a man as yet little known out of  his own country and northern Europe. He has devoted himself a good deal  to the exposition of the affinities between the Magyar and the Finnish  languages, and his labors have "]]]
