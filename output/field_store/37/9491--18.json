The occasion was seized for a ballot. The senate  was a tie, but the Governor threw the casting vote for a convention.  This was called as soon as possible, and on May 29, 1790, Rhode Island,  too, at the eleventh hour, made the National Constitution her own. Not  only had a MORE PERFECT UNION been formed at last, but it included all  the Old Thirteen States.        PART SECOND    THE UNITED STATES UNDER THE CONSTITUTION    PERIOD I.    THE UNITED STATES AND THE FRENCH REVOLUTION    1789-1814    CHAPTER I.    THE NEW GOVERNMENT    Notified on July 2, 1788, that nine States had voted approval of the  Constitution, Congress, on September 13th, set the first Wednesday in  January, 1789, for the choice of electors, the first in February for  their ballot, and the first in March for putting the new government in  motion. The first Wednesday in March, 1789, happening to fall on the  4th, this date has since remained as the initial one for presidencies  and congresses. The First Congress had no quorum in either branch on  March 4th, and did not complete its organization till April 6th.  Washington was inaugurated on April 30th, in New York, where the First  Congress, proceeding to execute the Constitution, held its entire first  session. Its second session was in Philadelphia, the seat of Congress  thence till the second session of the VIth Congress, 1800, since which  time Congress has always met in Washington.    The inauguration of our first President was an imposing event. As the  hero moved from his house on Franklin Square, through Pearl Street to  Broad, and through Broad to Federal Hall, corner of Wall Street, people  thronged every sidewalk, door-way, window, and roof along the entire  line of march. About him on the platform after his arrival stood John  Adams, Alexander Hamilton, Baron Steuben, Generals St. Clair and Knox,  Roger Sherman, and Chancellor Livingston. Washington advanced to the  rail, placed his hand upon his breast, and, bowing low, said audibly, as  the Chancellor in his robes solemnly recited the words, \"I swear, so  help me God,\" reverently kissing the Bible as if to add solemnity to his  oath. \"It is done,\" cried the Chancellor; \"long live George Washington,  President of the United States!\" The great crowd repeated the cry. It  was echoed outside in the city, off into the country, far north, far  south, till the entire land took up that watchword, which his own  generation has passed on to ours and to all that shall come, Long live  George Washington!    Let us study for a moment the habitat of the people over which the new  Chief Magistrate was called to bear sway. By the census of 1790, the  population of the thirteen States and of the territory belonging to the  Union numbered 3,929,214. It resided almost wholly on the Atlantic coast  from Maine to Florida. Not more than five per cent of it was west of the  mountains. The line of inner settlement, now farther, now nearer, ran at  an average distance from the coast of two hundred and fifty-five miles.  The coast land of Massachusetts, southern New England, and New York was  the most densely covered. The Hudson Valley was well peopled as far as  Albany. Farms and hamlets were to be met all the way from New York  across New Jersey to the Delaware, and far up the Delaware Valley  westward from that river. Maine, still belonging to Massachusetts, had  few settlements except upon her coast and a little way inland along her  great rivers. Vermont, not yet a State and claimed by both New Hampshire  and New York, was well filled up, as was all New Hampshire but the  extreme north.    The westward movement of population took mainly four routes, the Mohawk  and Ontario, the Upper Potomac, the Southwestern Virginia, and the  Western Georgia. The Mohawk Valley was settled, and pioneers had taken  up much land on Lake Ontario and near the rivers and lakes tributary to  it. Elmira and Binghamton had been begun. Pennsylvania settlers had  pressed westward more or less thickly to the lower elevations of the  Alleghanies, while beyond, in the Pittsburgh regions, they were even  more numerous. What is now West Virginia had squatters here and there.  Virginian pioneers had also betaken themselves southwestward to the head  of the Tennessee. North and South Carolina were inhabited as far west as  the mountains, though the population was not dense. In Northern  Kentucky, along the Ohio, lay considerable settlements, and in  Tennessee, where Nashville now is, there was another centre of  civilization. In the Northwest Territory, Detroit, Vincennes, Kaskaskia,  Prairie du Chien, Mackinac, and Green River were outposts, at each of  which a few white men might have been found.    The following table shows pretty nearly the population of the several  States about the  end of the Revolution:  New Hampshire            102,000  Massachusetts            330,000  Rhode Island [1783]       51,869   [2,342 of them negroes,                                        464 mulattoes, 525 Indians.]  Connecticut [1782]       208,870  New York [1786]          215,283  New Jersey[1785]         138,934   [10,500 of them negroes.]  Pennsylvania             330,000  Delaware                  37,000  Maryland                 250,000   [80,000 of them negroes.]  Virginia                 532,000  [280,000 of them negroes.]  North Carolina           224,000   [60,000 of them negroes.]  South Carolina           188,000   [80,000 of them negroes.]  Georgia [rough estimate]  80,000   [20,000 of them negroes.]    Another table exhibits approximately the number of houses in the  principal cities of the country in 1785-86. It was customary then in  estimating population to allow seven persons to each house. This  multiplier is probably too large rather than too small.

It had eight hundred  and forty-six names, not going above Roosevelt and Cherry Streets on  the East side, or Dey Street on the West. There were then in the city  three Dutch Reformed churches, four Presbyterian, three Episcopal, two  German Lutheran, and one congregation each belonging to the Catholics,  Friends, Baptists, Moravians, and Jews. In 1789 the Methodists had two  churches, and the Friends two new Meetings. The houses in the city were  generally of brick, with tile roofs, mostly English in style, but a few  Dutch. The old Fort, where the provincial governors had resided, still  stood in the Battery. The City Hall was a brick structure, three stories  high, with wings, fronting on Broad Street. Want of good water greatly  inconvenienced the citizens, as there was no aqueduct yet, and wells  were few. Most houses supplied themselves by casks from a pump on what  is now Pearl Street, this being replenished from a pond a mile north of  the then city limits. New York commanded the trade of nearly all  Connecticut, half New Jersey, and all Western Massachusetts, besides  that of New York State itself. In short it did the importing for  one-sixth of the population of the Union. Pennsylvania and Maryland made  the best flour. In the manufacture of iron, paper, and cabinet ware,  Pennsylvania led all the States.    Over this rapidly growing portion of the human race in its widely  separated homes there was at last a central government worthy the name.  The old Articles of Confederation had been no fundamental law, not a  foundation but a homely botch-work of superstructure, resembling more a  treaty between several States than a ground-law for one. In the new  Constitution a genuine foundation was laid, the Government now holding  direct and immediate relations with each subject of every State, and  citizens of States being at the same time citizens of the United States.  Hitherto the central power could act on individuals only through States.  Now, by its own marshals, aided if need were by its army, it could  itself arrest and by its own  courts try and condemn any transgressor of  its laws.    But if the State relinquished the technical sovereignty which it had  before, it did not sink to the level of an administrative division, but  increased rather in all the elements of real dignity and stability. Over  certain subjects the new constitution gave the States supreme, absolute,  and uncontrollable power. The range of this supreme state prerogative  is, in fact, wider on the whole than that of national. For national  action there must be demonstrable constitutional warrant, for that of  States this is not necessary. In more technical phrase: to the United  States what is not granted is denied, to the State what is not denied is  granted. It is a perpetual reminder of original state sovereignty, that  no State can without its consent be deprived of its equal suffrage"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/22591"],[0,"A Political History of the State of New York, Volumes 1-3 (#16)"],[1,"way for  that admirable and orderly system of jurisprudence that has adorned  the judiciary of New York for more than a century. The men of the  older school had had their day. The court of Hobart was closed; the  age of Kent had opened.    Radcliff, the other judicial appointee, was not a new name in 1798;  but it was destined to become dearer to every lover of a chancery  lawyer. He had a natural gift for chancery, and no natural inclination  whatever for politics or the bench. So, after serving a single term in  the Assembly, two years as an assistant attorney-general, and six  years on the Supreme Court, he returned to the practice, to which he  devoted the remaining forty years of his life, save when holding the  office of mayor of New York in 1810, and again in 1815 during the  brief retirement of DeWitt Clinton. Wherever he appeared, Radcliff's  erect, dignified bearing and remarkably handsome face, illuminated  with large eyes and a highly intellectual expression, marked him as a  man of distinction. He set the custom of dictating bills in chancery  to an amanuensis, doing it with such accuracy that a word had seldom  to be changed. Of the same age as Kent, he must have been of great  help to that distinguished jurist, had he continued with the court.  While hovering somewhat uncertain between the bench and the bar, he  removed to New York City, where the opportunities for one of his gifts  soon settled the question.    Other appointments of Jay were equally satisfactory. The  comptrollership of state, recently created, went to Samuel Jones in  return for having patiently worked out this more perfect method of  controlling and disbursing state funds. Ambrose Spencer became an  assistant attorney-general, and the appointment of Rufus King as  minister to England made room for the election of John Lawrence to the  United States Senate. Lawrence had little claim, perhaps, to be  entered in the class with Rufus King, since he was neither leader nor  statesman; but he had been the faithful adjutant-general of  Washington, and a steady, fearless supporter of Hamilton. Lawrence, an  Englishman by birth, had settled in New York at an early period in  life, and by his marriage to the daughter of Alexander McDougall,  quickly came into conspicuous sympathy with the radical wing of the  patriotic party. He will always be remembered in history as  judge-advocate of the court that tried Major Andre. He held office  almost continuously from 1775 until his death in 1810, serving eight  years in the army, one in the State Senate, six in Congress, four as  judge of the United States District Court, and four as a United States  senator, closing his honourable career as president pro tem. of that  body.    As a rebuke to Aaron Burr's snap game so successfully played in 1791,  Philip Schuyler succeeded him in the United States Senate in 1797, an  event that must have sweetened the closing years of the Revolutionary  veteran. But Schuyler was now a sick man, and in January, 1798, he  resigned the senatorial toga to others, upon whose shoulders it rested  briefly, and possibly with less ease and grace. John Sloss Hobart wore  it for three months. After him, for ten months, came William North,  followed by James Watson, who, in turn, resigned in March, 1800. Thus,  in the short period of thirty-six months, four men tasted the sweets  of the exalted position so brilliantly filled by the erratic grandson  of Jonathan Edwards. North and Watson were men of certain ability and  certain gifts. Both had been soldiers. North had followed Arnold to  Quebec, had charged with his regiment at Monmouth, had served with  credit upon Baron Steuben's staff,[77] and had acquitted himself with  honour at Yorktown. He belonged to that coterie of brilliant young  men, noted for bravery and endurance, who quickly found favour with  the fighting generals of the Revolution. Watson resigned his captaincy  in 1777, and engaged successfully in mercantile pursuits, subsequently  entering the Assembly with North, the former becoming speaker in 1794  and the latter in 1795 and 1796. At the time of North's election to  the United States Senate, Watson was a member of the State Senate.  Like Lawrence, both were perfervid Federalists, zealous champions of  Hamilton, and profound believers in the wisdom of minimising, if not  abrogating, the rights of States.    [Footnote 77: At twenty-two years of age, while witnessing the  disgraceful rout of General Lee at Monmouth, North attracted the  attention of Steuben, whose tactics and discipline the young officer  subsequently introduced throughout the Continental army. The  cordiality existing between the earnest aide and the brave Prussian,  so dear to his friends, so formidable to his enemies, ripened into an  affectionate regard that recalls the relation between Washington and  Hamilton. After the war, with an annuity of twenty-five hundred  dollars and sixteen thousand acres of land in Oneida County, the gift  of New York, Steuben built a log house, withdrew from society, and  played at farming, until in 1794 his remains were borne to the spot,  not far from Trenton Falls, where stands the monument that bears his  name. The faithful North visited and cared for him to the end, and  under the terms of the will parcelled out the great estate among his  tenants and old staff officers.]    Watson's resignation from the United States Senate enabled the  Federalists to elect Gouverneur Morris just before the political  change in 1800 swept them from power. Morris was a fit successor to  Schuyler. His family had belonged to the State for a century and a  half. The name stood for tradition and conservatism--an embodiment of  the past amid the changes of revolution. His home near Harlaem, an  estate of three thousand acres, with a prospect of intermingled  islands and water, stretching to the Sound, which had been purchased  by a great-grandfather in the middle of the preceding century,  reflected the substantial character of its founder, a distinguished  officer in Cromwell's army.    Gouverneur was the child of his father's second marriage. The  family,[78] especially the older children, of whom Richard, chief  justice of the State, was the third and youngest boy, resented the  union, making Gouverneur's position resemble that of Joseph among his  brethren. Twenty-two years intervened between him and Richard. Before  the former left the schoolroom, the latter had succeeded his father as  judge of the vice-admiralty; but as for being of any assistance to the  fatherless lad Richard might as well have been vice-admiral of the  blue, sailing the seas. There would be something pathetic in this  estrangement, if independence and self-reliance had not dominated the  youngest son as well as the older heirs of this noble family. Lewis,  the eldest, served in the Continental Congress and became a signer of  the Declaration of Independence, while Staats Long, the second son,  wandered to England, married the Countess of Gordon, became a general  in the British army, and a member of Parliament in the days of Lord  North and Charles James Fox. It was a strange coincidence, one brother  resisting Parliament in Congress, the other resisting Congress in  Parliament.    [Footnote 78: There was a slight vein of eccentricity running through  the Morris family, with its occasional outcroppings accentuated in the  presence of death. The grandfather, distinguished as chief justice of  New York and governor of New Jersey, forbade in his will the payment  of any one for preaching his funeral sermon, but if a person  volunteered, he said, commending or blaming his conduct in life, his  words would be acceptable. Gouverneur's father desired no notice of  his dissolution in the newspapers, not even a simple announcement of  his death. \"My actions,\" he wrote, \"have been so inconsiderable in the  world, that the most durable monument will not perpetuate my folly  while it lasts.\" It is evident that Gouverneur did not inherit from  him the almost bumptious self-confidence which was to mar more than  help him. That inherent defect came from his mother, who gave him,  also, a brilliancy and versatility that other members of the family  did not share, making him more conspicuously active in high places  during the exciting days of the Revolution. Gouverneur Morris was a  national character; Richard and Lewis belonged exclusively to New  York.]    The influences surrounding Gouverneur's youth were decidedly Tory. His  mother warmly adhered to George the Third; his professors at King's  taught loyalty to the Crown; his distinguished tutor in the law,  William Smith, New York's Tory historian, magnified the work and the  strength of Parliament; while his associates, always his mother's  welcomed guests at Morrisania, were British officers, who talked of  Wolfe and his glorious struggles for England. But there never was a  moment from the time Gouverneur Morris entered the Provincial Congress  of New York on May 22, 1775, at the age of twenty-three, that he was  not conspicuously and brilliantly active in the cause of America.  Whenever or wherever a Revolutionary body was organised, or for  whatever purpose, Congress, Convention, or Committee of Safety, he  became a member of it. Six years younger than Jay, and six years older  than Hamilton, he seemed to complete that remarkable New York trio, so  fertile in mental resources and so successful in achievement. He did  not, like Jay, outline a constitution, but he believed, with Jay, in  balancing wealth against numbers, and in contending for the protection  of the rights of property against the spirit of democracy. It is  interesting to study these young men, so different in temperament, yet  thinking alike and acting together for a quarter of a century--Jay,  gentle and modest; Hamilton, impetuous and imperious; Morris,  self-confident and conceited; but on all essential matters of state,"]]]
