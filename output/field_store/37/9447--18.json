Though she is a violent  church-woman, of the most intolerant zeal, I believe in my conscience  she would have no objection, at present, to treat on the score of  matrimony with an Anabaptist, Quaker, or Jew; and even ratify the treaty  at the expense of her own conversion. But, perhaps, I think too hardly  of this kinswoman; who, I must own, is very little beholden to the good  opinion of    Yours, J. MELFORD BATH, May 6.          To Dr LEWIS.    You ask me, why I don't take the air a-horseback, during this fine  weather?--In which of the avenues of this paradise would you have me  take that exercise? Shall I commit myself to the high-roads of London  or Bristol, to be stifled with dust, or pressed to death in the midst  of post-chaises, flying-machines, waggons, and coal-horses; besides  the troops of fine gentlemen that take to the highway, to shew their  horsemanship; and the coaches of fine ladies, who go thither to shew  their equipages? Shall I attempt the Downs, and fatigue myself to death  in climbing up an eternal ascent, without any hopes of reaching the  summit? Know then, I have made divers desperate leaps at those upper  regions; but always fell backward into this vapour-pit, exhausted  and dispirited by those ineffectual efforts; and here we poor  valetudinarians pant and struggle, like so many Chinese gudgeons,  gasping in the bottom of a punch-bowl. By Heaven it is a kind of  enchantment! If I do not speedily break the spell, and escape, I may  chance to give up the ghost in this nauseous stew of corruption--It was  but two nights ago, that I had like to have made my public exit, at a  minute's warning. One of my greatest weaknesses is that of suffering  myself to be over-ruled by the opinion of people, whose judgment I  despise--I own, with shame and confusion of face, that importunity  of any kind I cannot resist. This want of courage and constancy is an  original flaw in my nature, which you must have often observed with  compassion, if not with contempt. I am afraid some of our boasted  virtues maybe traced up to this defect.    Without further preamble, I was persuaded to go to a ball, on purpose to  see Liddy dance a minuet with a young petulant jackanapes, the only  son of a wealthy undertaker from London, whose mother lodges in our  neighbourhood, and has contracted an acquaintance with Tabby. I sat a  couple of long hours, half stifled, in the midst of a noisome crowd;  and could not help wondering that so many hundreds of those that rank as  rational creatures, could find entertainment in seeing a succession of  insipid animals, describing the same dull figure for a whole evening, on  an area, not much bigger than a taylor's shop-board. If there had been  any beauty, grace, activity, magnificent dress, or variety of any kind  howsoever absurd, to engage the attention, and amuse the fancy, I should  not have been surprised; but there was no such object: it was a tiresome  repetition of the same languid, frivolous scene, performed by actors  that seemed to sleep in all their motions. The continual swimming of  these phantoms before my eyes, gave me a swimming of the head; which was  also affected by the fouled air, circulating through such a number of  rotten human bellows. I therefore retreated towards the door, and stood  in the passage to the next room, talking to my friend Quin; when an end  being put to the minuets, the benches were removed to make way for the  country-dances; and the multitude rising at once, the whole atmosphere  was put in commotion. Then, all of a sudden, came rushing upon me an  Egyptian gale, so impregnated with pestilential vapours, that my nerves  were overpowered, and I dropt senseless upon the floor.    You may easily conceive what a clamour and confusion this accident must  have produced, in such an assembly--I soon recovered, however, and found  myself in an easy chair, supported by my own people--Sister Tabby, in  her great tenderness, had put me to the torture, squeezing my hand under  her arm, and stuffing my nose with spirit of hartshorn, till the whole  inside was excoriated. I no sooner got home, than I sent for Doctor  Ch--, who assured me I needed not be alarmed, for my swooning was  entirely occasioned by an accidental impression of fetid effluvia upon  nerves of uncommon sensibility. I know not how other people's nerves  are constructed; but one would imagine they must be made of very coarse  materials, to stand the shock of such a torrid assault. It was, indeed,  a compound of villainous smells, in which the most violent stinks,  and the most powerful perfumes, contended for the mastery. Imagine to  yourself a high exalted essence of mingled odours, arising from putrid  gums, imposthumated lungs, sour flatulencies, rank armpits, sweating  feet, running sores and issues, plasters, ointments, and embrocations,  hungary-water, spirit of lavender, assafoetida drops, musk, hartshorn,  and sal volatile; besides a thousand frowzy steams, which I could not  analyse. Such, O Dick! is the fragrant aether we breathe in the polite  assemblies of Bath--Such is the atmosphere I have exchanged for the  pure, elastic, animating air of the Welsh mountains--O Rus, quando te  aspiciam!---I wonder what the devil possessed me--    But few words are best: I have taken my resolution--You may well suppose  I don't intend to entertain the company with a second exhibition--I have  promised, in an evil hour, to proceed to London, and that promise shall  be performed, but my stay in the metropolis shall be brief. I have, for  the benefit of my health, projected an expedition to the North, which, I  hope, will afford some agreeable pastime. I have never travelled farther  that way than Scarborough; and, I think, it is a reproach upon me, as a  British freeholder, to have lived so long without making an excursion to  the other side of the Tweed. Besides, I have some relations settled in  Yorkshire, to whom it may not be improper to introduce my nephew and  his sister--At present, I have nothing to add, but that Tabby is happily  disentangled from the Irish Baronet; and that I will not fail to make  you acquainted, from time to time, with the sequel of our adventures: a  mark of consideration, which, perhaps, you would willingly dispense with  in    Your humble servant, M. BRAMBLE BATH, May 8.          To Sir WATKIN PHILLIPS, of Jesus college, Oxon.    DEAR PHILLIPS,    A few days ago we were terribly alarmed by my uncle's fainting at the  ball--He has been ever since cursing his own folly, for going thither at  the request of an impertinent woman. He declares, he will sooner visit  a house infected with the plague, than trust himself in such a nauseous  spital for the future, for he swears the accident was occasioned by the  stench of the crowd; and that he would never desire a stronger proof of  our being made of very gross materials, than our having withstood the  annoyance, by which he was so much discomposed. For my part, I am very  thankful for the coarseness of my organs, being in no danger of  ever falling a sacrifice to the delicacy of my nose. Mr Bramble is  extravagantly delicate in all his sensations, both of soul and body. I  was informed by Dr Lewis, that he once fought a duel with an officer  of the horseguards, for turning aside to the Park-wall, on a necessary  occasion, when he was passing with a lady under his protection. His  blood rises at every instance of insolence and cruelty, even where he  himself is no way concerned; and ingratitude makes his teeth chatter. On  the other hand, the recital of a generous, humane, or grateful action,  never fails to draw from him tears of approbation, which he is often  greatly distressed to conceal.    Yesterday, one Paunceford gave tea, on particular invitation--This man,  after having been long buffetted by adversity, went abroad; and Fortune,  resolved to make him amends for her former coyness, set him all at once  up to the very ears in affluence. He has now emerged from obscurity,  and blazes out in all the tinsel of the times. I don't find that he is  charged with any practices that the law deems dishonest, or that his  wealth has made him arrogant and inaccessible; on the contrary, he  takes great pains to appear affable and gracious. But, they say, he  is remarkable for shrinking from his former friendships, which were  generally too plain and home-spun to appear amidst his present brilliant  connexions; and that he seems uneasy at sight of some old benefactors,  whom a man of honour would take pleasure to acknowledge--Be that as it  may, he had so effectually engaged the company at Bath, that when I went  with my uncle to the coffeehouse in the evening, there was not a soul  in the room but one person, seemingly in years, who sat by the fire,  reading one of the papers. Mr Bramble, taking his station close by  him, 'There is such a crowd and confusion of chairs in the passage to  Simpson's (said he) that we could hardly get along--I wish those  minions of fortune would fall upon more laudable ways of spending their  money.--I suppose, Sir, you like this kind of entertainment as little as  I do?' 'I cannot say I have any great relish for such entertainments,'  answered the other, without taking his eyes off the paper--'Mr Serle  (resumed my uncle) I beg pardon for interrupting you; but I can't resist  the curiosity I have to know if you received a card on this occasion?'    The man seemed surprised at this address, and made some pause, as  doubtful what answer he should make. 'I know my curiosity is impertinent  (added my uncle) but I have a particular reason for asking the favour.'  'If that be the case (replied Mr"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/21614"],[0,"For the Temple: A Tale of the Fall of Jerusalem (#16)"],[1,"interval between the wall and  bank. Josephus found that in such a conflict the Romans--with their  crowd of archers and slingers, and their formidable machines--had  all the advantage; and that it was absolutely necessary to raise  the walls still higher.    He called together a number of the principal men, and pointed out  the necessity for this. They agreed with him, but urged that it was  impossible for men to work, exposed to such a storm of missiles.  Josephus replied that he had thought of that. A number of strong  posts were prepared and, at night, these were fixed securely,  standing on the wall. Along the top of these, a strong rope was  stretched; and on this were hung, touching each other, the hides of  newly-killed oxen. These formed a complete screen, hiding the  workers from the sight of those on the embankment.    Illustration: Heightening the Walls of Jotapata under Shelter of Ox  Hides.    The hides, when struck with the stones from the ballistae, gave way  and deadened the force of the missiles; while the arrows and  javelins glanced off from the slippery surface. Behind this  shelter, the garrison worked night and day, raising the posts and  screens as their work proceeded, until they had heightened the wall  no less than thirty-five feet; with a number of towers on its  summit, and a strong battlement facing the Romans.    The besiegers were much discouraged at their want of success, and  enraged at finding the efforts of so large an army completely  baffled by a small town, which they had expected to carry at the  first assault; while the Jews proportionately rejoiced. Becoming  more and more confident, they continually sallied out in small  parties, through the gateway or by ladders from the walls, attacked  the Romans upon their embankment, or set fire to it. And it was the  desperation with which these men fought, even more than their  success in defending the wall, that discouraged the Romans; for the  Jews were utterly careless of their lives, and were well content to  die, when they saw that they had achieved their object of setting  fire to the Roman works.    Vespasian, at length, determined to turn the siege into a blockade;  and to starve out the town which he could not capture. He  accordingly contented himself by posting a strong force to defend  the embankment, and withdrew the main body of the army to their  encampment. He had been informed of the shortness of the supply of  water; and had anticipated that, in a very short time, thirst would  compel the inhabitants to yield.    John had taken his full share in the fighting, and had frequently  earned the warm commendation of Josephus. His spirits had risen  with the conflict; but he could not shut his eyes to the fact that,  sooner or later, the Romans must become masters of the place. One  evening, therefore, when he had done his share of duty on the  walls, he went up to the house which had been pointed out to him as  that in which lived the boy who had descended the face of the  rocks, for some distance.    At a short distance from the door, a lad of some fifteen years old,  with no covering but a piece of ragged sackcloth round the loins,  was crouched up in a corner, seemingly asleep. At the sound of  John's footsteps, he opened his eyes in a quick, watchful way, that  showed that he had not been really asleep.    \"Are you Jonas, the son of James?\" John asked.    \"Yes I am,\" the boy said, rising to his feet. \"What do you want  with me?\"    \"I want to have a talk with you,\" John said. \"I am one of the  governor's bodyguard; and I think, perhaps, you may be able to give  us some useful information.\"    \"Well, come away from here,\" the boy said, \"else we shall be having  her--\" and he nodded to the house, \"--coming out with a stick.\"    \"You have rather a hard time of it, from what I hear,\" John began,  when they stopped at the wall, a short distance away from the  house.    \"I have that,\" the boy said. \"I look like it, don't I?\"    \"You do,\" John agreed, looking at the boy's thin, half-starved  figure; \"and yet, there is plenty to eat in the town.\"    \"There may be,\" the boy said; \"anyhow, I don't get my share. Father  is away fighting on the wall, and so she's worse than ever. She is  always beating me, and I dare not go back, now. I told her, this  morning, the sooner the Romans came in, the better I should be  pleased. They could only kill me, and there would be an end of it;  but they would send her to Rome for a slave, and then she would see  how she liked being cuffed and beaten, all day.\"    \"And you are hungry, now?\" John asked.    \"I am pretty near always hungry,\" the boy said.    \"Well, come along with me, then. I have got a little room to  myself, and you shall have as much to eat as you like.\"    The room John occupied had formerly been a loft over a stable, in  the rear of the house in which Josephus now lodged; and it was  reached by a ladder from the outside. He had shared it, at first,  with two of his comrades; but these had both fallen, during the  siege. After seeing the boy up into it, John went to the house and  procured him an abundant meal; and took it, with a small horn of  water, back to his quarters.    \"Here's plenty for you to eat, Jonas, but not much to drink. We are  all on short allowance, the same as the rest of the people; and I  am afraid that won't last long.\"    There was a twinkle of amusement in the boy's face but, without a  word, he set to work at the food, eating ravenously all that John  had brought him. The latter was surprised to see that he did not  touch the water; for he thought that if his stepmother deprived him  of food, of which there was abundance, she would all the more  deprive him of water, of which the ration to each person was so  scanty.    \"Now,\" John said, \"you had better throw away that bit of sackcloth,  and take this garment. It belonged to a comrade of mine, who has  been killed.\"    \"There's too much of it,\" the boy said. \"If you don't mind my  tearing it in half, I will take it.\"    \"Do as you like with it,\" John replied; and the boy tore the long  strip of cotton in two, and wrapped half of it round his loins.    \"Now,\" he said, \"what do you want to ask me?\"    \"They tell me, Jonas, that you are a first-rate climber, and can go  anywhere?\"    The boy nodded.    \"I can get about, I can. I have been tending goats, pretty well  ever since I could walk and, where they can go, I can.\"    \"I want to know, in the first place, whether there is any possible  way by which one can get up and down from this place, except by the  road through the wall?\"    The boy was silent.    \"Now look here, Jonas,\" John went on, feeling sure that the lad  could tell something, if he would, \"if you could point out a way  down, the governor would be very pleased; and as long as the siege  lasts you can live here with me, and have as much food as you want,  and not go near that stepmother of yours, at all.\"    \"And nobody will beat me, for telling you?\" the boy asked.    \"Certainly not, Jonas.\"    \"It wouldn't take you beyond the Romans. They have got guards, all  round.\"    \"No, but it might enable us to get down to the water,\" John urged,  the sight of the unemptied horn causing the thought to flash  through his mind that the boy had been in the habit of going down,  and getting water.    \"Well, I will tell you,\" the boy said. \"I don't like to tell,  because I don't think there's anyone here knows it, but me. I found  it out, and I never said a word about it, because I was able to  slip away when I liked; and no one knows anything about it. But it  doesn't make much difference, now, because the Romans are going to  kill us all. So I will tell you.    \"At the end of the rock, you have to climb down about fifty feet.  It's very steep there, and it's as much as you can do to get down;  but when you have got down that far, you get to the head of a sort  of dried-up water course, and it ain't very difficult to go down  there and, that way, you can get right down to the stream. It don't  look, from below, as if you could do it; and the Romans haven't put  any guards on the stream, just there. I know, because I go down  every morning, as soon as it gets light. I never tried to get  through the Roman sentries; but I expect one could, if one tried.    \"But I don't see how you are to bring water up here, if that's what  you want. I tell you, it is as much as you can do to get up and  down, and you want both your hands and your feet; but I could go  down and bring up a little water for you, in a skin hanging round  my neck, if you like.\"    \"I am afraid that wouldn't be much good, Jonas,\" John said; \"but it  might be very useful to send messages out, that way.\"    \"Yes,\" the boy said; \"but you see I have always intended, when the  Romans took the place, to make off that way. If other people go,  it's pretty sure to be found out, before long; and then the Romans  will keep watch. But it don't much matter. I know another place  where you and I could lie hidden, any time, if we had got enough to  eat and drink. I will show you but, mind, you must promise not to  tell anyone else. There's no room for more than two; and I don't  mean to tell you, unless you promise.\"    \"I will promise, Jonas. I promise you, faithfully, not to tell  anyone.\"    \"Well, the way down ain't far from the other one. I will show it  you, one of these days. I went down there, once, to get a hawk I  had taken from the nest, and tamed. I went down, first, with a rope  tied round me; but I found I could have done it without that--but I  didn't tell any of the others, as I wanted to keep the place to  myself.    \"You climb down about fifty feet, and then you get on a sort of  ledge, about three feet wide and six or seven feet long. You can't  see it from above, because it's a hollow, as if a bit of rock had  fallen out. Of course, if you stood up you might be seen by someone  below, or on the hill opposite; but it's so"]]]
