Even the roots of the felled trees  had disappeared. All was fair and new about the house of Tully-Veolan,  even to the bright colours of the garb of Davie Gellatley, who ran first  to one and then to the other of the company, passing his hands over his  new clothes and crying, \"Braw, braw Davie!\"    The dogs, Bran and Buscar, leaping upon him, brought tears into the  Baron's eyes, even more than the kind welcome of Colonel Talbot's wife,  the Lady Emily. Still more astonishing appeared the changes in the so  lately ruined courtyard. The burned stables had been rebuilt upon a  newer and better plan. The pigeon-house was restocked, and populous with  fluttering wings. Even the smallest details of the garden, and the  multitude of stone bears on the gables, had all been carefully restored  as of old.    The Baron could hardly believe his eyes, and he marvelled aloud that  Colonel Talbot had not thought fit to replace the Bradwardine arms by  his own. But here the Colonel, suddenly losing patience, declared that  he would not, even to please these foolish boys, Waverley and Frank  Stanley (and his own more foolish wife), continue to impose upon another  old soldier. So without more ado he told the Baron that he had only  advanced the money to buy back the Barony, and that he would leave  Bailie Macwheeble to explain to whom the estate really belonged.    Trembling with eagerness the Bailie advanced, a formidable roll of  papers in his hand.    He began triumphantly to explain that Colonel Talbot had indeed bought  Bradwardine, but that he had immediately exchanged it for Brere-wood  Lodge, which had been left to Edward under his father's will.  Bradwardine had therefore returned to its ancient Lord in full and  undisputed possession, and the Baron was once more master of all his  hereditary powers, subject only to an easy yearly payment to his  son-in-law.    Tears were actually in the old gentleman's eyes as he went from room to  room, so that he could scarce speak a word of welcome either to the  guests within, or of thanks to the rejoicing farmers and cottars who,  hearing of his return, had gathered without. The climax of his joy was,  however, reached when the Blessed Bear of Bradwardine itself, the  golden cup of his line, mysteriously recovered out of the spoil of the  English army by Frank Stanley, was brought to the Baron's elbow by old  Saunders Saunderson.    Truth to tell, the recovery of this heirloom afforded the old man almost  as much pleasure as the regaining of his Barony, and there is little  doubt that a tear mingled with the wine, as, holding the Blessed Bear in  his hand, the Baron solemnly proposed the healths of the united families  of Waverley-Honour and Bradwardine.      THE END OF THE LAST TALE FROM \"WAVERLEY.\"          RED CAP TALES    TOLD FROM    GUY MANNERING          GUY MANNERING      WHERE WE TOLD THE SECOND TALE    SUMMER there had been none. Autumn was a mockery. The golden harvest  fields lay prostrate under drenching floods of rain. Every burn foamed  creamy white in the linns and sulked peaty brown in the pools. The  heather, rich in this our Galloway as an emperor's robe, had scarce  bloomed at all. The very bees went hungry, for the lashing rain had  washed all the honey out of the purple bells.    Nevertheless, in spite of all, we were again in Galloway--that is, the  teller of tales and his little congregation of four. The country of _Guy  Mannering_ spread about us, even though we could scarce see a hundred  yards of it. The children flattened their noses against the blurred  window-panes to look. Their eyes watered with the keen tang of the peat  reek, till, tired with watching the squattering of ducks in farm  puddles, they turned as usual upon the family sagaman, and demanded,  with that militant assurance of youth which succeeds so often, that he  should forthwith and immediately \"tell them something.\"    The tales from _Waverley_ had proved so enthralling that there was a  general demand for \"another,\" and Sir Toady Lion, being of an  arithmetical turn of mind, proclaimed that there was plenty of material,  in so much as he had counted no fewer than twenty-four \"all the same\"  upon the shelf before he left home.    Thus, encouraged by the dashing rain on the windows and with the low  continual growl of Solway surf in our ears, we bent ourselves to fill a  gap in a hopeless day by the retelling of          A FIRST TALE FROM \"GUY MANNERING\"      I. WITCHCRAFT AND WIZARDRY    THROUGH storm and darkness a young Oxford scholar came to the New Place  of Ellangowan. He had been again and again refused shelter along the  road for himself and his tired horse, but at last he found himself  welcomed by Godfrey Bertram, the Laird of Ellangowan, attended by  Dominie Sampson, his faithful companion, the village schoolmaster, on  the threshold of the great house.    That very night an heir was born to the line of the Bertrams of  Ellangowan, one of the most ancient in Galloway, and as usual the New  Place was full of company come from far and near to make merry over the  event. Godfrey himself, a soft, good-natured, pliable man, welcomed  Mannering (for that was the name of the young Oxford student), and set  him forthwith to calculating the horoscope of the babe from the stars.  This, Mannering, to whom astrology seemed no better than child's play,  was at first unwilling to do, until the awkward opposition of Dominie  Sampson, as well as some curiosity to see if he could remember the terms  of the sham-science learned in youth, caused him to consent to make the  calculation.    He was still further pushed on by the appearance of a wild gipsy woman,  a sort of queen among the ragged wandering tribe which camped in a  little hamlet on the Laird's estates. She entered the house singing  shrilly a kind of ancient spell:            \"Trefoil, vervain, John's wort, dill,           Hinder witches of their will!           Weel is them, that weel may           Fast upon Saint Andrew's day.           Saint Bride and her brat,           Saint Colme and his cat,           Saint Michael and his spear           Keep the house frae reif and weir.\"    So sang Meg Merrilies, the gipsy, a great cudgel in her hand, and her  dress and bearing more like those of a man than of a woman. Elf-locks  shot up through the holes in her bonnet, and her black eyes rolled with  a kind of madness. Soon, however, Godfrey, who evidently only half  disbelieved in her powers as a witch, dismissed her to the kitchen with  fair words, while Guy Mannering, whom his strange adventure had rendered  sleepless, walked forth into the night. The vast ruins of the ancient  castle of the Bertrams rose high and silent on the cliffs above him, but  beneath, in the little sandy cove, lights were still moving briskly,  though it was the dead hour of the night. A smuggler brig was disloading  a cargo of brandy, rum, and silks, most likely, brought from the Isle of  Man.    At sight of his figure moving on the cliffs above, a voice on the shore  sang out, \"Ware hawk! Douse the glim!\" And in a moment all was darkness  beneath him.    When Mannering returned to his chamber in the dim light of the morning,  he proceeded to carry out his calculations according to the strictest  rules of astrology, marking carefully the hour of the birth of the babe.  He found that young Harry Bertram, for so it had been decided to name  the child, was threatened with danger in his _fifth_, his _tenth_, and  his _twenty-first_ years.    More dissatisfied than he cared to own with these results, Mannering  walked out again to view the ruins of the old castle of Ellangowan in  the morning light. They were, he now saw, of vast extent and much  battered on the side toward the sea--so much so, indeed, that he could  observe through a gap in the mason-work, the smuggling brig getting  ready to be off with the tide. Guy Mannering penetrated into the  courtyard, and was standing there quietly, thinking of the past  greatness of the house of Bertram, when suddenly, from a chamber to the  left, he heard the voice of the gipsy, Meg Merrilies. A few steps took  him to a recess from which, unseen himself, he could observe what she  was doing. She continued to twirl her distaff, seemingly unconscious of  his presence, and also, after her own fashion, to \"spae\" the fortune of  young Harry Bertram, just as Mannering had so lately been doing himself.  Curiosity as to whether their results would agree kept him quiet while  she wove her spell. At last she gave her verdict: \"A long life, three  score and ten years, but thrice broken by trouble or danger. The threads  thrice broke, three times united. He'll be a lucky lad if he wins  through wi' it!\"    Mannering had hardly time to be astonished at the manner in which the  gipsy's prophecy confirmed his own half-playful calculations, before a  voice, loud and hoarse as the waves that roared beneath the castle,  called to the witch-wife, \"Meg, Meg Merrilies--gipsy--hag--tousand  deyvils!\"    \"Coming, Captain--I am coming!\" answered Meg, as calmly as if some one  had been calling her pet names. Through the broken portion of the wall  to seaward a man made his appearance. He was hard of feature,  savage-looking, and there was a cruel glint in his eyes which told of a  heart without pity.    The man's body, powerful and thick-set as an oak, his immense strength,  his savage temper made him shunned and disliked. There were few indeed  who would have ventured to cross the path of Dirk Hatteraick, whose best  name was \"black smuggler,\" and whose worst a word it was safest to speak  in a whisper, lest a bird of the air should carry the matter.    On the present occasion Dirk had come to the gipsy queen to demand of  her a charm for a fair wind and a prosperous voyage. For the less  religion such a man has, the more superstitious he is apt to be.    \"Where are you, Mother Deyvilson?\" he cried again. \"Donner and"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/22675"],[0,"Home Life in Colonial Days (#16)"],[1,"word nookick for the English  words flour or meal.    We ought to think of the value of food in those days; and we may be sure  the governor and his council thought corn of value when they took it for  taxes and made it a legal currency just like gold and silver, and  forbade any one to feed it to pigs. If you happen to see the price of  corn during those years down to Revolutionary times, you will, perhaps,  be surprised to see how much the price varied. From ten shillings a  bushel in 1631, to two shillings in 1672, to twenty in 1747, to two in  1751, and one hundred shillings at the opening of the Revolution. In  these prices of corn, as in the price of all other articles at this  time, the difference was in the money, which had a constantly changing  value, not in the article itself or its usefulness. The corn had a  steady value, it always furnished just so much food; and really was a  standard itself rather than measured and valued by the poor and shifting  money.    There are many other interesting facts connected with the early culture  of corn: of the finding hidden in caves or \"caches\" in the ground the  Indian's corn which he had stored for seed; of the sacred \"corn-dances\"  of the Indians; that the first patent granted in England to an American  was to a Philadelphia woman for a mill to grind a kind of hominy; of  the great profit to the colonists in corn-raising, for the careless and  greedy Indians always ate up all their corn as soon as possible, then  had to go out and trap beavers in the woods to sell the skins to the  colonists for corn to keep them from starving. One colonist planted  about eight bushels of seed-corn. He raised from this eight hundred and  sixty-four bushels of corn, which he sold to the Indians for beaver  skins which gave him a profit of L327.    Many games were played with the aid of kernels of corn: fox and geese,  checkers, \"hull gull, how many,\" and games in which the corn served as  counters.    The ears of corn were often piled into the attic until the floor was a  foot deep with them. I once entered an ell bedroom in a Massachusetts  farmhouse where the walls, rafters, and four-post bedstead were hung  solid with ears of yellow corn, which truly \"made a sunshine in a shady  place.\"    Some of the preparation of corn fell upon the boys; it was their regular  work all winter in the evening firelight to shell corn from the ears by  scraping them on the iron edge of the wooden shovel or on the fire-peel.  My father told me that even in his childhood in the first quarter of  this century many families of moderate means fastened the long-handled  frying-pan across a tub and drew the corn ears across the sharp edge of  the handle of the pan. I note in Peter Parley's reminiscences of his  childhood a similar use of a frying-pan handle in his home. Other  farmers set the edge of a knife blade in a piece of wood and scraped on  the back of the blade. In some households the corn was pounded into  hominy in wooden mortars. An old corn-sheller used in western  Massachusetts is here shown.    When the corn was shelled, the cobs were not carelessly discarded or  disregarded. They were stored often in a lean-to or loft in the kitchen  ell; from thence they were brought down in skepes or boxes about a  bushel at a time; and after being used by the children as playthings to  build \"cob-houses,\" were employed as light wood for the fire. They had a  special use in many households for smoking hams; and their smoke was  deemed to impart a specially delightful flavor to hams and bacon.    One special use of corn should be noted. By order of the government of  Massachusetts Bay in 1623, it was used as ballots in public voting. At  annual elections of the governors' assistants in each town, a kernel of  corn was deposited to signify a favorable vote upon the nominee, while a  bean signified a negative vote; \"and if any free-man shall put in more  than one Indian corn or bean he shall forfeit for every such offence Ten  Pounds.\"    The choice of a national flower or plant is much talked about to-day.  Aside from the beauty of maize when growing and its wonderful  adaptability in every part for decoration, would not the noble and  useful part played by Indian corn in our early history entitle it to be  our first choice?          CHAPTER VII    MEAT AND DRINK      The food brought in ships from Europe to the colonists was naturally  limited by the imperfect methods of transportation which then existed.  Nothing like refrigerators were known; no tinned foods were even thought  of; ways of packing were very crude and careless; so the kinds of  provisions which would stand the long voyage on a slow sailing-vessel  were very few. The settlers turned at once, as all settlers in a new  land should, to the food-supplies found in the new home; of these the  three most important ones were corn, fish, and game. I have told of  their plenty, their value, and their use. There were many other  bountiful and good foods, among them pumpkins or pompions, as they were  at first called.    The pumpkin has sturdily kept its own place on the New England farm,  varying in popularity and use, but always of value as easy of growth,  easy of cooking, and easy to keep in a dried form. Yet the colonists did  not welcome the pumpkin with eagerness, even in times of great want.  They were justly rebuked for their indifference and dislike by Johnson  in his _Wonder-working Providence_, who called the pumpkin \"a fruit  which the Lord fed his people with till corn and cattle increased\"; and  another pumpkin-lover referred to \"the times wherein old Pompion was a  saint.\" One colonial poet gives the golden vegetable this tribute:--        \"We have pumpkins at morning and pumpkins at noon,      If it were not for pumpkins we should be undone.\"    I am very sure were I living on dried corn and scant shell-fish, as the  Pilgrims were forced to do, I should have turned with delight to  \"pompion-sause\" as a change of diet. Stewed pumpkins and pumpkin bread  were coarse ways of using the fruit for food. Pumpkin bread--made of  half Indian meal--was not very pleasing in appearance. A traveller in  1704 called it an \"awkward food.\" It is eaten in Connecticut to this  day. The Indians dried pumpkins and strung them for winter use, and the  colonists followed the Indian custom.    In Virginia pumpkins were equally plentiful and useful. Ralph Hamor, in  his _True Discourse_, says they grew in such abundance that a hundred  were often observed to spring from one seed. The Virginia Indians boiled  beans, peas, corn, and pumpkins together, and the colonists liked the  dish. In the trying times at \"James-Citty,\" the plentiful pumpkins  played a great part in providing food-supplies for the starving  Virginians.    Squashes were also native vegetables. The name is Indian. To show the  wonderful and varied way in which the English spelt Indian names let me  tell you that Roger Williams called them askutasquashes; the Puritan  minister Higginson, squantersquashes; the traveller Josselyn,  squontorsquashes, and the historian Wood, isquoukersquashes.    Potatoes were known to New Englanders, but were rare and when referred  to were probably sweet potatoes. It was a long time before they were  much liked. A farmer at Hadley, Massachusetts, had what he thought a  very large crop in 1763--it was eight bushels. It was believed by many  persons that if a man ate them every day, he could not live seven years.  In the spring all that were left on hand were carefully burned, for many  believed that if cattle or horses ate these potatoes they would die.  They were first called, when carried to England, Virginia potatoes; then  they became much liked and grown in Ireland; then the Irish settlers in  New Hampshire brought them back to this continent, and now they are  called, very senselessly, Irish potatoes. Many persons fancied the balls  were what should be eaten, and said they \"did not much desire them.\" A  fashionable way of cooking them was with butter, sugar, and grape-juice;  this was mixed with dates, lemons, and mace; seasoned with cinnamon,  nutmeg, and pepper; then covered with a frosting of sugar--and you had  to hunt well to find the potato among all these other things.    In the Carolinas the change in English diet was effected by the sweet  potato. This root was cooked in various ways: it was roasted in the  ashes, boiled, made into puddings, used as a substitute for bread, made  into pancakes which a foreigner said tasted as though composed of sweet  almonds; and in every way it was liked and was so plentiful that even  the slaves fed upon it.    Beans were abundant, and were baked by the Indians in earthen pots just  as we bake them to-day. The settlers planted peas, parsnips, turnips,  and carrots, which grew and thrived. Huckleberries, blackberries,  strawberries, and grapes grew wild. Apple-trees were planted at once,  and grew well in New England and the Middle states. Twenty years after  the Roman Catholic settlement of Maryland the fruitful orchards were  conspicuously flourishing.    Johnson, writing in 1634, said that all then in New England could have  apple, pear, and quince tarts instead of pumpkin-pies. They made  apple-slump, apple-mose, apple-crowdy, apple-tarts, mess apple-pies, and  puff apple-pies. The Swedish parson, Dr. Acrelius, writing home in 1758  an account of the settlement of Delaware, said:--         \"Apple-pie is used through the whole year, and when fresh apples       are no longer to be had, dried ones are used. It is the evening       meal of children. House-pie, in country places, is made of apples       neither peeled nor freed from their cores, and its crust is not       broken if a wagon wheel goes over it.\"    The making of a portion of the autumn's crop of apples into dried  apples, apple-sauce, and apple-butter for winter was preceded in many  country homes by an apple-paring.
