This last I had to tear apart and carry away in  pieces, it was so heavy.  I had the good luck to find a box of sugar and  a barrel of fine flour.  On my twelfth voyage I found two or three  razors with perfect edges, one pair of large scissors, with some ten or  a dozen good knives and forks.  In a drawer I found some money.  \"Oh, drug!\" I exclaimed.  \"What art thou good for?\"    (To a man alone on a desert island, money certainly has no value.  He can buy nothing, sell nothing; he has no debts to be paid; he earns  his bread by the sweat of his brow, his business is all with himself and  nature, and nature expects no profit, but allows no credit, for a man  must pay in work as he goes along.  Crusoe had many schemes; but it took  a great deal of work to carry them out; and the sum of all was steady  work for twenty-five years.  In the end we conclude that whatever he got  was dearly bought.  We come to know what a thing is worth only by  measuring its value in the work which it takes to get that thing or to  make it, as Crusoe did his chairs, tables, earthenware, etc.)    Questions and Notes.

I now proceeded to choose a healthy, convenient, and pleasant spot  for my home.  I had chiefly to consider three things: First, air;  second, shelter from the heat; third, safety from wild creatures,  whether men or beasts; fourth, a view of the sea, that if God sent any  ship in sight I might not lose any chance of deliverance.  In the course  of my search I found a little plain on the side of a rising hill, with  a hollow like the entrance to a cave.  Here I resolved to pitch my tent.    (He afterward found a broad, grassy prairie on the other side of the  island, where he wished he had made his home.  On the slope above grew  grapes, lemons, citrons, melons, and other kinds of fruit.)    17.  Aft er ten or twelve days it came into my thoughts that I should  lose my reckoning for want of pen and ink; but to prevent this I cut  with my knife upon a large post in capital letters the following words:  \"I came on shore here on the 30th of September, 1659.\"  On the sides of  this post I cut every day a notch; and thus I kept my calendar,  or weekly, monthly, and yearly reckoning of time.    (He afterward found pen, ink, and paper in the ship; but the record on  the post was more lasting than anything he could have written on paper.  However, when he got his pen and ink he wrote out a daily journal,  giving the history of his life almost to the hour and minute.  Thus he tells us that the shocks of earthquake were eight minutes apart,  and that he spent eighteen days widening his cave.)    18.  I made a strong fence of stakes about my tent that no animal could  tear down, and dug a cave in the side of the hill, where I stored my powder  and other valuables.  Every day I went out with my gun on this scene of  silent life.  I could only listen to the birds, and hear the wind among  the trees.  I came out, however, to shoot goats for food.  I found that as  I came down from the hills into the valleys, the wild goats did not see me;  but if they caught sight of me, as they did if I went toward them from  below, they would turn tail and run so fast I could capture nothing.

Yet I made clothes and sewed up the seams with  tough stripe of goatskin.  I afterward got handkerchiefs and shirts from  another wreck.  However, for want of tools my work went on heavily;  yet I managed to make a chair, a table, and several large shelves.  For a long time I was in want of a wagon or carriage of some kind.  At last I hewed out a wheel of wood and made a wheelbarrow.    20.  I worked as steadily as I could for the rain, for this was the  rainy season.  I may say I was always busy.  I raised a turf wall close  outside my double fence, and felt sure if any people came on shore they  would not see anything like a dwelling.  I also made my rounds in the  woods every day.  As I have already said, I found plenty of wild goats.  I also found a kind of wild pigeon, which builds, not as wood pigeons do,  in trees, but in holes of the rocks.  The young ones were very good meat.    Questions and Notes.

I found that the seasons of the year might generally be divided,  not into summer and winter, as in Europe, but into the rainy seasons and  the dry seasons, which were generally thus: From the middle of February to  the middle of April (including March), rainy; the sun being then on or near  the equinox.  From the middle of April to the middle of August (including  May, June, and July), dry; the sun being then north of the equator.  From the middle of August till the middle of October (including September),  rainy; the sun being then come back to the equator.  From the middle of  October till the middle of February (including November, December,  and January), dry; the sun being then to the south of the equator.    22.  I have already made mention of some grain that had been spoiled by  the rats.  Seeing nothing but husks and dust in the bag which had  contained this, I shook it out one"]]]
