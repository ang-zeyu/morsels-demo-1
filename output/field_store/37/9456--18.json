The heart is not quadrilocular (i.e., of four chambers), but  trilocular (of three), and two structures, not seen in Lepus, the  truncus arteriosus and the sinus venosus, into the latter of which  the venous blood runs before entering the right auricle, are to be  noted. The single ventricle is blocked with bars of tissue that render  its interior, not an open cavity, but a spongy mass. Figure 2, Sheet  11, shows the heart opened; l.au. and r.au. are the left and right  auricles respectively; the truncus arteriosus is seen to be imperfectly  divided by a great longitudino-spiral valve (l.s.v.); p.c. is the  pulmo-cutaneous artery -going to the lungs- [supplying skin and  lungs]; d.ao., the dorsal aorta [furnishing the supply of the body and  limbs]; and c.a. the carotid artery going to the head; all of which  vessels (compare Figure 1) are paired.      Section 8. It might be inferred from this that pure and impure blood  mix in the ventricle, and that a blood of uniform quality flows to lungs,  head, and extremities; but this is not so. The spongy nature of the  ventricle sufficiently retards this mixing. It will be noted that the  opening of pulmonary arteries lies nearest to the heart, next come the  aortic and carotid arches, which have a common opening at A.  Furthermore, at c.g.l. [the carotid artery, repeatedly divides to form a  close meshwork of arterioles, the carotid gland, forming a sponge-like  plug in this vessel.] is a spongy mass of matter, the carotid gland  inserted upon the carotid. Hence the pulmonary arteries yawn nearest  for the blood, and, being short, wide vessels, present the least  resistance to the first rush of blood-- mainly venous blood for the right  auricle. As they fill up, the back resistance in them becomes equal,  and then greater, than the resistance at A, and the rush of blood, now  of a mixed quality passes through that aperture. It selects the dorsal  aorta, because the carotid arch, plugged by the carotid gland, offers  the greater resistance. Presently, however, the back resistance of the  filled dorsal aorta rises above this, and the last flow of blood, from the  ventricular systole-- almost purely oxygenated blood for the left  auricle-- goes on towards the head.      Section 9. At the carotid gland the carotid artery splits into -an- [a]  -external carotid- [lingual] (e.c.), and a deeper internal carotid. The  dorsal aorta passes round on each side of the oesophagus, as  indicated by the dotted lines in Figure 2, Sheet 11, and meets its  fellow dorsal to the liver. Each arch gives off subclavian arteries to the  limbs, and the left, immediately before meeting the right, gives off the  coeliaco-mesenteric artery [to the alimentary canal]. This origin of the  coeliaco-mesenteric artery a little to the left, is the only asymmetry  (want of balance) in the arterial system of the frog, as contrasted with  the very extensive asymmetry of the great vessels near the heart of  the rabbit. [Posteriorly the dorsal aorta forks into two common iliac  arteries (right and left) supplying the hind limbs.]      Section 10. Figure 3 gives a side view of the frog, to display the  circulation.       {Lines from Second Edition only.}     [The venous return to the heart, as in the rabbit, is by paired venae     cavae anteriores and by a single vena cava inferior. The factors of the     anterior cava on either side are an external jugular (ex.j.) an     innominate vein (in.v.) and subclavian (scl.v.). The last receives not     only the brachial vein (b.v.) from the fore limb, but also a large vein     bringing blood for the skin, the cutaneous (p.v.). The innominate vein     has also two chief factors, the internal jugular (l.i.j.v.) and the     subscapular (s.s.v.). The blood returns from each hind limb by a     sciatic (l.sc.) or femoral (f.m.) vein, and either passes to a renal portal     vein (l.r.p.), which breaks into capillaries in the kidney, or by a paired     pelvic vein (l.p.v. in Figures 1 and 3) which meets its fellow in the     middle line to form the anterior abdominal vein (a.ab.v.) going forward     and uniting with the (median) portal vein (p.v.) to enter the liver.]    -The vessels are named in the references to the figure, which should  be carefully copied and mastered. Here we need only- [Comparing  with the rabbit, we would especially] call attention to the fact that the  vena cava inferior extends posteriorly only to the kidney, and that  there is a renal portal system. The blood from the hind limbs either  flows by the anterior abdominal vein to the portal vein and liver, or it  passes by the renal portal vein to the kidney. There the vein breaks  up, and we find in the frog's kidney, just as we find in the frog's and  rabbit's liver, a triple system of (a) nutritive arterial, (b) afferent*  venous and (c) efferent** venous vessels.    * a, ad = to;  ** e, ex = out of.      {This Section missing from Second Edition.}  -Section 11. It is not very improbable that the kidney of the frog  shares, or performs, some of the functions of the rabbit's liver, or  parallel duties, in addition to the simply excretory function. Since  specialization of cells must be mainly the relatively excessive  exaggeration of some one of the general properties of the  undifferentiated cell, it is not a difficult thing to imagine a gradual  transition, as we move from one organism to another, of the functions  of glands and other cellular organs. It is probable that the mammalian  kidney is, physiologically, a much less important (though still quite  essential) organ than the structures which correspond to it in position  and development in the lower vertebrate types.-      Section 12. The lymphatic system is extensively developed in the  frog, but, in the place of a complete system of distinctly organized  vessels, there are great lymph sinuses (compare Section 1). In Figure  5, Sheet 12, the position of two lymph hearts (l.h., l.h.) which pump  lymph into the adjacent veins, is shown.      Section 13. The skull of the frog will repay a full treatment, and will  be dealt with by itself later. The vertebral column (Sheet 12)  consists of nine vertebrae, the centra of which have faces, not flat, but  hollow in front (pro-coelous), and evidently without epiphyses  (compare the Rabbit). The anterior is sometimes called the atlas, but  it is evidently not the homologue of the atlas of the rabbit, since the  first spinal nerve has a corresponding distribution to the twelfth cranial  of the mammal, and since, therefore, it is probable that the  mammalian skull = the frog's skull + one (or more) vertebrae  incorporated with it. Posteriorly the vertebral column terminates in the  urostyle, a calcified unsegmented rod. The vertebrae have transverse  processes, but no ribs.      Section 14. The fore-limb (Figure 6, Sheet 12) consists of an upper  segment of one bone, the humerus, as in the rabbit; a middle section,  the radius and ulna, fused here into one bone, and not, as in the  mammalian type, separable; of a carpus, and of five digits, of which  the fourth is the longest. The shoulder girdle is more important and  complete than that of the higher type. There is a scapula (sc.) with an  unossified cartilaginous supra-scapula (s.sc.); the anterior border of  the scapula answers to the acromion. On the ventral side a  cartilaginous rod, embraced by the clavicle (cl.) (a membrane bone in  this type), runs to the sternum, and answers to the clavicle of the  rabbit. In the place of the rabbit's coracoid process, is a coracoid  bone (co.), which reaches from the glenoid cavity to the sternum; it is  hidden on the right side of Figure 6, which is a dorsal view of the  shoulder girdle. There is a pre-omosternum (o.st.) and a  post-omosternum, sometimes termed a xiphisternum (x.).      Section 15. Figure 7 shows the pelvic girdle and limb of the frog.  There is a femur (f.); tibia and fibula (t. and f.) are completely fused;  the proximal bones of the tarsus, the astragalus (as.), and calcaneum  (cal.) are elongated, there are five long digits, and in the calcar (c.) an  indication of a sixth. With considerable modifications of form, the  three leading constituents of the rabbit's pelvic girdle occur in  relatively identical positions. The greatly elongated ilium (il.)  articulates with the single (compare Rabbit) sacral vertebra (s.v. in  Figure 5). The ischium (is.) is relatively smaller than in the rabbit, and  the pubis (pu.) is a ventral wedge of unossified cartilage. The shape of  the pelvic girdle of the frog is a wide departure from that found among  related forms. In connection with the leaping habit, the ilia are greatly  elongated, and the pubes and ischia much reduced. Generally  throughout the air-frequenting vertebrata, we find the same  arrangement of these three bones, usually in the form of an inverted.  Y-- the ilium above, the ischium and pubis below, and the acetabulum  at the junction of the three.      Section 16. The uro-genital organs of the frog, and especially those  of the male, correspond with embryonic stages of the rabbit. In this  sex the testes (T., Sheet 13) lie in the body cavity, and are white  bodies usually dappled with black pigment. Vasa efferentia (v.e.) run  to the internal border of the anterior part of the kidney, which answers,  therefore, to the rabbit's epididymis. The hinder part of the kidney is  the predominant renal organ. There is a common uro-genital duct, into  which a seminal vesicle, which is especially large in early spring,  opens. This is the permanent condition of the frog. In the rabbit, for  urogenital duct, we have ureter and vas deferens; the testes and that  anterior part of the primitive kidney, the epididymis, shift back into the  scrotal sacs, and the ureters shift round the rectum and establish a  direct connection with the"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/21783"],[0,"A Manual of Pronunciation (#16)"],[1,"         t[=e]-r[:a]d´
