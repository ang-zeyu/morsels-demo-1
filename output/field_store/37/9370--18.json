Then both on the Emperor's head and on the smaller figures the  crowns are different--the panelling of the Imperial canopy is different,  and, of course, there is a different inscription. Lastly, it may be said  that some of the differences are improvements. Another change is  characteristic--Charles was beardless, Henry has a pointed beard.    It is true this is an example belonging to the very brightest years of  the Othonian revival. But to pass over other Saxon MSS., there are  extant examples from Evroul (when Roger de Warenne, son of the great  Earl of Surrey, practised as a scribe and illuminator on his retirement  to that monastery), St. Martin's of Tournay, St. Amand, Benedictbeuern,  Lobbes, and Weissobrunn could all boast accomplished calligraphers. The  last establishment produced the celebrated Diemudis, who, though a  woman, was distinguished by a most extraordinary activity and skill.    Nor are these all that could be named, for by no means least among them  we may quote Monte Cassino, many of whose elegant productions have been  published by the present occupants of the monastery. Then the Greek  miniaturists of the eleventh century are once more to the front. The  famous Slav Evangeliary of Ostromir (1056-67) shows us a MS. probably  executed for a governor of Novgorod, which contains by no means  despicable work, whether in the figures of the evangelists or the  ornamental borders. Of course, in Greek MSS. we know pretty well what to  expect; fairly good ornament, rich details of embroidery, etc.,  wilfulness of colour in architecture, mannerism in the attitudes and  faces, but good, clever technic and bright gold.    Lastly, there is the celebrated Evangeliary given to San Benedetto of  Mantua by the Countess Matilda now in the Vatican, enriched with little  miniatures from the Life of the Virgin, which Lanzi declares surpass  everything else he ever saw of the same period.    The Poitevin MS. at Poitiers, a biographical compilation of saints in  honour of St. Radegonde, though nothing wonderful, is worth recording as  a transitional example just before the close of the century. As an  example of the latter part of a continual deterioration, it should be  worse than anything preceding. Yet it is not so. It is certainly heavy  and rather dull, and the drawing far from excellent, but it is also, on  the other hand, far from \"frankly horrible.\" In introducing examples of  other schools into this chapter the writer's object has solely been to  vindicate the illuminators of the eleventh century from the sweeping  charge sometimes made against them of absolute deterioration. Of the  school directly under our notice, the charge is certainly not true, and  the wretched stuff cited in support of it can only be looked upon as  accidental salvages of no artistic value whatever.    In proof that the book-work of the eleventh century was not all  worthless, we may refer to just one example. It is a MS. consisting of  but a few fragments executed at Luxeuil under Abbat Gerard II. The  remains are such as to cause regret for the loss of the rest. On one  page Christ is shown seated on a rich _sella_ covered with an  embroidered cushion in the manner of the consular diptychs. He is  clothed in a pale yellow tunic, over which is worn a purple pallium with  a white border. He is beardless, and his brown hair is kept close to the  head and neck, and falls over the shoulders. The feet are nude and by no  means ill-drawn. Surrounding the head is a cruciform nimbus enclosed in  a circle--both cross and circle being pale green, the latter outlined  with red. The chief fault of the head is the excessive length of the  nose and the wide stare of the eyes. The right arm is raised somewhat as  in the St. Sernin Evangeliary, but with the palm outwards, and much  superior in drawing.    The whole figure is painted on, or at least surrounded by, a golden  background--so far indicating the Byzantine origin of the design. It is  enclosed in a cusped aureola formed of several coloured bands of green,  violet, and rose. This shows German taste. Eight circlets or medallions  surround this figure of Christ, four of which contain the symbols of the  evangelists; the other four--Isaiah, Daniel, Ezechiel, and Jeremiah. All  hold portions of the band which connects them, and on which appears a  series of inscriptions in Latin. These consist of passages from the  Vulgate.    The whole picture is placed in a square frame consisting of bands of  various colours and gold outlined in red. The inner ground is chiefly  blue, and the names of the prophets and evangelists are painted on it in  white Roman capitals. Taken altogether it is a very splendid page, but  even this is surpassed in gorgeous richness of ornament by the miniature  of St. Mark. And the borders of other pages in this Luxeuil fragment are  full of ornament, giving the impression that the work was imitated from  that of the goldsmith and enameller. The figures and symbols of the  evangelists in these early Gospel texts are fully explained after St.  Jerome by Alcuin, whose revision of the Vulgate forms the text of the  Durham Book already referred to.    The \"Manual\" shortly to be mentioned differs somewhat in its explanation  of these symbols. The curious combination called the \"Tetra morph\" is a  compound of the four attributes or symbols into a single figure, to  signify that the four evangelists give only one gospel, and ought not to  be separated. It occurs frequently in Greek, but only seldom in Latin or  Western iconography.[23]    [23] On this figure see _Annales Archéologiques_, tom. 8, p. 206, etc.          CHAPTER XVI    ARTISTIC EDUCATION IN THE CLOISTER    The \"Manual\"--Its discovery--Its origin and contents--Didron's  translation--The \"Compendium\" of Theophilus--Its contents--English  version by Hendrie--Benedictine and Cistercian illumination--How they  differ--Character of monastic architects and artists.      About the twelfth century comes forward the mention of a certain manual  minutely detailing every process of painting, and laying down rules for  the due composition and arrangement of every subject to be represented  in the sacred history and other books connected with divine service. How  long such a manual had been in use is unknown, but it is thought that  something of the kind must have existed from the time, at least, of  Justinian, perhaps earlier. The manual here referred to was found by M.  Didron at Sphigmenou, on Mt. Athos. This little monastery is said to  have been founded by the Empress Pulcheria, sister of the Emperor  Theodosius the Younger. She died in the year 453. Theodosius, it may be  remembered, was himself an admirable penman and illuminator, so much so  as to have acquired the cognomen of Kalligráphos.    The monastery is built in a narrow valley by the seaside, between three  little hills, and as it were \"squeezed\" in, and hence its name (in Greek  {~GREEK SMALL LETTER SIGMA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER PHI~}{~GREEK SMALL  LETTER IOTA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER GAMMA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER  MU~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER EPSILON WITH TONOS~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER  NU~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER OMICRON~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER FINAL SIGMA~}),  which describes its situation exactly. It is occupied by about thirty  unusually neat and orderly monks, who are justly proud of the few relics  and curiosities which they exhibit to visitors. It was at Sphigmenou  that Curzon saw the piece of _ancient_ jewellery set with diamonds and a  Russian or Bulgarian MS. of the Gospels.    The book which M. Didron found there is the copy of an older MS. which,  it is said, was copied by Dionysius, one of the monks, from the works of  the once celebrated master, Manuel Panselines of Thessalonica, who was  the Giotto of the Byzantine school and flourished in the twelfth  century. If by works the monk meant literary, it is most likely that it  was the transcript of a still older document. If by works Dionysius  meant paintings, it is a manual of his practice. One of his pupils, in  order to propagate the art of painting which he had learnt at  Thessalonica, writes down the series of subjects to be taken from the  Bible, so as to epitomise the divine scheme of salvation, and describes  the manner in which the events of the Old Testament, and the miracles  and parables of the New, ought to be represented. He mentions the  scrolls and inscriptions (such as we noticed in the Gospels of Luxeuil)  belonging to each of the prophets and evangelists, with the names and  characteristics of the principal saints in the order of the menologium  or martyrology, and then goes on to direct how the subjects should be  arranged on the walls and cupolas of the churches.    The Manual of Dionysius is an abstract of this wide scheme, but is still  very comprehensive. The copy of it seen by Didron was one belonging to a  monk of Sphigmenou named Joasaph, who was himself a painter. It was  \"loaded with notes added by himself and his master, which in course of  time would be incorporated, according to immemorial custom, in the  text.\" In this way, indeed, the Manual has grown to what it is at  present. A transcript of it may probably be found in every monastery  belonging to the Greek Church. Another monk named Macarios, also a  painter, had a fine copy of it laid open in his atelier, and his pupils  read from it in turn, whilst the rest painted according to its  directions. For the scheme itself we must refer the reader to the second  volume of Didron's _Christian Iconography_, p. 193. Unfortunately the  transcriber did not think it of sufficient importance or relevancy to  copy the first part, as being purely technical and dealing merely with  the art of painting. The scheme, therefore, only contains the part  relating expressly to iconography. It is to be regretted, too, that this  part also has been in some places considerably abridged, as "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/19880"],[0,"Voice Production in Singing and Speaking (#16)"],[1,"a certain time; the more numerous the sound-waves  (vibrations) in a second, the higher the pitch.    [Illustration: FIG. 37 (Tyndall). Meant to illustrate vibrations. The  impulse communicated by the ball pushed from the hand to all the  intervening ones causes only the last to actually move bodily.]    Animals differ a good deal as to the limits of hearing. Cats hear very  high-pitched sounds, as of mice, that human beings may not notice, and  it is likely that insects hear sounds altogether beyond the limit of  the human ear. But it is wonderful how much human beings differ among  themselves in regard to this matter. It has surprised the author to  find that many persons cannot hear the high-pitched note of certain  birds, as the wax-wing.    The lower limit, speaking generally, is for most persons 16  vibrations, and the highest 38000 vibrations a second, according to  Helmholtz, hence the entire range of the human ear would be fully 11  octaves; but the practical range of musical sounds is within 40 and  4000 vibrations a second--_i.e._, about 7 octaves--and, as is well  known, even this range is beyond the appreciation of most persons,  though as to this much depends on cultivation--attention to the  subject extending over a considerable period of time.    The _volume_, or loudness, of a sound depends on the size of the  vibrations, just as one feels a blow from a large object, other things  being equal, more than from a small one. The ear drum-head is in the  case of a large sound beaten, as it were, more powerfully. The singers  that give us bigness of sound instead of quality belabor our ears, so  to speak; they treat us as persons of mean understanding--dull  intellects; the thing is essentially vulgar.    The _quality_ of a sound is determined by the form of the vibrations.  A sound of good quality is to the ear what a beautiful statue or  picture is to the eye. As will be explained later, the form or quality  depends largely on the shape, etc., of the resonance-chambers above  the vocal bands.    Much discussion has taken place from time to time as to the nature of  the larynx as a musical instrument, some being inclined to regard it  as most closely allied to a stringed instrument, others to a  wind-instrument. It has obviously points of resemblance to both, but  the most recent researches make it clearer than ever that it is  neither one nor the other, strictly speaking, but that it stands in a  class by itself. It is, however, helpful, in considering many  questions, to bear in mind its resemblances to both wind and stringed  instruments. The vocal bands are not wholly free throughout their  length, like the strings of a violin, nor do they bear any great  resemblance to the reed of such an instrument as the clarinet, but as  in the latter the force causing the vibrations is a blast of air. We  have already pointed out that the vocal bands are set into vibration  solely by the _expiratory_ blast of air.      THE LARYNGOSCOPE.    The distinguished physiologist Johannes Mueller demonstrated the  working of the larynx by special experiments. He fixed into the  windpipe a bellows, and showed, in the dead larynx, of course, that  the blast from this source could cause the vocal bands to vibrate and  thus produce sounds, which by varying the strength of the force, etc.,  were made to vary in pitch.    While such experiments indicate the essential principles of a possible  voice-production, as the conditions in life were not and could not be  fully met these results were rather suggestive than demonstrative of  Nature's methods. These investigations served a good purpose, but  they were manifestly inadequate, and this was felt by one thoughtful  vocal teacher so keenly that he pondered much on the subject, in the  hope of finding a method of observing the larynx during actual  phonation. To this distinguished teacher, Manuel Garcia, belongs the  honor of inventing the means of observing the vocal bands in action.  This was accomplished in 1854, and, soon after, Garcia read an account  of his observations to the Royal Society of London; and though much in  this paper required correction by subsequent observations, it remains  to this day the foundation of our knowledge of the action of the  larynx in voice-production.    [Illustration: FIG. 38 (Bosworth). Intended to illustrate the optical  principles involved and the practical method of carrying out  laryngoscopic examination. The dotted lines show the paths of the  light-rays.]    As usually employed, the laryngoscope consists of two mirrors, the  head-mirror, so called because it is usually attached to the forehead  by an elastic band, and the throat-mirror, which is placed in the back  part of the mouth cavity. The purpose of the head-mirror is to reflect  the light that reaches it from a lamp or other source of illumination  into the mouth cavity so perfectly that not only the back of the  mouth, etc., but the larynx itself may be well lighted up; but  inasmuch as this illumination may be accomplished, under favorable  circumstances, by direct sunlight, the head-mirror is, though mostly  indispensable, not an absolutely essential part of the laryngoscope.  There is, indeed, one advantage in the use of direct sunlight, in that  the color of the parts seen remains more nearly normal. Lamplight  tends, because of its yellow color, to make parts seem rather of a  deeper red than they actually are; but this to the practised observer,  always using the same source of illumination, is not a serious  matter--his standards of comparison remain the same. Moreover, this  objection does not apply equally to electric light, now so much used.    [Illustration: FIG. 39. This illustration is meant to show more  especially the relative position of observer and observed. The  observer, on the right, is wearing the head-mirror, while two  throat-mirrors seem to be in position--in reality, the same mirror in  two different positions. One is placed so as to reflect the picture of  the nasal chambers, especially their hinder portion. The walls of the  nose, etc., may for the purposes of this illustration be considered  transparent, so that the scroll (turbinated) bones, etc., come into  view. The tongue is protruded. The light, not seen in this figure, is  usually placed on the left of the subject, as in Fig. 38.]    It being a fundamental law of light that the angle of reflection and  the angle of incidence correspond--are, in fact, the same--it was  necessary that the throat-mirror should be set at an angle to its  stem, so that the light passing up by reflection from the larynx  should, when striking on the surface of this plane throat-mirror, be  reflected outward in a straight line to the eye, which must be in the  same horizontal plane with it. This and all the other facts and  principles involved can only be understood by a careful inspection of  the accompanying figures, which it is hoped will make the subject  plain. The throat-mirror is none other than the mouth-mirror of the  dentists, and in use by them before Garcia discovered how it might be  employed to throw light on the larynx, in a double sense.    The essentials, then, for a view of the interior of the larynx are: A  source of illumination; a mirror to reflect the light reaching it from  this source into the back of the throat and larynx; and a second  mirror to reflect the light outward which is, in the first instance,  reflected from below, from the interior of the larynx. The principles  involved are few and simple, but their application to any particular  case is not easy, and is sometimes well-nigh impossible.    The throat-mirror should be placed against that curtain suspended in  the back of the mouth cavity known as the soft palate, so that it must  be pushed back out of the line of view. But many persons find such a  foreign object in the throat a sufficient cause of unpleasant  sensations so that retching may be the result. Generally there is a  tendency to raise the tongue behind in a way fatal to a view of the  mirror and the picture reflected from it. These difficulties, however,  can be overcome by a deft hand using the mirror brought to \"blood  heat\" by placing it in warm water or holding it over some source of  heat, as a small lamp, and directing the subject observed to breathe  freely and _through the mouth_. This latter tends to quiet that unruly  member, the tongue, and lead it to assume the flat position so  important to an unobstructed view. It is for the same reason the  author urges mouth breathing during speaking and singing. No other  tends so well to put the tongue in the correct position.    The extent to which one feels the annoyance of a small mirror held  gently in the throat depends really on the amount of attention  directed to it, and the degree of determination with which he resolves  to exercise self-control. The author has examined an entire class of  students of voice-production and found only one person who did not  succeed in at once giving him a view of the larynx. But it must be at  once said that of all persons examined by the author during his  experience as an investigator of voice-production and in special  medical practice, none have been able to show their throats, the  larynx included, so well as speakers and, above all, singers; which in  itself indicates that speaking and singing do give control of the  throat--that all its parts respond to the will of the observed person.  The author must further, however, remark that he has found this  control associated not so much with vocal power as with intelligent  study. Intelligence tells in music a good deal more than many people  have yet learned to believe; but on this point the reader will long  since have learned the author's views--in fact, so deep are his  convictions on this subject that he hopes he may be pardoned for  frequent reference to them, in one form or another.
