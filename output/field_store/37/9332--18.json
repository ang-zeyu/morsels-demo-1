They  must disperse themselves in every land, pass by every clime, and travel  throughout all regions. Bestirred, without rest, and steadfast to the end,  they must raise in every land the triumphal cry 'Ya Baha'u'l-Abha!' (O  Thou the Glory of Glories).... The disciples of Christ forgot themselves  and all earthly things, forsook all their cares and belongings, purged  themselves of self and passion, and with absolute detachment scattered far  and wide and engaged in calling the peoples of the world to the divine  guidance; till at last they made the world another world, illumined the  surface of the earth, and even to their last hour proved self-sacrificing  in the pathway of that beloved One of God. Finally in various lands they  suffered glorious martyrdom. Let them that are men of action follow in  their footsteps!\"    Having grasped the significance of these words, having obtained a clear  understanding of the true character of our mission, the methods to adopt,  the course to pursue, and having attained sufficiently the individual  regeneration--the essential requisite of teaching--let us arise to teach His  Cause with righteousness, conviction, understanding and vigor. Let this be  the paramount and most urgent duty of every Baha'i. Let us make it the  dominating passion of our life. Let us scatter to the uttermost corners of  the earth; sacrifice our personal interests, comforts, tastes and  pleasures; mingle with the divers kindreds and peoples of the world;  familiarize ourselves with their manners, traditions, thoughts and  customs; arouse, stimulate and maintain universal interest in the  Movement, and at the same time endeavor by all the means in our power, by  concentrated and persistent attention, to enlist the unreserved allegiance  and the active support of the more hopeful and receptive among our  hearers. Let us too bear in mind the example which our beloved Master has  clearly set before us. Wise and tactful in His approach, wakeful and  attentive in His early intercourse, broad and liberal in all His public  utterances, cautious and gradual in the unfolding of the essential  verities of the Cause, passionate in His appeal yet sober in argument,  confident in tone, unswerving in conviction, dignified in His manners--such  were the distinguishing features of our Beloved's noble presentation of  the Cause of Baha'u'llah.    If we all choose to tread faithfully His path, surely the day is not far  distant when our beloved Cause will have emerged from the inevitable  obscurity of a young and struggling Faith into the broad daylight of  universal recognition. This is our duty, our first obligation. Therein  lies the secret of the success of the Cause we love so well. Therein lies  the hope, the salvation of mankind. Are we fully conscious of our  responsibilities? Do we realize the urgency, the sacredness, the  immensity, the glory of our task?    I entreat you, dear friends, to continue, nay, to redouble your efforts,  to keep your vision clear, your hopes undimmed, your determination  unshaken, so that the power of God within us may fill the world with all  its glory.    In this fervent plea joins me the Greatest Holy Leaf. Though chagrined in  the evening of her life at the sorrowful tales of repression in Persia,  she still turns with the deepest longings of her heart to your land where  freedom reigns, eager and expectant to behold, ere she is called away, the  signs of the universal triumph of the Cause she loves so dearly.    SHOGHI.    Haifa, Palestine,  November 24th, 1924.          Letter of November 27, 1924.      To my dear friends and fellow-workers, the members of the American  National Spiritual Assembly.    My friends and fellow-workers:--    The letters which our able and devoted friend, Mr. Horace Holley, has  addressed in your behalf to the Greatest Holy Leaf and myself have all  been received, and, together with their enclosures, read with the closest  attention. It is indeed highly gratifying to observe that notwithstanding  the strain and stress of the critical period through which our beloved  Cause is passing, the elected representatives of the friends in America  have, with unflinching faith, undaunted courage, and conspicuous ability,  persevered in their task and fulfilled their arduous duties.    The splendid contribution you have made to the efforts of your  fellow-workers in England in connection with the Conference on the Living  Religions within the British Empire, we all heartily appreciate and regard  as a fresh evidence of the growing power and solidarity of the Cause of  God. Both in the admirable paper which you arranged to be drafted and  prepared, and in the person of your devout, trusted and talented  President, who performed his duty with absolute fidelity and high  distinction, you have rendered the Cause of Baha'u'llah a fresh and  distinguished service. May the results achieved lend a fresh impetus to  the onward march of the Cause in the West.    The recent measures you have adopted in view of the necessity of promoting  fuller confidence and a greater measure of understanding and cooperation  between the body of the believers and the local and National Assemblies,  will, I am confident, be of the greatest value, and indicate clearly that  you are fully aware of the true position, the privileges and  responsibilities of every Baha'i Assembly.          Mashriqu'l-Adhkar      We all long to hasten by wise and effective measures the completion of the  Ma_sh_riqu'l-A_dh_kar, and we fervently supplicate the All-Bountiful to  bless richly our teaching work that our numbers may be reinforced in time  by men who with sufficient means at their disposal may voluntarily and  abundantly support this vast and noble endeavor. I trust that you will  encounter no further obstacles in receiving the necessary support to meet  the immediate needs of this Universal House of Worship as decided at your  recent general gathering in Chicago.          Baha'i Magazine      The Star of the West, the latest issues of which I have read with genuine  satisfaction, has admittedly made a notable advance towards the ideal  which the Master has set before it. Articles on broad humanitarian lines,  well-conceived, adequately treated, and powerfully presented, should have  their proper place in every issue together with such accounts of the  history and the teachings of the Cause as will portray to the Baha'i and  non-Baha'i alike the unique beauty as well as the compelling power of the  Baha'i spirit. Matters political and partisan in character should be  carefully avoided as they would eventually lead to entanglements that  would be not only futile but positively harmful. As regards the Persian  Section: I feel that in view of the severe restrictions imposed on the  friends in Persia its temporary suspension would be well-advised,  particularly as it makes such a disproportionate demand on the meagre  resources of the friends in America.    The increasing efforts displayed by my beloved brothers and sisters in  America, both individually and collectively, and the action taken by you  in constituting regional Teaching Committees are of vital importance to  the spread of the Cause in the present stage of our work. I feel that we  should all collaborate in widening its scope, intensifying its influence,  assuring its continuity, and endeavoring to subordinate every other  activity to this most urgent and vital task. It is our bounden duty to do  all in our power to give the Cause from day to day a fuller publicity, to  maintain and stimulate the interest aroused, and to concentrate at the  same time our attention on a chosen few, endeavoring tactfully and  persistently to make of them earnest and unreserved supporters of the  Baha'i Faith.    I am deeply conscious of the manifold and unavoidable difficulties that  confront you in your labors for the administration of the affairs of the  Cause. Vast distances; personal professional preoccupations; insufficient  number of capable and experienced teachers, unhampered by the necessity of  earning their means of livelihood; the inadequacy of the means at your  disposal, financial and otherwise; the prevailing tendencies in the  general thought, sentiment, and manners of the people in whose midst you  work--all these, though insuperable obstacles at present, will, if we stand  steadfast and faithful, be one by one removed, and pave the way for the  ultimate ascendency of the Cause and the fruition and triumph of our  labors.    As to the projected prayer-book, I feel the need for a specially prepared  compilation of the prayers of Baha'u'llah and 'Abdu'l-Baha designed for  the general public which would both prove of value for devotional purposes  and act as a fresh incentive to eager and inspiring minds. I am enclosing  copies of prayers which you may have not yet received and trust to send  you more in future. I should be glad to receive any particulars you might  wish me to consider in this connection.    Our untiring and devoted sister, Dr. Moody (the handmaid of the Most  High), has had to her profound regret to discontinue for a time the  invaluable and unique services she has been rendering to the Cause in  Persia. She is proceeding to America, and will familiarize you with the  deplorable state of affairs in that unhappy country. You will get  first-hand information from her regarding the present condition and  activities of our long-suffering friends in Persia, and she will take  counsel with you as to the best way to meet the needs and serve the Cause  of Education in Tihran. I hope and pray that as soon as circumstances  permit, the friends in America may enable Dr. Moody to take back with her  to Persia suitable, capable and ardent collaborators who will contribute "]]]
