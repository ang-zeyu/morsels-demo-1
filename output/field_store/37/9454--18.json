The potash lye must contain carbonates, which help to give transparency  to the resultant soap. If the lye is somewhat deficient in carbonates,  they may be added in the form of a solution of refined pearl ash  (potassium carbonate).    Caustic soda lye is sometimes admixed, to the extent of one-fourth, with  potash lye to keep the soap firmer during hot weather, but it requires  great care, as a slight excess of soda gives soft soap a bad appearance  and a tendency to separate.    The process is commenced by running fatty matter and weak potash lyes  into the pan or copper, and boiling together, whilst the introduction of  oil and potash lye is continued.    The saponification commences when an emulsion forms, and the lye is then  run in more quickly to prevent the mass thickening.    Having added sufficient \"strength\" for complete saponification, the  boiling is continued until the soap becomes clear.    The condition of the soap is judged by observing the behaviour of a  small sample taken from the pan and dropped on glass or iron. If the  soap is satisfactory it will set firm, have a short texture and slightly  opaque edge, and be quite clear when held towards the light. If the  cooled sample draws out in threads, there is an excess of water present.  If an opaque edge appears and vanishes, the soap requires more lye. If  the sample is turbid and somewhat white, the soap is too alkaline and  needs more oil.    The glycerine liberated during saponification is contained in the soap  and no doubt plays a part in the production of transparency.    _Hydrated soaps_, both smooth and marbled, are included in this  classification, but are _soda_ soaps. Soap made from cocoa-nut oil and  palm-kernel oil will admit of the incorporation of large quantities of a  solution of either salt, carbonate of soda, or silicate of soda, without  separation, and will retain its firmness. These materials are,  therefore, particularly adapted for the manufacture of marine soaps,  which often contain as much as 80 per cent. of water, and, being soluble  in brine, are capable of use in sea-water. For the same reason,  cocoa-nut oil enters largely into the constitution of hydrated soaps,  but the desired yield or grade of soap allows of a variation in the  choice of materials. Whilst marine soap, for example, is usually made  from cocoa-nut oil or palm-kernel oil only, a charge of 2/3 cocoa-nut  oil and 1/3 tallow, or even 2/3 tallow and 1/3 cocoa-nut oil, will  produce a paste which can carry the solutions of silicate, carbonate,  and salt without separation, and yield a smooth, firm soap.    The fatty materials, carefully strained and freed from particles of dirt  and fibre, are boiled with weak caustic soda lye until combination has  taken place. Saponification being complete, the solution of salt is  added, then the carbonate of soda solution, and finally the silicate of  soda solution, after which the soap is boiled. When thoroughly mixed,  steam is shut off, and the soap is ready for framing.    The marbled hydrated soap is made from cocoa-nut oil or a mixture of  palm-kernel oil and cocoa-nut oil with the aid of caustic soda lye  32-1/2 deg. Tw. (20 deg. B.). As soon as saponification is complete, the brine  and carbonate of soda solution are added, and the pan allowed to rest.    The soap is then carefully tasted as to its suitability for marbling by  taking samples and mixing with the colouring solution (ultramarine mixed  with water or silicate of soda solution). If the sample becomes blue  throughout, the soap is too alkaline; if the colour is precipitated, the  soap is deficient in alkali. The right point has been reached when the  marbling is distributed evenly. Having thus ascertained the condition of  the pan, and corrected it if necessary, the colour, mixed in water or in  silicate of soda solution, is added and the soap framed.    (D) _Treatment of Fat with Indefinite Amount of Alkali and Separation of  Waste Lye._--This is the most general method of soap-making. The various  operations are:--              (_a_) Pasting or saponification.            (_b_) Graining out or separation.            (_c_) Boiling on strength.    And in the case of milling soap base and household soaps,              (_d_) Fitting.    (_a_) _Pasting or Saponification._--The melted fats and oils are  introduced into the soap-pan and boiled by means of open steam with a  caustic soda lye 14 deg. to 23.5 deg. Tw. (10 deg. to 15 deg. B.). Whether the fatty  matters and alkali are run into the pan simultaneously or separately is  immaterial, provided the alkali is not added in sufficient excess to  retard the union.    The commencement of the saponification is denoted by the formation of an  emulsion. Sometimes it is difficult to start the saponification; the  presence of soap will often assist this by emulsifying the fat and thus  bringing it into intimate contact with the caustic soda solution.    When the action has started, caustic soda lye of a greater density, 29 deg.  to 33 deg. Tw. (18 deg. to 20 deg. B.), is frequently added, with continued boiling,  in small quantities as long as it is being absorbed, which is  ascertained by taking out samples from time to time and examining them.    There should be no greasiness in the sample, but when pressed between  finger and thumb it must be firm and dry.    Boiling is continued until the faint caustic taste on applying the  cooled sample to the tongue is permanent, when it is ready for \"graining  out\". The pasty mass now consists of the soda salts of the fat (as  imperfect soap, probably containing emulsified diglycerides and  monoglycerides), together with water, in which is dissolved the  glycerine formed by the union of the liberated glyceryl radicle from the  fat with the hydroxyl radicle of the caustic soda, and any slight excess  of caustic soda and carbonates. The object of the next operation is to  separate this water (spent lye) from the soap.    (_b_) _Graining Out or Separation._--This is brought about by the use of  common salt, in a dry form or in solution as brine, or by caustic soda  lye. Whilst the soap is boiling, the salt is spread uniformly over its  surface, or brine 40 deg. Tw. (24 deg. B.) is run in, and the whole well boiled  together. The soap must be thoroughly boiled after each addition of  salt, and care taken that too large a quantity is not added at once.    As the soap is gradually thrown out of solution, it loses its smooth  transparent appearance, and becomes opaque and granular.    When a sample, taken out on a wooden trowel, consists of distinct grains  of soap and a liquid portion, which will easily separate, sufficient  salt or brine has been added; the boiling is stopped and the spent lye  allowed to settle out, whilst the soap remains on the surface as a more  or less thick mass.    The separated spent lye consists of a solution of common salt,  glycerine, and alkaline salts; the preparation of crude glycerine  therefrom is considered in chapter ix.    The degree of separation of water (spent lye) depends upon the amount of  precipitant used. The aim is to obtain a maximum amount of spent lye  separated by the use of a minimum quantity of salt.    The amount of salt required for \"graining out\" varies with the raw  material used. A tallow soap is the most easily grained, more salt is  required for cotton-seed oil soap, whereas soaps made from cocoa-nut and  palm-kernel oils require very large amounts of salt to grain out  thoroughly. Owing to the solubility in weak brine of these latter soaps,  it is preferable to grain them with caustic soda lye. This is effected  by adding, during boiling, sufficient caustic lye (32-1/2 deg. Tw., 20 deg. B.)  to produce the separation of the granules of soap. The whole is allowed  to rest; the separated half-spent lye is withdrawn and may be used for  the pasting of fresh materials.    After the removal of the settled lye, the grained mass is boiled with  sufficient water to dissolve the grain and make it smooth (\"close\" it),  and is now ready for the next operation of \"boiling on strength\".    (_c_) _Boiling on Strength or Clear Boiling._--This is the most  important operation and is often termed \"making the soap\". The object is  to harden the soap and to ensure complete saponification.    Caustic soda lye (32-1/2 deg. Tw., 20 deg. B.) is gradually added until the soap  is again opened or grained, and boiling continued by the use of the dry  steam coil. As soon as the caustic soda lye is absorbed, another portion  is slowly added, and this is continued until the caustic soda or  \"strength\" remains permanent and the soapy mass, refusing to absorb  more, is thrown out of solution and grained. The granular mass will boil  steadily, and the boiling should be prolonged, as the last traces of  neutral oil are difficult to completely saturate with alkali. Thorough  saponification takes place gradually, and the operation cannot be  hurried; special care has to be bestowed upon this operation to effect  the complete combination of fat and alkali.    After resting for several hours, half-spent lye settles to the bottom of  the pan. In the case of yellow soaps or milling bases the settled lye is  removed to a suitable receptacle and reserved for use in the  saponification of other material, and the soap is then ready for the  final operation of \"fitting\".    (_d_) _Fitting._--If the operations just described have been properly  performed, the fitting should present no difficulty. The soap is boiled  with open steam, and water added until the desired degree of closing is  attained. As the water is thoroughly intermixed throughout the mass the  thick paste gradually becomes reduced to a smooth, thin consistence.  Samples are tested from time to time as to their behaviour in dropping  off a hot trowel held sideways; the thin layer should drop off in two or  three flakes and leave the surface of the trowel clean and "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/21728"],[0,"The Dog Crusoe and his Master (#16)"],[1,"ffected, it was  found that no serious damage had been done to life or limb!        CHAPTER NINE.    CRUSOE ACTS A CONSPICUOUS AND HUMANE PART--A FRIEND GAINED--A GREAT  FEAST.    When the foot-race was concluded, the three hunters hung about, looking  on at the various games for some time, and then strolled towards the  lake.    \"Ye may be thankful yer neck's whole,\" said Joe, grinning, as Henri  rubbed his shoulder with a rueful look.  \"An' we'll have to send that  Injun and his family a knife and some beads to make up for the fright  they got.\"    \"Hah! an' fat is to be give to me for my broke shoulder?\"    \"Credit, man, credit,\" said Dick Varley, laughing.    \"Credit! fat is dat?\"    \"Honour and glory, lad, and the praises of them savages.\"    \"Ha! de praise? more probeebale de ill-vill of de rascale.  I seed dem  scowl at me not ver' pritty.\"    \"That's true, Henri, but sich as it is it's all ye'll git.\"    \"I vish,\" remarked Henri after a pause--\"I vish I could git de vampum  belt de leetle chief had on.  It vas superb.  Fat place do vampums come  from?\"    \"They're shells--\"    \"Oui,\" interrupted Henri.  \"I know _fat_ de is.  Dey is shells, and de  Injuns tink dem goot monish; mais, I ask you _fat place_ de come from.\"    \"They are thought to be gathered on the shores o' the Pacific,\" said  Joe; \"the Injuns on the west o' the Rocky Mountains picks them up and  exchanges them wi' the fellows here-away for horses and skins--so I'm  told.\"    At this moment there was a wild cry of terror heard a short distance  ahead of them.  Rushing forward they observed an Indian woman flying  frantically down the river's bank towards the waterfall, a hundred yards  above which an object was seen struggling in the water.    \"'Tis her child,\" cried Joe, as the mother's frantic cry reached his  ear.  \"It'll be over the fall in a minute!  Run, Dick, you're quickest.\"    They had all started forward at speed, but Dick and Crusoe were far  ahead, and abreast of the spot in a few seconds.    \"Save it, pup,\" cried Dick, pointing to the child, which had been caught  in an eddy, and was for a few moments hovering on the edge of the stream  that rushed impetuously towards the fall.    The noble Newfoundland did not require to be told what to do.  It seems  a natural instinct in this sagacious species of dog to save man or beast  that chances to be struggling in the water, and many are the authentic  stories related of Newfoundland dogs saving life in cases of shipwreck.  Indeed, they are regularly trained to the work in some countries, and  nobly, fearlessly, disinterestedly, do they discharge their trust, often  in the midst of appalling dangers.  Crusoe sprang from the bank with  such impetus that his broad chest ploughed up the water like the bow of  a boat, and the energetic workings of his muscles were indicated by the  force of each successive propulsion as he shot ahead.    In a few seconds he reached the child and caught it by the hair.  Then  he turned to swim back, but the stream had got hold of him.  Bravely he  struggled, and lifted the child breast-high out of the water in his  powerful efforts to stem the current.  In vain.  Each moment he was  carried inch by inch down until he was on the brink of the fall, which,  though not high, was a large body of water and fell with a heavy roar.  He raised himself high out of the stream with the vigour of his last  struggle, and then fell back into the abyss.    By this time the poor mother was in a canoe as close to the fall as she  could with safety approach, and the little bark danced like a  cockle-shell on the turmoil of waters as she stood with uplifted paddle  and staring eyeballs awaiting the rising of the child.    Crusoe came up almost instantly, but _alone_, for the dash over the fall  had wrenched the child from his teeth.  He raised himself high up and  looked anxiously round for a moment.  Then he caught sight of a little  hand raised above the boiling flood.  In one moment he had the child  again by the hair, and, just as the prow of the Indian woman's canoe  touched the shore, he brought the child to land.    Springing towards him, the mother snatched her child from the flood and  gazed at its death-like face with eyeballs starting from their sockets;  then she laid her cheek on its cold breast and stood like a statue of  despair.  There was one slight pulsation of the heart and a gentle  motion of the hand!  The child still lived.  Opening up her blanket she  laid her little one against her naked, warm bosom, drew the covering  close around it, and, sitting down on the bank, wept aloud for joy.    \"Come,--come 'way quick,\" cried Henri, hurrying off to hide the emotion  which he could not crush down.    \"Ay, she don't need our help now,\" said Joe, following his comrade.    As for Crusoe, he walked along by his master's side with his usual  quiet, serene look of good-will towards all mankind.  Doubtless a  feeling of gladness at having saved a human life filled his shaggy  breast, for he wagged his tail gently, after each shake of his dripping  sides, but his meek eyes were downcast, save when raised to receive the  welcome and unusually fervent caress.  Crusoe did not know that those  three men loved him as though he had been a brother.    On their way back to the village the hunters were met by a little boy,  who said that a council was to be held immediately, and their presence  was requested.    The council was held in the tent of the principal chief, towards which  all the other chiefs and many of the noted braves hurried.  Like all  Indian councils, it was preceded by smoking the \"medicine pipe,\" and was  followed by speeches from several of the best orators.  The substance of  the discourse differed little from what has been already related in  reference to the treaty between the Pale-faces, and upon the whole it  was satisfactory.  But Joe Blunt could not fail to notice that Mahtawa  maintained sullen silence during the whole course of the meeting.    He observed, also, that there was a considerable change in the tone of  the meeting when he informed them that he was bound on a similar errand  of peace to several of the other tribes, especially to one or two tribes  which were the Pawnees' bitter enemies at that time.  These grasping  savages having quite made up their minds that they were to obtain the  entire contents of the two bales of goods, were much mortified on  hearing that part was to go to other Indian tribes.  Some of them even  hinted that this would not be allowed, and Joe feared at one time that  things were going to take an unfavourable turn.  The hair of his scalp,  as he afterwards said, \"began to lift a little and feel oneasy.\"  But  San-it-sa-rish stood honestly to his word; said that it would be well  that the Pale-faces and the Pawnees should be brothers, and hoped that  they would not forget the promise of annual presents from the hand of  the great chief who lived in the big village near the rising sun.    Having settled this matter amicably, Joe distributed among the Indians  the proportion of his goods designed for them, and then they all  adjourned to another tent where a great feast was prepared for them.    \"Are ye hungry?\" inquired Joe of Dick as they walked along.    \"Ay, that am I.  I feel as if I could eat a buffalo alive.  Why, it's my  'pinion we've tasted nothin' since daybreak this mornin'.\"    \"Well, I've often told ye that them Red-skins think it a disgrace to  give in eatin' till all that's set before them at a feast is bolted.  We'll ha' to stretch oursel's, we will.\"    \"I'se got a plenty room,\" remarked Henri.    \"Ye have, but ye'll wish ye had more in a little.\"    \"Bien, I not care!\"    In a quarter of an hour all the guests invited to this great _medicine_  feast were assembled.  No women were admitted.  They never are at Indian  feasts.    We may remark in passing, that the word \"medicine,\" as used among the  North American Indians, has a very much wider signification than it has  with us.  It is an almost inexplicable word.  When asked, they cannot  give a full or satisfactory explanation of it themselves.  In the  general, we may say that whatever is mysterious is \"medicine.\"  Jugglery  and conjuring, of a noisy, mysterious, and, we must add, rather silly  nature, is \"medicine,\" and the juggler is a \"medicine-man.\"  These  medicine-men undertake cures, but they are regular charlatans, and know  nothing whatever of the diseases they pretend to cure, or their  remedies.  They carry bags containing sundry relics; these are \"medicine  bags.\"  Every brave has his own private medicine bag.  Everything that  is incomprehensible, or supposed to be supernatural, religious, or  medical, is \"medicine.\"  This feast, being an unusual one, in honour of  strangers, and in connection with a peculiar and unexpected event, was  \"medicine.\"  Even Crusoe, since his gallant conduct in saving the Indian  child, was \"medicine\"; and Dick Varley's double-barrelled rifle, which  had been an object of wonder ever since his arrival at the village, was  tremendous \"medicine!\"    Of course the Indians were arrayed in their best; several wore necklaces  of the claws of the grizzly bear, of which they are extremely proud; and  a gaudily picturesque group they were.  The chief, however, had  undergone a transformation that well-nigh upset the gravity of our  hunters, and rendered Dick's efforts to look solemn quite abortive.  San-it-sa-rish had once been to the trading forts of the Pale-faces, and  while there had received the customary gift of a blue surtout with brass  buttons, and an ordinary hat, such as gentlemen wear at home.  As the  coat was a good deal too small for him, a terrible length of dark, bony  wrist appeared below the cuffs.  The waist was too high, and it was with  great difficulty that he managed to button the garment across his broad  chest.  Being ignorant of the nature of a hat, the worthy savage had  allowed"]]]
