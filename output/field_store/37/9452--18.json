The earl who founded the cathedral died after a  pilgrimage to Rome and Jerusalem. \"He had begun his High Church on no  mean scale, and it was afterwards greatly enlarged in length. To this  circumstance, together with its severe simplicity, its narrowness, its  height, and the multiplicity of its parts, must be ascribed the most  striking characteristic of the pile--its apparent vastness.\"[209] It has  been doubted if either York or Lincoln gives the _idea_ of greater  internal length, though Kirkwall measures less by half than the smaller  of these minsters. As pointed out by the latest authorities on the  cathedral, its western doorways recall the portals of the cathedrals of  France rather than those of England; its interior gives the impression  of great size, arising from the height and length of the building as  compared with its width; the exterior presents at a glance the changes  which have taken place in it, and the layers and masses of different  coloured stones tell their own tale; the oldest work (comprising several  periods) is constructed with dark slaty stone, having red freestone  dressings; the Norman work is observed in the transept and several bays  of the nave and choir nearest the transept, while the pointed work is  specially noticeable in the eastern half of the choir.[210] The first  parts of the cathedral built were the three westmost or Norman bays of  the choir, with their aisles, both the transepts, the crossing  (afterwards altered) intended to receive a tower over it, and two bays  of the nave, which served to form an abutment for the crossing. These  portions, where unaltered, are said to be in the earliest style of  Norman work in the edifice. The round piers and responds of the choir,  the two south piers and one north pier of the nave (with their cushion  caps), the main arches (with their label mouldings in the choir and  transept), the round arched and labelled windows in choir, transept, and  nave, and the interlaced arcades in the nave, all point to a somewhat  advanced period of Norman work. The choir originally terminated with a  central apse beyond the third pier. The Norman windows of the choir  aisle have three external orders, with a label ornament in the outer  order; the single shafts have cushion caps; the windows are largely  splayed internally.[211] An interlacing arcade of round arches, with  single shafts and cushion caps (some with volutes) runs round the north,  south, and west sides of the transept. The large arches leading into the  east chapels are part of the original structure, but the chapels were  built later. The lower string-course of the transept is enriched with a  four-leaved flower.[212]    After the completion of these portions, attention was given to the  continuation of the nave westwards for several bays. The north aisle  wall opposite the three bays, west from the crossing, would appear to  have been built early.[213] The buttresses are of flat Norman form. The  north aisle doorway is pronounced to be Norman in detail, but has been  restored at a later date; the south aisle doorway retains its old Norman  arch and shafts in the interior, but has been altered externally. The  nave piers were probably continued as far as the above doors about this  time, with the triforium, but the upper part of the nave walls and the  vaulting are later.[214] The transition style is prominently seen in the  piers and arches of the crossing, and the windows in the choir nearest  the main arches of the crossing, and the triforium openings into the  transept, appear to have been altered and rebuilt at the time of this  operation. The upper part of the north transept was probably raised and  its windows inserted at this time; the raising of the south transept and  the introduction of the rose windows is of somewhat later date.[215]  This circular window is very similar to that in the east window of the  choir. The chapels on the east side of the transept are of the advanced  transition period, which, in Orkney, was probably the middle of the  thirteenth century.[216] The completion of the nave would be next  undertaken.[217] The apse was taken down, and the choir, with its  aisles, was extended by three bays eastwards,[218] the style having a  resemblance to advanced First Pointed work, with some peculiarities of  detail, exhibiting probable French influence from Upsala.[219] The  triforium consists of plain, chamfered, semicircular arches and jambs in  three orders; the clerestory has simple pointed windows, moulded on  sconsion, but without cusps. A vaulting shaft is carried up between the  piers.[220] The east end of the cathedral is of First Pointed period,  and the great east window fills the whole space available.[221] The  three western doorways and the pointed doorway in the south transept are  later than the choir;[222] they present the finest examples in Great  Britain of the use of coloured stones in the construction.[223] The  north doorway and the central doorway of the west front have the colours  arranged in concentric rings in the arches, red and yellow alternating.  In the south doorway the same colours radiate and alternate, and in the  doorway of the south transept the red and yellow stones are arranged  chequerwise.[224] They are among the most charming portions of the  edifice, and are unique in Scotland. The upper part of the gablet over  the centre doorway is of the seventeenth century, and bears the shield  of Sir George Hay of Kinfauns, who rented the lands of the bishopric  about the beginning of the seventeenth century, the crozier being added  to the shield in connection with the lands of the see.[225] The tower  has been considerably operated upon in modern times; the old wooden  spire was destroyed by lightning in 1671. The parapet and pinnacles are  modern, as also the pointed and slated roof--the lower part being of  considerable age. The part within the roof of the church is apparently  of transition date; the upper part, with the large pointed windows, is  probably of fifteenth-century work.[226] There were originally beautiful  specimens of wood-work; the canopy over the bishop's throne has  disappeared.[227] The tower contains four bells, three of which were  given by Bishop Maxwell (1526-1540). The cathedral does not appear to  have suffered during the Reformation period, but an attempt made by the  Earl of Caithness to destroy it in 1606, during the rebellion of Earl  Patrick Stewart and his son, was prevented by the intervention of Bishop  Law (sacred be his memory!).    The bishop's palace was founded about the beginning of the thirteenth  century. Twenty bishops held the see in succession. The diocese  contained the archdeaconries of Orkney, with thirty-five parishes, and  of Tingwall (Shetland) with thirteen. The church suffered from vandalism  in 1701 and 1855, and the east end is used as the parish church. May the  northern minster soon be restored and made worthy of its glorious past.  Lord Tennyson's son's diary contains the following entry on the  Cathedral of St. Magnus: \"Gladstone and my father admired the noble  simplicity of the church, and its massive stone pillars, but we all  shuddered at the liberal whitewash and the high pews.\"[228]    A catalogue of the Bishops of Orkney, by Professor Munch of Christiania,  will be found in the _Bannatyne Miscellany_.[229]          CHAPTER IV    SCOTTISH COLLEGIATE CHURCHES      The creation of collegiate churches was a practical endeavour toward  ecclesiastical reform in the fifteenth century, when the foundation of  monastic establishments ceased. They had no parishes attached to them,  and were regulated very much as the cathedrals. They arose with the  purpose of counteracting the evils incidental to the monastic system,  and were formed by grouping the clergy of neighbouring parishes into a  college, or by consolidating independent chaplainries. They were called  praepositurae, were presided over by a dean or provost, and the  prebendaries were generally the clergy holding adjacent cures. In  Scotland, during more recent times, the term \"collegiate\" was applied to  a church where two ministers (as at St. Cuthbert's, Edinburgh) served  the cure as colleagues, but in the fifteenth century the term had a  different and wider significance. Collegiate churches were then an  expression of the zeal and munificence that were displayed in the  enlargement and decoration of buildings, when all classes vied with each  other in the endowment of chaplainries for the maintenance of daily  stated service, always including prayers and singing of masses for the  souls of their founders, their relations, and benefactors. The  collegiate churches were also an evidence from within the Church itself  of the need for reform in the great Benedictine and Augustinian abbeys  that were then in the ascendant throughout the country.    Scotland possessed forty-one collegiate churches, but space will only  permit us here to deal with nine of them: Biggar, Bothwell, St. Nicholas  (Aberdeen), King's College (Aberdeen), Roslin, Stirling (Chapel Royal),  St. Giles (Edinburgh), St. Mary's and St. Salvator's (St. Andrews).    _Biggar (Lanarkshire)._--The collegiate parish church of St. Mary was  founded in 1545 by Malcolm, third Lord Fleming, for a provost,"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/21692"],[0,"The Pirate City: An Algerine Tale (#16)"],[1,"thither.    The sun had just set, and the warders were about to close the gates for  the night, when the desperadoes, bursting suddenly round the corner of a  neighbouring lane, bounded in perfect silence through the archway.    The sentinel on duty was for a few moments bereft of the power of  action.  Recovering himself, he discharged his musket, and gave the  alarm.  The whole guard turned out at once and gave chase, but the few  moments lost by them had been well used by the fugitives; besides,  Despair, Terror, and Hope are powerful stimulators.  After running a  short time together up the steep ascent of the Frais Vallon, or Fresh  Valley, they scattered, according to arrangement, and each man shifted  for himself--with the single exception of Mariano, who would not leave  his father.    Seeing this, the Turks also scattered, but in this condition they began  to waver--all the more that the short twilight of those regions was  rapidly deepening into night.  They reflected that the guarding of their  gate was a prior duty to the hunting down of runaway slaves, and, one by  one, dropped off, each supposing that the others would, no doubt, go on,  so that the officer of the guard soon found himself alone with only one  of his men.    Having observed that two of the fugitives kept together, these Turks  resolved to keep them in view.  This was not difficult, for they were  both young and active, while Francisco was middle-aged and rather heavy.    \"Stay a moment, boy,\" cried the bluff padrone, as they tolled up the  rather steep ascent of the valley.    Mariano stopped.    \"Come on, father; they are overhauling us.\"    \"I know it, boy,\" said Francisco, taking Mariano by the shoulders and  kissing his forehead.  \"Go thou; run!  It is all over with me.  God  bless thee, my son.\"    \"Father,\" said the youth impressively, grasping a mass of timber which  he had wrenched from a shop front in passing, \"if you love me, keep  moving on, I will stop these two, or--Farewell!\"    Without waiting for a reply, the youth rushed impetuously down the hill,  and was soon engaged in combat with the two Turks.    \"Foolish boy!\" muttered Francisco, hastening after him.    Mariano made short work of the soldier, hitting him such a blow on the  turban that he fell as if he had been struck by a sledge-hammer.  Unfortunately the blow also split up the piece of timber, and broke it  short off at his hands.  He was therefore at the mercy of the young  officer, who, seeing the approach of Francisco, rushed swiftly at his  foe, whirling a keen scimitar over his head.    Mariano's great activity enabled him to avoid the first cut, and he was  about to make a desperate attempt to close, when a large stone whizzed  past his ear and hit his adversary full on the chest, sending him over  on his back.    \"Well aimed, father!\" exclaimed Mariano, as the two turned and continued  the ascent of the valley.    At its head Frais Vallon narrows into a rugged gorge, and is finally  lost in the summit of the hills lying to the northward of Algiers.  Here  the panting pair arrived in half-an-hour, and here they found that all  their comrades had arrived before them.    \"Friends,\" said Castello, who was tacitly regarded as the leader of the  party, \"we have got thus far in safety, thank God!  We must now make  haste to Pointe Pescade.  It lies about three or four miles along the  shore.  There a negro friend of mine has a boat in readiness.  He told  me of it only an hour before I spoke to you to-night.  If we reach it  and get off to sea, we may escape; if not, we can but die!  Follow me.\"    Without waiting for a reply, Castello ran swiftly along a foot-path that  crossed over the hills, and soon led his party down towards that wild  and rocky part of the coast on which stand the ruins of a fort, said to  have been the stronghold of the famous pirate Barbarossa in days of old.        CHAPTER ELEVEN.    IS DIPLOMATIC AND OTHERWISE.    Just after the escape of the slaves, as already narrated, the British  consul demanded a private audience of the Dey.  His request was granted,  and one morning early he set off on horseback to the city.  Arriving  there too soon, he put up his horse, and, threading his way through the  streets of the old town, soon found himself in front of the small and  unpretending, though massive, portal of Bacri the Jew.    He found the master of the house seated in the central court, or skiffa,  drinking coffee with his wife and children.    \"Bacri,\" said the Colonel, \"may I venture to interrupt your present  agreeable occupation?  I wish to have a talk with you in private.\"    \"With pleasure,\" replied the Jew, rising and ushering his visitor into a  small apartment, the peculiar arrangement and contents of which  betokened it the wealthy merchant's study or office,--indeed, it might  have been styled either with equal propriety, for Bacri, besides being  an able man of business, was learned in Arabic literature--of which the  town possessed, and still possesses, a valuable library,--and was a  diligent student of the Hebrew Scriptures.    \"You are aware,\" said the Colonel, \"that I am, at your request, about to  use my influence with the Dey in behalf of certain friends of yours.  Now, there is an old saying--and I have great respect for many old  sayings,--that `one good turn deserves another.'  May I, then, ask you  to do me a favour?\"    \"Certainly,\" said the Jew.  \"Name it.\"    \"You must know, then, that the Dey has been pleased to send me a pretty  Portuguese girl as a slave, along with her infant child.\"    \"I know it,\" said Bacri.    \"You do?  Well, this poor girl turns out to be a very sweet creature,  and my wife, although somewhat annoyed at first by the unexpected gift,  and puzzled what to do with her, is now so fond of her, and finds her so  gentle as well as useful, that she has set her heart on having Paulina  Ruffini--that is her name--freed and sent home.  This, however, is not  the point.  Paulina has a sister named--\"    \"Angela Diego,\" interrupted the Jew.    \"Oh! you know that too?\" said the Colonel, with some surprise.  \"You  seem to know everything that goes on in this curious city!  Indeed, it  is a belief in this general knowledge of yours that brings me here.  Well, poor Paulina is naturally in great anxiety about her sister's  fate, not having heard of her since the day they were cruelly separated  by Sidi Hassan.  The latter is now my janissary, and tells me that he  sold Angela to a Jew in the public market, and does not know where she  is.  Believing that you can find this out for me, I have come hither  this morning on my way to the palace.  Do you think you can?\"    \"I think I can,\" said the Jew, opening a door and beckoning to some one  without.  \"Come hither, Angela.  A gentleman wishes to see you.\"    \"What! is this Paulina's sister?\" said the consul in surprise, as a  pretty bright-eyed girl obeyed the summons.    \"Speak, fair one,\" said the Jew.  \"Dost know of one Paulina Ruffini, and  her infant Angelina?\"    We need scarcely add that Angela admitted, with a look of surprise, that  she did, and was overwhelmed with joy on finding that her sister was a  happy inmate of the consul's villa, and that in a short time she would  be permitted to see her.    Leaving the Jew's house, well satisfied with his unlooked-for success in  this matter, the consul proceeded to the palace, and was at once  admitted into the audience-chamber.    According to custom, the Dey was seated on a sort of throne, with the  huge lion-pup serving as a footstool.  We have said before that this  lion had a decided antipathy to the British consul.  Not being able to  speak, it could not give the reason why!  Perhaps, although unable to  speak, it might have been able to understand what was said, and,  possibly, had taken offence at the straightforward manner in which the  consul had more than once remonstrated with the Dey for allowing so old  a pup to be at large.  Be this as it may, certain it is that, on the  present occasion, the lion raised its head when the consul was  announced.  On seeing his hated scarlet uniform, it uttered a savage  growl, sprang up, and ran out of the room by another door, with its tail  between its legs.  In springing up, the brute had forgotten its  temporary character of footstool.  The result was that the Dey was  tilted violently backwards, and fell off his throne in a confused and  most undignified heap!    Fortunately for the lion--perchance also for the consul--Achmet  possessed too much native dignity and common-sense to allow such an  accident to ruffle his temper.  He rose and resumed his seat with a  hearty laugh, as he said--    \"You see, Monsieur le Consul, that even lions are afraid of the English  uniform!\"    \"Your highness is pleased to be complimentary,\" replied the consul, with  a bow; \"and that emboldens me to observe that a Dey should not retain  the services of one who is capable of showing fear.\"    \"Perhaps you are right,\" returned Achmet, with a smile; \"especially one  who has had the audacity to dethrone me.--And now, what demand have you  to make of me to-day?  Not, I trust, that old one--the liberation of  slaves!\"    \"No, not exactly that,\" replied the consul.  \"Nevertheless,\" he added  earnestly, \"I do come to make an appeal in behalf of slaves.\"    The Dey's countenance became grave.    \"I refer,\" continued the consul, \"to those unfortunate slaves who  recently attempted to escape, and are now lying in chains condemned to  be bastinadoed, thrown on the hooks, and otherwise tortured to death.\"    \"How!\" exclaimed the Dey, frowning darkly, while a flush of anger  covered his face, \"can you plead for slaves who have not only rebelled  and fled, but who have disabled two of my janissaries, and some of  whom--especially their leader Castello and the young Sicilian Mariano--  are so turbulent as to be an absolute nuisance to their guards?\"    \"Your highness is aware,\""]]]
