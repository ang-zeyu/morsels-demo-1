Ltd. Photo._]    The two most western triforium arches in the presbytery are glazed, the  roof of the triforium itself being wholly removed. The object of this  alteration has been fully explained in the account of the exterior of  the cathedral. On the ground beneath were the shrines; and under one of  the arches was erected, not long afterwards, the monument of Bishop  Barnet, in whose time and at whose expense the alteration was made.    The arrangement of the lancets at the east end is even more effective  within than without. The east end of Ely, says Professor Freeman, \"is  the grandest example of the grouping of lancets.... Ely is also  undoubtedly the head of all east ends and eastern limbs of that class in  which the main body of the church is of the same height throughout, and  in which the aisles are brought out to the full length of the  building.\"[7]    It will hardly be believed that the magnificent stalls which were  formerly ranged in the octagon, and at a later period in the presbytery,  were once painted all over with a mahogany colour. They are the finest  Decorated stalls in England, the beautiful ones at Winchester being of  late thirteenth-century date. The carved panels in the upper parts are  new, and are the gifts of individual donors. They were executed in  Belgium. It is not known how these spaces were originally filled; Mr. le  Strange thought possibly with heraldic devices. The designs on the south  are from the New Testament, those on the north from the Old Testament  The seats in the lower range are also modern, as are the various  statuettes at the Stall ends, which represent the builders of the most  important parts of the fabric. On the misereres of the ancient stalls  are some wonderful grotesque carvings. The brass eagle lectern has been  copied, as to its main features, from an ancient example at Isleham. The  organ is in the triforium, on the north, and part of the case projects  over the easternmost arch of the choir.    The reredos is the first example in modern cathedral work of the  elaborate style of decoration for the most holy part of the sanctuary,  which is now not uncommon. It was the gift of Mr. John Dunn Gardner, of  Chatteris, and was designed by Scott. It forms the central portion of a  screen of stone which extends for the whole width of the presbytery. The  lower part of the whole is of deeply cut diaper-work; the upper part has  an open arcade of six arches, each with a mullion and tracery in the  early Decorated style. The reredos itself is of alabaster, and consists  of five main arches under canopies, and with tracery, and is ornamented  with a rich abundance of mosaic work, panels, medallions, statuettes,  twisted columns, and various kinds of carving. Five scenes from the last  days of our Lord's life on earth are carved in relief under canopies  beneath the chief arches. A full description, giving all the details of  the sculpture, and the materials of the mosaic, and the different  persons and emblematic graces represented by the busts and figures,  would require more space than we can give. The altar cross, of silver  gilt, is in memory of Bishop Woodford.    [Illustration: THE REREDOS.                _Photochrom Co. Ltd. Photo._]    [Illustration: THE LADY-CHAPEL.                _Photochrom Co. Ltd. Photo._]    #The Lady-chapel.#--Notwithstanding the cruel mutilation of the  sculpture all round this chapel, it can be seen that for perfection of  exquisite work there is no building of the size in this country worthy  for one moment to be compared with this in its unmutilated state. Its  single defect strikes the beholder at once: the span of the roof is too  broad and the vaulting too depressed for the size of the chapel. The  windows, of which those on the north have been restored, have already  been described. The end windows, which are of great size, are of later  date; that to the east has a look of Transition work about it. The  building was finished in 1349, and the east window was inserted by  Bishop Barnet, _circa_ 1373. For a possible explanation of the insertion  of this window, only a quarter of a century after the completion of the  chapel, see _ante_, p. 52. It is not thought probable that the original  designers left anything incomplete. The great beauty of the interior  consists in the series of tabernacle work and canopies that runs round  all the four sides below and between the windows. The heads of the  canopies project. In the tracery beneath, at the head of the mullion,  was a statue. The delicate carving of the cusps and other tracery is  varied throughout. On the spandrels were incidents connected with the  history of the Virgin Mary (mainly legendary) and of Julian the  Apostate; and though in no single instance is a perfect uninjured  specimen left, yet enough remains, in all but a few cases, for the  original subjects to be identified.[8] All was once enriched with  colour, and many traces remain; and in various parts of the windows  there are fragments of stained glass. Most of the monumental tablets  which once disfigured the arcade below the windows have been happily  removed into the vestibule. The arches and canopies at the east end are  arranged differently from those on the sides. In the roof, which reminds  us of the contemporary roof in the choir, are some carved bosses, not  large, but singularly good. Among the subjects can be recognised a  Crucifixion, with half-figures beside the cross; Adam and Eve; the  Virgin Mary and Elizabeth, holding between them a book inscribed  \"Magnificat\"; the Annunciation, with \"Ave Maria Gracia plena\"; the  Ascension, indicated by the skirt and feet of the Saviour and five heads  of apostles; the coronation of the Virgin; and the Virgin in an aureole.    [Illustration: DOORWAY OF THE LADY-CHAPEL.                _Rev. T. Perkins Photo._]    The arrangements for worship present an appearance very unlike those of  sixty years ago. A writer in 1876, writing of his early recollections,  says: \"When I first knew Ely the state of the lady-chapel--then, as now,  used as a parish church--was so miserable from decay, violence, and  neglect, that it was simply painful to enter it.\" ... Now,  \"well-designed benches have replaced the mean deal square pews, the  whitewash and yellow-wash which thickly clogged the carving has been  removed, the windows have been repaired and made water-tight, and the  altar and its adjuncts made to assume an air of reverent dignity.\"    We do not remember to have anywhere seen an explanation of the fact that  this chapel is now used as the parish church of Holy Trinity parish;  whereas the old church, the destruction of which occasioned the  appropriation of the lady-chapel to parochial use, was dedicated to S.  Cross.    #Monuments And Stained Glass#--It is convenient to treat the  monuments as a separate subject, so as not to break the continuity of  the architectural description. We will commence at the west, proceeding  along the north aisle, and so round the cathedral, pointing out those  that have anything of special interest.    Against the blocked doorway which gave access to the church of S. Cross  is placed an altar-tomb to the late Bishop Woodford (see below, p. 129).  The figure of the bishop is vested in cope and mitre, and has a pastoral  staff. The Crucifixion is on the wall at the back. There are several  shields of arms relating to the bishop's career or to the cathedral  history: among these are those of the Merchant Taylors' Company, at  whose school he was educated; Pembroke College, Cambridge, of which he  was a member; and of other colleges at Cambridge founded by bishops of  Ely. Three tablets in this north aisle, near the transept, record  donations towards the re-paving of the nave and aisles in 1676, 1869,  and 1873.    There is no monumental memorial in the nave. But the large slab of  marble in the centre, just in front of the position of the old  rood-loft, which has been already referred to as traditionally marking  the grave of Alan de Walsingham, should be noticed.    Under the four arches of the presbytery on the north, between the stalls  and the altar, are monuments of great importance. First we see that of  Bishop Redman (d. 1505), a very fine specimen of enriched Perpendicular  work. The mitred figure of the bishop is on an altar-tomb beneath a  richly groined roof, and a space is left at the feet, where a priest  might stand to pray for the soul of the deceased prelate.[9] There are  grand canopies on the sides, with crockets and coloured shields bearing  emblems of the Crucifixion, the arms of the See of Ely and of S. Asaph,  where Bishop Redman was at first; but the arms of the See of Exeter,  from which diocese he came to Ely, as now used, are not to be seen.  Above the roof is fine open screen-work, and against the adjoining  piers, east and west, are large canopied niches.    Next to this is the effigy of Bishop Kilkenny (d. 1256), a fine example  of Early English. The figure has cope, mitre, and staff. The bishop's  heart only was buried here.    [Illustration: THE NORTH CHOIR AISLE.]    In the next arch is a large Decorated structure of two stories, believed  by Scott to have been built by Walsingham as the base for the shrine of  S. Etheldreda. It was formerly known as Bishop Hotham's shrine, and his  effigy was placed beneath it. The lower story is open.    In the arch north of the altar is the tomb of the builder of the  presbytery, Bishop Northwold (d. 1254). He is represented in full  vestments. At the east of the tomb is a curious"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/21007"],[0,"The Bird Study Book (#16)"],[1,"well in white with a whole nest  of sparkling, scintillating birds in her hair which it would have  puzzled an ornithologist to classify,\" and again: \"Mrs. Robert Smith  had her gown of unrelieved black looped up with black birds; and a  winged creature, so dusky that it could have been intended for nothing  but a Crow, reposed among the curls and braids of her hair.\"    Ah, those were the halcyon days of the feather trade!  Now and then a  voice cried out at the slaughter, or hands were raised at the sight of  the horrible shambles, but there were no laws to prevent the killing  nor was there any strong public sentiment to demand its cessation,  while on the other hand more riches yet lay in store for the hunter and  the merchant.  There were no laws whatever to protect these birds, nor  was there for a time any man of force to start a crusade against the  evil.    _The Story of the Egrets._--The most shameless blot on the history of  America's treatment of the {149} wild birds is in connection with the  White Egrets.  It is from the backs of these birds that the \"aigrettes\"  come, so often seen on the hats of the fashionable.  Years ago, as a  boy in Florida, I first had an opportunity to observe the methods  employed by the feather hunters in collecting these aigrettes which are  the nuptial plumes of the bird and are to be found on birds only in the  spring.  As a rare treat I was permitted to accept the invitation  extended by a squirrel hunter to accompany him to the nesting haunts of  a colony of these birds.  Away we went in the gray dawn of a summer  morning through the pine barrens of southern Florida until the heavy  swamps of Horse Hammock were reached.  I remember following with  intense interest the description given by my companion of how these  birds with magnificent snowy plumage would come flying in over the dark  forest high in air and then volplane to the little pond where, in the  heavily massed bushes, their nests were thickly clustered.  With vivid  distinctness he imitated the cackling notes of the {150} old birds as  they settled on their nests, and the shrill cries of the little ones,  as on unsteady legs they reached upward for their food.    Keen indeed was the disappointment that awaited me.  With great care we  approached the spot and with caution worked our way to the very edge of  the pond.  For many minutes we waited, but no life was visible about  the buttonwood bushes which held the nests--no old birds like fragments  of fleecy clouds came floating in over the dark canopy of cypress  trees.  My companion, wise in the ways of hunters, as well as the  habits of birds, suspected something wrong and presently found nearby  the body of an Egret lying on the ground, its back, from which the skin  bearing the fatal aigrettes had been torn, raw and bloody.  A little  farther along we came to the remains of a second and then a third, and  still farther on, a fourth.  As we approached, we were warned of the  proximity of each ghastly spectacle by the hideous buzzing of green  flies swarming over the lifeless forms of the parent birds.    {151}    At one place, beneath a small palmetto bush, we found the body of an  Egret which the hunters had overlooked.  Falling to the ground sorely  wounded, it had escaped its enemies by crawling to this hiding-place.  Its appearance showed the suffering which it had endured.  The ground  was bare where in its death agonies it had beaten the earth with its  wings.  The feathers on the head and neck were raised and the bill was  buried among the blood-clotted feathers of its breast.  On the higher  ground we discovered some straw and the embers of a campfire, giving  evidence of the recent presence of the plume hunters.  Examination of  the nests over the pond revealed numerous young, many of which were now  past suffering; others, however, were still alive and were faintly  calling for food which the dead parents could never bring.  Later  inquiry developed the fact that the plumes taken from the backs of  these parent birds were shipped to one of the large millinery houses in  New York, where in due time they were placed on the market as  \"aigrettes,\" and of course {152} subsequently purchased and worn by  fashionable women, as well as by young and old women of moderate  incomes, who sacrifice much for this millinery luxury.    There were at that time to be found in Florida many hundreds of  colonies of these beautiful birds, but their feathers commanded a large  price and offered a most tempting inducement for local hunters to shoot  them.  Many of the men of the region were poor, and the rich harvest  which awaited them was very inviting.  At that time gunners received  from seventy-five cents to one dollar and a quarter for the \"scalp\" of  each bird, which ordinarily contained forty or more plume feathers.  These birds were not confined to Florida, but in the breeding season  were to be found in swampy regions of the Atlantic Coast as far north  as New Jersey, some being discovered carrying sticks for their nests on  Long Island.    Civilized nations to-day decry any method of warfare which results in  the killing of women and children, but the story of the aigrette trade  deals with the slaughter of innocents by the slow process of {153}  starvation, a method which history shows has never been followed by  even the most savage race of men dealing with their most hated enemies.  This war of extermination which was carried forward unchecked for years  could mean but one thing, namely, the rapid disappearance of the Egrets  in the United States.  As nesting birds, they have disappeared from New  Jersey, Maryland, and Virginia, and also those States of the central  Mississippi Valley where they were at one time to be found in great  numbers.    _Amateur Feather Hunters._--Quite aside from the professional millinery  feather hunter there should be mentioned the criminal slaughter of  birds which has been indulged in by individuals who have killed them  for the uses of their own lady friends.  I know one Brown Pelican  colony which was visited by a tourist who shot four hundred of the big,  harmless, inoffensive creatures in order to get a small strip of skin  on either side of the body.  He explained to his boatmen, who did the  skinning for him, that he was curious to see if these strips of skin  with their feathers would not {154} make an interesting coat for his  wife.  The birds killed were all caring for their young in the nests at  the time he and his hirelings shot them.    There was a few years ago, in a Georgia city, an attorney who accepted  the aigrette \"scalps\" of twenty-seven Egrets from a client who was  unable to pay cash for a small service rendered.  He told me he had  much pleasure in distributing these among his lady friends.  Another  man went about the neighbourhood hunting male Baltimore Orioles until  he had shot twelve, as he wanted his sisters to have six each for their  Sunday hats.  The Roseate Spoonbill of the Southern States was never  extensively killed for the millinery trade, and yet to-day it is  rapidly approaching extinction.  The feathers begin to fade in a short  time and for this reason have little commercial value, but the amateur  Northern tourist feather hunter has not known this, or disregarded the  fact, and has been the cause of the depletion of the species in the  United States.  Almost every one could cite instances similar to the  above, for there are many people in the {155} United States who are  guilty of taking part in the destruction of birds for millinery  purposes.  In addition to the feathers of American birds already  mentioned the feathers of certain foreign species have been very much  in demand.    _Paradise Plumes_--One of the most popular foreign feathers brought to  this country is the Paradise.  There are at least nine species of  Paradise Birds found in New Guinea and surrounding regions that furnish  this product.  The males are adorned with long, curved delicate  feathers which are gorgeously coloured.  As in the case of all other  wild birds there is no way of getting the feathers except by killing  the owners.  Much of this is done by natives who shoot them down with  little arrows blown through long hollow reeds.  The high price paid for  these feathers has been the occasion of the almost total extinction of  some of the species, as indicated by the decreased number of feathers  offered at the famous annual London Feather Sales.  Travellers in the  regions inhabited by the birds speak of the {156} distressing effect of  the continuous calls of the bereft females as they fly about in the  forests during the mating season.  As a high-priced adornment the  Paradise is the one rival of the famous aigrette.    _Maribou._--The Maribou which has been fashionable for a number of  years past comes principally from the Maribou Stork of Africa.  These  white, fluffy, downlike feathers grow on the lower underpart of the  body of the Maribou Stork.  These birds are found in the more open  parts of the country.  Their food consists of such small forms of life  as may readily be found in the savannas and marshes.  To some extent  they also feed like vultures on the remains of larger animals.    _Pheasants._--The long tail feathers of Pheasants have been much in  demand by the millinery trade during the past ten years.  Although  several species contribute to the supply, the majority are from the  Chinese Pheasant, or a similar hybrid descendent known as the English  Ring-necked Pheasant.  Many of these feathers have been collected in  Europe, {157} where the birds are extensively reared and shot on great  game preserves; vast numbers, however, have come from China.  Oddly  enough in that country the birds were originally little disturbed by  the natives, who seem not to care for meat.  Then came the demand for  feathers, and the birds have since been killed for this purpose to an"]]]
