It is sufficient to compare the present window with others in  the Cathedral, not excluding the productions of Mr. Wailes himself, to  shew the great advance which the art of glass-painting has recently  made, both in the richness of the colours employed and their  arrangement--the improvement arising, doubtless, from a more accurate  study of the great masters of the middle ages.    The figures and groups in the three noble lancets are executed with  great spirit; and although numerous, are arranged, more especially in  the central window, in masses which the eye can readily follow, and by  occupying so large a portion of the entire surface, leave little room  for the monotonous repetitions of foliage or other patterns; the  distribution of colour is also thus sufficiently varied without its  masses in one part of the window unduly preponderating over those in  another, a condition which is never grossly violated without serious  injury to just architectural effect.    In the central window of the clerestory range, the spaces between the  medallions and the border are filled with a diapered ground, which,  though rich in colour, is somewhat formal in effect; whilst the field  in the side windows, within the border, is too narrow to allow the  figures to be sufficiently separated and relieved from the rest of the  ground. It arises, probably, from these or other causes that the  general effect which the upper lancets produce, though otherwise good,  is by no means so rich and sparkling as that of the lower windows.         The subjects of the three lower lights are illustrative of       the history of our blessed Lord; commencing at the bottom of       the south lancet--where is represented a figure of Jesse,       from whose body issues a genealogical tree--and continuing       in ascending order, through a series of nine medallions,       following in the same manner through a similar number in       the north lancet, and five others in the central lancet;       alternately with these five are quatrefoils containing       representation of types from the Old Testament of the events       of the Passion represented in the other medallions; and in       the segmental spaces round these quatrefoils are represented       eighteen other incidents of the last days of the Saviour. In       the segmental spaces in the south lancet the figures of the       kings are disposed in pairs; and in the north lancet these       spaces are filled with the figures of Moses, Elias, and the       prophets; and at the bottom a kneeling figure of the donor.       The five upper windows, two on the north and two on the       south, contain figures of the apostles; at the top of the       central window our Lord is represented as sitting in glory,       beneath which are depicted four incidents which occurred       after the Crucifixion.    The floor of the Choir has been re-laid with marble combined with  Minton's encaustic tiles, and a large marble slab has been placed over  the grave of Bishop Hotham, inlaid with brass and bearing the arms of  the see and those of the bishop, surrounded by an inscription. At the  foot of this another has been laid over the grave of Prior Crauden,  superior of the monastery at the time of the erection of the Octagon;  this is the original gravestone of the prior, but it had been removed  with several others to another part of the church; the brass insertion  has been renewed, shewing a kneeling figure with a large foliated  cross issuing from his bosom, with the initials I.C. on either side,  and surrounded by an inscription.    In the wide treading of one of the steps at the end of the stalled  choir are placed the arms of some of the benefactors to the  restoration of the Cathedral;[44] executed by Messrs. Minton. In the  Presbytery, where the absence of stall-work allows space for more  elaborate design, it will be seen much care and skill has been used,  and the effect produced is very good. The communion table is raised  five steps above the level of the floor, each step being laid in  mosaic and encaustic tiles of beautiful and varied patterns, used in  conjunction with veined, and faced with black, marble.    [Footnote 44: In the centre are the arms of the Duke of Bedford; on  the south side those of Alexander Beresford Hope, Esq., and the Rev.  T. Halford; on the north those of J. Dunn Gardner, Esq., and J.C.  Sharpe, Esq.]    The new reredos or altar screen is remarkable for its chaste but  elaborate design and richness of detail, as well as skill in  execution; and is not, perhaps, surpassed by any modern work of the  kind; our limited space will not allow us to attempt anything like an  adequate description of this beautiful work, but we will endeavour  briefly to point out the prominent features, and recommend to the  visitor a careful examination of its various details.    It comprises a centre with wings, having openings with geometrical  tracery and foliated mouldings, surmounted by an elegant cresting. The  front of the central portion is of the most beautiful design, executed  in alabaster, enriched with colour and gilding, and will doubtless  claim the first attention of the visitor. The sides of the space  occupied by the altar is covered with diaper work exhibiting a series  of roses, apparently connected together by their stems running through  the pattern under the bars of the diaper-work; above this, the whole  width is divided into five compartments--the centre one being wider  than the others--separated by enriched columns, around which are  spiral belts with cornelians and blood-stones on a gold ground, and  having elegant foliated capitals, copied from natural objects; on  these capitals stand a series of angels bearing instruments of the  passion--cross, crown of thorns, nails, spear, &c., and each having  under his feet a dragon or other reptile, typical of the triumph over  Satan by the Sacrifice of the Atonement. The lower part of each  compartment is occupied by quatrefoils ornamented with ball-flowers,  and filled in with mosaic work of _verd antique_, _rosso antico_,  _gialo antico_, and _lapis lazuli_: above these are panels containing  alto-relievo sculptures of great excellence, the subjects taken from  the life of the Saviour; beginning on the north side, we find Christ's  entry into Jerusalem, Christ washing His disciples' feet, the  Institution of the Sacrament, Christ's agony in the Garden, and Christ  bearing His cross: another series of spiral pillars stand in the front  and on the sides of these panels with capitals similar to those  already mentioned. These pillars have their spiral course in the  opposite direction to the former, which adds to the general beauty of  the whole. Above the sculptured panels, each of the four side  compartments is surmounted by two small gables with their outer  mouldings foliated, crowned with a finial, and finished at the bottom  by a grotesque figure of a dragon or other animal; the inner face of  each gable contains within a circle a head in bas-relief, those on the  north side representing the major prophets, Isaiah, Jeremiah, Ezekiel,  and Daniel; those on the south represent four doctors of the church,  Jerome, Ambrose, Augustine, and Gregory; the other portions being  filled in with mosaic work. The centre compartment has three  projecting canopies, the faces of which are enriched with mosaic, the  angles are crocketed, and finished at the bottom with roses and  grotesque figures. Above the centre canopy, on a lofty enriched  pinnacle, stands a figure of our Lord; on the north side, on a lower  pinnacle, stands a figure of Moses; and on the south side a figure of  Elias, the three being typical of the Transfiguration.    The upper portion of the white stone screen behind the alabaster work  is also divided into five compartments of open work with geometrical  tracery; in front rise five gables, the centre being larger and higher  than the others. The outer mouldings of the centre gable are enriched  with foliated crocketing with which is intermixed the early church  symbol--pelican feeding her young--and the apex surmounted by a figure  of our Lord enthroned: the inner portion of the gable contains, in a  trefoil, a basso-relievo of the Annunciation, in alabaster. The four  side compartments are also surmounted by gables, on the top of which  stand respectively the figures of the four Evangelists, in alabaster,  their respective emblems being worked in the crockets; on the inner  faces of the gables, within trefoils, are busts in relief, those on  the north side represent Mary Magdelene and Mary the mother of James;  those on the south, St. John the Baptist and St. John the divine; the  remaining space in each gable being filled in with mosaic. Outside and  between these gables rise spiral pillars, on the tops of which are  placed figures of the virtues, Faith, Hope, and Charity, on the north  side; and of the graces, Justice, Prudence, and Fortitude, on the  south side, executed in alabaster.    The wings also are of white stone, and not so high as the centre; in  each are three openings with geometrical tracery; and below these  openings the wall is covered with diaper-work of an elegant pattern.    The portion of this screen, which forms the reredos, is the munificent  gift of John Dunn Gardner, Esq., of Chatteris, in this county, and  designed as a memorial to his first wife. The work took upwards of  five years to execute, and cost about L4000. Some of the more  important of the sculptures, mosaics, and other decorations, were  suggested by the donor, and the whole was designed by Sir G.G. Scott,  and affords a magnificent example of his skill and taste. The  stone-work, including the architectural carving, was executed by Mr.  Rattee and his successors, at Cambridge; the sculptures by Mr. Philip;  the mosaics"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/20925"],[0,"History of the United States, Volume 1 (#16)"],[1," oppose this, and Clarendon favored it, a motive of both  here, as with Connecticut, being to rear in New England a power friendly  to the Crown, that should rival and check Massachusetts. Both these  commonwealths were granted absolute independence in all but name. No  oath of allegiance to the king was demanded. Appeals to England were not  provided for.    [1680]    Though having no quarrel with the king, the two southern colonies were  not without their trials. Connecticut, besides continual fear of the  Dutch and the Indians, was much agitated by the controversy over the  question whether children of moral parents not church members should be  baptized, a question at length settled affirmatively by the so-called  Half-Way Covenant. It also had its boundary disputes with Massachusetts,  with Rhode Island--for Connecticut took the Narragansett River of its  charter to be the bay of that name--and with New York, which, by the  Duke of York's new patent, issued on the recovery of that province from  the Dutch in 1674, reached the Connecticut River. During England's war  with Holland, 1672-74, all the colonies stood in some fear of Dutch  attacks.    [1685]    Rhode Island had worse troubles than Connecticut. It, too, had boundary  disputes, serious and perpetual; but graver by much were its internal  feuds, caused partly by the mutual jealousy of its four towns, partly by  the numerous and jarring religious persuasions here represented.  Government was painfully feeble. Only with utmost difficulty could the  necessary taxes be raised. Warwick in particular was for some time in  arrears to John Clark, of Newport, for his invaluable services in  securing the charter of 1663. Quakers and the divers sorts of Baptists  valiantly warred each against other, using, with dreadful address, those  most deadly of carnal weapons, tongue and pen. On George Fox's visit to  the colony, Roger Williams, zealous for a debate, pursued the eminent  Quaker from Providence to Newport, rowing thither in his canoe and  arriving at midnight, only to find that his intended opponent had  departed, The latter's champion was ready, however, and a discussion of  four days ensued.    [Illustration: Sir Edmond Andros]    Before its sentence of death reached Massachusetts Charles II. was no  more, and James II., his brother, had ascended the throne. It was for a  time uncertain what sort of authority the stricken colony would be  called to accept. Already, as Duke of York, James II. had been  Proprietary of Maine east of the Kennebec (Sagadahoc), as well as of  Delaware, New Jersey, and New York. Now that he had the problem of  ruling Massachusetts to solve, it naturally occurred to the king to make  Sir Edmond Andros, already governor of New York, master also over the  whole of English America from the Saint Croix to the Delaware.    In southern New England the reign of Andros wrought no downright  persecution. He suspended the charters, and, with an irresponsible  council in each colony, assumed all legislative as well as  administrative power. Rhode Island submitted tamely. Her sister colony  did the same, save that, at Hartford, according to good tradition, in  the midst of the altercation about delivering the charter, prolonged  into candle-light, suddenly it was dark, and the precious document  disappeared to a secure place in the hollow trunk of an oak. This tree,  henceforth called the Charter Oak, stood till prostrated by a gale on  August 20, 1856.    [Illustration: The Charter Oak at Hartford.]    But in Massachusetts the colonists' worst fears were realized. Andros,  with a council of his own creation, made laws, levied taxes, and  controlled the militia. He had authority to suppress all  printing-presses and to encourage Episcopacy. In the latter interest he  opened King's Chapel to the Prayer Book. His permission was required for  any one to leave the colony. Extortionate fees and taxes were imposed.  Puritans had to swear on the Bible, which they regarded wicked, or be  disfranchised. Personal and proprietary rights were summarily set at  naught, and all deeds to land were declared void till renewed--for  money, of course. The citizens were reduced to a condition hardly short  of slavery.    [1688]    There is no describing the joy which pervaded New England as the news of  the Revolution of 1688 flew from colony to colony. Andros slunk away  from Boston, glad to escape alive. Drums beat and gala-day was kept. Old  magistrates were reinstated. Town meetings were resumed. All believed  that God had interposed, in answer to prayer, to bring deliverance to  his people from popery and thraldom.    This revolution, ushering in the liberal monarchy of William and Mary,  restored to Rhode Island and Connecticut their old charter governments  in full. New Hampshire, after a momentary union with Massachusetts  again, became once more a royal province. As to Massachusetts itself, a  large party of the citizens now either did not wish the old state of  things renewed, or were too timid to agree in demanding back their  charter as of right. Had they been bold and united, they might have  succeeded in this without any opposition from the Crown. Instead, a new  charter was conferred, creating Massachusetts also a royal province, yet  with government more liberal than the other provinces of this order  enjoyed. The governor was appointed by the Crown, and could convene,  adjourn, or dissolve the Legislature. With the consent of his council he  also created the judges, from whose highest sentence appeal could be  taken to the Privy Council. The governor could veto legislation, and the  king annul any law under three years old.    [1690-1697]    If in these things the new polity was inferior to the old, in two  respects it was superior; Suffrage was now practically universal, and  every species of religious profession, save Catholicism, made legal.  Also, Massachusetts territory was enlarged southward to take in all  Plymouth, eastward to embrace Maine (Sagadahoc) and Nova Scotia. Maine,  henceforth including Sagadahoc, that is, all land eastward to the Saint  Croix, remained part of Massachusetts till March 15, 1820, when it  became a member of the Union by itself. Nova Scotia, over which Phips's  conquest of Port Royal in 1690 had established a nominal rather than a  real English authority, was assigned to France again by the Treaty of  Ryswick, 1697.    [Illustration: Box in which the Connecticut Charter was kept.]        CHAPTER II.    KING PHILIP'S WAR    [1675]    Simultaneously with the Stuart Restoration another cloud darkened the  New England sky. Since the Pequot War, Indians and whites had in the  main been friendly. This by itself is proof that our fathers were less  unjust to the red men than is sometimes charged. They did assume the  right to acquire lands here, and they had this right. The Indians were  not in any proper sense owners of New England. They were few--by 1660  not more numerous than the pale-faces--and, far from settling or  occupying the land, roamed from place to place. Had it been otherwise  they, as barbarians, would have had no such claim upon the territory as  to justify them in barring out civilization. However, the colonists did  not plead this consideration. Whenever districts were desired to which  Indians had any obvious title, it was both law and custom to pay them  their price. In this, Roger Williams and William Penn were not peculiar.  If individual white men sometimes cheated in land trades, as in other  negotiations, the aggrieved side could not, and did not, regard this as  the white man's policy.    Yet little by little the Indians came to distrust and hate the rival  race. It did not matter to the son of the forest, even if he thought so  far, that the neighborhood of civilization greatly bettered his lot in  many things, as, for instance, giving him market for corn and peltry,  which he could exchange for fire-arms, blankets, and all sorts of  valuable conveniences. The efforts to teach and elevate him he  appreciated still less. As has been said, he loved better to disfurnish  the outside of other people's heads than to furnish the inside of his  own. What he felt, and keenly, was that the newcomers treated him as an  inferior, were day by day narrowing his range, and slowly but surely  reducing his condition to that of a subject people. Dull as he was, he  saw that one of three fates confronted him: to perish, to migrate, or to  lay aside his savage character and mode of life. Such thoughts frenzied  him.    The beautiful fidelity of Massasoit to the people of Plymouth is already  familiar. His son Alexander, who succeeded him, was of a spirit  diametrically the reverse. Convinced that he was plotting with the  Narragansets for hostile action, the Governor and Council of Plymouth  sent Major Winslow to bring him to court--for it must be remembered that  Massasoit's tribe, the Pokanokets, had through him covenanted, though  probably with no clear idea of what this meant, to be subject to the  Plymouth government. Alexander, for some reason, became fatally ill  while at Plymouth under arrest, dying before reaching home. The Indians  suspected poison.    His brother Philip now became sachem. Philip already had a grudge  against the whites, and was rendered trebly bitter by the indignity and  violence, if nothing worse, to which Alexander had been subjected. He  resolved upon war, and in 1675 war was begun.    We shall never certainly know to what extent Philip was an organizer. We  believe correct the view of Hubbard, the contemporary historian, that he  had prepared a wide-spread and pretty well arranged conspiracy among  the main tribes of New England Indians, which might have been fatal but  for \"the special providence of God,\" causing hostilities to break out  ere the savages were ready. Palfrey challenges this view of the case,  but on insufficient grounds.    One Sausaman, an educated"]]]
