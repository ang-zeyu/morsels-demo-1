Have not the Asiatic churches of Jerusalem, of  Antioch and of Alexandria, consisting chiefly of those Jewish converts,  whose character and temperament inclined them to sympathize with the  traditional ceremonies of the Mosaic Dispensation, been forced as they  steadily declined to recognize the growing ascendancy of their Greek and  Roman brethren? Have they not been compelled to acknowledge the superior  valor and the trained efficiency which have enabled these standard-bearers  of the Cause of Jesus Christ to erect the symbols of His world-wide  dominion on the ruins of a collapsing Empire? Has not the animating spirit  of Islam been constrained, under the pressure of similar circumstances, to  abandon the inhospitable wastes of its Arabian Home, the theatre of its  greatest sufferings and exploits, to yield in a distant land the fairest  fruit of its slowly maturing civilization?    \"From the beginning of time until the present day,\" 'Abdu'l-Baha Himself  affirms, \"the light of Divine Revelation hath risen in the East and shed  its radiance upon the West. The illumination thus shed hath, however,  acquired in the West an extraordinary brilliancy. Consider the Faith  proclaimed by Jesus. Though it first appeared in the East, yet not until  its light had been shed upon the West did the full measure of its  potentialities become manifest.\" \"The day is approaching,\" He, in another  passage, assures us, \"when ye shall witness how, through the splendor of  the Faith of Baha'u'llah, the West will have replaced the East, radiating  the light of Divine Guidance.\" \"In the books of the Prophets,\" He again  asserts, \"certain glad-tidings are recorded which are absolutely true and  free from doubt. The East hath ever been the dawning-place of the Sun of  Truth. In the East all the Prophets of God have appeared ...The West hath  acquired illumination from the East but in some respects the reflection of  the light hath been greater in the Occident. This is specially true of  Christianity. Jesus Christ appeared in Palestine and His teachings were  founded in that country. Although the doors of the Kingdom were first  opened in that land and the bestowals of God were spread broadcast from  its center, the people of the West have embraced and promulgated  Christianity more fully than the people of the East.\"    Little wonder that from the same unerring pen there should have flowed,  after 'Abdu'l-Baha's memorable visit to the West, these often-quoted  words, the significance of which it would be impossible for me to  overrate: \"The continent of America,\" He announced in a Tablet unveiling  His Divine Plan to the believers residing in the North-Eastern States of  the American Republic, \"is in the eyes of the one true God the land  wherein the splendors of His light shall be revealed, where the mysteries  of His Faith shall be unveiled, where the righteous will abide and the  free assemble.\" \"May this American democracy,\" He Himself, while in  America, was heard to remark, \"be the first nation to establish the  foundation of international agreement. May it be the first nation to  proclaim the unity of mankind. May it be the first to unfurl the standard  of the 'Most Great Peace'... The American people are indeed worthy of  being the first to build the tabernacle of the great peace and proclaim  the oneness of mankind... May America become the distributing center of  spiritual enlightenment and all the world receive this heavenly blessing.  For America has developed powers and capacities greater and more wonderful  than other nations... May the inhabitants of this country become like  angels of heaven with faces turned continually toward God. May all of them  become servants of the omnipotent One. May they rise from their present  material attainments to such a height that heavenly illumination may  stream from this center to all the peoples of the world... This American  nation is equipped and empowered to accomplish that which will adorn the  pages of history, to become the envy of the world and be blest in both the  East and the West for the triumph of its people... The American continent  gives signs and evidences of very great advancement. Its future is even  more promising, for its influence and illumination are far-reaching. It  will lead all nations spiritually.\"    Would it seem extravagant, in the light of so sublime an utterance, to  expect that in the midst of so enviable a region of the earth and out of  the agony and wreckage of an unprecedented crisis there should burst forth  a spiritual renaissance which, as it propagates itself through the  instrumentality of the American believers, will rehabilitate the fortunes  of a decadent age? It was 'Abdu'l-Baha Himself, His most intimate  associates testify, Who, on more than one occasion, intimated that the  establishment of His Father's Faith in the North American continent ranked  as the most outstanding among the threefold aims which, as He conceived  it, constituted the principal objective of His ministry. It was He Who, in  the heyday of His life and almost immediately after His Father's  ascension, conceived the idea of inaugurating His mission by enlisting the  inhabitants of so promising a country under the banner of Baha'u'llah. He  it was Who in His unerring wisdom and out of the abundance of His heart  chose to bestow on His favored disciples, to the very last day of His  life, the tokens of His unfailing solicitude and to overwhelm them with  the marks of His special favor. It was He Who, in His declining years, as  soon as delivered from the shackles of a long and cruel incarceration,  decided to visit the land which had remained for so many years the object  of His infinite care and love. It was He Who, through the power of His  presence and the charm of His utterance, infused into the entire body of  His followers those sentiments and principles which could alone sustain  them amidst the trials which the very prosecution of their task would  inevitably engender. Was He not, through the several functions which He  exercised whilst He dwelt amongst them, whether in the laying of the  corner-stone of their House of Worship, or in the Feast which He offered  them and at which He chose to serve them in person, or in the emphasis  which He on a more solemn occasion placed on the implications of His  spiritual station--was He not, thereby, deliberately bequeathing to them  all the essentials of that spiritual heritage which He knew they would  ably safeguard and by their deeds continually enrich? And finally who can  doubt that in the Divine Plan which, in the evening of His life, He  unveiled to their eyes He was investing them with that spiritual primacy  on which they could rely in the fulfillment of their high destiny?    \"O ye apostles of Baha'u'llah!\" He thus addresses them in one of His  Tablets, \"May my life be sacrificed for you!... Behold the portals which  Baha'u'llah hath opened before you! Consider how exalted and lofty is the  station you are destined to attain; how unique the favors with which you  have been endowed.\" \"My thoughts,\" He tells them in another passage, \"are  turned towards you, and my heart leaps within me at your mention. Could ye  know how my soul glows with your love, so great a happiness would flood  your hearts as to cause you to become enamored with each other.\" \"The full  measure of your success,\" He declares in another Tablet, \"is as yet  unrevealed, its significance still unapprehended. Ere long ye will, with  your own eyes, witness how brilliantly every one of you, even as a shining  star, will radiate in the firmament of your country the light of Divine  Guidance and will bestow upon its people the glory of an everlasting  life.\" \"The range of your future achievements,\" He once more affirms,  \"still remains undisclosed. I fervently hope that in the near future the  whole earth may be stirred and shaken by the results of your  achievements.\" \"The Almighty,\" He assures them, \"will no doubt grant you  the help of His grace, will invest you with the tokens of His might, and  will endue your souls with the sustaining power of His holy Spirit.\" \"Be  not concerned,\" He admonishes them, \"with the smallness of your numbers,  neither be oppressed by the multitude of an unbelieving world... Exert  yourselves; your mission is unspeakably glorious. Should success crown  your enterprise, America will assuredly evolve into a center from which  waves of spiritual power will emanate, and the throne of the Kingdom of  God will, in the plentitude of its majesty and glory, be firmly  established.\"    \"The hope which 'Abdu'l-Baha cherishes for you,\" He thus urges them, \"is  that the same success which has attended your efforts in America may crown  your endeavors in other parts of the world, that through you the fame of  the Cause of God may be diffused throughout the East and the West and the  advent of the Kingdom of the Lord of Hosts be proclaimed in all the five  continents of the globe... Thus far ye have been untiring in your labors.  Let your exertions, henceforth, increase a thousandfold. Summon the people  in these countries, capitals, islands, assemblies and churches to enter  the Abha Kingdom. The scope of your exertions must needs be extended. The  wider its range, the more striking will be the evidences of Divine  assistance... Oh! that I could travel, even though on foot and in the  utmost poverty, to these regions and, raising the call of Ya Baha'u'l-Abha  in cities, villages, mountains, deserts and oceans, promote the Divine  teachings! This, alas, I cannot do! How intensely I deplore it! Please  God, ye may achieve it.\" And finally, as if to crown all His previous  utterances, is this solemn affirmation embodying His Vision of America's  spiritual destiny: \"The moment this Divine "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/19300"],[0,"A Traveler's Narrative Written to Illustrate the Episode of the Báb (#16)"],[1,"denizens [of the  realms] of His Power and His Kingdom, and the dwellers in the cities of  His Glory, and Himself, the True. I am not impatient of calamities in His  way, nor of afflictions for His love and at His good pleasure. God hath  made affliction as a morning shower to this green pasture, and as a match  for His lamp whereby earth and heaven are illumined.    \"Shall that which anyone hath of wealth endure unto him, or avail him  tomorrow with him who holdeth his forelock? If any should look on those  who sleep under slabs and keep company with the dust, can he distinguish  the bones of the king's skull from the knuckles of the slave? No, by the  King of Kings! Or doth he know governors from herdsmen, or discern the  wealthy and the rich from him who was without shoes or carpet? By God,  distinction is removed, save for him who fulfilled righteousness and  judged uprightly. Where are the doctors, the scholars, the nobles? Where  is the keenness of their glances, the sharpness of their sight, the  subtlety of their thoughts, the soundness of their understandings? Where  are their hidden treasures and their apparent gauds, their bejeweled  thrones and their ample couches? Alas! All have been laid waste, and the  decree of God hath rendered them as scattered dust! Emptied is what they  treasured up, and dissipated is what they collected, and dispersed is what  they concealed: they have become [such that] thou seest naught but their  empty places, their gaping roofs, their uprooted beams, their new things  waxed old. As for the discerning man, verily wealth will not divert him  from regarding the end; and for the prudent man, riches will not withhold  him from turning toward [God] the Rich, the Exalted. Where is he who held  dominion over all whereon the sun arose, and who spent lavishly and sought  after curious things in the world and what is therein created? Where is  the lord of the swarthy squadron and the yellow standard? Where is he who  ruled Zawra,(44) and where he who wrought injustice in [Damascus] the  spacious? Where are they at whose bounty treasures were afraid, at whose  openhandedness and generosity the ocean was dismayed? Where is he whose  arm was stretched forth in rebelliousness, whose heart turned away from  the Merciful One? Where is he who used to make choice of pleasures and  cull the fruits of desires? Where are the dames of the bridal chambers,  and the possessors of beauty? Where are their waving branches and their  spreading boughs, their lofty palaces and trellised gardens? Where is the  smoothness of the expanses thereof and the softness of their breezes, the  rippling of their waters and the murmur of their winds, the cooing of  their doves and the rustling of their trees? Where are their laughing  hearts and their smiling teeth? Woe unto them! They have descended to the  abyss and become companions to the pebbles; today no mention is heard of  them nor any sound; nothing is known of them nor any hint. Will the people  dispute it while they behold it? Will they deny it when they know it? I  know not in what valley they wander erringly: do they not see that they  depart and return not? How long will they be famous in the low countries  and in the high, descend and ascend? 'Is not the time yet come to those  who believe for their hearts to become humble for the remembrance of  God?'(45) Well is it with that one who hath said or shall say, 'Yea, O  Lord, the time is ripe and hath come,' and who severeth himself from all  that is. Alas! naught is reaped but what is sown, and naught is taken but  what is laid up, save by the grace of God and His favor. Hath the earth  conceived Him whom the veils of glory prevent not from ascending into the  Kingdom of His Lord, the Mighty, the Supreme? Have We any good works  whereby defects shall be removed or which shall bring Us near unto the  Lord of causes? We ask God to deal with Us according to His grace, not His  justice, and to make Us of those who turn toward Him and sever themselves  from all beside Him.    \"O King, I have seen in the way of God what no eye hath seen and no ear  hath heard. Friends have disclaimed Me; ways are straitened unto Me; the  pool of safety is dried up; the plain of ease is [scorched] yellow. How  many calamities have descended, and how many will descend! I walk  advancing toward the Mighty, the Bounteous, while behind Me glides the  serpent. My eyes rain down tears until My bed is drenched; but My sorrow  is not for Myself. By God, My head longeth for the spears for the love of  its Lord, and I never pass by a tree but My heart addresseth it [saying],  'O would that thou wert cut down in My name and My body were crucified  upon thee in the way of My Lord'; yea, because I see mankind going astray  in their intoxication, and they know it not: they have exalted their  lusts, and put aside their God, as though they took the command of God for  a mockery, a sport, and a plaything; and they think that they do well, and  that they are harbored in the citadel of security. The matter is not as  they suppose: tomorrow they shall see what they [now] deny.    \"We are about to shift from this most remote place of banishment(46) unto  the prison of Akka. And, according to what they say, it is assuredly the  most desolate of the cities of the world, the most unsightly of them in  appearance, the most detestable in climate, and the foulest in water; it  is as though it were the metropolis of the owl; there is not heard from  its regions aught save the sound of its hooting. And in it they intend to  imprison the Servant, and to shut in Our faces the doors of leniency and  take away from Us the good things of the life of the world during what  remaineth of Our days. By God, though weariness should weaken Me, and  hunger should destroy Me, though My couch should be made of the hard rock  and My associates of the beasts of the desert, I will not blench, but will  be patient, as the resolute and determined are patient, in the strength of  God, the King of Preexistence, the Creator of the nations; and under all  circumstances I give thanks unto God. And We hope of His graciousness  (exalted is He) the freedom of Our necks from chains and shackles in this  imprisonment: and that He will render [all men's] faces sincere toward  Him, the Mighty, the Bounteous. Verily He answereth him who prayeth unto  Him, and is near unto him who calleth on Him. And We ask Him to make this  dark calamity a buckler for the body of His saints, and to protect them  thereby from sharp swords and piercing blades. Through affliction hath His  light shone and His praise been bright unceasingly: this hath been His  method through past ages and bygone times.    \"The people shall know what today they understand not when their steeds  shall stumble, their beds be rolled up, their          [Pages 81-94]      swords be blunted, and their footsteps slip. I know not how long they  shall ride the steed of desire and wander erringly in the desert of  heedlessness and error. Of glory shall any glory endure, or of abasement  any abasement? Or shall he endure who used to stay himself on high  cushions, and who attained in splendor the utmost limit? No, by My Lord  the Merciful! 'All that is thereon is transient, and there remaineth  [only] the face of My Lord' the Mighty, the Beneficent. What buckler hath  not the arrow of destruction smitten, or what pinion hath not the hand of  fate plucked? From what fortress hath the messenger of death been kept  back when he came? What throne hath not been broken, or what palace hath  not been left desolate? Did men but know what pure wine of the mercy of  their Lord, the Mighty, the All-Knowing, was beneath the seal, they would  certainly cast aside reproach and seek to be satisfied by this Servant;  but now have they veiled Me with the veil of darkness which they have  woven with the hands of doubts and fancies. The White Hand shall cleave an  opening to this sombre night. On that day the servants [of God] shall say  what those caviling women said of yore, that there may appear in the end  what began in the beginning. Do they desire to tarry when their foot is in  the stirrup? Or do they see any return in their going? No, by the Lord of  Lords, save in the Resurrection! On that day men shall arise from the  tombs and shall be questioned concerning their riches. Happy that one whom  burdens shall not oppress on that day whereon the mountains shall pass  away and all shall appear for the questioning in the presence of God the  Exalted! Verily He is severe in punishing.    \"We ask God to sanctify the hearts of certain of the doctors from rancor  and hatred that they may regard things with eyes which closure overcometh  not; and to raise them unto a station where the world and the lordship  thereof shall not turn them aside from looking toward the Supreme Horizon,  and where [anxiety for] gaining a livelihood and [providing] household  goods shall not divert them from [the thought of] that day whereon the  mountains shall be made like carpets. Though they rejoice at that which  hath befallen Us of calamity, there shall come a day whereon they shall  wail and weep. By My Lord, were I given the choice between the glory and  opulence, the wealth and dignity, the ease and luxury wherein they are,  and the distress and affliction wherein I am, I would certainly choose  that wherein I am today, and I would not now exchange one atom of these  afflictions for all that hath been created in the kingdom of production!  Were it not for afflictions in the way of God My continuance would have no  sweetness for Me, nor would My life profit Me. Let it not be hidden from  the discerning and such as look towards the chiefest outlook that I,  during the greater part of My days, was as a Servant sitting beneath a  sword suspended by a single hair who knoweth not when it shall descend  upon Him, whether it shall descend instantly or after a while."]]]
