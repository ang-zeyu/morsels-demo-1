That's what I want to know?\"    \"I thought I would like it better than being a blacksmith.\"    \"But who ever dreamed of your being a blacksmith?\"    \"My uncle did. I'll tell you all about it.\"    Kit told his story. Jack Dormer listened with sympathetic interest.    \"Do they pay you well?\" he asked.    \"I get twenty-five dollars a week, and all expenses.\"    \"Can you get me a job?\" asked Jack quite overcome by the magnificence of  the salary.    \"As an acrobat, Jack?\" asked Kit, laughing, for Jack had the reputation  of being one of the clumsiest boys in school.    \"Well, no, I don't suppose I could do much in that way, but isn't there  something I could do?\"    \"Take my advice, Jack, and give it up. You've got a good home, and  there is no need of your going into any such business even if you were  qualified.\"    \"Don't you like it?\"    \"I can't tell yet. Of course it is exciting, but those who have been in  it a good while advise against it. I may not stay in it more than one  season.\"    \"Shall I tell the fellows at school where you are?\"    \"No, I would rather you wouldn't.\"    \"Does your cousin Ralph come back to school?\"    \"Yes.\"    \"We could spare him a good deal better than you.\"    \"I am not fond of Ralph myself, but the world is wide enough for us  both.\"    Kit saw his schoolmate again after the afternoon performance, and  received many compliments.    \"I couldn't believe it was you,\" he said. \"You acted as if you were an  old hand at the business.\"          CHAPTER XXII.    NEW ACQUAINTANCES.      Sunday was of course a day of rest for the circus employees. Most of  them observed it by lying in bed unusually late. Kit, however, rose in  good season, and found himself first at breakfast. When the proper time  arrived, he walked to the village, and selecting the first church he  came to, entered. He had always been in the habit of attending church,  and felt that there was no good reason why he should give up the  practice now that he was away from home.    He stood in the lobby, waiting for the sexton to appear, when a  fine-looking man of middle age entered the church with a young girl of  fourteen at his side.    He glanced at Kit with interest, and after a moment's pause walked up to  him.    \"Are you a stranger here?\" he asked.    \"Yes, sir,\" answered Kit.    \"I shall be glad to have you accept a seat in my pew.\"    \"Thank you, sir,\" said Kit, politely; \"I was waiting for the sexton,  intending to ask him for a seat.\"    \"I have plenty of room in my pew, having only my daughter with me. Are  you staying long in the town?\"    \"Only as long as the circus does,\" answered Kit.    The gentleman looked surprised.    \"Are you connected with the circus?\" he asked, quickly.    \"Yes, sir.\"    By this time the young girl was examining Kit with interest and  attention.    \"Is it possible you are a performer?\"    \"Yes, sir.\"    \"I wouldn't have dreamed it. You look like a young gentleman.\"    \"I hope I am, sir.\"    \"Pardon me, I meant no offense, but you don't at all answer my idea of a  circus performer.\"    \"I have only been two days with the circus,\" said Kit; \"and that may  account for my not having a circus look.\"    \"It is time to take our seats. I will speak with you afterwards. First,  however, let me introduce my daughter, Evelyn Grant.\"    \"I am glad to make your acquaintance, Miss Evelyn,\" said Kit, removing  his hat. \"My name is Christopher Watson.\"    Evelyn offered her hand with a smile.    \"I had no idea circus young men were so polite,\" she said.    There was no chance for any further conversation, as they had entered  the church. Mr. Grant's pew was in a prominent position. He drew back to  let the two young people enter. They seated themselves at the lower end  of the pew and Mr. Grant took his seat at the head. Kit noticed that  several persons in neighboring pews regarded him with apparent  curiosity.    Kit enjoyed the services, which were of an interesting character. He had  expected to feel like a stranger, but thanks to the kindness of Mr.  Grant, he felt quite as much at home as when he sat in his uncle's pew  at Smyrna.    When the services were over, they filed slowly out of church. A new  surprise was in store for Kit.    \"If you have no engagement we shall be glad to have you dine with us,  Master Watson,\" said Mr. Grant.    \"You will come, won't you?\" said Evelyn, with a smile.    \"You are very kind,\" said Kit, in grateful surprise. \"Nothing could be  more agreeable to me.\"    Just then a gentleman approached Mr. Grant, and said: \"I am glad to see  you looking so well, Mr. Mayor.\"    \"Is your father the mayor of the city?\" asked Kit.    \"Yes; he was elected last December.\"    \"I am very fortunate to be invited to dinner by the mayor.\"    \"And by the mayor's daughter. Don't forget that.\"    \"You may be sure I appreciate that, too.\"    \"How funny it seems to me to be walking with a circus performer! What do  you do? You don't stand upon a horse's back, and jump through hoops, do  you?\"    \"No, I can't do that.\"    \"But what do you do?\"    \"I am an acrobat.\"    Kit explained to her what he did.    \"It must be very hard.\"    \"Oh, no! I learned to do it in a gymnasium, before I ever dreamed of  being connected with a circus.\"    \"Where was the gymnasium?\"    \"Attached to Dr. Codman's academy.\"    \"Why, I had a cousin who attended there,\" said Evelyn, in surprise.    \"What was his name?\"    \"Edward Moore.\"    \"I know him very well. He is a nice fellow.\"    At this moment Kit, in looking around, was surprised to see the familiar  face and figure of Mr. Barlow, the circus proprietor, who had evidently,  like himself, been attending the service. Recognition was mutual.    \"I am glad to see you here, Watson,\" said Mr. Barlow, offering his hand.  \"I always attend church myself when I have an opportunity, but I am  afraid few in my employ follow my example. I always feel more confidence  in any young man who seems to enjoy a church service.\"    Mr. Barlow was a man whose name was widely known, and Kit saw that Mr.  Grant looked as if he would like to be introduced.    \"Mr. Barlow,\" he said, \"allow me to introduce a new friend, Mr. Grant,  the mayor of the town.\"    \"I am pleased to make your acquaintance, Mr. Mayor,\" said the showman,  offering his hand.    \"The pleasure is mutual, sir,\" said the mayor. \"I need not say that your  name has long been familiar to me.\"    \"I am glad you have taken one of my young men under your wing. He is a  recent acquisition, but I have reason to think well of him.\"    \"He is to dine with us to-day. I shall be glad to extend an invitation  to you also, Mr. Barlow.\"    \"You are very kind, and but for a previous engagement I would accept  with pleasure. I shall be glad to see you at my show to-morrow with  complimentary tickets.\"    \"What a nice old gentleman Mr. Barlow is,\" said Evelyn, in a low voice.    \"I have found him an excellent friend. He won't allow any of us to drink  or gamble while we are in his employ.\"    \"I hope you wouldn't want to do either, Mr. Watson.\"    \"I have no disposition to do so. But, Miss Evelyn, I want to ask you a  favor.\"    \"What is it? If it isn't anything very great, I may grant it.\"    \"Don't call me Mr. Watson.\"    \"What shall I call you then?\"    \"My friends call me Kit.\"    \"That's a nice name. Yes, I'll call you Kit.\"    It will be seen that the two young people were getting on famously.    \"Do you live far away, Miss Evelyn?\"    \"About a quarter of a mile from here.\"    In turning the corner of a street, Kit met his friend Harry Thorne,  walking with Charlie Davis. Both regarded Kit with surprise.    \"Kit seems to be getting on,\" said Charlie. \"Do you know who he is  walking with?\"    \"No; do you?\"    \"With the daughter of the mayor.\"    \"How do you know?\"    \"The gentleman in front was pointed out to me as the mayor. I shouldn't  wonder if he were going to dine there.\"    When Kit returned to the circus tents about four o'clock in the  afternoon, he met with some good-natured raillery which he took in good  part. He felt that he had passed the day in a much more satisfactory  manner than if, like the great majority of his companions, he had risen  late and lounged about the circus grounds, beguiling the time with  smoking and story telling.          CHAPTER XXIII.    KIT'S DARING ACT.      Kit's acts thus far had been confined to the ring, but now a new one was  expected from him. Early in the performance a series of flying leaps  from a springboard, in which all the acrobats took part, was introduced.  From a point thirty feet back the performer ran swiftly till he reached  the springboard, from which a leap was made accompanied by a somersault,  carrying him over a considerable space in advance.    It was the custom to place first one elephant, then a second, and  finally a third, in front of the springboard. There was only one man who  could leap over three elephants. The two Vincenti brothers took part  regularly, but Kit, being a new hand, had thus far been excused. But one  of the regular performers being temporarily unwell, it was considered  desirable that his place should be supplied.    \"Do you think you can do it?\" asked Alonzo Vincenti, somewhat  doubtfully.    \"Yes,\" answered Kit, confidently.    \"It will be sufficient if you jump over one elephant,\" continued his  associate. \"Then you can drop out.\"    \"I can do better than that,\" said Kit.    \"I don't know about that. My brother can only jump over two.\"    \"You jump over three elephants.\"    \"Yes; but I am the only one who can do it. It takes a good spring to  clear even two. It won't do to lose your head.\"    \"Can I have a chance to rehearse?\"    \"Yes, I will speak about it.\"    \"Then I will appear this evening.\"    \"But if you fail you are likely to hurt yourself.\"    \"I know that. That is why I would rather make the first trial in the  evening. The lights and the crowd will excite and help me.\"    Kit was not"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/22522"],[0,"Artists' Wives (#16)"],[1,"never gave a thought to all this. You were satisfied with  saying to your friends: 'I have a wife who is a surprisingly skilful  manager. With what I gain, she not only pays our expenses, but manages  also to put by money.' It was you who were surprising, poor man! The  truth was that you had married one of those pretty little unscrupulous  creatures of which Paris is full, an ambitious flirt, serious in what  concerned your interests and unprejudiced in regard of her own, knowing  how to reconcile your affairs and her pleasures. The life of these  women, my dear fellow, resembles a dance programme in which sums would  be placed side by side with the dancers' names. Yours reasoned in the  following manner: 'My husband has no talent, no fortune, no good looks  either; but he is an excellent man, good-natured, credulous, as little  in the way as possible. Provided he leaves me free to amuse myself as  I choose, I can undertake to give him all he lacks!' And from that day  forth, money, orders, decorations from all countries kept pouring  in upon your studio, with their pretty metallic sound and their  many-coloured ribbons. Look at the row on my lapel. Then one fine  morning, Madame was seized with the fancy--a fancy of beauty on the  wane--to be the wife of an Academician, and it is her delicately  gloved hand that has opened before you one by one all the doors of the  sanctuary. Ah! my poor old fellow, your colleagues alone can tell you  what all these green palms have cost you!\"    \"You lie, you lie!\" screamed Guillardin, half choked by indignation.    \"Ah no! my old friend, indeed I do not lie. You need only to look  around you presently, when you enter the reception hall. You will see a  malicious gleam in every eye, a smile at the corner of every lip,  while they will whisper as you pass by: 'Here is the beautiful Madame  Guillardin's husband.' For you will never be anything else in life, my  dear fellow, but the husband of a pretty woman.\"    This time, Guillardin could bear it no longer. Pale with rage, he  bounded forward, to seize and dash into the fire, after first tearing  from it the pretty green palm wreath, this insolent and raving coat; but  a door opens and a well-known voice, tinged with a mixture of contempt  and mild condescension, opportunely awakes him from his horrible  nightmare:    \"Oh! that is just like you, asleep at the corner of the fire on such an  important day!\"    And Madame Guillardin stands before him, tall and still handsome,  although rather too imposing with her almost natural pink complexion,  her powdered hair, and the exaggerated brilliancy of her painted eyes.  With the gesture of the superior woman, she takes up the green-palmed  coat, and briskly, with a little smile, helps her husband to don it;  while he, poor man, still trembling with the horrors of his nightmare,  draws a deep sigh of relief and thinks to himself: \"Thank goodness! It  was a dream!\"    [Illustration: p224-235]"]]]
