(#16)"],[1,"was sent, who, while he prescribed  medicine for the sick of the newly-arrived emigrants, converted Endicot  from Episcopalianism to Congregationalism--at least from being a  professed Churchman to being an avowed Congregationalist. This is  distinctly stated by all the historians of the times.[31]    It is therefore clear that Endicot had imbibed new views of Church  government and form of worship, and that he determined not to perpetuate  the worship of the Church of England, to which he had professed to  belong when he left England, but to form a new Church and a new form of  worship. He seems to have brought over some thirty of the new emigrants  to his new scheme; and among these were the newly-arrived ministers,  Higginson and Skelton. They were both clergymen of the Puritan  school--professing loyalty to the Church, but refusing to conform to the  novel ceremonies imposed by Laud and his party.[32] But within two  months after their arrival, they entered into the new views of Endicot  to found a new Church on the Congregational system. Their manner of  proceeding to do so has been stated above (p. 29.) Mr. Hutchinson  remarks--\"The New England Puritans, when at full liberty, went the full  length which the Separatists did in England. It does not follow that  they would have done so if they had remained in England. In their form  of worship they universally followed the New Plymouth Church.\"[33]    The question is naturally suggested, could King Charles the First, in  granting the Charter, one declared object of which was converting the  Indians, have intended or contemplated the superseding the Church for  whose episcopacy he perished on the scaffold, by the establishment of  Congregationalism in New England? The supposition is absurd, and it is  equally unreasonable to suppose that those who applied for and obtained  the Charter contemplated anything of the kind, as will appear presently.    It can hardly be conceived that even among the newly-arrived emigrants  on the shores of Massachusetts, such a revolution as the adoption of a  new form of worship could be accomplished without doing violence to the  convictions and endeared associations of some parties. However they  might have objected to the ceremonies and despotic acts of the Laudian  school in England, they could not, without a pang and voice of  remonstrance, renounce the worship which had given to England her  Protestantism and her liberties, or repudiate the book which embodied  that form of worship, and which was associated with all that had exalted  England, from Cramner and Ridley to their own day. Congregationalism  had done nothing for the Protestantism or liberties of England, and it  would have been strange indeed had there not been some among the  emigrants who would not consider their change of latitude and longitude  as destroying their Church membership, and sundering the additional ties  which connected them with their forefathers and the associations of all  their past life. Endicot, therefore, with all his authority as local  Governor, and all his energy and zeal, and canvassing among the two or  three hundred new emigrants for a new Church, had not been able to get  more than thirty of them, with the aid of the two newly-arrived  ministers, to unite in the new Covenant Confession; but he had got the  (if not coerced) majority of the local Councillors to join with him, and  therefore exercised absolute power over the little community, and  denounced and treated as mutinous and factious all who would not  renounce the Church of their fathers and of their own profession down to  that hour, and adopt the worship of his new community.    As only thirty joined with Endicot in the creation of his new Church  organization and Covenant, it is obvious that a majority of the  emigrants either stood aloof from or were opposed to this extraordinary  proceeding. Among the most noted of these adherents to the old Church of  the Reformation were two brothers, John and Samuel Brown, who refused to  be parties to this new and locally-devised Church revolution, and  resolved, for themselves, families, and such as thought with them, to  continue to worship God according to the custom of their fathers and  nation.    It is the fashion of several American historians, as well as their  echoes in England, to employ epithets of contumely in regard to those  men, the Browns--both of them men of wealth--the one a lawyer and the  other a private gentleman--both of them much superior to Endicot himself  in social position in England--both of them among the original patentees  and first founders of the colony--both of them Church reformers, but  neither of them a Church revolutionist. It is not worthy of Dr. Palfrey  and Mr. Bancroft to employ the words \"faction\" and \"factionists\" to the  protests of John and Samuel Brown.[34]    What is stated by Dr. Palfrey and Mr. Bancroft more than refutes and  condemns the opprobrious epithets they apply to the Browns. On pages 29  and 30 I have given, in the words of Mr. Hutchinson, the account of the  formation of the new Church, and the expulsion of the Browns for their  refusal to conform to it. Dr. Palfrey states the transaction between  Endicot and the Browns in the following words:    \"The transaction which determined the religious constitution of New  England gave offence to two of the Councillors, John and Samuel Brown.  Considering the late proceedings, _as well they might do_, to amount to  a _secession from the national Establishment_, they, with some others of  the same mind, set up a separate worship, conducted according to the  Book of Common Prayer. Endicot and his friends were in no mood to  tolerate this schism. The brothers, brought before the Governor, said  that the ministers 'were Separatists, and would be Anabaptists.' The  ministers replied that 'they came away from the Common Prayer and  ceremonies, and had suffered much for their nonconformity in their  native land, and therefore, being placed where they might have their  liberty, they neither could nor would use them, because they judged the  imposition of these things to be sinful corruptions of God's worship.'  There was no composing such strife, and 'therefore, finding these two  brothers to be of high spirits, and their speeches and practice tending  to mutiny and faction, the Governor told them that New England was no  place for such as they, and therefore he sent them both back for England  at the return of the ships the same year.'\"[35]    Mr. Bancroft says: \"The Church was self-constituted. It did not ask the  assent of the King or recognize him as its head; its officers were set  apart and ordained among themselves; it used no Liturgy, and it rejected  unnecessary ceremonies; and reduced the simplicity of Calvin to a still  plainer standard.\" \"There existed even in this little company a few  individuals to whom the new system was unexpected; and in John and  Samuel Brown they found able leaders. Both were members of the Colonial  Council, and they had been favourites of the Corporation in England; and  one of them, an experienced and meritorious lawyer, had been a member of  the Board of Assistants in London. They declared their dissent from the  Church of Higginson; and at every risk of union and tranquillity, they  insisted upon the use of the English Liturgy.\" \"Finding it to be a vain  attempt to persuade the Browns to relinquish their resolute opposition,  and _believing_ that their speeches _tended_ to produce _disorder_ and  dangerous feuds, Endicot sent them back to England in the returning  ships; and _faction_, deprived of its leaders, died away.\"[36]    It is clear from these statements--partial as they are in favour of  Endicot and against the Browns--that Endicot himself was the innovator,  the Church revolutionist and the would-be founder of a new Church, the  real schismatic from the old Church, and therefore responsible for any  discussions which might arise from his proceedings; while the Browns and  their friends were for standing in the old ways and walking in the old  paths, refusing to be of those who were given to change. Mr. Bancroft  says that \"the _new system_ was _unexpected_\" to them. Mr. Palfrey says  that \"John and Samuel Brown, considering the late proceedings, _as well  they might_, to amount to a _secession from the national Establishment_,  they, with some others of the same mind, set up a separate worship  conducted according to the Book of Common Prayer.\" Or, more properly,  they _continued_ the worship according to the Book of Common Prayer,  which they and their fathers had practised, as well as Endicot and  Higginson themselves up to that day, refusing to leave the old Church of  the Reformation, and come into a new Church founded by joining of hands  of thirty persons, in a new covenant, walking around the place of the  old town-pump of Salem. Mr. Endicot is sent from England as the manager  of a trading Company, and invested with powers as their local temporary  Governor, to manage their business and remove persons that might disturb  or interfere with its operations; and he becomes acquainted with a  Doctor Fuller, a deacon of a Congregational Church at New Plymouth, and  imbibes his views; and forthwith sets himself to abolish the old Church,  and found a new one, and proceeds at length to banish as seditious and  mutinous those who would not forsake the old way of worship and follow  him in his new way of worship.    Some of the above quoted language of Dr. Palfrey and Mr. Bancroft  implies improper conduct on the part of the brothers Brown, for which  they were banished. Even if that were so, their position of unchangeable  loyalty to their post and of good faith to their Company might be  pleaded in justification of the strongest language on their part. But  such was not the fact; it was their _position_, and not their language  or tempers. Mr. Bancroft himself says, in the"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/21020"],[0,"The Little Clay Cart (#16)"],[1,"foot of the pillars that sustain the portal. The doors are of gold,  thickly set with diamonds as hard to pierce as a giant's breast.  It actually wearies a poor devil's envy. Yes, Vasantasena's house-door  is a beautiful thing. Really, it forcibly challenges the attention  of a man who doesn't care about such things.    [68.16. S.    _Maid._ Come, sir, and enter the first court.    _Maitreya._ [_Enters and looks about._] Well! Here in the first court  are rows of balconies brilliant as the moon, or as sea-shells, or as  lotus-stalks; whitened by handfuls of powder strewn over them;  gleaming with golden stairways inlaid with all sorts of gems: they  seem to gaze down on Ujjayini with their round faces, the crystal  windows, from which strings of pearls are dangling. The porter sits  there and snoozes as comfortably as a professor. The crows which  they tempt with rice-gruel and curdled milk will not eat the  offering, because they can't distinguish it from the mortar. Show  me the way, madam.    _Maid._ Come, sir, and enter the second court.    _Maitreya._ [_Enters and looks about._] Well! Here in the second  court the cart-bullocks are tied. They grow fat on mouthfuls of  grass and pulse-stalks which are brought them, right and left, by  everybody. Their horns are smeared with oil. And here is another,  a buffalo, snorting like a gentleman insulted. And here is a ram[53]  having his neck rubbed, like a prize-fighter after the fight. And  here are others, horses having their manes put in shape. And here  in a stall is another, a monkey, tied fast like a thief. [_He looks in  another direction._] And here is an elephant, taking from his drivers  a cake of rice and drippings and oil. Show me the way, madam.    _Maid._ Come, sir, and enter the third court.    _Maitreya._ [_Enters and looks about._] Well! Here in the third court  are these seats, prepared for young gentlemen to sit on. A half-read  book is lying on the gaming-table. And the table itself has  its own dice, made out of gems. And here, again, are courtezans  and old hangers-on at court, past masters in the war and peace of  love, wandering about and holding in their fingers pictures painted  in many colors. Show me the way, madam.    P. 117.4]    _Maid._ Come, sir, and enter the fourth court.    _Maitreya._ [_Enters and looks about._] Well! Here in the fourth  court the drums that maiden fingers beat are booming like the  thunder; the cymbals are falling, as the stars fall from heaven when  their merit is exhausted;[54] the pipe is discoursing music as sweet  as the humming of bees. And here, again, is a lute that somebody  is holding on his lap like a girl who is excited by jealousy and  love, and he is stroking it with his fingers. And here, again, are  courtezan girls that sing as charmingly as honey-drunken bees,  and they are made to dance and recite a drama with love in it.  And water-coolers are hanging in the windows so as to catch the  breeze. Show me the way, madam.    _Maid._ Come, sir, and enter the fifth court.    _Maitreya._ [_Enters and looks about._] Well! Here in the fifth court  the overpowering smell of asafetida and oil is attractive enough  to make a poor devil's mouth water. The kitchen is kept hot all  the time, and the gusts of steam, laden with all sorts of good  smells, seem like sighs issuing from its mouth-like doors. The  smell of the preparation of all kinds of foods and sauces makes me  smack my lips. And here, again, is a butcher's boy washing a mess  of chitterlings as if it were an old loin-cloth. The cook is preparing  every kind of food. Sweetmeats are being constructed, cakes  are being baked. [_To himself._] I wonder if I am to get a chance to  wash my feet and an invitation to eat what I can hold. [_He looks  in another direction._] There are courtezans and bastard pages,  adorned with any number of jewels, just like Gandharvas[55] and  Apsarases.[56] Really, this house is heaven. Tell me, who are you  bastards anyway?    [70.13. S.    _Pages._ Why, we are bastard pages--        Petted in a stranger's court.        Fed on stranger's food,      Stranger's money makes us sport--        Not so very good.      Stranger women gave us birth.        Stranger men begot;      Baby elephants in mirth,        We're a bastard lot.                                       28    _Maitreya._ Show me the way, madam.    _Maid._ Come, sir, and enter the sixth court.    _Maitreya._ [_Enters and looks about._] Well! Here in the sixth  court they are working in gold and jewels. The arches set with  sapphires look as if they were the home of the rainbow. The jewelers  are testing the lapis lazuli, the pearls, the corals, the topazes,  the sapphires, the cat's-eyes, the rubies, the emeralds, and all the  other kinds of gems. Rubies are being set in gold. Golden ornaments  are being fashioned. Pearls are being strung on a red cord.  Pieces of lapis lazuli are being cleverly polished. Shells are being  pierced. Corals are being ground. Wet bundles of saffron are being  dried. Musk is being moistened. Sandalwood is being ground  to make sandal-water. Perfumes are being compounded. Betel-leaves  and camphor are being given to courtezans and their lovers.  Coquettish glances are being exchanged. Laughter is going on.  Wine is being drunk incessantly with sounds of glee. Here are  men-servants, here are maid-servants, and here are men who forget  child and wife and money. When the courtezans, who have  drunk the wine from the liquor-jars, give them the mitten, they--drink.  Show me the way, madam.    P. 121.5]    _Maid._ Come, sir, and enter the seventh court.    _Maitreya._ [_Enters and looks about._] Well! Here in the seventh  court the mated doves are sitting comfortably in their snug dovecotes,  billing and cooing and nothing else, and perfectly happy.  And there is a parrot in a cage, chanting like a Brahman with a  bellyful of curdled milk and rice. And here, again, is a talking  thrush, chattering like a housemaid who spreads herself because  somebody noticed her. A cuckoo, her throat still happy from tasting  all sorts of fruit-syrups, is cooing like a procuress. Rows of  cages are hanging from pegs. Quails are being egged on to fight.  Partridges are being made to talk. Caged pigeons are being provoked.  A tame peacock that looks as if he was adorned with all  sorts of gems is dancing happily about, and as he flaps his wings,  he seems to be fanning the roof which is distressed by the rays  of the sun. [_He looks in another direction._] Here are pairs of flamingos  like moonbeams rolled into a ball, that wander about after  pretty girls, as if they wanted to learn how to walk gracefully.  And here, again, are tame cranes, walking around like ancient  eunuchs. Well, well! This courtezan keeps a regular menagerie of  birds. Really, the courtezan's house seems to me like Indra's heaven.  Show me the way, madam.    _Maid._ Come, sir, and enter the eighth court.    _Maitreya._ [_Enters and looks about._] Madam, who is this in the  silk cloak, adorned with such astonishingly tautologous ornaments,  who wanders about, stumbling and stretching his limbs?    _Maid._ Sir, this is my mistress' brother.    _Maitreya._ What sort of ascetic exercises does a man have to perform,  in order to be born as Vasantasena's brother? But no,        He may be shiny, may be greasy,        And perfumed may he be.      And yet I warn you to go easy;        He's a graveyard champak-tree.                             29    [_He looks in another direction._] But madam, who is that in the  expansive garment, sitting on the throne? She has shoes on her  greasy feet.    [72.9. S.    _Maid._ Sir, that is my mistress' mother.    _Maitreya._ Lord! What an extensive belly the dirty old witch has  got! I suppose they couldn't put that superb portal on the house  till after they had brought the idol in?    _Maid._ Rascal! You must not make fun of our mother so. She is  pining away under a quartan ague.    _Maitreya._ [_Bursts out laughing._] O thou blessed quartan ague!  Look thou upon a Brahman, even upon me, with this thy favor!    _Maid._ Rascal! May death strike you.    _Maitreya._ [_Bursts out laughing._] Why, wench, a pot-belly like  that is better dead.        Drinking brandy, rum, and wine,        Mother fell extremely ill.      If mother now should peak and pine,        A jackal-pack would have its fill.                         30    Well, I have seen Vasantasena's palace with its many incidents  and its eight courts, and really, it seems as if I had seen the triple  heaven in a nut-shell. I haven't the eloquence to praise it. Is this  the house of a courtezan, or a piece of Kubera's[57] palace? Where's  your mistress?    _Maid._ She is here in the orchard. Enter, sir.    _Maitreya._ [_Enters and looks about._] Well! What a beautiful orchard!  There are any number of trees planted here, and they are  covered with the most wonderful flowers. Silken swings are hung  under the thick-set trees, just big enough for a girl to sit in. The  golden jasmine, the shephalika, the white jasmine, the jessamine,  the navamallika, the amaranth, the spring creeper, and all the other  flowers have fallen of themselves, and really, it makes Indra's heaven  look dingy. [_He looks in another direction._] And the pond here  looks like the morning twilight, for the lilies and red lotuses are  as splendid as the rising sun. And again:        The ashoka-tree, whose twigs so merry        And crimson flowers have just appeared,      Seems like a battling mercenary,        With clotting crimson gore besmeared.                      31    Good! Now where's your mistress?    P. 126.7]    _Maid._ If you would stop star-gazing, sir, you would see her.    _Maitreya._ [_Perceives Vasantasena and approaches._] Heaven bless  you!    _Vasantasena._ [_Speaking in Sanskrit._[58]] Ah, Maitreya! [_Rising._] You  are very welcome. Here is a seat. Pray be seated.    _Maitreya._ When you are seated,"]]]
