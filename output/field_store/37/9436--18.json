I can therefore study it only in Mr. Gould's drawing, on  consulting which, I find the bird to be simply a sea dabchick,--brown  stripes on the back, and all; but the webs of the feet a little finer,  and in its habits it is more like the Lily-ouzel, according to the  following report of Mr. St. John: \"The red-necked phalarope is  certainly the most beautiful little wader of my acquaintance. There  were a pair of them, male and female, feeding near the loch, in a  little pool which was covered with weeds of different kinds. Nothing  could be more graceful than the movements of these two little birds, as  they swam about in search of insects, etc. Sometimes _they ran lightly  on the broad leaves of the water-lily which served them for a raft_,  and entirely kept them out of the water. Though not exactly web-footed,  the phalarope swims with the greatest ease. The attachment of these two  birds to each other seemed very great: whenever in their search for  food they wandered so far apart as to be hidden by the intervening  weeds, the male bird stopped feeding suddenly, and, looking round,  uttered a low and musical call of inquiry, which was immediately  answered by the female in a different note, but perfectly expressive of  her answer, which one might suppose to be to the purport that she was  at hand and quite safe; on hearing her, the male immediately  recommenced feeding, but at the same time making his way towards her;  she also flew to meet him; they then joined company for a moment or  two, and, after a few little notes of endearment, turned off again in  different directions. This scene was repeated a dozen times while I was  watching them. They seemed to have not the slightest fear of me, for  frequently they came to within a yard of where I was sitting, and after  looking up they continued catching the small water-insects, etc., on  the weeds, without minding my presence in the least.\" What reward the  birds got for this gentle behavior, we learn from the sentence  following after the next two lines, containing the extremely valuable  contribution to their natural history, that \"on dissecting the female  we found two eggs in her.\"          [24] The terminal 'pe' is short for pus, (pous!) and 'phalero,'        from phalera, fringes--\"Fringe-foot\" (Morris).    112. All other accounts concur in expressing (with as much admiration  as is possible to naturalists) the kindly and frank disposition of this  bird; which for the rest is almost a central type of all bird power  with elf gifts added: it flies like a lark, trips on water-lily leaves  like a fairy, swims like a duck, and roves like a sea-gull, having been  seen sixty miles from land: and, finally, though living chiefly in  Lapland and Iceland, and other such northern countries, it has been  seen serenely swimming and catching flies in the hot water of the  geysers, in which a man could not bear his hand.    And no less harmoniously than in report of the extreme tameness, grace,  and affectionateness of this bird do sportsmen agree also in the  treatment and appreciation of these qualities. Thus says Mr. Salmon:  \"Although we shot two pairs, those that were swimming about did not  take the least notice of the report of the gun, and they seemed to be  much attached to each other; for when one of them flew to a short  distance, the other directly followed; and while I held a wounded  female in my hand, its mate came and fluttered before my face.\"  (Compare the scene between Irene and Hector, at page 393 of the May  number of _Aunt Judy's Magazine_.) And, again, says Mr. Wolley: \"The  bird is extremely tame, swimming about my india-rubber boat so near  that I could almost catch it in my hand; I have seen it even, when far  from its nest, struck at many times with an oar before it flew away.\"  In its domestic habits also the creature seems as exemplary as, in its  social habits, it is frank; for on the approach of danger to her  nestlings, the hen uses all the careful subtleties of the most cunning  land birds, \"spreading her wings, and counterfeiting lameness, for the  purpose of deluding the intruder; and after leading the enemy from her  young, she takes wing and flies to a great height, at the same time  displaying a peculiar action of the wings; then descending with great  velocity, and making simultaneously a noise with her wings. On her  return to her young, she uses a particular cry for the purpose of  gathering them together. As soon as she has collected them, she covers  them with her wings, like the domestic hen.\"    113. I cannot quite make out the limits of the fairy's migrations; but  it is said by Morris to 'occur' in France, Holland, Germany, Italy, and  Switzerland. I find that one was what sportsmen call 'procured' near  York, in full summer dress; and another killed at Rottingdean, swimming  in a pond in the middle of the village, in the company of some ducks.  At Scarborough, Louth, and Shoreham, it has also been captured or shot,  and has been 'found' building nests in Sutherland: and, on the whole,  it seems that here is a sort of petrel-partridge, and duckling-dove,  and diving-lark, with every possible grace and faculty that bird can  have, in body and soul; ready, at least in summer, to swim on our  village ponds, or, wait at our railway stations, and make the wild  north-eastern coasts of Scotland gay with its dancing flocks upon the  foam; were it not that the idle cockneys, and pot-headed squires fresh  out of Parliament, stand as it were on guard all round the island,  spluttering small-shot at it, striking at it with oars, cutting it open  to find how many eggs there are inside, and, in fine, sending it for  refuge into the hot water of Hecla, and any manner of stormy solitude  that it can still find for itself and its amber nestlings. I have never  seen one, nor I suppose ever shall see, but hear of some of my friends  sunning themselves at midnight about the North Cape, of whom, if any  one will bring me a couple of Arctic fairies in a basket, I think I can  pledge our own Squire's and Squire's lady's faith, for the pair's  getting some peace, if they choose to take it, and as many water-lily  leaves as they can trip upon, on the tarns of Monk-Coniston.      IV.B.    TITANIA INCONSTANS.    CHANGEFUL FAIRY.    _Phalaropus Fulicarius._ (_Coot-like Phalarope--Gould._)    114. I think the epithet 'changeful' prettier, and, until we know what  a coot _is_ like, more descriptive, than 'coot-like'; the bird having  red plumage in summer, and gray in winter, while the coot is always  black. It is a little less pretty and less amiable than its sister  fairy; otherwise scarcely to be thought of but as a variety, both of  them being distinguished from the coot, not only by color, but by their  smaller size;--(they eight inches long, it sixteen)--and by the slender  beaks, the coot having a thick one, half-way to a puffin's.    And here, once for all,--for I see I have taken no note yet of the  beaks or bills of my dabchicks,--I will at once arrange a formula of  the order of questions which it will be proper to ask, and get  answered, concerning any bird, in the same order always, so that we  shall never miss anything that we ought to think of. And I find these  questions will naturally and easily fall into the following twelve:     1. Country, and scope of migration.   2. Food.   3. Form and flight.   4. Foot.   5. Beak and eye.   6. Voice and ear.   7. Temper.   8. Nest.   9. Eggs.  10. Brood.  11. Feathers.  12. Uses in the world.    It may be thought that I have forced--and not fallen into--my number  12, by packing the faculties of sight and hearing into by-corners. But  the expression of a bird's head depends on the relation of eye to beak,  as the getting of its food depends on their practical alliance of  power; and the question, for instance, whether peacocks and parrots  have musical ears, seems to me not properly debatable unless with due  respect to the quality of their voices. It is curious, considering how  much, one way or another, we are amused or pleased by the chatter and  song of birds, that you will scarcely find in any ornithic manual more  than a sentence, if so much, about their hearing; and I have not  myself, at this moment, the least idea where a nightingale's ears are!  But see Appendix, p. 122.    I retain, therefore, my dodecahedric form of catechism as sufficiently  clear; and without binding myself to follow the order of it in  strictness, if there be motive for discursory remark, it will certainly  prevent my leaving any bird insufficiently distinguished, and enable me  to arrange the collected statements about it in the most easily  compared order.    115. We will try it at once on this second variety of the Titania, of  which I find nothing of much interest in my books, and have nothing  discursive myself to say.     1. Country. Arctic mostly; seen off Greenland, in lat. 68 deg., swimming  among icebergs three or four miles from shore. Abundant in Siberia, and  as far south as the Caspian. Migratory in Europe as far as Italy, yet  always rare. (Do a few only, more intelligently curious than the rest,  or for the sake of their health, travel?)     2. Food. Small thin-skinned crustacea, and aquatic surface-insects.     3. Form and flight. Stout, for a sea-bird; and they don't care to fly,   preferring to _swim_ out of danger. Body 7 to 8 inches long; wings,   from carpal joint to end, 4-3/4,--say 5. These quarters of inches, are   absurd pretenses to generalize what varies in every bird. 8 inches   long, by 10 across the wings open, is near enough. In future, the   brief notification 8 x 10, 5 x 7, or the like, will enough express a   bird's inches, unless it possess decorative appendage of tail, which   must be noted separately.     4. Foot. Chestnut-leaved in front toes, the lobes slightly serrated  on the edges."]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/21200"],[0,"The Letters of Cicero, Volume 1 (#16)"],[1,"and afraid that I  am setting a trap for them! Nor do they suppose that a man can be short  of money who has relieved the money-lenders from a state of siege. In  point of fact, money is plentiful at six per cent., and the success of  my measures has caused me to be regarded as a good security. Your own  house, and all the details of its construction, I have examined and  strongly approve. As for Antonius,[65] though everyone notices his want  of attention to my interests, I have nevertheless defended him in the  senate with the utmost earnestness and persistence, and have made a  strong impression on the senate by my language as well as by my personal  prestige. Pray write to me more frequently.    [Footnote 64: P. Sestius was serving as proquaestor in Macedonia under  Gaius Antonius. As tribune in B.C. 57 he worked for Cicero's recall, but  was afterwards prosecuted _de vi_, and defended by Cicero.]    [Footnote 65: Gaius Antonius, Cicero's colleague in the consulship. He  had the province of Macedonia after the consulship, Cicero having  voluntarily withdrawn in his favour to secure his support against  Catiline. Scandal said that he had bargained to pay Cicero large sums  from the profits of the province. He governed so corruptly and  unsuccessfully that he was on his return condemned of _maiestas_.]          XVI (A I, 12)    [Sidenote: B.C. 61. Coss., M. Papius Piso, M. Valerius Messalla.]         The letters of this year are much concerned with the sacrilege of       P. Clodius, who, it was alleged, had been detected in disguise in       the house of the Pontifex Maximus Iulius Caesar, when his wife was       celebrating the mysteries of the Bona Dea, from which males were       excluded. His trial was made the occasion of bitter party       struggles, and by giving evidence in contradiction of Clodius's       alibi Cicero incurred his enmity, and eventually, therefore, his       own exile. Quintus is propraetor in Asia, Caesar in Spain. Pompey       reached Rome early this year. The _ordo equester_ is much irritated       with the senate on the question of the contracts for the collection       of the Asiatic taxes.      TO ATTICUS (IN EPIRUS)    ROME, 1 JANUARY    [Sidenote: B.C. 61, AET. 45]    The Teucris[66] business hangs fire, and Cornelius has not called on  Terentia since. I suppose I must have recourse to Considius, Axius, and  Selicius:[67] for his nearest relations can't get a penny out of  Caecilius[68] under twelve per cent. But to return to my first remark: I  never saw anything more shameless, artful, and dilatory. \"I am on the  point of sending my freedman,\" \"I have commissioned Titus\"--excuses and  delays at every turn! But perhaps it is a case of _l'homme propose_,[69]  for Pompey's advance couriers tell me that he means to move in the  senate that a successor to Antonius ought to be named, and the praetor  intends to bring the proposal before the people at the same time. The  facts are such that I cannot defend him in view of the opinion either  of the aristocrats or the people, and, what is more than anything else,  that I have no wish to do so. For a thing has happened into the truth of  which I charge you to look thoroughly. I have a freedman, who is a  worthless fellow enough; I mean Hilarus, an accountant and a client of  your own. The interpreter Valerius gives me this information about him,  and Thyillus writes me word that he has been told the same story: that  the fellow is with Antonius, and that Antonius, in exacting money  payments, frequently remarks that a part is being collected for me, and  that I have sent a freedman to look after our common interests. I felt  exceedingly disturbed, and yet could not believe it; but at any rate  there has been some gossip of the sort. Pray look into the whole matter,  learn the truth, find out the author, and get the empty-headed idiot out  of the country, if you possibly can. Valerius mentions Cn. Plancius as  the origin of this gossip. I trust you thoroughly to investigate and  find out what is at the bottom of it. I have good reason to believe that  Pompey is most kindly disposed to me. His divorce of Mucia is strongly  approved.[70] I suppose you have heard that P. Clodius, son of Appius,  was caught in woman's clothes at Gaius Caesar's house, while the state  function was going on, and that he was saved and got out by means of a  maid-servant; and that the affair is causing immense scandal. I feel  sure you will be sorry for it.[71] I have nothing else to tell you. And,  indeed, at the moment of writing, I am in considerable distress: for a  delightful youth, my reader Sosthenes, has just died, and his death has  affected me more than that of a slave should, I think, do. Pray write  often. If you have no news, write just what comes uppermost.    1 January, in the consulship of M. Messalla and M. Piso.    [Footnote 66: From expressions in the following letters it seems certain  that this refers to money expected from Gaius Antonius; but we have no  means of deciding whether or no Teucris is a pseudonym for some agent.  Cicero had undertaken to be the advocate and supporter of Antonius, and  though as an actual _patronus_ in court he could not take money, he may  have felt justified in receiving supplies from him. Still, he knew the  character of Antonius, and how such wealth was likely to be got, and it  is not a pleasant affair.]    [Footnote 67: Money-lenders.]    [Footnote 68: The rich and cross-grained uncle of Atticus. See Letter  X.]    [Footnote 69: Cicero quotes half a Greek verse of Menander's, [Greek:  tautomaton hemon], leaving Atticus to fill up the other two words,  [Greek: kallio bouleuetai], \"Chance designs better than we ourselves.\"]    [Footnote 70: Mucia was suspected of intriguing with Iulius Caesar.]    [Footnote 71: The chief festival of the Bona Dea (Tellus) was in May.  The celebration referred to here took place on the night between the 3rd  and 4th of December. It was a state function (_pro populo_), and was  celebrated in the presence of the Vestals and the wife of the consul or  praetor urbanus, _in ea domo quae est in imperio_. As Caesar was Pontifex  Maximus, as well as praetor urbanus, it took place in the _Regia_, the  Pontiff's official house (Plutarch, _Cic._ 19; Dio, xxxvii. 35).]          XVII (F V, 5)    TO C. ANTONIUS (IN MACEDONIA)    ROME, JANUARY    _M. Cicero wishes health to Gaius Antonius, son of Marcus, Imperator._      [Sidenote: B.C. 61, AET. 45]    Though I had resolved to write you nothing but formal letters of  introduction (not because I felt that they had much weight with you, but  to avoid giving those who asked me for them an idea that there had been  any diminution in our friendship), yet since Titus Pomponius is starting  for your province, who knows better than anyone else all that I feel and  have done for you, who desires your friendship and is most devotedly  attached to me, I thought I must write something, especially as I had no  other way of satisfying Pomponius himself. Were I to ask from you  services of the greatest moment, it ought not to seem surprising to  anyone: for you have not wanted from me any that concerned your  interests, honour, or position. That no return has been made by you for  these you are the best witness: that something even of a contrary nature  has proceeded from you I have been told by many. I say \"told,\" for I do  not venture to say \"discovered,\"[72] lest I should chance to use the  word which people tell me is often falsely attributed to me by you. But  the story which has reached my ears I would prefer your learning from  Pomponius (who was equally hurt by it) rather than from my letter. How  singularly loyal my feelings have been to you the senate and Roman  people are both witnesses. How far you have been grateful to me you may  yourself estimate: how much you owe me the rest of the world estimates.  I was induced to do what I did for you at first by affection, and  afterwards by consistency. Your future, believe me, stands in need of  much greater zeal on my part, greater firmness and greater labour.[73]  These labours, unless it shall appear that I am throwing away and  wasting my pains, I shall support with all the strength I have; but if I  see that they are not appreciated, I shall not allow you--the very  person benefited[74]--to think me a fool for my pains. What the meaning  of all this is you will be able to learn from Pomponius. In commending  Pomponius to you, although I am sure you will do anything in your power  for his own sake, yet I do beg that if you have any affection for me  left, you will display it all in Pomponius's business. You can do me no  greater favour than that.    [Footnote 72: The word (_comperisse_) used by Cicero in regard to the  Catilinarian conspiracy; it had apparently become a subject of rather  malignant chaff.]    [Footnote 73: Cicero is hinting at the danger of prosecution hanging  over the head of Antonius.]    [Footnote 74: Reading _tibi ipsi_ (not _ipse_), with Tyrrell.]          XVIII (A 1, 13)    TO ATTICUS (IN EPIRUS)    ROME, 27 JANUARY      [Sidenote: B.C. 61, AET. 45]    I have now received three letters from you--one by the hands of M.  Cornelius, which you gave him, I think, at Three Taverns; a second which  your host at Canusium delivered to me; a third dated, according to you,  from on board your pinnace, when the cable was already slipped.[75] They  were all three, to use a phrase from the schools of rhetoric flavoured  with the salt of learning, and illumined with the marks of affection. In  these letters, indeed, I am urgently pressed by you to send answers, but  what renders me rather dilatory in this respect is the difficulty of  finding a trustworthy carrier. How few of these gentry are able to  convey a letter rather weightier than usual without lightening it by  skimming its contents!
