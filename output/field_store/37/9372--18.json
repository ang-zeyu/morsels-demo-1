The Plebs are always in the  crushing majority. So the odd German mind jumped to the other  extreme and for a few months got ashamed of little daughters going  barefoot or playing with naked animal toys.           *       *       *       *       *    Gard had been able to warm up small sympathy for the modern military  authors and iron and blood philosophers whom he found in vogue in  Germany. On the other hand, cold water had unexpectedly been thrown  on the retreating Goethes and Schillers whom he had come to venerate  with grammar and lexicon. As the Germans were proving to be wide of  what his anticipations had set as a mark, he had begun a serious  course of reading not only about the modern race but about its  origins, curious to know of the early developments of this strange  people who belonged to civilization yet was so considerably and  constitutionally outside the realm of its Christian development.    In this study he became attracted to Charlemagne and that epoch. Of  them he had learned little at college. Of course the Germans had  \"bagged\" Charlemagne, as an Englishman would express it, in addition  to their other seizures right and left in the face of an indulgent,  even supine, world. But Gard discovered that while they had kept the  puissant Carolingian snatched to their breasts, the chivalrous side  of the great medieval evolution which ended in fostering the  romantic ideal of womanhood in its chastity, daintiness and colorful  spell, had never reached much east of his capital--Aix-la-Chapelle.  His heroic size, his practical religious pretensions and  assumptions, his campaigns to seize control of foreign lands--all  such Carolingian features and manifestations were imitated and  adopted as German _motifs_, but the corresponding gallant exaltation  of the gentler sex was not included. The polished courts of  self-denying love, the Troubadours, the salons, the refining  influences that gradually raised woman to her modern sovereignty of  a graceful liberty and charm, never characterized Deutschland.    Besides, women becoming idols through his own sexual restraint  compelled a self-sacrificing procedure that did not appeal to Fritz.  To him those many feminizing influences had naught to do with  strength in battle or in toil. They were dangerous, softening, and  coddled the elements of defeat. He wanted work and fighting and  children, always children, but with the lustful appetites of the  undisputed male.    His Berthas and Gretchens, who had been exceptional figures in the  warring camps of the ancient Teutons, were therefore only  transferred into a similar yet menial relation in the housed home.  And there they have typically remained--in its cook room and  nursery. The fact that the Buchers, though coming, as they boasted,  from one original, unmixed, stationary stock there in that middle  spot of old Europe, had displayed themselves as social and political  parvenus, led to Kirtley's reflecting:    \"The German thinks of a wife as in the kitchen, while a wife appears  to the Frenchman as in the salon, to the Briton, as in an English  garden.\"    So this gradual elevating of the sex toward an ethereal height in  all respects, toward pure associations which, through the epochs of  chaste saints, chivalry, gallantry, social freedom, were to uplift  men by the graces of lofty feminine enchantment, took place westward  of the Rhine. And Germany, if the sporadic Heine is excepted, had no  Shelleys, no Chopins, and scarcely any of that rare, delightful  perfume of human existence which western and southern mankind quite  typically adores as the ultimate extract of beauty because it is  associated with the spiritual elegance of womanhood....           *       *       *       *       *    On Kirtley's leaving that day, Von Tielitz and Messer showed  themselves generously ready to share their amorous acquaintanceship.  They insisted on his going with them sometime to the smallest,  quaintest inn in Dresden where they were at present cultivating  friendly relations with \"Fritzi.\" In short petticoats she served the  best hot sausages in Saxony. To an American student of life and  language in Germany she was pictured as absolutely necessary. For,  although originally from the Thuringian forest, she spoke the Saxon  dialect \"shockingly well.\"    Kirtley laughed it off as a part of the ribald fun.    The young Germans wound up their list of salutations with Der Tag!    \"What do you mean by Der Tag?\" he inquired. The others grinned  significantly.    \"Wait and see. It will be something _kolossal_.\" And they called out  after him:    \"Don't forget about Fritzi!\"    That night Gard, laden with heavy feelings, tumbled into his German  bed piled with its equatorial bolsters. Could Elsa marry a man like  Friedrich? Ought she to be permitted to? Could she really love him?  Wouldn't she be horrified if she knew fully about him? Or would she,  like German women in general, seem to care little about the morals  of her future mate? Likely, as Gard fancied, it was this knowledge  of him that sent her now and then in evident unhappiness to her  room.    She was a pure and very worth-while girl. He could not ignore that  her healthful, productive example was a stimulus to him. It would be  a sturdy prop in his long sensitive, susceptible physical  recovery--and afterward. Was it really not a kind of _duty_ to try  to save her from sharing the fate of Von Tielitz, and win her if he  could?          CHAPTER XIX    JIM DEMING OF ERIE, PAY.      The Americanization of the Bucher home Kirtley naturally thought  beyond all attempts. Its detestation of the low-born Yankee, with  only his sorry millions, seemed too deeply planted there, especially  in the brain and bosom of the Frau. Could Villa Elsa have been  transferred to the United States, such a viewpoint might perhaps  have been altered after a time. But this representative boorish  German family, stuck here on the rainy banks of the mid-continent  Elbe and so rooted and clamorous in the presumption that they and  their kind were eclipsing the earth--how impossible of any  conversion?    Gard had at first the idea of getting together some American  statistics and showing the Buchers a few facts. Then he saw this was  hopeless. They accepted nothing that did not come through their own  official channels. And why should he waste time on these obscure  people? Why should he undertake to upset their racial happiness?  Nobody, least of all he, could change their attitude about the  upstart Yankee and his upstart dollars. The Buchers held themselves  too far above mere money and its filth.    But the miracle was, nevertheless, to be accomplished, at least for  awhile, in a manner as simple as it was unlooked for. And this was  what happened.    One day, soon after Gard's disillusioning call on Von Tielitz, he  was grubbing in his attic among the ninth century roots of the  future super-luxuriant Teuton forest, when he heard Tekla's  woodchopper feet pounding their way upstairs. A card was thrust in.  James Alexander Deming, Erie, Pa. Well, of all the world! The next  moment he was there in the room, talkative, airy, sunny, dressed  with the obvious American consciousness of having just left the  hands of his fashionable tailor and haberdasher. Every section of  his black hair and tiny black mustache was plastered down as always  in correct position.    Making himself right at home with his newly acquired  cosmopolitanism, Jim explained how he was already settled in  Dresden for the winter.    \"You knew that the more I saw of this old Germany, the more I liked  it. My governor wrote me I could stay if I would try to learn  something and I thought of you. I said to myself, 'Kirtley is a  serious sort of chap. If I light down near him, it will be easier to  learn this confounded language they have got over here, and I will  be able to shine with it in Erie, Pay, and do the old folks proud.'    \"So I've got a teacher and a grammar and also a dictionary so big I  can't find anything in it--all ready to loop the loop. But first, of  course, I must run out and see you and see how you are getting on,  swimming in beer. Nothing is too good for us Americans, you know, so  my room in the hotel is right by the royal palace where I can see  the Crown Prince with his sword fall off his horse every morning at  ten. Gad, won't it be something to talk about when I get back to  good old Pennsylwanee?\"    Deming's \"old man\" was possessed of wealth derived from oil wells.  But although Jim's pockets had always been stuffed with money, he  had never been able to get through high school or enter college.  Hang it all, he didn't take to books like Kirtley and all such  intellectual boys. It was the fault of his dad and mam. They had  petted and spoiled him--an only child. It was too bad, but shucks,  he wasn't going to let it interfere with his happiness. So it was  money here and money there, and a host of friends who, like Gard,  could not help being fond of him.    Jim had seen the Kaiser and quaffed out of the largest hogshead on  the Rhine. He had been at a duel at Heidelberg where the chap with a  cut through his cheek asked for a mug of beer and blew the beer out  through the gash. He had swum in Lake Starnberg where Ludwig II had  drowned himself; had seen the cafe in Munich where the celebrated  Naked Culture was said to have originated; had bribed his way into  the villa at Mayerling where Rudolph of Austria and Marie had ended  that mysterious night of fatality. In short, he had done Germany  pretty thoroughly.    When, by his insistent questionings, he learned about the  comfortable and illuminating German home where Kirtley had installed  himself, and that there was a fine, serious young lady in it with a  harvest of straw-colored hair, he soon confessed, after"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/1995"],[0,"The Divine Comedy, Volume 1, Hell (#16)"],[1,"was not written until after 1314, the year of his death.    [3] The story of Jason, \"that ungodly wretch and no high-priest\"  who bought the high-priesthood from King Antiochus, is told in 2  Maccabees iv. Its application to the Pope was plain.    [4] \"He who rules France\" was Philip the Fair.      I know not if here I was too audacious that I only answered him  in this strain, \"Pray now tell me how much treasure our Lord  desired of Saint Peter before he placed the keys in his keeping?  Surely he required nothing save 'Follow me.' Nor did Peter or the  others require of Matthias gold or silver, when he was chosen to  the place which the guilty soul had lost. Therefore stay thou,  for thou art rightly punished, and guard well the ill-gotten  money that against Charles[1] made thee to be bold. And were it  not that reverence for the Supreme Keys that thou heldest in the  glad life still forbiddeth me, I would use words still more  grave; for your avarice saddens the world, trampling down the  good and exalting the bad. Of you shepherds the Evangelist was  aware, when she that sitteth upon the waters was seen by him to  fornicate with kings: that woman that was born with the seven  heads, and from the ten horns had evidence, so long as virtue  pleased her spouse.[2] Ye have made you a god of gold and silver:  and what difference is there between you and the idolater save  that he worships one and ye a hundred? Ah Constantine! of how  much ill was mother, not thy conversion, but that dowry which the  first rich Father received from thee!\"[3]    [1] Charles of Anjou, of whom Nicholas III, was the enemy. He was  charged with having been bribed to support the attempt to expel  the French from Sicily, which began with the Sicilian Vespers in  1282.    [2] Dante deals freely with the figures of the Apocalypse:  Revelation vii. The woman here stands for the Church; her seven  heads may be interpreted as the Seven Sacraments, and her ten  horns as the Commandments; her spouse is the Pope.    [3] The reference is to the so-called Donation of Constantine,  the reality of which was generally accepted till long after  Dante's time.      And, while I was singing these notes to him, whether anger or  conscience stung him, he violently quivered with both feet. I  believe, forsooth, that it had pleased my Leader, with so  contented look be listened ever to the sound of the true words  uttered. Thereupon with both his arms he took me, and when he had  me wholly on his breast, remounted on the way by which he had  descended. Nor did he tire of holding me clasped till he had  borne me up to the summit of the arch which is the passage from  the fourth to the fifth dyke. Here softly he laid down his  burden, softly because of the ragged and steep crag, that would  be a difficult pass for goats. Thence another great valley was  discovered to me.        CANTO XX. Eighth Circle: fourth pit: diviners, soothsayers, and  magicians.--Amphiaraus.--Tiresias.--Aruns.--Manto.--Eurypylus.--  Michael Scott.--Asdente.    Of a new punishment needs must I make verses, and give matetial  to the twentieth canto of the first lay, which is of the  submerged.[1]    [1] Plunged into the misery of Hell.      I was now wholly set on looking into the disclosed depth that was  bathed with tears of anguish, and I saw folk coming, silent and  weeping, through the circular valley, at the pace at which  lltanies go in this world. As my sight descended deeper among  them, each appeared marvelously distorted from the chin to the  beginning of the chest; for toward their reins their face was  turned, and they must needs go backwards, because they were  deprived of looking forward. Perchance sometimes by force of  palsy one has been thus completely twisted, but I never saw it,  nor do I think it can be.    So may God let thee, Reader, gather fruit from thy reading, now  think for thyself how I could keep my face dry, when near by I  saw our image so contorted that the weeping of the eyes bathed  the buttocks along the cleft. Truly I wept, leaning on one of the  rocks of the hard crag, so that my Guide said to me, \"Art thou  also one of the fools? Here pity liveth when it is quite dead.[1]    Who is more wicked than he who feels compassion at the Divine  Judgment? Lift up thy head, lift up, and see him [2] for whom the  earth opened before the eyes of the Thebans, whereon they shouted  all, 'Whither art thou rushing, Amphiaraus? Why dost thou leave  the war?' And he stopped not from falling headlong down far as  Minos, who seizes hold of every one. Look, how he has made a  breast of his shoulders! Because he wished to see too far before  him, he looks behind and makes a backward path.      [1] It is impossible to give the full significance of Dante's  words in a literal translation, owing to the double meaning of  pieta in the original. Qui viva la pieta quando e ben morta.  That is: \"Here liveth piety when pity is quite dead.\"    [2] One of the seven kings who besieged Thebes, augur and  prophet. Dante found his story in Statius, Thebais, viii. 84.      \"See Tiresias,[1] who changed his semblance, when from a male he  became a female, his members all of them being transformed; and  afterwards was obliged to strike once more the two entwined  serpents with his rod, ere he could regain his masculine plumage.  Aruns[2] is he that to this one's belly has his back, who on the  mountains of Luni (where grubs the Carrarese who dwells beneath),  amid white marbles, had a cave for his abode, whence for looking  at the stars and the sea his view was not cut off.

After her father had departed from life, and the city of  Bacchus had become enslaved, long while she wandered through the  world. Up in fair Italy lies a lake, at foot of the alp that  shuts in Germany above Tyrol, and it is called Benaco.[2] Through  a thousand founts, I think, and more, between Garda and Val  Camonica, the Apennine is bathed by the water which settles in  that lake. Midway is a place where the Trentine Pastor and he of  Brescia and the Veronese might each give his blessing if he took  that road.[3] Peschiera, fortress fair and strong, sits to  confront the Brescians and Bergamasques, where the shore round  about is lowest. Thither needs must fall all that which in the  lap of Benaco cannot stay, and it becomes a river down through  the verdant pastures. Soon as the water gathers head to run, no  longer is it called Benaco, but Mincio, far as Governo, where it  falls into the Po. No long course it hath before it finds a  plain, on which it spreads, and makes a marsh, and is wont in  summer sometimes to be noisome. Passing that way, the cruel  virgin saw a land in the middle of the fen without culture and  bare of inhabitants. There, to avoid all human fellowship, she  stayed with her servants to practice her arts, and lived, and  left there her empty body. Afterward the men who were scattered  round about gathered to that place, which was strong because of  the fen which surrounded it. They built the city over those dead  hones, and for her, who first had chosen the place, they called  it Mantua, without other augury. Of old its people were more  thick within it, before the stupidity of Casalodi had been  tricked by Pinamonte.[4] Therefore I warn thee, that if thou ever  hearest otherwise the origin of my town, no falsehood may defraud  the truth.\"    [1] The daughter of Tiresias, of whom Statius, Ovid, and Virgil  all tell.

[4] The Count of Casalodi, being lord of Mantua about 1276,  gave ear to the treacherous counsels of Messer Pinamonte de  Buonacorsi, and was driven, with his friends, from the city.      And I, \"Master, thy discourses are so certain to me, and so lay  hold on my faith, that the others would be to me as dead embers.  But tell me of the people who are passing, if thou seest any one  of them worthy of note; for only unto that my mind reverts.\"    Then he said to me, \"That one, who from his cheek stretches his  beard upon his dusky shoulders, was an augur when Greece was so  emptied of males that they scarce remained for the cradles, and  with Calchas at Aulis he gave the moment for cutting the first  cable.
