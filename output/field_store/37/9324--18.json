I have seen many  changes. I have seen my people possessors of this island, save a  small settlement which they had, even then, the folly to allow the  Spaniards to possess. I have seen them swept away by the oppressor,  my husband tortured and killed, my brothers burned alive, all that  I loved slain by the Spaniards. Now, it does my old eyes good to  see two of the race who will, in the future, drive those dogs from  these fair lands, as they have driven my people.\"    So saying, she returned into the hut.    The boy prepared at once to start, and the lads, wringing the hand  of the black who had been so kind to them, at once followed their  guide into the darkness. For some hours they walked without  intermission, sometimes going at a sling trot, and then easing down  again. Dark as was the night, their guide trod the paths without  hesitation or pause. The boys could scarce see the ground upon  which they trod, but the eyes of the native were keener than  theirs, and to him the way seemed as clear as in broad daylight.    After traversing for some miles a flat, level country, they began  to mount; and for about two hours ascended a mountain, thickly  covered with forest. Then the guide stopped, and motioned to them  that he could now go no further, and must rest for the present.    The boys were surprised at this sudden stop, for their guide had  gone along so quickly and easily that he taxed, to the utmost,  their powers of progression; while he, himself, never breathed any  harder than when walking upon the level ground. They had, however,  no means of interrogating him, for he spoke no language which they  understood.    Without a word, the lad threw himself down at full length, an  example which they followed without hesitation.    \"I wonder,\" Ned said, \"why he stopped.\"    \"Because he is tired, I expect,\" Gerald replied; \"or that he does  not know the exact spot upon which he is likely to meet the band;  and that he has taken us, so far, along the one path which was  certain to lead in the right direction, but for the precise spot he  must wait, till morning.\"    It was not many minutes before the three lads were fast asleep, but  with the first gleam of daylight the Indian boy awoke. Touching his  companions, he sprang to his feet, and without hesitation turned  off to the right, and climbed an even steeper path than any which  they had followed in the darkness. The trees grew thinner as they  advanced, and they were soon climbing over bare rock.    They saw now that they were near the extreme summit of one of the  hills. The boy, as they passed through the trees, had gathered some  dry sticks, and a handful or two of green leaves. Upon reaching the  top he placed these down upon the ground, and looked towards the  east.    The sun would not be up for another half hour, yet. The boy at once  began, with steady earnestness, to rub two pieces of stick  together, according to their way of kindling a fire. It was a  quarter of an hour before the sparks began to drop from the wood.  These, with some very dry leaves and tiny chips of wood, the Indian  boy rapidly blew into life; and then, with a very small fire of dry  wood, he sat patiently watching the east.    At the moment that the sun showed above the sea, he placed the  little fire in the heart of the pile of wood which he had  collected, threw the green leaves upon it, and blew vigorously  until the whole caught fire, and a wreath of smoke ascended above  them. For five minutes only he allowed the fire to burn, and then  at once extinguished it carefully, knocking the fire from each  individual brand. When the last curl of white smoke had ceased to  ascend, he stood up and eagerly looked round the country.    It was a glorious view. On the one hand, the wood-clad hills sloped  to the foot of the plain, covered with plantations, dotted here and  there with the villages of the slaves, and the white houses of the  overseers. At a distance could be faintly seen the towers of a  city; while beyond, the sea stretched like a blue wall, far as the  eye could see.    Inland the country was broken and mountainous; the hills being, in  all cases, thickly covered with trees. From two points, in the  heart of these hills, white smoke curled up, as soon as the smoke  of their fire died away. These, too, in a short time also ceased to  rise; and the boys knew that they were signal fires, in response to  that which their guide had made. The boy hesitated, for a minute or  two, as to the direction which he should take.    As, however, one of the fires appeared a good deal nearer than the  other, this probably decided him in its favor; and he started, in a  straight line, towards the spot where the smoke had curled up.  Another two hours' walking, and they entered an open glade; where  ten or twelve natives, and two or three negroes were gathered. They  were greatly surprised at seeing two white men, but the presence of  the native guide apparently vouched for these visitors; and  although one or two of the men sprang up and, at a rapid pace,  proceeded in the direction from which the newcomers had arrived,  the rest simply rose to their feet and, grasping the spears, bows  and arrows, and clubs which they carried, waited silently to hear  what the Indian boy had to tell them.    He poured forth an animated strain of words, for a few minutes, and  the faces of the Indians lit up with pleasure. The one among them  who appeared to be the chief of the party advanced at once to the  boys, and made every sign of welcome. One of the negroes also  approached, and in broken Spanish asked them if they could speak in  that language.    The boys were able, now, to reply in the affirmative; and quickly  supplemented the account of them, which had been given by their  guide, by their own description of the manner of their coming  there. The negro, after explaining to the rest what the boys had  said, then assured them, in the name of the chief, that every  welcome was theirs; and that they hailed among them, as a happy  incident, the arrival of two of the famous race who were the deadly  enemies of the Spaniards.    The boys, on their part, assured them that they would endeavor to  repay the hospitality with which they were received by their  assistance, should the Spaniards make any attacks upon the tribe  during the time they were there; that the English, everywhere, were  the friends of those who were oppressed by the Spaniards; and that  their countrymen were moved, with horror and indignation, at the  accounts which had reached them of the diabolical treatment to  which the Indians were exposed.    The party now pressed still further into the forest and, turning up  a ravine, followed its windings for some distance; and then,  passing through an exceedingly narrow gorge, reached a charming  little valley; in which were some rough huts, showing that the  residence of at least a portion of the runaways had been reached.    Here, for some time, life passed uneventfully with the boys. Their  first care was to study sufficient of the language of the natives  to enable them to hold converse with them, for it was clear to them  that they might have to stop there for some considerable time.  Their food consisted of roots, of wild fruit, and of yams; which  the natives cultivated in small, scattered plots of ground. Many  birds, too, were brought in, the natives bringing them down with  small darts. They were able to throw their light spears with  extreme precision, and often pierced the larger kinds of birds, as  they sat upon the boughs of trees, with these weapons, before they  could open their wings for flight. With bows and arrows, too, they  were able to shoot with great accuracy; and the boys felt sure  that, if properly led, they would be able to make a stout  resistance to the Spaniards.    They heard, several times during the first three weeks of their  sojourn there, of raids made by small parties of the Spaniards; but  in none of these cases were the searchers successful in finding  traces of the fugitive slaves, nor did they come into the part of  the wood in which was the village which served as headquarters of  the negroes.    At the end of three weeks, the boys accompanied a party of their  friends to other points at which the fugitives were gathered.  Altogether they found that, in that part of the island, there were  some hundreds of natives, with about forty or fifty runaway  negroes. Through the latter, the boys explained to the natives that  they ought to build strong places to which, in case of necessity,  they could retreat, and where they could offer a desperate  resistance to the enemy. The extreme roughness of the ground, the  deep ravines and precipices, were all favorable for defense; and  although they could not hope to make a permanent resistance to a  large armed force, yet they might easily resist small parties, and  then make good their retreat before large reinforcements could  arrive.    The negroes expressed their approval of the plans, but the Indians  shook their heads over the proposition.    \"These men have no courage,\" the blacks said to the boys. \"Their  heart is broken. They fly at the sound of a Spaniard's voice. What  good do you expect from them? But if the Spaniards come, we fight.  Our people are brave, and we do not fear death. If the Spaniards  come we fight with you, and die rather than be taken back as  slaves.\"    One morning, on rising, the boys heard some exclamations among  their allies.    \"What is it?\" they asked.    The negroes pointed to films of smoke, rising from the summits of  two hills, at a short distance from each other.    \"What is that a sign of?\" they asked.    \"It is a sign"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/19207"],[0,"The Firelight Fairy Book (#16)"],[1,"the bright sun shining on her silvery-white  sails, the Princess happened to be resting under a silken awning on the  roof of her palace. Catching sight of the ship, the Princess cried to  her companions:--    \"See what a fine ship is coming into port! She must be laden with many  wonderful things. Send word to the Captain that I intend to visit her  to-morrow morning.\"    The next morning, sure enough, the Princess paid a visit to the ship,  which lay at a wharf below the palace. In honor of the Princess's  coming, everything had been swept, scrubbed, and brightened, and  gorgeous carpets from the Eastern Islands covered the decks. In shaded  nooks, under costly tapestries, lay the treasures of the  cargo--wonderful cloths and spices from the Eastern Islands, vessels of  gold and silver from the Adamant Mountains, and jewels from the Desert  of the Moon.    Now scarcely had the Master Mariner set eyes on the Princess, than he  began to think her quite the most wonderful person he ever had beheld;  as for the Princess, scarcely had the Master Mariner directed two or  three respectful and somewhat tender glances in her direction, than she  began to believe him quite the most gallant youth she had ever seen. She  gave orders that several of the marvels be brought to her palace, and  was looking about for something else, when her eyes chanced to fall upon  the silver fish the Master Mariner was wearing.    \"Pray, what is that little silver fish?\" asked the Princess.    \"A mere trifle which a friend once gave me,\" replied the Master Mariner,  reading in the Princess's eyes and demeanor that she desired the  talisman. \"If Your Majesty will only deign to accept it, it is yours.\"    And blinded by the Princess's eyes, he gallantly, but somewhat  incautiously, took the silver fish from its chain and gave it to the  Princess, who laughed prettily, and accepted the gift.    Silver trumpets sounded, the servitors gathered up the treasures which  the Princess had chosen, and the royal party returned to the palace with  a good deal of chattering and laughter.    In a few days, the Master Mariner disposed of his cargo, and went again  to sea. But wherever he went, the image of the beautiful Princess of  Silk Land went with him.    Under the silken awning, on the wind-swept balcony, sat the Princess,  and the image of the young Captain was often in her mind.    After three months had passed, the Princess took it into her head that  it was time for the Master Mariner to return to Silk Land, and gave  orders that a sharp watch be kept from the tower of the palace for his  returning vessel. One morning, just as the Princess was having breakfast  in her wonderful silken bed, news was brought to her that a large ship  was headed for the harbor.    \"Is it the Master Mariner's ship?\" asked the Princess.    \"I do not know, Your Majesty,\" replied the messenger. \"The vessel is  still many miles out to sea.\"    So the Princess jumped out of bed, and without waiting for the ladies of  the bedchamber to dress her, ran upstairs to her balcony. A great ship  was coming in under a favoring breeze. Nearer and nearer it came, till  the Princess could even distinguish the men aboard. Suddenly she uttered  a little scream, and ran down stairs pell-mell. At the same moment the  bells of Silk Land all began to ring wildly, and the beating of drums  sounded through the town.    The approaching ship was a pirate ship! From the topmast flew the  terrible black flag of the pirates of the Northern Isles!    Great confusion followed.    Warned by the uproar of the bells and drums, the people came scurrying  through the streets to the palace; some carrying children in their arms;  others the best beloved of their household furnishings. The palace was  hastily made ready for a siege.    Soon, cursing and swearing, the black-bearded pirates arrived, and began  to sack the town. Into every house they went, pulling out all the bureau  drawers, reading private letters, upsetting the clocks, and leaving the  water running in the kitchen sinks. They filled their pockets with  cuff-links and watches.    Now, if the pirates had taken only the cufflinks, stick-pins, cameo  brooches, silver candlesticks, souvenir spoons, and sugar-tongs, and  then gone away, the raid would not have been too terrible; but the  rogues, bribed by the horrid old King of the Oyster Mountains, a  rejected suitor, were bent on getting possession of the Princess. On  discovering that she had locked herself up in the strong palace, their  rage knew no bounds. They made a dozen different attempts to break open  the palace door, but all in vain. Finally, they decided to besiege the  fortress.    For four days all went well enough with the Princess and her imprisoned  people; but by the sixth day most of the food had been eaten; and by the  end of the eighth day, the Princess knew she would have to surrender the  following morning. With a sinking heart she went to a turret and looked  out over the ocean in the hope of catching sight of a passing sail. But  she saw only the deserted town and the pirate ship riding at anchor in  the bay. An hour later she went to the turret again, and again she saw  no sign of anything at sea. A terrible despair seized upon her, but  nevertheless once more to the turret she climbed.    Far out at sea, headed toward land, was the brave ship of the Master  Mariner!    So great was the joy of the poor Princess at the sight of the gallant  vessel that she almost swooned; but recovering herself, like the  Princess that she was, she ran down into the courtyard and told the news  to her people. Immediately those who were weak or fretful from hunger  began to take heart, and all who could crowded to the barred windows.    The Master Mariner's vessel came riding into the port; the watchers saw  her drop anchor, saw the boats being lowered, and the sailors coming  ashore. Soon the pirates and the sailors were at it hammer and tongs; a  ceaseless clack clack of steel beating upon steel rose to the turrets of  the palace; there were dreadful duels in the alleyways and battles in  the public squares. Alas! just as the sailors were carrying the day, the  Master Mariner received a blow on the head which knocked him insensible,  and the mariners, disorganized by the loss of their chief, were soon  surrounded and taken prisoners. Then, taking heart, the pirates rushed  the palace, and burst open the doors.    When the rogues had taken everything on which they could lay their  hands, they brought the prisoners and the plunder to the marketplace.    \"Shall we bind all these people and take them aboard?\" asked a pirate.    \"No!\" roared the one-eyed pirate chief. \"Take only the Princess and that  rogue of a Master Mariner.\"    The people now began to cry, \"Oh, don't take the Princess, our dear  Princess!\" But all their prayers were useless.    Now, because the Master Mariner's ship was far more swift and beautiful  than the pirate ship, the pirates, after setting fire to their own  vessel, abandoned her, and put their plunder on board the Master  Mariner's vessel. The following morning, leaving the people of Silk Land  robbed and mourning, the pirates sailed away.    Within a few hours, all signs of land had disappeared. The sea was as  black as ink. Against the horizon's edge, the great waves were leaping  and breaking into foam.    \"Bring me the list of booty!\" cried the pirate captain, roaring the last  word.    So the pirate treasurer came on deck, and read a long list beginning,--    \"Fifty-three scarf-pins.\"    \"Hooray!\" shouted the pirate crew.    \"A hundred and eighty-five sterling silver berry-spoons,\" next announced  the treasurer.    \"Hooray!\" cried the crew again.    \"One thousand clocks!\" cried the treasurer.    \"How many with alarms?\" asked an old pirate anxiously.    There was a strained silence. The treasurer consulted his list.    \"Seven hundred and forty-nine,\" he answered.    \"Hooray!\" yelled the pirate crew.    When the list had been read (it took very nearly half an hour to do it)  the one-eyed captain cried, \"Bring forth the Master Mariner!\"    So the Master Mariner was brought forth, and thrown brutally against a  mast. The pirate chief put his arms akimbo, cleared his throat savagely,  and roared, \"So you thought you were going to punish me, did you! Well,  I'll show you what happens to people who upset my plans. Here, Hawk Eye,  and you, Toby, throw this fellow overboard.\"    Hearing this awful order, the Princess screamed and would have run to  the Master Mariner, had not rude hands restrained her.    Splash! the Mariner fell into the inky sea. Swift as a bird, his own  ship went by him; he saw the mocking face of the pirate chief leering at  him from over the rail; in a few minutes he was alone, all, all alone in  the wide, wide sea. For some time he swam about, and by great good luck  discovered a log of wood strong enough to bear his weight, floating near  at hand. Upon this he climbed, and there we shall leave him for the  present.    When the Captain had disappeared from sight miles behind, the pirate  chief walked over to the Princess, and looking at her, said sneeringly,  \"Well, my beauty, are you going to make up your mind to be the wife of  the King of the Oyster Mountains? I'm taking you to him, and mind now,  no fooling!\"    The Princess shrank from him with horror, and as she fell back, the sun  gleamed on the silver fish she was wearing at her throat. The chief made  a rude snatch at it; the Princess, however, was quicker than he, and hit  him a good box on the ear.    \"Ow!\" cried the chief, dancing up and down with rage. \"I'll fix you, you  ill-tempered minx. Here, somebody, tie this girl to the mast for the  rest of the day, and give her nothing but bread and water.\"    In obedience to his order, the Princess, with her arms tied by the  wrists behind her back, was lashed to the mast. When she had been  securely bound, the chief, whose"]]]
