I said to myself, \"Some one is building a house.\" From  what I had previously seen, I suspected the builder to be a red-headed  woodpecker, in the top of a dead oak stub near by. Moving cautiously  in that direction, I perceived a round hole, about the size of that  made by an inch-and-a-half auger, near the top of the decayed trunk,  and the white chips of the workman strewing the ground beneath. When  but a few paces from the tree, my foot pressed upon a dry twig, which  gave forth a very slight snap. Instantly the hammering ceased, and a  scarlet head appeared at the door. Though I remained perfectly  motionless, forbearing even to wink till my eye smarted, the bird  refused to go on with his work, but flew quietly off to a neighboring  tree. What surprised me was, that amid his busy occupation down in  the heart of the old tree he should have been so alert and watchful as  to catch the slightest sound from without.    The woodpeckers all build in about the same manner, excavating the  trunk or branch of a decayed tree, and depositing the eggs on the fine  fragments of wood at the bottom of the cavity. Though the nest is not  especially an artistic work,--requiring strength rather than  skill,--yet the eggs and the young of few other birds are so  completely housed from the elements, or protected from their natural  enemies--the jays, crows, hawks, and owls. A tree with a natural  cavity is never selected, but one which has been dead just long enough  to have become soft and brittle throughout. The bird goes in  horizontally for a few inches, making a hole perfectly round and  smooth and adapted to his size; then turns downward, gradually  enlarging the hole, as he proceeds, to the depth of ten, fifteen,  twenty inches, according to the softness of the tree and the urgency  of the mother bird to deposit her eggs. While excavating, male and  female work alternately. After one has been engaged fifteen or twenty  minutes, drilling, and carrying out chips, it ascends to an upper  limb, utters a loud call or two, when its mate soon appears, and,  alighting near it on the branch, the pair chatter and caress a moment;  then the fresh one enters the cavity and the other flies away.    A few days since, I climbed up to the nest of the downy woodpecker, in  the decayed top of a sugar-maple. For better protection against  driving rains, the hole which was rather more than an inch in  diameter, was made immediately beneath a branch which stretched out  almost horizontally from the main stem. It appeared merely a deeper  shadow upon the dark and mottled surface of the bark with which the  branches were covered, and could not be detected by the eye until one  was within a few feet of it. The young chirped vociferously as I  approached the nest, thinking it was the old one with food; but the  clamor suddenly ceased as I put my hand on that part of the trunk in  which they were concealed, the unusual jarring and rustling alarming  them into silence. The cavity, which was about fifteen inches deep,  was gourd-shaped, and was wrought with great skill and regularity. The  walls were quite smooth and clean and new.    [Illustration: WOODPECKER'S NEST. (Dotted lines indicate inside of  nest and eggs).]    I shall never forget the circumstance of observing a pair of  yellow-bellied woodpeckers,--the most rare and secluded, and, next to  the red-headed, the most beautiful species found in our  woods,--breeding in an old, truncated beech in the Beaverkill  Mountains, an off-shoot of the Catskills. We had been travelling,  three of us, all day in search of a trout lake, which lay far in among  the mountains, had twice lost our course in the trackless forest,  and, weary and hungry, had sat down to rest upon a decayed log. The  chattering of the young, and the passing to and fro of the parent  birds, soon arrested my attention. The entrance to the nest was on the  east side of the tree, about twenty-five feet from the ground. At  intervals of scarcely a minute, the old birds, one after another,  would light upon the edge of the hole with a grub or worm in their  beaks; then each in turn would make a bow or two, cast an eye quickly  around, and by a single movement place itself in the neck of the  passage. Here it would pause a moment, as if to determine in which  expectant mouth to place the morsel, and then disappear within. In  about half a minute, during which time the chattering of the young  gradually subsided, the bird would again emerge, but this time bearing  in its beak the ordure of one of the helpless family. Flying away very  slowly with head lowered and extended, as if anxious to hold the  offensive object as far from its plumage as possible, the bird dropped  the unsavory morsel in the course of a few yards, and, alighting on a  tree, wiped its bill on the bark and moss. This seemed to be the order  all day,--carrying in and carrying out. I watched the birds for an  hour, while my companions were taking their turn in exploring the lay  of the land around us, and noted no variation in the programme. It  would be curious to know if the young are fed and waited upon in  regular order, and how, amid the darkness and the crowded state of the  apartment, the matter is so neatly managed. But ornithologists are all  silent upon the subject.    [Illustration: THE YELLOW-BELLIED WOODPECKER.]    This practice of the birds is not so uncommon as it might at first  seem. It is, indeed, almost an invariable rule among all land birds.  With woodpeckers and kindred species, and with birds that burrow in  the ground, as bank swallows, kingfishers, etc., it is a necessity.  The accumulation of the excrement in the nest would prove most fatal  to the young.    But even among birds that neither bore nor mine, but which build a  shallow nest on the branch of a tree or upon the ground, as the robin,  the finches, the buntings, etc., the ordure of the young is removed to  a distance by the parent bird. When the robin is seen going away from  its brood with a slow, heavy flight, entirely different from its  manner a moment before on approaching the nest with a cherry or worm,  it is certain to be engaged in this office. One may observe the social  sparrow, when feeding its young, pause a moment after the worm has  been given, and hop around on the brink of the nest, observing the  movements within.    The instinct of cleanliness no doubt prompts the action in all cases,  though the disposition to secrecy or concealment may not be unmixed  with it.    The swallows form an exception to the rule, the excrement being voided  by the young over the brink of the nest. They form an exception, also,  to the rule of secrecy, aiming not so much to conceal the nest as to  render it inaccessible.    Other exceptions are the pigeons, hawks, and water-fowls.    But to return. Having a good chance to note the color and markings of  the woodpeckers as they passed in and out at the opening of the nest,  I saw that Audubon had made a mistake in figuring or describing the  female of this species with the red spot upon the head. I have seen a  number of pairs of them, and in no instance have I seen the mother  bird marked with red.    The male was in full plumage, and I reluctantly shot him for a  specimen. Passing by the place again next day, I paused a moment to  note how matters stood. I confess it was not without some compunctions  that I heard the cries of the young birds, and saw the widowed mother,  her cares now doubled, hastening to and fro in the solitary woods. She  would occasionally pause expectantly on the trunk of a tree, and utter  a loud call.    It usually happens when the male of any species is killed during the  breeding season, that the female soon procures another mate. There  are, most likely, always a few unmated birds of both sexes, within a  given range, and through these the broken links may be restored.  Audubon or Wilson, I forgot which, tells a pair of fish-hawks, or  ospreys, that built their nest in an ancient oak. The male was so  zealous in the defence of the young that it actually attacked with  beak and claw a person who attempted to climb into his nest, putting  his face and eyes in great jeopardy. Arming himself with a heavy club,  the climber felled the gallant bird to the ground and killed him. In  the course of a few days, the female had procured another mate. But  naturally enough the step-father showed none of the spirit and pluck  in defence of the brood that had been displayed by the original  parent. When danger was nigh, he was seen afar off, sailing around in  placid unconcern.    It is generally known that when either the wild turkey or domestic  turkey begins to lay, and afterwards to sit and rear the brood, she  secludes herself from the male, who then, very sensibly, herds with  others of his sex, and betakes himself to haunts of his own till male  and female, old and young, meet again on common ground, late in the  fall. But rob the sitting bird of her eggs, or destroy her tender  young, and she immediately sets out in quest of a male, who is no  laggard when he hears her call. The same is true of ducks and other  aquatic fowls. The propagating instinct is strong, and surmounts all  ordinary difficulties. No doubt the widowhood I had caused in the case  of the woodpeckers was of short duration, and chance brought, or the  widow drummed up, some forlorn male, who was not dismayed by the  prospect of having a large family of half grown birds on his hands at  the outset.    I have seen a fine cock robin paying assiduous addresses to a female  bird as late as the middle of July; and I have no doubt that his  intentions were honorable. I watched the pair for half an hour. The  hen, I took it, was in the market for the second time that season; but  the cock, from his bright, unfaded plumage, looked like a new arrival.  The hen resented every advance of the"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/18281"],[0,"An Account of the Proceedings on the Trial of Susan B. Anthony, on the Charge of (#16)"],[1,"ates, and that all proceedings under the act are  void.    I claim therefore that the defendant is entitled to a new trial.    First--Because she has been denied her right of trial by jury.    Second--Because she has been denied the right to ask the jury severally  whether they assented to the verdict which the court had recorded for  them.    Third--Because the court erroneously held, that the defendant had not a  lawful right to vote.    Fourth--Because the court erroneously held, that if the defendant, when  she voted, did so in good faith, believing that she had a right to vote,  that fact constituted no defence.    Fifth--Because the court erroneously held that the question, whether the  defendant, at the time of voting knew that she had not a right to vote,  was a question of law to be decided by the court, and not a question of  fact to be decided by the jury.    Sixth--Because the court erred in holding that it was a presumption of  law that the defendant knew that she was not a legal voter, although in  fact she had not that knowledge.    Seventh--Because congress had no constitutional right to pass the act  under which the defendant was indicted, and the act and all proceedings  under it are void.    Sir, so far as my information in regard to legal proceedings extends,  this is the only court in any country where trial by jury exists, in  which the decisions that are made in the haste and sometimes confusion  of such trials, are not subject to review before any other tribunal. I  believe that to the decisions of this court, in criminal cases, no  review is allowed, except in the same court in the informal way in which  I now ask your honor to review the decisions made on this trial. This is  therefore the court of last resort, and I hope your honor will give to  these, as they appear to me, grave questions, such careful and  deliberate consideration as is due to them from such final tribunal.    If a new trial shall be denied to the defendant, it will be no  consolation to her to be dismissed with a slight penalty, leaving the  stigma resting upon her name, of conviction for an offence, of which she  claims to be, and I believe is, as innocent as the purest of the  millions of male voters who voted at the same election, are innocent of  crime in so voting. If she is in fact guilty of the crime with which she  stands charged, and of which she has been convicted by the court, she  deserves the utmost penalty which the court under the law has power to  impose; if she is not guilty she should be acquitted, and not declared  upon the records of this high court guilty of a crime she never  committed.    The court after hearing the district attorney, denied the motion.    JUDGE HUNT--(Ordering the defendant to stand up), \"Has the prisoner  anything to say why sentence shall not be pronounced?\"    MISS ANTHONY--Yes, your honor, I have many things to say; for in your  ordered verdict of guilty, you have trampled under foot every vital  principle of our government. My natural rights, my civil rights, my  political rights, my judicial rights, are all alike ignored. Robbed of  the fundamental privilege of citizenship, I am degraded from the status  of a citizen to that of a subject; and not only myself individually, but  all of my sex, are, by your honor's verdict, doomed to political  subjection under this, so-called, form of government.    JUDGE HUNT--The Court cannot listen to a rehearsal of arguments the  prisoner's counsel has already consumed three hours in presenting.    MISS ANTHONY--May it please your honor, I am not arguing the question,  but simply stating the reasons why sentence cannot, in justice, be  pronounced against me. Your denial of my citizen's right to vote, is the  denial of my right of consent as one of the governed, the denial of my  right of representation as one of the taxed, the denial of my right to a  trial by a jury of my peers, as an offender against law, therefore, the  denial of my sacred rights to life, liberty, property and--    JUDGE HUNT--The Court cannot allow the prisoner to go on.    MISS ANTHONY--But your honor will not deny me this one and only poor  privilege of protest against this high-handed outrage upon my citizen's  rights. May it please the Court to remember that since the day of my  arrest last November, this is the first time that either myself or any  person of my disfranchised class has been allowed a word of defense  before judge or jury--    JUDGE HUNT--The prisoner must sit down--the Court cannot allow it.    MISS ANTHONY--All of my prosecutors, from the 8th ward corner grocery  politician, who entered the complaint, to the United States Marshal,  Commissioner, District Attorney, District Judge, your honor on the  bench, not one is my peer, but each and all are my political sovereigns;  and had your honor submitted my case to the jury, as was clearly your  duty, even then I should have had just cause of protest, for not one of  those men was my peer; but, native or foreign born, white or black, rich  or poor, educated or ignorant, awake or asleep, sober or drunk, each and  every man of them was my political superior; hence, in no sense, my  peer. Even, under such circumstances, a commoner of England, tried  before a jury of Lords, would have far less cause to complain than  should I, a woman, tried before a jury of men. Even my counsel, the Hon.  Henry R. Selden, who has argued my cause so ably, so earnestly, so  unanswerably before your honor, is my political sovereign. Precisely as  no disfranchised person is entitled to sit upon a jury, and no woman is  entitled to the franchise, so, none but a regularly admitted lawyer is  allowed to practice in the courts, and no woman can gain admission to  the bar--hence, jury, judge, counsel, must all be of the superior class.    JUDGE HUNT--The Court must insist--the prisoner has been tried according  to the established forms of law.    MISS ANTHONY--Yes, your honor, but by forms of law all made by men,  interpreted by men, administered by men, in favor of men, and against  women; and hence, your honor's ordered verdict of guilty, against a  United States citizen for the exercise of \"_that citizen's right to  vote_,\" simply because that citizen was a woman and not a man. But,  yesterday, the same man made forms of law, declared it a crime  punishable with $1,000 fine and six months' imprisonment, for you, or  me, or any of us, to give a cup of cold water, a crust of bread, or a  night's shelter to a panting fugitive as he was tracking his way to  Canada. And every man or woman in whose veins coursed a drop of human  sympathy violated that wicked law, reckless of consequences, and was  justified in so doing. As then, the slaves who got their freedom must  take it over, or under, or through the unjust forms of law, precisely  so, now, must women, to get their right to a voice in this government,  take it; and I have taken mine, and mean to take it at every possible  opportunity.    JUDGE HUNT--The Court orders the prisoner to sit down. It will not allow  another word.    MISS ANTHONY--When I was brought before your honor for trial, I hoped  for a broad and liberal interpretation of the Constitution and its  recent amendments, that should declare all United States citizens under  its protecting aegis--that should declare equality of rights the national  guarantee to all persons born or naturalized in the United States. But  failing to get this justice--failing, even, to get a trial by a jury  _not_ of my peers--I ask not leniency at your hands--but rather the full  rigors of the law.    JUDGE HUNT--The Court must insist--    (Here the prisoner sat down.)    JUDGE HUNT--The prisoner will stand up.    (Here Miss Anthony arose again.)    The sentence of the Court is that you pay a fine of one hundred dollars  and the costs of the prosecution.    MISS ANTHONY--May it please your honor, I shall never pay a dollar of  your unjust penalty. All the stock in trade I possess is a $10,000 debt,  incurred by publishing my paper--_The Revolution_--four years ago, the  sole object of which was to educate all women to do precisely as I have  done, rebel against your man-made, unjust, unconstitutional forms of  law, that tax, fine, imprison and hang women, while they deny them the  right of representation in the government; and I shall work on with  might and main to pay every dollar of that honest debt, but not a penny  shall go to this unjust claim. And I shall earnestly and persistently  continue to urge all women to the practical recognition of the old  revolutionary maxim, that \"Resistance to tyranny is obedience to God.\"    JUDGE HUNT--Madam, the Court will not order you committed until the fine  is paid.           *       *       *    INDICTMENT AGAINST BEVERLY W.
