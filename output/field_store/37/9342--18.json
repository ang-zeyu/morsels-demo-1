Spirit of Tiny  Tim, thy childish essence was from God!    \"Spectre,\" said Scrooge, \"something informs me that our parting moment  is at hand. I know it, but I know not how. Tell me what man that was  whom we saw lying dead?\"    The Ghost of Christmas Yet To Come conveyed him, as before--though at a  different time, he thought: indeed, there seemed no order in these  latter visions, save that they were in the Future--into the resorts of  business men, but showed him not himself. Indeed, the Spirit did not  stay for anything, but went straight on, as to the end just now desired,  until besought by Scrooge to tarry for a moment.    \"This court,\" said Scrooge, \"through which we hurry now, is where my  place of occupation is, and has been for a length of time. I see the  house. Let me behold what I shall be in days to come.\"    The Spirit stopped; the hand was pointed elsewhere.    \"The house is yonder,\" Scrooge exclaimed. \"Why do you point away?\"    The inexorable finger underwent no change.    Scrooge hastened to the window of his office, and looked in. It was an  office still, but not his. The furniture was not the same, and the  figure in the chair was not himself. The Phantom pointed as before.    He joined it once again, and, wondering why and whither he had gone,  accompanied it until they reached an iron gate. He paused to look round  before entering.    A churchyard. Here, then, the wretched man, whose name he had now to  learn, lay underneath the ground. It was a worthy place. Walled in by  houses; overrun by grass and weeds, the growth of vegetation's death,  not life; choked up with too much burying; fat with repleted appetite. A  worthy place!    The Spirit stood among the graves, and pointed down to One. He advanced  towards it trembling. The Phantom was exactly as it had been, but he  dreaded that he saw new meaning in its solemn shape.    \"Before I draw nearer to that stone to which you point,\" said Scrooge,  \"answer me one question. Are these the shadows of the things that Will  be, or are they shadows of the things that May be only?\"    Still the Ghost pointed downward to the grave by which it stood.    \"Men's courses will foreshadow certain ends, to which, if persevered in,  they must lead,\" said Scrooge. \"But if the courses be departed from, the  ends will change. Say it is thus with what you show me!\"    The Spirit was immovable as ever.    Scrooge crept towards it, trembling as he went; and, following the  finger, read upon the stone of the neglected grave his own name,  EBENEZER SCROOGE.    \"Am _I_ that man who lay upon the bed?\" he cried upon his knees.    The finger pointed from the grave to him, and back again.    \"No, Spirit! Oh no, no!\"    The finger still was there.    \"Spirit!\" he cried, tight clutching at its robe, \"hear me! I am not the  man I was. I will not be the man I must have been but for this  intercourse. Why show me this, if I am past all hope?\"    For the first time the hand appeared to shake.    \"Good Spirit,\" he pursued, as down upon the ground he fell before it:  \"your nature intercedes for me, and pities me. Assure me that I yet may  change these shadows you have shown me by an altered life?\"    The kind hand trembled.    \"I will honour Christmas in my heart, and try to keep it all the year. I  will live in the Past, the Present, and the Future. The Spirits of all  Three shall strive within me. I will not shut out the lessons that they  teach. Oh, tell me I may sponge away the writing on this stone!\"    In his agony, he caught the spectral hand. It sought to free itself, but  he was strong in his entreaty, and detained it. The Spirit, stronger  yet, repulsed him.    Holding up his hands in a last prayer to have his fate reversed, he saw  an alteration in the Phantom's hood and dress. It shrunk, collapsed, and  dwindled down into a bedpost.          STAVE FIVE    THE END OF IT      Yes! and the bedpost was his own. The bed was his own, the room was his  own. Best and happiest of all, the Time before him was his own, to make  amends in!    \"I will live in the Past, the Present, and the Future!\" Scrooge repeated  as he scrambled out of bed. \"The Spirits of all Three shall strive  within me. Oh, Jacob Marley! Heaven and the Christmas Time be praised  for this! I say it on my knees, old Jacob; on my knees!\"    He was so fluttered and so glowing with his good intentions, that his  broken voice would scarcely answer to his call. He had been sobbing  violently in his conflict with the Spirit, and his face was wet with  tears.    \"They are not torn down,\" cried Scrooge, folding one of his bed-curtains  in his arms, \"they are not torn down, rings and all. They are here--I am  here--the shadows of the things that would have been may be dispelled.  They will be. I know they will!\"    His hands were busy with his garments all this time; turning them inside  out, putting them on upside down, tearing them, mislaying them, making  them parties to every kind of extravagance.    \"I don't know what to do!\" cried Scrooge, laughing and crying in the  same breath; and making a perfect Laocooen of himself with his stockings.  \"I am as light as a feather, I am as happy as an angel, I am as merry as  a school-boy. I am as giddy as a drunken man. A merry Christmas to  everybody! A happy New Year to all the world! Hallo here! Whoop!  Hallo!\"    He had frisked into the sitting-room, and was now standing there:  perfectly winded.    \"There's the saucepan that the gruel was in!\" cried Scrooge, starting  off again, and going round the fire-place. \"There's the door by which  the Ghost of Jacob Marley entered! There's the corner where the Ghost of  Christmas Present sat! There's the window where I saw the wandering  Spirits! It's all right, it's all true, it all happened. Ha, ha, ha!\"    Really, for a man who had been out of practice for so many years, it was  a splendid laugh, a most illustrious laugh. The father of a long, long  line of brilliant laughs!    \"I don't know what day of the month it is,\" said Scrooge. \"I don't know  how long I have been among the Spirits. I don't know anything. I'm quite  a baby. Never mind. I don't care. I'd rather be a baby. Hallo! Whoop!  Hallo here!\"    He was checked in his transports by the churches ringing out the  lustiest peals he had ever heard. Clash, clash, hammer; ding, dong,  bell! Bell, dong, ding; hammer, clang, clash! Oh, glorious, glorious!    Running to the window, he opened it, and put out his head. No fog, no  mist; clear, bright, jovial, stirring, cold; cold, piping for the blood  to dance to; Golden sun-light; Heavenly sky; sweet fresh air; merry  bells. Oh, glorious! Glorious!    \"What's to-day?\" cried Scrooge, calling downward to a boy in Sunday  clothes, who perhaps had loitered in to look about him.    \"EH?\" returned the boy with all his might of wonder.    \"What's to-day, my fine fellow?\" said Scrooge.    \"To-day!\" replied the boy. \"Why, CHRISTMAS DAY.\"    \"It's Christmas Day!\" said Scrooge to himself. \"I haven't missed it. The  Spirits have done it all in one night. They can do anything they like.  Of course they can. Of course they can. Hallo, my fine fellow!\"    \"Hallo!\" returned the boy.    \"Do you know the Poulterer's in the next street but one, at the corner?\"  Scrooge inquired.    \"I should hope I did,\" replied the lad.    \"An intelligent boy!\" said Scrooge. \"A remarkable boy! Do you know  whether they've sold the prize Turkey that was hanging up there?--Not  the little prize Turkey: the big one?\"    \"What! the one as big as me?\" returned the boy.    \"What a delightful boy!\" said Scrooge. \"It's a pleasure to talk to him.  Yes, my buck!\"    \"It's hanging there now,\" replied the boy.    \"Is it?\" said Scrooge. \"Go and buy it.\"    \"Walk-ER!\" exclaimed the boy.    \"No, no,\" said Scrooge, \"I am in earnest. Go and buy it, and tell 'em to  bring it here, that I may give them the directions where to take it.  Come back with the man, and I'll give you a shilling. Come back with him  in less than five minutes, and I'll give you half-a-crown!\"    The boy was off like a shot. He must have had a steady hand at a trigger  who could have got a shot off half so fast.    \"I'll send it to Bob Cratchit's,\" whispered Scrooge, rubbing his hands,  and splitting with a laugh. \"He shan't know who sends it. It's twice the  size of Tiny Tim. Joe Miller never made such a joke as sending it to  Bob's will be!\"    The hand in which he wrote the address was not a steady one; but write  it he did, somehow, and went down-stairs to open the street-door, ready  for the coming of the poulterer's man. As he stood there, waiting his  arrival, the knocker caught his eye.    \"I shall love it as long as I live!\" cried Scrooge, patting it with his  hand. \"I scarcely ever looked at it before. What an honest expression it  has in its face! It's a wonderful knocker!--Here's the Turkey. Hallo!  Whoop! How are you? Merry Christmas!\"    It _was_ a Turkey! He never could have stood upon his legs, that bird.  He would have snapped 'em short off in a minute, like sticks of  sealing-wax.    \"Why, it's impossible to carry that to Camden Town,\" said Scrooge. \"You  must have a cab.\"    The chuckle with which he said this, and the chuckle with which he paid  for the Turkey, and the chuckle with which he paid for the cab, and the  chuckle with which he recompensed the boy, were only to be exceeded by  the chuckle with which he sat down breathless in his chair again, and  chuckled till he cried.    Shaving was not an easy task, for his hand continued to shake very much;  and shaving requires attention, even when you don't dance while you are  at it. But, if he had cut the end of his nose off, he would have put a  piece of sticking-plaster over it,"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/19354"],[0,"Lessons in Music Form (#16)"],[1," Nos. 8, 9, and 11 (first 24 measures), the  _second_ Part is unusually independent in character; completely  detached from Part III, and exhibiting no symptoms of leading into the  latter, as second Parts have commonly been observed to do.          CHAPTER XI.  ENLARGEMENT OF THE THREE-PART SONG-FORM.    REPETITION OF THE PARTS.--The enlargement of the Three-Part Song-form  is effected, in the majority of cases, by simply repeating the Parts.  The composer, in extending the dimensions of his original design,  resorts as usual to the most legitimate and natural means at his  disposal--that of _repetition_.  By so doing, he reinforces the  principle of Unity, and, instead of obscuring, places the contents of  his design in a stronger and more convincing light.  It is true that  the act of mere repetition involves the risk of monotony; but against  this the composer has an efficient safeguard,--that of _variation_.  He  may modify and elaborate the repetition in any manner and to any extent  that seems desirable or necessary, the only limitations being that the  identity of the original Part must be preserved beyond all danger of  misapprehension, and (as a rule) that the cadences shall not be altered.    The act of repetition is applied to the First Part alone, and to the  _Second and Third Parts together_; very rarely to the Second Part  alone, or to the Third Part alone.      EXACT REPETITIONS.--When Part I,--or Parts II and III together,--are to  be repeated without any changes, it is customary to employ the familiar  repetition-marks (double-bar and dots); with \"first and second ending,\"  if, for any reason, some modification of the cadence-measure is  required.  This is illustrated in the 7th Song Without Words; Part I is  repeated alone, and Parts II and III together; both repetitions are  indicated by the customary signs, and each has a double ending.  See  also, Schumann, op. 68, No. 1; Part I is repeated exactly, with  repetition-marks; Parts II and III are also repeated literally (all but  the very last tone in the lower part), but written out,--apparently  without necessity.  Also No. 2; the literal repetition of Part I is  written out; Parts II and III have the repetition-marks.      MODIFIED REPETITIONS.--The quality and extent of the changes that may  be made, in order to enrich the composition without altering its  structural design, depend, as has been intimated, upon the judgment and  fancy of the composer.  The student will find no part of his analytical  efforts more profitable and instructive than the careful comparison of  these modified repetitions with the original Parts; nothing can be more  fascinating and inspiring to the earnest musical inquirer, than thus to  trace the operation of the composer's mind and imagination; to witness  his employment of the technical resources in re-stating the same idea  and developing new beauties out of it,--especially when the variations  are somewhat elaborate.    It must be remembered that mere repetition (even when modified,--as  long as it can be proven to be nothing more than repetition) does not  alter the form.  A phrase, repeated, remains a phrase; _nothing less  than a decided alteration of the cadence itself_ will transform it into  a double-phrase (or period).  Similarly, a period, repeated, remains a  period, and does not become a double-period; and a Part, repeated,  remains the same Part.  Therefore, the student will find it necessary  to concentrate his attention upon these larger forms, and exercise both  vigilance and discrimination in determining which sections of his  design come under the head of \"modified repetition.\"    For an illustration of the _repeated First Part_, see the 9th Song  Without Words; Part I is a four-measure period (of two small phrases)  closing in the seventh measure; the following four measures are its  modified repetition.  For an example of the _repeated Second and Third  Parts_, see No. 48.  In No. 29, both repetitions occur, with  interesting changes; the repetition of Part I begins in measure 13;  that of Parts II and III in measure 35; the last 10 1/2 measures are a  coda.      {98}    THE FIVE-PART FORM.  The repetition of the Second and Third Parts  together is sometimes subjected to changes that are almost radical in  their nature, and therefore appear to modify the form itself.  These  important changes chiefly _affect the Second Part, when it reappears as  \"Fourth\" Part_.  When the alteration of the Second Part (that is, the  difference between Part IV and Part II) is sufficiently radical to  suggest the presence of a virtually new Part, the design is called the  Five-part Song-form.  The possible repetition of the First Part, it  will be inferred, does not affect this distinction in the least; it  hinges solely upon the treatment of the reproduction of _Part Two_.  For illustration:    [Illustration: Diagram of Parts.]      The Five-Part form is illustrated in the 14th Song Without  Words;--(first, number the measures; observe that the two endings of  Part I are to be counted as the _same measure_, and not separately;  they are both measure 8):--Part I extends to the double-bar, and is  repeated literally, only excepting the _rhythmic_ modification of the  final measure; Part II extends from measure 9 to 23; Part III, measures  24-35; Part IV, measures 36-47; Part V, measures 48-60; coda to the  end.  The comparison of Part IV with Part II discloses both agreement  and diversity; they are, obviously, _practically the same Part_, but  differ in key, in form, and in extent.  The comparison of Parts I, III,  and V reveals a similar condition, though the agreement here is much  closer, and each confirms the leading statement.    A more characteristic example will be found in the familiar F major  _Nachtstueck_ of Schumann, op. 23, No. 4, which see:--Part I extends  from measure 2 to 9 (after 1 1/2 measures of recitative introduction);  Part II, measures 10-13; Part III, measures 14-21; Part IV, measures  22-32; Part V, measures 33-40; codetta to end.  The Fourth Part bears  very little resemblance to the Second, and assumes rather the character  of a wholly independent Part.      GROUP OF PARTS.--In some, comparatively rare, instances, the  arrangement of perfect cadences is such that,--coupled with  independence of melodic formation and character,--the composition seems  to separate into _four or more individual sections_ or Parts, with or  without a recurrence of the First one; or into three _different_ Parts,  lacking the evidence of the return to the beginning.  When such  irregularities are encountered, or when any conditions appear which  elude or baffle natural classification among the Three-Part Song-forms  (simple or enlarged), the piece may be called a group of Parts.  The  use of this term is entirely legitimate, and is commended to the  student on account of its convenience, for all examples of the  Song-form which, _upon thoroughly conscientious analysis_, present  confusing features, at variance with our adopted classification.  Of  one thing only he must assure himself,--that the design is a  _Song-form_ (_i.e._ an association of _Parts_), and not one of the  larger forms to be explained in later chapters.  The definition is  given in Chapter IX (on page 84).    A fair illustration of the utility of the term \"Group of Parts\" is seen  in Schumann, op. 68, No. 18.  Others will be cited in the following  Lesson.      LESSON 11.--Analyze the following examples of the enlarged Three-Part  Song-form.  As before, the form of each Part should be defined, and  introductions and codas (if present) properly marked.  All of the given  examples belong to this chapter, but are not classified; it is  purposely left to the student to determine where repetitions occur, and  whether they are exact, or variated,--in a word, to decide which of the  above diagrams the composition represents.

GROUPS OF PARTS:    Chopin, _Mazurkas_, No. 3 (apparently five Parts, not counting  repetitions; Part V corroborates Part I, but the intervening sections  are too independent to be regarded as one long Second Part,--as would  be the case if this corroboration were Part III).

Another method of enlargement consists in associating two  different--though somewhat related--Song-Forms.  The practice was so  common in certain of the older dances, particularly in the minuet, that  this design is also known as the _Minuet Form_.      THE PRINCIPAL SONG.--The first division, called the principal song, is  either a Two-Part or a Three-Part Song-form,--most commonly the latter.  It is generally entirely complete in itself; the fact that another  division is to be added, does not affect its character, form, or  conception.      THE \"TRIO,\" OR SUBORDINATE SONG.--The division which follows, as second  song-form, was formerly called the \"Trio,\" and it has retained the name  in the majority of examples of this form, although the old custom that  gave rise to the term has long since been discontinued.
