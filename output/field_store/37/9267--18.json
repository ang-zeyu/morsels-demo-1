But the present arrangement  seemed to put an end to all such hopes, and, although grateful to the  squire for sending him to a good school, he wished, with all his heart,  that he had chosen some other way of manifesting his gratitude.    Four years passed quietly. James Walsham worked hard when at school,  and, during his holidays, spent his time for the most part on board the  fishermen's boats. Sometimes he went up to the Hall, generally at the  invitation of Mr. Wilks.    \"Why don't you come oftener, Jim?\" the latter asked him one day. \"Aggie  was saying, only yesterday, that you used to be such friends with her,  and now you hardly ever come near her. The squire is as pleased as I am  to see you.\"    \"I don't know,\" Jim replied. \"You see, I am always comfortable with  you. I can chat with you, and tell you about school, and about fishing,  and so on. The squire is very kind, but I know it is only because of  that picking Aggie out of the water, and I never seem to know what to  talk about with him. And then, you see, Aggie is growing a young lady,  and can't go rambling about at my heels as she used to do, when she was  a little girl. I like her, you know, Mr. Wilks, just as I used to do;  but I can't carry her on my shoulder now, and make a playfellow of  her.\"    \"I suppose that's all natural enough, Jim,\" Aggie's grandfather said;  \"but I do think it is a pity you don't come up more often. You know we  are all fond of you, and it will give us a pleasure to have you here.\"    Jim was, in fact, getting to the awkward age with boys. When younger,  they tyrannize over their little sisters, when older they may again  take pleasure in girls' society; but there is an age, in every boy's  life, when he is inclined to think girls a nuisance, as creatures  incapable of joining in games, and as being apt to get in the way.    Still, Jim was very fond of his former playmate, and had she been still  living down in Sidmouth with his mother, they would have been as great  friends as ever.    At the end of the fourth year, Richard Horton came back, after an  absence of five years. He was now nearly twenty, and had just passed as  lieutenant. He was bronzed with the Eastern sun, and had grown from a  good-looking boy into a handsome young man, and was perfectly conscious  of his good looks. Among his comrades, he had gained the nickname of  \"The Dandy\"--a name which he accepted in good part, although it had not  been intended as complimentary, for Richard Horton was by no means a  popular member of his mess.    Boys are quick to detect each other's failings, and several sharp  thrashings, when he first joined, had taught Richard that it was very  inexpedient to tell a lie on board a ship, if there was any chance of  its being detected. As he had become one of the senior midshipmen, his  natural haughtiness made him disliked by the younger lads; while, among  those of his own standing, he had not one sincere friend, for there was  a general feeling, among them, that although Richard Horton was a  pleasant companion, and a very agreeable fellow when he liked, he was  not somehow straight, not the sort of fellow to be depended upon in all  emergencies.    By the captain and lieutenants, he was considered a smart young  officer. He was always careful to do his duty, quiet, and gentlemanly  in manner, and in point of appearance, and dress, a credit to the ship.  Accordingly, all the reports that his captain had sent home of him had  been favourable.    Great as was the rage and disappointment which Richard had felt, when  he received the letter from his uncle telling him of the discovery of  his long-lost granddaughter, he had the tact to prevent any signs of  his feelings being visible, in the letter in which he replied. The  squire had told him that, although the discovery would, of course, make  a considerable difference in his prospects, he should still, if the  reports of his conduct continued satisfactory, feel it his duty to make  a handsome provision for him.    \"Thanks to my quiet life during the last ten years,\" the squire had  written, \"I have plenty for both of you. The estate will, of course, go  to her; but, always supposing that your conduct will be satisfactory, I  shall continue, during my lifetime, the allowance you at present  receive, and you will find yourself set down, in my will, for the sum  of twenty thousand pounds.\"    Richard had replied in terms which delighted the squire.    \"You see, the boy has a good heart,\" he said, as he handed the letter  to Mr. Wilks. \"No one could express himself better.\"    His companion read the letter over in silence.    \"Charmingly expressed,\" he said as he returned it. \"Almost too  charmingly, it seems to me.\"    \"Come, come, Wilks, you are prejudiced against the young fellow, for  that business with Aggie and young Walsham.\"    \"I hope I am not prejudiced, squire,\" his friend replied; \"but when I  know that a lad is a liar, and that he will bring false accusations to  shield himself, and when I know that he was detested by all who came in  contact with him--John Petersham, the gardener, and the grooms--I  require a good deal more than a few satisfactory reports from his  captain, who can know very little of his private character, and a  soft-soldering letter like that, to reinstate him in my good opinion. I  will wager that, if you and I had been standing behind him when he  opened your letter, you would have heard an expression of very  different sentiments from those he writes you here.    \"Look at this: 'I regret, indeed, my dear uncle, that my new cousin  must have such a bad opinion of me, owing to my roughness in that  unfortunate affair, which I have never ceased to regret; but I hope  that, when we meet, I shall be able to overcome the dislike which she  must feel for me.'    \"Bah!\" the old soldier said scornfully. \"I would lay all my pension, to  a shilling, that boy has already made up his mind that someday he will  marry Aggie, and so contrive to get the estates after all.\"    The squire burst into a good-humoured laugh.    \"It's well I don't take up your wager. Such ideas as that might occur  to you and me, but hardly to a lad not yet seventeen.\"    \"Well, we shall see,\" the other said, cooling down. \"I hope I may be  mistaken in him. We shall see when he comes home.\"    When he did come home, the old soldier could find but little fault with  the young man. He had a frank and open manner, such as is common to men  of his profession. He was full of life and anecdote. His manner to the  squire was admirable, affectionate, and quietly respectful, without any  air of endeavouring especially to ingratiate himself with him. Nor  could the ex-sergeant find anything to complain of in the young man's  manner towards himself. He took the first opportunity, when they were  alone, to say how glad he had been, to hear that his grandfather had  met with a friend and companion in his lonely life, and to express a  hope that the bad opinion, which he had doubtless formed of him from  his conduct when a boy, would not be allowed to operate against him  now.    But, though there was nothing he could find fault with, the old  soldier's prejudices were in no way shaken, and, indeed, his antipathy  was increased, rather than diminished, by the young officer's conduct  towards Aggie. It might be, of course, that he was only striving to  overcome the prejudiced feeling against him; but every time the old  soldier saw him with his granddaughter, he felt angry.    In point of fact, Aggie was disposed to like Richard, even before his  arrival. Six years had eradicated every tinge of animosity for that  shove on the sand. His letters had been long, bright, and amusing, and  with the mementos of travel which he picked up in the ports of India  and China, and from time to time sent home to his uncle, there was  always a little box with some pretty trinket \"for my cousin.\" She found  him now a delightful companion. He treated her as if she had been  seventeen, instead of eleven; was ready to ride or walk with her, or to  tell her stories of the countries he had seen, as she might choose; and  to humour all her whims and fancies.    \"Confound him and his pleasant manners!\" the ex-sergeant would mutter  to himself, as he watched them together, and saw, as he believed, in  the distance, the overthrow of the scheme he had at heart. \"He is  turning the child's head; and that foolish boy, James, is throwing away  his chances.\"    James, indeed, came home from school for the last time, two or three  weeks after Richard Horton's return. He was now nearly eighteen, and,  although a broad and powerful fellow, was still a boy at heart. He did  not show to advantage by the side of Richard Horton. The first time he  went up to the Hall, after his return, the latter had met him with  outstretched hand.    \"I am glad to meet you again,\" he said. \"I behaved like a blackguard,  last time we met, and you gave me the thrashing which I deserved. I  hope we shall get on better, in the future.\"    Aggie and her two grandfathers were present, and James Walsham  certainly did not show to advantage, by the side of the easy and  self-possessed young officer. He muttered something about its being all  right, and then found nothing else to say, being uncomfortable, and ill  at ease. He made some excuse about being wanted at home, and took his  leave; nor did he again go up to call. Several times, the old soldier  went down to Sidmouth to see him, and on one occasion remonstrated with  him for not coming up to the Hall.    \"What's the use?\" James said, roughly. \"I have got lots of reading to  do, for in two months, you know, I am to go up to London, to walk the  hospitals. No one wants me up there."]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/17770"],[0,"Christmas Stories And Legends (#16)"],[1,"skates they are, the  'Jolly Ramblers!'\"    \"You said no game fellow would use any other make,\" said Tom hotly.    \"O but that was nearly a year ago,\" said Ralph. \"I got a new pair of  skates for Christmas, too,\" he added, as if it had just occurred to  him, \"'Club House' skates, something new in the market just this  season. Just look at the curve of that skate, will you?\" he added,  lifting a foot for inspection, \"and that clamp that you couldn't shake  off if you had to! They're guaranteed for a year, too, and if anything  gives out, you get a new pair for nothing. Three and a half, they  cost, at Mr. Harrison's hardware store. I gave my 'Jolly Ramblers' to  a kid about your size. A mighty good little skate they are!\" And, with  a long, graceful stroke, Ralph Evans skated away.    And it seemed to Tom Reynolds that all his Christmas joy went skimming  away behind him. The sun still shone, the ice still gleamed, the  skaters laughed and sang, but Tom moved slowly on, with listless,  heavy strokes. The \"Jolly Ramblers\" still twinkled beneath his feet,  but he looked down at them no more. What was the use of \"Jolly  Ramblers\" when Ralph Evans had a pair of \"Club House\" skates that cost  a dollar more, had a graceful curve, and a faultless clamp, and were  guaranteed for a year?    It was only four o'clock when Tom slipped his new skates carelessly  over his shoulder and started up the bank for home. He was slouching  down the main street, head down, hands thrust deep into his pockets,  when, on turning a corner, he ran plump into--a full moon! Now I know  it is rather unusual for full moons to be walking about the streets by  daylight; but that is the only adequate description of the round,  freckled face that beamed at Tom from behind a great box, held by two  sturdy arms.    \"That came pretty near being a collision,\" said the owner of the full  moon, still beaming, as he set down the box and leaned against a  building to rest a moment.    \"Nobody hurt, I guess,\" said Tom.    \"Been down to the ice?\" asked the boy, eagerly. \"I could see the  skaters from Patton's store. O, I see, you got some new skates for  Christmas! Ain't they beauties, now?\" And he beamed on the despised  \"Jolly Ramblers\" with his heart in his little blue eyes.    \"A pretty good little pair of skates,\" said Tom, in Ralph's  condescending tone.    \"Good! Well I should guess yes! And Christmas ice just made o'  purpose!\" In spite of his ill humor, Tom could not help responding to  the warm interest of the shabby boy at his side. He knew him to be  Harvey McGinnis, the son of a poor Irish widow, who worked at Patton's  department store out of school hours. Looking at the great box with an  awakening interest, he remarked, kindly, \"What you been doin' with  yourself on Christmas day?\"    \"Want to know, sure enough?\" said Harvey, mysteriously, his round face  beaming more brightly than ever, \"Well, I've been doin' the Santy  Claus act down at Patton's store.    \"About a week ago,\" he went on, leaning back easily against the tall  building and thrusting his hands down deep into his well worn pockets,  \"about a week ago, as I was cleaning out the storeroom, I came on  three big boxes with broken dolls in 'em. Beauties they were, I kin  tell you, the Lady Jane in a blue silk dress, the Lady Clarabel in  pink, and the Lady Matilda in shimmerin' white. Nothin' wrong with 'em  either only broken rubbers that put their jints out o' whack and set  their heads arollin' this way and that. 'They could be fixed in no  time, I ses to myself, 'and what a prize they'd be fer the kids to be  sure!' For mom and me had racked our brains considerable how we'd  scrape together the money for Christmas things for the girls.    \"So I went to the boss and I asked him right out what he'd charge me  for the three ladies just as they wus, and he ses, 'Jimmie,' he ses  (I've told him me name a dozen times, but he allus calls me 'Jimmie'),  'Jimmie,' he ses, 'if you'll come down on Christmas day and help me  take down the fixin's and fix up the store for regular trade, I'll  give you the dolls fer nothin',' he ses.    \"So I explained to the kids that Santy'd be late to our house this  year (with so many to see after it wouldn't be strange) and went down  to the store early this morning and finished me work and fixed up the  ladies es good es new. Would you like to be seein' 'em, now?\" he  added, turning to the great box with a look of pride.    \"Sure, I'd like to see 'em,\" said Tom.    With careful, almost reverent touch, Harvey untied the string and  opened the large box, disclosing three smaller boxes, one above the  other. Opening the first box, he revealed a really handsome doll in a  blue silk dress, with large dark eyes that opened and shut and dark,  curling locks of \"real hair.\"    \"This is the Lady Jane,\" he said, smoothing her gay frock with gentle  fingers. \"We're goin' to give her to Kitty. Kitty's hair is pretty and  curly, but she hates it, 'cause it's red; and she thinks black hair is  the prettiest kind in the world. Ain't it funny how all of us will be  wantin' what we don't have ourselves?\"    Tom did not reply to this bit of philosophy; but he laid a repentant  hand on the \"Jolly Ramblers\" as if he knew he had wronged them in his  heart. \"That's as handsome a doll as ever I saw and no mistake,\" he  said.    Pleased with this praise, Harvey opened the second box and disclosed  the Lady Matilda with fair golden curls and a dress of \"shimmerin'  white.\" \"The Lady Matilda goes to Josephine,\" said Harvey. \"Josephine  has black hair, straight as a string, and won't she laugh, though, to  see them fetchin' yellow curls?\"    \"She surely ought to be glad,\" said Tom.    The Lady Clarabel was another fair-haired lady in a gown of the  brightest pink. \"This here beauty's for the baby,\" said Harvey, his  eyes glowing. \"She don't care if the hair's black or yellow, but won't  that stunnin' dress make her eyes pop out?\"    \"They'll surely believe in Santy when they see those beauties,\" said  Tom.    \"That's just what I was sayin' to mom this morning,\" said Harvey.  \"Kitty's had some doubts, (she's almost nine), but when she sees those  fine ladies she'll be dead sure mom and I didn't buy 'em. If I had a  Santy Claus suit, I'd dress up and hand 'em out myself.\"    Tom's face lighted with a bright idea. \"My brother Bob's got a Santa  Claus suit that he used in a show last Christmas,\" he said. \"Say, let  me dress up and play Santa for you. The girls would never guess who I  was!\"    \"Wouldn't they stare, though!\" said Harvey, delightedly. \"But do you  think you'd want to take time,\" he asked apologetically, \"and you with  a new pair of skates and the ice like this?\"    \"Of course, I want to if you'll let me,\" said Tom. \"I'll skate down  the river and meet you anywhere you say.\"    \"Out in our back yard, then, at seven o'clock,\" said Harvey.    \"All right, I'll be there!\" and with head up, and skates clinking, Tom  hurried away.    It was a flushed, excited boy who burst into the Reynolds' quiet  sitting room a few minutes later, with his skates still hanging on his  shoulder and his cap in his hand. \"Say, mother,\" he cried, \"can I have  Bob's Santa Claus suit this evening, please? I'm going to play Santa  Claus for Harvey McGinnis!\"    \"Play Santa Claus for Harvey McGinnis. What do you mean, child?\"    \"You know Mrs. McGinnis, mother, that poor woman who lives in the  little house by the river. Her husband got killed on the railroad last  winter, you know. Well, Harvey, her boy, has fixed up some grand  looking dolls for his sisters and he wants me to come out and play  Santa tonight,\" and Tom launched out into a long story about Harvey  and his good fortune.    \"He must be a splendid boy,\" said Mrs. Reynolds, heartily, \"and I am  sure I shall be glad to have you go.\"    \"And another thing, mother,\" said Tom, hesitating a little, \"do you  think grandma would care if I spent part of that five dollars she gave  me for a pair of skates for Harvey? He hasn't any skates at all, and I  know he'd just love to have some!\"    \"It is generous of you to think of it,\" said his mother, much pleased,  \"and you would still have two and a half for that little trip down to  grandma's.\"    \"But I'd like to get him some 'Club House' skates,\" said Tom. \"They're  a new kind that cost three dollars and a half.\"    \"But I thought you said the 'Jolly Ramblers' were the best skates  made?\" Mrs. Reynolds looked somewhat hurt as she glanced from Tom to  the skates on his shoulder and back to Tom again.    \"They are, mother, they're just dandies!\" said Tom blushing with  shame that he could ever have despised his mother's gift. \"But these  'Club House' skates are just the kind for Harvey. You see, Harvey's  shoes are old and worn, and these 'Club House' skates have clamps that  you can't shake loose if you have to. Then, if anything happens to  them before the year's up, you get a new pair free; and Harvey, you  know, wouldn't have any money to be fixing skates.\"    \"Well, do as you like,\" said Mrs. Reynolds, pleased with Tom's  eagerness, for such a spell of generosity was something new in her  selfish younger son. \"But remember, you will have to wait a while for  your visit to grandma.\"    \"All right, and thank you, mother,\" said Tom. \"You can buy the skates  down at Harrison's and I'm going over and ask Mr. Harrison if he won't  open up the store and get a pair for me for a special time like this.  I'm most sure he will!\" and away he flew.    That evening, at seven, as the moon was rising over the eastern hills,  a short, portly Santa Claus stepped out of the dry reeds by the river  bank and walked with wonderfully nimble feet, right into the McGinnis'  little back yard. As he neared the small back porch, a dark figure  rose to greet him, one hand held up in warning, the other holding at  arm's length, a bulky grain sack, full to the brim.    \"Here's yer pack, Santy,\" he whispered,"]]]
