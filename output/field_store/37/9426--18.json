What, then, was that quality, and what its       influence upon them?         \"Louis lived with his courtiers, not as a despot among his       slaves, but as the most accomplished of gentlemen among his       associates. The social equality was, however, always guarded       from abuse by the most punctilious observance, on their side,       of the reverence due to his pre-eminent rank. In that enchanted       circle men appeared at least to obey, not from a hard       necessity, but from a willing heart. The bondage in which they       really lived was ennobled by that conventional code of honor       which dictated and enforced it. They prostrated themselves       before their fellow-man with no sense of self-abasement, and       the chivalrous homage with which they gratified him, was       considered as imparting dignity to themselves.         \"Louis acknowledged and repaid this tribute of courtesy, by a       condescension still more refined, and by attentions yet more       delicate than their own. The harshness of power was so       ingeniously veiled, every shade of approbation was so nicely       marked, and every gradation of favor so finely discriminated,       that the tact of good society--that acquired sense, which       reveals to us the impression we make on those with whom we       associate--became the indispensable condition of existence at       Versailles and Marly. The inmates of those palaces lived under       a law peculiar to themselves; a law most effective for its       purposes, though the recompense it awarded to those who pleased       their common master was but his smile, and though the penalty       it imposed on those who displeased him was but his frown.\"          AMERICAN WAR-ENGINES.      The probabilities of a general war in Europe invest the subject of the  following paper with an unusual interest. It is worthy of notice that  America has furnished so large a proportion of the improvements in  war-engines of every description. Fulton's schemes are well known; we  all remember something of the guns invented by Perkins; there is a  gentleman now in daily conference with Mazzini and the revolutionary  committees, in London, who proposes the noiseless discharge of twenty  thousand missiles in a minute, by means of a machine invented in Ohio;  and we find in the _Times_ an abstract of a paper read at the  Institution of Civil Engineers, on the 25th of November, by our famous  countryman Colonel Colt, \"On the Application of Machinery to the  Manufacture of Rotating Chambered-Breech Fire-Arms, and the  Peculiarities of those Arms.\" The communication commenced with a  historical account of such rotating chamber fire-arms as had been  discovered by the author, in his researches after specimens of the early  efforts of armorers for the construction of repeating weapons, the  necessity for which appears to have been long ago admitted; and with the  attention of such an intelligent class devoted to the subject, it is  certainly remarkable that during so long a period so little was really  effected towards the production of serviceable weapons of this sort. The  collections in the Tower of London, the United Service Museum, the  Rotunda at Woolwich, Warwick Castle, the Musee d'Artillerie, and the  Hotel Cluny, at Paris, as well as some ancient Eastern arms brought from  India by Lord William Bentinck, demonstrated the early efforts that had  been made to produce arms capable of rapidly firing several times  consecutively, without the delay of loading after each discharge.  Drawings of these specimens were exhibited, comprising the match-lock,  the pyrites wheel-lock, the flint-lock, down to the percussion-lock, as  adapted by the author. Among the match-lock guns, some had as many as  eight chambers, rotating by hand. Some of the pyrites wheel-lock guns  had also as many as eight chambers, and rotated by hand; one of them,  made in the seventeenth century, had the peculiarity of igniting the  charge close behind the bullet, burning backwards towards the breech--an  arrangement identical in principle with that of the modern Prussian  \"needle gun,\" for which great merit has been claimed. The flint-locks  induced more determined efforts, but all were abortive, as the magazines  for priming and the pan covers were continually blown off on the  explosion of the charge. Indeed, from the earliest match-lock down to  the present time, the premature explosion of several chambers, owing to  the simultaneous ignition of the charges, from the spreading of the fire  at their mouths, had been the great source of difficulty. In some of the  most ancient specimens, orifices were provided in the butt of the barrel  for the escape of the bullets in case of explosion, whilst others had  evidently been destroyed by this action. In a brass model of a pistol of  the time of Charles II., from the United Service Museum, there was an  ingenious attempt to cause the chamber to rotate, by mechanical action,  in some degree similar, but more complicated than the arms constructed  by the author. The \"Coolidge\" and the \"Collier\" guns, both flint guns of  comparatively modern manufacture, exhibited the same radical defects of  liability to premature explosion.    The invention of Nock's patent breech, and the Rev. Mr. Forsyth's  introduction of the detonating or percussion guns, which latter  principle, with the necessary mechanical arrangements for the caps, was  essential to the safe construction of repeating fire-arms, constituted a  new era in these weapons.    Colonel Colt gave a detailed and interesting account of his experiments,  which resulted in the invention of his celebrated revolvers. His  communication, the first that had been brought before the institution,  by an American, was received with acclamations; and in the discussion  which ensued, in which our Minister, the Hon. Abbott Lawrence, Captain  Sir Thomas Hastings, R.N., Captain Sir Edward Belcher, R.N., Captain  Riddell, R.N., Mr. Miles, and the members of the council took part, the  most flattering testimony was given of the efficiency of the revolvers  in active service, and the strongest opinions as to the necessity of  their use in all frontier warfare; and that without this arm it was  almost impossible, except with an overwhelming force of troops, to cope  with savage tribes. The discussion was resumed at a meeting of the  Institution, held on the second of December.    A new, and, we understand, a very important invention, in this line, is  also described in the following interesting article by a contributor to  the _International_:      SKETCH OF THE PROGRESS OF INVENTION IN OFFENSIVE ARMS: JENNING'S RIFLE.    WRITTEN FOR THE INTERNATIONAL MAGAZINE,    BY W. M. FERRIS.    It may be justly considered that mechanical invention has been the most  prominent characteristic of history for the last four centuries. The  application of science to the useful arts has been pushed to an extent  of which preceding ages never dreamed. In poetry, in painting, in  sculpture, the great masters of ancient times are still the teachers of  mankind. But in all those arts which administer to the necessities,  increase the comforts, or multiply the enjoyments of men, the present is  marvellously in advance of every former age. Prominent among those arts  which have shared in this advancement, is that of war. At first sight it  may appear improper to distinguish as useful, improvements in the method  of taking life. But, experience and philosophy unite in teaching that  every improvement in military skill tends to render war less frequent,  and the nearer its operations approach to those of an exact science, the  more reluctant is each nation to engage in it, and the more careful not  to commit those offences which render a resort to it on the part of  other nations unavoidable.    We purpose to trace a brief sketch of the progress of invention in  offensive weapons, and more particularly in that class of fire-arms used  either in hunting or war, by a single individual, and generally  denominated small-arms, in contradistinction to artillery. Such a sketch  will be interesting, not only in its subject-matter, but also as a  chapter in the general history of human progress.    The learned reader who is curious in such matters, will find in the  Natural History of Pliny (vol. vii. cap. 56, 67), a statement of the  source whence originated most of the mechanical implements, the manners  and customs, and the political and religious institutions known in the  author's time. It is to be presumed that Pliny did not intend to vouch  for the truth of all he has there stated. He probably meant merely to  give a synopsis of the traditions most generally received, and which  assigned to a divine energy almost every thing that contributed to the  happiness of men. He tells us here that \"the first combats were made by  the Africans against the Egyptians with "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/2096"],[0,"A Smaller History of Greece: from the Earliest Times to the Roman Conquest (#16)"],[1,"in it by deeds of daring bravery.  At  length she turned and fled, pursued by an Athenian galley.  Full in her  course lay the vessel of a Carian prince.  Instead of avoiding, she  struck and sunk it, sending her countryman and all his crew to the  bottom.  The captain of the Athenian galley, believing from this act  that she was a deserter from the Persian cause, suffered her to escape.  Xerxes, who from his lofty throne beheld the feat of the Halicarnassian  queen, but who imagined that the sunken ship belonged to the Greeks,  was filled with admiration at her courage, and exclaimed--\"My men are  become women, my women men!\"    Two hundred of the Persian ships were destroyed and sunk when night put  an end to the engagement.  But notwithstanding this loss the fleet was  still formidable by its numbers.  The Greeks themselves did not regard  the victory as decisive, and prepared to renew the combat.  But the  pusillanimity of Xerxes relieved them from all further anxiety.  He  became alarmed for his own personal safety; and his whole care was now  centred on securing his retreat by land.  The best troops were  disembarked from the ships, and marched towards the Hellespont, in  order to secure the bridge, whilst the fleet itself was ordered to make  for Asia. These dispositions of Xerxes were prompted by Mardonius.  He  represented to his master that the defeat, after all, was but slight;  that having attained one of the great objects of the expedition by the  capture of Athens, he might now retire with honour, and even with  glory; and that for the rest he (Mardonius) would undertake to complete  the conquest of Greece with 300,000 men.  While the Persian fleet  sailed towards Asia, Xerxes set out on his homeward march.  In Thessaly  Mardonius selected the 300,000 men with whom he proposed to conclude  the war; but as autumn was now approaching, he resolved to postpone all  further operations till the spring.    After forty-five days' march from Attica, Xerxes again reached the  shores of the Hellespont, with a force greatly diminished by famine and  pestilence.  On the Hellespont he found his fleet, but the bridge had  been washed away by storms.  Landed on the shores of Asia, the Persian  army at length obtained abundance of provisions, and contracted new  maladies by the sudden change from privation to excess.  Thus  terminated this mighty but unsuccessful expedition.    Greece owed its salvation to one man--Themistocles, This was virtually  admitted by the leaders of the other Grecian states, when they  assembled to assign the prizes of wisdom and conduct. Upon the altar of  Poseidon, at the isthmus of Corinth, each chief deposited a ticket  inscribed with two names, of those whom he considered entitled to the  first and second prizes.  But in this adjudication vanity and self-love  defeated their own objects. Each commander had put down his own name  for the first prize; for the second, a great majority preponderated in  favour of Themistocles.  From the Spartans, also, Themistocles received  the honours due to his merit.  A crown of olive was conferred upon him,  together with one of the most splendid chariots which the city could  produce.    On the very same day on which the Persians were defeated at Salamis the  Sicilian Greeks also obtained a victory over the Carthaginians.  There  is reason to believe that the invasion of Sicily by the Carthaginians  was concerted with Xerxes, and that the simultaneous attach on two  distinct Grecian peoples, by two immense armaments, was not merely the  result of chance.  Gelon, the powerful ruler of Syracuse, defeated  Hamilcar, the Carthaginian general, with the loss it is said of 150,000  men.    In the spring of B.C. 479 Mardonius prepared to open the campaign.  He  was not without hopes of inducing the Athenians to join the Persian  alliance, and he despatched Alexander, king of Macedon, to conciliate  the Athenians, now partially re-established in their dilapidated city.  His offers on the part of the Persians were of the most seductive kind;  but the Athenians dismissed him with a positive refusal, whilst to the  Lacedaemonians they protested that no temptations, however great,  should ever induce them to desert the common cause of Greece and  freedom.  In return for this disinterested conduct all they asked was  that a Peloponnesian army should be sent into Boeotia for the defence  of the Attic frontier:  a request which the Spartan envoys promised to  fulfil.  No sooner, however, had they returned into their own country  than this promise was completely forgotten.    When Mardonius was informed that the Athenians had rejected his  proposal, he immediately marched against Athens, accompanied by all his  Grecian allies; and in May or June, B.C. 479, about ten months after  the retreat of Xerxes, the Persians again occupied that city.  With  feelings of bitter indignation against their faithless allies, the  Athenians saw themselves once more compelled to remove to Salamis.  Mardonius took advantage of his situation to endeavour once more to win  them to his alliance. Through a Hellespontine Greek, the same  favourable conditions were again offered to them, but were again  refused.  One voice alone, that of the senator Lycidas, broke the  unanimity of the assembly.  But his opposition cost him his life.  He  and his family were stoned to death by the excited populace.  In this  desperate condition the Athenians sent ambassadors to the Spartans to  remonstrate against their breach of faith, and to intimate that  necessity might at length compel them to listen to the proposals of the  enemy.  The Spartans became alarmed. That very night 5000 citizens,  each attended by seven Helots, were despatched to the frontiers; and  these were shortly followed by 5000 Lacedaemonian Perioeci, each  attended by one light-armed Helot.  Never before had the Spartans sent  so large a force into the field.  Their example was followed by other  Peloponnesian cities; and the Athenian envoys returned to Salamis with  the joyful news that a large army was preparing to march against the  enemy, under the command of Pausanias, who acted as regent for the  infant son of Leonidas.    Mardonius, on learning the approach of the Lacedaemonians, abandoned  Attica and crossed into Boeotia.  He finally took up a position on the  left bank of the Asopus, and not far from the town of Plataea.  Here he  caused a camp to be constructed of ten furlongs square, and fortified  with barricades and towers. Meanwhile the Grecian army continued to  receive reinforcements from the different states, and by the time it  reached Boeotia, it formed a grand total of about 110,000 men.  After  several days' manoeuvring a general battle took place near Plataea.  The light-armed undisciplined Persians, whose bodies were unprotected  by armour, maintained a very unequal combat against the serried ranks,  the long spears, and the mailed bodies of the Spartan phalanx.  Mardonius, at the head of his body-guard of 1000 picked men, and  conspicuous by his white charger, was among the foremost in the fight,  till struck down by the hand of a Spartan.  The fall of their general  was the signal for flight to the Persians, already wearied and  disheartened by the fruitless contest; nor did they once stop till they  lad again crossed the Asopus and reached their fortified camp.  The  glory of having defeated the Persians at Plataea rests with the  Lacedaemonians, since the Athenians were engaged in another part of the  field with the Thebans.  After repulsing the Thebans, the Athenians  joined the Lacedaemonians, who had pursued the Persians as far as their  fortified camp.  Upon the arrival of the Athenians the barricades were  stormed and carried, after a gallant resistance on the part of the  Persians.  The camp became a scene of the most horrible carnage.  The  Persian loss was immense, while that of the Greeks seems not to have  exceeded 1300 or 1400 men.    It remained to bury the dead and divide the booty, and so great was the  task that ten days were consumed in it.  The booty was ample and  magnificent.  Gold and silver coined, as well as in plate and trinkets,  rich vests and carpets, ornamented arms, horses, camels--in a word, all  the magnificence of Eastern luxury.  The failure of the Persian  expedition was completed by the destruction of their naval armament.  Laotychides, the Spartan admiral, having sailed across the AEgean,  found the Persian fleet at Mycale a promontory of Asia Minor near  Miletus. Their former reverses seem completely to have discouraged the  Persians from hazarding another naval engagement.  The ships were  hauled ashore and surrounded with a rampart, whilst an army of 60,000  Persians lined the coast for their defence.  The Greeks landed on the  very day on which the battle of Plataea was fought. A supernatural  presentiment of that decisive victory, conveyed by a herald's staff  which floated over the AEgean from the shores of Greece, is said to  have pervaded the Grecian ranks at Mycale as they marched to the  attack.  The Persians did not long resist: they turned their backs and  fled to their fortifications, pursued by the Greeks, who entered them  almost simultaneously.  A large number of the Persians perished; and  the victory was rendered still more decisive by the burning of the  fleet.    The Grecian fleet now sailed towards the Hellespont with the view of  destroying the bridge; but hearing that it no longer existed,  Leotychides departed homewards with the Peloponnesian vessels.  Xanthippus however, the Athenian commander, seized the opportunity to  recover from the Persians the Thracian Chersonese, which had long been  an Athenian possession; and proceeded to blockade Sestos, the key of  the strait.  This city surrendered in the autumn, after a protracted  siege, whereupon the Athenians returned home, carrying with them the  cables of the bridge across the Hellespont,"]]]
