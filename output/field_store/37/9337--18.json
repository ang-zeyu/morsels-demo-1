Notes by Joseph H. Hannen    A meeting such as this seems like a beautiful cluster of precious  jewels--pearls, rubies, diamonds, sapphires. It is a source of joy and  delight. Whatever is conducive to the unity of the world of mankind is  most acceptable and praiseworthy; whatever is the cause of discord and  disunion is saddening and deplorable. Consider the significance of unity  and harmony.    This evening I will speak to you upon the subject of existence and  nonexistence, life and death. Existence is the expression and outcome of  composition and combination. Nonexistence is the expression and outcome of  division and disintegration. If we study the forms of existence in the  material universe, we find that all created things are the result of  composition. Material elements have grouped together in infinite variety  and endless forms. Each organism is a compound; each object is an  expression of elemental affinity. We find the complex human organism  simply an aggregation of cellular structure; the tree is a composite of  plant cells; the animal, a combination and grouping of cellular atoms or  units, and so on. Existence or the expression of being is, therefore,  composition; and nonexistence is decomposition, division, disintegration.  When elements have been brought together in a certain plan of combination,  the result is the human organism; when these elements separate and  disperse, the outcome is death and nonexistence. Life is, therefore, the  product of composition; and death signifies decomposition.    Likewise, in the world of minds and souls, fellowship, which is an  expression of composition, is conducive to life, whereas discord, which is  an expression of decomposition, is the equivalent of death. Without  cohesion among the individual elements which compose the body politic,  disintegration and decay must inevitably follow and life be extinguished.  Ferocious animals have no fellowship. The vultures and tigers are  solitary, whereas domestic animals live together in complete harmony. The  sheep, black and white, associate without discord. Birds of various  species and colors wing their flight and feed together without a trace of  enmity or disagreement. Therefore, in the world of humanity it is wise and  seemly that all the individual members should manifest unity and affinity.  In the clustered jewels of the races may the blacks be as sapphires and  rubies and the whites as diamonds and pearls. The composite beauty of  humanity will be witnessed in their unity and blending. How glorious the  spectacle of real unity among mankind! How conducive to peace, confidence  and happiness if races and nations were united in fellowship and accord!  The Prophets of God were sent into the world upon this mission of unity  and agreement: that these long-separated sheep might flock together. When  the sheep separate, they are exposed to danger, but in a flock and under  protection of the shepherd they are safe from the attack of all ferocious  enemies.    When the racial elements of the American nation unite in actual fellowship  and accord, the lights of the oneness of humanity will shine, the day of  eternal glory and bliss will dawn, the spirit of God encompass, and the  divine favors descend. Under the leadership and training of God, the real  Shepherd, all will be protected and preserved. He will lead them in green  pastures of happiness and sustenance, and they will attain to the real  goal of existence. This is the blessing and benefit of unity; this is the  outcome of love. This is the sign of the Most Great Peace; this is the  star of the oneness of the human world. Consider how blessed this  condition will be. I pray for you and ask the confirmation and assistance  of God in your behalf.          25 April 1912  Talk to Theosophical Society  Home of Mr. and Mrs. Arthur J. Parsons  1700 Eighteenth Street, NW, Washington, D.C.      Notes by Joseph H. Hannen    The greatest power in the realm and range of human existence is spirit--the  divine breath which animates and pervades all things. It is manifested  throughout creation in different degrees or kingdoms. In the vegetable  kingdom it is the augmentative spirit or power of growth, the animus of  life and development in plants, trees and organisms of the floral world.  In this degree of its manifestation spirit is unconscious of the powers  which qualify the kingdom of the animal. The distinctive virtue or plus of  the animal is sense perception; it sees, hears, smells, tastes and feels  but is incapable, in turn, of conscious ideation or reflection which  characterizes and differentiates the human kingdom. The animal neither  exercises nor apprehends this distinctive human power and gift. From the  visible it cannot draw conclusions regarding the invisible, whereas the  human mind from visible and known premises attains knowledge of the  unknown and invisible. For instance, Christopher Columbus from information  based upon known and provable facts drew conclusions which led him  unerringly across the vast ocean to the unknown continent of America. Such  power of accomplishment is beyond the range of animal intelligence.  Therefore, this power is a distinctive attribute of the human spirit and  kingdom. The animal spirit cannot penetrate and discover the mysteries of  things. It is a captive of the senses. No amount of teaching, for  instance, would enable it to grasp the fact that the sun is stationary,  and the earth moves around it. Likewise, the human spirit has its  limitations. It cannot comprehend the phenomena of the Kingdom  transcending the human station, for it is a captive of powers and life  forces which have their operation upon its own plane of existence, and it  cannot go beyond that boundary.    There is, however, another Spirit, which may be termed the Divine, to  which Jesus Christ refers when He declares that man must be born of its  quickening and baptized with its living fire. Souls deprived of that  Spirit are accounted as dead, though they are possessed of the human  spirit. Jesus Christ has pronounced them dead inasmuch as they have no  portion of the Divine Spirit. He says, \"Let the dead bury their dead.\" In  another instance He declares, \"That which is born of the flesh is flesh;  and that which is born of the Spirit is spirit.\" By this He means that  souls, though alive in the human kingdom, are nevertheless dead if devoid  of this particular spirit of divine quickening. They have not partaken of  the divine life of the higher Kingdom, for the soul which partakes of the  power of the Divine Spirit is, verily, living.    This quickening spirit emanates spontaneously from the Sun of Truth, from  the reality of Divinity, and is not a revelation or a manifestation. It is  like the rays of the sun. The rays are emanations from the sun. This does  not mean that the sun has become divisible, that a part of the sun has  come out into space. This plant beside me has risen from the seed;  therefore, it is a manifestation and unfoldment of the seed. The seed, as  you can see, has unfolded in manifestation, and the result is this plant.  Every leaf of the plant is a part of the seed. But the reality of Divinity  is indivisible, and each individual of humankind cannot be a part of it as  is often claimed. Nay, rather, the individual realities of mankind, when  spiritually born, are emanations from the reality of Divinity, just as the  flame, heat and light of the sun are the effulgence of the sun and not a  part of the sun itself. Therefore, a spirit has emanated from the reality  of Divinity, and its effulgences have become visible in human entities or  realities. This ray and this heat are permanent. There is no cessation in  the effulgence. As long as the sun exists, the heat and light will exist,  and inasmuch as eternality is a property of Divinity, this emanation is  everlasting. There is no cessation in its outpouring. The more the world  of humanity develops, the more the effulgences or emanations of Divinity  will become revealed, just as the stone, when it becomes polished and pure  as a mirror, will reflect in fuller degree the glory and splendor of the  sun.    The mission of the Prophets, the revelation of the Holy Books, the  manifestation of the heavenly Teachers and the purpose of divine  philosophy all center in the training of the human realities so that they  may become clear and pure as mirrors and reflect the light and love of the  Sun of Reality. Therefore, I hope that--whether you be in the East or the  West--you will strive with heart and soul in order that day by day the  world of humanity may become glorified, more spiritual, more sanctified;  and that the splendor of the Sun of Reality may be revealed fully in human  hearts as in a mirror. This is worthy of the world of mankind. This is the  true evolution and progress of humanity. This is the supreme bestowal.  Otherwise, by simple development along material lines man is not  perfected. At most, the physical aspect of man, his natural or material  conditions, may become stabilized and improved, but he will remain  deprived of the spiritual or divine bestowal. He is then like a body  without a spirit, a lamp without the light, an eye without the power of  vision, an ear that hears no sound, a mind incapable of perceiving, an  intellect minus the power of reason.    Man has two powers; and his development, two aspects. One power is  connected with the material world, and by it he is capable of material  advancement. The other power is spiritual, and through its development his  inner, potential nature is awakened. These powers are like two wings. Both  must be developed, for flight is impossible with one wing. Praise be to  God! Material advancement has been evident in the world, but there is need  of spiritual advancement in like proportion. We must strive"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/19287"],[0,"Selections from the Writings of `Abdu'l-Bahá (#16)"],[1,"D! THE ...      O ye two favoured handmaids of the Lord! The letter from Mother Beecher  hath been received, and truly it spoke for you both, wherefore I address  the two of you together. This seemeth very good to me, for ye two pure  beings are even as a single precious gem, ye are two boughs branched from  a single tree; ye both adore the same Beloved, ye both are longing for the  same resplendent Sun.    My hope is that all the handmaids of God in that region will unite like  unto the waves of one unending sea; for although blown about as the wind  listeth, these are separate in themselves, yet in truth are they all at  one with the boundless deep.    How good it is if the friends be as close as sheaves of light, if they  stand together side by side in a firm unbroken line. For now have the rays  of reality from the Sun of the world of existence, united in adoration all  the worshippers of this light; and these rays have, through infinite  grace, gathered all peoples together within this wide-spreading shelter;  therefore must all souls become as one soul, and all hearts as one heart.  Let all be set free from the multiple identities that were born of passion  and desire, and in the oneness of their love for God find a new way of  life.    O ye two handmaids of God! Now is the time for you to become as bounteous  cups that are filled to overflowing, and even as the reviving gusts that  blow from the Abha Paradise, to scatter the fragrance of musk across that  land. Release yourselves from this world's life, and at every stage long  ye for non-existence; for when the ray returneth to the sun, it is wiped  out, and when the drop cometh to the sea, it vanisheth, and when the true  lover findeth his Beloved, he yieldeth up his soul.    Until a being setteth his foot in the plane of sacrifice, he is bereft of  every favour and grace; and this plane of sacrifice is the realm of dying  to the self, that the radiance of the living God may then shine forth. The  martyr's field is the place of detachment from self, that the anthems of  eternity may be upraised. Do all ye can to become wholly weary of self,  and bind yourselves to that Countenance of Splendours; and once ye have  reached such heights of servitude, ye will find, gathered within your  shadow, all created things. This is boundless grace; this is the highest  sovereignty; this is the life that dieth not. All else save this is at the  last but manifest perdition and great loss.    Praise be to God, the gate of boundless grace is opened wide, the heavenly  table is set, the servants of the Merciful and His handmaids are present  at the feast. Strive ye to receive your share of this eternal food, so  that ye shall be loved and cherished in this world and the next.            37: O YE DEAR FRIENDS OF 'ABDU'L-BAHA! A BLESSED LETTER ...      O ye dear friends of 'Abdu'l-Baha! A blessed letter hath been received  from you, telling of the election of a Spiritual Assembly. It hath  rejoiced my heart to know that, God be praised, the friends in that area,  with absolute unity, fellowship and love, have held this new election and  were successful in voting for souls who are sanctified, are favoured at  the Holy Threshold and are well known amongst the friends to be staunch  and firm in the Covenant.    Now must those elected representatives arise to serve with spirituality  and joy, with purity of intent, with strong attraction to the fragrances  of the Almighty, and well supported by the Holy Spirit. Let them raise up  the banner of guidance, and as soldiers of the Company on high, let them  exalt God's Word, spread abroad His sweet savours, educate the souls of  men, and promote the Most Great Peace.    Truly, blessed souls have been elected. The moment I read their names, I  felt a thrill of spiritual joy to know that, praised be God, persons have  been raised up in that country who are servants of the Kingdom, and ready  to lay down their lives for Him Who hath neither likeness nor peer.    O ye dear friends of mine! Light up this Assembly with the splendour of  God's love. Make it ring out with the joyous music of the hallowed  spheres, make it thrive on those foods that are served at the Lord's  Supper, at the heavenly banquet table of God. Come ye together in gladness  unalloyed, and at the beginning of the meeting, recite ye this prayer:    O Thou Lord of the Kingdom! Though our bodies be gathered here together,  yet our spellbound hearts are carried away by Thy love, and yet are we  transported by the rays of Thy resplendent face. Weak though we be, we  await the revelations of Thy might and power. Poor though we be, with  neither goods nor means, still take we riches from the treasures of Thy  Kingdom. Drops though we be, still do we draw from out Thy ocean deeps.  Motes though we be, still do we gleam in the glory of Thy splendid Sun.    O Thou our Provider! Send down Thine aid, that each one gathered here may  become a lighted candle, each one a centre of attraction, each one a  summoner to Thy heavenly realms, till at last we make this nether world  the mirror image of Thy Paradise.    O ye dear friends of mine! It is incumbent upon the assemblies of those  regions to be connected one with another and to correspond with one  another, and also to communicate with the assemblies of the east, thus to  become agencies for union throughout the world.    O ye spiritual friends! Such must be your constancy that should the  evil-wishers put every believer to death and only one remain, that one,  singly and alone, will withstand all the peoples of the earth, and will go  on scattering far and wide the sweet and holy fragrances of God.  Wherefore, should any fearsome news, any word of terrifying events, reach  you from the Holy Land, see to it that ye waver not, be ye not stricken by  grief, be ye not shaken. Rather, rise ye up instantly, with iron resolve,  and serve ye the Kingdom of God.    This Servant of the Lord's Threshold hath been in peril at all times. He  is in peril now. At no time have I had any hope of safety, and my dearest  wish is this: to drink of the martyr's bounteous and brim-full cup, and  die on the field of sacrifice, delighting in that wine which is the most  precious of God's gifts. This is my highest hope, this my most vehement  desire.    We hear that the Tablets of I_sh_raqat (Splendours), Tarazat (Ornaments),  Bi_sh_arat (Glad Tidings), Tajalliyyat (Effulgences), and Kalimat (Words  of Paradise) have been translated and published in those regions. In these  Tablets will ye have a model of how to be and how to live.            38: O HANDMAID OF GOD, WHO TREMBLEST EVEN AS A FRESH ...      O handmaid of God, who tremblest even as a fresh and tender branch in the  winds of the love of God! I have read thy letter, which telleth of thine  abundant love, thine intense devotion, and of thy being occupied with the  remembrance of thy Lord.    Depend thou upon God. Forsake thine own will and cling to His, set aside  thine own desires and lay hold of His, that thou mayest become an example,  holy, spiritual, and of the Kingdom, unto His handmaids.    Know thou, O handmaid, that in the sight of Baha, women are accounted the  same as men, and God hath created all humankind in His own image, and  after His own likeness. That is, men and women alike are the revealers of  His names and attributes, and from the spiritual viewpoint there is no  difference between them. Whosoever draweth nearer to God, that one is the  most favoured, whether man or woman. How many a handmaid, ardent and  devoted, hath, within the sheltering shade of Baha, proved superior to the  men, and surpassed the famous of the earth.    The House of Justice, however, according to the explicit text of the Law  of God, is confined to men; this for a wisdom of the Lord God's, which  will erelong be made manifest as clearly as the sun at high noon.    As to you, O ye other handmaids who are enamoured of the heavenly  fragrances, arrange ye holy gatherings, and found ye Spiritual Assemblies,  for these are the basis for spreading the sweet savours of God, exalting  His Word, uplifting the lamp of His grace, promulgating His religion and  promoting His Teachings, and what bounty is there greater than this? These  Spiritual Assemblies are aided by the Spirit of God. Their defender is  'Abdu'l-Baha. Over them He spreadeth His wings. What bounty is there  greater than this? These Spiritual Assemblies are shining lamps and  heavenly gardens, from which the fragrances of holiness are diffused over  all regions, and the lights of knowledge are shed abroad over all created  things. From them the spirit of life streameth in every direction. They,  indeed, are the potent sources of the progress of man, at all times and  under all conditions. What bounty is there greater than this?            39: O HANDMAID OF GOD! THY LETTER HATH BEEN RECEIVED, ...      O handmaid of God! Thy letter hath been received, bringing its news that  an Assembly hath been established in that city.    Look ye not upon the fewness of thy numbers, rather, seek ye out hearts  that are pure. One consecrated soul is preferable to a thousand other  souls. If a small number of people gather lovingly together, with absolute  purity and sanctity, with their hearts free of the world, experiencing the  emotions of the Kingdom and the powerful magnetic forces of the Divine,  and being at one in their happy fellowship, that gathering will exert its  influence over all the earth. The nature of that band of people, the words  they speak, the deeds they do, will unleash the bestowals of Heaven, and  provide a foretaste of eternal bliss. The hosts of the Company on high  will defend them, and the angels of the Abha Paradise, in continuous  succession, will come down to their aid.    The meaning of 'angels' is the confirmations of God and His celestial  powers. Likewise angels are blessed beings who have severed all ties with  this"]]]
