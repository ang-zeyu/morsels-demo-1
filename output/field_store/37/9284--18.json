Such is not the work that wise masters confide to fierce  slaves.  But that is the least of the reasons which exclude them  from my choice, and fix my choice of assistant on you.  Do you  forget what I told you of the danger which the Dervish declared no  bribe I could offer could tempt him a second time to brave?\"    \"I remember now; those words had passed away from my mind.\"    \"And because they had passed away from your mind, I chose you for  my comrade.  I need a man by whom danger is scorned.\"    \"But in the process of which you tell me I see no possible danger  unless the ingredients you mix in your caldron have poisonous  fumes.\"    \"It is not that.  The ingredients I use are not poisons.\"    \"What other danger, except you dread your own Eastern slaves?  But,  if so, why lead them to these solitudes; and, if so, why not bid me  be armed?\"    \"The Eastern slaves, fulfilling my commands, wait for my summons,  where their eyes cannot see what we do.  The danger is of a kind in  which the boldest son of the East would be more craven, perhaps,  that the daintiest Sybarite of Europe, who would shrink from a  panther and laugh at a ghost.  In the creed of the Dervish, and of  all who adventure into that realm of Nature which is closed to  philosophy and open to magic, there are races in the magnitude of  space unseen as animalcules in the world of a drop.  For the tribes  of the drop science has its microscope.  Of the host of yon azure  Infinite magic gains sight, and through them gains command over  fluid conductors that link all the parts of creation.  Of these  races, some are wholly indifferent to man, some benign to him, and  some deadly hostile.  In all the regular and prescribed conditions  of mortal being, this magic realm seems as blank and tenantless as  yon vacant air.  But when a seeker of powers beyond the rude  functions by which man plies the clockwork that measures his hours,  and stops when its chain reaches the end of its coil, strives to  pass over those boundaries at which philosophy says, 'Knowledge  ends'--then, he is like all other travelers in regions unknown; he  must propitiate or brave the tribes that are hostile--must depend  for his life on the tribes that are friendly.  Though your science  discredits the alchemist's dogmas, your learning informs you that  all alchemists were not ignorant impostors; yet those whose  discoveries prove them to have been the nearest allies to your  practical knowledge, ever hint in their mystical works at the  reality of that realm which is open to magic--ever hint that some  means less familiar than furnace and bellows are essential to him  who explores the elixir of life.  He who once quaffs that elixir,  obtains in his very veins the bright fluid by which he transmits  the force of his will to agencies dormant in Nature, to giants  unseen in the space.  And here, as he passes the boundary which  divides his allotted and normal mortality from the regions and  races that magic alone can explore, so, here, he breaks down the  safeguard between himself and the tribes that are hostile.  Is it  not ever thus between man and man?  Let a race the most gentle and  timid and civilized dwell on one side a river or mountain, and  another have home in the region beyond, each, if it pass not the  intervening barrier, may with each live in peace.  But if ambitious  adventurers scale the mountain, or cross the river, with design to  subdue and enslave the population they boldly invade, then all the  invaded arise in wrath and defiance--the neighbors are changed into  foes.  And therefore this process--by which a simple though rare  material of Nature is made to yield to a mortal the boon of a life  which brings, with its glorious resistance to Time, desires and  faculties to subject to its service beings that dwell in the earth  and the air and the deep--has ever been one of the same peril which  an invader must brave when he crosses the bounds of his nation.  By  this key alone you unlock all the cells of the alchemist's lore; by  this alone understand how a labor, which a chemist's crudest  apprentice could perform, has baffled the giant fathers of all your  dwarfed children of science.  Nature, that stores this priceless  boon, seems to shrink from conceding it to man--the invisible  tribes that abhor him oppose themselves to the gain that might give  them a master.  The duller of those who were the life-seekers of  old would have told you how some chance, trivial, unlooked-for,  foiled their grand hope at the very point of fruition; some doltish  mistake, some improvident oversight, a defect in the sulphur, a  wild overflow in the quicksilver, or a flaw in the bellows, or a  pupil who failed to replenish the fuel, by falling asleep by the  furnace.  The invisible foes seldom vouchsafe to make themselves  visible where they can frustrate the bungler as they mock at his  toils from their ambush.  But the mightier adventurers, equally  foiled in despite of their patience and skill, would have said,  'Not with us rests the fault; we neglected no caution, we failed  from no oversight.  But out from the caldron dread faces arose, and  the specters or demons dismayed and baffled us.'  Such, then, is  the danger which seems so appalling to a son of the East, as it  seemed to a seer in the dark age of Europe.  But we can deride all  its threats, you and I.  For myself, I own frankly I take all the  safety that the charms and resources of magic bestow.  You, for  your safety, have the cultured and disciplined reason which reduces  all fantasies to nervous impressions; and I rely on the courage of  one who has questioned, unquailing, the Luminous Shadow, and  wrested from the hand of the magician himself the wand which  concentered the wonders of will!\"    To this strange and long discourse I listened without interruption,  and now quietly answered:    \"I do not merit the trust you affect in my courage; but I am now on  my guard against the cheats of the fancy, and the fumes of a vapor  can scarcely bewilder the brain in the open air of this mountain  land.  I believe in no races like those which you tell me lie  viewless in space, as do gases.  I believe not in magic; I ask not  its aids, and I dread not its terrors.  For the rest, I am  confident of one mournful courage--the courage that comes from  despair.  I submit to your guidance, whatever it be, as a sufferer  whom colleges doom to the grave submits to the quack who says,  'Take my specific and live!'  My life is naught in itself; my life  lives in another.  You and I are both brave from despair; you would  turn death from yourself--I would turn death from one I love more  than myself.  Both know how little aid we can win from the  colleges, and both, therefore, turn to the promises most  audaciously cheering.  Dervish or magician, alchemist or phantom,  what care you and I?  And if they fail us, what then?  They cannot  fail us more than the colleges do!\"      V      The gold has been gained with an easy labor.  I knew where to seek  for it, whether under the turf or in the bed of the creek.  But  Margrave's eyes, hungrily gazing round every spot from which the  ore was disburied, could not detect the substance of which he alone  knew the outward appearance.  I had begun to believe that, even in  the description given to him of this material, he had been  credulously duped, and that no such material existed, when, coming  back from the bed of the watercourse, I saw a faint, yellow gleam  amidst the roots of a giant parasite plant, the leaves and blossoms  of which climbed up the sides of the cave with its antediluvian  relics.  The gleam was the gleam of gold, and on removing the loose  earth round the roots of the plant, we came on--  No, I will not, I  dare not, describe it.  The gold digger would cast it aside; the  naturalist would pause not to heed it; and did I describe it, and  chemistry deign to subject it to analysis, could chemistry alone  detach or discover its boasted virtues?    Its particles, indeed, are very minute, not seeming readily to  crystallize with each other; each in itself of uniform shape and  size, spherical as the egg which contains the germ of life, and  small as the egg from which the life of an insect may quicken.    But Margrave's keen eye caught sight of the atoms upcast by the  light of the moon.  He exclaimed to me, \"Found!  I shall live!\"  And then, as he gathered up the grains with tremulous hands, he  called out to the Veiled Woman, hitherto still seated motionless on  the crag.  At his word she rose and went to the place hard by,  where the fuel was piled, busying herself there.  I had no leisure  to heed her.  I continued my search in the soft and yielding soil  that time and the decay of vegetable life had accumulated over the  pre-Adamite strata on which the arch of the cave rested its mighty  keystone.    When we had collected of these particles about thrice as much as a  man might hold in his hand, we seemed to have exhausted their bed.  We continued still to find gold, but no more of the delicate  substance to which, in our sight, gold was as dross.    \"Enough,\" then said Margrave, reluctantly desisting.  \"What we have  gained already will suffice for a life thrice as long as legend  attributes to Haroun.  I shall live--I shall live through the  centuries.\"    \"Forget not that I claim my share.\"    \"Your share--yours!  True--your half of my life!  It is true.\"  He  paused with a low, ironical, malignant laugh, and then added, as he  rose and turned away, \"But the work is yet to be done.\"      VI      While we had thus labored and found, Ayesha had placed the fuel  where the moonlight fell fullest on the sward of the tableland--a  part of it already piled as for a fire, the rest of it heaped  confusedly close at hand; and by the pile she had placed the  coffer.  And, there she stood, her arms folded under her"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/18350"],[0,"Social Life in the Insect World (#16)"],[1,"observation, that I have never once been enabled to see the oviduct at  work. I can only judge of the advent of the eggs by the movements of the  end of the abdomen, which is immersed more deeply with a sudden plunging  movement.    At the same time the viscous composition is emitted in intermittent  waves, and is beaten into a foam by the terminal valves. The foam thus  obtained spreads itself over the sides and at the base of the layer of  eggs, and projects through the meshes of the wire gauze as a result of  the pressure of the abdomen. Thus the spongy envelope is progressively  created as the ovaries are gradually emptied.    I imagine, although I cannot speak as the result of direct observation,  that for the central core, where the eggs are surrounded by a material  more homogeneous than that of the outer shell, the Mantis must employ  her secretion as it emerges, without beating it into a foam. The layer  of eggs once deposited, the two valves would produce the foam required  to envelop the eggs. It is extremely difficult, however, to guess what  occurs beneath the veil of foam-like secretion.    In a recent nest the zone of issue is surrounded by a layer of finely  porous matter, of a pure matt, almost chalky white, which contrasts  distinctly with the remainder of the nest, which is of a dirty white. It  resembles the icing composition made by confectioners with whipped white  of egg, sugar, and starch, for the ornamentation of cakes.    This snowy border is easily crumbled and easily detached. When it  disappears the zone of issue is clearly defined, with its double series  of leaves with free edges. Exposure to the weather, wind, and rain  result in its disappearance, fragment by fragment, so that old nests  preserve no trace of it.    At first sight one is tempted to regard this snowy substance as of a  different material to the rest of the nest. But does the Mantis really  employ two secretions? No. Anatomy, in the first place, assures us of  the unity of the materials of the nest. The organ which secretes the  substance of the nest consists of cylindrical tubes, having a curious  tangled appearance, which are arranged in two groups of twenty each.  They are all filled with a colourless, viscous fluid, which is precisely  similar in appearance in all parts of the organ. There is no indication  of any organ or secretion which could produce a chalky coloration.    Moreover, the method by which the snowy band is formed rejects the idea  of a different material. We see the two caudal appendices of the Mantis  sweeping the surface of the foamy mass, and skimming, so to speak, the  cream of the cream, gathering it together, and retaining it along the  hump of the nest in such a way as to form a band like a ribbon of icing.  What remains after this scouring process, or what oozes from the band  before it has set, spreads over the sides of the nest in a thin layer of  bubbles so fine that they cannot be distinguished without the aid of a  lens.    We often see a torrent of muddy water, full of clay in suspension,  covered with great streaks and masses of foam. On this fundamental foam,  so to call it, which is soiled with earthy matters, we see here and  there masses of a beautiful white foam, in which the bubbles are much  smaller. A process of selection results from variations in density, and  here and there we see foam white as snow resting on the dirty foam from  which it is produced. Something of the kind occurs when the Mantis  builds her nest. The two appendices whip the viscous secretion of the  glands into foam. The lightest portion, whose bubbles are of the  greatest tenuity, which is white on account of its finer porosity, rises  to the surface, where the caudal filaments sweep it up and gather it  into the snowy ribbon which runs along the summit of the nest.    So far, with a little patience, observation is possible and yields a  satisfactory result. It becomes impossible in the matter of the complex  central zone, where the exits for the larvae are contrived through the  double series of overlapping leaves. The little I have been able to  learn amounts to this: The end of the abdomen, deeply cleft in a  horizontal direction, forms a kind of fork, of which the upper extremity  remains almost motionless, while the lower continuously oscillates,  producing the foam and depositing the eggs. The creation of the central  zone is certainly the work of the upper extremity.    It is always to be seen in the continuation of this central zone, in the  midst of the fine white foam gathered up by the caudal filaments. The  latter delimit the zone, one working on either side, feeling the edges  of the belt, and apparently testing it and judging its progress. These  two filaments are like two long fingers of exquisite sensitiveness,  which direct the difficult operation.    But how are the two series of scales obtained, and the fissures, the  gates of exit which they shelter? I do not know; I cannot even imagine.  I leave the end of the problem to others.    What a wonderful mechanism is this, that has the power to emit and to  form, so quickly and methodically, the horny medium of the central  kernel, the foam which forms the protective walls, the white creamy foam  of the ribbon which runs along the central zone, the eggs, and the  fecundating liquid, while at the same time it constructs the overlapping  leaves, the imbricated scales, and the alternating series of open  fissures! We are lost in the face of such a wonder. Yet how easily the  work is performed! Clinging to the wire gauze, forming, so to speak, the  axis of her nest, the Mantis barely moves. She bestows not a glance on  the marvel which is growing behind her; her limbs are used only for  support; they take no part in the building of the nest. The nest is  built, if we may say so, automatically. It is not the result of industry  and the cunning of instinct; it is a purely mechanical task, which is  conditioned by the implements, by the organisation of the insect. The  nest, complex though it is in structure, results solely from the  functioning of the organs, as in our human industries a host of objects  are mechanically fashioned whose perfection puts the dexterity of the  fingers to shame.    From another point of view the nest of the Mantis is even more  remarkable. It forms an excellent application of one of the most  valuable lessons of physical science in the matter of the conservation  of heat. The Mantis has outstripped humanity in her knowledge of thermic  nonconductors or insulators.    The famous physicist Rumford was responsible for a very pretty  experiment designed to demonstrate the low conductivity of air where  heat other than radiant heat is concerned. The famous scientist  surrounded a frozen cheese by a mass of foam consisting of well-beaten  eggs. The whole was exposed to the heat of an oven. In a few minutes a  light omelette was obtained, piping hot, but the cheese in the centre  was as cold as at the outset. The air imprisoned in the bubbles of the  surrounding froth accounts for the phenomenon. Extremely refractory to  heat, it had absorbed the heat of the oven and had prevented it from  reaching the frozen substance in the centre of the omelette.    Now, what does the Mantis do? Precisely what Rumford did; she whips her  albumen to obtain a soufflee, a froth composed of myriads of tiny  air-bubbles, which will protect the germs of life contained in the  central core. It is true that her aim is reversed; the coagulated foam  of the nest is a safeguard against cold, not against heat, but what will  afford protection from the one will afford protection from the other; so  that Rumford, had he wished, might equally well have maintained a hot  body at a high temperature in a refrigerator.    Rumford understood the athermic properties of a blanket of air-cells,  thanks to the accumulated knowledge of his predecessors and his own  studies and experiments. How is it that the Mantis, for who knows how  many ages, has been able to outstrip our physicists in this problem in  calorics? How did she learn to surround her eggs with this mass of  solidifying froth, so that it was able, although fixed to a bough or a  stone without other shelter, to brave with impunity the rigours of  winter?    The other Mantes found in my neighbourhood, which are the only species  of which I can speak with full knowledge, employ or omit the envelope of  solidifying froth accordingly as the eggs are or are not intended to  survive the winter. The little Grey Mantis (_Ameles decolor_), which  differs so widely from the Praying Mantis in that the wings of the  female are almost completely absent, builds a nest hardly as large as a  cherry-stone, and covers it skilfully with a porous rind. Why this  cellular envelope? Because the nest of the _Ameles_, like that of the  Praying Mantis, has to endure through the winter, fixed to a stone or a  twig, and is thus exposed to the full severity of the dangerous season.    The _Empusa pauperata_, on the other hand (one of the strangest of  European insects), builds a nest as small as that of the _Ameles_,  although the insect itself is as large as the Praying Mantis. This nest  is quite a small structure, composed of a small number of cells,  arranged side by side in three or four series, sloping together at the  neck. Here there is a complete absence of the porous envelope, although  the nest is exposed to the weather, like the previous examples, affixed  to some twig or fragment of rock. The lack of the insulating rind is a  sign of different climatic conditions. The eggs of the _Empusa_ hatch  shortly after they are laid, in warm and sunny weather. Not being  exposed to the asperities of the winter, they need no protection other  than the thin egg-cases themselves.    Are these nice and reasonable precautions, which rival the experiment of  Rumford, a fortuitous result?--one of the innumerable"]]]
