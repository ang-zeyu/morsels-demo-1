With a breath of relief he  closed the door again, placed a chair against it, and, sitting down,  proceeded to pull off his clothes. Coat, vest, under-garments, he  placed them all tenderly in an untidy heap on the floor, and then,  with a last lingering, affectionate look at them, walked sedately  towards the bath. But this sedateness was only momentary. The first  few steps he walked, but, a noise in the grate startling him, he  suddenly assumed an air of the greatest gaiety, and, bowing with mock  gallantry to his trousers, he now waltzed coquettishly to the bath. It  was grim, horribly grim, and horribly hot too, for, when he felt the  temperature with one of his squat, podgy toes, it made him swear quite  involuntarily. Turning on the cold water, and slapping his thighs  playfully, he felt again. Too hot yet, far too hot even for him! He  loved heat. More cold! and he was hoisting one chubby leg to feel  again, when, a repetition of the noise in the grate making him swing  round, he lost his balance, and descended on the floor with a hard, a  very hard, bump. For some seconds he lay still, too sulky and  aggrieved even to get up, but, the draught from under the ill-fitting  door tickling his bare flesh in the most immodest fashion, he roused  himself from this lethargy, and was about to raise himself from the  floor, when the lights went out--went out without a moment's warning,  and he found himself engulfed in the most funereal darkness. To say he  was startled is to put it very mildly--he was absolutely  terror-stricken--far too terror-stricken to think of moving now, and  least of all of getting up and groping for the matches. Indeed, when  he came to think of it, he had not seen any matches in the room, and  he had not brought any with him, his wife had flurried him so much.  The moment the candles were extinguished the grimness sensibly  increased, and he could feel all around him, thickly amalgamated with  the ether, a superphysical presence, at once hostile and horrible.  Then, to bring his terror to a climax, there issued from the bath a  loud rubbing and splashing, as if some one, some very heavy person,  was vigorously washing. The water rose and fell, squished and bubbled  as it does when one is lying at full length in it, raising and  lowering oneself, kicking and plunging first on one side and then on  the other. Whilst, to add to the realism, Captain Smythe distinctly  heard gasping and puffing; and the soft, greasy sound of a well-soaped  flannel. He could indeed follow every movement of the occupant of the  bath as graphically as if he had seen him--from the brisk scrubbing of  body and legs to the finicky process of cleaning the ears and toes.    It was whilst the bather was occupied thus that the cupboard door  began to open very quietly and stealthily, and Captain de Smythe heard  the chair he had so carefully placed against it being gradually  propelled across the floor.    Then something, he would have given anything to tell what, came out  and began to steal towards him. He tried to crawl out of its way, but  could not; his limbs no longer acted conjointly with his brain, and  when he opened his mouth to shout at it, his voice withered away in  his throat. It came up to him, and directly it touched his naked skin  he knew it was a woman--a woman with a much-beflounced silk skirt and  silk petticoats--a woman whose person was perfumed with violets (a  scent for which the Captain had a particular weakness), and without  doubt, loaded with jewellery. Her behaviour did not betray any  symptoms of embarrassment when she encountered the Captain lying on  the floor, but, planting one icy-cold high-heeled shoe on his chest  and the other on his cheek, she stepped on him as if he had been an  orthodox cushion or footstool, purposely placed there for her  convenience. A hollow exclamation, which died away in a gasp, issued  from the bath, as the woman, with a swift movement of her arms, threw  something over it. What followed, the Captain could only surmise, but  from the muttered imprecations and splashes in the water, it seemed to  him that nothing short of murder was taking place. After a while the  noises in the bath grew feebler and feebler, and when they finally  ceased, the woman, with a sigh of relief, shook the water from her  arms, and, stepping off the Captain, moved towards the fireplace. The  spell which had, up to the present, enthralled the unfortunate  Captain, was now broken, and, thinking that his ghostly visitor had  betaken herself right away, he sat up. He had hardly done so before  the darkness was rudely dissipated, and, to his horror, he saw  looking at him, from a distance of only a few feet, a white, luminous  face, presumably that of a woman. But what a woman! What a  devil!--what a match for the most lurid of any of Satan's male  retainers. Yet she was not without beauty--beauty of the richest  sensual order; beauty that, had it been flesh and blood, would have  sent men mad. Her hair, jet black, wavy, and parted in the centre, was  looped over her shell-like ears, which were set unusually low and far  back on her head; her nose was of that rare and matchless shape termed  Grecian; and her mouth--in form, a triumph of all things heavenly, in  expression, a triumph of all things hellish. The magnificent turn of  its short upper lip, and the soft voluptuous line of its under lip;  its sportive dimples and ripe red colour; its even rows of dazzling,  pearly teeth were adorable; but they appealed to the senses, and in no  sense or shape to the soul. Her brows, slightly irregular in outline,  met over the nose; her eyelashes were of great length, and her  eyes--slightly, ever so slightly, obliquely set, and larger than those  of living human beings--were black, black as her hair; and the pupils  sparkled and shone with the most damnable expression of satanical  hatred and glee. The whole thing, the face and the light that emanated  from it, was so entirely awful and devilish, that Captain Smythe sat  like one turned to stone, and it was not until long after it had  vanished that he groped his way to the door, and in Adam's costume,  for he dared not stay to put on his clothes, fled down the passage to  his bedroom.    From his wife he got little sympathy; her sarcasm was too deep for  words, and she merely ordered her husband on no account to breathe a  word of his \"silliness\" before either the children or the servants.  The injunction, however, which was naturally carried out to the  letter, was futile as a precaution, for, on running into the bathroom  one morning when every one else was downstairs, the eldest boy,  Ronald, saw, floating in the bath, the body of a hoary-headed old man.  It was bloated and purplish blue, and had big, glassy eyes that stared  at him in such a hideous, meaningless manner that he uttered a scream  of terror and fled. Alarmed at the noise, most of the household ran to  see what had happened. Only the Captain remained behind. He knew only  too well, and he hid, letting his wife and the servants go upstairs  alone. They entered the bathroom--there was nothing in the bath, not  even water, but, as they were leaving, they ran into a dark, handsome,  evil-eyed woman, clad in the most costly of dresses, and sparkling  with jewellery. She glided past them with sly, silent footsteps, and  vanished by the cupboard. Cured of scepticism, and throwing dignity to  the wind, the Captain's wife raced downstairs, and, bursting into the  drawing-room, flung herself on the sofa in hysterics.    Within a week the house was once again empty, and the rumour getting  about that it was haunted, the landlord threatened the Smythes with an  action for slander of title. But I do not think the case was taken to  court, the Smythes agreeing to contradict the report they had  originated. Astute inquiries, however, eventually led them to discover  that a lady, answering to the description of the ghost they had seen,  had once lived at ---- House. Of Spanish descent, she was young,  beautiful, and gay; and was married to a man, an extremely wealthy man  (people remembered how rich he was after he died), old enough to be  her grandfather. They had nothing in common, the husband only wanting  to be quiet, the wife to flirt and be admired. Their neighbours often  heard them quarrel, and it was declared that the wife possessed the  temper of a fiend. The man was eventually found dead in his bath, and  there being no indications of violence, it was generally supposed that  he had fainted, (his wife having been previously heard to declare that  he often had fainting fits), and had thus been accidentally drowned.  The beautiful young widow, who inherited all his money, left the house  immediately and went abroad, and the neighbours, when questioned by  the Smythes as to whether anything had been seen of her since, shook  their heads dubiously, but refused to commit themselves.                                   CASE XI        THE CHOKING GHOST OF \"---- HOUSE,\" NEAR        SANDYFORD PLACE, GLASGOW      The last time I was passing through Glasgow, I put up for the night at  an hotel near Sandyford Place, and met there an old theatrical  acquaintance named Browne, Hely Browne. Not having seen him since I  gave up acting, which is now, alas! a good many years, we had much to  discuss--touring days, lodgings, managers, crowds, and a dozen other  subjects, all included in the vulgar term \"shop.\" We spent the whole  of one evening debating thus, in the smoke-room; whilst the following  night we went to an entertainment given by that charming reciter and  raconteur, Miss Lilian North, who, apart from her talent, which, in my  opinion, places her in the first rank of her profession, is the  possessor of extraordinary personal attractions, not the least  remarkable of which are her hands. Indeed, it was through my attention  being called to "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/2005"],[0,"Piccadilly Jim (#16)"],[1,"! Good-bye, Bayliss!\"    The engine gave a final shriek of farewell. The train began to  slide along the platform, pursued to the last by optimistic boys  offering buns for sale. It gathered speed. Jimmy, leaning out the  window, was amazed at a spectacle so unusual as practically to  amount to a modern miracle--the spectacled Bayliss running. The  butler was not in the pink of condition, but he was striding out  gallantly. He reached the door of Jimmy's compartment, and raised  his hand.    \"Begging your pardon, Mr. James,\" he panted, \"for taking the  liberty, but I really couldn't!\"    He reached up and thrust something into Jimmy's hand, something  crisp and crackling. Then, his mission performed, fell back and  stood waving a snowy handkerchief. The train plunged into the  tunnel.    Jimmy stared at the five-pound note. He was aware, like Ann  farther along the train, of a lump in his throat. He put the note  slowly into his pocket.    The train moved on.        CHAPTER VII    ON THE BOAT-DECK    Rising waters and a fine flying scud that whipped stingingly over  the side had driven most of the passengers on the _Atlantic_ to the  shelter of their staterooms or to the warm stuffiness of the  library. It was the fifth evening of the voyage. For five days  and four nights the ship had been racing through a placid ocean  on her way to Sandy Hook: but in the early hours of this  afternoon the wind had shifted to the north, bringing heavy seas.  Darkness had begun to fall now. The sky was a sullen black. The  white crests of the rollers gleamed faintly in the dusk, and the  wind sang in the ropes.    Jimmy and Ann had had the boat-deck to themselves for half an  hour. Jimmy was a good sailor: it exhilarated him to fight the  wind and to walk a deck that heaved and dipped and shuddered  beneath his feet; but he had not expected to have Ann's company  on such an evening. But she had come out of the saloon entrance,  her small face framed in a hood and her slim body shapeless  beneath a great cloak, and joined him in his walk.    Jimmy was in a mood of exaltation. He had passed the last few  days in a condition of intermittent melancholy, consequent on the  discovery that he was not the only man on board the _Atlantic_ who  desired the society of Ann as an alleviation of the tedium of an  ocean voyage. The world, when he embarked on this venture, had  consisted so exclusively of Ann and himself that, until the ship  was well on its way to Queenstown, he had not conceived the  possibility of intrusive males forcing their unwelcome attentions  on her. And it had added bitterness to the bitter awakening that  their attentions did not appear to be at all unwelcome. Almost  immediately after breakfast on the very first day, a creature with  a small black moustache and shining teeth had descended upon Ann  and, vocal with surprise and pleasure at meeting her again--he  claimed, damn him!, to have met her before at Palm Beach, Bar  Harbor, and a dozen other places--had carried her off to play an  idiotic game known as shuffle-board. Nor was this an isolated  case. It began to be borne in upon Jimmy that Ann, whom he had  looked upon purely in the light of an Eve playing opposite his  Adam in an exclusive Garden of Eden, was an extremely well-known  and popular character. The clerk at the shipping-office had lied  absurdly when he had said that very few people were crossing on  the _Atlantic_ this voyage. The vessel was crammed till its sides  bulged, it was loaded down in utter defiance of the Plimsoll law,  with Rollos and Clarences and Dwights and Twombleys who had known  and golfed and ridden and driven and motored and swum and danced  with Ann for years. A ghastly being entitled Edgar Something or  Teddy Something had beaten Jimmy by a short head in the race for  the deck-steward, the prize of which was the placing of his  deck-chair next to Ann's. Jimmy had been driven from the  promenade deck by the spectacle of this beastly creature lying  swathed in rugs reading best-sellers to her.    He had scarcely seen her to speak to since the beginning of the  voyage. When she was not walking with Rolly or playing  shuffle-board with Twombley, she was down below ministering to  the comfort of a chronically sea-sick aunt, referred to in  conversation as \"poor aunt Nesta\". Sometimes Jimmy saw the little  man--presumably her uncle--in the smoking-room, and once he came  upon the stout boy recovering from the effects of a cigar in a  quiet corner of the boat-deck: but apart from these meetings the  family was as distant from him as if he had never seen Ann at  all--let alone saved her life.    And now she had dropped down on him from heaven. They were alone  together with the good clean wind and the bracing scud. Rollo,  Clarence, Dwight, and Twombley, not to mention Edgar or possibly  Teddy, were down below--he hoped, dying. They had the world to  themselves.    \"I love rough weather,\" said Ann, lifting her face to the wind.  Her eyes were very bright. She was beyond any doubt or question  the only girl on earth. \"Poor aunt Nesta doesn't. She was bad  enough when it was quite calm, but this storm has finished her.  I've just been down below, trying to cheer her up.\"    Jimmy thrilled at the picture. Always fascinating, Ann seemed to  him at her best in the role of ministering angel. He longed to  tell her so, but found no words. They reached the end of the  deck, and turned. Ann looked up at him.    \"I've hardly seen anything of you since we sailed,\" she said. She  spoke almost reproachfully. \"Tell me all about yourself, Mr.  Bayliss. Why are you going to America?\"    Jimmy had had an impassioned indictment of the Rollos on his  tongue, but she had closed the opening for it as quickly as she  had made it. In face of her direct demand for information he  could not hark back to it now. After all, what did the Rollos  matter? They had no part in this little wind-swept world: they  were where they belonged, in some nether hell on the C. or D.  deck, moaning for death.    \"To make a fortune, I hope,\" he said.    Ann was pleased at this confirmation of her diagnosis. She had  deduced this from the evidence at Paddington Station.    \"How pleased your father will be if you do!\"    The slight complexity of Jimmy's affairs caused him to pause for  a moment to sort out his fathers, but an instant's reflection  told him that she must be referring to Bayliss the butler.    \"Yes.\"    \"He's a dear old man,\" said Ann. \"I suppose he's very proud of  you?\"    \"I hope so.\"    \"You must do tremendously well in America, so as not to  disappoint him. What are you thinking of doing?\"    Jimmy considered for a moment.    \"Newspaper work, I think.\"    \"Oh? Why, have you had any experience?\"    \"A little.\"    Ann seemed to grow a little aloof, as if her enthusiasm had been  damped.    \"Oh, well, I suppose it's a good enough profession. I'm not very  fond of it myself. I've only met one newspaper man in my life,  and I dislike him very much, so I suppose that has prejudiced  me.\"    \"Who was that?\"    \"You wouldn't have met him. He was on an American paper. A man  named Crocker.\"    A sudden gust of wind drove them back a step, rendering talk  impossible. It covered a gap when Jimmy could not have spoken.  The shock of the information that Ann had met him before made him  dumb. This thing was beyond him. It baffled him.    Her next words supplied a solution. They were under shelter of  one of the boats now and she could make herself heard.    \"It was five years ago, and I only met him for a very short  while, but the prejudice has lasted.\"    Jimmy began to understand. Five years ago! It was not so strange,  then, that they should not recognise each other now. He stirred  up his memory. Nothing came to the surface. Not a gleam of  recollection of that early meeting rewarded him. And yet  something of importance must have happened then, for her to  remember it. Surely his mere personality could not have been so  unpleasant as to have made such a lasting impression on her!    \"I wish you could do something better than newspaper work,\" said  Ann. \"I always think the splendid part about America is that it  is such a land of adventure. There are such millions of chances.  It's a place where anything may happen. Haven't you an  adventurous soul, Mr. Bayliss?\"    No man lightly submits to a charge, even a hinted charge, of  being deficient in the capacity for adventure.    \"Of course I have,\" said Jimmy indignantly. \"I'm game to tackle  anything that comes along.\"    \"I'm glad of that.\"    Her feeling of comradeship towards this young man deepened. She  loved adventure and based her estimate of any member of the  opposite sex largely on his capacity for it. She moved in a set,  when at home, which was more polite than adventurous, and had  frequently found the atmosphere enervating.    \"Adventure,\" said Jimmy, \"is everything.\"    He paused. \"Or a good deal,\" he concluded weakly.    \"Why qualify it like that? It sounds so tame. Adventure is the  biggest thing in life.\"    It seemed to Jimmy that he had received an excuse for a remark of  a kind that had been waiting for utterance ever since he had met  her. Often and often in the watches of the night, smoking endless  pipes and thinking of her, he had conjured up just such a vision  as this--they two walking the deserted deck alone, and she  innocently giving him an opening for some low-voiced, tender  speech, at which she would start, look at him quickly, and then  ask him haltingly if the words had any particular application.  And after that--oh, well, all sorts of things might happen. And  now the moment had come. It was true that he had always pictured  the scene as taking place by moonlight and at present there was a  half-gale blowing, out of an inky sky; also on the present  occasion anything in the nature of a low-voiced speech was  absolutely out of the question owing to the uproar of the  elements."]]]
