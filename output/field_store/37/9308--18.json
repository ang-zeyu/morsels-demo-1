Lord Beaconsfield used to maintain that the natural disposition of  the Jewish race was conservative, but foolish politics, instead of  encouraging the conservative instincts of the race, forced it to cast  its lot with the most extreme elements of the opposition. It has proved  true here.    Jagello was elected.    The leading men in Russian Poland, who, as a matter of fact, through the  whole new century, had fought against the Jews, although secretly, for  fear they should forfeit the sympathy of the intellectual aristocracy of  Europe, used this electoral victory of the Jews, which had been forced  upon them, to throw off the mask and openly act as their passionate  enemies. The so-called co-operative movement developed during the last  twelve years, and in itself nothing but a fight against the Jewish  commerce, under a different name, now changed into a systematic and  cruelly effected boycotting of the Jewish population. In private as in  public life, the openly pronounced password was: not to buy from Jews,  not to associate with Jews.    At the head of this movement marched the intelligence of Poland, among  others some of its most famous authors, avowed free thinkers as  Nemojewski, nay, as Alexander Swientochowski. Literary life presents  many changes, metamorphoses, which in thoroughness are not very much  inferior to those of Ovid. A good deal is necessary to make one who for  one-half century has witnessed the want of character among writers feel  even the slightest surprise. But I should willingly have sworn that I  should never have lived to see Alexander Swientochowski a nationalist,  he the most uncompromising adversary of nationalism, who endured a good  deal for his conviction, to see the poet of \"Chawa Rubin\" an  anti-Semitic chief. Not only does all that Alexander Swientochowski  wrote rise against him, but also the words, the powerful words, which  issued from his mouth in his palmy days.    The whole Polish press placed itself at the disposal of this movement.  Young Polish louts were posted outside the Jewish shops and ill-treated  the Christian women and children who wanted to buy there. By means of  the well-known Dumowski a new paper, Dwa Groszi, was started, which  simply urged pogroms. It soon came to bloody struggles. Polish  undergraduates killed an old Jew in the Sliska Street in Warsaw. In the  little town of Welun peasants poured naphtha on the house of a Jew and  put fire to it, burning a large family. Similar acts occurred in several  other places, until the Russian Government stopped this pogrom movement  in order to prevent the Polish nationalism from getting stronger.    The Polish priests in the villages incited the people from the pulpit to  boycotting of and war against the Jews. After the sentence in the Beilis  action the Polish newspapers were almost alone in publishing on  circulars the information that Beilis had been acquitted, but that the  existence of religious murder had been satisfactorily proved. Nay, the  free thinker, Nemojewski, wrote a book, in which he maintained the  monstrous lie that Jewish religious murders are facts, and traveled all  over the country with an agitatorial lecture to the same purpose.    Under these circumstances, the Jews in Russian Poland turned to the few  men whose names were so esteemed or whose characters were so  unimpeachable that their words could not be unheeded.    Ladislas Mickiewicz, the excellent son of the great Mickiewicz, who had  passed his whole life in Paris, first as a publisher and translator of  the works of his father, and then as a Polish patriotic author,  convened, together with some other prominent men, a great meeting at  Warsaw to restore the inner peace. In vain he begged and besought his  countrymen, who had enemies enough otherwise, not to act as enemies of  the Jews, who had always been their friends. No Polish newspaper gave  any report of his speech.    All this took place before the war. The provisional result was the  economic destruction of the Russian-Polish Jews. But now during the war  the glow of the bloody hatred of the Jews has blazed out in far stronger  flames and the Russian Government has as yet done nothing to subdue or  quench the fire.    During the mobilization several Polish newspapers, for instance, The  Glos Lubelski, brought the alarming news in heavy type: \"In England  great pogroms against the Jews. The English Government does not check  them.\" The paper was conscious of the lie. But the question was to set  an example to follow.    When the lack of gold and silver began to be felt the Polish newspapers  accused the Jews of hiding the valuable metals. On closer examination,  it was found that many non-Jewish business people (for instance,  Ignaschewski in Lublin, a very rich Pole) were withholding whole bags  full of gold and silver coins, for which they were punished rather  severely; but this was not proved against a single Jew.    Furthermore, the Jews were, among other things, accused of having  smuggled in a coffin 1,500,000 rubles in gold into Germany; and the  protest against the accusation entered by the representatives and  ministers of the Jewish congregation at Warsaw was printed in Russian  papers, but not in a single Polish one.    All these things were preparations for pogroms; but many others were  made. The anti-Semites printed a proclamation in Yiddish in which the  Jews were called upon to revolt against Russia; they took care that this  proclamation was put into the pockets of the unsuspecting Jews in the  streets of the different towns; those who had distributed the papers  denounced the party concerned to the police. Everybody upon whom the  proclamation was found was shot.    At last the Jews were, as in the Middle Ages, both in word and writing  accused of having poisoned the wells. If some Cossacks or other Russian  soldiers died, the Poles accused the Jews of having caused their death.    The chief accusation was, however, the accusation of espionage, which  obtained general credence and was used both when Austrian troops came to  some town or village and when Russian troops expelled the Austrians. The  result was the same. A suitable number of Jews were conscientiously shot  by the Russians as well as by the Austrians. There are, however, lists  of those who really have been unmasked as spies. A Potocki was among  them, and had to pay for it with his life; but no Jewish name is found  on these lists.    The accusation is, however, always believed, as the Jew has, for about  two thousand years, been characterized as Judas.    The legend about Judas may without exaggeration be described as one of  the most foolish legends of antiquity; that it has been believed is one  proof among thousands of the indescribable simplicity of mankind. Few  legends carry like it the stamp of lie on their faces and few legends  have millennium after millennium caused so many evils and horrors. It  has tortured and murdered by hundred thousands.    According to the supposition the story is impossible. The supposition is  that a man in possession of superhuman attributes, a god or a demi-god,  day after day goes about and speaks in the open air in a town and its  neighborhood. So little does he make a secret of his doings that a short  time before he had made his entry at broad daylight, welcomed with  exultation by the whole population. He is known by each and all, by each  woman and each child. So little does he want to hide that he walks about  accompanied by his disciples, preaching day and night, sleeping among  them. And to think it should be necessary to buy one of his disciples to  denounce him and deliver him, to betray him, and that--for the sake of  the effect--with a kiss! Indeed if he had hidden in some cellar, then  there would be some meaning in it; but as things are, those who seek  him need only ask: which of you is Jesus? He would not have tried to  deny his name.    Judas is then not only quite superfluous, but an absurdity, the origin  of which is to be found in the desire to place the black traitor  opposite the white hero of light and in the hatred of Jews arising among  the first Gentile Christians, who later made the world forget that not  only this straw-doll, Judas, but also Jesus and all the Apostles, all  the Disciples and all the evangelists were Jews.    Nevertheless, in the conception of the rude masses this Judas--as he was  called--has become the Jew, the typical Jew, the traitor, and the spy.    Still as late as in the last decennium of the last century, Capt. Alfred  Dreyfus fell a victim to this old foolish legend.    And now it is again rehashed against the Jews in Russian Poland.    The pogroms have, by virtue of these Judas accusations and the many  other dreadful accusations, spread all over Russian Poland and there  they are spreading more and more, while Galicia as well as Posen has  proved susceptible to the incitations which have not failed. Many  hundreds of innocent people have fallen victims to them.    Here are a few instances from many:    In the town of Bechava, conquered by the Austrians, the Polish leaders,  among whom was a very well-known estate owner, applied to the Austrian  commandant, accusing the Jews of secret connection with the Russian  Army. In consequence of this the Austrians killed a 67-year-old man  called Wallstein, and his 17-year-old son. When, after a short time, the  Austrians were driven away, the same estate owner accused the Jews of  the town to the Russian commandant of being in communication with the  Austrians, having delivered to them all provisions for the purpose of  depriving the Russians of them. In consequence of his accusation, many  Jews were shot and their houses burned down.    In the towns of Janow and Krasnik the Jews were accused of having put  out mines to destroy the Russians. The Jews, and among them many  children, were hanged on the telegraph"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/18891"],[0,"Dot and the Kangaroo (#16)"],[1,"travelled a long distance. At about noon they came to  a part of the country which the Kangaroo said she knew well. \"But we  must be careful,\" she added, \"as we are very near Humans in this part.\"    As Dot was tired (for she had had to walk much more than usual) the  Kangaroo suggested that she should rest at the pretty spot they had  reached, whilst she herself went in search of Willy Wagtail. Dot had to  promise the Kangaroo over and over again, not to leave the spot during  her absence. She was afraid lest the little girl should get lost, like  the little Joey.    After many farewells, and much hopping back to give Dot warnings and  make promises of returning soon, the Kangaroo went in search of Willy  Wagtail; and the little girl was left all alone.    Dot looked for a nice shady nook, in which to lie down and rest; and she  found the place so cheerful and pretty, that she was not afraid of being  alone. She was in the hollow of an old watercourse. It was rather like  an English forest glade, it was so open and grassy; and here and there  were pretty shrubs, and little hillocks and hollows. At first Dot  thought that she would sit on the branch of a huge tree that had but  recently fallen, and lay forlornly clothed in withered leaves; but  opposite to this dead giant of the Bush was a thick shrub with a decayed  tree stump beside it, that made a nice sheltered corner which she liked  better. So Dot laid herself down there, and in a few minutes she was  fast asleep; though, as she dropped off into the land of dreams, she  thought how wonderfully quiet that little glade was, and felt somewhat  surprised to find no Bush creatures to keep her company.    Some time before Dot woke, her dreams became confused and strange. There  seemed to be great crowds in them, and the murmur of many voices talking  together. As she gradually awakened, she realized that the voices were  real, and not a part of her dreams. There was a great hubbub, a  fluttering of wings, and rustling of leaves and grass. Through all this  confusion, odd sentences became clear to her drowsy senses. Such phrases  as, \"You'd better perch here!\" \"This isn't your place!\" \"Go over there!\"  \"No! no! I'm sure I'm right! the Welcome Swallow says so.\" \"Has anyone  gone for the Opossum?\" \"He says the Court ought to be held at night!\"  \"Don't make such a noise or you will wake the prisoner;\" \"Who is to be  the Judge?\" This last enquiry provoked such a noise of diverse opinions,  that Dot became fully awake, and sitting up, gazed around with eyes full  of astonishment.    When she had fallen asleep there had not been a creature near her;  but now she was literally hemmed in on every side by birds and small  animals. The branches of the fallen tree were covered with a feathered  company, and in the open space between it and Dot's nook, was a  constantly increasing crowd of larger birds, such as cranes, plover,  duck, turkey-buzzards, black swan, and amongst them a great grave  Pelican. The animals were few, and apparently came late. There was a  little timid Wallaby, a Bandicoot, some Kangaroo Rats, a shy Wombat who  grumbled about the daylight, as also did a Native Bear and an Opossum,  who were really driven to the gathering by a bevy of screaming parrots.    Dot was wide awake at once with delight. Nearly every creature she had  ever heard of seemed to be present, and the brilliant colours of the  parrots and parrakeets made the scene as gay as a rainbow in a summer  noonday sky.    \"Oh! you darlings!\" she said, \"how good of you all to come and see me!\"    This greeting from Dot caused an instant silence amongst the creatures,  and she could not help seeing that they looked very uncomfortable. There  was soon a faint whispering from bird to bird, which rose higher and  higher, until Dot made out that they were all saying, \"She ought to be  told!\" \"You tell her!\" \"No, you tell her yourself, it's not my  business!\" and every bird--for it was the birds who by reason of their  larger numbers took the lead in the proceedings--seemed to be trying to  shift an unpleasant task upon its neighbours.    Presently the solemn Pelican waddled forward and stood before Dot,  saying to the assemblage, \"I will explain our presence.\" Addressing the  little girl it said, \"We are here to place you on trial for the wrongs  we Bush creatures have suffered from the cruelties of White Humans. You  will meet with all fairness in your trial, as the proceedings will be  conducted according to the custom of your own Courts of Justice. The  Welcome Swallow, having built its nest for three successive seasons  under the eaves of the Gabblebabble Court House, is deeply learned in  human law business, and will instruct us how to proceed. Your conviction  will, therefore, leave you no room for complaint so far as your trial is  concerned.\"    All the birds clapped their wings in applause at the conclusion of this  speech, and the Pelican was told by the Welcome Swallow that he should  plead as Prosecutor.    \"What do you mean by 'Plead as Prosecutor?'\" asked the Pelican gravely.    \"You've got to get the prisoner convicted as guilty, whether she is so  or not,\" answered the Swallow, making a dart at a mosquito, which it ate  with relish.    \"Oh!\" said the Pelican, doubtfully; and all the creatures looked at one  another as if they didn't quite understand the justice of the  arrangement.    \"But,\" said the Pelican, hesitating a little, \"suppose I don't think the  prisoner guilty? She seems very small, and harmless.\"    \"That doesn't matter at all, you've got to get her made out as guilty by  the jury. It's good human law,\" snapped the Swallow, and all the  creatures said \"_Oh!_\" \"Now for the defence,\" said the Swallow briskly;  \"there ought to be someone for that. Who is friendly with the King?\"    \"Who's the King?\" asked all the creatures breathlessly.    \"He's a bigger Human than the rest, and everybody's business is his  business, so he's always going to law.\"    \"I know,\" said the Magpie, and she piped out six bars of \"God save the  King.\"    \"You are the one for the defence!\" said the Swallow, quite delighted, as  were all the other creatures, at the Magpie's accomplishment; \"you must  save the prisoner from the jury finding her guilty.\"    \"But,\" objected the Magpie, \"how can I? when only last fruit season my  brother, and two sisters, and six cousins were shot just because they  ate a few grapes.\"    \"That doesn't matter! you've got to get her off, I tell you!\" said the  Swallow, irritably; \"go over there, and ask her what you are to say.\" So  the Magpie flew over to Dot's side, and she at once began to teach it  the rest of \"God save the King.\"    \"I like this game,\" Dot presently said to the Magpie.    \"Do you?\" said the Magpie with surprise; \"It seems to me very slow, and  there's no sense in it.\"    \"Why are the birds all perching together over there?\" asked Dot,  pointing to a branch of the dead tree, \"since they all hate one another  and want to get away. The Galahs have pecked the Butcher Bird twice in  five minutes, the Peeweet keeps quarrelling with the Soldier Bird, and  none of them can bear the English Sparrow.\"    [Illustration: THE COURT OF ANIMALS]    \"The Swallow says that's the jury,\" answered the Magpie. \"Their business  is to do just what they like with you when all the talking is done, and  whether they find you guilty or not, will depend on if they are tired,  or hungry, and feel cross; or if the trial lasts only a short time, and  they are pleased with the grubs that will be brought them presently.\"    \"How funny,\" said Dot, not a bit alarmed at all these preparations for  her trial, for she loved all the creatures so much, that she could not  think that any of them wished to hurt her.    \"If this is human law,\" said the Magpie, \"it isn't funny at all; it is  mad, or wicked. Fancy my having to defend a Human!\"    At this point of their conversation, the ill-feeling amongst the jury  broke out into open fighting, because the English Sparrow was a  foreigner, and they said that it would certainly sympathize with the  Humans who had brought it to Australia. This was just an excuse to get  rid of it. The Sparrow said that it wanted to go out of the jury, and  had never wished to belong to it, and flew away joyfully. Then all the  rest of the jury grumbled at the good luck of the Sparrow in getting out  of the trial--for they could see it picking up grass seed and enjoying  itself greatly, whilst they were all crowded together on one branch, and  were feeling hungry before the trial had even begun.    There was great suspense and quiet while the Judge was being chosen.  Although Dot had eaten the berries of understanding, it was generally  considered that, to be quite fair, the Judge must be able to understand  human talk; and, amidst much clapping of wings, a large white Cockatoo  was appointed.    The Cockatoo lost no time in clambering \"into position\" on the stump  near Dot. \"You're quite sure you understand human talk?\" Said the little  Wallaby to the Cockatoo. It was the first remark he had made, for he had  been quite bewildered by all the noise and fuss.    \"My word! yes,\" replied the Cockatoo, who had been taught in a public  refreshment room. Then, thinking that he would give a display of his  learning, he elevated his sulphur crest and gabbled off, \"Go to Jericho!  Twenty to one on the favourite! I'm your man! Now then, ma'am; hurry up,  don't keep the coach waiting! Give 'um their 'eds, Bill! So long!  Ta-ra-ra, boom-di-ay! God save the King!\"    All the creatures present looked gravely at Dot, to see what effect this  harangue in her own language would have upon her, and were somewhat  surprised to see her holding her little sides, and rolling about with  laughter.    The Cockatoo was quite annoyed at Dot's amusement. He fluffed out all  his feathers, and let off a scream that could have been heard a quarter  of a mile away. This seemed to impress"]]]
