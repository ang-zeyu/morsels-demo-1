The Christmas of 1332 is memorable in Scottish annals as the time of  the defeat of Edward Balliol, the \"phantom king\" of Scotland. His  success was as unreal as a dream. He was solemnly crowned at Scone in  the month of September, 1332, fondly imagining that he had permanently  conquered the patriotic Scottish nobles who had opposed him. His  reign, however, only lasted for a few months. The leaders of the  national party suddenly assembled a force, and attacked him, while he  was feasting at Annan, in Dumfriesshire, where he had gone to keep his  Christmas. A body of horse under Sir Archibald, the young Earl of  Moray, and Sir Simon Fraser, made a dash into the town to surprise  Balliol, and he escaped only by springing upon a horse without any  saddle, leaving behind him his brother Henry slain. Balliol escaped to  England and was kindly received by Edward III., who afterwards made  fresh expeditions into Scotland to support him. \"Whenever the English  king appeared the Scots retired to their mountain fastnesses, while  Edward and his army overran the country with little opposition, burnt  the houses, and laid waste the lands of those whom he styled rebels;  but whenever he returned to England they came forth again, only the  more embittered against the contemptible minion of the English king,  the more determined against the tyranny of England. The regent, Sir  Andrew Murray, pursued, with untiring activity, Balliol and his  adherents. When Edward marched homeward to spend in London the  Christmas of 1336, he left Scotland to all appearance prostrate, and  flattered himself that it was completely subdued. Never was it further  from such a condition. Only one spirit animated the Scottish  nation--that of eternal resistance to the monarch who had inflicted on  it such calamities, and set a slave on its throne.\"[23]      COTTAGE CHRISTMAS-KEEPING IN THE FOURTEENTH CENTURY.    At this period the greatest of the Bishops of Winchester, William of  Wykeham, was a schoolboy. He was born of humble parents, educated at  Winchester school, and afterwards became secretary to Uvedale, Lord of  Wickham Manor, through whom he was introduced to King Edward III. In  his interesting \"Story of the Boyhood of William of Wykeham,\" the Rev.  W. A. C. Chevalier thus pictures William's Christmas holidays:--    \"Three days after William's arrival home was Christmas-eve. There were  great preparations in the cottage for spending Christmas worthily, for  if there was one thing more than another that John Longe believed in,  it was the proper keeping of Christmas. It was a part of the worthy  yeoman's faith. He was a humble and thorough believer in all the  tenets of Christianity, he worshipped the Saviour and adored His  Nativity, but his faith was a cheerful one, and he thought he best  honoured his Master by enjoying the good gifts which He sent. Hence  it was a part of his creed to be jovial at Christmas-tide. And so  Dame Alice had been busy all that day, and a part of the day before,  making Christmas pies, dressing Christmas meats, and otherwise making  ready for the great festival. John Longe, too, had not been idle. He  and his men had been working hard all day getting in huge Yule-logs  for the great kitchen fire, whilst William and little Agnes had been  employed in decorating the kitchen with evergreens and mistletoe,  displaying in great profusion the red berries of the holly bushes.  Everything was decked with evergreens, from the cups and platters on  the shelves to the hams and bacon hanging from the ceiling.\"    At length the preparations were completed; then came the telling of  tales and cheerful gossip round the blazing fire on Christmas Eve, and  the roasting of chestnuts on the embers. \"Christmas Day passed at the  little homestead with all the social and religious honours that the  honest yeoman could think of. The little household attended the  service of Mass in the morning, and then, with clear consciences and  simple hearts, spent the rest of the day in domestic and convivial  enjoyment.\"    Returning to royalty, we next see illustrated Froissart's statement  that \"Edward the third was right fortunate and happy in armes.\"      EDWARD THE THIRD'S VICTORIES AND FESTIVITIES.    [Illustration]    During the invasion of France, Edward III. raised the martial glory of  England by his splendid victories at Crecy, Poictiers, and other  places; and he kept Christmas right royally with his soldiers on  French soil. After the battle of Crecy, at which the Prince of Wales  gained the celebrated title of the Black Prince, Edward marched upon  Calais, and laid siege to it; and at length he took the place. During  Edward's absence, England was invaded by David II. of Scotland, who  was defeated and taken prisoner by the army under Philippa, Edward's  Queen. The brave Queen then joined King Edward on the French  battle-ground, and they kept the Christmas of 1346 with much  rejoicing.    During the Christmas festivities of this period the most noble Order  of the Garter was instituted by King Edward III. to excite emulation  amongst the aristocratic warriors of the time, in imitation of orders  of a similar kind, both religious and military, which had been  instituted by different monarchs of Europe; and that those who were  admitted to the order were enjoined to exalt the religion of Christ  is evident from some lines which Chaucer addressed to the Lords and  Knights--     \"Do forth, do forth, continue your succour,    Hold up Christ's banner, let it not fall.\"    And again--     \"Ye Lordis eke, shining in noble fame,    To which appropered is the maintenance    Of Christ 'is cause; in honour of his name,    Shove on, and put his foes to utterance.\"    In imitation of King Arthur, Edward III. set up at Windsor a Round  Table, which was consecrated with feasts and tournaments, and baptized  with the blood of the brave. On New Year's Day, 1344, he issued his  royal letters of protection for the safe-coming and return of foreign  knights to the solemn jousts which he appointed to be held at Windsor  on St. Hilary's Day, in extension of the Christmas festivities. The  festival was opened with a splendid supper; and the next day, and  until Lent, all kinds of knightly feats of arms were performed. \"The  queen and her ladies,\" says an old historian, \"that they might with  more convenience behold this spectacle, were orderly seated upon a  firm ballustrade, or scaffold, with rails before it, running all round  the lists. And certainly their extraordinary beauties, set so  advantageously forth with excessive riches of apparel, did prove a  sight as full of pleasant encouragement to the combatants, as the  fierce hacklings of men and horses, gallantly armed, were a delightful  terror to the feminine beholders.\"    [Illustration: LADIES LOOKING FROM THE HUSTINGS UPON THE TOURNAMENT.]    In 1348 Edward III. kept a grand Christmas at Guildford. \"Orders were  given to manufacture for the Christmas sports eighty tunics of buckram  of different colours, and a large number of masks--some with faces of  women, some with beards, some like angel heads of silver. There were  to be mantles embroidered with heads of dragons, tunics wrought with  heads and wings of peacocks, and embroidered in many other fantastic  ways. The celebration of Christmas lasted from All Hallow's Eve, the  31st of October, till the day after the Purification, the 3rd of  February. At the court a lord of misrule was appointed, who reigned  during the whole of this period, and was called 'the master of merry  disports.' He ruled over and organised all the games and sports, and  during the period of his rule there was nothing but a succession of  masques, disguisings, and dances of all kinds. All the nobles, even  the Mayor of London, had an officer of this kind chosen in their  households. Dancing was a very favourite amusement. It was practised  by the nobility of both sexes. The damsels of London spent their  evenings in dancing before their masters' doors, and the country  lasses danced upon the village green.\"[24]    [Illustration: THE LORD OF MISRULE.]    A Royal Christmas was kept at Westminster, with great splendour, in  1358, when King Edward had two crowned guests at his feast; but these  were present from no choice of their own: they were the victims to the  fortune of war at Poictiers and Neville's Cross. And in  1362, King David of Scotland and the King of Cyprus met at King  Edward's grand entertainments.

Again he left them to go on another expedition. The sun he had brought  lighted up the earth for only a short time, and in the land from which  he had brought it he had noticed another body, which served as a lamp  in the dark hours. He resolved therefore to journey and bring back  with him the moon; so, bidding adieu to his children and his dwelling,  he set forth once more.    While he had been absent on his first expedition, his children had  eaten up all the white food, and now, when he set out, he forgot to  provide them with a fresh supply. For a long time they resisted the  craving for food, but at last they could hold out no longer, and  satisfied their hunger with the black fruit.    The old Chippeway soon returned, bringing with him the moon. He soon  discovered that his children had transgressed his command, and had  eaten the food of disease and death. He told them what was the  consequence of their act--that in future the earth would produce bad  fruits, that sickness would come amongst men, that pain would rack  them, and their lives be lives of fatigue and danger.    Having brought the sun and moon to the earth, the old man Chippeway  rested, and made no more expeditions. He lived an immense number of  years, and saw all the troubles he declared would follow the eating of  the black food. At last he became tired of life, and his sole desire  was to be freed from it.    \"Go,\" said he, to one of his sons, \"to the river of the Bear Lake, and  fetch me a man of the little wise people (the beavers). Let it be one  with a brown ring round the end of the tail, and a white spot on the  tip of the nose. Let him be just two seasons old upon the first day  of the coming frog-moon, and see that his teeth be sharp.\"    The man did as he was directed. He went to the river of the Bear Lake,  and brought a man of the little wise people. He had a brown ring round  the end of his tail, and a white spot on the tip of his nose. He was  just two seasons old upon the first day of the frog-moon, and his  teeth were very sharp.    \"Take the wise four-legged man,\" said the old Chippeway, \"and pull  from his jaws seven of his teeth.\"    The man did as he was directed, and brought the teeth to the old man.  Then he bade him call all his people together, and when they were come  the old man thus addressed them--    \"I am old, and am tired of life, and wish to sleep the sleep of death.  I will go hence. Take the seven teeth of the wise little four-legged  man and drive them into my body.\"    They did so, and as the last tooth entered him the old man died.          MUKUMIK! MUKUMIK! MUKUMIK!      Pauppukkeewis was a harum-scarum fellow who played many queer tricks,  but he took care, nevertheless, to supply his family and children with  food. Sometimes, however, he was hard-pressed, and once he and his  whole family were on the point of starving. Every resource seemed to  have failed. The snow was so deep, and the storm continued so long,  that he could not even find a partridge or a hare, and his usual  supply of fish had failed him. His lodge stood in some woods not far  away from the shores of the Gitchiguma, or great water, where the  autumnal storms had piled up the ice into high pinnacles, resembling  castles.    \"I will go,\" said he to his family one morning, \"to these castles, and  solicit the pity of the spirits who inhabit them, for I know that they  are the residence of some of the spirits of Rabiboonoka.\"    He did so, and his petition was not disregarded. The spirits told him  to fill his mushkemoots or sacks with the ice and snow, and pass on  towards his lodge, without looking back, until he came to a certain  hill. He was then to drop his sacks, and leave them till morning,  when he would find them full of fish.    The spirits cautioned him that he must by no means look back, although  he should hear a great many voices crying out to him abusing him; for  they told him such voices would be in reality only the wind playing  through the branches of the trees.    Pauppukkeewis faithfully obeyed the directions given him, although he  found it difficult to avoid looking round to see who was calling to  him. When he visited the sacks in the morning, he found them filled  with fish.    It happened that Manabozho visited him on the morning when he brought  the fish home, and the visitor was invited to partake of the feast.  While they were eating, Manabozho could not help asking where such an  abundance of food had been procured at a time when most were in a  state of starvation.    Pauppukkeewis frankly told him the secret, and and what precautions to  take to ensure success. Manabozho determined to profit by the  information, and, as soon as he could, set out to visit the icy  castles. All things happened as Pauppukkeewis had told him. The  spirits appeared to be kind, and told Manabozho to fill and carry. He  accordingly filled his sacks with ice and snow, and then walked off  quickly to the hill where he was to leave them. As he went, however,  he heard voices calling out behind him.    \"Thief! thief! He has stolen fish from Rabiboonoka,\" cried one.    \"Mukumik! Mukumik! take it away, take it away,\" cried another.    Manabozho's ears were so assailed by all manner of insulting cries,  that at last he got angry, and, quite forgetting the directions given  him, he turned his head to see who it was that was abusing him. He saw  no one, and proceeded on his way to the hill, to which he was  accompanied by his invisible tormentors. He left his bags of ice and  snow there, to be changed into fish, and came back the next morning.  His disobedience had, however, dissolved the charm, and he found his  bags still full of rubbish.    In consequence of this he is condemned every year, during the month of  March, to run over the hills, with Pauppukkeewis following him,  crying--    \"Mukumik! Mukumik!\"          THE SWING BY THE LAKE.      There was an old hag of a woman who lived with her daughter-in-law and  her husband, with their son and a little orphan boy. When her  son-in-law came home from hunting, it was his custom to bring his wife  the moose's lip, the kidney of the bear, or some other choice bits of  different animals. These the girl would cook crisp, so that the sound  of their cracking could be heard when she ate them. This kind  attention of the hunter to his wife aroused the envy of the old woman.  She wished to have the same luxuries, and, in order to obtain them,  she at last resolved to kill the young wife. One day she asked her to  leave her infant son to the care of the orphan boy, and come out and  swing with her. The wife consented, and the mother-in-law took her to  the shore of a lake, where there was a high ridge of rocks overhanging  the water. Upon the top of these rocks the old woman put up a swing,  and, having fastened a piece of leather round her body, she commenced  to swing herself, going over the precipice each time. She continued  this for a short while, and then, stopping, told her daughter-in-law  to take her place. She did so, and, having tied the leather round her,  began to swing backwards and forwards. When she was well going,  sweeping at each turn clear beyond the precipice, the old woman slyly  cut the cords, and let her drop into the lake. She then put on some of  the girl's clothing, entered the lodge in the dusk of the evening, and  went about the work in which her daughter-in-law had been usually  occupied at such a time. She found the child crying, and, since the  mother was not there to give it the breast, it cried on. Then the  orphan boy asked her where the mother was.    \"She is still swinging,\" replied the old woman.    \"I will go,\" said he, \"and look for her.\"    \"No,\" said the old woman, \"you must not. What would you go for?\"    In the evening, when the husband came in, he gave the coveted morsels  to what he supposed was his wife. He missed the old woman, but asked  nothing about her. Meanwhile the woman ate the morsels, and tried to  quiet the child. The husband, seeing that she kept her face away from  him, was astonished, and asked why the child cried so. His pretended  wife answered that she did not know.    In the meantime the orphan boy went to the shores of the lake, where  he found no one. Then he suspected the old woman, and, having returned  to the lodge, told the hunter, while she was out getting wood, all he  had heard and seen. The man, when he had heard the story, painted his  face black, and placed his spear upside down in the earth, and  requested the Great Spirit to send lightning, thunder, and rain, in  the hope that the body of his wife might arise from the water. He then  began to fast, and told the boy to take the child and play upon the  lake shore.    Meanwhile this is what had happened to the wife. After she had plunged  into the lake, she found herself in the hold of a water-tiger, who  drew her to the bottom. There she found a lodge, and all things in it  as if arranged for her reception, and she became the water-tiger's  wife.    Whilst the orphan boy and the child were playing on the shore of the  lake one day, the boy began to throw pebbles into the water, when  suddenly a gull arose from the centre of the lake, and flew towards  the land. When it had arrived there, it took human shape, and the boy  recognised that it was the lost mother. She had a leather belt around  her, and another belt of white metal. She suckled the baby, and,  preparing to return to the water, said to the boy--    \"Come here with the child whenever it cries, and I will nurse it.\"    The boy carried the child home, and told the father what had occurred.  When the child cried again, the man went with the boy to the shore,  and hid himself behind a clump of trees. Soon the gull made its  appearance, with a long shining chain attached to it. The bird came to  the shore, assumed the mother's shape,"]]]
