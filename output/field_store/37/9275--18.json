[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/18127"],[0,"The Beginner's American History (#16)"],[1,"he was to be known and honored all over  the world. The name of that boy was George Washington.    Washington's father died when George was only eleven years old,  leaving him, with his brothers and sisters, to the care of a most  excellent and sensible mother. It was that mother's influence more  than anything else which made George the man he became.    [Illustration: WASHINGTON'S SIGNATURE AT THE AGE OF 12.]    George went to a little country school, where he learned to read,  write, and cipher. By the time he was twelve, he could write a clear,  bold hand. In one of his writing-books he copied many good rules or  sayings. Here is one:--    [Illustration: \"Labor to keep alive in your breast that little spark  of celestial fire called conscience.\"[2]]    [Footnote 1: Plantation: George Washington was born on a plantation  (or large estate cultivated by slaves) on Bridges Creek, a small  stream emptying into the Potomac. See map in paragraph 127. Not long  after George's birth (February 22, 1732), his father moved to an  estate on the Rappahannock River, opposite Fredericksburg. See map  in paragraph 127 for this place and Mount Vernon.]    [Footnote 2: Celestial: heavenly, divine.]      124. Washington's sports and games; playing at war; \"Captain  George.\"--But young Washington was not always copying good sayings;  for he was a tall, strong boy, fond of all out-door sports and games.  He was a well-meaning boy, but he had a hot temper, and at times his  blue eyes flashed fire. In all trials of strength and in all deeds  of daring, George took the lead; he could run faster, jump further,  and throw a stone higher than any one in the school.    When the boys played \"soldier,\" they liked to have \"Captain George\"  as commander. When he drew his wooden sword, and shouted Come on!  they would all rush into battle with a wild hurrah. Years afterward,  when the real war came, and George Washington drew his sword in  earnest, some of his school companions may have fought under their  old leader.      125. The great battle with the colt, and what came of it.--Once,  however, Washington had a battle of a different kind. It was with  a high-spirited colt which belonged to his mother. Nobody had ever  been able to do anything with that colt, and most people were afraid  of him. Early one morning, George and some of his brothers were out  in the pasture. George looked at the colt prancing about and kicking  up his heels. Then he said: \"Boys, if you'll help me put a bridle  on him, I'll ride him.\" The boys managed to get the colt into a corner  and to slip on the bridle. With a leap, George seated himself firmly  on his back. Then the fun began. The colt, wild with rage, ran, jumped,  plunged, and reared straight up on his hind legs, hoping to throw  his rider off. It was all useless; he might as well have tried to  throw off his own skin, for the boy stuck to his back as though he  had grown there. Then, making a last desperate bound into the air,  the animal burst a blood-vessel and fell dead. The battle was over,  George was victor, but it had cost the life of Mrs. Washington's  favorite colt.    [Illustration: WASHINGTON'S HOME WHEN A BOY.]    When the boys went in to breakfast, their mother, knowing that they  had just come from the pasture, asked how the colt was getting on.  \"He is dead, madam,\" said George; \"I killed him.\" \"Dead!\" exclaimed  his mother. \"Yes, madam, dead,\" replied her son. Then he told her  just how it happened. When Mrs. Washington heard the story, her face  flushed with anger. Then, waiting a moment, she looked steadily at  George, and said quietly, \"While I regret the loss of my favorite,  I rejoice in my son, who always speaks the truth.\"      126. Washington goes on a visit to Mount Vernon; he makes the  acquaintance of Lord Fairfax.--George's eldest brother, Lawrence  Washington, had married the daughter of a gentleman named  Fairfax,[3] who lived on the banks of the Potomac. Lawrence had a  fine estate a few miles above, on the same river; he called his place  Mount Vernon. When he was fourteen, George went to Mount Vernon to  visit his brother.    Lawrence Washington took George down the river to call on the  Fairfaxes. There the lad made the acquaintance of Lord Fairfax, an  English nobleman who had come over from London. He owned an immense  piece of land in Virginia. Lord Fairfax and George soon became great  friends. He was a gray-haired man nearly sixty, but he enjoyed having  this boy of fourteen as a companion. They spent weeks together on  horseback in the fields and woods, hunting deer and foxes.    [Footnote 3: Fairfax. This was the Hon. William Fairfax; he was  cousin to Lord Fairfax, and he had the care of Lord Fairfax's land.]      127. Lord Fairfax hires Washington to survey[4] his land; how  Washington lived in the woods; the Indian war-dance.--Lord Fairfax's  land extended westward more than a hundred miles. It had never been  very carefully surveyed; and he was told that settlers were moving  in beyond the Blue Ridge Mountains,[5] and were building log-cabins  on his property without asking leave. By the time Washington was  sixteen, he had learned surveying; and so Lord Fairfax hired him to  measure his land for him. Washington was glad to undertake the work;  for he needed the money, and he could earn in this way from five to  ten dollars a day.    [Illustration: Map illustrating Washington's early life.]    Early in the spring, Washington, in company with another young man,  started off on foot to do this business. They crossed the Blue Ridge  Mountains, and entered the Valley of Virginia, one of the most  beautiful valleys in America.    The two young men would work all day in the woods with a long chain,  measuring the land. When evening came, Washington would make a map  of what they had measured. Then they would wrap themselves up in their  blankets, stretch themselves on the ground at the foot of a tree,  and go to sleep under the stars.    Every day they shot some game--squirrels or wild turkeys, or perhaps  a deer. They kindled a fire with flint and steel,[6] and roasted the  meat on sticks held over the coals. For plates they had clean chips;  and as clean chips could always be got by a few blows with an axe,  they never washed any dishes, but just threw them away, and had a  new set for each meal.    While in the Valley they met a band of Indians, who stopped and danced  a war-dance for them. The music was not remarkable,--for most of it  was made by drumming on a deer-skin stretched across the top of an  old iron pot,--but the dancing itself could not be beat. The savages  leaped into the air, swung their hatchets, gashed the trees, and  yelled till the woods rang.    [Illustration: WASHINGTON SEES AN INDIAN WAR-DANCE.]    When Washington returned from his surveying trip, Lord Fairfax was  greatly pleased with his work; and the governor of Virginia made him  one of the public surveyors. By this means he was able to get work  which paid him handsomely.    [Footnote 4: Survey: to find out the form, size, and position of a  piece of land by measuring it in certain ways.]    [Footnote 5: See map in this paragraph.]    [Footnote 6: Flint and steel: see picture in paragraph 84.]      128. Washington at the age of twenty-one; the French in the west;  the governor of Virginia sends Washington to see the French  commander.--By the time Washington was twenty-one he had grown to  be over six feet in height. He was straight as an arrow and tough  as a whip-lash. He had keen blue eyes that seemed to look into the  very heart of things, and his fist was like a blacksmith's  sledgehammer. He knew all about the woods, all about Indians, and  he could take care of himself anywhere.    At this time the English settlers held the country along the seashore  as far back as the Alleghany Mountains.[7] West of those mountains  the French from Canada were trying to get possession of the land.  They had made friends with many of the Indians, and they hoped, with  their help, to be able to drive out the English and get the whole  country for themselves.    In order to hold this land in the west, the French had built several  forts[8] south of Lake Erie, and they were getting ready to build  some on the Ohio River. The governor of Virginia was determined to  put a stop to this. He had given young Washington the military title  of major;[9] he now sent Major Washington to see the French commander  at one of the forts near Lake Erie. Washington was to tell the  Frenchman that he had built his forts on land belonging to the English,  and that he and his men must either leave or fight.    Major Washington dressed himself like an Indian, and attended by  several friendly Indians and by a white man named Gist,[10] who knew  the country well, he set out on his journey through what was called  the Great Woods.    The entire distance to the farthest fort and back was about a thousand  miles. Washington could go on horseback part of the way, but there  were no regular roads, and he had to climb mountains and swim rivers.  After several weeks' travel he reached the fort, but the French  commander refused to give up the land. He said that he and his men  had come to stay, and that if the English did not like it, they must  fight.    [Footnote 7: Alleghany (Al'le-ga'ni): see map in paragraph 127. (It  is also spelled Allegheny.)]    [Footnote 8: Forts: see map in paragraph 127.]    [Footnote 9: Major (ma'jer): an officer in the army next above a  captain, but below a colonel.]    [Footnote 10: Gist (Jist).]      129. The journey back; the Indian guide; how Washington found his  way through the woods; the adventure with the raft.--On the way back,  Washington had to leave his horses and come on foot with Gist and  an Indian guide sent from the fort. This Indian guide was in the pay  of the French, and he intended to murder Washington in the woods.  One day he shot at him from behind a tree, but"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/18134"],[0,"Sixteen Months in Four German Prisons: Wesel, Sennelager, Klingelputz, Ruhleben (#16)"],[1,"mad.    Later in the day an escort arrived, and to my surprise and intense  relief the officer informed me that I was not going to be shot. I took  this for an acquittal, but I was speedily disillusioned. I was taken to  the office of the Commandant.    Reaching this official I was surprised to see among a stack of other  baggage my own belongings. The Commandant sharply ordered me to sort my  things out, and to run through them to see that everything was intact. I  could have danced for joy. Like an excited child I fell upon the  baggage, disentangled my belongings, and ran through the contents. Two  purses and a camera were missing. I reported my loss, and there was a  terrific hullaballoo. Who had touched a prisoner's goods? The purses  were brought in by the gaoler, who declared to me that, finding they  contained money, he had put them in his pocket for safety. I smiled at  his ingenuous excuse. Now I worried about the missing camera, but this  defied discovery. Suddenly I remembered where I had seen it last and  kept quiet.    After I had gathered my luggage together I was marched back to my cell.  Again my spirits drooped upon being asked to give my English address. I  saw it all! In my highly strung condition I took this latest expression  of Teuton methods to mean that my goods were to be sent home, but that I  would have to suffer some dire penalty. I nursed this dark imagining  because the prison treatment was not relaxed one iota. I passed a  restless half-hour. I was heavy-eyed from want of sleep, while my face  had assumed a sickly, revolting pallor from rapidly collapsing health.    Again I was summoned to the Commandant's office. My goods were exactly  as I had left them thirty minutes before.    [*large gap]    I was busily strapping up my goods when the door opened to admit the  Commandant, guard and four other prisoners, whom I had not seen before.  One tall, good-looking, sprucely dressed fellow impressed me. He looked  like a fellow-countryman. I went up to him.    \"Are you English?\" I asked.    \"Holy smoke! What a treat to hear an Englishman. 'Put it there,'\" and he  extended his hand. I proffered mine which he shook as if it were a pump  handle. He with others had been arrested, not as spies, and had been  detained in Wesel Arresthaus. But being wealthy he had experienced an  easy time.    \"What are they going to do with us?\" I enquired.    \"Why, haven't you heard? They're going to send us to a hotel and then it  won't be long before we strike good old England once more!\"    [*large gap]    The party were in high spirits. But I was not so elated. I had every  occasion to be suspicious of German bluff and inwardly would only  believe we were going home when I was safely out of the country. My  fellow-countryman, F---- K----, who is a well-known figure in City  commercial circles, was wildly excited, and was discussing his future  arrangements very keenly.    An escort appeared to accompany us to the mysterious \"hotel\" about which  the Commandant had been talking so glibly. We swung out of the prison.  Glancing at the clock I saw the time was 8.30 p.m. As the main gate  clanged behind me I pulled myself together, a new man. My eight days'  solitary confinement had come to an end.    We tramped the street, the people taking but little notice of us.  Presently we met a big party of tourists advancing and also under  escort. They proved to be the passengers of the pleasure steamer  _Krimhilde_, who had been detained. When they saw me, unkempt, ragged,  blood-stained, and dirty they immediately drew away. They took me for an  excellent specimen of the genus hobo. Within a few seconds however they  learned something about my experiences and became very chummy. F----  K---- communicated the fact that we were bound for an hotel, and the  spirits of one and all rose.    The escort who had accompanied us from the prison here handed us over to  that accompanying the tourists and we marched to the station. A train  was waiting and we stepped aboard at nine o'clock. There appeared to be  as many soldiers as passengers. The members of my party confidently  thought the train was bound for a point near the frontier or a  restricted area by the seashore. But I was not to be lulled into a false  sense of security. I questioned one of the officers and ascertained our  destination. Returning to the party I laughingly asked, \"Do you know for  what hotel we're bound?\"    \"No! What is it? Where is it?\" came the eager request.    \"The military camp at Sennelager!\"          PRISON TWO--SENNELAGER    THE BLACK HOLE OF GERMANY          CHAPTER VI    OUR \"LUXURIOUS HOTEL\"      Although it was 9.25 Tuesday evening when we boarded the train in Wesel  station, _en route_ for the \"luxurious hotel where we were to receive  every kindness consistent with the noblest traditions of German honour,\"  there did not appear to be any anxiety to part with our company. There  were about sixty of us all told, and we were shepherded with as  pronounced a display of German military pomp and circumstance as would  have been manifested if the All-Highest himself, had been travelling.  Wesel station swarmed with officers and men who apparently had nothing  else to do but to perambulate the platforms, the officers swaggering  with typical Teuton arrogance, and the humble soldiers clattering to and  fro in utter servility, merely emphasising their existence by making  plenty of noise with their cumbrous boots and rifles.    At midnight the train started. The majority of my companions were the  male passengers of military age who had been detained from the pleasure  steamer _Krimhilde_ while travelling up the Rhine. The military  authorities in charge of the train received bulky sheafs of papers, each  of which related to one passenger, and was packed with the most minute  details. I am afraid my record must have been somewhat imposing,  inasmuch as I commanded considerable and unappreciated attention from  the military, while my fellow prisoners regarded me with a keen  curiosity.    I must admit that my personal appearance was far from being attractive.  I looked even more ragged, un-cared for, and ill than I was when facing  my accusers at the midnight trial some days before. I was shirtless,  collarless, and tie-less. My hair was matted and clotted with congealed  blood freely mixed with dirt. My face, in addition to a week's growth of  hair, was smeared with black marks which I had not been able to remove  owing to my inability to get soap to wash myself with. My frock-coat and  trousers, frayed at the bottoms, were sadly soiled and contrasted  strangely with the fancy pattern tops of my patent boots. In fact, I  admitted to the party, that \"I must have looked a 'knut' of the finest  type!\" All things considered I am not surprised that at first I was  shunned by one and all, both compatriots and the military guards.    Although the distance from Wesel to Paderborn--Sennelager is three miles  outside the latter town--is only about 95 miles as the crow flies, the  railway takes a somewhat circuitous route. Owing to the extensive  movement of the troops we suffered considerable delay, the result being  that we did not reach our destination until about mid-day on the  Wednesday, the journey having occupied nearly twelve hours. The heat was  unbearable, and confinement within the carriages, the windows of which  were kept sedulously closed by order of the military, thus rendering the  atmosphere within stifling, speedily commenced to affect some of the  passengers. Each compartment carried seven prisoners, and the eighth  seat, one of the windows beside the door, was occupied by a soldier--the  guard of the compartment--complete with loaded rifle and fixed bayonet.    Sleep was out of the question, but this did not affect us seriously. We  were somewhat excited, and spent the hours of the night in conversation  and the exchange of experiences. In our party was an English gentleman,  Mr. K----,[3] who held an important position in a large business house  in one of the cities on the Rhine. Somehow he was attracted to me,  moved, no doubt by my general appearance, and because I was now showing  visible signs of my incarceration and experiences in Wesel prison. I may  say that to Mr. K---- I undoubtedly owe my life, and I never can express  my thanks sufficiently for his unremitting attention and kindness during  my subsequent illness, as I narrate in due course. Moreover, during his  sojourn among us he was a tower of strength, having long been resident  in the country, and thoroughly conversant with the language and manners  of the Germans.        [Footnote 3: The names and occupations of fellow-prisoners who      are still in captivity are purposely disguised, because if the      German authorities should happen to read this narrative, and be      enabled to identify any of my compatriots who participated in      any of the incidents recorded, they would receive treatment      which would be decidedly detrimental to their welfare.--H.C.M.]    It was during this tedious train journey that he related the experiences  of the passengers upon the unfortunate steamer _Krimhilde_. Many of the  Englishmen who happened to be upon this boat had been held up for a week  in various towns, owing to the stress of mobilisation. But at last  permission was given by the authorities to proceed, and the delayed  travellers were assured of an uninterrupted journey to England.  Unfortunately the passage down the Rhine was impeded by fog, and this  delay proved fatal. When it was possible to resume the journey, and  while the steamer was making a good pace, a river patrol boat dashed up  and ordered the captain of the steamer to stop, the reason being that no  intimation had been received of the vessel's coming.    The captain protested, but at the point of the revolver he was compelled  to turn round and return to the place which he had left only a few hours  "]]]
