He may have done it on purpose.\"    \"How absurd!\"    \"Rather rough on the man, aren't you?\" I said.    \"Merely a suggestion,\" continued Mr. Chase airily. \"I've been reading  sensational novels lately, and it seems to me that Hawk's cut out to  be a minion. Probably some secret foe of the professor's bribed him.\"    My heart stood still. Did he know, I wondered, and was this all a  roundabout way of telling me that he knew?    \"The professor may be a member of an anarchist league, or something,  and this is his punishment for refusing to assassinate the Kaiser.\"    \"Have another cup of tea, Tom, and stop talking nonsense.\"    Mr. Chase handed in his cup.    \"What gave me the idea that the upset was done on purpose was this. I  saw the whole thing from the Ware cliff. The spill looked to me just  like dozens I had seen at Malta.\"    \"Why do they upset themselves on purpose at Malta particularly?\"  inquired Phyllis.    \"Listen carefully, my dear, and you'll know more about the ways of the  navy that guards your coasts than you did before. When men are allowed  on shore at Malta, the owner has a fancy to see them snugly on board  again at a certain reasonable hour. After that hour any Maltese  policeman who brings them aboard gets one sovereign, cash. But he has  to do all the bringing part of it on his own. Consequence is, you see  boats rowing out to the ship, carrying men who have overstayed their  leave; and, when they get near enough, the able-bodied gentleman in  custody jumps to his feet, upsets the boat, and swims to the gangway.  The policemen, if they aren't drowned--they sometimes are--race him,  and whichever gets there first wins. If it's the policeman, he gets  his sovereign. If it's the sailor, he is considered to have arrived  not in a state of custody, and gets off easier. What a judicious  remark that was of the Governor of North Carolina to the Governor of  South Carolina! Just one more cup, please, Phyllis.\"    \"But how does all that apply?\" I asked, dry-mouthed.    \"Why, Hawk upset the professor just as those Maltese were upset.  There's a patent way of doing it. Furthermore, by judicious  questioning, I found that Hawk was once in the navy, and stationed at  Malta. _Now_, who's going to drag in Sherlock Holmes?\"    \"You don't really think--\" I said, feeling like a criminal in the  dock when the case is going against him.    \"I think friend Hawk has been reenacting the joys of his vanished  youth, so to speak.\"    \"He ought to be prosecuted,\" said Phyllis, blazing with indignation.    Alas, poor Hawk!    \"Nobody's safe with a man of that sort hiring out a boat.\"    Oh, miserable Hawk!    \"But why on earth,\" I asked, as calmly as possible, \"should he play a  trick like that on Professor Derrick, Chase?\"    \"Pure animal spirits, probably. Or he may, as I say, be a minion.\"    I was hot all over.    \"I shall tell father that,\" said Phyllis in her most decided voice,  \"and see what he says. I don't wonder at the man taking to drink after  doing such a thing.\"    \"I--I think you're making a mistake,\" I said.    \"I never make mistakes,\" Mr. Chase replied. \"I am called Archibald the  All Right, for I am infallible. I propose to keep a reflective eye  upon the jovial Hawk.\"    He helped himself to another section of the chocolate cake.    \"Haven't you finished yet, Tom?\" inquired Phyllis. \"I'm sure Mr.  Garnet's getting tired of sitting talking here.\"    I shot out a polite negative. Mr. Chase explained with his mouth full  that he had by no means finished. Chocolate cake, it appeared, was the  dream of his life. When at sea he was accustomed to lie awake o'  nights thinking of it.    \"You don't seem to realize,\" he said, \"that I have just come from a  cruise on a torpedo boat. There was such a sea on, as a rule, that  cooking operations were entirely suspended, and we lived on ham and  sardines--without bread.\"    \"How horrible!\"    \"On the other hand,\" added Mr. Chase philosophically, \"it didn't  matter much, because we were all ill most of the time.\"    \"Don't be nasty, Tom.\"    \"I was merely defending myself. I hope Mr. Hawk will be able to do as  well when his turn comes. My aim, my dear Phyllis, is to show you in a  series of impressionist pictures the sort of thing I have to go  through when I'm not here. Then perhaps you won't rend me so savagely  over a matter of five minutes' lateness for breakfast.\"    \"Five minutes! It was three quarters of an hour, and everything was  simply frozen.\"    \"Quite right, too, in weather like this. You're a slave to convention,  Phyllis. You think breakfast ought to be hot, so you always have it  hot. On occasion I prefer mine cold. Mine is the truer wisdom. I have  scoffed the better part, as the good Kipling has it. You can give the  cook my compliments, Phyllis, and tell her--gently, for I don't wish  the glad news to overwhelm her--that I enjoyed that cake. Say that I  shall be glad to hear from her again. Care for a game of tennis,  Garnet?\"    \"What a pity Norah isn't here,\" said Phyllis. \"We could have had a  four.\"    \"But she is at present wasting her sweetness on the desert air of  Yeovil. You had better sit out and watch us, Phyllis. Tennis in this  sort of weather is no job for the delicately nurtured feminine. I will  explain the finer points of my play as we go on. Look out particularly  for the Doherty Back-handed Slosh. A winning stroke every time.\"    We proceeded to the tennis court. I played with the sun in my eyes. I  might, if I chose, emphasize that fact, and attribute my subsequent  rout to it, adding, by way of solidifying the excuse, that I was  playing in a strange court with a borrowed racket, and that my mind  was preoccupied--firstly, with _l'affaire_ Hawk; secondly, and  chiefly, with the gloomy thought that Phyllis and my opponent seemed  to be on fiendishly good terms with each other. Their manner at tea  had been almost that of an engaged couple. There was a thorough  understanding between them. I will not, however, take refuge behind  excuses. I admit, without qualifying the statement, that Mr. Chase was  too good for me. I had always been under the impression that  lieutenants in the royal navy were not brilliant at tennis. I had met  them at various houses, but they had never shone conspicuously. They  had played an earnest, unobtrusive game, and generally seemed glad  when it was over. Mr. Chase was not of this sort. His service was  bottled lightning. His returns behaved like jumping crackers. He won  the first game in precisely four strokes. He served. I know now how  soldiers feel under fire. The balls whistled at me like live things.  Only once did I take the service with the full face of the racket, and  then I seemed to be stopping a bullet. I returned it into the net.    \"Game,\" said Mr. Chase.    I felt a worm, and no man. Phyllis, I thought, would probably judge my  entire character from this exhibition. A man, she would reflect, who  could be so feeble and miserable a failure at tennis, could not be  good for much in any department of life. She would compare me  instructively with my opponent, and contrast his dash and brilliance  with my own inefficiency. Somehow, the massacre was beginning to have  a bad effect on my character. My self-respect was ebbing. A little  more of this, and I should become crushed--a mere human jelly. It was  my turn to serve. Service is my strong point at tennis. I am  inaccurate but vigorous, and occasionally send in a quite unplayable  shot. One or two of these, even at the expense of a fault or so, and I  might be permitted to retain at least a portion of my self-respect.    I opened with two faults. The sight of Phyllis, sitting calm and cool  in her chair under the cedar, unnerved me. I served another fault. And  yet another.    \"Here, I say, Garnet,\" observed Mr. Chase plaintively, \"do put me out  of this hideous suspense. I'm becoming a mere bundle of quivering  ganglions.\"    I loath facetiousness in moments of stress. I frowned austerely, made  no reply, and served another fault, my fifth.    Matters had reached a crisis. Even if I had to lob it under hand, I  must send the ball over the net with this next stroke.    I restrained myself this time, eschewing the careless vigor which had  marked my previous efforts. The ball flew in a slow semicircle, and  pitched inside the correct court. At least, I told myself, I had not  served a fault.    What happened then I cannot exactly say. I saw my opponent spring  forward like a panther and whirl his racket. The next moment the back  net was shaking violently and the ball was rolling swiftly along the  ground on a return journey to the other court.    \"Love--forty,\" said Mr. Chase. \"Phyllis!\"    \"Yes?\"    \"That was the Doherty Slosh.\"    \"I thought it must be,\" said Phyllis.    The game ended with another brace of faults.    In the third game I managed to score fifteen. By the merest chance I  returned one of his red-hot serves, and--probably through  surprise--he failed to send it back again.    In the fourth and fifth games I omitted to score.    We began the sixth game. And now for some reason I played really well.  I struck a little vein of brilliance. I was serving, and this time a  proportion of my serves went over the net instead of trying to get  through. The score went from fifteen all to forty-fifteen. Hope began  to surge through my veins. If I could keep this up, I might win yet.    The Doherty Slosh diminished my lead by fifteen. The Renshaw Slam  brought the score to Deuce. Then I got in a really fine serve, which  beat him. 'Vantage in. Another Slosh. Deuce. Another Slam. 'Vantage  out. It was an awesome moment. There is a tide in the affairs of men  which taken at the flood--I served. Fault. I served again--a beauty.

The man, looking  toward the door, said again: \"Take notice, once for all, that I won't  come, and go away from there.\"    Afterward he cried:    \"Go away, do you hear, if you want to get off with a whole skin, for I  tell you a thousand times I won't come.\"    Then, as if some one was standing at the door constantly calling him,  he grew angry and raved at the person for not leaving him in peace. At  last he sprang up and snatched the razor from the barber's hand,  crying:    \"Give it to me, that I may show him what it is to continually annoy  people.\"    And he ran at full speed after the person who, he said, was calling  him, but whom nobody else could see. The poor barber, who did not want  to lose his razor, followed. The man ran, the barber pursued, till  they passed beyond the city limits, and, just outside of the town, the  man fell into a chasm from which he did not come out again, so he  also, like all the rest, followed the voice that called him.    The barber, who returned home panting for breath, told everybody he  met what had happened and so the belief spread through the country  that the people, who had gone away and not returned, had fallen into  that gulf, for until then no one had known what became of those who  followed the person that summoned them.    When a throng set out to visit the scene of misfortune, to see the  insatiable gulf which swallowed up all the people and yet never had  enough, nothing was found; it looked as if, since the beginning of  the world, nothing had been there except a broad plain, and from that  time the population of the neighborhood began to die like the human  beings in the rest of the earth.          The Old Woman and the Old Man.      Once upon a time there was an old man and an old woman, who had not a  single child in their old age, and it was very hard for them, because  they had no help, not even to light the fire; when they came home from  working in the fields, they were obliged to begin with lighting the  fire and then prepare their food.    One day, when they were fretting and consulting each other, they  determined to look for children whatever might happen.    The old man went one way, the old woman another, to find a child  somewhere.    The old man met a dog, the old woman a mouse. When they met again the  old woman asked:    \"Husband, what have you found?\"    \"A little dog. And you, wife?\"    \"A little mouse.\"    They now agreed to adopt the mouse for a child and drive the dog away,  so the couple returned with the mouse, greatly delighted because they  had found what they sought, that is, a child.    On reaching home the old woman began to make a fire; then she set the  pot of sour buttermilk on to boil, and left the mouse to watch that it  did not fall over, while she went to work with the old man in the  fields.    After she had gone, the porridge boiled and splashed over the top of  the pot; the mouse, which was sitting on the hearth, said:    \"Porridge, don't jump on me or I'll jump on you.\" But the buttermilk  did not stop and still splashed over the brim. When the mouse saw  this, it grew angry and leaped straight into the pot.    When the old people returned from hoeing and called their child, there  was no child to be found. After searching for it a long time without  success, they sat sadly down to eat their dinner. Yet they ate the  porridge with great relish until, when the old woman emptied the dish  she found at the bottom--what? The little mouse, their child, dead!  She began:    \"Husband, husband, here it is, our child is drowned in the  buttermilk.\"    \"How is that possible, wife!\" replied the bearded old fellow.    When they saw this terrible accident, they began to weep and lament  bitterly; the old man in his grief tore his beard, and the old woman  pulled the hair out of her head.    The old man left the house with tearful eyes and touzled beard; on the  bough of a tree, in front of the hut, perched a magpie, which seeing  him asked:    \"Why have you pulled out your beard, old man?\"    \"Oh, my dear bird, how can I help tearing my beard, when my little  child has drowned itself in the pot of porridge and is dead?\"    When the magpie heard this, it tore out all its feathers, leaving  nothing but the tail.    The old woman set off with her bald head to the well, to get a jug of  water to wash the dead body of her child.    By the well stood a girl with a pitcher, who had come to draw water;  when she saw the old woman she asked:    \"My, old woman, why have you torn the hair out of your head till you  are perfectly bald?\"    \"Alas, my darling, how can I help tearing my hair and making myself  bald, when my little mouse is dead?\"    The girl, in her grief, smashed her pitcher in two, then she hurried  to the empress to tell her the story; the royal lady, as soon as she  heard it, fell down from the balcony, broke her ankle, and died, while  the emperor, out of love for his wife, went away and became a monk in  the monastery of Lies, beyond the Country of Truth; while I        Acquaintance made with grandsires old,      To whom this simple tale I told,      It seemed to them such perfect chaff      That its bare memory raised a laugh.          The Pea Emperor.      Once upon a time something wonderful happened. If it hadn't happened,  it wouldn't be told.    There was once a good for nothing fellow, who was so poor and needy  that he had not even enough to eat to be able to drink water after it.  When he had wandered through all the countries in the world, he  returned home somewhat more sensible. He had passed through many  perils abroad, knocked his head against the top of the door, been  sifted through the coarse and the fine sieve. He would now gladly have  pursued some trade, but he had no money. One day he found three peas.  After picking them up from the ground he took them on the palm of his  hand, looked at them, pondered a long time, and then said laughing:  \"If I plant these seeds in the ground, I shall have a hundred in a  year; if I afterward plant the hundred, I shall have thousands, and if  I put these thousands in the earth I shall reap who knows how many!  Then, if I go on in this way, I shall finally become a rich man. But  if I could help wealth to come quicker--let me see!\"    He went to the emperor and begged him to order through the whole  empire barrels in which to keep his peas.    When the emperor heard that he needed such a quantity of barrels, he  thought he must be stifling in money, and was more and more convinced  of it when he entered into conversation with him. What is true must  remain true; he didn't keep his mouth shut, but opened it and bragged  till it would have been supposed that real pearls fell from his lips.    He told the emperor what he had seen in foreign lands, related how  things were here and there, spoke of this and that, till the emperor  stood before him with his mouth wide open. When he saw that the  emperor marveled at his statements, he bragged more and more, saying  that he had palaces, herds, and other riches.    The sovereign believed the boaster's stories, and said to him:    \"I see that you have traveled, know a great deal, and are cunning and  experienced; if you wish, I will gladly give you my daughter in  marriage.\"    The braggart now regretted having told so many lies, for he did not  know how to escape the monarch's proposal. After reflecting a short  time, he plucked up courage and said \"I will gladly accept the  position of son-in-law you offer, and will try to show you that I am  worthy of it.\"    The necessary preparations were made, and after some time an imperial  wedding was celebrated in the palace. Then the man remained there.    One, two, several weeks elapsed, and no trace of peas and wealth  appeared. Finally the emperor began to repent what he had done, but  there was no help for it and the emperor's son-in-law perceived, from  the manner of the courtiers and nobles, that they had very little  respect for him.    His cheeks burned with shame. He made useless plans, tortured himself  to find some means of getting out of the scrape, and could not even  sleep at night. One morning without any one's knowledge he left the  palace at dawn, walked on till he came to a meadow, and wandered along  absorbed in thought, without knowing where he was going. Suddenly a  rosy-cheeked man stood before him, and asked: \"Where are you going,  gossip, you look as sad and thoughtful as if all your ships had sunk  in the sea.\"    The emperor's son-in-law related his dilemma and what he was seeking,  and the man replied:    \"If I deliver you from your difficulty, what will you give me?\"    \"Whatever you ask,\" he answered.    \"There are nine of us brothers,\" said the man, \"and each knows a  riddle. If you guess them our whole property shall be yours, but if  not, your first child must be ours.\"    The emperor's son-in-law, utterly crushed with shame, agreed, hard as  it was for him, hoping that before the child was born he might find  somebody who could tell him what to do.    So they set out together, that the stranger might show him the herds  of cattle he owned and his palaces, which were not far off. They also  instructed the herdsmen, swineherds, shepherds, and laborers what  they were to say, if any body asked to whom the flocks and herds  belonged.    The emperor's son-in-law returned to the palace and said that he would  take his wife home the next day. On his way back he met an old man in  the fields, and, seeing how aged and feeble he was, he pitied him and  offered him alms. The old man would accept nothing, but asked  permission to enter his service, telling him that he would be none the  worse for it, and the other received him. When the emperor heard that  his son-in-law wanted to go to his own palace, he was so"]]]
