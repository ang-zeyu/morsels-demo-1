This may be accomplished by neatly  sawing to the line and paring the end of the wood with a sharp chisel,  or by bringing the wood to a finish with a finely-set plane, such as an  iron-faced smoothing plane. The ends of the wood must be perfectly square  when tested from either the face side or from the marked edge.    [Illustration: Fig. 300.--Corner Dovetail.]    [Illustration: Fig. 301.--Squaring.]    Take a cutting gauge and set it to equal the thickness of the timber,  and, holding it as already shown at Fig. 273, strike the gauge lines on  the wood as illustrated at Fig. 302, G. Proceed to mark out the dovetail  pins, as at Fig. 303; in this illustration G again shows the gauge line.  The inclination of the lines across the end of the wood should not be too  great, or the joint will be a weak one, and the edges of the dovetails  will be liable to crumble away when the work is knocked together.    DOVETAILING TEMPLATE.--Many workers who are constantly engaged upon  dovetail joints make a small wooden template, as shown at Fig. 304. This  template is generally of hardwood, such as beech or walnut. The method of  obtaining the correct angles of such a template has already been given on  p. 134. Notice that the lines _bb_ (Fig. 303) of the dovetail pins do  _not_ bevel; they are parallel to the sides of the wood and at right  angles to the end of the wood as shown.    [Illustration: Fig. 302.--Gauging.]    [Illustration: Fig. 303.--Marking the Pins.]    CHISEL WORK.--After marking out, as shown at Fig. 303, place the wood on  the bench and proceed to chop away the centre portion in the following  manner. Hold the chisel on the bevel and cut out a small piece to form a  channel at the gauge line. Now hold the chisel in a vertical position,  and with a mallet strike it so as to make a cut about 1/8 in. deep. Then  hold the chisel on the bevel again and cut away more waste wood; proceed  alternately, first forcing the chisel down vertically, and then paring  the wood away with the chisel held obliquely, until you have cut  half-way through the thickness of the wood.    [Illustration: Fig. 304.--Hand-made Template for Marking Dovetails.]    [Illustration: Fig. 305.--Testing.]    [Illustration: Fig. 306.--The Marked Piece.]    Turn the wood over and repeat the various operations until the core, or  waste piece, is removed. Pare away any little irregularities which may be  left in the corners with an 1/8-in. chisel, thus leaving all smooth and  neat. Lay the piece of wood which is to have the dovetail marked on it  flat upon the bench, and take the piece with the dovetail pins cut upon  it and place in the position shown at Fig. 305.    SAW WORK.--Take a marking awl, or a knitting needle which has had its end  sharpened, and mark the lines of the dovetail in a similar manner to that  shown at Fig. 307. Remove the piece A, Fig. 305, and the lower piece  shown at Fig. 305 will clearly show the marks _aa_ as they appear in Fig.  306. Place the piece (Fig. 306) in the vice, and saw _outside_ the lines  AA, as shown in Fig. 308.    [Illustration: Fig. 307.--Marking Dovetails with Marking Awl.]    After sawing down the lines AA, Fig. 308, place the wood in the vice and,  guiding the saw blade with the index finger of the left hand, cut away  the small piece at the side (see Fig. 275). Repeat the operation as may  be necessary, and the completed joint will be similar to that shown at  Fig. 300. If the sawing is not neatly done it may be found necessary to  pare the shoulder with a sharp chisel.    DRAWERS.--When dovetailing drawers or boxes it is necessary to square up  the ends of all the stock and gauge them, as shown at Fig. 273. This  illustration shows how to gauge the lines on a drawer side; the  dovetailed joint in this case, however, does not run through the drawer  front and leave the work unsightly, as the joint at Fig. 300 would do.  The method used is shown at Fig. 309, and it is commonly known as  lap-dovetailing. Most workers cut the dovetail pins on the drawer fronts  and the drawer backs first, after which they mark the drawer sides with  the marking awl. The dovetailing of the drawer back is shown at Fig. 310.  This is the type known as \"through dovetailing,\" the method being similar  in regard to tool operations as the single joint shown at Fig. 300.    [Illustration: Fig. 308.--Sawing the Dovetails.]    [Illustration: Fig. 309.--Lap-dovetailing Drawer Front to Drawer Side.]    [Illustration: Fig. 310.--Through Dovetailing.]    [Illustration: Fig. 311.--Chipping Waste of Lap Dovetail.]    When the pins on the drawer front have been sawn, the waste material is  cut away, as at Fig. 311. First stab down with the vertical chisel,  which must make the cut about 1/32 in. in front of the gauge line (see  illustration). This commencing of the cut slightly in front of the gauge  line is a very important feature. The chisel may be likened to a wedge,  and if the chisel edge be placed exactly upon the gauge line and force  be applied to the handle, it will force the timber away equally on each  side of the gauge line, and the finished depth of the hole will therefore  be too deep for the thickness of the drawer side; in other words, it will  press itself over the gauge line on both sides.    By taking the first vertical cut on the waste side of the gauge line, and  then removing a small piece with the chisel held obliquely, as at Fig.  311, the wood is removed and less resistance is offered to the chisel  when the next vertical cut is made. This overshooting the gauge line is a  common fault with the beginner, who is puzzled at the result because he  is certain he had his chisel exactly on the gauge line when he commenced  his vertical cut. It is especially noticeable in soft-grained woods.    To cut away the waste of a lap-dovetail (Fig. 311), the vertical and  oblique cuts are repeated until the final trimming up is required, and  now is the time to finish both the vertical and the horizontal cuts  exactly on the gauge lines.    Some workers prefer to cut the drawer sides first, and if this method is  preferred (and it has its advantages for cheap work) several drawer sides  are cut at once by placing four or six behind one another in the vice and  sawing them all at one operation.    The drawer front is placed in the vice, and the drawer side held upon it,  whilst the saw blade is placed in the saw kerf and drawn smartly forward.  This will give the required marks at the exact position desired. It must  be remembered, however, to saw just inside these dovetail-pin lines,  otherwise the finished joint will be too slack, owing to the removal of  the sawdust, which is practically equal to the thickness of the saw  blade.    MACHINE-MADE DOVETAILS.--As a general rule machine-made drawer and box  dovetails show both the pins and the tails of exactly the same size. The  reason is obvious after an inspection of Fig. 314, which shows the  position in which the pieces are held during the machining operations. In  spite of a certain amount of prejudice they are satisfactory and  thoroughly reliable and have their place in modern shop and office  fittings.    [Illustration: Fig. 312.--Machine-made Drawer Front and Side, Apart.]    [Illustration: Fig. 313.--The Parts Together.]    [Illustration: Fig. 314.--Position when Machined.]          DOVETAIL GROOVING      The dovetail housing joint should first be carefully marked out with a  marking knife, so as to cut across the fibres of the wood. For obtaining  the bevel on the edge of the wood a joiner's bevel may be used, and the  angle should not be too acute. (See previous chapter.) Take a chisel and  pare away a small channel as at A, Fig. 315, to form a small shoulder to  guide the saw.    [Illustration: Fig. 315.--Paring away Channel for Dovetail Grooving.]    With a fine tenon or dovetail saw, cut the saw kerf as at Fig. 316. If  any difficulty is experienced in cutting the kerf true and square, you  may resort to the method shown at C, Fig. 315; a small temporary piece of  timber has been screwed on the top of the work to form a guide for the  saw.    [Illustration: Fig. 316.--Cutting the Saw Kerf.]    [Illustration: Fig. 317.--Old Woman's Tooth Plane.]    [Illustration: Fig. 318.--Guide Block for Bevelling.]    Fig. 315, B, shows the small channel formed by the chisel prior to the  sawing operation. The sawing of the bevelled side is worked in a similar  manner; but occasionally we find amateurs who adopt the method shown at  Fig. 318. A block of wood (H) is first made by boring a 1-1/4-in. hole  through its entire length, and afterwards making a saw cut at the desired  bevel. The object of this block, which is kept specially for the purpose,  is to form a guide for those who have not full control of the dovetail  saw; the back of the saw clears the hole, and the required bevel is  obtained. When a saw cut has been made at each side of the groove, the  surplus timber is pared away in the following manner: Cut away portion E,  Fig. 319; then cut away portion F, and lastly cut away the apex portion  marked G. Continue by this method of paring until the approximate depth  is reached. To ensure a correct depth throughout the entire groove, the  router plane (or, as it is often called, \"the old woman's tooth plane,\"  Fig. 317) is used.    [Illustration: Fig. 319.--Showing Method of Paring.]    [Illustration: Fig. 320.--Channelling the Alternate Piece.]    With regard to cutting the alternate piece, it is necessary to first  plane the end of the shelf true and square. With a cutting gauge strike  the line K, Fig. 320; the required bevel on the edge (J) is then set out,  and with the chisel a small channel is again formed. With the tenon or  dovetail saw cut down the line K to the required depth, and carefully  pare away the wood with a sharp chisel to the correct shape.          THE MITRED JOINT      Although mitreing is used in everyday woodwork, it comes last in our "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/21534"],[0,"Textiles and Clothing (#16)"],[1," almost perfect  corner.    Lace may be matched and mitered in a similar way.      MATCHING AND JOINING LACE    In joining lace, avoid a seam if possible. Select portions of the design  that will match, placing one pattern of the same design over the other.  Cut away a portion of the thick part of the pattern underneath and hem  the edges and inner part of the design down with fine thread.    Smyrna or Torchon lace is more difficult to hem or join when very open  or very fine. A small, felled seam is better than lapping and trying to  match the pattern.    Embroidery can be matched in the same way. Never let two heavy designs  lap over each other. The one on the wrong side should be cut out and  the edge sewed securely to the upper part of the design.      [Illustration: INSERTION WITH MITRED CORNER, TAPED AND FACED; EMBROIDERY  ROLLED WHIPPED AND GATHERED]      The plain material above the embroidery can be joined by a lapped seam,  turning first the right side and then the wrong side and hemming on both  sides of the seam.      MACHINE SEWING    The sewing machine has taken away much of the drudgery of home sewing,  but its use does not lessen the need of skill in hand work. No machine  can finish ends of belts, collars, sew on trimmings, fastenings, and  like work and the finish has much to do with the general appearance of a  garment.    [Sidenote: Types of Machines]    All the prominent makes of sewing machines were invented in the decade  following Howe's patent in 1846. The two chief types of machines are the  lock stitch, using double thread, and the chain or loop stitch, using a  single thread. Whatever the make of machine it should be run in  accordance with the rules accompanying it. The worker should familiarize  herself with the directions for setting and threading the needle,  winding the bobbin, regulating the tension and the stitch and all other  technicalities of the particular machine she has to operate. Agencies of  the various machines usually have skilled workers to give instruction to  beginners. While it is not always an economy of time to use the  attachments for hemming, tucking, etc., unless much work is to be done,  it is worth while to know how to use them if desired. As much or more  skill is required for neat machine work as for hand sewing. Results will  not be satisfactory without careful basting.    [Sidenote: Care of the Machine]    The machine should be kept well oiled, free from dust and gum and it  should he run evenly. In case it becomes \"gummed\" a drop of kerosene on  the parts that have been oiled will cut the gum. Remove the shuttle and  run the machine rapidly for a moment, then wipe off all the kerosene and  oil the machine carefully with good machine oil--only the best should be  used. A machine should always be wiped thoroughly before any work is  placed upon it.    [Sidenote: Needles and Thread]    As in hand sewing, needles and thread should be selected with care. A  blunt or bent needle should never be used, it should have a fine sharp  point and the eye should be sufficiently large to carry the thread  easily. The needle and thread should be suitable for the material to be  sewed. Glazed thread should never be used in a machine. The best quality  of thread and silk should be purchased but only enough for immediate  use, as it loses strength with age, chiefly because of the action of the  dyes and chemicals. Even white thread may become \"tender\" from the  chemicals used in bleaching it. Sewing silk and cotton should be kept in  a closed box to exclude the light and air.    For sewing cotton or linen the best cotton thread should be used.  Woolen, silk, and velvet should be stitched with the best machine silk.  The thread should match the material in color. Cotton thread fades or  loses its brightness when exposed to the light, therefore for stitching  that will show it is always better to use silk. The thread on the bobbin  should be wound evenly and carefully to insure an even stitch and the  tension of both threads should be equal, otherwise the stitch will not  be perfect. As a lock stitch machine requires two threads while in hand  sewing only one is used, the two need not be as coarse as the single  thread. For ordinary home sewing, underwear, thin gowns and the like,  No. 70 to No. 100 will be found satisfactory. Finer thread may be used  when the materials demand it, but no coarser than No. 50 should be used  in the machine and this only with the coarsest material.    [Sidenote: Fastening Threads]    Much time may be saved in fastening the threads at the ends of tucks,  hems on sheets, towels, etc., by careful manipulation of the machine.  For example, on sheets begin to stitch along the hem at the selvage, or  if the end of the hem is over-sewed, begin an inch from the edge and  stitch the hem towards the selvage, then lift the presser-foot so as to  turn the work, and retrace the bit of stitching, continuing across the  whole hem. When the end is reached, release the presser-foot, turn the  work, and stitch back for an inch or more in the same line, as was done  at the beginning of the hem. By this method the threads are fastened  much more easily and quickly than by drawing them through on to the  wrong side and tying or sewing them by hand and, of course, it is more  satisfactory than the \"shop\" way of cutting them off short. Tucks or  seams may be fastened in the same way. If fine thread is used the double  stitching at the ends is hardly noticeable.    [Sidenote: Bias Side Next Feed]    When stitching a seam having one bias and one straight side, let the  bias side come next to the feed, that is, on the underside. This is  especially important in thin materials. If the material is very sheer,  strips of soft paper--newspaper will answer for ordinary  purposes--should be sewed in the seam. This will insure a seam free from  puckers and when finished the paper can be pulled away easily.    [Sidenote: Stitching Gathers]    In sewing gathers on a band they should also come next the \"feed,\" as it  takes up the side next to it a little faster than the upper side. When  the bias, or cross-way side of the seam, or gathers are next to the  \"feed\" the material runs along smoothly, but if the straight side is  towards it there is apt to be a pucker.    Stitching can be done more easily on the right of the presser foot with  the bulk of the material lying to the left. The tendency of the \"feed\"  or teeth is to crowd the work off the edge as well as forward and the  stitching may be guided better on the right side.    All straight seams should be stretched to the full extent of their  straight edge in stitching, as the work passes under the presser foot.    When a large amount of machine sewing is to be done--such as household  linen, sheets, pillow cases and underwear--it is a good plan to do all  the basting and hand work first and keep the machine stitching for a  rainy or a damp day, as the thread is then less apt to break. A current  of air or a breeze from an open window on a dry day will often cause the  thread to snap. For the same reason the machine should never stand near  the fire or radiator.          TEXTILES AND CLOTHING    PART II           READ CAREFULLY. This test consists of two parts,--answers to the       questions and the making of models. Both should be sent to the       School for inspection and correction. All models should be made       about 4 by 6 inches so that they may be put into the envelope       provided without being folded. Two series of models are given;       either or both may be made.    1. What instruction have you ever had in sewing?    (b) Has the subject any educational value?    2. What are the common basting stitches, and for what are they used?    3. Can you make the running stitch properly? How is it done?    4. For what purpose may the cat stitch be used?    5. Hems and Seams: Describe the different kinds for thick and thin  materials, including those for flannel and state when they should be  used.    6. Describe three kinds of plackets.    7.

Make your initial in one corner, using any stitch preferred.         Overcast one long edge of the model, double overcast the opposite       side, finish one end with plain loop or blanket stitch, and the       other end with some fancy loop stitch. Fasten all threads as       described in the text.         II. SEAMS AND HEMS. (a) Join two pieces of fine cotton       with a French seam at the long edge, about 2 by 51/2 inches, with       warp running lengthwise. (b) Cut a piece of muslin on a true bias       and attach the bias edge to _a_ with a felled seam.
