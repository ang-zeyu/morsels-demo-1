[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/19209"],[0,"The Andes and the Amazon; Or, Across the Continent of South America (#16)"],[1," the  deep valleys of the Cordilleras, where the tall and slender palms pierce  the leafy veil around them, and wave on high their feathery and  arrow-like branches.\"    Father Velasco praises Ecuador as \"the noblest portion of the New  World.\" Nature has doubtless gifted it with capabilities unsurpassed by  those of any other country. Situated on the equinoctial line, and  embracing within its limits some of the highest as well as lowest dry  land on the globe, it presents every grade of climate, from the  perpetual summer on the coast and in the Orient to the everlasting  winter of the Andean summits, while the high plateau between the  Cordilleras enjoys an eternal spring. The vegetable productions are  consequently most varied and prolific. Tropical, temperate, and arctic  fruits and flowers are here found in profusion, or could be successfully  cultivated. As the Ecuadorian sees all the constellations of the  firmament, so Nature surrounds him with representatives of every family  of plants. There are places where the eye may embrace an entire zone,  for it may look up to a barley-field and potato-patch, and down to the  sugar-cane and pine-apple.    Confining our attention to the Quito Valley, we remark that the whole  region from Pichincha to Chimborazo is as treeless as Palestine. The  densest forest is near Banos. The most common tree is the \"Aliso\"  (_Betula acuminata_). Walnut is the best timber. There are no pines or  oaks.[37] The slopes of the mountains, between twelve and fifteen  thousand feet, are clothed with a shrub peculiar to the high altitudes  of the Andes, called _Chuquiragua_. This is a very valuable shrub; the  twigs are used for fuel, and the yellow buds as a febrifuge. The  castor-oil-tree grows naturally by the road side, sometimes to the  height of twelve feet.    [Footnote 37: On the Himalayas are oaks, birches, pines, chestnuts,  maples, junipers, and willows; no tree-ferns, bamboos, or palms.]    A very useful as well as the most ordinary plant in the valley is the  American aloe, or \"Century Plant.\"[38] It is the largest of all herbs.  Not naturally social, it imparts a melancholy character to the landscape  as it rises solitary out of the arid plain. Most of the roads are fenced  with aloe hedges. While the majority of tropical trees have naked stems  with a crown of leaves on the top, the aloe reverses this, and looks  like a great chandelier as its tall peduncle, bearing greenish-yellow  flowers, rises out of a graceful cluster of long, thick, fleshy leaves.  When cultivated, the aloe flowers in much less time than a century; but,  exhausted by the efflorescence, it soon dies. Nearly every part serves  some purpose; the broad leaves are used by the poorer class instead of  paper in writing, or for thatching their huts; sirup flows out of the  leaves when tapped, and, as they contain much alkali, a soap (which  lathers with salt water as well as fresh) is also manufactured from  them; the flowers make excellent pickles; the flower-stalk is used in  building; the pith of the stem is used by barbers for sharpening razors;  the fibres of the leaves and the roots are woven into sandals and sacks;  and the sharp spines are used as needles. A species of yucca, resembling  the aloe, but with more slender leaves and of a lighter green, yields  the hemp of Ecuador.    [Footnote 38: The _Agava Americana_ of botanists, _cabulla_ of  Ecuadorians, _maguey_ of Venezuelans, and _metl_ of Mexicans. It is an  interesting fact, brought to light by the researches of Carl Neuman,  that the Chinese in the fifth century passed over to America by way of  the Aleutian Islands, and penetrated as far south as Mexico, which they  called the land of _fusung_, that being the celestial name of the aloe.  Terzozomoc, the high-priest of the ancient Mexicans, gave aloe leaves,  inscribed with sacred characters, to persons who had to journey among  the volcanoes, to protect them from injury.]    The \"crack fruit\" of Quito, and, in fact, of South America, is the  chirimoya.[39] Its taste is a happy mixture of sweetness and acidity.  Hanke calls it \"a masterwork of Nature,\" and Markham pronounces it \"a  spiritualized strawberry.\" It grows on a tree about fifteen feet high,  having a broad, flat top, and very fragrant flowers. The ripe fruit,  often attaining in Peru the weight of sixteen pounds, has a thick green  skin, and a snow-white pulp containing about seventy black seeds. Other  pomological productions are alligator pears, guavas, guayavas,  granadillas, cherries (a small black variety), peaches (very poor),  pears (equally bad), plums, quinces, lemons, oranges (not native),  blackberries, and strawberries (large, but flavorless).[40] The  cultivation of the grape has just commenced. Of vegetables there are  onions (in cookery, \"the first, and last, and midst, and without end\"),  beets, carrots, asparagus, lettuce, cabbages, turnips, tomatoes  (indigenous, but inferior to ours), potatoes (also indigenous, but much  smaller than their descendants),[41] red peppers, peas (always picked  ripe, while green ones are imported from France!), beans, melons,  squashes, and mushrooms. The last are eaten to a limited extent; Terra  del Fuego, says Darwin, is the only country in the world where a  cryptogamic plant affords a staple article of food.    [Footnote 39: Bollaert derives the name from _chiri_ (cold) and _muhu_  (seed).]    [Footnote 40: Dr. Jameson has found the following species of _Rubus_ in  the valley of Quito: _macrocarpus_, _stipularis_, _glabratus_,  _compactus_, _glaucus_, _rosaeflorus_, _loxensis_, _urticaefolius_,  _floribundus_, and _nubigenus_. The common strawberry, _Fragaria  vesca_, grows in the valley, as also the _Chilensis_.]    [Footnote 41: Lieutenant Gilliss praises the potatoes of Peru, but we  saw no specimens in Ecuador worthy of note. The \"Irish potato\" is a  native of the Andes. It was unknown to the early Mexicans. It grows as  far south on this continent as lat. 50 deg.. The Spaniards carried the  potato to Europe from Quito early in the sixteenth century. From Spain  it traveled to Italy, Belgium, and Germany. Sir Walter Raleigh imported  some from Virginia in 1586, and planted them on his estate near Cork,  Ireland. It is raised in Asiatic countries only where Europeans have  settled, and for their consumption. It is successfully grown in  Australia and New Zealand, where there is no native esculent farinaceous  root. Von Tschudi says there is no word in Quichua for potato. It is  called _papa_ by the Napos.]    The most important grains are barley, red wheat, and corn, with short  ears, and elongated kernels of divers colors. Near the coast three crops  of corn a year are obtained; at Quito it is of slower growth, but  fuller. The sugar-cane is grown sparingly in the valley, but chiefly on  the Pacific coast. Its home is Polynesia. Quito consumes about one  hundred and fifty barrels of flour daily. The best sells for four  dollars a quintal. The common fodder for cattle is alfalfa, an imported  lucerne. There is no clover except a wild, worthless, three-leaved  species (_Trifolium amabile_). Nearly all in the above list are  cultivated for home consumption only, and many valuable fruits and  vegetables which would grow well are unknown to Quitonians. As Bates  says of the Brazilians, the incorrigible nonchalance and laziness of the  people alone prevent them from surrounding themselves with all the  luxuries of a temperate as well as tropical country.    It would be an endless task to speak of the flowers. It must suffice to  state that a _Synopsis Plantarum AEquatoriensium_, the life-work of the  venerable Professor Jameson, of the University of Quito, has just been  published by the tardy government. Botanists will find in these two  small volumes many new species unknown to American science, and others  more correctly described by one who has dwelt forty years among the  Andes. The last zone of vegetation nearest the snow-line consists  chiefly of yellow-flowering _Compositae_. In fact, this family includes  one fourth of the plants in the immediate vicinity of Quito. The next  most numerous family is the _Labiatae_, and then follow _Leguminosae_ and  _Gentians_. Although the _Rosaceae_ is represented, there is not one  species of the genus _Rosa_ not even in the whole southern hemisphere.  The magnificent _Befaria_, found in the lower part of the valley, is  called \"the Rose of the Andes.\" Fuchsias may be considered  characteristic of South America, since they are so numerous; only one or  two kinds occur in any other part of the world. Flowers are found in  Quito all the year round, but the most favorable months are December and  May. Yellow is the predominating color. The higher the altitude, the  brighter the hues of any given species. Thus the _Gentiana sedifolia_ is  a small, light blue flower in the lowlands, but on the Assuay it has  bright blue petals three times as large and sensitive. This accords with  Herschel's statement: \"The chemical rays of the spectrum are powerfully  absorbed in passing through the atmosphere, and the effect of their  greater abundance aloft is shown in the superior brilliancy of color in  the flowers of Alpine regions.\"    America is plainly the continent of vegetation; and wherever the  vegetable element predominates, the animal is subordinated. We must not  look, therefore, for a large amount or variety of animal life in the  Ecuadorian forests. Time was when colossal megatheroids, mastodons, and  glyptodons browsed on the foliage of the Andes and the Amazon; but now  the terrestrial mammals of this tropical region are few and diminutive.  They are likewise old-fashioned, inferior in type as well as bulk to  those of the eastern hemisphere, for America was a finished continent  long before Europe. \"It seems most probable (says Darwin) that the North  American elephants, mastodons, horse, and hollow-horned ruminants  migrated, on"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/19211"],[0,"The History of England in Three Volumes, Vol. I., Part A.

[* Append, to Bede, numb. 10, ex edit. 1722.       Spehn. Concil p.108, 109.]         [** Bede. lib. v. cap. 7.]         [*** See Appendix to Bede, numb. 19. Higden, lib.       v.]         [**** Eddius, vita Vilfr. sect. 24, 60]    The great topic by which Wilfrid confounded the imaginations of men,  was, that St. Peter, to whos custody the keys of heaven were intrusted,  would certainly refuse admittance to every one who should be wanting  in respect to his successor, This conceit, well suited to vulgar  conceptions, made great impression on the people during several  ages, and has act even at present lost all influence in the Catholic  countries. Had this abject superstition produced general peace and  tranquillity, it had made some atonement for the ills attending it;  but besides the usual avidity of men for power and riches, frivolous  controversies in theology were engendered by it, which were so much  the more fatal, as they admitted not, like the others, of any final  determination from established possession. The disputes, excited in  Britain, were of the most ridiculous kind, and entirely worthy of those  ignorant and barbarous ages. There were some intricacies, observed by  all the Christian churches, in adjusting the day of keeping Easter;  which depended on a complicated consideration of the course of the sun  and moon; and it happened that the missionaries, who had converted the  Scots and Britons, had followed a different calendar from that which was  observed at Rome, in the age when Augustine converted the Saxons. The  priests also of all the Christian churches were accustomed to shave part  of their head; but the form given to this tonsure was different in the  former from what was practised in the latter. The Scots and Britons  pleaded the antiquity of _their_ usages; the Romans and their  disciples, the Saxons, insisted on the universality of _theirs_.  That Easter must necessarily be kept by a rule, which comprehended both  the day of the year and age of the moon, was agreed by all; that the  tonsure of a priest could not be omitted without the utmost impiety, was  a point undisputed; but the Romans and Saxons called their antagonists  schismatics, because they celebrated Easter on the very day of the full  moon in March, if that day fell on a Sunday, instead of waiting till the  Sunday following; and because they shaved the fore part of their head  from ear to ear, instead of making that tonsure on the crown of the  head, and in a circular form. In order to render their antagonists  odious, they affirmed that, once in seven years, they concurred with the  Jews in the time of celebrating that festival;[*] and that they might  recommend their own form of tonsure, they maintained, that it imitated  symbolically the crown of thorns worn by Christ in his passion; whereas  the other form was invented by Simon Magus, without any regard to that  representation.[**]         [* Bede, lib. ii. cap. 19.]         [** Bede, lib. v. cap. 21. Eddius, sect. 24]    These controversies had, from the beginning, excited such animosity  between the British and Romish priests that, instead of concurring  in their endeavors to convert the idolatrous Saxons, they refused all  communion together, and each regarded his opponent as no better than  a pagan.[*] The dispute lasted more than a century; and was at last  finished, not by men's discovering the folly of it, which would have  been too great an effort for human reason to accomplish, but by the  entire prevalence of the Romish ritual over the Scotch and British.[**]  Wilfrid, bishop of Lindisferne, acquired great merit, both with the  court of Rome and with all the southern Saxons, by expelling the  quartodeciman schism, as it was called, from the Northumbrian kingdom,  into which the neighborhood of the Scots had formerly introduced  it.[***]    Theodore, archbishop of Canterbury, called, in the year 680, a synod  at Hatfield, consisting of all the bishops in Britain,[****] where was  accepted and ratified the decree of the Lateran council, summoned by  Martin, against the heresy of the Monothelites. The council and synod  maintained, in opposition to these heretics, that, though the divine  and human nature in Christ made but one person, yet had they different  inclinations, wills, acts, and sentiments, and that the unity of the  person implied not any unity in the consciousness.[*****] This opinion  it seems somewhat difficult to comprehend; and no one, unacquainted with  the ecclesiastical history of those ages, could imagine the height of  zeal and violence with which it was then inculcated. The decree of  the Lateran council calls the Monothelites impious, execrable, wicked,  abominable, and even diabolical; and curses and anathematizes them to  all eternity.[******]         [* Bede, lib. ii. cap. 2, 4, 20. Eddius, sect.       12.]         [** Bede, lib. v. cap. 16, 22.]         [*** Bede, lib. iii. cap. 25. Eddius, sect. 12.]         [**** Spell. Concil. vol. i. p. 168.]         [***** Spell.

The Saxons, from the first introduction of Christianity among them, had  admitted the use of images; and perhaps that religion, without some of  those exterior ornaments, had not made so quick a progress with these  idolaters; but they had not paid any species of worship or address  to images; and this abuse never prevailed among Christians, till it  received the sanction of the second council of Nice.          EGBERT.    [Sidenote: 827.] The kingdoms of the Heptarchy, though united by a  recent conquest, seemed to be firmly cemented into one state under  Egbert; and the inhabitants of the several provinces had lost all desire  of revolting from that monarch, or of restoring their former independent  governments. Their language was every where nearly the same, their  customs, laws, institutions, civil and religious; and as the race of  the ancient kings was totally extinct in all the subjected states, the  people readily transferred their allegiance to a prince who seemed  to merit it by the splendor of his victories, the vigor of hia  administration, and the superior nobility of his birth. A union also in  government opened to them the agreeable prospect of future tranquillity;  and it appeared more probable that they would thenceforth become  formidable to their neighbors, than be exposed to their inroads and  devastations. But these flattering views were soon overcast by  the appearance of the Danes, who, during some centuries, kept the  Anglo-Saxons in perpetual inquietude, committed the most barbarous  ravages upon them, and at last reduced them to grievous servitude.    The emperor Charlemagne, though naturally generous and humane, had been  induced by bigotry to exercise great severities upon the pagan Saxons in  Germany, whom he subdued; and besides often ravaging their country with  fire and sword, he had, in cool blood, decimated all the inhabitants  for their revolts, and had obliged them, by the most rigorous edicts,  to make a seeming compliance with the Christian doctrine. That religion,  which had easily made its way among the British Saxons by insinuation  and address, appeared shocking to their German brethren, when imposed on  them by the violence of Charlemagne; and the more generous and warlike  of these pagans had fled northward into Jutland, in order to escape  the fury of his persecutions. Meeting there with a people of similar  manners, they were readily received among them; and they soon stimulated  the natives to concur in enterprises which both promised revenge on  the haughty conqueror, and afforded subsistence to those numerous  inhabitants with which the northern countries were now overburdened.[*]  They invaded the provinces of France, which were exposed by the  degeneracy and dissensions of Charlemagne's posterity; and being there  known under the general name of Normans, which they received from their  northern situation, they became the terror of all the maritime and even  of the inland countries. They were also tempted to visit England in  their frequent excursions; and being able, by sudden inroads, to make  great progress over a people who were not defended by any naval force,  who had relaxed their military institutions, and who were sunk into a  superstition which had become odious to the Danes and ancient Saxons,  they made no distinction in their hostilities between the French and  English kingdoms. Their first appearance in this island was in the year  787,[**] when Brithric reigned in Wessex. A small body of them landed in  that kingdom, with a view of learning the state of the country; and when  the magistrate of the place questioned them concerning their enterprise,  and summoned them to appear before the king, and account for their  intentions, they killed him, and, flying to, their ships, escaped into  their own country. The next alarm was given to Northumberland in the  year 794,[***] when a body of these pirates pillaged a monastery; but  their ships being much damaged by a storm, and their leader slain in  a skirmish, they were at last defeated by the inhabitants, and the  remainder of them put to the sword. [Sidenote: 832] Five years after  Egbert had established his monarchy over England, the Danes landed in  the Isle of Shepey, and having pillaged it, escaped with impunity."]]]
