The round-house in Cheyenne is filled every night    With loafers and bummers of most every plight;    On their backs is no clothes, in their pockets no bills,    Each day they keep starting for the dreary Black Hills.      I got to Cheyenne, no gold could I find,    I thought of the lunch route I'd left far behind;    Through rain, hail, and snow, frozen plumb to the gills,--    They call me the orphan of the dreary Black Hills.      Kind friend, to conclude, my advice I'll unfold,    Don't go to the Black Hills a-hunting for gold;    Railroad speculators their pockets you'll fill    By taking a trip to those dreary Black Hills.      Don't go away, stay at home if you can,    Stay away from that city, they call it Cheyenne,    For old Sitting Bull or Comanche Bills    They will take off your scalp on the dreary Black Hills.        The Dreary Black Hills (Mus. Not.)        Kind friends, you must pit-y my hor-ri-ble tale,    I'm an ob-ject of pit-y, I'm look-ing quite stale;    I gave up my trade, Selling Right's Pat-ent Pills,    To go hunt-ing gold In the drear-y Black Hills.      REFRAIN      Don't go a-way, stay at home if you can;    Stay a-way from that cit-y they call it Chey-enne;    For big Wal-i-pee or Co-man-che Bills,    They will lift up your hair On the drear-y Black Hills.          A MORMON SONG        I used to live on Cottonwood and owned a little farm,    I was called upon a mission that gave me much alarm;    The reason that they called me, I'm sure I do not know.    But to hoe the cane and cotton, straightway I must go.      I yoked up Jim and Baldy, all ready for the start;    To leave my farm and garden, it almost broke my heart;    But at last we got started, I cast a look behind,    For the sand and rocks of Dixie were running through my mind.      Now, when we got to Black Ridge, my wagon it broke down,    And I, being no carpenter and forty miles from town,--    I cut a clumsy cedar and rigged an awkward slide,    But the wagon ran so heavy poor Betsy couldn't ride.      While Betsy was out walking I told her to take care,    When all of a sudden she struck a prickly pear,    Then she began to hollow as loud as she could bawl,--    If I were back in Cottonwood, I wouldn't go at all.      Now, when we got to Sand Ridge, we couldn't go at all,    Old Jim and old Baldy began to puff and loll,    I cussed and swore a little, for I couldn't make the route,    For the team and I and Betsy were all of us played out.      At length we got to Washington; I thought we'd stay a while    To see if the flowers would make their virgin smile,    But I was much mistaken, for when we went away    The red hills of September were just the same in May.      It is so very dreary, there's nothing here to cheer,    But old pathetic sermons we very often hear;    They preach them by the dozens and prove them by the book,    But I'd sooner have a roasting-ear and stay at home and cook.      I am so awful weary I'm sure I'm almost dead;    'Tis six long weeks last Sunday since I have tasted bread;    Of turnip-tops and lucerne greens I've had enough to eat,    But I'd like to change my diet to buckwheat cakes and meat.      I had to sell my wagon for sorghum seed and bread;    Old Jim and old Baldy have long since been dead.    There's no one left but me and Bet to hoe the cotton tree,--    God pity any Mormon that attempts to follow me!          THE BUFFALO HUNTERS        Come all you pretty girls, to you these lines I'll write,    We are going to the range in which we take delight;    We are going on the range as we poor hunters do,    And the tender-footed fellows can stay at home with you.      It's all of the day long as we go tramping round    In search of the buffalo that we may shoot him down;    Our guns upon our shoulders, our belts of forty rounds,    We send them up Salt River to some happy hunting grounds.      Our game, it is the antelope, the buffalo, wolf, and deer,    Who roam the wide prairies without a single fear;    We rob him of his robe and think it is no harm,    To buy us food and clothing to keep our bodies warm.      The buffalo, he is the noblest of the band,    He sometimes rejects in throwing up his hand.    His shaggy main thrown forward, his head raised to the sky,    He seems to say, \"We're coming, boys; so hunter, mind your eye.\"      Our fires are made of mesquite roots, our beds are on the ground;    Our houses made of buffalo hides, we make them tall and round;    Our furniture is the camp kettle, the coffee pot, and pan,    Our chuck it is both bread and meat, mingled well with sand.      Our neighbors are the Cheyennes, the 'Rapahoes, and Sioux,    Their mode of navigation is a buffalo-hide canoe.    And when they come upon you they take you unaware,    And such a peculiar way they have of raising hunter's hair.          THE LITTLE OLD SOD SHANTY        I am looking rather seedy now while holding down my claim,    And my victuals are not always served the best;    And the mice play shyly round me as I nestle down to rest    In my little old sod shanty on my claim.        The hinges are of leather and the windows have no glass,      While the board roof lets the howling blizzards in,      And I hear the hungry cayote as he slinks up through the grass      Round the little old sod shanty on my claim.      Yet, I rather like the novelty of living in this way,    Though my bill of fare is always rather tame,    But I'm happy as a clam on the land of Uncle Sam    In the little old sod shanty on my claim.      But when I left my Eastern home, a bachelor so gay,    To try and win my way to wealth and fame,    I little thought I'd come down to burning twisted hay    In the little old sod shanty on my claim.      My clothes are plastered o'er with dough, I'm looking like a       fright,    And everything is scattered round the room,    But I wouldn't give the freedom that I have out in the West    For the table of the Eastern man's old home.      Still, I wish that some kind-hearted girl would pity on me take    And relieve me from the mess that I am in;    The angel, how I'd bless her if this her home she'd make    In the little old sod shanty on my claim.      And we would make our fortunes on the prairies of the West,    Just as happy as two lovers we'd remain;    We'd forget the trials and troubles we endured at the first    In the little old sod shanty on my claim.      And if fate should bless us with now and then an heir    To cheer our hearts with honest pride of fame,    Oh, then we'd be contented for the toil that we had spent    In the little old sod shanty on our claim.      When time enough had lapsed and all those little brats    To noble man and womanhood had grown,    It wouldn't seem half so lonely as round us we should look    And we'd see the old sod shanty on our claim.          THE GOL-DARNED WHEEL        I can take the wildest bronco in the tough old woolly West.    I can ride him, I can break him, let him do his level best;    I can handle any cattle ever wore a coat of hair,    And I've had a lively tussle with a tarnel grizzly bear.    I can rope and throw the longhorn of the wildest Texas brand,    And in Indian disagreements I can play a leading hand,    But at last I got my master and he surely made me squeal    When the boys got me a-straddle of that gol-darned wheel.      It was at the Eagle Ranch, on the Brazos,    When I first found that darned contrivance that upset me in the dust.    A tenderfoot had brought it, he was wheeling all the way    From the sun-rise end of freedom out to San Francisco Bay.    He tied up at the ranch for to get outside a meal,    Never thinking we would monkey with his gol-darned wheel.      Arizona Jim begun it when he said to Jack McGill    There was fellows forced to limit bragging on their riding skill,    And he'd venture the admission the same fellow that he meant    Was a very handy cutter far as riding bronchos went;    But he would find that he was bucking 'gainst a different kind of deal    If he threw his leather leggins 'gainst a gol-darned wheel.      Such a slam against my talent made me hotter than a mink,    And I swore that I would ride him for amusement or for chink.    And it was nothing but a plaything for the kids and such about,    And they'd have their ideas shattered if they'd lead the critter out.    They held it while I mounted and gave the word to go;    The shove they gave to start me warn't unreasonably slow.    But I never spilled a cuss word and I never spilled a squeal--    I was building reputation on that gol-darned wheel.      Holy Moses and the Prophets, how we split the Texas air,    And the wind it made whip-crackers of my same old canthy hair,    And I sorta comprehended as down the hill we went    There was bound to be a smash-up that I couldn't well prevent.    Oh, how them punchers bawled, \"Stay with her, Uncle Bill!    Stick your spurs in her, you sucker! turn her muzzle up the hill!\"    But I never made an answer, I just let the cusses squeal,    I was finding reputation on that gol-darned wheel.      The grade was mighty sloping from the ranch down to the creek    And I went a-galliflutin' like a crazy lightning streak,--    Went whizzing and a-darting first this way and then that,    The darned contrivance sort o' wobbling like the flying of a bat.    I pulled upon the handles, but I couldn't check it up,    And I yanked and sawed and hollowed but the darned thing wouldn't stop.    Then a sort of a meachin' in my brain began to steal,    That the devil held a mortgage on that gol-darned wheel.      I've a sort of dim and hazy remembrance of the stop,    With the world a-goin' round and the stars all tangled up;    Then there came an intermission that lasted till I found    I was lying at the ranch with the boys all gathered round,    And a doctor was a-sewing on the skin where it was ripped,"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/2131"],[0,"An Account of Egypt (#16)"],[1,"they do not know that Rhodopis flourished  in the reign of Amasis, and not in this king's reign; for Rhodopis  lived very many years later than the kings who left behind them these  pyramids. By descent she was of Thrace, and she was a slave of Iadmon  the son of Hephaistopolis a Samian, and a fellow-slave of Esop the  maker of fables; for he too was once the slave of Iadmon, as was  proved especially by this fact, namely that when the people of Delphi  repeatedly made proclamation in accordance with an oracle, to find some  one who would take up the blood-money for the death of Esop, no one else  appeared, but at length the grandson of Iadmon, called Iadmon also, took  it up; and thus it is showed that Esop too was the slave of Iadmon.  As for Rhodopis, she came to Egypt brought by Xanthes the Samian,  and having come thither to exercise her calling she was redeemed  from slavery for a great sum by a man of Mytilene, Charaxos son of  Scamandronymos and brother of Sappho the lyric poet. Thus was Rhodopis  set free, and she remained in Egypt and by her beauty won so much liking  that she made great gain of money for one like Rhodopis, though not  enough to suffice for the cost of such a pyramid as this. In truth there  is no need to ascribe to her very great riches, considering that the  tithe of her wealth may still be seen even to this time by any one  who desires it: for Rhodopis wished to leave behind her a memorial of  herself in Hellas, namely to cause a thing to be made such as happens  not to have been thought of or dedicated in a temple by any besides, and  to dedicate this at Delphi as a memorial of herself. Accordingly with  the tithe of her wealth she caused to be made spits of iron of size  large enough to pierce a whole ox, and many in number, going as far  therein as her tithe allowed her, and she sent them to Delphi: these  are even at the present time lying there, heaped all together behind the  altar which the Chians dedicated, and just opposite to the cell of the  temple. Now at Naucratis, as it happens, the courtesans are rather apt  to win credit; for this woman first, about whom the story to which I  refer is told, became so famous that all the Hellenes without exception  came to know the name of Rhodopis, and then after her one whose name was  Archidiche became a subject of song all over Hellas, though she was less  talked of than the other. As for Charaxos, when after redeeming Rhodopis  he returned back to Mytilene, Sappho in an ode violently abused him. Of  Rhodopis then I shall say no more.    After Mykerinos the priests said Asychis became king of Egypt, and he  made for Hephaistos the temple gateway which is towards the sunrising,  by far the most beautiful and the largest of the gateways; for while  they all have figures carved upon them and innumerable ornaments of  building besides, this has them very much more than the rest. In this  king's reign they told me that, as the circulation of money was very  slow, a law was made for the Egyptians that a man might have that money  lent to him which he needed, by offering as security the dead body of  his father; and there was added moreover to this law another, namely  that he who lent the money should have a claim also to the whole of the  sepulchral chamber belonging to him who received it, and that the man  who offered that security should be subject to this penalty, if he  refused to pay back the debt, namely that neither the man himself  should be allowed to have burial, when he died, either in that family  burial-place or in any other, nor should he be allowed to bury any of  his kinsmen whom he lost by death. This king desiring to surpass the  kings of Egypt who had arisen before him left as a memorial of himself a  pyramid which he made of bricks and on it there is an inscription  carved in stone and saying thus: \"Despise not me in comparison with the  pyramids of stone, seeing that I excel them as much as Zeus excels the  other gods; for with a pole they struck into the lake, and whatever  of the mud attached itself to the pole, this they gathered up and made  bricks, and in such manner they finished me.\"    Such were the deeds which this king performed: and after him reigned a  blind man of the city of Anysis, whose name was Anysis. In his reign  the Ethiopians and Sabacos the king of the Ethiopians marched upon Egypt  with a great host of men; so this blind man departed, flying to the  fen-country, and the Ethiopian was king over Egypt for fifty years,  during which he performed deeds as follows:--whenever any man of the  Egyptians committed any transgression, he would never put him to death,  but he gave sentence upon each man according to the greatness of the  wrong-doing, appointing them to work at throwing up an embankment before  that city from whence each man came of those who committed wrong. Thus  the cities were made higher still than before; for they were embanked  first by those who dug the channels in the reign of Sesostris, and then  secondly in the reign of the Ethiopian, and thus they were made very  high: and while other cities in Egypt also stood high, I think in the  town at Bubastis especially the earth was piled up. In this city there  is a temple very well worthy of mention, for though there are other  temples which are larger and build with more cost, none more than  this is a pleasure to the eyes. Now Bubastis in the Hellenic tongue  is Artemis, and her temple is ordered thus:--Except the entrance it is  completely surrounded by water; for channels come in from the Nile, not  joining one another, but each extending as far as the entrance of the  temple, one flowing round on the one side and the other on the other  side, each a hundred feet broad and shaded over with trees; and the  gateway has a height of ten fathoms, and it is adorned with figures six  cubits high, very noteworthy. This temple is in the middle of the city  and is looked down upon from all sides as one goes round, for since the  city has been banked up to a height, while the temple has not been moved  from the place where it was at the first built, it is possible to look  down into it: and round it runs a stone wall with figures carved upon  it, while within it there is a grove of very large trees planted round  a large temple-house, within which is the image of the goddess: and the  breadth and length of the temple is a furlong every way. Opposite the  entrance there is a road paved with stone for about three furlongs,  which leads through the market-place towards the East, with a breadth  of about four hundred feet; and on this side and on that grow trees of  height reaching to heaven: and the road leads to the temple of Hermes.  This temple then is thus ordered.    The final deliverance from the Ethiopian came about (they said) as  follows:--he fled away because he had seen in his sleep a vision, in  which it seemed to him that a man came and stood by him and counselled  him to gather together all the priests in Egypt and cut them asunder in  the midst. Having seen this dream, he said that it seemed to him that  the gods were foreshowing him this to furnish an occasion against him,  in order that he might do an impious deed with respect to religion,  and so receive some evil either from the gods or from men: he would not  however do so, but in truth (he said) the time had expired, during  which it had been prophesied to him that he should rule Egypt before  he departed thence. For when he was in Ethiopia the Oracles which the  Ethiopians consult had told him that it was fated for him to rule Egypt  fifty years: since then this time was now expiring, and the vision of  the dream also disturbed him, Sabacos departed out of Egypt of his own  free will.    Then when the Ethiopian had gone away out of Egypt, the blind man came  back from the fen-country and began to rule again, having lived there  during fifty years upon an island which he had made by heaping up ashes  and earth: for whenever any of the Egyptians visited him bringing food,  according as it had been appointed to them severally to do without the  knowledge of the Ethiopian, he bade them bring also some ashes for their  gift. This island none was able to find before Amyrtaios; that is, for  more than seven hundred years the kings who arose before Amyrtaios were  not able to find it. Now the name of this island is Elbo, and its size  is ten furlongs each way.    After him there came to the throne the priest of Hephaistos, whose name  was Sethos. This man, they said, neglected and held in no regard the  warrior class of the Egyptians, considering that he would have no need  of them; and besides other slights which he put upon them, he also  took from them the yokes of corn-land which had been given to them as  a special gift in the reigns of the former kings, twelve yokes to each  man. After this, Sanacharib king of the Arabians and of the Assyrians  marched a great host against Egypt. Then the warriors of the Egyptians  refused to come to the rescue, and the priest, being driven into a  strait, entered into the sanctuary of the temple and bewailed to the  image of the god the danger which was impending over him; and as he was  thus lamenting, sleep came upon him, and it seemed to him in his vision  that the god came and stood by him and encouraged him, saying that he  should suffer no evil if he went forth to meet the army of the Arabians;  for he would himself send him helpers. Trusting in these things seen  in sleep, he took with him, they said, those of the Egyptians who were  willing to follow him, and encamped in Pelusion, for by this way the  invasion came: and not one of the warrior class followed him, but  shop-keepers and artisans and men of the market. Then after they came,  there swarmed by night upon their enemies mice of the fields, and ate up  their quivers and their bows, and moreover the handles of their shields,  so that on the next day they fled,"]]]
