For the table make  your crosspieces about twenty-two inches long, nail them ladder-like but  close together on two poles, and make this table top flat on the surface  by covering it with birch bark tacked on smoothly. Having previously  fastened two other poles across from tree to tree, as you did when  making the seat, you can lift the table top and lay it on the two  foundation poles; then bind it in place and the table will be finished.  Another way of using the table top is to drive four strong, stout,  forked sticks into the ground for the four table legs and place the  table top across, resting the long side poles in the crotches of the  stakes, where they may be lashed in place.    Benches for the table can be made in like manner, only have the  forked-stick legs shorter, raising the seat about eighteen inches above  the ground.    [Illustration: Camp-chair, biscuit-stick, and blanket camp-bed.]      =Camp-Cupboard=    A cupboard made of a wooden box by inserting shelves, held up by means  of cleats, will be found very convenient when nailed to a tree near the  cook-fire. Hang a door on the cupboard which will close tight and  fasten securely. Have this in mind when making out your check list, and  add hinges, with screws to fit, to your camp tools.      =Camp-Broom=    With a slender pole as a handle, hickory shoots, or twisted fibre of  inner bark of slippery-elm, for twine, and a thick bunch of the top  branchlets of balsam, spruce, hemlock, or pine for the brush part, you  can make a broom by binding the heavy ends of the branches tight to an  encircling groove cut on the handle some three inches from the end. Cut  the bottom of the brush even and straight.      =Camp-Chair=    If you have a good-size length of canvas or other strong cloth, make a  camp-chair. For the back use two strong, forked stakes standing upright,  and use two long poles with branching stubs at equal distance from the  bottom, for the sides and front legs of the chair; in the crotches of  these stubs the bottom stick on which the canvas strip is fastened will  rest.    Each side pole must be fitted into one of the forked high-back stakes,  and then the top stick on the canvas strip must be placed in the same  crotches, but in front of and resting against the side poles, thus  locking the side poles firmly in place.    To fasten the canvas on the two sticks, cut one stick to fit across the  chair-back and the other to fit across the lower front stubs. Fold one  end of the canvas strip over one stick and nail the canvas on it, so  arranging the cloth that the row of nails will come on the under side of  the stick. Turn in the edge first that the nails may go through the  double thickness of cloth. Adjust this canvas-covered stick to the top  of the chair, allowing the cloth to form a loose hanging seat; measure  the length needed for back and seat, cut it off and nail the loose end  of the canvas strip to the other stick; then fit one stick in the top of  the upright back stakes and the other stick in the bottom stubs.      =Camp Clothes-Press=    If you are in a tent tie a hanging pole from the tent ridge-pole, and  use it as a clothes-press.      =Blanket Bed=    Two short logs will be required for your blanket bed, the thicker the  better, one for the head and one for the foot, also two long, strong,  green-wood poles, one for each side of the bed; your blanket will be the  mattress.    Fold the blanket, making the seam, formed by bringing the two ends  together, run on the under-side along the centre of the doubled blanket,  not on the edge. Lap and fasten the blanket ends together with large  horse-blanket safety-pins, and with the same kind of pins make a case on  each side of the blanket fold; then run one of the poles through each  case. Chop a notch near each end of the two short logs; in these notches  place the ends of the poles and nail them securely. Have the short logs  thick enough to raise the bed up a few inches from the ground, and make  the notches sufficiently far apart to stretch the mattress out smooth,  not have it sag. A strip of canvas or khaki may be used in place of the  blanket if preferred.      =Camp Hammock=    By lashing short crosspieces to the head and foot of the side poles the  blanket mattress can be a hammock and swing between two trees, having  been attached to them with rope or straps of slippery-elm, beech, or  black birch.      =Birch-Bark Dishes=    It will be easy for girls to make their birch-bark dinner plates,  vegetable dishes, baskets, dippers, etc. Soften the thick bark by  soaking it in water; when it is pliable cut one plate the size you wish,  lay it on a flat stone or other hard substance and scrape off the  outside bark around the edges, allowing the outer bark to remain on the  bottom of the plate to give greater strength; use this plate as a guide  in cutting each of the others.    With your fingers shape the edges of the plates in an upward turn while  the bark is wet, using the smoothest side for the inside of the plate.    A large bark cornucopia with bark strap-handle can be made and carried  on the arm in place of a basket when off berrying.    Variations of circular, oblong, and rectangular bark dishes may be  worked out from strips and rectangular pieces of birch bark, and all  dishes can be turned into baskets by adding handles. When necessary to  sew the edges of bark together, always have the bark wet and soft; then  lap the edges and use a very coarse darning-needle with twine of  inner-bark fibre or rootlets; have ready hot melted grease mixed with  spruce gum to coat over the stitching and edges of the article, or you  can use white-birch resin for the same purpose.    The bark utensils will wear longer if a slender rootlet or branchlet of  pliable wood is sewed, with the \"over-and-over\" stitch, to the edge of  the article.    For round and oblong dishes or baskets, sew together the two ends of  your strip of wet bark; then sew the round or oblong bottom on the lower  edge of the bark circle. In this case it is not easy to lap the edges,  simply bring them together and finish the seam with the addition of the  slender rootlet binding.    Rectangular dishes are made by folding the wet bark according to the  diagrams and fastening the folds near the top of both ends of the  receptacle. These will hold liquids.    [Illustration: The birch-bark dish that will hold fluids. Details of  making.]      =Cooking Utensils=    A forked stick with points sharpened makes a fine toasting-fork or  broiling-stick for bacon or other small pieces of meat. The meat is  stuck on the two prongs and held over the fire.    A split-end stick may be used for the same purpose by wedging the bacon  in between the two sides of the split.    Your rolling-pin can be a peeled, straight, smooth, round stick, and a  similar stick, not necessarily straight but longer, may do duty as a  biscuit baker when a strip of dough is wound spirally around it and held  over the fire.    A hot flat stone can also be used for baking biscuits, and a large  flat-topped rock makes a substitute for table and bread-board combined.    If you have canned goods, save every tin can when empty, melt off the  top, and with nail and hammer puncture a hole on two opposite sides near  the top, and fasten in a rootlet handle. These cans make very  serviceable and useful cooking-pails.    Whittle out a long-handled cake-turner from a piece of thin split wood,  and also whittle out a large flat fork.    Make a number of pot-hooks of different lengths, they are constantly  needed at camp; select strong green sticks with a crotch on one end and  drive a nail slantingly into the wood near the bottom of the stick on  which to hang kettles, pots, etc. Be sure to have the nail turn up and  the short side of the crotch turn down as in diagram.    Campers employ various methods of making candlesticks. One method is to  lash a candle to the side of the top of a stake driven into the ground,  or the stake can have a split across the centre of the top, and the  candle held upright by a strip of bark wedged in the split with a loop  on one side holding the candle and the two ends of the bark extending  out beyond the other side of the stake. Again the candle is stuck into a  little mound of clay, mud, or wet sand. If you have an old glass bottle,  crack off the bottom by pouring a little water in the bottle and placing  it for a short while on the fire embers; then plant your candle in the  ground and slide the neck of the bottle over the candle. Steady it by  planting the neck of the bottle a little way in the ground and the glass  bottle will act as a windbreak for your candle.    Never leave a candle burning even for a moment unless some one is  present; it is a dangerous experiment. Fire cannot be trifled with. _Put  out_ your candle before leaving it.    A good idea before going away from camp when vacation is over is to  photograph all the different pieces of your outdoor handicraft, and when  the prints are made label each one with the month, date, and year and  state material used, time required in the making, and comments on the  work by other camp members.    Be sure to take photographs of different views of the camp as a whole,  also of each separate shelter, both the outside and the inside, and have  pictures of all camp belongings.    The authors will be greatly interested in seeing these.

This will enable us to apply ourselves  closely to the languages, all day long. Occupied as I am with Soudanese  and Bornouese, all the days fly away swifter than arrows shot by the  most expert archers. En-Noor is expected to return in the course of four  or five days. We have now all the village of Tintalous with us. It is  Tintalous encamped out in the valley.    _23d._--The orient sky flamed this morning with a pure yellow flame,  amidst a somewhat murky atmosphere.    Most of the people have a fire all night. In the morning they cower over  it like inhabitants of the poles. Of course we as well as they, having  been baked in the summer's sun, now feel the cold most acutely.    There is a species of people scattered through Soudan which correspond  to our gipsies, called Maguzawa (sing. Bamaguzai). These are  essentially a merry, care-nothing people, always half tipsy, and always  full of fun. They, however, work a little in agriculture; differing from  our gipsies, who are little more than itinerant tinkers. A boy was shown  to me to-day, whom his parents had christened _Butu_, \"worthless.\" It is  related that his mother had many children before him, all of whom died,  and when he came into the world the people or neighbours all cried,  \"_Butu! Butu!_\" i.e. \"He will come to nothing.\" Then, it is added, \"God  seeing the people gave him a bad name, determined in compassion to  preserve his life, and so his life was preserved to this day.\"    En-Noor returned this evening from his visit to the marabout.--It is my  intention to send home fifty thousand African words for this expedition.  What future expeditions may do, if my life be spared, I cannot tell. I  speak for this. I imagine I have already sent to the Foreign Office six  thousand. I shall have five thousand, I hope, by the time I get to  Zinder--three of Soudanese, and two of Bornouese. I must try to get a  few words of the Aghadez language. These I can get, probably, at  Sakkatou. I must have another writer, or fighi. My present Bornouese  fighi is a very poor fellow.    _24th._--The Sunday soon came again, with the study of languages. Now  the time of our waiting here does not appear to be long enough. I have a  commercial dictionary to make.    En-Noor came to us after his return from his visit to his marabout  friend. He says of the late razzia at Tintaghoda, that the marabouts of  that town brought it all upon themselves, being the first to begin to  countenance attacks upon caravans (that is, ours). He does not pity  them; he does not care for them; and, he added, \"They have now lost all  their reputation amongst the people.\" The fact is, when we came the  marabouts did not know what course to take, whether to attack us or to  receive us; so they chose the former, in their blinded judgment, and  brought all this evil upon their heads.    The Fadeea, or Kalfadai, have decamped with their booty and their  families to the Hagar, beyond the reach of recapture or revenge.    A scorpion was found in my tent to-day, running across the sandy floor.  We look upon them now as nearly harmless, whilst the cold weather has  deprived them of all force.    _25th._--Occupied with the languages. Time passes quickly.    _26th._--Began the Bornou grammar.    _27th._--A visit from En-Noor. He put on one of my gloves, and was much  amused with it. He held out his hand, and put it on the face of his  courtiers--showing fight. It was very white, which gave him occasion to  pass to my skin, and pity my being so white. I made several useful  remarks on Haussa grammar, and begin to understand the genius of the  language.    A caravan of ghaseb has arrived from Damerghou, by which we learn that  the Sfaxee and Fezzan merchants are arrived in that country. We have  been trying to buy ghaseb of the people, or of En-Noor; but it appears  we were too late, for it is said to be all gone. The dollars are worth  only 1750 wadas here, whilst in Kanou they pass for 2500. Every article  is depreciated in value in Aheer, because food is scarce. We have,  however, managed to purchase a bullock--a great beast.    _28th._--I did not feel so well after the meat-eating; we have had so  little of it, and so seldom, that a little extra quite upsets me, and  the gnawing it makes all my teeth bleed. Thermometer, 50 deg.. The weather  has changed to mistiness, haziness. It is now reported that we still  remain here twenty-five days longer, the caravan arriving only in twenty  days, and five being allowed to rest the camels. So we have time enough  for the Haussa and Bornou languages. I wish to master the grammar of  each, so as to superintend some translation of the Scriptures.    _29th._--The weather is still hazy, and warmer; but whilst it is warmer  in the morning it is cooler in the mid-day, on account of the clouds and  haze. Half an hour after sunrise, thermometer 56 deg..    En-Noor says we shall start in seventeen days, but ten days more or less  for these people are nothing. Our courier for the money has just been  gone thirty-three days. If, happily, he arrive to day, he will save a  week of the Shantah from Mourzuk to Tripoli. If we remain here now  twenty-five days, and are thirty-five days more before we arrive at  Zinder, that will be sixty days. I shall then have only twenty days more  to wait till the expiration of the four months, when I may expect the  courier to return. Thus I hope to have the money to pay the Sfaxee  before I go to Sakkatou. But, alas! such calculations are extremely  uncertain, and we cannot tell what a day may bring forth. For our  support and safety we must repose firmly in the goodness of an Almighty  Providence.    _Nov. 30th to Dec. 3d._--The weather has been mild these last few days;  this morning, half an hour after sunrise, thermometer 51 deg..    En-Noor has been to pay a visit to the Sultan of Asoudee, meeting him at  some neighbouring village. There was a council respecting the affairs of  the tribe of the Iteesan, who are fighting amongst themselves; but no  news has transpired since his return. The old sheikh is in good health  and spirits, which he attributes partly to drinking my coffee twice and  thrice a-day. He says we shall leave here in the course of twelve days.    Senna is grown, or rather collected, in all the districts of Aheer; but  it is cheap now, and does not fetch the price in Tripoli which it  formerly did; many other as suitable purgatives being found in Europe, I  suppose. Senna is, besides, procured from the district of the Tibboos of  Bilma, and some of this is still sent to Tripoli. Bornou has also much  senna, but it does not pay the expense of forwarding it to Tripoli.    The relations of man and wife in Aheer are curious, if not  extraordinary. A woman never leaves the home of her father! When a man  marries a woman, he remains with her a few weeks, and then, if he will  not take up his residence in the town or village of his wife, he must  return to his own place without her. When a man sees a woman who pleases  him, he offers the parents a price for her--say, four camels. If the  parents agree that the price is adequate to the charms or the rank of  their daughter, the bargain is concluded. These four camels remain  always the property of the wife, with which she supports herself,  sending them to Soudan or to Bilma, fetching ghaseb or salt. Many of the  women have a large property obtained in this way. When their husbands  visit them, they give them something to eat, and they remain a few days  or weeks; and again depart to their own native towns, leaving the wife  with her property, and any chance lover. But the men marry two or three  wives, and so are constantly in motion, first going to visit one wife  and then another. Thus the male population of this country is kept in a  continually restless state of activity--roaming about here and there,  marrying another and another wife, if their means will permit them. The  women, of course, left in this way, and unrestrained by any high moral  motives, take as many lovers as they dare, or can secretly dispose of.  It appears that En-Noor always disapproved of this strange system, and  swore he would never marry a wife, because he should be obliged to go to  another town to reside there, and so be exposed to having an inferior  position, the authorities of the town of his wife pretending to exercise  jurisdiction over him. All his women have ever been slaves. His highness  is now living amidst his daughters and their children--the men who  married them being all away in their own native countries. A daughter of  En-Noor costs ten camels, and this is considered a very high price for a  woman. With two or three camels, a woman manages to support herself and  children. If the husbands of En-Noor's daughters be ever so poor, he  never gives them anything but a little food. They must come and reside  in his town. His highness passes all his evenings amidst this circle of  women--his female slaves, his daughters, and granddaughters.    The population of Gouber and Maradee together may be about 1500.    _Maradee_, capital of Maradee, and residence of the Siriki.    _Jinubakai_ is the second division of the country, inhabited wholly by  the pagans or gia-drinkers (beer-drinkers); not, therefore, Mahometans.    _Gouber_ (Gubar), is the name of the country, of which the capital and  residence of the sultan is _Chibri_. This country consists of a large  city (Chibri), and several small villages, some fifty or sixty; two are  here mentioned, Gomer and Sanna.    These two countries of Gouber and Maradee are now in alliance against  the Sultan of Sakkatou, i.e. of the Fellatahs, and mutually inflict  razzias upon one another. Tesaoua is in close connexion with these  ancient Kohlan countries, and is, indeed, a province of Maradee. There  are mixed up with the population a"]]]
