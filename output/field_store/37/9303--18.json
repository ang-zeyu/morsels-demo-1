Indeed any man whose  eye gazeth upon His Words with true faith well deserveth Paradise; and one  whose conscience beareth witness unto His Words with true faith shall  abide in Paradise and attain the presence of God; and one whose tongue  giveth utterance to His Words with true faith shall have his abode in  Paradise, wherein he will be seized with ecstasy in praise and  glorification of God, the Ever-Abiding, Whose revelations of glory never  end and the reviving breaths of Whose holiness never fail. Every hand  which setteth down His Words with true faith shall be filled by God, both  in this world and in the next, with things that are highly prized; and  every breast which committeth His Words to memory, God shall cause, if it  were that of a believer, to be filled with His love; and every heart which  cherisheth the love of His Words and manifesteth in itself the signs of  true faith when His Name is mentioned, and exemplifieth the words, 'their  hearts are thrilled with awe at the mention of God',(64) that heart will  become the object of the glances of divine favour and on the Day of  Resurrection will be highly praised by God. IX, 10.          \"If at the time of the appearance of Him Whom God will ...\"      If at the time of the appearance of Him Whom God will make manifest all  the dwellers of the earth were to bear witness unto a thing whereunto He  beareth witness differently, His testimony would be like unto the sun,  while theirs would be even as a false image produced in a mirror which is  not facing the sun. For had it been otherwise their testimony would have  proved a faithful reflection of His testimony.    I swear by the most sacred Essence of God that but one line of the Words  uttered by Him is more sublime than the words uttered by all that dwell on  earth. Nay, I beg forgiveness for making this comparison. How could the  reflections of the sun in the mirror compare with the wondrous rays of the  sun in the visible heaven? The station of one is that of nothingness,  while the station of the other, by the righteousness of God--hallowed and  magnified be His Name--is that of the Reality of things....    If in the Day of His manifestation a king were to make mention of his own  sovereignty, this would be like unto a mirror challenging the sun, saying:  'The light is in me'. It would be likewise, if a man of learning in His  Day were to claim to be an exponent of knowledge, or if he who is  possessed of riches were to display his affluence, or if a man wielding  power were to assert his own authority, or if one invested with grandeur  were to show forth his glory. Nay, such men would become the object of the  derision of their peers, and how would they be judged by Him Who is the  Sun of Truth! III, 12.          \"It is not permissible to ask questions from Him Whom ...\"      It is not permissible to ask questions from Him Whom God will make  manifest, except that which well beseemeth Him. For His station is that of  the Essence of divine Revelation... Whatever evidence of bounty is  witnessed in the world, is but an image of His bounty; and every thing  owes its existence to His Being... The Bayan is, from beginning to end,  the repository of all of His attributes, and the treasury of both His fire  and His light. Should anyone desire to ask questions, he is allowed to do  so only in writing, that he may derive ample understanding from His  written reply and that it may serve as a sign from his Beloved. However,  let no one ask aught that may prove unworthy of His lofty station. For  instance, were a person to inquire the price of straw from a merchant of  rubies, how ignorant would he be and how unacceptable. Similarly  unacceptable would be the questions of the highest-ranking people of the  world in His presence, except such words as He Himself would utter about  Himself in the Day of His manifestation.    Methinks I visualize those who would, prompted by their own deluded  conceptions, write to Him and ask Him questions about that which hath been  revealed in the Bayan, and He would answer them with words not of His Own,  but divinely inspired, saying: 'Verily, verily, I am God; no God is there  but Me. I have called into being all the created things, I have raised up  divine Messengers in the past and have sent down Books unto Them. Take  heed not to worship anyone but God, He Who is My Lord and your Lord. This  indeed is the undoubted truth. However, alike shall it be to Me; if ye  believe in Me, ye will provide good for your own souls, and if ye believe  not in Me, nor in that which God hath revealed unto Me, ye will suffer  yourselves to be shut out as by a veil. For verily I have been independent  of you heretofore, and shall remain independent hereafter. Therefore it  behooveth you, O creatures of God, to help your own selves and to believe  in the Verses revealed by Me...' III, 13.          \"The Bayan shall constitute God's unerring balance till the ...\"      The Bayan shall constitute God's unerring balance till the Day of  Resurrection which is the Day of Him Whom God will make manifest. Whoso  acteth in conformity with that which is revealed therein will abide in  Paradise, under the shadow of His affirmation and reckoned among the most  sublime Letters in the presence of God; while whoso deviateth, were it  even so much as the tip of a grain of barley, will be consigned to the  fire and will be assembled neath the shadow of negation. This truth hath  likewise been laid bare in the Qur'an where in numerous instances God hath  set down that whoever should pass judgement contrary to the bounds fixed  by Him, would be deemed an infidel...    In these days how few are those who abide by the standard laid down in the  Qur'an. Nay, nowhere are they to be found, except such as God hath willed.  Should there be, however, such a person, his righteous deeds would prove  of no avail unto him, if he hath failed to follow the standard revealed in  the Bayan; even as the pious deeds of the Christian monks profited them  not, inasmuch as at the time of the manifestation of the Apostle of  God--may the blessings of God rest upon Him--they contented themselves with  the standard set forth in the Gospel.    Had the divine standard laid down in the Qur'an been truly observed,  adverse judgements would not have been pronounced against Him Who is the  Tree of divine Truth. As it hath been revealed: 'Almost might the heavens  be rent and the earth be cleft asunder and the mountains fall down in  fragments.'(65) And yet how much harder than these mountains their hearts  must be to have remained unmoved! Indeed no paradise is more glorious in  the sight of God than attainment unto His good-pleasure. II, 6.          \"The One true God may be compared unto the sun and ...\"      The One true God may be compared unto the sun and the believer unto a  mirror. No sooner is the mirror placed before the sun than it reflects its  light. The unbeliever may be likened unto a stone. No matter how long it  is exposed to the sunshine, it cannot reflect the sun. Thus the former  layeth down his life as a sacrifice, while the latter doeth against God  what he committeth. Indeed, if God willeth, He is potent to turn the stone  into a mirror, but the person himself remaineth reconciled to his state.  Had he wished to become a crystal, God would have made him to assume  crystal form. For on that Day whatever cause prompteth the believer to  believe in Him, the same will also be available to the unbeliever. But  when the latter suffereth himself to be wrapt in veils, the same cause  shutteth him out as by a veil. Thus, as is clearly evident today, those  who have set their faces toward God, the True One, have believed in Him  because of the Bayan, while such as are veiled have been deprived because  of it. VI, 4.          \"I swear by the most holy Essence of God--exalted and ...\"      I Swear by the most holy Essence of God--exalted and glorified be He--that  in the Day of the appearance of Him Whom God shall make manifest a  thousand perusals of the Bayan cannot equal the perusal of a single verse  to be revealed by Him Whom God shall make manifest.    Ponder a while and observe that everything in Islam hath its ultimate and  eventual beginning in the Book of God. Consider likewise the Day of the  Revelation of Him Whom God shall make manifest, He in Whose grasp lieth  the source of proofs, and let not erroneous considerations shut thee out  from Him, for He is immeasurably exalted above them, inasmuch as every  proof proceedeth from the Book of God which is itself the supreme  testimony, as all men are powerless to produce its like. Should myriads of  men of learning, versed in logic, in the science of grammar, in law, in  jurisprudence and the like, turn away from the Book of God, they would  still be pronounced unbelievers. Thus the fruit is within the supreme  testimony itself, not in the things derived therefrom. And know thou of a  certainty that every letter revealed in the Bayan is solely intended to  evoke submission unto Him Whom God shall make manifest, for it is He Who  hath revealed the Bayan prior to His Own manifestation. V, 8.          \"In this Revelation the Lord of the universe hath deigned ...\"      In this Revelation the Lord of the universe hath deigned to bestow His  mighty utterances and resplendent signs upon the Point of the Bayan, and  hath ordained them as His matchless testimony for all created things. Were  all the people that dwell on earth to assemble together, they would be  unable to produce a single verse like unto the ones which God hath caused  to stream forth from the tongue of the Point of the Bayan. Indeed, if any  living creature were to pause to meditate he would undoubtedly realize  that these verses are not the work of man, but are solely to be ascribed  unto God, the One, the Peerless, Who causeth them to flow forth from the  tongue of"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/18833"],[0,"With Clive in India; Or, The Beginnings of an Empire (#16)"],[1,"acked.\"    The first part of the night passed quietly. Double sentries were  placed at each of the angles of the walls. The cannons were loaded,  and all ready for instant action. Doctor Rae and his two subalterns  were upon the alert, visiting the posts every quarter of an hour to  see that the men were vigilant.    Towards two o'clock a dull sound was heard and, although nothing could  be seen, the men were at once called to arms, and took up the posts to  which they had already been told off on the walls. The noise  continued. It was slight and confused, but the natives are so quiet in  their movements, that the doctor did not doubt that a considerable  body of men were surrounding the place, and that he was about to be  attacked.    Presently one of the sentries over the gateway perceived something  approaching. He challenged, and immediately afterwards fired. The  sound of his gun seemed to serve as the signal for an assault, and a  large body of men rushed forward at the gate, while at two other  points a force ran up to the foot of the walls, and endeavoured to  plant ladders.    The garrison at once collected at the points of attack, a few sentries  only being left at intervals on the wall, to give notice should any  attempt be made elsewhere. From the walls, a heavy fire of musketry  was poured upon the masses below; while from the windows of all the  houses around, answering flashes of fire shot out, a rain of bullets  being directed at the battlements. Doctor Rae himself commanded at the  gate; one of the subalterns at each of the other points assailed.    The enemy fought with great determination. Several times the ladders  were planted and the men swarmed up them, but as often these were  hurled back upon the crowd below. At the gate the assailants  endeavoured to hew their way, with axes, through it; but so steady was  the fire directed, from the loopholes which commanded it, upon those  so engaged, that they were, each time, forced to recoil with great  slaughter. It was not until nearly daybreak that the attack ceased,  and the assailants, finding that they could not carry the place by a  coup de main, fell back.    The next day, the main body of the British force returned with the  convoy. News arrived, the following day, that the enemy were  approaching to lay siege to the place.    The news of the capture of Arcot had produced the effect which Clive  had anticipated from it. It alarmed and irritated the besiegers of  Trichinopoli, and inspired the besieged with hope and exultation. The  Mahratta chief of Gutti and the Rajah of Mysore, with whom Muhammud  Ali had for some time been negotiating, at once declared in his  favour. The Rajah of Tanjore and the chief of Pudicota, adjoining that  state, who had hitherto remained strictly neutral, now threw in their  fortunes with the English, and thereby secured the communications  between Trichinopoli and the coast.    Chunda Sahib determined to lose not a moment in recovering Arcot,  knowing that its recapture would at once cool the ardour of the new  native allies of the English; and that, with its capture, the last  hope of the besieged in Trichinopoli would be at an end. Continuing  the siege, he despatched three thousand of his best troops, with a  hundred and fifty Frenchmen, to reinforce the two thousand men already  near Arcot, under the command of his son Riza Sahib. Thus the force  about to attack Arcot amounted to five thousand men; while the  garrison under Clive's orders had, by the losses in the defence of the  fort, by fever and disease, been reduced to one hundred and twenty  Europeans, and two hundred Sepoys; while four out of the eight  officers were hors de combat.    The fort which this handful of men had to defend was in no way capable  of offering a prolonged resistance. Its walls were more than a mile in  circumference, and were in a very bad state of repair. The rampart was  narrow and the parapet low, and the ditch, in many places, dry. The  fort had two gates. These were in towers standing beyond the ditch,  and connected with the interior by a causeway across it. The houses in  the town in many places came close up to the walls, and from their  roofs the ramparts of the forts were commanded.    On the 23rd September Riza Sahib, with his army, took up his position  before Arcot. Their guns had not, however, arrived, with the exception  of four mortars; but they at once occupied all the houses near the  fort, and from the walls and upper windows kept up a heavy fire on the  besieged.    Clive determined to make an effort, at once, to drive them from this  position, and he accordingly, on the same afternoon, made a sortie. So  deadly a fire, however, was poured into the troops as they advanced,  that they were unable to make any way, and were forced to retreat into  the fort again, after suffering heavy loss.    On the night of the 24th, Charlie Marryat, with twenty men carrying  powder, was lowered from the walls; and an attempt was made to blow up  the houses nearest to them; but little damage was done, for the enemy  were on the alert, and they were unable to place the powder in  effective positions, and with a loss of ten of their number the  survivors with difficulty regained the fort.    For the next three weeks the position remained unchanged. So heavy was  the fire which the enemy, from their commanding position, maintained,  that no one could show his head for a moment, without running the risk  of being shot. Only a few sentinels were kept upon the walls, to  prevent the risk of surprise, and these had to remain stooping below  the parapet. Every day added to the losses.    Captain Clive had a series of wonderful escapes, and indeed the men  began to regard him with a sort of superstitious reverence, believing  that he had a charmed life. One of his three remaining officers,  seeing an enemy taking deliberate aim at him through a window,  endeavoured to pull him aside. The native changed his aim, and the  officer fell dead. On three other occasions sergeants, who accompanied  him on his rounds, were shot dead by his side. Yet no ball touched  him.    Provisions had been stored in the fort, before the commencement of the  siege, sufficient for sixty days; and of this a third was already  exhausted when, on the 14th of October, the French troops serving with  Riza Sahib received two eighteen-pounders, and seven smaller pieces of  artillery. Hitherto the besiegers had contented themselves with  harassing the garrison night and day, abstaining from any attack which  would cost them lives, until the arrival of their guns. Upon receiving  these, they at once placed them in a battery which they had prepared  on the northwest of the fort, and opened fire.    So well was this battery placed, and so accurate the aim of its gunner,  that the very first shot dismounted one of the eighteen-pounders in the  fort. The second again struck the gun and completely disabled it. The  besieged mounted their second heavy gun in its place, and were preparing  to open fire on the French battery, when a shot struck it also and  dismounted it. It was useless to attempt to replace it, and it was,  during the night, removed to a portion of the walls not exposed to the  fire of the enemy's battery. The besiegers continued their fire, and in  six days had demolished the wall facing their battery, making a breach  of fifty feet wide.    Clive, who had now only the two young subalterns serving under him,  worked indefatigably. His coolness and confidence of bearing kept up  the courage of his little garrison, and every night, when darkness hid  them from the view of the enemy's sharpshooters, the men laboured to  prepare for the impending attack. Works were thrown up inside the  fort, to command the breach. Two deep trenches were dug, one behind  the other; the one close to the wall, the other some distance farther  back. These trenches were filled with sharp iron three-pointed spikes,  and palisades erected extending from the ends of the ditches to the  ramparts, and a house pulled down in the rear to the height of a  breastwork, behind which the garrison could fire at the assailants, as  they endeavoured to cross the ditches.    One of the three field pieces Clive had brought with him he mounted on  a tower, flanking the breach outside. Two he held in reserve, and  placed two small guns, which he had found in the fort when he took it,  on the flat roof of a house in the fort commanding the inside of the  breach.    From the roofs of some of the houses around the fort the besiegers  beheld the progress of these defences; and Riza Sahib feared, in spite  of his enormously superior numbers, to run the risk of a repulse. He  knew that the amount of provisions which Clive had stored was not  large, and thinking that famine would inevitably compel his surrender,  shrank from incurring the risk of disheartening his army, by the  slaughter which an unsuccessful attempt to carry the place must  entail. He determined, at any rate, to increase the probability of  success, and utilize his superior forces, by making an assault at two  points, simultaneously. He therefore erected a battery on the  southwest, and began to effect a breach on that side, also.    Clive, on his part, had been busy endeavouring to obtain assistance.  His native emissaries, penetrating the enemy's lines, carried the news  of the situation of affairs in the fort to Madras, Fort Saint David,  and Trichinopoli. At Madras a few fresh troops had arrived from  England, and Mr. Saunders, feeling that Clive must be relieved at all  cost, however defenceless the state of Madras might be, despatched, on  the 20th of October, a hundred Europeans and a hundred Sepoys, under  Lieutenant Innis. These, after three days' marching, arrived at  Trivatoor, twenty-two miles from Arcot.    Riza Sahib had heard of his approach; and sent a large body of troops,  with two guns, to attack him.
