That sightless pair, for many a day--from me their scanty food have earned,      What lot is theirs, when I'm away--to the five elements returned?[147]      Alike all wretched they, as I--ah, whose this triple deed of blood?      For who the herbs will now supply--the roots, the fruit, their blameless          food?'      My troubled soul, that plaintive moan--no sooner heard, so faint and low,      Trembled to look on what I'd done--fell from my shuddering hand my bow.      Swift I rushed up, I saw him there--heart-pierced, and fall'n the stream          beside,      That hermit boy with knotted hair--his clothing was the black deer's hide.      On me most piteous turned his look--his wounded breast could scarce respire,      'What wrong, oh Kshatriya,[148] have I done--to be thy deathful arrow's aim,      The forest's solitary son--to draw the limpid stream I came.      Both wretched and both blind they lie--in the wild wood all destitute,      My parents, listening anxiously--to hear my home-returning foot.      By this, thy fatal shaft, this one--three miserable victims fall,      The sire, the mother, and the son--ah why? and unoffending all.      How vain my father's life austere--the Veda's studied page how vain,      He knew not with prophetic fear--his son would fall untimely slain.      But had he known, to one as he--so weak, so blind, 'twere bootless all,      No tree can save another tree--by the sharp hatchet marked to fall.      But to my father's dwelling haste--oh Raghu's[149] son, lest in his ire,      Thy head with burning curse he blast--as the dry forest tree the fire.      Thee to my father's lone retreat--will quickly lead yon onward path,      Oh haste, his pardon to entreat--or ere he curse thee in his wrath.      Yet first, that gently I may die--draw forth the barbed steel from hence,      Allay thy fears, no Brahmin I--not thine of Brahmin blood the offence.      My sire, a Brahmin hermit he--my mother was of Sudra race.'[150]      So spake the wounded boy, on me--while turned his unreproaching face.      As from his palpitating breast--I gently drew the mortal dart,      He saw me trembling stand, and blest--that boy's pure spirit seemed to part.      As died that holy hermit's son--from me my glory seemed to go,      With troubled mind I stood, cast down--t' inevitable endless woe.      That shaft that seemed his life to burn--like serpent venom, thus drawn out,      I, taking up his fallen urn--t' his father's dwelling took my route.      There miserable, blind, and old--of their sole helpmate thus forlorn,      His parents did these eyes behold--like two sad birds with pinions shorn.      Of him in fond discourse they sate--lone, thinking only of their son,      For his return so long, so late--impatient, oh by me undone.      My footsteps' sound he seemed to know--and thus the aged hermit said,      'Oh, Yajnadatta, why so slow?--haste, let the cooling draught be shed.      Long, on the river's pleasant brink--hast thou been sporting in thy joy,      Thy mother's fainting spirits sink--in fear for thee, but thou, my boy,      If aught to grieve thy gentle heart--thy mother or thy sire do wrong,      Bear with us, nor when next we part--on the slow way thus linger long.      The feet of those that cannot move--of those that cannot see the eye,      Our spirits live but in thy love--Oh wherefore, dearest, no reply?'        My throat thick swollen with bursting tears--my power of speech that            seemed to choke,      With hands above my head, my fears--breaking my quivering voice, I spoke;      'The Kshatriya Dasaratha I--Oh hermit sage, 'tis not thy son!      Most holy ones, unknowingly--a deed of awful guilt I've done.      With bow in hand I took my way--along Sarayu's pleasant brink,      The savage buffalo to slay--or elephant come down to drink.      A sound came murmuring to my ear--'twas of the urn that slowly filled,      I deemed some savage wild-beast near--my erring shaft thy son had killed.      A feeble groan I heard, his breast--was pierced by that dire arrow keen:      All trembling to the spot I pressed--lo there thy hermit boy was seen.      Flew to the sound my arrow, meant--the wandering elephant to slay,      Toward the river brink it went--and there thy son expiring lay.      The fatal shaft when forth I drew--to heaven his parting spirit soared,      Dying he only thought of you--long, long, your lonely lot deplored.      Thus ignorantly did I slay--your child beloved, Oh hermit sage!      Turn thou on me, whose fated day--is come, thy all-consuming rage.'      He heard my dreadful tale at length--he stood all lifeless, motionless;      Then deep he groaned, and gathering strength--me his meek suppliant did          address.      'Kshatriya, 'tis well that thou hast turned--thy deed of murder to rehearse,      Else over all thy land had burned--the fire of my wide-wasting curse.      If with premeditated crime--the unoffending blood thou'dst spilt,      The Thunderer on his throne sublime--had shaken at such tremendous guilt.      Against the anchorite's sacred head--hadst, knowing, aimed thy shaft          accursed,      In th' holy Vedas deeply read--thy skull in seven wide rents had burst.      But since, unwitting, thou hast wrought--that deed of death, thou livest          still,      Oh son of Raghu, from thy thought--dismiss all dread of instant ill.      Oh lead me to that doleful spot--where my poor boy expiring lay,      Beneath the shaft thy fell hand shot--of my blind age, the staff, the stay.      On the cold earth 'twere yet a joy--to touch my perished child again,      (So long if I may live) my boy--in one last fond embrace to strain.      His body all bedewed with gore--his locks in loose disorder thrown,      Let me, let her but touch once more--to the dread realm of Yama gone.'      Then to that fatal place I brought--alone that miserable pair;      His sightless hands, and hers I taught--to touch their boy that slumbered          there.      Nor sooner did they feel him lie--on the moist herbage coldly thrown,      Both with a shrill and feeble cry--upon the body cast them down.      The mother as she lay and groaned--addressed her boy with quivering tongue,      And like a heifer sadly moaned--just plundered of her new-dropped young:      'Was not thy mother once, my son--than life itself more dear to thee?      Why the long way hast thou begun--without one gentle word to me.      One last embrace, and then, beloved--upon thy lonely journey go!      Alas! with anger art thou moved--that not a word thou wilt bestow?'        The miserable father now[151]--with gentle touch each cold limb pressed,      And to the dead his words of woe--as to his living son, addressed:      'I too, my son, am I not here?--thy sire with thy sad mother stands;      Awake, arise, my child, draw near--and clasp each neck with loving hands.      Who now, 'neath the dark wood by night--a pious reader shall be heard?      Whose honied voice my ear delight--with th' holy Veda's living word?      The evening prayer, th' ablution done--the fire adored with worship meet,      Who now shall soothe like thee, my son--with fondling hand, my aged feet?      And who the herb, the wholesome root--or wild fruit from the wood shall          bring?      To us the blind, the destitute--with helpless hunger perishing?      Thy blind old mother, heaven-resigned--within our hermit-dwelling lone,      How shall I tend, myself as blind--now all my strength of life is gone!      Oh stay, my child, Oh part not yet--to Yama's dwelling go not now,      To-morrow forth we all will set--thy mother, and myself, and thou:      For both, in grief for thee, and both--so helpless, ere another day,      From this dark world, but little loath--shall we depart, death's easy prey!      And I myself, by Yama's seat--companion of thy darksome way,      The guerdon to thy virtues meet--from that great Judge of men will pray.      Because, my boy, in innocence--by wicked deed thou hast been slain,      Rise, where the heroes dwell, who thence--ne'er stoop to this dark world          again.      Those that to earth return no more--the sense-subdued, the hermits wise,      Priests their sage masters that adore--to their eternal seats arise.      Those that have studied to the last--the Veda's, the Vedanga's page,      Where saintly kings of earth have passed--Nahusa and Yayati sage;      The sires of holy families--the true to wedlock's sacred vow;      And those that cattle, gold, or rice--or lands with liberal hands bestow;      That ope th' asylum to th' oppressed--that ever love, and speak the truth,      Up to the dwellings of the blest--th' eternal, soar thou, best loved youth.      For none of such a holy race--within the lowest seat may dwell;      But that will be his fatal place--by whom my only offspring fell.'        So groaning deep, that wretched pair--the hermit and his wife, essayed      The meet ablution to prepare--their hands their last faint effort made.      Divine, with glorious body bright--in splendid car of heaven elate,      Before them stood their son in light--and thus consoled their helpless          state:      'Meed of my duteous filial care--I've reached the wished for realms of          joy;[152]      And ye, in those glad realms, prepare--to meet full soon your dear-loved          boy.      My parents, weep no more for me--yon warrior monarch slew me not,      My death was thus ordained to be;--predestined was the shaft he shot.\"      Thus, as he spoke, the anchorite's son--soared up the glowing heaven afar,      In air his heavenly body shone--while stood he in his gorgeous car.      But they, of that lost boy so dear--the last ablution meetly made,      Thus spoke to me that holy seer--with folded hands above his head.

(3) The Motor Processes centrally disturbed.    _a. Centro-motor Dysphasia and Aphasia, Aphemia, Asymbolia,  Asemia._--Children have not yet learned, or have hardly learned, the use  of language, although their intelligence is already sufficient. There is  no longer any deficiency in the development of the external organs of  speech, no muscular weakness, no imperfection of the nervous structures  that effect the articulation of the separate sounds, for intelligence  shows itself in the child's actions; he forms the separate sounds  correctly, unintentionally; his hearing is good and the sensory  word-memory is present, since the child already obeys. His _not yet_  speaking at this period (commonly as late as the second year) must  accordingly be essentially of centro-motor character.    In the various forms of this condition there is injury or lack of  sufficient relative development either in the centro-motorium M or in  the paths that lead into it, _d_, _e_, _f_ as well as _i_, _l_, _n_.    _[alpha]. Central Dysarthria and Anarthria._--In the child at the stage  of development just indicated articulation is _not yet_ perfect,  inasmuch as while he often unintentionally pronounces correctly sounds,  syllables, and single words, yet he can not form these intentionally,  although he hears and understands them aright. He makes use of gestures.    _Ataxic Aphasia (Verbal Anarthria)._--The child that already understands  several words as sound-combinations and retains them (since he obeys),  can not yet use these in speech because he has not yet the requisite  centro-motor impulses. He forms correctly the few syllables he has  already learned of his future language, i. e., those he has at the time  in memory as sound-combinations (sensory), but can _not yet_ group them  into new words; e. g., he says _bi_ and _te_ correctly, learns also to  say \"_bitte_,\" but not yet at this period \"tibe,\" \"tebi.\" He lacks still  the motor co-ordination of words.    At this period the gesture-language and modulation of voice of the child  are generally easy to understand, as in case of pure ataxic aphasia (the  verbal asemia or asymbolia of Finkelnburg) are the looks and gestures  of aphasic adults. Chiefly _n_, _f_, and M are as yet imperfectly  developed.    _Central Stammering and Lisping (Literal Dysarthria)._--Children just  beginning to form sentences stammer, not uttering the sounds correctly.  They also, as a rule, lisp for a considerable time, so that the words  spoken by them are still indistinct and are intelligible only to the  persons most intimately associated with them.    The paths _d_ and _i_, and consequently the centro-motorium M, come  chiefly into consideration here; but L also is concerned, so far as from  it comes the motor impulse to make a sound audible through M.    The babbling of the infant is not to be confounded with this. That  imports merely the unintentional production of single disconnected  articulate sounds with non-cooerdinated movements of the tongue on  account of uncontrolled excitement of the nerves of the tongue.    _Stuttering (Syllabic Dysarthria)._--Stutterers articulate each separate  sound correctly, but connect the consonants, especially the explosive  sounds, with the succeeding vowels badly, with effort as if an obstacle  were to be overcome. The paths _i_ and _l_ are affected, and hence M is  not properly excited. S, too, comes under consideration in the case of  stuttering, so far as impulses go out from it for the pronunciation of  the syllables.    Children who can not yet speak of themselves but can repeat what is said  for them, exert themselves unnecessarily, making a strong expiratory  effort (with the help of abdominal pressure) to repeat a syllable still  unfamiliar, and they pause between the doubled or tripled consonant and  vowel. This peculiarity, which soon passes away and is to be traced  often to the lack of practice and to embarrassment (in case of threats),  and which may be observed _occasionally_ in every child, is stuttering  proper, although it appears more seldom than in stutterers. Example: The  child of two years is to say \"Tischdecke,\" and he begins with an  unnecessary expiratory effort, _T-t-itt-t_, and does not finish.    Stuttering is by no means a physiological transition-stage through which  every child learning to speak must necessarily pass. But it is easily  acquired, in learning to speak, by imitation of stutterers, in frequent  intercourse with them. Hence, stutterers have sometimes stuttering  children.    _[beta]. Stumbling at Syllables._--Children that already articulate  correctly separate sounds, and do so intentionally, very often put  together syllables out of the sounds incorrectly, and frame words  incorrectly from the syllables, where we can not assume deficient  development of the external organs of speech; this is solely because the  co-ordination is still imperfect. The child accordingly says _beti_  before he can say _bitte_; so too _grefessen_ instead of _gefressen_.    The tracts _l_ and _n_ are still incompletely developed; also S and W,  so far as impulses come thence to utter syllables by means of M.    _b. Paraphasia._--Children have learned some expressions in their future  language, and use them independently but wrongly; they put in the place  of the appropriate word an incorrect one, confounding words because they  can _not yet_ correctly combine their ideas with the word-images. They  say, e. g., _Kind_ instead of \"Kinn,\" and _Sand_ instead of \"Salz\"; also  _Netz_ for \"Nest\" and _Billard_ for \"Billet,\" _Matrone_ for \"Patrone.\"    The connection of D with M through _n_ is still imperfect, and perhaps  also M is not sufficiently developed.    _Making Mistakes in Speaking (Skoliophasia)._--In this kind of  paraphasia in adults the cause is a lack of attention; therefore purely  central concentration is wanting, or one fails to \"collect himself\";  there is distraction, hence the unintentional, frequently unconscious,  confounding of words similar in sound or connected merely by remote,  often dim, reminiscences. This kind of mis-speaking through carelessness  is distinguished from skoliophrasia (see below) by the fact that there  is no disturbance of the intelligence, and the correction easily  follows.    Skoliophasia occurs regularly with children in the second and third  years (and later). The child in general has not yet the ability to  concentrate his attention upon that which is to be spoken. He _wills_ to  do it but _can_ not yet. Hence, even in spite of the greatest effort,  occur often erroneous repetitions of words pronounced for him (aside  from difficulties of articulation, and also when these are wanting);  hence confounding (of words), wrong forms of address, e. g., _Mama_ or  _Helene_ instead of \"Papa,\" and _Papa_ instead of \"Marie.\"    _c. Taciturnity (Dumbness)._--Individual human beings of sound physical  condition who can speak very well are dumb, or speak only two or three  words in all for several years, because they no longer _will_ to speak  (e. g., in the belief that silence prevents them from doing wrong).    This taciturnity is not to be confounded with the paranoic aphrasia in  certain insane persons--e. g., in catatonia, where the will is  paralyzed.    It also occurs--seldom, however--that children who have already learned  to speak pretty well are dumb, or speak only a few words--among these  the word _no_--during several months, or speak only with certain  persons, because they _will not_ speak (out of obstinacy, or  embarrassment). Here an organic obstacle in the motor speech-center is  probable. For voluntary dumbness requires great strength of will, which  is hardly to be attributed to the child. The unwillingness to speak that  is prompted by _fun_ never lasts long.    C. THE EXPRESSIVE PERIPHERAL PROCESSES DISTURBED.    (1) Dyslalia and Alalia (Peripheral Dysarthria and Anarthria).    The infant can _not yet_ articulate correctly, or at all, on account of  the still deficient development, and afterward the lack of control, of  the nerves of speech and the external organs of speech. The complete  inability to articulate is called alalia. The newly born is alalic.  Dyslalia continues with many children a long time even after the  learning of the mother-tongue. This is always a case simply of  imperfections in _h_ and _z_.    _a. Bulbo-nuclear Stammering (Literal Bulbo-nuclear Dysarthria and  Anarthria)._--Patients who have lost control over the muscles of speech  through bulbo-nuclear paralysis, stammer before they become speechless,  and along with paralysis and atrophy of the tongue occur regularly  fibrillar contractions of the muscles of the tongue. The tongue is _no  longer_ regulated by the will.    The child that has not yet gained control over his vocal muscles  stammers before he can speak correctly, and, according to my  observations, regularly shows fibrillar contractions of the muscles of  the tongue along with an extraordinary mobility of the tongue. The  tongue is _not yet_ regulated by the will. Its movements are aimless.    _b. Mogilalia._--Children, on account of the as yet deficient control of  the external organs of speech, especially of the tongue, can _not yet_  form some sounds, and therefore omit them. They say, e. g., _in_ for  \"hin,\" _aetz_ for \"Herz,\" _eitun_ for \"Zeitung,\" _ere_ for \"Schere.\"    _Gammacism._--Children find difficulties in the voluntary utterance of K  and Ks (_x_), and indeed of G, and therefore often omit these sounds  without substituting others; they say, e. g., _atsen_ for \"Klatschen,\"  _atten_ for \"Garten,\" _asse_ for \"Gasse,\" _all_ for \"Karl,\" _ete_ for  \"Grete\" (in the second year), _wesen_ for \"gewesen,\" _opf_ for \"Kopf.\"    _Sigmatism._--All children are late in learning to pronounce correctly  S, and generally still later with Sch, and therefore omit"]]]
