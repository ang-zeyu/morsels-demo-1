Let Thine everlasting melodies breathe tranquillity on me, O my Companion,  and let the riches of Thine ancient countenance deliver me from all except  Thee, O my Master, and let the tidings of the revelation of Thine  incorruptible Essence bring me joy, O Thou Who art the most manifest of  the manifest and the most hidden of the hidden!    --Baha'u'llah        \"He is the Gracious, the All-Bountiful!...\"      He is the Gracious, the All-Bountiful!    O God, my God! Thy call hath attracted me, and the voice of Thy Pen of  Glory awakened me. The stream of Thy holy utterance hath enraptured me,  and the wine of Thine inspiration entranced me. Thou seest me, O Lord,  detached from all things but Thee, clinging to the cord of Thy bounty and  craving the wonders of Thy grace. I ask Thee, by the eternal billows of  Thy loving-kindness and the shining lights of Thy tender care and favor,  to grant that which shall draw me nigh unto Thee and make me rich in Thy  wealth. My tongue, my pen, my whole being, testify to Thy power, Thy  might, Thy grace and Thy bounty, that Thou art God and there is none other  God but Thee, the Powerful, the Mighty.    I bear witness at this moment, O my God, to my helplessness and Thy  sovereignty, my feebleness and Thy power. I know not that which profiteth  me or harmeth me; Thou art, verily, the All-Knowing, the All-Wise. Do Thou  decree for me, O Lord, my God, and my Master, that which will make me feel  content with Thine eternal decree and will prosper me in every world of  Thine. Thou art in truth the Gracious, the Bountiful.    Lord! Turn me not away from the ocean of Thy wealth and the heaven of Thy  mercy, and ordain for me the good of this world and hereafter. Verily,  Thou art the Lord of the mercy-seat, enthroned in the highest; there is  none other God but Thee, the One, the All-Knowing, the All-Wise.    --Baha'u'llah        \"O my Lord! Make Thy beauty to be my food,...\"      O my Lord! Make Thy beauty to be my food, and Thy presence my drink, and  Thy pleasure my hope, and praise of Thee my action, and remembrance of  Thee my companion, and the power of Thy sovereignty my succorer, and Thy  habitation my home, and my dwelling-place the seat Thou hast sanctified  from the limitations imposed upon them who are shut out as by a veil from  Thee.    Thou art, verily, the Almighty, the All-Glorious, the Most Powerful.    --Baha'u'llah        \"Lauded be Thy Name, O Lord my God! I am...\"      Lauded be Thy Name, O Lord my God! I am Thy servant who hath laid hold on  the cord of Thy tender mercies, and clung to the hem of Thy bounteousness.  I entreat Thee by Thy name whereby Thou hast subjected all created things,  both visible and invisible, and through which the breath that is life  indeed was wafted over the entire creation, to strengthen me by Thy power  which hath encompassed the heavens and the earth, and to guard me from all  sickness and tribulation. I bear witness that Thou art the Lord of all  names, and the Ordainer of all that may please Thee. There is none other  God but Thee, the Almighty, the All-Knowing, the All-Wise.    Do Thou ordain for me, O my Lord, what will profit me in every world of  Thy worlds. Supply me, then, with what Thou hast written down for the  chosen ones among Thy creatures, whom neither the blame of the blamer, nor  the clamor of the infidel, nor the estrangement of such as have withdrawn  from Thee, hath deterred from turning towards Thee.    Thou, truly, art the Help in Peril through the power of Thy sovereignty.  No God is there save Thee, the Almighty, the Most Powerful.    --Baha'u'llah        \"O my God, the God of bounty and mercy!...\"      O my God, the God of bounty and mercy!    Thou art that King by Whose commanding word the whole creation hath been  called into being; and Thou art that All-Bountiful One the doings of Whose  servants have never hindered Him from showing forth His grace, nor have  they frustrated the revelations of His bounty.    Suffer this servant, I beseech Thee, to attain unto that which is the  cause of his salvation in every world of Thy worlds. Thou art, verily, the  Almighty, the Most Powerful, the All-Knowing, the All-Wise.    --Baha'u'llah        \"He is the prayer-hearing, prayer-answering...\"      He is the prayer-hearing, prayer-answering God!    By Thy glory, O Beloved One, Thou giver of light to the world! The flames  of separation have consumed me, and my waywardness hath melted my heart  within me. I ask of Thee, by Thy Most Great Name, O Thou the Desire of the  world and the Well-Beloved of mankind, to grant that the breeze of Thine  inspiration may sustain my soul, that Thy wondrous voice may reach my ear,  that my eyes may behold Thy signs and Thy light as revealed in the  manifestations of Thy names and Thine attributes, O Thou within Whose  grasp are all things!    Thou seest, O Lord my God, the tears of Thy favored ones, shed because of  their separation from Thee, and the fears of Thy devoted ones in their  remoteness from Thy Holy Court. By Thy power, that swayeth all things,  visible and invisible! It behooveth Thy loved ones to shed tears of blood  for that which hath befallen the faithful at the hands of the wicked and  the oppressors on the earth. Thou beholdest, O my God, how the ungodly  have compassed Thy cities and Thy realms! I ask Thee by Thy Messengers and  Thy chosen ones and by Him whereby the standard of Thy divine unity hath  been implanted amidst Thy servants, to shield them by Thy bounty. Thou  art, verily, the Gracious, the All-Bountiful.    And, again, I ask Thee by the sweet showers of Thy grace and the billows  of the ocean of Thy favor, to ordain for Thy saints that which shall  solace their eyes and comfort their hearts. Lord! Thou seest him that  kneeleth yearning to arise and serve Thee, the dead calling for eternal  life from the ocean of Thy favor and craving to soar to the heavens of Thy  wealth, the stranger longing for his home of glory 'neath the canopy of  Thy grace, the seeker hastening by Thy mercy to Thy door of bounty, the  sinful turning to the ocean of forgiveness and pardon.    By Thy sovereignty, O Thou Who art glorified in the hearts of men! I have  turned to Thee, forsaking mine own will and desire, that Thy holy will and  pleasure may rule within me and direct me according to that which the pen  of Thy eternal decree hath destined for me. This servant, O Lord, though  helpless turneth to the Orb of Thy Power, though abased hasteneth unto the  Dayspring of Glory, though needy craveth the Ocean of Thy Grace. I beseech  Thee by Thy favor and bounty, cast him not away.    Thou art verily the Almighty, the Pardoner, the Compassionate.    --Baha'u'llah        \"Glorified art Thou, O Lord my God! I give...\"      Glorified art Thou, O Lord my God! I give Thee thanks inasmuch as Thou  hast called me into being in Thy days, and infused into me Thy love and  Thy knowledge. I beseech Thee, by Thy name whereby the goodly pearls of  Thy wisdom and Thine utterance were brought forth out of the treasuries of  the hearts of such of Thy servants as are nigh unto Thee, and through  which the Daystar of Thy name, the Compassionate, hath shed its radiance  upon all that are in Thy heaven and on Thy earth, to supply me, by Thy  grace and bounty, with Thy wondrous and hidden bounties.    These are the earliest days of my life, O my God, which Thou hast linked  with Thine own days. Now that Thou hast conferred upon me so great an  honor, withhold not from me the things Thou hast ordained for Thy chosen  ones.    I am, O my God, but a tiny seed which Thou hast sown in the soil of Thy  love, and caused to spring forth by the hand of Thy bounty. This seed  craveth, therefore, in its inmost being, for the waters of Thy mercy and  the living fountain of Thy grace. Send down upon it, from the heaven of  Thy loving-kindness, that which will enable it to flourish beneath Thy  shadow and within the borders of Thy court. Thou art He Who watereth the  hearts of all that have recognized Thee from Thy plenteous stream and the  fountain of Thy living waters.    Praised be God, the Lord of the worlds.    --Baha'u'llah        \"Vouchsafe unto me, O my God, the full measure...\"      Vouchsafe unto me, O my God, the full measure of Thy love and Thy  good-pleasure, and through the attractions of Thy resplendent light  enrapture our hearts, O Thou Who art the Supreme Evidence and the  All-Glorified. Send down upon me, as a token of Thy grace, Thy vitalizing  breezes, throughout the daytime and in the night season, O Lord of bounty.    No deed have I done, O my God, to merit beholding Thy face, and I know of  a certainty that were I to live as long as the world lasts I would fail to  accomplish any deed such as to deserve this favor, inasmuch as the station  of a servant shall ever fall short of access to Thy holy precincts, unless  Thy bounty should reach me and Thy tender mercy pervade me and Thy  loving-kindness encompass me.    All praise be unto Thee, O Thou besides Whom there is none other God.  Graciously enable me to ascend unto Thee, to be granted the honor of  dwelling in Thy nearness and to have communion with Thee alone. No God is  there but Thee.    Indeed shouldst Thou desire to confer blessing upon a servant Thou wouldst  blot out from the realm of his heart every mention or disposition except  Thine Own mention; and shouldst Thou ordain evil for a servant by reason  of that which his hands have unjustly wrought before Thy face, Thou  wouldst test him with the benefits of this world and of the next that he  might become preoccupied therewith and forget Thy remembrance.    --The Bab        \"O God! Refresh and gladden my spirit. Purify...\"      O God! Refresh and gladden my spirit. Purify my heart. Illumine my powers.  I lay all my affairs in Thy hand. Thou art my Guide and my Refuge. I will  no longer be sorrowful and grieved; I will be a "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/19243"],[0,"The Advent of Divine Justice (#16)"],[1,"  with all its increasing complexities, the work which is being initiated at  present.    It would, no doubt, be of exceptional importance and value, particularly  in these times when the various restrictions imposed in those countries  make it difficult for a considerable number of Baha'i pioneers to  establish their residence and earn their livelihood in those states, if  certain ones among the believers, whose income, however slender, provides  them with the means of an independent existence, would so arrange their  affairs as to be able to reside indefinitely in those countries. The  sacrifices involved, the courage, faith, and perseverance it demands, are  no doubt very great. Their value, however, can never be properly assessed  at the present time, and the limitless reward which they who demonstrate  them will receive can never be adequately depicted. \"They that have  forsaken their country,\" is Baha'u'llah's own testimony, \"for the purpose  of teaching Our Cause--these shall the Faithful Spirit strengthen through  its power.... By My life! No act, however great, can compare with it,  except such deeds as have been ordained by God, the All-Powerful, the Most  Mighty. Such a service is indeed the prince of all goodly deeds, and the  ornament of every goodly act.\" Such a reward, it should be noted, is not  to be regarded as purely an abstract blessing confined to the future life,  but also as a tangible benefit which such courage, faith and perseverance  can alone confer in this material world. The solid achievements, spiritual  as well as administrative, which in the far-away continent of Australasia,  and more recently in Bulgaria, representative believers from both Canada  and the United States have accomplished, proclaim in terms unmistakable  the nature of those prizes which, even in this world, such sterling  heroism is bound to win. \"Whoso,\" Baha'u'llah, in a memorable passage,  extolling those of His loved ones who have \"journeyed through the  countries in His Name and for His praise,\" has written, \"hath attained  their presence will glory in their meeting, and all that dwell in every  land will be illumined by their memory.\"    I am moved, at this juncture, as I am reminded of the share which, ever  since the inception of the Faith in the West, the handmaidens of  Baha'u'llah, as distinguished from the men, have had in opening up,  single-handed, so many, such diversified, and widely scattered countries  over the whole surface of the globe, not only to pay a tribute to such  apostolic fervor as is truly reminiscent of those heroic men who were  responsible for the birth of the Faith of Baha'u'llah, but also to stress  the significance of such a preponderating share which the women of the  West have had and are having in the establishment of His Faith throughout  the whole world. \"Among the miracles,\" 'Abdu'l-Baha Himself has testified,  \"which distinguish this sacred Dispensation is this, that women have  evinced a greater boldness than men when enlisted in the ranks of the  Faith.\" So great and splendid a testimony applies in particular to the  West, and though it has received thus far abundant and convincing  confirmation must, as the years roll away, be further reinforced, as the  American believers usher in the most glorious phase of their teaching  activities under the Seven Year Plan. The \"boldness\" which, in the words  of 'Abdu'l-Baha, has characterized their accomplishments in the past must  suffer no eclipse as they stand on the threshold of still greater and  nobler accomplishments. Nay rather, it must, in the course of time and  throughout the length and breadth of the vast and virgin territories of  Latin America, be more convincingly demonstrated, and win for the beloved  Cause victories more stirring than any it has as yet achieved.    To the Baha'i youth of America, moreover, I feel a word should be  addressed in particular, as I survey the possibilities which a campaign of  such gigantic proportions has to offer to the eager and enterprising  spirit that so powerfully animates them in the service of the Cause of  Baha'u'llah. Though lacking in experience and faced with insufficient  resources, yet the adventurous spirit which they possess, and the vigor,  the alertness, and optimism they have thus far so consistently shown,  qualify them to play an active part in arousing the interest, and in  securing the allegiance, of their fellow youth in those countries. No  greater demonstration can be given to the peoples of both continents of  the youthful vitality and the vibrant power animating the life, and the  institutions of the nascent Faith of Baha'u'llah than an intelligent,  persistent, and effective participation of the Baha'i youth, of every  race, nationality, and class, in both the teaching and administrative  spheres of Baha'i activity. Through such a participation the critics and  enemies of the Faith, watching with varying degrees of skepticism and  resentment, the evolutionary processes of the Cause of God and its  institutions, can best be convinced of the indubitable truth that such a  Cause is intensely alive, is sound to its very core, and its destinies in  safe keeping. I hope, and indeed pray, that such a participation may not  only redound to the glory, the power, and the prestige of the Faith, but  may also react so powerfully on the spiritual lives, and galvanize to such  an extent the energies of the youthful members of the Baha'i community, as  to empower them to display, in a fuller measure, their inherent  capacities, and to unfold a further stage in their spiritual evolution  under the shadow of the Faith of Baha'u'llah.    Faithful to the provisions of the Charter laid down by the pen of  'Abdu'l-Baha, I feel it my duty to draw the special attention of those to  whom it has been entrusted to the urgent needs of, and the special  position enjoyed by, the Republic of Panama, both in view of its relative  proximity to the heart and center of the Faith in North America, and of  its geographical position as the link between two continents. \"All the  above countries,\" 'Abdu'l-Baha, referring to the Latin States in one of  the Tablets of the Divine Plan, has written, \"have importance, but  especially the Republic of Panama, wherein the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans  come together through the Panama Canal. It is a center for travel and  passage from America to other continents of the world, and in the future  it will gain most great importance.\" \"Likewise,\" He again has written, \"ye  must give great attention to the Republic of Panama, for in that point the  Occident and the Orient find each other united through the Panama Canal,  and it is also situated between the two great oceans. That place will  become very important in the future. The teachings, once established  there, will unite the East and the West, the North and the South.\" So  privileged a position surely demands the special and prompt attention of  the American Baha'i community. With the Republic of Mexico already opened  up to the Faith, and with a Spiritual Assembly properly constituted in its  capital city, the southward penetration of the Faith of Baha'u'llah into a  neighboring country is but a natural and logical step, and should, it is  to be hoped, prove to be not a difficult one. No efforts should be spared,  and no sacrifice be deemed too great, to establish even though it be a  very small group in a Republic occupying, both spiritually and  geographically, so strategic a position--a group which, in view of the  potency with which the words of 'Abdu'l-Baha have already endowed it,  cannot but draw to itself, as soon as it is formed, the outpouring grace  of the Abha Kingdom, and evolve with such marvelous swiftness as to excite  the wonder and the admiration of even those who have already witnessed  such stirring evidences of the force and power of the Faith of  Baha'u'llah. Preference, no doubt, should be given by all would-be  pioneers, as well as by the members of the Inter-America Committee, to the  spiritual needs of this privileged Republic, though every effort should,  at the same time, be exerted to introduce the Faith, however tentatively,  to the Republics of Guatemala, Honduras, El Salvador, Nicaragua, and Costa  Rica which would link it, in an unbroken chain, with its mother Assemblies  in the North American continent. Obstacles, however formidable, should be  surmounted, the resources of the Baha'i treasury should be liberally  expended on its behalf, and the ablest and most precious exertions should  be consecrated to the cause of its awakening. The erection of yet another  outpost of the Faith, in its heart, will constitute, I firmly believe, a  landmark in the history of the Formative Period of the Faith of  Baha'u'llah in the New World. It will create limitless opportunities,  galvanize the efforts, and reinvigorate the life, of those who will have  accomplished this feat, and infuse immense courage and boundless joy into  the hearts of the isolated groups and individuals in the neighboring and  distant Republics, and exert intangible yet powerful spiritual influences  on the life and future development of its people.            \"SUCH, DEARLY BELOVED FRIENDS, IS THE VISTA THAT STRETCHES ...\"      Such, dearly beloved friends, is the vista that stretches before the eyes,  and challenges the resources, of the American Baha'i community in these,  the concluding years of the First Century of the Baha'i Era. Such are the  qualities and qualifications demanded of them for the proper discharge of  their responsibilities and duties. Such are the requirements, the  possibilities, and the objectives of the Plan that claims every ounce of  their energy. Who knows but that these few remaining, fast-fleeting years,  may not be pregnant with events of unimaginable magnitude, with ordeals  more severe than any that humanity has as yet experienced, with conflicts  more devastating than any"]]]
