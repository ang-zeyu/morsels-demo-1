We are particularly fond of boys, and like nothing better  than to borrow one now and then. If you come you run the risk of our  forgetting to return you; but I guess your parents will see to that,\"  he concluded with a merry laugh.    \"I rather think they will,\" replied Theo with a smile.    \"Trust them for that,\" said Mr. Croyden. \"You'd make no mistake to go  back, either, for you have a mighty fine father, sonny.\"    \"Father's--well, he's _all right_!\" declared Theo tersely but  emphatically. \"So is Mother! You must meet Mother some time. She's a  peach!\"    \"The vacation has done your father a world of good, Theo,\" reflected  Mr. Croyden, looking into the embers. \"Do you realize how much better  he looks? He is much less nervous and tired.\"    \"I hope so, sir,\" came heartily from Theo. \"I have wanted so much not  to spoil his vacation, for he needed it badly.\"    \"I am sure you have not spoiled it,\" put in Mr. Croyden quickly. \"You  can consider that in sending a doctor back to his job in A1 condition  you have done your bit to help the war. Doctors are among our most  useful and necessary men.\"    \"I know it,\" Theo returned. \"Mother and I are tremendously proud of  Father. We feel he is doing a lot of good in the world. I guess now  I'll feel that way more than ever for I never knew what it was to be  sick before.\"    There was a long pause, broken only by the velvety rustle of the logs  burning in the chimney; then Theo remarked abruptly:    \"Aren't you going to tell me anything about china to-night?\"    \"Do you wish me to?\"    \"Of course I do; that is, unless you are too tired.\"    \"I'm not tired at all,\" responded Mr. Croyden. \"I thought you might  be the tired one.\"    \"I!\"    \"Not bored?\"    \"Not so you'd notice it.\"    \"All right, then; only you'll have to let me think a minute,\" said  Mr. Croyden. \"Where did we leave off?\"    \"You had been telling me about Sevres ware and other French  porcelains.\"    \"Oh, yes! Now I remember. Well, as you can imagine, after kaolin was  discovered the secret gradually leaked out, and everybody went to work  at making china. Kings, emperors, and princes; nobles of high birth,  all took up the art with zest, spending great sums of money on  fabriques, as the porcelain factories came to be called. In Florence  Francis, one of the Dukes of the Medici, built a tiny laboratory in  the garden of the Boboli palace and there made a rude ware, some of it  hard paste and some of it soft. This was even before the St. Cloud  works were opened, and certain historians say that this was the first  true porcelain made in Europe. At a much later period (about 1735, to  be exact) the Ginori family, another titled Italian household of  wealth and position, owning estates just outside Florence, took up  porcelain-making, even sending ships to China for the necessary  clay. Fancy it! And to show you how highly this industry was esteemed  I will add that the Marquise himself superintended his workmen and  helped in manufacturing this Doccia ware, as they styled their  output.\"    \"Did this happen during the Renaissance?\" inquired Theo timidly. \"It  sounds as if it might have.\"    Mr. Croyden nodded, cordially, much gratified by the lad's  understanding.    \"That was just when it happened,\" he said. \"In the meantime, at about  the same period, a beautiful soft paste called Capo di Monte was being  made down in Naples under the patronage of Charles IV--the Charles who  afterward became Charles III of Spain. Like the rest of royalty this  King became absorbed in china-making--so absorbed that he went  frequently to work in his factories himself, and each year held a sale  of his products at the gates of his palace; whenever a piece was sold  a record of it was made and later the name of the purchaser was  reported to the King.\"    \"I suppose he, too, made the nobles buy his china,\" laughed Theo.    \"I am afraid he did,\" agreed Mr. Croyden. \"At least it was a fact  that he showed especial favor to those who did buy it, which was  practically the same thing. I think I forgot to tell you that the  French kings also forced, or perhaps I should say expected, their  courtiers and ladies to purchase Sevres ware. It was a custom of the  time.\"    \"I think it was a rotten custom!\" ejaculated Theo wrathfully.    \"Certainly it was not a desirable thing. In our day we should call it  graft. Still at that time there were plenty of people who were only  too anxious to keep their heads on their shoulders, and who would have  been glad to buy almost anything in order to do so. Doubtless they  considered a little porcelain a small price for their lives, and were  glad to win the favor of a capricious monarch by purchasing it. King  Charles was no worse than all the rest. Later, when he became ruler of  Spain, he took many of his Italian workmen there with him, and as a  consequence in 1821 the Naples fabrique was closed; many of the  moulds, as well as much of the outfitting, was sold to the Doccia  works. As a result Capo di Monte was afterward imitated in Doccia hard  and soft paste; but the original ware which is of value to collectors  was that made at Naples. It is very difficult to distinguish this  variety, for the Doccia people even copied the King's trade-mark.\"    \"I suppose people could do that then,\" ventured Theo.    \"Oh, yes. There was nothing to protect an invention as there is now,\"  replied Mr. Croyden.    \"Did King Charles continue to make porcelain in Spain?\"    \"Yes, he had a palace called Buen Retiro and here he established  fabriques that continued to thrive even up to the time of King  Ferdinand in 1780, and would probably have prospered much longer had  not the Napoleonic wars come and the French destroyed the factories.\"    \"And what became of the Doccia works in the meantime?\" queried Theo.    \"I am glad you asked that question,\" answered Mr. Croyden, \"for I had  not finished speaking about the Doccia fabrique. It was unique in its  management. You know in our day how much we hear of proper factory  conditions? Doubtless you have seen mills where there are neatly  graded lawns, flower-beds, and perhaps a recreation ground. We  consider such mill-owners very progressive and speak of them with  keenest approval. Yet in our enlightened times such things are none  too common. Now it is interesting to know that this Ginori family who  founded the Doccia porcelain works were far in advance of anything we  yet have done for our employees. Not only did they have lawns and  gardens for their workmen, but they also had a park; a farm where  vegetables were raised for the common good; a school for the workmen's  children; an academy of music where all could go to concerts; and a  savings-bank in which earnings could be deposited. What do you think  of that for progressiveness?\"    The boy's eyes opened wide.    \"I guess we're not so civilized as we think we are,\" he remarked  soberly.    \"We are not the only people who ever lived--that's sure!\" retorted the  Trenton man grimly. \"As you can well imagine, the men under the  Ginori were very appreciative, and as a mark of their gratitude for  all this kindness they set to work and made for the Ginori chapel  beautiful porcelain monuments as a tribute to the dead and gone Ginori  nobles. They also made a marvelous high altar all of porcelain, with  magnificent candlesticks, fonts, and statues--a wonderful embodiment  of their skill as well as their devotion.\"    \"It must have taken some clay!\" exclaimed Theo.    \"I guess it did,\" Mr. Croyden assented. \"Aside from this work the  output of the Doccia fabrique was largely imitative. They made so many  copies of Sevres, Capo di Monte, and Majolica that it soon became a  great problem to tell the real from the imitation, and this has caused  collectors no end of trouble.\"    \"Was no other porcelain made in Italy?\"    \"Yes, as far back as 1515 pottery, as I told you, was made in Venice;  and with the discovery of kaolin Venetian merchants imported the true  clay which did not exist in Italy, and manufactured both hard and soft  paste. But the industry was never a success because the expense of  getting the material was so great. In 1753 the Germans, because of the  cheapness of Italian labor, tried making porcelain there, thinking  that they could furnish their own clays at slight cost. But the scheme  was a failure. There was, however, some imitative work done later by a  potter named Cozzi which was very good. But Italy has never excelled  in china-making as she did in the making of glass because she had not  the material to do any very extensive work. There has, to be sure,  been a scattering of porcelains turned out--some from Turin; some from  Treviso; and some from other cities. But aside from the Majolica  pottery, and Delia Robbia's terra-cottas, Italy has not made any  distinctive contribution to the china-making art. Still she has done  so much in almost every other art that she should rest content. One  cannot excel in everything.\"    \"Some of us never excel in anything,\" laughed Theo.    \"Some of us excel in falling off roofs and breaking our legs,\"  chuckled Mr. Croyden teasingly. \"And some of us excel in being very  patient about it afterward,\" he added, patting the boy's shoulder  affectionately.          [Illustration]          CHAPTER XI    OUR ENGLISH COUSINS      All too soon the time came when grips had to be packed, tackle stowed  away, and the campers start out over the carry to meet the train that  was to take them to New York. The trip was a long and tedious one of  two days' duration. Nevertheless our travelers did not find it  wearisome. On the train were papers and magazines in plenty, and  whenever Dr. Swift went into the smoking car Theo always found  Mr. Croyden near at hand and willing to talk.    \"And when Mr. Croyden is around no place could be dull or stupid,\"  affirmed Theo to his father.    \"I believe I shall begin to be"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/19424"],[0,"Bell's Cathedrals: The Cathedral Church of Exeter (#16)"],[1,"nation; less easy, unhappily, to persuade men of our own day to  deal kindly by the ancient monuments that are still left to us.    Another building that has played a notable part in the history of the  city is the #Guildhall#, of which the portico makes so pleasing an  ornament to the High Street. The building is a picturesque medley,  \"English windows and Italian pillars,\" and Professor Freeman wittily  suggests that it serves to remind us of the jumble of tongues  characterizing \"much of the law business that has been done within it.\"  The present building was built in 1464, replacing one of earlier date.  There are many pictures of local interest in the hall, and also  portraits by Sir Peter Lely of Princess Henrietta, Anne, Duchess of  Orleans, and of General Monk. The Princess was born in Exeter, and the  portrait was presented to the city by Charles II after the Restoration.  General Monk belonged to a Devonshire family whose residence was near  Torrington. There seems to have been at one time a guild or  confraternity connected with the chapel of St. George, erected over the  hall about the last year of Richard III. In the accounts are found  entries such as this: \"Principae and others for exequis and masses said  in the chapel of Guildhall for the repose of the souls for the brothers  and sisters of the fraternity of St. George.\"    When Richard III was nearing the end of his reign, the roof was  fortified by a gun placed in charge of John Croker and ten soldiers. It  is a strange coincidence that the chapel should have been built at this  time. Evidently the wise citizens were determined to protect their  interests both here and hereafter.
