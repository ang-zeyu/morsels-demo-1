I had already been warned that I should never show surprise, so I  merely expressed my sympathy, and said that though I had only been in the  capital so short a time, I had already had a very narrow escape from  stealing a clothes-brush, and that though I had resisted temptation so  far, I was sadly afraid that if I saw any object of special interest that  was neither too hot nor too heavy, I should have to put myself in the  straightener's hands.    Mrs. Nosnibor, who had been keeping an ear on all that I had been saying,  praised me when the lady had gone.  Nothing, she said, could have been  more polite according to Erewhonian etiquette.  She then explained that  to have stolen a pair of socks, or \"to have the socks\" (in more  colloquial language), was a recognised way of saying that the person in  question was slightly indisposed.    In spite of all this they have a keen sense of the enjoyment consequent  upon what they call being \"well.\"  They admire mental health and love it  in other people, and take all the pains they can (consistently with their  other duties) to secure it for themselves.  They have an extreme dislike  to marrying into what they consider unhealthy families.  They send for  the straightener at once whenever they have been guilty of anything  seriously flagitious--often even if they think that they are on the point  of committing it; and though his remedies are sometimes exceedingly  painful, involving close confinement for weeks, and in some cases the  most cruel physical tortures, I never heard of a reasonable Erewhonian  refusing to do what his straightener told him, any more than of a  reasonable Englishman refusing to undergo even the most frightful  operation, if his doctors told him it was necessary.    We in England never shrink from telling our doctor what is the matter  with us merely through the fear that he will hurt us.  We let him do his  worst upon us, and stand it without a murmur, because we are not scouted  for being ill, and because we know that the doctor is doing his best to  cure us, and that he can judge of our case better than we can; but we  should conceal all illness if we were treated as the Erewhonians are when  they have anything the matter with them; we should do the same as with  moral and intellectual diseases,--we should feign health with the most  consummate art, till we were found out, and should hate a single flogging  given in the way of mere punishment more than the amputation of a limb,  if it were kindly and courteously performed from a wish to help us out of  our difficulty, and with the full consciousness on the part of the doctor  that it was only by an accident of constitution that he was not in the  like plight himself.  So the Erewhonians take a flogging once a week, and  a diet of bread and water for two or three months together, whenever  their straightener recommends it.    I do not suppose that even my host, on having swindled a confiding widow  out of the whole of her property, was put to more actual suffering than a  man will readily undergo at the hands of an English doctor.  And yet he  must have had a very bad time of it.  The sounds I heard were sufficient  to show that his pain was exquisite, but he never shrank from undergoing  it.  He was quite sure that it did him good; and I think he was right.  I  cannot believe that that man will ever embezzle money again.  He may--but  it will be a long time before he does so.    During my confinement in prison, and on my journey, I had already  discovered a great deal of the above; but it still seemed surpassingly  strange, and I was in constant fear of committing some piece of rudeness,  through my inability to look at things from the same stand-point as my  neighbours; but after a few weeks' stay with the Nosnibors, I got to  understand things better, especially on having heard all about my host's  illness, of which he told me fully and repeatedly.    It seemed that he had been on the Stock Exchange of the city for many  years and had amassed enormous wealth, without exceeding the limits of  what was generally considered justifiable, or at any rate, permissible  dealing; but at length on several occasions he had become aware of a  desire to make money by fraudulent representations, and had actually  dealt with two or three sums in a way which had made him rather  uncomfortable.  He had unfortunately made light of it and pooh-poohed the  ailment, until circumstances eventually presented themselves which  enabled him to cheat upon a very considerable scale;--he told me what  they were, and they were about as bad as anything could be, but I need  not detail them;--he seized the opportunity, and became aware, when it  was too late, that he must be seriously out of order.  He had neglected  himself too long.    He drove home at once, broke the news to his wife and daughters as gently  as he could, and sent off for one of the most celebrated straighteners of  the kingdom to a consultation with the family practitioner, for the case  was plainly serious.  On the arrival of the straightener he told his  story, and expressed his fear that his morals must be permanently  impaired.    The eminent man reassured him with a few cheering words, and then  proceeded to make a more careful diagnosis of the case.  He inquired  concerning Mr. Nosnibor's parents--had their moral health been good?  He  was answered that there had not been anything seriously amiss with them,  but that his maternal grandfather, whom he was supposed to resemble  somewhat in person, had been a consummate scoundrel and had ended his  days in a hospital,--while a brother of his father's, after having led a  most flagitious life for many years, had been at last cured by a  philosopher of a new school, which as far as I could understand it bore  much the same relation to the old as homoeopathy to allopathy.  The  straightener shook his head at this, and laughingly replied that the cure  must have been due to nature.  After a few more questions he wrote a  prescription and departed.    I saw the prescription.  It ordered a fine to the State of double the  money embezzled; no food but bread and milk for six months, and a severe  flogging once a month for twelve.  I was surprised to see that no part of  the fine was to be paid to the poor woman whose money had been embezzled,  but on inquiry I learned that she would have been prosecuted in the  Misplaced Confidence Court, if she had not escaped its clutches by dying  shortly after she had discovered her loss.    As for Mr. Nosnibor, he had received his eleventh flogging on the day of  my arrival.  I saw him later on the same afternoon, and he was still  twinged; but there had been no escape from following out the  straightener's prescription, for the so-called sanitary laws of Erewhon  are very rigorous, and unless the straightener was satisfied that his  orders had been obeyed, the patient would have been taken to a hospital  (as the poor are), and would have been much worse off.  Such at least is  the law, but it is never necessary to enforce it.    On a subsequent occasion I was present at an interview between Mr.  Nosnibor and the family straightener, who was considered competent to  watch the completion of the cure.  I was struck with the delicacy with  which he avoided even the remotest semblance of inquiry after the  physical well-being of his patient, though there was a certain yellowness  about my host's eyes which argued a bilious habit of body.  To have taken  notice of this would have been a gross breach of professional etiquette.  I was told, however, that a straightener sometimes thinks it right to  glance at the possibility of some slight physical disorder if he finds it  important in order to assist him in his diagnosis; but the answers which  he gets are generally untrue or evasive, and he forms his own conclusions  upon the matter as well as he can.  Sensible men have been known to say  that the straightener should in strict confidence be told of every  physical ailment that is likely to bear upon the case; but people are  naturally shy of doing this, for they do not like lowering themselves in  the opinion of the straightener, and his ignorance of medical science is  supreme.  I heard of one lady, indeed, who had the hardihood to confess  that a furious outbreak of ill-humour and extravagant fancies for which  she was seeking advice was possibly the result of indisposition.  \"You  should resist that,\" said the straightener, in a kind, but grave voice;  \"we can do nothing for the bodies of our patients; such matters are  beyond our province, and I desire that I may hear no further  particulars.\"  The lady burst into tears, and promised faithfully that  she would never be unwell again.    But to return to Mr. Nosnibor.  As the afternoon wore on many carriages  drove up with callers to inquire how he had stood his flogging.  It had  been very severe, but the kind inquiries upon every side gave him great  pleasure, and he assured me that he felt almost tempted to do wrong again  by the solicitude with which his friends had treated him during his  recovery: in this I need hardly say that he was not serious.    During the remainder of my stay in the country Mr. Nosnibor was  constantly attentive to his business, and largely increased his already  great possessions; but I never heard a whisper to the effect of his  having been indisposed a second time, or made money by other than the  most strictly honourable means.  I did hear afterwards in confidence that  there had been reason to believe that his health had been not a little  affected by the straightener's treatment, but his friends did not choose  to be over-curious upon the subject, and on his return to his affairs it  was by common consent passed over as hardly criminal in one who was  otherwise so much"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/19061"],[0,"Seeing Europe with Famous Authors, Volume 8 (#16)"],[1,"been left in  order to indicate that the temple was unfinished. But the strongest  evidence of this fact is the floor. In some spots (along the sides) the  pavement is laid down; in the middle, however, the red limestone rock  still projects higher than the level of the floor as partially laid; the  flooring, therefore, can not ever have been finished. There is also no  trace of an inner temple. Still less can the temple have ever been  overlaid with stucco; but that it was intended to do so, we may infer  from the fact that the abaci of the capitals have projecting points  probably for the purpose of holding the plaster. The whole is built of a  limestone, very similar to the travertine; only it is now much fretted.  The restoration which was carried on in 1781, has done much good to the  building. The cutting of the stone, with which the parts have been  reconnected, is simple, but beautiful.    The site of the temple is singular; at the highest end of a broad and  long valley, it stands on an isolated hill. Surrounded, however, on all  sides by cliffs, it commands a very distant and extensive view of the  land, but takes in only just a corner of the sea. The district reposes  in a sort of melancholy fertility--every where well cultivated, but  scarce a dwelling to be seen. Flowering thistles were swarming with  countless butterflies, wild fennel stood here from eight to nine feet  high, dry and withered of the last year's growth, but so rich and in  such seeming order that one might almost take it to be an old  nursery-ground. A shrill wind whistled through the columns as if through  a wood, and screaming birds of prey hovered around the pediments.          TAORMINA[38]    BY JOHANN WOLFGANG VON GOETHE      When you have ascended to the top of the wall of rocks [at Taormina],  which rise precipitously at no great distance from the sea, you find two  peaks, connected by a semicircle. Whatever shape this may have had  originally from Nature has been helped by the hand of man, which has  formed out of it an amphitheater for spectators. Walls and other  buildings have furnished the necessary passages and rooms. Right across,  at the foot of the semicircular range of seats, the scene was built, and  by this means the two rocks were joined together, and a most enormous  work of nature and art combined.    Now, sitting down at the spot where formerly sat the uppermost  spectators, you confess at once that never did any audience, in any  theater, have before it such a spectacle as you there behold. On the  right, and on high rocks at the side, castles tower in the air--farther  on the city lies below you; and altho its buildings are all of modern  date, still similar ones, no doubt, stood of old on the same site. After  this the eye falls on the whole of the long ridge of AEtna, then on the  left it catches a view of the sea-shore, as far as Catania, and even  Syracuse, and then the wide and extensive view is closed by the immense  smoking volcano, but not horribly, for the atmosphere, with its  softening effect, makes it look more distinct, and milder than it  really is.    If now you turn from this view toward the passage running at the back of  the spectators, you have on the left the whole wall of the rocks between  which and the sea runs the road to Messina. And then again you behold  vast groups of rocky ridges in the sea itself, with the coast of  Calabria in the far distance, which only a fixt and attentive gaze can  distinguish from the clouds which rise rapidly from it.    We descended toward the theater, and tarried awhile among its ruins, on  which an accomplished architect would do well to employ, at least on  paper, his talent of restoration. After this I attempted to make a way  for myself through the gardens to the city. But I soon learned by  experience what an impenetrable bulwark is formed by a hedge of agaves  planted close together. You can see through their interlacing leaves,  and you think, therefore, it will be easy to force a way through them;  but the prickles on their leaves are very sensible obstacles. If you  step on these colossal leaves, in the hope that they will bear you, they  break off suddenly; and so, instead of getting out, you fall into the  arms of the next plant. When, however, at last we had wound our way out  of the labyrinth, we found but little to enjoy in the city; tho from the  neighboring country we felt it impossible to part before sunset.  Infinitely beautiful was it to observe this region, of which every point  had its interest, gradually enveloped in darkness.          MOUNT AETNA[39]    BY WILL S. MONROE      By the ancients AEtna was supposed to be the prison of the mighty chained  giant Typhon, the flames proceeding from his breath and the noises from  his groans; and when he turned over earthquakes shook the island. Many  of the myths of the Greek poets were associated with the slopes of AEtna,  such as Demeter, torch in hand, seeking Persephone, Acis and Galatea,  Polyphemus and the Cyclops.    AEtna was once a volcano in the Mediterranean and in the course of ages  it completely filled the surrounding sea with its lava. A remarkable  feature of the mountain is the large number of minor cones on its  sides--some seven hundred in all. Most of these subsidiary cones are  from three to six thousand feet in height and they make themselves most  strongly felt during periods of great activity. The summit merely serves  as a vent through which the vapors and gases make their escape. The  natural boundaries of AEtna are the Alcantara and Simeto rivers on the  north, west, and south, and the sea on the east.    The most luxurious fertility characterizes the gradual slopes near the  base, the decomposed volcanic soil being almost entirely covered with  olives, figs, grapes, and prickly pears. Higher up is the timber zone.  Formerly there was a dense forest belt between the zone of cultivated  land and the tore of cinders and snow; but the work of forest  extermination was almost completed during the reign of the Spanish  Bourbons. One may still find scattered oak, ilex, chestnut, and pine  interspersed with ferns and aromatic herbs. Chestnut trees of surprizing  growth are found on the lower slopes. \"The Chestnut Tree of the Hundred  Horses,\" for which the slopes of AEtna are famous, is not a single tree  but a group of several distinct trunks together forming a circle, under  whose spreading branches a hundred horses might find shelter.    Above the wooded zone AEtna is covered with miniature cones thrown up by  different eruptions and regions of dreary plateau covered with scoriae  and ashes and buried under snow a part of the year. While the upper  portions of the volcano are covered with snow the greater portion of the  year, AEtna does not reach the limit of perpetual snow, and the heat  which is emitted from its sides prevents the formation of glaciers in  the hollows. One might expect that the quantities of snow and rain which  fall on the summit would give rise to numerous streams. But the small  stones and cinders absorb the moisture, and springs are found only on  the lower slopes. The cinders, however, retain sufficient moisture to  support a rich vegetation wherever the surface of the lava is not too  compact to be penetrated by roots. The surface of the more recent lava  streams is not, as might be supposed, smooth and level, but full of  yawning holes and rents.    The regularity of the gradual slopes is broken on the eastern side by  the Valle del Bove, a vast amphitheater more than three thousand feet in  depth, three miles in width, and covering an area of ten square miles.  The bottom of the valley is dotted with craters which rise in gigantic  steps; and, when AEtna is in a state of eruption, these craters pour  forth fiery cascades of lava. The Monte Centenari rise from the Valle  del Bove to an elevation of 6,026 feet. At the head of the valley is the  Torre del Filosofo at an altitude of 9,570 feet. This is the reputed  site of the observatory of Empedocles, the poet and philosopher, who is  fabled to have thrown himself into the crater of AEtna to immortalize his  name.    The lower slopes of AEtna--after the basin of Palermo--include the most  densely populated parts of Sicily. More than half a million people live  on the slopes of a mountain that might be expected to inspire terror.  \"Towns succeed towns along its base like pearls in a necklace, and when  a stream of lava effects a breach in the chain of human habitations, it  is closed up again as soon as the lava has had time to cool.\" As soon as  the lava has decomposed, the soil produces an excellent yield and this  tempts the farmer and the fruit grower to take chances. Speaking of the  dual effect of AEtna, Freeman says: \"He has been mighty to destroy, but  he has also been mighty to create and render fruitful. If his fiery  streams have swept away cities and covered fields, they have given the  cities a new material for their buildings and the fields a new soil rich  above all others.\"          SYRACUSE[40]    BY RUFUS B. RICHARDSON      The ruins of Syracuse are not to the casual observer very imposing. But  even these ruins have great interest for the archeologist. There is, for  example, an old temple near the northern end of Ortygia, for the most  part embedded in the buildings of the modern city, yet with its east end  cleared and showing several entire columns with a part of the architrave  upon them. And what a surprize here awaits one who thinks of a Doric  temple as built on a stereotyped plan! Instead of the thirteen columns  on the long sides which one is apt to look for as going with a  six-column front, here are eighteen or nineteen, it is not yet quite  certain which. The columns stand less than their diameter apart, and the  abaci are so broad that they nearly touch.    So small is the inter-columnar space that archeologists incline to the  belief that in this one"]]]
