[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/22557"],[0,"Canada (#16)"],[1," We have now come to a strange chapter of  Canadian history, which has its picturesque aspect as well as its  episodes of meanness, cupidity, and inhumanity.  As we look back to  those early years of Acadian history, we see rival chiefs with their  bands of retainers engaged in deadly feuds, and storming each other's  fortified posts as though they were the castles of barons living in  mediaeval times.  We see savage Micmacs and Etchemins of Acadia, only  too willing to aid in the quarrels and contests of the white men who  hate each with a malignity that even the Indian cannot excel; closely  shorn, ill-clad mendicant friars who see only good in those who {93}  help their missions; grave and cautious Puritans trying to find their  advantage in the rivalry of their French neighbours; a Scotch nobleman  and courtier who would be a king in Acadia as well as a poet in  England; Frenchmen who claim to have noble blood in their veins, and  wish to be lords of a wide American domain; a courageous wife who lays  aside the gentleness of a woman's nature and fights as bravely as any  knight for the protection of her home and what she believes to be her  husband's rights.  These are among the figures that we see passing  through the shadowy vista which opens before us as we look into the  depths of the Acadian wilderness two centuries and a half ago.    Among the French adventurers, whose names are intimately associated  with the early history of Acadia, no one occupies a more prominent  position than Charles de St. Etienne, the son of a Huguenot, Claude de  la Tour, who claimed to be of noble birth.  The La Tours had become so  poor that they were forced, like so many other nobles of those times,  to seek their fortune in the new world.  Claude and his son, then  probably fourteen years of age, came to Port Royal with Poutrincourt in  1610.  In the various vicissitudes of the little settlement the father  and his son participated, and after it had been destroyed by Argall,  they remained with Biencourt and his companions.  In the course of  time, the elder La Tour established a trading post on the peninsula at  the mouth of the Penobscot--in Acadian history a prominent place, as  often in possession of the English as the French.    {94} Biencourt and his companions appear to have had some accessions to  their number during the years that followed the Virginian's visit.  They built rude cabins on the banks of the Annapolis, and cultivated  patches of ground after a fashion, beside raising a fort of logs and  earth near Cape Sable, called indifferently Fort Louis or Lomeron.  It  has been generally believed that Biencourt died in Acadia about 1623,  after making over all his rights to Charles La Tour, who was his  personal friend and follower from his boyhood.  Recently, however, the  discovery of some old documents in Paris throws some doubt on the  generally accepted statement of the place of his death.[1]    It is quite certain, however, whether Biencourt died in France or  Acadia, young La Tour assumed after 1623 the control of Fort St. Louis  and all other property previously held by the former.  In 1626 the  elder La Tour was driven from the Penobscot by English traders from  Plymouth who took possession of the fort and held it for some years.  He now recognised the urgent necessity of having his position in Acadia  ratified and strengthened by the French king, and consequently went on  a mission to France in 1627.    About this time the attention of prominent men in England was called to  the fact that the French had settlements in Acadia.  Sir William  Alexander, afterwards the Earl of Stirling, a favourite of King James  the Fourth of Scotland and First of England, and an author of several  poetical tragedies, wished {95} to follow the example of Sir Frederick  Gorges, one of the promoters of the colonisation of New England.  He  had no difficulty in obtaining from James, as great a pedant as  himself, a grant of Acadia, which he named Nova Scotia.  When Charles  the First became king, he renewed the patent, and also, at the  persuasion of the ambitious poet, created an order of Nova Scotia  baronets, who were obliged to assist in the settlement of the country,  which was thereafter to be divided into \"baronies.\"  Sir William  Alexander, however, did not succeed in making any settlement in Nova  Scotia, and did not take any definite measures to drive the French from  his princely, though savage, domain until about the time Claude de la  Tour was engaged in advocating the claims of his son in Europe, where  we must follow him.    The elder La Tour arrived at an opportune time in France.  Cardinal  Richelieu had just formed the Company of the Hundred Associates, and it  was agreed that aid should at once be sent to Charles de la Tour, who  was to be the King's lieutenant in Acadia.  Men and supplies for the  Acadian settlement were on board the squadron, commanded by Roquemont,  who was captured by Kirk in the summer of 1628.  On board one of the  prizes was Claude de la Tour, who was carried to London as prisoner.  Then to make the position for Charles de la Tour still more hazardous,  Sir William Alexander's son arrived at Port Royal in the same year, and  established on the Granville side a small Scotch colony as the  commencement of a larger settlement in the {96} future.  Charles de la  Tour does not appear to have remained in Port Royal, but to have  retired to the protection of his own fort at Cape Sable, which the  English did not attempt to attack at that time.    In the meantime the elder La Tour was in high favour at London.  He won  the affections of one of the Queen's maids of honour, and was easily  persuaded by Alexander and others interested in American colonisation,  to pledge his allegiance to the English king.  He and his son were made  baronets of Nova Scotia, and received large grants of land or  \"baronies\" in the new province.  As Alexander was sending an expedition  in 1630 with additional colonists and supplies for his colony in Nova  Scotia, Claude de la Tour agreed to go there for the purpose of  persuading his son to accept the honours and advantages which the King  of England had conferred upon him.  The ambitious Scotch poet, it was  clear, still hoped that his arguments in favour of retaining Acadia,  despite the treaty of Susa, made on the 24th of April, 1629, would  prevail with the King.  It was urged that as Port Royal was on soil  belonging to England by right of Cabot's discovery, and the French had  not formally claimed the sovereignty of Acadia since the destruction of  their settlement by Argall, it did not fall within the actual  provisions of a treaty which referred only to conquests made after its  ratification.    Charles de la Tour would not yield to the appeals of his father to give  up the fort at Cape Sable, and obliged the English vessels belonging to  Alexander to retire to the Scotch settlement by the Annapolis {97}  basin.  The elder La Tour went on to the same place, where he remained  until his son persuaded him to join the French at Fort St. Louis, where  the news had come that the King of France was determined on the  restoration of Port Royal as well as Quebec.  It was now decided to  build a new fort on the River St. John, which would answer the double  purpose of strengthening the French in Acadia, and driving the British  out of Port Royal.  Whilst this work was in course of construction,  another vessel arrived from France with the welcome news that the  loyalty of Charles de la Tour was appreciated by the King, who had  appointed him as his lieutenant-governor over Fort Louis, Port La Tour,  and dependencies.    By the treaty of St. Germain-en-Laye the French regained Acadia and  were inclined to pay more attention to the work of colonisation.  Richelieu sent out an expedition to take formal possession of New  France, and Isaac de Launoy de Razilly, a military man of distinction,  a Knight of Malta, and a friend of the great minister, was appointed  governor of all Acadia.  He brought with him a select colony, composed  of artisans, farmers, several Capuchin friars, and some gentlemen,  among whom were two whose names occupy a prominent place in the annals  of Acadia and Cape Breton.  One of them was Nicholas Denys, who became  in later years the first governor of Cape Breton, where he made  settlements at Saint Anne's and Saint Peter's, and also wrote an  historical and descriptive account of the French Atlantic possessions.  The most prominent {98} Frenchman after Razilly himself, was Charles de  Menou, Chevalier d'Aunay and son of Rene de Menou, lord of Charnizay,  who was of noble family, and became one of the members of the King's  council of state at the time the disputes between his son and Charles  de la Tour were at their height.  Charles de Menou, or d'Aunay, as I  shall generally name him, was made Razilly's deputy, and consequently  at the outset of his career assumed a prominence in the country that  must have deeply irritated young La Tour, who still remained one of the  King's lieutenants and probably expected, until Razilly's arrival, to  be the head of the colony.    Captain Forrester, in command of the Scotch colony at Port Royal, gave  up the post to Razilly in accordance with the orders of the English  king, who had acted with much duplicity throughout the negotiations.  The fort was razed to the ground, and the majority of the Scotch, who  had greatly suffered from disease and death, left Acadia, though  several remained and married among the French colonists.  This was the  end of Alexander's experiment in colonising Acadia and founding a  colonial _noblesse_.    Razilly made his settlement at La Heve, on the Atlantic shore of Nova  Scotia, and Denys had a mill and trading establishment in the vicinity.  Port Royal was improved and the post at Penobscot occupied.  D'Aunay  was given charge of the division west of the St. Croix,"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/22566"],[0,"Dorothy and the Wizard in Oz (#16)"],[1," fire,\"  returned the Wizard. \"But even if they succeeded in doing that it  would be very difficult for them to fly amongst these rocks; so I am  sure we need fear them no longer.\"    Once in a while they would come to a deep crack in the floor, which made  the way quite dangerous; but there was still enough oil in the lanterns  to give them light, and the cracks were not so wide but that they were  able to jump over them. Sometimes they had to climb over heaps of loose  rock, where Jim could scarcely drag the buggy. At such times Dorothy,  Zeb and the Wizard all pushed behind, and lifted the wheels over the  roughest places; so they managed, by dint of hard work, to keep going.  But the little party was both weary and discouraged when at last, on  turning a sharp corner, the wanderers found themselves in a vast cave  arching high over their heads and having a smooth, level floor.    The cave was circular in shape, and all around its edge, near to the  ground, appeared groups of dull yellow lights, two of them being always  side by side. These were motionless at first, but soon began to flicker  more brightly and to sway slowly from side to side and then up and down.    \"What sort of a place is this?\" asked the boy, trying to see more  clearly through the gloom.    \"I cannot imagine, I'm sure,\" answered the Wizard, also peering about.    \"Woogh!\" snarled Eureka, arching her back until her hair stood straight  on end; \"it's a den of alligators, or crocodiles, or some other dreadful  creatures! Don't you see their terrible eyes?\"    \"Eureka sees better in the dark than we can,\" whispered Dorothy. \"Tell  us, dear, what do the creatures look like?\" she asked, addressing her  pet.    \"I simply can't describe 'em,\" answered the kitten, shuddering. \"Their  eyes are like pie-plates and their mouths like coal-scuttles. But their  bodies don't seem very big.\"    \"Where are they?\" enquired the girl.    \"They are in little pockets all around the edge of this cavern. Oh,  Dorothy--you can't imagine what horrid things they are! They're uglier  than the Gargoyles.\"    \"Tut-tut! be careful how you criticise your neighbors,\" spoke a rasping  voice near by. \"As a matter of fact you are rather ugly-looking  creatures yourselves, and I'm sure mother has often told us we were the  loveliest and prettiest things in all the world.\"    Hearing these words our friends turned in the direction of the sound,  and the Wizard held his lanterns so that their light would flood one of  the little pockets in the rock.    \"Why, it's a dragon!\" he exclaimed.    \"No,\" answered the owner of the big yellow eyes which were blinking at  them so steadily; \"you are wrong about that. We hope to grow to be  dragons some day, but just now we're only dragonettes.\"    \"What's that?\" asked Dorothy, gazing fearfully at the great scaley head,  the yawning mouth and the big eyes.    \"Young dragons, of course; but we are not allowed to call ourselves real  dragons until we get our full growth,\" was the reply. \"The big dragons  are very proud, and don't think children amount to much; but mother says  that some day we will all be very powerful and important.\"    \"Where is your mother?\" asked the Wizard, anxiously looking around.    \"She has gone up to the top of the earth to hunt for our dinner. If she  has good luck she will bring us an elephant, or a brace of rhinoceri, or  perhaps a few dozen people to stay our hunger.\"    \"Oh; are you hungry?\" enquired Dorothy, drawing back.    \"Very,\" said the dragonette, snapping its jaws.    \"And--and--do you eat people?\"    \"To be sure, when we can get them. But they've been very scarce for a  few years and we usually have to be content with elephants or  buffaloes,\" answered the creature, in a regretful tone.    \"How old are you?\" enquired Zeb, who stared at the yellow eyes as if  fascinated.    \"Quite young, I grieve to say; and all of my brothers and sisters that  you see here are practically my own age. If I remember rightly, we were  sixty-six years old the day before yesterday.\"    \"But that isn't young!\" cried Dorothy, in amazement.    \"No?\" drawled the dragonette; \"it seems to me very babyish.\"    \"How old is your mother?\" asked the girl.    \"Mother's about two thousand years old; but she carelessly lost track of  her age a few centuries ago and skipped several hundreds. She's a little  fussy, you know, and afraid of growing old, being a widow and still in  her prime.\"    \"I should think she would be,\" agreed Dorothy. Then, after a moment's  thought, she asked: \"Are we friends or enemies? I mean, will you be good  to us, or do you intend to eat us?\"    \"As for that, we dragonettes would love to eat you, my child; but  unfortunately mother has tied all our tails around the rocks at the back  of our individual caves, so that we can not crawl out to get you. If you  choose to come nearer we will make a mouthful of you in a wink; but  unless you do you will remain quite safe.\"    There was a regretful accent in the creature's voice, and at the words  all the other dragonettes sighed dismally.    Dorothy felt relieved. Presently she asked:    \"Why did your mother tie your tails?\"    \"Oh, she is sometimes gone for several weeks on her hunting trips, and  if we were not tied we would crawl all over the mountain and fight with  each other and get into a lot of mischief. Mother usually knows what she  is about, but she made a mistake this time; for you are sure to escape  us unless you come too near, and you probably won't do that.\"    \"No, indeed!\" said the little girl. \"We don't wish to be eaten by such  awful beasts.\"    \"Permit me to say,\" returned the dragonette, \"that you are rather  impolite to call us names, knowing that we cannot resent your insults.  We consider ourselves very beautiful in appearance, for mother has told  us so, and she knows. And we are of an excellent family and have a  pedigree that I challenge any humans to equal, as it extends back about  twenty thousand years, to the time of the famous Green Dragon of  Atlantis, who lived in a time when humans had not yet been created. Can  you match that pedigree, little girl?\"    \"Well,\" said Dorothy, \"I was born on a farm in Kansas, and I guess  that's being just as 'spectable and haughty as living in a cave with  your tail tied to a rock. If it isn't I'll have to stand it, that's  all.\"    \"Tastes differ,\" murmured the dragonette, slowly drooping its scaley  eyelids over its yellow eyes, until they looked like half-moons.    Being reassured by the fact that the creatures could not crawl out of  their rock-pockets, the children and the Wizard now took time to examine  them more closely. The heads of the dragonettes were as big as barrels  and covered with hard, greenish scales that glittered brightly under the  light of the lanterns. Their front legs, which grew just back of their  heads, were also strong and big; but their bodies were smaller around  than their heads, and dwindled away in a long line until their tails  were slim as a shoe-string. Dorothy thought, if it had taken them  sixty-six years to grow to this size, that it would be fully a hundred  years more before they could hope to call themselves dragons, and that  seemed like a good while to wait to grow up.    \"It occurs to me,\" said the Wizard, \"that we ought to get out of this  place before the mother dragon comes back.\"    \"Don't hurry,\" called one of the dragonettes; \"mother will be glad to  meet you, I'm sure.\"    \"You may be right,\" replied the Wizard, \"but we're a little particular  about associating with strangers. Will you kindly tell us which way your  mother went to get on top the earth?\"    \"That is not a fair question to ask us,\" declared another dragonette.  \"For, if we told you truly, you might escape us altogether; and if we  told you an untruth we would be naughty and deserve to be punished.\"    \"Then,\" decided Dorothy, \"we must find our way out the best we can.\"    They circled all around the cavern, keeping a good distance away from  the blinking yellow eyes of the dragonettes, and presently discovered  that there were two paths leading from the wall opposite to the place  where they had entered. They selected one of these at a venture and  hurried along it as fast as they could go, for they had no idea when the  mother dragon would be back and were very anxious not to make her  acquaintance.    [Illustration]          Chapter 14.    OZMA USES THE MAGIC BELT      For a considerable distance the way led straight upward in a gentle  incline, and the wanderers made such good progress that they grew  hopeful and eager, thinking they might see sunshine at any minute. But  at length they came unexpectedly upon a huge rock that shut off the  passage and blocked them from proceeding a single step farther.    This rock was separate from the rest of the mountain and was in motion,  turning slowly around and around as if upon a pivot. When first they  came to it there was a solid wall before them; but presently it revolved  until there was exposed a wide, smooth path across it to the other side.  This appeared so unexpectedly that they were unprepared to take  advantage of it at first, and allowed the rocky wall to swing around  again before they had decided to pass over. But they knew now that there  was a means of escape and so waited patiently until the path appeared  for the second time.    The children and the Wizard rushed across the moving rock and sprang  into the passage beyond, landing safely though a little out of breath.  Jim the cab-horse came last, and the rocky wall almost caught him; for  just as he leaped to the floor of the further passage the wall swung  across it and a loose stone that the buggy wheels knocked against fell  into the narrow crack where the rock turned, and became wedged there.    They heard a crunching, grinding sound, a loud snap, and the turn-table  came to a stop with its broadest surface shutting off the path from  which they had come.    \"Nev"]]]
