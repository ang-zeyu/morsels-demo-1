Christ. vol. iii. p. 330.)    Austin Canons.    The buildings of the Austin canons or Black canons (so  called from the colour of their habit) present few distinctive  peculiarities.  This order had its first seat in England at  Colchester, where a house for Austin canons was founded about  A.D. 1105, and it very soon spread widely.  As an order  of regular clergy, holding a middle position between monks  and secular canons, almost resembling a community of parish  priests living under rule, they adopted naves of great length  to accommodate large congregations.  The choir is usually  long, and is sometimes, as at Llanthony and Christ Church  (Twynham), shut off from the aisles, or, as at Bolton, Kirkham,  &c., is destitute of aisles altogether.  The nave in the northern  houses, not unfrequently, had only a north aisle, as at Bolton,  Brinkburn and Lanercost.  The arrangement of the monastic  buildings followed the ordinary type.  The prior's lodge was  almost invariably attached to the S.W. angle of the nave.    Bristol Cathedral.    The annexed plan of the Abbey of St Augustine's at Bristol,  now the cathedral church of that city, shows the arrangement  of the buildings, which departs very little from the  ordinary Benedictine type.  The Austin canons' house at  Thornton, in Lincolnshire, is remarkable for the size  and magnificence of its gate-house, the upper floors of  which formed the guest-house of the establishment, and for  possessing an octagonal chapter-house of Decorated date.    Premonstratensians.    The Premonstratensian regular canons, or White canons, had  as many as 35 houses in England, of which the most perfect  remaining are those of Easby.  Yorkshire, and Bayham, Kent.  The head house of the order in England was Welbeck.  This order  was a reformed branch of the Austin canons, founded, A.D.  1119, by Norbert (born at Xanten, on the Lower Rhine, c.  1080) at Premontre, a secluded marshy valley in the forest  of Coucy in the diocese of Laon.  The order spread widely.  Even in the founder's lifetime it possessed houses in Syria and  Palestine.  It long maintained its rigid austerity, till in  the course of years wealth impaired its discipline, and its  members sank into indolence and luxury.  The Premonstratensians  were brought to England shortly after A.D. 1140, and were  first settled at Newhouse, in Lincolnshire, near the Humber.  The ground-plan of Easby Abbey, owing to its situation on the  edge of the steeply sloping banks of a river, is singularly  irregular.  The cloister is duly placed on the south side of the  church, and the chief buildings occupy their usual positions  round it.  But the cloister garth, as at Chichester, is not  rectangular, and all the surrounding buildings are thus made  to sprawl in a very awkward fashion.  The church follows  the plan adopted by the Austin canons in their northern  abbeys, and has only one aisle to the nave--that to the  north; while the choir is long, narrow and aisleless.  Each  transept has an aisle to the east, forming three chapels.    The church at Bayham was destitute of aisles either to nave or  choir.  The latter terminated in a three-sided apse.  This church  is remarkable for its exceeding narrowness in proportion to its  length.  Extending in longitudinal dimensions 257 ft., it is        FIG. 11.--St Augustine's Abbey, Bristol (Bristol       A. Church.            H. Kitchen.         S. Friars' lodging.   B. Great cloister.

The Carthusian order, on its establishment by St Bruno,  about A.D. 1084, developed a greatly modified form and  arrangement of a monastic institution.  The principle of this  order, which combined the coenobitic with the solitary life,  demanded the erection of buildings on a novel plan.  This  plan, which was first adopted by St Bruno and his twelve  companions at the original institution at Chartreux, near  Grenoble, was maintained in all the Carthusian establishments  throughout Europe, even after the ascetic severity of the order  had been to some extent relaxed, and the primitive simplicity  of their buildings had been exchanged for the magnificence  of decoration which characterizes such foundations as the  Certosas of Pavia and Florence.  According to the rule of  St Bruno, all the members of a Carthusian brotherhood lived  in the most absolute solitude and silence.  Each occupied a  small detached cottage, standing by itself in a small garden  surrounded by high walls and connected by a common corridor or  cloister.  In these cottages or cells a Carthusian monk  passed his time in the strictest asceticism, only leaving  his solitary dwelling to attend the services of the Church,  except on certain days when the brotherhood assembled in the  refectory.  The peculiarity of the arrangements of a Carthusian  monastery, or charter-house, as it was called in England,  from a corruption of the French chartreux, is exhibited  in the plan of that of Clermont, from Viollet-le-Duc.    Clermont.    The whole establishment is surrounded hy a wall, furnished  at intervals with watch towers (R) . The enclosure is divided  into two courts, of which the eastern court, surrounded by a  cloister, from from which the cottages of the monks (I) open,  is musch the larger.  The two courts are divided by the main  buildings of the monastery, including the church, the sanctuary  (A), divided from B, the monks' choir, by a screen with two  altars, the smaller cloister to the south (S) surrounded by  the chapter-house (E), the refectory (X)---these buildings  occupying their normal position--and the chapel of Pontgibaud  (K). The kitchen with its offices (V) lies behind the  relectory, accessible ftom the outer court without entering the  cloister.  To the north of the church, beyond the sacristy  (L), and the side chapels (M), we find the cell of the sub-prior  (a), with its garden.  The lodgings of the prior (G) occupy  the centre of the outer court, immediately in front of the  west door of the church, and face the gateway of the convent  (O). A small raised court with a fountain (C) is before  it.  This outer court also contains the guest-chambers (P),  the stables and lodgings of the lay brothers (N), the barns  and granaries (Q), the dovecot (H) and the bakehouse (T).  At Z is the prison.  In this outer court, in all the earlier  foundations, as at Witham, there was a smaller church in  addition to the larger church of the monks.) The outer and  inner courts are connected by a long passage (F), wide enough  to admit a cart laden with wood to supply the cells of the  brethren with fuel.

Honneur a Jean Baptiste!    C'est un si bon enfant!          CHAPTER V.      Penetanguishene--The Nipissang Cannibals, and a Friendly Brother in the    Wilderness.      Penetanguishene, pronounced by the Indians Pen-et-awn-gu-shene, \"the Bay  of the White Rolling Sand,\" is a magnificent harbour, about three miles  in length, narrow and land-locked completely by hills on each side. Here  is always a steam-vessel of war, of a small class, with others in  ordinary, stores and appliances, a small military force, hospital and  commissariat, an Indian interpreter, and a surgeon.    But the presents are no longer given out here, as in 1837 and  previously, to the wild tribes; so that, to see the Indian in  perfection, you must take the annual government trader, and sail to the  Grand Manitoulin Island, about a hundred miles on the northern shore of  Lake Huron, where, at Manitou-a-wanning, there is a large settlement of  Indian people, removed thither by the government to keep them from being  plundered of their presents by the Whites, who were in the habit of  giving whiskey and tobacco for their blankets, rifles, clothing, axes,  knives, and other useful articles, with which, by treaty, they are  annually supplied.    The Great Manitoulin, or Island of the Great Spirit, is an immense  island, and, being good land, it is hoped that the benevolent intentions  of the government will be successful. An Indian agent, or  superintendent, resides with them; and a steamboat, called the Goderich,  has made one or two trips to it, and up to the head of Lake Huron, last  summer.    I went to Penetanguishene with the intention of meeting this vessel and  going with her, but fear that her enterprise will be a failure. She was  chartered to run from Sturgeon Bay, about nineteen miles beyond the  narrows of Lake Simcoe, in connection with the mail or stage from  Toronto, and the Beaver steamboat, plying on Lake Simcoe.    From Sturgeon Bay she went to Penetanguishene, and then to St. Vincent  Settlement, and Owen's Sound, on Lake Huron, where a vast body of  emigrants are locating. From Owen's Sound, she coasted and doubled  Cabot's Head, and then ran down three hundred miles of the shore of Lake  Huron to Goderich, Sarnia, Fort Gratiot, Windsor, and Detroit, with an  occasional pleasure-trip to Manitoulin, St. Joseph's, and St. Mary's; so  that all the north shore of Lake Huron could be seen, and the passengers  might take a peep at Lake Superior, by going up the rapids of St. Mary  to Gros Cap. But a variety of obstacles occurred in this immense voyage,  although ultimately they will no doubt be overcome.    By starting in the Toronto stage early in the morning, the traveller  slept on board the Goderich at Sturgeon Bay, a good road having been  formed from the Narrows, although, by some strange oversight, this road  terminates in a marsh six hundred feet from the bank to the island, on  which the wharf and storehouse built for the steamer are erected. This  caused much inconvenience to the passengers.    The stage went, or goes, once a week, on Monday, to Holland Landing,  thirty six miles, meets the Beaver, which then crosses Lake Simcoe to  the Narrows, a small village, thriving very fast since it is no longer a  government Indian station, fifty miles, and there lands the travellers,  who proceed by stage to Sturgeon Bay, nineteen more, and sleep on board  the Goderich, arriving about eight p.m. The vessel gets under weigh, and  reaches Penetanguishene by six in the morning: thus the whole route from  Toronto, which takes three days by the land road, is performed in  twenty-four hours.    But there are drawbacks: the Georgian Bay, between Sturgeon Bay and  Penetanguishene, is, as I have already observed, dangerous at night, or  in a fog. At Owen's Sound, the population is not far enough advanced to  build the extensive wharf requisite, or to lay in sufficient supplies of  fuel, and thus great detention was experienced there. At  Penetanguishene, the wharf is not taken far enough into deep water for  the vessel to lie at, and thus she usually grounded in the mud, and  detention again arose. Then again, after rounding Cabot's Head and  getting into the open lake, the coast is very dangerous, having not one  harbour, until we arrive at the artificial one of Goderich, which is a  pier-harbour; for the Saugeen is a roadstead full of rocks, and cannot  be approached by a large vessel.    If, therefore, any thing happens to the machinery, and a steamer has to  trust to her sails, the westerly winds which prevail on Lake Huron and  blow tremendously, raising a sea that must be seen to be conceived of in  a fresh-water lake, she has only to keep off the shore out into the main  lake, and avoid Goderich altogether, by making for the St. Clair River.    However, the vessel did perform the voyage successfully seven times;  and in summer it may do, and, if it does do, will be of incalculable  benefit to the Huron tract, and the new settlements of the far west of  Canada.    I am, however, afraid that the railroad schemes for opening the country  to the south of this tract will for some time prevent a profitable  steamboat speculation, although vast quantities of very superior fish  are caught and cured now on the shores of Huron, such as salmon-trout  and white fish, which, when properly salted or dried, are equal to any  salt sea-fish whatever.    The Canadian French, the half-breeds, and the Indians, are chiefly  engaged in this trade, which promises to become one of great importance  to the country, and is already much encroached upon by adventurers from  the United States.    The herring, as far as I can learn, ascends the St. Lawrence no higher  than the Niagara River, but Ontario abounds with them and with salmon; a  smaller species of white fish also has of late years spread itself over  that lake, and is now sold plentifully in the Kingston market, where it  was never seen only seven years ago. It is a beautiful fish, firm and  well tasted, but rather too fat.    A farmer on the Penetanguishene road has introduced English breeds of  cattle and sheep of the best kind. He was, and perhaps still is,  contractor for the troops, and his stock is well worth seeing; he lives  a few miles from Barrie. Thus the garrison is constantly supplied with  finer meat than any other station in Canada, although more out of the  world and in the wilderness than any other; and, as fish is plentiful,  the soldiers and sailors of Queen Victoria in the Bay of the White  Rolling Sand live well.    I was agreeably surprised to find at this remote post that only one  soldier drank anything stronger than beer or water; and of course very  little of the former, owing to the expense of transport, was to be had.  The soldier that did drink spirits did not drink to excess.    How did all this happen in a place where drunkenness had been  proverbial? The soldiers, who were of the 82nd regiment, had been  selected for the station as married men. Their young commanding officer  patronized gardening, cricketing, boating, and every manly amusement,  but permitted no gambling. He formed a school for the soldiers and their  families, and, in short, he knew how to manage them, and to keep their  minds engaged; for they worked and played, read and reasoned; and so  whiskey, which is as cheap as dirt there, was not a temptation which  they could not resist. In winter, he had sleighing, snowshoeing, and  every exercise compatible with the severe weather and the very deep snow  incident to the station.    I feel persuaded that, now government has provided such handsome  garrison libraries of choice and well selected books for the soldiers,  if a ball alley, or racket court, and a cricket ground were attached to  every large barrack, there would not only be less drinking in the army,  but that vice would ultimately be scorned, as it has been within the  last twenty years by the officers. A hard-drinking officer will scarcely  be tolerated in a regiment now, simply because excessive drinking is a  low, mean vice, being the indulgence of self for unworthy motives, and  beneath the character of a gentleman. To be brought to a court-martial  for drunkenness is now as disgraceful and injurious to the reputation of  an officer as it was to be tried for cowardice, and therefore seldom  occurs in the British army.    The vice of Canada is, however, drink; and Temperance Societies will not  mend it. Their good is very equivocal, unless combined with religion, as  there is only one Father Matthew in the world, nor is it probable that  there will be another.    Penetanguishene is at present the _ultima Thule_ of the British military  posts in North America. It borders on the great wilderness of the North,  and on that backbone of primary rocks running from the Alleghanies,  across the thousand islands of the St. Lawrence, to the unknown  interior of the northern verge of Lake Superior.    Penetanguishene will not, however, be long the _ultima Thule_ of British  military posts in Western Canada, as a large and most important  settlement is making at Owen's Sound, on Lake Huron, connected by a long  road through the wilderness with Saugeen river, another settlement on  the shores of that lake, to prevent the necessity of the difficult  water-passage round Cabot's Head; and a steamboat has been put on the  route by the Canada Company, to connect Saugeen with Goderich.    The government, up to the 31st of December, 1845, had sold or granted  54,056 acres of land at Owen's Sound, of which 1,168 acres had been  chopped or cleared of the"]]]
