All iron clamps need blocks of soft wood  to be placed between them and the finished work.    _Pinch-dogs_, Fig. 178, are a convenient device for drawing together  two pieces of wood, when injury to the surfaces in which they are  driven does not matter. They vary in size from 3/4\" to 2-3/4\". For  ordinary purposes the smallest size is sufficient. For especially fine  work, double-pointed tacks, properly filed, are convenient.    The _bench-hook_, Fig. 179, is a simple device for holding firmly  small pieces of work when they are being sawn, chisled, etc. It also  saves the bench from being marred. The angles should be kept exactly  square.    [Illustration: Fig. 175. Using a Handscrew to hold a Board at an  Angle.]    The _miter-box_, Fig. 180, is a similar device with the addition of  a guide for the saw. The _iron miter-box_, Fig. 181, with the saw  adjustable to various angles, insures accurate work.    Such tools as _pliers_, Fig. 182, _pincers_, Fig. 183, and _nippers_,  Fig. 184, made for gripping iron, are often useful in the woodworking  shop. So are various sorts of _wrenches_; as fixed, socketed,  adjustable, monkey- and pipe-wrenches.    [Illustration: Fig. 176. Steel-Bar Carpenter's Clamp. a. Steel Bar. b.  Frame. c. Tip. d. Screw. e. Crank. f. Slide. g. Dog.]    [Illustration: Fig. 177. Iron Handscrew, (Carriage-Maker's Clamp).]    [Illustration: Fig. 178. Pinch-Dog.]    B. _Tools for holding other tools._    The _brace_ or _bit-stock_, Fig. 185, holds all sorts of boring tools  as well as screwdrivers, dowel-pointers, etc. The simple brace or  bit-stock consists of a chuck, a handle, and a knob, and is sufficient  for ordinary use; but the ratchet-brace enables the user to bore near  to surfaces or corners where a complete sweep cannot be made. It is  also useful where sufficient power can be applied only at one part of  the sweep. By means of pawls which engage in the ratchet-wheel, the  bit can be turned in either direction at the will of the user. The  size of the brace is indicated by the \"sweep,\" that is, the diameter  of the circle thru which the swinging handle turns. To insert a bit  or other tool, Fig. 186, grasp firmly with one hand the sleeve of the  chuck pointing it upward, and revolve the handle with the other hand,  unscrewing the sleeve until the jaws open enough to admit the whole  tang of the bit. Then reverse the motion and the bit will be held  tightly in place. Various hand-, breast-, bench-, bow-drills and  automatic drills are of use in doing quick work and for boring small  holes, Fig. 187.    [Illustration: Fig. 179. Bench-Hook.]    [Illustration: Fig. 180. Miter-Box.]    [Illustration: Fig. 181. Iron Miter-Box.]    The _screwdriver_, Fig. 188, is a sort of holding tool for turning,  and so driving screws. Various devices have been tried to prevent the  twisting in the handle. This is now practically assured in various  makes. The other important matter in a screwdriver is that the point  be of the right temper, so as neither to bend nor to break. If the  corners break they can be reground, but care should be taken not to  make the angle too obtuse or the driver will slip out of the slot in  the screw-head. The bevel should have a long taper. A shop should be  equipped with different sizes of screwdrivers to fit the different  sizes of screws. Screwdrivers vary in size, the shank ranging in  length from 2-1/2\" to 18\". A long screwdriver is more powerful than a  short one, for the screwdriver is rarely exactly in line with the  axis of the screw, but the handle revolves in a circle. This means an  increased leverage, so that the longer the screwdriver, the greater  the leverage.    [Illustration: Fig. 182. Pliers.]    [Illustration: Fig. 183. Pincers.]    [Illustration: Fig. 184. Nippers.]    [Illustration: Fig. 185. Ratchet-Brace.]    For heavy work, screwdriver-bits, Fig. 189, in a bit-stock are useful,  and for quick work, the spiral screwdriver, Fig. 190, and for small  work, the ratchet-screwdriver.      7. MEASURING AND MARKING TOOLS.    It is a long step from the time when one inch meant the width of the  thumb, and one foot meant the length of the foot, to the measuring  of distances and of angles which vary almost infinitesimally. No such  accuracy is necessary in measuring wood as in measuring metal, but  still there is a considerable variety of tools for this purpose.    [Illustration: Fig. 186. Inserting a Bit in Stock.]    [Illustration: Fig. 187. Hand-Drill.]    [Illustration: Fig. 188. Screwdriver.]    [Illustration: Fig. 189. Screwdriver-Bit.]    [Illustration: Fig. 190. Spiral Screwdriver.]    For measuring distances, the _rule_, Fig. 191, is the one in most  common use. It is usually made of boxwood. For convenience it is  hinged so as to fold. A rule is called \"two-fold\" when it is made of  two pieces, \"four-fold\" when made of four pieces, etc. When measuring  or marking from it, it can be used more accurately by turning it on  edge, so that the lines of the graduations may come directly against  the work. The one in most common use in school shops, is a two-foot,  two-fold rule. Some instructors prefer to have pupils use a four-fold  rule, because that is the form commonly used in the woodworking  trades. Steel bench-rules, Fig. 192, are satisfactory in school work  because unbreakable and because they do not disappear so rapidly as  pocket rules. They need to be burnished occasionally.    [Illustration: Fig. 191. Two-Foot Rule. Two Fold.]    [Illustration: Fig. 192. Steel Bench-Rule.]    [Illustration: Fig. 193. Back of Steel Square, Brace Measure.]    The _steel square_, Figs. 193, 194, 196, 197, is useful, not only as a  straight-edge and try-square, but also for a number of graduations and  tables which are stamped on it. There are various forms, but the  one in most common use consists of a blade or \"body\" 24\"x2\" and a  \"tongue,\" 16\"x1-1/2\", at right angles to each other. Sargent's trade  number for this form is 100. It includes graduations in hundredths,  thirty-seconds, sixteenths, twelfths, tenths, and eighths of an  inch, also a brace-measure, an eight-square measure, and the Essex  board-measure. Another style, instead of an Essex board-measure, and  the hundredths graduation has a rafter-table. The side upon which the  name of the maker is stamped, is called the \"face,\" and the reverse  side the \"back.\"    The brace-measure is to be found along the center of the back of the  tongue, Fig. 193. It is used thus: the two equal numbers set one above  the other represent the sides of a square, and the single number to  their right, represents in inches and decimals, the diagonal of that  square. E. g., 54/54 76.37 means that a square the sides of which are  54\" would have a diagonal of 76.37\".    For determining the length of the long side (hypothenuse) of a right  angle triangle, when the other two given sides are not equal, the foot  rule, or another steel square may be laid diagonally across the blade  and arm, and applied directly to the proper graduations thereon, and  the distance between them measured on the rule. If the distance to  be measured is in feet, use the 1/12\" graduations on the back of the  square.    [Illustration: Fig. 194. Face of Steel Square, Octagon,  \"Eight-Square,\" Scale.]    To use the octagonal (or 8-square) scale, Fig. 194, which is along the  center of the face of the tongue, with the dividers, take the number  of spaces in the scale to correspond with the number of inches the  piece of wood is square, and lay this distance off from the center  point, on each edge of the board. Connect the points thus obtained,  diagonally across the corners, and a nearly exact octagon will be had.  E.g., on a board 12\" square, Fig. 195, find A.B.C.D., the centers  of each edge. Now with the dividers take 12 spaces from the 8-square  scale. Lay off this distance on each side as A' A\" from A, B' B\" from  B, etc. Now connect A\" with B', B\" with C', C\" with D', D\" with A',  and the octagon is obtained.    [Illustration: Fig. 195. Method of Using the Eight-Square Scale on the  Steel-Square.]    In making a square piece of timber octagonal, the same method is used  on the butt, sawed true. When the distance from one center is laid  off, the marking-gage may be set to the distance from the point thus  obtained to the corner of the timber, and the piece gaged from all  four corners both ways. Cutting off the outside arrises to the gaged  lines leaves an octagonal stick.    [Illustration: Fig. 196. Back of Steel Square, Essex Board Measure.]    The board-measure is stamped on the back of the blade of the square,  Fig. 196. The figure 12 on the outer edge of the blade is the starting  point for all calculations. It represents a 1\" board, 12\" wide, and  the smaller figures under it indicate the length of boards in feet.  Thus a board 12\" wide, and 8' long measures 8 square feet and so on  down the column. To use it, for boards other than 12\" wide:--find the  length of the board in feet, under the 12\" marked on the outer edge of  the blade, then run right or left along that line to the width of  the board in inches. The number under the width in inches on the line  showing the length in feet, gives the board feet for lumber 1\" thick.    For example, to measure a board 14' long, and 11\" wide,--under the  figure 12, find 14 (length of the board); to the left of this, under  11 is the number 12.10; 12' 10\" is the board-measure of the board in  question. Since a board 12' long would have as many board feet in it  as it is inches wide, the B. M. is omitted for 12' boards. Likewise  a board 6' long would have 1/2 the number of board feet that it is  inches wide. If the board is shorter than the lowest figure given  (8) it can be found by dividing its double by 2.; e. g., to measure  a board 5' long and 9\" wide, take 10 under the 12, run to the left of  the number under 9, which is 7' 6\": 1/2 of"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/20847"],[0,"India: What can it teach us?

The following five untruths are enumerated by various  writers as not constituting mortal sins--namely, at the time of  marriage, during dalliance, when life is in danger, when the loss of  property is threatened, and for the sake of a Brahma_n_a. Again,  another writer cites the declaration that an untruth is venial if it  is spoken at the time of marriage, during dalliance, in jest, or while  suffering great pain. It is evident that Venus laughed at lovers'  oaths in India as well as elsewhere; and that false testimony  extracted by torture was excused. Manu declared that in some cases the  giver of false evidence from a pious motive would not lose his seat in  heaven; indeed, that whenever the death of a man of any of the four  castes would be occasioned by true evidence, falsehood was even better  than truth. He gives as the primeval rule, to say what is true and  what is pleasant, but not what is true and unpleasant, or what is  pleasant and not true.

HUMAN INTEREST OF SANSKRIT LITERATURE.      My first lecture was intended to remove the prejudice that India is  and always must be a strange country to us, and that those who have to  live there will find themselves stranded, and far away from that  living stream of thoughts and interests which carries us along in  England and in other countries of Europe.    My second lecture was directed against another prejudice, namely, that  the people of India with whom the young civil servants will have to  pass the best years of their life are a race so depraved morally, and  more particularly so devoid of any regard for truth, that they _must_  always remain strangers to us, and that any real fellowship or  friendship with them is quite out of the question.    To-day I shall have to grapple with a third prejudice, namely, that  the literature of India, and more especially the classical Sanskrit  literature, whatever may be its interest to the scholar and the  antiquarian, has little to teach us which we cannot learn better from  other sources, and that at all events it is of little practical use to  young civilians. If only they learn to express themselves in  Hindustani or Tamil, that is considered quite enough; nay, as they  have to deal with men and with the ordinary affairs of life, and as,  before everything else, they are to be men of the world and men of  business, it is even supposed to be dangerous, if they allowed  themselves to become absorbed in questions of abstruse scholarship or  in researches on ancient religion, mythology, and philosophy.    I take the very opposite opinion, and I should advise every young man  who wishes to enjoy his life in India, and to spend his years there  with profit to himself and to others, to learn Sanskrit, and to learn  it well.    I know it will be said, What can be the use of Sanskrit at the present  day? Is not Sanskrit a dead language? And are not the Hindus  themselves ashamed of their ancient literature? Do they not learn  English, and do they not prefer Locke, and Hume, and Mill to their  ancient poets and philosophers?    No doubt Sanskrit, in one sense, is a dead language. It was, I  believe, a dead language more than two thousand years ago. Buddha,  about 500 B.C., commanded his disciples to preach in the dialects of  the people; and King A_s_oka, in the third century B.C., when he put  up his Edicts, which were intended to be read, or at least to be  understood by the people, had them engraved on rocks and pillars in  the various local dialects from Cabul[89] in the north to Ballabhi in  the south, from the sources of the Ganges and the Jumnah to Allahabad  and Patna, nay even down to Orissa. These various dialects are as  different from Sanskrit as Italian is from Latin, and we have  therefore good reason to suppose that, in the third century B.C., if  not earlier, Sanskrit had ceased to be the spoken language of the  people at large.    There is an interesting passage in the _K_ullavagga, where we are told  that, even during Buddha's lifetime, some of his pupils, who were  Brahmans by birth, complained that people spoiled the words of Buddha  by every one repeating them in his own dialect (nirutti). They  proposed to translate his words into Sanskrit; but he declined, and  commanded that each man should learn his doctrine in his own  language.[90]    And there is another passage, quoted by Hardy in his Manual of  Buddhism, p. 186, where we read that at the time of Buddha's first  preaching each of the countless listeners thought that the sage was  looking toward him, and was speaking to him in his own tongue, though  the language used was Magadhi.[91]    Sanskrit, therefore, as a language spoken by the people at large, had  ceased to exist in the third century B.C.    Yet such is the marvellous continuity between the past and the present  in India, that in spite of repeated social convulsions, religious  reforms, and foreign invasions, Sanskrit may be said to be still the  only language that is spoken over the whole extent of that vast  country.    Though the Buddhist sovereigns published their edicts in the"]]]
