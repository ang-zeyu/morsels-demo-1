When finished the corral averaged about forty paces in  diameter, and the fence was about eight feet high, with an opening left  in the east about ten feet wide.    125. The moment the dark circle of branches was finished it inclosed  sacred ground. Any dog who dared to enter was chased out with shouts and  missiles. The man or woman who came must, on the first occasion, pass  around to the left, i.e., to the south of the great woodpile. No one  was allowed to peep through the fence or look over the edge of if to  witness the ceremonies. That part of the auditorium was reserved for the  spirits of the bears and other ancestral animal gods. No horse might be  led into the inclosure until after sunrise next morning, when the fence  was razed and all became common soil once more.    126. When the night began to fall many of the visitors moved all their  goods into the corral and lighted there a number of small fires close to  the fence, temporarily abandoning their huts and shelters outside. Those  who did not move in left watchers to protect their property; for there  are thieves among the Navajo. The woods around the corral were lighted  up in various directions by the fires of those who had not taken their  property into the great inclosure and of parties who were practicing  dances and shows of an exoteric character.    127. The nocturnal performances of _this_ evening (Tuesday, October 28,  1884) were as meager as any I have seen within the dark circle of  branches. The best show I ever witnessed in the circle was one which  took place at Keam's CaÃ±on, Arizona, on the 5th of November, 1882. For  this reason I will make the notes taken on the latter occasion the basis  of my description of the \"corral dance,\" adding as I proceed such  comments as may be justified by subsequent observation and information.    128. At 8 o'clock a band of musicians which I will call the orchestra  entered, sat down beside one of the small fires in the west, and began  to make various vocal and instrumental noises of a musical character,  which continued with scarcely any interruption until the close of the  dance in the morning. At the moment the music began the great central  fire was lighted, and the conflagration spread so rapidly through the  entire pile that in a few moments it was enveloped in great flames.  A storm of sparks flew upward to the height of a hundred feet or more,  and the descending ashes fell in the corral like a light shower of snow.  The heat was soon so intense that in the remotest parts of the inclosure  it was necessary for one to screen his face when he looked towards the  fire. And now all was ready to test the endurance of the dancers who  must expose, or seem to expose (paragraph 149), their naked breasts to  the torrid glow.      [Illustration:    Bureau of Ethnology    Fifth Annual Report Pl. XII    DANCE OF NAHIKÃÃ.]    129. _First dance_ (Plate XII). When the fire gave out its most intense  heat, a warning whistle was heard in the outer darkness, and a dozen  forms, lithe and lean, dressed only in the narrow white breechcloth and  moccasins, and daubed with white earth until they seemed a group of  living marbles, came bounding through the entrance, yelping like wolves  and slowly moving around the fire. As they advanced in single file they  threw their bodies into divers attitudes--some graceful, some strained  and difficult, some menacing. Now they faced the east, now the south,  the west, the north, bearing aloft their slender wands tipped with eagle  down, holding and waving them with surprising effects. Their course  around the fire was to the left, i.e., from the east to the west, by  way of the south, and back again to the east by way of the north,  a course taken by all the dancers of the night, the order never being  reversed. When they had encircled the fire twice they began to thrust  their wands toward it, and it soon became evident that their object was  to burn off the tips of eagle down; but owing to the intensity of the  heat it was difficult to accomplish this, or at least they acted well  the part of striving against such difficulty. One would dash wildly  towards the fire and retreat; another would lie as close to the ground  as a frightened lizard and endeavor to wriggle himself up to the fire;  others sought to catch on their wands the sparks flying in the air. One  approached the flaming mass, suddenly threw himself on his back with his  head to the fire, and swiftly thrust his wand into the flames. Many were  the unsuccessful attempts; but, at length, one by one, they all  succeeded in burning the downy balls from the ends of their wands. As  each accomplished this feat it became his next duty to restore the ball  of down. The mechanism of this trick has been described (paragraph 120),  but the dancer feigned to produce the wonderful result by merely waving  his wand up and down as he continued to run around the fire. When he  succeeded he held his wand up in triumph, yelped, and rushed out of the  corral. The last man pretended to have great difficulty in restoring the  down. When at last he gave his triumphant yell and departed it was ten  minutes to 9. The dance had lasted twenty minutes.    130. In other repetitions of this ceremony the writer has witnessed more  of burlesque than on this occasion. Sometimes the performers have worn  immense false mustaches, exaggerated imitations of spectacles and of  other belongings of their white neighbors. Sometimes the dance has  assumed a character which will not be described in this place  (paragraph 146). It is called nahikÃ Ã¯-alil. The former word signifies  \"it becomes white again\" and refers to the reappearance of the eagle  down. The show is said to have been introduced among the Navajo at the  great corral dance mentioned in the myth (paragraphs 69-72) by a tribe  from the south named Â¢ildjÃ¨he. It is no essential part of the rites of  the dark circle, yet I have never known it to be omitted, probably  because it is a most suitable dance for the time when the fire is the  hottest.      [Illustration: FIG. 54. Dancer holding up the great plumed arrow.]      [Illustration: FIG. 55. Dancer \"swallowing\" the great plumed arrow.]    131. _Second dance._ After an interval of three-quarters of an hour, the  dance of the kÃ¡tso-yisÃ§Ã n, the great plumed arrow, the potent healing  ceremony of the night, began. There were but two performers. They were  dressed and arrayed much like the akÃ¡ninili, but they bore no meal bags,  wore no beaver collars, and the parts of their bodies that were not  painted black--legs and forearms--were daubed with white earth. Instead  of the wand of the akÃ¡ninili, each bore in his hand one of the great  plumed arrows. While they were making the usual circuits around the  fire, the patient (a man on this occasion) was placed sitting on a  buffalo robe in front of the orchestra. They halted before the patient;  each dancer seized his arrow between his thumb and forefinger about  eight inches from the tip, held the arrow up to view, giving a  coyote-like yelp, as if to say, \"So far will I swallow it\" (Fig. 54),  and then appeared to thrust the arrow, slowly and painfully, down his  throat (Fig. 55) as far as indicated. While the arrows seemed still to  be stuck in their throats, they danced a chassÃ©, right and left, with  short, shuffling steps. Then they withdrew the arrows, and held them up  to view as before, with triumphant yelps, as if to say, \"So far have I  swallowed it.\" Sympathizers in the audience yelped in response. The next  thing to be done was to apply the arrows. One of the dancers advanced to  the patient, and to the soles of the feet of the latter he pressed the  magic weapon with its point to the right, and again with its point to  the left. In a similar manner he treated the knees, hands, abdomen,  back, shoulders, crown, and mouth in the order named, giving three  coyote-like yelps after each application. When the first dancer had  completed the work, the other took his place and went through exactly  the same performance. This finished, the sick man and the buffalo robe  were removed. The bearers of the arrows danced once more around the fire  and departed.    132. The plumed arrow is frequently referred to in the songs of this  rite. It seems to be the most revered implement and the act in which it  appears the most revered alili of the night. All the other shows may be  omitted at will, but the dance of the kÃ¡tso-yisÃ§Ã n, it is said, must  never be neglected. I have witnessed other performances where the arrow  swallowers reappeared with their numbers increased to six or eight. The  additional dancers all pretended to swallow arrows, but they did not  apply them to the patient. The origin of this alili is well accounted  for in the myth (paragraphs 47, 55, and 69), and the peculiar  significance of the injunction not to break the arrow is easily  understood when we know how the arrow is made.    133. _Third dance._ At 10 o'clock the sound of the whistle again called  the spectators to attention and a line of twenty-three dancers came in  sight. The one who led the procession bore in his hand a whizzer  (Fig. 56) such as schoolboys use, a stick tied to the end of a string;  this he constantly whirled, producing a sound like that of a rain storm.  After him came one who represented a character, the YÃ©baka (anglicized,  Yaybaka), from the great nine days' ceremony of the klÃ©dji-qaÃ§Ã l, or  night chant, and lie wore a blue buckskin mask that belongs to the  character referred to. From time to time he gave the peculiar hoot or  call of the YÃ ybichy, \"hu`hu`hu`hu\" (paragraph 32). After him followed  eight wand bearers. They were dressed like the bearers of the great  plumed arrows; but instead of an arrow each bore a wand made of grass,  cactus, and eagle plumes.

Books--\" He held up the volume  he was still fingering. \"Where'd these come from anyway, Kirby?\"    Drew retailed the story he had heard from Stein. Nye walked over to look  at the display of reading matter, his interest plainly aroused.    \"Lutterfield brought 'em in, eh? Now that's somethin'. Trunk in a cave ...  Sounds like these might belong to one of them mine men--a super, maybe.  They pulled out fast in '61, right after th' army left. Except for Hodges,  an' th' Rebs threw him in jail after they took his business an' what cash  he had on hand.\"    \"Could be,\" Topham agreed. \"But where they came from doesn't matter as  much as why Helms chose to use them the way he did. However--and now I'm  giving it to you straight, Kirby--this is once I'd follow Bayliss' orders.  You and your cousin here had better make yourselves scarce.\"    \"An' jus' why?\" Anse demanded. \"We ain't givin' you any double-tongue wag  over this----\"    \"I'm not saying you are. I'm just saying that Bayliss and probably  Helms--maybe others--will be waiting, just as the captain promised. You can  be easily suckered into just such another fight. And they'd be smarter  about it next time, so you won't have anyone to call their bluff in your  favor. Once they get you into the camp stockade, it might be difficult to  get you out. And this is something else, stranger, you went for your gun a  few minutes ago. Kirby stopped you, but next time that could lead to real  trouble.\"    \"I can't see why--\" Drew began.    \"Well\"--Anse was on the defensive--\"a man can take jus' so much pushin', an'  we had more'n that! Next time anybody lays his dirty hands on me, he's  gonna know he's had him trouble, all right!\"    \"I don't mean that.\" Drew waved Anse's retort aside. \"I don't see why we  were jumped in the first place. Unless it was because we happened to be  here at a time when they wanted to start trouble?\" He made that into a  question and looked to Topham for the answer.    \"Could be,\" the gambler admitted.    \"Only you're not sure?\" Drew persisted.    \"Could be you were handy and they had some kind of a hint to start a  ruckus just to show there ain't any proper law here. Could be that they  knew you ride for Hunt and that made you just the game they wanted.\"    \"Helms's kinda dumb to play any cute game,\" Nye protested. \"An' th' sarge,  he's always been a good guy, I don't see him bitin' happy on any such  backhand orders.\"    \"Not orders, no. Captain Bayliss is still too army to give any such  orders. Helms's always been a troublemaker; he wouldn't need much more  than a suggestion or two of the right sort. Helms, Stevens, Danny Birke,  and that kid Mitchell. You're right so far, Nye.\" Topham grinned. \"Like as  not, I'm imaginin' things--a greenhorn huntin' Apaches behind every bush.  None of that crew has the brains to see anything beyond the tip of his  nose. No, I guess we can take it that you were handy and they had too much  red-eye on empty stomachs. Only, I mean it, Kirby, you walk soft and get  back to the Range as quick as you can.\"    \"That suits me,\" Drew agreed.    \"Come on over an' let Doc take a look at that face of yours,\" Nye ordered.  \"You look like you came up behind a mule an' the critter did a mite of  dancin' backwards! You come 'long, too,\" he extended the invitation to  include Anse.        His face patched up after a fashion, Drew lay full length on the hay in  his old place over Shadow's stall back at Kells' stable. Anse sat  crosslegged beside him, the bruise now a black shadow on his jaw.    \"Somethin' 'bout this show's bad, plain as a black saddle on a white hoss.  Nobody could be fannin' a six-gun for you personal, Drew, 'less you had a  run-in before with one of them Blue Bellies.\" The Texan paused and Drew  shook his head, wincing at the pain from his numerous cuts and bruises.    Anse went on. \"Some hombres are always on th' peck once they get likkered  up, but them troopers weren't that deep. Looks to me now, thinkin' it  over, they was out to make sod fly. Could be as they had trouble with some  other riders an' we was handy an' looked peaceable enough to take easy.  But I dunno. You know, a fella who's scouted an' hunted Injuns an' popped  bush cattle, to say nothin' of toppin' wild ones what can look like a nice  quiet little pony one minute an' have a belly full of bedsprings an' a sky  touchin' back th' next--a fella who's had him all that kinda experience an'  a saddlebag full of surprises in his time gits so he can smell a storm  comin' 'fore th' first cloud shows. If we had the sense we shoulda been  born with, we'd ride hell-to-thunder outta here now!\"    \"Anse\"--Drew wriggled up on one elbow--\"you do that. I ain't going to pull  you into anything--\"    \"So,\" the Texan said, nodding, \"you've been swallowin' down a whim-wham or  two your ownself?\"    \"Yes, but every one of them could be only a shadow to scare a jackrabbit.\"    \"Only you plan to go out an' spit in th' shadow's eye?\"    \"Guess so.\"    \"Then there'll be two of us. Providin' Rennie can use him 'nother hand.  You know, this might be interestin'. 'Member what they used to say in the  army? Don't go borrowin' trouble nor try to cross a river till you git th'  water lappin' at your boots.\"            9      \"Times is gittin' better.\" Crow Fenner rode with one knee cocked up over  the horn of his saddle, allowing Tar to drop into a pace at which he  seemed to be actually sleep-walking. The wagon train was traveling slow,  the wagons riding heavy in the ruts with their burden of northern goods  heading south. But they were strung in good order and Drew, having seen  the screen of outriders and Pima Scouts, thought that though they offered  temptation, they were not to be easily taken by anything less than a small  troop, very well armed and reckless.    \"Yes, siree, this here's th' second time we made th' trip through without  havin' to burn up a sight of gunpowder! Guess them army boys millin'  around back an' forth across th' territory do some good, after all. Pretty  soon there won't be no need for wearin' guns loose an' tryin' to grow eyes  in th' back of yore skull!\" But Fenner's own rifle still rode on guard  across his knees, and Drew noted that the scout never broke a searching  survey of the countryside.    \"Gittin' downright civilized, eh?\" Anse brought his mount up equal with  the other two.    Fenner spat. \"Now that thar I ain't cottonin' to none. Ride 'long without  some Injun or _bandido_ poppin' lead at m'back. Yep, that's what a man kin  enjoy. But I ain't takin' to have maybe one o' them thar engine trains  snortin' out dirty smoke an' sparks hereabouts. Took me a ride on one of  them things onct--never agin! Why a man wants to git hisself all stuck up  with cinders an' cover territory faster than th' Good Lord ever intended  him to travel--that's some stupid thinkin' I can't take to. A good hoss,  maybe a wagon, does a man want to do some tradin' like _Don_ Cazar--that's  right enough. But them trains, they's pure pizen an' a full soppin' keg o'  it!\"    Drew looked about him. The road, rutted deep by the heavy wagons, curled  southward. Those wheel tracks had first been cut almost a hundred years  earlier when the Spaniards had set up their southwestern outposts. This  country was far older than Kentucky, and with just as bloody a history of  wars, raids, and battles. Kentucky had been tamed; trains did puff along  through the Blue Grass and the mountains there. But here--he shook his head  in answer to his own thoughts.    \"Ain't nobody gonna try to run a railroad through here,\" Anse replied  promptly. \"First place, they're gonna be busy for a while back east  puttin' up new ones for all them what were busted up in th' war. Our boys  an' theirs, too, got real expert toward th' end--could heat up a rail an'  tie a regular noose in it, were some tree handy to rope it 'round. Gonna  take th' Yankees some doin' to git all them back into place.\" He laughed.  \"Drew, 'member that time we took them river steamers an' had us a real  feed? Times when I was in that Yankee stockade eatin' th' swill they  called rations I used to dream 'bout them pickles an' canned peaches an'  crackers with long sweetin' poured on 'em!\"    \"Heard tell as you boys don't think th' war's clear over yet,\" Fenner  observed. \"Didn't you have yoreselves a ruckus with th' soldiers at th'  Four Jacks?\"    Drew's reminiscent smile faded. But he was not going to keep on protesting  about the right or wrong of what happened back in town. The way Nye and  Topham had hustled Anse and him out with the wagon train had made it seem  as if they were in disgrace, and that rankled a lot. What was expected of  them--that they should have let Helms pour it on--maybe serve as butts for a  series of practical jokes without raising a finger in their own defense?  On the other hand, the Kentuckian could see the sense behind Topham's  arguments. If Bayliss wanted to use Drew's connection with the Range as a  weapon in some scheme against Hunt Rennie, then Hunt Rennie's son was only  too willing to clear out. Perhaps he should clear out even farther and  head for California. Drew began to think about that. There was Sage. She  couldn't hope to make such a trip for maybe six months. That would mean  putting off traveling until next spring or early summer. But six months  ... Of course, he _could_ go now. _Don_ Cazar would buy the foal and  Shadow, too, and give him a fair price. That would be relinquishing a  dream. No Spur R brand would ever be established here in Arizona. But  sometimes dreams were priced too high....    \"You're mighty grim-mouthed,\" Anse commented, glancing at Drew sideways.  \"Thinkin' of trains runnin' through here git you down that far? Or else  that roughenin' up you took in town still sit sour on your stomach?\"    \"Sits sour all right,\" Drew admitted. \"Sits sourer to think we were  suckered into it.\"    The scout"]]]
