DUMPLING. And we don't like to have you leave us, either. My, this has  been the grandest Christmas day I've ever seen.    MOTHER. Come, Grandma. (_Exits L. with_ GRANDMA.)    GRANDPA. Come, children. (_They gather around him._) I'm glad you've  had such a happy Christmas. You got everything you wanted, didn't you?    TOOTSY. Yes, everything. My, I wish Christmas would come every day.    DUMPLING. Tell us the story about old Saint Nick, Grandpa.    GRANDPA. Do you want to hear that old chestnut again?    CHILDREN. Oh, yes, yes!    GRANDPA (_takes_ SNOOKUMS _on his lap, the other children stand by his  knee._)         'Twas the night before Christmas, when all through the house       Not a creature was stirring, not even a mouse;       The stockings were hung by the chimney with care,       In hopes that Saint Nicholas soon would be there.       The children were nestled all snug in their beds,       While visions of sugar-plums danced through their heads;       Grandma in her kerchief and I in my cap,       Had just settled our brains for a long winter's nap,--       When out on the lawn there arose such a clatter,       I sprang from my bed to see what was the matter.       Away to the window I flew like a flash,       Tore open the shutters and threw up the sash.         When what to my wondering eyes would appear       But a wee little sleigh and eight little reindeer,       With a wee little driver, so lively and quick,       I knew in a moment it must be Saint Nick.       More rapid than eagles his reindeers they came,       And he whistled and shouted and called them by name:       \"Now, Dasher! Now, Dancer! Now, Prancer and Vixen!       On, Comet! On, Cupid! On, Donder and Blitzen!       To the top of the porch, to the top of the wall!       Now, dash away, dash away, dash away, all.\"         So up to the housetop the reindeer they flew,       With a sleigh full of toys, and Saint Nicholas, too.       As I drew in my head and was turning around,       Down the chimney Saint Nicholas came with a bound.       He was dressed all in red from his head to his foot,       And his clothes were all tarnished with ashes and soot.       His eyes, how they twinkled! His dimples how merry!       His cheeks were like roses, his nose like a cherry.       He had a broad face and a little round belly       That shook when he laughed, like a bowl full of jelly.         A wink of his eye and a twist of his head       Soon gave me to know I had nothing to dread.       He spoke not a word, but went straight to his work       And filled all the stockings; then turned with a jerk,       And laying his finger aside of his nose,       And giving a nod, up the chimney he rose.       He sprang to his sleigh, to his team gave a whistle,       And away they all flew like the down of a thistle;       But I heard him exclaim e'er he drove out of sight:       \"Happy Christmas to all, and to all a good-night!\"         --_Clement C. Moore._    CHILDREN. Oh, that was just lovely.    TOOTSY. I just wish I could see him. Just once!    DUMPLING. And so do I. I'm going to catch him some Christmas Eve.    SNOOKUMS. Me, too!    _Enter from L._, MOTHER _and_ GRANDMA, _wearing winter coats and hats.  They carry coats and hats for_ FATHER _and_ GRANDPA.    MOTHER.

It had been the invariable usage with  nominating conventions of all parties to select candidates for the  Presidency and Vice-Presidency, one from the North and the other from  the South; but this assemblage nominated Mr. Lincoln, of Illinois, for  the first office, and for the second, Mr. Hamlin, of Maine--both  Northerners. Mr. Lincoln, its nominee for the Presidency, had publicly  announced that the Union \"could not permanently endure, half slave and  half free.\" The resolutions adopted contained some carefully worded  declarations, well adapted to deceive the credulous who were opposed to  hostile aggressions upon the rights of the States. In order to  accomplish this purpose, they were compelled to create a fictitious  issue, in denouncing what they described as \"the new dogma that the  Constitution, of its own force, carries slavery into any or all of the  Territories of the United States\"--a \"dogma\" which had never been held  or declared by anybody, and which had no existence outside of their own  assertion. There was enough in connection with the nomination to assure  the most fanatical foes of the Constitution that their ideas would be  the rule and guide of the party.    Meantime, the Democratic party had held a convention, composed as usual  of delegates from all the States. They met in Charleston, South  Carolina, on April 23d, but an unfortunate disagreement with regard to  the declaration of principles to be set forth rendered a nomination  impracticable. Both divisions of the Convention adjourned, and met again  in Baltimore in June. Then, having finally failed to come to an  agreement, they separated and made their respective nominations apart.  Mr. Douglas, of Illinois, was nominated by the friends of the doctrine  of \"popular sovereignty,\" with Mr. Fitzpatrick, of Alabama, for the  Vice-Presidency. Both these gentlemen at that time were Senators from  their respective States. Mr. Fitzpatrick promptly declined the  nomination, and his place was filled with the name of Mr. Herschel V.  Johnson, a distinguished citizen of Georgia.    The Convention representing the conservative, or State-Rights, wing of  the Democratic-party (the President of which was the Hon. Caleb Cushing,  of Massachusetts), on the first ballot, unanimously made choice of John  C. Breckinridge, of Kentucky, then Vice-President of the United States,  for the first office, and with like unanimity selected General Joseph  Lane, then a Senator from Oregon, for the second. The resolutions of  each of these two conventions denounced the action and policy of the  Abolition party, as subversive of the Constitution, and revolutionary in  their tendency.    Another convention was held in Baltimore about the same period[17] by  those who still adhered to the old Whig party, reenforced by the remains  of the \"American\" organization, and perhaps some others. This Convention  also consisted of delegates from all the States, and, repudiating all  geographical and sectional issues, and declaring it to be \"both the part  of patriotism and of duty to recognize no political principle other than  the Constitution of the country, the Union of the States, and the  enforcement of the laws,\" pledged itself and its supporters \"to  maintain, protect, and defend, separately and unitedly, those great  principles of public liberty and national safety against all enemies at  home and abroad.\" Its nominees were Messrs. John Bell, of Tennessee, and  Edward Everett, of Massachusetts, both of whom had long been  distinguished members of the Whig party.    The people of the United States now had four rival tickets presented to  them by as many contending parties, whose respective position and  principles on the great and absorbing question at issue may be briefly  recapitulated as follows:    1. The \"Constitutional-Union\" Party, as it was now termed, led by  Messrs. Bell and Everett, which ignored the territorial controversy  altogether, and contented itself, as above stated, with a simple  declaration of adherence to \"the Constitution, the Union, and the  enforcement of the laws.\"    2. The party of \"popular sovereignty,\" headed by Douglas and Johnson,  who affirmed the right of the people of the Territories, in their  territorial condition, to determine their own organic institutions,  independently of the control of Congress; denying the power or duty of  Congress to protect the persons or property of individuals or minorities  in such Territories against the action of majorities.    3. The State-Rights party, supporting Breckinridge and Lane, who held  that the Territories were open to citizens of all the States, with their  property, without any inequality or discrimination, and that it was the  duty of the General Government to protect both persons and property from  aggression in the Territories subject to its control. At the same time  they admitted and asserted the right of the people of a Territory, on  emerging from their territorial condition to that of a State, to  determine what should then be their domestic institutions, as well as  all other questions of personal or proprietary right, without  interference by Congress, and subject only to the limitations and  restrictions prescribed by the Constitution of the United States.    4. The so-called \"Republicans,\" presenting the names of Lincoln and  Hamlin, who held, in the language of one of their leaders,[18] that  \"slavery can exist only by virtue of municipal law\"; that there was \"no  law for it in the Territories, and no power to enact one\"; and that  Congress was \"bound to prohibit it in or exclude it from any and every  Federal Territory.\" In other words, they asserted the right and duty of  Congress to exclude the citizens of half the States of the Union from  the territory belonging in common to all, unless on condition of the  sacrifice or abandonment of their property recognized by the  Constitution--indeed, of the _only_ species of their property distinctly  and specifically recognized as such by that instrument.    On the vital question underlying the whole controversy--that is, whether  the Federal Government should be a Government of the whole for the  benefit of all its equal members, or (if it should continue to exist at  all) a sectional Government for the benefit of a part--the first three  of the parties above described were in substantial accord as against the  fourth. If they could or would have acted unitedly, they, could  certainly have carried the election, and averted the catastrophe which  followed. Nor were efforts wanting to effect such a union.    Mr. Bell, the Whig candidate, was a highly respectable and experienced  statesman, who had filled many important offices, both State and  Federal. He was not ambitious to the extent of coveting the Presidency,  and he was profoundly impressed by the danger which threatened the  country. Mr. Breckinridge had not anticipated, and it may safely be said  did not eagerly desire, the nomination. He was young enough to wait, and  patriotic enough to be willing to do so, if the weal of the country  required it. Thus much I may confidently assert of both those gentlemen;  for each of them authorized me to say that he was willing to withdraw,  if an arrangement could be effected by which the divided forces of the  friends of the Constitution could be concentrated upon some one more  generally acceptable than either of the three who had been presented to  the country. When I made this announcement to Mr. Douglas--with whom my  relations had always been such as to authorize the assurance that he  could not consider it as made in an unfriendly spirit--he replied that  the scheme proposed was impracticable, because his friends, mainly  Northern Democrats, if he were withdrawn, would join in the support of  Mr. Lincoln, rather than of any one that should supplant _him_  (Douglas); that he was in the hands of his friends, and was sure they  would not accept the proposition.    It needed but little knowledge of the _status_ of parties in the several  States to foresee a probable defeat if the conservatives were to  continue divided into three parts, and the aggressives were to be held  in solid column. But angry passions, which are always bad counselors,  had been aroused, and hopes were still cherished, which proved to be  illusory. The result was the election, by a minority, of a President  whose avowed principles were necessarily fatal to the harmony of the  Union.    Of 303 _electoral_ votes, Mr. Lincoln received 180, but of the _popular_  suffrage of 4,676,853 votes, which the electors represented, he obtained  only 1,866,352--something over a third of the votes. This discrepancy  was owing to the system of voting by \"general ticket\"--that is, casting  the State votes as a unit, whether unanimous or nearly equally divided.  Thus, in New York, the total popular vote was 675,156, of which 362,646  were cast for the so-called Republican (or Lincoln) electors, and  312,510 against them. Now York was entitled to 35 electoral votes.  Divided on the basis of the popular vote, 19 of these would have been  cast for Mr. Lincoln, and 16 against him. But under the \"general ticket\"  system the entire 35 votes were cast for the Republican candidates, thus  giving them not only the full strength of the majority in their favor,  but that of the great minority against them superadded. So of other  Northern States, in which the small majorities on one side operated with  the weight of entire unanimity, while the virtual unanimity in the  Southern States, on the other side, counted nothing more than a mere  majority would have done.    The manifestations which followed this result, in the Southern States,  did not proceed, "]]]
