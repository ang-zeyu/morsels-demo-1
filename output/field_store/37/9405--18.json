Weary and thirsty, Husain sat upon the ground. The enemy  drew near, but no one dared to kill the grandson of the Prophet. An arrow  pierced the ear of the little boy and he died. \"We came from God, and we  return to him,\" were the pathetic words of Husain, as with a sorrowful  heart he laid the dead body of his son on the sand. He then stooped down to  drink some water from the river Euphrates. Seeing him thus stooping, the  enemy discharged a flight of arrows, one of which wounded him in the mouth.  He fought bravely for a while, but at last fell covered with many wounds.  The schism between the Sunni and the Shia'h was now complete. {75}    The ceremonies celebrated during the annual fast of Muharram refer to these  historical facts, and help to keep alive a bitter feud; but to suppose that  the only difference between the Shia'h and the Sunni is a mere dispute as  to the proper order of the early Khalifs would be a mistake. Starting off  with a political quarrel, the Shia'hs have travelled into a very distinct  religious position of their own. The fundamental tenet of the Shia'h sect  is the \"divine right\" of 'Ali the Chosen and his descendants. From this it  follows that the chief duty of religion consists in devotion to the Imam  (or Pontiff); from which position some curious dogmas issue. The whole  question of the Imamat is a very important one. The word Imam comes from an  Arabic word meaning to aim at, to follow after. The term Imam then becomes  equal to the word leader or exemplar. It is applied in this sense to  Muhammad as the leader in all civil and religious questions, and to the  Khalifs, his successors. It is also, in its religious import only, applied  to the founders of the four orthodox schools of jurisprudence, and in a  restricted sense to the leader of a congregation at prayer in a mosque. It  is with the first of these meanings that we have now to deal. It is so used  in the Quran--\"When his Lord made trial of Abraham by commands which he  fulfilled, He said: 'I am about to make of thee an Imam to mankind;' he  said: 'Of my offspring also?' 'My covenant,' said God, 'embraceth not the  evil-doers.'\" (Sura ii. 118.) From this verse two doctrines are deduced.  First, that the Imam must be appointed by God, for if this is not the case,  why did Abraham say \"of my offspring also?\" Secondly, the Imam is free from  sin, for God said: \"My covenant embraceth not the evil-doer.\"    The first dispute about the Imamat originated with the twelve thousand who  revolted from 'Ali after the battle of Siffin (657 A.D.), because he  consented to submit to arbitration the dispute between himself and Muavia.  Some years after they were nearly all destroyed by 'Ali. A few {76}  survivors, however, fled to various parts. Two at last settled in Oman, and  there preached their distinctive doctrines. In course of time the people of  Oman adopted the doctrine that the Imamat was not hereditary but elective,  and that in the event of misconduct the Imam might be deposed.  'Abdullah-ibn-Ibadh (744 A.D.) was a vigorous preacher of this doctrine,  and from him the sect known as the 'Ibadhiyah takes its rise. The result of  this teaching was the establishment of the power and jurisdiction of the  Imam of Oman. The 'Ibadhiyah seem to have always kept themselves  independent of the Sunni Khalifs of Baghdad, and, therefore, would consider  themselves free from any obligation to obey the Sultan of Turkey. From the  ordinary Shia'hs they differ as regards the \"divine right\" of 'Ali and his  children. The curious in such matters will find the whole subject well  treated in Dr. Badger's \"Seyyids of Oman.\"    The term Kharigite (Separatist) has since become the generic name for a  group of sects which agree as to the need of an Imam, though they differ as  to the details of the dogma. In opposition to this heresy of the Kharigite  stands what may be termed the orthodox doctrine of the Shia'h. The Shia'hs  hold that the Imamat must continue in the family of 'Ali, and that religion  consists mainly in devotion to the Imam. The tragic end of 'Ali and his  sons invested them with peculiar interest. When grieving for the sad end of  their leaders, the Shi'ahs found consolation in the doctrine which soon  found development, _viz._, that it was God's will that the Imamat should  continue in the family of 'Ali. Thus a tradition relates that the Prophet  said: \"He of whom I am master has 'Ali also for a master.\" \"The best judge  among you is 'Ali.\" Ibn Abbas, a Companion says: \"I heard the Prophet say:  'He who blasphemes my name blasphemes the name of God; he who blasphemes  the name of 'Ali blasphemes my name.'\" A popular Persian hymn shows to what  an extent this feeling deepened. {77}     \"Mysterious being! none can tell    The attributes in thee that dwell;    None can thine essence comprehend;    To thee should every mortal bend--    For 'tis by thee that man is given    To know the high behests of heaven.\"    The general idea is, that long before the creation of the world, God took a  ray of light from the splendour of His own glory and united it to the body  of Muhammad, to which He said: \"Thou art the elect, the chosen, I will make  the members of thy family the guides to salvation.\" Muhammad said: \"The  first thing which God created was my light, and my spirit.\"[67] The body of  the Prophet was then in some mysterious way hidden. In due time the world  was created, but not until the birth of Muhammad did this ray of glory  appear. It is well known to all Musalmans as the \"Nur-i-Muhammadi\"--light  of Muhammad.    This \"Nur\" is said to be of four kinds. From the first kind God created His  Throne, from the second the Pen of Fate, from the third Paradise, and from  the fourth the state, or place of Spirits and all created beings. According  to a statement made by 'Ali, Muhammad said that he was created from the  light of God, whilst all other created beings were formed from the \"light  of Muhammad.\"[68]    This \"light\" descended to 'Ali, and from him passed on to the true Imams,  who alone are the lawful successors of the Prophet. Rebellion against them  is sin; devotion to them the very essence of religion.    The doctrine of the Imamat has given rise to endless discussion and  dissension, as the numerous sub-divisions of the Shia'h sect will show.  They are said to be thirty-two in number. The Shia'h proper is the largest  and most influential of them. The following are the Shi'ah tenets regarding  the Imam, based on one of their standard books of {78} divinity.[69] The  Imam is the successor of the Prophet, adorned with all the qualities which  he possessed. He is wiser than the most learned men of the age, holier than  the most pious. He is the noblest of the sons of men and is free from all  sin original or actual: hence the Imam is called ma'sum (innocent.)[70] God  rules the world by wisdom, hence the sending forth of prophets was a  necessity; but it was equally necessary to establish the Imamat. Thus the  Imam is equal to a prophet. 'Ali said: \"In me is the glory of every prophet  that has ever been.\" The authority of the Imam is the authority of God, for  (I quote the Hyat-un-Nafis) \"his word is the word of God and of the  Prophet, and obedience to his order is incumbent.\" The nature of the Imam  is identical with the nature of Muhammad, for did not 'Ali say: \"I am  Muhammad, and Muhammad is me.\" This probably refers to the possession by  the Imam of the \"light of Muhammad.\" The bodies of the Imams are so pure  and delicate that they cast no shadow.[71] They {79} are the beginning and  the end of all things. To know the Imams is the very essence of the  knowledge which men can gain of God. \"The Holy God calls the Imams His  word, His hands, His signs, His secret. Their commands and prohibitions,  their actions too, He recognises as His own.\" As mediums between God and  man they hold a far higher position than the prophets, for \"the grace of  God, without their intervention, reaches to no created being.\" These  extravagant claims for the Imams culminate in the assertion that \"for them  a pillar of light has been fixed between the earth and heaven, by which the  actions of the Faithful are made known to them.\" The Imam is the supreme  Pontiff, the Vicar of God on earth. The possession of an infallible book is  not sufficient. The infallible guide is needed. Such wisdom and discernment  as such a guide would require can only be found amongst the descendants of  the Prophet. It is no longer, then, a matter of wonder, that in some cases,  almost, if not entirely, divine honour is paid to 'Ali and his  descendants.[72]    The Usul, or fundamental tenets of the Shia'h sect are five in number. (1)  To believe in the unity of God, (2) To admit that He is just, (3) To  believe in the divine mission of all the prophets, and that Muhammad is the  chief of all, (4) To consider 'Ali the Khalif next in order after Muhammad,  (5) To believe 'Ali's descendants from Hasan to Mahdi, the twelfth Imam, to  be his true successors, and to consider all of them in character, position  and dignity as raised far above all other Muslims. This is the doctrine of  the Imamat.    {80}    The first principal divisions of the Shia'h sect are the Isma'ilians and  the Imamites. The latter believe in twelve Imams, reckoning 'Ali as the  first.[73] The last of the twelve Abu'l-Qasim, is supposed to be alive  still, though hidden in some secret place. He bears the name of Al-Mahdi,  \"the guided.\" It is expected that he will reappear at the second advent of  Christ. They say that he was born near Baghdad in the year 258 A.H.

Turn out of your copper 16 barrels of beer, give your first  liquor at 165, your second at 175, mash, run down, stand, and boil as  before. But before you commence brewing, take five pounds of brown  sugar, put it into a metal pot with some water, set it on the fire,  keep it constantly stirring till it begins to smell strong, then take  it off the fire, and add to it, gradually, three gallons of water, at  the temperature of blood heat, stirring the water and the sugar well  together, till the whole be perfectly blended; this prepared liquor  should be added to the worts in the copper before boiling. The  fermentation, &c., to be conducted as before, save only the pitching,  yest, to be increased by half a gallon, which half gallon is not to be  added to the worts until twelve hours after the first gallon.  Attenuation should proceed until the heat rises four degrees above the  pitching heat, which should be the same as in the preceding process. In  both instances, the tuns should be covered during the period of  fermentation, but taken off for the purpose of rousing before  cleansing; these covers should be put on again, in order to prevent the  dispersion or waste of the gasses, which is always a loss of  spirituosity.          _A good sound keeping Table Beer may be Brewed from wheaten Bran and  Shorts, and, in many situations, when Malt cannot be procured, would be  found an excellent substitute. This process is well worth the attention  of housekeepers._          PROCESS AS FOLLOWS:        40 Bushels of Shorts.      20 Bushels of Bran.        16 lb. of Hops will give 25 Barrels of Small Beer.    Boil your first copper, run into your mash tun as much boiling water  as, when reduced with cold, will bring it to the temperature of 1.0,  then commence your mashing operation, putting in two bushels of shorts,  and one bushel of bran at a time; when these are well mixed with the  water, put in more, mash again, and so continue to do till all is in;  it will take from half an hour to three quarters to mash this quantity  properly; let your mash stand two hours, run down as in the preceding  processes, and give your second liquor 165; mash a second time, stand  one hour, boil your first wort one hour very hard with half your hops,  which should have been steeped, rubbed, and salted, as before directed;  boil your second wort one hour and a half in the same way, putting on  the remainder of your hops, with one pound of ground mustard, and five  pounds of brown sugar, reduced, by boiling, to a colouring matter, as  already directed in the previous process; make up your two boilings in  your tun at the heat of 65, giving three gallons of solid yest; let  your attenuation proceed ten degrees, or to 75, then cleanse, and  continue to fill your casks in the usual way. It has been found that  beer brewed from these materials has stood the summer heats much better  than beer brewed from malt alone; this may be accounted for by the  extract of malt possessing a much larger proportion of saccharine  matter than that obtainable from bran and shorts. In families, this  beer may be brewed in the proportion of one or two barrels at a time;  and in the country, where brewer's yest may not be procurable, leaven,  diluted with blood-warm water, may be substituted for brewer's yest,  and will answer, but not so well; neither will attenuation go so high,  as fermentation with leaven, when applied to liquids, is generally  languid and slow.          _Single Ale and Table Beer._          100 Bushels of Malt.       60 lb. of Hops.        Heat of the air 50 degrees.        Cleansed or tunned 30 Barrels of Single Ale; with 16 Barrels of      Table Beer after.    First, or mashing liquor, 168, run your whole quantity of boiling  liquor into your mash tun, and when it cools down to the above point of  168, begin to run in your malt gradually from your malt bin; this  quantity will require four or five hands to mash it well, which will  generally take three quarters of an hour; when sufficiently mashed,  cover your tun, let it stand two hours; run down this first mash  smartly by two cocks within the hour; let your hops be rubbed, steeped,  and salted, as before directed; added to these worts, as they began to  boil, three gallons of the essentia bina or liquid colouring, with one  pound and a half of ground mustard, and one pound of liquorice root  finely powdered, boiled the whole two hours as hard as possible, there  being a second copper for this operation, there was liquor prepared for  the small beer and run on the keeve at the heat of 185; mashed well a  second time, and stood two hours; by this time the first wort was let  run into the hop back, and so on the cooler. After which, ran down the  small beer, got it into the small copper, adding about six hand buckets  of the hops that had been boiled on the single ale; these answered to  preserve the beer, with one pound of ground mustard to assist flavour,  and two gallons of the essentia bina to give colour; boiled the small  beer one hour smartly. The strong worts were let into the tun in three  portions, there being three coolers; the first division, at 65, had two  gallons and a half of yest given to it; the second, at 66, the same  quantity of yest; the third, at 65, was let down without yest, when all  were in the tun made up at 64; in thirteen hours the tun had a handsome  appearance of work; came on regularly, and attenuated to 76, having  gained 12 degrees within sixty hours, then cleansed and filled the  casks every three hours for the first eight fillings. Thus managed,  this single ale was fit to send out the fifth day after brewing. When  this ale is racking off the butts, to be sent out, would recommend  putting two ounces of ground rice into each barrel which will create  briskness, and much improve the beer. Ran the small beer into the hop  back of the strong beer, and so on the coolers, thereby giving it a  chance to lick up all the strong ale it met with in its progress to the  tun, which it entered at 65 with three gallons of yest, and was  cleansed within thirty-six hours. The quantity of beer here mentioned  would be much improved by the addition of six or seven pounds of brown  sugar or molasses; but if good table beer is wanted, it can be only  obtained from whole grists of malt, and is well worth the difference of  expense to those who can afford it, and appreciate quality.          _Strong Beer._          Brewed, November, 1810, the following materials. Heat of the air 50      degrees.        40 Bushels of Pale Malt.      20 Bushels of Amber Malt.      --      60      --      40 lb. of Hops, the best quality.        Cleansed 20 Barrels of Beer.    Rubbed, salted, and steeped the hops, as already directed, in a close  vessel, ran a sufficient quantity of boiling water on the mash tun for  the first mash, which was suffered to cool down to 165; mashed well for  nearly one hour, stood two hours; ran down smartly, boiled the first  wort one hour very hard, with about half the hops; mashed a second time  at about 185: took about half an hour in the operation, ran down  smartly after two hours' standing, got up this second mash smartly into  the copper, taking the necessary precaution of rincing the copper out  clean, for the reception of the second wort, which was boiled two hours  very hard, with the remainder of the hops; these two worts were run  together on the same cooler; after standing a few hours, were run on a  second cooler, and there suffered to remain till they came down to 65;  were then let into the tun, with two gallons of solid yest, by a large  plug hole in a few minutes so as to have scarcely suffered any  diminution of their heat; in twelve hours after, there was added two  gallons more of yest, roused the tun a second time, came on gradually,  and attenuated within 56 hours ten degrees, and so was cleansed at the  heat of 75, this beer was filled every two hours, for the first  twenty-four, and in a few days more became transparently fine; this  beer should have added to it, before sending out, four ounces of  steeped hops, and two ounces of ground rice to each barrel; the five  pounds of hops wanted for this operation is previously put to steep in  a clean tub with some of the beer. This beer, if thus brewed with good  materials, and treated as directed, will be found to give satisfaction.  During the winter half year, the fermenting tun should be always  covered; in summer, only partially so; the less strong beer is  attempted to be brewed in that season the better, as it will not keep,  necessity alone should compel the brewer to work, in this country,  during the summer months; and then at small beer only.          _Table Beer, English method of brewing it._          Take 8 bushels of Malt, and 6 lb. of Hops.        This quantity of materials should deliver four barrels of beer.        First liquor 161; mash the first time one hour.        Second liquor 170; mash the second time half an hour.        Third liquor 152; mash the third time twenty minutes.    Boil the three runnings together for two hours in a close covered  copper; three pints of good solid yest will be sufficient to pitch this  quantity, mixing it, before adding, with about one gallon of the wort,  then add this to the rest; a low attenuation for this kind of beer will  not answer, the specific gravity being too light, the fermentation  rarely exceeding 30 hours in the tun. It being generally wanted for  immediate use; it is pitched high, and worked quick. It is further  important to bung it down close as soon as it has done working. This  kind of beer may be securely and advantageously administered to fever  patients, instead of other"]]]
