Louis, Louis, _Tanta est  depravitas humani generis_!\"    \"FRANK!\" shouted Reginald, \"at your peril!\"    \"Well, my dear--what, is my life in peril from you again? I must take  care then.\"    \"Come, Frank, have done,\" cried one of his class-fellows, \"can't you  leave Louis Mortimer alone--it doesn't signify to you.\"    \"I only meant to admonish him by a gentle hint, that he must not presume  to contradict gentlemen whose honor and veracity may at least be on a  par with his own.\"    \"Frank,\" said Louis, \"I cannot think how you can suppose me guilty of  such meanness.\"    \"The least said, the soonest mended,\" remarked Salisbury. \"We must have  large powers of credence where you are concerned. Clear off your old  scores, and then we will begin a new one with you.\"    Reginald started to his feet. \"You shall rue this, Salisbury.\"    \"Two can play at your game,\" rejoined Salisbury, rising.    Reginald was springing forward, but was checked by Louis, who threw  himself on him. \"Do not fight, dear Reginald--do not, pray.\"    \"I will--unhand me, Louis! I tell you I WILL--let me go.\"    \"Dear Reginald, not for me--wait a minute.\"    At this moment the form behind them fell with a heavy bang, and in  struggling to release himself, Reginald fell over it, dragging Louis  with him. Louis was a little hurt, but he did not let go his hold.  \"Reginald,\" he said, \"ask Mrs. Wilkinson to say so herself; they will  believe her, I suppose.\"    The fall had a little checked his rage, and Reginald sat brooding in  sullen anger on the ground. At last he started up and left the room,  saying to Louis, \"It's all your fault, then--you've no spirit, and  you don't want me to have any.\"    Louis mechanically assisted in raising the form, and stood silently  by the table. He looked quickly round, and pushing the little share  of his untasted fruit from him, went into the school-room. He did not  recover his spirits again that evening, even when Reginald apologized  to him for his roughness, pleading in excuse the extreme trouble it  gave him to prevent himself from fighting with Salisbury.    As they went up stairs that night, in spite of the cautions given  by the usher to be quiet, a sham scuffle ensued on purpose between  Salisbury and Frank Digby, during which the former let his candle  fall over the bannisters, and they were left in darkness; though,  happily for the comfort of the doctor's dinner party, the second  hall and back staircase arrangement effectually prevented the noise  that ensued from reaching the drawing-room.    \"Halloa there--you fellows! Mortimer, ahoa!\" cried one of Salisbury's  party; \"bring your light.\"    \"You may come and fetch it if you want it,\" shouted Reginald from  his room.    \"We're in the dark,\" was the reply.    \"So much the better,\" said Reginald: \"perhaps you will behave a little  better now; if you want a light you may come and light your candle here.\"    \"Our candle's on the hall floor,\" said another voice, amidst suppressed  laughter.    \"Pick it up, then.\"    \"We're desperately afraid of hobgoblins,\" cried Frank, rushing into his  room and blowing their candle out.    \"What did you do that for, Frank?\" asked several indignant voices.    \"Because Salisbury and his myrmidons were coming to carry it off by a  _coup de main_--he-he-he--\" giggled Frank.    \"And so you've given your own head a blow to punish your tooth! well  done,\" exclaimed another voice at the door.    \"Peters, is that you?\"    \"What's to be done now?\"    \"How shall we get a light?\"    \"If you will give me the candle I will get one,\" said Louis.    Accordingly, the extinguished candle was delivered into his hands, and  he felt his way to the kitchen door, where he obtained a light, and then,  picking up the fallen candle, tried to arrange its shattered form, and  replace it. While thus employed, Ferrers joined him, and offered his aid,  and on Louis' accepting it, said in a low tone,--    \"Louis, I am a wretch, I am so very miserable. I can't think how you  can bear so much from one who has never done you any thing but harm.\"    Louis raised his head from his work in astonishment, and saw that  Ferrers looked as he said, very miserable, and was deadly pale.    \"I do so despise myself--to see you bearing all so sweetly, Louis. I  should have been different, perhaps, if I had known you before--I love,  I admire you, as much as I hate myself.\"    \"Are you coming with the candle there?\" cried a voice from above:  \"Louis Mortimer and William Ferrers in deep confabulation--wonders  will never cease.\"    Ferrers jumped up and ran up stairs with his candle, and Louis followed  more leisurely to his own room, nor could any thing induce him that  night to tell a story. How long and earnest was his prayer for one  who had injured him so cruelly, but towards whom he now, instead of  resentment, felt only pity and interest!    Ferrers, after tossing from side to side, and trying all schemes for  several hours, in vain, to drown his remorse in sleep, at last, at  daybreak, sank into an uneasy slumber. The image of Louis, and his  mute expression of patient sorrow that evening, haunted him, and he  felt an indefinable longing to be like him, and a horror of himself  in comparison with him. He remembered Louis' words, \"Pray to God;\"  and one murmured petition was whispered in the stillness of the night,  \"Lord have mercy on a great sinner.\"    Since his disgrace, Louis generally had his brother for a companion  during their walks; but the next morning Ferrers joined him, and asked  Louis to walk with him to the downs. They were both naturally silent  for the beginning of the walk; but on Louis making some remark, Ferrers  said, \"I can't think of any thing just now, Louis; I have done every  thing wrong to-day. My only satisfaction is in telling you how much  I feel your goodness. I can't think how you can endure me.\"    \"Oh, Ferrers!\" said Louis, \"what am I that I should not bear you? and  if you are really sorry, and wish to be better, I think I may some day  love you.\"    \"_That_ you can never do, Louis,--you must hate and despise me.\"    \"No, I do not,\" said Louis, kindly; \"I am very sorry for you.\"    \"You must have felt very angry.\"    \"I did feel very unkind and shocked at first,\" replied Louis; \"but by  God's grace I learned afterwards to feel very differently, and you can't  think how often I have pitied you since.\"    \"Pitied _me_!\" said Ferrers.    \"Oh yes,\" replied Louis, sweetly; \"because I am sure you must have been  very unhappy with the knowledge of sin in your heart--I don't think there  is any thing so hard as remorse to bear.\"    \"I did not feel much sorrow till you were so kind to me,\" said Ferrers.  \"What a wretch you must think me!\"    \"I have sinned too greatly myself to judge very hardly of you; and  when I think of all the love shown to me, I feel anxious to show some  love to others; and I should be afraid, if I thought too hardly of you,  I should soon be left to find out what I am.\"    Ferrers did not reply; he did not understand the motives which  induced Louis' forbearance and gentleness, for he was an entire  stranger to religion, and never having met with any one resembling  Louis, could not comprehend, though he did not fail to admire, his  character, now its beauty was so conspicuously before him. He felt  there was an immeasurable distance between them--for the first  time he found himself wanting. Mentally putting himself in Louis'  place, he acknowledged that no persuasion could have induced him  to act so generously and disinterestedly; and knowing the keen  sensitiveness of Louis to disgrace, he wondered how one so alive  to the opinion of others, and naturally so yielding and wavering,  could steadily and uncomplainingly persevere in his benevolent  purpose; for not by word or sign did Louis even hint the truth  to Reginald--the usual depository of his cares and secrets.    Louis, imagining the silence of his companion to proceed from shame  and distress, proceeded after a few minutes to reassure him.    \"You must not think that I am miserable, Ferrers, for lately I have  been much happier than even when I was in favor, for now I do not care  so much what the boys will think or say of me, and that thought was  always coming in the way of every thing; and there are many things  which make me very happy, often.\"    \"What things, Louis?\"    \"I do not think you would understand me,\" replied Louis, timidly;  \"the things and thoughts that make me happy are so different from  what we hear generally here.\"    \"But tell me, Louis. I want to know how it is you are so much better  than any one else here. I want to be better myself.\"    \"Oh, dear Ferrers,\" said Louis, gazing earnestly in Ferrers' face,  \"if you _do_ want to be better, come to our Saviour, and He will  make you all you want to be. It is the feeling of His goodness,  and the happy hope of being God's children, and having all their  sins forgiven, that make all God's people so happy; and you may have  this happiness too, if you will. I do not think we think enough of our  great name of Christian.\"    \"You read your Bible a great deal, Louis, don't you?\"    \"Not so much as I ought,\" replied Louis, blushing, \"but I love it  very much.\"    \"It always seems to me such a dull book, I am always very glad when  our daily reading's over.\"    \"I remember when I thought something in the same way,\" said Louis:  \"only mamma used always to explain things so pleasantly, that even  then I used to like to hear her read it to us. Papa once said to me  that the Bible is like a garden of flowers, through which a careless  person may walk, and notice nothing, but that one who is really anxious  to find flowers or herbs to cure his disease, will look carefully till  he finds what he wants, and that"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/19856"],[0,"A Study of Pueblo Architecture: Tusayan and Cibola (#16)"],[1,"ze, not  dressed, and are rather rougher and less flat than is usual, but the  wall has a good finish. The stone, however, is of poor quality. Most of  the débris about the ruin consists of small stone fragments and sand,  comparatively few stones of the size used in the walls being seen. The  material evidently came from the immediate vicinity of the ruin.    Pottery fragments were quite abundant about this ruin, most of the ware  represented being of exceptional quality and belonging to the older  types; red ware with black lines and black and white ware were  especially abundant.    There is quite an extensive view from the ruin, the top of the butte  commanding an outlook down the valley past Oraibi, and about 5 miles  north. There is also an extended outlook up the valley followed by the  wagon road above referred to, and over two branch valleys, one on the  east and another of much less extent on the west. The site was well  adapted for defense, which must have been one of the principal motives  for its selection.      [Illustration: Fig. 6. Ruin 14 miles north of Oraibi (Kwaituki).]    KWAITUKI.    The ruin known to the Tusayan as Kwaituki (Fig. 6) is also on the west  side of the Oraibi wash, 14 miles above Oraibi, and about 7 miles above  the ruin last described. Its general resemblance to the latter is very  striking. The builders have apparently been actuated by the same motives  in their choice of a site, and their manner of utilizing it corresponds  very closely. The crowning feature of the rocky knoll in this case is a  picturesque group of rectangular masses of sandstone, somewhat  irregularly distributed. The bare summit of a large block-like mass  still retains the vestiges of rooms, and probably most of the groups  were at one time covered with buildings, forming a prominent  citadel-like group in the midst of the village. To the north of this  rocky butte a large area seems to have been at one time inclosed by  buildings, forming a court of unusual dimensions. Along the outer margin  of the pueblo occasional fragments of walls define former rooms, but the  amount and character of the débris indicate that the inner area was  almost completely inclosed with buildings. The remains of masonry extend  on the south a little beyond the base of the central group of rocks, but  here the vestiges of stonework are rather faint and scattered.      [Illustration: Plate XXIII. Houses built over irregular sites, Walpi.]    In the nearly level tops of some of the rocks forming the central pile  are many smoothly worn depressions or cavities, which have evidently  been used for the grinding and shaping of stone implements.    A remarkable feature occurring within this village is a cave or  underground fissure in the rocks, which evidently had been used by the  inhabitants. The mouth or entrance to this cavern, partly obstructed and  concealed at the time of our visit, occurs at the point A on the plan.  On clearing away the rubbish at the mouth and entering it was found so  obstructed with broken rock and fine dust that but little progress could  be made in its exploration; but the main crevice in the rock could be  seen by artificial light to extend some 10 feet back from the mouth,  where it became very shallow. It could be seen that the original cavern  had been improved by the pueblo-builders, as some of the timbers that  had been placed inside were still in position, and a low wall of masonry  on the south side remained intact. Some Navajos stated that they had  discovered this small cave a couple of years before and had taken from  it a large unbroken water jar of ancient pottery and some other  specimens. The place was probably used by the ancient occupants simply  for storage.    Fragments of pottery of excellent quality were very abundant about this  ruin and at the foot of the central rocks the ground was thickly strewn  with fragments, often of large size.    The defensive character of this site parallels that of the ruin 7 miles  farther south in quite a remarkable manner, and the villages were  apparently built and occupied at the same time.    TEBUGKIHU, OR FIRE HOUSE.    About 15 miles northeast of Keam's Canyon, and about 25 miles from  Walpi, is a small ruin called by the Tusayan \"Tebugkihu,\" built by  people of the Fire gens (now extinct). As the plan (Fig. 7) clearly  shows, this pueblo is very different from the typical Tusayan villages  that have been previously described. The apparent unity of the plan, and  the skillful workmanship somewhat resembling the pueblos of the Chaco  are in marked contrast to the irregularity and careless construction of  most of the Tusayan ruins. Its distance from the center of the province,  too, suggests outside relationship; but still the Tusayan traditions  undoubtedly connect the place with some of the ancestral gentes, as seen  in Chapter I.    The small and compact cluster of rooms is in a remarkable state of  preservation, especially the outside wall. This wall was carefully and  massively constructed, and stands to the height of several feet around  the entire circumference of the ruin, except along the brink of the  cliff, as the plan shows.    This outer wall contains by far the largest stones yet found  incorporated in pueblo masonry. A fragment of this masonry is  illustrated in Pl. XI. The largest stone shown measures about 5 feet in  length, and the one adjoining on the right measures about 4 feet. These  dimensions are quite remarkable in pueblo masonry, which is  distinguished by the use of very small stones.    The well defined outer wall of this cluster to the unaided eye appears  to be elliptical, but it will be seen from the plan that the ellipse is  somewhat pointed on the side farthest from the cliff. As in other cases  of ancient pueblos with curved outlines, the outer wall seems to have  been built first, and the inner rooms, while kept as rectangular as  possible, were adjusted to this curve. This arrangement often led to a  cumulating divergence from radial lines in some of the partitions, which  irregularity was taken up in one room, as in this instance, in the space  near the gate. The outer wall is uniform in construction so far as  preserved. Many irregularities appear, however, in the construction of  the inner or partition walls, and some of the rooms show awkward  attempts at adjustment to the curve of the outer wall.      [Illustration: Fig. 7. Oval (Fire House) ruin, plan (Tebugkihu).]    The ruin is situated on the very brink of a small canyon, which probably  contained a spring at the foot of the cliff close under the ruin site,  as the vegetation there has an unusual appearance of freshness,  suggesting the close proximity of water to the surface. A steep trail  evidently connected the village with the bottom of the canyon. Some of  the rocks of the mesa rim were marked by numerous cup-like cavities  similar to those seen at Kwaituki, and used in the polishing and forming  of stone implements. The type of pueblo here illustrated belonged to a  people who relied largely on the architecture for defense, differing in  this respect from the spirit of Tusayan architecture generally, where  the inaccessible character of the site was the chief dependence.    CHUKUBI.    The ruin called Chukubi by the Tusayan (Pl. XII) is situated on the  Middle Mesa, about 3 miles northeast of Mashongnavi. It occupies a  promontory above the same broad sandstone ledge that forms such a  conspicuous feature in the vicinity of Mashongnavi and Shupaulovi, and  which supports the buttes upon which these villages are built.      [Illustration: Plate XXIV. Dance rock and kiva, Walpi.]    Little masonry now remains on this site, but here and there a fragment  aids in defining the general plan of the pueblo. In general form the  village was a large rectangle with a line of buildings across its  center, dividing it into two unequal courts, and a projecting wing on  the west side. As may be seen from the illustration, one end of the ruin  forms a clearly defined rectangular court, composed of buildings mostly  two rooms deep. Here, as in other ruins of Tusayan, the arrangement  about inclosed courts is in contrast with the parallelism of rows, so  noticeable a feature in the occupied villages. At the east end of the  ruin are several curious excavations. The soft sandstone has been  hollowed out to a depth of about 10 inches, in prolongation of the  outlines of adjoining rooms. Such excavation to obtain level floors is  quite unusual among the pueblo builders; it was practiced to a very  small extent, and only where it could be done with little trouble. Any  serious inequality of surface was usually incorporated in the  construction, as will be noticed at Walpi (Pl. XXIII). Vestiges of  masonry indicating detached rooms were seen in each of the courts of the  main rectangle.    On the slope of the hill, just above the broad ledge previously  described, there is a fine spring, but no trace of a trail connecting it  with the pueblo could be found.    This village was advantageously placed for defense, but not to the same  degree as Payupki, illustrated in Pl. XIII.    PAYUPKI.    The ruin called Payupki (Pl. XIII) occupies the summit of a bold  promontory south of the trail, from Walpi to Oraibi, and about 6 miles  northwest from Mashongnavi. The outer extremity of this promontory is  separated from the mesa by a deep notch. The summit is reached from the  mesa by way of the neck, as the outer point itself is very abrupt, much  of the sandstone ledge being vertical. A bench, 12 or 15 feet below the  summit and in places quite broad, encircles the promontory. This bench  also breaks off very abruptly.    As may be seen from the plan, the village is quite symmetrically laid  out and well arranged for defense. It is placed at the mesa end of the  promontory cap, and for greater security the second ledge has also been  fortified. All along the outer margin "]]]
