And that is, that you pay your prices into the  hands of living men, and do not pour them into coffins.    For observe that, as we arrange our payment of pictures at present, no  artist's work is worth half its proper value while he is alive. The  moment he dies, his pictures, if they are good, reach double their  former value; but, that rise of price represents simply a profit made by  the intelligent dealer or purchaser on his past purchases. So that the  real facts of the matter are, that the British public, spending a  certain sum annually in art, determines that, of every thousand it pays,  only five hundred shall go to the painter, or shall be at all concerned  in the production of art; and that the other five hundred shall be paid  merely as a testimonial to the intelligent dealer, who knew what to buy.  Now, testimonials are very pretty and proper things, within due limits;  but testimonial to the amount of a hundred per cent. on the total  expenditure is not good political economy. Do not, therefore, in  general, unless you see it to be necessary for its preservation, buy the  picture of a dead artist. If you fear that it may be exposed to contempt  or neglect, buy it; its price will then, probably, not be high: if you  want to put it into a public gallery, buy it; you are sure, then, that  you do not spend your money selfishly: or, if you loved the man's work  while he was alive, and bought it then, buy it also now, if you can see  no living work equal to it. But if you did not buy it while the man was  living, never buy it after he is dead: you are then doing no good to  him, and you are doing some shame to yourself. Look around you for  pictures that you really like, and in buying which you can help some  genius yet unperished--that is the best atonement you can make to the  one you have neglected--and give to the living and struggling painter at  once wages, and testimonial.      104. So far then of the motives which should induce us to keep down the  prices of modern art, and thus render it, as a private possession,  attainable by greater numbers of people than at present. But we should  strive to render it accessible to them in other ways also--chiefly by  the permanent decoration of public buildings; and it is in this field  that I think we may look for the profitable means of providing that  constant employment for young painters of which we were speaking last  evening.    The first and most important kind of public buildings which we are  always sure to want, are schools: and I would ask you to consider very  carefully, whether we may not wisely introduce some great changes in the  way of school decoration. Hitherto, as far as I know, it has either been  so difficult to give all the education we wanted to our lads, that we  have been obliged to do it, if at all, with cheap furniture and bare  walls; or else we have considered that cheap furniture and bare walls  are a proper part of the means of education; and supposed that boys  learned best when they sat on hard forms, and had nothing but blank  plaster about and above them whereupon to employ their spare attention;  also, that it was as well they should be accustomed to rough and ugly  conditions of things, partly by way of preparing them for the hardships  of life, and partly that there might be the least possible damage done  to floors and forms, in the event of their becoming, during the master's  absence, the fields or instruments of battle. All this is so far well  and necessary, as it relates to the training of country lads, and the  first training of boys in general. But there certainly comes a period in  the life of a well-educated youth, in which one of the principal  elements of his education is, or ought to be, to give him refinement of  habits; and not only to teach him the strong exercises of which his  frame is capable, but also to increase his bodily sensibility and  refinement, and show him such small matters as the way of handling  things properly, and treating them considerately.      105. Not only so; but I believe the notion of fixing the attention by  keeping the room empty, is a wholly mistaken one: I think it is just in  the emptiest room that the mind wanders most; for it gets restless, like  a bird, for want of a perch, and casts about for any possible means of  getting out and away. And even if it be fixed, by an effort, on the  business in hand, that business becomes itself repulsive, more than it  need be, by the vileness of its associations; and many a study appears  dull or painful to a boy, when it is pursued on a blotted deal desk,  under a wall with nothing on it but scratches and pegs, which would have  been pursued pleasantly enough in a curtained corner of his father's  library, or at the lattice window of his cottage. Now, my own belief is,  that the best study of all is the most beautiful; and that a quiet glade  of forest, or the nook of a lake shore, are worth all the schoolrooms in  Christendom, when once you are past the multiplication table; but be  that as it may, there is no question at all but that a time ought to  come in the life of a well-trained youth, when he can sit at a  writing-table without wanting to throw the inkstand at his neighbour;  and when also he will feel more capable of certain efforts of mind with  beautiful and refined forms about him than with ugly ones. When that  time comes, he ought to be advanced into the decorated schools; and this  advance ought to be one of the important and honourable epochs of his  life.      106. I have not time, however, to insist on the mere serviceableness to  our youth of refined architectural decoration, as such; for I want you  to consider the probable influence of the particular kind of decoration  which I wish you to get for them, namely, historical painting. You know  we have hitherto been in the habit of conveying all our historical  knowledge, such as it is, by the ear only, never by the eye; all our  notion of things being ostensibly derived from verbal description, not  from sight. Now, I have no doubt that, as we grow gradually wiser--and  we are doing so every day--we shall discover at last that the eye is a  nobler organ than the ear; and that through the eye we must, in reality,  obtain, or put into form, nearly all the useful information we are to  have about this world. Even as the matter stands, you will find that the  knowledge which a boy is supposed to receive from verbal description is  only available to him so far as in any underhand way he gets a sight of  the thing you are talking about. I remember well that, for many years of  my life, the only notion I had of the look of a Greek knight was  complicated between recollection of a small engraving in my pocket  Pope's Homer, and reverent study of the Horse Guards. And though I  believe that most boys collect their ideas from more varied sources and  arrange them more carefully than I did; still, whatever sources they  seek must always be ocular: if they are clever boys, they will go and  look at the Greek vases and sculptures in the British Museum, and at the  weapons in our armouries--they will see what real armour is like in  lustre, and what Greek armour was like in form, and so put a fairly true  image together, but still not, in ordinary cases, a very living or  interesting one.      107. Now, the use of your decorative painting would be, in myriads of  ways, to animate their history for them, and to put the living aspect of  past things before their eyes as faithfully as intelligent invention  can; so that the master shall have nothing to do but once to point to  the schoolroom walls, and for ever afterwards the meaning of any word  would be fixed in a boy's mind in the best possible way. Is it a  question of classical dress--what a tunic was like, or a chlamys, or a  peplus? At this day, you have to point to some vile woodcut, in the  middle of a dictionary page, representing the thing hung upon a stick;  but then, you would point to a hundred figures, wearing the actual  dress, in its fiery colours, in all actions of various stateliness or  strength; you would understand at once how it fell round the people's  limbs as they stood, how it drifted from their shoulders as they went,  how it veiled their faces as they wept, how it covered their heads in  the day of battle. _Now_, if you want to see what a weapon is like, you  refer, in like manner, to a numbered page, in which there are  spear-heads in rows, and sword-hilts in symmetrical groups; and  gradually the boy gets a dim mathematical notion how one scimitar is  hooked to the right and another to the left, and one javelin has a knob  to it and another none: while one glance at your good picture would show  him,--and the first rainy afternoon in the schoolroom would for ever fix  in his mind,--the look of the sword and spear as they fell or flew; and  how they pierced, or bent, or shattered--how men wielded them, and how  men died by them.      108. But far more than all this, is it a question not of clothes or  weapons, but of men? how can we sufficiently estimate the effect on the  mind of a noble youth, at the time when the world opens to him, of  having faithful and touching representations put before him of the acts  and presences of great men--how many a resolution, which would alter and  exalt the whole course of his after-life, might be formed, when in some  dreamy twilight he met, through his own tears, the fixed eyes of those  shadows of the great dead, unescapable and calm, piercing to his soul;  or fancied that their lips moved in dread reproof or soundless  exhortation? And if but for one out of many this were true--if yet, in a  few, you could be sure that such influence had indeed changed their  thoughts and destinies, and turned the eager and reckless youth, who  would have cast away his"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/19998"],[0,"Rural Architecture (#16)"],[1,"int, are  sufficiently high for the purpose,) is a passage leading to the kitchen.    Under the wing veranda, near the point of intersection of the wing with  the main body of the house, is an _every-day_ outer door, leading into a  small entry, 6x5 feet, and lighted by a low, one-sash window over the  door. By another door, this leads to the kitchen, or family room, which  is lighted by three windows. An ample fireplace, with oven, &c.,  accommodates this room at the end. A closet, 7x5 feet, also stands next  to the entry; and beyond that, an open passage, to the left, leading out  under the front hall stairs to the rooms of the main building. A door  also leads from that passage into a _best_ pantry, for choice crockery,  sweetmeats, and tea-table comforts. Another door, near the last, leads  into a dairy or milk-room, 9x8 feet, beyond the passage; in which last,  also, may be placed a tier of narrow shelves. This milk, or dairy-room,  is lighted by a window in the end, and connects also, by a door in the  side, with the _outer_ kitchen, or wash-room. Next to this milk-room  door, in the front kitchen, is another door leading down cellar; and  through this door, passing by the upper, broad stair of the flight of  cellar steps, is another door into the wash-room. At the farther angle  of the kitchen is still another door, opening into a passage four feet  wide; and, in that passage, a door leading up a flight of stairs into  the wing chambers. This passage opens into the back kitchen, or  wash-room, 16x16 feet in area, and lighted by two windows, one of which  looks into the wood-house. In this wash-room is a chimney with boilers  and fireplace, as may be required. The cellar and chamber stairs, and  the milk-room are also accessible direct, by doors leading from this  wash-room.    The chamber plan will be readily understood, and requires no particular  description. The space over the wing may be partitioned off according to  the plan, or left more open for the accommodation of the \"work folks,\"  as occasion may demand. But, as this dwelling is intended for  substantial people, \"well to do in the world,\" and who extend a generous  hospitality to their friends, a liberal provision of sleeping chambers  is given to the main body of the house. The parlor chamber, which is the  best, or _spare_ one, is 18x16 feet, with roomy side-closets. Besides  this, are other rooms for the daughters Sally, and Nancy, and Fanny, and  possibly Mary and Elizabeth--who want their own chambers, which they  keep so clean and tidy, with closets full of nice bedclothes, table  linen, towels, &c., &c., for certain events not yet whispered of, but  quite sure to come round. And then there are Frederick, and Robert, and  George, fine stalwart boys coming into manhood, intending to be  \"somebody in the world,\" one day or another; they must have _their_  rooms--and good ones too; for, if any people are to be well lodged, why  not those who toil for it? All such accommodation every farm house of  this character should afford. And we need not go far, or look sharp, to  see the best men and the best women in our state and nation graduating  from the wholesome farm house thus tidily and amply provided. How  delightfully look the far-off mountains, or the nearer plains, or  prairies, from the lawn porch of this snug farm house! The distant lake;  the shining river, singing away through the valley; or the wimpling  brook, stealing through the meadow! Aye, enjoy them all, for they are  God's best, richest gifts, and we are made to love them.    The wood-house strikes off from the back kitchen, retreating two feet  from its gable wall, and is 36x14 feet in size. A bathing room may be  partitioned off 8x6 feet, on the rear corner next the wash-room, if  required, although not laid down in the plan. At the further end is the  water-closet, 6x4 feet. Or, if the size and convenience of the family  require it, a part of the wood-house may be partitioned off for a  wash-room, from which a chimney may pass up through the peak of the  roof. If so, carry it up so high that it will be above the eddy that the  wind may make in passing over the adjoining wing, not causing it to  smoke from that cause.    At the far end of the wood-house is the workshop and tool-house, 18x16  feet, lighted by two windows, and a door to enter it from beneath the  wood-house. Over this, is the lumber and store-room.    Next to this is the swill-room and pigsty for the house pigs, as  described in the last design; and over it a loft for farm seeds, small  grains, and any other storage required.    Adjoining this is the wagon and carriage-house; and above, the hayloft,  stretching, also, partly over the stable which stands next, with two  stalls, 12x5 feet each, with a flight of stairs leading to the loft, in  the passage next the door. In this loft are swinging windows, to let in  hay for the horses.    This completes the household establishment, and we leave the  surroundings to the correct judgment and good taste of the proprietor to  complete, as its position, and the variety of objects with which it may  be connected, requires.    Stone and brick we have mentioned as the proper materials for this  house; but it may be also built of wood, if more within the means and  limits of the builder. There should be no pinching in its proportions,  but every part carried out in its full breadth and effect.    The cost of the whole establishment may be from $2,000, to $3,000;  depending somewhat upon the material used, and the finish put upon it.  The first-named sum would build the whole in an economical and plain  manner, while the latter would complete it amply in its details.      MISCELLANEOUS.    It may be an objection in the minds of some persons to the various plans  here submitted, that we have connected the out-buildings _immediately_  with the offices of the dwelling itself. We are well aware that such is  not always usual; but many years observation have convinced us, that in  their use and occupation, such connection is altogether the most  convenient and economical. The only drawback is in the case of fire;  which, if it occur in any one building, the whole establishment is  liable to be consumed. This objection is conceded; but we take it, that  it is the business of every one not able to be his own insurer, to have  his buildings insured by others; and the additional cost of this  insurance is not a tithe of what the extra expense of time, labor, and  exposure is caused to the family by having the out-buildings  disconnected, and at a _fire-proof_ distance from each other. There has,  too, in the separation of these out-buildings, (we do not now speak of  barns, and houses for the stock, and the farmwork proper,) from the main  dwelling, crept into the construction of such dwellings, by modern  builders, _some_ things, which in a country establishment, particularly,  ought never to be there, such as privies, or _water-closets_, as they  are more _genteelly_ called. These last, in our estimation, have no  business _in_ a _farmer's_ house. They are an _effeminacy_, only, and  introduced by _city_ life. An _appendage_ they should be, but separated  to some distance from the living rooms, and accessible by sheltered  passages to them. The wood-house should adjoin the outer kitchen,  because the fuel should always be handy, and the outer kitchen, or  wash-room is a sort of _slop_-room, of necessity; and the night wood,  and that for the morning fires may be deposited in it for immediate use.  The workshop, and small tool-house naturally comes next to that, as  being chiefly used in stormy weather. Next to this last, would, more  conveniently, come the carriage or wagon-house, and of course a stable  for a horse or two for family use, always accessible at night, and  convenient at unseasonable hours for farm labor. In the same close  neighborhood, also, should be a small pigsty, to accommodate a pig or  two, to eat up the kitchen slops from the table, refuse vegetables,  parings, dishwater, &c., &c., which could not well be carried to the  main piggery of the farm, unless the old-fashioned filthy mode of  letting the hogs run in the road, and a trough set outside the door-yard  fence, as seen in some parts of the country, were adopted. A pig can  always be kept, and fatted in three or four months, from the wash of the  house, with a little grain, in any well-regulated farmer's family. A few  fowls may also be kept in a convenient hen-house, if desired, without  offence--all constituting a part of the _household_ economy of the  place.    These out-buildings too, give a comfortable, domestic look to the whole  concern. Each one shelters and protects the other, and gives an air of  comfort and repose to the whole--a family expression all round. What so  naked and chilling to the feelings, as to see a country dwelling-house  all perked up, by itself, standing, literally, out of doors, without any  dependencies about it? No, no. First should stand the house, the chief  structure, in the foreground; appendant to that, the kitchen wing; next  in grade, the wood-house; covering in, also, the minor offices of the  house. Then by way of setting up, partially on their own account, should  come the workshop, carriage-house, and stable, as practically having a  separate character, but still subordinate to the house and its  requirements; and these too, may have their piggery and hen-house, by  way of tapering off to the adjoining fence, which encloses a kitchen  garden, or family orchard. Thus, each structure is appropriate in its  way--and together, they form a combination grateful to the sight, as a  complete rural picture. All objections, on account of filth or vermin,  to this connection, may be removed by a cleanly keeping of the  premises--a removal of all offal immediately as it is made, and daily or  weekly taking it on to the manure heaps of the barns, or depositing it  at"]]]
