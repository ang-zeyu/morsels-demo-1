To the north of the Karroo and of the  mountains which bound it, a similar district, equally arid, dreary, and  barren, stretches away to the banks of the Orange River, which here in  its lower course has less water than in its upper course, because, like  the Nile, it receives no affluents and is wasted by the terrible sun. In  fact, one may say that from the mountains dividing the southern part of  the Karroo from the coast lands all the way north to the Orange River, a  distance of nearly four hundred miles, nature has made the country a  desert of clay and stone (seldom of sand), though man has here and there  tried to redeem it for habitation.    The north-eastern part of the interior of Cape Colony is more generally  elevated than the south-western. From Graaf-Reinet northward to  Kimberley and Mafeking, and north-eastward to the borders of Basutoland,  the country is 4000 feet or more above sea-level; much of it is nearly  level, and almost all of it bare of wood. It is better watered than the  western districts, enjoying a rainfall of from ten to twenty-five inches  in the year, and is therefore mostly covered with grass after the rains,  and not merely with dry thorny bushes. Nevertheless, its general aspect  in the dry season is so parched and bare that the stranger is surprised  to be told that it supports great quantities of cattle, sheep, and  goats. The south-eastern part, including the Quathlamba Range, and the  hilly country descending from that range to the sea, has a still heavier  rainfall and is in some places covered with forest. Here the grass is  richer, and in the valleys there is plenty of land fit for tillage  without irrigation.      THE COLONY OF NATAL    Much smaller, but more favoured by nature, is the British colony of  Natal, which adjoins the easternmost part of Cape Colony, and now  includes the territories of Zululand and Tonga land. Natal proper and  Zululand resemble in their physical conditions the south-eastern corner  of Cape Colony. Both lie entirely on the sea slope of the Quathlamba  Range, and are covered by mountains and hills descending from that  range. Both are hilly or undulating, with a charming variety of surface;  and they are also comparatively well watered, with a perennial stream in  every valley. Hence there is plenty of grass, and towards the coast  plenty of wood also, while the loftier interior is bare. The climate is  much warmer than that of Cape Colony, and in the narrow strip which  borders the sea becomes almost tropical. Nor is this heat attributable  entirely to the latitude. It is largely due to the great Mozambique  current, which brings down from the tropical parts of the Indian Ocean a  vast body of warm water which heats the adjoining coast just as the Gulf  Stream heats the shores of Georgia and the Carolinas; and the effect of  this mass of hot water upon the air over it would doubtless be felt much  more in Natal were it not for the rapid rise of the ground from the sea  in that colony. Pietermaritzburg, the capital, is only some fifty miles  from the coast as the crow flies. But though it lies in a valley, it is  2225 feet above sea-level, and from it the country steadily rises  inland, till at Laing's Nek (the watershed between the Indian Ocean and  the Atlantic), the height of 5300 feet is reached, and the winter cold  is severe. Nearly the whole of Natal and four-fifths of Zululand may  thus be deemed a temperate country, where Europeans can thrive and  multiply. So far as soil goes it is one of the richest as well as one of  the fairest parts of South Africa. Tongaland, a smaller district, lies  lower and is less healthy.      GERMAN SOUTH-WEST AFRICA    Very different is the vast German territory (322,000 square miles) which  stretches northward from Cape Colony, bounded on the south by the Orange  River, on the north by the West African territories of Portugal, on the  east by Bechuanaland. Great Namaqualand and Damaraland constitute an  enormous wilderness, very thinly peopled, because the means of life are  very scanty. This wilderness is, except the narrow and sandy coast  strip, a high country (3000 to 4500 feet above sea-level) and a dry  country, drier even than the Karroo, and far too dry for any kind of  cultivation. Some parts, especially those in the south-west, are  hopelessly parched and barren; others have small bushes or grass; while  on the higher grounds and generally in the far northern parts, where the  Ovampo tribe dwell, grass is abundant, and as cattle can thrive there is  also population. Copper has been discovered in considerable quantities,  and other minerals (including coal) are believed to exist. But the  country, taken all in all, and excepting the little explored districts  of the north-east, toward the Upper Zambesi,--districts whose resources  are still very imperfectly known,--is a dreary and desolate region,  which seems likely to prove of little value. Germany now owns the whole  of it, save the port of Walfish Bay, which has been retained for and is  administered by Cape Colony.      PORTUGUESE SOUTH-EAST AFRICA    On the opposite side of the continent Portugal holds the country which  lies along the Indian Ocean from British Tongaland northward to the  Zambesi. Close to the sea it is level, rising gently westward in hills,  and in some places extending to the crest of the Quathlamba Mountains.  Thus it has considerable variety of aspect and climate, and as the rain  falls chiefly on the slopes of the mountains, the interior is generally  better watered than the flat seaboard, which is often sandy and  worthless. Much of this region is of great fertility, capable of  producing all the fruits of the tropics. But much of it, including some  of the most fertile parts, is also very malarious, while the heat is far  too great for European labour. When plantations are established  throughout it, as they have been in a few--but only a few--spots by the  Portuguese, it will be by natives that they will be cultivated. The  Kafir population is now comparatively small, but this may be due rather  to the desolating native wars than to the conditions of the soil.    So much for the four maritime countries. There remain the two Dutch  republics and the British territories which have not yet been formed  into colonies.      THE ORANGE FREE STATE    The Orange Free State (48,000 square miles) lies entirely on the great  plateau, between 4000 and 5000 feet above sea-level. It is in the main a  level country, though hills are scattered over it, sometimes reaching a  height of nearly 6000 feet. A remarkable feature of most of these hills,  as of many all over the plateau, is that they are flat-topped, and have  often steep, even craggy escarpments. This seems due to the fact that  the strata (chiefly sandstone) are horizontal; and very often a bed of  hard igneous rock, some, kind of trap or greenstone, or porphyry,  protects the summit of the hill from the disintegrating influences of  the weather. It is a bare land, with very little wood, and that small  and scrubby, but is well covered with herbage, affording excellent  pasture during two-thirds of the year. After the first rains, when these  wide stretches of gently undulating land are dressed in their new  vesture of brilliant green, nothing can be imagined more exhilarating  than a ride across the wide expanse; for the air is pure, keen, and  bracing, much like that of the high prairies of Colorado or Wyoming.  There are fortunately no blizzards, but violent thunderstorms are not  uncommon, and the hailstones--I have seen them as big as bantams'  eggs--which fall during such storms sometimes kill the smaller animals,  and even men. Dry as the land appears to the eye during the winter, the  larger streams do not wholly fail, and water can generally be got. The  south-eastern part of the Free State, especially along the Caledon  River, is extremely fertile, one of the best corn-growing parts of  Africa. The rest is fitter for pasture than for tillage, except, of  course, on the alluvial banks of the rivers, and nearly the whole region  is in fact occupied by huge grazing farms. As such a farm needs and  supports only a few men, the population grows but slowly. The Free State  is nearly as big as England and just as big as the State of New York;  but it has only 77,000 white inhabitants and about 130,000 natives.      THE SOUTH AFRICAN REPUBLIC    Somewhat larger,--about as large as Great Britain and nearly two-thirds  the size of France--is the South African Republic, which we commonly  talk of as the Transvaal. Of its white population, which numbers some  170,000, two-thirds are in the small mining district of the  Witwatersrand. All the Transvaal, except a strip on the eastern and  another strip on the northern border along the river Limpopo, also  belongs to the great plateau and exhibits the characteristic features of  the plateau. The hills are, however, higher than in the Free State, and  along the east, where the Quathlamba Range forms the outer edge of the  plateau, they deserve to be called mountains, for some of them reach  7000 feet. These high regions are healthy, for the summer heats are  tempered by easterly breezes and copious summer rains. The lower parts  lying toward the Indian Ocean and the Limpopo River are feverish, though  drainage and cultivation may be expected to reduce the malaria and  improve the conditions of health. Like the Free State, the Transvaal is  primarily a pasture land, but in many parts the herbage is less juicy  and wholesome than in the smaller republic, and belongs to what the  Dutch Boers call \"sour veldt.\" There are trees in the more sheltered  parts, but except in the lower valleys, they are small, and of no  economic value.

He pulled out the first of  the notes. \"Give this to Lady Maud the first chance you get. It's  important. Here's a sovereign for your trouble.\"    He hastened away. He noticed that gratification had turned the  other nearly purple in the face, and was anxious to leave him. He  was a modest young man, and effusive thanks always embarrassed him.    There now remained the disposal of the duplicate note. It was  hardly worth while, perhaps, taking such a precaution, but George  knew that victories are won by those who take no chances. He had  wandered perhaps a hundred yards from the rose-garden when he  encountered a small boy in the many-buttoned uniform of a page. The  boy had appeared from behind a big cedar, where, as a matter of  fact, he had been smoking a stolen cigarette.    \"Do you want to earn half a crown?\" asked George.    The market value of messengers had slumped.    The stripling held his hand out.    \"Give this note to Lady Maud.\"    \"Right ho!\"    \"See that it reaches her at once.\"    George walked off with the consciousness of a good day's work done.  Albert the page, having bitten his half-crown, placed it in his  pocket. Then he hurried away, a look of excitement and gratification  in his deep blue eyes.        CHAPTER 9.    While George and Billie Dore wandered to the rose garden to  interview the man in corduroys, Maud had been seated not a hundred  yards away--in a very special haunt of her own, a cracked stucco  temple set up in the days of the Regency on the shores of a little  lily-covered pond. She was reading poetry to Albert the page.    Albert the page was a recent addition to Maud's inner circle. She  had interested herself in him some two months back in much the same  spirit as the prisoner in his dungeon cell tames and pets the  conventional mouse. To educate Albert, to raise him above his  groove in life and develop his soul, appealed to her romantic  nature as a worthy task, and as a good way of filling in the time.  It is an exceedingly moot point--and one which his associates of  the servants' hall would have combated hotly--whether Albert  possessed a soul. The most one could say for certain is that he  looked as if he possessed one. To one who saw his deep blue eyes  and their sweet, pensive expression as they searched the middle  distance he seemed like a young angel. How was the watcher to know  that the thought behind that far-off gaze was simply a speculation  as to whether the bird on the cedar tree was or was not within  range of his catapult? Certainly Maud had no such suspicion. She  worked hopefully day by day to rouse Albert to an appreciation of  the nobler things of life.    Not but what it was tough going. Even she admitted that. Albert's  soul did not soar readily. It refused to leap from the earth. His  reception of the poem she was reading could scarcely have been  called encouraging. Maud finished it in a hushed voice, and looked  pensively across the dappled water of the pool. A gentle breeze  stirred the water-lilies, so that they seemed to sigh.    \"Isn't that beautiful, Albert?\" she said.    Albert's blue eyes lit up. His lips parted eagerly,    \"That's the first hornet I seen this year,\" he said pointing.    Maud felt a little damped.    \"Haven't you been listening, Albert?\"    \"Oh, yes, m'lady! Ain't he a wopper, too?\"    \"Never mind the hornet, Albert.\"    \"Very good, m'lady.\"    \"I wish you wouldn't say 'Very good, m'lady'. It's like--like--\"  She paused. She had been about to say that it was like a butler,  but, she reflected regretfully, it was probably Albert's dearest  ambition to be like a butler. \"It doesn't sound right. Just say  'Yes'.\"    \"Yes, m'lady.\"    Maud was not enthusiastic about the 'M'lady', but she let it go.  After all, she had not quite settled in her own mind what exactly  she wished Albert's attitude towards herself to be. Broadly  speaking, she wanted him to be as like as he could to a medieval  page, one of those silk-and-satined little treasures she had read  about in the Ingoldsby Legends. And, of course, they presumably  said 'my lady'. And yet--she felt--not for the first time--that it  is not easy, to revive the Middle Ages in these curious days. Pages  like other things, seem to have changed since then.    \"That poem was written by a very clever man who married one of my  ancestresses. He ran away with her from this very castle in the  seventeenth century.\"    \"Lor'\", said Albert as a concession, but he was still interested in  the hornet.    \"He was far below her in the eyes of the world, but she knew what a  wonderful man he was, so she didn't mind what people said about her  marrying beneath her.\"    \"Like Susan when she married the pleeceman.\"    \"Who was Susan?\"    \"Red-'eaded gel that used to be cook 'ere. Mr. Keggs says to 'er,  'e says, 'You're marrying beneath you, Susan', 'e says. I 'eard  'im. I was listenin' at the door. And she says to 'im, she says,  'Oh, go and boil your fat 'ead', she says.\"    This translation of a favourite romance into terms of the servants'  hall chilled Maud like a cold shower. She recoiled from it.    \"Wouldn't you like to get a good education, Albert,\" she said  perseveringly, \"and become a great poet and write wonderful poems?\"    Albert considered the point, and shook his head.    \"No, m'lady.\"    It was discouraging. But Maud was a girl of pluck. You cannot leap  into strange cabs in Piccadilly unless you have pluck. She picked  up another book from the stone seat.    \"Read me some of this,\" she said, \"and then tell me if it doesn't  make you feel you want to do big things.\"    Albert took the book cautiously. He was getting a little fed up  with all this sort of thing. True, 'er ladyship gave him chocolates  to eat during these sessions, but for all that it was too much like  school for his taste. He regarded the open page with disfavour.    \"Go on,\" said Maud, closing her eyes. \"It's very beautiful.\"    Albert began. He had a husky voice, due, it is to be feared,  to precocious cigarette smoking, and his enunciation was not as  good as it might have been.        \"Wiv' blekest morss the flower-ports        Was-I mean were-crusted one and orl;      Ther rusted niles fell from the knorts        That 'eld the pear to the garden-worll.      Ther broken sheds looked sed and stringe;        Unlifted was the clinking latch;        Weeded and worn their ancient thatch      Er-pon ther lownely moated gringe,        She only said 'Me life is dreary,          'E cometh not,' she said.\"      Albert rather liked this part. He was never happy in narrative  unless it could be sprinkled with a plentiful supply of \"he said's\"  and \"she said's.\" He finished with some gusto.        \"She said - I am aweary, aweary,       I would that I was dead.\"    Maud had listened to this rendition of one of her most adored poems  with much the same feeling which a composer with an over-sensitive  ear would suffer on hearing his pet opus assassinated by a  schoolgirl. Albert, who was a willing lad and prepared, if such  should be her desire, to plough his way through the entire seven  stanzas, began the second verse, but Maud gently took the book away  from him. Enough was sufficient.    \"Now, wouldn't you like to be able to write a wonderful thing like  that, Albert?\"    \"Not me, m'lady.\"    \"You wouldn't like to be a poet when you grow up?\"    Albert shook his golden head.    \"I want to be a butcher when I grow up, m'lady.\"    Maud uttered a little cry.    \"A butcher?\"    \"Yus, m'lady. Butchers earn good money,\" he said, a light of  enthusiasm in his blue eyes, for he was now on his favourite  subject. \"You've got to 'ave meat, yer see, m'lady. It ain't like  poetry, m'lady, which no one wants.\"    \"But, Albert,\" cried Maud faintly. \"Killing poor animals. Surely  you wouldn't like that?\"    Albert's eyes glowed softly, as might an acolyte's at the sight of  the censer.    \"Mr. Widgeon down at the 'ome farm,\" he murmured reverently, \"he  says, if I'm a good boy, 'e'll let me watch 'im kill a pig  Toosday.\"    He gazed out over the water-lilies, his thoughts far away. Maud  shuddered. She wondered if medieval pages were ever quite as earthy  as this.    \"Perhaps you had better go now, Albert. They may be needing you in  the house.\"    \"Very good, m'lady.\"    Albert rose, not unwilling to call it a day. He was conscious of  the need for a quiet cigarette. He was fond of Maud, but a man  can't spend all his time with the women.    \"Pigs squeal like billy-o, m'lady!\" he observed by way of adding a  parting treasure to Maud's stock of general knowledge.  \"Oo! 'Ear  'em a mile orf, you can!\"    Maud remained where she was, thinking, a wistful figure.  Tennyson's \"Mariana\" always made her wistful even when rendered by  Albert. In the occasional moods of sentimental depression which  came to vary her normal cheerfulness, it seemed to her that the  poem might have been written with a prophetic eye to her special  case, so nearly did it crystallize in magic words her own story.            \"With blackest moss the flower-pots           Were thickly crusted, one and all.\"    Well, no, not that particular part, perhaps. If he had found so  much as one flower-pot of his even thinly crusted with any foreign  substance, Lord Marshmoreton would have gone through the place like  an east wind, dismissing gardeners and under-gardeners with every  breath. But--             \"She only said 'My life is dreary,              He cometh not,' she said.           She said 'I am aweary, aweary.              I would that I were dead!\"    How exactly--at these moments when she was not out on the links  picking them off the turf with a midiron or engaged in one of those  other healthful sports which tend to take the mind off its  troubles--those words summed up her case.    Why didn't Geoffrey come? Or at least write? She could not write to  him. Letters from the"]]]
