Sir Horace Smith-Dorrien.    \"I say without hesitation that the saving of the left wing of the army  under my command on the morning of the 26th of August, could never have  been accomplished unless a commander of rare and unusual coolness,  intrepidity, and determination had been present to personally conduct  the operation.    \"The retreat was continued far into the night of the 26th and through  the 27th and 28th, on which date the troops halted on the line  Noyon-Chauny-LaFere, having then thrown off the weight of the enemy's  pursuit.    \"On the 27th and 28th I was much indebted to General Sordet and the  French Cavalry Division which he commands for materially assisting my  retirement and successfully driving back some of the enemy on Cambrai.    \"This closes the period covering the heavy fighting which commenced at  Mons on Sunday afternoon, 23d August, and which really constituted a  four days' battle.    \"It is impossible for me to speak too highly of the skill evinced by the  two general officers commanding army corps; the self-sacrificing and  devoted exertions of their staffs; the direction of the troops by  divisional, brigade, and regimental leaders; the command of the smaller  units by their officers; and the magnificent fighting spirit displayed  by non-commissioned officers and men.    \"I wish particularly to bring to your Lordship's notice the admirable  work done by the Royal Flying Corps under Sir David Henderson. Their  skill, energy, and perseverance have been beyond all praise. They have  furnished me with the most complete and accurate information, which has  been of incalculable value in the conduct of the operations. Fired at  constantly both by friend and foe, and not hesitating to fly in every  kind of weather, they have remained undaunted throughout.    \"Further, by actually fighting in the air, they have succeeded in  destroying five of the enemy's machines.\"    The combined French and British armies, including the forces that had  retreated from Alsace and Lorraine, gave way with increasing  stubbornness before von Kluck. That German general disregarding the  fortresses surrounding Paris, swung southward to make a junction with  the Army of the Crown Prince of Germany advancing through the Vosges  Mountains. General Manoury's army opposed the German advance on the  entrenched line of Paris. General Gallieni commanding the garrison of  Paris, was ready with a novel mobile transport consisting of taxicabs  and fast trucks. The total number of soldiers in the French and British  armies now outnumbered those in the German armies opposed to them.    General Joffre, in supreme command of the French, had chosen the  battleground. He had set the trap with consummate skill. The word was  given; the trap was sprung; and the first battle of the Marne came as a  crashing surprise to Germany.        CHAPTER VI    THE TRAIL OF THE BEAST IN BELGIUM    Germany's onrush into heroic Belgium speedily resolved itself into a  saturnalia that drenched the land with blood and roused the civilized  world into resentful horror. As the tide of barbarity swept forward into  Northern France, stories of the horrors filtered through the close web  of German censorship. There were denials at first by German  propagandists. In the face of truth furnished by thousands of witnesses,  the denials faded away.    What caused these atrocities? Were they the spontaneous expression of  dormant brutishness in German soldiers? Were they a sudden reversion of  an entire nation to bestiality?    The answer is that the private soldier as an individual was not  responsible. The carnage, the rapine, the wholesale desolation was an  integral part of the German policy of schrecklichkeit or frightfulness.  This policy was laid down by Germany as part of its imperial war code.  In 1902 Germany issued a new war manual entitled \"Kriegsbrauch im  Landkriege.\" In it is written this cold-blooded declaration:      All measures which conduce to the attainment of the object of war are  permissible and these may be summarized in the two ideas of violence and  cunning. What is permissible includes every means of war without which  the object of the war cannot be attained. All means which modern  invention affords, including the fullest, most dangerous, and most  massive means of destruction, may be utilized.      Brand Whitlock, United States Minister to Belgium, in a formal report to  the State Department, made this statement concerning Germany's policy in  permitting these outrages:    \"All these deliberate organized massacres of civilians, all these  murders and outrages, the violation of women, the killing of children,  wanton destruction, burning, looting and pillage, and whole towns  destroyed, were acts for which no possible military necessity can be  pleaded. They were wilfully committed as part of a deliberately prepared  and scientifically organized policy of terrorism.\"      [Illustration: Painting]    From a Painting by F. Gueldry to illustrate an official report.

THE TRAIL OF THE BEAST IN BELGIUM   91    And now, having considered these outrages as part of the German policy  of terrorism, let us turn to the facts presented by those who made  investigations at first hand in devastated Belgium and Northern France.    Let us first turn to the tragic story of the destruction of Louvain. The  first document comes in the form of a cable sent from the Belgian  Minister of Foreign Affairs under date of August 8,1914:      \"On Tuesday evening a body of German troops who had been driven back  retired in disorder upon the town of Louvain. Germans who were guarding  the town thought that the retiring troops were Belgians and fired upon  them. In order to excuse this mistake the Germans, in spite of the most  energetic denials on the part of the authorities, pretended that  Belgians had fired on the Germans, although all the inhabitants,  including policemen, had been disarmed for more than a week. Without any  examination and without listening to any protest the commanding officer  announced that the town would be immediately destroyed. All inhabitants  had to leave their homes at once; some were made prisoners; women and  children were put into a train of which the destination was unknown;  soldiers with fire bombs set fire to the different quarters of the town;  the splendid Church of St. Pierre, the markets, the university and its  scientific establishments, were given to the flames, and it is probable  that the Hotel de Ville, this celebrated jewel of Gothic art, will also  have disappeared in the disaster. Several notabilities were shot at  sight. Thus a town of 40,000 inhabitants, which, since the fifteenth  century, has been the intellectual and scientific capital of the Low  Countries is a heap of ashes. Americans, many of whom have followed the  course at this illustrious alma mater and have there received such  cordial hospitality, cannot remain insensible to this outrage on the  rights of humanity and civilization which is unprecedented in history.\"      Minister Whitlock made the following report on the same outrage:      \"A violent fusillade broke out simultaneously at various points in the  city (Louvain), notably at the Porte de Bruxelles, Porte de Tirlemont,  Rue Leopold, Rue Marie-Therese, Rue des Joyeuses Entrees. German  soldiers were firing at random in every street and in every direction.  Later fires broke out everywhere, notably in the University building,  the Library, in the old Church of St. Peter, in the Place du Peuple, in  the Rue de la Station, in the Boulevard de Tirlemont, and in the  Chaussee de Tirlemont. On the orders of their chiefs, the German  soldiers would break open the houses and set fire to them, shooting on  the inhabitants who tried to leave their dwellings. Many persons who  took refuge in their cellars were burned to death. The German soldiers  were equipped with apparatus for the purpose of firing dwellings,  incendiary pastils, machines for spraying petroleum, etc. . . .    \"Major von Manteuffel (of the German forces) sent for Alderman Schmidt.  Upon the latter's arrival, the major declared that hostages were to be  held, as sedition had just broken out. He asked Father Parijs, Mr.  Schmidt, and Mgr. Coenraedts, First Vice-Rector of the University, who  was being held as a hostage, to make proclamations to the inhabitants  exhorting them to be calm and menacing them with a fine of twenty  million francs, the destruction of the city and the hanging of the  hostages, if they created disturbance. Surrounded by about thirty  soldiers and a few officers, Major Manteuffel, Father Parijs, Mr.  Schmidt and Mgr. Coenraedts left in the direction of the station, and  the alderman, in French, and the priest, in Flemish, made proclamations  at the street corners.. . .    \"Near the statue of Juste-Lipse, a Dr. Berghausen, a German surgeon, in  a highly excited condition, ran to meet the delegation. He shouted that  a"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/19031"],[0,"A Treatise on Adulterations of Food, and Culinary Poisons (#16)"],[1,"    113       Ginger                   116       Honey                     11    Penalty, 300_l._, and costs; including mixing strong beer with table,  and paying table-beer duty for strong beer, &c.           *       *       *       *       *    Numerous other seizures of illegal substances, made at breweries, might  be advanced, were it necessary to enlarge this subject to a greater  extent.    Mr. James West, from the excise office, being asked in the Committee of  the House of Commons, appointed, 1819, to examine and report on the  petition of several inhabitants of London, complaining of the high price  and inferior quality of beer, produced the following seized  articles:--\"One bladder of honey, one bladder of extract of cocculus  indicus, ground guinea pepper or capsicum, vitriol or copperas, orange  powder, quassia, ground beer-heading, hard multum, another kind of  multum or beer preparation, liquorice powder, and ground grains of  paradise.\"    Witness being asked \"Where did you seize these things?\" Answer, \"Some of  them were seized from brewers, and some of them from brewers'  druggists, within these two years past.\" (May 8, 1818.)    Another fraud frequently committed, both by brewers and publicans, (as  is evident from the Excise Report,) is the practice of adulterating  strong beer with small beer--This fraud is prohibited by law, since both  the revenue and the public suffer by it.[63] \"The duty upon strong beer  is ten shillings a barrel; and upon table beer it is two shillings. The  revenue suffers, because a larger quantity of beer is sold as strong  beer; that is, at a price exceeding the price of table beer, without the  strong beer duty being paid. In the next place, the brewer suffers,  because the retailer gets table or mild beer, and retails it as strong  beer.\" The following are the words of the Act, prohibiting the brewers  mixing table beer with strong beer.    \"If any common brewer shall mix or suffer to be mixed any strong beer,  or strong worts with table beer or table worts, or with water in any  guile or fermenting tun after the declaration of the quantity of such  guile shall have been made; or if he shall at any time mix or suffer to  be mixed strong beer or strong worts with table beer worts or with  water, in any vat, cask, tub, measures or utensil, not being an entered  guile or fermenting tun, he shall forfeit 200 pounds.\"[64]    With respect to the persons who commit this offence, Mr. Carr,[65] the  Solicitor of the Excise, observes, that \"they are generally brewers who  carry on the double trade of brewing both strong and table beer. It is  almost impossible to prevent them from mixing one with the other; and  frauds of very great extent have been detected, and the parties punished  for that offence. One brewer at Plymouth evaded duties to the amount of  32,000 pounds; and other brewers, who brew party guiles of beer,  carrying on the two trades of ale and table beer brewers, where the  trade is a victualling brewer, which is different from the common  brewer, he being a person who sells only wholesale; the victualling  brewer being a brewer and also a seller by retail.\"    \"In the neighbourhood of London,\" Mr. Carr continues, \"more  particularly, I speak from having had great experience, from the  informations and evidence which I have received, that the retailers  carry on a most extensive fraud upon the public, in purchasing stale  table beer, or the bottoms of casks. There are a class of men who go  about and sell such beer at table-beer price to public victuallers, who  mix it in their cellars. If they receive beer from their brewers which  is mild, they purchase stale beer; and if they receive stale beer, they  purchase common table beer for that purpose; and many of the  prosecutions are against retailers for that offence.\" The following may  serve in proof of this statement.      _List of Brewers prosecuted and convicted from 1813 to 1819, for  adulterating Strong Beer with Table Beer._[66]    Thomas Manton and another, brewers, for mixing strong and table beer,  verdict 300_l._    Mark Morrell and another, brewers, for mixing strong and table beer,  20_l._ and costs.

It is necessary to state, that every publican has two sorts of beer sent  to him from the brewer; the one is called _mild_, which is beer sent out  fresh as it is brewed; the other is called _old_; that is, such as is  brewed on purpose for keeping, and which has been kept in store a  twelve-month or eighteen months. The origin of the beer called  _entire_, is thus related by the editor of the Picture of London:  \"Before the year 1730, the malt liquors in general used in London were  ale, beer, and two-penny; and it was customary to call for a pint, or  tankard, of half-and-half, _i.e._ half of ale and half of beer, half of  ale and half of two-penny. In course of time it also became the practice  to call for a pint or tankard of _three-threads_, meaning a third of  ale, beer, and two-penny; and thus the publican had the trouble to go to  three casks, and turn three cocks, for a pint of liquor. To avoid this  inconvenience and waste, a brewer of the name of Harwood conceived the  idea of making a liquor, which should partake of the same united  flavours of ale, beer, and two-penny; he did so, and succeeded, calling  it _entire_, or entire butt, meaning that it was drawn entirely from one  cask or butt; and as it was a very hearty and nourishing liquor, and  supposed to be very suitable for porters and other working people, it  obtained the name of _porter_.\" The system is now altered, and porter is  very generally compounded of two kinds, or rather the same liquor in two  different states, the due admixture of which is palatable, though  neither is good alone. One is _mild_ porter, and the other _stale_  porter; the former is that which has a slightly bitter flavour; the  latter has been kept longer. This mixture the publican adapts to the  palates of his several customers, and effects the mixture very readily,  by means of a machine, containing small pumps worked by handles. In  these are four pumps, but only three spouts, because two of the pumps  throw out at the same spout: one of these two pumps draws the mild, and  the other the stale porter, from the casks down in the cellar; and the  publican, by dexterously changing his hold works either pump, and draws  both kinds of beer at the same spout. An indifferent observer supposes,  that since it all comes from one spout, it is entire butt beer, as the  publican professes over his door, and which has been decided by vulgar  prejudice to be only good porter, though the difference is not easily  distinguished. I have been informed by several eminent brewers, that of  late, a far greater quantity is consumed of mild than of stale beer.    The entire beer of the modern brewer, according to the statement of C.  Barclay,[67] Esq. \"consists of some beer brewed expressly for the  purpose of keeping: it likewise contains a portion of returns from  publicans; a portion of beer from the bottoms of vats; the beer that is  drawn off from the pipes, which convey the beer from one vat to another,  and from one part of the premises to another. This beer is collected and  put into vats. Mr. Barclay also states that it contains a certain  portion of brown stout, which is twenty shillings a barrel dearer than  common beer; and some bottling beer, which is ten shillings a barrel  dearer;[68] and that all these beers, united, are put into vats, and  that it depends upon various circumstances, how long they may remain in  those vats before they become perfectly bright. When bright, this beer  is sent out to the publicans, for their _entire_ beer, and there is  sometimes a small quantity of mild beer mixed with it.\"    The present entire beer, therefore, is a very heterogeneous mixture,  composed of all the waste and spoiled beer of the publicans--the bottoms  of butts--the leavings of the pots--the drippings of the machines for  drawing the beer--the remnants of beer that lay in the leaden pipes of  the brewery, with a portion of brown stout, bottling beer, and mild  beer.    The old or _entire_ beer we have examined, as obtained from Messrs.  Barclay's, and other eminent London brewers, is unquestionably a good  compound; but it does no longer appear to be necessary, among fraudulent  brewers, to brew beer on purpose for keeping, or to keep it twelve or  eighteen months.
