This young man might be her rival, but his demeanor on  the eve of perilous times appealed to her. That was the spirit  she liked and admired--that reckless acceptance of whatever might  come. It was the spirit in which she herself had gone into the  affair and she was pleased to find that it animated Ashe  also--though, to be sure, it had its drawbacks. It made his  rivalry the more dangerous. This reflection injected a touch of  the old hostility into her manner.    \"I wonder whether you will continue to feel so brave.\"    \"What do you mean?\"    Joan perceived that she was in danger of going too far. She had  no wish to unmask Ashe at the expense of revealing her own  secret. She must resist the temptation to hint that she had  discovered his.    \"I meant,\" she said quickly, \"that from what I have seen of him  Mr. Peters seems likely to be a rather trying man to work for.\"    Ashe's face cleared. For a moment he had almost suspected that  she had guessed his errand.    \"Yes. I imagine he will be. He is what you might call  quick-tempered. He has dyspepsia, you know.\"    \"I know.\"    \"What he wants is plenty of fresh air and no cigars, and a  regular course of those Larsen Exercises that amused you so  much.\"    Joan laughed.    \"Are you going to try and persuade Mr. Peters to twist himself  about like that? Do let me see it if you do.\"    \"I wish I could.\"    \"Do suggest it to him.\"    \"Don't you think he would resent it from a valet?\"    \"I keep forgetting that you are a valet. You look so unlike one.\"    \"Old Peters didn't think so. He rather complimented me on my  appearance. He said I was ordinary-looking.\"    \"I shouldn't have called you that. You look so very strong and  fit.\"    \"Surely there are muscular valets?\"    \"Well, yes; I suppose there are.\"    Ashe looked at her. He was thinking that never in his life had he  seen a girl so amazingly pretty. What it was that she had done to  herself was beyond him; but something, some trick of dress, had  given her a touch of the demure that made her irresistible. She  was dressed in sober black, the ideal background for her  fairness.    \"While on the subject,\" he said, \"I suppose you know you don't  look in the least like a lady's maid? You look like a disguised  princess.\"    She laughed.    \"That's very nice of you, Mr. Marson, but you're quite wrong.  Anyone could tell I was a lady's maid, a mile away. You aren't  criticizing the dress, surely?\"    \"The dress is all right. It's the general effect. I don't think  your expression is right. It's--it's--there's too much attack in  it. You aren't meek enough.\"    Joan's eyes opened wide.    \"Meek! Have you ever seen an English lady's maid, Mr. Marson?\"    \"Why, no; now that I come to think of it, I don't believe I  have.\"    \"Well, let me tell you that meekness is her last quality. Why  should she be meek? Doesn't she go in after the groom of the  chambers?\"    \"Go in? Go in where?\"    \"In to dinner.\" She smiled at the sight of his bewildered face.  \"I'm afraid you don't know much about the etiquette of the new  world you have entered so rashly. Didn't you know that the rules  of precedence among the servants of a big house in England are  more rigid and complicated than in English society?\"    \"You're joking!\"    \"I'm not joking. You try going in to dinner out of your proper  place when we get to Blandings and see what happens. A public  rebuke from the butler is the least you could expect.\"    A bead of perspiration appeared on Ashe's forehead.    \"Heavens!\" he whispered. \"If a butler publicly rebuked me I think  I should commit suicide. I couldn't survive it.\"    He stared, with fallen jaw, into the abyss of horror into which  he had leaped so light-heartedly. The servant problem, on this  large scale, had been nonexistent for him until now. In the days  of his youth, at Mayling, Massachusetts, his needs had been  ministered to by a muscular Swede. Later, at Oxford, there had  been his \"scout\" and his bed maker, harmless persons both,  provided you locked up your whisky. And in London, his last  phase, a succession of servitors of the type of the disheveled  maid at Number Seven had tended him.    That, dotted about the land of his adoption, there were houses in  which larger staffs of domestics were maintained, he had been  vaguely aware. Indeed, in \"Gridley Quayle, Investigator; the  Adventure of the Missing Marquis\"--number four of the series--he  had drawn a picture of the home life of a duke, in which a butler  and two powdered footmen had played their parts; but he had had  no idea that rigid and complicated rules of etiquette swayed the  private lives of these individuals. If he had given the matter a  thought he had supposed that when the dinner hour arrived the  butler and the two footmen would troop into the kitchen and  squash in at the table wherever they found room.    \"Tell me,\" he said. \"Tell me all you know. I feel as though I had  escaped a frightful disaster.\"    \"You probably have. I don't suppose there is anything so terrible  as a snub from a butler.\"    \"If there is I can't think of it. When I was at Oxford I used to  go and stay with a friend of mine who had a butler that looked  like a Roman emperor in swallowtails. He terrified me. I used to  grovel to the man. Please give me all the pointers you can.\"    \"Well, as Mr. Peters' valet, I suppose you will be rather a big  man.\"    \"I shan't feel it.\"    \"However large the house party is, Mr. Peters is sure to be the  principal guest; so your standing will be correspondingly  magnificent. You come after the butler, the housekeeper, the  groom of the chambers, Lord Emsworth's valet, Lady Ann  Warblington's lady's maid--\"    \"Who is she?\"    \"Lady Ann? Lord Emsworth's sister. She has lived with him since  his wife died. What was I saying? Oh, yes! After them come the  honorable Frederick Threepwood's valet and myself--and then you.\"    \"I'm not so high up then, after all?\"    \"Yes, you are. There's a whole crowd who come after you. It all  depends on how many other guests there are besides Mr. Peters.\"    \"I suppose I charge in at the head of a drove of housemaids and  scullery maids?\"    \"My dear Mr. Marson, if a housemaid or a scullery maid tried to  get into the steward's room and have her meals with us, she would  be--\"    \"Rebuked by the butler?\"    \"Lynched, I should think. Kitchen maids and scullery maids eat in  the kitchen. Chauffeurs, footmen, under-butler, pantry boys, hall  boy, odd man and steward's-room footman take their meals in the  servants' hall, waited on by the hall boy. The stillroom maids  have breakfast and tea in the stillroom, and dinner and supper in  the hall. The housemaids and nursery maids have breakfast and tea  in the housemaid's sitting-room, and dinner and supper in the  hall. The head housemaid ranks next to the head stillroom maid.  The laundry maids have a place of their own near the laundry, and  the head laundry maid ranks above the head housemaid. The chef  has his meals in a room of his own near the kitchen. Is there  anything else I can tell you, Mr. Marson?\"    Ashe was staring at her with vacant eyes. He shook his head  dumbly.    \"We stop at Swindon in half an hour,\" said Joan softly. \"Don't  you think you would be wise to get out there and go straight back  to London, Mr. Marson? Think of all you would avoid!\"    Ashe found speech.    \"It's a nightmare!\"    \"You would be far happier in Arundell Street. Why don't you get  out at Swindon and go back?\"    Ashe shook his head.    \"I can't. There's--there's a reason.\"    Joan picked up her magazine again. Hostility had come out from  the corner into which she had tucked it away and was once more  filling her mind. She knew it was illogical, but she could not  help it. For a moment, during her revelations of servants'  etiquette, she had allowed herself to hope that she had  frightened her rival out of the field, and the disappointment  made her feel irritable. She buried herself in a short story, and  countered Ashe's attempts at renewing the conversation with cold  monosyllables, until he ceased his efforts and fell into a moody  silence.    He was feeling hurt and angry. Her sudden coldness, following on  the friendliness with which she had talked so long, puzzled and  infuriated him. He felt as though he had been snubbed, and for no  reason.    He resented the defensive magazine, though he had bought it for  her himself. He resented her attitude of having ceased to  recognize his existence. A sadness, a filmy melancholy, crept  over him. He brooded on the unutterable silliness of humanity,  especially the female portion of it, in erecting artificial  barriers to friendship. It was so unreasonable.    At their first meeting, when she might have been excused for  showing defensiveness, she had treated him with unaffected ease.  When that meeting had ended there was a tacit understanding  between them that all the preliminary awkwardnesses of the first  stages of acquaintanceship were to be considered as having been  passed; and that when they met again, if they ever did, it would  be as friends. And here she was, luring him on with apparent  friendliness, and then withdrawing into herself as though he had  presumed.    A rebellious spirit took possession of him. He didn't care! Let  her be cold and distant. He would show her that she had no  monopoly of those qualities. He would not speak to her until she  spoke to him; and when she spoke to him he would freeze her with  his courteous but bleakly aloof indifference.    The train rattled on. Joan read her magazine. Silence reigned in  the second-class compartment. Swindon was reached and passed.  Darkness fell on the land. The journey began to seem interminable  to Ashe; but presently there came a creaking of brakes and the  train jerked itself to another stop. A voice on the platform made  itself heard, calling:    \"Marke"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/20426"],[0,"Form and Function: A Contribution to the History of Animal Morphology (#16)"],[1," if Geoffroy had developed his views on  evolution he would finally have been led to interpret unity of plan in  terms of genetic relationship. But as it was he remained at his  morphological standpoint. He did not interpret rudimentary organs as  useless heritages of the past; he preferred to think that Nature had  prepared double means for the same function, one or other being  predominant according as the animal lived in the water or on the land.  \"To the animal that lives exclusively in the air Nature has granted an  organisation suited to this mode of respiration, without however  suppressing the other corresponding means, that is to say, without  depriving it of a second system which is applicable only to the mode of  respiration by the intermediary of water, and _vice versa_.\"[105]    He seems, in one instance at least, to have hit upon the root-idea of  the biogenetic law, but he was far from appreciating its significance.  He recognised that an amphibian in its development passed through a  stage when it was in all essentials similar to a fish, and he saw in  this visible transformation a picture of the evolutionary  transformation. \"An amphibian,\" he writes,[106] \"is at first a fish under  the name of tadpole, and then a reptile [_sic_] under that of frog....  In this observed fact is realised what we have above represented as an  hypothesis, the transformation of one organic stage into the stage  immediately superior.\" But it is not clear that he considered the  development of the amphibian to be a _repetition_ of its ancestral  history.    He went, however, a certain length towards recognising the main  principle of a law which was a commonplace of German transcendental  thought, and was developed later by his disciple E. Serres, the law that  the higher animals repeat during their development the main features of  the adult organisation of animals lower in the scale. Thus he compared  fish as regards certain parts of their structure with the foetus of  mammals. He compared also Articulates with embryonic Vertebrates in  respect of their vertebrae, for in the higher Vertebrates the body of the  vertebra is tubular at an early stage of development, and in Articulates  the body of the vertebra remains tubular permanently (_supra_, p. 61).  As regards their vertebrae, \"insects occupy a place in the series of the  ages and developments of the vertebrate animals, that is to say, they  realise one of the states of their embryo, as fishes do one of the  states of their foetal condition.\"[107]    This idea was destined to exercise a great influence upon the  development of morphology. A further development of the thought is that  certain abnormalities in the higher animals, resulting from arrest of  development, represent states of organisation which are permanent in the  lower animals.[108]    So far we have considered Geoffroy's theories in their application to  the facts. We go on to discuss the theories themselves, and the general  conception of living things which underlies them.    The principle of unity of plan and composition is the keynote of  Geoffroy's work. It states that the same materials of organisation are  to be found in all animals, and that these materials stand always in the  same general spatial relations to one another. The \"materials of  organisation\" are not necessarily organs in the physiological sense, and  indeed the principle of the unity of plan cannot be upheld if the unity  has reference to organs only. This became clear to Geoffroy, especially  in his later years. In 1835 he wrote, speaking of the principle of the  unity of plan, \"I have, moreover, regenerated this principle, and  obtained for it universality of application, by showing that it is not  always the organs as a whole, but merely the materials composing each  organ, that can be reduced to unity.\"[109] Even in the _Philosophie  anatomique_ he deals rather with parts than with organs; he deals, for  instance, with the elementary parts of the sternum, not with the organ  \"sternum\" in its totality. The functions of the sternum vary, and the  primary protective function of the sternum may be assumed by quite other  parts, _e.g._, by the clavicles in fish, which protect the heart.[110]    True homologies can be established between materials of organisation but  not always between organs, which may be composed of different  \"materials.\"    Almost as a corollary to this comes the further view that form is of  little importance in determining homologies. An organ is essentially an  instrument for doing a particular kind of work, and its form is  determined by its function. Organs which perform the same function are  usually similar in form though the elementary materials composing them  may be different. This is seen in many cases of convergence. Organs,  therefore, which perform the same function and are similar in external  form are not necessary homologous. Conversely, the same complex of  materials, say a fore limb, may take on the most varied shapes according  as the function of the organ changes--but homology remains though form  changes. Accordingly, form is one of the least important elements to be  considered in determining a homology. \"Nature,\" he wrote in one of his  early papers, \"tends to repeat the same organs in the same number and in  the same relations, and varies to infinity only their form. In  accordance with this principle I shall have to draw my conclusions, in  the determining the bones of the fish's skull, not from a consideration  of their form, but from a consideration of their connections.\"[111]    Again, after comparing a vertebra of the Aurochs with an abdominal  segment of the crab, he says, \"I have insisted upon an identity which  has extended to the least important relation of all, that of form.\"[112]    Geoffroy's morphological units or materials of organisation were in the  case of the skeleton--with which his researches principally deal--the  single bones. But the interesting point is that he sought his  skeleton-units in the embryo, and considered each separate centre of  ossification as a separate bone. Coalescence of bones originally  separate is one of the most usual events in development, and it is an  occurrence which, more than any other, tends to obscure homologies.  Because of its coalescence with the maxillaries, the intermaxillary in  man was not discovered until Vicq d'Azyr and Goethe found it separate in  the embryo. Apparently quite independently of Goethe, Geoffroy hit upon  this plan of seeking in the embryo the primary elements or materials of  organisation. In an early paper on the skull of Vertebrates,[113] where he  is concerned with showing that each bone of the fish's skull has its  homologue in the skull of higher Vertebrates, he is faced with the  difficulty that the skull of the fish has more bones than the skull of  higher Vertebrates. \"Having had the inspiration,\" he writes, \"to reckon  as many bones as there are distinct centres of ossification, and having  made a consistent trial of this method, I have been able to appreciate  the correctness of the idea: fish, in their earliest stages, are in the  same conditions relatively to their development as the foetuses of  mammals, and hence bear out the theory\" (p. 344). So, too, in dealing  with the homologies of the sternal elements (_supra_, p. 57) he treats  as separate bones the \"annexes\" of the sternum in birds, though these  are separate only in the young.    If the same materials of organisation are present in all animals, and if  they are arranged always in the same positions relatively to one  another, how does it come about that animal forms are so varied, what  explanation can be offered of the diversities of organic structure?  Geoffroy's main answer to this question is his _Loi de balancement_. The  law was enunciated by him already in 1807.[114] We take the following  quotation, which represents his thought most nearly, from the _Cours de  l'histoire naturelle des Mammiferes_ (1829). \"According to our manner of  regarding the organisation of mammals, there is only a single animal  modified by the inverse reciprocal variation of all or some of its  parts. Now, from the fact that there is only one single general animal,  it follows that for each section of its components or for each of its  organs there is available only a given quantity of formative materials.  Now suppose that the distribution of these materials has not been made  in such a way as to ensure an exact equilibrium between all the parts  concerned, one organ will get more than its share, another less. My law  of the compensation of organs is founded on these principles\" (i.,  _Lecon_ 16, p. 12). \"The atrophy of one organ turns to the profit of  another; and the reason why this cannot be otherwise is simple, it is  because there is not an unlimited supply of the substance required for  each special purpose.\"[115] The nutritive material available is limited  for each species; if one part gets more than its share the other parts  must get less--that is all the law means. As an example, take the  minuteness of the episternals and xiphisternals in birds, as contrasted  with the huge size of the entosternal. \"The minuteness of the  episternals and xiphisternals might be imputed to this gigantic piece  diverting to its own profit the nutritive fluid, since the bigger it is  the smaller these are.\"[116]    One has constantly to remember in dealing with Geoffroy's theories that  he was not an evolutionist, but purely a morphologist. It is therefore,  perhaps, to ask too much to require of him an explanation of the causes  of diversity. The morphologist describes, classifies, generalises; he  does not seek for causes. But we must leave this question aside in order  to discuss how far Geoffroy's theory of the unity of plan and  composition fits the facts. As Geoffroy himself admitted on several  occasions, his theory was an _a priori_ one, a"]]]
