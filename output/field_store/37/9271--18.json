[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/17897"],[0,"Summa Theologica, Part I-II (Pars Prima Secundae) (#16)"],[1,"of Happiness can be had in  this life: but perfect and true Happiness cannot be had in this life.  This may be seen from a twofold consideration.    First, from the general notion of happiness. For since happiness is a  \"perfect and sufficient good,\" it excludes every evil, and fulfils  every desire. But in this life every evil cannot be excluded. For  this present life is subject to many unavoidable evils; to ignorance  on the part of the intellect; to inordinate affection on the part of  the appetite, and to many penalties on the part of the body; as  Augustine sets forth in De Civ. Dei xix, 4. Likewise neither can the  desire for good be satiated in this life. For man naturally desires  the good, which he has, to be abiding. Now the goods of the present  life pass away; since life itself passes away, which we naturally  desire to have, and would wish to hold abidingly, for man naturally  shrinks from death. Wherefore it is impossible to have true Happiness  in this life.    Secondly, from a consideration of the specific nature of Happiness,  viz. the vision of the Divine Essence, which man cannot obtain in  this life, as was shown in the First Part (Q. 12, A. 11). Hence it is  evident that none can attain true and perfect Happiness in this life.    Reply Obj. 1: Some are said to be happy in this life, either on  account of the hope of obtaining Happiness in the life to come,  according to Rom. 8:24: \"We are saved by hope\"; or on account of a  certain participation of Happiness, by reason of a kind of enjoyment  of the Sovereign Good.    Reply Obj. 2: The imperfection of participated Happiness is due to  one of two causes. First, on the part of the object of Happiness,  which is not seen in Its Essence: and this imperfection destroys the  nature of true Happiness. Secondly, the imperfection may be on the  part of the participator, who indeed attains the object of Happiness,  in itself, namely, God: imperfectly, however, in comparison with the  way in which God enjoys Himself. This imperfection does not destroy  the true nature of Happiness; because, since Happiness is an  operation, as stated above (Q. 3, A. 2), the true nature of Happiness  is taken from the object, which specifies the act, and not from the  subject.    Reply Obj. 3: Men esteem that there is some kind of happiness to be  had in this life, on account of a certain likeness to true Happiness.  And thus they do not fail altogether in their estimate.  ________________________    FOURTH ARTICLE [I-II, Q. 5, Art. 4]    Whether Happiness Once Had Can Be Lost?    Objection 1: It would seem that Happiness can be lost. For Happiness  is a perfection. But every perfection is in the thing perfected  according to the mode of the latter. Since then man is, by his  nature, changeable, it seems that Happiness is participated by man in  a changeable manner. And consequently it seems that man can lose  Happiness.    Obj. 2: Further, Happiness consists in an act of the intellect; and  the intellect is subject to the will. But the will can be directed to  opposites. Therefore it seems that it can desist from the operation  whereby man is made happy: and thus man will cease to be happy.    Obj. 3: Further, the end corresponds to the beginning. But man's  Happiness has a beginning, since man was not always happy. Therefore  it seems that it has an end.    _On the contrary,_ It is written (Matt. 25:46) of the righteous that  \"they shall go . . . into life everlasting,\" which, as above stated  (A. 2), is the Happiness of the saints. Now what is eternal ceases  not. Therefore Happiness cannot be lost.    _I answer that,_ If we speak of imperfect happiness, such as can be  had in this life, in this sense it can be lost. This is clear of  contemplative happiness, which is lost either by forgetfulness, for  instance, when knowledge is lost through sickness; or again by  certain occupations, whereby a man is altogether withdrawn from  contemplation.    This is also clear of active happiness: since man's will can be  changed so as to fall to vice from the virtue, in whose act that  happiness principally consists. If, however, the virtue remain  unimpaired, outward changes can indeed disturb such like happiness,  in so far as they hinder many acts of virtue; but they cannot take it  away altogether because there still remains an act of virtue, whereby  man bears these trials in a praiseworthy manner. And since the  happiness of this life can be lost, a circumstance that appears to be  contrary to the nature of happiness, therefore did the Philosopher  state (Ethic. i, 10) that some are happy in this life, not simply,  but \"as men,\" whose nature is subject to change.    But if we speak of that perfect Happiness which we await after this  life, it must be observed that Origen (Peri Archon. ii, 3), following  the error of certain Platonists, held that man can become unhappy  after the final Happiness.    This, however, is evidently false, for two reasons. First, from the  general notion of happiness. For since happiness is the \"perfect and  sufficient good,\" it must needs set man's desire at rest and exclude  every evil. Now man naturally desires to hold to the good that he  has, and to have the surety of his holding: else he must of necessity  be troubled with the fear of losing it, or with the sorrow of knowing  that he will lose it. Therefore it is necessary for true Happiness  that man have the assured opinion of never losing the good that he  possesses. If this opinion be true, it follows that he never will  lose happiness: but if it be false, it is in itself an evil that he  should have a false opinion: because the false is the evil of the  intellect, just as the true is its good, as stated in _Ethic._ vi, 2.  Consequently he will no longer be truly happy, if evil be in him.    Secondly, it is again evident if we consider the specific nature of  Happiness. For it has been shown above (Q. 3, A. 8) that man's  perfect Happiness consists in the vision of the Divine Essence. Now  it is impossible for anyone seeing the Divine Essence, to wish not to  see It. Because every good that one possesses and yet wishes to be  without, is either insufficient, something more sufficing being  desired in its stead; or else has some inconvenience attached to it,  by reason of which it becomes wearisome. But the vision of the Divine  Essence fills the soul with all good things, since it unites it to  the source of all goodness; hence it is written (Ps. 16:15): \"I shall  be satisfied when Thy glory shall appear\"; and (Wis. 7:11): \"All good  things came to me together with her,\" i.e. with the contemplation of  wisdom. In like manner neither has it any inconvenience attached to  it; because it is written of the contemplation of wisdom (Wis. 8:16):  \"Her conversation hath no bitterness, nor her company any  tediousness.\" It is thus evident that the happy man cannot forsake  Happiness of his own accord. Moreover, neither can he lose Happiness,  through God taking it away from him. Because, since the withdrawal of  Happiness is a punishment, it cannot be enforced by God, the just  Judge, except for some fault; and he that sees God cannot fall into a  fault, since rectitude of the will, of necessity, results from that  vision as was shown above (Q. 4, A. 4). Nor again can it be withdrawn  by any other agent. Because the mind that is united to God is raised  above all other things: and consequently no other agent can sever the  mind from that union. Therefore it seems unreasonable that as time  goes on, man should pass from happiness to misery, and vice versa;  because such like vicissitudes of time can only be for such things as  are subject to time and movement.    Reply Obj. 1: Happiness is consummate perfection, which excludes  every defect from the happy. And therefore whoever has happiness has  it altogether unchangeably: this is done by the Divine power, which  raises man to the participation of eternity which transcends all  change.    Reply Obj. 2: The will can be directed to opposites, in things which  are ordained to the end; but it is ordained, of natural necessity, to  the last end. This is evident from the fact that man is unable not to  wish to be happy.    Reply Obj. 3: Happiness has a beginning owing to the condition of the  participator: but it has no end by reason of the condition of the  good, the participation of which makes man happy. Hence the beginning  of happiness is from one cause, its endlessness is from another.  ________________________    FIFTH ARTICLE [I-II, Q. 5, Art. 5]    Whether Man Can Attain Happiness by His Natural Powers?    Objection 1: It would seem that man can attain Happiness by his  natural powers. For nature does not fail in necessary things. But  nothing is so necessary to man as that by which he attains the last  end. Therefore this is not lacking to human nature. Therefore man  can attain Happiness by his natural powers.    Obj. 2: Further, since man is more noble than irrational creatures,  it seems that he must be better equipped than they. But irrational  creatures can attain their end by their natural powers. Much more  therefore can man attain Happiness by his natural powers.    Obj. 3: Further, Happiness is a \"perfect operation,\" according to the  Philosopher (Ethic. vii, 13). Now the beginning of a thing belongs to  the same principle as the perfecting thereof. Since, therefore, the  imperfect operation, which is as the beginning in human operations,  is subject to man's natural power, whereby he is master of his own  actions; it seems that he can attain to perfect operation, i.e.  Happiness, by his natural powers.    _On the contrary,_ Man is naturally the principle of his action, by  his intellect and will. But final Happiness prepared for the saints,  surpasses the intellect and will of man; for the Apostle says (1 Cor.  2:9) \"Eye hath not seen, nor ear heard, neither hath it entered into  the heart of man, what things God hath "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/17910"],[0,"The Mafulu: Mountain People of British New Guinea (#16)"],[1,"_bilage_. The expression  _a-gata_ signifies absence of any connection, and a man will refer  to a member of another community, Mafulu, Kuni, Ambo, or anything  else (there is no distinction between these in the use of the term)  as being _a-gata_, thereby meaning that he is an outsider.    This brings me to the question of the use by me of the term \"clan\" to  designate the intimate association above referred to. To begin with,  there is a considerable difference between the situation produced by  the clan system, if it may be regarded as such, of Mafulu and that of,  say, Mekeo, where one finds several clans occupying one village, and  where members of one clan may be scattered over several more or less  distant villages; though this latter difference might perhaps arise in  part from natural geographical causes, the flat lowlands of the Mekeo  people being highly favourable to inter-village communication over  their whole areas, and to the holding of their recognised and numerous  markets, whilst it may almost be assumed that such intercommunication  would be more restricted, at all events in days gone by, among the  Mafulu inhabitants of the mountains.    Then again in Mafulu there are no clan badges, nor are there any  realistic or conventional representations of, or designs which can  to my mind be possibly regarded as representing, or having had their  origin in the representation of, animals, birds, fishes, plants,  or anything else. As regards this, however, it may be mentioned  that the Mafulu people are very primitive and undeveloped, and have  not in their art any designs which could readily partake of this  imitative character, their artistic efforts never producing curves,  and indeed not going beyond geometric designs composed of straight  lines, rectangular and zig-zag patterns and spots.    Also I was unable to discover the faintest trace of any idea  which might be regarded as being totemistic, or having a totemistic  origin. In particular, although enquiry was made from ten independent  and trustworthy native sources, I could not find a trace of any system  of general clan taboo against the killing or the eating of any animal,  bird, fish, or plant. It is true that there are various temporary  food taboos associated with special conditions and events, and that  there are certain things the eating of which is regarded as permanently  taboo to certain individuals; but the former of these restrictions are  general and are not associated with particular clans or communities,  and the latter restrictions relate separately to the individuals only,  and apparently are based in each case on the fact that the food has  been found to disagree with him; though whether the restriction is  the result of mere common sense based upon individual experience,  or has in it an element of superstition as to something which may be  harmful to the individual concerned, is a point upon which I could  not get satisfactory explanation.    Again, still dealing with the question of totemism, I may say that  the community and village names (as already stated, there are no  clan names) do not appear to be referable to any possible totemistic  objects. There is no specific ancestor worship, in connection with  which I could endeavour to trace out an association between that  ancestor and a totemistic object, and there is no special reverence  paid to any animal or vegetable, except certain trees and creepers,  the fear of which is associated with spirits and ghosts generally,  and not with ghosts of individual persons, and except as regards  omen superstitions concerning flying foxes and fireflies, which are  general and universal among all these people, and except as regards  the possible imitative character of the Mafulu dancing, which, if  existent, is probably also universal.    Moreover, I was told that now, at any rate, the people regard their  _imbele_ or clan relationship as a social one, as well as one of  actual blood, a statement which is illustrated by the fact that,  if a member of one clan leaves his village to reside permanently in a  village of another clan, he will regard the members of the latter clan,  and will himself be regarded by them, as being _imbele_, although he  does not part with the continuing _imbele_ connection between himself  and the other members of his original clan.    On the other hand the association between members of a clan  is exceedingly close, so much so that a serious injury done by  an outsider to one member of a clan (_e.g._, his murder, or the  case of his wife eloping with a stranger and her family refusing to  compensate him for the price which he had paid for her on marriage)  is taken up by the entire clan, who will join the injured individual  in full force to inflict retribution; and, as already stated, the  members of a clan share in one common chief and one common _emone_,  intermarriage between them is regarded as wrong, and apparently each  group of villages occupied by a single clan has in origin been a single  village, and may well have a common descent. I think, therefore, that  I am justified in regarding these internal sections of a community  as clans.      Chiefs, Sub-Chiefs and Notables and Their Emone    At the head of each clan is the _amidi_, or chief of the clan. He is,  and is recognised as being, the only true chief.    He is the most important personage of his clan, and is treated  with the respect due to his office; but, though he takes a leading  part in all matters affecting the clan, he is not a person with any  administrative or judicial functions, and he has no power of punishment  or control over the members of the clan. In public ceremonial matters  of importance, however, he has functions which rest primarily upon him  alone, and he does, in fact, always perform these functions in his own  village; and on the occasion of a big feast (as to which see below),  he does so in whatever village of the clan that feast may be held.    The chief lives in one of the villages of the clan, but may have  houses in other villages of that clan also. In the village in which  he mainly resides is his _emone_ or club-house, which is the only  true _emone_ of the clan; and for the upkeep and repair of this he is  responsible. This is the ceremonial _emone_ in his own village, and  is always the one used in connection with the ceremony of a big feast  in any village of the clan; and, if the feast be held in a village  other than that in which is his then existing _emone_, another one is  built in that village in lieu of his former one in the other village.    There is not in connection with these chiefs and their ceremonies any  distinctive difference in importance between the right and the left  as regards the positions occupied by them on the _emone_ platform or  the structure of the _emone_, such as is found among the Roro people.    Next in rank to the chief, and at the head of each village of the clan,  there is a sub-chief, or _em' u babe_, this term meaning \"father of the  village.\" He is not regarded as a true chief, but he is entitled, and  it is his duty, to perform in his own village all the functions of the  chief, except those connected with the big feast. He and the similar  sub-chiefs of the other villages of the clan are the persons who take  the prominent part in supporting the chief in any ceremonial function  concerning the whole clan in which the latter may be engaged, and in  particular at the big feast. The _em' u babe_ is usually a relative  of the chief, and at all events is an important personage. He also  has in his own village his _emone_, which is the principal _emone_  of that village, and is used for all ceremonial functions in that  village except the big feast, but it is not regarded as being a true  _emone_. The chief holds in his own village of residence both his  office of _amidi_ and that of _em' u babe_, there being no other  person holding the latter office in that village.    Next in rank to the sub-chiefs come a number of _ake baibe_, which  means \"great men.\" These are the leading people--the aristocracy--of  the clan. There are no distinctive social grades of rank among  them. Their number is often very large in proportion to the total  number of male inhabitants of a village; indeed sometimes almost  every member of a village will claim to belong to this class. These  people are in no sense office-bearers, and have no special duties  to perform, though on a ceremonial occasion they are entitled to  have their importance borne in mind. Each of them also is entitled  to have an _emone_ (here again not a true _emone_) in his village,  but in fact their numbers often make this practically impossible,  and you rarely see more than two or three _emone_ in one village.    The above are all the chiefs and notables of the clan. There is no  such thing as a war chief.    Aristocracy in its various forms is not a condition to which a man  attains on getting older--it is attained by inheritance.    The office of the chief is hereditary in the male line by strict  rules of descent and primogeniture. On the death of a chief his office  descends to his eldest son, or if that son has died leaving children,  it descends to the eldest son of that son, and so on for subsequent  generations. Failing the eldest son or male issue in the male line  of the eldest son, the office devolves upon the late chiefs second  son or his male issue in the male line. And so on for other sons  and their issue. Failing such male issue the office passes to a  collateral relation of the late chief on his father's side (_e.g._,  the late chief's next eldest brother or that brother's son, or the  late chief's second brother or that brother's son), the ascertainment  of the devolution being based upon a general principle of nearest  male relationship in the male line and primogeniture. [58]    The chief holds his office for life, but he may in his lifetime  "]]]
