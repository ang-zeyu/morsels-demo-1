'That may well be,' said Beaumains, 'and the more desire I have to see  him.'    'Thou fool!' cried the lady angrily. 'Thou hadst better turn and flee  while there is time.'    'Not a step will I,' replied he with a laugh. 'For, look you, if he be  so lordly a knight as you say, he will not set his five hundred knights  on me at once. But if he will send but one against me at a time, I will  do my best till my strength goes from me. No man, be he knave or  knight, can do more.'    At his quiet brave words the lady's heart smote her. She repented of  her evil tongue, when she thought how valiant and true this unknown man  had been on her behalf.    'Sir,' she said in a gentler voice, 'ye make me marvel. Thou hast  spoken boldly, and, by my faith, thou hast done boldly, and that makes  me wonder of what kin thou art. But as ye are so brave, and have done,  you and your horse, great travail these three days, I misdoubt that ye  will get hurt if ye go further. Therefore I bid you turn, or ever it be  too late.'    'Nay, I will not,' said Beaumains. 'It would be a great shame that now,  when we are but a few miles from your lady sister's oppressor, I should  turn back.'    'But, sir, I counsel ye to do so,' said the lady. 'For the strength of  Sir Persaunt, even if ye conquer him, is but little compared with the  great strength of the Red Knight who doth oppress my sister. And I am  sure you have little hope of overcoming him.'    'Nevertheless, lady, I will essay to conquer him,' said Beaumains, 'for  it is but my duty and my desire to rescue your lady sister as I have  resolved.'    'I marvel what manner of man ye be,' said the lady. 'It must be that ye  come of noble blood, for no woman could have spoken or treated you more  evilly than I have done. Yet ever you have courteously suffered all I  said.'    'Lady, it is but a man's duty to suffer a woman's wayward words,' said  Beaumains, 'and they have not been without service to me. For the more  ye angered me the more strength of wrath I put into my blows, and so  was enabled to overcome your enemies. And as to what I am and whence I  came, I could have had meat in other places than in King Arthur's  kitchen, but all that I have done was to try my friends. And whether I  be knave or gentleman, I have done you gentleman's service.'    'That is truth, Sir Beaumains,' said the lady, all soft and penitent  now, 'and I beg of you forgiveness for all my evil words.'    'I forgive ye with all my heart,' said Sir Beaumains, 'and I tell you,  lady, that now that you speak kindly to me, it gladdens me greatly, and  I feel that there is no knight living whom I could not strike down for  the sake of yourself and your lady sister.'    By this time Sir Persaunt had seen them, and had sent a squire to ask  Beaumains whether he came in peace or war.    'If he will not let us pass,' replied Beaumains, 'it shall be war.'    At that they saw Sir Persaunt array himself in his armour and mount his  horse, and now he came rushing across the field at utmost speed, his  lance in rest. Beaumains also made his horse leap forward swiftly, and  the two knights met with so great a force that both their lances  splintered in many pieces, and their horses fell dead upon the field.    But the two knights instantly disentangled themselves, and fought on  foot with shield and sword. So furiously did they hurl themselves at  each other that often they fell to the ground. For two hours the duel  raged, till their hauberks were tattered and their shields were hacked,  while both were sorely bruised and wounded.    At length Beaumains thrust Sir Persaunt in the side, and the latter's  attack became less eager. Finally Beaumains hit the other so great a  stroke that he fell headlong, and instantly Beaumains leaped astride of  him and unlashed his helm, as if about to slay him.    Then Sir Persaunt yielded him and pleaded for his life, and the lady,  who had stood watching the combat, ran forward, placed her hand on Sir  Beaumains' sword arm, and cried:    'Of your mercy, Sir Beaumains, yield him his life for my sake.'    'I do it willingly,' cried he, helping the knight to rise, 'for he hath  nobly fought and so deserves not to die.'    'Gramercy,' said Sir Persaunt, 'and now I know thou art the strong  knight who slew my brothers the Black Knight of the Thorn and the Green  Knight of the Wood. And now I will be your man, and five hundred  knights of mine shall do your service as and when you will.'    And that night they supped bounteously in Sir Persaunt's castle, and  the lady besought Beaumains to sit by her at the same table, and all  three made merry company.    In the morning, after they had heard mass and broken their fast,  Beaumains and the lady set out again, and Sir Persaunt went with them  to the drawbridge.    'Fair lady,' said he, 'where dost thou lead this valiant knight?'    'Sir,' said the lady, 'he is going to raise the siege which hath been  set by the tyrant knight of the Reed Lands.'    'Ah, then he goes to Castle Dangerous, and on the most perilous  adventure that any man could take. For they say the Red Knight hath the  strength of seven men. And he doth oppress one of the fairest and  sweetest ladies in the world. I think you are her sister, Dame Linet?'    'That is my name,' replied the lady, 'and my sister is Dame Lyones.'    'This Red Knight is the most dangerous knight in the world,' said Sir  Persaunt to Beaumains, 'and hath besieged that fair lady these two  years. Many times he might have forced her for terror to have married  him, but he keeps the siege in hopes that Sir Lancelot or even King  Arthur would come to rescue the lady. For he hateth all true knights,  but those two with most bitterness.'    So they parted from Sir Persaunt and rode onwards, and the lady spoke  now full friendly to Beaumains.    In a little while, when they had passed through a fair forest, they  came upon a plain, and in the distance was a high castle with many  tents about it, and men passing to and fro between them. And as they  rode under some withered trees by the edge of the forest, they saw,  hanging by their necks from the bare boughs, many goodly knights in  armour, with their shields and swords hung before them.    At this shameful sight Beaumains checked his horse and asked: 'What  means this?'    'Fair sir,' said Linet, 'abate not your cheer at this dreadful sight,  for ye have need now of all your courage, or else are we all shamed and  destroyed. These dead knights are those who have come against the Red  Knight trying to rescue my sister from his power. But the tyrant knight  hath overcome them, and slain them thus shamefully by hanging.'    'Now Heaven aid me,' said Beaumains, 'for this is a most shameful and  unknightly custom, and well doth that evil knight deserve death.'    'Nevertheless he is a knight of great prowess and force, though of evil  custom,' replied the lady, 'and no one hath ever borne him down in  battle.'    With that they came to a sycamore-tree which stood alone in the plain,  and on it was hung a great horn of elephant bone, with gold work  curiously wrought.    'Fair sir, ye must blow that horn if ye wish to do battle with the Red  Knight. But, sir,' went on the lady quickly, and caught at Beaumains'  arm that already had lifted the horn, 'be ye not overbold. It is now  the hour of prime, and it is said that the Red Knight's force  increaseth to the strength of seven men until it is noon. Wait,  therefore, until noon shall be past, and his strength shall diminish.'    'Nay, nay,' said Beaumains, 'speak not thus to me. I will assail him  however mighty he be, and either I will beat him or die with honour in  the field.'    Therewith he lifted the horn and blew so great a blast that instantly  knights came in a great press from the tents, and people looked out  from the walls and windows of the castle.    Then Beaumains saw a tall man come running from a tent, arming himself  as he came. Two barons set his spurs upon his heels and an earl buckled  his helm upon his head. He was all in red armour, from the plume which  waved upon his crest to the cloth which was upon his horse. And his  shield was all of red, with but a black heart in the centre thereof.    Then he waited for Beaumains in a little hollow before the castle, so  that all that were therein might see the combat.    'Now, fair sir,' said Linet, 'it behoves you to have great courage and  heart, for yonder is your deadliest enemy, and at yonder window is my  lady sister, Dame Lyones.'    Beaumains looked to where Linet was pointing, and saw at a window the  loveliest lady he had ever seen. And as he looked she smiled and bowed  to him, and he felt his heart burn with love for her.    'Truly,' he said, 'she is the fairest lady I have ever looked upon, and  she shall be my lady.'    'Cease thy looking at that lady,' called the Red Knight in a harsh and  angry voice. 'She is my lady, and soon shall she see thy foolish body  swinging from the tree for the ravens to pluck, as others hang there  afore thee.'    ''Tis for that shameful sight and for the love of this lady that hates  you and your evil custom, that I am resolved to slay you, if God so  wills,' was the stern reply of Beaumains.    'A boastful rogue thou art,' cried the Red Knight, and laughed  scornfully. 'What is thy name, and whence come ye, Sir Black Knight?  For surely from your talk you must be one of those prating and soft  fools of the Round Table?'    'I will not tell thee my name,' said Beaumains. 'And as yet I am not of  the worshipful company of King Arthur's Round Table. But when I have  slain thee and rid the world of so shameful a knight, then shall I  crave the king to receive me into that high fellowship of noble and  courteous knights.'    'Make thee ready!' shouted the Red Knight in a "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/22397"],[0,"Shakespearean Playhouses (#16)"],[1,"the monks as a  buttery and a frater. A history of the rooms up to the time of their  use as a theatre may be briefly sketched.    In 1548 the buttery and frater, with certain other buildings, were let  by King Edward to Sir Thomas Cawarden, Master of the Revels; and in  1550 they were granted to him outright. In 1554 Cawarden sold the  northern section of the buttery, fifty-two feet in length, to Lord  Cobham, whose mansion it adjoined. The rest of the buttery, forty-six  feet in length, and the frater, he converted into lodgings. Since the  frater was of exceptional breadth--fifty-two feet on the outside,  forty-six feet on the inside--he ran a partition through its length,  dividing it into two parts. The section of the frater on the west of  this partition he let to Sir Richard Frith; the section on the east,  with the remainder of the buttery not sold to Lord Cobham, he let to  Sir John Cheeke. It is with the Cheeke Lodgings that we are especially  concerned.    About September, 1554, Cheeke went to travel abroad, and surrendered  his rooms in the Blackfriars. Sir Thomas Cawarden thereupon made use  of them \"for the Office of the Queen's Majesty's Revells\"; thus for a  time the Cheeke Lodgings were intimately connected with dramatic  activities. But at the death of Cawarden, in 1559, the Queen  transferred the Office of the Revels to St. John's, and the  Blackfriars property belonging to Cawarden passed into the possession  of Sir William More.    [Illustration: A PLAN OF FARRANT'S PLAYHOUSE    Frith's Lodging and the four southern rooms of Farrant's Lodging were  on the upper floor of the Frater; the two northern rooms of Farrant's  Lodging were on the upper floor of the Buttery. The playhouse was  erected in the two rooms last mentioned.]    In 1560 the new proprietor let the Cheeke Lodgings to Sir Henry  Neville, with the addition of \"a void piece of ground\" eighteen feet  wide extending west to Water Lane.[149] During his tenancy Neville  erected certain partitions, built a kitchen in the \"void piece of  ground,\" and a large stairway leading to the rooms overhead. In 1568  he surrendered his lease, and More let the rooms first to some \"sylk  dyers,\" and then in 1571 to Lord Cobham. In 1576 Cobham gave up the  rooms, and More was seeking a tenant. It was at this auspicious moment  that Farrant planned a private theatre, and enlisted the aid of Sir  Henry Neville.    [Footnote 149: This was enclosed with brick walls, and the greater  part used as a wood-yard. This yard was later purchased by James  Burbage when he secured the frater for his playhouse. The kitchen,  shed, and stairs, built on the eastern part, were sold to Cobham.]    On August 27 Farrant and Neville separately wrote letters to Sir  William More about the matter. Farrant respectfully solicited the  lease, and made the significant request that he might \"pull down one  partition, and so make two rooms--one.\" Neville, in a friendly letter  beginning with \"hearty commendations unto you and to Mrs. More,\" and  ending with light gossip, urged Sir William to let the rooms to  Farrant, and recommended Farrant as a desirable tenant (\"I dare answer  for him\"). Neither letter mentioned the purpose for which the rooms,  especially the large room referred to by Farrant, were to be used; but  More doubtless understood that the Windsor Children were to practice  their plays there, with occasional private rehearsals. Largely as a  result of Neville's recommendation, More decided to let the rooms to  Farrant. The progress of the negotiations is marked by a letter from  Farrant to More, dated September 17, 1576, requesting that there be  granted him also a certain \"little dark room,\" which he found would be  useful.    The lease as finally signed describes the property thus:         Sir William More hath demised, granted, and to ferm letten,       and by these presents doth demise, grant, and to ferm let       unto the said Richard Farrant all those his six upper       chambers, lofts, lodgings, or rooms, lying together within       the precinct of the late dissolved house or priory of the       Blackfriars, otherwise called the friars preachers, in       London; which said six upper chambers, lofts, lodgings, or       rooms, were lately, amongst others, in the tenure and       occupation of the right honourable Sir William Brooke,       Knight, Lord Cobham; and do contain in length from the north       end thereof to the south end of the same one hundred fifty       and six foot and a half of assize; whereof two of the said       six upper chambers, lofts, lodgings, or rooms in the north       end of the premises, together with the breadth of the little       room under granted, do contain in length forty[150] and six       foot and a half, and from the east to the west part thereof       in breadth twenty and five foot of assize;[151] and the       four other chambers, or rooms, residue of the said six upper       chambers, do contain in length one hundred and ten foot, and       in breadth from the east to the west part thereof twenty-two       foot of assize.... And also ... the great stairs lately       erected and made by the said Sir Henry Neville upon part of       the said void ground and way.    [Footnote 150: By an error in the manuscript this reads \"fifty\"; but  the rooms are often described and always as \"forty-six\" feet in  length; moreover, the error is made obvious by the rest of the lease.]    [Footnote 151: The breadth is elsewhere given as twenty-six, and  twenty-seven feet.]    It was agreed that the lease should run for twenty-one years, and that  the rental should be L14 per annum. But Sir William More, being a most  careful and exacting landlord, with the interest of his adjacent  lodgings to care for, inserted in the lease the following important  proviso, which was destined to make trouble, and ultimately to wreck  the theatre:         Provided also that the said Richard Farrant, his executors       or assigns, or any of them, shall not in any wise demise,       let, grant, assign, set over, or by any ways or means put       away his or their interest or term of years, or any part of       the same years, of or in the said premises before letten, or       any part, parcel, or member thereof to any person, or       persons, at any time hereafter during this present lease and       term of twenty-one years, without the special license,       consent, and agreement of the said Sir William More, his       heirs and assigns, first had, and obtained in writing under       his and their hands and seals.    The penalty affixed to a violation of this provision was the immediate  forfeiture of the lease.    Apparently Farrant entered into possession of the rooms on September  29[152] (although the formal lease was not signed until December 20),  and we may suppose that he at once set about converting the two upper  rooms at the north end of the lodgings into a suitable theatre.[153]  Naturally he took for his model the halls at Court in which the  Children had been accustomed to act. First, we are told, he \"pulled  down partitions to make that place apt for that purpose\"; next, he  \"spoiled\" the windows--by which is meant, no doubt, that he stopped up  the windows, for the performances were to be by candle-light. At one  end of the hall he erected a platform to serve as a stage, and in the  auditorium he placed benches or chairs. There was, presumably, no room  for a gallery; if such had been erected, the indignant More would  certainly have mentioned it in his bill of complaints.[154]  Chandeliers over the stage, and, possibly, footlights, completed the  necessary arrangements. For these alterations Farrant, we are told,  became \"greatly indebted,\" and he died three or four years later with  the debt still unpaid. More complained that the alterations had put  the rooms into a state of \"great ruin,\" which meant, of course, from  the point of view of a landlord desiring to let them again for  residential purposes. Just how costly or how extensive the alterations  were we cannot now determine; but we may reasonably conclude that  Farrant made the hall not only \"commodious for his purpose,\" but also  attractive to the aristocratic audiences he intended to gather there  to see his plays.    [Footnote 152: The date from which the lease was made to run.]    [Footnote 153: It is usually said that he converted the entire seven  rooms into his theatre, but that seems highly unlikely. The northern  section was 46 x 26 feet, the southern section 110 x 22--absurd  dimensions for an auditorium. Moreover, that Farrant originally  planned to use only the northern section is indicated by his request  to be allowed to \"pull down one partition and so make two rooms--one.\"  The portion not used for the playhouse he rented; in 1580, we are  told, he let \"two parcels thereof to two several persons.\"]    [Footnote 154: M. Feuillerat, I think, is wrong in supposing that  there was a gallery. He deduces no proof for his contention, and the  evidence is against him.]    To reach the hall, playgoers had to come first into Water Lane, thence  through \"a way leading from the said way called Water Lane\" to \"a  certain void ground\" before the building. Here \"upon part of the said  void ground\" they found a \"great stairs, which said great stairs do  serve and lead into\" the upper rooms--or, as we may now say,  Blackfriars Playhouse.[155]    [Footnote 155: There must have been two stairways leading to the upper  rooms; I have assumed that playgoers used Neville's stairs to reach  the theatre.]    Having thus provided a playhouse, Farrant next provided an adequate  company of boy actors. To do this, he combined the Children of Windsor  with the Children of the Chapel Royal, of which William Hunnis was  master. What arrangement he made with Hunnis we do not know, but the  Court records show that Farrant was regarded as the manager of the new  organization; he is"]]]
