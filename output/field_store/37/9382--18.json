It is now used entirely as apartments  for students of University College.    Bishop Fox (1494-1501) is responsible for the next important changes. He  curtailed the great hall by a partition wall near its south end, which  still exists. The wall bears his badge in two places--a pelican feeding  her young with blood from her breast. He also adapted part of Pudsey's  buildings, near the south-west corner of the castle, to the purposes of  a kitchen, erected three fireplaces, and windows, and the oak buttery  hatch which opens from the kitchen, and which again has carved upon it  \"the pelican in her piety.\"    Bishop Tunstall (1530-1558) built #Tunstall's Gallery#, which  extends from the great hall to the clock tower. It is entered by Cosin's  staircase (erected later) and by an eastern stair built by Tunstall  himself. A curious feature of this stairway is a port-hole which  commands the main entrance to the courtyard. The present beautiful  little chapel is also the work of Bishop Tunstall. It contains some  notable carved oak stalls, of earlier date than the chapel itself, which  were brought from the castle at Bishop Auckland. The carved devices of  the miserere seats of these stalls are curious and worthy of attention.  The doors in the gateway of the courtyard are the work of Tunstall's  time.    Bishop Cosin (1660-1672) found the castle in a dilapidated condition.  During the Commonwealth it had been sold to the then Lord Mayor of  London, who used it badly, to say nothing of the ruin caused by the  Scots. He spent large sums in its restoration. He added the present  porch or entrance from the courtyard to the great hall. The great  staircase in the north-west corner of the courtyard is his and bears his  arms. Within and leading to Tunstall's Gallery is the Black Staircase,  also the work of Cosin. He enlarged the chapel, and constructed and  fitted several apartments in the castle, besides several minor works. In  his will, he says, he spent the greater part of his temporal estate in  \"rebuilding and repaireing the two episcopall Castles of Durham and  Bishop Auckland.\" This, he states, cost him seventeen thousand pounds,  including the furnishing and ornamenting of the chapels, which he did  \"for the use of my successors in those Chappells for ever.\" Many of the  agreements between Bishop Cosin and his masons, plasterers, carpenters,  and painters, from which the exact dates and prices paid for the work  may be learned, are preserved.    The latest important work at the castle was the rebuilding of the keep,  in 1840, which was described at that time as \"a picturesque ruin.\" It  was entirely rebuilt on its original plan. The gateway to the courtyard  was repaired and modernised by Bishop Barrington, with the existing  inartistic result.    Durham Castle owes its picturesque appearance to two causes--first, its  magnificent and commanding position, on a rocky escarpment; and second,  no doubt, to the many vicissitudes through which it has passed, the  alterations and additions made necessary by time and constant war, and  later, the entirely different uses to which the building is put.    [Illustration: Staircase in the Castle.]    It is now chiefly used as a hall of residence for university men and as  lodging for the Judges of Assize.    The most favourable time for the architectural student to visit the  castle is during one of the university vacations, otherwise many  interesting features would be denied him. Many portions (except  students' chambers) are, however, open to the public every week day.    #The University of Durham.#--From an early date, frequent mention is  made in the history of the see of Durham, of a college at Oxford called  the Durham College. Its origin is not exactly known, but by the  liberality of several bishops and priors its original endowment  increased, until provision was made for eight fellows and eight  scholars. This was the case at the time of the suppression of the  monasteries by King Henry VIII., when, owing to its connection with the  monastery of Durham, the college was also dissolved. Its revenues, were,  however, rescued, and in 1541 were handed over by the king to the newly  created dean and chapter. Thus the matter stood till 1650, when a  petition was presented to the Protector, showing the great disadvantages  to the North of England arising from the long distance of Oxford and  Cambridge, and praying that the houses of the dean and prebendaries  might be converted into a college. Cromwell took a favourable view of  the idea, and in a letter to Lenthall, the Speaker, in its support, he  says:--        \"Truly it seems to me a matter of great concernment and importance,      as that which (by the blessing of God) may much conduce to the      promotion of learning and piety in these poore, rude, and ignorant      parts, there being also many concurring advantages to this place, as      pleasantness, and aptness of situation, healthfull aire, and plenty      of provisions, which seeme to favour and pleade for theire desires      therein.\"[7]      [7] Hutchinson, vol. i    Various delays occurred, however, and it was not until 1657 that the  Lord Protector issued his patent for the erection of the proposed  college, in a document consisting of twenty-three heads.    The college thus commenced made great progress, and would no doubt have  continued to do so, but for the constant opposition of the two great  universities of Oxford and Cambridge. Then followed the Restoration, and  with it came a reaction against all measures established during the  Protectorate. This feeling, combined with persistent petitions from the  universities, soon accomplished the downfall of the College.    Bishop Van Mildert, who was translated to Durham in 1826, during his  short episcopate saw many changes, not the least of which was the  successful revival of the scheme for a university. Powers were obtained  in 1832 for the training of students in divinity and the conferring of  degrees in other faculties. The new foundation was endowed out of the  revenues of the cathedral, and the bishop gave up the Castle of Durham  for the use of the college, besides financial assistance of L1000 for  the first year and L2000 for the following years until his death in  1836. The first warden was Dr Charles Thorp, Archdeacon and Canon of  Durham, but it was provided by an order, on the recommendation of the  Ecclesiastical Commissioners that in future the office of warden should  be permanently attached to the deanery, and that a canonry in the  cathedral be annexed to each of the professorships of Divinity and  Greek.    The government of the university is in the hands of the dean and  chapter, and the affairs administered by a warden, senate and  convocation. A royal charter was obtained in 1837 making the university  a corporate body with perpetual succession and a common seal.    The university, besides its original schools of arts and divinity, has  established schools of physical science and medicine, in connection with  the Durham College of Science at Newcastle-on-Tyne, and has recently  admitted women students to its courses and lectures.    There are many foundation scholarships and exhibitions in arts,  classics, mathematics, and theology, besides a long list of private  foundations and fellowships.    The university consists of one college and one hall. The former,  University College, occupies the Castle, and the latter, Bishop  Hatfield's Hall.    It is well supplied with libraries. The university library founded at  the opening, to which Bishop Van Mildert contributed a valuable  collection.    The library given in 1855 by the late Dr Martin Routh, president of  Magdalen College, Oxford.    The library presented by the late Bishop Maltby in 1856, which he  endowed with L1000.    A library was also bequeathed to the university in 1859 by the late T.M.  Winterbottom, M.D., of Westoe, South Shields. A large collection of  books was bequeathed by the late Bishop Lightfoot.    Two other important libraries may here be mentioned, though they do not  belong to the University--viz. the Chapter Library and Bishop Cosin's  Library.          CHAPTER VI    THE CITY      Besides the Cathedral and Castle, the City of Durham possesses several  churches of decided interest to the student of architecture, which  deserve a brief notice.    The Parish Church of #S. Mary in the North Bailey.#--This small  church is generally known as S. Mary le Bow, owing to the fact that in  its original steeple was an arch, through which the roadway passed. This  steeple fell in 1637, and the ancient structure was allowed to lapse  into complete ruin. The present church was built in 1685, and its most  noticeable feature is the open carved screen between the nave and  chancel erected in 1707. The site of the church is the oldest in the  city, and some writers have thought it probably identical with that of  the White Church in which the body of S. Cuthbert was placed during the  building of the cathedral.    #S. Mary-the-Less# is a small but picturesque church situated in the  South Bailey, and is of Norman date. Its original architectural  character is, however, almost entirely lost, owing to extensive  restorations which took place in 1846-7. The round-headed window now in  the south wall of the chancel, but formerly in the west wall of the  nave, is the only remaining original feature. The church is entered by a  porch on the south side, and consists of a nave and chancel only. Some  stones in the churchyard, which were removed from their position when  the church was restored, are carved with chevron ornament, and would  seem to show that the date of the original structure was the earlier  part of the twelfth century.    #S. Oswald.#--This church stands on high ground overlooking the river  Wear, at the head of New Elvet;"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/20194"],[0,"The Petticoat Commando: Boer Women in Secret Service (#16)"],[1,"there and talked of many things, asked her  innumerable questions on the country and its people, and drew her out  upon the subject of the war.    Outside, the elements were raging, for the storm had broken loose, and  the rain came down in torrents, while the crashing thunder pealed  overhead.    Hansie looked anxious, and the Governor said:    \"It will soon be over. Are you afraid?\"    \"Oh no, I love our storms; but my mother is alone at home, and she  does _not_.\"    She told him, toying with her permits, of her curious collection of  passes and other war-curios, and he left the room with a friendly--    \"Perhaps I can find something for you too,\" returning with a button  from his coat and a colonel's crown.    \"The storm is over; let us see what damage has been done,\" and he led  the way into the garden, showed her the flowers, asked the names of  shrubs unknown to him.           *       *       *       *       *    \"Oh, mother, the English must not be so good to us! It is not right to  accept favours at their hands, for it places us in a false position.  Don't ever ask me to go to General Maxwell again.\"    \"Of course not. I quite agree with you, but I am very glad to have  those permits. Did you ask about the portmanteau and box?\"    \"Yes. He said it was all right, and promised to give permits, so that  they need not be examined.\"    They did not leave for Johannesburg, after all, on Monday, for a full  list of the names of prisoners from Ventersdorp arrived, but there was  no van Warmelo among them.    Telegrams were sent right and left, but there was something strange  about the whole affair, and no satisfactory answers could be got until  five days after the first tidings had reached Harmony. The prisoner  was at Potchefstroom.    Two more days of suspense and a note from Major Hoskins came,  enclosing a telegram--\"Van Warmelo leaving to-morrow for Fort  Johannesburg.\"    Great rejoicings! The women had begun to fear that their hero had been  whisked away to some remote portion of the globe, without one word  from them.    General Maxwell's letters of introduction acted like a charm when  presented at the various military departments in the Golden City.    Colonel Mackenzie, the Military Governor, gave the women a letter of  introduction to the O.C. troops, who directed them to the  Provost-Marshal, Captain Short, informing them that they would find  him at his office in the Fort.    The Provost-Marshal did not know that more prisoners from  Ventersdorp were expected that day. He thought there must be some  mistake--unless--yes, there would be another train at 5 o'clock that  afternoon.    The ladies were advised to call again on Sunday morning and drove to  Heath's Hotel, where they had taken up their quarters. How quiet and  deserted the Golden City looked! How bleak and desolate, with the  first breath of winter upon it!    Poor Hansie had a shocking cold, and as she drove through the silent  streets with her mother all the miseries of the past eighteen months  came crowding into her aching heart and throbbing brain.    What would the meeting be like to-morrow? Would he be changed? And  what would he have to tell? The question still remained whether he  would be allowed to tell them anything about the war at all----    Suddenly a brilliant thought flashed into Hansie's mind.    \"Oh, mother, let us go to the Braamfontein Station and see the train  arrive. I know we won't be allowed to speak to him, but we may at  least wave our hands and _look_ at him.\"    Her mother was delighted with the thought, and at 4 o'clock that  afternoon they took a cab to Braamfontein Station.    The train had been delayed, and would be in at 6 instead of 5 o'clock,  so they were told, but, for fear of having been misinformed, they  decided to wait at the station.    Cold, dusty, pitiless, the keen wind blew on that unfriendly platform.  There was no ladies' waiting room--in fact, it seemed as if the rooms  had all been utilised for other, perhaps military, purposes.    It is incredible the amount of suffering that can be crowded into one  hour of waiting!    Thank God, at last the train steamed in.    Armed troops and an unusually large number of passengers alighted on  the platform, but there was not a prisoner to be seen. The desperate  women walked up and down, keenly scrutinising every face they passed,  until they heard a well-known, highly excited voice calling out  \"Mother! Mother!\" to them from behind. They turned and saw their hero  tumbling from the train, an armed Tommy at his heels.    There are no memories of the moments such as those which followed.    Things must have been rather bad, for when Hansie looked round again  the armed soldier had turned away and was slowly walking in another  direction. Blessed, thrice-blessed Tommy!    To this day when Hansie thinks of him she remembers with a pang that  she did not shake hands with him.    \"May we walk with the prisoner as far as the Johannesburg Fort?\"  Hansie asked.    \"Certainly, miss.\"    How the people stared and turned round in the street to stare again!    And now that I come to think of it, it must have looked remarkable--a  ruffianly-looking man, carrying a disreputable bundle of blankets, a  tin cup and water-bottle slung across his shoulders all clanking  together, and a small _Bible_ in his hands, with a well-dressed lady  on each arm and an armed soldier behind, guarding the whole!    The prisoner was a sight! The old felt hat was full of holes, through  which the unkempt hair was sticking, and the dirty black suit was torn  and greasy-looking--but the face, except for the moustache and  unfamiliar beard, was the same, the look of love in the blue eyes  unchanged.    It seemed like a dream, incredibly sweet and strange, to be walking  through the streets of Johannesburg in uninterrupted conversation,  carried on _in Dutch,_ with him, and to be able to ask the burning  questions with which their hearts had been filled all day--why he was  alone, where he had left Fritz, how and where he had been captured.    Everything was explained on that memorable walk, simply and briefly  explained, for the time was short, and under the circumstances Dietlof  would not give any details of information concerning the war,  considering himself bound to silence by the guard's trust in him.    He had been promoted to the position of commandeering officer by  General Kemp and had been in the habit, for some time past, of leaving  his commando for days at a stretch on commandeering expeditions.    About four days before his capture he had left his people again for  the same purpose, and on this occasion he had fled before the enemy  for three days, falling into their hands through the death of his good  horse through horse-sickness.    His brother Fritz was under General Kemp with Jan and Izak Celliers  (this was the first news Mrs. van Warmelo heard of Mr. Celliers' safe  arrival on commando, after the adventures undergone by him and  described in Chapter IX), and a few others of his most trusted  friends, but what they must have thought of his inexplicable  non-appearance Dietlof did not know, but he feared they would be  undergoing much anxiety on his account.    Near the entrance of the Fort mother and daughter took their leave,  thanking the soldier warmly for his kindness to his charge, whom they  hoped to see again the following morning.    Very different was the meeting then!    The prisoner, a forlorn object, stood between two guards, before the  Provost-Marshal's office, when the cab containing the two women drove  up.    Hansie jumped out and was going up to her brother, when one of the  soldiers said to her:    \"You may not speak to the prisoner.\"    \"But I may kiss him!\" Hansie retorted, throwing her arms round his  neck and giving him a kiss which could be heard all over the Fort.    There was a general laugh, and Mrs. van Warmelo promptly followed  suit.    Dietlof was called into the Provost-Marshal's office and  cross-questioned, while his mother and sister waited outside  impatiently. What a lengthy examination! Quarter of an hour, half an  hour passed, then he appeared with a soldier, who said curtly:    \"You may talk to the prisoner for half an hour _in English_!\"    I forget how many minutes of the precious thirty were lost in groping  desperately for some topic of conversation suitable to the occasion,  and safe! but when at last they found their tongues, they talked so  fast that it is doubtful whether the Tommies understood anything.    Hansie longed to ask her brother whether the Provost-Marshal knew  anything of their escapade the night before, but dared not, hoping  that the men concerned were under the impression that this was their  first interview with the prisoner.    He told them some of his war experiences and the fights he had been  in, for the Provost-Marshal had given him permission to speak of his  personal experiences of the war.    One incident Hansie remembered particularly, because of a curious  coincidence connected with it.    In describing the battle of Moselikatsnek, under General de la Rey,  in which he and Fritz had taken an active part, he told his mother and  sister of a young English officer, Lieutenant Pilkington, whom he had  found lying alone in a pool of blood among the rocks and shrubs.  Dietlof tended him, giving him brandy from a flask which he always  carried with him for such purposes, and laying grass under him on the  hard rocks. The poor man was shockingly wounded, and it was evident  that his case was hopeless. He held Dietlof's hand, imploring him not  to leave him, but Dietlof was the forerunner of the seven burghers who  were forcing their way wedgelike through the English ranks in order to  compel the enemy to surrender by attacking them from behind. He  considered it his duty to go forward, but assured the dying man that  the comrades who were following in his wake could speak English and  would "]]]
