[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/21312"],[0,"Glyn Severn's Schooldays (#16)"],[1,"  The next minute the trampled arena was in silence, and the Doctor, with  his hands clasped behind him, was marching back alone towards his study,  going so slowly that every one who had formed a portion of the little  gathering had disappeared by the time he was half-way to the open French  window.    There was something peculiar about Dr Bewley's countenance as he slowly  marched back.  For one minute it was placid, the next stern, and  directly after a slight quivering of the facial nerves developed into a  mirthful look, which was emphasised by a low, pleasant, chuckling laugh.  For the fact was that the tall, stern, portly Doctor's thoughts had  gone far back to his old schooldays and a victory he had once achieved  over the brutal bully of the school at which he had been placed.  And  whether he was alluding to the tyrant of his days or to the one who had  lorded it for long enough in the establishment of which he was the head  must remain a mystery; but certain it was that the Doctor muttered  presently to himself, \"An overbearing young ruffian!  A thoroughly good  thrashing; and serve him right!\"    The next moment the utterer of these words, which had fallen upon his  own ears only, was looking guiltily round as if in dread lest he might  have been heard.  But there was no one visible but Sam Grigg, who was  brushing hard at boots by the entrance to his own particular outdoor  den; and he was too far away to hear; while, when the Doctor entered his  study, he was met at the door by Wrench, who announced that a lady was  waiting in the drawing-room, and he handed a card.    \"Ha, yes, Wrench,\" said the Doctor.  \"About a new pupil.  I will see her  directly.--Oh, Singh--Burney, you here?  I will speak to you both  another time.  One moment--this is private, boys.  You both know--at  least, you do now, Burney, and you from henceforth must remember the  same, Singh--I allow no brutal fighting in my establishment; but I am  not very angry with you, my lads, for on the whole there was a display  of manliness in your conduct that I cannot find it in my heart to  condemn.  There, you, Singh, can go and see your friend Severn.--And  you, Burney, h'm--humph--well, yes, go and see Slegge.  You must not  forsake your companion now he is down.\"        CHAPTER TWELVE.    \"WITH FACES LIKE THIS.\"    Singh's encounter with Slegge had been very short, and when the Doctor  sent him in the tokens of the affray were very slight; but a few hours  afterwards certain discolorations were so manifest that the Doctor  frowned and told him he had better join his companion in the dormitory  for a few days and consider himself in Mrs Hamton's charge.  Singh  hailed the order with delight, and went straight to his bedroom, where  the plump, pleasant, elderly housekeeper had just entered before him,  carrying a small basin half-full of some particular liniment-like  preparation of her own, a sponge, and a soft towel.    When Singh appeared at the door Glyn sat up so suddenly that he nearly  knocked over the basin that Mrs Hamton had given him to hold, after  spreading the soft towel in his lap, when she began sponging his face  with the preparation.    \"Oh, my dear child,\" she cried, \"pray, be careful!\"    \"Ha, ha, ha!\" laughed the boy merrily.--\"Oh, do look at him, Mrs  Hamton.  What a guy!\"    \"Guy!\" cried Singh sharply.  \"What do you mean?\"    He dashed to the dressing-table and took his first look at his face in  the glass since he had dressed that morning.    \"Oh, I say,\" he cried, \"I never thought of this.  Why, it's just like my  face was that day after the sergeant had shown us how to use the  boxing-gloves.\"    \"Yes,\" cried Glyn merrily; \"but what sort of a phiz would you have had  if you had fought it out?\"    \"One something like yours,\" cried Singh.  \"Oh, I say, you ought to talk!  What eyes! and your lip all cut.  Why, your face is all on one side.\"    \"Yes, isn't it shocking, my dear,\" said the old housekeeper.  \"I do hope  that it will be a lesson to you both.  I never could understand why  young gentlemen were so fond of fighting.\"    \"Oh, it's because it's so nice, Mrs Hamton,\" said Glyn, who spoke as if  he were in the height of glee.    \"I don't believe you mean that, my dear; but there, lie back in the  chair again, and let me go on dabbing all your poor cuts and bruises  with this lotion and water.  It's so cooling and healing, and it will  take all the inflammation out.--And don't you go, my dear,\" she  continued, turning to Singh, \"till I have done your face over too.\"    \"I am not going,\" said Singh quietly.  \"The Doctor sent me up here to  stop.\"    \"Has he?\" cried Glyn.  \"Oh, hurrah!  Here, Mrs Hamton, another patient  for you to make decent.--I say, Singhy, she's just come from old Slegge.  I'm afraid I've made his face in a horrible mess.\"    \"You have indeed, my dear,\" said the housekeeper reproachfully.  \"But  oh, what a pity it is that young gentlemen will so far forget  themselves!  It grieves me; it does indeed.\"    \"But I don't forget myself,\" protested Glyn.  \"I was obliged to fight.  You wouldn't have had me lie down and let him knock both of us about for  nothing, would you, nurse--I mean Mrs Hamton?\"    \"Oh, don't ask me, my dear; it's not for me to say; and you needn't mind  calling me nurse, for it always sounds nice and pleasant to me.  There,  now, doesn't that feel cool and comforting?\"    \"Lovely,\" cried Glyn softly, and as he looked up in the pleasant face,  with its grey curls on either side, his eyes for the moment, what could  be seen of them, seemed to be sparkling with mischief and mirth, for  there was a feeling of pride and triumph at his success swelling in his  breast, and a few moments later, so great was the comfort he experienced  under the delicate manipulation of his motherly attendant's hands, that  he looked up at her and began to smile--only began, for he uttered an  ejaculation of pain.    \"Oh, my dear, did I hurt you?\" cried the housekeeper.    \"No,\" said the boy, in rather a piteous tone; \"it was my face.  It's all  stiff and queer.\"    \"Yes, I told you that it was one-sided,\" said Singh merrily.    \"Well, never mind, my dear; it will soon be better,\" said the  housekeeper soothingly.  \"But you must do exactly what I tell you, and  be very patient and still.\"    \"But, I say, look here, Mrs Hamton,\" cried Glyn, catching the hand  which was bearing the sponge and holding it to his cheek, to the old  lady's intense satisfaction, though somehow there came an unwonted look  of moisture in her eyes.    \"What were you going to say, my dear?  But, dear, dear, what a pity it  is that you should go and disfigure yourselves like this!  What would  your poor father say if he knew?\"    \"Oh, I say, don't talk about it,\" cried Glyn.--\"Fancy, Singhy, if he  could see us now!\"    Glyn tried to whistle, but his puffed-up lips refused to give forth a  sound; and, seeing this, Singh whistled for him, and then in spite of  the pain and stiffness of their faces the two boys laughed till the  suffering became intense.    \"Oh, don't, don't, don't, Singhy!\" cried Glyn.  \"I can't bear it.\"    \"Well, I never did see two such young gentlemen as you are,\" said the  old housekeeper, smiling in turn.    \"You ought both to be lying back looking as melancholy as black, and  here you are making fun of your troubles.  Ah, it's a fine thing, my  dears, to be boys and quite young; but I do hope that you will never  fight any more, and that you will both soon go and shake hands with Mr  Slegge, and tell him you are very sorry you hit him.  I am sure that he  must feel very sorry that he ever hit you, he being so much bigger and  having so long had the advantage of being taught by the Doctor, who is  the best man that ever lived, while you two are so new, and you, Mr  Singh, so much younger than Mr Slegge that I do wonder he ever so far  forgot himself as to hit you.  Now, you will make friends afterwards,  won't you?\"    \"No!\" cried Singh sharply.  \"I hate the coward.\"    \"Oh, my dear!\" cried the old lady.    \"He doesn't mean it, nursey,\" cried Glyn, getting hold of her hand  again.  \"He only said it because he feels so sore.  He's got a sore face  and a sore temper; but it will be all right when he gets well.\"    \"I hope so, my dear; and you will shake hands with him, won't you?\"    \"Yes,\" said Glyn merrily, \"as soon as he holds out his.  I can afford  to.--Can't I, Singhy?\"    \"Oh yes, of course.\"    \"There,\" said the old lady, \"now that's spoken nicely, and I don't think  I'll bathe your face any more.--Now, my dear,\" she continued to Singh,  \"it's your turn.\"    \"Oh, mine doesn't want doing, does it?\" said the boy carelessly.    \"Yes, my dear, and very badly too.  If it isn't bathed with my lotion it  will go on swelling, and be more discoloured still.\"    \"Oh!\" cried the boy eagerly.--\"Here, you, Glyn, get up out of that  chair.  It's my turn now, as Mrs Hamton says,\" and he took another  glimpse at the glass.  \"There, I'm ready.  Oh, I say, I do look a  wretch!\"    Under the care of the good-natured old housekeeper during the next two  days a great deal of the swelling went down; but after the old lady's  report, and visits from the Doctor himself, they were both still treated  as infirmary patients, and relieved from lessons till such time as they  should be presentable amongst their fellows.    But on the third day the confinement was growing irksome in the extreme;  and the Doctor, after his daily visit, gave Singh permission to come  down into the grounds if he liked.  But the boy did not like.  A glance  at his companion in adversity revealed a disappointed look, and as soon  as the Doctor was gone he picked up one of the books with which they  were well supplied.    \"Well,\" said Glyn gloomily, \"why don't you go down?\"    \"Because I don't want to,\" was the reply; and no more was said.    But that afternoon soon after dinner, which was brought up to them by  the housekeeper on a folding-tray,"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/21316"],[0,"The Adventures of Don Lavington: Nolens Volens (#16)"],[1,"sailors on us, and your uncle's yard 'll go to rack  and ruin; and there was two screws out o' one o' the shutter hinges as I  were going to put in to-day.\"    \"Jem, we must escape them.\"    \"All right, Mas' Don, sir.  'Arter breakfast.\"    \"Breakfast?  Who is to eat breakfast?\"    \"I am, sir.  Feels as if it would do me good.\"    \"But we must escape, Jem--escape.\"    \"Yes, sir; that's right,\" said Jem, taking off the cup, and sniffing at  the jug.  \"Coffee, sir.  Got pretty well knocked about last night, and  I'm as sore this morning as if they'd been rolling casks all over me.  But a man must eat.\"    \"Eat then, and drink then, for goodness' sake,\" cried Don impatiently.    \"Thankye, sir,\" said Jem; and he poured out a cup of steaming coffee,  sipped it, sipped again, took three or four mouthfuls of bread and  butter, and then drained the cup.    \"Mas' Don!\" he cried, \"it's lovely.  Do have a cup.  Make you see  clear.\"    As he spoke he refilled the mug and handed it to Don, who took it  mechanically, and placed it to his lips, one drop suggesting another  till he had finished the cup.    \"Now a bit o' bread and butter, Mas' Don?\"    Don shook his head, but took the top piece, and began mechanically to  eat, while Jem partook of another cup, there being a liberal allowance  of some three pints.    \"That's the way, sir.  Wonderful what a difference breakfuss makes in a  man.  Eat away, sir; and if they don't look out we'll give them  press-gang.\"    \"Yes, but how, Jem?  How?\"    \"Lots o' ways, sir.  We'll get away, for one thing, or fasten that there  trap-door down; and then they'll be the prisoners, not us.  'Nother cup,  sir?  Go on with the bread and butter.  I say, sir, do I look lively?\"    \"Lively?\"    \"I mean much knocked about?  My face feels as if the skin was too tight,  and as if I couldn't get on my hat.\"    \"It does not matter, Jem,\" said Don, quietly.  \"You have no hat.\"    \"More I haven't.  I remember feeling it come off, and it wasn't half  wore out.  Have some more coffee, Mas' Don.  'Tarnt so good as my Sally  makes.  I'd forgot all about her just then.  Wonder whether she's eating  her breakfast?\"    Don sighed and went on eating.  He was horribly low-spirited, but his  youthful appetite once started, he felt the need of food, and kept on in  silence, passing and receiving the cup till all was gone.    \"That job's done,\" said Jem, placing the jug on the plate, and the cup  in the mouth of the jug.  \"Now then, I'm ready, Mas' Don.  You said  escape, didn't you, sir?\"    \"Yes.  What shall we do?\"    \"Well, we can't go down that way, sir, because the trap-door's bolted.\"    \"There is the window, Jem.\"    \"Skylights, you mean, sir,\" said Jem, looking up at the sloping panes in  the roof.  \"Well, let's have a look.  Will you get a-top o' my  shoulders, or shall I get a-top o' yourn?\"    \"I couldn't bear you, Jem.\"    \"Then up you gets, my lad, like the tumblers do at the fair.\"    It seemed easy enough to get up and stand on the sturdy fellow's  shoulders, but upon putting it to the test, Don found it very hard, and  after a couple of failures he gave up, and they stood together looking  up at the sloping window, which was far beyond their reach.    \"Dessay it's fastened, so that we couldn't open it,\" said Jem.    \"The fox said the grapes were sour when he could not get at them, Jem.\"    \"That's true, Mas' Don.  Well, how are we to get up?\"    They looked round the loft, but, with the exception of the old sacking  lying at one end, the place was bare.    \"Here, come to the end, Jem, and let me have another try,\" said Don.    \"Right, sir; come on,\" cried Jem; and going right to the end of the  loft, he bent his body a little and leaned his hands against the wall.    This simplified matters.    \"Stand fast, Jem,\" cried Don, and taking a spring, he landed upon his  companion's broad back, leap-frog fashion, but only to jump off again.    \"What's the matter, Mas' Don?\"    \"Only going to take off my shoes.\"    \"Ah, 'twill be better.  I didn't grumble before, but you did hurt, sir.\"    Don slipped off his shoes, uttered a word or two of warning, and once  more mounted on Jem's back.  It was easy then to get into a kneeling,  and then to a standing, position, the wall being at hand to steady him.    \"That's your sort, Mas' Don.  Now hold fast, and step up on to my  shoulders as I rise myself up; that's the way,\" he continued, slowly  straightening himself, and placing his hands behind Don's legs, as he  stood up, steadily, facing the wall.    \"What next, Jem?\"    \"Next, sir?  Why, I'm going to walk slowly back under the window, for  you to try and open it, and look out and see where we are.  Ready?\"    \"Yes.\"    \"Hold tight, sir.\"    \"But there's nothing to hold by, Jem, when you move away.\"    \"Then you must stand fast, sir, and I'll balance you like.  I can do  it.\"    Don drew a long breath, and felt no faith, for as soon as Jem moved  steadily from the wall, his ability in balancing was not great.    \"Stand firm, sir.  I've got you,\" he said.    \"Am I too heavy, Jem?\"    \"Heavy?  No, sir; I could carry two on you.  Stand fast; 'tarn't far.  Stand fast.  That's your sort.  Stand--oh!\"    Everything depended upon him, and poor Jem did his best; but after three  or four steps Don felt that he was going, and to save himself from a  fall he tried to jump lightly down.    This would have been easy enough had not Jem been so earnest.  He, too,  felt that it was all wrong, and to save his companion, he tightened his  hold of the calves of Don's legs as the lad stood erect on his  shoulders.    The consequence was that he gave Don sufficient check as he leaped to  throw him off his balance; and in his effort to save him, Jem lost his  own, and both came down with a crash and sat up and rubbed and looked at  each other.    \"Arn't hurt, are you, Mas' Don?\"    \"Not hurt?\" grumbled Don.  \"I am hurt horribly.\"    \"I'm very sorry, sir; so am I.  But I arn't broke nowhere!  Are you?\"    \"Broken?  No!\" said Don rising.  \"There, let's try again.\"    \"To be sure, sir.  Come, I like that.\"    \"Look here, Jem.  When you straighten up, let me steady myself with my  hands on the sloping ceiling there; now try.\"    The former process was gone through, after listening to find all silent  below; and Don stood erect once more, supporting himself by the wall.    \"Now edge round gently, Jem.  That's right.\"    Jem obeyed, and by progressing very slowly, they got to within about ten  feet of the window, which Don saw that he could reach easily, when the  balance was lost once more.    \"Don't hold, Jem!\" cried Don; and he leaped backwards, to come down all  right this time.    By no means discouraged, they went back to the end; and this time, by  progressing more slowly, the window was reached, and, to their great  delight, Don found that it was fastened inside, opening outwards by  means of a couple of hinges at the highest end, and provided with a  ratchet, to keep it open to any distance required.    \"Can you bear me if I try to open it, Jem?\"    \"Can I?  Ah!\"    Jem was a true bearer, standing as fast as a small elephant as Don  opened the window, and then supporting himself by a beam which ran  across the opening, thrust out his head and surveyed the exterior.    He was not long in making out their position--in the top floor of a  warehouse, the roof sloping, so that escape along it was impossible,  while facing him was the blank wall of a higher building, evidently on  the other side of a narrow alley.  Don looked to right, but there was no  means of making their position known so as to ask for help.  To the left  he was no better off, and seeing that the place had been well chosen as  a temporary lock-up for the impressed men, Don prepared to descend.    \"Better shut the window fust, Mas' Don.\"    The suggestion was taken, and then Don leaped down and faced his  fellow-prisoner, repeating the information he had roughly communicated  before.    \"Faces a alley, eh?\" said Jem.  \"Can't we go along the roof.\"    \"I don't believe a cat could go in safety, Jem.\"    \"Well, we aren't cats, Mas' Don, are we?  Faces a alley, eh?  Wasn't  there no windows opposit'?\"    \"Nothing but a blank wall.\"    \"Well, it's all right, Mas' Don.  We'd better set to work.  Only wants a  rope with one end fastened in here, and then we could slide down.\"    \"Yes,\" said Don gloomily; \"the window is unfastened, and the way clear,  but where's the rope?\"    \"There,\" said Jem, and he pointed to the end of the loft.        CHAPTER FOURTEEN.    WORKING UNDER DIFFICULTIES.    \"There.  Those sacks?\"    \"That's it, Mas' Don.  I've got my knife.  You got yourn?\"    \"Yes.\"    \"Then here goes, then, to unravel them sacks till we've got enough to  make a rope.  This loft's a capital place to twist him.  It's all right,  sir, only help me work away, and to-night we'll be safe home.\"    \"To-night, Jem?  Not before?\"    \"Why, we sha'n't have the rope ready; and if we had, it would be no use  to try by daylight.  No, sir; we must wait till it's dark, and work  away.  If we hear any one coming we can hide the rope under the other  sacks; so come on.\"    They seated themselves at the end of the loft, and worked away rapidly  unravelling the sacking and rolling the yarn up into balls, each of  which was hidden as soon as it became of any size.    As the hours went on, and they were not interrupted, the dread increased  that they might be summoned to descend as prisoners before they had  completed their work; but Jem's rough common sense soon suggested that  this was not likely to be the case.    \"Not afore night, Mas' Don,\" he said.  \"They won't take us aboard in the  day.  We're smuggled goods, we are; and if they don't mind, we shall be  too many for them.  'Nother hour, and I shall begin to twist up our  rope.\"    About midday the same sailor came up and brought them some bread and  meat.    \"That's right, my lads,\" he said.  \"You're taking it sensible, and"]]]
