It was not the first time one  of the players had been overcome by the heavy fumes.    Into the cloud dashed some of the head property man's helpers. Russ and  Paul, who could leave their posts while the camera was not in motion,  also penetrated the murkiness.    Fortunately, Alice had been overcome when within a few feet of the clear  atmosphere, and it was the work of but an instant for Paul to carry her  outside, where she could breathe pure air.    \"The poor dear!\" cried Mrs. Maguire. \"Here, give her this ammonia and  water.\"    \"Don't come too close to her, Mrs. Maguire!\" warned the director. \"Your  black make-up will come off on her face, and it will show in the film.\"    The director had to think of all those things, though it might seem a  bit heartless.    \"I'll be careful,\" promised the motherly old woman. \"I'll be careful.\"    Alice sipped the aromatic spirits of ammonia, and felt better.    \"Did I faint?\" she asked. \"How silly of me!\"    \"Are you all right?\" asked Ruth, still in her place by the side of the  soldier, who was supposed to be unconscious.    \"Yes, Ruth dear. I'm all right now. Oh, and did I leave you to carry him  all alone? I'm so sorry!\"    \"It was all right. I dragged him.\"    \"Yes, the scene is all right,\" said Mr. Pertell. \"Now, Alice, I don't  want to be heartless, but will you be ready to go on in this, or shall  we abandon it and make a retake?\"    \"Oh, I'll go on. Just a moment, and I'll be all right.\"    After a minute or two the plucky girl recovered from the effects of the  smoke, and, though she was weak and wan, managed to go through her part.  She and Ruth carried their \"cousin\" out of the burning barn which was  then allowed to fall to ruins. Or rather, the extra part, built on for  the purpose, was, Pop Snook's smoke bombs effectually concealing from  the audience the fact that the real barn was not in the least harmed.    \"Well, I'm glad that's over,\" said Alice with a sigh, as a little later  she washed off her make-up and donned her ordinary clothes.    \"Do you feel bad?\" her sister asked.    \"Yes, sort of choked.\"    \"Then let's take a walk up on the hill where there is always a breeze.\"    On the grassy eminence with the fresh breezes blowing about them, Alice  soon felt much better. But Mr. Pertell called off some of the scenes set  down for next day, so that she might have a rest.    \"We'll soon be ready for the big hospital scene, Ruth, and also for the  one where you try to get away with the papers, Alice,\" said Mr. Pertell  to the two girls one day. \"And, in order that everything may run  smoothly I've made a little change in the scenario. I'm going to have a  preliminary hospital scene. In that you will be a sort of orderly, or  assistant nurse, Ruth. And there comes an emergency in which you do so  well that you are sent for to be a nurse in one of the big hospitals  maintained near the front. That will make the story more logical.    \"So we'll have one of those hospital scenes to-day. I'll stage a small  engagement, and have a number of men wounded. They'll be brought in, and  there will be a night scene. The doctors and other nurses go off duty,  and you are in charge. An emergency occurs--maybe a bandage slips from  an artery and you sit and hold the wound until a doctor can come and tie  the artery again. We'll work it out as we go along.\"    \"Is there anything for me?\" asked Alice.    \"No, your part will stand all right as it is until you get to the big  hospital scene. Come on now, Ruth; we'll have a rehearsal.\"    The rehearsal went off well, and the little change promised to  strengthen the story of the war play. The hospital was set up near Mr.  Apgar's corn-crib.    \"And maybe that'll be a good thing,\" he said. \"If you folks use enough  of them there disinfectants and carbolic acid, you may scare away all  the rats and mice that eat my corn in the winter.\"    \"Oh! will there be rats and mice?\" asked Ruth, apprehensively.    \"Not in the hospital,\" said Mr. Pertell with a laugh. \"It will be  strictly sanitary--as much so as things were in the days of  sixty-three.\"    The fight between the two forces was staged some distance away from the  hospital, and the guns soon began to rattle and to roar again. The girls  did not mind them by this time, however.    This skirmish had no particular part in the general story, but it was  filmed just the same, as it could be spliced in with the other fighting  scenes.    \"And you can't get too much of that,\" Mr. Pertell said.    Russ, with some helpers, was taking the fighting pictures preliminary to  the hospital act. He was nearing the end of the reel in his machine  when, to his dismay, he found he had forgotten to bring a spare one.    \"Here, you!\" he called to one of the extra soldiers lying lazily on the  grass near the camera, \"hop over and ask Pop Snooks to give you an extra  reel for me.\"    The man did not answer.    \"Don't you hear me?\" yelled Russ, grinding away at the film which was  being quickly used up. \"Go and get me that reel!\"    Still no response.    \"Are you deaf?\" shouted Russ, and then he thought perhaps the discharge  of so many cannon had made the man unable to hear.    \"Go over and punch that fellow!\" cried Russ to Paul. \"Wake him up, and  tell him to get me that extra reel.\"    \"All right,\" Paul assented. \"I'd go myself only I have to carry a  message to headquarters in a minute or two.\"    He ran over and kicked the soldier, who seemed to be asleep.    \"Hi! What's the idea?\" demanded the rudely awakened one.    \"The camera man wants you to go to get him some film.\"    \"Who--me?\"    \"Yes--you! Skip!\"    \"I can't go get no film!\"    \"You can't? Why not?\"    \"'Cause I'm dead, that's why! I was told to be killed, and I was. I fell  off my hoss dead, an' I'm deader'n a door nail. I dassn't git up to git  no film for nobody. I'm dead!\"    And the man rolled over and closed his eyes.          CHAPTER XVI    A RETAKE      \"What's the matter over there?\" called Russ to Paul. \"Is he going to get  my film?\"    \"He says he can't.\"    \"Can't? Why not? Has he lost his legs?\"    \"No. But he's dead. This is carrying realism to the extreme.\"    \"Oh, good-night!\" cried Russ. \"I haven't but a few feet left. Make him  go.\"    \"I won't go I tell you,\" the man cried. \"I was told to play dead, and  I'm goin' to,\" and he stuck to the instructions he had received.    Fortunately, one of Russ' helpers was free a moment later, and he went  for the extra roll of film, while the dead man enjoyed his part to his  satisfaction.    \"Well, he did just right,\" said Mr. Pertell, when told of the incident  afterward. \"I wish more performers would do exactly as they are told. Of  course, I don't mean to say a player must slavishly do just as I tell  him. But in some cases a dead man's coming to life might spoil a big  scene.\"    Matters were now in readiness for the preliminary hospital scene. A ward  had been fitted up in a shed where electric lights could be used to get  the necessary illumination, the current being brought from town. In the  shed were ranged white beds, in which a number of wounded men were  reposing. Other men were in wheeled chairs, while still others sat up as  if recovering from a long and dangerous siege from wounds. All were  picturesquely bandaged.    The preliminary scenes had been taken. The doctor had made his rounds of  the wounded on the cots. He had taken their temperature and had felt  their pulses, while the other women of the company, as nurses,  accompanied the surgeon on his journey. Other wounded were brought in.    Night settled down in the hospital. The big, hissing electric lights  were turned off, and from outside a window \"moonlight\" streamed in. The  moonlight, of course was made by another electric light, properly  shaded.    \"Now, I think we're ready for you, Ruth,\" said the director. \"You are on  duty alone in the ward when the emergency occurs.\"    In the glow of the beams of light from the window Ruth, on duty alone,  took her place.    \"All ready now!\" called Mr. Pertell, from where he was standing behind  Russ, who was grinding away at the camera. \"You start from your  half-doze, Ruth, and listen. Then you approach one of the cots and  discover that the bandage has slipped and that the man is bleeding to  death. You press on the artery, and finally rouse another of the  hospital patients--one not badly wounded--and send him for the surgeon.\"    Ruth carried out the instructions perfectly. Her acting was so very  natural that afterward, when the film was shown, more than one person  found himself holding his breath lest Ruth should remove her thumb from  the severed artery.    The slightly wounded man limped out to get the surgeon, who came rushing  in, and the artery was tied. Then followed words of praise for Ruth.  This laid the foundation for her summons to a larger hospital when the  proper time came.    The next day more battle views were the order of the day. In one of  these Estelle had to do some fast riding, to leap her horse across a  ditch and speed away from pursuing troopers.    \"Aren't you nervous for fear you'll fall?\" asked Ruth, as the young  horsewoman was making ready.    \"Well, no. I don't think about that part. All I am afraid of is that I  may get out of range of the camera. You see I'm not very old at this  business.\"    \"Just how did you come to get into it?\" asked Alice.    \"Why, it was a sort of accident. I was on a boat one day, leaning over  the rail looking at the water, when a gentleman came up, begged my  pardon for speaking without being introduced, and asked me if I had ever  been in the movies.    \"I hadn't, though I had often thought I would like to be, and I told him  so. He asked me to call at his studio, and I did. They gave me a 'try  out,' found I photographed well, and they cast me for small parts. Then  they found out I could ride and"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/20386"],[0,"Embroidery and Tapestry Weaving (#16)"],[1,"; the cut edges are outlined and protected by an  overcast stitch. The pattern has to be specially planned with the idea  of holding strongly together, but, if necessary, buttonholed bars can be  added to form strengthening ties in any weak part.    Another kind of cut work is that known as _broderie anglaise_, and  sometimes as Madeira work, over which our grandmothers spent much time,  perhaps without adequate result. The pattern is followed out by round  holes pierced in the linen with a stiletto and then overcast round the  edges. At the present day the work is done mostly by machinery, though  hand work also is procurable.    [Illustration: Fig. 120.]    Perhaps the prettiest kind of cut work is that in which various-shaped  spaces are cut out of the linen, and these filled in, in part, with  some design built up with stitches. There are various methods of  refilling the spaces cut out, one of the simplest is a diapering formed  by some lace stitch, such as an open buttonhole. As a rule, the  decoration of the open spaces is based upon bars of thread that are  either composed of warp or woof threads left, instead of being cut away,  or else upon fresh threads thrown across in various directions. The  pattern is planned on and about these strengthening ties, and where  necessary receiving support from them. An ingenious worker will soon  devise ways of refilling the spaces by all kinds of interesting  patterns, which can be geometrical or floral, or any kinds of objects  that can be attractively represented in conventional fashion, such as  figures, birds, insects, ships in full sail, or anything else. It must,  however, be remembered that the various forms filling the spaces are for  use in the way of strength as well as for ornament, and that the work is  often put upon objects that have to endure daily wear.    Open work is frequently mixed with other, and especially with white  embroidery, and such things as counterpanes may be seen arranged with a  chequering of alternate squares of embroidered linen and open work.    Fig. 121 shows in progress a simple method of filling a space, mainly  making use of the strengthening threads that have been left at regular  intervals over the cut part. The threads are covered with an overcast  stitch, and alternate squares of those that recur over the space are  decorated with a cross. This is made by the working thread, after  reaching the right point at the centre of an overcast line, being thrown  across the space and then twisted back over itself to the  starting-point, where it is in the right position for continuing the  overcast line. The crosses being put in at the same time as the  overcasting of the bars renders some forethought necessary to get each  in at just the right time and place.    [Illustration: Fig. 121.]    [Illustration: Fig. 122.]    Another kind of filling can be seen in progress in fig. 122. The  stitches used in it are overcast and buttonhole. With the help of this  last-mentioned stitch patterns of all kinds can be carried out, for each  succeeding row of the stitch can be worked into the heading of the last  row, and in this way it is possible to build up any required shape. This  figure is a working diagram of a piece of cut work of which the  completed square with its surrounding decoration can be seen in fig. 34.  After overcasting the raw edges a diagonal thread is thrown across (E D  on plan), upon which the pattern shall be built up; the thread is taken  once to and fro and then twisted back again for a third crossing.  Commence by overcasting the threads from point D, and upon reaching the  part where the pattern is widened out, change the stitch to an open  buttonholing (as shown on line B). It is worked openly in this way in  order to leave space for another row of the same kind of stitching to be  fitted in from the opposite side, which is the next thing to be done.  Then an outer row of buttonhole stitch is worked on each side of the  central bar and into the heading of the first row of stitching; this is  shown in progress where the needle is at work. The entire pattern is  carried out in this way, first laying down foundation threads in the  necessary places and then covering them up with either overcasting or  buttonhole stitch as required. It is easily possible to carry out  flowers and all kinds of other things sufficiently well to make them  pleasantly recognisable.

Gold and silver threads have always played an important part in  embroidered work, and are a most valuable addition to the worker's stock  of materials, for they give a splendour and richness that is not  obtainable in any other way. They have been utilised from the earliest  times in both embroidery and weaving; in scripture and other ancient  historical writings there is abundant proof of this fact.    The earliest form of gold thread in use was the pure metal beaten into  thin plates and then cut into long narrow strips; that it was sometimes  rounded into wire form is very probable. The first wire-drawing machine  is said to have been invented by a workman at Nuremberg, but it was not  until two centuries later that the drawing-mills were introduced into  England.    Gold thread, similar to that we now use, entwined about a silk one, is  mentioned in a XIVth century Latin poem; also, it is known that in the  XIIIth century our English ladies prepared their own gold thread before  working it in, and it was of the same type as ours, the gold being  spirally twisted round a thread of silk or flax.[10]    To be a skilled worker with gold thread needs considerable application  and practice. There is much variety in the work, some branches of it  being more simple to manipulate than others. It is desirable for all  workers to understand something of gold work, for it is frequently  employed in conjunction with other embroidery, as well as alone. Fig.  123 shows a couched line of gold thread outlining some silk embroidery,  which gives a pretty jewel-like effect of something precious in a  setting of gold.    [Illustration: Fig. 123.]    Gold embroidery may be divided roughly into three main classes, outline  work, solid flat work, and raised work. Outline work is, as far as  technique is concerned, one of the simplest forms of gold embroidery.  The pattern is followed round with a gold cord or double thread of  passing, fixed either visibly or invisibly with a couching stitch; the  work needs but an interesting design and suitable background to be most  successful. Fig. 124 illustrates a portion of a design, carried out with  gold cord upon a velvet ground, which has been further enriched by the  addition of little applied white flowers. The raised work, and that  which introduces the use of purls and bullions, is at once more  complicated, and perhaps hardly as pleasing as the simpler flat work.    [Illustration: Fig. 124.]    The method of applying the gold to the material is usually by couching  of one form or another, for most of the threads are too inflexible to  be stitched through. The ground, if it shows at all, is usually a rich  stuff, such as velvet, satin, or silk, in order to be in keeping with  the valuable thread. If the ground chosen is difficult to work upon, the  embroidery is carried out upon linen, and the finished work afterwards  applied to the ground. If both background and pattern are solidly  embroidered, linen can be used as the permanent ground. It is usual to  have two layers of material for working upon, for gold threads are heavy  and require the support of the double ground. There are several  advantages in this double material, as the old workers knew, for we find  they commonly used two. The under-layer can be a strong linen, and the  surface one silk, satin, or a fine linen, as required.      MATERIALS    A variety of metal threads are manufactured for embroidery purposes, and  they are all obtainable in gold, silver, or imitations of these;  aluminium thread has been made lately, and has the advantage of being  untarnishable, but its colour and quality do not seem quite  satisfactory, and it is not popular. The imitation threads are never  worth the using; they tarnish to a worse colour, and are more difficult  in manipulation; what goes by the name of real gold, is silver or  copper, plated with the more valuable metal. The pure gold thread is  said not to be so practical as this, being too brittle; but somehow or  other it was more successfully manufactured in the past than nowadays,  for some gold work six centuries old exhibits beautifully bright  threads.    The following list comprises the chief threads used in this work:--    _Passing._--This is a bright smooth thread, resembling in appearance a  gold wire; it consists of a narrow flat strip of gold spirally twisted  round a silken thread. It can be obtained in different sizes, the finest  qualities going by the name of tambour. Most passing has to be couched  on to the material, but it is possible to stitch in the tambour like  ordinary thread.    _Purl._--This resembles a smooth round hollow tube of metal, very  pliable and elastic; when pulled lengthways it is found to be  constructed like a closely coiled spiral spring. It is manufactured in  lengths of about one yard, and for use it is cut into small sections of  any required size with scissors or a knife. There are several varieties  of purl, namely, the smooth, rough, check, and wire check. The smooth  has a bright polished appearance, which is obtained by a flat gold wire"]]]
