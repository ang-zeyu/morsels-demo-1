We have seen, in the story about the Chudo-Yudo, that the place  usually occupied by the Snake is at times filled by some other magical  being. This frequently occurs in that class of stories which relates  how three brothers set out to apprehend a trespasser, or to seek a  mother or sister who has been mysteriously spirited away. They usually  come either to an opening which leads into the underground world, or  to the base of an apparently inaccessible hill. The youngest brother  descends or ascends as the case may be, and after a series of  adventures which generally lead him through the kingdoms of copper, of  silver, and of gold, returns in triumph to where his brothers are  awaiting him. And he is almost invariably deserted by them, as soon as  they have secured the beautiful princesses who accompany him--as may  be read in the following (South-Russian) history of--        THE NORKA.[85]      Once upon a time there lived a king and queen. They had three    sons, two of them with their wits about them, but the third a    simpleton. Now the King had a deer-park in which were quantities    of wild animals of different kinds. Into that park there    used to come a huge beast--Norka was its name--and do fearful    mischief, devouring some of the animals every night. The King    did all he could, but he was unable to destroy it. So at last he    called his sons together and said: \"Whoever will destroy the    Norka, to him will I give the half of my kingdom.\"      Well, the eldest son undertook the task. As soon as it was    night, he took his weapons and set out. But before he reached    the park, he went into a _traktir_ (or tavern), and there he spent    the whole night in revelry. When he came to his senses it was    too late; the day had already dawned. He felt himself disgraced    in the eyes of his father, but there was no help for it. The next    day the second son went, and did just the same. Their father    scolded them both soundly, and there was an end of it.      Well, on the third day the youngest son undertook the task.    They all laughed him to scorn, because he was so stupid, feeling    sure he wouldn't do anything. But he took his arms, and went    straight into the park, and sat down on the grass in such a position    that, the moment he went asleep, his weapons would prick    him, and he would awake.      Presently the midnight hour sounded. The earth began to    shake, and the Norka came rushing up, and burst right through    the fence into the park, so huge was it. The Prince pulled himself    together, leapt to his feet, crossed himself, and went straight    at the beast. It fled back, and the Prince ran after it. But he    soon saw that he couldn't catch it on foot, so he hastened to the    stable, laid his hands on the best horse there, and set off in    pursuit. Presently he came up with the beast, and they began a    fight. They fought and fought; the Prince gave the beast three    wounds. At last they were both utterly exhausted, so they lay    down to take a short rest. But the moment the Prince closed his    eyes, up jumped the Beast and took to flight. The Prince's horse    awoke him; up he jumped in a moment, and set off again in    pursuit, caught up the Beast, and again began fighting with it.    Again the Prince gave the Beast three wounds, and then he and    the Beast lay down again to rest. Thereupon away fled the    Beast as before. The Prince caught it up, and again gave it    three wounds. But all of a sudden, just as the Prince began    chasing it for the fourth time, the Beast fled to a great white    stone, tilted it up, and escaped into the other world,[86] crying out    to the Prince: \"Then only will you overcome me, when you    enter here.\"      The Prince went home, told his father all that had happened,    and asked him to have a leather rope plaited, long enough to    reach to the other world. His father ordered this to be done.    When the rope was made, the Prince called for his brothers, and    he and they, having taken servants with them, and everything that    was needed for a whole year, set out for the place where the    Beast had disappeared under the stone. When they got there,    they built a palace on the spot, and lived in it for some time.    But when everything was ready, the youngest brother said to    the others: \"Now, brothers, who is going to lift this stone?\"      Neither of them could so much as stir it, but as soon as he    touched it, away it flew to a distance, though it was ever so big--big    as a hill. And when he had flung the stone aside, he spoke    a second time to his brothers, saying:      \"Who is going into the other world, to overcome the Norka?\"      Neither of them offered to do so. Then he laughed at them    for being such cowards, and said:      \"Well, brothers, farewell! Lower me into the other world,    and don't go away from here, but as soon as the cord is jerked,    pull it up.\"      His brothers lowered him accordingly, and when he had    reached the other world, underneath the earth, he went on his    way. He walked and walked. Presently he espied a horse with    rich trappings, and it said to him:      \"Hail, Prince Ivan! Long have I awaited thee!\"      He mounted the horse and rode on--rode and rode, until he    saw standing before him, a palace made of copper. He entered    the courtyard, tied up his horse, and went indoors. In one of    the rooms a dinner was laid out. He sat down and dined, and    then went into a bedroom. There he found a bed, on which he    lay down to rest. Presently there came in a lady, more beautiful    than can be imagined anywhere but in a skazka, who said:      \"Thou who art in my house, name thyself! If thou art an    old man, thou shall be my father; if a middle-aged man, my    brother; but if a young man, thou shalt be my husband dear.    And if thou art a woman, and an old one, thou shalt be my grandmother;    if middle-aged, my mother; and if a girl, thou shalt be    my own sister.\"[87]      Thereupon he came forth. And when she saw him, she was    delighted with him, and said:      \"Wherefore, O Prince Ivan--my husband dear shalt thou be!--wherefore    hast thou come hither?\"      Then he told her all that had happened, and she said:      \"That beast which thou wishest to overcome is my brother.    He is staying just now with my second sister, who lives not far    from here in a silver palace. I bound up three of the wounds    which thou didst give him.\"      Well, after this they drank, and enjoyed themselves, and held    sweet converse together, and then the prince took leave of her,    and went on to the second sister, the one who lived in the silver    palace, and with her also he stayed awhile. She told him that    her brother Norka was then at her youngest sister's. So he    went on to the youngest sister, who lived in a golden palace.    She told him that her brother was at that time asleep on the    blue sea, and she gave him a sword of steel and a draught of the    Water of Strength, and she told him to cut off her brother's    head at a single stroke. And when he had heard these things,    he went his way.      And when the Prince came to the blue sea, he looked--there    slept Norka on a stone in the middle of the sea; and when it    snored, the water was agitated for seven versts around. The    Prince crossed himself, went up to it and smote it on the head    with his sword. The head jumped off, saying the while, \"Well,    I'm done for now!\" and rolled far away into the sea.      After killing the Beast, the Prince went back again, picking    up all the three sisters by the way, with the intention of taking    them out into the upper world: for they all loved him and would    not be separated from him. Each of them turned her palace    into an egg--for they were all enchantresses--and they taught    him how to turn the eggs into palaces, and back again, and they    handed over the eggs to him. And then they all went to the    place from which they had to be hoisted into the upper world.    And when they came to where the rope was, the Prince took    hold of it and made the maidens fast to it.[88] Then he jerked    away at the rope, and his brothers began to haul it up. And    when they had hauled it up, and had set eyes on the wondrous    maidens, they went aside and said: \"Let's lower the rope, pull    our brother part of the way up, and then cut the rope. Perhaps    he'll be killed; but then if he isn't, he'll never give us these    beauties as wives.\"      So when they had agreed on this, they lowered the rope.    But their brother was no fool; he guessed what they were at,    so he fastened the rope to a stone, and then gave it a pull.    His brothers hoisted the stone to a great height, and then cut    the rope. Down fell the stone and broke in pieces; the Prince    poured forth tears and went away. Well, he walked and walked.    Presently a storm arose; the lightning flashed, the thunder    roared, the rain fell in torrents. He went up to a tree in order    to take shelter under it, and on that tree he saw some young    birds which were being thoroughly drenched. So he took off    his coat and covered them over with it, and he himself sat down    under the tree. Presently there came flying a bird--such a big    one, that the light was blotted out by it. It had been dark    there before, but now it became darker still. Now this was the    mother of those small birds which the Prince had covered up.    And when the bird had come flying up, she perceived that her    little ones were covered over, and she said, \"Who has wrapped    up my nestlings?\" and presently, seeing the Prince, she added:    \"Didst thou do that? Thanks! In return, ask of me any    thing thou desirest. I will do anything for thee.\"      \"Th"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/22381"],[0,"Myths and Legends of Ancient Greece and Rome (#16)"],[1,"Apollo and Artemis. The  sacrilegious words had scarcely passed her lips before Apollo called upon  his sister Artemis to assist him in avenging the insult offered to their  mother, and soon their invisible arrows sped through the air. Apollo slew  all the sons, and Artemis had already slain all the daughters save one, the  youngest and best beloved, whom Niobe clasped in her arms, when the  agonized mother implored the enraged deities to leave her, at least, one  out of all her beautiful children; but, even as she prayed, the deadly  arrow reached the heart of this child also. Meanwhile the unhappy father,  unable to bear the loss of his children, had destroyed himself, and his  dead body lay beside the lifeless corpse of his favourite son. Widowed and  childless, the heart-broken mother sat among her dead, and the gods, in  pity for her unutterable woe, turned her into a stone, which they  transferred to Siphylus, her native Phrygian mountain, where it still  continues to shed tears.    [Illustration]    The punishment of Niobe forms the subject of a magnificent marble group,  which was found at Rome in the year 1553, and is now in the gallery of  Uffizi, at Florence.    The renowned singer Orpheus was the son of Apollo and Calliope, the muse of  epic poetry, and, as might be expected with parents so highly gifted, was  endowed with most distinguished intellectual qualifications. He was a poet,  a teacher of the religious doctrines known as the Orphic mysteries, and a  great musician, having inherited from his father an extraordinary genius  for music. {81} When he sang to the sweet tones of his lyre, he charmed all  nature, and summoned round him the wild beasts of the forests, who, under  the influence of his music, became tame and gentle as lambs. The madly  rushing torrents stopped their rapid course, and the very mountains and  trees moved from their places at the sound of his entrancing melodies.    Orpheus became united to a lovely nymph named Eurydice, the daughter of the  sea-god Nereus, whom he fondly loved. She was no less attached to him, and  their married life was full of joy and happiness. But it was only  short-lived; for Aristaeus,[31] the half-brother of Orpheus, having fallen  in love with the beautiful Eurydice, forcibly endeavoured to take her from  her husband, and as she fled across some fields to elude his pursuit, she  was bitten in the foot by a venomous snake, which lay concealed in the long  grass. Eurydice died of the wound, and her sorrowing husband filled the  groves and valleys with his piteous and unceasing lamentations.    His longing to behold her once more became at last so unconquerable, that  he determined to brave the horrors of the lower world, in order to entreat  Aides to restore to him his beloved wife. Armed only with his golden lyre,  the gift of Apollo, he descended into the gloomy depths of Hades, where his  heavenly music arrested for a while the torments of the unhappy sufferers.  The stone of Sisyphus remained motionless; Tantalus forgot his perpetual  thirst; the wheel of Ixion ceased to revolve; and even the Furies shed  tears, and withheld for a time their persecutions. Undismayed at the scenes  of horror and suffering which met his view on every side, he pursued his  way until he arrived at the palace of Aides. Presenting himself before the  throne on which sat the stony-hearted king and his consort Persephone,  Orpheus recounted his woes to the sound of his lyre. Moved to pity by his  sweet strains, they listened to his {82} melancholy story, and consented to  release Eurydice on condition that he should not look upon her until they  reached the upper world. Orpheus gladly promised to comply with this  injunction, and, followed by Eurydice, ascended the steep and gloomy path  which led to the realms of life and light. All went well until he was just  about to pass the extreme limits of Hades, when, forgetting for the moment  the hard condition, he turned to convince himself that his beloved wife was  really behind him. The glance was fatal, and destroyed all his hopes of  happiness; for, as he yearningly stretched out his arms to embrace her, she  was caught back, and vanished from his sight for ever. The grief of Orpheus  at this second loss was even more intense than before, and he now avoided  all human society. In vain did the nymphs, his once chosen companions,  endeavour to win him back to his accustomed haunts; their power to charm  was gone, and music was now his sole consolation. He wandered forth alone,  choosing the wildest and most secluded paths, and the hills and vales  resounded with his pathetic melodies. At last he happened to cross the path  of some Thracian women, who were performing the wild rites of Dionysus  (Bacchus), and in their mad fury at his refusing to join them, they  furiously attacked him, and tore him in pieces. In pity for his unhappy  fate, the Muses collected his remains, which they buried at the foot of  Mount Olympus, and the nightingale warbled a funeral dirge over his grave.  His head was thrown into the river Hebrus, and as it floated down the  stream, the lips still continued to murmur the beloved name of Eurydice.    The chief seat of the worship of Apollo was at Delphi, and here was the  most magnificent of all his temples, the foundation of which reaches far  beyond all historical knowledge, and which contained immense riches, the  offerings of kings and private persons, who had received favourable replies  from the oracle. The Greeks believed Delphi to be the central point of the  earth, because two eagles sent forth by Zeus, one from the east, the other  {83} from the west, were said to have arrived there at the same moment.    The Pythian games, celebrated in honour of the victory of Apollo over the  Python, took place at Delphi every four years. At the first celebration of  these games, gods, goddesses, and heroes contended for the prizes, which  were at first of gold or silver, but consisted, in later times, of simple  laurel wreaths.    On account of its being the place of his birth, the whole island of Delos  was consecrated to Apollo, where he was worshipped with great solemnity;  the greatest care was taken to preserve the sanctity of the spot, for which  reason no one was suffered to be buried there. At the foot of Mount Cynthus  was a splendid temple of Apollo which possessed an oracle, and was enriched  with magnificent offerings from all parts of Greece. Even foreign nations  held this island sacred, for when the Persians passed it on their way to  attack Greece, they not only sailed by, leaving it uninjured, but sent rich  presents to the temple. Games, called Delia, instituted by Theseus, were  celebrated at Delos every four years.    A festival termed the Gymnopedaea was held at Sparta in honour of Apollo, in  which boys sang the praises of the gods, and of the three hundred  Lacedaemonians who fell at the battle of Thermopylae.    Wolves and hawks were sacrificed to Apollo, and the birds sacred to him  were the hawk, raven, and swan.    ROMAN APOLLO.    The worship of Apollo never occupied the all-important position in Rome  which it held in Greece, nor was it introduced till a comparatively late  period. There was no sanctuary erected to this divinity until B.C. 430,  when the Romans, in order to avert a plague, built a temple in his honour;  but we do not find the worship of Apollo becoming in any way prominent  until the time of Augustus, who, having called upon this god for aid before  the famous battle of Actium, ascribed the victory which he {84} gained, to  his influence, and accordingly erected a temple there, which he enriched  with a portion of the spoil.    Augustus afterwards built another temple in honour of Apollo, on the  Palatine Hill, in which at the foot of his statue, were deposited two gilt  chests, containing the Sibylline oracles. These oracles were collected to  replace the Sibylline books originally preserved in the temple of Jupiter,  which were destroyed when that edifice was burned.    [Illustration]    The Sibyls were maidens who had received the gift of prophecy, and the  privilege of living to an incredible age. One of these Sibyls (known as the  Cumaean) appeared to Tarquinius Superbus, the last king of Rome, offering  for sale nine books, which she informed him had been written by herself.  Not knowing who she was, Tarquin refused to buy them, upon which she burned  three, and returned with six, demanding the same price as before. Being  again driven away as an impostor, she again retired and burned three more,  returning with the remaining three, for which she still asked the same  price as at first. Tarquin, amazed at her inconsistency, now consulted the  Augurs, who blamed him for not having bought the nine books when they were  first offered to him, and desired him to secure the remaining three, at  whatever price they were to be had. He, accordingly, purchased the volumes,  which were found to contain predictions of great importance to the Romans.  After the disposal of the books, the Sibyl vanished, and was seen no more.    The most beautiful and renowned of all the statues of Apollo now in  existence, is that known as the Apollo Belvedere, which was found in 1503  among the ruins of {85} ancient Antium. It was purchased by Pope Julius  II., who removed it to the Belvedere of the Vatican, from whence it takes  its name, and where it has been, for more than three hundred years, the  admiration of the world. When Rome was taken, and plundered by the French,  this celebrated statue was transported to Paris, and placed in the museum  there, but in 1815 it was restored to its former place in the Vatican. The  attitude of the figure, which is more than seven feet high, is inimitable  in its freedom, grace, and majesty. The forehead is noble and intellectual,  and the whole countenance so exquisite in its beauty, that one pauses  spell-bound to gaze on so"]]]
