This illumination of the mind or the effect of the Divine Influence  differ in any prophet according to the capacity of the recipient, or  according to the circumstances--physical, moral, and religious--in which  he is placed.    [Footnote 130: The early followers of Mohammad bore persecutions and  exile with patience and steadfastness; and never recanted. Look to the  increasing number of these early Moslems, their magnanimous forbearance,  and the spontaneous abandonment of their dear homes and relations, and  their defending their Prophet with their blood. The number of Christian  believers during the whole lifetime of Christ was not more than 120 (Act  I, 15). They had a material view of the Messiah's kingdom, and had fled  at the first sound of danger. Two of the disciples when walking to  Emmaus observed, \"We trusted that it had been He who should have  redeemed Israel,\" and the apostle asked Jesus after the so-called  resurrection, \"Lord, wilt Thou at this time restore the kingdom of  Israel?\"    \"During the periods thus indicated as possible for comparison,  persecution and rejection were the fate of both. But the thirteen years'  ministry of Mahomet had brought about a far greater change to the  external eye than the whole lifetime of Christ. The apostles fled at the  first sound of danger, and however deep the inner work may have been in  the 500 by whom our Lord was seen, it had produced as yet but little  outward action. There was among them no spontaneous quitting of their  homes, nor emigration by hundreds, such as distinguished the early  Moslems; nor any rapturous resolution by the converts of a foreign city  to defend the Prophet with their blood.\"--The Life of Mahomet by Sir W.  Muir, Vol. II, page 274.]    [Footnote 131: \"Let us for a moment look back to the period when a ban  was proclaimed at Mecca against all the citizens, whether professed  converts or not, who espoused his cause; when they were shut up in the  _Sheb_ or quarter of Abu Talib, and there for three years without  prospect of relief endured want and hardship. Those must have been  steadfast and mighty motives which enabled him amidst all this  opposition and apparent hopelessness of success, to maintain his  principles unshaken. No sooner was he relieved from confinement, than,  despairing of his native city, he went forth to Tayif and summoned its  rulers and inhabitants to repentance; he was solitary and unaided, but  he had a message, he said, from his Lord. On the third day he was driven  out of the town with ignominy, blood trickling from the wounds inflicted  on him by the populace. He retired to a little distance, and there  poured forth his complaint to God: then he returned to Mecca, there to  carry on the same outwardly hopeless cause with the same high confidence  in its ultimate success. We search in vain through the pages of profane  history for a parallel to the struggle in which for thirteen years the  Prophet of Arabia in the face of discouragement and threats, rejection  and persecution retained his faith unwavering, preached repentance, and  denounced God's wrath against his godless fellow-citizens. Surrounded by  a little band of faithful men and women, he met insults, menaces,  dangers, with a high and patient trust in the future. And when at last  the promise of safety came from a distant quarter, he calmly waited  until his followers had all departed, and then disappeared from amongst  his ungrateful and rebellious people.\"--Muir, Vol. IV, pages 314-15.]    [Footnote 132: \"That he was the impostor pictured by some writers is  refuted alike by his unwavering belief in the truth of his own mission,  by the loyalty and unshaken confidence of his companions, who had ample  opportunity of forming a right estimate of his sincerity, and finally,  by the magnitude of the task which he brought to so successful an issue.  No impostor, it may safely be said, could have accomplished so mighty a  work. No one unsupported by a living faith in the reality of his  commission, in the goodness of his cause, could have maintained the same  consistent attitude through long years of adverse fortune, alike in the  day of victory and in the hour of defeat, in the plenitude of his power  and at the moment of death.\"--Islam and its Founder, by J.W.H. Stobart,  M.A., page 23.    \"Of the sincerity of his belief in his own mission there can be no  doubt. The great merit is his that among a people given up to idolatry  he rose to a vivid perception of the Unity of God, and preached this  great doctrine with firmness and constancy, amid ridicule and  persecution. But there it seems to me that the eulogy of the Prophet  ought to cease.\"--Islam under the Arabs by R.D. Osborn. London 1876, p.  90.]      [Sidenote: Striking effects of Mohammad's reforms.]    35. Although his mission was only to convey the message and preach  publicly what was revealed to him, and he was not responsible for the  conversion of the ungodly polytheists to the purer theology and higher  morality, or in other words, to the faith of Islam, yet whatever success  and beneficial results in the sphere of theology, morality, and reforms  in social matters he achieved was a strong evidence of his Divine  mission. In the name of God and in the character of His Apostle, he  wrought a great reform according to his light in his own country. \"Every  good tree bringeth forth good fruit.\"--(Matt. VII, 17). Facts are  stubborn things, and facts are conclusive in these points.    The effects produced by his preaching, and the changes wrought by them  in the religious, social, and political sphere of the polytheists, the  idolatrous and grossly superstitious Arabs within a comparatively short  period, mostly consisting of persecutions at Mecca, and struggles at  Medina, were very striking. From an indiscriminate mass of polytheism  and gross superstitious belief in gods, genii, the sons and daughters of  God, he gave them a pure monotheistic belief, recognizing no other  superior power but the Almighty. He raised the moral standard of his  countrymen, ameliorated the condition of women, curtailed and mitigated  polygamy and slavery, and virtually abolished them as well as  infanticide. He most sternly denounced and absolutely forbade many  heinous evils of the Arab society. He united a number of wild and  independent tribes into a nation and abolished their internecine wars.    Sir W. Muir says:--         \"Few and simple as the positive precepts of Mahomet up to this time       appear, they had wrought a marvellous and a mighty work. Never,       since the days when primitive Christianity startled the world from       its sleep, and waged a mortal combat with Heathenism, had men seen       the like arousing of spiritual life, the like faith that suffered       sacrifice and took joyfully the spoiling of goods for conscience       sake.         \"From time beyond memory, Mecca and the whole Peninsula had been       steeped into spiritual torpor. The slight and transient influence       of Judaism, Christianity, or Philosophy upon the Arab mind, had       been but as the ruffling here and there the surface of a quiet       lake;--all remained still and motionless below. The people were       sunk in superstition, cruelty, and vice. It was a common practice       for the eldest son to marry his father's widows inherited as       property with the rest of the estate. Pride and poverty had       introduced among them, as it has among the Hindus, the crime of       female infanticide. Their religion consisted in gross idolatry, and       their faith was rather the dark superstitious dread of unseen       beings, whose goodwill they sought to propitiate, and to avert       their displeasure, than the belief in an over-ruling Providence.       The Life to come and Retribution of good and evil were, as motives       of action, practically unknown.         \"Thirteen years before the Hegira, Mecca lay lifeless in this       debased state. What a change those thirteen years had now produced!       A band of several hundred persons had rejected idolatry, adopted       the worship of one great God, and surrendered themselves implicitly       to the guidance of what they believed a revelation from       Him;--praying to the Almighty with frequency and fervour, looking       for pardon through His mercy, and striving to follow after good       works, almsgiving, chastity and justice. They now lived under a       constant sense of the Omnipotent power of God, and of His       providential care over the minutest of their concerns. In all the       gifts of nature, in every relation of life, at each turn of their       affairs, individual or public, they saw His hand. And, above all,       the new spiritual existence in which they joyed and gloried, was       regarded as the mark of His especial grace, while the unbelief of       their blinded fellow-citizens was the hardening stamp of His       predestined reprobation. Mahomet was the minister of life to       them,--the source under God of their new-born hopes; and to him       they yielded a fitting and implicit submission.         \"In so short a period, Mecca had, from this wonderful movement,       been rent into two factions, which, unmindful of the old land-marks       of tribe and family, were arrayed in deadly opposition one against       the other. The believers bore persecution with a patient and       tolerant spirit. And though it was their wisdom so to do, the       credit of a magnanimous forbearance may be freely accorded to       them. One hundred men and women, rather than abjure the precious       faith, had abandoned their homes, and sought refuge, till the storm       should be overpast, in Abyssinian exile. And now even a larger       number, with the Prophet himself, emigrated from their fondly-loved       city, with its sacred temple,--to them the holiest spot on       earth,--and fled to Medina.
