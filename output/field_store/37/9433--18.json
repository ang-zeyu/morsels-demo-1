The  argument is not very convincing, because, for every kind of concrete  perception it is possible to establish an abstract category.    It might be said of colour that it is impossible to perceive it unless  it is known beforehand what colour is; and so on for a heap of other  things. A more serious argument consists in saying that relations are  _a priori_ because they have a character of universality and of  necessity which is not explained by experience, this last being always  contingent and peculiar. But it is not necessary that a function  should be mental for it to be _a priori_. The identification of the _a  priori_ with the mental is entirely gratuitous. We should here draw a  distinction between the two senses of the _a priori_: anteriority and  superiority.    A simple physical mechanism may be _a priori_, in the sense of  anteriority. A house is _a priori_, in regard to the lodgers it  receives; this book is _a priori_, in regard to its future readers.  There is no difficulty in imagining the structure of our nervous  system to be _a priori_, in regard to the excitements which are  propagated in it. A nerve cell is formed, with its protoplasm, its  nucleus and its nucleoli before being irritated; its properties  precede its functions. If it be possible to admit that as a  consequence of ancestral experiences the function has created the  organ, the latter is now formed, and this it is which in its turn  becomes anterior to the function. The notion of _a priori_ has  therefore nothing in it which is repugnant to physical nature.    Let us now take the _a priori_ in the sense of superiority. Certain  judgments of ours are, we are told, universal and necessary, and  through this double character go beyond the evidence of experience.  This is an exact fact which deserves to be explained, but it is not  indispensable to explain it by allowing to the consciousness a source  of special cognitions. The English school of philosophy have already  attacked this problem in connection with the origin of axioms. The  principle of their explanation lies in the virtue of what they have  termed \"inseparable association.\" They have supposed that when an  association is often repeated it creates a habit of thought against  which no further strife is possible. The mechanism of association  itself should then add a special virtue to the contingency of facts. A  hundred repetitions of related facts, for example, would give rise to  so firm an association, that no further repetition would increase it.    I consider this explanation a very sound one in principle. It is right  to put into association something more than into experience. I would  only suggest a slight correction in detail. It is not the association  forged by repetition which has this virtue of conveying the idea of  necessity and universality, it is simply the uncontradicted  association. It has been objected, in fact, and with reason, to the  solution of Mill, that it insists on a long duration of experience,  while axioms appear to be of an irresistible and universal  truthfulness the moment they are conceived. And this is quite just. I  should prefer to lay down as a law that every representation appears  true, and that every link appears necessary and universal as soon as  it is formed. This is its character from the first. It preserves it so  long as no contradiction in fact, in reasoning, or in idea, comes to  destroy it.[29]    What seems to stand out most clearly after all these explanations is  the role which we ought to attribute to the consciousness. Two rival  theories have been maintained: that of the mirror-consciousness and  that of the focus-consciousness. It would seem--I merely say it would  seem--that the first of these best harmonises with the preceding  facts. For what seems most probable is, that the consciousness  illuminates and reveals but does not act. The theory of the  focus-consciousness adapts itself less to the mechanism of the  association of ideas.    From this we come quite naturally to see in the intelligence only an  inactive consciousness; at one moment it apprehends an object, and it  is a perception or an idea; at another time it perceives a connection,  and it is a judgment; at yet another, it perceives connections between  connections, and it is an act of reason. But however subtle the object  it contemplates may become, it does not depart from its contemplative  attitude, and cognition is but a consciousness.    One step further, and we should get so far as to admit that the  consciousness serves no purpose whatever, and that it is a useless  luxury, since, if all efficacious virtue is to be found in the  sensations and the ideas which we consider as material facts, the  consciousness which reveals them adds nothing to, takes nothing from  and modifies nothing in them; and everything would go on the same, nor  would anything in this world be changed, if one day the light of  consciousness were, by chance, to be put out. We might imagine a  collection of automatons forming a human society as complicated as,  and not different in appearance from, that of conscious beings; these  automatons would make the same gestures, utter the same words as  ourselves, would dispute, complain, cry, and make love like us; we  might even imagine them capable, like us, of psychology. This is the  thesis of the epiphenomenal consciousness which Huxley has boldly  carried to its uttermost conclusions.    I indicate here these possible conclusions, without discussing them.  It is a question I prefer to leave in suspense; it seems to me that  one can do nothing on this subject but form hypotheses.    FOOTNOTES:    [Footnote 25: At the risk of being deemed too subtle, I ask whether we  are conscious of a relation between objects, or whether that which  occurs is not rather the perception of an object which has been  modified in its nature by its relation with another object.]    [Footnote 26: This conclusion may seem contradictory to that which I  enunciated when studying the constitution of matter. I then asserted  that we only know our sensations and not the excitants which produce  them. But these sensations are matter; they are matter modified by  other matter, viz. our nervous centres.    We therefore take up very distinctly an opposite standpoint to the  principle of _relativity_: in other terms, we reject the phenomenism  of Berkeley.    When we go into metaphysics we are continually astounded to see how  different conceptions of things which have a classic value are  independent of each other. In general, phenomenism is opposed to  substantialism, and it is supposed that those who do not accept the  former doctrine must accept the latter, while, on the contrary, those  who reject substantialism must be phenomenists. We know that it is in  this manner that Berkeley conquered corporeal substantialism and  taught phenomenism; while Hume, more radical than he, went so far as  to question the substantialism of mind. On reflection, it seems to me  that, after having rejected phenomenism, we are in no way constrained  to accept substance. By saying that we perceive things as they are,  and not through a deluding veil, we do not force ourselves to  acknowledge that we perceive the substance of bodies--that is to say,  that something which should be hidden beneath its qualities and should  be distinct from it. The distinction between the body and its  qualities is a thing useful in practice, but it answers to no  perception or observation. The body is only a group, a sheaf of  qualities. If the qualities seem unable to exist of themselves and to  require a subject, this is only a grammatical difficulty, which is due  to the fact that, while calling certain sensations qualities, we  suppose a subject to be necessary. On the other hand, the  representation which we make to ourselves of a material substance and  its role as the support of the qualities, is a very naive and  mechanical representation, thanks to which certain sensations become  the supports of other and less important sensations. It would suffice  to insist on the detail of this representation and on its origin to  show its artificial character. The notion we have of the stability of  bodies and of the persistence of their identity, notwithstanding  certain superficial changes, is the reason for which I thought proper  to attribute a substance to them, that is to say, an invariable  element. But we can attain the same end without this useless  hypothesis; we have only to remark that the identity of the object  lies in the aggregate of its properties, including the name it bears.  If the majority of its properties, especially of those most important  to us, subsists without alteration, or if this alteration, though of  very great extent, takes place insensibly and by slow degrees, we  decide that the object remains the same. We have no need for that  purpose to give it a substance one and indestructible. Thus we are  neither adherents of phenomenism, nor of substantialism.]    [Footnote 27: I borrow from RABIER this argument, which has thoroughly  convinced me (see _Psychologie_, p. 281).]    [Footnote 28: PILON is the psychologist who has the most forcibly  demonstrated that resemblance acts before being perceived. I refer the  readers to my _Psychologie du Raisonnement_, where I have set forth  this little problem in detail.]    [Footnote 29: We think spontaneously of the general and the necessary.  It is this which serves as a basis for the suggestion and the  catchword (_reclame_), and it explains how minds of slender culture  always tend towards absolute assertions and hasty generalisations.]          CHAPTER VII    DEFINITION OF THE CONSCIOUSNESS--THE SEPARABILITY OF THE CONSCIOUSNESS  FROM ITS OBJECT--DISCUSSION OF IDEALISM      One last"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/21081"],[0,"Scientific  American, Volume XLIII., No. 25, December 18, 1880 (#16)"],[1,"into the ice but slowly, having to  work its way through the thin layer of rarefied vapor between the two.  As soon as pressure is admitted by admitting atmospheric air, vapors can  no longer form; an intimate contact will take place between the glass  and the ice, and consequently the heat be conveyed over quick enough to  make the ice melt away rapidly.    The professor's experiments, therefore, so far as published, do not  prove anything to justify his strange conclusion. It is perfectly true  that in a vacuum of less than 4.6 mm. mercury pressure, no amount of  heat will melt ice, all heat that can be conveyed to the ice being  absorbed by vaporization. But before crediting the professor's further  conclusion, that ice can be heated much above the freezing point, he  must actually produce \"hot ice,\" not only a hot vessel containing ice.  N. J.

The school of invention has not yet been established, but its germ is  growing in the mechanical schools. This school, according to Hon. W. H.  Ruffner, in _Va. Ed. Journal_, will educate men, and women too, for the  special career of inventing new things. Why not? We already have  something closely analogous in schools of design, where the pupil is  trained to invent new forms or patterns, chiefly of an artistic or  decorative character. The same idea will be applied to the invention of  machinery, or improvements in machinery, or the adaptation of machinery  to the accomplishment of special ends. Inventions usually spring from  individuals striving to lighten their own labor, or from some idea  entering the brain of a genius. But we shall have professional inventors  who will be called on to contrive original devices, and his success will  depend on the sound and practical character of his prescriptions.           *       *       *       *       *          PROPOSED EXHIBITION OF BATHING APPLIANCES.
