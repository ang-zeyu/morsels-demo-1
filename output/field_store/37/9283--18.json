He was not content with a  mere sitting from him now and then; he visited him at the house; he  watched his face in company, and attended every occasion when he spoke  in public, that he might model him, he said, in his best mood.  Consequently the bust was the most perfect likeness that had ever been  made of brother, and as his face was then delicate and his features so  classic in their cut, it was, I thought, the most beautiful piece of  sculpture that I had ever seen.  It was quite a revelation to dear  brother, who in his modesty had never had an idea of his own beauty.\"    Ten plaster busts were struck off for the family and a few intimate  friends, but as none of them were ever put into marble, they have all,  I believe, with the exception of this one, been destroyed.  Mamma's  copy was overthrown by Marguerite's little hands when a child; another  belonging to one of our cousins was broken by her little son; and  although Cassius Clay's copy was buried, Mr. Hart told me, during the  war to save it from the hands of the soldiers, he had no reason to  suppose that it finally had escaped the fate of the others.  Aunt Mary,  however, in her anxiety to preserve her copy, at once enveloped it in  linen, and packed it in a box.  Consequently it is now as perfect as  the day it left the studio; but mamma had never seen it from that time  until this spring, when Ida exhumed it from the store-room.    Mr. Hart and uncle were always warm friends, although Mr. Hart left for  Europe soon after completing this bust, where he has since remained,  with the exception of a flying visit to America about twelve years ago.  Uncle speaks of visiting his studio in 1851, in these words (\"Glances  at Europe,\" page 217):    \"I saw something of three younger sculptors now studying and working at  Florence--Hart of Kentucky, Galt of Virginia, and Rogers of New York.  I believe all are preparing to do credit to their country.  Hart has  been hindered by a loss of the models at sea from proceeding with the  statue of Henry Clay, which he is commissioned by the ladies of  Virginia to fashion and construct; but he is wisely devoting much of  his time to careful study, and to the modelling of the ideal, before  proceeding to commit himself irrevocably by the great work which must  fix his position among sculptors, and make or mar his destiny.  I have  great confidence that what he has already carefully and excellently  done is but a foretaste of what he is yet to achieve.\"          CHAPTER XI.

Yesterday was the pleasantest Fourth I ever experienced in America.  Last year at this time I was upon the Catskill Mountains, and was  aroused at an unearthly hour by the discharge of a cannon, whose  reverberation was something appalling, and made me doubt if I was not  shot.  The hotel was graced with the presence of some thirty or forty  children, whose fond parents had invested largely in fire-crackers and  toy cannon for them, and no place upon the grounds, it seemed, was so  favorable for the ebullition of youthful patriotism as the spot  directly under my window.  Consequently, as I was already weak from the  effect of a prolonged attack of nervous fever, I was before nightfall  in a state akin to distraction, and filled with anything but patriotic  sentiments.  I could not then but think with regret of a previous  Fourth spent upon the steamship _St. Laurent_, where fire-crackers were  tabooed, and the celebration consisted entirely of a magnificent  dinner, and speeches--during the latter I made my escape to the deck.    This year was pleasanter still.  I do not know if the Chappaqua people  are less patriotic than other citizens of the Union, but our nerves  were only disturbed by the occasional popping of a fire-cracker in the  garden of our neighbor, the train-master over the way; and when we  strayed off to the Glen after dinner, we were as free from disturbing  noise as though our country had not been born ninety-seven years ago.  But although noisy demonstrations do not seem the fashion here (perhaps  owing to the predominance of Quakers in the neighborhood), the dormant  enthusiasm of the people for the Fourth was aroused at sundown, when a  mass meeting was held at the tavern, or \"Chappaqua Hotel\" as it is  grandly styled, and lengthy and energetic speeches were delivered.  From our piazza we could hear the orators' voices ascending to a very  high key as they warmed with their topic, and quite congratulated  ourselves that we were not obliged to be of the audience.    After dark there was a small display of Roman candles and sky-rockets;  and so ended the glorious Fourth.      _July 6_.    I have again dreamed away an entire morning upon the piazza of the  house in the woods--to me the stillest, sweetest spot in the world.  I  have described this dear old house and its romantic surroundings again  and again since I have been here this summer.  I can scarcely turn over  half a dozen leaves of my journal without finding some allusion to it;  but it is a subject possessing such fascination for me that I must  again revert to it.  I like to pass a quiet hour upon the steps of the  piazza, or upon the large moss-grown boulder in front of the house  where Ida, Raphael, and Gabrielle have all played; and while my fingers  are busily employed with some fanciful design wrought with gold thread  or emerald-green silk,      \"My thoughts wander on at their own sweet will,\";    oftenest returning, however, to Aunt Mary's life here in the woods with  her little children.  A lonely, comfortless life many women would have  deemed it, so entirely shut in as she was from the outer world; and to  any one less self-reliant and self-sustained than Aunt Mary it would  have been so.  For that there were discomforts in her country life I do  not doubt, although they were much lessened by uncle's easy  circumstances; and the house itself was finished off with all the city  improvements and conveniences practicable to introduce into a building  of its size and situation.  Still, the house was distant from good  markets, and the trees encircled it so closely that the sun's rays did  not penetrate the rooms until ten o'clock; but Aunt Mary loved her  trees as though they were human, and at that time would not allow one  to be cut down, notwithstanding the dampness that they created.  An  idle woman would have regretted the distance at which the house stood  from the public road, as no distraction ensued from looking out of the  windows; and a timid or nervous one would have dreaded the long nights  in that solitary house when uncle was in the city or absent upon  lecturing tours, and no neighbor was within calling distance in case of  danger.    Occasionally, too, Aunt Mary would be left without servants, for all  American ladies know how difficult it is to retain them in the country,  especially in so small and lonely a place as Chappaqua was then, and  although she frequently had some friend making her long visits of  months, still there were days when she would be alone with only the sad  memory of her buried darlings, her splendid Pickie, the pride and hope  of both parents, and sweet little Mary Inez, and her two living  children, too young to be very companionable.    Raphael, mamma says, was a beautiful boy, although not perhaps so  noticeable as Pickie, for he had not his brilliant color, and his hair,  too, was not so dazzling in shade, but very much like his father's.  His features, however, were quite as finely cut as those of his much  admired brother, and his temperament was gentle and loving.  Ida  cherishes very tender memories of him, for he was the only brother whom  she knew, and her constant playfellow before Gabrielle's birth.  There  were seven years difference in the ages of the brothers.  Pickie died  at five, of cholera; and Raffie at seven years old, of croup.    But although Aunt Mary had such sad memories in the past, she had two  beautiful children left to her, and for them she lived this life of  seclusion at Chappaqua, remaining here six months of every year that  they might acquire a fine physical development from walking, driving,  and riding in the pure country air.  Ida has often told me of the wild  games of play she used to have when a child with Osceola, a little  Indian boy, and dwelt especially upon her prowess in racing down hill  in emulation of him.  The parents of this boy then occupied the  roadside house, which did not at that time belong to uncle.    Gabrielle's stories are different.  She loved to ride the unbroken  colts, and tend her menagerie in the play-house.  She has, too, much to  tell about the way her mother used to train her to be as fearless in  case of fire or thieves as she was when seated upon a bare-backed  horse, and often she has made me smile, though fully recognizing the  wisdom of Aunt Mary's lessons, when telling me how she was obliged to  rehearse imaginary escapes from fire or midnight attacks.    Besides a devoted love for her children, a passion for the beautiful in  Nature, and fondness for solitude and books, or the companionship of  some one person of congenial tastes and highly cultured mind, Aunt Mary  possessed a fund of moral strength and heroism that one might indeed  read in the flash of her black eyes, but which a casual observer would  think incompatible with her frail figure.  It was, however, many times  severely tested during uncle's"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/18298"],[0,"Essays in Natural History and Agriculture (#16)"],[1,"nitrate of soda grew vigorously, and  the ears, more particularly in the part manured with guano, were  the finest I had ever seen, but when it came to ripen it  shrivelled in the ear, and the sample was very indifferent; the  soil being evidently deficient in some property necessary for  perfecting the grain. The crop also suffered much from the  depredations of the birds.    The portion manured with night-soil produced       to the statute acre 32 bushels of 60 lbs. each.

After the crop of 1842 was reaped, the land was  immediately ploughed up, and the season being very favourable, it  was tolerably well cleaned, and the seed was sown (without any  manure) about the first week in October. After the wheat came up,  it was manured with a dusting of one hundredweight of guano, over  the entire field (about one acre, three roods), to keep the plants  alive through the winter. In the spring, being divided into three  portions, it was manured with the same number of experimental  manures, which were furnished to me by Mr. Blyth, of Church, near  Accrington, who also analyzed the soil and subsoil for me. These  manures were applied about the 10th of April, and the experiment  was still further varied by covering a portion of each division  with guano a fortnight afterwards, at the rate of two hundredweight  to the acre, but all the manure applied to the crop, including the  hundredweight of guano put on in the autumn, did not exceed 6 1/2  hundredweight. The crop, which was a very thin one in the spring,  improved so much by the application of these manures, that when it  came into ear, it was allowed by all who saw it to be the best in  the neighbourhood; but the heavy rains of July caused it to lodge  in the best part of the field, and there it was attacked by rust,  and the sample was very indifferent. In addition to this drawback,  there being very little wheat grown in the neighbourhood of the  town, and this being much earlier than any of the other fields,  was attacked by the birds as soon as the grain was formed in the  ear. Notwithstanding all the efforts made to prevent them, they  continued feeding upon it until it was cut; and it is a very  moderate estimate of the damage, to say that they destroyed one-  fourth of the crop throughout the field. That part of the field  covered with manure (No. 1) being the earliest, suffered most.  There were patches of several square yards where there did not  appear to be a single grain left; and wherever the birds took a  grain from the middle of the ear, when in the milky state, the  grains on each side of it appeared to grow no more, but shrivelled  up in the ear.    I have little doubt that in this portion of the field one-third of  the crop was destroyed. All this seems to reduce the experiment to  little more than guess-work; and it will, probably, be very  difficult to persuade those who did not see the field when it was  cut, to credit this report of the devastation made by the birds;  even when they are told that Clitheroe is a town of 7,000  inhabitants, and probably as many sparrows, and that apparently  they were all assembled to feed in this field; and they became so  accustomed to the good living they found there, that even when our  neighbours' wheat was fit to eat, they continued to favour this  field with their visits in preference to going elsewhere. I  estimate the damage on No. 1 at one-third, No. 2 at one-fourth,  No. 3 at one-fifth; this was later than the others, and suffered  more from rust than birds.    The following are the results:--From 3,060 yards manured with No.  1, there were obtained 1,042 lbs. of wheat, or 27 1/2 bushels of  60 lbs. each to the statute acre; if we add one-half to this, as  we assume that one-third was destroyed by the birds, it will give  41 1/4 bushels to the statute acre. The weight of straw from this  portion was 188 stones 5 lbs., 14 lbs. to the stone. From 2,856  yards manured with No. 2, 962 lbs. of wheat were obtained, and 155  stones 9 lbs. of straw; this is equal to 27 1/4 bushels per acre,  or with one-third added, for estimated damage, it is equal to 36  bushels per statute acre. From 2610 yards manured with No. 3,  there were 1,067 lbs. of wheat, and 211 stones 7 lbs. of straw, or  33 bushels to the statute acre, to which if we add one-fourth,  according to the estimate of damage, it will be equal to 41 1/4  bushels per acre. It will be observed that this portion yielded a  far greater weight of straw per acre than either of the others,  and from the sort of manure applied, it was expected that this  would be the case.    No. 1 yielded straw at the rate of 297 3/4 stones per acre.   \"  2    \"      \"     \"       \"    246 3/4      \"     \"   \"  3    \"      \"     \"       \"    392 1/3      \"     \"    Many people may feel inclined to say, that all these apparent data  are mere guesses, and that a crop may be made into anything one  likes, if they assume so much for damages; but, fortunately, it is  not all guess-work. I have stated previously that I covered a part  of each division with guano a fortnight after the application of  the manures in April, intending to see what advantage was obtained  by the use of it; but, owing to the depredations of the birds, the  portions of the first and second divisions manured with guano were  not kept separate from those which were left without guano; but  the third being later, and, therefore, not so much injured by  them, gave me an opportunity of ascertaining the effect. I  measured off a land which had been so manured, and reaped and  thrashed it out separately. From this land of 100 yards long and  10 feet wide (3,000 square feet), there was obtained 220 lbs. of  wheat, or 53 bushels of 60 lbs. per statute acre; and this was far  from being the best portion of the field. I don't mean that it was  not the best portion of the crop, but I mean that the soil was not  so good there as it was in other parts of the field; as I have  before stated, in the best part of the field the crop was spoiled  by being lodged by the rain, and subsequently attacked by rust.    I communicate this to you, in the hope that the publication of it  in your paper maybe the means of stimulating others to try the  same experiments. It is not too late yet to try for the next  year's crop, and I have no doubt that Mr. Blyth will be happy to  supply both material and information to any who may require them  from him. It is the duty of everyone to promote the advancement of  agriculture; and this is my contribution towards it. I have not  yet done, for I have sown the same field with wheat again, and  hope, with a favourable season, to reap a still more abundant crop  next year.    * * * * *    _To the same._    CLITHEROE, _October 12th_, 1844.    SIR,--Last October you published an account of an attempt of mine  to grow wheat on the same land year after year; and, as I have  repeated the experiment this year, I shall be obliged if you will  be kind enough to insert the account of it in the \"Guardian,\" as  the subject appears to me to be an important one; and, as many  persons who may read this letter may either not have seen the  former, or may have forgotten it, I trust that a short summary of  the former experiments may not be out of place.    These experiments took place in the autumn of 1841, after the  field had been cleared of a crop of oats, which was a very bad  one; the land being not only naturally poor, but foul and  exhausted by long cropping. As the season was very wet, it was  indifferently cleaned, and one-fourth of it manured with a compost  of night-soil and ashes, and then the field was sowed with wheat.  Two of the remaining three-fourths were manured on the 6th of May,  1842 (the spring being a very dry one, no rain came until that  day), one with guano, the other with nitrate of soda, each at the  rate of two hundredweight to the statute acre, and the remaining  fourth was left unmanured.    The following were the results at harvest:--That manured with  night-soil and ashes produced 32 bushels of 60 lbs. per acre;  guano, 27 bushels; nitrate of soda, 27 bushels; unmanured, 19 2/3  bushels. When the field had been cleared of the crop, it was  immediately ploughed up, and, as the season was favourable, the  land was well cleaned and sowed with wheat in October, 1842,  without any manure except 1 cwt. of guano, which was scattered  over it when the wheat was coming up. The field was divided into  three portions, and in April, 1843, was manured as follows:--No.  1, with 90 lbs. of sulphate of magnesia, and 2 cwt. nitrate of  soda to the statute acre; No. 2, with a compound from a  manufacturer of chemical manures; No. 3, with 60 lbs. of silicate  of soda and 2 cwt. of nitrate of soda to the acre; and, with the  view of still further varying the experiment, a part of each  portion was sowed with guano a fortnight after the application of  the chemical manures. The crop promised to be a very good one, but  it was much plundered by the birds, and as the summer was wet, it  suffered also much from rust. Allowing for the destruction  occasioned by the birds, the crop was estimated at:    41 1/4 bushels in patch No. 1,  36       \"        \"     No. 2,  41 1/4   \"        \"     No. 3,    and in that part of No. 3 which was also covered with guano, it  reached by actual weight (not by estimate), 53 bushels of 60 lbs.  to the acre. Those patches in Nos. 1 and 2 which had guano put on  them, suffered so much from the depredations of the birds, that no  account was taken of them separately. The crop was cleared off the  land, which was cleaned, and again sowed with wheat on 3rd  October, 1843. It was drilled"]]]
