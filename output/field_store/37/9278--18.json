It was only in the coming generations that it became  evident that the abuse of faith, the substitution of incantation for  devotion, was destructive of true religion. It is the effect of this  substitution on the various classes of society under the new and trying  social conditions of the last two centuries of the republic that forms  the theme of our next chapter.          THE DECLINE OF FAITH      It is the fashion of our day to think no evil of Greece. In art we are  experiencing another Renaissance, not like that of the fourteenth and  fifteenth centuries in a revival of ancient Rome, but in a movement  leading behind Rome to the classic and even the pre-classic models of  Greece. In itself it is a healthful tendency, a needed corrective to the  sensational search for novelty which characterised the closing years of  the nineteenth century. But in our admiration for the Greek spirit we  ought not to forget that after Alexander that spirit lost much of its  beauty, and aged very rapidly. We may indeed regret the fact that Rome,  like certain persons of our acquaintance, seemed at times to possess a  strong faculty for assimilating the worst of her surroundings, while  occasionally curiously unresponsive to the better things; and yet we  ought in justice to strive to realise the fact that not only is the  Greek spirit at its best an unteachable thing, but that at the  historical moment when Rome came under that influence the Greek world  was very old and weary. It was Rome's misfortune and not her fault that  when she was old enough to go to school, Alexandrianism with its  pedantic detail was the order of the day in mythology, and the timorous  post-Socratic schools were the teachers of philosophy. Naturally if Rome  had been another Greece she would have worked back from these later  forms to the truer, purer spirit, but Rome was not Greece, and no  thoughtful man ever pretended that she was. In the third century before  Christ Greece began actively to influence Rome; before that time  Hellenic influence had been confined largely to the effects on religion  produced by the Sibylline books, and to the effects on society caused by  the presence of Greek traders. But now Greek thought as embodied in the  literature began to affect Roman thought, and to bring into being a  literature based on Greek models. Three centuries of Sibylline oracles  had produced for Rome the pathological religious condition of the Second  Punic War, when she did not think twice before breaking down the  religious barrier which had hitherto separated the national from the  adopted elements in her religion, and at the same time unhesitatingly  reached out to Asia Minor for an Oriental cult, masquerading in Greek  colours, and placed on the Palatine the Great Mother of Pessinus. From  this time on two influences were steadily at work which shaped the  history of Roman religion in the two remaining centuries till the close  of the republic: one, mythology, directly affecting the forms of the  cult and the beliefs concerning the individual gods; the other,  philosophy, attacking the whole foundation of religious belief in  general.    Greece gave her gods to Rome when she herself was weary of them, she  gave her the tired gods, exhausted by centuries of handling, long ago  dragged down from Olympus, and weary with serving as lay-figures for  poets and artists, and being for ever rigged out in new mythological  garments, or jaded with the laboratory experiments of philosophers who  tried to interpret them in every conceivable fashion or else to do away  with them entirely. It is no wonder that it did not take the Romans more  than a century to come to the end of these gods, to find that the only  one among them who could satisfy their religious desires was the least  Greek of them all, the Magna Mater, and having found this to go forth to  take to themselves more like unto her, in a word, to crave the  sensational cults of the Orient. And the philosophy which Greece gave  Rome was no better than the mythology. It is not strange that human  thought experienced a reaction after a century which contained both  Plato and Aristotle, but it is a pity that Rome should have learned her  philosophy from a period of doubt and scepticism, an age in which the  lesser masters, who had known the greater ones, had gone, leaving  nothing but pupils' pupils.    The history of religion in Rome during the last two centuries of the  republic is the story of the action and reaction of these two  tendencies--the one toward the novel and sensational in worship, which  we may call superstition, the other the philosophy of doubt, which we  may call scepticism--in the presence of the established religion of the  state. This much the two centuries have in common, but here their  resemblance ends. In the first of these centuries (B.C. 200-100) the  state religion was able to hold her own, at least in outward appearance,  and to wage war against both tendencies. In the other century (B.C. 100  to Augustus) politics gained control of the state religion and so robbed  her of her strength that she was crushed between the opposing forces of  superstition and scepticism. It is to the story of the earlier of these  two centuries, the second before Christ, that we now turn.    With the close of the Second Punic War there began for Rome a period of  very great material prosperity. This prosperity was, to be sure, not  exactly distributed, and it is not without its resemblance to some of  our modern instances of commercial prosperity, in that it was not so  much a general bettering of economic conditions as the very rapid  increase of the wealth of a relatively small number, an increase gained  at the expense of positive detriment to a large element in the  population. Thus it was that a century of which the first seventy years  provide an almost unparalleled spectacle of the increase of national  territory, accompanied, according to the ancient methods of taxation, by  a vast increase in national wealth, should close with the tragedies of  Tiberius and Gaius Gracchus and the legacy of class hatred which  produced the civil wars. This growth in wealth and territory was not  without its effects on the outward appearance of the state religion. The  territory was gained by a series of minor wars in the course of which  many temples were vowed; and the spoils of the war provided the means  for the fulfilment of the vows. Thus to the outward observer it might  well have seemed that the religion of the state was enjoying a time of  great prosperity. Between the close of the Punic War (B.C. 201) and the  year of Tiberius Gracchus (B.C. 133) we have accurate knowledge of the  dedication of no less than nineteen state temples, and there were  undoubtedly many others of which we have no record. Another apparently  good sign is the fact that the Sibylline books are silent, so far as the  introduction of new deities is concerned. Yet these surface indications  are deceptive. As for the Sibylline books, now that the _pomerium_ line  had been broken down, and the temples of Greek gods might be placed  anywhere in the city, it was a very simple matter for the state to bring  in any Greek god that it pleased, and likening him to a more or less  similar Roman god and calling him by the Roman name, to put up a temple  to him anywhere. It was also true that, as Roman theology was now based  on the principle that every Roman god had his Greek parallel and _vice  versa_, there were no gods left, whose names would have occurred at all  in the Sibylline books, who could not be brought in now without them.  And as for the vowing of new temples, this represented at best merely  the habit formed during more devout days; religion was moving by the  momentum acquired during the Second Punic War, and the gods to whom  these temples were erected were really Greek gods under Roman names. In  a word, not only was the state religion becoming more and more of a form  day by day, but the form was that of Greece and not of Rome. It is  extremely interesting to trace this movement in detail, to look behind  the outward appearance and see the remarkable changes that were really  taking place.    If we look at the temples which were built in the years following the  Second Punic War, we shall have no difficulty in finding examples of the  introduction of Greek gods under Roman names. During the war itself in  the year B.C. 207 a Roman general had vowed a temple to Juventas on the  occasion of a battle near Siena. Juventas was an old Roman goddess, one  of those abstract deities which had been produced by the breaking off  and becoming independent of a cult-title. She was intimately associated  with Juppiter, and had a special shrine in the Capitoline temple.  Juventas was the divine representative of the putting away of childish  things and the assumption of the responsibilities and privileges of  young manhood. This act was symbolised by the Romans in the beautiful  ceremony of putting on the toga of manhood (_toga virilis_), when the  lad was led by his father to the Capitoline temple to make sacrifices to  Juppiter, and at the same time a contribution was made to the treasury  of Juventas. But this was not the goddess in whose honour the temple  vowed at Siena was built at the Circus Maximus and dedicated B.C. 191.  This Juventas was nothing more or less than the Greek Hebe, the female  counterpart of Ganymedes, as cupbearer to the gods. Similarly in B.C.  179 a temple was dedicated to Diana at the Circus Flaminius, but this  was not the old goddess of Aricia, whose cult Rome had adopted for the  sake of increasing her influence in the Latin league. It was the Greek  Artemis, who at her first coming into Rome had been associated with  Apollo in the temple built in B.C. 431, and was now given a"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/18233"],[0,"Animal Ghosts; Or, Animal Hauntings and the Hereafter (#16)"],[1,"-they grew glazed and  glassy like the eyes of a dead person. A cold shudder ran through the  Dean, his hair stood on end, his blood turned to ice. Again he essayed  to move, to summon help; again he failed. The strain on his nerves  proved more than he could bear. A sudden sensation of nausea surged  through him; his eyes swam; his brain reeled; there was a loud buzzing  in his ears; he knew no more. Some moments later one of the College  servants arrived at the door with a bundle of letters, and on receiving  no reply to his raps, entered.    \"'Good heavens! What's the matter?' he cried, gazing at the figure of  the Dean, lolling head downward on the table. 'Merciful Prudence, the  gentleman is dead! No, he ain't--some of the young gents will be sorry  enough for that--he's fainted.'    \"The good fellow poured out some water in a tumbler, and was proceeding  to sprinkle the Dean's face with it, when, a noise attracting his  attention, he peered round at the picture. It was bulging from the wall;  it was falling! And, Good God, what was that that was falling with  it--that huge black object? A coffin? No, not a coffin, but a corpse!  The servant ran to the door shrieking, and, in less than a minute,  passage and room were filled to overflowing with a scared crowd of  enquiring officials and undergraduates.    \"'What has happened? What's the matter with the Dean? Has he had a fit,  or what? And the picture? And--Anderson? Anderson lying on the floor!  Hurt? No, not hurt, dead! Murdered!'    \"In an instant there was silence, and the white-faced throng closed in  on one another as if for protection. In front of them, beside the fallen  picture, lay the body of the most gay and popular student in the  College--Bob Anderson--Bob Anderson with a stream of blood running from  a deep incision in his back made with some sharp instrument, that had  been driven home with tremendous force. He had, without doubt, been  murdered. But by whom? Then one of the undergraduates, a bright, boyish,  fair-haired giant, named O'Farroll, immensely popular both on account of  his prowess in sport and an untold number of the most audacious  escapades, spoke out:    \"'I saw Anderson, about an hour ago, crossing the quadrangle. I asked  him where he was going, and he replied, \"To old Kelly. I intend paying  him out for 'gating' me last week.\" I enquired how, and he replied:  \"I've a glorious plan. You know that portrait stuck over his  mantel-shelf? Well! In poking about the room the other day, when the old  man was out, I had a great find. Directly behind the picture is the door  of a secret room, so neatly covered by the designs on the wall that it  is not discernible. It was only by the merest fluke I discovered it. I  was taking down the picture with the idea of \"touching up\" the face,  when my knuckles bumped against the panels of the wall, touched a  spring, and the door flew open, revealing an apartment about six by  eight feet large. I at once explored it, and found it could be entered  by the chimney. An idea then struck me--I would play a trick upon the  Dean by hiding in this secret chamber one evening while he was feeding,  cutting out the eyes of the portrait, and peering through the cavities  at him. And this,' O'Farroll continued, pointing at the fallen picture,  'is what he evidently did after I left him. You can see the eyes of the  portrait have been removed.'    \"'That is so, shure,' one of the other undergraduates, Mick Maguire--six  feet two in his socks, every inch--exclaimed. 'And, what is more, I knew  all about it. Anderson told me yesterday what he was going to do, and I  wanted to join him, but he said I would never get up the chimney, I  would stick there. And, bedad, I think he was right.'    \"At this remark, despite the grimness of the moment, several of those  present laughed.    \"'Come, come, gentlemen!' one of the officials cried, 'this is no time  for levity. Mr. Anderson has been murdered, and the question is--by  whom?'    \"'Then, if that's the only thing that is troubling you,' O'Farroll put  in, 'I fancy the solution is right here at hand,' and he looked  significantly at the Dean.    \"An ominous silence followed, during which all eyes were fixed on John  Kelly, some anxiously, some merely enquiringly, but not a few angrily,  for Kelly, as I have said before, had made himself particularly  obnoxious just then by his behaviour to the rowdier students; and, as  has ever been the case at K., these formed no small portion of the  community.    \"The Dean hardly seemed to realize the situation. The dignity of office  blinded him to danger.    \"'What do you mean?' he spluttered. 'I know nothing of what happened to  Mr. Anderson! Really, really, O'Farroll, your presumption is  preposterous.'    \"'There was no one else in here but you and he, Mr. Kelly,' O'Farroll  retorted coolly. 'It's only natural we should think you know something  of what happened!'    \"On the arrival of the police who had been sent for somewhat  reluctantly--for the prestige of the College at that date was very dear  to all--the premises were thoroughly searched, and, no other culprit  being found, first of all Dean Kelly was apprehended, and then, to make  a good job of it, his accuser, Denis O'Farroll.    \"All the College was agog with excitement. No one could believe the Dean  was a murderer; and it was just as inconceivable to think O'Farroll had  committed the deed. And yet if neither of them had killed Anderson, who  in God's name had killed him?    \"The night succeeding the affair, whilst the Dean and O'Farroll were  still in jail awaiting the inquest, a party of undergraduates were  discussing the situation in Maguire's rooms, when the door burst open,  and into their midst, almost breathless with excitement, came a measly,  bespectacled youth named Brady--Patrick Brady.    \"'I'm awfully sorry to disturb you fellows,' he stammered, 'but there  have been odd noises just outside my room all the evening, and I've just  seen a queer kind of dog, that vanished, God knows how. I--I--well, you  will call me an ass, of course, but I'm afraid to stay there alone, and  that's the long and short of it.'    \"'Begorra!' Maguire exclaimed, 'it can't be poor Bob's ghost already!  What sort of noises were they?'    \"'Noises like laughter!' Brady said. 'Loud peals of horrid laughter.'    \"'Someone trying to frighten you,' one of the undergrads observed, 'and  faith, he succeeded. You are twice as white as any sheet.'    \"'It's ill-timed mirth, anyhow,' someone else put in, 'with Anderson's  dead body upstairs. I'm for making an example of the blackguard.'    \"'And I,'--'And I,' the others echoed.    \"A general movement followed, and headed by Brady the procession moved  to the north wing of the College. At that time, be it remembered, a  large proportion of K. undergrads were in residence--now it is  otherwise. On reaching Brady's rooms the crowd halted outside and  listened. For some time there was silence; and then a laugh--low,  monotonous, unmirthful, metallic--coming as it were from some adjacent  chamber, and so unnatural, so abhorring, that it held everyone  spell-bound. It died away in the reverberations of the stone corridor,  its echoes seeming to awake a chorus of other laughs hardly less  dreadful. Again there was silence, no one daring to express his  thoughts. Then, as if by common consent, all turned precipitately into  Brady's room and slammed the door.    \"'That is what I heard,' Brady said. 'What does it mean?'    \"'Is it the meaning of it you're wanting to know?' Maguire observed.  'Sure 'tis the devil, for no one but him could make such a noise. I've  never heard the like of it before. Who has the rooms on either side of  you?'    \"'These?' Brady replied, pointing to the right. 'No one. They were  vacated at Easter, and are being repainted and decorated. These on the  left--Dobson, who is, I happen to know, at the present moment in Co.  Mayo. He won't be back till next week.'    \"'Then we can search them,' a student called Hartnoll intervened.    \"'To be sure we can,' Brady replied, 'but I doubt if you'll find  anyone.'    \"A search was made, and Brady proved to be correct. Not a vestige of  anyone was discovered.    \"Much mystified, Maguire's party was preparing to depart, when Hartnoll,  who had taken the keenest interest in the proceedings, suddenly said,  'Who has the rooms over yours, Brady? Sound, as you know, plays curious  tricks, and it is just as likely as not that laugh came from above.'    \"'Oh, I don't think so,' Brady answered. 'The man overhead is Belton, a  very decent sort. He is going in for his finals shortly, and is sweating  fearfully hard at present. We might certainly ask him if he heard the  noise.'    \"The students agreeing, Brady led the way upstairs, and in response to  their summons Belton hastily opened the door. He was a typical  book-worm--thin, pale and rather emaciated, but with a pleasant  expression in his eyes and mouth, that all felt was assuring.    \"'Hulloa!' he exclaimed, 'it isn't often I'm favoured with a surprise  party of this sort. Come in'; and he pressed them so hard that they felt  constrained to accept his hospitality, and before long were all seated  round the fire, quaffing whisky and puffing cigars as if they meant to  make a night of it. At two o'clock someone suggested that it was high  time they thought of bed, and Belton rose with them.    \"'Before we turn in, let's have another search,' he said. 'It's strange  you should all hear that noise except me--unless, of course, it came  from below.'    \"'But there's nothing under me,' Brady remarked, 'except the Dining  Hall.'    \"'Then let's search that,' Belton went on. 'We ought to make a thorough  job of it now we've once begun. Besides, I don't relish being in this  lonely place with that laugh \"knocking\" around, any more than you do.'    \"He went with them, and they completely overhauled the ground  floor--hall, dining-"]]]
