For Christmas? Surely not?\"    \"And why not?\" cried the dealer. \"Why not a glass?\"    Markheim was looking upon him with an indefinable expression. \"You ask  me why not?\" he said. \"Why, look here--look in it--look at yourself! Do  you like to see it? No! nor I--nor any man.\"    The little man had jumped back when Markheim had so suddenly confronted  him with the mirror; but now, perceiving there was nothing worse  on hand, he chuckled. \"Your future lady, sir, must be pretty hard  favoured,\" said he.    \"I ask you,\" said Markheim, \"for a Christmas present, and you give  me this--this damned reminder of years, and sins and follies--this  hand-conscience! Did you mean it? Had you a thought in your mind? Tell  me. It will be better for you if you do. Come, tell me about yourself. I  hazard a guess now, that you are in secret a very charitable man.\"    The dealer looked closely at his companion. It was very odd, Markheim  did not appear to be laughing; there was something in his face like an  eager sparkle of hope, but nothing of mirth.    \"What are you driving at?\" the dealer asked.    \"Not charitable?\" returned the other, gloomily. \"Not charitable; not  pious; not scrupulous; unloving, unbeloved; a hand to get money, a safe  to keep it. Is that all? Dear God, man, is that all?\"    \"I will tell you what it is,\" began the dealer, with some sharpness, and  then broke off again into a chuckle. \"But I see this is a love match of  yours, and you have been drinking the lady's health.\"    \"Ah!\" cried Markheim, with a strange curiosity. \"Ah, have you been in  love? Tell me about that.\"    \"I,\" cried the dealer. \"I in love! I never had the time, nor have I the  time to-day for all this nonsense. Will you take the glass?\"    \"Where is the hurry?\" returned Markheim. \"It is very pleasant to stand  here talking; and life is so short and insecure that I would not hurry  away from any pleasure--no, not even from so mild a one as this. We  should rather cling, cling to what little we can get, like a man at a  cliff's edge. Every second is a cliff, if you think upon it--a cliff a  mile high--high enough, if we fall, to dash us out of every feature  of humanity. Hence it is best to talk pleasantly. Let us talk of each  other; why should we wear this mask? Let us be confidential. Who knows?  we might become friends.\"    \"I have just one word to say to you,\" said the dealer. \"Either make your  purchase, or walk out of my shop.\"    \"True, true,\" said Markheim. \"Enough fooling. To business. Show me  something else.\"    The dealer stooped once more, this time to replace the glass upon the  shelf, his thin blond hair falling over his eyes as he did so. Markheim  moved a little nearer, with one hand in the pocket of his greatcoat; he  drew himself up and filled his lungs; at the same time many different  emotions were depicted together on his face--terror, horror, and  resolve, fascination and a physical repulsion; and through a haggard  lift of his upper lip, his teeth looked out.    \"This, perhaps, may suit,\" observed the dealer. And then, as he began  to rearise, Markheim bounded from behind upon his victim. The long,  skewer-like dagger flashed and fell. The dealer struggled like a hen,  striking his temple on the shelf, and then tumbled on the floor in a  heap.    Time had some score of small voices in that shop--some stately and slow  as was becoming to their great age; others garrulous and hurried. All  these told out the seconds in an intricate chorus of tickings. Then the  passage of a lad's feet, heavily running on the pavement, broke in upon  these smaller voices and startled Markheim into the consciousness of  his surroundings. He looked about him awfully. The candle stood on  the counter, its flame solemnly wagging in a draught; and by that  inconsiderable movement the whole room was filled with noiseless bustle  and kept heaving like a sea: the tall shadows nodding, the gross blots  of darkness swelling and dwindling as with respiration, the faces of the  portraits and the china gods changing and wavering like images in water.  The inner door stood ajar, and peered into that leaguer of shadows with  a long slit of daylight like a pointing finger.    From these fear-stricken rovings, Markheim's eyes returned to the body  of his victim, where it lay, both humped and sprawling, incredibly small  and strangely meaner than in life. In these poor, miserly clothes, in  that ungainly attitude, the dealer lay like so much sawdust. Markheim  had feared to see it, and, lo! it was nothing. And yet, as he gazed,  this bundle of old clothes and pool of blood began to find eloquent  voices. There it must lie; there was none to work the cunning hinges or  direct the miracle of locomotion; there it must lie till it was found.  Found! ay, and then? Then would this dead flesh lift up a cry that would  ring over England, and fill the world with the echoes of pursuit. Ay,  dead or not, this was still the enemy. \"Time was that when the brains  were out,\" he thought; and the first word struck into his mind. Time,  now that the deed was accomplished--time, which had closed for the  victim, had become instant and momentous for the slayer.    The thought was yet in his mind, when, first one and then another, with  every variety of pace and voice--one deep as the bell from a cathedral  turret, another ringing on its treble notes the prelude of a waltz,--the  clocks began to strike the hour of three in the afternoon.    The sudden outbreak of so many tongues in that dumb chamber staggered  him. He began to bestir himself, going to and fro with the candle,  beleaguered by moving shadows, and startled to the soul by chance  reflections. In many rich mirrors, some of home design, some from Venice  or Amsterdam, he saw his face repeated and repeated, as it were an army  of spies; his own eyes met and detected him; and the sound of his own  steps, lightly as they fell, vexed the surrounding quiet. And still, as  he continued to fill his pockets, his mind accused him with a sickening  iteration, of the thousand faults of his design. He should have chosen  a more quiet hour; he should have prepared an alibi; he should not have  used a knife; he should have been more cautious, and only bound and  gagged the dealer, and not killed him; he should have been more bold,  and killed the servant also; he should have done all things otherwise.  Poignant regrets, weary, incessant toiling of the mind to change what  was unchangeable, to plan what was now useless, to be the architect of  the irrevocable past. Meanwhile, and behind all this activity, brute  terrors, like the scurrying of rats in a deserted attic, filled the more  remote chambers of his brain with riot; the hand of the constable would  fall heavy on his shoulder, and his nerves would jerk like a hooked  fish; or he beheld, in galloping defile, the dock, the prison, the  gallows, and the black coffin.    Terror of the people in the street sat down before his mind like a  besieging army. It was impossible, he thought, but that some rumour  of the struggle must have reached their ears and set on edge their  curiosity; and now, in all the neighbouring houses, he divined them  sitting motionless and with uplifted ear--solitary people, condemned  to spend Christmas dwelling alone on memories of the past, and now  startingly recalled from that tender exercise; happy family parties  struck into silence round the table, the mother still with raised  finger--every degree and age and humour, but all, by their own hearths,  prying and hearkening and weaving the rope that was to hang him.  Sometimes it seemed to him he could not move too softly; the clink of  the tall Bohemian goblets rang out loudly like a bell; and alarmed by  the bigness of the ticking, he was tempted to stop the clocks. And then,  again, with a swift transition of his terrors, the very silence of the  place appeared a source of peril, and a thing to strike and freeze the  passer-by; and he would step more boldly, and bustle aloud among the  contents of the shop, and imitate, with elaborate bravado, the movements  of a busy man at ease in his own house.    But he was now so pulled about by different alarms that, while one  portion of his mind was still alert and cunning, another trembled on the  brink of lunacy. One hallucination in particular took a strong hold  on his credulity. The neighbour hearkening with white face beside  his window, the passer-by arrested by a horrible surmise on the  pavement--these could at worst suspect, they could not know; through the  brick walls and shuttered windows only sounds could penetrate. But  here, within the house, was he alone? He knew he was; he had watched the  servant set forth sweet-hearting, in her poor best, \"out for the day\"  written in every ribbon and smile. Yes, he was alone, of course; and  yet, in the bulk of empty house above him, he could surely hear a stir  of delicate footing; he was surely conscious, inexplicably conscious  of some presence. Ay, surely; to every room and corner of the house his  imagination followed it; and now it was a faceless thing, and yet had  eyes to see with; and again it was a shadow of himself; and yet again  behold the image of the dead dealer, reinspired with cunning and hatred.    At times, with a strong effort, he would glance at the open door which  still seemed to repel his eyes. The house was tall, the skylight small  and dirty, the day blind with fog; and the light that filtered down  to the ground story was exceedingly faint, and showed dimly on the  threshold of the shop. And yet, in that strip of doubtful brightness,  did there not hang wavering a shadow?    Suddenly, from the street outside, a very jovial gentleman began to beat  with a staff on the shop door, accompanying his blows with shouts and"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/20729"],[0,"At the Point of the Bayonet: A Tale of the Mahratta War (#16)"],[1,"gold mohurs, which will enable him to begin the work of  privately raising troops.\"    \"I will undertake the business, sir. The only person I fear, in the  smallest degree, is Balloba himself. I must disguise myself so that  he will not recognize me.\"    Without delay, Harry mounted his horse, placed the two bags of  money that had been handed to him in the wallets behind his saddle,  exchanged his dress for that of one of Sufder's troopers, and then  started for Poona, which he reached the next day. He did not enter  the town; but put up at a cultivator's, two miles distant from it.    \"I want to hire a cart, with two bullocks,\" he said to the man.  \"Can you furnish one?\"    \"As I do not know you, I should require some money paid down, as a  guarantee that they will be returned.\"    \"That I can give you; but I shall leave my horse here, and that is  fully worth your waggon and oxen. However, I will leave with you a  hundred rupees. I may not keep your waggon many days.\"    After it was dark, Harry went to the town and purchased some  paints, and other things, that he required for disguise. Having  used these, he went to the house of the British Resident and, on  stating who he was, he was shown in. Mr. Malet did not recognize,  in the roughly-dressed countryman, the young officer who had called  upon him before.    \"I am Harry Lindsay and, being in Poona, called upon you to give  you some information.\"    \"I recognize you by your voice,\" the Resident said; \"but I fear  that there is nothing of importance that you can tell me; now that  Nana Furnuwees is homeless, and Bajee Rao is no longer Peishwa.\"    \"Nana is not done with, yet, sir.\"    \"Why, he is a fugitive, with a handful of troops under him.\"    \"But he has his brains, sir, which are worth more than an army and,  believe me, if all goes well, it will not be long before he is back  in Poona, as minister to the Peishwa.\"    \"Minister to Chimnajee?\"    \"No, sir, minister to Bajee Rao.\"    \"I would that it were so,\" Mr. Malet said, \"but since one is a  fugitive and the other a prisoner, I see no chance, whatever, of  such a transformation.\"    \"I will briefly tell you, sir, what is preparing. Bajee, feeling  certain that he will, ere long, be sent to a fortress, has  communicated with Nana, imploring him to aid him.\"    \"If he has turned to Nana for support, he is either mad, or acting  as Balloba's tool.\"    \"On the contrary, sir, I think that his doing so shows that he  recognizes Nana's ability; and feels that, ere long, he may become  a useful ally. Already Nana has been at work. Holkar, who naturally  views with intense jealousy Scindia's entire control of the  territory of the Peishwa, has already agreed to put his whole army  in the field; Rao Phurkay will rebel, with the household troops  and, what is vastly more important, Scindia has embraced Nana's  offer of a large sum of money, and a grant of territory, to arrest  Balloba, and to replace Bajee on the musnud. In addition to this,  he has won over the Rajah of Berar, has incited the Rajah of  Kolapoore to attack the district of Purseram Bhow; and has obtained  the Nizam's approbation of a treaty, that had already been settled  between Nana and the Nizam's general, the basis of which is that  Bajee is to be re-established, with Nana himself as minister and,  on the other hand, the territory formerly seized by the Peishwa to  be restored.    \"My mission here is to inform Bajee Rao of the plans that have been  prepared, and to obtain from him a solemn engagement that Nana  shall be reappointed as his minister, on the success of his plans.\"    Mr. Malet listened to Harry with increasing astonishment.    \"This is important news, indeed,\" he said; \"marvellous, and of the  highest importance to me. Already I have been asked, by the Council  of Bombay, to give my opinion as to whether it is expedient to  render any assistance to Nana Furnuwees. It is, to them, almost as  important as to Nana that Scindia should not obtain supreme power.  I have replied that I could not recommend any such step, for that  Nana's cause seemed altogether lost; and that any aid to him would  be absolutely useless, and would only serve Scindia with a pretext  for declaring war against us. Of course, what you have told me  entirely alters the situation. It will not be necessary for the  Council to assist Nana, but they can give him fair words and, even  if Balloba should win the day, he will have no ground for accusing  us of having aided Nana.    \"It is impossible to overlook the value of your communication, Mr.  Lindsay; and I can promise you that you will not find the  Government of Bombay ungrateful, for it will relieve them of the  anxiety which the progress of events here has caused them.\"    On leaving the Residency, Harry returned to the farm where he had left  his horse and, early next morning, put on his disguise again, painted  lines round his eyes, touched some of the hairs of his eyebrows with  white paint, mixed some white horsehair with the tuft on the top of his  head, and dropped a little juice of a plant resembling belladonna--used  at times, by ladies in the east, to dilate the pupils of their eyes and  make them dark and brilliant--in his eyes.    Soyera had told him of this herb, when he related to her how Balloba  had detected him by the lightness of his eyes. He was greatly surprised  at the alteration it effected in his appearance, and felt assured that  even Balloba himself would not again recognize him.    He bought a dozen sacks of grain from the farmer and, placing these  in the bullock cart, started for Scindia's camp. He had, during the  night, buried the gold; for he thought that, until he knew his  ground, and could feel certain of entering Bajee Rao's camp  unquestioned, it would be better that there should be nothing in  the cart, were he searched, to betray him. He carried in his hand  the long staff universally used by bullock drivers and, passing  through Poona, arrived an hour later at the camp, which was pitched  some three miles from the city.    As large numbers of carts, with forage and provisions, arrived  daily in the camp for the use of the troops, no attention whatever  was paid to him and, on enquiring for the encampment of Bajee  Rao--one of whose officers had, he said, purchased the grain, for  his horses and those of his officers and escort--he soon found the  spot, which was on somewhat rising ground in the centre of the  camp. It was much larger than he had expected to find it as, beyond  being prevented from leaving, Bajee had full liberty, and was even  permitted to have some of his friends round him, and two or three  dozen troopers of his household regiment.    In charge of these was a young officer, who was well known to Harry  during the time of Mahdoo Rao. Seeing him standing in front of a  tent, Harry stopped the cart opposite to him and, leaving it, went  up to him.    \"Where shall I unload the cart?\" he asked.    \"I know nothing about it,\" the officer said. \"Who has ordered it?  The supply will be welcome enough, for we are very short of  forage.\"    Then, changing his tone, Harry said:    \"You do not know me, Nujeef. I am your friend, Puntojee.\"    \"Impossible!\" the other said, incredulously.    \"It is so. I am not here for amusement, as you may guess; but am on  a private mission to Bajee Rao. Will you inform him that I am here?  I dare not say whom I come from, even to you; but can explain  myself fully to him.\"    \"I will let him know, certainly, Puntojee; but there is little  doubt that Balloba has his spies here, and it will be necessary to  arrange that your meeting shall not be noticed. Do you sit down  here by your cart, as if waiting for orders where to unload it. I  will go across to Bajee's tent, and see him.\"    Nujeef accordingly went over to the rajah's tent, and returned in a  quarter of an hour.    \"Bajee will see you,\" he said. \"First unload your grain in the  lines of our cavalry, place some in front of your bullocks, and  leave them there; then cross to the tent next to Bajee's. It is  occupied by one of his officers, who carries the purse and makes  payments. Should you be watched, it would seem that you are only  going there to receive the price of the grain. Bajee himself will  slip out of the rear of his tent, and enter the next in the same  way. The officer is, at present, absent; so that you can talk  without anyone having an idea that you and Bajee are together.\"    Harry carried out the arrangement and, after leaving his bullocks,  made his way to the spot indicated. He found the young rajah had  gone there.    \"And you are Puntojee!\" the latter said. \"I saw you but a few  times, but Rao Phurkay has often mentioned your name, to me, as  being one who stood high in the confidence of my cousin Mahdoo.  Nujeef tells me that you have a private communication to make to  me; and indeed, I can well believe that. You would not thus  disguise yourself, unless the business was important.\"    \"It is, Your Highness. Nana Furnuwees has received your message. He  reciprocates your expressions of friendship, and has sent me here  to let you know that the time is approaching when your deliverance  from Balloba can be achieved.\"    He then delivered the message with which he had been entrusted.  Bajee's face became radiant, as he went on.    \"This is news, indeed,\" he said. \"That Phurkay was faithful to me,  I knew; but I thought that he was the only friend I had left. Truly  Nana Furnuwees is a great man, and I will gladly give the  undertaking he asks for; that, in the event of his succeeding in  placing me on the musnud, he shall be my minister, with the same  authority and power that he had under Mahdoo.\"    \"I have, at the farmhouse where I am stopping, a thousand gold  mohurs, which Nana has sent to enable you to begin your  preparations; but he urges that you should be extremely careful  for, as you see by what I have told you, he has ample"]]]
