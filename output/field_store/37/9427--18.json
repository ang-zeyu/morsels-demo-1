THE DEAN AND CHAPTER _earnestly hope that Visitors to the Cathedral  will contribute something to the Fund in aid of its Restoration. For  this purpose a box has been placed in the Nave, under the Screen, and a  book in which names, together with the amount of the donation, may be  entered. It will be seen that the need of Restoration is urgent, the  central tower being much shattered, and its south-eastern pier  presenting a very unsightly appearance. One of the most striking  features of the Cathedral, the beautiful groined roof of this tower is  at present entirely concealed by a scaffolding put up some years ago  when the work of Restoration was suspended for want of funds._    THE DEAN AND CHAPTER _feel that they may with the more confidence  appeal to the liberality of Visitors in aid of the Restoration, because  the Cathedral is open free of all charge throughout the day (except  during the hours of Divine Service), the Vergers not being allowed to  ask for any gratuity._"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/2097"],[0,"The Sign of the Four (#16)"],[1,"  Jones and I resumed our cigars and our talk.  Suddenly, however, Holmes's voice broke in upon us.    \"I think that you might offer me a cigar too,\" he said.    We both started in our chairs.  There was Holmes sitting close to us  with an air of quiet amusement.    \"Holmes!\" I exclaimed.  \"You here!  But where is the old man?\"    \"Here is the old man,\" said he, holding out a heap of white hair. \"Here  he is,--wig, whiskers, eyebrows, and all.  I thought my disguise was  pretty good, but I hardly expected that it would stand that test.\"    \"Ah, You rogue!\" cried Jones, highly delighted.  \"You would have made  an actor, and a rare one.  You had the proper workhouse cough, and  those weak legs of yours are worth ten pound a week. I thought I knew  the glint of your eye, though.  You didn't get away from us so easily,  You see.\"    \"I have been working in that get-up all day,\" said he, lighting his  cigar.  \"You see, a good many of the criminal classes begin to know  me,--especially since our friend here took to publishing some of my  cases:  so I can only go on the war-path under some simple disguise  like this.  You got my wire?\"    \"Yes; that was what brought me here.\"    \"How has your case prospered?\"    \"It has all come to nothing.  I have had to release two of my  prisoners, and there is no evidence against the other two.\"    \"Never mind.  We shall give you two others in the place of them. But  you must put yourself under my orders.  You are welcome to all the  official credit, but you must act on the line that I point out.  Is  that agreed?\"    \"Entirely, if you will help me to the men.\"    \"Well, then, in the first place I shall want a fast police-boat--a  steam launch--to be at the Westminster Stairs at seven o'clock.\"    \"That is easily managed.  There is always one about there; but I can  step across the road and telephone to make sure.\"    \"Then I shall want two stanch men, in case of resistance.\"    \"There will be two or three in the boat.  What else?\"    \"When we secure the men we shall get the treasure.  I think that it  would be a pleasure to my friend here to take the box round to the  young lady to whom half of it rightfully belongs.  Let her be the first  to open it.--Eh, Watson?\"    \"It would be a great pleasure to me.\"    \"Rather an irregular proceeding,\" said Jones, shaking his head.  \"However, the whole thing is irregular, and I suppose we must wink at  it.  The treasure must afterwards be handed over to the authorities  until after the official investigation.\"    \"Certainly.  That is easily managed.  One other point.  I should much  like to have a few details about this matter from the lips of Jonathan  Small himself.  You know I like to work the detail of my cases out.  There is no objection to my having an unofficial interview with him,  either here in my rooms or elsewhere, as long as he is efficiently  guarded?\"    \"Well, you are master of the situation.  I have had no proof yet of the  existence of this Jonathan Small.  However, if you can catch him I  don't see how I can refuse you an interview with him.\"    \"That is understood, then?\"    \"Perfectly.  Is there anything else?\"    \"Only that I insist upon your dining with us.  It will be ready in half  an hour.  I have oysters and a brace of grouse, with something a little  choice in white wines.--Watson, you have never yet recognized my merits  as a housekeeper.\"        Chapter X    The End of the Islander    Our meal was a merry one.  Holmes could talk exceedingly well when he  chose, and that night he did choose.  He appeared to be in a state of  nervous exaltation.  I have never known him so brilliant.  He spoke on  a quick succession of subjects,--on miracle-plays, on medieval pottery,  on Stradivarius violins, on the Buddhism of Ceylon, and on the  war-ships of the future,--handling each as though he had made a special  study of it.  His bright humor marked the reaction from his black  depression of the preceding days.  Athelney Jones proved to be a  sociable soul in his hours of relaxation, and faced his dinner with the  air of a bon vivant.  For myself, I felt elated at the thought that we  were nearing the end of our task, and I caught something of Holmes's  gaiety.  None of us alluded during dinner to the cause which had  brought us together.    When the cloth was cleared, Holmes glanced at his watch, and filled up  three glasses with port.  \"One bumper,\" said he, \"to the success of our  little expedition.  And now it is high time we were off.  Have you a  pistol, Watson?\"    \"I have my old service-revolver in my desk.\"    \"You had best take it, then.  It is well to be prepared.  I see that  the cab is at the door.  I ordered it for half-past six.\"    It was a little past seven before we reached the Westminster wharf, and  found our launch awaiting us.  Holmes eyed it critically.    \"Is there anything to mark it as a police-boat?\"    \"Yes,--that green lamp at the side.\"    \"Then take it off.\"    The small change was made, we stepped on board, and the ropes were cast  off.  Jones, Holmes, and I sat in the stern.  There was one man at the  rudder, one to tend the engines, and two burly police-inspectors  forward.    \"Where to?\" asked Jones.    \"To the Tower.  Tell them to stop opposite Jacobson's Yard.\"    Our craft was evidently a very fast one.  We shot past the long lines  of loaded barges as though they were stationary.  Holmes smiled with  satisfaction as we overhauled a river steamer and left her behind us.    \"We ought to be able to catch anything on the river,\" he said.    \"Well, hardly that.  But there are not many launches to beat us.\"    \"We shall have to catch the Aurora, and she has a name for being a  clipper.  I will tell you how the land lies, Watson.  You recollect how  annoyed I was at being balked by so small a thing?\"    \"Yes.\"    \"Well, I gave my mind a thorough rest by plunging into a chemical  analysis.  One of our greatest statesmen has said that a change of work  is the best rest.  So it is.  When I had succeeded in dissolving the  hydrocarbon which I was at work at, I came back to our problem of the  Sholtos, and thought the whole matter out again.  My boys had been up  the river and down the river without result.  The launch was not at any  landing-stage or wharf, nor had it returned.  Yet it could hardly have  been scuttled to hide their traces,--though that always remained as a  possible hypothesis if all else failed.  I knew this man Small had a  certain degree of low cunning, but I did not think him capable of  anything in the nature of delicate finesse.  That is usually a product  of higher education.  I then reflected that since he had certainly been  in London some time--as we had evidence that he maintained a continual  watch over Pondicherry Lodge--he could hardly leave at a moment's  notice, but would need some little time, if it were only a day, to  arrange his affairs.  That was the balance of probability, at any rate.\"    \"It seems to me to be a little weak,\" said I.  \"It is more probable  that he had arranged his affairs before ever he set out upon his  expedition.\"    \"No, I hardly think so.  This lair of his would be too valuable a  retreat in case of need for him to give it up until he was sure that he  could do without it.  But a second consideration struck me.  Jonathan  Small must have felt that the peculiar appearance of his companion,  however much he may have top-coated him, would give rise to gossip, and  possibly be associated with this Norwood tragedy.  He was quite sharp  enough to see that.  They had started from their head-quarters under  cover of darkness, and he would wish to get back before it was broad  light.  Now, it was past three o'clock, according to Mrs. Smith, when  they got the boat.  It would be quite bright, and people would be about  in an hour or so.  Therefore, I argued, they did not go very far.  They  paid Smith well to hold his tongue, reserved his launch for the final  escape, and hurried to their lodgings with the treasure-box. In a  couple of nights, when they had time to see what view the papers took,  and whether there was any suspicion, they would make their way under  cover of darkness to some ship at Gravesend or in the Downs, where no  doubt they had already arranged for passages to America or the  Colonies.\"    \"But the launch?  They could not have taken that to their lodgings.\"    \"Quite so.  I argued that the launch must be no great way off, in spite  of its invisibility.  I then put myself in the place of Small, and  looked at it as a man of his capacity would.  He would probably  consider that to send back the launch or to keep it at a wharf would  make pursuit easy if the police did happen to get on his track.  How,  then, could he conceal the launch and yet have her at hand when wanted?  I wondered what I should do myself if I were in his shoes.  I could  only think of one way of doing it.  I might land the launch over to  some boat-builder or repairer, with directions to make a trifling  change in her.  She would then be removed to his shed or yard, and so  be effectually concealed, while at the same time I could have her at a  few hours' notice.\"    \"That seems simple enough.\"    \"It is just these very simple things which are extremely liable to be  overlooked.  However, I determined to act on the idea.  I started at  once in this harmless seaman's rig and inquired at all the yards down  the river.  I drew blank at fifteen, but at the  sixteenth--Jacobson's--I learned that the Aurora had been handed over  to them two days ago by a wooden-legged man, with some trivial  directions as to her rudder.  'There ain't naught amiss with her  rudder,' said the foreman.  'There she lies, with the red streaks.'  At  that moment who should come down but Mordecai Smith, the missing owner?  He was rather the worse for liquor.  I should not, of course, have  known him, but he bellowed out his name and the name of his launch.  'I  want her to-night"]]]
