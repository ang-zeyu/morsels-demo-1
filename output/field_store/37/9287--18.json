It has the uplift and unction of  John Newton's--        How sweet the name of Jesus sounds        In the believer's ear.      \"GOD CALLING YET! SHALL I NOT HEAR?\"    Gerhard Tersteegen, the original author of the hymn, and one of the most  eminent religious poets of the Reformed German church in its early days,  was born in 1697, in the town of Mors, in Westphalia. He was left an  orphan in boyhood by the death of his father, and as his mother's means  were limited, he was put to work as an apprentice when very young, at  Muhlheim on the Ruhr, and became a ribbon weaver. Here, when about  fifteen years of age, he became deeply concerned for his soul, and  experienced a deep and abiding spiritual work. As a Christian, his  religion partook of the ascetic type, but his mysticism did not make him  useless to his fellow-men.    At the age of twenty-seven, he dedicated all his resources and energies  to the cause of Christ, writing the dedication in his own blood. \"God  graciously called me,\" he says, \"out of the world, and granted me the  desire to belong to Him, and to be willing to follow Him.\" He gave up  secular employments altogether, and devoted his whole time to religious  instruction and to the poor. His house became famous as the \"Pilgrims'  Cottage,\" and was visited by people high and humble from all parts of  Germany. In his lifetime he is said to have written one hundred and  eleven hymns. Died April 3, 1769.        God calling yet! shall I not hear?      Earth's pleasures shall I still hold dear?      Shall life's swift-passing years all fly,      And still my soul in slumber lie?           *       *       *       *       *        God calling yet! I cannot stay;      My heart I yield without delay.      Vain world, farewell; from thee I part;      The voice of God hath reached my heart.    The hymn was translated from the German by Miss Jane Borthwick, born in  Edinburgh, 1813. She and her younger sister, Mrs. Findlater, jointly  translated and published, in 1854, _Hymns From the Land of Luther_, and  contributed many poetical pieces to the _Family Treasury_. She died in  1897.    Another translation, imitating the German metre, is more euphonious,  though less literal and less easily fitted to music not specially  composed for it, on account of its \"feminine\" rhymes:        God calling yet! and shall I never hearken?      But still earth's witcheries my spirit darken;      This passing life, these passing joys all flying,      And still my soul in dreamy slumbers lying?      _THE TUNE._    Dr. Dykes' \"Rivaulx\" is a sober choral that articulates the  hymn-writer's sentiment with sincerity and with considerable  earnestness, but breathes too faintly the interrogative and expostulary  tone of the lines. To voice the devout solicitude and self-remonstrance  of the hymn there is no tune superior to \"Federal St.\"    The Hon. Henry Kemble Oliver, author of \"Federal St.,\" was born in  Salem, Mass., March, 1800, and was addicted to music from his childhood.  His father compelled him to relinquish it as a profession, but it  remained his favorite avocation, and after his graduation from Harvard  the cares of none of the various public positions he held, from  schoolmaster to treasurer of the state of Massachusetts, could ever wean  him from the study of music and its practice. At the age of thirty-one,  while sitting one day in his study, the last verse of Anne Steele's  hymn--        So fades the lovely blooming flower,    --floated into his mind, and an unbidden melody came with it. As he  hummed it to himself the words shaped the air, and the air shaped the  words.        Then gentle patience smiles on pain,      Then dying hope revives again,    --became--        See gentle patience smile on pain;      See dying hope revive again;    --and with the change of a word and a tense the hymn created the melody,  and soon afterward the complete tune was made. Two years later it was  published by Lowell Mason, and Oliver gave it the name of the street in  Salem on which his wife was born, wooed, won, and married. It adds a  pathos to its history that \"Federal St.\" was sung at her burial.    This first of Oliver's tunes was followed by \"Harmony Grove,\" \"Morning,\"  \"Walnut Grove,\" \"Merton,\" \"Hudson,\" \"Bosworth,\" \"Salisbury Plain,\"  several anthems and motets, and a \"Te Deum.\"    In his old age, at the great Peace Jubilee in Boston, 1872, the baton  was put into his hands, and the gray-haired composer conducted the  chorus of ten thousand voices as they sang the words and music of his  noble harmony. The incident made \"Federal St.\" more than ever a feature  of New England history. Oliver died in 1885.      \"MY GOD, HOW ENDLESS IS THY LOVE.\"    The spirited tune to this hymn of Watts, by Frederick Lampe, variously  named \"Kent\" and \"Devonshire,\" historically reaches back so near to the  poet's time that it must have been one of the earliest expressions of  his fervent words.    Johan Friedrich Lampe, born 1693, in Saxony, was educated in music at  Helmstadt, and came to England in 1725 as a band musician and composer  to Covent Garden Theater. His best-known secular piece is the music  written to Henry Carey's burlesque, \"The Dragon of Wantley.\"    Mrs. Rich, wife of the lessee of the theater, was converted under the  preaching of the Methodists, and after her husband's death her house  became the home of Lampe and his wife, where Charles Wesley often met  him.    The influence of Wesley won him to more serious work, and he became one  of the evangelist's helpers, supplying tunes to his singing campaigns.  Wesley became attached to him, and after his death--in Edinburgh,  1752--commemorated the musician in a funeral hymn.    In popular favor Bradbury's tune of \"Rolland\" has now superseded the old  music sung to Watts' lines--        My God, how endless is Thy love,        Thy gifts are every evening new,      And morning mercies from above        Gently distil like early dew.           *       *       *       *       *        I yield my powers to Thy command;        To Thee I consecrate my days;      Perpetual blessings from Thy hand        Demand perpetual songs of praise.    William Batchelder Bradbury, a pupil of Dr. Lowell Mason, and the  pioneer in publishing Sunday-school music, was born 1816, in York, Me.  His father, a veteran of the Revolution, was a choir leader, and  William's love of music was inherited. He left his father's farm, and  came to Boston, where he first heard a church-organ. Encouraged by Mason  and others to follow music as a profession, he went abroad, studied at  Leipsic, and soon after his return became known as a composer of sacred  tunes. He died in Montclair, N.J., 1868.      \"I'M NOT ASHAMED TO OWN MY LORD.\"    The favorite tune for this spiritual hymn, also by Watts, is old  \"Arlington,\" one of the most useful church melodies in the whole realm  of English psalmody. Its name clings to a Boston street, and the  beautiful chimes of Arlington St. church (Unitarian) annually ring its  music on special occasions, as it has since the bells were tuned:        I'm not ashamed to own my Lord        Or to defend His cause,      Maintain the honor of His Word,        The glory of His cross.        Jesus, my God!--I know His Name;        His Name is all my trust,      Nor will He put my soul to shame        Nor let my hope be lost.    Dr. Thomas Augustine Arne, the creator of \"Arlington,\" was born in  London, 1710, the son of a King St. upholsterer. He studied at Eton, and  though intended for the legal profession, gave his whole mind to music.  At twenty-three he began writing operas for his sister, Susanna (a  singer who afterwards became the famous tragic actress, Mrs. Cibber).    Arne's music to Milton's \"Comus,\" and to \"Rule Brittannia\" established  his reputation. He was engaged as composer to Drury Lane Theater, and in  1759 received from Oxford his degree of Music Doctor. Later in life he  turned his attention to oratorios, and other forms of sacred music, and  was the first to introduce female voices in choir singing. He died March  5, 1778, chanting hallelujahs, it is said, with his last breath.      \"IS THIS THE KIND RETURN?\"    Dr. Watts in this hymn gave experimental piety its hour and language of  reflection and penitence:        Is this the kind return?        Are these the thanks we owe,      Thus to abuse Eternal Love        Whence all our blessings flow?           *       *       *       *       *        Let past ingratitude        Provoke our weeping eyes.    United in loving wedlock with these words in former years was \"Golden  Hill,\" a chime of sweet counterpoint too rare to bury its authorship  under the vague phrase \"A Western Melody.\" It was caught evidently from  a forest bird[10] that flutes its clear solo in the sunsets of May and  June. There can be no mistaking the imitation--the same compass, the  same upward thrill, the same fall and warbled turn. Old-time folk used  to call for it, \"Sing, my Fairweather Bird.\" It lingers in a few of the  twenty- or thirty-years-ago collections, but stronger voices have  drowned it out of the new.    [Footnote 10: The wood thrush.]    \"Thacher,\" (set to the same hymn,) faintly recalls its melody.  Nevertheless \"Thacher\" is a good tune. Though commonly written in  sharps, contrasting the B flat of its softer and more liquid rival of  other days, it is one of Handel's strains, and lends the meaning and  pathos of the lyric text to voice and instrument.      \"WHEN I SURVEY THE WONDROUS CROSS.\"    This crown of all the sacred odes of Dr. Watts for the song-service of  the church of God was called by Matthew Arnold the \"greatest hymn in the  English language.\" The day the eminent critic died he heard it sung in  the Sefton Park Presbyterian Church, and repeated the opening lines  softly to himself again and again after the services."]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/18445"],[0,"Bohemians of the Latin Quarter (#16)"],[1,",\" said Marcel, who had an itch of punning, above all  in the morning, when he was terrible.    As Rodolphe had gained some money at the lansquenet played during the  evening, he carried off Musette and Marcel to a restaurant which was  just opening.    After breakfast, the three, who had no inclination for sleep, spoke of  finishing the day in the country, and as they found themselves close to  the railway station they got into the first train that started, which  landed them at Saint Germain.    During the whole of the night of the party and all of the rest of the  day Marcel, who was gunpowder which a single glance sufficed to kindle,  had been violently smitten by Mademoiselle Musette and paid her  \"highly-colored court,\" as he put it to Rodolphe. He even went so far as  to propose to the pretty girl to buy her furniture handsomer than the  last with the result of the sale of his famous picture, \"The Passage of  the Red Sea.\" Hence the artist saw with pain the moment arrive when it  became necessary to part from Musette, who whilst allowing him to kiss  her hands, neck and sundry other accessories, gently repulsed him every  time that he tried to violently burgle her heart.    On reaching Paris, Rodolphe left his friend with the girl, who asked the  artist to see her to her door.    \"Will you allow me to call on you?\" asked Marcel, \"I will paint your  portrait.\"    \"My dear fellow,\" replied she, \"I cannot give you my address, since  tomorrow I may no longer have one, but I will call and see you, and I  will mend your coat, which has a hole so big that one could shoot the  moon through it.\"    \"I will await your coming like that of the messiah,\" said Marcel.    \"Not quite so long,\" said Musette, laughing.    \"What a charming girl,\" said Marcel to himself, as he slowly walked  away. \"She is the Goddess of Mirth. I will make two holes in my coat.\"    He had not gone twenty paces before he felt himself tapped on the  shoulder. It was Mademoiselle Musette.    \"My dear Monsieur Marcel,\" said she, \"are you a true knight?\"    \"I am. 'Rubens and my lady,' that is my motto.\"    \"Well then, hearken to my woes and pity take, most noble sir,\" returned  Musette, who was slightly tinged with literature, although she murdered  grammar in fine style, \"the landlord has taken away the key of my room  and it is eleven o'clock at night. Do you understand?\"    \"I understand,\" said Marcel, offering Musette his arm. He took her to  his studio on the Quai aux Fleurs.    Musette was hardly able to keep awake, but she still had strength  enough to say to Marcel, taking him by the hand, \"You remember what you  have promised?\"    \"Oh Musette! charming creature!\" said the artist in a somewhat moved  tone, \"you are here beneath a hospitable roof, sleep in peace. Good  night, I am off.\"    \"Why so?\" said Musette, her eyes half closed. \"I am not afraid, I can  assure you. In the first place, there are two rooms. I will sleep on  your sofa.\"    \"My sofa is too hard to sleep on, it is stuffed with carded pebbles. I  will give you hospitality here, and ask it for myself from a friend who  lives on the same landing. It will be more prudent,\" said he. \"I usually  keep my word, but I am twenty-two and you are eighteen, Musette,--and I  am off. Good night.\"    The next morning at eight o'clock Marcel entered her room with a pot of  flowers that he had gone and bought in the market. He found Musette, who  had thrown herself fully dressed on the bed, and was still sleeping. At  the noise made by him she woke, and held out her hand.    \"What a good fellow,\" said she.    \"Good fellow,\" repeated Marcel, \"is not that a term of ridicule?\"    \"Oh!\" exclaimed Musette, \"why should you say that to me? It is not nice.  Instead of saying spiteful things offer me that pretty pot of flowers.\"    \"It is, indeed, for you that I have brought them up,\" said Marcel. \"Take  it, and in return for my hospitality sing me one of your songs, the echo  of my garret may perhaps retain something of your voice, and I shall  still hear you after you have departed.\"    \"Oh! so you want to show me the door?\" said Musette. \"Listen, Marcel, I  do not beat about the bush to say what my thoughts are. You like me and  I like you. It is not love, but it is perhaps its seed. Well, I am not  going away, I am going to stop here, and I shall stay here as long as  the flowers you have just given me remain unfaded.\"    \"Ah!\" exclaimed Marcel, \"they will fade in a couple of days. If I had  known I would have bought immortelles.\"           *       *       *       *       *    For a fortnight Musette and Marcel lived together, and led, although  often without money, the most charming life in the world. Musette felt  for the artist an affection which had nothing in common with her  preceding passions, and Marcel began to fear that he was seriously in  love with his mistress. Ignorant that she herself was very much afraid  of being equally smitten, he glanced every morning at the condition of  the flowers, the death of which was to bring about the severance of  their connection, and found it very difficult to account for their  continued freshness. But he soon had a key to the mystery. One night,  waking up, he no longer found Musette beside him. He rose, hastened into  the next room, and perceived his mistress, who profited nightly by his  slumbers to water the flowers and hinder them from perishing.          CHAPTER VII    THE BILLOWS OF PACTOLUS      It was the nineteenth of March, 184--. Should Rodolphe reach the age of  Methuselah, he will never forget the date; for it was on that day, at  three in the afternoon, that our friend issued from a banker's where he  had just received five hundred francs in current and sounding specie.    The first use Rodolphe made of this slice of Peru which had fallen into  his pocket was not to pay his debts, inasmuch as he had sworn to himself  to practice economy and go to no extra expense. He had a fixed idea on  this subject, and declared that before thinking of superfluities, one  ought to provide for necessaries. Therefore it was that he paid none of  his creditors, and bought a Turkish pipe which he had long coveted.    Armed with this purchase, he directed his steps towards the lodging of  his friend Marcel, who had for some time given him shelter. As he  entered Marcel's studio, Rodolphe's pockets rang like a village-steeple  on a grand holiday. On hearing this unusual sound, Marcel supposed it  was one of his neighbors, a great speculator, counting his profits on  'Change, and muttered, \"There's that impertinent fellow next door  beginning his music again! If this is to go on, I shall give notice to  the landlord. It's impossible to work with such a noise. It tempts one  to quit one's condition of poor artist and turn robber, forty times  over.\"    So, never suspecting that it was his friend Rodolphe changed into a  Croesus, Marcel again set to work on his \"Passage of the Red Sea,\" which  had been on his easel nearly three years.    Rodolphe, who had not yet spoken, meditating an experiment which he was  about to make on his friend, said to himself, \"We shall laugh in a  minute. Won't it be fun?\" and he let fall a five-franc piece on the  floor.    Marcel raised his eyes and looked at Rodolphe, who was as grave as an  article in the \"Revue des deux Mondes.\" Then he picked up the piece of  money with a well-satisfied air, and made a courteous salute to it; for,  vagabond artist as he was, he understood the usages of society, and was  very civil to strangers. Knowing, moreover, that Rodolphe had gone out  to look for money, Marcel, seeing that his friend had succeeded in his  operations, contented himself with admiring the result, without  inquiring by what means it had been obtained. Accordingly, he went to  work again without speaking, and finished drowning an Egyptian in the  waves of the Red Sea. As he was terminating this homicide, Rodolphe let  fall another piece, laughing in his sleeve at the face the painter was  going to make.    At the sonorous sound of the metal, Marcel bounded up as if he had  received an electric shock, and cried, \"What! Number two!\"    A third piece rolled on the floor, then another, then one more; finally  a whole quadrille of five-franc pieces were dancing in the room.    Marcel began to show evident signs of mental alienation; and Rodolphe  laughed like the pit of a Parisian theatre at the first representation  of a very tragical tragedy. Suddenly, and without any warning, he  plunged both hands into his pockets, and the money rushed out in a  supernatural steeple-chase. It was an inundation of Pactolus; it was  Jupiter entering Danae's chamber.    Marcel remained silent, motionless, with a fixed stare; his astonishment  was gradually operating upon him a transformation similar to that which  the untimely curiosity of Lott's wife brought upon her: by the time that  Rodolphe had thrown his last hundred francs on the floor, the painter  was petrified all down one side of his body.    Rodolphe laughed and laughed. Compared with his stormy mirth, the  thunder of an orchestra of sax-horns would have been no more than the  crying of a child at the breast.    Stunned, strangled, stupefied by his emotions, Marcel thought himself in  a dream. To drive away the nightmare, he bit his finger till he brought  blood, and almost made himself scream with pain. He then perceived that,  though trampling upon money, he was perfectly awake. Like a personage in  a tragedy, he ejaculated:    \"Can I believe my eyes?\" and then seizing Rodolphe's hand, he added,  \"Explain to me this mystery.\"    \"Did I explain it 'twould be one no more.\"    \"Come, now!\"    \"This gold is the fruit of the sweat of my brow,\" said Rodolphe, picking  up the money and arranging it on the table. He then went a few steps and  looked respectfully at the five hundred francs ranged in heaps, thinking  to himself, \"Now then, my dreams will be realized!\"    \"There"]]]
