He writes home that he did not  find the ordeal so formidable as it used to be before the smaller  audiences at Eton, for at Oxford they sometimes mustered as many as a  hundred or a hundred and fifty. He spoke for a strongly-worded motion on  a happier theme, in favour of the policy and memory of Canning. In the  summer of 1831, he mentions a debate in which a motion was proposed in  favour of speedy emancipation of the West Indian slaves. 'I moved an  amendment that education of a religious kind was the fit object of  legislation, which was carried by thirty-three to twelve.' Of the most  notable of all his successes at the Union we shall soon hear.                                  DAILY LIFE    His little diary, written for no eye but his own, and in the use of  which I must beware of the sin of violating the sanctuary, contains in  the most concise of daily records all his various activities, and, at  least after the summer at Cuddesdon, it presents an attractive picture  of duty, industry, and attention, 'constant as the motion of the day.'  The entries are much alike, and a few of them will suffice to bring his  life and him before us. The days for 1830 may almost be taken at random.         _May 10, 1830._--Prospectively, I have the following work to do in       the course of this term.

Construing Sophocles.         _September 18._--Went down early to Wheatley for letters. It is       indeed true [the death of Huskisson], and he, poor man, was in his       last agonies when I was playing cards on Wednesday night. When       shall we learn wisdom? Not that I see folly in the fact of playing       cards, but it is too often accompanied by a dissipated spirit.    He did not escape the usual sensations of the desultory when fate forces  them to wear the collar. 'In fact, at times I find it very irksome, and  my having the inclination to view it in that light is to me the surest  demonstration that my mind was in great want of some discipline, and  some regular exertion, for hitherto I have read by fits and starts and  just as it pleased me. I hope that this vacation [summer of 1830] will  confer on me one benefit more important than any having reference merely  to my class--I mean the habit of steady application and strict economy  of time.'                          CORRESPONDENCE WITH HALLAM    Among the recorded fragmentary items of 1830, by the way, he read Mill's  celebrated essay on Coleridge, which, when it was republished a  generation later along with the companion essay on Bentham, made so  strong an impression on the Oxford of my day. He kept up a  correspondence with Hallam, now at Cambridge, and an extract from one of  Hallam's letters may show something of the writer, as of the friend for  whose sympathising mind it was intended:--         Academical honours would be less than nothing to me were it not for       my father's wishes, and even these are moderate on the subject. If       it please God that I make the name I bear honoured in a second       generation, it will be by inward power which is its own reward; if       it please Him not, I hope to go down to the grave unrepining, for I       have lived and loved and been loved; and what will be the momentary       pangs of an atomic existence when the scheme of that providential       love which pervades, sustains, quickens this boundless universe       shall at the last day be unfolded and adored? The great truth       which, when we are rightly impressed with it, will liberate mankind       is that no man has a right to isolate himself, because every man is       a particle of a marvellous whole; that when he suffers, since it is       for the good of that whole, he, the particle, has no right to       complain; and in the long run, that which is the good of all will       abundantly manifest itself to be the good of each. Other belief       consists not with theism. This is its centre. Let me quote to their       purpose the words of my favourite poet; it will do us good to hear       his voice, though but for a moment:--                         'One adequate support         For the calamities of mortal life         Exists--one only: an assured belief         That the procession of our fate, howe'er         Sad or disturbed, is ordered by a Being         Of infinite benevolence and power,         Whose everlasting purposes embrace         All accidents, converting them to good.'[49]    Hallam's father, in that memoir so just and tender which, he prefixes to  his son's literary remains, remarks that all his son's talk about this  old desperate riddle of the origin and significance of evil, like the  talk of Leibnitz about it, resolved itself into an unproved assumption  of the necessity of evil. In truth there is little sign that either  Arthur Hallam or Gladstone had in him the making of the patient and  methodical thinker in the high abstract sphere. They were both of them  cast in another mould. But the efficacy of human relationships springs  from a thousand subtler and more mysterious sources than either patience  or method in our thinking. Such marked efficacy was there in the  friendship of these two, both of them living under pure skies, but one  of the pair endowed besides with 'the thews that throw the world.'    Whether in Gladstone's diary or in his letters, in the midst of  Herodotus and Butler and Aristotle and the rest of the time-worn sages,  we are curiously conscious of the presence of a spirit of action,  affairs, excitement. It is not"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/21102"],[0,"Tom and Some Other Girls: A Public School Story (#16)"],[1,"dream of  nothing else.  Even her joy of getting her remove from the \"Bantlings\"  into a higher team was swallowed up in the overwhelming interest, while  Dorothy was filled at once with admiration and disgust at the monotony  of her conversation.    \"I don't know, and I don't care!\" she replied callously, when anxiously  consulted about a point in mathematics.  \"I've come out to play, and I'm  not going to rack my brains for you or anyone else.  You are getting a  regular bore, Rhoda!  It's like walking about with `Magnall's  Questions.'  Let's talk about frolics, or holidays, or something nice,  and not worry about stupid old lessons.\"    Well!  Rhoda told herself, it was no wonder if Dorothy _were_ medium, if  this was the way she regarded her studies.  If she took no more interest  than this in the coming contest, what could she expect from the result?  She would be sorry, poor dear, when she saw her name at the bottom of  the list!  There was no help to be expected from Dorothy; but Rhoda  stored up a few knotty questions, and took the first opportunity of  asking Tom for a solution.  She had discovered that Tom liked nothing  better than to be consulted by the younger girls, and had a tactful way  of asking help in return, which took away the sense of obligation.    \"Oh, by-the-by,\" she would call to Rhoda, in her elegant fashion, \"you  are a bit of a German sausage, aren't you?  Just read over that passage  for me.  I've been puzzling over it for the whole of the evening,\" and  then would follow some blissful moments, when Rhoda would skim lightly  over the difficulty, and feel the eyes of the girls fixed admiringly  upon her.    In the present instance a wet Saturday afternoon afforded a good  opportunity for the desired questioning.  The Hurst girls did not stay  indoors for an ordinary drizzle, but this was a downpour of so hopeless  a character that even the most enthusiastic athletes felt that the  house-parlour was preferable to the soaking, wind-swept grounds.  They  gathered together, stoked up the fire, and prepared to spend the two  hours' leisure as fancy should dictate, some girls reading, some sewing,  and some making themselves as comfortable as circumstances would permit,  and doing nothing at all with every appearance of enjoyment.    \"If we had only some chestnuts,\" said one of the lazy ones, \"how happy  we might be!  I have a wild craving for chestnuts.  It came over me  suddenly just now, sitting looking at that fire.\"    \"I think,\" said Irene Grey solemnly, \"it's very sad, but I do think a  school like this makes one horribly greedy.  You get so tired of the  food, and have such a longing for something that _isn't_ wholesome.  I  assure you, my dears, there have been occasions when the centre table  has had beef, while we have had mutton, when I could have wept--simply  wept!  I should like to order a meal regardless of everything but what I  like--lobster mayonnaise, and salmon, and veal cutlets, and ice pudding,  and strawberries and cream, and fizzy lemonade.  That would be something  like a dinner--better than old joints and milk puddings!\"    The girls groaned in sympathy, and Rhoda took advantage of their  absorption to cross to Tom's desk and consult her quietly on the knotty  points.  The solutions were remarkably simple--when you knew them!--and  Tom delivered herself solemnly on the subject.    \"You don't think, my dear; you don't reflect.  Your brain would help you  out, but you don't give it a chance.  It's what I am always saying to  this room--it's not cram you need, it's intelligence!  Use your reason!  Cultivate your faculties!  Now, then, I'll tell you what I'll do!\"--she  raised her voice suddenly, and swung round in her seat.  \"I'll give you  girls an examination myself.  You need some practice before the real  business begins, and it will be just the thing for this wet afternoon.  Get out your books and pencils and I'll dictate the questions.  It's to  be a `General Intelligence' paper, and the examiner's instructions are--  use your wits!  They will not be the ordinary blunt, straightforward  questions manufactured by the masculine mind, and intended mainly for  the coarse, masculine ability, but full of depth and subtlety, so that  they will require careful consideration.  If you go scribbling down your  answers before you have read the questions, you'll be sorry, that's all;  but don't say you were not warned.  Now, then, are you ready? ...  We  will begin our studies to-day, young ladies, with a problem in  calculation!\"  She deepened her voice into such an accurate imitation of  the Arithmetical Mistress as filled her listeners with delight.  \"Attention to the board!--If a room were 20 feet long, 13 feet broad, 11  feet high, and 17 feet square, how much Liberty wall-paper 27 inches  wide would be required to paper it, allowing 5 feet square for the  fireplace and seven by three for the door?\"    The girls wrote down the question, not, however, without some murmurs of  protest.    \"If there is one kind of sum I hate more than another, it's these horrid  old wall-papers!\" declared Bertha Stacey.  \"I shall never be a paper-  hanger, so I don't see why I should worry my head.  I don't call _this_  General Intelligence.\"    \"I expect we shall have a taste of most subjects; but really, Tom,  really now--the room could not be 17 feet square if your other  measurements were right!\" argued Irene, who knew arithmetic to be her  strong point, and was not sorry to impress the fact on her companions.  \"You have made a mistake.\"    She expected the examiner to be discomfited, but Tom fixed her with a  glittering eye, and demanded if perchance she had _seen_ the room in  question, since she was so positive.    \"No, of course not, but then-- You know quite well--\"    \"Well, I _have_, so perhaps you will allow me to know better.  Go on,  young ladies, and the next one who dares to raise any objections gets  ten bad marks to begin her list.  I must have perfect submission.  Five  minutes allowed for working!\"    The time proved all too short for some of the workers, for the less  expert they were the more elaborate became their calculations, until  page after page was filled with straggling figures.  Thomasina made a  round of inspection, frowning over each book in turn, protesting,  scolding, marking the result with a big black cross.  According to her  verdict everyone was wrong, although five girls had arrived at the same  result; and Irene obstinately disputed the decision.    \"I _know_ it is right!  Work it for yourself, and see.  It's a simple  enough sum, and any one could tell--\"    \"That's apparently just what they can't do!  I don't deny that you may  be correct in the broad, vulgar sense, but that is not enough for me.  I  expect you to grasp the inner meaning.  Now the _real_ answer to this  question is that there can be no answer!  To a perceptive mind it would  be impossible to reply without further information.  It entirely depends  on how the paper is cut out, and the amount of waste incurred in  matching the pattern!\"    The girls shrieked aloud in mingled protest and delight.  It was too  bad; it was ripping, it was mean; it was killing; they all spoke  together and at the pitch of their voices, and alternately abused and  applauded until they were tired.  The _denouement_ had taken them by  surprise, though in truth they knew their Head too well to have taken  the examination seriously.  When Tom played schoolmistress there was  bound to be a joke in ambush, and they settled down to question number  two with minds alert for a trap.    \"We will now, young ladies, take an excursion into the realms of  Literature, and test your insight into human nature.  I will ask you, if  you please, to compare the respective characters of Alfred the Great and  Miss Charlotte Yonge--`Jo March' and Joseph Chamberlain--four great,  and, it will be obvious to all, strongly-defined personalities.  I shall  be interested to hear your distinctions!\"    It appeared, however, as if there would be little to interest, for most  of the girls stared blankly into space, as if powerless to tackle such a  subject.  Rhoda was one of the few exceptions, and scribbled unceasingly  with a complacent sense of being on her own ground until the limit of  time was reached.  Tom had evidently noticed her diligence, for she  called out a peremptory, \"Rhoda, read aloud your answer!\" which was  flattering, if at the same time slightly alarming.    \"Ahem--er--er--in the historical character of Alfred the Great we find  combined the characteristics of courage and simplicity.  He waged a long  and unequal fight, and was equally inspired by failures or success.    \"In the person of Miss Charlotte Yonge we discover the same virtues, but  in a softer and more feminine mould.  Her heroes are for the most part  refined and cultivated young men, actuated by the highest motives--\"    \"Stop!  Stop!\" screamed Thomasina desperately.  \"For pity sake spare us  the rest.  Such deadly propriety I never encountered!  It reminds me of  the Fairchild family at their very worst.  If _that's_ the sort of thing  you are going to write, Rhoda, I pity the poor examiners.  And what do  you mean by Alfred fighting?  He was a most peaceful creature, so far as  I have heard!\"    \"Thomasina! the war with the Danes--all those years!  You must  remember!\"    \"I don't remember a thing about it.  How could a man fight the Danes  living in a peaceful retreat in the Isle of Wight, as Tennyson did  for--?\"    Tennyson!  Tennyson!  Who spoke of Tennyson?  Oh! it was too bad; too  mean!  How on earth could anyone be expected to guess that Tom had meant  Tennyson, when she had expressly said Alfred the Great?  Rhoda protested  loudly, and the other girls backed her up; but Tom was obdurate.    \"And isn't Tennyson known as `Alfred the Great' as well as the other  crittur?  It is just another example of want of intelligence!  You read  "]]]
