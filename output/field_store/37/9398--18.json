To-night they were all sharing the aloofness from the time, an aloofness  which she herself had known for years. All save Jenny. To Jenny's house,  in defiance of that dog-eared paper in the post office, Christmas had  come. Not a Christmas of \"present trading,\" not a Christmas of things  at all; but _Christmas_. Unto them a child was born.    \"Jenny's the only one in this town that's got a real Christmas,\" thought  Mary, on her way to meet her own little guest.    The Simeon Buck North American Dry Goods Exchange was dark, too, and  from its cave of window the gray Saint Nicholas looked out, bearing his  flag--and he to-night an idle, mummy thing of no significance. The Abel  Ames General Merchandise Emporium was closed, but involuntarily Mary  stopped before it. In its great plate-glass window a single candle  burned. She stood for a moment looking.    \"Why, that's what they do, some places, to let the Christ-child in,\"  Mary thought. \"I wonder if Abel knows. How funny--for a store!\"    Some one whom she did not know passed her and looked too.    \"Kind o' nice,\" said the other.    \"Real nice,\" Mary returned, and went on with a little glow.    Abel's candle, and the arc light shining like cold blue crystal before  the dark Town Hall, and the post-office light where the dog-eared list  hung and the telegraph key clicked out its pretence at hand touching  with all the world, these were the only lights the street showed--save  Capella, that went beside her and, as she looked, seemed almost to stand  above the town.    At Mis' Moran's house on the other side of the square, the children were  waiting for her--Bennet and Gussie and Tab and Pep and little Emily.  They ran before Mary in the road, all save little Emily, who walked  clasping Mary's hand.    \"Aren't you staying up late, Emily?\" Mary asked her.    \"Yes,\" assented the child, contentedly.    \"Won't you be sleepy?\" Mary pursued.    \"I was going to stay awake anyhow,\" she said; \"I ain't goin' sleep all  night. We said so. We're goin' stay 'wake and see Santa Claus go by.\"    \"Go by?\" Mary repeated.    \"Yes,\" the child explained; \"you don't think that'll hurt, do you?\" she  asked anxiously. \"And then,\" she pursued, \"if we don't see him, we'll  know he's dead everywheres else, too. An' then we're goin' bury him  to-morrow morning, up to Gussie's house.\"    At the station, no one was yet about. The telegraph instrument was  clicking there, too, signaling the world; a light showed in the office  behind a row of sickly geraniums; the wind came down through the cut and  across the tracks and swept the little platform. But the children  begging to stay outside, Mary stood in a corner by the telegraph  operator's bay window and looked across to the open meadows beyond the  tracks and up at the great star. The meadows, sloping to an horizon  hill, were even and white, as if an end of sky had been pulled down and  spread upon them. Utter peace was there, not the primeval peace that is  negation, but a silence that listened.    \"'While shepherds watched their flocks by night, all seated on the  ground,...'\" Mary thought and looked along the horizon hill. The time  needed an invocation from some one who watched, as many voices, through  many centuries, had made invocation on Christmas Eve. For a moment,  looking over the lonely white places where no one watched, as no  one--save only Jenny--watched in the town, Mary forgot the children....    The shoving and grating of baggage truck wheels recalled her. Just  beyond the bay window she saw little Emily lifted to the truck and the  four others follow, and the ten heels dangle in air.    \"Now!\" said Pep. And a chant arose:        \"'Twas the night before Christmas when all           through the house      Not a creature was stirring, not even a mouse.      The stockings were hung by the chimney with           care      In the hope that Saint Nicholas soon would           be there....\"    Upborne by one, now by another, now by all three voices, the verses went  on unto the end. And it was as if not only Tab and Pep and Bennet and  Gussie and little Emily were chanting, but all children who had ever  counted the days to Christmas and had found Christmas the one piece of  magic that is looked on with kindness by a grown-up world. The magic of  swimming holes, for example, is largely a forbidden magic; the magic of  loud noises, of fast motion, of living things in pockets, of far  journeys, of going off alone, of digging caves, of building fires, of  high places, of many closed doors, words, mechanisms, foods, ownerships,  manners, costumes, companions, and holidays are denied them. But in  Christmas their affinity for mystery is recognized, encouraged,  gratified, annually provided for. The little group on the baggage truck  chanted their watch over a dead body of Christmas, but its magic was  there, inviolate. The singsong verses had almost the dignity of lyric  expression, of the essence of familiarity with that which is unknown. As  if, because humanity had always recognized that the will to Christmas  was greater than it knew, these words had somehow been made to catch  and reproduce, for generations, some faint spirit of the midwinter  mystery.    The 'bus rattled up to the platform and Buff Miles leaped down and  blanketed his horses, talking to them as was his wont.        \"So, holly and mistletoe,      So, holly and mistletoe,      So, holly, and mistletoe,      Over and over and over, oh....\"    he was singing as he came round the corner of the station.    \"It ain't Christmas yet,\" he observed defensively to Mary. \"It ain't  forbid except for Christmas Day, is it?\"    He went and bent over the children on the truck.    \"Look alive as soon as you can do it,\" Mary heard him say to them, and  wondered.    She stood looking up the track. Across the still fields, lying empty  and ready for some presence, came flashing the point of flame that  streamed from the headlight of the train. The light shone out like a  signal flashed back to the star standing above the town.          XII      Ten minutes after Mary Chavah had left her house, every window was  lighted, a fire was kindled in the parlour, and neighbours came from the  dark and fell to work at the baskets they had brought.    It was marvelous what homely cheer arose. The dining-room table,  stretched at its fullest length and white-covered, was various with the  yellow and red of fruit and salads, the golden brown of cake and rolls,  and the mosaic of dishes. The fire roared in the flat-topped stove on  whose \"wings\" covered pans waited, and everywhere was that happy stir  and touch and lift, that note of preparation which informs a time as  sunshine or music will strike its key.    \"My land, the oven--the warming oven. Mary ain't got one. However will  we keep the stuff hot?\" Mis' Winslow demanded. \"What time is it?\"    \"We'd ought to had my big coffee-pot. We'd ought to set two going. I  donno why I didn't think of it,\" Mis' Moran grieved.    \"Well,\" said Mis' Mortimer Bates, \"when the men get here--if they ever  _do_ get here--we'll send one of 'em off somewheres for the truck we  forgot. What time is it?\"    \"Here comes a whole cartload of folks,\" Mis' Moran announced. \"I hope  and pray they've got the oysters--they'd ought to be popped in the  baking oven a minute. What time did you say it is?\"    \"It's twenty minutes past seven,\" Mis' Winslow said, pushing her hair  straight back, regardless of its part, \"and we ain't ready within 'leven  hundred miles.\"    \"Well, if they only all get here,\" Mis' Bates said, ringing golden and  white stuffed eggs on Mary's blue platter; \"it's their all being here  when she gets here that I want. I ain't worried about the supper--much.\"    \"The road's black with folks,\" Mis' Moran went on. \"I'm so _deadly_  afraid I didn't make enough sandwiches. Oh, I donno why it wasn't given  me to make more, I'm sure.\"    \"Who's seeing to them in the parlour? Who's getting their baskets out  here? Where they finding a place for their wraps? Who's lighting the  rest of the lamps? What time is it?\" demanded Mis' Winslow, cutting her  cakes.    \"Oh,\" said Mis' Bates from a cloud of brown butter about the cooking  stove, \"I donno whether we've done right. I donno but we've broke our  word to the Christmas paper. I donno whether we ain't going to get  ourselves criticized for this as never folks was criticized before.\"    Mis' Moran changed her chair to the draughtless corner back of the  cooking stove and offered to stir the savoury saucepan.    \"I know it,\" she said, \"I know it. We never planned much in the first  start. It grew and it grew like it grew with its own bones. But mebbe  there's some won't believe that, one secunt.\"    Mis' Winslow straightened up from the table and held out a hand with  fingers frosting-tipped.    \"Well,\" she said, with a great period, \"if we _have_ broke our word to  the Christmas paper, I'd rather stand up here with my word broke this  way than with it kept so good it hurt me. Is it half-past seven yet?\"    \"I wish Ellen Bourne was here,\" Mis' Bates observed. \"She sent her salad  dressing over and lent her silver and her Christmas rose for the  table--but come she would not. I wonder if she couldn't come over now  if we sent after her, last minute?\"    Simeon Buck, appearing a few minutes later at the kitchen door to set a  basket inside, was dispatched for Ellen Bourne, the warming oven, and  the coffee-pot, collectively. He took with him Abel Ames, who was  waiting for him without. And it chanced that they knocked at the  Bournes' door just after Ben Helders had driven away with the little  boy, so that the men found the family still in the presence of the  little tree.    \"Hello,\" said Simeon, aghast, \"Christmassing away all by yourselves,  I'll be"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/20521"],[0,"The New York Times Current History, A Monthly Magazine (#16)"],[1," Albanian  settlement. The consent of Austria to this arrangement would seem to  have been secured.    At present Albania is under six different regimes. Scutari and its  neighborhood is governed by a local commission composed of Moslems and  Christians. Avlona is also administered by a commission. The Mirdites  form a separate State under Prenk Bib Doda. The Malissors remain  isolated under their patriarchal institutions. The southern districts  have been appropriated by the Greek invaders. Durazzo and the central  regions obey Essad Pasha, who enjoys the title of Prime Minister and  is recognized by the International Commission. That shadowy body, now  reduced to four members, personates the ghost of the European concert.  Except in the south the country is remarkably tranquil under its  indigenous institutions.    After he had left Albania Prince William of Wied received a telegram  from the King of Italy assuring him of support in the future. His  subsequent inclusion, however, in the German General Staff is regarded  as seriously compromising to his prospects as sovereign of Albania.      ITALY'S SANITARY MISSION.    [From The London Morning Post, Oct. 28, 1914.]    ROME, Oct. 27.    The dispatch of the battleship Dandolo, the Climene and other Italian  warships to Valona is due to the Government's knowledge of a scheme  for starting an agitation tending to infringe the decision of the  London Conference, which declared Albania neutral. Ismail Kemal Bey,  whom I have just seen, expressed his satisfaction at Italy's action at  Valona on both political and humanitarian grounds. He did not think  that the step would lead to complications, and described the condition  of the people at Valona as very miserable.    The Tribuna, commenting on the Government announcement, declares that  Italy's aim is for the present solely humanitarian, since the  miserable conditions of Valona necessitate sanitary aid. A few  companies of marines will land from the Dandolo to protect the  Sanitary Mission. With regard to coast surveillance, the British and  French Governments have warned Italy of a suspicious Moslem movement  in the harbor of Smyrna, whence a thousand rabid young Turks have  started or are starting on two steamers hired by the committee for  Albania, with the intention of hoisting the Turkish flag and  reannexing Albania to Turkey. Italy, in perfect accord with all the  signatories of the London Conference, proposes to thwart the attempt.    The Giornale d'Italia considers that what has been done at Valona is  sufficient affirmation of Italian interests. Italy never meditated  expeditions into the interior or a protectorate over Albania. The  Government's intention is to show that whoever touches Valona touches  Italian interests, which are that no power shall establish a naval  base there.      SASENO OCCUPIED.    [From The London Times, Oct. 30, 1914.]    ROME, Oct. 30.    The Italian occupation of the rocky and desolate islet of Saseno  which, from a strategic point of view, completely dominates the sea  approaches to Avlona, is a logical consequence of the occupation of  that town for the purpose of establishing a hospital and maintaining  order. The islet itself was for some months in 1913 and 1914 a bone  of contention between the Italians, who insisted on obtaining it for  the Principality of Albania, and the Greeks, who were equally anxious  to retain it in their own possession. With Saseno under the control of  a foreign power, the possessor of Avlona could never make the town  into a place of arms.    Saseno, as one of the Ionian Islands, became a British protectorate in  virtue of the Treaty of Paris of Nov. 5, 1815, but was given to Greece  by the Treaty of London of March 29, 1864. The Ambassadors' Conference  decided in the Autumn of last year that it was illogical to allow the  chief harbor of Albania to be dominated by the territory of a foreign  power, and by the Protocol of Florence, Dec. 19, 1913, it was  definitely included in Albania. This decision was ratified by  legislative enactment in Greece, to which effect was given by King  Constantine's proclamation of June 13, 1914, shortly after which the  Hellenic garrison was withdrawn. During the Greek regime, the island,  being neutralized by the Treaty of 1864, was quite unimportant, and at  one time the Turks by arrangement with the Hellenic Government,  maintained a lighthouse there.      GREEK TROOPS IN EPIRUS.    [From The Morning Post, London, Oct. 28, 1914.]    ATHENS, Oct. 26.    In view of the continuous Albanian attacks and the growing insecurity  in Northern Epirus the Greek Government today ordered Greek troops to  occupy the districts of Argyrocastro and Premeti. The official  communique just issued declares this to be an entirely provisional  measure to restore order and security in a country already exhausted  by prolonged sanguinary conflicts, and Greece proposes to continue to  adhere to the international arrangements regarding Epirus. It goes  without saying that this reoccupation coincides entirely with public  opinion, which has long been exercised over the sufferings of the  Epirotes.      ASSENT OF THE POWERS.    [From The London Morning Post, Oct. 30, 1914.]    Following are the replies of the great powers (states Reuter's Agency)  to the Greek note announcing the intention of Greece to reoccupy  Epirus:    France declared that she saw no objection to the course proposed by M.  Venizelos's note.    Russia intimated that she would gladly accept whatever decision in the  matter was reached by Great Britain and France.    The British Government accepted M. Venizelos's note.    Germany and Austria-Hungary replied that they accepted the declaration  of the Greek Government that the occupation would not be contrary to  the decisions of the London Conference.    Italy declared that she, for the same purpose as set forth in the  Greek note, namely, the maintenance of order and security, was taking  similar steps at Valona, and that she had adopted this course while  fully respecting the decisions of the powers. She raised no objection  to M. Venizelos's proposal.      ITALIAN OCCUPATION OF AVLONA.    [From the Messaggero of Rome, Dec. 28, 1914.]    AVLONA, Dec. 26.    _The following proclamation addressed to the population was posted  here:_    The grave disorders that become apparent from time to time in this  country have paralyzed commerce, work, and initiative, and are  endangering the life and property of the inhabitants.    The Italian Government, a watchful guardian of Albanian fortunes,  desires that your tranquillity, so cruelly tried, shall be assured.  Invoked by your wishes the marines of Italy are disembarking from the  ships to establish order and defend you.    (Signed) ADMIRAL PATRIS.      THE LAST WORD.    [From the Messaggero of Rome, Jan. 6, 1915.]    DURAZZO, Jan. 4.    Yesterday the rebels by a letter signed \"The Mussulman Committee\"  demanded that the Ministers of Servia and France be consigned to them.    At 6:30 o'clock the attack against the city began.    Essad Pasha visited the trenches, notified the Italian Legation that  there was great danger, and demanded all possible assistance.    At 2:30 a few cannon shots from the Misurata and the Sardegna made  themselves heard, defending the city, silencing in this way the rebel  musket fire.    The Italian colony and the legations of Italy, France, and Servia are  embarked on the ships Sardegna and Misurata.          TO BELGIUM    By EDEN PHILLPOTTS.    [From King Albert's Book.]           Champion of human honor, let us lave         Your feet and bind your wounds on bended knee,       Though coward hands have nailed you to the tree         And shed your innocent blood and dug your grave,       Rejoice and live! Your oriflamme shall wave         While man has power to perish and be free--       A golden flame of holiest liberty,         Proud as the dawn and as the sunset brave.         Belgium, where dwelleth reverence for right         Enthroned above all ideals; where your fate       And your supernal patience and your might         Most sacred grow in human estimate,       You shine a star above this stormy night,         Little no more, but infinitely great.    [Illustration: The Balkan States, After the Second Balkan War.]          The War in the Balkans    General Aspect of the Near East on Aug. 1, 1914.    By Adamantios Th. Polyzoides, Editor The Atlantis.      The opening of the great European war found the Balkan Peninsula in  the political shape given to it by the Treaty of Bucharest, Aug. 10,  (old style, July 28,) 1913.    This treaty was signed in the Rumanian capital immediately after the  second Balkan war by Greece, Rumania, Bulgaria, Servia, and  Montenegro, and, considered in its essential points, was the handiwork  of European diplomacy, at whose instance Rumania had entered the war,  with the avowed purpose to re-establish the destroyed Balkan  equilibrium. Europe had two reasons for interfering in what was then  considered as the final settlement of the Balkan question. In the  first place, she wanted to reaffirm her authority and predominance  over the Balkan States, and, in the second, she considered it as an  indispensable part of her Near Eastern policy never to allow much  freedom of movement on the part of these same States, which in two  successive wars had proved their ability to safeguard and promote  their vital interests in spite of all European opposition. To explain  this course of European diplomacy one must bear in mind that the  Balkan States, since their constitution as such, have always been  considered as proteges of Europe, or, to put it more plainly, as not  being of age, and therefore deprived of the right and privilege to  deal directly with their ancient master, Turkey, in all serious  matters in which their most vital interests were involved.
