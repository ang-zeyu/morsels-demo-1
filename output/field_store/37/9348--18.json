Go!\"    He turned on his heel to reenter his cottage, and a wave of hopelessness  swept over Andre-Louis.    But in a second it was gone. The man must be compelled, and he had the  means. He bethought him of a pistol pressed upon him by Le Chapelier at  the moment of his leaving Rennes, a gift which at the time he had almost  disdained. True, it was not loaded, and he had no ammunition. But how  was Fresnel to know that?    He acted quickly. As with his right hand he pulled it from his pocket,  with his left he caught the ferryman by the shoulder, and swung him  round.    \"What do you want now?\" Fresnel demanded angrily. \"Haven't I told you  that I...\"    He broke off short. The muzzle of the pistol was within a foot of his  eyes.    \"I want the key of the boat. That is all, Fresnel. And you can either  give it me at once, or I'll take it after I have burnt your brains. I  should regret to kill you, but I shall not hesitate. It is your life  against mine, Fresnel; and you'll not find it strange that if one of us  must die I prefer that it shall be you.\"    Fresnel dipped a hand into his pocket, and fetched thence a key. He held  it out to Andre-Louis in fingers that shook--more in anger than in fear.    \"I yield to violence,\" he said, showing his teeth like a snarling dog.  \"But don't imagine that it will greatly profit you.\"    Andre-Louis took the key. His pistol remained levelled.    \"You threaten me, I think,\" he said. \"It is not difficult to read your  threat. The moment I am gone, you will run to inform against me. You  will set the marechaussee on my heels to overtake me.\"    \"No, no!\" cried the other. He perceived his peril. He read his doom in  the cold, sinister note on which Andre-Louis addressed him, and grew  afraid. \"I swear to you, monsieur, that I have no such intention.\"    \"I think I had better make quite sure of you.\"    \"O my God! Have mercy, monsieur!\" The knave was in a palsy of terror. \"I  mean you no harm--I swear to Heaven I mean you no harm. I will not say a  word. I will not...\"    \"I would rather depend upon your silence than your assurances.  Still, you shall have your chance. I am a fool, perhaps, but I have a  reluctance to shed blood. Go into the house, Fresnel. Go, man. I follow  you.\"    In the shabby main room of that dwelling, Andre-Louis halted him again.  \"Get me a length of rope,\" he commanded, and was readily obeyed.    Five minutes later Fresnel was securely bound to a chair, and  effectively silenced by a very uncomfortable gag improvised out of a  block of wood and a muffler.    On the threshold the departing Andre-Louis turned.    \"Good-night, Fresnel,\" he said. Fierce eyes glared mute hatred at him.  \"It is unlikely that your ferry will be required again to-night. But  some one is sure to come to your relief quite early in the morning.  Until then bear your discomfort with what fortitude you can,  remembering that you have brought it entirely upon yourself by your  uncharitableness. If you spend the night considering that, the lesson  should not be lost upon you. By morning you may even have grown so  charitable as not to know who it was that tied you up. Good-night.\"    He stepped out and closed the door.    To unlock the ferry, and pull himself across the swift-running waters,  on which the faint moonlight was making a silver ripple, were matters  that engaged not more than six or seven minutes. He drove the nose of  the boat through the decaying sedges that fringed the southern bank  of the stream, sprang ashore, and made the little craft secure. Then,  missing the footpath in the dark, he struck out across a sodden meadow  in quest of the road.            BOOK II: THE BUSKIN        CHAPTER I. THE TRESPASSERS    Coming presently upon the Redon road, Andre-Louis, obeying instinct  rather than reason, turned his face to the south, and plodded wearily  and mechanically forward. He had no clear idea of whither he was going,  or of whither he should go. All that imported at the moment was to put  as great a distance as possible between Gavrillac and himself.    He had a vague, half-formed notion of returning to Nantes; and there, by  employing the newly found weapon of his oratory, excite the people into  sheltering him as the first victim of the persecution he had foreseen,  and against which he had sworn them to take up arms. But the idea was  one which he entertained merely as an indefinite possibility upon which  he felt no real impulse to act.    Meanwhile he chuckled at the thought of Fresnel as he had last seen him,  with his muffled face and glaring eyeballs. \"For one who was anything  but a man of action,\" he writes, \"I felt that I had acquitted myself  none so badly.\" It is a phrase that recurs at intervals in his sketchy  \"Confessions.\" Constantly is he reminding you that he is a man of mental  and not physical activities, and apologizing when dire necessity  drives him into acts of violence. I suspect this insistence upon  his philosophic detachment--for which I confess he had justification  enough--to betray his besetting vanity.    With increasing fatigue came depression and self-criticism. He had  stupidly overshot his mark in insultingly denouncing M. de Lesdiguieres.  \"It is much better,\" he says somewhere, \"to be wicked than to be stupid.  Most of this world's misery is the fruit not as priests tell us of  wickedness, but of stupidity.\" And we know that of all stupidities he  considered anger the most deplorable. Yet he had permitted himself to  be angry with a creature like M. de Lesdiguieres--a lackey, a fribble,  a nothing, despite his potentialities for evil. He could perfectly have  discharged his self-imposed mission without arousing the vindictive  resentment of the King's Lieutenant.    He beheld himself vaguely launched upon life with the riding-suit in  which he stood, a single louis d'or and a few pieces of silver for all  capital, and a knowledge of law which had been inadequate to preserve  him from the consequences of infringing it.    He had, in addition--but these things that were to be the real salvation  of him he did not reckon--his gift of laughter, sadly repressed of late,  and the philosophic outlook and mercurial temperament which are the  stock-in-trade of your adventurer in all ages.    Meanwhile he tramped mechanically on through the night, until he felt  that he could tramp no more. He had skirted the little township of  Guichen, and now within a half-mile of Guignen, and with Gavrillac a  good seven miles behind him, his legs refused to carry him any farther.    He was midway across the vast common to the north of Guignen when  he came to a halt. He had left the road, and taken heedlessly to  the footpath that struck across the waste of indifferent pasture  interspersed with clumps of gorse. A stone's throw away on his right the  common was bordered by a thorn hedge. Beyond this loomed a tall building  which he knew to be an open barn, standing on the edge of a long stretch  of meadowland. That dark, silent shadow it may have been that had  brought him to a standstill, suggesting shelter to his subconsciousness.  A moment he hesitated; then he struck across towards a spot where a gap  in the hedge was closed by a five-barred gate. He pushed the gate open,  went through the gap, and stood now before the barn. It was as big as  a house, yet consisted of no more than a roof carried upon half a dozen  tall, brick pillars. But densely packed under that roof was a great  stack of hay that promised a warm couch on so cold a night. Stout  timbers had been built into the brick pillars, with projecting ends to  serve as ladders by which the labourer might climb to pack or withdraw  hay. With what little strength remained him, Andre-Louis climbed by one  of these and landed safely at the top, where he was forced to kneel, for  lack of room to stand upright. Arrived there, he removed his coat and  neckcloth, his sodden boots and stockings. Next he cleared a trough for  his body, and lying down in it, covered himself to the neck with the hay  he had removed. Within five minutes he was lost to all worldly cares and  soundly asleep.    When next he awakened, the sun was already high in the heavens, from  which he concluded that the morning was well advanced; and this before  he realized quite where he was or how he came there. Then to his  awakening senses came a drone of voices close at hand, to which at first  he paid little heed. He was deliciously refreshed, luxuriously drowsy  and luxuriously warm.    But as consciousness and memory grew more full, he raised his head clear  of the hay that he might free both ears to listen, his pulses faintly  quickened by the nascent fear that those voices might bode him no good.  Then he caught the reassuring accents of a woman, musical and silvery,  though laden with alarm.    \"Ah, mon Dieu, Leandre, let us separate at once. If it should be my  father...\"    And upon this a man's voice broke in, calm and reassuring:    \"No, no, Climene; you are mistaken. There is no one coming. We are quite  safe. Why do you start at shadows?\"    \"Ah, Leandre, if he should find us here together! I tremble at the very  thought.\"    More was not needed to reassure Andre-Louis. He had overheard enough to  know that this was but the case of a pair of lovers who, with less to  fear of life, were yet--after the manner of their kind--more timid of  heart than he. Curiosity drew him from his warm trough to the edge of  the hay. Lying prone, he advanced his head and peered down.    In the space of cropped meadow between the barn and the hedge stood a  man and a woman, both young. The man was a well-set-up, comely fellow,  with a fine head of chestnut hair tied in a queue by a broad bow of  black satin. He was dressed with certain tawdry attempts at ostentatious  embellishments, which did not prepossess one at first glance in his  favour. His coat of a fashionable cut was of faded plum-coloured velvet  edged with"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/19487"],[0,"Bell's Cathedrals: The Cathedral Church of Hereford (#16)"],[1," much learning and ability.  During his episcopate, according to William of Malmsbury, the cathedral  was rebuilt after the pattern of Charlemagne's church at Aix-la-Chapelle.  In his time also Walter de Lacy built the Church of St. Peter at Hereford.  He was a keen man of business, and it has been suggested that he was open  to bribery, but this accusation is hardly compatible with his intimate  companionship with the high-minded Wulstan, Bishop of Worcester, the date  of whose death, January 19, 1095, is included in the calendar of the  Hereford Service-Book.      [Illustration: A GARGOYLE IN THE CLOISTERS. DRAWN BY A. HUGH FISHER.]              A GARGOYLE IN THE CLOISTERS. DRAWN BY A. HUGH FISHER.      *Gerard*, A.D. 1096-1101. Three days after the body of William Rufus had  been brought from the forest to Winchester by Purkiss, the charcoal  burner, Gerard, who was the Bishop of Winchester's nephew, assisted at the  coronation of Henry I., for which service it was said he was promised the  first vacant archiepiscopal see. The King tried to evade the bargain a few  years later by promising to increase the Hereford income to the value of  that at York, but Gerard carried the day and obtained his promotion.    *Reynelm*, A.D. 1107-1115, Chancellor to Queen Matilda; he resigned his  appointment as soon as it was conferred, on account of the King's quarrel  with Anselm on the question of investiture, was banished for six years,  and was only consecrated in 1107. He is said to have been the founder of  the hospital of St. Ethelbert, and continued the work in the Cathedral  begun by Robert de Losinga. He regulated the establishment of prebendaries  and canons living under a rule.    *Geoffrey de Clive*, A.D. 1115-1119. During the latter years of this  episcopate, a question of jurisdiction over the districts of Ergyng and  Ewias, which had begun in the previous century, was revived between the  Bishop of Llandaff and the Bishops of Hereford and St. David's.    *Richard de Capella*, A.D. 1120-1127, King's chaplain and keeper of the  Great Seal under the Chancellor. He helped to build at Hereford a bridge  over the Wye.    During his episcopate the Royal Charter was granted for the annual holding  of a three days' fair (increased to nine days later) commencing on the  evening of the 19th of May, called St. Ethelbert's Day.    Nine-tenths of the profits of this fair went to the Bishop and the rest to  the Canons of the Cathedral. The bishop's bailiff held a court within the  palace precincts, with pillory and stocks. The bishop also had a gaol for  the incarceration of offenders against his rights during fair-time.    Tolls were levied at each gate of the city. The suspension of civic  authority during fair-time was for centuries a source of frequent  quarrels. As late as the eighteenth century a ballad-singer was punished  by the bishop's officers.    The wreck of the \"White Ship\" occurred during this episcopate (Nov. 25th,  1120), and one of the victims was Geoffrey, Archdeacon of Hereford.    *Robert de Bethune*, A.D. 1131-1148, had become prior of his monastery at  his native place of Bethune, in French Flanders, and thence had gone to  Llanthony, a priory in a glen of the Hatteral Hills in the disputed  district of Ewias.    When later on the country was torn and despoiled with the bitter struggle  for the Crown, Bishop Robert, who was a personal friend of Henry, Bishop  of Winchester, the King's brother, sided with Stephen.    Hereford was seized near the beginning of the campaign by Geoffrey de  Talebot, and held by him for four or five weeks for the Empress Matilda.  It was then captured by Stephen, and the victory celebrated in the  cathedral on Whitsunday (A.D. 1138), when the King attended mass wearing  his crown, and seated, it is said, in the old chair described in an  earlier chapter.    In 1139, the Empress's army again attacked Hereford, and seizing the  cathedral, drove out the clergy, fortified it, and used it as a vantage  ground from which to attack the castle. The tower was used as a platform,  from which missiles were thrown, and the nave as a stable; while a trench  and rampart was carried across the graveyard.    Bishop Robert was present at Winchester when the Empress was accepted  there by the clergy, and returned thence to Hereford to purify the  cathedral. He died at Chalons of a disease contracted while attending a  council of Pope Eugenius III.    The Pope decided that his body should be taken to Hereford, and it was  enclosed in the hide of an ox for the journey. Both at Canterbury and at  London were great demonstrations of grief, which were again repeated at  Ross, and on a still larger scale at Hereford. Bishop Robert was  undoubtedly a great man, and his reputation for fine character, bravery,  and ability was well deserved.    *Gilbert Foliot*, A.D. 1148-1163, the next Bishop, had been consecrated as  Abbot of St. Peter's, Gloucester, by Bishop Robert, with whom he had  contracted an early friendship as far back as 1139.    On the death of Bishop Robert, he was consecrated at St. Omer. He assisted  at the consecration of Becket at Canterbury, and the next year was  transferred to the See of London. He was followed by *Robert of Maledon*,  A.D. 1163-1168, said to have been remarkably wise.    Amongst his pupils he numbered John of Salisbury. He attended the council  of Clarendon, A.D. 1162, and in 1164 was present at the meeting at  Northampton between Becket and the King.    Such was the fury and importance of the Becket controversy that even  distant Hereford was entangled with it. Two Hereford Bishops took part in  the quarrel, and it was through this that the see continued vacant for six  years after Bishop Robert's death.    Notwithstanding the rigorous order of Henry VIII., A.D. 1538, for the  destruction of all images and pictures of Bishop Becket, there still  existed in the cathedral, till late in the seventeenth century, a wall  painting of the Archbishop, and even yet in the north-east transept there  remains a figure of him in one of the windows in good preservation. The  enamelled chasse or reliquary, with scenes of Becket's murder and  entombment, and its dark but doubtful stain, has already been described  among the treasures of the cathedral.    Some four miles from Hereford is yet another memorial still remaining in a  well-preserved window of painted glass at Credenhill, a part of which  represents the murdered Becket. Lastly, the festival of the translation of  St. Thomas of Canterbury, July 7, is still included in the cathedral  calendar.    *Robert Foliot*, A.D. 1174-1186, had been a friend of Becket's, and may  have had some share in his education.    *William de Vere*, A.D. 1186-1199, removed the apsidal termination at the  east end of the cathedral, and is said to have erected chapels, since  replaced by the Lady Chapel and its vestibule.    *Giles de Braose*, A.D. 1200-1215, a stubborn opponent of King John.    *Hugh de Mapenor*, A.D. 1216-1219, received his appointment by the  influence of the papal legate, who, after King John's submission, claimed  the right of nomination to all vacant sees and benefices.    *Hugh Foliot*, A.D. 1219-1234, founded the Hospital of St. Katherine at  Ledbury, in which still hangs a portrait of him, painted from an older  picture. A tooth of St. Ethelbert was presented to the cathedral during  his episcopacy. He endowed the Chapels of St. Mary Magdalene and St.  Katherine, in the ancient building adjoining the Bishop's palace,  destroyed in the eighteenth century.    *Ralph de Maydenstan*, A.D. 1234-1239, presented to the see a house in  Fish Street Hill, London, as a residence for the bishops when in the  metropolis. He also made various gifts to the cathedral, the chapter, and  the college of vicars choral. This Bishop was one of the commissioners to  settle the marriage of Henry III. with Eleanor of Provence.    *Peter of Savoy (Aquablanca)*, A.D. 1240-1268, a native of Aqua Bella,  near Chambery, whose appointment was an instance of the preference Henry  III. showed for foreigners. One of the most unpopular men in England; he  was hand in glove with the weak-minded, waxen-hearted King in schemes for  money getting.    Bishop Aquablanca probably built the graceful north-west transept of the  cathedral, containing the shrine under which lie the remains of his  nephew, a Dean of Hereford, together with his own, except the heart. This  was carried, as he had requested it should be, to the church he had  founded in his native place.    *John de Breton*, or Bruton, A.D. 1268-1275.    *Thomas de Cantilupe*, A.D. 1275-1282. Born A.D. 1220, he showed, as a  child, unusual religious zeal, was educated at Oxford and Paris, and for  some years filled the office of Chancellor of England at the choice of the  barons. This post he lost on the death of Simon de Montfort. When he was  elected by the Chapter of Hereford to fill the episcopal chair on De  Breton's death he was only persuaded to accept it with difficulty.    Bishop Cantilupe was renowned for his extreme piety and devotional habits.  In a dispute concerning the chace of Colwall, near Malvern Forest, from  which was derived the Bishop's supply of game, he maintained successfully  the episcopal rights. He was also triumphant in a more important quarrel  with the Welsh King Llewellyn about the wrongful appropriation of three  manors.    When Lord Clifford was in trouble for plundering his cattle and  maltreating his tenants, Bishop Cantilupe inflicted personal chastisement  upon him with a rod in the cathedral. The clergy no less than laymen did  he subdue, appealing when necessary to the Pope.    In a quarrel arising out of a matrimonial case, in which the defendant  appealed to Canterbury against a sentence of the sub-dean of Hereford, he  was at last excommunicated by the Archbishop for refusing to go to discuss  the affair with him at Lambeth. At Rome he obtained a"]]]
