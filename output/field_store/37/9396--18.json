[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/20470"],[0,"Etiquette (#16)"],[1,"  For right here is another point: that people think it is \"cute\" for a  _little_ child to say and do things that in a child a few years older  would be most unattractively rude.  But they must reflect that this  same cute little child will soon be a few years older, and will carry  into that riper age the fixed habits that are forming now; and it will  not be so easy a task to transform the child's manners as it is to  dress him in a larger suit of clothes.    A choice rose was grafted upon a wild, thorny stock, and planted beside  a veranda trellis.  The owner watched it carefully for a year or so,  cutting down the rank shoots of the wild stock as they sprang  aggressively from the root, allowing the grafted branch to grow in full  luxuriance, bearing carmine clusters that filled the garden with spicy  odor.  The next spring an ignorant gardener pruned away the branches,  cutting down the slenderest and leaving what to his unpracticed eye  were the most desirable, because the thriftiest, shoots; and when the  time of blossoms came, nothing appeared but the ragged petals of the  wild thorn.    So, in \"the rosebud garden of girls\"--or boys.  If the choice graft of  cultured manners (for it _is_ a graft on the sturdy but wayward stock  of human nature) is left to be choked out by the rank, wild growth of  impulse, or if by some flagrant error in example and discipline it is  practically cut down at the main branch, what can the careless trainer  expect?  He may weep to find no velvet-petaled rose when he comes to  look for it; but he has no right to blame the rose-bush, nor can he, at  this late day, hide the tact of his blundering pruning by righteously  affirming that he is \"perfectly astonished.\"  His neighbors, who have  quietly noted the methods pursued in his kindergarten, are not in the  least surprised.    Another resource for escaping blame is that of explaining that the  children \"learn these things at school.\"  Presumably they do not mean  from the teachers.  It is \"from the other children,\" who seem to be a  most injurious class of society.  It is their influence which makes  _our_ children so rude and so ungrammatical; and, strangely enough,  though these other children never dine with our children, so subtle and  far-reaching is their baleful influence that our children's defective  manners at the table are directly traceable to the same evil source.    Granted, a measure of truth in the charge; for large mirthfulness and  large imitation lead children to do things \"just for fun,\" which all  the time they know better than to persist in.  But, as a fact,  demonstrated by observation, a very small percentage of the children  who are habituated to correct behavior at home are ever seriously  affected by outside influences.  A superficial effect may show in  little things; but such lapses of speech or manner are transient, and  in no degree control the development of the child when his home  training is irreproachable.  On the other hand, the efforts of an  untiring teacher, laboring five hours a day to teach correct language  and enunciation, may be of little permanent value, when the remaining  hours of the day are spent in a home where the English grammar hourly  meets a violent death.    And what is true of grammar is equally true of morals and manners.  The  school and society may be measurably influential; but the home casts  the deciding vote.  And when people note the manners--good or bad--of  your boys and girls, they do not ask, \"What school do they attend?\"  \"What children do they associate with?\" but, \"_Whose children are  they?_\"    Would you have them mannerly?  Teach them; by precept, certainly; but  above all things, by example.          SOCIAL YOUNG AMERICA    Henry the Fifth, of England, disposed of certain troublesome  restrictions of etiquette by remarking that \"nice customs curtsey to  great kings:\" but in the twentieth century, customs are more likely to  curtsey to the common sense of the community at large.    City codes and country customs present some contradictious.  The exact  rules of etiquette in social formalities, which are derived from the  established usage of fashionable circles in the city, are constantly  subject to modifications when they are applied under the conditions  found in rural neighborhoods.  This is plainly illustrated in the  comminglings of social \"Young America.\"  Whereas the city-bred girl is  carefully chaperoned, the village girl of equal social standing,  intrinsically speaking, is accustomed to go about unconcernedly, either  alone or under the escort of some youth, with whom she makes  engagements to drive, or walk, or row, or attend picnics, without  either of them, as a rule, thinking it necessary to ask her mother to  join them, or even to give her permission, that being taken for  granted, since it has probably never been denied.  And the question  naturally arises, Why _should_ it be denied, when the young man is a  trusted chum of her brother, and as safe an escort for her as her own  father would be?  It is a very different case from the similar instance  in the city, where the gallant is a comparative stranger, who may or  may not be reliable, and where a conventional world is coldly looking  on.    But, moreover, if this young country girl chooses, she goes alone to a  little evening party a few doors away, or to the evening \"meeting\" at  the village church, and this same youth, or some other one, escorts her  home in an impromptu fashion.  The young lady probably invites him into  the house, if the hour is early and the family are still circled about  the parlor lamp.  Or, if it is late, she does not ask him in, but  invites him to call.  She does not thank him for his escort, unless it  has been given at obvious inconvenience to himself or others, and is  therefore not so much a matter of gallantry as of neighborly  accommodation.  In the latter case she does thank him frankly for his  trouble.    When the young man calls to see her, she receives him with or without  the presence of her mother or other members of the family.  She may  invite him to tea, with her mother's serene but passive approval; and,  in fact, the goings and comings of these young people are more like the  comradery of two girls than like the formal association of a young man  and young woman in society.    We are accustomed to call such a code a country code, because of its  almost universal following in small towns and villages.  But similar  freedom of association is also observed in city circles outside of the  exclusive bounds of fashionable life.  Indeed, some of the fashions  called \"countryfied\" are equally \"cityfied,\" if we judge by the extent  of the usage.  But what has been quite safe and sensible and refined in  the particular instance in the country, may be a most unsafe freedom in  the city, where every circle is constantly being invaded, more or less,  by new-comers and by a floating contingent of transient people, whose  record is not known even to the people who introduce them.  The frank  friendliness that is usually good form in the village circle is usually  a great mistake in the city.  It is better that young ladies, whether  nominally chaperoned or not, should be guarded against making  acquaintances too readily, especially among young men.  If a young man  is deserving of social recognition, let the young lady's mother grant  it to him by inviting him to her house and permitting his association  with her own young people.    A young girl should not extend these invitations to call unless she is  well acquainted with the young man, or unless she gives the invitation  in her mother's name, and with the understanding that he will be  received by her mother as well as herself.  Usually, the mother should  be the one to extend the hospitality.    In the case of an unmarried woman who is no longer young, it is  presumed that discretion will guide her as to when it is dignified and  proper to give invitations to call, the conservative side being the  safe side where strangers are concerned.    The ideal condition of Americanized chaperonage is far from being  realized in the great mass of American society.  A small and exclusive  circle observes the English code in this matter; the rest of society  ignore the whole idea--as an idea--though the thoughtful mother  instinctively guards her daughter in a desultory way, perhaps meeting  the spirit of the idea in the main, but flagrantly disregarding the  letter of the formal code.  The two extremes we have; but a real,  systematic code of chaperonage that is not French, nor English, nor  Spanish, but wholesome, sensible, thorough-going American _mother's_  guardianship we are yet to see definitely carried out.  The occasional  instance of it which we now and then observe has taught us to  appreciate what would be the happiest development in our social life,  if once attained.    Meanwhile, the average American girl will probably continue to shine as  the startling exception to the rule; and in her remarkable escapes from  serious blunders, will continue to bear the palm for self-command and  good sense.  Her ability to ignore a law, while consciously cherishing  all that the law was devised to protect, is a flattering indication of  her mental and moral integrity.  Even a dull-witted person can follow a  set rule; it requires some genius to make a legitimate exception, and  it also involves some temerity.  It is like gathering mushrooms;  perhaps they are edible, perhaps they are poisonous; for the various  fungi look very much alike.  If it happens to be right, it is right; if  it happens to be wrong, it is sheer disaster.    A social code that borrows no artifice from foreign lands and  institutions, but which, true to the spirit of our own country, guards  the liberty of young girls on the one hand, while on the other it  shields them from license, will be welcomed by all thoughtful people."]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/20472"],[0,"Grace Harlowe's Plebe Year at High School (#16)"],[1," shortly, so shortly that Grace  flushed. Perhaps he was angry with her for having spoken out to Miriam.    \"I hope you aren't hurt much, David,\" said Miriam.    David made no reply.    \"David,\" she repeated in a louder voice.    But her brother had started down the hill, his hands in his pockets.  Nobody took much notice of Miriam as the young people followed after  him. Reddy Brooks was secretly congratulating himself that he hadn't  been riding behind her on the sled as she had wished, insisting that she  wanted to do the guiding herself. It was curious, he thought, and might  have resulted in a serious accident, at least to Anne if David hadn't  pulled her away. If Miriam had only thought to throw herself to the  right when she saw Anne in the way. Girls had no heads, anyway, that is,  most girls. Grace, he decided, was almost equal to a man for coolness  and good judgment. But there were few girls who could touch Grace  Harlowe; and he did a series of cartwheels in the snow to emphasize his  feelings, to the relief of everybody present, for the silence was  becoming uncomfortable.    \"Nora,\" said Anne when they had reached town, \"if you'll excuse me I  think I'll go home. I'm a little tired.\"    \"I'll take you home, Anne,\" said David, who had heard her remark. \"I  don't feel much like partifying either after this jolt. Come along,  little girl,\" and he tucked Anne's arm in his and marched her off  without another word.    \"All my party is leaving before the party,\" cried Nora in despair.    \"No, not all,\" replied Hippy Wingate. \"There are still a few of us left,  and I promise to drink any extra chocolate you may happen to have.\"    \"Don't give the animals sweets, Nora,\" exclaimed Reddy. \"Especially the  hippopotamus. He has a delicate stomach. You see, his keeper used to  feed him chocolate drops three times a day.\"    Hippy grinned good-naturedly. He was a round roly-poly boy, famous for  his appetite.    \"Get away from here, Red Curls,\" he cried, hitting Reddy in the back  with a snowball.    \"Oh, you coward,\" cried Reddy, talking in a high falsetto voice, \"to hit  a man when his back is turned. I'll slap you for that,\" and he landed a  snowball on Hippy's chest.    Hippy crouched behind the girls.    \"I was a fool to throw at a pitcher,\" he cried; \"he'll be sending me one  of his curves in a minute.\"    \"Hiding behind the ladies, hey?\" returned Reddy, beginning to pitch  snowballs at the girls.    \"Let's wash his face,\" cried Nora to the other boys and girls coming up  just then. They chased Reddy all the way to Nora's house and rolled him  in the snow until he cried \"enough.\"    Once inside Nora's cozy home, the coasters were soon doing ample justice  to the good things to eat, which Nora's sister had prepared for them.  Although all three of Anne's chums regretted deeply the unpleasant  affair on the hill it was not mentioned again during the evening. Still,  each girl felt in her heart that poor little Anne had, in Miriam Nesbit,  a dangerous enemy.          CHAPTER XIII    CHRISTMAS HOLIDAYS      \"Here's the tack-hammer, Hippy, and don't fall off the ladder, please,\"  cautioned Grace, as she assisted Hippy Wingate to tack up an evergreen  garland in Mrs. Gray's drawing room.    Not in twenty years had the old house taken on such holiday attire.  Great bunches of holly and cedar filled the vases and bowls and  decorated the chandeliers. Fires blazed on every hearth and the warm  glow from many candles and shaded lamps brightened the fine old rooms.    \"My dear young people,\" exclaimed Mrs. Gray, coming in just then, \"how  happy you make me feel! I do wish you were all really my children and  could forever stay just the ages you are now.\"    \"This house would be like the palace of everlasting youth, then,  wouldn't it, Mrs. Gray?\" suggested Anne.    \"Until some meddlesome little Pandora came along, opened the box and let  all the troubles out,\" interposed David, who was still feeling very  bitter toward his sister Miriam, and glad to leave home for a time until  his anger had cooled.    \"Ah, well, we have no Pandoras here,\" answered Mrs. Gray, smiling on the  young guests. \"You are all girls and boys after my own heart, and I  trust we shall have a beautiful time together. But here comes that  nephew of mine, Tom Gray. I wonder if he's grown out of all  recollection.\"    While she was speaking one of the town hacks had driven up to the steps,  and there was a violent ring at the bell.    \"Mr. Thomas Gray,\" announced the old butler at the door and Tom Gray,  who had been the subject of endless speculation and conjecture, entered  the room.    \"If he turns out to be disagreeable or stupid or anything,\" the girls  had been whispering, \"it would be such a pity because everybody else is  so nice.\"    Neither had the boys felt inclined to be prepossessed in Tom Gray's  favor. He was a stranger, from New York, older than themselves and in  college.    \"I wish he wasn't going to butt in with his city manners,\" Reddy Brooks  was thinking regretfully. \"He is sure to have a swelled head and try to  boss the crowd.\"    They had pictured him as a sort of dandy, with needle-toed patent  leather shoes and a coat cut in at the waist and padded over the  shoulders.    Even David had voiced a few thoughts on the subject of Tom Gray.    \"I'll bet he's an English dude,\" he said. For Mrs. Gray's nephew had  spent most of his life in England. \"He'll probably carry a cane and wear  a monocle.\"    They were not surprised, therefore, when a young man entered the room  who bore out somewhat the picture they had conjured. He was tall and  slender, very dapper and rather ladylike in his bearing. His alert, dark  eyes were set too close together, and his face had a narrow, sinister  look that made them all feel uncomfortable. He spoke with a decided  English accent, in a light, flippant voice which sent a quiver of  dislike up and down David's spine, and made Reddy Brooks give his right  arm a vigorous twirl as if he would have liked to pitch something at the  young man's head.    Mrs. Gray was the most surprised person in the room. It must be  remembered that she had not seen her nephew since he was a child, and  she had hoped for better things than this. However, always the most  courteous and loyal of souls, she now made the best of the situation and  greeted the newcomer cordially, though she did not bestow upon him the  motherly kiss she had been saving.    Tom Gray bowed low over his aunt's hand.    \"You are so much changed, Tom; I should hardly have known you,\"  exclaimed the old lady, trying to conceal her disappointment and dismay.  \"England has weaned you away from your own country. You look as if you  had just stepped out of Piccadilly.\"    \"And so I have, aunt,\" replied the young man, using a very broad \"a.\" \"I  have been in this country only a few months. England is the only place  in the world for me, you know. I can't bear America.\"    Hippy Wingate gave himself an angry shake, which made all the ornaments  on the mantelpiece rattle ominously.    \"You must let me introduce you to my young friends, Tom,\" said Mrs.  Gray, changing the subject quickly.    The introductions having been accomplished, she took his arm and led the  way back to dinner.    \"Do you think we can stand him for a week?\" whispered David to Grace, as  they followed down the hall.    \"We'll have to,\" replied Grace, \"or hurt Mrs. Gray's feelings. But isn't  he the limit?\"    \"Asinine dandy!\" hissed Hippy.    \"I knew he'd be a Miss Nancy,\" exclaimed Reddy.    The girls did not express their disappointment, but as the meal  progressed the conversation was strained and stupid.    \"How did you leave your cousins in England, Tom?\" asked Mrs. Gray,  trying to keep the ball rolling and inwardly wishing she had never asked  her nephew down.    \"Quite well, thank you, aunt,\" replied Thomas Gray. \"I expect to leave  this beastly country and join them very soon.\"    \"Indeed?\" answered Mrs. Gray, flushing and with difficulty keeping back  the tears of disappointment. To think a nephew of hers could have turned  out like this!    \"Do you play football?\" demanded Hippy abruptly.    \"Really, I don't care for the game,\" answered Thomas. \"It's awfully  rough, don't you know.\"    \"Perhaps you prefer baseball?\" suggested Grace.    \"No,\" continued the young man, \"I can't say I do. The truth is, I don't  like outdoor games at all.\"    \"What do you like, then?\" demanded Nora, giving him a glance of  ineffable scorn.    \"I like afternoon tea,\" he answered, \"and bridge.\"    Reddy almost groaned aloud, but he remembered his manners and choked his  outburst of disgust.    \"It is a pity,\" said Tom's aunt, turning her nearsighted blue eyes on  him in amazement and displeasure. \"Our Oakdale boys are all athletes.  Even David here, the scholar and inventor, I'll venture to say, knows  football and baseball as well as his friends.\"    \"I'm not much of an inventor, Mrs. Gray,\" protested David. \"You know my  airship tumbled down before it got half way across the gym. But I shall  never lose hope.\"    \"Ah, airships?\" exclaimed Thomas Gray, and deliberately taking a monocle  from his pocket, he stuck it in his eye and stared at David, who choked  and sputtered in his glass of water, while Hippy dropped a fork that  fell on his plate with a great clatter.    Mrs. Gray raised her lorgnette and looked at her nephew.    \"Thomas,\" she said sternly, \"don't wear that thing here. It's not the  custom in this town or in this country, for that matter. If you are  nearsighted, buy yourself a pair of spectacles.\"    \"Certainly, aunt, certainly; it shall be as you wish,\" replied Thomas,  without a tinge of embarrassment. \"I am so unused to America, you know.\"    Then Nora relieved the painful situation by laughing. She was taken with  the giggles and she laughed till the tears rolled down her cheeks. The  others laughed, too, even Mrs. Gray, who felt that she might give way to  hysterics at"]]]
