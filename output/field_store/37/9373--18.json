[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/19950"],[0,"Summa Theologica, Part III (Tertia Pars) (#16)"],[1,"said above, there is wanting the fitness of need, because, although  the angelic nature in some is the subject of sin, their sin is  irremediable, as stated above (I, Q. 64, A. 2).    Reply Obj. 4: The perfection of the universe is not the perfection of  one person or suppositum, but of something which is one by position  or order, whereof very many parts are not capable of assumption, as  was said above. Hence it follows that only human nature is capable of  being assumed.  _______________________    SECOND ARTICLE [III, Q. 4, Art. 2]    Whether the Son of God Assumed a Person?    Objection 1: It would seem that the Son of God assumed a person. For  Damascene says (De Fide Orth. iii, 11) that the Son of God \"assumed  human nature _in atomo,\"_ i.e. in an individual. But an individual in  rational nature is a person, as is plain from Boethius (De Duab.  Nat.). Therefore the Son of God assumed a person.    Obj. 2: Further, Damascene says (De Fide Orth. iii, 6) that the Son  of God \"assumed what He had sown in our nature.\" But He sowed our  personality there. Therefore the Son of God assumed a person.    Obj. 3: Further, nothing is absorbed unless it exist. But Innocent  III [*Paschas. Diac., De Spiritu Sanct. ii] says in a Decretal that  \"the Person of God absorbed the person of man.\" Therefore it would  seem that the person of man existed previous to its being assumed.    _On the contrary,_ Augustine [*Fulgentius] says (De Fide ad Petrum  ii) that \"God assumed the nature, not the person, of man.\"    _I answer that,_ A thing is said to be assumed inasmuch as it is  taken into another. Hence, what is assumed must be presupposed to the  assumption, as what is moved locally is presupposed to the motion.  Now a person in human nature is not presupposed to assumption;  rather, it is the term of the assumption, as was said (Q. 3, AA. 1,  2). For if it were presupposed, it must either have been  corrupted--in which case it was useless; or it remains after the  union--and thus there would be two persons, one assuming and the  other assumed, which is false, as was shown above (Q. 2, A. 6). Hence  it follows that the Son of God nowise assumed a human person.    Reply Obj. 1: The Son of God assumed human nature _in atomo,_ i.e. in  an individual, which is no other than the uncreated suppositum, the  Person of the Son of God. Hence it does not follow that a person was  assumed.    Reply Obj. 2: Its proper personality is not wanting to the nature  assumed through the loss of anything pertaining to the perfection of  the human nature but through the addition of something which is above  human nature, viz. the union with a Divine Person.    Reply Obj. 3: Absorption does not here imply the destruction of  anything pre-existing, but the hindering what might otherwise have  been. For if the human nature had not been assumed by a Divine  Person, the human nature would have had its own personality; and in  this way is it said, although improperly, that the Person \"absorbed  the person,\" inasmuch as the Divine Person by His union hindered the  human nature from having its personality.  _______________________    THIRD ARTICLE [III, Q. 4, Art. 3]    Whether the Divine Person Assumed a Man?    Objection 1: It would seem that the Divine Person assumed a man. For  it is written (Ps. 64:5): \"Blessed is he whom Thou hast chosen and  taken to Thee,\" which a gloss expounds of Christ; and Augustine says  (De Agone Christ. xi): \"The Son of God assumed a man, and in him bore  things human.\"    Obj. 2: Further, the word \"man\" signifies a human nature. But the Son  of God assumed a human nature. Therefore He assumed a man.    Obj. 3: Further, the Son of God is a man. But He is not one of the  men He did not assume, for with equal reason He would be Peter or any  other man. Therefore He is the man whom He assumed.    _On the contrary,_ Is the authority of Felix, Pope and Martyr, which  is quoted by the Council of Ephesus: \"We believe in our Lord Jesus  Christ, born of the Virgin Mary, because He is the Eternal Son and  Word of God, and not a man assumed by God, in such sort that there is  another besides Him. For the Son of God did not assume a man, so that  there be another besides Him.\"    _I answer that,_ As has been said above (A. 2), what is assumed is  not the term of the assumption, but is presupposed to the assumption.  Now it was said (Q. 3, AA. 1, 2) that the individual to Whom the  human nature is assumed is none other than the Divine Person, Who is  the term of the assumption. Now this word \"man\" signifies human  nature, as it is in a suppositum, because, as Damascene says (De Fide  Orth. iii, 4, 11), this word God signifies Him Who has human nature.  And hence it cannot properly be said that the Son assumed a man,  granted (as it must be, in fact) that in Christ there is but one  suppositum and one hypostasis. But according to such as hold that  there are two hypostases or two supposita in Christ, it may fittingly  and properly be said that the Son of God assumed a man. Hence the  first opinion quoted in Sent. iii, D. 6, grants that a man was  assumed. But this opinion is erroneous, as was said above (Q. 2, A.  6).    Reply Obj. 1: These phrases are not to be taken too literally, but  are to be loyally explained, wherever they are used by holy doctors;  so as to say that a man was assumed, inasmuch as his nature was  assumed; and because the assumption terminated in this--that the Son  of God is man.    Reply Obj. 2: The word \"man\" signifies human nature in the concrete,  inasmuch as it is in a suppositum; and hence, since we cannot say a  suppositum was assumed, so we cannot say a man was assumed.    Reply Obj. 3: The Son of God is not the man whom He assumed, but the  man whose nature He assumed.  _______________________    FOURTH ARTICLE [III, Q. 4, Art. 4]    Whether the Son of God Ought to Have Assumed Human Nature Abstracted  from All Individuals?    Objection 1: It would seem that the Son of God ought to have assumed  human nature abstracted from all individuals. For the assumption of  human nature took place for the common salvation of all men; hence it  is said of Christ (1 Tim. 4:10) that He is \"the Saviour of all men,  especially of the faithful.\" But nature as it is in individuals  withdraws from its universality. Therefore the Son of God ought to  have assumed human nature as it is abstracted from all individuals.    Obj. 2: Further, what is noblest in all things ought to be attributed  to God. But in every genus what is of itself is best. Therefore the  Son of God ought to have assumed self-existing (_per se_) man, which,  according to Platonists, is human nature abstracted from its  individuals. Therefore the Son of God ought to have assumed this.    Obj. 3: Further, human nature was not assumed by the Son of God in  the concrete as is signified by the word \"man,\" as was said above (A.  3). Now in this way it signifies human nature as it is in  individuals, as is plain from what has been said (A. 3). Therefore  the Son of God assumed human nature as it is separated from  individuals.    _On the contrary,_ Damascene says (De Fide Orth. iii, 11): \"God the  Word Incarnate did not assume a nature which exists in pure thought;  for this would have been no Incarnation, but a false and fictitious  Incarnation.\" But human nature as it is separated or abstracted from  individuals is \"taken to be a pure conception, since it does not  exist in itself,\" as Damascene says (De Fide Orth. iii, 11).  Therefore the Son of God did not assume human nature, as it is  separated from individuals.    _I answer that,_ The nature of man or of any other sensible thing,  beyond the being which it has in individuals, may be taken in two  ways: first, as if it had being of itself, away from matter, as the  Platonists held; secondly, as existing in an intellect either human  or Divine. Now it cannot subsist of itself, as the Philosopher proves  (Metaph. vii, 26, 27, 29, 51), because sensible matter belongs to the  specific nature of sensible things, and is placed in its definition,  as flesh and bones in the definition of man. Hence human nature  cannot be without sensible matter. Nevertheless, if human nature were  subsistent in this way, it would not be fitting that it should be  assumed by the Word of God. First, because this assumption is  terminated in a Person, and it is contrary to the nature of a common  form to be thus individualized in a person. Secondly, because to a  common nature can only be attributed common and universal operations,  according to which man neither merits nor demerits, whereas, on the  contrary, the assumption took place in order that the Son of God,  having assumed our nature, might merit for us. Thirdly, because a  nature so existing would not be sensible, but intelligible. But the  Son of God assumed human nature in order to show Himself in men's  sight, according to Baruch 3:38: \"Afterwards He was seen upon earth,  and conversed with men.\"    Likewise, neither could human nature have been assumed by the Son of  God, as it is in the Divine intellect, since it would be none other  than the Divine Nature; and, according to this, human nature would be  in the Son of God from eternity. Neither can we say that the Son of  God assumed human nature as it is in a human intellect, for this  would mean nothing else but that He is understood to assume a human  nature; and thus if He did not assume it in reality, this would be a  false understanding; nor would this assumption of the human nature be  anything but a fictitious Incarnation, as Damascene says (De Fide  Orth. iii, 11).    Reply Obj. 1: The incarnate Son of God is the common Saviour of all,  not by a generic or specific community, such as is attributed to the  nature separated from the individuals, but by a community of cause,  whereby the incarnate Son of God is the universal cause of human  salvation.

Fourth Ledge The Slothful.--Discourse of Virgil on  Love and Free Will.--Throng of Spirits running in haste to redeem  their Sin.--The Abbot of San Zone.--Dante falls asleep.      The lofty Teacher had put an end to his discourse, and looked  attentive on my face to see if I appeared content; and I, whom a  fresh thirst already was goading, was silent outwardly, and  within was saying, \"Perhaps the too much questioning I make  annoys him.\" But that true Father, who perceived the timid wish  which did not disclose itself, by speaking gave me hardihood to  speak. Then I, \"My sight is so vivified in thy light that I  discern clearly all that thy discourse may imply or declare:  therefore I pray thee, sweet Father dear, that thou demonstrate  to me the love to which thou referrest every good action and its  contrary.\" \"Direct,\" he said, \"toward me the keen eyes of the  understanding, and the error of the blind who make themselves  leaders will be manifest to thee. The mind, which is created apt  to love, is mobile unto everything that pleases, soon as by  pleasure it is roused to action. Your faculty of apprehension  draws an image from a real existence, and within you displays it,  so that it makes the mind turn to it; and if, thus turned, the  mind incline toward it, that inclination is love, that  inclination is nature which is bound anew in you by pleasure.[1]  Then, as the fire moveth upward by its own form,[2] which is born  to ascend thither where it lasts longest in its material, so the  captive mind enters into longing, which is a spiritual motion,  and never rests until the thing beloved makes it rejoice. Now it  may be apparent to thee, how far the truth is hidden from the  people who aver that every love is in itself a laudable thing;  because perchance its matter appears always to be good;[3] but  not every seal is good although the wax be good.\"    [1] In his discourse in the preceding canto, Virgil has declared  that neither the Creator nor his creatures are ever without love,  either native in the soul, or proceeding from the mind. Here he  explains how the mind is disposed to love by inclination to an  image within itself of some object which gives it pleasure. This  inclination is natural to it; or in his phrase, nature is bound  anew in man by the pleasure which arouses the love. All this is a  doctrine derived directly from St. Thomas Aquinas. \"It is the  property of every nature to have some inclination, which is a  natural appetite, or love.\"--Summa Theol., 1, lxxvi. i.    [2] Form is here used in its scholastic meaning. \" The active  power of anything depends on its form, which is the principle of  its action. Fur the form is either the nature itself of the  thing, as in those which are pure form; or it is a constituent of  the nature of the thing, as in those which are composed of matter  and form.\"--Summa Theol., 3, xiii. i. Fire by its form, or  nature, seeks the sphere of fire between the ether and the moon.    [3] The object may seem desirable to the mind, without being a  fit object of desire.      \"Thy words, and my understanding which follows,\" replied I to  him, \"have revealed love to me; but that has made me more full of  doubt. For if love is offered to us from without, and if with  other foot the soul go not, if strait or crooked she go is not  her own merit.\"[1] And he to me, \"So much as reason seeth here  can I tell thee; beyond that await still for Beatrice; for it is  a work of faith. Every substantial form that is separate from  matter, and is united with it,[2] has a specific virtue residing  in itself which without action is not perceived, nor shows itself  save by its effect, as by green leaves the life in a plant. Yet,  whence the intelligence of the first cognitions comes man doth  not know, nor whence the affection for the first objects of  desire, which exist in you even as zeal in the bee for making  honey: and this first will admits not desert of praise or blame.  Now in order that to this every other may be gathered,[3] the  virtue that counsels [4] is innate in you, and ought to keep the  threshold of assent. This is the principle wherefrom is derived  the reason of desert in you, according as it gathers in and  winnows good and evil loves. Those who in reasoning went to the  foundation took note of this innate liberty, wherefore they  bequeathed morals[5] to the world. Assuming then that every love  which is kindled within you arises of necessity, the power exists  in you to restrain it. This noble virtue Beatrice calls the free  will, and therefore see that thou have it in mind, if she take to  speaking of it with thee.\"    [1] If love be aroused in the soul by an external object, and if  it be natural to the soul to love, how does she deserve praise or  blame for loving?    [2] The substantial form is the soul, which is separate from  matter but united with it.    [3] In order that every other will may conform with the first,  that is, with the affection natural to man for the primal objects  of desire.    [4] The faculty of reason, the virtue which counsels and on which  free will depends, is \"the specific virtue\" of the soul.    [5] The rules of that morality which would have no existence were  it not for freedom of the will.      The moon, belated[1] almost to midnight, shaped[2] like a bucket  that is all ablaze, was making the stars appear fewer to us, and  was running counter to the heavens[3] along those paths which the  sun inflames, when the man of Rome sees it between Sardinia and  Corsica at its setting;[4] and that gentle shade, for whom  Pietola[5] is more famed than the Mantuan city, had laid down the  burden of my loading:[6] wherefore I, who had harvested his open  and plain discourse upon my questions, was standing like a man  who, drowsy, rambles. But this drowsiness was taken from me  suddenly by folk, who, behind our backs, had now come round to  us. And such as was the rage and throng, which of old Ismenus and  Asopus saw at night along their banks, in case the Thebans were  in need of Bacchus, so, according to what I saw of them as they  came, those who by good will and right love are ridden curve  their steps along that circle. Soon they were upon us; because,  running, all that great crowd was moving on; and two in front,  weeping, were crying out, \"Mary ran with haste unto the mountain  [7] and Caesar, to subdue Ilerda, thrust at Marseilles, and then  ran on to Spain.\"[8] \"Swift, swift, that time be not lost by  little love,\" cried the others following, \"for zeal in doing well  may refreshen grace.\" \"O people, in whom keen fervor now perhaps  redeems your negligence and delay, through lukewarmness, in  well-doing, this one who is alive (and surely I lie not to you)  wishes to go up, soon as the sun may shine again for us;  therefore tell us where is the opening near.\" These words were of  my Guide; and one of those spirits said: \"Come thou behind us,  and thou shalt find the gap.
