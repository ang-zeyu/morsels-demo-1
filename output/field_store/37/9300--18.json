But it was not the crusading movement itself  which brought so much new light, so much new knowledge of the world, to  Europe, as the _results_ of that impulse in trade, in travel, and in  colonisation.    [Footnote 22: As completed about A.D. 1000-1040.]    [Footnote 23: As in 1071, when they crushed Romans and the Byzantines in  the battle of Manzikert.]    [Illustration: THE TURIN MAP OF THE ELEVENTH CENTURY. (SEE LIST OF MAPS)]    (1) From the eleventh century, from the beginning of this period, all  the greater pilgrims, Saewulf the English-merchant, King Sigurd of  Norway, Abbot Daniel of Kiev, and their followers, have something more  in view than piety; they have a general interest in travel; some of them  a special interest in trade; most of them go to fight as well as to  pray.    (2) But as the warlike spirit of the Church Militant seems to grow  tired, and its efforts at founding new kingdoms--in Antioch, in  Jerusalem, in Cyprus, in Byzantium--more and more fruitless, the direct  expansion of European knowledge, begins in scientific travel. Vinland  and Greenland and the White Sea and the other Norse discoveries were  discoveries made by a great race for itself; unconnected as they were  with the main lines of trade or with religious sentiment, they were  unrealised by the general consciousness of the West. A full account of  the Norse voyages to America was lying at the Vatican when Columbus was  searching for proofs of land within reach,--of India, as he expected, in  the place where he found an unknown continent and a new world. But no  one knew of these; even the Greenland colony had been lost and  forgotten in the fifteenth century; in 1553 the English sailors reached  the land of Archangel without a suspicion that Ohthere or Thorer Hund  had been there six hundred years before; Russia from the thirteenth to  the sixteenth centuries was almost out of sight and mind under the  Tartar and Moslem rule; but the missionaries and merchants and  travellers who followed the crusading armies to the Euphrates, and crept  along the caravan routes to Ceylon and the China Sea, added Further and  Central Asia--\"Thesauri Arabum et divitis Indiae\"--to the knowledge of  Christendom.    And as this knowledge was bound up with gain; as the Polos and their  companions had really opened to the knowledge of the West those great  prizes of material wealth which even the Rome of Trajan had never fully  grasped, and which had been shared between Arabs and natives without a  rival for so long; it was not likely to be easily forgotten. From that  time, at the end of the thirteenth century, to the success of the  Portuguese on another road, at the end of the fifteenth, European  interest was fairly engaged in pressing in upon the old land-routes and  getting an ever larger share of their profits.    (3) There was another side of the same problem, a still brighter hope  for men who could dare to try it. By finding a sea-path to the Indian  store-house, mariners like the Venetians and Genoese, or their Spanish  pupils, might cut into the treasuries of the world at their very source,  found a trade-empire for their country, and gain the sole command of  heaven on earth, of the true terrestrial paradise.    Then masters of the wealth of the East and of the fighting power of the  West, the Christian nations might crush their old enemy, Islam, between  two weights, hammer and anvil; might fairly strike for the rule of the  entire habitable globe.    It was with thoughts of this kind, vaguely inspired by the Crusades and  their legacy of discovery from Bagdad to Cathay, that the Vivaldi left  Genoa to find an ocean way round Africa in 1281-91, \"with the hope of  going to the parts of the Indies\"; that Malocello reached the Canary  Islands about 1270; and that volunteers went on the same quest nearly  twenty times in the next four generations before their spasmodic efforts  were organised and pressed on to achievement by Henry and his Portuguese  (1412-1497).    (4) Lastly, the renaissance of Europe in the crusading age was not only  practical but spiritual. Science was at last touched and changed by the  new life scarcely less than the art of war, or the social state of the  towns, or the trade of the commercial republics. And geography and its  kindred were not long in feeling some change, though it was very slowly  realised and made useful. The first notice of the magnet in the West is  of about 1180; the use of this by sailors is perhaps rightly dated from  the thirteenth century and the discoveries of Amalphi.    But to return. We must trace more definitely the preparation which has  been generally described for the work of Prince Henry first in the  pilgrim-warriors, and the travellers of the New Age, merchants or  preachers or sight-seers, who follow out the Eastern land-routes; next  in the seamen who begin to break the spell of the Western Ocean and to  open up the high seas, the true high-roads of the world; lastly in the  students who most of all, in their maps and globes and instruments and  theories, are the trainers and masters and spiritual ancestors of the  Hero of Discovery.    The first of these classes supplied the matter, the attractions and  rewards of the exploring movement; the others may be said to provide the  form by which success was reached, genius in seamanship.    And the one was as much needed as the other.    Human reason did its work so well because of a reasonable hope; men  crept round Africa in face of the Atlantic storms because of the golden  East beyond.    It was as we have seen the land travellers of the twelfth and thirteenth  and fourteenth centuries who laid open that golden East to Europe, and  added inspiring knowledge to a dream and a tradition. And of these land  travellers the first worth notice are Saewulf of Worcester, Adelard of  Bath, and Daniel of Kiev, three of that host of peaceful pilgrims who  followed the conquerors of the First Crusade (1096-9). All of these left  their recollections and all of them are of the new time, in sharp  contrast with the hordes of earlier pilgrims, even the most recent, like  Bishop Ealdred of Worcester and York, who crowned William the Conqueror,  or Sweyn Godwineson or Thorer Hund, whose visits are all mere visits of  penitence. Every fresh conversion of the Northern nations brought a  fresh stream of devotees to Italy and to Syria, a fresh revival of the  fourth century habit of pilgrimage; but when mediaeval Christendom had  been formed, and religious passion was more steady and less unworldly,  the discoverer and observer blends with the pilgrim in all the records  left to us.    Saewulf was a layman and a trader, who went on a pilgrimage (1102), and  became a monk at the instance of his confessor, Wulfstan, Bishop of  Worcester. But though his narrative has been called an immense advance  on all earlier guide-books, it ends with the Holy Land and does not  touch even the outlying pilgrim sites, in Mesopotamia or Egypt, visited  and described by Silvia or Fidelis.    Starting some three years after the Latin capture of Jerusalem in 1099,  the English traveller takes us up six different routes from Italy to  Syria, evidence of the vast development of Mediterranean intercourse and  of practical security against pirates, gained very largely since the  second millennium began.    His own way, by Monopoli, Corfu, Corinth, and Athens, took him to Rhodes  \"which once had the Idol called Colossus, one of the Seven Wonders of  the World, but destroyed by the Persians, with nearly all the land of  Roumania, on their way to Spain. These were the Colossians to whom St.  Paul wrote.\"    Thence to Myra in Lycia, \"the port of the Adriatic as Constantinople is  of the AEgean.\"    Landing at Jaffa, after a sail of thirteen weeks, Saewulf was soon among  the wonders of Jerusalem, that had not grown less since Arculf's day. At  the head of the Sepulchre Church was the famous Navel of the Earth,  \"now called Compas, which Christ measured with his own hands, working  salvation in the midst, as say the Psalms.\" For the same legends were  backed by the same texts as in the sixth or seventh century.    Going down to the Jordan, \"four leagues east of Jericho,\" Arabia was  seen beyond \"hateful to all who worship God, but having the Mount whence  Elias was carried into Heaven in a chariot of fire.\"    Eighteen days journey from the Jordan is Mount Sinai, by way of Hebron,  where \"Abraham's Holm Oak\" was still standing, and where, as pilgrims  said, he \"sat and ate with God,\" but Saewulf himself did not go outside  Palestine, on this side. After travelling through Galilee and noting the  House of Saint Archi-Triclin (Saint \"Ruler-of-the-Feast\"), at Cana, he  made his way to Byzantium by sea, escaping the Saracen cruisers and  weathering the storms that wrecked in the roads of Jaffa before his eyes  some twenty of the pilgrim and merchant fleet then lying at anchor. But  not only can we see from this how the religious and commercial traffic  of the Mediterranean had been increased by the Crusades; the main lines  of that traffic had been changed. Since the Moslem conquest, visitors  had mostly come to Palestine through Egypt; the Christian conquest of  Syria re-opened the direct sea route as the conversion of Hungary and  north-east Europe had re-opened the direct land route one hundred years  before (_c._ 1000-1100). The lines of the Danube valley and of the  \"Roman Sea\" were both cleared, and the West again poured itself into the  East as it had not done since Alexander's conquest, since the Oriental  reaction had set in about the time of the Christian era, rising higher  and higher into the full tide of the Persian and Arabian revivals of  Asiatic Empire.    Among the varied classes of pilgrim-crusaders in Saewulf's day were  student-devotees like Adelard and Daniel from the two"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/18767"],[0,"Stories about Animals: with Pictures to Match (#16)"],[1,"rived. The bear must  have a gun too, and he held it like a regular militia man. What a fine  comrade they had found!--and so they marched about the room--'one, two!  one, two!' Presently, however, the door opened. It was the children's  mother. You should have seen her--her face as white as a sheet; her  half-opened mouth, her staring eyes. The smallest of the children ran  up to her mother, and shouted with all her might, 'Mama, we are playing  at soldiers!'\"    [Illustration: THE JUGGLER AND HIS PUPILS.]    Bears have frequently been taught a great many funny tricks. I remember  seeing one, when a boy, that would stand on his head, and dance, and  perform sundry other feats of skill. His master was an old man, who  passed himself off among the little folks as a conjurer. He was dressed  in a most grotesque manner, and played on a drum and some kind of wind  instrument at the same time. Besides the bear, who seemed to be the hero  in the different performances, the juggler had some dogs, which he had  trained to dance to his music, and a cock which would walk and dance,  after his fashion, on stilts. But I should not care to witness any such  performances now. I should not be able to keep out of my mind the  thought that the different animals engaged in these exhibitions must  have been subjected to a great deal of pain and ill treatment before  they could have arrived at such a stage of proficiency, and that thought  would imbitter the entertainment, I imagine.          The Rat and Mouse.      Every body, almost, entertains a sort of hostility to the rat family,  and considers himself licensed to say all manner of hard things about  them. They are a set of rogues--there is no doubt about that, unless  they are universally slandered. But they are shrewd and cunning, as well  as roguish; and many of their exploits are worth recording.    There were several slaughter-houses near Paris, where as many as thirty  worn-out horses were slaughtered every day. One of these  slaughter-houses was regarded as a nuisance, and a proposition was made  to remove it at a greater distance from the city. But there was a strong  objection made to its removal, on account of the ravages which the rats  would make in the neighborhood, when they had no longer the carcasses  of the horses to feed upon. These voracious creatures assembled at this  spot in such numbers, that they devoured all the flesh (that was not  much, perhaps, in many cases) of twenty or thirty horses in one night,  so that in the morning nothing remained of these carcasses but bare  bones. In one of these slaughter-houses, which was inclosed by solid  walls, the carcasses of two or three horses were placed; and in the  night the workmen blocked up all the holes through which the rats went  in. When this was done, the workmen went inside with lighted torches and  heavy clubs, and killed two thousand six hundred and fifty rats. In four  such hunts, the numbers destroyed were upward of nine thousand. The rats  in this neighborhood made themselves burrows like rabbits; and to such  an extent was the building of these underground villages carried, that  the earth sometimes tumbled in, and revealed the astonishing work they  had been doing.    That is rather a tough story, but I guess we shall have to believe it.  It comes to us on the authority of Mr. Jesse, who, in his excellent work  on Natural History, is pretty careful to say nothing which cannot be  relied upon as true. As to the battle which those men had with the rats  in the slaughter-house, it must have been a desperate one. I should not  have fancied it much. I had a little experience in fighting with rats  once, when I was a boy. They were in a room occupied with meal and  flour. The door was closed, so that they could not get out. I was armed  with a fire shovel, or something of that sort, and I fought, as I  thought at the time, with a good deal of bravery and some skill. But the  rats got the better of me. They won the victory. They would jump upon a  barrel, and from that upon a shelf, and then down they would fly into my  face, ready to gripe me with their teeth. I was glad to beat a retreat  soon, I assure you.    They are a shrewd set of fellows, these rats. Some years ago, the cellar  of the house in which I resided was greatly infested with them. They  devoured potatoes, apples, cabbages, and whatever came in their way; for  they are not very particular about their diet, you know. Well, we set a  trap for them. It was a flat stone set up on one end, with a figure  four. We scattered corn all about the trap, and placed a few barrels on  the end of the spindle under the stone. The first night these midnight  robbers ate up all the corn around the trap, but did not touch a morsel  under it. This they repeated several nights in succession; and all at  once, there was not the trace of a rat to be found in the cellar. They  no doubt held a council (rats are accustomed to hold councils, it would  seem; they once held a council to deliberate upon the best mode of  protection against their enemy, the cat, and concluded to put a bell on  her ladyship--so the fable says)--they held a council, as I said before,  and came to the unanimous conclusion that those quarters were no longer  safe. So they decamped forthwith; and the very next day after we missed  them, one of our neighbors complained that they were suddenly besieged  by a whole army of rats.    A German succeeded in training six rats so that they would go through  astonishing exercises. He kept them in a box, which he opened, and from  which they came out only as their names were called. This box was placed  on a table, before which the man stood. He held a wand in his hand, and  called by name such of his pupils as he wished to appear. The one who  was called came out instantly, and climbed up the wand, on which he  seated himself in an upright posture, looking round on the spectators,  and saluting them, after his own fashion. Then he waited the orders of  his master, which he executed with the utmost precision, running from  one end of the rod to the other counterfeiting death, and performing a  multitude of astonishing feats, as he was bidden by his master. After  these performances were finished, the pupil received a reward for his  good behavior, and for his proficiency in study. The master invited him  to come and kiss his face, and eat a part of the biscuit which he held  between his lips. Immediately the animal ran toward him, climbed up to  his shoulder, licked the cheek of his master, and afterward took the  biscuit. Then, turning to the spectators, he seated himself on his  master's shoulder, ate his dinner, and returned to his box. The other  rats were called, one by one, in the same manner, and all went through  the several parts with the same precision.    I have read a pretty tough rat story in the \"Penny Magazine,\" but it is  said to be authentic. \"An open box,\" says the narrator, \"containing some  bottles of Florence oil, was placed in a room which was seldom visited.  On going into the room for one of the bottles, it was perceived that the  pieces of bladder and the cotton, which were at the mouth of each  bottle, had disappeared; and that a considerable quantity of the  contents of the bottles had been consumed. This circumstance having  excited surprise, some of the bottles were filled with oil, and the  mouths of them secured as before. The next morning the coverings of the  bottles had again been removed, and part of the oil was gone. On  watching the room, through a small window, some rats were seen to get  into the box, thrust their tails into the necks of the bottles, and  then, withdrawing them, lick off the oil which adhered to them.\"    Another story about these animals, almost as wonderful, I have upon the  authority of a clergyman in England. He says that he was walking out in  the meadow one evening, and he observed a great number of rats in the  act of emigrating. He stood perfectly still, and the whole army passed  close to him. Among the number he tells us was an old rat who was blind.  He held a piece of stick by one end in his mouth, while another rat had  hold of the other end of it, and was conducting him.    The Chicago Democrat tells the following, prefacing it with the remark  that the rats of Chicago are \"noted for their firmness and daring.\" A  few nights since, a cat belonging to a friend, while exercising the  office of mother of a family of kittens, was attacked by a regularly  organized band of rats, which, sad to relate, contrived to kill the  parent, and make a prey of the offspring. In the morning the cat was  found bitten to death by the side of nine of her assailants, whom she  slew before she was overpowered by superior numbers.    The following story about a rat extremely fond of good living, was told  me by a clerical friend residing in the city of New York. The family in  which this rat lived, had just purchased some round clams, and they were  placed in the cellar. One night all the inmates of the house were  alarmed by an unusual noise. It appeared as if some one was stamping  about the house with heavy boots on. It was a long time before they  found out how the matter stood; but when they did find out, an old rat  was discovered dragging one of these clams about with him. It appeared  that this fellow, thinking it would be nice to have a supper from one of  the clams, which he saw open, thrust in his paw, and got caught.    This story reminds me of a French fable about the rat who got tired of  staying at home, and went abroad to see something of the world. \"A rat  with very few brains\"--so runs the fable--\"got tired of living in  solitude, and took it into his head to travel. He had hardly proceeded a  mile, before he exclaimed, 'What a grand and spacious world this is!  Behold the Alps and the Pyrenees!' The least mole-hill seemed a mountain  in his eyes.
