Verily, I beseech, with all earnestness, the Omnipotence of Might and  Glory to brighten thy face by the light gleaming from the lamp of the  Alliance and to quicken thy mind by the spirit which out-pours from the  Kingdom of God and to make thee a sign of His signs which are shining in  the horizons. He grants that which He wisheth and to whomsoever He  wisheth. Verily, He is powerful and mighty!          \"O servant of God!...\"      O servant of God!    Faith is the magnet which draws the confirmation of the Merciful One.  Service is the magnet which attracts the heavenly strength. I hope thou  wilt attain both.          \"O maid-servant of God!...\"      O maid-servant of God!    How blessed thou hast been to have entered the Kingdom of God! HOw near  thou hast been to the Paradise of ABHA to have been ushered in!    I hope that thou mayest become a source of joy to the hearts, a good  example for people, imbued with spiritual qualities in the world of  humanity, and mayest promulgate the divine teachings, so that the various  people may find unity and become freed from discord.          \"O thou who art advancing toward God!...\"      O thou who art advancing toward God!    Verily I read thy letter of wonderful expression and eloquent composition  and thanked God that He hath poured upon thee the bounty of guidance and  hath made thy heart a lamp of piety.    Verily I beseech God, with all humbleness, to remove the covering from  thine insight and to show unto thee His great signs, and to make thee a  banner of guidance, severed from all else save Him, enkindled with the  fire of His love, engaged in His praise and apprehending the realities of  things; so that thou mayest see with thine eyes, hear with thine ears and  not imitate any of the fathers and ancestors; have perception in the  matter of thy Lord, for the people are in dark veils. By God, the True  One, verily the doors of the everlasting paradise are opened before the  faces of the devoted ones and the Tree of Life therein overshadows the  spiritual ones. Happy are those who enter it and are sheltered under its  shadow!          \"O thou candle shining by the light of the Love of God!...\"      O thou candle shining by the light of the Love of God!    That which thou hast inscribed and conceived of in thy mind was manifest  and clear. The contents indicate spiritual signs and the meanings were  like unto a sweet chalice. I trust in God that thy pure mind may become  reflective of light; thus thou mayest become prepared for the divine  manifestation and attract the light of guidance from the Heavenly Star.    O servant of God! Through the power of God's love the weak become mighty,  the poor become rich, the little bird becomes a great eagle soaring on the  ethereal wave, the tiny plant grows into a great palm tree.    O servant of God! Trials and tests are severe. If thou seekest progress  and advancement in the Kingdom, remain firm and withstand. When it is  possible for thee to visit this land(45) in all fragrance and  spirituality, thou art permitted to come.    If thou canst help the up-building of the Mashrak-el-Azcar in Chicago, it  will be most acceptable.          \"O maid-servant of God!...\"      O maid-servant of God!    I am in the blessed place of the Holy Land and thou art in foreign parts  and I do not see thee with my material eyes, but I see thee with the eyes  of my heart and I remember thee in recalling to thee that which the Christ  promised to the believers, the great blessing and favor, the light of  which illuminates those present and those absent.    O maid-servant of God! Be thou rejoiced because of this good news which  draws (inclines) the sanctified hearts from all worldly conditions and  know thou the value of this great gift (favor) and do not exchange it for  the great sovereignty (of the world), for, verily, the sovereignty of the  world is a mortal rule and follows pride. However, this gift is an eternal  and a divine favor, the light of which illumines the passing of times and  periods.          \"O thou who art attracted by the Fragrances of God!...\"      O thou who art attracted by the Fragrances of God!    Verily, I noted thy letter and utterance. God hath accepted thy devotion,  prayer and worship and hath manifested upon thee the lights of His great  favor, ushered thee into His Kingdom, gave thee to drink of the wine of  His love and made thee to hear the melodies of the birds of holiness in  this wonderful day.    Thank God that He enriched thee beyond the delicacies of this mortal world  and caused thee to taste the sweetness of His love in His New Kingdom.    O maid-servant of God! It is incumbent upon thee, since thou hast attained  the knowledge of God and His love, to sacrifice thy spirit and all thy  conditions for the life of the world, bearing every difficulty for the  comfort of the souls, sinking to the depth of the sea of ordeals for the  sake of the love of faithfulness and burning with the fire of torture and  regret like unto a lamp while the light is shining from thee unto the  surroundings.    O maid-servant of God! The mystery of sacrifice is that man should  sacrifice all his conditions for the divine station of God. The station of  God is mercy, kindness, forgiveness, sacrifice, favor, grace and giving  life to the spirits and lighting the fire of His love in the hearts and  arteries. I asked God to make thee a sign of mercy, the banner of kindness  among His maid-servants.    O maid-servant of God! Sing with beautiful melodies in the meetings of the  maid-servants, praising and glorifying thy Supreme Lord.    O maid-servant of God! The human spirit hath an impression and effect in  the world, but the divine Spirit giveth life to the souls and conferreth  eternal life upon those who are attracted to the fragrances of God. This  is the Great Cause from the Kingdom of thy Lord. Be attached to this New  Spirit which hath effective power in the realities of things and creates  new creatures.    O maid-servant of God! forsake every thought, every remembrance and every  praise, while holding to the Word of God. Confine thy interests, thy works  and efforts to the Cause of God. Thus the spirit of power and might will  confirm thee and the manifest light will shine upon thy brow.          \"O servant of God!...\"      O servant of God!    I was very happy to receive thy letter because it showed thy servitude to  the One God and indicated belief and assurance in the Cause of His  Presence. Thank God that thou art favored with this blessing, that thou  servest the friends of God and thou waitest at the Threshold of the  Merciful. I beg of God that thou mayest be baptized by the baptism of  BAHA'O'LLAH and become free from all the stains of the mortal world and  that thou mayest take delight in the favors of God in the paradise of  unity, and that thou mayest be able to become pleasing to God and mayest  appear with thy face illuminated as a candle in the world of eternity.          \"O thou spiritual friend!...\"      O thou spiritual friend!    Verily, I was informed of the contents of thy letter and increased  gratitude unto God, for that He hath granted the friends clear  consciences, pure and holy hearts, attraction unto the Kingdom of God,  enkindlement by the fire of the love and humbleness to God.    Glad-tidings unto ye for this abundant blessing, sufficient bounties, wide  mercy, glorious appearances; therefore, be united in hearts and spirits,  strive so that ye may obtain the great favors, attain to the overflowing  chalice, perform charity (good deeds), gain the spirit of life, attracted  by the fragrance and depend on the Lord of Signs. At that time your faces  will be illumined, your souls holy, your hearts severed from this world  and attached to the Supreme Concourse, and you will call out with the most  loud voice: \"Glad-tidings unto us through these divine favors and blessed  are we by this heavenly guidance!\"    I was glad in heart when I saw thy likeness in the photograph and looked  at the resemblance like the reality of thy identity and thanked God  witnessing the light of God in thy beautiful face.          \"O thou kind friend!...\"      O thou kind friend!    Thy letter was received and its contents considered. Man must, under all  conditions, be thankful to God, the One, for it is said in the blessed  text: \"If ye be thankful I will increase thee.\"    Man must seek shelter in the mercy and protection of God, for he is  constantly subject to a hundred thousand dangers. Save for the refuge and  protection of the Most High, man is without shelter.    I ask God to help thy children to gain knowledge, to attain virtues and  morals which are the refinements of the reality of man, and to strengthen  thee to remain firm.    Convey my respect and greeting to Mr......... and Mrs. ......... I trust  in the providence of God that thou mayest ascertain what is worthy and  fitting for Bahais, and that day by day the love of God may increase in  the hearts.          \"O maid-servant of God!...\"      O maid-servant of God!    Be exceedingly grateful to the maid-servant of God, Mrs......... who  guided thee, led thee to the Kingdom of Glory and invited thee to the  heavenly table, so that thou mayest attain eternal life and enjoy the  happiness of the Kingdom.    Thou didst write: \"How can I serve Thee?\" The greatest service is thine  own firmness and steadfastness and thy withstanding severe trials when  they come. Through firmness thou wilt perceive the opening of the doors of  grace.          \"O thou plant in the garden of the Love of God!...\"      O thou plant in the garden of the Love of God!    Open the tongue of praise to the Horizon of ABHA, for having received  light from Him in the age of youth, and for having been planted by Him in  the paradise of glory.

I must try to move so that he  should be unable to concentrate either his mind or his men against us.  Here I was handicapped by having no knowledge of my opponent whereas the  German General Staff is certain to have transferred the \"life-like  picture\" Schroeder told me they had of me to Constantinople. Still, sea  power and the mobility it confers is a great help, and we ought to be  able to rattle the enemy however imperturbable may be his nature and  whatever he knows about us if we throw every man we can carry in our  small craft in one simultaneous rush against selected points, whilst  using all the balance in feints against other likely places. Prudence  here is entirely out of place. There will be and can be no  reconnaissance, no half measures, no tentatives. Several cautious  proposals have been set before me but this is neither the time nor the  place for paddling about the shore putting one foot on to the beaches  with the idea of drawing it back again if it happens to alight upon a  land mine. No; we've got to take a good run at the Peninsula and jump  plump on--both feet together. At a given moment we must plunge and stake  everything on the one hazard.    I would like to land my whole force in one,--like a hammer stroke--with  the fullest violence of its mass effect--as close as I can to my  objective, the Kilid Bahr plateau. But, apart from lack of small craft,  the thing cannot be done; the beach space is so cramped that the men and  their stores could not be put ashore. I have to separate my forces and  the effect of momentum, which cannot be produced by cohesion, must be  reproduced by the simultaneous nature of the movement. From the South,  Achi Baba mountain is our first point of attack, and the direct move  against it will start from the beaches at Cape Helles and Sedd-el-Bahr.  As it is believed that the Turks are there in some force to oppose us,  envelopment will be attempted by landing detachments in Morto Bay and  opposite Krithia village. At the same time, also, the A. and N.Z. Corps  will land between Gaba Tepe and Fisherman's Hut to try and seize the  high backbone of the Peninsula and cut the line of retreat of the enemy  on the Kilid Bahr plateau. In any case, the move is bound to interfere  with the movements of Turkish reinforcements towards the toe of the  Peninsula. While these real attacks are taking place upon the foot and  at the waist of the Peninsula, the knife will be flourished at its neck.  Transports containing troops which cannot be landed during the first two  days must sail up to Bulair; make as much splash as they can with their  small boats and try to provide matter for alarm wires to Constantinople  and the enemy's Chief.    So much for Europe. Asia is forbidden but I hold myself free, as a  measure of battle tactics, to take half a step Troywards. The French are  to land a Brigade at Kum Kale (perhaps a Regiment may do) so as, first,  to draw the fire of any enemy big guns which can range Morto Bay;  secondly, to prevent Turkish troops being shipped across the Narrows.    With luck, then, within the space of an hour, the enemy Chief will be  beset by a series of S.O.S. signals. Over an area of 100 miles, from  five or six places; from Krithia and Morto Bay; from Gaba Tepe; from  Bulair and from Kum Kale in Asia, as well as, if the French can manage  it, from Besika Bay, the cables will pour in. I reckon Liman von  Sanders will not dare concentrate and that he will fight with his local  troops only for the first forty-eight hours. But what is the number of  these local troops? Alas, there is the doubtful point. We think forty  thousand rifles and a hundred guns, but, if my scheme comes off, not a  tenth of them should be South of Achi Baba for the first two days. Hints  have been thrown out that we are asking the French cat to pull the  hottest chestnut out of the fire. Not at all. At Kum Kale, with their  own ships at their back, and the deep Mendere River to their front,  d'Amade's men should easily be able to hold their own for a day or  two,--all that we ask of them.    The backbone of my enterprise is the 29th Division. At dawn I intend to  land the covering force of that Division at Sedd-el-Bahr, Cape Helles  and, D.V., in Morto Bay. I tack my D.V. on to Morto Bay because the  transports will there be under fire from Asia unless the French succeed  in silencing the guns about Troy or in diverting their aim. Whether then  our transports can stick it or not is uncertain, like everything else in  war, only more so. They must if they can and if they can they must; that  is all that can be said at present.    As to the effort to be made to envelop the enemy's right flank along the  coast between Helles and Krithia, I have not yet quite fixed on the  exact spot, but I am personally bent upon having it done as even a small  force so landed should threaten the line of retreat and tend to shake  the confidence of any Turks resisting us at the Southernmost point.  Some think these cliffs along that North-west coast unclimbable, but I  am sure our fellows will manage to scramble up, and I think their losses  should be less in doing so than in making the more easy seeming lodgment  at Sedd-el-Bahr or Helles. The more broken and precipitous the glacis,  the more the ground leading up to the objective is dead. The guns of the  Fleet can clear the crest of the cliffs and the strip of sand at their  foot should then be as healthy as Brighton. If the Turks down at Helles  are nervous, even a handful landing behind their first line (stretching  from the old Castle Northwards to the coast) should make them begin to  look over their shoulders.    As to the A. and N.Z. landing, that will be of the nature of a strong  feint, which may, and we hope will, develop into the real thing. My  General Staff have marked out on the maps a good circular holding  position, starting from Fisherman's Hut in the North round along the  Upper Spurs of the high ridges and following them down to where they  reach the sea, a little way above Gaba Tepe. If only Birdwood can seize  this line and fix himself there for a bit, he should in due course be  able to push on forward to Kojah Dere whence he will be able to choke  the Turks on the Southern part of the Peninsula with a closer grip and a  more deadly than we could ever hope to exercise from far away Bulair.    We are bound to suffer serious loss from concealed guns, both on the sea  and also during the first part of our landing before we can win ground  for our guns. That is part of the hardness of the nut. The landings at  Gaba Tepe and to the South will between them take up all our small craft  and launches. So I am unable to throw the Naval Division into action at  the first go off. They will man the transports that sail to make a show  at Bulair.    This is the substance of my opening remarks at the meeting: discussion  followed, and, at the end, the Navy signified full approval. Neither de  Robeck, Wemyss nor Roger Keyes are men to buy pigs in pokes; they wanted  to know all about it and to be quite sure they could play their part in  the programme. Their agreement is all the more precious. They (the  Admirals and the Commodore) are also, I fancy, happier in their minds  now that they know for sure what we soldiers are after. Rumours had been  busy in the Fleet that we were shaping our course for Bulair. Had that  been the basis of my plan, we should have come to loggerheads, I think.  As it is, the sailors seem eager to meet us in every possible way. So  now we've got to get our orders out.    On maps and charts the scheme may look neat and simple. On land and  water, the trouble will begin and only by the closest thought and  prevision will we find ourselves in a position to cope with it. To throw  so many men ashore in so short a time in the teeth of so rapid a current  on to a few cramped beaches; to take the chances of finding drinking  water and of a smooth sea; these elemental hazards alone would suffice  to give a man grey hairs were we practising a manoeuvre exercise on  the peaceful Essex coast. So much thought; so much _band-o-bast_; so  much dove-tailing and welding together of naval and military methods,  signals, technical words, etc., and the worst punishment should any link  in the composite chain give way. And then--taking success for  granted--on the top of all this--comes the Turk; \"unspeakable\" he used  to be, \"unknowable\" now. But we shall give him a startler too. If only  our plans come off the Turk won't have time to turn; much less to bring  into play all the clever moves foreseen for him by some whose stomachs  for the fight have been satisfied by their appreciation of its dangers.    Units of the 29th Division have been coming along in their transports  all day. The bay is alive with ships.    _11th April, 1915. S.S. \"Arcadian.\"_ One of those exquisite days when  the sunlight penetrates to the heart. Admiral Guepratte, commanding the  French Fleet, called at 9.45 and in due course I returned his visit,  when I was electrified to find at his cabin door no common sentry but a  Beefeater armed with a large battleaxe, dating from about the period of  Charlemagne. The Admiral lives quite in the old style and is a  delightful personage; very gay and very eager for a chance to measure  himself against the enemy. Guepratte, though he knows nothing  officially, believes that his Government are holding up their sleeve a  second French Division ear-marked Gallipoli! But why bottle up trumps;  trumps worth a King's ransome, or a Kaiser's? He gives twice who gives  quickly (in peace); he gives tenfold who gives quickly (in war). The  devil of it is the French dare not cable home to ask questions, and as  for myself, I have not been much "]]]
