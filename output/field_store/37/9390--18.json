One such I purchased for a small sum in  1911. It was tightly clasped, and its boards were warped by having for  years been obliged to embrace a number of extraneous sheets.  Three-quarters of this inserted matter had lost all vestige of  importance for any living human being: one bundle had not. That it  belonged to a lawyer is certain, for it is endorsed: _The strangest  case I have yet met_, and bears initials, and an address in Gray's  Inn. It is only materials for a case, and consists of statements by  possible witnesses. The man who would have been the defendant or  prisoner seems never to have appeared. The _dossier_ is not complete,  but, such as it is, it furnishes a riddle in which the supernatural  appears to play a part. You must see what you can make of it.    The following is the setting and the tale as I elicit it.    Dr. Abell was walking in his garden one afternoon waiting for his  horse to be brought round that he might set out on his visits for the  day. As the place was Islington, the month June, and the year 1718, we  conceive the surroundings as being countrified and pleasant. To him  entered his confidential servant, Luke Jennett, who had been with him  twenty years.    \"I said I wished to speak to him, and what I had to say might take  some quarter of an hour. He accordingly bade me go into his study,  which was a room opening on the terrace path where he was walking, and  came in himself and sat down. I told him that, much against my will, I  must look out for another place. He inquired what was my reason, in  consideration I had been so long with him. I said if he would excuse  me he would do me a great kindness, because (this appears to have  been common form even in 1718) I was one that always liked to have  everything pleasant about me. As well as I can remember, he said that  was his case likewise, but he would wish to know why I should change  my mind after so many years, and, says he, 'you know there can be no  talk of a remembrance of you in my will if you leave my service now.'  I said I had made my reckoning of that.    \"'Then,' says he, 'you must have some complaint to make, and if I  could I would willingly set it right.' And at that I told him, not  seeing how I could keep it back, the matter of my former affidavit and  of the bedstaff in the dispensing-room, and said that a house where  such things happened was no place for me. At which he, looking very  black upon me, said no more, but called me fool, and said he would pay  what was owing me in the morning; and so, his horse being waiting,  went out. So for that night I lodged with my sister's husband near  Battle Bridge and came early next morning to my late master, who then  made a great matter that I had not lain in his house and stopped a  crown out of my wages owing.    \"After that I took service here and there, not for long at a time,  and saw no more of him till I came to be Dr. Quinn's man at Dodds Hall  in Islington.\"    There is one very obscure part in this statement, namely, the  reference to the former affidavit and the matter of the bedstaff. The  former affidavit is not in the bundle of papers. It is to be feared  that it was taken out to be read because of its special oddity, and  not put back. Of what nature the story was may be guessed later, but  as yet no clue has been put into our hands.    The Rector of Islington, Jonathan Pratt, is the next to step forward.  He furnishes particulars of the standing and reputation of Dr. Abell  and Dr. Quinn, both of whom lived and practised in his parish.    \"It is not to be supposed,\" he says, \"that a physician should be a  regular attendant at morning and evening prayers, or at the Wednesday  lectures, but within the measure of their ability I would say that  both these persons fulfilled their obligations as loyal members of the  Church of England. At the same time (as you desire my private mind) I  must say, in the language of the schools, _distinguo_. Dr. A. was to  me a source of perplexity, Dr. Q. to my eye a plain, honest believer,  not inquiring over closely into points of belief, but squaring his  practice to what lights he had. The other interested himself in  questions to which Providence, as I hold, designs no answer to be  given us in this state: he would ask me, for example, what place I  believed those beings now to hold in the scheme of creation which by  some are thought neither to have stood fast when the rebel angels  fell, nor to have joined with them to the full pitch of their  transgression.    \"As was suitable, my first answer to him was a question, What warrant  he had for supposing any such beings to exist? for that there was none  in Scripture I took it he was aware. It appeared--for as I am on the  subject, the whole tale may be given--that he grounded himself on such  passages as that of the satyr which Jerome tells us conversed with  Antony; but thought too that some parts of Scripture might be cited in  support. 'And besides,' said he, 'you know 'tis the universal belief  among those that spend their days and nights abroad, and I would add  that if your calling took you so continuously as it does me about the  country lanes by night, you might not be so surprised as I see you to  be by my suggestion.' 'You are then of John Milton's mind,' I said,  'and hold that        Millions of spiritual creatures walk the earth      Unseen, both when we wake and when we sleep.'    \"'I do not know,' he said, 'why Milton should take upon himself to say  \"unseen\"; though to be sure he was blind when he wrote that. But for  the rest, why, yes, I think he was in the right.' 'Well,' I said,  'though not so often as you, I am not seldom called abroad pretty  late; but I have no mind of meeting a satyr in our Islington lanes in  all the years I have been here; and if you have had the better luck, I  am sure the Royal Society would be glad to know of it.'    \"I am reminded of these trifling expressions because Dr. A. took them  so ill, stamping out of the room in a huff with some such word as that  these high and dry parsons had no eyes but for a prayerbook or a pint  of wine.    \"But this was not the only time that our conversation took a  remarkable turn. There was an evening when he came in, at first  seeming gay and in good spirits, but afterwards as he sat and smoked  by the fire falling into a musing way; out of which to rouse him I  said pleasantly that I supposed he had had no meetings of late with  his odd friends. A question which did effectually arouse him, for he  looked most wildly, and as if scared, upon me, and said, '_You_ were  never there? I did not see you. Who brought you?' And then in a more  collected tone, 'What was this about a meeting? I believe I must have  been in a doze.' To which I answered that I was thinking of fauns and  centaurs in the dark lane, and not of a witches' Sabbath; but it  seemed he took it differently.    \"'Well,' said he, 'I can plead guilty to neither; but I find you very  much more of a sceptic than becomes your cloth. If you care to know  about the dark lane you might do worse than ask my housekeeper that  lived at the other end of it when she was a child.' 'Yes,' said I,  'and the old women in the almshouse and the children in the kennel. If  I were you, I would send to your brother Quinn for a bolus to clear  your brain.' 'Damn Quinn,' says he; 'talk no more of him: he has  embezzled four of my best patients this month; I believe it is that  cursed man of his, Jennett, that used to be with me, his tongue is  never still; it should be nailed to the pillory if he had his  deserts.' This, I may say, was the only time of his showing me that he  had any grudge against either Dr. Quinn or Jennett, and as was my  business, I did my best to persuade him he was mistaken in them. Yet  it could not be denied that some respectable families in the parish  had given him the cold shoulder, and for no reason that they were  willing to allege. The end was that he said he had not done so ill at  Islington but that he could afford to live at ease elsewhere when he  chose, and anyhow he bore Dr. Quinn no malice. I think I now remember  what observation of mine drew him into the train of thought which he  next pursued. It was, I believe, my mentioning some juggling tricks  which my brother in the East Indies had seen at the court of the Rajah  of Mysore. 'A convenient thing enough,' said Dr. Abell to me, 'if by  some arrangement a man could get the power of communicating motion and  energy to inanimate objects.' 'As if the axe should move itself  against him that lifts it; something of that kind?' 'Well, I don't  know that that was in my mind so much; but if you could summon such a  volume from your shelf or even order it to open at the right page.'    \"He was sitting by the fire--it was a cold evening--and stretched out  his hand that way, and just then the fire-irons, or at least the  poker, fell over towards him with a great clatter, and I did not hear  what else he said. But I told him that I could not easily conceive of  an arrangement, as he called it, of such a kind that would not include  as one of its conditions a heavier payment than any Christian would  care to make; to which he assented. 'But,' he said, 'I have no doubt  these bargains can be made very tempting, very persuasive. Still, you  would not favour them, eh, Doctor? No, I suppose not.'    \"This is as much as I know of Dr. Abell's mind, and the feeling  between these men. Dr. Quinn, as I said, was a plain, honest creature,  and a man to whom I would have gone--indeed I have before now gone to  him for advice on matters of business. He was, however, every now and  again, and particularly of late, not exempt from troublesome fancies.  There was certainly a time when he was so much harassed by his dreams"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/20390"],[0,"Elements of Structural and Systematic Botany (#16)"],[1,"(_Puccinia graminis_), x 300. _L_, forms of black-rust spores: i,  _Uromyces_; ii, _Puccinia_; iii, _Phragmidium_.]    The first form met with in most rusts is sometimes called the  \"cluster-cup\" stage, and in many species is the only stage known. In  Figure 47, _F_, is shown a bit of the leaf of the Indian turnip  (_Arisaema_) affected by one of these \"cluster-cup\" forms. To the naked  eye, or when slightly magnified, the masses of spores appear as bright  orange spots, mostly upon the lower surface. The affected leaves are  more or less checked in their growth, and the upper surface shows  lighter blotches, corresponding to the areas below that bear the  cluster cups. These at first appear as little elevations of a  yellowish color, and covered with the epidermis; but as the spores  ripen they break through the epidermis, which is turned back around  the opening, the whole forming a little cup filled with a bright  orange red powder, composed of the loose masses of spores.      Putting a piece of the affected leaf between two pieces of pith so    as to hold it firmly, with a little care thin vertical sections of    the leaf, including one of the cups, may be made, and mounted,    either in water or glycerine, removing the air with alcohol. We find    that the leaf is thickened at this point owing to a diseased growth    of the cells of the leaf, induced by the action of the fungus. The    mass of spores (Fig. 47, _G_) is surrounded by a closely woven mass    of filaments, forming a nearly globular cavity. Occupying the bottom    of the cup are closely set, upright filaments, each bearing a row of    spores, arranged like those of the white rusts, but so closely    crowded as to be flattened at the sides. The outer rows have    thickened walls, and are grown together so as to form the wall of    the cup.      The spores are filled with granular protoplasm, in which are    numerous drops of orange-yellow oil, to which is principally due    their color. As the spores grow, they finally break the overlying    epidermis, and then become rounded as the pressure from the sides is    relieved. They germinate within a few hours if placed in water,    sending out a tube, into which pass the contents of the spore    (Fig. 47, _I_).    One of the most noticeable of the rusts is the cedar rust  (_Gymnosporangium_), forming the growths known as \"cedar apples,\"  often met with on the red cedar. These are rounded masses, sometimes  as large as a walnut, growing upon the small twigs of the cedar  (Fig. 47, _A_). This is a morbid growth of the same nature as those  produced by the white rusts and smuts. If one of these cedar apples is  examined in the late autumn or winter, it will be found to have the  surface dotted with little elevations covered by the epidermis, and on  removing this we find masses of forming spores. These rupture the  epidermis early in the spring, and appear then as little spikes of a  rusty red color. If they are kept wet for a few hours, they enlarge  rapidly by the absorption of water, and may reach a length of four or  five centimetres, becoming gelatinous in consistence, and sometimes  almost entirely hiding the surface of the \"apple.\" In this stage the  fungus is extremely conspicuous, and may frequently be met with after  rainy weather in the spring.      This orange jelly, as shown by the microscope, is made up of    elongated two-celled spores (teleuto spores), attached to long    gelatinous stalks (Fig. 47, _B_). They are thick-walled, and the    contents resemble those of the cluster-cup spores described above.      To study the earlier stages of germination it is best to choose    specimens in which the masses of spores have not been moistened. By    thoroughly wetting these, and keeping moist, the process of    germination may be readily followed. Many usually begin to grow    within twenty-four hours or less. Each cell of the spore sends out a    tube (Fig. 47, _C_), through an opening in the outer wall, and this    tube rapidly elongates, the spore contents passing into it, until a    short filament (basidium) is formed, which then divides into several    short cells. Each cell develops next a short, pointed process, which    swells up at the end, gradually taking up all the contents of the    cell, until a large oval spore (_sp._) is formed at the tip,    containing all the protoplasm of the cell.    Experiments have been made showing that these spores do not germinate  upon the cedar, but upon the hawthorn or crab-apple, where they  produce the cluster-cup stage often met with late in the summer. The  affected leaves show bright orange-yellow spots about a centimetre in  diameter (Fig. 47, _D_), and considerably thicker than the other parts  of the leaf. On the upper side of these spots may be seen little black  specks, which microscopic examination shows to be spermogonia,  resembling those of the lichens. Later, on the lower surface, appear  the cluster cups, whose walls are prolonged so that they form little  tubular processes of considerable length (Fig. 47, _E_).      In most rusts the teleuto spores are produced late in the summer or    autumn, and remain until the following spring before they germinate.    They are very thick-walled, the walls being dark-colored, so that in    mass they appear black, and constitute the \"black-rust\" stage    (Fig. 47, _J_). Associated with these, but formed earlier, and    germinating immediately, are often to be found large single-celled    spores, borne on long stalks. They are usually oval in form, rather    thin-walled, but the outer surface sometimes provided with little    points. The contents are reddish, so that in mass they appear of the    color of iron rust, and cause the \"red rust\" of wheat and other    plants, upon which they are growing.    The classification of the rusts is based mainly upon the size and  shape of the teleuto spores where they are known, as the cluster-cup  and red-rust stages are pretty much the same in all. Of the commoner  genera _Melampsora_, and _Uromyces_ (Fig. 47, _L_ i), have unicellular  teleuto spores; _Puccinia_ (ii) and _Gymnosporangium_, two-celled  spores; _Triphragmium_, three-celled; and _Phragmidium_ (iii), four or  more.    The rusts are so abundant that a little search can scarcely fail to  find some or all of the stages. The cluster-cup stages are best  examined fresh, or from alcoholic material; the teleuto spores may be  dried without affecting them.    Probably the best-known member of the group is the wheat rust  (_Puccinia graminis_), which causes so much damage to wheat and  sometimes to other grains. The red-rust stage may be found in early  summer; the black-rust spores in the stubble and dead leaves in the  autumn or spring, forming black lines rupturing the epidermis.    Probably to be associated with the lower _Basidiomycetes_ are the  large fungi of which _Tremella_ (Fig. 51, _A_) is an example. They are  jelly-like forms, horny and somewhat brittle when dry, but becoming  soft when moistened. They are common, growing on dead twigs, logs,  etc., and are usually brown or orange-yellow in color.    Of the higher _Basidiomycetes_, the toadstools, mushrooms, etc., are  the highest, and any common form will serve for study. One of the most  accessible and easily studied forms is _Coprinus_, of which there are  several species growing on the excrement of various herbivorous  animals. They not infrequently appear on horse manure that has been  kept covered with a glass for some time, as described for _Ascobolus_.  After two or three weeks some of these fungi are very likely to make  their appearance, and new ones continue to develop for a long time.

This rapidly  increases in size, becoming oblong in shape, and growing finally  somewhat darker in color; and by the time it reaches a height of a few  millimetres a short stalk becomes perceptible, and presently the whole  assumes the form of a closed umbrella. The top is covered with little  prominences, that diminish in number and size toward the bottom. After  the cap reaches its full size, the stalk begins to grow, slowly at  first, but finally with great rapidity, reaching a height of several  centimetres within a few hours. At the same time that the stalk is  elongating, the cap spreads out, radial clefts appearing on its upper  surface, which flatten out very much as the folds of an umbrella are  stretched as it opens, and the spaces between the clefts appear as  ridges, comparable to the ribs of the umbrella (Fig. 48, _B_). The  under side of the cap has a number of ridges running from the centre  to the margin, and of a black color, due to the innumerable spores  covering their surface (_C_). Almost as soon as the umbrella opens,  the spores are shed, and the whole structure shrivels up and  dissolves, leaving almost no trace behind.      If we examine microscopically the youngest specimens procurable,    freeing from air with alcohol, and mounting in water or dilute    glycerine, we find it to be a little, nearly globular mass of    colorless filaments, with numerous cross-walls, the whole arising    from similar looser filaments imbedded in the substratum (Fig. 48,    _G_). If the specimen is not too young, a denser central portion can    be made out, and in still older ones (Fig. 48, _H_) this central    mass has assumed the form of a short, thick stalk, crowned by a flat    cap, the whole"]]]
