[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/21677"],[0,"Milton (#16)"],[1,"the realm of a king of the same name, who reigns over it with his  consort Night. It is of immeasurable extent, quite dark, and turbulent  with the raw material of the Cosmos. Just as Milton, for the purposes of  his poem, followed the older astronomy, and gave to it a new lease of  life in the popular imagination, so also he abides by the older physics.  The orderly created World, or Cosmos, is conceived as compounded of four  elements, Earth, Air, Fire, and Water. None of these four is to be found  in Chaos, for each of them is composed of the simpler atoms of Hot, Cold,  Moist, and Dry, symmetrically arranged in pairs. Thus Air is Hot and  Moist, Fire is Hot and Dry, Water is Cold and Moist, Earth is Cold and  Dry. Before they are separated and blended by Divine command, the four  rudimentary constituents of creation are crowded in repulsive contiguity;  they bubble and welter, fight and jostle in the dark, with hideous  noises. In its upper strata Chaos is calmer, and is faintly lighted by  the effulgence from the partially transparent walls of Heaven.    Below is Hell, newly prepared for the rebels. Like Heaven it is a vast  plain; a bituminous lake, played over by livid flames, is one of its  principal features; and hard by stands a volcanic mountain, at the foot  of which the devils build their palace, and hold their assembly. The  nine-fold gates of Hell, far distant, are guarded by Sin and Death, the  paramour and the son of Satan. No one has plausibly explained how they  came by their office. It was intended to be a perfect sinecure; there was  no one to be let in and no one to be let out. The single occasion that  presented itself for a neglect of their duty was by them eagerly seized.    During the nine days while the rebels lay on the burning lake, drowsed by  its fumes, the World was created. It consists, according to the astronomy  followed by Milton, of ten concentric spheres fitted, like Chinese boxes,  one within another, and the Earth in the centre. Nine of these are  transparent, the spheres, that is to say, of the seven planets (the Sun  and the Moon being reckoned as planets), the sphere of the fixed stars,  and the crystalline sphere. The outermost sphere, or _primum mobile_, is  opaque and impervious. The whole orbicular World hangs by a golden chain  from that part of the battlements of Heaven whence the angels fell. It is  connected with Heaven by richly jewelled stairs, to be let down or taken  up at pleasure, and can be entered only through an orifice or passage at  the top. Between the foot of the stairs and the entrance to the World is  a sea or lake of jasper and liquid pearl.    All the interest and meaning of the World is centred in one favoured spot  of Earth. Eden is a district of Mesopotamia, and the happy garden, called  Paradise, is situated in the east of Eden. It is a raised table-land,  surrounded on all sides by a high ridge of hill, thickly wooded, and  impenetrable. Its single gate, hewn out of a rock of alabaster, faces  eastward, and is accessible only by a pass leading up from the plain and  overhung by craggy cliffs. Through Eden runs a river which passes by a  tunnel under Paradise, and, rising through the porous earth, waters the  garden with springs. It was by this underground passage that Satan  entered the garden a second time, when, having been discovered by  Ithuriel, and expelled by Gabriel, he had circled the Earth seven times,  keeping on the shady side to avoid the gaze of Uriel, and at the end of  the week had resolved on another attempt.    The Fall of Man wrought some few changes in the physical configuration of  the Universe. Sin and Death built the mighty causeway that connects the  orifice of the World with Hell-gates. Provision had to be made under the  new dispensation for the peopling of the whole surface of the Earth; so  the axis was turned askew, and the beginning ordained of extremes of cold  and heat, of storms and droughts, and noxious planetary influences. Night  and day were known to man in his sinless state, but the seasons date from  his transgression.    The time-scheme of the poem is less carefully defined; indeed, it is not  certain that Milton intended accurately to define it. The recurrence of  the numbers three and nine, numbers traditionally honoured by poetry,  throws suspicion on the efforts of the exact commentators. Even in his  statements with regard to spatial relations the poet was not always  minutely consistent with himself. The distance from the plain of Heaven  to the plain of Hell is said in the First Book to be three times the  radius of the World, or, in his own words, the prison of Hell is      As far removed from God and light of Heaven    As from the centre thrice to the utmost pole.    The great globe, therefore, that hangs from the floor of Heaven reaches  two-thirds of the way down to Hell. Yet in the Second Book Satan, after a  long and perilous journey from Hell, comes in view of      This pendent World, in bigness as a star    Of smallest magnitude close by the moon.    So small is the World, compared with the wide extent of the empyreal  Heaven. But it is not easy to conceive how, in the limited space between  Heaven and Hell, the World could so appear to Satan.    A like curious consideration of the passages where time is mentioned  reveals a gap in the tale of days enumerated by Milton. We are not told  how long it took Satan to reach the Earth. Driven back on precedents and  analogies we find them conflicting. The outcast angels took nine days to  fall the same distance. But falling, as Moloch points out in his speech  at the Infernal Council, was to them less natural than rising; and  Raphael, who was subsequently sent to guard the gates of Hell during the  Creation, made the ascent easily in part of a day. If we allow a day and  a night for Satan's exploratory voyage, the action of the poem, from the  heavenly decree which occasioned the rebellion, to the expulsion of Adam  and Eve from Paradise, has been found to occupy thirty-three days, some  measured by a heavenly, some by an earthly standard. This would make Adam  and Eve about ten days old when they fell. But St. Augustine says that  they spent six years in the Earthly Paradise, and the question is better  left open.    A graver inconsistency is brought to light by a close study of the  framework of the poem. Milton seems to have hesitated as to which of two  theories he would adopt concerning the Creation of Man. After their fall  both Satan and Beelzebub mention a rumour which had long been current in  Heaven of a new race, called Man, shortly to be created. That rumour  could hardly have reached the rebels during the progress of the war. Yet  in the Seventh Book the Creation appears as a compliment paid to Satan, a  counter-move devised after the suppression of the great rebellion. The  Omnipotent thus declares his intention:--      But, lest his heart exalt him in the harm    Already done, to have dispeopled Heaven--    My damage fondly deemed,--I can repair    That detriment, if such it be to lose    Self-lost, and in a moment will create    Another world; out of one man a race    Of men innumerable.    This last is the account we must accept. Milton no doubt was attracted by  the dramatic superiority of this version, which makes the Creation of Man  a minor incident in the great war, so that the human race comes, a mere  token and pawn--      Between the pass and fell incensed points    Of mighty opposites.    But he was probably also aware that this view had not the highest warrant  of orthodoxy.    There is something absurd, perhaps even something repulsive, to the  modern mind in this careful, matter-of-fact anatomy of Milton's poem. But  it is a useful and necessary exercise, for all his greatest effects are  achieved in the realm of the physical and moral sublime, where the moral  relations are conditioned chiefly by the physical. There is no  metaphysic, nothing spiritual, nothing mysterious, except in name,  throughout the whole poem. The so-called spiritual beings are as  definitely embodied as man. The rules that Milton followed in dealing  with his heavenly essences are very fully laid down in the _Treatise of  Christian Doctrine_. He consigned the Fathers to limbo, and built up his  entire system from the words of Scripture. Now the Scriptures, in a  hundred passages, attribute human passions and actions to Divine beings.  We have no choice, said Milton, but to accept these expressions as the  truest to which we can attain. \"If after the work of six days it be said  of God that 'He rested and was refreshed,' _Exodus_, xxxi. 17; if it be  said that 'He feared the wrath of the enemy,' _Deuteronomy_, xxxii. 27;  let us believe that it is not beneath the dignity of God ... to be  refreshed in that which refresheth Him, or to fear in that He feareth.\"  Milton had here the sharp logical dilemma that he loved. Either these  expressions are literally true, or they are not. If they are, well and  good; if they are not, how can we hope to frame for ourselves better and  truer notions of the Deity than those which he has dictated to us as  within the reach of our understanding, and fit and proper for us to  entertain? So also with angelic beings: Milton dismisses the nine orders  of the apocryphal hierarchy--although he enumerates five of them, in the  wrong order, in the roll of that recurring verse--      Thrones, Dominations, Princedoms, Virtues, Powers--    and bases himself upon Scripture. There he finds mention of seven chief  angels, with some kind of pre-eminence enjoyed by Michael. In the poem he  finds employment for only four, Michael, Gabriel, Raphael, and Uriel,  with a few Seraphim and Cherubim, to whom he invariably, and very  improperly, assigns a subordinate position.    His angels fight and play games, as they were doing at the gate of  Paradise on the evening when Satan first appeared there.

She could easily tell Mrs. Chambers that her sister had  thought it too stormy for the little ones to venture, and probably Dr.  Chambers would drive her back in the gig.    \"After all, Father never told me not to go!\" she thought, \"and  Beatrice is getting a perfect tyrant; I can't be expected to obey her  as if I were an infant. A girl in the Fifth is quite old enough to  decide things for herself, especially when she's as tall as I am!\"    Gwen changed her dress, put on her best hair ribbon, her brooch, and  her locket, then peeped cautiously down the stairs. Although she felt  full of self-assertion, she had no wish to risk a further encounter  with Beatrice. All seemed quiet, so, donning hat and coat, she crept  to the cupboard where mackintoshes and galoshes were kept, and armed  herself to defy the weather. It was quite an easy matter to slip out  by the back door, and in less than ten seconds she was hurrying  through the village, chuckling at her own daring and cleverness. Thick  flakes were whirling everywhere: when she looked upwards they showed  as little dark patches against the neutral-tinted sky, but when they  passed the line of vision, each soft lump of crystals gleamed purest  white as it joined the ever-deepening mass below. Every gate and stump  and rubbish heap was a thing of beauty, glorified by the ethereal  covering of the snow; the dead clumps of ragwort by the road side, the  withered branches of oak, the shrivelled trails of bramble all seemed  transformed by the feathery particles into a species of fairyland.    As Gwen left the village, and took the path that led across the moor,  she seemed to walk into a cloud of whiteness that enclosed her and  shut her out from all before or behind. She stood still for a moment,  and drew in her breath with a sense of intense exhilaration. She was  all by herself in the midst of this new-found world of snow, and the  very solitude had a fascination. It is good sometimes for the spirit  to be alone; strange vague thoughts, half memories, half imaginings,  fill the brain like a full high tide; strong impressions, unfelt and  unknowable in the distraction of human company, force themselves  silently yet persistently upon us; the corporal and the tangible lose  their hard outlines and begin to merge into the in visible--in such  moments the soul grows. It is perhaps one of the disadvantages of a  large family that the members are apt to lack what one might call  spiritual elbow room, the constant close companionship, the fridging  and rubbing of the continual, daily, hourly intercourse, though an  excellent discipline for the temper, leaves scant opportunity for the  development of the individuality. Gwen could not have explained this  in the least, but as she stood in the still quiet of the falling snow,  she felt as if all the little fretting cares and worries and squabbles  and anxieties dropped away into a subordinate place, and she were  viewing life with another range of vision, where the proportions of  things were quite changed.    She walked on, almost as if she were in a dream, without even the  sound of a footstep to break the intense silence. She was now on the  open wold, where there were neither hedges nor walls, but only a few  stones to mark the road from the sedgy, heathery expanse of moor that  stretched on either side. Gwen knew the way so thoroughly that she  thought she could have followed it blindfold. Every rock and boulder  and bush were familiar, and as a rule were so many points along the  daily path to school. Now, however, all the well-known landmarks  seemed to have a strange similarity, and to be merging into one great  white waste, in which tree stump was indistinguishable from stone or  gorse clump. The light was fading rapidly, for the clouds went on  gathering, and the flakes came down ever thicker and faster. So far  Gwen had gone on with the utmost confidence, but now she stopped and  entertained a doubt. She did not recognize the boulder on her right,  and the juniper bush on her left was surely strange.    \"I verily believe I've come wrong somehow,\" she muttered. \"There's  nothing for it but to turn back.\"    She could see her own footsteps in the snow behind, and for some  hundreds of yards she traced them; then they began to get fainter and  fainter, and presently they were hidden entirely by the new-fallen  flakes. The road was completely obliterated, there was nothing round  her but shapeless indefinite whiteness. Then it dawned upon Gwen's  soul that she was lost, lost hopelessly on the bare wold, where she  might wander for miles without seeing the gleam of a farmhouse window  or hearing even the bark of a shepherd's dog. The solitude that before  had seemed so inspiring, suddenly became oppressive loneliness. What  was she to do? Tramp on and on, perhaps in a circle, till she could go  no farther? Already it was heavy walking, and under the rocks and  bushes the drifts were deepening. Yet it would never do to sit down in  the snow. Tired as she was, she must keep moving, and while the  faintest gleam of daylight lasted she must try and find some  guide-post to civilization.    \"I wish I'd brought Jingles. I never thought of him,\" she sighed,  longing regretfully for the shaggy Irish terrier that acted watchdog  at the Parsonage. \"I wonder how soon they'll miss me at home? Not till  tea-time, I expect, and then they'll probably think I'm at the  Chambers'. Beatrice would guess where I'd gone. How furiously angry  she'll be!\"    For the first time a little awkward uncomfortable inward suggestion  began to croak that elder sisters are occasionally right, and may  even be wiser in their generation than tall girls who have entered the  Fifth. Gwen's cough, which had been hacking all day, came on much  worse, and began to hurt her chest: she wished she had brought her  _thick_ muffler. It was a subject of perennial dispute between herself  and Beatrice, and she often discarded it simply because the latter  told her to put it on. She hated to appear mollycoddlish, and  sometimes indeed did very silly things out of sheer foolhardiness. At  present she was bitterly cold. The snow had sifted inside her  galoshes, and made her feet wet, and the chilly wind was creeping down  her neck and up her sleeves, and whirling frozen flakes at her face.  No cheery tea in the Chambers' drawing-room, and no delightful chat  with Dick afterwards about photography and magic lanterns.    \"The fact of the matter is that I've been an idiot!\" she confessed to  herself. \"Anybody with an ounce of sense would have known it was too  snowy to cross the wold. I ought to have gone round by the high road.  I seemed to turn across here just out of habit.\"    Gwen could not tell how long she stumbled about. It felt like  interminable hours as she wearily dragged herself along, watching the  sky grow darker, and the landscape more and more blurred, till she  could scarcely distinguish which was snow and which was sky. At last  her aching limbs absolutely refused to carry her any farther, and she  crouched under the shelter of a big juniper bush that overhung a piece  of rock. Here at least she was out of the biting, freezing wind. The  comparative warmth made her feel sleepy. She roused herself with an  effort. To sleep in the snow, she knew, was fatal, so she fell to  rubbing her hands and feet to try and restore the circulation. All at  once she started up and shouted aloud.    In the distance she had heard a short, sharp yelp, and she reasoned  that where there was a dog, a man might possibly be following. Again  and again she called, till, to her intense relief, a \"Hallo!\" came in  answer, and she made out a snowy form moving in her direction. The dog  found her first; it bounded at her, whining and sniffing at her  skirts, then rushed away barking loudly to inform its master of her  whereabouts.    \"Can you tell me where I am? I've got lost!\" cried Gwen, wading  through a drift in her eagerness to meet her rescuer.    \"Why, you're close to our house--Rawlins' farm. Who is it? I can't see  in the dark. Miss Gascoyne? Why, whatever are you doing here all  alone?\"    He might well ask, Gwen thought, but she ignored the question. She  knew the man, for he was a parishioner, and two of his boys sang in  the choir at church.    \"Can you tell me how to get home?\" she said, with chattering teeth and  watering eyes.    \"Better come and have a sup o' tea first; you look clemmed wi' the  cold,\" he returned. \"We'll tak' you back after wi' the lantern. It's  nobbut a step to the farm.\"    He whistled to the dog and moved on, and Gwen stumbled after him,  wondering how she had missed seeing the house when it was so near. She  scarcely knew whether to pose in the light of a heroine or a culprit  as she walked into Mrs. Rawlins' kitchen, but decided to give as  guarded an account of the matter as she could. There would be  explanations in plenty when she returned to the Parsonage. She was  very glad to sit and thaw by the fire and drink hot tea, despite the  difficulty of fencing with Mrs. Rawlins' questions, that good dame  being consumed with curiosity, and not restrained by any feelings of  delicacy from catechizing her guest.    \"Yes. No, I wasn't coming back from school, it's the holidays--yes,  I'm generally with one of my sisters--no, I wasn't delivering Parish  Magazines, we sent yours by Charlie--yes, I expect my father will be  missing me. Thanks very much for the tea; I think I must be going  now,\" said Gwen, gulping her second cup and making a move.    \"Here's the lantern, Jim,\" said Mrs. Rawlins to her husband, \"and take  Miss Gascoyne round by the road; 'tain't fit to venture over the moor.  It's scarce a night for a Christian to be out--and her with that  churchyard cough, too! Goodness, gracious, how it's blowing!\"    Gwen reached"]]]
