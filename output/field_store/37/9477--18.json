When the  offensive Stamp Act first was published, the people of Charleston rose  in revolt; and the stamps for the city being stored in an armed  fortress in the bay, known as Castle Johnson, a party of a hundred and  fifty armed men went down the bay, surprised the garrison, captured  the castle, and, loading its guns, defied the authorities. Not until  the promise had been made that the stamps should be sent back to  England, did the rebellious Carolinians lay down their arms. Nor was  their peace of long duration. When the news of the battle of Lexington  reached the little Southern seaport, the people straightway cast about  for an opportunity to strike a blow against the tyranny of England.  The opportunity soon offered itself. An English sloop laden with  powder was lying at St. Augustine, Fla. Learning this, the people of  Charleston fitted out a vessel, which captured the powder-ship, and,  eluding a number of British cruisers, returned safely to Charleston  with fifteen thousand pounds of gunpowder for the colonial army. Soon  after the colonial troops took possession of the forts in the harbor,  and Charleston became a revolutionary stronghold.    Therefore, when the war authorities of Great Britain prepared to take  active, offensive measures against the seaport cities of the  rebellious colonies, Charleston was one of the first points chosen for  attack. It was on the 4th of June, 1776, that the British fleet, under  the command of the veteran admiral, Sir Peter Parker, appeared off  Charleston bar. The colonists had learned of its approach some time  before; and the town was crowded with troops, both regular and  volunteer. Two forts, Johnson and Sullivan, were erected at points  commanding the entrance to the harbor. Troops were thrown out to  oppose the advance of landing parties. The wharves were covered with  breastworks, and the streets leading up from the water-side were  barricaded. There was a great scarceness of lead for bullets; and to  supply that need the leaden sashes, in which window-panes were at that  time set, were melted down. When the fleet of the enemy appeared in  the offing, Charleston was quite ready to give the invaders a warm  reception.    Fort Sullivan was the chief work in the harbor, and against this  Parker began a vigorous cannonade early on the morning of the 28th of  June. The fort had been built of logs of palmetto wood, and was looked  upon with some distrust by its defenders, who did not know how well  that material could withstand cannon-shot; but the opening volley of  the fleet re-assured them. The balls penetrated deep in the soft,  spongy wood without detaching any of the splinters, which, in a  battle, are more dangerous than the shot themselves. The fort soon  replied to the fire of the fleet; and the thunder of three hundred  cannon rang out over the bay, while dense clouds of sulphurous smoke  hid the scene from the eager gaze of the crowds of people on the  housetops of the city.    When the stately ships of the British squadron swung into line before  the little wooden fort, there was hardly a sailor who did not take his  station without a feeling of contempt for the insignificant obstacle  that they were about to sweep from their path. But as the day wore on,  and the ceaseless cannonade seemed to have no effect on the bastions  of the fort, the case began to look serious.    \"Mind the commodore, and the fifty-gun ships,\" was the command  Moultrie gave to the gunners in the fort when the action commenced,  and right well did they heed the injunction. The quarter-decks of the  ships-of-the-line were swept clean of officers. The gunners in the  fort soon found that the fire of the enemy was doing little or no  execution, and they sighted their guns as coolly as though out for a  day's target practice. The huge iron balls crashed through the hulls  of the ships, or swept their decks, doing terrific execution. The  cable of the \"Bristol\" was shot away, and she swung round with her  stern to the fort. In this position she was raked repeatedly; her  captain was killed, and at one time not an officer remained on her  quarter-deck except the admiral Sir Peter Parker. When the conflict  ceased, this ship alone contained forty killed and seventy-one wounded  men. The other ships suffered nearly as severely. The twenty-eight-gun  ship \"Actaeon\" grounded during the course of the engagement; and when,  after ten hours' fruitless cannonading, the British abandoned the task  of reducing the fort, and determined to withdraw, she was found to be  immovable. Accordingly Admiral Parker signalled to her officer to  abandon the ship, and set her on fire. This was accordingly done; and  the ship was left with her colors flying, and her guns loaded. This  movement was observed by the Americans, who, in spite of the danger of  an explosion, boarded the ship, fired her guns at the \"Bristol,\"  loaded three boats with stores, and pulled away, leaving the \"Actaeon\"  to blow up, which she did half an hour later.    While the battle was at its hottest, and the shot and shell were  flying thick over the fort, the flagstaff was shot away; and the flag  of South Carolina, a blue ground, bearing a silver crescent, fell on  the beach outside the parapet. Sergt. William Jasper, seeing this,  leaped on the bastion, walked calmly through the storm of flying  missiles, picked up the flag, and fastened it upon a sponge-staff.  Then standing upon the highest point of the parapet, in full view of  the ships and the men in the fort, he calmly fixed the staff upright,  and returned to his place, leaving the flag proudly waving. The next  day the governor of the colony visited the fort, and seeking out the  brave sergeant, handed him a handsome sword and a lieutenant's  commission. But Jasper proved to be as modest as he was brave; for he  declined the proffered promotion, with the remark,--    \"I am not fit to keep officers' company; I am but a sergeant.\"    The complete failure of the attack upon Charleston was a bitter pill  for the English to swallow. They had brought against the raw,  untrained forces of the colony some of the finest ships of the boasted  navy of Great Britain. They had fought well and pluckily. The fact  that Sir Peter Parker was in command was in itself a guaranty that the  attack would be a spirited one; and the tremendous loss of life in the  fleet affords convincing proof that no poltroonery lurked among the  British sailors. The loss of the British during the engagement, in  killed and wounded, amounted to two hundred and twenty-five men. The  Americans had ten men killed and twenty-two wounded. Moultrie, the  commandant of the fort, says that after the battle was over they  picked up more than twelve hundred solid shot of different sizes, and  many thirteen-inch shells. Most of the shells that fell within the  fort fell into a large pool of water, which extinguished their fuses,  thus robbing them of their power for evil.    In his report of this battle, Admiral Parker fell into a queer error.  He reports that a large party of men entering the fort met a man going  out, whom they straightway hanged to a neighboring tree, in full view  of the fleet. From this the admiral concluded that there was an  incipient mutiny in the fort, and the ringleader was hanged as an  example. Col. Moultrie, however, explained this by stating that the  man hanging in the tree was simply the coat of a soldier, which had  been carried away by a cannon-shot, and left hanging in the branches.          CHAPTER VI.         THE CAREER OF PAUL JONES. -- IN COMMAND OF THE \"PROVIDENCE.\"       -- CAPTURE OF THE \"MELLISH.\" -- EXPLOITS WITH THE \"ALFRED.\"       -- IN COMMAND OF THE \"RANGER.\" -- SWEEPING THE ENGLISH       CHANNEL. -- THE DESCENT UPON WHITEHAVEN.      We have already spoken of the farcical affair between the fleet under  Ezekiel Hopkins and the English frigate \"Glasgow,\" in which the  English vessel, by superior seamanship, and taking advantage of the  blunders of the Americans, escaped capture. The primary result of this  battle was to cause the dismissal from the service of Hopkins. But his  dismissal led to the advancement of a young naval officer, whose name  became one of the most glorious in American naval annals, and whose  fame as a skilful seaman has not been tarnished by the hand of time.    [Illustration: Captain John Paul Jones Quelling The Mob At White  Haven, Scotland, Nov., 1777.]    At the time of the escape of the \"Glasgow,\" there was serving upon the  \"Alfred\" a young lieutenant, by name John Paul Jones. Jones was a  Scotchman. His rightful name was John Paul; but for some reason, never  fully understood, he had assumed the surname of Jones, and his record  under the name of Paul Jones forms one of the most glorious chapters  of American naval history. When given a lieutenant's commission in the  colonial navy, Jones was twenty-nine years old. From the day when a  lad of thirteen years he shipped for his first voyage, he had spent  his life on the ocean. He had served on peaceful merchantmen, and  in the less peaceful, but at that time equally respectable,  slave-trade. A small inheritance had enabled him to assume the station  of a Virginia gentleman; and he had become warmly attached to American  ideas and principles, and at the outbreak of the Revolution put his  services at the command of Congress. He was first offered a captain's  commission with the command of the \"Providence,\" mounting twelve guns  and carrying one hundred men. But with extraordinary modesty the young  sailor declined, saying that he hardly felt himself fitted to  discharge the duties of a first lieutenant. The lieutenant's  commission, however, he accepted; and it was in this station that with  his own hands he hoisted the first American flag to the masthead of  the \"Alfred.\""]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/2232"],[0,"The Duchess of Malfi (#16)"],[1,"     CARDINAL.  I have honours in store for thee.      BOSOLA.  There are a many ways that conduct to seeming    Honour, and some of them very dirty ones.      CARDINAL.  Throw to the devil    Thy melancholy.  The fire burns well;    What need we keep a stirring of 't, and make    A greater smother?[132] Thou wilt kill Antonio?      BOSOLA.  Yes.      CARDINAL.      Take up that body.      BOSOLA.                            I think I shall    Shortly grow the common bier for church-yards.      CARDINAL.  I will allow thee some dozen of attendants    To aid thee in the murder.      BOSOLA.  O, by no means.  Physicians that apply horse-leeches    to any rank swelling use to cut off their tails, that the blood    may run through them the faster:  let me have no train when I go    to shed blood, less it make me have a greater when I ride    to the gallows.      CARDINAL.  Come to me after midnight, to help to remove    That body to her own lodging.  I 'll give out    She died o' th' plague; 'twill breed the less inquiry    After her death.      BOSOLA.  Where 's Castruccio her husband?      CARDINAL.  He 's rode to Naples, to take possession    Of Antonio's citadel.      BOSOLA.  Believe me, you have done a very happy turn.      CARDINAL.  Fail not to come.  There is the master-key    Of our lodgings; and by that you may conceive    What trust I plant in you.      BOSOLA.                     You shall find me ready.         Exit CARDINAL.    O poor Antonio, though nothing be so needful    To thy estate as pity, yet I find    Nothing so dangerous!  I must look to my footing:    In such slippery ice-pavements men had need    To be frost-nail'd well, they may break their necks else;    The precedent 's here afore me.  How this man    Bears up in blood! seems fearless!  Why, 'tis well;    Security some men call the suburbs of hell,    Only a dead wall between.  Well, good Antonio,    I 'll seek thee out; and all my care shall be    To put thee into safety from the reach    Of these most cruel biters that have got    Some of thy blood already.  It may be,    I 'll join with thee in a most just revenge.    The weakest arm is strong enough that strikes    With the sword of justice.  Still methinks the duchess    Haunts me:  there, there!--'Tis nothing but my melancholy.    O Penitence, let me truly taste thy cup,    That throws men down only to raise them up!         Exit.             Scene III[133]           [Enter] ANTONIO and DELIO.  Echo (from the DUCHESS'S Grave)      DELIO.  Yond 's the cardinal's window.  This fortification    Grew from the ruins of an ancient abbey;    And to yond side o' th' river lies a wall,    Piece of a cloister, which in my opinion    Gives the best echo that you ever heard,    So hollow and so dismal, and withal    So plain in the distinction of our words,    That many have suppos'd it is a spirit    That answers.      ANTONIO.       I do love these ancient ruins.    We never tread upon them but we set    Our foot upon some reverend history;    And, questionless, here in this open court,    Which now lies naked to the injuries    Of stormy weather, some men lie interr'd    Lov'd the church so well, and gave so largely to 't,    They thought it should have canopied their bones    Till dooms-day.  But all things have their end;    Churches and cities, which have diseases like to men,    Must have like death that we have.      ECHO.                               Like death that we have.      DELIO.  Now the echo hath caught you.      ANTONIO.  It groan'd methought, and gave    A very deadly accent.      ECHO.                  Deadly accent.      DELIO.  I told you 'twas a pretty one.  You may make it    A huntsman, or a falconer, a musician,    Or a thing of sorrow.      ECHO.                  A thing of sorrow.      ANTONIO.  Ay, sure, that suits it best.      ECHO.                                    That suits it best.      ANTONIO.  'Tis very like my wife's voice.      ECHO.                                      Ay, wife's voice.      DELIO.  Come, let us walk further from t.    I would not have you go to the cardinal's to-night:    Do not.      ECHO.  Do not.      DELIO.  Wisdom doth not more moderate wasting sorrow    Than time.  Take time for 't; be mindful of thy safety.      ECHO.  Be mindful of thy safety.      ANTONIO.  Necessity compels me.    Make scrutiny through the passages    Of your own life, you 'll find it impossible    To fly your fate.      ECHO.              O, fly your fate!      DELIO.  Hark! the dead stones seem to have pity on you,    And give you good counsel.      ANTONIO.  Echo, I will not talk with thee,    For thou art a dead thing.      ECHO.                       Thou art a dead thing.      ANTONIO.  My duchess is asleep now,    And her little ones, I hope sweetly.  O heaven,    Shall I never see her more?      ECHO.                        Never see her more.      ANTONIO.  I mark'd not one repetition of the echo    But that; and on the sudden a clear light    Presented me a face folded in sorrow.      DELIO.  Your fancy merely.      ANTONIO.                    Come, I 'll be out of this ague,    For to live thus is not indeed to live;    It is a mockery and abuse of life.    I will not henceforth save myself by halves;    Lose all, or nothing.      DELIO.                 Your own virtue save you!    I 'll fetch your eldest son, and second you.    It may be that the sight of his own blood    Spread in so sweet a figure may beget    The more compassion.  However, fare you well.    Though in our miseries Fortune have a part,    Yet in our noble sufferings she hath none.    Contempt of pain, that we may call our own.         Exeunt.             Scene IV[134]           [Enter] CARDINAL, PESCARA, MALATESTI, RODERIGO, and GRISOLAN      CARDINAL.  You shall not watch to-night by the sick prince;    His grace is very well recover'd.      MALATESTI.  Good my lord, suffer us.      CARDINAL.                             O, by no means;    The noise, and change of object in his eye,    Doth more distract him.  I pray, all to bed;    And though you hear him in his violent fit,    Do not rise, I entreat you.      PESCARA.  So, sir; we shall not.      CARDINAL.                         Nay, I must have you promise    Upon your honours, for I was enjoin'd to 't    By himself; and he seem'd to urge it sensibly.      PESCARA.  Let our honours bind this trifle.      CARDINAL.  Nor any of your followers.      MALATESTI.  Neither.      CARDINAL.  It may be, to make trial of your promise,    When he 's asleep, myself will rise and feign    Some of his mad tricks, and cry out for help,    And feign myself in danger.      MALATESTI.  If your throat were cutting,    I 'd not come at you, now I have protested against it.      CARDINAL.  Why, I thank you.      GRISOLAN.                     'Twas a foul storm to-night.      RODERIGO.  The Lord Ferdinand's chamber shook like an osier.      MALATESTI.  'Twas nothing put pure kindness in the devil    To rock his own child.         Exeunt [all except the CARDINAL].      CARDINAL.  The reason why I would not suffer these    About my brother, is, because at midnight    I may with better privacy convey    Julia's body to her own lodging.  O, my conscience!    I would pray now; but the devil takes away my heart    For having any confidence in prayer.    About this hour I appointed Bosola    To fetch the body.  When he hath serv'd my turn,    He dies.         Exit.           [Enter BOSOLA]      BOSOLA.  Ha! 'twas the cardinal's voice; I heard him name    Bosola and my death.  Listen; I hear one's footing.           [Enter FERDINAND]      FERDINAND.  Strangling is a very quiet death.      BOSOLA.  [Aside.] Nay, then, I see I must stand upon my guard.      FERDINAND.  What say to that?  Whisper softly:  do you agree to 't?    So; it must be done i' th' dark; the cardinal would not for    a thousand pounds the doctor should see it.         Exit.      BOSOLA.  My death is plotted; here 's the consequence of murder.    We value not desert nor Christian breath,    When we know black deeds must be cur'd with death.           [Enter ANTONIO and Servant]      SERVANT.  Here stay, sir, and be confident, I pray;    I 'll fetch you a dark lantern.         Exit.      ANTONIO.  Could I take him at his prayers,    There were hope of pardon.      BOSOLA.  Fall right, my sword!--         [Stabs him.]    I 'll not give thee so much leisure as to pray.      ANTONIO.  O, I am gone!  Thou hast ended a long suit    In a minute.      BOSOLA.       What art thou?      ANTONIO.                      A most wretched thing,    That only have thy benefit in death,    To appear myself.           [Re-enter Servant with a lantern]      SERVANT.  Where are you, sir?      ANTONIO.  Very near my home.--Bosola!      SERVANT.  O, misfortune!      BOSOLA.  Smother thy pity, thou art dead else.--Antonio!    The man I would have sav'd 'bove mine own life!    We are merely the stars' tennis-balls, struck and banded    Which way please them.--O good Antonio,    I 'll whisper one thing in thy dying ear    Shall make thy heart break quickly!  Thy fair duchess    And two sweet children----      ANTONIO.                    Their very names    Kindle a little life in me.      BOSOLA.                      Are murder'd.      ANTONIO.  Some men have wish'd to die    At the hearing of sad tidings; I am glad    That I shall do 't in sadness.[135] I would not now    Wish my wounds balm'd nor heal'd, for I have no use    To put my life to.  In all our quest of greatness,    Like wanton boys whose pastime is their care,    We follow after bubbles blown in th' air.    Pleasure of life, what is 't?  Only the good hours    Of an ague; merely a preparative to rest,    To endure vexation.  I do not ask    The process of my death; only commend me    To Delio.      BOSOLA.     Break, heart!      ANTONIO.  And let my son fly the courts to princes.         [Dies.]      BOSOLA.  Thou seem'st to have lov'd"]]]
