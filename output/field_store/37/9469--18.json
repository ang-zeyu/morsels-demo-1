Dr Burton was always much interested in the Christmas-tree, and used to  contribute largely to it what he called _trash_--_i.e._, cheap fancy  articles, if he happened to be in London before Christmas-time, or money  if he did not. His mode of visiting poor people was peculiar. He no  sooner heard of any plan of benevolence towards them than he was  determined it should be immediately carried out, and utterly impatient  of all preparations. He chose to carry a basket, the heavier the better,  but would on no account enter a cottage, still less speak to an inmate.  He preferred such expeditions in the dark, that he might successfully  hide himself outside while his wife went in to distribute his bounty.    On the 8th of January 1881 a recurrence of the former symptoms again  obliged him to take to bed. On the 8th of February he was able to rise  and go down to the library.    On the 8th of March he again became ill, and towards the end of that  month had an alarming attack of bronchitis and congestion of the lungs.  Slight hope was entertained of his recovery for some days, but this  illness appeared a turning-point, and by the 8th of April he was able to  come down-stairs. No more 8ths were marked by disaster or recovery till  again the 8th of August.    During the summer Dr Burton appeared to have recovered completely. He  wrote several articles for 'Blackwood's Magazine,' and took regular  walks, first with his wife, and, when his walking power improved so as  to exceed hers, with his son. He also began to edit the literary remains  of the late Mr Edward Ellice, to whom he was joint literary executor  along with Mrs Ellice.    At the time of the General Assembly Dr Burton had the pleasure of seeing  once more his valued friend, the Rev. James White, minister of Methlick.  This gentleman had been his schoolfellow at the Grammar School in  Aberdeen. The two old friends spent a pleasant summer evening together  at Morton. On the Saturday before his own death Dr Burton learned that  of Mr White. \"Ah! so Jamie White's gone,\" he said, \"and _without the  catalogues_.\" The last part of his sentence referred to old class lists  in which Joannes Burton and Jacobus White's names appear next each  other. They believed themselves the last survivors of their Grammar  School class.    On Tuesday, 2d August, he walked into Edinburgh and out again as usual,  though his family drove in at the same time that he walked, and drove  out again also at the same time, in the hope that he would avail himself  of a seat in the pony-carriage, at least for part of the way. His  aversion to driving clung to him. He did not appear fatigued, declared  himself the better for the walk, and even next day still boasted of the  advantage which he thought he always gained from a long walk. On  Thursday, 4th August, he became very hoarse, and complained of sore  throat. On Friday these complaints were better. On Saturday, 6th, he  slept almost the whole day, rousing himself to take food when required,  and always intending to rise, but as the shades of evening fell  announcing his intention of \"making a day of it,\" and being very active  and down in good time next day.    On Sunday, 7th, he did come down as early as usual, and did not  complain, but appeared languid, lying on the sofa the greater part of  the day,--a thing he had never done before. He read and talked as usual.  He sat at table with his family at dinner for the last time. It was  observed that he looked ill, so ill that his wife resolved to send for  the doctor as soon as possible next day, which was Monday, again the  8th, of August. The night had passed quietly, but on the doctor's  arrival he pronounced the case very grave. The lungs were much  congested, and the heart's action weak. The day brought no aggravation  of the symptoms; again the night was quiet.    On Tuesday, 9th August, there was a slight improvement, which continued  throughout the night.    On Wednesday, 10th, the improvement seemed more marked till about ten  A.M. About that time a change in the countenance was observed. On the  doctor's visit about twelve he pronounced the case all but hopeless, and  five hours later life was extinct. Consciousness remained till almost  the last moment. The illness was attended by no bodily pain, little even  of uneasiness, and the mind was calm and placid throughout.    Since the beginning of illness, nine months before, the natural  irritability, or impatience of temper, had been diminishing. Dr Burton  was by no means, as all his friends seemed to suppose, a fretful or  unreasonable invalid. With but few exceptions he was gentle and grateful  to his attendants, especially to his wife. He was perfectly aware of his  own condition, though never directly told it. His friend Mr Belcombe,  the clergyman of the Episcopal Chapel at Morningside, called for him on  Tuesday, 9th August, was received by him with pleasure, and spent some  time with him. Dr Burton had been brought up an Episcopalian, and  continued attached to the Moderate party in that Church through life.    It can hardly be expected that the writer should offer a critical  estimate of one so lately dead, and so nearly related to her. In the  preceding sketch she has endeavoured to inform the public on all  particulars in which they might be supposed interested in the life of a  man who served them during life with considerable acceptance. His  voluminous works may speak for themselves, or find a more competent  exponent than the present writer. She has endeavoured to give a picture  of himself.    John Hill Burton can never have been handsome, and he so determinedly  neglected his person as to increase its natural defects. His greatest  mental defect was an almost entire want of imagination. From this cause  the characters of those nearest and dearest to him remained to his  life's end a sealed book.    He was fond of talking, and still fonder of writing, about character;  but even his liveliest pictures, such as that of De Quincey the  opium-eater, are but a collection of external habits or peculiarities,  not necessarily bearing at all on the real nature--the inner man. His  was the sort of mind which more naturally classifies than  individualises, in this agreeing with the late Mr Buckle, who  appreciated Dr Burton's historical labours, and was in his turn  appreciated by him. To both, individual character seemed a small subject  not worth study.    The characters of women, especially, were by Dr Burton all placed in the  same category. He conceived of them all as baby-worshippers,  flower-lovers, &c.--all alike.    Dr Burton was excessively kind-hearted within the limits placed by this  great want. To any sorrow or suffering which he could understand he  craved with characteristic impatience to carry immediate relief; and the  greatest enjoyment of his life, especially of its later years, was to  give pleasure to children, poor people, or the lower animals. Many  humble folks will remember the bunches of flowers he thrust silently  into their hands, and the refreshment he never failed to press on their  acceptance in his own peculiar manner.    He was liberal of money to a fault. He never refused any application  even from a street beggar. He quite allowed that these ought not to be  encouraged, but he urged that the municipality ought to take charge of  them, and prevent their appealing to the compassion of the public, who  could not, as he said, be expected to perform the disagreeable task of  disciplining vagrants at the wages of a penny a case. No printer's devil  or other chance messenger failed to receive his sixpence or shilling,  besides a comfortable meal. It was his constant custom to ask his sons  if any of their wants were unsupplied, if they required money for  furnishing their workshop or laboratory, or for any of their studies or  amusements. It is but just to them to add that the question was almost  always answered in the negative.    Many of the \"motley crew\" along with whom Dr Burton received his  education fell into difficulties in the course of their lives. An  application from one of them always met with a prompt response. To send  double the amount asked on such occasions was his rule, if money was the  object desired. In his earlier life he would also spare no trouble in  endeavouring to help these unfortunates to help themselves. As he grew  old he was less zealous, probably from being less sanguine of success,  in this service.    On Saturday the 13th of August the mortal remains of John Hill Burton  were laid beside those of his infant child in the lovely little  churchyard of Dalmeny. It had been at first intended that he should be  buried in the Dean Cemetery, where his mother and his first wife were  interred, and where his valued friend William Brodie[22] had erected a  beautiful monument over their graves; but after orders had been given to  this effect, his wife became strongly possessed by the wish to carry out  his repeatedly expressed injunction to have him laid in Dalmeny.

Of the panels and basreliefs found in 1554, some were removed  to the Villa Medici and inserted in the front of the casino, on the  garden side; others were transferred to Florence; those of 1859 have  been placed in the vestibule of the Palazzo Fiano. They are well worth  a visit.    [Illustration: The family of Augustus. Relief from the Ara Pacis, in  the Gallery of the Uffizi, Florence.]      ARA INCENDII NERONIANI. In the month of July, A. D. 65, half Rome was  destroyed by the fire of Nero. The citizens, overwhelmed by the  greatness of the calamity, and ignorant of its true cause, made a vow  for the annual celebration of expiatory sacrifices, on altars  expressly constructed for the purpose in each of the fourteen regions  of the metropolis. The vow was, however, forgotten until Domitian  claimed its fulfilment some twenty or twenty-five years later. One of  these altars, which adjoined Domitian's paternal house on the  Quirinal, has just been found near the church of S. Andrea del  Noviziato, in the foundations of the new \"Ministero della Casa  Reale.\"    The altar, six metres long by three wide, built of travertine with a  coating of marble, stands in the middle of a paved area of  considerable size. The area is lined with stone cippi, placed at an  interval of two and a half metres from one another. The following  inscription has been found engraved on two of them: \"This sacred area,  marked with stone cippi, and enclosed with a hedge, as well as the  altar which stands in the middle of it, was dedicated by the emperor  Domitian in consequence of an unfulfilled vow made by the citizens at  the time of the fire of Nero. The dedication is made subject to the  following rules: that no one shall be allowed to loiter, trade, build,  or plant trees or shrubs within the line of terminal stones; that on  August 23 of each year, the day of the Volkanalia, the magistrate  presiding over this sixth region shall sacrifice on this altar a red  calf and a pig; that he shall address to the gods the following prayer  (text missing).\" The inscription has been read twice: once towards the  end of the fifteenth century, when the cippus containing it was  removed to S. Peter's and made use of in the new building, and again  in 1644, when Pope Barberini was laying the foundations of S. Andrea  al Quirinale, one of the most graceful and pleasing churches of modern  Rome.           *       *       *       *       *    Let us now turn our attention to more imposing structures. The first  temple in the excavation of which I took part was that of Jupiter  Optimus Maximus on the Capitoline Hill.[48] Its discovery was due more  to an intuition of the truth, than to actual recognition of existing  remains. On November 7, 1875, while digging for the foundation of the  new Rotunda in the garden which divides the Conservatori palace from  that of the Caffarellis,--the residence of the German ambassador,--our  workmen came upon a piece of a colossal fluted column of Pentelic  marble, lying on a platform of squared stones, which were laid without  mortar, in a decidedly archaic style. Were we in the presence of the  remains of the famous Capitolium, or of one of the smaller temples  within the Arx? To give this query a satisfactory answer, we must  remember that the Capitoline Hill had two summits, one containing the  citadel, or Arx, the other the Temple of Jupiter Optimus Maximus, the  Capitolium. Ancient writers never use the two names promiscuously, or  apply them indifferently to either summit or to the whole hill. The  name of the hill is the _Capitoline_; not the _Capitol_, which means  exclusively the portion occupied by the great temple. Suffice it to  quote Livy's evidence (vi. 20), _ne quis in Arce aut Capitolio  habitaret_, and also the passage of Aulus Gellius (v. 12) in which the  shrine of Vedjovis is placed between the Arx and the Capitolium.    For many generations topographers tried to discover which summit was  occupied by the citadel, and which by the temple. The Italian school,  save a few exceptions, had always identified the site of the  Aracoeli with that of the temple, the Caffarelli palace with that of  the citadel. The Germans upheld the opposite theory. In these  circumstances it is not surprising that the discovery made November  7, 1875, should have excited us; because we saw at once our chance of  settling the dispute, not theoretically, but with the evidence of  facts.    The Temple of Jupiter Optimus Maximus, designed by Tarquinius Priscus,  built by Tarquinius Superbus, and dedicated in 509 B. C. by the consul  M. Horatius Pulvillus, stood on a high platform 2071/2 feet long, by  1921/2 feet broad. The front of the edifice, ornamented with three  rows of columns, faced the south. The style of the architecture was  purely Etruscan, and the intercolumniations were so wide as to require  architraves of timber. The cella was divided into three sections, the  middle one of which was sacred to Jupiter, that on the right to  Minerva, that on the left to Juno Regina; the top of the pediment was  ornamented with a terra-cotta quadriga. Of the same material was the  statue of the god, with the face painted red, and the body dressed in  a _tunica palmata_ and a _toga picta_, the work of an Etruscan artist,  Turianus of Fregenae.    In 386 B. C. it was found necessary to enlarge the platform in the  centre of which the temple stood; and as the hill was sloping, even  precipitous, on three sides, it was necessary to raise huge foundation  walls from the plain below to the level of the platform, a work  described by Pliny (xxxvi. 15, 24) as prodigious, and by Livy (vi. 4)  as one of the wonders of Rome.    On July 6, 83 B. C., four hundred and twenty-six years after its  dedication by Horatius Pulvillus, an unknown malefactor, taking  advantage of the abundance of timber used in the structure, set fire  to it, and utterly destroyed the sanctuary which for four centuries  had presided over the fates of the Roman Commonwealth. The incendiary,  less fortunate than Erostratos, remained unknown, the suspicions cast  at the time against Papirius Carbo, Scipio, Norbanus and Sulla  having proved groundless. He probably belonged to the faction of  Marius, because we know that Marius himself laid hands on the  half-charred ruins of the temple, and pillaged several thousand pounds  of gold.    [Illustration: _R. Lanciani del._  THE WESTERN SUMMIT OF THE CAPITOLINE HILL]    Sulla the dictator undertook the reconstruction of the Capitolium, for  which purpose he caused some columns of the temple of the Olympian  Jupiter to be removed from Athens to Rome. Sulla's work was continued  by Lutatius Catulus, and finished by Julius Caesar in 46 B. C. A second  restoration took place in the year 9 B. C. under Augustus, a third A.  D. 74 under Vespasian, and the last in the year 82, under Domitian. It  was therefore evident that, if the temple had not been literally  obliterated since that time, its remains would show the  characteristics of the age of Domitian, who is known to have made use  of Pentelic marble in his reconstruction. We should also find these  remains in the middle of a platform of the time of the kings,  surrounded by foundation walls of the time of the republic. The  accompanying plan shows how perfectly the remains discovered on the  southwestern summit of the Capitoline Hill corresponded to this  theory.    The platform, in the shape of a parallelogram, 183 feet broad and a  few feet longer, is built of roughly squared blocks of _capellaccio_,  exactly like certain portions of the Servian walls. Its area and  height were reduced by one third, when the Caffarellis built their  palace, in 1680. A sketch taken at that time by Fabretti and published  in his volume \"De Columna Trajana\" shows that fourteen tiers of stone  have disappeared. A portion of the same platform, discovered in 1865,  by Herr Schloezer, Prussian minister to Pius IX., is represented on  the next page.    The foundation walls, which Pliny and Livy enumerate among the wonders  of Rome, have been, and are still being, discovered on the three  sides of the hill which face the Piazza della Consolazione, the Piazza  Montanara, and the Via di Torre de' Specchi. They are built of blocks  of red tufa, with facing of travertine. The travertine facing is  covered with inscriptions set up in honor of the great divinity of  Rome by the kings and nations of the whole world. One cannot read  these historical documents[49] without acquiring a new sense of the  magnitude and power of the city.    [Illustration: View of the Platform of the Temple of Jupiter.]    These inscriptions are found mostly at the foot of the substructure,  on the side towards the Piazza della Consolazione. The latest, found  in the foundations of the Palazzo Moroni, contain messages of  friendship and gratitude from kings Mithradates Philopator and  Mithradates Philadelphos, of Pontus, from Ariobarzanes Philoromaeus of  Cappadocia and Athenais his queen, from the province of Lycia, from  some townships of the province of Caria, etc.    As for the remains of the temple itself, the colossal column  discovered November 7, 1875, in the Conservatori garden, is not the  only one saved from the wreck. Flaminio Vacca, the sculptor and  amateur-archaeologist of the sixteenth century, says: \"Upon the  Tarpeian Rock, behind the Palazzo de' Conservatori, several pillars of  Pentelic marble (_marmo statuale_) were lately found. Their capitals  are so enormous that out of one of them I have carved the lion now in  the Villa Medici. The others were used by Vincenzo de Rossi to carve  the prophets and other statues which adorn the chapel of cardinal Cesi  in the church of S. Maria della Pace. I believe the columns belonged  to the Temple of Jupiter. No fragments of the entablature were found:  but as the"]]]
