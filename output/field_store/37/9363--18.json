The sour stink of incense smarted  in my nostrils, and I could hear the yelping of the Ya-men as they  leaped and rustled down the alley, their cold and poisonous eyes  searching out the recess where I crouched with the girl.    \"Here,\" she panted, \"stand close to me on the stone--\" I drew back,  startled.    \"Oh, don't stop to argue,\" she whimpered. \"Come _here_!\"    \"_Hai-ai!_ Earthman! There he is!\"    The girl's arms flung round me again. I felt her slight, hard body  pressing on mine and she literally hauled me toward the pattern of  stones at the center of the shrine. I wouldn't have been human if I  hadn't caught her closer yet.    The world reeled. The street disappeared in a cone of spinning lights,  stars danced crazily, and I plunged down through a widening gulf of  empty space, locked in the girl's arms. I fell, spun, plunged head over  heels through tilting lights and shadows that flung us through  eternities of freefall. The yelping of the Ya-men whirled away in  unimaginable distances, and for a second I felt the unmerciful blackout  of a power dive, with blood breaking from my nostrils and filling my  mouth.          CHAPTER ELEVEN      Lights flared in my eyes.    I was standing solidly on my feet in the street-shrine, but the street  was gone. Coils of incense still smudged the air. The God squatted  toadlike in his recess. The girl was hanging limp, locked in my clenched  arms. As the floor straightened under my feet I staggered, thrown off  balance by the sudden return of the girl's weight, and grabbed blindly  for support.    \"Give her to me,\" said a voice, and the girl's sagging body was lifted  from my arms. A strong hand grasped my elbow. I found a chair beneath my  knees and sank gratefully into it.    \"The transmission isn't smooth yet between such distant terminals,\" the  voice remarked. \"I see Miellyn has fainted again. A weakling, the girl,  but useful.\"    I spat blood, trying to get the room in focus. For I was inside a room,  a room of some translucent substance, windowless, a skylight high above  me, through which pink daylight streamed. Daylight--and it had been  midnight in Charin! I'd come halfway around the planet in a few seconds!    From somewhere I heard the sound of hammering, tiny, bell-like  hammering, the chiming of a fairy anvil. I looked up and saw a man--a  man?--watching me.    On Wolf you see all kinds of human, half-human and nonhuman life, and I  consider myself something of an expert on all three. But I had never  seen anyone, or anything, who so closely resembled the human and so  obviously wasn't. He, or it, was tall and lean, man-shaped but oddly  muscled, a vague suggestion of something less than human in the lean  hunch of his posture.    Manlike, he wore green tight-fitting trunks and a shirt of green fur  that revealed bulging biceps where they shouldn't be, and angular planes  where there should have been swelling muscles. The shoulders were high,  the neck unpleasantly sinuous, and the face, a little narrower than  human, was handsomely arrogant, with a kind of wary alert mischief that  was the least human thing about him.    He bent, tilted the girl's inert body on to a divan of some sort, and  turned his back on her, lifting his hand in an impatient, and  unpleasantly reminiscent, gesture.    The tinkling of the little hammers stopped as if a switch had been  disconnected.    \"Now,\" said the nonhuman, \"we can talk.\"    Like the waif, he spoke Shainsan, and spoke it with a better accent than  any nonhuman I had ever known--so well that I looked again to be  certain. I wasn't too dazed to answer in the same tongue, but I couldn't  keep back a spate of questions:    \"What happened? Who are you? What is this place?\"    The nonhuman waited, crossing his hands--quite passable hands, if you  didn't look too closely at what should have been nails--and bent forward  in a sketchy gesture.    \"Do not blame Miellyn. She acted under orders. It was imperative you be  brought here tonight, and we had reason to believe you might ignore an  ordinary summons. You were clever at evading our surveillance, for a  time. But there would not be two Dry-towners in Charin tonight who would  dare the Ghost Wind. Your reputation does you justice, Rakhal Sensar.\"    _Rakhal Sensar!_ Once again Rakhal!    Shaken, I pulled a rag from my pocket and wiped blood from my mouth. I'd  figured out, in Shainsa, why the mistake was logical. And here in Charin  I'd been hanging around in Rakhal's old haunts, covering his old trails.  Once again, mistaken identity was natural.    Natural or not, I wasn't going to deny it. If these were Rakhal's  enemies, my real identity should be kept as an ace in reserve which  might--just might--get me out alive again. If they were his friends ...  well, I could only hope that no one who knew him well by sight would  walk in on me.    \"We knew,\" the nonhuman continued, \"that if you remained where you  were, the _Terranan_ Cargill would have made his arrest. We know about  your quarrel with Cargill, among other things, but we did not consider  it necessary that you should fall into his hands at present.\"    I was puzzled. \"I still don't understand. Exactly where am I?\"    \"This is the mastershrine of Nebran.\"    _Nebran!_    The stray pieces of the puzzle suddenly jolted into place. Kyral had  warned me, not knowing he was doing it. I hastily imitated the gesture  Kyral had made, gabbling a few words of an archaic charm.    Like every Earthman who's lived on Wolf more than a tourist season, I'd  seen faces go blank and impassive at mention of the Toad God. Rumor made  his spies omnipresent, his priests omniscient, his anger all-powerful. I  had believed about a tenth of what I had heard, or less.    The Terran Empire has little to say to planetary religions, and Nebran's  cult is a remarkably obscure one, despite the street-shrines on every  corner. Now I was in his mastershrine, and the device which had brought  me here was beyond doubt a working model of a matter transmitter.    A matter transmitter, a working model--the words triggered memory.  Rakhal was after it.    \"And who,\" I asked slowly, \"are you, Lord?\"    The green-clad creature hunched thin shoulders again in a ceremonious  gesture. \"I am called Evarin. Humble servant of Nebran and yourself,\" he  added, but there was no humility in his manner. \"I am called the  Toymaker.\"    _Evarin._ That was another name given weight by rumor. A breath of  gossip in a thieves market. A scrawled word on smudged paper. A blank  folder in Terran Intelligence. Another puzzle-piece snapped into  place--_Toymaker_!    The girl on the divan sat up suddenly passing slim hands over her  disheveled hair. \"Did I faint, Evarin? I had to fight to get him into  the stone, and the patterns were not set straight in that terminal. You  must send one of the Little Ones to set them to rights. Toymaker, you  are not listening to me.\"    \"Stop chattering, Miellyn,\" said Evarin indifferently. \"You brought him  here, and that is all that matters. You aren't hurt?\"    Miellyn pouted and looked ruefully at her bare bruised feet, patted the  wrinkles in her ragged frock with fastidious fingers. \"My poor feet,\"  she mourned, \"they are black and blue with the cobbles and my hair is  filled with sand and tangles! Toymaker, what way was this to send me to  entice a man? Any man would have come quickly, quickly, if he had seen  me looking lovely, but you--you send me in rags!\"    She stamped a small bare foot. She was not merely as young as she had  looked in the street. Though immature and underdeveloped by Terran  standards, she had a fair figure for a Dry-town woman. Her rags fell now  in graceful folds. Her hair was spun black glass, and I--I saw what the  rags and the confusion in the filthy street had kept me from seeing  before.    It was the girl of the spaceport cafe, the girl who had appeared and  vanished in the eerie streets of Canarsa.    Evarin was regarding her with what, in a human, might have been rueful  impatience. He said, \"You know you enjoyed yourself, as always, Miellyn.  Run along and make yourself beautiful again, little nuisance.\"    The girl danced out of the room, and I was just as glad to see her go.  The Toymaker motioned to me.    \"This way,\" he directed, and led me through a different door. The  offstage hammering I had heard, tiny bell tones like a fairy xylophone,  began again as the door opened, and we passed into a workroom which made  me remember nursery tales from a half-forgotten childhood on Terra. For  the workers were tiny, gnarled _trolls_!    They were _chaks_. _Chaks_ from the polar mountains, dwarfed and furred  and half-human, with witchlike faces and great golden eyes, and I had  the curious feeling that if I looked hard enough I would see the little  toy-seller they had hunted out of the Kharsa. I didn't look. I figured I  was in enough trouble already.    Tiny hammers pattered on miniature anvils in a tinkling, jingling chorus  of musical clinks and taps. Golden eyes focused like lenses over winking  jewels and gimcracks. Busy elves. Makers of toys!    Evarin jerked his shoulders with an imperative gesture. I followed him  through a fairy workroom, but could not refrain from casting a lingering  look at the worktables. A withered leprechaun set eyes into the head of  a minikin hound. Furred fingers worked precious metals into invisible  filigree for the collarpiece of a dancing doll. Metallic feathers were  thrust with clockwork precision into the wings of a skeleton bird no  longer than my fingernail. The nose of the hound wabbled and sniffed,  the bird's wings quivered, the eyes of the little dancer followed my  footsteps.    Toys?    \"This way,\" Evarin rapped, and a door slid shut behind us. The clinks  and taps grew faint, fainter, but never ceased.    My face must have betrayed more than"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/19734"],[0,"The Fairy Book (#16)"],[1,"heads, had heard of the death of his two kinsmen, and  was come to take his revenge on Jack; and that he was now within a  mile of the house, the people flying before him like chaff before the  wind. At this news the very boldest of the guests trembled; but Jack  drew his sword, and said, \"Let him come, I have a rod for him also.  Pray, ladies and gentlemen, do me the favour to walk into the garden,  and you shall soon behold the giant's defeat and death.\"    To this they all agreed, and heartily wished him success in his  dangerous attempt.    The knight's house stood in the middle of a moat, thirty feet deep and  twenty wide, over which lay a drawbridge. Jack set men to work, to cut  the bridge on both sides, almost to the middle, and then dressed  himself in his coat of darkness, and went against the giant with his  sword of sharpness. As he came close to him, though the giant could  not see him for his invisible coat, yet he found some danger was near,  which made him cry out:--        \"Fa, fe, fi, fo, fum,      I smell the blood of an Englishman;      Let him be alive, or let him be dead,      I'll grind his bones to make me bread.\"    \"Say you so, my friend?\" said Jack; \"you are a monstrous miller,  indeed!\"    \"Art thou,\" cried the giant, \"the villain that killed my kinsmen? Then  I will tear thee with my teeth, and grind thy bones to powder.\"    \"You must catch me first,\" said Jack; and throwing off his coat of  darkness, and putting on his shoes of swiftness, he began to run, the  giant following him like a walking castle, making the earth shake at  every step.    Jack led him round and round the walls of the house, that the company  might see the monster; then, to finish the work, he ran over the  drawbridge, the giant going after him with his club: but when he came  to the middle, where the bridge had been cut on both sides, the great  weight of his body made it break, and he tumbled into the water, where  he rolled about like a large whale. Jack now stood by the side of the  moat, and laughed and jeered at him, saying, \"I think you told me you  would grind my bones to powder; when will you begin?\"    The giant foamed at both his horrid mouths with fury, and plunged  from side to side of the moat; but he could not get out to have  revenge on his little foe. At last Jack ordered a cart-rope to be  brought to him; he then drew it over his two heads, and by the help of  a team of horses, dragged him to the edge of the moat, where he cut  off his heads: and before he either ate or drank, sent them both to  the court of King Arthur. He then went back to the table with the  company, and the rest of the day was spent in mirth and good cheer.    After staying with the knight for some time, Jack grew weary of such  an idle life, and set out again in search of new adventures. He went  over hills and dales without meeting any, till he came to the foot of  a very high mountain. Here he knocked at the door of a small and  lonely house, and an old man, with a head as white as snow, let him  in.    \"Good father,\" said Jack, \"can you lodge a traveller who has lost his  way?\"    \"Yes,\" said the hermit, \"I can, if you will accept such fare as my  poor house affords.\"    Jack entered, and the old man set before him some bread and fruit for  his supper. When Jack had eaten as much as he chose, the hermit said:  \"My son, I know you are the famous conqueror of giants; now, at the  top of this mountain is an enchanted castle, kept by a giant named  Galligantus, who, by the help of a vile magician, gets many knights  into his castle, where he changes them into the shape of beasts. Above  all, I lament the hard fate of a duke's daughter, whom they seized as  she was walking in her father's garden, and brought hither through the  air in a chariot drawn by two fiery dragons, and turned her into the  shape of a deer. Many knights have tried to destroy the enchantment  and deliver her, yet none have been able to do it, by reason of two  fiery griffins, who guard the gate of the castle, and destroy all who  come nigh; but as you, my son, have an invisible coat, you may pass by  them without being seen; and on the gates of the castle you will find  engraved by what means the enchantment may be broken.\"    Jack promised that in the morning, at the risk of his life, he would  break the enchantment; and after a sound sleep, he arose early, put on  his invisible coat, and got ready for the attempt. When he had climbed  to the top of the mountain, he saw the two fiery griffins; but he  passed between them without the least fear of danger for they could  not see him because of his invisible coat. On the castle-gate he found  a golden trumpet, under which were written these lines:--        \"Whoever can this trumpet blow,      Shall cause the giant's overthrow.\"    As soon as Jack had read this, he seized the trumpet, and blew a  shrill blast, which made the gates fly open, and the very castle  itself tremble. The giant and the conjuror now knew that their wicked  course was at an end, and they stood biting their thumbs and shaking  with fear. Jack with his sword of sharpness, soon killed the giant,  and the magician was then carried away by a whirlwind. All the  knights and beautiful ladies, who had been changed into birds and  beasts, returned to their proper shapes. The castle vanished away like  smoke, and the head of the giant Galligantus was sent to King Arthur.  The knights and ladies rested that night at the old man's hermitage,  and the next day they set out for the court. Jack then went up to the  king, and gave his majesty an account of all his fierce battles.  Jack's fame had spread through the whole country; and at the king's  desire, the duke gave him his daughter in marriage, to the joy of all  the kingdom. After this, the king gave him a large estate, on which he  and his lady lived the rest of their days in joy and content.          TOM THUMB.      In the days of King Arthur, Merlin, the most learned enchanter of his  time, was on a journey; and being very weary, stopped one day at the  cottage of an honest ploughman to ask for refreshment. The ploughman's  wife, with great civility, immediately brought him some milk in a  wooden bowl, and some brown bread on a wooden platter. Merlin could  not help observing, that although everything within the cottage was  particularly neat and clean, and in good order, the ploughman and his  wife had the most sorrowful air imaginable: so he questioned them on  the cause of their melancholy, and learned that they were very  miserable because they had no children. The poor woman declared, with  tears in her eyes, that she should be the happiest creature in the  world, if she had a son, although he were no bigger than his father's  thumb. Merlin was much amused with the notion of a boy no bigger than  a man's thumb; and as soon as he returned home, he sent for the queen  of the fairies (with whom he was very intimate), and related to her  the desire of the ploughman and his wife to have a son the size of his  father's thumb. She liked the plan exceedingly, and declared their  wish should be speedily granted. Accordingly, the ploughman's wife  had a son, who in a few minutes grew as tall as his father's thumb.  The queen of the fairies came in at the window as the mother was  sitting up in bed admiring the child. Her majesty kissed the infant,  and, giving it the name of Tom Thumb, immediately summoned several  fairies from Fairyland, to clothe her new little favourite:--        \"An oak-leaf hat he had for his crown,      His shirt it was by spiders spun:      With doublet wove of thistledown,      His trousers up with points were done;      His stockings, of apple-rind, they tie      With eye-lash pluck'd from his mother's eye:      His shoes were made of a mouse's skin,      Nicely tann'd with hair within.\"    Tom was never any bigger than his father's thumb, which was not a  large thumb neither; but as he grew older, he became very cunning, for  which his mother did not sufficiently correct him: and by this ill  quality he was often brought into difficulties. For instance, when he  had learned to play with other boys for cherry-stones, and had lost  all his own, he used to creep into the boys' bags, fill his pockets,  and come out again to play. But one day as he was getting out of a bag  of cherry-stones, the boy to whom it belonged chanced to see him.    \"Ah, ha, my little Tom Thumb!\" said he, \"have I caught you at your bad  tricks at last? Now I will reward you for thieving.\" Then drawing the  string tight round his neck, and shaking the bag, the cherry-stones  bruised Tom's legs, thighs, and body sadly; which made him beg to be  let out, and promise never to be guilty of such things any more.    Shortly afterwards Tom's mother was making a batter-pudding, and that  he might see how she mixed it, he climbed on the edge of the bowl; but  his foot happening to slip, he fell over head and ears into the  batter, and his mother, not observing him, stirred him into the  pudding, and popped him into the pot to boil. The hot water made Tom  kick and struggle; and his mother, seeing the pudding jump up and down  in such a furious manner, thought it was bewitched; and a tinker  coming by just at the time, she quickly gave him the pudding; he put  it into his budget, and walked on.    As soon as Tom could get the batter out of his mouth, he began to cry  aloud, which so frightened the poor tinker, that he flung the pudding  over the hedge, and ran away from it as fast as he could. The pudding  being broken to pieces by the fall, Tom was released, and walked home  to his mother, who gave him a kiss and put him to bed.    Tom Thumb's mother once took him with her when she went to milk the  cow; and it being a very windy day, she tied him with a needleful of  thread to a thistle, that he might not be blown away. The cow, liking  his oak-leaf hat, took him and the thistle up at one mouthful."]]]
