While the little  asteroid, whose diameter is estimated to be in the neighborhood of  twenty or twenty-five miles, was being assiduously watched and  photographed during its opposition in the winter of 1900-1901, several  observers discovered that its light was variable to the extent of more  than a whole magnitude; some said as much as two magnitudes. When it is  remembered that an increase of one stellar magnitude means an accession  of light in the ratio of 2.5 to 1, and an increase of two magnitudes an  accession of 6.25 to 1, the significance of such variations as Eros  exhibited becomes immediately apparent. The shortness of the period  within which the cycle of changes occurred, about two hours and a half,  made the variation more noticeable, and at the same time suggested a  ready explanation, viz., that the asteroid was rapidly turning on its  axis, a thing, in itself, quite in accordance with the behavior of other  celestial bodies and naturally to be expected.    But careful observation showed that there were marked irregularities in  the light fluctuations, indicating that Eros either had a very strange  distribution of light and dark areas covering its surface, or that  instead of being a globular body it was of some extremely irregular  shape, so that as it rotated it presented successively larger and  smaller reflecting surfaces toward the sun and the earth. One  interesting suggestion was that the little planet is in reality double,  the two components revolving around their common center of gravity, like  a close binary star, and mutually eclipsing one another. But this theory  seems hardly competent to explain the very great fluctuation in light,  and a better one, probably, is that suggested by Prof. E.C. Pickering,  that Eros is shaped something like a dumb-bell.    We can picture such a mass, in imagination, tumbling end over end in its  orbit so as to present at one moment the broad sides of both bells,  together with their connecting neck, toward the sun, and, at the same  time, toward the observer on the earth, and, at another moment, only the  end of one of the bells, the other bell and the neck being concealed in  shadow. In this way the successive gain and loss of sixfold in the  amount of light might be accounted for. Owing to the great distance the  real form of the asteroid is imperceptible even with powerful  telescopes, but the effect of a change in the amount of reflecting  surface presented produces, necessarily, an alternate waxing and waning  of the light. As far as the fluctuations are concerned, they might also  be explained by supposing that the shape of the asteroid is that of a  flat disk, rotating about one of its larger diameters so as to present,  alternately, its edge and its broadside to the sun. And, perhaps, in  order completely to account for all the observed eccentricities of the  light of Eros, the irregularity of form may have to be supplemented by  certain assumptions as to the varying reflective capacity of different  parts of the misshapen mass.    The invaluable Harvard photographs show that long before Eros was  recognized as an asteroid its light variations had been automatically  registered on the plates. Some of the plates, Prof. E.C. Pickering says,  had had an exposure of an hour or more, and, owing to its motion, Eros  had formed a trail on each of these plates, which in some cases showed  distinct variations in brightness. Differences in the amount of  variation at different times will largely depend upon the position of  the earth with respect to the axis of rotation.    Another interesting deduction may be made from the changes that the  light of Eros undergoes. We have already remarked that one of the larger  asteroids, and the one which appears to the eye as the most brilliant  of all, Vesta, has been suspected of variability, but not so extensive  as that of Eros. Olbers, at the beginning of the last century, was of  the opinion that Vesta's variations were due to its being not a globe  but an angular mass. So he was led by a similar phenomenon to precisely  the same opinion about Vesta that has lately been put forth concerning  Eros. The importance of this coincidence is that it tends to revive a  remarkable theory of the origin of the asteroids which has long been in  abeyance, and, in the minds of many, perhaps discredited.    This theory, which is due to Olbers, begins with the startling  assumption that a planet, perhaps as large as Mars, formerly revolving  in an orbit situated between the orbits of Mars and Jupiter, was  destroyed by an explosion! Although, at first glance, such a catastrophe  may appear too wildly improbable for belief, yet it was not the  improbability of a world's blowing up that led to a temporary  abandonment of Olbers's bold theory. The great French mathematician  Lagrange investigated the explosive force \"which would be necessary to  detach a fragment of matter from a planet revolving at a given distance  from the sun,\" and published the results in the Connaissance des Temps  for 1814.    \"Applying his results to the earth, Lagrange found that if the velocity  of the detached fragment exceeded that of a cannon ball in the  proportion of 121 to 1 the fragment would become a comet with a direct  motion; but if the velocity rose in the proportion of 156 to 1 the  motion of the comet would be retrograde. If the velocity was less than  in either of these cases the fragment would revolve as a planet in an  elliptic orbit. For any other planet besides the earth the velocity of  explosion corresponding to the different cases would vary in the inverse  ratio of the square root of the mean distance. It would therefore  manifestly be less as the planet was more distant from the sun. In the  case of each of the four smaller planets (only the four asteroids,  Ceres, Pallas, Juno, and Vesta, were known at that time), the velocity  of explosion indicated by their observed motion would be less than  twenty times the velocity of a cannon ball.\"[6]    [Footnote 6: Grant's History of Physical Astronomy, p. 241.]    Instead, then, of being discredited by its assumption of so strange a  catastrophe, Olbers's theory fell into desuetude because of its apparent  failure to account for the position of the orbits of many of the  asteroids after a large number of those bodies had been discovered. He  calculated that the orbits of all the fragments of his exploded planet  would have nearly equal mean distances, and a common point of  intersection in the heavens, through which every fragment of the  original mass would necessarily pass in each revolution. At first the  orbits of the asteroids discovered seemed to answer to these conditions,  and Olbers was even able to use his theory as a means of predicting the  position of yet undetected asteroids. Only Ceres and Pallas had been  discovered when he put forth his theory, but when Juno and Vesta were  found they fell in with his predictions so well that the theory was  generally regarded as being virtually established; while the  fluctuations in the light of Vesta, as we have before remarked, led  Olbers to assert that that body was of a fragmental shape, thus strongly  supporting his explosion hypothesis.    Afterward, when the orbits of many asteroids had been investigated, the  soundness of Olbers's theory began to be questioned. The fact that the  orbits did not all intersect at a common point could easily be disposed  of, as Professor Newcomb has pointed out, by simply placing the date of  the explosion sufficiently far back, say millions of years ago, for the  secular changes produced by the attraction of the larger planets would  effectively mix up the orbits. But when the actual effects of these  secular changes were calculated for particular asteroids the result  seemed to show that \"the orbits could never have intersected unless some  of them have in the meantime been altered by the attraction of the  small planets on each other. Such an action is not impossible, but it is  impossible to determine it, owing to the great number of these bodies  and our ignorance of their masses.\"[7]    [Footnote 7: Popular Astronomy, by Simon Newcomb, p. 335.]    Yet the theory has never been entirely thrown out, and now that the  discovery of the light fluctuations of Eros lends support to Olbers's  assertion of the irregular shape of some of the asteroids, it is very  interesting to recall what so high an authority as Professor Young said  on the subject before the discovery of Eros:    \"It is true, as has often been urged, that this theory in its original  form, as presented by Olbers, can not be correct. No _single_ explosion  of a planet could give rise to the present assemblage of orbits, nor is  it possible that even the perturbations of Jupiter could have converted  a set of orbits originally all crossing at one point (the point of  explosion) into the present tangle. The smaller orbits are so small  that, however turned about, they lie wholly inside the larger and can  not be made to intersect them. If, however, we admit a _series_ of  explosions, this difficulty is removed; and if we grant an explosion at  all, there seems to be nothing improbable in the hypothesis that the  fragments formed by the bursting of the parent mass would carry away  within themselves the same forces and reactions which caused the  original bursting, so that they themselves would be likely enough to  explode at some time in their later history.\"[8]    [Footnote 8: General Astronomy, by Charles A. Young. Revised edition,  1898, p. 372.]    The rival theory of the origin of the asteroids is that which assumes  that the planetary ring originally left off from the contracting solar  nebula between the orbits of Mars and Jupiter was so violently perturbed  by the attraction of the latter planet that, instead of being shaped  into a single globe, it was broken up into many"]]]
