Gravely perturbed, he bitterly condemned the disastrous leniency of his  predecessor, Haji Mirza Aqasi, which had brought matters to such a pass. A  more drastic and still more exemplary punishment, he felt, must now be  administered to what he regarded as an abomination of heresy which was  polluting the civil and ecclesiastical institutions of the realm. Nothing  short, he believed, of the extinction of the life of Him Who was the  fountain-head of so odious a doctrine and the driving force behind so  dynamic a movement could stem the tide that had wrought such havoc  throughout the land.    The siege of Zanjan was still in progress when he, dispensing with an  explicit order from his sovereign, and acting independently of his  counsellors and fellow-ministers, dispatched his order to Prince Hamzih  Mirza, the Hi_sh_matu'd-Dawlih, the governor of A_dh_irbayjan, instructing  him to execute the Bab. Fearing lest the infliction of such condign  punishment in the capital of the realm would set in motion forces he might  be powerless to control, he ordered that his Captive be taken to Tabriz,  and there be done to death. Confronted with a flat refusal by the  indignant Prince to perform what he regarded as a flagitious crime, the  Amir-Nizam commissioned his own brother, Mirza Hasan _Kh_an, to execute  his orders. The usual formalities designed to secure the necessary  authorization from the leading mujtahids of Tabriz were hastily and easily  completed. Neither Mulla Muhammad-i-Mamaqani, however, who had penned the  Bab's death-warrant on the very day of His examination in Tabriz, nor Haji  Mirza Baqir, nor Mulla Murtada-Quli, to whose houses their Victim was  ignominiously led by the farra_sh_-ba_sh_i, by order of the Grand Vizir,  condescended to meet face to face their dreaded Opponent.    Immediately before and soon after this humiliating treatment meted out to  the Bab two highly significant incidents occurred, incidents that cast an  illuminating light on the mysterious circumstances surrounding the opening  phase of His martyrdom. The farra_sh_-ba_sh_i had abruptly interrupted the  last conversation which the Bab was confidentially having in one of the  rooms of the barracks with His amanuensis Siyyid Husayn, and was drawing  the latter aside, and severely rebuking him, when he was thus addressed by  his Prisoner: \"Not until I have said to him all those things that I wish  to say can any earthly power silence Me. Though all the world be armed  against Me, yet shall it be powerless to deter Me from fulfilling, to the  last word, My intention.\" To the Christian Sam _Kh_an--the colonel of the  Armenian regiment ordered to carry out the execution--who, seized with fear  lest his act should provoke the wrath of God, had begged to be released  from the duty imposed upon him, the Bab gave the following assurance:  \"Follow your instructions, and if your intention be sincere, the Almighty  is surely able to relieve you of your perplexity.\"    Sam _Kh_an accordingly set out to discharge his duty. A spike was driven  into a pillar which separated two rooms of the barracks facing the square.  Two ropes were fastened to it from which the Bab and one of his disciples,  the youthful and devout Mirza Muhammad-'Ali-i-Zunuzi, surnamed Anis, who  had previously flung himself at the feet of his Master and implored that  under no circumstances he be sent away from Him, were separately  suspended. The firing squad ranged itself in three files, each of two  hundred and fifty men. Each file in turn opened fire until the whole  detachment had discharged its bullets. So dense was the smoke from the  seven hundred and fifty rifles that the sky was darkened. As soon as the  smoke had cleared away the astounded multitude of about ten thousand  souls, who had crowded onto the roof of the barracks, as well as the tops  of the adjoining houses, beheld a scene which their eyes could scarcely  believe.    The Bab had vanished from their sight! Only his companion remained, alive  and unscathed, standing beside the wall on which they had been suspended.  The ropes by which they had been hung alone were severed. \"The  Siyyid-i-Bab has gone from our sight!\" cried out the bewildered  spectators. A frenzied search immediately ensued. He was found, unhurt and  unruffled, in the very room He had occupied the night before, engaged in  completing His interrupted conversation with His amanuensis. \"I have  finished My conversation with Siyyid Husayn\" were the words with which the  Prisoner, so providentially preserved, greeted the appearance of the  farra_sh_-ba_sh_i, \"Now you may proceed to fulfill your intention.\"  Recalling the bold assertion his Prisoner had previously made, and shaken  by so stunning a revelation, the farra_sh_-ba_sh_i quitted instantly the  scene, and resigned his post.    Sam _Kh_an, likewise, remembering, with feelings of awe and wonder, the  reassuring words addressed to him by the Bab, ordered his men to leave the  barracks immediately, and swore, as he left the courtyard, never again,  even at the cost of his life, to repeat that act. Aqa Jan-i-_Kh_amsih,  colonel of the body-guard, volunteered to replace him. On the same wall  and in the same manner the Bab and His companion were again suspended,  while the new regiment formed in line and opened fire upon them. This  time, however, their breasts were riddled with bullets, and their bodies  completely dissected, with the exception of their faces which were but  little marred. \"O wayward generation!\" were the last words of the Bab to  the gazing multitude, as the regiment prepared to fire its volley, \"Had  you believed in Me every one of you would have followed the example of  this youth, who stood in rank above most of you, and would have willingly  sacrificed himself in My path. The day will come when you will have  recognized Me; that day I shall have ceased to be with you.\"    Nor was this all. The very moment the shots were fired a gale of  exceptional violence arose and swept over the city. From noon till night a  whirlwind of dust obscured the light of the sun, and blinded the eyes of  the people. In _Sh_iraz an \"earthquake,\" foreshadowed in no less weighty a  Book than the Revelation of St. John, occurred in 1268 A.H. which threw  the whole city into turmoil and wrought havoc amongst its people, a havoc  that was greatly aggravated by the outbreak of cholera, by famine and  other afflictions. In that same year no less than two hundred and fifty of  the firing squad, that had replaced Sam _Kh_an's regiment, met their  death, together with their officers, in a terrible earthquake, while the  remaining five hundred suffered, three years later, as a punishment for  their mutiny, the same fate as that which their hands had inflicted upon  the Bab. To insure that none of them had survived, they were riddled with  a second volley, after which their bodies, pierced with spears and lances,  were exposed to the gaze of the people of Tabriz. The prime instigator of  the Bab's death, the implacable Amir-Nizam, together with his brother, his  chief accomplice, met their death within two years of that savage act.    On the evening of the very day of the Bab's execution, which fell on the  ninth of July 1850 (28th of _Sh_a'ban 1266 A.H.), during the thirty-first  year of His age and the seventh of His ministry, the mangled bodies were  transferred from the courtyard of the barracks to the edge of the moat  outside the gate of the city. Four companies, each consisting of ten  sentinels, were ordered to keep watch in turn over them. On the following  morning the Russian Consul in Tabriz visited the spot, and ordered the  artist who had accompanied him to make a drawing of the remains as they  lay beside the moat. In the middle of the following night a follower of  the Bab, Haji Sulayman _Kh_an, succeeded, through the instrumentality of a  certain Haji Allah-Yar, in removing the bodies to the silk factory owned  by one of the believers of Milan, and laid them, the next day, in a  specially made wooden casket, which he later transferred to a place of  safety. Meanwhile the mullas were boastfully proclaiming from the pulpits  that, whereas the holy body of the Immaculate Imam would be preserved from  beasts of prey and from all creeping things, this man's body had been  devoured by wild animals. No sooner had the news of the transfer of the  remains of the Bab and of His fellow-sufferer been communicated to  Baha'u'llah than He ordered that same Sulayman _Kh_an to bring them to  Tihran, where they were taken to the Imam-Zadih-Hasan, from whence they  were removed to different places, until the time when, in pursuance of  'Abdu'l-Baha's instructions, they were transferred to the Holy Land, and  were permanently and ceremoniously laid to rest by Him in a specially  erected mausoleum on the slopes of Mt. Carmel.    Thus ended a life which posterity will recognize as standing at the  confluence of two universal prophetic cycles, the Adamic Cycle stretching  back as far as the first dawnings of the world's recorded religious  history and the Baha'i Cycle destined to propel itself across the unborn  reaches of time for a period of no less than five thousand centuries. The  apotheosis in which such a life attained its consummation marks, as  already observed, the culmination of the most heroic phase of the Heroic  Age of the Baha'i Dispensation. It can, moreover, be regarded in no other  light except as the most dramatic, the most tragic event transpiring  within the entire range of the first Baha'i century. Indeed it can be  rightly acclaimed as unparalleled in the annals of the lives of all the  Founders of the world's existing religious systems.    So momentous an event could hardly fail to arouse widespread and keen  interest even beyond the confines of the land in which it had occurred.  \"C'est un des plus"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/19279"],[0,"Memorials of the Faithful (#16)"],[1," prison he was almost helpless, and worn  to the bone. It was during the time when the Blessed Beauty was imprisoned  within the citadel, at the center of the barracks. Despite the terrible  hardships, Mirza Mihdi spent some days here, in great joy. To him, the  calamities were favors, the tribulations were Divine Providence, the  chastisement abounding grace; for he was enduring all this on the pathway  of God, and seeking to win His good pleasure. His illness worsened; from  day to day he failed; then at the last, under sheltering grace, he took  his flight to the inexhaustible mercy of the Lord.    This noble personage had been honored among men, but for God's love he  lost both name and fame. He bore manifold misfortunes with never a  complaint. He was content with God's decrees, and walked the ways of  resignation. The glance of Baha'u'llah's favor was upon him; he was close  to the Divine Threshold. Thus, from the beginning of his life till the  end, he remained in one and the same inner state: immersed in an ocean of  submission and consent. \"O my Lord, take me, take me!\" he would cry, until  at last he soared away to the world that no man sees.    May God cause him to inhale the sweet scent of holiness in the highest  Paradise, and refresh him with the crystalline wine cup, tempered at the  camphor fountain.(56) Unto him be salutations and praise. His fragrant  tomb is in Akka.            MISHKIN-QALAM      Among the exiles, neighbors, and prisoners there was also a second Mir  Imad,(57) the eminent calligrapher, Mi_sh_kin-Qalam.(58) He wielded a  musk-black pen, and his brows shone with faith. He was among the most  noted of mystics, and had a witty and subtle mind. The fame of this  spiritual wayfarer reached out to every land. He was the leading  calligrapher of Persia and well known to all the great; he enjoyed a  special position among the court ministers of Tihran, and with them he was  solidly established.(59) He was famed throughout Asia Minor; his pen was  the wonder of all calligraphers, for he was adept at every calligraphic  style. He was besides, for human virtues, a bright star.    This highly accomplished man first heard of the Cause of God in Isfahan,  and the result was that he set out to find Baha'u'llah. He crossed the  great distances, measured out the miles, climbing mountains, passing over  deserts and over the sea, until at last he came to Adrianople. Here he  reached the heights of faith and assurance; here he drank the wine of  certitude. He responded to the summons of God, he attained the presence of  Baha'u'llah, he ascended to that apogee where he was received and  accepted. By now he was reeling to and fro like a drunkard in his love for  God, and because of his violent desire and yearning, his mind seemed to  wander. He would be raised up, and then cast down again; he was as one  distracted. He spent some time under the sheltering grace of Baha'u'llah,  and every day new blessings were showered upon him. Meanwhile he produced  his splendid calligraphs; he would write out the Most Great Name, Ya  Baha'u'l-Abha, O Thou Glory of the All-Glorious, with marvelous skill, in  many different forms, and would send them everywhere.(60)    He was then directed to go on a journey to Constantinople, and set out  with Jinab-i-Sayyah. When he reached that Great City, the leading Persians  and Turks received him with every honor at first, and they were captivated  by his jet black, calligraphic art. He, however, began boldly and  eloquently to teach the Faith. The Persian ambassador lurked in ambush;  betaking himself to the Sultan's vazirs he slandered Mi_sh_kin-Qalam.  \"This man is an agitator,\" the ambassador told them, \"sent here by  Baha'u'llah to stir up trouble and make mischief in this Great City. He  has already won over a large company, and he intends to subdue still more.  These Baha'is turned Persia upside down; now they have started in on the  capital of Turkey. The Persian Government put 20,000 of them to the sword,  hoping by this tactic to quench the fires of sedition. You should awaken  to the danger; soon this perverse thing will blaze up here as well. It  will consume the harvest of your life; it will burn up the whole world.  Then you can do nothing, for it will be too late.\"    Actually that mild and submissive man, in that throne city of Asia Minor,  was occupied solely with his calligraphy and his worship of God. He was  striving to bring about not sedition but fellowship and peace. He was  seeking to reconcile the followers of different faiths, not to drive them  still further apart. He was of service to strangers and was helping to  educate the native people. He was a refuge to the hapless and a horn of  plenty to the poor. He invited all comers to the oneness of humankind; he  shunned hostility and malice.    The Persian ambassador, however, wielded enormous power, and he had  maintained close ties with the ministers for a very long time. He  prevailed on a number of persons to insinuate themselves into various  gatherings and there to make every kind of false charge against the  believers. Urged on by the oppressors, spies began to surround  Mi_sh_kin-Qalam. Then, as instructed by the ambassador, they carried  reports to the Prime Minister, stating that the individual in question was  stirring up mischief day and night, that he was a trouble maker, a rebel  and a criminal. The result was, they jailed him and they sent him away to  Gallipoli, where he joined our own company of victims. They despatched him  to Cyprus and ourselves to the Akka prison. On the island of Cyprus,  Jinab-i-Mi_sh_kin was held prisoner in the citadel at Famagusta, and in  this city he remained, a captive, from the year 85 till 94.    When Cyprus passed out of Turkish hands, Mi_sh_kin-Qalam was freed and  betook himself to his Well-Beloved in the city of Akka, and here he lived  encompassed by the grace of Baha'u'llah, producing his marvelous  calligraphs and sending them about. He was at all times joyous of spirit,  ashine with the love of God, like a candle burning its life away, and he  was a consolation to all the believers.    After the ascension of Baha'u'llah, Mi_sh_kin-Qalam remained loyal,  solidly established in the Covenant. He stood before the violators like a  brandished sword. He would never go half way with them; he feared no one  but God; not for a moment did he falter, nor ever fail in service.    Following the ascension he made a journey to India, where he associated  with the lovers of truth. He spent some time there, making fresh efforts  every day. When I learned that he was getting helpless, I sent for him at  once and he came back to this Most Great Prison, to the joy of the  believers, who felt blessed to have him here again. He was at all times my  close companion. He had amazing verve, intense love. He was a compendium  of perfections: believing, confident, serene, detached from the world, a  peerless companion, a wit--and his character like a garden in full bloom.  For the love of God, he left all good things behind; he closed his eyes to  success, he wanted neither comfort nor rest, he sought no wealth, he  wished only to be free from the defilement of the world. He had no ties to  this life, but spent his days and nights supplicating and communing with  God. He was always smiling, effervescing; he was spirit personified, love  embodied. For sincerity and loyalty he had no match, nor for patience and  inner calm. He was selflessness itself, living on the breaths of the  spirit.    If he had not been in love with the Blessed Beauty, if he had not set his  heart on the Realm of Glory, every worldly pleasure could have been his.  Wherever he went, his many calligraphic styles were a substantial capital,  and his great accomplishment brought him attention and respect from rich  and poor alike. But he was hopelessly enamored of man's one true Love, and  thus he was free of all those other bonds, and could float and soar in the  spirit's endless sky.    Finally, when I was absent, he left this darksome, narrow world and  hastened away to the land of lights. There, in the haven of God's  boundless mercy, he found infinite rewards. Unto him be praise and  salutations, and the Supreme Companion's tender grace.            USTAD 'ALI-AKBAR-I-NAJJAR      Ustad 'Ali-Akbar, the Cabinet-Maker,(61) was numbered among the just, a  prince of the righteous. He was one of Persia's earliest believers and a  leading member of that company. From the beginning of the Cause a trusted  confidant, he loosed his tongue to proclaim the Faith. He informed himself  as to its proofs, and went deep into its Scriptures. He was also a gifted  poet, writing odes in eulogy of Baha'u'llah.    Exceptionally skilled in his craft, Ustad produced highly ingenious work,  fashioning carpentry that, for intricacy and precision, resembled mosaic  inlay. He was expert in mathematics as well, solving and explaining  difficult problems.    From Yazd, this revered man traveled to 'Iraq, where he achieved the honor  of entering the presence of Baha'u'llah, and received abundant grace. The  Blessed Beauty showered favors upon Ustad 'Ali, who entered His presence  almost every day. He was one of those who were exiled from Ba_gh_dad to  Mosul, and he endured severe hardships there. He remained a long time in  Mosul, in extremely straitened circumstances but resigned to the will of  God, always in prayer and supplication, and with a thankful tongue.    Finally he came from Mosul to the Holy Shrine and here by the tomb of  Baha'u'llah he would meditate and pray. In the dark of the night, restless  and uneasy, he would lament and cry out; when he was supplicating God his  heart burned within him; his eyes would shed their tears, and he would  lift up his voice and chant. He was completely cut off from this dust  heap, this mortal world. He shunned it, he asked but one thing--to soar  away; and he hoped for the"]]]
