A further recapitulation of these establishments would only be tedious  to the reader, particularly as they are now for the most part become  private houses; suffice it to say, that in the reign of Louis XIII  twenty monasteries were established at Paris. The nunnery of  _Ursulines_; No. 47, _Rue Sainte-Avoye_, now a Jews' synagogue. The  Convent of the Visitation of St. Mary, _Rue Saint-Antoine_, Nos. 214  and 216; the church, still standing, was built in 1632 after the model  of _Notre-Dame-de-la-Rotonde_ at Rome, and is called  _Notre-Dame-des-Anges_. Another convent of the same order was built in  1623 in the _Rue Saint-Jacques_, Nos. 193 and 195, and is I believe  still occupied by nuns, as it was so very recently. The convent of  _Filles-de-la-Madeleine_, _Rue des Fontaines_, between the Nos. 14 and  16, which has now become a house of seclusion for women who have been  convicted of offences. The Convent of the Annonciades Celestes or Filles  Bleues, founded by the Marchioness de Verneuil, mistress of Henry IV, is  now in spite of all its pompous titles a waggon office in the _Rue  Culture-Sainte-Catherine_, No. 29. The Assumption, a convent for nuns,  of which the church is still standing in the _Rue Saint-Honore_, between  the Nos. 369 and 371, is remarkable for its large dome, but appears  out of proportion with the rest of the building, which is otherwise not  destitute of merit. The _Val-de-Grace_, a Benedictine Abbey, _Rue  Faubourg Saint-Jacques_, between the Nos. 277 and 279. The Queen Anne  of Austria founded the establishment in 1621; the church is still  preserved in perfect order, and is of very rich architecture, too  profuse in ornament. The rest of the building, once inhabited by  Benedictine nuns, is now an asylum for sick or wounded soldiers, being a  military hospital. _Port-Royal_, a convent for nuns, established in 1625  in the _Rue de la Bourbe_, is now a lying-in hospital. The Convent of  the _Filles de Sainte-Elisabeth_; the first stone was laid by Marie de  Medici in 1628, but was, like a multitude of others, suppressed in 1790,  the church only remaining; it is situated in the _Rue du Temple_,  between Nos. 107 and 109.    A Convent for Benedictine Nuns founded in 1636 in the _Rue de Sevres_,  No. 3, being suppressed in 1778, was converted into the more useful  purpose of an hospital, and as such it still remains. The Convent of the  _Filles de la Ste-Croix_, situated No. 86, _Rue de Charonne_, was  occupied as recently as 1823 by nuns; it was founded in 1639. The noble  church of _St-Roch, Rue St-Honore_, was commenced as a chapel in 1587,  and in 1622 was converted into a parish church, but was not entirely  finished until 1740. It is now the church attended by the royal family,  and is an object of interest to every one who visits Paris. The church  of _Ste-Marguerite_ was erected in 1625 in the _Rue St-Bernard_, Nos.  28 and 30, _Faubourg St-Antoine_, and is still attended by the  inhabitants of that quarter. _Maison de Scipion_ was founded in a street  of the same name in the year 1622 by an Italian gentleman named Scipio  Sardini, and is now the bakehouse for making bread for all the hospitals  in Paris. Such were the principal edifices instituted in Paris, during  the reign of Louis XIII, either as Convents, Monasteries, or Nunneries,  with churches attached to them; I have cited the most conspicuous of  those of which any vestiges remain, indicating their different  localities, besides a number of hospitals, most of which I have stated;  that of the _Incurables_ certainly merits attention, it was founded in  1632 in the _Rue de Sevres_, and is now a refuge for those women of  whom no hopes can be cherished of ultimate recovery. The Palace of the  _Luxembourg_ was one of the most important edifices erected in this  reign by Mary de Medici whilst she was regent in 1615, in the _Rue  Vaugirard_, at present the Chamber of Peers, after having served the  purpose of a prison, for which a portion of it is still appropriated for  criminals against the state; but with its large and beautiful gardens it  merits a more detailed description, which will be given under the head  of public monuments. The whole number of religious establishments of all  descriptions built in the reign of Louis XIII, amount to forty-nine,  besides many Bridges, Fountains, Hotels, Statues, etc., etc.; which  altogether so augmented Paris that it became requisite to have another  wall, affording the capital more extended dimensions, which was  accordingly constructed. Notwithstanding all these improvements the  streets of Paris were in a most filthy condition, constantly emitting a  disagreeable odour; they were very narrow and the greater portion of  them very ill paved, besides which they were infested with thieves, and  complaints were continually arising against the hosts of pages and  lackeys who insulted people in the streets, and were continually  committing some disorders, both during the day and the night, when  persons were frequently killed in the skirmishes that were constantly  taking place. Ordinances and edicts were continually appearing,  forbidding the pages and lackeys to wear arms, but all of no avail; when  any one was arrested, he was rescued by his companions, and the  officers of police sometimes killed. Louis XIII, ever feeble in mind,  and probably in constitution, died at the age of 42; it was supposed  from a premature decay.    The history of the reign of Louis the Fourteenth and those which follow  to the present day are so well known to the English, that whatever I  might state respecting them would only be to my readers a repetition of  that of which they are already informed, as the continual wars for the  last two centuries between England and France have brought the nations  in constant contact; but prior to that period, even the most prominent  events of the French history are but little known to the English, and in  order to enhance the enjoyment of examining the old buildings in Paris,  I conceived it necessary to give a slight sketch of the monarchs under  whom they were erected, with the dates as accurately as could be  ascertained, but consider that it would be useless to do so as regards  those edifices constructed since the reign of Louis XIII, as they can  only afford pleasure as regards their utility or beauty; as if not two  hundred years old, the age of their date ceases to excite interest,  although I shall describe them in due course. I have often been  surprised that in all schools, although they give the history of Rome,  of Greece, and of course of England, yet of France, which is the country  the nearest to us, we are suffered to remain ignorant as to its history.  We have all heard of the battles of Cressy, Poitiers and Agincourt, and  remember that they were gained by the Edwards and Henry the Fifth, but  few persons know anything about who were the French kings under whom  they were lost; the only instances where the history of the French is  brought to our minds, is when any connexion by marriage has occurred  between the families of the sovereigns of the two nations.          CHAPTER IV.         Paris as it is, being a general survey of the place itself, its       attractions, its demerits, the inhabitants, their manners to       strangers, towards each other, their customs, and occupations.    [Illustration: Church of the Madeleine.  Published by F. Sinnett, 15, Grande rue Verte.]      I know no better means of obtaining a first general view of Paris and  its inmates, than by taking a walk upon the Boulevards, I therefore will  invite the reader to imagine himself promenading with me, we will begin  at the Madeleine, and occupy a short time in surveying that noble and  majestic building; it greatly reminds me of the Temple of Theseus, at  Athens; it is perhaps one of the most perfect monuments, as regards its  exterior, in Europe, the statues and sculpture are fine as to their  general effect, but the lofty handsome pillars lose much of their beauty  from the joins of the stones being too conspicuous, and having become  black, the fine broad mass is cut up, and gives one an idea of so many  cheeses placed one upon another, or rather they resemble the joints of a  caterpillar: the interior is certainly most gorgeous, and at first  strikes the beholder as a most splendid display of rich magnificence;  but a moment's reflection, and instantly he feels how inconsistent is  all that gilded mass and profusion of ornament with the beautiful and  chaste simplicity of the exterior. I never can conceive that all that  glitter of gold is in good keeping with the calm repose and dignity  which ought to reign throughout a church. The Madeleine was begun in the  reign of Louis the Fifteenth, and was intended for different purposes as  it slowly progressed through the different reigns which have since  occurred. Louis Philippe at length decided upon completing it with the  energy that had ever before been wanting. Several public monuments had  been suffered to remain dormant during the two preceding reigns, or  their operations were carried on with so sparing a hand, that whilst a  few workmen were employed at one end of a building, weeds and moss began  to grow on the other. This pigmy style of proceeding was well-satirised  during the reign of Charles X in one of the papers, which announced in  large letters, \"the workmen at the Madeleine have been doubled! where  there was one, there are now two!\" But soon after the present King came  to the throne, capital was found, and the industrious employed. Thus  much for this splendid work of art; let us turn round and look about  us: Ah! see, there are the works of nature, how gay and cheerful those  flowers appear so tastefully arranged in Madame Adde's shop, whilst she  herself looks as fresh and healthy as her plants which are blooming  around her; yet with that robust and country air she is a Parisian,"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/17763"],[0,"The Mystery of the Hasty Arrow (#16)"],[1,"arrow from the same quiver. Take  fresh aim and shoot.\"    Another breathless moment--more breathless than the other; then a second  arrow flew across the court and hung quivering in the breast of the  dummy.    From both ends of the gallery men came running, and leaning eagerly over  the gallery-rail they watched the Coroner as he stepped again into view  to make a second examination.    This time he kept them several minutes in suspense, and when he had drawn  out the arrow, he looked long at the hole it had made. Then, instead of  shouting his decision across the court, he could be seen leaving the  gallery and coming around their way.    What had he to say? As they waited, a clock struck from some neighboring  steeple--three sonorous peals! The two directors glanced at each other.  Doubtless they felt the weirdness of the hour as well as of the occasion.  It was a new experience for these amateurs in police procedure.    Arrived on their side, the Coroner advanced quickly. When close upon the  reassembled group, he remarked quickly but with great decision:    \"Mr. Travis seems to have been correct in denying that the arrow flew  either from before or behind this pedestal. The first arrow sent by Mr.  La Fleche entered the dummy almost at a right angle; the last departed  but a little from this same line. But the real wound which I probed and  located to a hair was a decidedly slanting one. It must have been sent  from a place further off.\"    \"From behind the other pedestal!\" spoke up Mr. Gryce, all fire and  interest at once. \"Either the Englishman deceived us, or each pedestal  had its man.\"    \"We'll see! Another shot, and from behind the further pedestal, Mr. La  Fleche!\"    The Indian glided into view and started for the other end of the  tapestry, followed by the Inspector, his detectives and the two  directors. As they passed one by one across the face of the great  hanging, they had the appearance not of living men but of a parade of  specters, so silent their step and so somber their air. The dread of some  development hitherto unacknowledged made their movements slow instead of  hasty. The upper pedestal instead of the lower! Why should this possible  fact make any difference in their feelings. Yet it did--perhaps because  it meant deception on the part of one they had instinctively believed  trustworthy, or--    But why pursue conjecture when actuality only is of moment? Let us  proceed with our relation and await the result.    Arrived at the upper pedestal, Mr. La Fleche took his place, received the  third arrow and presently delivered it. The Coroner, who had already  started for the other side, hastily approached the dummy, made his  examination and threw up his hand with the loud shout:    \"The shot was made from there; the matter is settled!\"    Question: Had Mr. Travis wilfully misled them, or had the presumption in  his favor been strengthened by this proof that it had been shown possible  for another hand than his to have shot the arrow from this same section  of the gallery, without disturbing his belief that he was the only person  in it at the time?          X    \"AND HE STOOD _HERE_?\"      The Inspector, finding himself very much disturbed by the doubt just  mentioned, felt inclined to question whether any perceptible advancement  had been made by this freak business of his canny subordinate. He was  hardly ready to say yes, and was not a little surprised when on his way  toward the head of the staircase he heard the exultant voice of Mr. Gryce  whisper in his ear:    \"That's all right. We've gained a point. We know now the exact place from  which the arrow was shot.\"    \"But not who shot it.\"    \"No--except that it was not the man Travis.\"    \"How can you be sure of that?\"    \"For two reasons. This is the first one: If it is difficult to understand  how a man could slip from behind the eastern pedestal and make his way  along the open gallery to Room H, without attracting the attention of the  officer posted opposite, how next to impossible we should find it, if  thirty feet were added to his course--which is the distance between the  two pedestals!\"    \"What was that fellow doing, that he shouldn't have seen this effort at  escape, whether it involved a short flight or a long one?\"    \"He says he was not given detective-duty--that he was placed there to  keep watch over the body of the young girl;--that at a certain moment he  imagined himself to hear a stealthy footstep approaching from the farther  end of the gallery, and anxious to spot the man yielding to so doubtful a  curiosity, he approached the arch separating his section from the  adjoining one, and stopping just inside, stood for a moment or so,  listening. As this involved the turning of his back upon the court and  consequently upon the opposite gallery, it gave Travis just the  opportunity he needed for an unobserved escape. But I see you are not  very much impressed by the reason I have advanced for believing his story  and placing him where he says he was placed, behind the eastern pedestal.  You doubtless think that if the officer opposite had stood long enough  with his back to the court, Travis might have taken those extra thirty  steps as easily as the twenty he had confessed to. Listen, then, to my  second reason, or rather, step this way.\"    Leading his superior toward Room B, the door of which stood wide open, he  paused just outside the threshold to note the effect produced upon the  Inspector by what he saw inside. Evidently it was as marked with surprise  as the detective had calculated upon, for with an air of great  astonishment the Inspector turned upon him with the whispered  exclamation:    \"Travis here! where he could listen--see----\"    \"Yes. Take a good look at him, Inspector. It won't trouble him any. I  doubt if he would notice us if we stepped into the room.\"    And such was the opinion of the Inspector himself, as he remarked the  extreme excitement under which the Englishman was laboring. Absorbed in  thoughts of his own, he was pacing the room with long strides, turning  mechanically as he met some impediment, but otherwise oblivious to his  surroundings, even to the point of not noting the presence of Sweetwater,  who stood quietly watching him from one of the corners.    This display of feeling was certainly eloquent enough to attract anyone's  attention, but what gave it impressiveness to the official mind was this:  his excitement was that of triumph, not fear, of hope without any trace  of confusion.    \"It is not of himself he is thinking,\" muttered Gryce.    \"And he stood _here_?\"    \"No--we left him free to move about at will, and his will carried him  into full view of the whole performance.\"    \"And Sweetwater?\"    \"Was near enough to note his every move, but of course kept himself well  out of sight.\"    Then as they both stepped back from the doorway: \"Mr. Travis didn't know  he was being watched. He thought himself alone; and having an expressive  countenance,--very expressive for an Englishman,--it was easy enough for  Sweetwater to read his thoughts.\"    \"And those thoughts?\"    \"Relief to find an explanation of the phenomenon he had doubtless been  puzzling over for hours. The moments he had spent in hiding behind one  pedestal had evidently failed to suggest that another man might have been  in hiding behind the other.\"    \"I am not surprised. Coincidences of this astonishing kind are not often  met with even by us,\" was the Inspector's dry retort.    During the interchange of these hurried sentences, they had withdrawn  still farther out of sight and hearing of the man discussed. But at this  point Inspector Jackson reapproached the doorway, and entering in a  manner to intercept Mr. Travis in his nervous goings to and fro, remarked  in an off-hand way:    \"I see that you have met with a surprise, Mr. Travis. Like ourselves, you  gave little thought to what that upper pedestal might conceal.\"    \"You are right. I never even glanced that way. But if I had, I should  have seen nothing. He was well hid, exceedingly well hid, whoever he was.  But he cannot escape now; you'll get him, won't you, Inspector? He could  not have left the building--all say that this was impossible. He was one,  then, of the people I saw moving about when I went down into the court.  Find him! Find this murderer of innocence! of the sweetest, purest  child----\"    He turned away; grief was taking the place of indignation and revenge.  At this sight the two men left him. The Inspector was at last convinced,  both of the man's probity and of one stern, disconcerting fact: that the  real culprit--the man whose guilty fingers had launched the fatal  arrow--had been, as Travis said, one of the twenty-two persons who had  been moving about for hours not only under his eyes but under those of  the famous detective posted there.          XI    FOOTSTEPS        WANTED--A WOMAN CALLING HERSELF ANTOINETTE Duclos, just arrived from    Europe on the steamer _Castania_, who after taking rooms at the    Universal for herself and her steamer companion, Angeline Willetts,    left the hotel in great haste late in the afternoon of May twenty-third    and has not been heard of since.      In person she is of medium height, but stocky for a Frenchwoman. Dark    hair, black eyes, with an affection of the lid which causes the left    one to droop. Her dress consisted of skirt and jacket of a soft shade    of brown. Hat indistinguishable. She carried, on leaving the hotel, a    dark brown leather bag of medium size, long and narrow in shape. Her    only peculiarity, saving the one drooping eyelid, is a hesitating walk.    This is particularly obvious when she attempts to hasten.      It is to be hoped that this person on hearing of Miss Willetts' death,    will communicate at once with the clerk of the hotel.      If in two days this does not occur, a reward of five hundred dollars    will be given to the man or woman"]]]
