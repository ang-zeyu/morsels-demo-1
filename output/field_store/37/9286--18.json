Let it drip, cool and  drip again. Add it to one-quarter pound of melted butter, not browned,  season with salt and pepper. Mix thoroughly; bake in covered dish for  twenty minutes.      ~RICE IN TOMATOES~--Cook some rice in boiling salted water until tender  and season highly with pepper. Cut a small slice from the top of each  ripe tomato, take out the seeds, fill with the seasoned rice, put a bit  of butter on each, set in the oven and bake until the tomato is tender.      ~RICE SERVED IN ITALIAN STYLE WITH MUSHROOM SAUCE~--Steam or boil  one-half pound of rice until done, then drain. Remove meat from mushroom  sauce. Drop rice into mushroom sauce and cook about five minutes. Pour  on platter and sprinkle heavy with grated cheese.      ~SCALLOPED TOMATOES~--Drain a half can of tomatoes from some of their  liquor and season with salt, pepper, a few drops of onion juice and one  teaspoonful sugar. Cover the bottom of a small buttered baking dish with  buttered cracker crumbs, cover with tomatoes and sprinkle the top  thickly with buttered crumbs. Bake in a hot oven. Buttered cracker  crumbs are made by simply rolling common crackers with a rolling pin and  allowing one-third cupful of melted butter to each cupful of crumbs.  This recipe takes about one and one-third cupfuls of crumbs.      ~SPAGHETTI A L'ITALIENNE~--Let it cook until the water nearly boils away  and it is very soft. The imported spaghetti is so firm that it may be  cooked a long time without losing its shape. When the water has boiled  out, watch it and remove the cover so it will dry off. Then draw the  mass to one side and put in a large lump of butter, perhaps a  tablespoon, and let it melt, then stir in until the butter is absorbed,  and pour on one cup of the strained juice from canned tomatoes. Season  with salt and paprika, and let it stew until the spaghetti has absorbed  the tomato. The spaghetti, if cooked until soft, will thicken the tomato  sufficiently and it is less work than to make a tomato sauce. Turn out  and serve as an entree, or a main dish for luncheon and pass grated sap  sago or other cheese to those who prefer it. When you have any stock  like chicken or veal, add that with the tomato or alone if you prefer  and scant the butter.    ~STUFFED CABBAGE~--Cut the stalk out of two or more young cabbages and  fill with a stuffing made from cooked veal, chopped or ground very fine,  seasoned well with salt and pepper, and mixed with the beaten yolk of an  egg. Tie a strip of cheese cloth round each cabbage, or if small, twine  will hold each together. Put into a kettle with boiling water to cover  and cook until tender. Drain, unbind and serve hot.      ~STUFFED EGG PLANT~--Wash a large egg plant, cut in halves the long way  and scoop the inside out with a teaspoon, leaving each shell quite  empty, but unbroken. Cook the inside portion in one-half cup of water,  then press through a strainer and mix with one-half cup of bread crumbs,  one rounding tablespoon of butter and season with salt and pepper. The  shells should lie in salt and water after scraping, and when ready to  fill them wipe them dry and pack the filling. Scatter fine crumbs over  the top, dot with butter and bake twenty minutes.      ~STUFFED POTATOES~--Select smooth, even sized potatoes and bake until  done. Remove one end, carefully scrape out the center of each mash and  season with salt and butter, add a generous portion of nut meat and fill  the shells with the mixture. Cover with the piece that was cut off, wrap  each potato in tissue paper and serve.      ~CORN STEWED WITH CREAM~--Select a half dozen ears of Indian corn,  remove the silks and outer husks, place them in a saucepan and cover  with water. Cook, drain, and cut the corn off the cobs with a sharp  knife, being very careful that none of the cob adheres to the corn.  Place in a stewpan with one cup of hot bechamel sauce, one-half  breakfast-cupful of cream and about one-quarter of an ounce of butter.  Season with pepper and salt and a little grated nutmeg. Cook gently on a  stove for five minutes, place in a hot dish and serve.          SAUCES      ~CUCUMBER SAUCE~--Pare two good sized cucumbers and cut a generous piece  from the stem end. Grate on a coarse grater and drain through cheese  cloth for half an hour. Season the pulp with salt, pepper and vinegar to  suit the taste. Serve with broiled, baked or fried fish.      ~GHERKIN SAUCE~--Put a sprig of thyme, a bay-leaf, a clove of garlic,  two finely chopped shallots, and a cayenne pepper, and salt into a  saucepan, with one breakfast cup of vinegar. Place pan on fire and when  contents have boiled for thirty minutes, add a breakfast cup of stock or  good broth. Strain it through a fine hair sieve and stir in one and  one-half ounces of liquefied butter mixed with a little flour to thicken  it. Place it back in the saucepan and when it boils stir in it a  teaspoonful or so of parsley very finely chopped, two or three ounces of  pickle gherkins, and a little salt if required.      ~GIBLET SAUCE~--Put the giblets from any bird in the saucepan with  sufficient stock or water to cover them and boil for three hours, adding  an onion and a few peppercorns while cooking. Take them out, and when  they are quite tender strain the liquor into another pan and chop up the  gizzards, livers, and other parts into small pieces. Take a little of  the thickening left at the bottom of the pan in which a chicken or goose  has been braised, and after the fat has been taken off, mix it with the  giblet liquor and boil until dissolved. Strain the sauce, put in the  pieces of giblet, and serve hot.      ~GOOSEBERRY SAUCE~--Pick one pound of green gooseberries and put them  into a saucepan with sufficient water to keep them from burning, when  soft mash them, grate in a little nutmeg and sweeten to taste with moist  sugar. This sauce may be served with roast pork or goose instead of  apple sauce. It may also be served with boiled mackerel. A small piece  of butter will make the sauce richer.      ~HALF-GLAZE SAUCE~--Put one pint of clear concentrated veal gravy in a  saucepan, mix it with two wine-glassfuls of Madeira, a bunch of sweet  herbs, and set both over the fire until boiling. Mix two tablespoonfuls  of potato flour to a smooth paste with a little cold water, then mix it  with the broth and stir until thick. Move the pan to the side of the  fire and let the sauce boil gently until reduced to two-thirds of its  original quantity. Skim it well, pass it through a silk sieve, and it is  ready for use.      ~HAM SAUCE~--After a ham is nearly all used up pick the small quantity  of meat still remaining, from the bone, scrape away the uneatable parts  and trim off any rusty bits from the meat, chop the bone very small and  beat the meat almost to a paste. Put the broken bones and meat together  into a saucepan over a slow fire, pour over them one-quarter pint of  broth, and stir about one-quarter of an hour, add to it a few sweet  herbs, a seasoning of pepper and one-half pint of good beef stock. Cover  the saucepan and stir very gently until well flavored with herbs, then  strain it. A little of this added to any gravy is an improvement.      ~HORSERADISH SAUCE~--Place in a basin one tablespoonful of moist sugar,  one tablespoonful of ground mustard, one teacupful of grated  horseradish, and one teaspoonful of turmeric, season with pepper and  salt and mix the ingredients with a teacupful of vinegar or olive oil.  When quite smooth, turn the sauce into a sauceboat, and it is ready to  be served.      ~LEMON BUTTER~--Cream four level tablespoons of butter and add gradually  one tablespoon of lemon juice mixing thoroughly.      ~LEMON SAUCE FOR FISH~--Squeeze and strain the juice of a large lemon  into a lined saucepan, put in with it one-fourth pound butter and  pepper, and salt to taste. Beat it over the fire until thick and hot,  but do not allow to boil. When done mix with sauce the beaten yolks of  two eggs. It is then ready to be served.      ~LOBSTER BUTTER~--Take the head and spawn of some hen lobsters, put them  in a mortar and pound, add an equal quantity of fresh butter, and pound  both together, being sure they are thoroughly mixed. Pass this through a  fine hair sieve, and the butter is then ready for use. It is very nice  for garnishing or for making sandwiches.      ~MAITRE D'HOTEL BUTTER~--Cream one-fourth cup of butter. Add one-half  teaspoon salt, a dash of pepper and a tablespoon of fine chopped  parsley, then, very slowly to avoid curdling, a tablespoon of lemon  juice. This sauce is appropriate for beefsteak and boiled fish.      ~SAUCE A LA METCALF~--Put two or three tablespoonfuls of butter in a  saucepan, and when it melts add about a tablespoonful of Liebig's  Extract of Beef; season and gradually stir in about a cupful of cream.  After taking off, add a wine-glassful of Sherry or Madeira.      ~PARSLEY AND LEMON SAUCE~--Squeeze the juice from a lemon, remove the  pips, and mince fine the pulp and rind. Wash a good handful of parsley,  and shake it as dry as possible, and chop it, throwing away the stalks.  Put one ounce of butter and one tablespoonful of flour into a saucepan,  and stir over fire until well mixed. Then put in the parsley and minced  lemon, and pour in as much clear stock as will be required to make the  sauce. Season with a small quantity of pounded mace, and stir the whole  over the fire a few minutes. Beat the yolks of two eggs with two  tablespoonfuls of cold stock, and move the sauce to the side of the  fire, and when it has cooled a little, stir in the eggs. Stir the sauce  for two minutes on the side of the fire, and it will be ready for  serving.      ~POIVRADE SAUCE~--Put in a stewpan six scallions, a "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/18440"],[0,"Logic: Deductive and Inductive (#16)"],[1,"swer. That the modality of a conclusion follows the less certain  of the premises combined, is inadequate for scientific guidance; so  that, as Deductive Logic can get no farther than this, it has abandoned  the discussion of Modals. To endeavour to determine the degree of  certainty attaching to a problematic judgment is not, however, beyond  the reach of Induction, by analysing circumstantial evidence, or by  collecting statistics with regard to it. Thus, instead of 'The cobra's  bite is _probably_ fatal,' we might find that it is fatal 80 times in  100. Then, if we know that of those who go to India 3 in 1000 are  bitten, we can calculate what the chances are that any one going to  India will die of a cobra's bite (chap. xx.).    Sec. 6. Verbal and Real Propositions.--Another important division of  propositions turns upon the relation of the predicate to the subject in  respect of their connotations. We saw, when discussing Relative Terms,  that the connotation of one term often implies that of another;  sometimes reciprocally, like 'master' and 'slave'; or by inclusion, like  species and genus; or by exclusion, like contraries and contradictories.  When terms so related appear as subject and predicate of the same  proposition, the result is often tautology--e.g., _The master has  authority over his slave; A horse is an animal; Red is not blue; British  is not foreign_. Whoever knows the meaning of 'master,' 'horse,' 'red,'  'British,' learns nothing from these propositions. Hence they are called  Verbal propositions, as only expounding the sense of words, or as if  they were propositions only by satisfying the forms of language, not by  fulfilling the function of propositions in conveying a knowledge of  facts. They are also called 'Analytic' and 'Explicative,' when they  separate and disengage the elements of the connotation of the subject.  Doubtless, such propositions may be useful to one who does not know the  language; and Definitions, which are verbal propositions whose  predicates analyse the whole connotations of their subjects, are  indispensable instruments of science (see chap. xxii.).    Of course, hypothetical propositions may also be verbal, as _If the soul  be material it is extended_; for 'extension' is connoted by 'matter';  and, therefore, the corresponding disjunctive is verbal--_Either the  soul is not material, or it is extended_. But a true divisional  disjunctive can never be verbal (chap. xxi. Sec. 4, rule 1).    On the other hand, when there is no such direct relation between subject  and predicate that their connotations imply one another, but the  predicate connotes something that cannot be learnt from the connotation  of the subject, there is no longer tautology, but an enlargement of  meaning--e.g., _Masters are degraded by their slaves; The horse is the  noblest animal; Red is the favourite colour of the British army; If the  soul is simple, it is indestructible_. Such propositions are called  Real, Synthetic, or Ampliative, because they are propositions for which  a mere understanding of their subjects would be no substitute, since the  predicate adds a meaning of its own concerning matter of fact.    To any one who understands the language, a verbal proposition can never  be an inference or conclusion from evidence; nor can a verbal  proposition ever furnish grounds for an inference, except as to the  meaning of words. The subject of real and verbal propositions will  inevitably recur in the chapters on Definition; but tautologies are such  common blemishes in composition, and such frequent pitfalls in argument,  that attention cannot be drawn to them too early or too often.          CHAPTER VI    CONDITIONS OF IMMEDIATE INFERENCE      Sec. 1. The word Inference is used in two different senses, which are often  confused but should be carefully distinguished. In the first sense, it  means a process of thought or reasoning by which the mind passes from  facts or statements presented, to some opinion or expectation. The data  may be very vague and slight, prompting no more than a guess or surmise;  as when we look up at the sky and form some expectation about the  weather, or from the trick of a man's face entertain some prejudice as  to his character. Or the data may be important and strongly significant,  like the footprint that frightened Crusoe into thinking of cannibals, or  as when news of war makes the city expect that Consols will fall. These  are examples of the act of inferring, or of inference as a process; and  with inference in this sense Logic has nothing to do; it belongs to  Psychology to explain how it is that our minds pass from one perception  or thought to another thought, and how we come to conjecture, conclude  and believe (_cf._ chap. i. Sec. 6).    In the second sense, 'inference' means not this process of guessing or  opining, but the result of it; the surmise, opinion, or belief when  formed; in a word, the conclusion: and it is in this sense that  Inference is treated of in Logic. The subject-matter of Logic is an  inference, judgment or conclusion concerning facts, embodied in a  proposition, which is to be examined in relation to the evidence that  may be adduced for it, in order to determine whether, or how far, the  evidence amounts to proof. Logic is the science of Reasoning in the  sense in which 'reasoning' means giving reasons, for it shows what sort  of reasons are good. Whilst Psychology explains how the mind goes  forward from data to conclusions, Logic takes a conclusion and goes back  to the data, inquiring whether those data, together with any other  evidence (facts or principles) that can be collected, are of a nature to  warrant the conclusion. If we think that the night will be stormy, that  John Doe is of an amiable disposition, that water expands in freezing,  or that one means to national prosperity is popular education, and wish  to know whether we have evidence sufficient to justify us in holding  these opinions, Logic can tell us what form the evidence should assume  in order to be conclusive. What _form_ the evidence should assume: Logic  cannot tell us what kinds of fact are proper evidence in any of these  cases; that is a question for the man of special experience in life, or  in science, or in business. But whatever facts constitute the evidence,  they must, in order to prove the point, admit of being stated in  conformity with certain principles or conditions; and of these  principles or conditions Logic is the science. It deals, then, not with  the subjective process of inferring, but with the objective grounds that  justify or discredit the inference.    Sec. 2. Inferences, in the Logical sense, are divided into two great  classes, the Immediate and the Mediate, according to the character of  the evidence offered in proof of them. Strictly, to speak of inferences,  in the sense of conclusions, as immediate or mediate, is an abuse of  language, derived from times before the distinction between inference as  process and inference as result was generally felt. No doubt we ought  rather to speak of Immediate and Mediate Evidence; but it is of little  use to attempt to alter the traditional expressions of the science.    An Immediate Inference, then, is one that depends for its proof upon  only one other proposition, which has the same, or more extensive,  terms (or matter). Thus that _one means to national prosperity is  popular education_ is an immediate inference, if the evidence for it is  no more than the admission that _popular education is a means to  national prosperity:_ Similarly, it is an immediate inference that _Some  authors are vain_, if it be granted that _All authors are vain_.    An Immediate Inference may seem to be little else than a verbal  transformation; some Logicians dispute its claims to be called an  inference at all, on the ground that it is identical with the pretended  evidence. If we attend to the meaning, say they, an immediate inference  does not really express any new judgment; the fact expressed by it is  either the same as its evidence, or is even less significant. If from  _No men are gods_ we prove that _No gods are men_, this is nugatory; if  we prove from it that _Some men are not gods_, this is to emasculate the  sense, to waste valuable information, to lose the commanding sweep of  our universal proposition.    Still, in Logic, it is often found that an immediate inference expresses  our knowledge in a more convenient form than that of the evidentiary  proposition, as will appear in the chapter on Syllogisms and elsewhere.  And by transforming an universal into a particular proposition, as _No  men are gods_, therefore, _Some men are not gods_,--we get a statement  which, though weaker, is far more easily proved; since a single instance  suffices. Moreover, by drawing all possible immediate inferences from a  given proposition, we see it in all its aspects, and learn all that is  implied in it.    A Mediate Inference, on the other hand, depends for its evidence upon a  plurality of other propositions (two or more) which are connected  together on logical principles. If we argue--          No men are gods;        Alexander the Great is a man;      .'. Alexander the Great is not a god:    this is a Mediate Inference. The evidence consists of two propositions  connected by the term 'man,' which is common to both (a Middle Term),  mediating between 'gods' and 'Alexander.' Mediate Inferences comprise  Syllogisms with their developments, and Inductions; and to discuss them  further at present would be to anticipate future chapters. We must now  deal with the principles or conditions on which Immediate Inferences are  valid: commonly called the \"Laws of Thought.\"    Sec. 3. The Laws of Thought are conditions of the logical statement and  criticism of all sorts of evidence; but as to Immediate Inference, they  may be regarded as the only conditions it need satisfy. They are often  expressed "]]]
