This was a superior  felony, and as such it awed his little mind. It was tantamount to  burning his boats. Missing silver spoons and cooked petty cash were  trivialities usually expiable at the price of a boot-assisted dismissal;  but this--!    \"You understand?\" Gianapolis was not smiling, now. \"There is not the  slightest danger. The signature of the lady whom you will meet will be  an exact duplicate of the real one; that is, exact enough to deceive a  man who is not looking for a forgery. But it would not be exact enough  to deceive the French banker--he WILL be looking for a forgery. You  follow me? The signature on the checks drawn against the Credit Lyonnais  will be the SAME as the specimen forwarded by the London County and  Suburban, since they will be written by the same lady--the duplicate  Mrs. Leroux. Therefore, the French bank will have no means of detecting  the harmless little deception practised upon them, and the English bank,  if it should ever see those checks, will raise no question, since the  checks will have been honored by the Credit Lyonnais.\"    Soames finished his whisky-and-soda at a gulp.    \"Finally,\" concluded Gianapolis, \"you will escort the lady out by the  front entrance to the Strand. She will leave you and walk in an easterly  direction--making some suitable excuse if the manager should insist upon  seeing her to the door; and the real Mrs. Leroux will come out by the  Strand end of Bank Chambers' corridor, and walk back with you around the  corner to where the car will be waiting. Perfect?\"    \"Quite,\" said Soames, huskily....    But when, some twenty minutes later, he returned to Palace Mansions,  he was a man lost in thought; and he did not entirely regain his wonted  composure, and did not entirely shake off the incubus, Doubt, until in  his own room he had re-counted the contents of the brown paper envelope.  Then:--    \"It's safe enough,\" he muttered; \"and it's worth it!\"    Thus it came about that, on the following morning, Leroux called him  into the study and gave him just such instructions as Gianapolis had  outlined the evening before.    \"I am--er--too busy to go myself, Soames,\" said Leroux, \"and--er--Mrs.  Leroux will shortly be paying a visit to friends in--er--in Paris.  So that I am opening a credit there for her. Save so much  trouble--and--such a lot of--correspondence--international money  orders--and such worrying things. Mr. Smith, the manager, knows you  and you will take this letter of authority. The draft I understand has  already been purchased.\"    Mr. Soames was bursting with anxiety to learn the amount of this draft,  but could find no suitable opportunity to inquire. The astonishing  deception, then, was carried out without anything resembling a hitch.  Mrs. Leroux went through with her part in the comedy, in the dreamy  manner of a somnambulist; and the duplicate Mrs. Leroux, who waited  at the appointed spot, had achieved so startling a resemblance to her  prototype, that Mr. Soames became conscious of a craving for a peg  of brandy at the moment of setting eyes upon her. However, he braced  himself up and saw the business through.    As was to be expected, no questions were raised and no doubts  entertained. The bank manager was very courteous and very reserved, and  the fictitious Mrs. Leroux equally reserved, indeed, cold. She avoided  raising her motor veil, and, immediately the business was concluded,  took her departure, Mr. Smith escorting her as far as the door.    She walked away toward Fleet Street, and the respectful attendant,  Soames, toward Charing Cross; he rejoined Mrs. Leroux at the door of  Bank Chambers, and the two turned the corner and entered the waiting  car. Soames was rather nervous; Mrs. Leroux quite apathetic.    Shortly after this event, Soames learnt that the date of Mrs. Leroux's  departure to Paris was definitely fixed. He received from her hands a  large envelope.    \"For Mr. King,\" she said, in her dreamy fashion; and he noticed that she  seemed to be in poorer health than usual. Her mouth twitched strangely;  she was a nervous wreck.    Then came her departure, attended by a certain bustle, an appointment  with Mr. Gianapolis; and the delivery of the parcel into that  gentleman's keeping.    Mrs. Leroux was away for six days on this occasion. Leroux sent her  three postcards during that time, and re-addressed some ten or twelve  letters which arrived for her. The address in all cases was:         c/o Miss Denise Ryland,       Atelier 4, Rue du Coq d'Or,       Montmartre,       Paris.    East 18642 was much in demand that week; and there were numerous  meetings between Soames and Gianapolis at the corner of Victoria  Street, and numerous whiskies-and-sodas in the Red Lion; for Gianapolis  persisted in his patronage of that establishment, apparently for no  other reason than because it was dangerously near to Scotland Yard, and  an occasional house of call for members of the Criminal Investigation  Department.    Thus did Mr. Soames commence his career of duplicity at the flat of  Henry Leroux; and for some twelve months before the events which so  dramatically interfered with the delightful scheme, he drew his double  salary and performed his perfidious work with great efficiency and  contentment. Mrs. Leroux paid four other visits to Paris during that  time, and always returned in much better spirits, although pale and  somewhat haggard looking. It fell to the lot of Soames always to meet  her at Charing Cross; but never once, by look or by word, did  she proffer, or invite, the slightest exchange of confidence. She  apathetically accepted his aid in conducting this intrigue as she would  have accepted his aid in putting on her opera-cloak.    The curious Soames had read right through the telephone directory from  A to Z in quest of East 18642--only to learn that no such number was  published. His ingenuity not being great, he could think of no means  to learn the address of the mysterious Mr. King. So keenly had he been  impressed with the omniscience of that shadowy being who knew all his  past, that he feared to inquire of the Eastern Exchange. His banking  account was growing handsomely, and, above all things, he dreaded to  kill the goose that laid the golden eggs.    Then came the night which shattered all. Having rung up East 18642 and  made an appointment with Gianapolis in regard to some letters for  Mrs. Leroux, he had been surprised, on reaching the corner of Victoria  Street, to find that Gianapolis was not there! He glanced up at the face  of Big Ben. Yes--for the first time during their business acquaintance,  Mr. Gianapolis was late!    For close upon twenty minutes, Soames waited, walking slowly up and  down. When, at last, coming from the direction of Westminster, he saw  the familiar spruce figure.    Eagerly he hurried forward to meet the Greek; but Gianapolis--to the  horror and amazement of Soames--affected not to know him! He stepped  aside to avoid the stupefied butler, and passed. But, in passing, he  hissed these words at Soames:--    \"Follow to Victoria Street Post Office! Pretend to post letters at next  box to me and put them in my hand!\"    He was gone!    Soames, dazed at this new state of affairs, followed him at a discreet  distance. Gianapolis ran up the Post Office steps briskly, and Soames,  immediately afterwards, ascended also--furtively. Gianapolis was taking  out a number of letters from his pocket.    Soames walked across to the \"Country\" box on his right, and affected  to scrutinize the addresses on the envelopes of Mrs. Leroux's  correspondence.    Gianapolis, on the pretense of posting a country letter, reached out and  snatched the correspondence from Soames' hand. The gaze of his left eye  crookedly sought the face of the butler.    \"Go home!\" whispered Gianapolis; \"be cautious!\"          XIV    EAST 18642      In a pitiable state of mind, Soames walked away from the Post Office.  Gianapolis had hurried off in the direction of Victoria Station.  Something was wrong! Some part of the machine, of the dimly divined  machine whereof he formed a cog, was out of gear. Since the very nature  of this machine--its construction and purpose, alike--was unknown to  Soames, he had no basis upon which to erect surmises for good or ill.    His timid inquiries into the identity of East 18642 had begun and  terminated with his labored perusal of the telephone book, a profitless  task which had occupied him for the greater part of an evening.    The name, Gianapolis, did not appear at all; whereas there proved to be  some two hundred and ninety Kings. But, oddly, only four of these  were on the Eastern Exchange; one was a veterinary surgeon; one a  boat-builder; and a third a teacher of dancing. The fourth, an engineer,  seemed a \"possible\" to Soames, although his published number was not  18642; but a brief--a very brief--conversation, convinced the butler  that this was not his man.    He had been away from the flat for over an hour, and he doubted if even  the lax sense of discipline possessed by Mr. Leroux would enable that  gentleman to overlook this irregularity. Soames had a key of the outer  door, and he built his hopes upon the possibility that Leroux had not  noticed his absence and would not hear his return.    He opened the door very quietly, but had scarcely set his foot in the  lobby ere the dreadful, unforgettable scene met his gaze.    For more years than he could remember, he had lived in dread of the  law; and, in Luke Soames' philosophy, the words Satan and Detective  were interchangeable. Now, before his eyes, was a palpable, unmistakable  police officer; and on the floor...    Just one glimpse he permitted himself--and, in a voice that seemed to  reach him from a vast distance, the detective was addressing HIM!...    Slinking to his room, with his craven heart missing every fourth beat,  and"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/20293"],[0,"A Popular History of the Art of Music (#16)"],[1,"its most important aspects are  those in which it operates upon the European mind, awakening there  ideas which but for this stimulus might have remained dormant  centuries longer.    From the standpoint of the western world and the limited information  concerning the followers of Mahomet which enters into our educational  curricula, the Arab appears to us an inert figure, picturesque and  imposing, upon the sandy carpet of northern Africa, but a force of  little influence in the world of modern nineteenth-century thought.    Nevertheless, there was a time when this picturesque figure became  seized with an activity which shook Europe and Christendom to its very  center. The voice of the prophet Mahomet awakened the Arab from his  slumber. He aroused himself to the duty of proselyting the world to  the doctrine of the One God and the Great Prophet. With sword in hand  and the rallying cry of his faith he went forth, with such result that  a vast proportion of the inhabitants of the globe at this very hour  profess the tenets of his religion. Once awakened into life, he  penetrated the distant east, and brought back thence the foundation of  our arithmetic, the predecessor of our greatest of musical  instruments, the violin, and discovered for himself the productions of  the greatest of the Greek minds, the works of the philosopher  Aristotle. He established a new state in Spain, and for several  centuries confronted Christendom with the alternative of the sword or  his faith. One of the best characterizations of this people upon the  musical-literary side is that of the eminent M. Ginguene, who in his  \"History of Italian Literature,\" remarks as follows, concerning the  points under immediate consideration:    \"In the most ancient times the Arabs had a particular taste for  poetry, which among almost all people had opened a way to the most  elevated and abstract studies. Their language, rich, flexible and  abundant, favored their fertile imagination; their spirit lively and  sententious; their eloquence natural and artless, they declaimed with  energy the pieces they had composed, or they sang, accompanied with  instruments, in a very expressive chorus. These poems make upon the  simple and sensitive auditors a prodigious effect. The young poets  receive the praises of the tribe, and all celebrate their genius and  merit. They prepare a solemn festival. The women, dressed in their  most beautiful habits, sing a chorus before their sons and husbands  upon the happiness of their tribe. During the annual fair, where  tribes from a distance are gathered for thirty days, a large part of  the time is spent in a contest of poetry and eloquence. The works  which gain praise are deposited in the archives of the princess or  emirs. The best ones are painted or embroidered with letters of gold  upon silk cloth, and suspended in the temple at Mecca. Seven of these  poems had obtained this honor in the time of Mahomet, and they say  that Mahomet himself was flattered to see one of the chapters of the  Koran compared with these seven poems and judged worthy to be hung up  with them. Almansor, the second of the Abassides, loved poetry and  letters, and was very well learned in laws, philosophy and astronomy.  They say that in building the famous town of Bagdad he took the  suggestions from the astronomers for placing the principal building.  The university at Bagdad was honored and very celebrated. Copious  translations from the Greek were made, and many original treatises  produced in other parts of Arabia, but the most brilliant development  of Arabic letters was in Spain. Cordova, Grenada, Valencia were  distinguished for their schools, colleges and academies. Spain  possessed seventy libraries, open to the public in different towns,  when the rest of Europe, without books, without letters, without  culture, was sunk in the most shameful ignorance. A crowd of  celebrated writers enriched the Spanish-Arabic literature in all its  parts. The influence of the Arab upon science and literature extended  into all Europe; to him are owed many useful inventions. The famous  tower at Seville was built for the observatory. It is to be noticed,  however, that the Arabs, while taking much from the Greeks, did not  take any of their literature, properly so-called--neither Sophocles,  Euripides, Sappho, Anacreon, nor Demosthenes. The result is that their  own literature preserved its original character; they preserved also  in all purity the peculiarity of their music--an art in which they  excelled and in which the theory was very complicated. Their works are  full of the praises of music and its marvelous effect. They  attributed very powerful effects not alone to music sung, but to the  sound of certain instruments and to certain instrumental strings and  to certain inflections of the voice.\"    [Illustration: Fig. 23.    THE ARAB REBEC.]    The modern world is indebted to the Arab for at least three of its  most important instruments of music. The ravanastron he brought home  with him from India, and under the name Rebec it found its way into  Europe, where in an appreciative soil it grew and expanded into that  miracle of sonority and expression, the modern violin. The instrument  of the south of Europe during the latter part of the Middle Ages was  the lute, which had its origin in the Arab Eoud. (See Fig. 24.)    [Illustration: Fig. 24.    THE EOUD.]    Still more familiar to domestic eyes is that descendant of the Arab  santir, the modern pianoforte. This, under the name of psaltery,  begins to figure in manuscript as early as the ninth century. The Arab  canon, which is commonly taken as the immediate predecessor of the  pianoforte, had the important difference of being strung with catgut  strings. The essential foundation of the pianoforte was the metal  strings, necessitating hammers for inciting the vibrations, and  affording in the superior solidity incident to metal support a  firmness and susceptibility to development. This is the santir. It has  survived in Europe as the dulcimer, or the German hackbrett.    [Illustration: Fig. 25.    THE SANTIR.]    Yet while the Arab wrote so abundantly upon the subject of music, and  while it filled so prominent a part in his social and official life,  and in spite of his sagacity in seizing perfectible types of  instruments, there is very little in his treatment of the art which  need delay us in the present work. His music belongs entirely to the  ancient period of monody. He never had a harmony of combined sounds,  nor a scale with intervals permitting combined sounds. He was  sufficiently scientific to carry out the intonations of the  Pythagorean theory, and when he went beyond this and formed a scale  for himself he devised one which did not permit the association of  sounds into chord masses; and, more fatal still, he not only invented  such a scale, but carried it into execution so exactly that the ear of  the race was hopelessly committed to monody, and has remained so until  this very day. The scale of the Arabs in the latter times contained  twenty-two divisions in the octave, of which only the fifth and fourth  exactly correspond with the harmonic ratios. The place of the Arab in  music, therefore, is that of an unintentional minister to a higher  civilization and to the art of music.          CHAPTER VIII.    ORIGIN OF THE GREAT FRENCH EPICS.      One of the earliest developments of popular music on the continent was  that of the _Chansons de Geste_ (\"Songs of Action\"), which were, in  effect, great national epics. The period of this activity was from  about 800 to 1100 or 1200, and the greatest productions were the  \"Songs of Roland,\" the \"Song of Antioch,\" etc., translations of which  may be found in collections of mediaeval romances. The social  conditions out of which these songs grew have been well summarized by  M. Leon Gautier, in his \"_Les Epopees Francaises_\": \"If we transport  ourselves in imagination into Gaul in the seventh century, and casting  our eyes to the right, the left, and to all parts, we undertake to  render to ourselves an exact account of the state in which we find the  national poetry, the following will be the spectacle which will meet  our gaze: Upon one hand in Amorican Brittany there are a group of  popular poets who speak a Celtic dialect, and sing upon the harp  certain legends, certain fables of Celtic origin. They form a league  apart, and do not mix at all in the poetic movement of the great  Gallo-Roman country. They are the popular singers of an abased race,  of a conquered people. Toward the end of the twelfth century we see  their legends emerge from their previous obscurity and conquer a  sudden and astonishing popularity, which endured throughout all the  remainder of the Middle Ages. But in the seventh century they had no  profound influence in Gaul, and their voice had no echo except beyond  the boundary straits among the harpers and singers of England, Wales  and Ireland.    \"Upon another side, that of the Moselle, the Meuse and the Rhine, in  the country vaguely designated under the name of Austrasia, German  invasions have left more indelible traces. The ideas, customs and even  the language have taken on a Tudesque imprint. There they sing in a  form purely Germanic the '_Antiquissima Carmina_' [\"Most Ancient  Songs\"] which Charlemagne was one day to order his writers to compile  and put in permanent form. Between these two extreme divisions there  was a neutral territory where a new language was in process of  forming--that of the 'Oc' and 'Oil.' Here the songs were neither  German nor Gallo-Roman, but Romance. And here were the germs of the  future epics of France.\"    Out of this combination of contrasting spirits of race, the movement  of awakened national life, arose, first, what were called  Cantilenas--short songs of a ballad-like character. The language is a  mixture of German, Latin and French, intermingled"]]]
