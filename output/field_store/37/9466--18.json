My intention was to  share hospitality; to give him a bit of bacon, and then study him as I  ate my own dinner. He turned at the first suggestion of being driven,  came straight at my legs, and by a vicious slap of his tail left some of  his quills in me before I could escape. Then I drove him in the opposite  direction, whereupon he turned and bolted past me; and when I arrived at  camp he was busily engaged in gnawing the end from Simmo's ax handle.    However you take him, Unk Wunk is one of the mysteries. He is a  perpetual question scrawled across the forest floor, which nobody  pretends to answer; a problem that grows only more puzzling as you study  to solve it.    Of all the wild creatures he is the only one that has no intelligent  fear of man, and that never learns, either by instinct or experience,  to avoid man's presence. He is everywhere in the wilderness, until he  changes what he would call his mind; and then he is nowhere, and you  cannot find him. He delights in solitude, and cares not for his own  kind; yet now and then you will stumble upon a whole convention of  porcupines at the base of some rocky hill, each one loafing around,  rattling his quills, grunting his name _Unk Wunk! Unk Wunk!_ and doing  nothing else all day long.    You meet him to-day, and he is timid as a rabbit; to-morrow he comes  boldly into your tent and drives you out, if you happen to be caught  without a club handy. He never has anything definite to do, nor any  place to go to; yet stop him at any moment and he will risk his life to  go just a foot farther. Now try to drive or lead him another foot in the  same direction, and he will bolt back, as full of contrariness as two  pigs on a road, and let himself be killed rather than go where he was  heading a moment before. He is perfectly harmless to every creature; yet  he lies still and kills the savage fisher that attacks him, or even the  big Canada lynx, that no other creature in the woods would dare to  tackle.    Above all these puzzling contradictions is the prime question of how  Nature ever produced such a creature, and what she intended doing with  him; for he seems to have no place nor use in the natural economy of  things. Recently the Maine legislature has passed a bill forbidding the  shooting of porcupines, on the curious ground that he is the only wild  animal that can easily be caught and killed without a gun; so that a man  lost in the woods need not starve to death but may feed on porcupine, as  the Indians sometimes do. This is the only suggestion thus far, from a  purely utilitarian standpoint, that Unk Wunk is no mistake, but may have  his uses.    Once, to test the law and to provide for possible future contingencies,  I added Unk Wunk to my bill of fare--a vile, malodorous suffix that  might delight a lover of strong cheese. It is undoubtedly a good law;  but I cannot now imagine any one being grateful for it, unless the stern  alternative were death or porcupine.    The prowlers of the woods would eat him gladly enough, but that they are  sternly forbidden. They cannot even touch him without suffering the  consequences. It would seem as if Nature, when she made this block of  stupidity in a world of wits, provided for him tenderly, as she would  for a half-witted or idiot child. He is the only wild creature for whom  starvation has no terrors. All the forest is his storehouse. Buds and  tender shoots delight him in their season; and when the cold becomes  bitter in its intensity, and the snow packs deep, and all other  creatures grow gaunt and savage in their hunger, Unk Wunk has only to  climb the nearest tree, chisel off the rough, outer shell with his  powerful teeth, and then feed full on the soft inner layer of bark,  which satisfies him perfectly and leaves him as fat as an alderman.    Of hungry beasts Unk Wunk has no fear whatever. Generally they let him  severely alone, knowing that to touch him would be more foolish than to  mouth a sunfish or to bite a Peter-grunter. If, driven by hunger in the  killing March days, they approach him savagely, he simply rolls up and  lies still, protected by an armor that only a steel glove might safely  explore, and that has no joint anywhere visible to the keenest eye.    Now and then some cunning lynx or weasel, wise from experience but  desperate with hunger, throws himself flat on the ground, close by Unk  Wunk, and works his nose cautiously under the terrible bur, searching  for the neck or the underside of the body, where there are no quills.  One grip of the powerful jaws, one taste of blood in the famished throat  of the prowler--and that is the end of both animals. For Unk Wunk has a  weapon that no prowler of the woods ever calculates upon. His broad,  heavy tail is armed with hundreds of barbs, smaller but more deadly than  those on his back; and he swings this weapon with the vicious sweep of  a rattlesnake. It is probably this power of driving his barbs home by a  lightning blow of his tail that has given rise to the curious delusion  that Unk Wunk can shoot his quills at a distance, as if he were filled  with compressed air--which is, of course, a harmless absurdity that  keeps people from meddling with him too closely.    Sometimes, when attacked, Unk Wunk covers his face with this weapon.  More often he sticks his head under a root or into a hollow log, leaving  his tail out ready for action. At the first touch of his enemy the tail  snaps right and left quicker than thought, driving the hostile head and  sides full of the deadly quills, from which there is no escape; for  every effort, every rub and writhe of pain, only drives them deeper and  deeper, till they rest in heart or brain and finish their work.    Mooween the bear is the only one of the wood folk who has learned the  trick of attacking Unk Wunk without injury to himself. If, when very  hungry, he finds a porcupine, he never attacks him directly,--he knows  too well the deadly sting of the barbs for that,--but bothers and  irritates the porcupine by flipping earth at him, until at last Unk Wunk  rolls all his quills outward and lies still. Then Mooween, with immense  caution, slides one paw under him and with a quick flip hurls him  against the nearest tree, and knocks the life out of him.    [Illustration: \"BOTHERS AND IRRITATES THE PORCUPINE BY FLIPPING EARTH AT  HIM\"]    If he find Unk Wunk in a tree, he will sometimes climb after him and,  standing as near as the upper limbs allow, will push and tug mightily to  shake him off. That is usually a vain attempt; for the creature that  sleeps sound and secure through a gale in the tree-tops has no concern  for the ponderous shakings of a bear. In that case Mooween, if he can  get near enough without risking a fall from too delicate branches, will  wrench off the limb on which Unk Wunk is sleeping and throw it to the  ground. That also is usually a vain proceeding; for before Mooween can  scramble down after his game, Unk Wunk is already up another tree and  sleeping, as if nothing had happened, on another branch.    Other prowlers, with less strength and cunning than Mooween, fare badly  when driven by famine to attack this useless creature of the woods, for  whom Nature nevertheless cares so tenderly. Trappers have told me that  in the late winter, when hunger is sharpest, they sometimes catch a  wild-cat or lynx or fisher in their traps with his mouth and sides full  of porcupine quills, showing to what straits he had been driven for  food. These rare trapped animals are but an indication of many a silent  struggle that only the trees and stars are witnesses of; and the  trapper's deadfall, with its quick, sure blow, is only a merciful ending  to what else had been a long, slow, painful trail, ending at last under  a hemlock tip with the snow for a covering.    Last summer, in a little glade in the wilderness, I found two skeletons,  one of a porcupine, the other of a large lynx, lying side by side. In  the latter three quills lay where the throat had once been; the shaft of  another stood firmly out of an empty eye orbit; a dozen more lay about  in such a way that one could not tell by what path they had entered the  body. It needed no great help of imagination to read the story here of a  starving lynx, too famished to remember caution, and of a dinner that  cost a life.    Once also I saw a curious bit of animal education in connection with Unk  Wunk. Two young owls had begun hunting, under direction of the mother  bird, along the foot of a ridge in the early twilight. From my canoe I  saw one of the young birds swoop downward at something in the bushes on  the shore. An instant later the big mother owl followed with a sharp,  angry _hoo-hoo-hoo-hoo!_ of warning. The youngster dropped into the  bushes; but the mother fairly knocked him away from his game in her  fierce rush, and led him away silently into the woods. I went over on  the instant, and found a young porcupine in the bushes where the owl had  swooped, while two more were eating lily stems farther along the shore.    Evidently Kookooskoos, who swoops by instinct at everything that moves,  must be taught by wiser heads the wisdom of letting certain things  severely alone.    That he needs this lesson was clearly shown by an owl that my friend  once shot at twilight. There was a porcupine quill imbedded for nearly  its entire length in his leg. Two more were slowly working their way  into his body; and the shaft of another projected from the corner of his  mouth like a toothpick. Whether he were a young owl and untaught, or  whether, driven by hunger, he had thrown counsel to the winds and  swooped at Unk Wunk, will never be known. That he should attack so large  an animal as the porcupine would seem to indicate that, like the lynx,  hunger had probably driven him beyond all consideration for his mother's  teaching.    Unk Wunk, on his part, knows so very little that it may fairly be"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/22107"],[0,"Wood-Carving: Design and Workmanship (#16)"],[1,"in the rough.  Put behind this another frame of 3/4-in. thick stuff, and make the  cornice out of wood about 1-1/2 in. thick. The parts to be kept separate  until the carving is finished, and afterward glued or screwed together.  The carving on the body of the frame, that is, in the gable above and  the front of bracket below, should be in very low relief, the lower  part being like the last, a kind of engraving. The fret above may be  sunk about 1/16 in. and the ground slightly cushioned. The carving on  sides and cornice is of a stronger character, and may be cut as deeply  as the wood will allow, while the cornice is actually pierced through in  places, showing the flat board behind. The design for this cornice  should have some repeating object, such as the kind of pineapple-looking  thing in the illustration, and its foliage should be formed with plenty  of well-rounded surfaces, that may suggest some rather fat and juicy  plant.    [Illustration: FIG. 56.]    In Fig. 56 you have a suggestion for carving a bench or settle, the  proportions of which have been taken from one found at a Yorkshire  village inn. The actual measurements are given in order that these  proportions may be followed. It is a well-known fact, that chairs, or  seats of any kind, can not be successfully designed on paper with any  hope of meeting the essential requirements of comfort, lightness, and  stability. Making seats is a practical art, and the development of the  design is a matter of many years of successive improvements. A good  model should therefore be selected and copied, with such slight  changes as are necessary where carving is to be introduced. The main  lines should not be interfered with on any account, nor should the  thickness of the wood be altered if possible. The carving on this settle  is intended to be in separate panels, about two inches apart. These  panels will look all the better if no two are quite alike; a good way to  give them more variety will be to make every alternate one of some kind  of open pattern, like a fret. These piercings need not extend all over  the design in the panel in every case: some may have only a few shapely  holes mixed up with the lines, others again may be formed into complete  frets with as much open as solid. (See Fig. 57.)    The carving should be shallow, and not too fine in detail, as it will  get a great deal of rubbing. The material should be, if possible, oak;  but beech may be used with very good effect--in neither case should it  be stained or polished.    [Illustration: FIG. 57.]    Fig. 58 is a clock case. Something of this kind would make an excellent  \"opus\" such as I have alluded to, and give plenty of scope for  invention. As clocks of this kind are generally hung on a wall, the  brackets, from a practical point of view, are of course unnecessary, but  as it is important that they should _look_ as if they were supported and  to satisfy the eye, something in the way of a bracket or brackets is  generally added. A bracket like the one in the illustration, not being a  real support constructively speaking, but only put there to give  assurance that such has not been overlooked or neglected, becomes a kind  of toy, and may be treated as such by adding some little fancy to make  it amusing, and give an excuse for making a feature of it. This will be  a good place to try your hand at some modest attempt at figure work. In  designing your bracket, should you wish to introduce a little figure of  man or beast, I think you will find it more satisfactory if the figure  is separated from the structural part by a slight suggestion of solid  surroundings of its own. Thus the little roof over, and the solid bit of  wood under, the figure in the illustration serve this purpose, lending  an appearance of steadiness which would be wanting in a bracket formed  of a detached figure. At any rate, never make your figures, whether of  man or beast, seem to carry the clock; you may hunch them up into any  shape you like, but no weight should be supposed to rest upon them.    [Illustration: FIG. 58.]    For sake of the carving, oak will be the best wood to employ in making  this clock, or one like it, but Italian walnut will do equally well. The  size should be fairly large, say about three feet over all in height.  This will give a face of about ten inches in diameter, which face will  look best if made of copper gilt, and not much of it, perhaps a mere  ring, with the figures either raised or cut out, leaving nothing but  themselves and two rings surrounding. This should project from the wood,  leaving a space of about one inch.    [Illustration: FIG. 59.]    If you are inclined to try a heavier piece of work, the bench or  settle-end in Fig. 59 may give you a suggestion. In this there is a bird  introduced in the shape of a cock roosting on the branch of a tree. It  would require to be done in a thick piece of wood, say 3 ins. thick, and  would be best in English oak. The idea will be, to cut away the wood  from the outer lower portion, leaving only about 1-1/4 or 1-1/2 in.  thickness, but at the top retaining the full thickness; in which the  bird must be carved, the outer edges being kept full thickness in order  to give the structural form and enclose the carving. The inside of this  upper part, toward the seat, should also be carved, but with a smooth  and shallow pattern of some kind, as both may be seen together, and in  contrast to each other.    [Illustration: FIG. 60.]    The introduction of figures leads me to a subject which it will be  better to discuss in the next chapter, i.e., the question as to how far  it is possible or consistent with present conditions to attempt  anything that may bear the character of humor. But in the meantime here  are three more subjects upon which fancy and ingenuity may be expended  with profit. In Fig. 60 you have a heraldic subject. In all such cases  the heraldry should be true, and not of the \"bogus\" kind. This shield  represents a real coat of arms, and was done from a design by Philip  Webb, being finally covered with gesso, silvered and painted in  transparent colors.    Figs. 61 and 62 are suggestions for wooden crosses, oak being the best  material to use for such a purpose. The carving should be so arranged as  to form some kind of pattern on the cross. In Fig. 62 the black trefoils  are supposed to be cut right through the thin pieces of wood forming the  center portion, and the carving on that part is very shallow.    [Illustration: FIG. 61.]    [Illustration: FIG. 62.]          CHAPTER XIX    THE GROTESQUE IN CARVING           Misproportion not Essential to the Expression of Humor--The Sham       Grotesque Contemptible--A True Sense of Humor Helpful to the       Carver.      The dullness which comes of \"all work and no play\" may be said to affect  the carver at times. He tires of carving leaves and ornaments: what more  natural than to seek change and amusement in the invention of droll  figures of men or animals? The enjoyment which we all feel in  contemplating the outcome of this spirit in ancient work, leads us to  the imitation of both subject and manner, hoping thereby that the same  results may be obtained; but somehow the repetition is seldom attended  with much success, while of original fancies of the same sort we are  obliged to confess ourselves almost destitute. Who can behold the  fantastic humors of Gothic carvings without being both amused and  interested? Those grotesque heads with gaping mouths recall the stories  of childhood, peopled with goblins and gnomes. It is all so natural, and  so much in keeping with the architecture which surrounds it, the carving  is so rude and simple, that it seems absurd when some authority on such  matters makes a statement to the effect that all such expression of  humor has become forever impossible to ourselves.    This important part of the question must be left to your own meditation,  to settle according to your lights; experience will probably lead you  ultimately to the same opinion. Meantime, the point I wish to impress  upon you is this, that until you feel yourself secure, and something of  a master of various branches of your craft, you should not attempt any  subject which aims at being decidedly grotesque. There are very good and  practical reasons for this; one is, that while you are studying your  art, you must do nothing that may tend to obscure what faculties you  have for judging proportion. Now, as all grotesque work is based more or  less on exaggeration, it forms a very dangerous kind of exercise to the  beginner, therefore I should never allow a pupil of mine to so much as  attempt it. Do not think that I wish to discourage every effort which  has not an ultra-serious aim. On the contrary, I am but taking a rather  roundabout way to an admission that the humorous element has, and must  have at all times, a powerful attraction for the wood-carver; and to the  statement of an opinion that it should not be allowed to take a  prominent place in the work of a student; moreover, that it is quite  possible to find in nature a varied and unfailing source of suggestion  in this respect (more, in fact, than we are ever likely to account for),  and which requires no artificial exaggeration to aid its expression.  Some tincture of the faculty is absolutely necessary to the carver who  takes his subjects from birds or beasts, in order that he may perceive  and seize the salient lines and characteristic forms, of which the  key-note is often to be found in a faint touch of humor, and which, like  the scent of a flower, adds charm by appealing to another sense.    The same argument applies to the treatment of the human figure. Let no  student (and I may include, also, master-carver) think that a grotesque  treatment will raise the smile or excite the interest which is  anticipated. The \"grotesque\" is a vehicle for grim and often terrible  ideas, lightly veiled"]]]
