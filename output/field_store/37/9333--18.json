In the toilsome task of fixing the pattern, of laying the  foundations, of erecting the machinery, and of setting in operation the  Administrative Order of their Faith, in the execution of the successive  stages in the erection and exterior ornamentation of their Temple, in the  launching of the initial enterprise under 'Abdu'l-Baha's Divine Plan,  which enabled them to establish the structural basis of the Order,  recently laid in their homeland, in every republic of Central and South  America; in the sustained, the systematic and prodigious effort exerted  for the enlargement of the administrative foundations of the institutions  of their Faith in every state and province of the United States and the  Dominion of Canada; in the parallel endeavors aimed at the widespread  dissemination of its literature, and the proclamation of its verities and  tenets to the masses; in the launching of the Second Seven Year Plan,  which has extended the ramifications of the Divine Plan across the  Atlantic to ten sovereign states of the European continent and which has  already yielded a rich return through the formation of the first Canadian  Baha'i National Assembly and the convocation of the first European  Teaching Conference; in the repeated, the timely, the spontaneous and  generous contributions they have made, on numerous occasions, for the  relief of the persecuted among their brethren, for the defense of their  institutions, for the vindication of their rights, for the consolidation  of their activities and the progress of their enterprises--in all these the  champions of the Faith of Baha'u'llah have, with ever-increasing emphasis,  borne witness to the sublimity of the faith which burns within their  breasts, to the radiance of the vision that shines clearly and steadily  before their eyes, the sureness and rapidity that mark their gigantic  strides, and the vastness and glory of the unique mission entrusted to  their hands.    Milestones of historic significance have been successively reached and  rapidly left behind. A still stonier stretch of road now lies before them.  Rumblings of catastrophes yet more dreadful agitate with increasing  frequency a sorely stressed and chaotic world, presenting a challenge to  grapple with the unfinished tasks, a challenge graver and still more  pressing than any hitherto experienced.          PRESS FORWARD ON TEMPLE CONTRACTS      The present and remaining contracts, designed to consummate the  magnificent enterprise, initiated almost fifty years ago, in the heart of  the North American continent and complete an edifice consecrated for all  time by the loving hands of the Center of Baha'u'llah's Covenant,  constituting the foremost symbol of the Faith, and incarnating the soul of  the American Baha'i Community in the Western Hemisphere, must be speedily  and systematically carried out, however onerous the task may become, in  consequence of the inevitable fluctuations to which the present economic  conditions are subjected, in preparation for the jubilee that must mark  the completion of that holy edifice. The recent broadening of the  administrative basis of the Faith in a land that has served, and will long  remain the base of the spiritual operations now being conducted in both  hemispheres, in response to the ringing call of 'Abdu'l-Baha, sounded  three decades ago in His historic Tablets, must, no matter how arduous and  insistent the tasks to be performed in Latin America and Europe, be fully  maintained, and the process continually enlarged and steadily  consolidated. The various agencies designed to carry the Message to the  masses, and to present to them befittingly the teachings of its Author,  must, likewise, be vigilantly preserved, supported and encouraged. The  essential preliminaries, calculated to widen the basis of the forthcoming  Latin American national Baha'i assemblies, to familiarize the Latin  American believers with the administrative duties and functions they will  be called upon to discharge and to enrich and deepen their knowledge of  the essentials of their Faith, its ideals, its history, its requirements  and its problems, must be carried out with ever-increasing energy as the  hour of the emergence of these Latin American communities into independent  existence steadily and inexorably approaches. The necessary guidance,  which can alone be properly insured through the maintenance of an  uninterrupted extension of administrative assistance, through the  settlement of pioneers and the visits of itinerant teachers to the  daughter communities, must under no circumstances be completely withdrawn,  after their independence has been achieved. Above all, the momentous  enterprise initiated in the transatlantic field of service, so vast in  conception, so timely, so arduous, so far-reaching in its potentialities,  so infinitely meritorious, must in the face of obstacles, however  insurmountable they may seem, be continually reinvigorated through  undiminished financial support, through an ever-expanding supply of  literature in each of the required languages, through frequent, and  whenever possible prolonged, visits of itinerant teachers, through the  continued settlement of pioneers, through the consolidation of the  assemblies already established, through the early constitution of properly  functioning assemblies in the few remaining goal countries as yet deprived  of this inestimable blessing, and last but not least through the exertion  of sustained and concentrated efforts designed to supplement these foci of  Baha'i national administrative activity with subsidiary centers whose  formation will herald the inauguration of teaching enterprises throughout  the provinces of each of these ten countries.    As the dynamic forces, sweeping forward the First Seven Year Plan, on the  last stages of its execution, rose rapidly to a crescendo, culminating in  the nationwide celebrations marking the centenary of the Faith of  Baha'u'llah and synchronized with a further and still more precipitous  decline in the fortunes of a war-torn bleeding society, so must every  aggravation in the state of a world still harassed by the ravages of a  devastating conflict, and now hovering on the brink of a yet more crucial  struggle, be accompanied by a still more ennobling manifestation of the  spirit of this second crusade, whose consummation might well coincide with  a period of distress far more acute than the one through which humanity is  now passing.          CEASELESS EFFORT ESSENTIAL      Not ours to speculate, or dwell upon the immediate workings of an  inscrutable Providence presiding alike over the falling fortunes of a  dying Order and the rising glory of a Plan holding within it the seeds of  the world's spiritual revival and ultimate redemption. Nor can we attempt  as yet, whilst the second stage in the operation of such a Plan has not  yielded its destined fruit, to visualize the nature of the tasks, or  discern the character of the circumstances that will mark the progressive  unfoldment of a third successive crusade, the successful termination of  which must signalize the closing of the first historic epoch in the  evolution of the Divine Plan. All we can be sure of, and confidently  assert, is that upon the outcome of the assiduous efforts now being  collectively exerted, in three continents, by the North American, the  Latin and European believers, acting under the Mandate of 'Abdu'l-Baha,  associated with the one and only Plan conceived by Himself, aided by the  agencies deriving their inspiration from His Will and Testament, and  assured of the support promised by the pen of His Father, in His Most Holy  Book, must solely depend the timing as well as the nature of the tasks  which must be successfully carried out ere the closing of an epoch of such  transcendent brightness and glory in the evolution of the mightiest Plan  ever generated through the creative power of the Most Great Name, as  manifested by the Will of the Center of His Covenant and the Interpreter  of His Teaching.    There can be no doubt whatever that with every turn of the wheel, as a  result of the operation of 'Abdu'l-Baha's Plan, and with every extension  in the range of its evolution, a responsibility of still greater gravity  and of wider import will have to be shouldered by its divinely chosen  executors wherever its ramifications may extend and however oppressive the  state of the countries and continents in which they may have to labor.  They must strive, ceaselessly strive, ready for any emergency, steeled to  meet any degree of opposition, unsatisfied with any measure of progress as  yet achieved, prepared to make sacrifices far exceeding any they have  already willingly made, and confident that such striving, such readiness,  such resolution, such high-mindedness, such sacrifice will earn them the  palm of a victory still more soul-satisfying and resounding in its  magnificence than any as yet won since the inception of their mission.    May He Who called them into being and raised them up, Who fostered them in  their infancy, Who extended to them the blessing of His personal support  in their years of childhood, Who bequeathed to them the distinguishing  heritage of His Plan, Whose Will and Testament initiated them, during the  period of their adolescence, in the processes of a divinely appointed  Administrative Order, Who enabled them to attain maturity through the  inauguration of the first stage in the execution of His Plan, Who  conferred upon them the privilege of spiritual parenthood at the close of  the initial phase in the operation of that same Plan, continue through the  further unfoldment of"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/19270"],[0,"Directives from the Guardian (#16)"],[1,"to unite all people on a common basis of mutual understanding  and love, and in a common devotion to God.    \"Baha'i scholars and writers will, no doubt, gradually appear, and will as  promised by Baha'u'llah lend a unique support to the Faith. But in the  meantime, we should not tarry, or slacken in our efforts.\"            202: TEACHING (STUDY EARLY HISTORY AND PRINCIPLES OF THE FAITH)      \"I wish to urge the necessity of concentrating at your next summer  session, on the systematic study of the early history and principles of  the Faith, on public speaking, and on a thorough discussion, both formally  and informally, of various aspects of the Cause. These I regard as  essential preliminaries to a future intensive campaign of teaching in  which the rising generation must engage, if the spread of the Cause is to  be assured in that land.\"            203: TEACHING (THE UTMOST EFFORT)      \"I cannot refrain from adding a few words to renew and reaffirm my fervent  plea to you, and through you to every individual member of the American  Baha'i Community, to exert the utmost effort in order to further the Cause  of Teaching throughout the American Continent. Every possible assistance,  whether moral, financial, or administrative, should be continuously,  generously, and systematically extended to this most urgent, this sacred  and meritorious Cause. My heart yearns to learn of any speedy and  effective action which the valiant members of that community may  determine, whether collectively or severally, to undertake. The invisible  hosts of the Abha Kingdom are arrayed and ready to rush forth and ensure  the triumph of every stout-hearted and persevering herald of the Faith of  Baha'u'llah.            204: TEACHING (IN SOUTH)      \"Regarding the whole manner of teaching the Faith in the South; the  Guardian feels that, although the greatest consideration should be shown  the feelings of white people in the South whom we are teaching, under no  circumstances should we discriminate in their favour, consider them more  valuable to the Cause than their Negro fellow-southerners, or single them  out to be taught the Message first. To pursue such a policy, however  necessary and even desirable it may superficially seem, would be to  compromise the true spirit of our Faith, which permits us to make no such  distinctions in offering its tenets to the world. The Negro and white  races should be offered, simultaneously, on a basis of equality, the  Message of Baha'u'llah. Rich or poor, known or unknown, should be  permitted to hear of this Holy Faith in this, humanity's greatest hour of  need.    \"This does not mean that we should go against the laws of the State,  pursue a radical course which will stir up trouble, and cause  misunderstanding... Even in places where the two races can meet together  in the South, he feels it would be, in certain cases, preferable to teach  them separately until they are fully confirmed and then bring them  together...\"            205: TEACHING METHODS      \"The same thing is true of teaching methods; no system, for teachers to  practice, exists. But obviously the more people know about the teachings  and the Cause, the better they will be to present the subject. If some  people find that prayer and placing all their trust in God, releases in  them a flood of inspiration, they should be left free to pursue this  method if it is productive of results.    \"The inspiration received through meditation is of a nature that one  cannot measure or determine. God can inspire into our minds things that we  had no previous knowledge of, if He desires to do so.    \"We cannot clearly distinguish between personal desire and guidance, but  if the way opens, when we have sought guidance, then we may presume God is  helping us.\"            206: TEMPLE, CHANTING IN THE      \"As regard the chanting of Tablets in the Temple, Shoghi Effendi wishes in  this connection to urge the friends to avoid all forms of rigidity and  uniformity in matters of worship. There is no objection to the recital or  chanting of prayers in the Oriental language, but there is also no  obligation whatsoever of adopting such a form of prayer at any devotional  service in the auditorium of the Temple. It should neither be required nor  prohibited. The important thing that should always be borne in mind is  that with the exception of certain specific obligatory prayers,  Baha'u'llah has given us no strict or special rulings in matters of  worship, whether in the Temple or elsewhere. Prayer is essentially a  communion between man and God, and as such transcends all ritualistic  forms and formulae.\"            207: TESTS AND PROBLEMS      \"Ultimately all the battle of life is within the individual. No amount of  organization can solve the inner problems or produce or prevent, as the  case may be, victory or failure at a crucial moment. In such times as  these particularly, individuals are torn by great forces at large in the  world and, we see some weak ones strong, and strong ones fail--we can only  try, through loving advice, as your Committee has done, to bring about the  act on the part of the believer which will be for the highest good of the  Cause. Because obviously something bad for the Cause cannot be the highest  good of the individual Baha'i.\"            208: THEOCRACY      \"What the Guardian was referring to was the Theocratic systems, such as  the Catholic Church and the Caliphate, which are not divinely given as  systems, but man-made and yet, having partly derived from the teachings of  Christ and Muhammad are, in a sense, theocracies. The Baha'i theocracy, on  the contrary, is both divinely ordained as a system and, of course, based  on the teachings of the Prophet Himself... Theophany is used in the sense  of Dispensation...\"            209: TOMBSTONE, BAHA'I SYMBOL ON      \"In regard to your question regarding the use of the Greatest Name on  tombstones of Baha'is, the Guardian considers this too sacred to be placed  in such a position in general use, and the friends should not use it on  their tombstones. They can use quotations from the Teachings, if they wish  to, but not the Greatest Name. Naturally, if anyone has already used it,  it does not matter.\"    NINE-POINTED STAR FOR HEADSTONE    \"Approve star for graves.\" Cable of October 22, 1954.            210: TRANSLITERATION OF BAHA'I TERMS      \"...the faithful spelling of which by all the Western friends will avoid  confusion in future, and insure in this matter a uniformity which is  greatly needed at present in all Baha'i literature... I feel confident  that all the friends will from now on follow this system and adhere  scrupulously and at all times to this code in all their writings.    \"The preparation of Baha'i articles, committee reports, etc., should  therefore employ the system of transliteration which the Guardian has  supplied.\"            211: UNIVERSAL HOUSE OF JUSTICE, MEMBERSHIP      \"As regards your question concerning the membership of the Universal House  of Justice, there is a Tablet from 'Abdu'l-Baha in which He definitely  states that the membership of the Universal House is confined to men and  that the wisdom of it will be fully revealed in the future. In the local,  as well as the National Houses of Justice, however, women have the full  right of membership. It is therefore, only to the International House that  they cannot be elected. The Baha'is should accept this statement of the  Master in a spirit of deep faith, confident that there is a divine  guidance and wisdom behind it, which will be gradually unfolded to the  eyes of the world.\"    \"Regarding your question, the Master said the wisdom of having no women on  the International House of Justice, would become manifest in the future.  We have no other indication than this.    \"At present there are women on the International Council, and this will  continue as long as it exists, but when the International House of Justice  is elected, there will only be men on it, as this is the law of the  Aqdas.\"            212: VACCINATION      \"Regarding your question about vaccination:    \"These are technical matters which have not been specifically mentioned in  the Teachings, and consequently, the Guardian cannot make any statement  about them. No doubt medical science will progress tremendously as time  goes by and the treatment of disease becomes more perfect.\"            213: VISIONS      \"There is a fundamental difference between Divine Revelation as vouchsafed  by God to His Prophets, and the spiritual experiences and visions which  individuals may have. The latter should, under no circumstances, be  construed as constituting an infallible source of guidance, even for the  person experiencing them.\"            214: VOTING--(CIVIL)      \"The friends may vote, if they can do it, without identifying themselves  with one party or another. To enter the arena of party politics is surely  detrimental to the best interests of the Faith and will harm the Cause. It  remains for the individuals to so use their right to vote as to keep aloof  from party politics, and always bear in mind that they are voting on the  merits of the individual, rather than because he belongs to one party or  another. The matter must be made perfectly clear to the individuals, who  will be left free to exercise their discretion and judgment. But if a  certain person does enter into party politics and labors for the  ascendency of one party over another, and continues to do it against the  expressed appeals and warnings of the Assembly, then the Assembly has the  right to refuse him the right to vote in Baha'i elections.\"            215: VOTING RIGHT, THE      \"I feel I must reaffirm the vital importance and necessity of the right of  voting--a sacred responsibility of which no adult recognized believer  should be deprived, unless he is associated with a community that has not  as yet been in a position to establish a"]]]
