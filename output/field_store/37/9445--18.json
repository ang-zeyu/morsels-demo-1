The men 'll soon make a sailor of  you: you'll soon see what a seaman is; you'll larn ten times the  knowledge; an', add to that, you'll not be browbeat and looked jealous  on!\"    Well, next night, what does he do but follows what I said, and afore  long most of his troubles was over; nor there wasn't a willin'er nor a  readier hand aboard, and every man was glad to put Ned through anything  he'd got to do. The mates began to take note on him; and though the  'prentices never left off callin' him the Green Hand, before we rounded  the Cape he could take his wheel with the best of them, and clear away a  sternsail out of the top in handsome style. We were out ten months, and  Ned Collins stuck to the fork'sle throughout. When we got up the Thames,  he went ashore to see his mother in a check shirt, and canvas trowsers  made out of an old royal, with a tarpaulin hat I built for him myself.  He would have me to come the next day over to the house for a supper;  so, having took a kindness to the young chap, why, I couldn't say nay.  There I finds him in the midst of a lot o' soft-faced chaps and young  ladies, a spinning the wonderfullest yarns about the sea and the East  Ingees, makin' 'em swallow all sorts of horse-marines' nonsense, about  marmaids, sea-sarpents, and sich like. \"Hallo, my hearty!\" says he, as  soon as he saw me, \"heave a-head here and come to an anchor in this here  blessed chair.\" \"Young ladies,\" says he, \"this is Bob Jacobs, as I told  you kissed a marmaid hisself. He's a wonderful hand, is Bob, for the  fair!\" You may fancy how flabbergasted I was at this, though the young  scamp was as cool as you please, and wouldn't ha' needed much to make  him kiss 'em all round; but I was al'ays milk-an'-water along side of  women, if they topped at all above my rating. \"Well,\" thinks I, \"my lad,  I wouldn't ha' said five minutes agone there was anything of the green  about ye yet, but I see it will take another voy'ge to wash it all out.\"  For to my thinkin', mates, 'tis more of a land-lubber to come the rig  over a few poor creatures that never saw blue water, than not to know  the ropes you warn't told. \"O Mister Jacobs!\" says Missus Collins to me  that night, before I went off, \"d'ye think Edward's tired of that ere  horridsome sea yet?\" \"Well, marm,\" I says, \"I'm afeard not. But I'll  tell ye, marm,\" says I, \"if you want's to make him cut the consarn, the  only thing ye can do is to get him bound apprentice to it. From what  I've seen of him, he's a lad that won't bear aught again his liberty;  an' I do believe, if he thought he couldn't get free, he'd run the next  day!\" Well, after that, ye see, I didn't know what more turned up of it;  for I went myself round to Hull, and ships in a timber-craft for the  Baltic, just to see some'at new.    One day, the third voy'ge from that time, on getting the length of  Blackwall, we heared of a strong press from the men-o'-war; and as I'd  got a dreadful dislike to the sarvice, there was a lot of us  marchant-men kept stowed away close in holes an' corners till we could  suit ourselves. At last we got well tired, and a shipmate o' mine and I  wanted to go and see our sweethearts over in the town. So we hired the  slops from a Jew, and makes ourselves out to be a couple o' watermen,  with badges to suit, a carrying off a large parcel and a ticket on it.  In the arternoon we came back again within sight of the Tower, where we  saw the coast was clear, and made a fair wind along Rosemary Lane and  Cable Street. Just then we saw a tall young fellow, in a brown coat, an'  a broad-brim hat, standing in the door of a shop, with a paper under his  arm, on the look out for some one. \"Twig the Quaker, Bob!\" my shipmate  says to me. As soon as he saw us, out the Quaker steps, and says he to  Bill, in a sleepy sort of a v'ice, \"Friend, thou'rt a waterman, I  b'lieve?\" \"D---- it, yes,\" says Bill, pretty short like, \"that's what we  hails for! D'ye want a boat, master?\" \"Swear not, friend,\" says the  broad-brim; \"but what I want is this, you see. We have a large vessel,  belonging to our house, to send to Havannah, and willin' to give double  wages, but we can't find any mariners at this present for to navigate.  Now,\" says he, \"I s'pose this onfortunate state o' things is on account  of the sinful war as is goin' on--they're afraid of the risk. Hows'ever,  my friends,\" says he, \"perhaps, as you knows the river, ye could put us  upon a way of engagin' twenty or more bold mariners, as is not afeard of  ventering for good pay?\" and with this he looks into his papers; and  says Bill, \"Well, sir, I don't know any myself--do you, Bob?\" and he  gives me a shove, and says under the rose, \"no fear, mate,\" says Bill,  \"he's all over green--don't slip the chance for all hands of us at  Jobson's.\" \"Why, master,\" I says, \"what ud you give them mariners you  speaks on, now?\" \"Six pounds a month, friend,\" says he, looking up; \"but  we gives tea in place of spirits, and we must have steady men. We can't  wait, neither,\" says he, \"more nor three days, or the vessel won't sail  at all.\" \"My eye!\" says Bill, \"'twont do to lose, Bob!--stick to him,  that's all.\" \"Well, sir,\" I says, \"I thinks I does have a notion of  some't of the sort. If you sends your papers to Jobson's Tavern  to-night, in the second lane 'twixt Barnaby Street and the Blue Anchor  Road, over the water, why, I'll get ye as many hands to sign as you  wants!\" \"Thanks, friend,\" says the young broad-brim, \"I will attend to  thine advice,\"--so he bids us good day, and stepped into his door again.  \"Bill,\" says I, as he went off, \"now I think on it, I can't help a  notion I've seen that chap's face afore!\" \"Very like,\" says Bill, \"for  the matter o' that 'tis the same with me--them broad-brims is so much of  a piece! But that 'ere fellow don't know nothing of ships, sure enough,  or he wouldn't offer what he did, and the crimps' houses all of a swarm  with hands!\"    \"Take my word, mate,\" says I, \"it's a paying trip, or he wouldn't do  it--leave a Quaker alone for that! Why, the chap's a parfit youngster,  but I am blessed if he don't look as starched as if he'd sat over a desk  for twenty year!\"    Well, strike me lucky, mates all, if the whole affair warn't a complete  trap! Down comes a clerk with the papers, sure enough--but in ten  minutes more the whole blessed lot of us was puckalowed, and hard an'  fast, by a strong press-gang. They put us into a cutter off Redriff  Stairs, an' the next noon all hands was aboard of the Pandora frigate at  Sheerness. The first time of being mustered on deck, says Bill to me,  \"Cuss my eyes, Bob, if there isn't the 'farnal Quaker!\" I looked, and  sees a midshipman in uniform like the rest, and so it was. \"The sly  soft-sauderin' beggar!\" says I. \"All fair in war, and a press-mate!\"  says one o' the frigate's men. All the while I kept looking and looking  at the midshipman; and at last I says to Bill when we got below, giving  a slap to my thigh, \"Blessed if it ain't! it's the _Green Hand_  himself!\" \"Green Hand!\" says Bill, sulky enough, \"who's the Green Hand?  Blow me Bob, if I don't think we're the green hands ourselves, if that's  what you're upon!\" So I told him the story about Ned Collins. \"Well,\"  says he, \"if a fellow was green as China rice, cuss me if the reefers'  mess wouldn't take it all out on him in a dozen watches. The softest  thing I know, as you say, Bob, just now, it's to come the smart hand  when you're a lubber; but to sham green after that style, ye know, why,  'tis a mark or two above either you or I, messmate. So for my part, I  forgives the young scamp, 'cause I ought to ha' known better!\"    By the time the frigate got to sea, the story was blown over the whole  maindeck; many a good laugh it gave the different messes; and Bill, the  midshipman, and I, got the name of the \"Three Green Hands.\"    One middle-watch, Mister Ned comes for'ard by the booms to me, and says  he, \"Well, Bob Jacobs, you don't bear a grudge, I hope!\" \"Why,\" says I,  \"Mister Collins, 'twould be mutiny now, I fancy, you bein' my officer!\"  so I gave a laugh; but I couldn't help feeling' hurt a little, 'twas so  like a son turnin' against his father, as 'twere. \"Why Bob,\" says he,  \"did ye think me so green as not to know a seaman when I saw him? I was  afeared you'd know me that time.\" \"Not I, sir,\" I answers: \"why, if we  hadn't sailed so long in company, I wouldn't know ye now!\" so master Ned  gave me to understand it was all for old times he wanted to ship me in  the same craft; but he knew my misliking to the sarvice, though he said  he'd rather ha' lost the whole haul of 'em nor myself. So many a yarn we  had together of a dark night, and for a couple of years we saw no small  service in the Pandora. But if ye'd seen Ned the smartest reefer aboard,  and the best liked by the men, in the fore-taups'l bunt in a gale, or  over the maindeck hatch, with an enemy's frigate to leeward, or on a  spree ashore at Lisbon or Naples, you wouldn't ha' said there was  anything green in his eye, I warrant ye! He was made acting lieutenant  of a prize he cut out near Chairboorg, before he passed examination; so  he got me for prize bo'sun, and took her into Plymouth. Soon after that  the war was ended, and all hands of the Pandora paid off. Master Ned got  passed with flying colors, and confirmed lieutenant besides, but he had  to wait for a ship. He made me say where I'd be found, and we parted  company for about a year.    Well, I was come home from a short trip, and one day Leftenant Collins  hunts me up at Wapping Docks, where I'd had myself spliced, six years  before, to Betsy Brown, an' was laid up for a spell, havin' seen a good  deal of the sea. Ye must know the young leftenant was fell deep in love  with a rich Indy Naboob's daughter, which had come over to take her back  to' the East Indgees. The old fellow was hard"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/21530"],[0,"The Angel of Terror (#16)"],[1,"and stucco, and  did not seem built for permanent use.    They drove back part of the way they had come, on to the peninsula of  Cap Martin and she had a glimpse of beautiful villas between the pines  and queer little roads that led into mysterious dells. Presently the car  drew up before a good looking house (even Mrs. Cole-Mortimer was  surprised into an expression of her satisfaction at the sight of it).    Lydia, who thought that this was Mrs. Cole-Mortimer's own demesne, was  delighted.    \"You are lucky to have a beautiful home like this, Mrs. Cole-Mortimer,\"  she said, \"it must be heavenly living here.\"    The habit of wealth had not been so well acquired that she could realise  that she also could have a beautiful house if she wished--she thought of  that later. Nor did she expect to find Jean Briggerland there, and Mr.  Briggerland too, sitting on a big cane chair on the veranda overlooking  the sea and smoking a cigar of peace.    Mrs. Cole-Mortimer had been very careful to avoid all mention of Jean on  the journey.    \"Didn't I tell you they would be here?\" she said in careless amazement.  \"Why, of course, dear Jean left two days before we did. It makes such a  nice little party. Do you play bridge?\"    Lydia did not play bridge, but was willing to be taught.    She spent the remaining hour of daylight exploring the grounds which led  down to the road which fringed the sea.    She could look across at the lights already beginning to twinkle at  Monte Carlo, to the white yachts lying off Monaco, and farther along the  coast to a little cluster of lights that stood for Beaulieu.    \"It is glorious,\" she said, drawing a long breath.    Mrs. Cole-Mortimer, who had accompanied her in her stroll, purred the  purr of the pleased patron whose protegee has been thankful for favours  received.    Dinner was a gay meal, for Jean was in her brightest mood. She had a  keen sense of fun and her sly little sallies, sometimes aimed at her  father, sometimes at Lydia's expense, but more often directed at people  in the social world, whose names were household words, kept Lydia in a  constant gurgle of laughter.    Mrs. Cole-Mortimer alone was nervous and ill at ease. She had learnt  unpleasant news and was not sure whether she should tell the company or  keep her secret to herself. In such dilemma, weak people take the most  sensational course, and presently she dropped her bombshell.    \"Celeste says that the gardener's little boy has malignant smallpox,\"  she almost wailed.    Jean was telling a funny story to the girl who sat by her, and did not  pause for so much as a second in her narrative. The effect on Mr.  Briggerland was, however, wholly satisfactory to Mrs. Cole-Mortimer. He  pushed back his chair and blinked at his \"hostess.\"    \"Smallpox?\" he said in horror, \"here--in Cap Martin? Good God, did you  hear that, Jean?\"    \"Did I hear what?\" she asked lazily, \"about the gardener's little boy?  Oh, yes. There has been quite an epidemic on the Italian Riviera, in  fact they closed the frontier last week.\"    \"But--but here!\" spluttered Briggerland.    Lydia could only look at him in open-eyed amazement. The big man's  terror was pitiably apparent. The copper skin had turned a dirty grey,  his lower lip was trembling like a frightened child's.    \"Why not here?\" said Jean coolly, \"there is nothing to be scared about.  Have you been vaccinated recently?\" she turned to the girl, and Lydia  shook her head.    \"Not since I was a baby--and then I believe the operation was not a  success.\"    \"Anyway, the child is isolated in the cottage and they are taking him to  Nice to-night,\" said Jean. \"Poor little fellow! Even his own mother has  deserted him. Are you going to the Casino?\" she asked.    \"I don't know,\" replied Lydia. \"I'm very tired but I should love to go.\"    \"Take her, father--and you go, Margaret. By the time you return the  infection will be removed.\"    \"Won't you come too?\" asked Lydia.    \"No, I'll stay at home to-night. I turned my ankle to-day and it is  rather stiff. Father!\"    This time her voice was sharp, menacing almost, thought Lydia, and Mr.  Briggerland made an heroic attempt to recover his self-possession.    \"Cer--certainly, my dear--I shall be delighted--er--delighted.\"    He saw her alone whilst Lydia was changing in her lovely big  dressing-room, overlooking the sea.    \"Why didn't you tell me there was smallpox in Cap Martin?\" he demanded  fretfully.    \"Because I didn't know till Margaret relieved her mind at our expense,\"  said his daughter coolly. \"I had to say something. Besides, I'd heard  one of the maids say that somebody's mother had deserted him--I fitted  it in. What a funk you are, father!\"    \"I hate the very thought of disease,\" he growled. \"Why aren't you coming  with us--there is nothing the matter with your ankle?\"    \"Because I prefer to stay at home.\"    He looked at her suspiciously.    \"Jean,\" he said in a milder voice, \"hadn't we better let up on the girl  for a bit--until that lunatic doctor affair has blown over?\"    She reached out and took a gold case from his waistcoat pocket,  extracted a cigarette and replaced the case before she spoke.    \"We can't afford to 'let up' as you call it, for a single hour. Do you  realise that any day her lawyer may persuade her to make a will leaving  her money to a--a home for cats, or something equally untouchable? If  there was no Jack Glover we could afford to wait months. And I'm less  troubled about him than I am about the man Jaggs. Father, you will be  glad to learn that I am almost afraid of that freakish old man.\"    \"Neither of them are here--\" he began.    \"Exactly,\" said Jean, \"neither are here--Lydia had a telegram from him  just before dinner asking if he could come to see her next week.\"    At this moment Lydia returned and Jean Briggerland eyed her critically.    \"My dear, you look lovely,\" she said and kissed her.    Mr. Briggerland's nose wrinkled, as it always did when his daughter  shocked him.          Chapter XVIII      Jean Briggerland waited until she heard the sound of the departing car  sink to a faint hum, then she went up to her room, opened the bureau and  took out a long and tightly fitting dust-coat that she wore when she was  motoring. She had seen a large bottle of peroxide in Mrs.  Cole-Mortimer's room. It probably contributed to the dazzling glories of  Mrs. Cole-Mortimer's hair, but it was also a powerful germicide. She  soaked a big silk handkerchief in a basin of water, to which she added a  generous quantity of the drug, and squeezing the handkerchief nearly  dry, she knotted it loosely about her neck. A rubber bathing cap she  pulled down over her head, and smiled at her queer reflection in the  glass. Then she found a pair of kid gloves and drew them on.    She turned out the light and went softly down the carpeted stairs. The  servants were at their dinner, and she opened the front door and crossed  the lawn into a belt of trees, beyond which she knew, for she had been  in the house two days, was the gardener's cottage.    A dim light burnt in one of the two rooms and the window was  uncurtained. She saw the bed and its tiny occupant, but nobody else was  in the room. The maid had said that the mother had deserted the little  sufferer, but this was not quite true. The doctor had ordered the mother  into isolation, and had sent a nurse from the infection hospital to take  her place. That lady, at the moment, was waiting at the end of the  avenue for the ambulance to arrive.    Jean opened the door and stepped in, pulling up the saturated  handkerchief until it covered nose and mouth. The place was deserted,  and, without a moment's hesitation, she lifted the child, wrapped a  blanket about it and crossed the lawn again. She went quietly up the  stairs straight to Lydia's room. There was enough light from the  dressing-room to see the bed, and unwrapping the blanket she pulled back  the covers and laid him gently in the bed. The child was unconscious.  The hideous marks of the disease had developed with remarkable rapidity  and he made no sound.    She sat down in a chair, waiting. Her almost inhuman calm was not  ruffled by so much as a second's apprehension. She had provided for  every contingency and was ready with a complete explanation, whatever  happened.    Half an hour passed, and then rising, she wrapped the child in the  blanket and carried him back to the cottage. She heard the purr of the  motor and footsteps as she flitted back through the trees.    First she went to Lydia's room and straightened the bed, spraying the  room with the faint perfume which she found on the dressing table; then  she went back again into the garden, stripped off the dust coat, cap and  handkerchief, rolling them into a bundle, which she thrust through the  bars of an open window which she knew ventilated a cellar. Last of all  she stripped her gloves and sent them after the bundle.    She heard the voices of the nurse and attendant as they carried the  child to the ambulance.    \"Poor little kid,\" she murmured, \"I hope he gets better.\"    And, strangely enough, she meant it.           *       *       *       *       *    It had been a thrilling evening for Lydia, and she returned to the house  at Cap Martin very tired, but very happy. She was seeing a new world, a  world the like of which had never been revealed to her, and though she  could have slept, and her head did nod in the car, she roused herself to  talk it all over again with the sympathetic Jean.    Mrs. Cole-Mortimer retired early. Mr. Briggerland had gone up to bed the  moment he returned, and Lydia would have been glad to have ended her  conversation; since her head reeled with weariness, but Jean was very  talkative, until----    \"My dear, if I don't go to bed I shall sleep on the table,\" smiled  Lydia, rising and suppressing a yawn.    \"I'm so sorry,\" said the penitent Jean.    She accompanied the girl upstairs, her arm"]]]
