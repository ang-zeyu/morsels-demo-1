Most descriptions of women begin by telling how the individual looked  and what she wore. No pen-portraits of Clara Schumann have come down to  us, for the reason that she was too great, too elusive in spirit, for  any snapshot artist to attempt her. She never looked twice the same. In  feature she was commonplace, her form lacked the classic touch, and her  raiment was as plain as the plumage of a brown thrush in an autumn  hedgerow. She was as homely as George Eliot, Mary Wollstonecraft, Rosa  Bonheur, George Sand, or Madame De Stael. No two of the women named  looked alike, but I once saw a composite photograph of their portraits  and the picture sent no thrills along my keel. Their splendor was a  matter of spirit. Have you ever seen the Duse?--there is but one. In  repose this woman's face is absolute nullity. She starts with a  blank--you would never take a second glance at her at a pink tea. Her  dress is bargain day, her form so-so, her features clay.    But mayhap she will lift her hand and resting her chin upon it will look  at you out of half-closed eyes that never are twice alike. If you are  speaking you will suddenly become aware that she is listening, and then  you will become uncomfortable and try to stop, but can not; for you will  realize that you have been talking at random, and you want to redeem  yourself.    The presence of this plain woman is a challenge--she knows! Yet she  never contradicts, and when she wills it, she will lead you out of the  maze and make you at peace with yourself; for our quarrel with the world  is only a quarrel with self. When we are at peace with self we are at  peace with God.    The Duse is a surprise, in that her homeliness of face masks an  intellect that is a revelation. Her body is an exasperation to the tribe  of Worth, but it houses a soul that has lived every life, died every  death, known every sorrow, tasted every joy, and been one with the  outcast, the despised, the forsaken; and has stood, too, clothed in  shining raiment by the side of the great, the noble, the powerful.  Knowing all, she forgives all. And across the face and out of the eyes,  and even from her silence, come messages of sympathy--messages of  strength, messages of a faith that is dauntless. Great people are simply  those who have sympathy plus. Clara Schumann knew the excellence of her  chosen mate, and through her sympathy made it possible for him to  express himself at his highest and best. She also guessed his  limitations and sought to hold him 'gainst the calamity she saw looming  on the horizon, no bigger than a man's hand.    When he was moody and there came times of melancholy, she invited young  people to the house; and so Robert mingled his life with theirs, and in  their aspirations he shook off the demons of doubt.    It was in this way that he became interested in various rising stars,  and although in some instances we are aware that his prophecies went  astray, we know that he hailed Chopin and Brahms long before they had  come within the ken of the musical world, that so often looks through  the large end of the telescope. And this kindly encouragement, this  fostering welcome that the Schumanns gave to all aspiring young artists,  is not the least of their virtues. We love them because they were kind.           *       *       *       *       *    Clara Schumann was wise beyond the lot of woman. She knew this fact  which very few mortals ever realize: The triumphs of yesterday belong to  yesterday, with all of yesterday's defeats and sorrows--the day is Here,  the time is Now. She did not drag her troubles behind her with a rope,  nor wax vain over achievements done. When the light of her husband's  intellect went out in darkness and he lived for a space a lingering  death, she faced the dawn each morning, resolved to do her work and do  it the best she could.    When death came to Robert's relief, her one ambition, like that of Mary  Shelley, was to write her husband's name indelibly on history's page.    The professedly and professionally cheerful person is very depressing.  The pessimist always has wit, for wit reveals itself in the knowledge of  values. And the individual who accepts what Fate sends, and undoes  Calamity by drinking all of it, is sure to have a place in our calendar  of saints.    Clara Schumann, a widow at thirty-seven, with a goodly brood of babies,  and no income to speak of, lived one day at a time, did her work as well  as she could, and always had a little time and energy over to use for  others less fortunate.    Such fortitude is sure to bear fruit, and friends flocked to her as  never before. The way to secure friends is to be one.    Madame Schumann made concert tours throughout the Continent and England,  meeting on absolute equality the music-loving people, as well as the  Kings of Art. She played her husband's pieces with such a wealth of  expression that folks wondered why they had never heard of them. And so  today, wherever hearts are sad, or glad, and songs are sung, and strings  vibrate, and keys respond to love's caress, there is in hearts that know  and feel, a shrine; and on this shrine in letters of gold two words are  carved, and they are these: THE SCHUMANNS.          [Illustration: SEBASTIAN BACH]    SEBASTIAN BACH         The name of Bach would have been famous in musical history without       Johann Sebastian, but with his name added it becomes the most       illustrious that the world has ever known. Bach had many pupils,       but none surpassed his own sons, six of whom became great       musicians, but with these the musical faculty died.         --_Sir Hubert Parry_      SEBASTIAN BACH    The art of today is imitative. Once men had convictions, but we have  only opinions, and these are usually borrowed. The artificiality of  life, and the rush and the worry afford no time for great desires to  possess our souls.    We average well, but no Colossus looms large above the crowd and goes  his solitary way unmindful of the throng: we look alike, act alike,  think alike, and in order that the likeness may be complete, we dress  alike.    To wear a hat of your own selection or voice thoughts of your own  thinking is to invite unseemly mirth, and finally scorn and contumely.    The great creators were solitary, rural in their instincts, ignorant and  heedless of what the world was saying and doing. They were men of deep  convictions and enthusiasms, unmindful of laughter or ridicule, caring  little even for approbation.    No \"boom town\" can possibly produce a genius: it only fosters sundry  small Napoleons of finance. America is a nation of boomers--financial,  political, social and theological.    We have sarcasm and cynicism, and we possess much that is clever, all  produced by snatches of success, well mixed with disappointment and the  bitterness which much contact with the world is sure to evolve. Our age  that goes everywhere, knows everybody's business, and religiously reads  only \"the last edition,\" produces a Bill Nye, a Sam Jones, a Teddy  Roosevelt, a DeWitt Talmage, a Hopkinson Smith, a Sam Walter Foss, a  Victor Herbert; but it is not at all likely to produce a Praxiteles, a  Michelangelo, a Rembrandt, an Immanuel Kant or a Johann Sebastian Bach.           *       *       *       *       *    What Shakespeare is to literature, Michelangelo to sculpture, and  Rembrandt to portrait-painting, Johann Sebastian Bach is to organ-music.  He was the greatest organist of his time, and his equal has not yet been  produced, though nearly three hundred years have passed since his death.  \"The organ reached perfection at the hands of Bach,\" says Haweis. As a  composer for the organ, Bach stands secure--his position is at the head,  and is absolutely unassailable.    In point of temperament and disposition Bach bears a closer resemblance  to Michelangelo than to either of the others whose names I have  mentioned. He was stern, strong, self-contained, and so deeply religious  that he was not only a Christian but a good deal of a pagan as well. A  homely man was Bach--quiet, simple in tastes and blunt in speech.    The earnest way in which this plain, unpretentious man focused upon his  life-work and raised organ-music to the highest point of art must  command the sincere admiration of every lover of honest endeavor.    Bach was so great that he had no artistic jealousy, no whim, and when  harshly and unjustly criticized he did not concern himself enough with  the quibblers to reply. He made neither apologies nor explanations. The  man who thus allows his life to justify itself, and lets his work speak,  and who, when reviled, reviles not again, must be a very great and lofty  soul.    Bach was a villager and a rustic, and, like Jean Francois Millet, used  to hoe in his garden, trim the vines, play with his children, putting  them to bed at night, or in the day cease from his work to cut slices of  brown bread which he spread with honey for the heedless little  importuner, who had interrupted him in the making of a chorale that was  to charm the centuries. At times he would leave his composing to help  his wife with her household duties--to wash dishes, sweep the room or  care for a peevish, fretful child. After the evening prayer, like  Millet, again, when his household were all abed, he would often walk out  into the night alone, and traverse his solitary way along a wintry road,  through the woods or by the winding river, a dim, misty, shadowy figure,  spectral as the \"Sower,\" lonely as the \"Fagot-Gatherer,\" talking to  himself, mayhap, and communing with his Maker.    In his later years, when he traveled from one village or city to another  to attend musical gatherings, he was always accompanied by one or more  of his sons. His ambition was centered on his children, and his hope was  in them. Yet nothing has been added to either organ-building,  organ-playing or composition for the organ since his time."]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/20346"],[0,"Bell's Cathedrals: The Cathedral Church of Winchester (#16)"],[1,"rrey, which has all the Deanries in the  County of Surrey, the corps of which is the Rectory of Farnham; and it  is rated for First-Fruits at 91l. 3s. 6d.\"    The subsequent history of the see is mainly bound up with political and  theological questions which need not be touched on here. It may,  however, be mentioned that the Ecclesiastical Commission of 1836-7  re-adjusted the boundaries of the diocese; while in 1846 there were  transferred to London the following districts:--Battersea, Bermondsey,  Camberwell, Clapham, Graveney, Lambeth, Merton, Rotherhithe, Southwark,  Streatham, Tooting, and Wandsworth. This re-arrangement still left  Winchester the largest rural diocese in England.          CHAPTER V    THE BISHOPS OF WINCHESTER      Winchester boasts a very long list of bishops as compared with many of  our English cathedrals, but the details about a great number of them are  most scanty. The exact year from which the history of the diocese should  be dated is not certain, but it is to be placed somewhere during the  reign of Ine over the West Saxons. Under Bishop Eleutherius, to whom  Hedda succeeded, the kingdom of Wessex was still but a single diocese.  The removal of the see from Dorchester to Winchester was rendered  necessary by the extension of the Mercian rule, which made the former  town unsuitable for a West Saxon see. The date of the change,  simultaneous with the moving of the bones of S. Birinus, is fixed by  Rudborne at 683, but, according to recent authorities, it would appear  to be earlier.    #Hedda# (? 679-705) was, at any rate, the first bishop of Winchester,  properly speaking; though he was the fourth successor to S. Birinus. As  his most recent biographer says, Hedda \"was a man of much personal  holiness and was zealous in the discharge of his episcopal duties.... He  is reckoned a saint, his day being 30 July. Many miracles were worked at  his tomb.\" He figures on the reredos as restored in accordance with the  original design.    #Daniel# (705-744) had the misfortune to see his diocese considerably  docked in order to form the see of Sherbourne. He resigned, by reason of  loss of eyesight, in 744. According to some accounts, Ethelwulf,  afterwards king of Wessex, and father of Alfred, succeeded him; but this  story certainly lacks proof, though Ethelwulf seems to have been  educated at Winchester.    #Hunferth# or Humfredus (744-754), like most of the immediately  succeeding bishops, has his place of interment at Winchester recorded by  John of Exeter.    #Cyneheard# became Bishop of Winchester in 754. His successors during  the next century were #Aethelheard#, #Ecbald# (_circ._ 790); #Dudda#  (793); #Cyneberht# (_circ._ 799); #Almund# or Ealhmund (_circ._ 803);  #Wigthegen# (_circ._ 824); #Hereferth# (? 829-833); #Edmund# (833); and  #Helmstan#. Of none of these do we know much, and their dates cannot be  assigned with any certainty.    With #S. Swithun# (852-862), who was first prior and afterwards bishop,  we come upon one of the names especially connected with the history of  the church. It is, however, to be feared that it is not so much because  of his fame in church-building and his acts of humanity that he will be  remembered as for the popular superstition which asserts that the  weather for forty days after his feast-day on July 15 is dry or rainy  according to its state on that day. The legend is said to be based on  the fact that the removal of his body from \"a vile and unworthy place  where his grave might be trampled upon by every passenger and received  the droppings from the eaves\" to the golden shrine in the cathedral was  delayed by a long continuance of wet weather. Similar legends to explain  a wet summer are found elsewhere in Europe. \"The saint was translated,\"  says Rudborne, \"in the 110th year of his rest. And for his glory, so  great was the concourse of people and so numerous and frequent the  miracles that the like was never witnessed in England.\" A figure  representing S. Swithun seems once to have stood in a niche at the apex  of the gable of the west front.    He was succeeded by #Alhferth# or Ealhfrith (863-871), translated to  Canterbury; #Tunbriht# or Dunbert, whose name was Latinised as Tunbertus  (871-879); #Denewulf# (879-909), whom a singularly incredible legend  asserts to have been the swineherd in whose cottage Alfred allowed his  hostess's cakes to burn; #Frithstan# (909-931); #Byrnstan# (931-934);  #Aelfheah# or Elphege (934-951); #Aelfsige# (951-958), who was nominated  to Canterbury, but died in the snow while crossing the Alps on his way  to Rome for his pall--the only fact which is really known about him; and  #Brithelm# (958-963).    Next came \"the holy #Athelwold#, a great builder of churches and of  various other works, both when he was abbot and after when he became  bishop of Winchester\" (Wolstan). He seems to have moved the bodies of  Swithun and other saints to a more suitable resting-place than they had  hitherto enjoyed. Of Athelwold's building operations at Winchester  Wolstan's account is quoted on page 6. He held the see of Winchester for  twenty-one years (963-984), and he was by birth a native of the town. It  was said of him that he was \"terrible as a lion\" to the rebellious, but  \"gentler than a dove\" to the meek.    #Elphege# or Aelfheah (984-1005), his successor, to whom Wolstan's  account of Athelwold is addressed, was martyred in 1012 by the Danes  while Archbishop of Canterbury, where his tomb subsequently received  great honours. Aelfheah's great work was spent in the conversion of the  \"Northmen,\" or Danish invaders of England.    #Cenwulf# or Kenulf (1005-1006) is allowed three years by Rudborne, but  apparently wrongly; another #Athelwold# or Ethelwold (1006-1015), and  #Aelfsige# (1015-1032) are not of great importance.    #Aelfwine# or Alwyn (1032-1037), called by Anglo-Saxon chroniclers \"the  king's priest,\" seems to have been a monk of S. Swithun's monastery and  also chaplain to Cnut before he was elevated to Winchester. The legend  which makes him the lover of Emma, widow of Aethelred and Cnut, and  mother of Edward the Confessor, has been declared unhistorical; but, at  any rate, the story of her ordeal, when she walked blindfold and  barefoot over nine red-hot plough-shares, was once celebrated. It is a  curious coincidence that the bones of queen and bishop were deposited by  Bishop Fox in the same chest, Aelfwine's remains being exhumed from his  grave to the south of the high altar to be placed in a leaden  sarcophagus above the crypt-door.    #Stigand# (1047-1069) was chiefly remarkable, it appears, for his  avarice, especially shown in his retention of Winchester after his  election to Canterbury. He received the pall in 1058 from the  \"anti-Pope\" Benedict X., so that he was never regarded as the rightful  possessor of the dignities he enjoyed, the Normans refusing to recognise  him except as bishop of Winchester. His wealth attracted the attention  of William the Conqueror, and by a Council held at Winchester after  Easter 1070, Stigand was deposed. Some reports state that he was cast  into prison, where he died of voluntary starvation; and that on his body  was found a key of a casket containing the clue to great hidden  treasures, which the king appropriated, giving from them, says Rudborne,  a great silver cross with two images; but the cross is generally called  Stigand's. He was buried in a leaden sarcophagus to the south of the  high altar.    #Walkelin# (1070-1098) was related by blood to the Conqueror, and was  brother of Simeon, prior of Winchester and afterwards abbot of Ely. He  was the first of the Norman bishops, and signalised his incumbency by  rebuilding the cathedral from its very foundations, as the Norman  ecclesiastics frequently did. He figures more largely in the  architectural history of the cathedral than in its historical records,  and his work has been described elsewhere. Walkelin was buried in the  nave before the rood-loft, where stood the great silver cross.    #William Giffard# (1100-1129) succeeded after an interregnum such as  occurred in many sees during the reign of William Rufus. He founded S.  Mary Overy, now S. Saviour's, Southwark, as well as the bishop's  residence in the same district. Before his death he became a monk.    #Henry de Blois# (1129-1171) was grandson of the Conqueror and younger  brother of Stephen, afterwards King of England. Although an ecclesiastic  from his youth, he was by no means a man of peace or a mere scholar and  theologian; _Vir animosus et audax_, says Giraldus. During his prelacy  he influenced greatly the secular history of his time. In the quarrel  between Matilda and Stephen, Henry at first recognised Matilda, but  subsequently, as the foremost power in the church and a strong partisan  of his brother, he lent his weight against the Empress, and, with the  aid of Roger of Salisbury and other bishops, gained the crown for  Stephen. On Whitsunday 1162 Henry de Blois consecrated Thomas a Becket  as archbishop, and it is said that when King Henry visited him just  before his death he was reproved by the bishop for his murder of Becket.  Henry de Blois was certainly a militant churchman; but in an age not  conspicuous for such virtues, we are told, his private life was pure,  and he laboured steadfastly for the good of his diocese. The Winchester  annalist says of him, \"Never was man more chaste and prudent, more  compassionate, or more earnest in transacting ecclesiastical matters, or  in beautifying churches.\" His great foundation was the still existing  hospital of St Cross.    #Richard Toclive# (1174-1188) was elected by the monks after the see had  been vacant three years. He was strongly against Becket, having even  been excommunicated by him; yet after the archbishop was murdered and  canonised he dedicated to him several new churches at Portsmouth,  Newport, and elsewhere. He founded a small hospital at Winchester"]]]
