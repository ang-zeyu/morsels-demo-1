All the metallic oxides,  except a few of the native and rarer oxides, are dissolved by it with  the formation of chlorides of the metal and water.    ~Dilute Hydrochloric Acid~ is made by diluting the strong acid with an  equal volume of water. This is used for dissolving precipitates obtained  in the general course of analysis and the more easily soluble metals.    ~Hydrofluoric Acid, HF.~--A solution in water may be purchased in  gutta-percha or lead bottles. It is of variable strength and doubtful  purity. It must always be examined quantitatively for the residue left  on evaporation. It is used occasionally for the examination of  silicates. It attacks silica, forming fluoride of silicon, which is a  gas. When the introduction of another base will not interfere with the  assay, the substance may be mixed in the platinum dish with fluoride of  ammonium, or of potassium, or of calcium, and hydrochloric acid,  instead of treating it with the commercial acid. It is only required in  special work. The fumes and acid are dangerous, and, of course, glass or  porcelain vessels cannot be used with it.    ~Iodine, I.~--This can be obtained in commerce quite pure, and is often  used for standardising. It is very slightly soluble in water, but  readily dissolves in potassium iodide solution. It closely resembles  chlorine and bromine in its properties, and can be used for dissolving  metals without, at the same time, attacking any oxide which may be  present. It is chiefly used as an oxidizing agent in volumetric work,  being sharp in its reactions and easily detected in minute quantities.  It cannot be used in alkaline solutions, since it reacts with the  hydrates, and even with the carbonates, to form iodides and iodates.  Iodine is soluble in alcohol.    ~Nitric Acid, HNO_{3}.~ (Sp. gr. 1.42; boiling point 121° C.; contains  70 per cent. by weight of hydrogen nitrate).--It is convenient to  remember that one c.c. of this contains 1 gram of real acid. It combines  the properties of an acid and of an oxidising agent. One c.c. contains  0.76 gram of oxygen, most of which is very loosely held, and easily  given up to metals and other oxidisable substances. Consequently it will  dissolve many metals, &c., upon which hydrochloric acid has no action.  All sulphides (that of mercury excepted) are attacked by it, and for the  most part rendered soluble. It has no action on gold or platinum, and  very little on aluminium. The strong acid at the ordinary temperature  does not act on iron or tin; and in most cases it acts better when  diluted. Some nitrates being insoluble in nitric acid, form a protecting  coat to the metal which hinders further action. Where the strong acid  does act the action is very violent, so that generally it is better to  use the dilute acid. When iron has been immersed in strong nitric acid  it not only remains unacted on, but assumes a _passive_ state; so that  if, after being wiped, it is then placed in the dilute acid, it will not  dissolve. Tin and antimony are converted into insoluble oxides, while  the other metals (with the exception of those already mentioned)  dissolve as nitrates. During the solution of the metal red fumes are  given off, which mainly consist of nitrogen peroxide. The solution is  often coloured brown or green because of dissolved oxides of nitrogen,  which must be got rid of by boiling. Generally some ammonium nitrate is  formed, especially in the cases of zinc, iron, and tin, when these are  acted on by cold dilute acid. Sulphur, phosphorus, and arsenic are  converted into sulphuric, phosphoric, and arsenic acids respectively,  when boiled with the strong acid.    ~Dilute Nitric Acid.~--Dilute 1 volume of the strong acid with 2 of  water.    ~Oxalic Acid~, H_{2}[=O] or (H_{2}C_{2}O_{4}.2H_{2}O.)--This is an organic  acid in colourless crystals. It forms a family of salts--the oxalates.  It is used in standardising; being a crystallised and permanent acid, it  can be readily weighed. It is also used in separations, many of the  oxalates being insoluble. For general use make a 10 per cent. solution.  Use the commercially pure acid. On ignition the acid should leave no  residue.    [Illustration: FIG. 32.]    ~Sulphuretted Hydrogen.~ Hydrosulphuric acid, SH_{2}.--A gas largely  used in assaying, since by its action it allows of the metals being  conveniently classed into groups. It is soluble in water, this liquid  dissolving at the ordinary temperature about three times its volume of  the gas. The solution is only useful for testing. In separations, a  current of the gas must always be used. It is best prepared in an  apparatus like that shown in fig. 32, by acting on ferrous sulphide with  dilute hydrochloric acid. When iron has to be subsequently determined in  the assay solution, the gas should be washed by bubbling it through  water in the smaller bottle; but for most purposes washing can be  dispensed with. The gas is very objectionable, and operations with it  must be carried out in a cupboard with a good draught. When the  precipitation has been completed, the apparatus should always be washed  out. The effect of this acid on solutions of the metals is to form  sulphides. All the metallic sulphides are insoluble in water; but some  are soluble in alkaline, and some in acid, solutions. If sulphuretted  hydrogen is passed through an acid solution containing the metals till  no further precipitation takes place, a precipitate will be formed  containing sulphides insoluble in the acid. On filtering, adding ammonia  (to render the filtrate alkaline), and again passing the gas, a further  precipitate will be obtained, consisting of sulphides insoluble in an  alkaline solution, but not precipitable in an acid one; the filtrate may  also contain sulphides not precipitable in an acid solution, which are  soluble in an alkaline one; these will be thrown down on neutralising.  Again, the metals precipitated in the acid solution form sulphides which  may be divided into groups, the one consisting of those which are  soluble, and the other of those which are not soluble, in alkalies. This  classification is shown in the following summary:--    1. _Precipitable in an acid solution._    (a) Soluble in Alkalies.--Sulphides of As, Sb, Sn, Au, Pt, Ir, Mo, Te,  and Se.    (b) Insoluble in Alkalies.--Sulphides of Ag, Pb, Hg, Bi, Cu, Cd, Pd, Rh,  Os, and Ru.    2. _Not precipitated in an acid solution, but thrown down in an alkaline  one._    Sulphides of Mn, Zn, Fe, Ni, Co, In, Tl, and Ga.    These can again be divided into those which are dissolved by dilute  acids and those which are not.    3. _Not precipitated in an acid or alkaline solution, but thrown  down on neutralising the latter._    Sulphides of V and W.    Sulphuretted hydrogen is a strong reducing agent. Ferric salts are  thereby quickly reduced to ferrous; in hot solutions nitric acid is  decomposed. These changes are marked by a precipitation of sulphur, and  the student must be careful to pass the gas sufficiently long, and not  be too hasty in concluding that no sulphide will form because it does  not at once make its appearance. The best indication that it has been  passed long enough is the smell of the gas in the solution after  shaking.    ~Sulphurous Acid~, H_{2}SO_{3}.--The reagent used may be regarded as a  saturated solution of sulphur dioxide in water. It may be purchased, and  keeps for a long time. It may be made by heating copper with sulphuric  acid and passing the gas formed into water. The heat should be withdrawn  when the gas is coming off freely. It is used as a reducing agent, and  should not be diluted.    ~Sulphuric Acid~, H_{2}SO_{4}. (Sp. gr. 1.84, containing 96 per cent. of  real acid, H_{2}SO_{4}.)--This acid forms insoluble sulphates with salts  of lead, strontium, and barium. It has a high boiling point, 290° C.,  and, when evaporated with salts of the more volatile acids, converts  them into sulphates. When nitrates or chlorides are objectionable in a  solution, evaporation with sulphuric acid removes them. In working with  this acid caution is necessary, since, on mixing with water, great heat  is evolved; and, if either the acid or water has been previously heated,  a serious accident may result. In diluting the acid it should be poured  into cold water. Glass vessels containing boiling sulphuric acid should  be handled as little as possible, and should not be cooled under the  tap. The action of diluted sulphuric acid on metals closely resembles  that of dilute hydrochloric acid. Magnesium, aluminium, iron, zinc,  nickel, cobalt, manganese, and cadmium dissolve, with evolution of  hydrogen, in the cold acid, or when warmed. The action of hot and strong  sulphuric acid is altogether different; it acts as an oxidising agent,  and is itself reduced to sulphur dioxide or even to sulphur. The  following metals are attacked in this way:--copper, bismuth, mercury,  silver, antimony, tin, and lead. Gold, platinum, and arsenic are not  affected. This property is made use of in parting silver from gold and  platinum. Metallic sulphides are similarly attacked; but this method of  opening up minerals has the disadvantage of giving rise to the formation  of anhydrous sulphates of iron, &c., which are not readily dissolved  when afterwards diluted. The use of sulphuric acid in assaying is (for  these reasons) to be avoided. Its chief use is as a drying agent, since  it has a strong affinity for water. Air under a bell jar may be kept dry  by means of a basin of sulphuric acid, and gases bubbled through it are  freed from water-vapour.    ~Dilute Sulphuric Acid.~--This is made by diluting 1 volume of the  strong acid with 4 of water.    ~Tartaric Acid~, H_{2}[=T] or C_{4}H_{6}O_{6}.--A crystallised organic  acid, soluble in less than its own weight of water, or in less than  three parts of alcohol. It is used for the same purposes as citric acid  is. The solution is made when required.

Therefore  science and understanding are more certain than faith.    Obj. 3: Further, in matters concerning the intellect, the more  perfect is the more certain. Now understanding is more perfect than  faith, since faith is the way to understanding, according to another  version [*The Septuagint] of Isa. 7:9: \"If you will not believe, you  shall not understand [Vulg.: 'continue']\": and Augustine says (De  Trin. xiv, 1) that \"faith is strengthened by science.\" Therefore it  seems that science or understanding is more certain than faith.    _On the contrary,_ The Apostle says (1 Thess. 2:15): \"When you had  received of us the word of the hearing,\" i.e. by faith . . . \"you  received it not as the word of men, but, as it is indeed, the word  of God.\" Now nothing is more certain than the word of God. Therefore  science is not more certain than faith; nor is anything else.    _I answer that,_ As stated above (I-II, Q. 57, A. 4, ad 2) two of the  intellectual virtues are about contingent matter, viz. prudence and  art; to which faith is preferable in point of certitude, by reason of  its matter, since it is about eternal things, which never change,  whereas the other three intellectual virtues, viz. wisdom, science  [*In English the corresponding 'gift' is called knowledge] and  understanding, are about necessary things, as stated above (I-II, Q.  57, A. 5, ad 3). But it must be observed that wisdom, science and  understanding may be taken in two ways: first, as intellectual  virtues, according to the Philosopher (Ethic. vi, 2, 3); secondly,  for the gifts of the Holy Ghost. If we consider them in the first  way, we must note that certitude can be looked at in two ways. First,  on the part of its cause, and thus a thing which has a more certain  cause, is itself more certain. In this way faith is more certain than  those three virtues, because it is founded on the Divine truth,  whereas the aforesaid three virtues are based on human reason.  Secondly, certitude may be considered on the part of the subject, and  thus the more a man's intellect lays hold of a thing, the more  certain it is. In this way, faith is less certain, because matters of  faith are above the human intellect, whereas the objects of the  aforesaid three virtues are not. Since, however, a thing is judged  simply with regard to its cause, but relatively, with respect to a  disposition on the part of the subject, it follows that faith is more  certain simply, while the others are more certain relatively, i.e.  for us. Likewise if these three be taken as gifts received in this  present life, they are related to faith as to their principle which  they presuppose: so that again, in this way, faith is more certain.    Reply Obj. 1: This doubt is not on the side of the cause of faith,  but on our side, in so far as we do not fully grasp matters of faith  with our intellect.    Reply Obj. 2: Other things being equal sight is more certain than  hearing; but if (the authority of) the person from whom we hear  greatly surpasses that of the seer's sight, hearing is more certain  than sight: thus a man of little science is more certain about what  he hears on the authority of an expert in science, than about what is  apparent to him according to his own reason: and much more is a man  certain about what he hears from God, Who cannot be deceived, than  about what he sees with his own reason, which can be mistaken.    Reply Obj. 3: The gifts of understanding and knowledge are more  perfect than the knowledge of faith in the point of their greater  clearness, but not in regard to more certain adhesion: because the  whole certitude of the gifts of understanding and knowledge, arises  from the certitude of faith, even as the certitude of the knowledge  of conclusions arises from the certitude of premisses. But in so far  as science, wisdom and understanding are intellectual virtues, they  are based upon the natural light of reason, which falls short of the  certitude of God's word, on which faith is founded.  _______________________    QUESTION 5    OF THOSE WHO HAVE FAITH  (In Four Articles)    We must now consider those who have faith: under which head there are  four points of inquiry:    (1) Whether there was faith in the angels, or in man, in their  original state?    (2) Whether the demons have faith?    (3) Whether those heretics who err in one article, have faith in  others?    (4) Whether among those who have faith, one has it more than another?  _______________________    FIRST ARTICLE [II-II, Q. 5, Art. 1]    Whether There Was Faith in the Angels, or in Man, in Their Original  State?    Objection 1: It would seem that there was no faith, either in the  angels, or in man, in their original state. For Hugh of S. Victor  says in his Sentences (De Sacram. i, 10) that \"man cannot see God or  things that are in God, because he closes his eyes to contemplation.\"  Now the angels, in their original state, before they were either  confirmed in grace, or had fallen from it, had their eyes opened to  contemplation, since \"they saw things in the Word,\" according to  Augustine (Gen. ad lit. ii, 8). Likewise the first man, while in the  state of innocence, seemingly had his eyes open to contemplation; for  Hugh St. Victor says (De Sacram. i, 6) that \"in his original state  man knew his Creator, not by the mere outward perception of hearing,  but by inward inspiration, not as now believers seek an absent God by  faith, but by seeing Him clearly present to their contemplation.\"  Therefore there was no faith in the angels and man in their original  state.    Obj. 2: Further, the knowledge of faith is dark and obscure,  according to 1 Cor. 13:13: \"We see now through a glass in a dark  manner.\" Now in their original state there was not obscurity either  in the angels or in man, because it is a punishment of sin. Therefore  there could be no faith in the angels or in man, in their original  state.    Obj. 3: Further, the Apostle says (Rom. 10:17) that \"faith . . .  cometh by hearing.\" Now this could not apply to angels and man in  their original state; for then they could not hear anything from  another. Therefore, in that state, there was no faith either in man  or in the angels.    _On the contrary,_ It is written (Heb. 11:6): \"He that cometh to God,  must believe.\" Now the original state of angels and man was one of  approach to God. Therefore they had need of faith.    _I answer that,_ Some say that there was no faith in the angels before  they were confirmed in grace or fell from it, and in man before he  sinned, by reason of the manifest contemplation that they had of  Divine things. Since, however, \"faith is the evidence of things that  appear not,\" according to the Apostle (Heb. 11:2), and since \"by faith  we believe what we see not,\" according to Augustine (Tract. xl in  Joan.; QQ. Evang. ii, qu. 39), that manifestation alone excludes  faith, which renders apparent or seen the principal object of faith.  Now the principal object of faith is the First Truth, the sight of  which gives the happiness of heaven and takes the place of faith.  Consequently, as the angels before their confirmation in grace, and  man before sin, did not possess the happiness whereby God is seen in  His Essence, it is evident that the knowledge they possessed was not  such as to exclude faith.    It follows then, that the absence of faith in them could only be  explained by their being altogether ignorant of the object of faith.  And if man and the angels were created in a purely natural state, as  some [*St. Bonaventure, Sent. ii, D, 29] hold, perhaps one might hold  that there was no faith in the angels before their confirmation in  grace, or in man before sin, because the knowledge of faith surpasses  not only a man's but even an angel's natural knowledge about God.    Since, however, we stated in the First Part (Q. 62, A. 3; Q. 95, A.  1) that man and the angels were created with the gift of grace, we  must needs say that there was in them a certain beginning of  hoped-for happiness, by reason of grace received but not yet  consummated, which happiness was begun in their will by hope and  charity, and in the intellect by faith, as stated above (Q. 4, A. 7).  Consequently we must hold that the angels had faith before they were  confirmed, and man, before he sinned. Nevertheless we must observe  that in the object of faith, there is something formal, as it were,  namely the First Truth surpassing all the natural knowledge of a  creature, and something material, namely, the thing to which we  assent while adhering to the First Truth. With regard to the former,  before obtaining the happiness to come, faith is common to all who  have knowledge of God, by adhering to the First Truth: whereas with  regard to the things which are proposed as the material object of  faith, some are believed by one, and known manifestly by another,  even in the present state, as we have shown above (Q. 1, A. 5; Q. 2,  A. 4, ad 2). In this respect, too, it may be said that the angels  before being confirmed, and man, before sin, possessed manifest  knowledge about certain points in the Divine mysteries, which now we  cannot know except by believing them.    Reply Obj. 1: Although the words of Hugh of S. Victor are those of a  master, and have the force of an authority, yet it may be said that  the contemplation which removes the need of faith is heavenly  contemplation, whereby the supernatural truth is seen in its essence.  Now the angels did not possess this contemplation before they were  confirmed, nor did man before he sinned: yet their contemplation was  of a higher order than ours, for by its means they approached nearer  to God, and had manifest knowledge of more of the Divine effects and  mysteries than we can have knowledge of. Hence faith was not in them  so that they sought an absent God as we seek Him: since by the light  of wisdom"]]]
