We were entering a district of great poverty. At Tchih-li-pu, where we  arrived at midday the next day, the houses are poor, the people  poverty-stricken and ill-clad, the hotel dirty, and my room the worst I  had yet slept in. The road is a well-worn path flagged in places,  uneven, and irregular, following at varying heights the upward course of  the tortuous river. The country is bald; it is grand but lonely;  vegetation is scanty and houses are few; we have left the prosperity of  Szechuen, and are in the midst of the poverty of Yunnan. Farmhouses  there are at rare intervals, amid occasional patches of cultivation;  there are square white-washed watch towers in groves of sacred trees;  there are a few tombstones, and an occasional rudely carved god to guard  the way. There are poor mud and bamboo inns with grass roofs, and dirty  tables set out with half a dozen bowls of tea, and with ovens for the  use of travellers. Food we had now to bring with us, and only at the  larger towns where the stages terminate could we expect to find food for  sale. The tea is inferior, and we had to be content with maize meal,  bean curds, rice roasted in sugar, and sweet gelatinous cakes made from  the waste of maize meal. Rice can only be bought in the large towns. It  is not kept in roadside inns ready steaming hot for use, as it is in  Szechuen. Rarely there are sweet potatoes; there are eggs, however, in  abundance, one hundred for a shilling (500 cash), but the coolies cannot  eat them because of their dearness. A large bowl of rice costs four  cash, an egg five cash, and the Chinaman strikes a balance in his mind  and sees more nourishment in one bowl of rice than in three eggs. Of  meat there is pork--pork in plenty, and pork only. Pigs and dogs are the  scavengers of China. None of the carnivora are more omnivorous than the  Chinese. \"A Chinaman has the most unscrupulous stomach in the world,\"  says Meadows; \"he will eat anything from the root to the leaf, and from  the hide to the entrails.\" He will not even despise the flesh of dog  that has died a natural death. During the awful famine in Shansi of  1876-1879 starving men fought to the death for the bodies of dogs that  had fattened on the corpses of their dead countrymen. Mutton is  sometimes for sale in Mohammedan shops, and beef also, but it must not  be imagined that either sheep or ox is killed for its flesh, unless on  the point of death from starvation or disease. And the beef is not from  the ox but from the water buffalo. Sugar can be bought only in the  larger towns; salt can be purchased everywhere.    Beggars there are in numbers, skulking about almost naked, with unkempt  hair and no queue, with a small basket for gathering garbage and a staff  to keep away dogs. Only beggars carry sticks in China, and it is only  the beggars that need beware of dogs. To carry a stick in China for  protection against dogs is like carrying a red flag to scare away bulls.  Dogs in China are lowly organised; they are not discriminating animals;  and, despite the luxurious splendour of my Chinese dress--it cost more  than seven shillings--dogs frequently mistook my calling. In Szechuen,  as we passed through the towns, there was competition among the inns to  obtain our custom. Hotel runners were there to shout to all the world  the superior merits of their establishments. But here in Yunnan it is  different. There is barely inn accommodation for the road traffic, and  the innkeepers are either too apathetic or too shamefaced to call the  attention of the traveller to their poor, dirty accommodation houses.    In Szechuen, one of the most flourishing of trades is that of the  monumental mason and carver in stone. Huge monoliths are there cut from  the boulders which have been dislodged from the mountains, dressed and  finished _in situ_, and then removed to the spot where they are to be  erected. The Chinese thus pursue a practice different from that of the  Westerns, who bring the undressed stone from the quarry and carve it in  the studio. With the Chinese the difficulty is one of transport--the  finished work is obviously lighter than the unhewn block. In Yunnan, up  to the present, I had seen no mason at work, for no masonry was needed.  Houses built of stone were falling into ruin, and only thatched,  mud-plastered, bamboo and wood houses were being built in their places.    At Laowatan I told my Christian to hire me a chair for thirty or forty  li, and he did so, but the chair, instead of carrying me the shorter  distance, carried me the whole day. The following day the chair kept  company with me, and as I had not ordered it, I naturally walked; but  the third day also the chair haunted me, and then I discovered that my  admirable guide had engaged the chair not for thirty or forty li, as I  had instructed him in my best Chinese, but for three hundred and sixty  li, for four days' stages of ninety li each. He had made the agreement  \"out of consideration for me,\" and his own pocket; he had made an  agreement which gave him wider scope for a little private arrangement of  his own with the chair-coolies. For two days I was paying fifteen cash a  li for a chair and walking alongside of it charmed by the good humour of  the coolies, and unaware that they were laughing in their sleeves at my  folly. Trifling mistakes like this are inevitable to one who travels in  China without an interpreter.    My two coolies were capital fellows, full of good humour, cheerful, and  untiring. The elder was disposed to be argumentative with his  countrymen, but he could not quarrel. Nature had given him an  uncontrollable stutter, and, if he tried to speak quickly, spasm seized  his tongue, and he had to break into a laugh. Few men in China, I think,  could be more curiously constructed than this coolie. He was all neck;  his chin was simply an upward prolongation of his neck like a second  \"Adam's apple.\" Both were very pleasant companions. They were naturally  in good humour, for they were well paid, and their loads, as loads are  in China, were almost insignificant; I had only asked them to carry  sixty-seven pounds each.    We, who live amid the advantages of Western civilisation, can hardly  realise how enormous are the weights borne by those human beasts of  burthen, our brothers in China. The common fast-travelling coolie of  Szechuen contracts to carry eighty catties (107lbs.), forty miles a day  over difficult country. But the weight-carrying coolie, travelling  shorter distances, carries far heavier loads than that. There are  porters, says Du Halde, who will carry 160 of our pounds, ten leagues a  day. The coolies, engaged in carrying the compressed cakes of Szechuen  tea into Thibet, travel over mountain passes 7000 feet above their  starting place; yet there are those among them, says Von Richthofen, who  carry 324 catties (432lbs.). A package of tea is called a \"_pao_\" and  varies in weight from eleven to eighteen catties, yet Baber has often  seen coolies carrying eighteen of the eighteen-catty _pao_ (the \"_Yachou  pao_\") and on one occasion twenty-two, in other words Baber has often  seen coolies with more than 400lbs. on their backs. Under these enormous  loads they travel from six to seven miles a day. The average load of the  Thibetan tea-carrier is, says Gill, from 240lbs. to 264lbs. Gill  constantly saw \"little boys carrying 120lbs.\" Bundles of calico weigh  fifty-five catties each (73-1/3lbs.), and three bundles are the average  load. Salt is solid, hard, metallic, and of high specific gravity, yet I  have seen men ambling along the road, under loads that a strong  Englishman could with difficulty raise from the ground. The average load  of salt, coal, copper, zinc, and tin is 200lbs. Gill met coolies  carrying logs, 200lbs. in weight, ten miles a day; and 200lbs., the  Consul in Chungking told me, is the average weight carried by the  cloth-porters between Wanhsien and Chentu, the capital.    Mountain coolies, such as the tea-carriers, bear the weight of their  burden on their shoulders, carrying it as we do a knapsack, not in the  ordinary Chinese way, with a pliant carrying pole. They are all provided  with a short staff, which has a transverse handle curved like a  boomerang, and with this they ease the weight off the back, while  standing at rest.    We were still ascending the valley, which became more difficult of  passage every day. Hamlets are built where there is scarce foothold in  the detritus, below perpendicular escarpments of rock, cut clean like  the facades of a Gothic temple. A tributary of the river is crossed by  an admirable stone bridge of two arches, with a central pier and  cut-water of magnificent boldness and strength, and with two images of  lions guarding its abutment. Just below the branch the main stream can  be crossed by a traveller, if he be brave enough to venture, in a bamboo  loop-cradle, and be drawn across the stream on a powerful bamboo cable  slung from bank to bank.    We rested by the bridge and refreshed ourselves, for above us was an  ascent whose steepness my stuttering coolie indicated to me by fixing my  walking stick in the ground, almost perpendicularly, and running his  finger up the side. He did not exaggerate. A zigzag path set with stone  steps has been cut in the vertical ascent, and up this we toiled for  hours. At the base of the escalade my men sublet their loads to spare  coolies who were waiting there in numbers for the purpose, and climbed  up with me empty-handed. At every few turns there were rest-houses where  one could get tea and shelter from the hot sun.

The shipment of ore to other States goes on constantly, the last  year's account showing that 246,555 tuns were dispersed over Indiana,  Ohio, and others. The furnaces at Kingsland, South St. Louis, Lewis  Iron Co.'s Works, Carondelet, and Maramec are all well situated as  to coal and limestone, the Maramec Works having a most valuable  water-power. These latter works also ship about 40,000 tuns red  hematite ore yearly.           *       *       *       *       *          SCIENTIFIC INTELLIGENCE.

AMERICAN INSTITUTE OF MINING ENGINEERS.    A circular has been issued by several mining engineers, proposing  a meeting at Wilkes-Barre, some time in April or May next, of all  persons interested in the general subjects of mining and metallurgy,  for the purpose of establishing an association, to be called \"The  American Institute of Mining Engineers.\" The Institute will hold  meetings periodically \"in the great mining and metallurgical centers,  when works of interest, such as mines, machine shops, furnaces, and  other metallurgical works, can be inspected, and the members exchange  their views, and consult, for mutual advantage, upon the difficulties  encountered by each.\" There will be the usual publication of  \"Transactions\" and \"Proceedings.\"    The idea of forming an association of persons thus mutually interested  in each other's occupations, is an excellent one; but it has been  suggested by a number of scientific gentlemen that the American  Association for the Advancement of Science offers every facility for  the accomplishment of the objects set forth in the circular, while it  affords the very great advantage of an assemblage of men learned in  all departments of knowledge, whose acquaintance mining engineers  would do well to make, and from whom they could learn much, while at  the same time imparting of their own knowledge.    As a section of the American Association, the mining engineers would  have more influence before the country, and it would perhaps be  well for them to stop and consider before establishing a separate  institute.      CONSUMPTION OF SUGAR, COFFEE, AND TEA.    E. Behm gives in his geographical year book, for 1870, the following  estimate of the consumption of sugar, coffee, and tea, _per capita_,  in various countries:    COUNTRIES.       Sugar, lbs.

It is estimated that three fourths of the sugar is  made from cane, and one fourth from the beet.    The consumption of coffee has doubled in most countries during the  last twenty years.           *       *       *       *       *          UNPLEASANT DISCOVERY IN THE PATENT OFFICE--LEVYING BLACK MAIL.      \"The Patent Office has been, during the past week, in a high state of  excitement, occasioned by the discovery of the operations of E. W. W.  Griffin, clerk in charge of the draftsmen's division, who, it appears,  has been levying black mail on the lady employes of the office, for  nearly two years. During the administration of Colonel Fisher, late  Commissioner of Patents, a large number of ladies were employed, for  the purpose of recopying drawings, when ordered by the inventors, of  patents already on file.    \"These ladies were placed under charge of Griffin, with power to  retain them in office so long as their services were satisfactory. It  has been proved that Griffin hired the ladies at regular salaries of  $1,000 per annum, the most of whom he blackmailed to the amount of  $400 per year each. It is estimated that he has made $1,000 per month  for the past two years.    \"The matter was brought to the notice of Commissioner Duncan, and an  investigation ordered, which resulted in the dismissal of Griffin.    \"It is thought that there are other cases of this kind, and the  Commissioner expresses his determination to ferret them all out,  and make a clean sweep of all parties in his department engaged in  swindling operations, against the government or against individuals.    \"The Patent Office has for a long time been considered a rich field  for operations of this kind, and investigations have often been  suggested, but passed unheeded by the proper authorities.    \"It is openly stated that an investigation into the relations existing  between certain examiners of patents and certain patent agents, would  disclose a more fearful state of blackmailing than exists in all the  other government departments combined.\"    [We find the above sensational paragraph among the recent Washington  items of the _Evening Mail_. We are in a position to say that \"the  high state of excitement\" alluded to has existed only in the brain of  the newspaper correspondent. The facts, in brief, are these: In July,  1869, a lady, and wife of one of the clerks in the draftsmen's room,  made application to Commissioner Fisher for a position in the copying  division of the same department; and, upon the urgent solicitation and  recommendation of Mr. E. W. W. Griffin, chief of the division, she  was appointed, and has held the position from that time until now,  receiving as salary $1,000 per annum, which, with the full knowledge  of her husband, she has divided with Griffin, in consideration of his  services in procuring for her the appointment. About a month ago, one  of the lady's friends got hold of the matter, and reported it to the  Court, which resulted in an investigation and the subsequent dismissal  of Griffin. This is the only case of the kind that we have heard of,  and we have no reason to believe that there is any other, or that  corruption exists in the Examining Corps, as alleged.--EDS.           *       *       *       *       *      A method of testing the purity of samples of water, by watching  the rapidity of its action on soap and similar compounds, has been  introduced by the French _savants_, MM. Boutron and Boudet. The  experiment tests, at the same time, the purity of the soap. Dissolved  in water in which lime is held in solution, the soap is precipitated  in hard white flakes. If the quantity of soap put in the lime water  be noted, it will be found that the smaller the quantity producing  precipitation, the purer the soap.
