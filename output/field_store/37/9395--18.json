We, therefore,  made a common cause, buying a number of paintings and one piece of  sculpture, thus doing our bit to help the good work along, besides  securing for our country some splendid examples of the art of  France. The exhibit was obtained through the courtesy of Monsieur  Jean Guiffrey, Minister of Fine Arts in France, and to whom we are  profoundly grateful. In this connection I may add that the United  States is largely indebted to France for influence upon American  art. Nearly all of our great painters and sculptors received their  initial education in France and the influence upon American art and  artists by French masters is incalculable. This is one of the debts  of the United States to France which can never be fully repaid.    The commission is in France, first, bearing America's good will,  and second, to investigate and render such substantial aid to  France as may be in our power, having in mind always the great  friendship existing between the two republics, and which we hope  our mission will strengthen. We venture to hope that our journey  through France in war time will also result in the increased  exchange of commodities between the two countries, a consummation  devoutly to be wished.    I thank you, gentlemen, from the bottom of my heart and bid you God  speed in the great work of saving France.    At this noted banquet there were several generals present, some of whom  had been in the service but a short time previous, and one of them  famous the world over. We were not permitted to mention the names of any  of the generals we met while in the war zone.          XII.    WITHIN SOUND OF THE GUNS      On Wednesday, October 4th, we left for the front in military  automobiles. We passed through a farming district and through several  small villages. Nearly all who were at work in the fields were women. It  all seemed quite peaceful, considering that the battle fields were so  near. We stopped at Monte Billiard, in the Champagne district, where we  were addressed by the mayor and a response was made by Mr. Pfeiffer.  Cuvier, the great French scientist, was born here in the year 1769, and  died in 1832. We were now, as I should have mentioned before, in that  part of Alsace-Lorraine again in possession of the French. We visited at  Monte Billiard, a Fifteenth century castle and a new hospital. Red Cross  girls were very much in evidence, a number of them American and English.  We were quartered at the Hotel de la Balanie, built in 1790. We visited  the factory of Japy Freres. This concern makes a specialty of steel  helmets, canteens and porcelain ware for the use of the army.    We arrived at Beaucort at midnight, and after settling down to rest,  were awakened by the booming of cannon, which was continuous during the  night. We were aroused the following morning by the town crier, passing  along the street, wearing a peculiar uniform, beating a drum and calling  out the news.    At Beaucort we were shown through a castle now occupied as a hospital.  It was originally a chateau, and at that time a citadel with moat and  draw-bridge.    In company with Mr. Warren, I visited the village blacksmith, being  reminded of my boyhood days. He had old-fashioned bellows and, with an  assistant, was in a small way finishing up some work for the army.    We arrived at Belfort at about noon, and first saw the \"Belfort Lion\" by  Bartholdi, the sculptor of the Statue of Liberty in New York Harbor. It  is seventy-three feet long, forty-three feet high and is carved in a  cliff below the citadel. This statue celebrates the stubborn resistance  of the town of Belfort, which has never surrendered, although besieged  on numerous occasions. Belfort has been exposed to German guns, less  than ten miles away, for two years, and it is much shattered from  bombardments. Many of the citizens are still engaged in their ordinary  pursuits, but live in the cellars of their domiciles.    We were quartered at the Le Grande Hotel, and could hear the cannons  roaring as we sat at luncheon. We were warned not to go out of the hotel  without a companion. There was a cave underneath with both an inside and  an outside entrance and we were told that in case the shelling was  resumed we should get into this cave. There had been, however, no  shelling for eight days. The town was shelled immediately after the  departure of the Canadian Industrial Commission, which had recently  visited Belfort.    [Illustration: The Lion of Belfort.]    The shutters of the hotel were closed at six P. M. I was taken to my  room by the chambermaid and handed a candle and a box of matches. With  all the lights of the hotel out, the cannon could be heard booming  during the entire night. Belfort is under martial law, or, as it is  called in France, military control. Just before retiring for the night  we were reminded that the city was frequently shelled and that nearly  all the inhabitants slept in the caves, a pleasant thought to go to bed  with. However, strange to say, I had a most excellent night's rest.    No one was permitted outside the hotel unless he had with him a card to  show the police of the town.    Belfort contains numerous monuments. One series of statues is of three  generals who defended Belfort during the three sieges successfully  resisted. Two of these sieges occurred during the time of Napoleon and  one during the Franco-Prussian war, 1870-1871. We walked about in a  body, escorted by a military officer and a number of soldiers. We  visited a large part of the city and at nearly every corner there were  signs showing the entrances to caves and stating the number of persons  each cave would hold--all the way from twenty to seventy. Evidence was  all around of bombs dropped from aeroplanes by the Germans and shells  fired by them from many miles away, there being hundreds of shattered  windows and holes in the sidewalks.    We remained in Belfort two nights. The morning after our departure the  city was bombarded and some fifteen or twenty people killed.    On Friday, October 6th, we left Belfort in the military autos, under  sealed orders, and knew not where we were going. We passed several  squads of German prisoners, among them one very large company. We were  frequently challenged by sentinels in passing, for miles, along the  front of Alsace-Lorraine.    Alsace-Lorraine has had forty-five years of German rule. The elder  people are not Germanized, and it is quite evident that France will not  be satisfied until the whole province has been restored.    We stopped for luncheon at Remiremont, in the Vosges mountains, and  while here visited an old church dating back to the Eleventh century.  This church contained, among other things, a statue of the Virgin Mary  carved in cedar, the gift to the church of Charlemagne. There is also at  this place a Thirteenth century arcade, through which we passed. We  bought a few relics and then left Remiremont at 4:30 P. M. for a dash  into Alsace and close up to the battle-front.    We arrived at Bussane at 5 P. M., after being held up several times. We  next reached Thann, a village once in German hands and two miles from  the German lines. This town had been bombarded by the Germans early in  the war. The destruction was fearful to look at; buildings were damaged  beyond repair, and one church nearly ruined. As we passed along in a  dense fog, one of the guides ran past each machine saving; \"Shentlemen,  this is a beautiful sight, but you can't see it.\"    At Thann we were shown the spot where the son of Prime Minister Borthon,  of France, was killed by a bomb.    After an inspection of Thann, we drove to Gerardmere to spend the night.  It was bright moonlight and we were told there was a great deal of  danger from German aeroplanes. This was a long night ride, but  considered much safer than going through this part of the country in  day-light.    We experienced great difficulty in getting back to the French line from  Alsace-Lorraine. In doing so we passed through a tunnel entering  Alsace-Lorraine territory, within a half-mile of the German firing line.  We saw a hill which has been taken and retaken a number of times and was  then in possession of the Germans. We were exposed to the German guns  for half an hour and could hear the roaring constantly. At this point  the soldier chauffeurs put on steel helmets and placed revolvers near  their right hands, taking from boxes in the machine a number of hand  grenades. This was all very cheerful for the occupants of the car to  witness, inasmuch as we did not have any helmets or hand grenades or  anything else which would enable us to help ourselves in case of  conflict.    We reached Gerardmere in time for dinner and stopped over night at the  Hotel de la Providence. This was a most interesting French village. We  were called the advance guard of tourists and were really the first to  have visited the place. Signs of war could be seen everywhere. We saw  here pontoon wagons. We also saw immense loads of bread being hauled  around in army wagons and looking like loads of Bessemer paving block.  During the night of our stay in Gerardmere, we were awakened by the  booming of cannons.    We left Gerardmere, going north and, passing a hill named \"Bonhomme\",  over which French and Germans have fought back and forward. It is now in  possession of both forces, armies being entrenched on either side of the  hill and within one mile of the summit.    We passed through a number of small villages completely riddled; one  village had but a single house left untouched.    Our next stop was at St. Die. This is the village where the word  \"Amerique\" was first used in France. A tablet recalls this  circumstance, the wording on it being as follows:      Here the 15th April 1507 has    been printed the \"Cosmographic    Introduction\" where, for the first    time the New Continent has    been named \"America.\"    Leaving St. Die we began a trip of "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/20467"],[0,"Handbook of the Trees of New England (#16)"],[1,"scence.=--April to May. Sterile catkins 3-4 inches long,  purplish-yellow; scales fringed: fertile catkins sessile or nearly so,  about 1 inch long, cylindrical; bracts 3-lobed, nearly to the middle,  pubescent, lobes slightly spreading.    =Fruit.=--Fruiting catkins oblong or oblong-ovoid, about 1 inch long and  two-thirds as thick, erect: nut oval to narrowly obovate, tapering at  each end, pubescent on the upper part, about the width of its wing.    =Horticultural Value.=--Hardy throughout New England; grows in wet or  dry situations, but prefers wet, peaty soil, where its roots can find a  constant supply of moisture; similar to the black birch, equally  valuable in landscape-gardening, but less desirable as a street tree;  transplanted without serious difficulty.    Differences between black birch and yellow birch:    =Black Birch.=--Bark reddish-brown, not separable into thin layers;  leaves bright green above, finely serrate; fruiting catkins cylindrical;  bark of twigs decidedly aromatic.    =Yellow Birch.=--Bark yellow, separable into thin layers; leaves dull  green above; serration coarser and more decidedly doubly serrate;  fruiting catkins ovoid or oblong-ovoid; flavor of bark less distinctly  aromatic.

Doubtfully and indefinitely reported from Canada.    No stations in Maine, Vermont, Rhode Island, or Connecticut; New  Hampshire,--found sparingly along streams in the southern part of the  state; abundant along the banks of Beaver brook, Pelham (F. W.  Batchelder); Massachusetts,--along the Merrimac river and its  tributaries, bordering swamps in Methuen and ponds in North Andover.         South, east of the Alleghany mountains, to Florida; west, locally       through the northern tier of states to Minnesota and along the Gulf       states to Texas; western limits, Nebraska, Kansas, Indian       territory, and Missouri.    =Habit.=--A medium-sized tree, 30-50 feet high, with a diameter at the  ground of 1-1-1/2 feet; reaching much greater dimensions southward. The  trunk, frequently beset with small, leafy, reflexed branchlets, and  often only less frayed and tattered than that of the yellow birch,  develops a light and feathery head of variable outline, with numerous  slender branches, the upper long and drooping, the reddish spray clothed  with abundant dark-green foliage.    =Bark.=--Reddish, more or less separable into layers, fraying into  shreddy, cinnamon-colored fringes; in old trees thick, dark  reddish-brown, and deeply furrowed; branches dark red or cinnamon,  giving rise to the name of \"red birch\"; season's shoots downy,  pale-dotted.    =Winter Buds and Leaves.=--Buds small, mostly appressed near the ends of  the shoots, tapering at both ends. Leaves simple, alternate, 3-4 inches  long, two-thirds as wide, dark green and smooth above, paler and  soft-downy beneath, turning bright yellow in autumn; outline  rhombic-ovate, with unequal and sharp double serratures; leafstalk short  and downy; stipules soon falling.    =Inflorescence.=--April to May. Sterile catkins usually in threes, 2-4  inches long, scales 2-3-flowered: fertile catkins bright green,  cylindrical, stalked; bracts 3-lobed, the central lobe much the longest,  tomentose, ciliate.    =Fruit.=--June. Earliest of the birches to ripen its seed; fruiting  catkins 1-2 inches long, cylindrical, erect or spreading; bracts with  the 3 lobes nearly equal in width, spreading, the central lobe the  longest: nut ovate to obovate, ciliate.    =Horticultural Value.=--Hardy throughout New England; grows in all  soils, but prefers a station near running water; young trees grow  vigorously and become attractive objects in landscape plantations;  especially useful along river banks to bind the soil; retains its lower  branches better than the black or yellow birches. Seldom found in  nurseries, and rather hard to transplant; collected plants do fairly  well.    [Illustration: PLATE XXXII.--Betula nigra.]      1. Leaf-buds.    2. Flower-buds.    3.

SMALL WHITE BIRCH.    =Habitat and Range.=--Dry, gravelly soils, occasional in swamps and  frequent along their borders, often springing up on burnt lands.         Nova Scotia to Lake Ontario.    Maine,--abundant; New Hampshire,--abundant eastward, as far north as  Conway, and along the Connecticut to Westmoreland; Vermont,--common in  the western and frequent in the southern sections; Massachusetts, Rhode  Island, and Connecticut,--common.         South, mostly in the coast region, to Delaware; west to Lake       Ontario.    =Habit.=--A small tree, 20-35 feet high, with a diameter at the ground  of 4-8 inches, occasionally much exceeding these dimensions; under  favorable conditions, of extreme elegance. The slender, seldom erect  trunk, continuous to the top of the tree, throws out numerous short,  unequal branches, which form by repeated subdivisions a profuse, slender  spray, disposed irregularly in tufts or masses, branches and branchlets  often hanging vertically or drooping at the ends. Conspicuous in winter  by the airy lightness of the narrow open head and by the contrast of the  white trunk with the dark spray; in summer, when the sun shines and the  air stirs, by the delicacy, tremulous movement, and brilliancy of the  foliage.    =Bark.=--Trunk grayish-white, with triangular, dusty patches below the  insertion of the branches; not easily separable into layers; branches  dark brown or blackish; season's shoots brown, with numerous small round  dots becoming horizontal lines and increasing in length with the age of  the tree. The white of the bark does not readily come off upon clothing.    =Winter Buds and Leaves.=--Buds somewhat diverging from the twig; narrow  conical or cylindrical, reddish-brown. Leaves simple, alternate, single  or in pairs, 3-4 inches long, two-thirds as wide, bright green above,  paler beneath, smooth and shining on both sides, turning to a pale  shining yellow in autumn, resinous, glandular-dotted when young; outline  triangular, coarsely and irregularly doubly serrate; apex taper-pointed;  base truncate, heart-shaped, or acute; leafstalks long and slender;  stipules dropping early.    =Inflorescence.=--May. Sterile catkins usually solitary or in pairs,  slender-cylindrical, 2-3 inches long: fertile catkins erect, green,  stalked; bracts minutely pubescent.    =Fruit.=--Fruiting catkins erect or spreading, cylindrical, about 1-1/4  inches long and 1/2 inch in diameter, stalked; scales 3-parted above the  center, side lobes larger, at right angles or reflexed: nuts small,  ovate to obovate, narrower than the wings, combined wings from broadly  obcordate to butterfly-shape, wider than long.    =Horticultural Value.=--Hardy throughout New England, growing in every  kind of soil, finest specimens in deep, rich loam. Were this tree not so  common, its graceful habit and attractive bark would be more appreciated  for landscape gardening; only occasionally grown by nurserymen, best  secured through collectors; young collected plants, if properly  selected, will nearly all live.

Canada, Atlantic to Pacific, northward to Labrador and Alaska, to       the limit of deciduous trees.    Maine,--abundant; New Hampshire,--in all sections, most common on  highlands up to the alpine area of the White mountains, above the range  of the yellow birch; Vermont,--common; Massachusetts,--common in the  western and central sections, rare towards the coast; Rhode Island,--not  reported; Connecticut,--occasional in the southern sections, frequent  northward.         South to Pennsylvania and Illinois; west to the Rocky mountains and       Washington on the Pacific coast.    Var. _minor_, Tuckerman, is a dwarf form found upon the higher mountain  summits of northern New England.    =Habit.=--A large tree, 50-75 feet high, with a diameter of 1-3 feet;  occasionally of greater dimensions. The trunk develops a  broad-spreading, open head, composed of a few large limbs ascending at  an acute angle, with nearly horizontal secondary branches and a  slender, flexible spray without any marked tendency to droop.  Characterized by the dark metallic lustre of the branchlets, the dark  green foliage, deep yellow in autumn, and the chalky whiteness of the  trunk and large branches; a singularly picturesque tree, whether  standing alone or grouped in forests.    =Bark.=--Easily detachable in broad sheets and separable into thin,  delicately colored, paper-like layers, impenetrable by water, outlasting  the wood it covers. Bark of trunk and large branches chalky-white when  fully exposed to the sun, lustreless, smooth or ragged-frayed, in very  old forest trees encrusted with huge lichens, and splitting into broad  plates; young trunks and smaller branches smooth, reddish or grayish  brown, with numerous roundish buff dots which enlarge from year to year  into more and more conspicuous horizontal lines. The white of the bark  readily rubs off upon clothing.    =Winter Buds and Leaves.=--Buds small, ovate, flattish, acute to  "]]]
