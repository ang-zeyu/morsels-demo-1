Well supplied with Oakdale colors, they set out for the  football grounds, where an immense crowd of people had gathered to see  the big game of the season.    \"I shall never forget the first football game I saw in Oakdale,\" said  Anne to David as they made their way to the grandstand. \"It ended very  sensationally for me.\"    \"I should say it did,\" replied David, smiling. \"Confidentially, Anne, do  you ever hear from your father?\"    \"Not very often,\" replied Anne. \"He is not liable to trouble me again,  however, because he knows that I will not go back to the stage, no  matter what he says. He was with the western company of 'True Hearts'  last year, but I don't know where he is now, and I don't care. Don't  think I'm unfeeling; but it is impossible for me to care for him, even  though he is my father.\"    \"I understand,\" said David sympathetically. \"Now let's forget him and  have a good time.\"    \"Hurrah! Here comes the band!\" shouted Hippy.    The \"Oakdale Military Band\" took their places in the improvised  bandstand and began a short concert before the game with the \"Stars and  Stripes,\" while the spectators unconsciously kept time with their feet  to the inspiring strains.    When the two teams appeared on the field there were shouts of enthusiasm  from the friends of the players, and the band burst forth with the High  School song, in which the students joined.    After the usual preliminaries, the game began, and for the next hour  everything else was forgotten save the battle that waged between the two  teams.    Miriam Nesbit, Eva Allen and Marian Barber, with their guests, joined  Grace's party, and soon the place they occupied became the very center  of enthusiasm. Reddy, who was playing left end on the home team,  received an ovation every time he made a move, and when towards the end  of the game he made a touchdown, his friends nearly split their loyal  throats in expressing their approval.    It was over at last, and Oakdale had won a complete victory over the  Georgetown foe, who took their defeat with becoming grace. As soon as  Reddy could free himself from the grasp of his school fellows, who would  have borne him from the field in triumph if he had not stoutly resisted,  he hurried to his friends, who showered him with congratulations.    \"O you Titian-haired star!\" cried Hippy, clasping his hands in mock  admiration. \"You are the rarest jewel in the casket. Words fail to  express my feelings.              \"'O joy, O bliss, O rapture! Let happiness now hap!              I am a sea of gurgling glee, with ecstacy on tap.'\"    Hippy recited this effusion in a killing falsetto voice, and endeavored  to embrace Reddy fervently, but was dragged back by Tom and David, to  Reddy's visible relief.    \"He's the idol of the hour. Don't put your irreverent hands on him,\" was  David's injunction.    \"But I adore idols,\" persisted Hippy. \"Let me at him.\"    \"Quit it, fat one!\" growled Reddy, with a grin. \"I'll settle with you  later.\"    With gay laughter and jest, the young folks made their way from the  grounds and started down the road toward home.    The whole party, walking four abreast, had just turned the curve where  the road ended and Main Street began, when there was a hoarse honk!  honk! and a runabout decorated in blue and white, containing Eleanor and  Edna Wright, bore down upon them at lightning speed. The girls, uttering  little cries of alarm, scattered to both sides of the road, with the  exception of Mabel Allison, who, in her hurry to get out of the way,  stumbled and fell directly in the path of the oncoming machine.          CHAPTER XIII    A THANKSGIVING FROLIC      But sudden as had been Mabel's fall, Grace Harlowe was equal to the  emergency. With a bound she reached the middle of the road, seized Mabel  and dragged her back just as the runabout passed over the place where  she had fallen. It almost grazed her outstretched hand, then shot on  down the road without slackening its speed for an instant.    There was a cry of horror from the young folks that ended in a sigh of  relief. David and Tom Gray quickly raised Mabel to her feet and turned  to Grace, whose face was ghastly, while she trembled like a leaf. The  reaction had set in the moment she realized that Mabel was safe. Jessica  and Nora had both begun to cry, while the faces of the others fully  expressed their feelings.    \"Grace,\" said Tom in a husky voice, \"that was the quickest move I ever  saw any one make.\"    Grace drew a long breath, the color returned to her pale face and in a  measure she recovered herself.    \"Some one had to do something,\" she said weakly. \"I was the nearest to  her, that's all. Are you hurt, Mabel, dear?\" she asked, turning to the  young girl, who stood by Jessica, looking white and dazed.    \"It came so suddenly,\" she faltered, \"I couldn't get up. It was awful!\"  She shuddered, then burst into tears, burying her face in Jessica's  shoulder.    \"There, there,\" soothed Jessica, wiping her own eyes. \"It's all right  now. Stand up straight and let me brush your coat. You are all mud.\"    \"Here come the would-be murderesses now,\" cried Hippy. \"They actually  managed to stop and turn around, and now they are coming this way. One  of them is my pet abomination--Miss Wright. She used to call me 'fatty'  when I was little, and I've never forgiven her. But who is the reckless  young person playing chauffeur? She ought to be put in jail for  exceeding the speed limit.\"    \"Hush!\" said Grace. \"Here she is.\"    The runabout had stopped and Eleanor alighted. Ignoring the four chums,  she walked up to Miriam Nesbit.    \"Will you please tell me if any one is hurt?\" she asked pettishly.  \"I saw some one fall, but couldn't stop the machine. I supposed the  highway was for vehicles, not pedestrians four abreast.\"    \"Miss Savell, you have just missed running over Miss Allison,\" said  Miriam coldly. \"Had it not been for Miss Harlowe, there would have been  a serious accident. I should advise you to drive more carefully in  future, or you may not escape so easily another time.\"    Eleanor flushed at these words and said haughtily, \"I did not ask for  advice, I asked for information.\"    \"Very true,\" replied Miriam calmly, \"but you see I have given you both.\"    \"You are the most ill-bred lot of girls I have ever seen,\" returned  Eleanor crossly, \"and I think you are making a great deal of unnecessary  fuss over a small matter. Why didn't your prize orphan get out of the  way with the rest of you? Besides, you have no right to block a public  highway, as you did. I am very sorry I came back at all.\"    Turning on her heel, she walked back to the runabout, climbed in and  drove down the road like the wind, apparently indifferent as to what  comment her heartless behavior might create.    \"Who on earth is that girl?\" inquired Reddy Brooks. \"She has about as  much sympathy as a stone.\"    \"That is Eleanor Savell,\" replied Anne Pierson, \"and she can be nice if  she wishes, but she doesn't like us very well. That's why she was so  hateful.\"    \"So that's the famous Eleanor?\" said Tom Gray in a low tone to  Grace. \"Aunt Rose was telling me about her this morning at breakfast.  I supposed she was a great friend of yours.\"    \"She was, but she isn't,\" returned Grace. \"That's rather indefinite.  However, I'll tell you about it as we go back.\"    \"She certainly can't complain as far as looks are concerned,\" said  Hippy. \"She must have yards of blue ribbon that she won at baby shows  when but a mere infant.\"    \"Attention, boys and girls,\" cried Grace. \"Let us forget what has  happened and have just as good a time to-night as we can. We mustn't  spoil the party.\"    \"I move that we give Grace Harlowe a special round of applause for being  a heroine,\" cried Hippy. \"Hurrah!\"    His example was quickly followed and the noise of the cheering brought  people to their doors to see what the excitement was about.    \"Do stop,\" protested Grace. \"People will begin asking all sorts of  questions.\"    \"Don't interfere with our simple pleasures,\" expostulated Hippy. \"Let us  howl in peace. High School yell next, please.\"    By the time the party had reached the center of the town where their  ways parted, the shadow cast by the near accident had almost  disappeared.    By eight o'clock that evening the last guest had arrived, and the  Harlowe's hospitable home was the scene of radiant good cheer. Mrs.  Gray, enthroned in a big chair in one corner of the drawing room, was in  her element, and the young folks vied with each other in doing her  homage. The sprightly old lady was never so happy as when surrounded by  young folks. She had a word or smile for each one, and the new girls who  had at first felt rather timid about meeting her, were soon entirely at  ease in her presence.    The greater part of the furniture had been removed from the big living  room and the floor had been crashed; while a string orchestra that made  a specialty of playing for parties had been hired for the pleasure of  those who cared to dance.    As dancing was the chief amusement at nearly all of the young people's  parties in Oakdale, the floor was filled from the beginning of the first  waltz until supper was announced. This was served at two long tables in  the dining room, Mrs. Gray occupying the seat of honor at the head of  one, and Miss Thompson, who was a favorite at High School parties, the  other. There were miniature ears of corn, turkeys, pumpkins and various  other favors appropriate to Thanksgiving at each one's place. In the  center of one table stood two dolls dressed in the style of costume worn  by the Pilgrim fathers and mothers. They held a scroll between them on  which was printed the Thanksgiving Proclamation. In the center of the  other table were two dolls, one dressed in football uniform, a miniature  football"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/17851"],[0,"The History of Mary Prince, a West Indian Slave (#16)"],[1,"us to the sea.  They did not beat us: they only killed one man, who was very ill and too  weak to carry his load: they made all of us carry chickens and meat for  our food; but this poor man could not carry his load, and they ran him  through the body with a sword.--He was a neighbour of ours. When we got to  the sea they sold all of us, but not to the same person. They sold us for  money; and I was sold six times over, sometimes for money, sometimes for  cloth, and sometimes for a gun. I was about thirteen years old. It was  about half a year from the time I was taken, before I saw the white  people.    We were taken in a boat from place to place, and sold at every place we  stopped at. In about six months we got to a ship, in which we first saw  white people: they were French. They bought us. We found here a great many  other slaves; there were about eighty, including women and children. The  Frenchmen sent away all but five of us into another very large ship. We  five staid on board till we got to England, which was about five or six  months. The slaves we saw on board the ship were chained together by the  legs below deck, so close they could not move. They were flogged very  cruelly: I saw one of them flogged till he died; we could not tell what  for. They gave them enough to eat. The place they were confined in below  deck was so hot and nasty I could not bear to be in it. A great many of  the slaves were ill, but they were not attended to. They used to flog me  very bad on board the ship: the captain cut my head very bad one time.    \"I am very happy to be in England, as far as I am very well;--but I have  no friend belonging to me, but God, who will take care of me as he has  done already. I am very glad I have come to England, to know who God is. I  should like much to see my friends again, but I do not now wish to go back  to them: for if I go back to my own country, I might be taken as a slave  again. I would rather stay here, where I am free, than go back to my  country to be sold. I shall stay in England as long as (please God) I  shall live. I wish the King of England could know all I have told you. I  wish it that he may see how cruelly we are used. We had no king in our  country, or he would have stopt it. I think the king of England might stop  it, and this is why I wish him to know it all. I have heard say he is  good; and if he is, he will stop it if he can. I am well off myself, for I  am well taken care of, and have good bed and good clothes; but I wish my  own people to be as comfortable.\"      \"LOUIS ASA-ASA.\"    \"_London, January 31, 1831_.\""]]]
