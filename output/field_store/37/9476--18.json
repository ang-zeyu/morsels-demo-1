In accord with this mistaken view they  have adopted the initiative and referendum, carried it overwhelmingly,  three to one, in every county in the State, and I need not tell an  audience of intelligence that this is the most insidious form of attack  now being made upon the fundamental principles of our government.\"    By this time Silvia and all the suffragists in the audience were  applauding wildly, while Carroll Renner laughed till the tears ran down  her cheeks, and once more Frank turned a patient and puzzled countenance  to the presiding officer.    \"I do not understand the applause, ladies,\" he said mildly, with a gleam  in his eyes that none but Carroll understood. \"The thing I am telling  you is frightful. The enfranchisement of women means the end of the  Republic as it now is; it means the rejection of all theories that are  found wanting, and the putting out on the vast uncharted sea of  experiment; it means interference with those great business enterprises  that have built up, I had nearly said that 'make and preserve us a  nation'! It means a reckless disregard for property rights in the  sentimental desire to protect the individual, as if a nation could  become great and strong by individual effort alone, and without the  guiding and sustaining hands of statecraft and financial genius gripping  the rudder of the ship of state. They will not listen to the voice of  experience; they cannot be intimidated; they cannot be deceived for an  indefinite number of years; if the established order seems to them  unfair, unjust or illiberal, they have little respect for tradition when  it's results they're after.\"    \"But if the anti-suffrage movement is growing as we have been told,  can't the anti-suffragists overcome those tendencies?\" asked an old lady  on the platform.    Frank restated the question for the benefit of the audience, and then  answered with indescribable pathos, \"I cannot conceal the truth from  you; improbable as it seems, when once this poison becomes virulent in  the body politic it spares none, and the very women who have battled  most nobly against this corroding innovation are apt to succumb to its  insidious influence; even the anti-suffragist, home-loving, God-fearing,  modest and retiring as is her nature, has developed a talent for  political intrigue that has led to the downfall of more than one of the  best laid plans of mice and men.\"    He tried to go on, but the audience was convulsed, not so much by what  he said as by his manner, and by the sudden turning of the tables after  the long tension had reached the snapping point. Still uncertain whether  to regard his as friend or foe, Mrs. Briglow-Jorliss, after rapping  vainly for order, was obliged to dismiss the meeting, and by some irony  of fate the orchestra played \"Hail Columbia,\" and the suffragettes took  up the words and sung them with much unction, especially the lines--        \"Let independence be our boast,      Ever mindful what it cost.\"          CHAPTER XIV    FAITH IS THE BASIS OF ALL PROGRESS      Early in June, Dr. Earl received a letter which puzzled him not a  little. It was complimentary in the extreme, and yet something back of  it made him say, \"'For it is not an open enemy that hath done this.'\"  The letter asked him to speak on \"Mental Therapeutics\" before a meeting  of one of the great medical societies of the city of New York; stated  that there would be no other speaker, but there would be an open  discussion after his address, and hoped he would find time to comply  with the request. Once he started to write his acceptance; twice he  actually wrote, declining, and then tore up both letters. It was true  that he was crowded for time, but he could make time, and in his heart  he knew perfectly well that he would have done so without a thought, but  for the unexpected complications which had occurred with Alice Bell.  Already he had heard one or two thinly veiled sneers at the result of  this much-lauded case. He had met Towers and Hershell, both of them  eminent in the profession, but the day before, and their greetings had  been singularly cool; once or twice at the club they both frequented  Morris had been little short of insulting, but his well-known  infatuation for Silvia Holland would account for that. A reporter from  one of the less reputable dailies had asked for an interview, and had  written an article which barely escaped being libelous. There were not  wanting those in the profession who openly denounced him as a \"fakir.\"    The longer he thought about it, the more unwilling he was to act upon  his own judgment alone, and so he turned to the one unfailing counsellor  of his life, his sister Hilda. With him, to will was to do, so within an  hour he was in his sister's drawing-room, and not five minutes later  Silvia Holland entered and was warmly greeted by Mrs. Ramsey. The day  was dismal and the rain was descending in a steady downpour that gave no  promise of ever ceasing; it was late afternoon, and Mrs. Ramsey said  cordially, \"Let us have tea in my sitting-room; nobody else will come  such a day as this, and it will be so much more cosy. I distrust from  his air of supernatural gravity that my brother has something on his  mind----\"    \"Then I will be _de trop_\" said Miss Holland. \"I will amuse myself in  the library until you are at liberty. I was awfully glad to get your  'phone message to come over, for it's a wretched day, and I was  wondering where I should go for tea as I came up town from my office.  Have your conference and never mind about me.\"    \"Indeed,\" said Jack eagerly, \"if you would be so kind as to give me your  opinion also on the matter I have called to consult my sister about, you  would confer a great favor,\" and even as he spoke he knew it was for her  quick comprehension he had been unconsciously wishing all the time.    She laughed and assented graciously, and they followed Mrs. Ramsey to  her own charming little room, as dainty and distinctive as its owner.  Upon the tea-tray there were cigarettes, and Dr. Earl rather wondered  whether Silvia would accept, but she shook her head. \"No,\" she said  lightly, \"I emulate men's virtues, not their vices; maybe my nerves may  need alternate sedatives and stimulants some day, but as yet I hardly  know that I have any.\"    Hilda lit one rather languidly. \"My doctor says it isn't so much nerves  as lack of nerve with me; I don't know what you call it, but I confess I  find the smoke-wreaths pleasant; you won't join me either, Jack? Well,  let us have the story in all its native simplicity and be sure you  nothing extenuate nor set down aught in malice.\"    \"I am told,\" he said, \"that no well-bred New Yorker makes literary  allusions, and that to quote Shakespeare is to relegate oneself to his  century; however, this is the problem,\" and then he read them the  letter.    Hilda was openly pleased. \"Why not?\" she said. \"It seems to me a very  courteous and appreciative note, and I should think you would enjoy  speaking before that kind of an audience, all of them picked men,  trained and scientific and able to take in shades of meaning and  distinctions that are wasted on the laity. Unless you are keeping  something back, I should say, accept by all means. But are you?\"    He paused. \"In just a moment, Hilda. How does it strike you, Miss  Holland?\"    She held out her hand for the note, and read and then reread it, and her  forehead contracted. \"I wonder,\" she said to herself, \"whether this is  what Orrin meant when he said the profession would furnish Dr. Earl  enough rope--I meant to ask him what he did mean, but I forgot it.\"  Aloud she said, \"Isn't Dr. Morris one of the directors of this society?  He's a fellow alumnus of yours; it doesn't seem as if he would be likely  to show you an affront, does it?\"    \"That's just the point,\" answered Dr. Earl. \"Is it a case of 'mine own  familiar friend'?\"    His sister looked at him quizzically. \"When it comes to literary  allusion, Jack,\" she said, \"New York might permit Shakespeare, but I  assure you it wouldn't stand for the psalmist. Do you really think it is  a plan to get you into some false position or to embarrass you with  criticisms or queries not made in good faith?\"    \"That is exactly what I want to know,\" he said.    \"And what if it is?\" asked Silvia.    He colored. \"You mean I ought to be willing to bear testimony to my  beliefs whether they meet with acceptance or not?\"    Hilda blew a ring of smoke ceilingwards. \"That's the trouble with these  suffragettes,\" she said reminiscently. \"They never question the  advisability of 'casting pearls before swine.'\"    Jack laughed and Silvia turned on her reproachfully. \"Hilda! That isn't  fair; haven't you just said yourself that this would be a picked  audience? Suppose a little clique of them have arranged the meeting with  the intention of heckling the speaker? The bulk of them will be there in  good faith, anxious to learn, willing to listen to your brother's  account of his experiences, and profit by them. If he can't gain a  respectful hearing there, where will he gain it?\"    \"Forgive me for being biblical to-night,\" Hilda answered. \"I can't seem  to get away from the suggestion; you know it was the high priests and  the rulers of the synagogue that stirred up their followers to cry,  'Crucify Him, crucify Him!' And times have changed more than people. The  poor will hear gladly enough of healing that is to be had without money  and without price, and operations that may be avoided by simply keeping  well, but my experience is that the fetish of the professional man is a  jealous god, given to heresy hunting, and bowing down and worshiping at  the shrine of 'regularity.' They want to preserve the _status quo_ at  any cost.\"    \"Yes,\" said Silvia bluntly, \"even after it has long been lost. They are  like people who might discover an"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/223"],[0,"The Wisdom of Father Brown (#16)"],[1,"athletes do not run across ploughed fields or scratch their eyes out  in bramble hedges. Nor do they run all doubled up like a crouching dog.  There were more decisive details to a fairly well-trained eye. The man  was clad in coarse and ragged clothes, but they were something more  than merely coarse and ragged. They were so ill-fitting as to be quite  grotesque; even as he appeared in black outline against the moonrise,  the coat-collar in which his head was buried made him look like a  hunchback, and the long loose sleeves looked as if he had no hands. It  at once occurred to me that he had somehow managed to change his convict  clothes for some confederate's clothes which did not fit him. Second,  there was a pretty stiff wind against which he was running; so that I  must have seen the streaky look of blowing hair, if the hair had not  been very short. Then I remembered that beyond these ploughed fields  he was crossing lay Pilgrim's Pond, for which (you will remember) the  convict was keeping his bullet; and I sent my walking-stick flying.\"    \"A brilliant piece of rapid deduction,\" said Father Brown; \"but had he  got a gun?\"    As Usher stopped abruptly in his walk the priest added apologetically:  \"I've been told a bullet is not half so useful without it.\"    \"He had no gun,\" said the other gravely; \"but that was doubtless due to  some very natural mischance or change of plans. Probably the same policy  that made him change the clothes made him drop the gun; he began to  repent the coat he had left behind him in the blood of his victim.\"    \"Well, that is possible enough,\" answered the priest.    \"And it's hardly worth speculating on,\" said Usher, turning to some  other papers, \"for we know it's the man by this time.\"    His clerical friend asked faintly: \"But how?\" And Greywood Usher threw  down the newspapers and took up the two press-cuttings again.    \"Well, since you are so obstinate,\" he said, \"let's begin at the  beginning. You will notice that these two cuttings have only one thing  in common, which is the mention of Pilgrim's Pond, the estate, as  you know, of the millionaire Ireton Todd. You also know that he is a  remarkable character; one of those that rose on stepping-stones--\"    \"Of our dead selves to higher things,\" assented his companion. \"Yes; I  know that. Petroleum, I think.\"    \"Anyhow,\" said Usher, \"Last-Trick Todd counts for a great deal in this  rum affair.\"    He stretched himself once more before the fire and continued talking in  his expansive, radiantly explanatory style.    \"To begin with, on the face of it, there is no mystery here at all. It  is not mysterious, it is not even odd, that a jailbird should take his  gun to Pilgrim's Pond. Our people aren't like the English, who will  forgive a man for being rich if he throws away money on hospitals or  horses. Last-Trick Todd has made himself big by his own considerable  abilities; and there's no doubt that many of those on whom he has shown  his abilities would like to show theirs on him with a shot-gun. Todd  might easily get dropped by some man he'd never even heard of; some  labourer he'd locked out, or some clerk in a business he'd busted.  Last-Trick is a man of mental endowments and a high public character;  but in this country the relations of employers and employed are  considerably strained.    \"That's how the whole thing looks supposing this Rian made for Pilgrim's  Pond to kill Todd. So it looked to me, till another little discovery  woke up what I have of the detective in me. When I had my prisoner safe,  I picked up my cane again and strolled down the two or three turns of  country road that brought me to one of the side entrances of Todd's  grounds, the one nearest to the pool or lake after which the place  is named. It was some two hours ago, about seven by this time; the  moonlight was more luminous, and I could see the long white streaks  of it lying on the mysterious mere with its grey, greasy, half-liquid  shores in which they say our fathers used to make witches walk until  they sank. I'd forgotten the exact tale; but you know the place I mean;  it lies north of Todd's house towards the wilderness, and has two queer  wrinkled trees, so dismal that they look more like huge fungoids than  decent foliage. As I stood peering at this misty pool, I fancied I saw  the faint figure of a man moving from the house towards it, but it was  all too dim and distant for one to be certain of the fact, and still  less of the details. Besides, my attention was very sharply arrested by  something much closer. I crouched behind the fence which ran not more  than two hundred yards from one wing of the great mansion, and which was  fortunately split in places, as if specially for the application of a  cautious eye. A door had opened in the dark bulk of the left wing, and a  figure appeared black against the illuminated interior--a muffled figure  bending forward, evidently peering out into the night. It closed the  door behind it, and I saw it was carrying a lantern, which threw a patch  of imperfect light on the dress and figure of the wearer. It seemed to  be the figure of a woman, wrapped up in a ragged cloak and evidently  disguised to avoid notice; there was something very strange both about  the rags and the furtiveness in a person coming out of those rooms lined  with gold. She took cautiously the curved garden path which brought her  within half a hundred yards of me--, then she stood up for an instant on  the terrace of turf that looks towards the slimy lake, and holding her  flaming lantern above her head she deliberately swung it three times to  and fro as for a signal. As she swung it the second time a flicker of  its light fell for a moment on her own face, a face that I knew. She  was unnaturally pale, and her head was bundled in her borrowed plebeian  shawl; but I am certain it was Etta Todd, the millionaire's daughter.    \"She retraced her steps in equal secrecy and the door closed behind her  again. I was about to climb the fence and follow, when I realized that  the detective fever that had lured me into the adventure was rather  undignified; and that in a more authoritative capacity I already held  all the cards in my hand. I was just turning away when a new noise broke  on the night. A window was thrown up in one of the upper floors, but  just round the corner of the house so that I could not see it; and a  voice of terrible distinctness was heard shouting across the dark garden  to know where Lord Falconroy was, for he was missing from every room in  the house. There was no mistaking that voice. I have heard it on many a  political platform or meeting of directors; it was Ireton Todd himself.  Some of the others seemed to have gone to the lower windows or on to the  steps, and were calling up to him that Falconroy had gone for a stroll  down to the Pilgrim's Pond an hour before, and could not be traced  since. Then Todd cried 'Mighty Murder!' and shut down the window  violently; and I could hear him plunging down the stairs inside.  Repossessing myself of my former and wiser purpose, I whipped out of the  way of the general search that must follow; and returned here not later  than eight o'clock.    \"I now ask you to recall that little Society paragraph which seemed to  you so painfully lacking in interest. If the convict was not keeping  the shot for Todd, as he evidently wasn't, it is most likely that he was  keeping it for Lord Falconroy; and it looks as if he had delivered the  goods. No more handy place to shoot a man than in the curious geological  surroundings of that pool, where a body thrown down would sink through  thick slime to a depth practically unknown. Let us suppose, then, that  our friend with the cropped hair came to kill Falconroy and not Todd.  But, as I have pointed out, there are many reasons why people in America  might want to kill Todd. There is no reason why anybody in America  should want to kill an English lord newly landed, except for the  one reason mentioned in the pink paper--that the lord is paying his  attentions to the millionaire's daughter. Our crop-haired friend,  despite his ill-fitting clothes, must be an aspiring lover.    \"I know the notion will seem to you jarring and even comic; but that's  because you are English. It sounds to you like saying the Archbishop of  Canterbury's daughter will be married in St George's, Hanover Square,  to a crossing-sweeper on ticket-of-leave. You don't do justice to the  climbing and aspiring power of our more remarkable citizens. You see a  good-looking grey-haired man in evening-dress with a sort of authority  about him, you know he is a pillar of the State, and you fancy he had  a father. You are in error. You do not realize that a comparatively few  years ago he may have been in a tenement or (quite likely) in a jail.  You don't allow for our national buoyancy and uplift. Many of our  most influential citizens have not only risen recently, but risen  comparatively late in life. Todd's daughter was fully eighteen when her  father first made his pile; so there isn't really anything impossible in  her having a hanger-on in low life; or even in her hanging on to him, as  I think she must be doing, to judge by the lantern business. If so, the  hand that held the lantern may not be unconnected with the hand that  held the gun. This case, sir, will make a noise.\"    \"Well,\" said the priest patiently, \"and what did you do next?\"    \"I reckon you'll be shocked,\" replied Greywood Usher, \"as I know you  don't cotton to the march of science in these matters. I am given a good  deal of discretion here, and perhaps take a little more than I'm given;  and I thought it was an excellent opportunity to test that Psychometric  Machine I told you about. Now, in my opinion, that machine can't lie.\"    \"No machine can lie,\" said Father Brown; \"nor can it tell the truth.\"    \"It did in this case, as I'll show you,\" went on Usher positively.  "]]]
