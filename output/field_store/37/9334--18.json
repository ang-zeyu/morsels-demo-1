[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/19271"],[0,"Dawn of a New Day (#16)"],[1,"under the auspices of your Assembly on the  occasion of the departure of our indefatigable and highly esteemed Baha'i  sister Miss Martha Root from India. No more eloquent tribute could have  been paid indeed to the historic work accomplished by that well-beloved  star-servant of the Cause during her stay of one full year in that country  than that beautiful and impressive gathering which had met to bid her a  last farewell upon her leaving your shores. The warmth and spontaneity of  your love must have profoundly impressed and moved her heart, and given  her an added proof of the unbounded gratitude which you all surely cherish  for her, after these many months of ceaseless teaching activity she has  spent in your midst.    The Guardian wishes to express his own gratitude to the members of the  N.S.A., and through them to the community of believers throughout India  and Burma for the hospitality and loving assistance you have all,  individually as well as collectively, continually extended to Miss Root  all through her stay in your country. The essential now, he feels, is for  each one of the friends, and particularly the local Assemblies, to arise  and with unflinching resolve to endeavour to follow up the splendid work  she has so ably, yet so unostentatiously, accomplished. They would be  certainly failing in their debt of gratitude to her, if they allow the  seeds she has faithfully and painstakingly scattered, during these months  of arduous and uninterrupted effort, to get lost. Rather, they should  spare no effort to water these seeds and enable them to germinate and  yield in due time most abundant and lasting results.          Baha'i Youth Groups      With regard to the formation of Baha'i Youth groups; the Guardian is most  pleased to hear of the satisfactory progress that has been accomplished  along this line, and of the extensive programme you have arranged for the  development of Baha'i Youth activity during the coming year. He wishes me  to express, in particular, his appreciation of the very warm response made  by six of these youth groups to the suggestion of the National Youth  Committee of America regarding the holding of special youth meetings on  the 26th of this month. He wishes you to assure them of his special  prayers for the success and confirmation of their efforts. Six-Year  Plan--Spontaneous Undertaking of Indian Baha'i Community    In connection with the Six-Year Plan initiated by your N.S.A.; the  Guardian cannot too highly praise this undertaking of unprecedented  magnitude which your Assembly has resolved to carry out. One year has  already elapsed since that Plan was first launched, and the task that will  have to be accomplished during the remaining five years is indeed immense,  and calls for no less than a combined and tremendous sacrificial effort by  every Assembly, group and individual believer throughout India and Burma.    But the friends should derive much encouragement at the realization that  their efforts for the prosecution of this Plan are, in a way, far more  meritorious than those which their fellow-believers in the American  Continent are exerting in connection with the Seven-Year Plan of the  American N.S.A.    Whereas this latter Plan, which, it should be fairly admitted, is the  largest enterprise of its kind ever undertaken by any national Baha'i  Community, has been conceived and formulated directly by the Guardian  himself, the Six-Year Plan adopted by the Indian N.S.A. has been initiated  solely through the efforts of the elected body of the national  representatives of the Indian and Burmese believers, and represents  therefore the spontaneous undertaking of the Indian Baha'i Community  itself, and as such is endowed with a special merit and a unique spiritual  potency. When successfully completed this Plan will constitute indeed an  abiding monument to the resourceful energy, the unstinted devotion, and  the unquenchable enthusiasm of the Indian Baha'is, from which future  generations of believers in that land will derive endless inspiration and  guidance.    In view of the paramount importance of this Six-Year Plan, and the urgency  which the friends must undoubtedly feel to carry it out as speedily and  efficiently as possible during the remaining five years, the Guardian  would advise that in the next Annual Convention meeting in Calcutta a  special session be devoted to the findings and consideration by all the  delegates and friends present of such policies and means as, in their  considered opinion, can best insure the speedy and timely completion of  this glorious undertaking.    The Guardian would particularly suggest that special stress be laid on the  necessity for pioneer teaching in those states and provinces in India and  Burma, where the Cause has not yet been introduced. Those believers who  have the means, and also the capacity to teach, should be encouraged, no  matter how great the sacrifice involved, to settle in these virgin  territories, until such time as a local assembly has been constituted, or  at least a group of firm believers formed that can safely and gradually  evolve into a firmly-organized and properly-functioning local assembly.  This policy of teaching by settlement which the Guardian has also advised  and indeed urged the American believers to adopt has been proved by  experience to be the most effective way of establishing the Faith in new  territories, and he therefore confidently recommends it for adoption by  your Assembly.          Summer School      As regards the Indian Summer School; its importance, the Guardian feels,  cannot be overstressed, specially in view of its recognized teaching  value, both as a centre for the training of Baha'i teachers, and also for  the attraction of outsiders to the Cause. The wide popularity which this  newly-established yet highly-promising institution is already enjoying,  truly attests its high value as one of those vital institutions of the  Faith in this formative age of its development.          David      ...The David referred to by the Bab, and stated by Him to have preceded  Moses, is not the same one as King David, the father of King Solomon, who  lived in the tenth century B.C. and who obviously lived many years, and  indeed many centuries after Moses. Abdu'l-Baha has explained this in a  Tablet.          Inheritance      ...Although in the \"Questions & Answers\" Baha'u'llah has specifically  stated that non-Baha'is have no right to inherit from their Baha'i parents  or relatives, yet this restriction applies only to such cases when a  Baha'i dies without leaving a will and when, therefore, his property will  have to be divided in accordance with the rules set forth in the Aqdas.  Otherwise, a Baha'i is free to bequeath his property to any person,  irrespective of religion, provided however he leaves a will, specifying  his wishes. As you see therefore it is always possible for a Baha'i to  provide for his non-Baha'i wife, children or relatives by leaving a will.  And it is only fair that he should do so.          Reason of Severe Laws Revealed by the Bab      ...The severe laws and injunctions revealed by the Bab can be properly  appreciated and understood only when interpreted in the light of His own  statements regarding the nature, purpose and character of His own  Dispensation. As these statements clearly reveal, the Babi Dispensation  was essentially in the nature of a religious and indeed social revolution,  and its duration had therefore to be short, but full of tragic events, of  sweeping and drastic reforms. These drastic measures enforced by the Bab  and His followers were taken with the view of undermining the very  foundations of Shi'ah orthodoxy, and thus paving the way for the coming of  Baha'u'llah. To assert the independence of the new Dispensation, and to  prepare also the ground for the approaching Revelation of Baha'u'llah the  Bab had therefore to reveal very severe laws, even though most of them,  were never enforced. But the mere fact that He revealed them was in itself  a proof of the independent character of His Dispensation and was  sufficient to create such widespread agitation, and excite such opposition  on the part of the clergy that led them to cause His eventual martyrdom.    The Bab specified that the \"Bayan\" is not completed and that \"He Whom God  would manifest\" (Baha'u'llah) would complete it, though not in its actual  form, but only spiritually in the form of another book. The \"Iqan\" is  believed to be its continuation.    February 17, 1939          Teaching--The Paramount Task      He is truly delighted to know that your Annual Convention this year has  been most united, and highly constructive and fruitful in its result, and  trusts that the important discussions and deliberations held by the  delegates at various Convention sessions will have the result of  stimulating afresh the progressive and systematic penetration of the  teaching work throughout India and Burma. The Six-Year Plan of teaching  inaugurated last year by your N.S.A., the Guardian feels, however, cannot  succeed unless it receives the continued moral and material support of the  entire body of the Indian and Burmese believers, and it is this fact which  the National Assembly should continually endeavour to impress upon them  all, through frequent appeals destined at once to encourage and provide  the facilities required for all those friends who are qualified to work in  the field of pioneer teaching. The Guardian would particularly recommend  that the N.S.A. should make every possible effort to open up to the Cause  those Indian provinces which still remain deprived of the light of the  Teachings, and to this end would suggest that those believers who can  arrange to settle in those virgin territories should at once be urged to  do so, and the necessary facilities extended to them by the N.S.A., with  the view of enabling them to prolong their stay"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/19274"],[0,"Letters from the Guardian to Australia and New Zealand (#16)"],[1," had  infinite restrictions and privations to put up with--and, in spite of this,  they are steadily gaining on the requirements of the Plan they have set  for themselves, and, indeed, are startling and inspiring their  fellow-Baha'is everywhere by their spirit and achievements!    He hopes that now, from \"down under\", news will begin to flow out to the  Baha'i World of the remarkable accomplishments of the Australians and New  Zealanders!    Regarding the question you asked him about the Baha'i sacred writings:  these should be regarded as the writings of the Bab, Baha'u'llah and  'Abdu'l-Baha and only these should be read during the purely devotional  part of the Feast.    He wishes to assure you, and all the other members of the N.S.A., of his  most loving and ardent prayers for the success of your various  undertakings and above all, for the success of your teaching Plan.    With warmest greetings,  R. Rabbani.    [From the Guardian:]    Dear and valued co-workers:    The Plan launched by the small yet highly promising community of devoted  believers in Australia and New Zealand constitutes a landmark of unusual  significance in the history of the evolution of the Faith in that far-off  continent. It opens a new chapter, rich in promise, momentous in the  events which it must record, and destined to be regarded as a prelude to  still more glorious chapters in the annals of the Faith in the Antipodes.    The limited resources at the disposal of the prosecutors of the Plan, the  vastness of the territory in which it must operate, the fewness of the  numbers of those participating in its execution, offer a mighty challenge  which no loyal follower of the Faith of Baha'u'llah can either ignore or  minimize. Indeed the greater the challenge, the more bountiful the  blessings which will be vouchsafed from on high, and the richer the reward  to be won by its triumphant executors.    The successful termination of this Plan, the first fruit of the newly  established and properly functioning Administrative Order in those distant  lands, will pave the way for the launching of still greater enterprises,  destined to carry the message of Baha'u'llah to the Islands of the Pacific  in the vicinity of that continent. For the mission entrusted to the care  of the adherents of the Faith in Australia and New Zealand is by no means  confined to the mainland of Australia and the islands of New Zealand, but  should embrace, as it unfolds, in the years to come, the islands of the  Antipodes, where the banner of the Faith still remains to be unfurled and  its Message is as yet undelivered.    It is not for them, however, at the present stage of their evolution, to  probe into the future, and seek to evaluate the range of their future  achievements. They must concentrate every ounce of their energy, and focus  their entire attention, on the tasks immediately ahead, resolved to work  unremittingly and unflinchingly until the goals of the present Plan are  achieved.    Whatever the situation that may develop in the years to come, however  great the obstacles by which a nascent community may yet be faced, no  matter how arduous the task now confronting its members, it must persevere  until the historic work is accomplished.    I will, from the depths of my heart, supplicate the Beloved to reinforce  the noble exertions of this community, guide its steps, clarify its  vision, deepen its understanding of the requirements of the present hour,  and aid it to extend continually the scope of its meritorious  achievements.    My heart longs to receive the news of the progress of this first  collective enterprise on which the community has embarked, and I feel  confident that its stalwart members will not allow the hopes that animate  me to be frustrated.    Your true and grateful brother,  Shoghi.            LETTER OF DEC. 30TH, 1948      N.S.A. of Australia and New Zealand, Secretary, Mrs. Mariette G. Bolton.    Haifa, Dec. 30th, 1948.    Dear Baha'i Sister:    The letter written by our dear Baha'i brother, Mr. Jim Heggie, as  secretary at that time, and dated May 5th, as well as those written by  you, and dated July 17th, Dec. 4th, 6th (two of this date), and 9th,  together with their various enclosures, have been received, and our  beloved Guardian has instructed me to answer your assembly on his behalf.    He was very happy to hear of your meeting held in Melbourne, as he feels  sure this was a great stimulus to the local community, and he hopes that  circumstances will permit the N.S.A. to meet in other communities and  inspire and encourage the friends in different parts of the country by  this personal contact with them and their work.    In regard to the various matters raised in your letters: He would be  pleased to receive reports of the Teaching Work, the Annual Convention and  Annual Reports, and, of course, the minutes of your N.S.A. meetings.    He does not feel it advisable to combine more than one town area in an  Assembly, as you have suggested might be done. It is better for the  friends to move, if possible, into one town's limits, and form their  Assembly that way, or concentrate on their teaching work and wait until  they have the requisite 9 members.    Unfortunately it is not feasible for the believers to elect or constitute  an Assembly and also elect and send delegates to the Annual Convention of  the same year, as both events take place in the Ridvan period.    The Guardian is striving to build up uniformity in essentials all over the  Baha'i World, and this frequently involves a small measure of delay in  achieving our various goals set locally. But he considers it sufficiently  important to warrant the sacrifices it sometimes involves:    In this connection he would like to mention your Local By-Laws: He feels  that they should conform much more closely to the original one of the New  York Assembly. What is absolutely essential was incorporated in those, and  all other local assemblies being incorporated should follow this pattern  as closely as local legal technicalities permit. This again is in order to  maintain international uniformity in essentials. It is not a question here  of whether the By-Laws drawn up by your Legal Committee are not more up to  date and do not represent the last word, undoubtedly they are and do, but  if every country, when drawing up its Local By-Laws, continue this process  of elaboration, in the end uniformity will be lost. The Eastern Assemblies  have adhered to the original By-Laws so carefully that they have  practically translated them word for word and adopted them. He feels sure  Mr. Dive will understand this, and he would like you to please express to  him his deep appreciation of the excellent work he has done in this  connection, truly a labour of love to the Faith.    There is also another, perhaps even more pertinent reason, why he does not  want anything more added to these New York By-Laws, and that is that he is  everywhere urging the believers--the Americans included--to not add  procedures and rulings to the Cause. He considers that what he has laid  down in Baha'i Administration is essential, but that practically  everything else is secondary and he wishes the Assemblies, your own  included, to deal with things with elasticity, as they come up, case by  case, and not by continually passing new rulings to cover all similar  cases.    The efforts being made by your Assembly to carry out the Teaching Plan for  Australia and New Zealand, and the ever-increasing response of the  believers in both places to this all-important work, greatly encourage and  cheer him. He feels sure a very great future lies in store for our beloved  Faith in those distant regions, but much more still remains to be done by  the friends in order to complete this first, historic and vital, organized  Plan of theirs. He feels sure they will see it through to victory; just as  their brothers and sisters in other lands, working also on Plans of their  own, are determined to achieve all their goals at the appointed time, so  must they persevere and ensure a resounding victory for the Faith there in  the Antipodes.    His loving prayers are offered in the Holy Shrines very often for the  success of your work, and that God may bless you and all the members of  the National Assembly in the discharge of your important duties.    With Baha'i love,    Yours in His Service,  R. Rabbani.    P.S. I wish to also acknowledge receipt of the letter of your Assembly's  Treasurer, dated Dec. 23rd, and to thank you, on behalf of the Guardian,  for your loving contribution to the International Fund here in Haifa. He  regrets the delay in getting this off to you, but has been too busy to  attend to it owing to work in connection with the Shrine here. Kindly give  the enclosed receipt to Mr. Tunks.    [From the Guardian:]    Dear and valued co-workers:    Recent communications and reports from your Assembly have revealed, in a  very striking manner, the magnificent progress achieved by the alert, the  faithful, and truly distinguished communities of the followers of the  Faith of Baha'u'llah in Australia, New Zealand and Tasmania. The range of  their labours, the rapid consolidation of their swiftly multiplying  institutions, the soundness and solidity of the foundations, on which they  are erecting these institutions, the exemplary loyalty they demonstrate,  the solidarity and self-sacrifice, the courage and confidence they display  in their incessant and manifold activities, prove, beyond the shadow of a  doubt that the Faith they love and serve so nobly and efficiently has at  last been firmly and unassailably established in the Antipodes, and that  its upholders and defenders in those far-away yet highly promising islands  are contributing a notable and never-to-be-forgotten share to the onward  march and unfoldment of its world Administrative Order.    I desire to offer the members of this high-minded, this"]]]
