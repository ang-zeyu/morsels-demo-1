This request was willingly  granted, and De Villiers was placed under the care of the English  ambulance. Sad to say, he died of his wound.    Some time later I was informed that the man who had carried the request  into Senekal was ex-Commandant Vilonel, who was then serving as a  private burgher. A few days later he surrendered, so that one naturally  inferred that he had arranged it all during his visit to Senekal.    Shortly after he had given up his arms, he sent a letter to one of the  Veldtcornets, asking him to come to such and such a spot on a certain  evening, to meet an English officer and himself. The letter never  reached the hands of the person to whom Vilonel had addressed it; and  instead of the Veldtcornet, it was Captain Pretorius with a few  burghers, who went to the appointed place. The night was so dark that it  was impossible to recognize anybody.    \"Where is Veldtcornet--?\" asked Mr. Vilonel.    \"You are my prisoner,\" was Captain Pretorius' reply, as he took  Vilonel's horse by the bridle.    \"Treason! treason!\" cried poor Vilonel.    They brought him back to the camp, and sent him thence to Bethlehem. A  court-martial[38] was shortly afterwards held at that town, and he was  condemned to a long term of imprisonment.    In the place of General De Villiers I appointed Deacon Paul Roux as  Vechtgeneraal. He was a man in whom I placed absolute confidence. As a  minister of religion he had done good service among the commandos, and  in the fiercest battles he looked after the wounded with undaunted  courage. His advice to the officers on matters of war had also been  excellent, so that he was in every way a most admirable man. But his  fighting career unfortunately soon came to an end, for he was taken  prisoner in a most curious way near Naauwpoort, when Prinsloo  surrendered.    I must now retrace my steps, and give some account of what I myself had  been doing during this time.    I proceeded to the west of Doornberg, and only halted when I reached the  Zand River. What memories does the name of that river bring back to me!  It was on its banks that in 1852 the English Government concluded a  Convention with the Transvaal--only to break it when Sir Theophilus  Shepstone annexed that country on the 12th of April, 1877. But this  Convention was re-established by Gladstone--greatest and noblest of  English statesmen--when he acknowledged the independence of the South  African Republic.    Here on the banks of this river, which was so pregnant with meaning, we  should stand, so I thought, and hold the English at bay. But alas! the  name with all its memories did not check the enemy's advance.    On the 10th of May Lord Roberts attacked us with his united forces; and  although his losses were heavy, he succeeded in breaking through our  lines near Ventersburg, at two points which were held by General  Froneman. And thus the English were free to advance on Kroonstad.    I gave orders to my commando to move on to Doornkop, which lies to the  east of Kroonstad. I myself, with Commandant Nel and some of his  adjutants, followed them when the sun had set. We rode the whole of that  night, and reached the township on the following morning. We immediately  arranged that the Government should withdraw from Kroonstad, and that  very day it was removed to Heilbron. President Steyn, however, did not  go to Heilbron, but paid a visit to General Philip Botha, whose commando  had held back the English outposts some six miles from Kroonstad.    The President, before leaving the town, had stationed police on the  banks of the Valsch River with orders to prevent burghers from entering  the dorp[39]; he had only just crossed the drift before my arrival. I  came upon some burghers who, as they had been ordered, had off-saddled  at the south side of the river, and I asked them if they had seen the  President. As they were Transvaalers, they answered my question in the  negative.    \"But has nobody on horseback crossed here?\" I said.    \"Oh, yes! the Big Constable[40] crossed,\" one of them replied. \"And he  told us not to pass over the drift.\"    \"What was he like?\" I inquired.    \"He was a man with a long red beard.\"    I knew now who the \"Big Constable\" had been; and when I afterwards told  the President for whom he had been taken, he was greatly amused.    General Philip Botha discussed the state of affairs with me, and we both  came to the conclusion that if Lord Roberts attacked us with his united  forces, his superior numbers would render it impossible for us to hold  our disadvantageous positions round Kroonstad. We had also to take into  consideration the fact that my commando could not reach the town before  the following day. Whilst we were still talking, news arrived that there  was a strong force of cavalry on the banks of the Valsch River, six  miles from Kroonstad, and that it was rapidly approaching the town.    On hearing this, I hastened back to the south of the township, where a  body of Kroonstad burghers had off-saddled, and I ordered them to get  into their saddles immediately, and ride with me to meet the enemy. In  less time than it takes to describe it, we were off. As we drew near to  the English we saw they had taken up a very good position. The sun had  already set, and nothing could be done save to exchange a few shots with  the enemy. So, after I had ordered my men to post themselves on the  enemy's front till the following morning, I rode back to Kroonstad.    When I arrived there, I found that the last of the Transvaal commandos  had already retreated through the town and made for the north. I at once  sent orders to the burghers, whom I had just left, to abandon their  positions, and to prepare themselves to depart by train to  Rhenosterriviersbrug.    At Kroonstad there was not a single burgher left. Only the inhabitants  of the township remained, and they were but too ready to \"hands-up.\"    One of these, however, was of a different mould. I refer to Veldtcornet  Thring, who had arrived with me at Kroonstad that morning, but who had  suddenly fallen ill. On the day following he was a prisoner in the hands  of the English.    Thring was an honourable man in every way. Although an Englishman by  birth, he was at heart an Afrikander, for he had accepted the Orange  Free State as his second fatherland. Like many another Englishman, he  had become a fellow-citizen of ours, and had enjoyed the fat of the  land. But now, trusty burgher that he was, he had drawn his sword to  defend the burghers' rights.    His earliest experiences were with the Kroonstad burghers, who went down  into Natal; later on he fought under me at Sanna's Post and  Mostertshoek, and took part in the siege of Colonel Dalgety at  Jammersbergsdrift. He had stood at my side at Thaba'Nchu and on the  banks of the Zand River. I had always found him the most willing and  reliable of officers, and he had won the respect and trust of every man  who knew him.    He was faithful to the end. Although he might well have joined our  enemies, he preferred to set the seal of fidelity upon his life by his  imprisonment. Long may he live to enjoy the trust of the Afrikander  people!    I remained late that evening in the town. It was somewhat risky to do  so, as the place was full of English inhabitants, and of Afrikanders who  did not favour our cause. In fact, I was surrounded by men who would  have been only too pleased to do me an injury.    I said farewell to Kroonstad at ten o'clock that night, and was carried  to Rhenosterriviersbrug, thirty-four miles from Kroonstad, by the last  train that left the town. But before I departed, I took care that the  bridge over the Valsch River should be destroyed by dynamite.    In the meantime, those portions of the Heilbron and Kroonstad commandos  which had gone into Natal at the beginning of the war, received orders  to leave the Drakensberg. Obeying these orders they joined me, and, with  my other troops, had occupied splendid positions on either side of the  railway line. Commandant General Louis Botha was also there with his  Transvaal burghers, having arrived in the Free State a few days  previously. Captain Danie Theron was still with me as my trustworthy  scout, and he constantly kept me informed of Lord Roberts' movements.    For a few days Lord Roberts remained at Kroonstad, but about the 18th  of May he again began to move his enormous forces. He sent out four  divisions. The first he despatched from Kroonstad to Heilbron; the  second from Lindley to the same destination; the third from Kroonstad to  Vredefort and Parijs, and the fourth from Kroonstad along the railway  line.    The two Governments had agreed that Commandant General Louis Botha  should cross the Vaal River, and that we Free-Staters should remain  behind in our own country. And this was carried out, with our full  approval.    The Governments had also decided that even if the English entered the  Transvaal, the Free State commandos were not to follow them. I had long  ago wished that something of this nature should be arranged, so that we  might not only have forces in front of the enemy, but also in their  rear. Thus the orders of the Governments exactly coincided with my  desires.    Lest any one should think that the Transvaalers and the Free-Staters  separated here on account of a squabble, or because they found that they  could not work harmoniously together, let me state that this decision  was arrived at for purely strategic reasons. We had now been reduced to  a third of the original number of forty-five thousand burghers with  which we had started the campaign. This reduction was due partly to  Cronje's surrender, and partly to the fact that many of our men had  returned to their farms. How, then, could we think of making a stand,  with our tiny forces, against two hundred and forty thousand men, with  three or four hundred guns? All we could"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/1881"],[0,"The Call of the Canyon (#16)"],[1,"cinders began to  drag at her feet. At every step she slipped back a few inches, a very  annoying feature of climbing. When her legs seemed to grow dead Carley  paused for a little rest. The last of the ascent, over a few hundred  yards of looser cinders, taxed her remaining strength to the limit. She  grew hot and wet and out of breath. Her heart labored. An unreasonable  antipathy seemed to attend her efforts. Only her ridiculous vanity held  her to this task. She wanted to please Glenn, but not so earnestly that  she would have kept on plodding up this ghastly bare mound of cinders.  Carley did not mind being a tenderfoot, but she hated the thought of  these Westerners considering her a weakling. So she bore the pain of  raw blisters and the miserable sensation of staggering on under a leaden  weight.    Several times she noted that Flo and Stanton halted to face each other  in rather heated argument. At least Stanton's red face and forceful  gestures attested to heat on his part. Flo evidently was weary of  argument, and in answer to a sharp reproach she retorted, \"Shore I  was different after he came.\" To which Stanton responded by a quick  passionate shrinking as if he had been stung.    Carley had her own reaction to this speech she could not help hearing;  and inwardly, at least, her feeling must have been similar to Stanton's.  She forgot the object of this climb and looked off to her right at the  green level without really seeing it. A vague sadness weighed upon her  soul. Was there to be a tangle of fates here, a conflict of wills, a  crossing of loves? Flo's terse confession could not be taken lightly.  Did she mean that she loved Glenn? Carley began to fear it. Only another  reason why she must persuade Glenn to go back East! But the closer  Carley came to what she divined must be an ordeal the more she dreaded  it. This raw, crude West might have confronted her with a situation  beyond her control. And as she dragged her weighted feet through the  cinders, kicking, up little puffs of black dust, she felt what she  admitted to be an unreasonable resentment toward these Westerners and  their barren, isolated, and boundless world.    \"Carley,\" called Flo, \"come--looksee, as the Indians say. Here is  Glenn's Painted Desert, and I reckon it's shore worth seeing.\"    To Carley's surprise, she found herself upon the knob of the foothill.  And when she looked out across a suddenly distinguishable void she  seemed struck by the immensity of something she was unable to grasp. She  dropped her bridle; she gazed slowly, as if drawn, hearing Flo's voice.    \"That thin green line of cottonwoods down there is the Little Colorado  River,\" Flo was saying. \"Reckon it's sixty miles, all down hill. The  Painted Desert begins there and also the Navajo Reservation. You see the  white strips, the red veins, the yellow bars, the black lines. They are  all desert steps leading up and up for miles. That sharp black peak  is called Wildcat. It's about a hundred miles. You see the desert  stretching away to the right, growing dim--lost in distance? We don't  know that country. But that north country we know as landmarks, anyway.  Look at that saw-tooth range. The Indians call it Echo Cliffs. At  the far end it drops off into the Colorado River. Lee's Ferry is  there--about one hundred and sixty miles. That ragged black rent is the  Grand Canyon. Looks like a thread, doesn't it? But Carley, it's some  hole, believe me. Away to the left you see the tremendous wall rising  and turning to come this way. That's the north wall of the Canyon. It  ends at the great bluff--Greenland Point. See the black fringe above the  bar of gold. That's a belt of pine trees. It's about eighty miles across  this ragged old stone washboard of a desert. ... Now turn and look  straight and strain your sight over Wildcat. See the rim purple dome.  You must look hard. I'm glad it's clear and the sun is shining. We don't  often get this view.... That purple dome is Navajo Mountain, two hundred  miles and more away!\"    Carley yielded to some strange drawing power and slowly walked forward  until she stood at the extreme edge of the summit.    What was it that confounded her sight? Desert slope--down and  down--color--distance--space! The wind that blew in her face seemed  to have the openness of the whole world back of it. Cold, sweet,  dry, exhilarating, it breathed of untainted vastness. Carley's memory  pictures of the Adirondacks faded into pastorals; her vaunted images  of European scenery changed to operetta settings. She had nothing with  which to compare this illimitable space.    \"Oh!--America!\" was her unconscious tribute.    Stanton and Flo had come on to places beside her. The young man laughed.  \"Wal, now Miss Carley, you couldn't say more. When I was in camp  trainin' for service overseas I used to remember how this looked. An' it  seemed one of the things I was goin' to fight for. Reckon I didn't the  idea of the Germans havin' my Painted Desert. I didn't get across to  fight for it, but I shore was willin'.\"    \"You see, Carley, this is our America,\" said Flo, softly.    Carley had never understood the meaning of the word. The immensity of  the West seemed flung at her. What her vision beheld, so far-reaching  and boundless, was only a dot on the map.    \"Does any one live--out there?\" she asked, with slow sweep of hand.    \"A few white traders and some Indian tribes,\" replied Stanton. \"But you  can ride all day an' next day an' never see a livin' soul.\"    What was the meaning of the gratification in his voice? Did Westerners  court loneliness? Carley wrenched her gaze from the desert void to look  at her companions. Stanton's eyes were narrowed; his expression had  changed; lean and hard and still, his face resembled bronze. The  careless humor was gone, as was the heated flush of his quarrel with  Flo. The girl, too, had subtly changed, had responded to an influence  that had subdued and softened her. She was mute; her eyes held a light,  comprehensive and all-embracing; she was beautiful then. For Carley,  quick to read emotion, caught a glimpse of a strong, steadfast soul that  spiritualized the brown freckled face.    Carley wheeled to gaze out and down into this incomprehensible abyss,  and on to the far up-flung heights, white and red and yellow, and so  on to the wonderful mystic haze of distance. The significance of Flo's  designation of miles could not be grasped by Carley. She could not  estimate distance. But she did not need that to realize her perceptions  were swallowed up by magnitude. Hitherto the power of her eyes had been  unknown. How splendid to see afar! She could see--yes--but what did she  see? Space first, annihilating space, dwarfing her preconceived images,  and then wondrous colors! What had she known of color? No wonder artists  failed adequately and truly to paint mountains, let alone the desert  space. The toiling millions of the crowded cities were ignorant of this  terrible beauty and sublimity. Would it have helped them to see? But  just to breathe that untainted air, just to see once the boundless open  of colored sand and rock--to realize what the freedom of eagles meant  would not that have helped anyone?    And with the thought there came to Carley's quickened and struggling  mind a conception of freedom. She had not yet watched eagles, but she  now gazed out into their domain. What then must be the effect of such  environment on people whom it encompassed? The idea stunned Carley.  Would such people grow in proportion to the nature with which they  were in conflict? Hereditary influence could not be comparable to such  environment in the shaping of character.    \"Shore I could stand here all day,\" said Flo. \"But it's beginning to  cloud over and this high wind is cold. So we'd better go, Carley.\"    \"I don't know what I am, but it's not cold,\" replied Carley.    \"Wal, Miss Carley, I reckon you'll have to come again an' again before  you get a comfortable feelin' here,\" said Stanton.    It surprised Carley to see that this young Westerner had hit upon  the truth. He understood her. Indeed she was uncomfortable. She was  oppressed, vaguely unhappy. But why? The thing there--the infinitude of  open sand and rock--was beautiful, wonderful, even glorious. She looked  again.    Steep black-cindered slope, with its soft gray patches of grass, sheered  down and down, and out in rolling slope to merge upon a cedar-dotted  level. Nothing moved below, but a red-tailed hawk sailed across her  vision. How still--how gray the desert floor as it reached away, losing  its black dots, and gaining bronze spots of stone! By plain and prairie  it fell away, each inch of gray in her sight magnifying into its  league-long roll. On and on, and down across dark lines that were  steppes, and at last blocked and changed by the meandering green thread  which was the verdure of a desert river. Beyond stretched the white  sand, where whirlwinds of dust sent aloft their funnel-shaped spouts;  and it led up to the horizon-wide ribs and ridges of red and walls of  yellow and mountains of black, to the dim mound of purple so ethereal  and mystic against the deep-blue cloud-curtained band of sky.    And on the moment the sun was obscured and that world of colorful flame  went out, as if a blaze had died.    Deprived of its fire, the desert seemed to retreat, to fade coldly and  gloomily, to lose its great landmarks in dim obscurity. Closer, around  to the north, the canyon country yawned with innumerable gray jaws,  ragged and hard, and the riven earth took on a different character. It  had no shadows. It grew flat and, like the sea, seemed to mirror  the vast gray cloud expanse. The sublime vanished, but the desolate  remained. No warmth--no movement--no life! Dead stone it was, cut into a  million ruts by ruthless ages. Carley felt that she was gazing down into  chaos.    At this moment, as before, a hawk had crossed"]]]
