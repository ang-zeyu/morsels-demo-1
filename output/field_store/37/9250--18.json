Since when, we have had     little new, but onely been making a progresse in those things I then     mentioned. There is yet brought in an Act in which of all others your     corporation is the least concerned: that is, where wives shall refuse     to cohabit with their husbands, that in such case the husband shall     not be liable to pay any debts which she may run into, for clothing,     diet, lodging, or other expenses. I wish with all my heart you were no     more touched in a vote that we haue made for bringing in an Act of a     new Assessment for six moneths, of 70,000li. _per mensem_, to begin     next January. The truth is, the delay ere monyes can be got in, eats     up a great part of all that is levying, and that growing charge of the     Army and Navy doubles upon us. And that is all that can be said for     excuse of ourselues to the Country, to whom we had giuen our own hopes     of no further sessment to be raised, but must now needs incurre the     censure of improvidence before or prodigality now, though it becomes     no private member, the resolution having passed the House, to     interpose further his own judgment in a thing that can not be     remedied; and it will be each man's ingenuity not to grudge an     after-payment for that settlement and freedome from Armyes and Navyes,     which before he would haue been glad to purchase with his whole     fortune. There remain some eight Regiments to be disbanded, but those     all horse in a manner, and some seauenteen shipps to be payd of, that     haue laid so long upon charge in the harbour, beside fourscore shipps     which are reckoned to us for this Winter guard. But after that, all     things are to go upon his Majestye's own purse out of the Tunnage and     Poundage and his other revenues. But there being so great a provision     made for mony, I doubt not but ere we rise, to see the whole army     disbanded, and according to the Act, hope to see your Town once more     ungarrisond, in which I should be glad and happy to be instrumentall     to the uttermost. For I can not but remember, though then a child,     those blessed days when the youth of your own town were trained for     your militia, and did, methought, become their arms much better than     any soldiers that I haue seen there since. And it will not be amisse     if you please (now that we are about a new Act of regulating the     Militia, that it may be as a standing strength, but not as ill as a     perpetuall Army to the Nation) to signify to me any thing in that     matter that were according to your ancient custome and desirable for     you. For though I can promise little, yet I intend all things for your     service. The Act for review of the Poll bill proceeds, and that for     making this Declaration of his Majesty a Law in religious matters.     Order likewise is giuen for drawing up all the votes made during our     last sitting, in the businesse of Sales of Bishops' and Deans' and     Chapters' lands into an Act, which I should be glad to see passed. The     purchasers the other day offerd the house 600,000li. in ready mony,     and to make the Bishops', etc., revenue as good or better then before.     But the House thought it not fit or seasonable to hearken to it. We     are so much the more concernd to see that great interest of the     purchasers satisfyed and quieted, at least in that way which our own     votes haue propounded. On Munday next we are to return to the     consideration of apportioning 100,000li. per annum upon all the lands     in the nation, in lieu of the Court of Wards. The debate among the     Countyes, each thinking it self overrated, makes the successe of that     businesse something casuall, and truly I shall not assist it much for     my part, for it is little reason that your Town should contribute in     that charge. The Excise bill for longer continuance (I wish it proue     not too long) will come in also next weeke. And I foresee we shall be     called upon shortly to effect our vote made the former sitting, of     raising his Majestie's revenue to 1,200,000li. per Annum. I do not     love to write so much of this mony news. But I think you haue observed     that Parliaments have been always made use of to that purpose, and     though we may buy gold too deare, yet we must at any rate be glad of     Peace, Freedom, and a good Conscience. Mr. Maior tells me, your     duplicates of the Poll are coming up. I shall go with them to the     Exchequer and make your excuse, if any be requisite. My long silence     hath made me now trespasse on the other hand in a long letter, but I     doubt not of your good construction of so much familiarity and trouble     from, Gentlemen, your most affectionate friend and servant,                                                           \"ANDR: MARVELL.       \"WESTMINSTER, _Nov. 17, 1660._\"    Although this first letter of the Hull correspondence is dated the 17th  of November 1660, the Convention Parliament began its sittings on the  25th of April.    In composition this Convention Parliament was very like Richard  Cromwell's, and indeed it contained many of the same members, whose  loyalty, however, was less restrained than in 1659. All the world knew  what brought this Parliament together. It was to make the nation's  peace with its king, either on terms or without terms. \"We are all  Royalists now\" are words which must often have been on the lips of the  members of this House. One can imagine the smiles, half grim, half  ironical, that would accompany their utterance. Such a right-about-face  could never be dignified. It is impossible not to be reminded of  schoolboys at the inevitable end of \"a barring out.\" The sarcastic  comment of Clarendon has not lost its sting. \"From this time there was  such an emulation and impatience in Lords, Commons, and City, and  generally over the Kingdom, who should make the most lively expressions  of their duty and of their joy, that a man could not but wonder where  those people dwelt who had done all the mischief and kept the King so  many years from enjoying the comfort and support of such excellent  subjects.\"[88:1]    The most significant sentence in Marvell's first letter to his  constituents is that in which he refers to the Bill for making Charles's  declaration in religious matters the law of the land. Had the passing of  any such Bill been possible, how different the history of England would  have been!    The declaration Marvell is referring to was contained in the famous  message from Breda, which was addressed by Charles to all his loving  subjects of what degree or quality, and was expressed as follows:--       \"And because the passion and uncharitableness of the times have     produced several opinions in Religion by which men are engaged in     parties and animosities against each other (which, when they shall     hereafter unite in a freedom of conversation, will be composed or     better understood) we do declare a liberty to tender Consciences, and     that no man shall be disquieted or called in question for differences     of opinion in matters of Religion which do not disturb the peace of     the Kingdom; and that we shall be ready to consent to such an Act of     Parliament as upon mature deliberation shall be offered to us for the     full granting of that indulgence.\"    It is only doing the king bare justice to say that he was always ready  and willing to keep this part of his royal word--but it proved an  impossibility.    A Roman Catholic as a matter of creed, a Hobbist in conversation, a  sensualist in practice, and the shrewdest though most indolent of cynics  in council, Charles, in this matter of religious toleration, would  gladly have kept his word, not indeed because it was his word, for on  the point of honour he was indifferent, but because it jumped with his  humour, and would have mitigated the hard lot of the Catholics. Charles  was not a theorist, all his tastes being eminently practical, not to say  scientific. He was not a tyrant, but a _de facto_ man from head to heel.  For the _jure divino_ of the English Episcopate he cared as little as  Oliver had ever done for the _jure divino_ of the English Crown. Oliver  once said, and he was not given to _braggadocio_, that he would fire his  pistol at the king \"as soon as at another if he met him in battle,\" and  the second Charles would have thought no more of beheading an Anglican  bishop than he did of sending Sir Harry Vane to the scaffold. Honesty  and virtue, on the rare occasions Charles encountered them, he admired  much as a painter admires the colours of a fine sunset. Above everything  else Charles was determined never again, if he could help it, to be sent  on his travels, to be snubbed and starved in foreign courts.    Sir Thomas Urquhart of Cromartie, the first and best translator of  Rabelais, is said to have died of laughing on hearing of the  Restoration; Charles did not die, but he must have laughed inwardly at  the spectacle that met his eyes everywhere as he made his  often-described progress from Dover to London, and examined the gorgeous  beds and quilts, fine linen and carpets, couches, horses and liveries,  his faithful Commons had been at the pains and at the expense of  providing for his comfort.    A few years afterwards Marvell wrote the following lines:--        \"Of a tall stature and of sable hue,      Much like the son of Kish, that lofty Jew;      Twelve years complete he suffered in exile      And kept his father's asses all the while.      At length, by wonderful impulse of fate,      The people called him home to help the state,      And what is more they sent him money too      To clothe him all from head to foot anew;      Nor did he such small favours then disdain,      Who in his thirtieth year began his reign.\"[90:1]    The \"small favours\" grew in size year by"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/17396"],[0,"The Secret Garden (#16)"],[1,"she threw her arms over her face  and burst out crying--poor little Mistress Mary.    Dickon's curious blue eyes grew rounder and rounder.    \"Eh-h-h!\" he said, drawing his exclamation out slowly, and the way he  did it meant both wonder and sympathy.    \"I've nothing to do,\" said Mary. \"Nothing belongs to me. I found it  myself and I got into it myself. I was only just like the robin, and  they wouldn't take it from the robin.\"    \"Where is it?\" asked Dickon in a dropped voice.    Mistress Mary got up from the log at once. She knew she felt contrary  again, and obstinate, and she did not care at all. She was imperious and  Indian, and at the same time hot and sorrowful.    \"Come with me and I'll show you,\" she said.    She led him round the laurel path and to the walk where the ivy grew so  thickly. Dickon followed her with a queer, almost pitying, look on his  face. He felt as if he were being led to look at some strange bird's  nest and must move softly. When she stepped to the wall and lifted the  hanging ivy he started. There was a door and Mary pushed it slowly open  and they passed in together, and then Mary stood and waved her hand  round defiantly.    \"It's this,\" she said. \"It's a secret garden, and I'm the only one in  the world who wants it to be alive.\"    Dickon looked round and round about it, and round and round again.    \"Eh!\" he almost whispered, \"it is a queer, pretty place! It's like as if  a body was in a dream.\"          CHAPTER XI    THE NEST OF THE MISSEL THRUSH      For two or three minutes he stood looking round him, while Mary watched  him, and then he began to walk about softly, even more lightly than Mary  had walked the first time she had found herself inside the four walls.  His eyes seemed to be taking in everything--the gray trees with the gray  creepers climbing over them and hanging from their branches, the tangle  on the walls and among the grass, the evergreen alcoves with the stone  seats and tall flower urns standing in them.    \"I never thought I'd see this place,\" he said at last, in a whisper.    \"Did you know about it?\" asked Mary.    She had spoken aloud and he made a sign to her.    \"We must talk low,\" he said, \"or some one'll hear us an' wonder what's  to do in here.\"    \"Oh! I forgot!\" said Mary, feeling frightened and putting her hand  quickly against her mouth. \"Did you know about the garden?\" she asked  again when she had recovered herself.    Dickon nodded.    \"Martha told me there was one as no one ever went inside,\" he answered.  \"Us used to wonder what it was like.\"    He stopped and looked round at the lovely gray tangle about him, and his  round eyes looked queerly happy.    \"Eh! the nests as'll be here come springtime,\" he said. \"It'd be th'  safest nestin' place in England. No one never comin' near an' tangles o'  trees an' roses to build in. I wonder all th' birds on th' moor don't  build here.\"    Mistress Mary put her hand on his arm again without knowing it.    \"Will there be roses?\" she whispered. \"Can you tell? I thought perhaps  they were all dead.\"    \"Eh! No! Not them--not all of 'em!\" he answered. \"Look here!\"    He stepped over to the nearest tree--an old, old one with gray lichen  all over its bark, but upholding a curtain of tangled sprays and  branches. He took a thick knife out of his pocket and opened one of its  blades.    \"There's lots o' dead wood as ought to be cut out,\" he said. \"An'  there's a lot o' old wood, but it made some new last year. This here's a  new bit,\" and he touched a shoot which looked brownish green instead of  hard, dry gray.    Mary touched it herself in an eager, reverent way.    \"That one?\" she said. \"Is that one quite alive--quite?\"    Dickon curved his wide smiling mouth.    \"It's as wick as you or me,\" he said; and Mary remembered that Martha  had told her that \"wick\" meant \"alive\" or \"lively.\"    \"I'm glad it's wick!\" she cried out in her whisper. \"I want them all to  be wick. Let us go round the garden and count how many wick ones there  are.\"    She quite panted with eagerness, and Dickon was as eager as she was.  They went from tree to tree and from bush to bush. Dickon carried his  knife in his hand and showed her things which she thought wonderful.    \"They've run wild,\" he said, \"but th' strongest ones has fair thrived on  it. The delicatest ones has died out, but th' others has growed an'  growed, an' spread an' spread, till they's a wonder. See here!\" and he  pulled down a thick gray, dry-looking branch. \"A body might think this  was dead wood, but I don't believe it is--down to th' root. I'll cut it  low down an' see.\"    He knelt and with his knife cut the lifeless-looking branch through, not  far above the earth.    \"There!\" he said exultantly. \"I told thee so. There's green in that  wood yet. Look at it.\"    Mary was down on her knees before he spoke, gazing with all her might.    \"When it looks a bit greenish an' juicy like that, it's wick,\" he  explained. \"When th' inside is dry an' breaks easy, like this here piece  I've cut off, it's done for. There's a big root here as all this live  wood sprung out of, an' if th' old wood's cut off an' it's dug round,  an' took care of there'll be--\" he stopped and lifted his face to look  up at the climbing and hanging sprays above him--\"there'll be a fountain  o' roses here this summer.\"    They went from bush to bush and from tree to tree. He was very strong  and clever with his knife and knew how to cut the dry and dead wood  away, and could tell when an unpromising bough or twig had still green  life in it. In the course of half an hour Mary thought she could tell  too, and when he cut through a lifeless-looking branch she would cry out  joyfully under her breath when she caught sight of the least shade of  moist green. The spade, and hoe, and fork were very useful. He showed  her how to use the fork while he dug about roots with the spade and  stirred the earth and let the air in.    They were working industriously round one of the biggest standard roses  when he caught sight of something which made him utter an exclamation of  surprise.    \"Why!\" he cried, pointing to the grass a few feet away. \"Who did that  there?\"    It was one of Mary's own little clearings round the pale green points.    \"I did it,\" said Mary.    \"Why, I thought tha' didn't know nothin' about gardenin',\" he exclaimed.    \"I don't,\" she answered, \"but they were so little, and the grass was so  thick and strong, and they looked as if they had no room to breathe. So  I made a place for them. I don't even know what they are.\"    Dickon went and knelt down by them, smiling his wide smile.    \"Tha' was right,\" he said. \"A gardener couldn't have told thee better.  They'll grow now like Jack's bean-stalk. They're crocuses an' snowdrops,  an' these here is narcissuses,\" turning to another patch, \"an' here's  daffydowndillys. Eh! they will be a sight.\"    He ran from one clearing to another.    \"Tha' has done a lot o' work for such a little wench,\" he said, looking  her over.    \"I'm growing fatter,\" said Mary, \"and I'm growing stronger. I used  always to be tired. When I dig I'm not tired at all. I like to smell  the earth when it's turned up.\"    \"It's rare good for thee,\" he said, nodding his head wisely. \"There's  naught as nice as th' smell o' good clean earth, except th' smell o'  fresh growin' things when th' rain falls on 'em. I get out on th' moor  many a day when it's rainin' an' I lie under a bush an' listen to th'  soft swish o' drops on th' heather an' I just sniff an' sniff. My nose  end fair quivers like a rabbit's, mother says.\"    \"Do you never catch cold?\" inquired Mary, gazing at him wonderingly. She  had never seen such a funny boy, or such a nice one.    \"Not me,\" he said, grinning. \"I never ketched cold since I was born. I  wasn't brought up nesh enough. I've chased about th' moor in all  weathers same as th' rabbits does. Mother says I've sniffed up too much  fresh air for twelve year' to ever get to sniffin' with cold. I'm as  tough as a white-thorn knobstick.\"    He was working all the time he was talking and Mary was following him  and helping him with her fork or the trowel.    \"There's a lot of work to do here!\" he said once, looking about quite  exultantly.    \"Will you come again and help me to do it?\" Mary begged. \"I'm sure I can  help, too. I can dig and pull up weeds, and do whatever you tell me.  Oh! do come, Dickon!\"    \"I'll come every day if tha' wants me, rain or shine,\" he answered  stoutly. \"It's th' best fun I ever had in my life--shut in here an'  wakenin' up a garden.\"    \"If you will come,\" said Mary, \"if you will help me to make it alive  I'll--I don't know what I'll do,\" she ended helplessly. What could you  do for a boy like that?    \"I'll tell thee what tha'll do,\" said Dickon, with his happy grin.  \"Tha'll get fat an' tha'll get as hungry as a young fox an' tha'll learn  how to talk to th' robin same as I do. Eh! we'll have a lot o' fun.\"    He began to walk about, looking up in the trees and at the walls and  bushes with a thoughtful expression.    \"I wouldn't want to make it look like a gardener's garden, all clipped  an' spick an' span, would you?\" he said. \"It's nicer like this with  things runnin' wild, an' swingin' an' catchin' hold of each other.\"    \"Don't let us make it tidy,\" said Mary anxiously. \"It wouldn't seem like  a secret garden if it was tidy.\"    Dickon stood rubbing his rusty-red head with a rather puzzled look.    \"It's a secret garden sure enough,\" he said, \"but seems like some one  besides th' robin must have been in it since it was shut up ten year'  ago.\"    \"But the door was locked and the key was buried,\" said Mary. \"No one  could get in.\"    \"That's true,\" he answered. \"It's a queer place. Seems to me as if  there'd been a bit o' prunin' done here an' there, later than ten year'  ago.\"    \"But how could it have been done?\" said Mary.    He was examining a branch of a standard rose and he shook his head.    "]]]
