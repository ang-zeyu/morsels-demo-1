[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/2064"],[0,"A Journey to the Western Islands of Scotland (#16)"],[1," sometimes produce great heat in northern latitudes;  but this can only happen in sheltered places, where the atmosphere is to  a certain degree stagnant, and the same mass of air continues to receive  for many hours the rays of the sun, and the vapours of the earth.  Sky  lies open on the west and north to a vast extent of ocean, and is cooled  in the summer by perpetual ventilation, but by the same blasts is kept  warm in winter.  Their weather is not pleasing.  Half the year is deluged  with rain.  From the autumnal to the vernal equinox, a dry day is hardly  known, except when the showers are suspended by a tempest.  Under such  skies can be expected no great exuberance of vegetation.  Their winter  overtakes their summer, and their harvest lies upon the ground drenched  with rain.  The autumn struggles hard to produce some of our early  fruits.  I gathered gooseberries in September; but they were small, and  the husk was thick.    Their winter is seldom such as puts a full stop to the growth of plants,  or reduces the cattle to live wholly on the surplusage of the summer.  In  the year Seventy-one they had a severe season, remembered by the name of  the Black Spring, from which the island has not yet recovered.  The snow  lay long upon the ground, a calamity hardly known before.  Part of their  cattle died for want, part were unseasonably sold to buy sustenance for  the owners; and, what I have not read or heard of before, the kine that  survived were so emaciated and dispirited, that they did not require the  male at the usual time.  Many of the roebucks perished.    The soil, as in other countries, has its diversities.  In some parts  there is only a thin layer of earth spread upon a rock, which bears  nothing but short brown heath, and perhaps is not generally capable of  any better product.  There are many bogs or mosses of greater or less  extent, where the soil cannot be supposed to want depth, though it is too  wet for the plow.  But we did not observe in these any aquatick plants.  The vallies and the mountains are alike darkened with heath.  Some grass,  however, grows here and there, and some happier spots of earth are  capable of tillage.    Their agriculture is laborious, and perhaps rather feeble than unskilful.  Their chief manure is seaweed, which, when they lay it to rot upon the  field, gives them a better crop than those of the Highlands.  They heap  sea shells upon the dunghill, which in time moulder into a fertilising  substance.  When they find a vein of earth where they cannot use it, they  dig it up, and add it to the mould of a more commodious place.    Their corn grounds often lie in such intricacies among the craggs, that  there is no room for the action of a team and plow.  The soil is then  turned up by manual labour, with an instrument called a crooked spade, of  a form and weight which to me appeared very incommodious, and would  perhaps be soon improved in a country where workmen could be easily found  and easily paid.  It has a narrow blade of iron fixed to a long and heavy  piece of wood, which must have, about a foot and a half above the iron, a  knee or flexure with the angle downwards.  When the farmer encounters a  stone which is the great impediment of his operations, he drives the  blade under it, and bringing the knee or angle to the ground, has in the  long handle a very forcible lever.    According to the different mode of tillage, farms are distinguished into  long land and short land.  Long land is that which affords room for a  plow, and short land is turned up by the spade.    The grain which they commit to the furrows thus tediously formed, is  either oats or barley.  They do not sow barley without very copious  manure, and then they expect from it ten for one, an increase equal to  that of better countries; but the culture is so operose that they content  themselves commonly with oats; and who can relate without compassion,  that after all their diligence they are to expect only a triple increase?  It is in vain to hope for plenty, when a third part of the harvest must  be reserved for seed.    When their grain is arrived at the state which they must consider as  ripeness, they do not cut, but pull the barley: to the oats they apply  the sickle.  Wheel carriages they have none, but make a frame of timber,  which is drawn by one horse with the two points behind pressing on the  ground.  On this they sometimes drag home their sheaves, but often convey  them home in a kind of open panier, or frame of sticks upon the horse's  back.    Of that which is obtained with so much difficulty, nothing surely ought  to be wasted; yet their method of clearing their oats from the husk is by  parching them in the straw.  Thus with the genuine improvidence of  savages, they destroy that fodder for want of which their cattle may  perish.  From this practice they have two petty conveniences.  They dry  the grain so that it is easily reduced to meal, and they escape the theft  of the thresher.  The taste contracted from the fire by the oats, as by  every other scorched substance, use must long ago have made grateful.  The  oats that are not parched must be dried in a kiln.    The barns of Sky I never saw.  That which Macleod of Raasay had erected  near his house was so contrived, because the harvest is seldom brought  home dry, as by perpetual perflation to prevent the mow from heating.    Of their gardens I can judge only from their tables.  I did not observe  that the common greens were wanting, and suppose, that by choosing an  advantageous exposition, they can raise all the more hardy esculent  plants.  Of vegetable fragrance or beauty they are not yet studious.  Few  vows are made to Flora in the Hebrides.    They gather a little hay, but the grass is mown late; and is so often  almost dry and again very wet, before it is housed, that it becomes a  collection of withered stalks without taste or fragrance; it must be  eaten by cattle that have nothing else, but by most English farmers would  be thrown away.    In the Islands I have not heard that any subterraneous treasures have  been discovered, though where there are mountains, there are commonly  minerals.  One of the rocks in Col has a black vein, imagined to consist  of the ore of lead; but it was never yet opened or essayed.  In Sky a  black mass was accidentally picked up, and brought into the house of the  owner of the land, who found himself strongly inclined to think it a  coal, but unhappily it did not burn in the chimney.  Common ores would be  here of no great value; for what requires to be separated by fire, must,  if it were found, be carried away in its mineral state, here being no  fewel for the smelting-house or forge.  Perhaps by diligent search in  this world of stone, some valuable species of marble might be discovered.  But neither philosophical curiosity, nor commercial industry, have yet  fixed their abode here, where the importunity of immediate want supplied  but for the day, and craving on the morrow, has left little room for  excursive knowledge or the pleasing fancies of distant profit.    They have lately found a manufacture considerably lucrative.  Their rocks  abound with kelp, a sea-plant, of which the ashes are melted into glass.  They burn kelp in great quantities, and then send it away in ships, which  come regularly to purchase them.  This new source of riches has raised  the rents of many maritime farms; but the tenants pay, like all other  tenants, the additional rent with great unwillingness; because they  consider the profits of the kelp as the mere product of personal labour,  to which the landlord contributes nothing.  However, as any man may be  said to give, what he gives the power of gaining, he has certainly as  much right to profit from the price of kelp as of any thing else found or  raised upon his ground.    This new trade has excited a long and eager litigation between Macdonald  and Macleod, for a ledge of rocks, which, till the value of kelp was  known, neither of them desired the reputation of possessing.    The cattle of Sky are not so small as is commonly believed.  Since they  have sent their beeves in great numbers to southern marts, they have  probably taken more care of their breed.  At stated times the annual  growth of cattle is driven to a fair, by a general drover, and with the  money, which he returns to the farmer, the rents are paid.    The price regularly expected, is from two to three pounds a head: there  was once one sold for five pounds.  They go from the Islands very lean,  and are not offered to the butcher, till they have been long fatted in  English pastures.    Of their black cattle, some are without horns, called by the Scots humble  cows, as we call a bee an humble bee, that wants a sting.  Whether this  difference be specifick, or accidental, though we inquired with great  diligence, we could not be informed.  We are not very sure that the bull  is ever without horns, though we have been told, that such bulls there  are.  What is produced by putting a horned and unhorned male and female  together, no man has ever tried, that thought the result worthy of  observation.    Their horses are, like their cows, of a moderate size.  I had no  difficulty to mount myself commodiously by the favour of the gentlemen.  I  heard of very little cows in Barra, and very little horses in Rum, where  perhaps no care is taken to prevent that diminution of size, which must  always happen, where the greater and the less copulate promiscuously, and  the young animal is restrained from growth by penury of sustenance.    The goat is the general inhabitant of the earth, complying with every  difference of climate, and of soil.  The goats of the Hebrides are like  others: nor did I hear any thing of their sheep, to be particularly  remarked.    In the penury of these malignant regions, nothing is left that can be  converted to food.

We've got him! ... We'll put a rope on  him before this time to-morrow!\"    Slone yielded to his strange, wild joy, but it did not last long, soon  succeeding to sober, keen thought. He rode down into the bowl a mile,  making absolutely certain that Wildfire could not climb out on that  side. The far end, beyond the monuments, was a sheer wall of rock. Then  he crossed to the left side. Here the sandy slope was almost too steep  for even him to go up. And there was grass that would burn. He returned  to the pass assured that Wildfire had at last fallen into a trap the  like Slone had never dreamed of. The great horse was doomed to run into  living flame or the whirling noose of a lasso.    Then Slone reflected. Nagger had that very morning had his fill of good  water--the first really satisfying drink for days. If he was rested  that day, on the morrow he would be fit for the grueling work possibly  in store for him. Slone unsaddled the horse and turned him loose, and  with a snort he made down the gentle slope for the grass. Then Slone  carried his saddle to a shady spot afforded by a slab of rock and a  dwarf cedar, and here he composed himself to rest and watch and think  and wait.    Wildfire was plainly in sight no more than two miles away. Gradually he  was grazing along toward the monuments and the far end of the great  basin. Slone believed, because the place was so large, that Wildfire  thought there was a way out on the other side or over the slopes or  through the walls. Never before had the far-sighted stallion made a  mistake. Slone suddenly felt the keen, stabbing fear of an outlet  somewhere. But it left him quickly. He had studied those slopes and  walls. Wildfire could not get out, except by the pass he had entered,  unless he could fly.    Slone lay in the shade, his head propped on his saddle, and while  gazing down into the shimmering hollow he began to plan. He calculated  that he must be able to carry fire swiftly across the far end of the  basin, so that he would not be absent long from the mouth of the pass.  Fire was always a difficult matter, since he must depend only on flint  and steel. He decided to wait till dark, build a fire with dead cedar  sticks, and carry a bundle of them with burning ends. He felt assured  that the wind caused by riding would keep them burning. After he had  lighted the grass all he had to do was to hurry back to his station and  there await developments.    The day passed slowly, and it was hot. The heat-waves rose in dark,  wavering lines and veils from the valley. The wind blew almost a gale.  Thin, curling sheets of sand blew up over the crests of the slopes, and  the sound it made was a soft, silken rustling, very low. The sky was a  steely blue above and copper close over the distant walls.    That afternoon, toward the close, Slone ate the last of the meat. At  sunset the wind died away and the air cooled. There was a strip of red  along the wall of rock and on the tips of the monuments, and it  lingered there for long, a strange, bright crown. Nagger was not far  away, but Wildfire had disappeared, probably behind one of the  monuments.    When twilight fell Slone went down after Nagger and, returning with  him, put on bridle and saddle. Then he began to search for suitable  sticks of wood. Farther back in the pass he found stunted dead cedars,  and from these secured enough for his purpose. He kindled a fire and  burnt the ends of the sticks into red embers. Making a bundle of these,  he put them under his arm, the dull, glowing ends backward, and then  mounted his horse.    It was just about dark when he faced down into the valley. When he  reached level ground he kept to the edge of the left slope and put  Nagger to a good trot. The grass and brush were scant here, and the  color of the sand was light, so he had no difficulty in traveling.    From time to time his horse went through grass, and its dry, crackling  rustle, showing how it would burn, was music to Slone. Gradually the  monuments began to loom up, bold and black against the blue sky, with  stars seemingly hanging close over them. Slone had calculated that the  basin was smaller than it really was, in both length and breadth. This  worried him. Wildfire might see or hear or scent him, and make a break  back to the pass and thus escape. Slone was glad when the huge, dark  monuments were indistinguishable from the black, frowning wall. He had  to go slower here, because of the darkness. But at last he reached the  slow rise of jumbled rock that evidently marked the extent of  weathering on that side. Here he turned to the right and rode out into  the valley. The floor was level and thickly overgrown with long, dead  grass and dead greasewood, as dry as tinder. It was easy to account for  the dryness; neither snow nor rain had visited that valley for many  months. Slone whipped one of the sticks in the wind and soon had the  smoldering end red and showering sparks. Then he dropped the stick in  the grass, with curious intent and a strange feeling of regret.    Instantly the grass blazed with a little sputtering roar. Nagger  snorted. \"Wildfire!\" exclaimed Slone. That word was a favorite one with  riders, and now Slone used it both to call out his menace to the  stallion and to express his feeling for that blaze, already running  wild.    Without looking back Slone rode across the valley, dropping a glowing  stick every quarter of a mile. When he reached the other side there  were a dozen fires behind him, burning slowly, with white smoke rising  lazily. Then he loped Nagger along the side back to the sandy ascent,  and on up to the mouth of the pass. There he searched for tracks.  Wildfire had not gone out, and Slone experienced relief and exultation.  He took up a position in the middle of the narrowest part of the pass,  and there, with Nagger ready for anything, he once more composed  himself to watch and wait.    Far across the darkness of the valley, low down, twelve lines of fire,  widely separated, crept toward one another. They appeared thin and  slow, with only an occasional leaping flame. And some of the black  spaces must have been monuments, blotting out the creeping snail-lines  of red. Slone watched, strangely fascinated.    \"What do you think of that?\" he said, aloud, and he meant his query for  Wildfire.    As he watched the lines perceptibly lengthened and brightened and pale  shadows of smoke began to appear. Over at the left of the valley the  two brightest fires, the first he had started, crept closer and closer  together. They seemed long in covering distance. But not a breath of  wind stirred, and besides they really might move swiftly, without  looking so to Slone. When the two lines met a sudden and larger blaze  rose.    \"Ah!\" said the rider, and then he watched the other lines creeping  together. How slowly fire moved, he thought. The red stallion would  have every chance to run between those lines, if he dared. But a wild  horse feared nothing like fire. This one would not run the gantlet of  flames. Nevertheless, Slone felt more and more relieved as the lines  closed. The hours of the night dragged past until at length one long,  continuous line of fire spread level across the valley, its bright, red  line broken only where the monuments of stone were silhouetted against  it.    The darkness of the valley changed. The light of the moon changed. The  radiance of the stars changed. Either the line of fire was finding  denser fuel to consume or it was growing appreciably closer, for the  flames began to grow, to leap, and to flare.    Slone strained his ears for the thud of hoofs on sand.    The time seemed endless in its futility of results, but fleeting after  it had passed; and he could tell how the hours fled by the  ever-recurring need to replenish the little fire he kept burning in the  pass.    A broad belt of valley grew bright in the light, and behind it loomed  the monuments, weird and dark, with columns of yellow and white smoke  wreathing them.    Suddenly Slone's sensitive ear vibrated to a thrilling sound. He leaned  down to place his ear to the sand. Rapid, rhythmic beat of hoofs made  him leap to his feet, reaching for his lasso with right hand and a gun  with his left.    Nagger lifted his head, sniffed the air, and snorted. Slone peered into  the black belt of gloom that lay below him. It would be hard to see a  horse there, unless he got high enough to be silhouetted against that  line of fire now flaring to the sky. But he heard the beat of hoofs,  swift, sharp, louder--louder. The night shadows were deceptive. That  wonderful light confused him, made the place unreal. Was he dreaming?  Or had the long chase and his privations unhinged his mind? He reached  for Nagger. No! The big black was real, alive, quivering, pounding the  sand. He scented an enemy.    Once more Slone peered down into the void or what seemed a void. But  it, too, had changed, lightened. The whole valley was brightening.  Great palls of curling smoke rose white and yellow, to turn back as the  monuments met their crests, and then to roll upward, blotting out the  stars. It was such a light as he had never seen, except in dreams. Pale  moonlight and dimmed starlight and wan dawn all vague and strange and  shadowy under the wild and vivid light of burning grass.    In the pale path before Slone, that fanlike slope of sand which opened  down into the valley, appeared a swiftly moving black object, like a  fleeting phantom. It was a phantom horse. Slone felt that his eyes,  deceived by his mind, saw racing images. Many a wild chase he had lived  in dreams on some far desert. But what was that beating in his  ears--sharp, swift, even, rhythmic? Never had his ears played him  false. Never had he heard things in his dreams. That running object was"]]]
