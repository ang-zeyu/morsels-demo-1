When, then, the news was brought that the little boy at the blacksmith's  was ill with the smallpox, poor Harry Esmond felt a shock of alarm, not  so much for himself as for his mistress's son, whom he might have  brought into peril. Beatrix, who had pouted sufficiently, her little  brother being now gone to bed, was for taking her place on Esmond's  knee. But as she advanced toward him, he started back and placed the  great chair on which he was sitting between him and her--saying in the  French language to Lady Castlewood, \"Madam, the child must not approach  me. I must tell you that I was at the blacksmith's to-day and had his  little boy on my lap.\"    \"Where you took my son afterward,\" Lady Castlewood said, very angry and  turning red. \"I thank you, sir, for giving him such company. Beatrix,\"  she said in English, \"I forbid you to touch Harry Esmond. Come away,  child; come to your room. And you, sir, had you not better go back to  the alehouse?\"    Her eyes, ordinarily so kind, darted flashes of anger as she spoke; and  she tossed up her head (which hung down commonly) with the [v]mien of a  princess.    \"Heyday!\" said my Lord, who was standing by the fireplace, \"Rachel, what  are you in a passion about? Though it does you good to get in a  passion--you look very handsome!\"    \"It is, my Lord, because Mr. Harry Esmond, having nothing to do with his  time here, and not having a taste for our company, has been to the  blacksmith's alehouse, where he has some friends.\"    My Lord burst out with a laugh.    \"Take Mistress Beatrix to bed,\" my Lady cried at this moment to her  woman, who came in with her Ladyship's tea. \"Put her into my room--no,  into yours,\" she added quickly. \"Go, my child: go, I say; not a word.\"  And Beatrix, quite surprised at so sudden a tone of authority from one  who was seldom accustomed to raise her voice, went out of the room with  a scared face and waited even to burst out crying until she got  upstairs.    For once, her mother took little heed of her. \"My Lord,\" she said, \"this  young man--your relative--told me just now in French--he was ashamed to  speak in his own language--that he had been at the blacksmith's all day,  where he has had that little wretch who is now ill of the smallpox on  his knee. And he comes home reeking from that place--yes, reeking from  it--and takes my boy into his lap without shame, and sits down by me. He  may have killed Frank for what I know--killed our child! Why was he  brought in to disgrace our house? Why is he here? Let him go--let him  go, I say, and [v]pollute the place no more!\"    She had never before uttered a syllable of unkindness to Harry Esmond,  and her cruel words smote the poor boy so that he stood for some moments  bewildered with grief and rage at the injustice of such a stab from such  a hand. He turned quite white from red, which he had been before.    \"If my coming nigh your boy pollutes him,\" he said, \"it was not so  always. Good-night, my Lord. Heaven bless you and yours for your  goodness to me. I have tired her Ladyship's kindness out, and I will  go.\"    \"He wants to go to the alehouse--let him go!\" cried my Lady.    \"I'll be hanged if he shall,\" said my Lord. \"I didn't think you could be  so cruel, Rachel!\"    Her reply was to burst into a flood of tears, and to quit the room with  a rapid glance at Harry Esmond, as my Lord put his broad hand on Harry's  shoulder.    In a little while my Lady came back, looking very pale, with a  handkerchief in her hand. Instantly advancing to Harry Esmond, she took  his hand. \"I beg your pardon, Harry,\" she said. \"I spoke very  unkindly.\"    My Lord broke out: \"There may be no harm done. Leave the boy alone.\" She  looked a little red, and pressed the lad's hand as she dropped it.    \"There is no use, my Lord,\" she said. \"Frank was on his knee as he was  making pictures and was running constantly from Harry to me. The evil is  done, if any.\"    \"Not with me,\" cried my Lord. \"I've been smoking.\" And he lighted his  pipe again with a coal. \"As the disease is in the village--plague take  it!--I would have you leave it. We'll go to-morrow to Walcote.\"    \"I have no fear,\" said my Lady. \"I may have had it as an infant.\"    \"I won't run the risk,\" said my Lord. \"I'm as bold as any man, but I'll  not bear that.\"    \"Take Beatrix with you and go,\" said my Lady. \"For us the mischief is  done.\"    My Lord, calling away Doctor Tusher, bade him come in the oak parlor and  have a pipe.    When the lady and the boy were alone, there was a silence of some  moments, during which he stood looking at the fire whilst her Ladyship  busied herself with the [v]tambour frame and needles.    \"I am sorry,\" she said, after a pause, in a hard, dry voice--\"I repeat I  am sorry that I said what I said. It was not at all my wish that you  should leave us, I am sure, unless you found pleasure elsewhere. But you  must see that, at your age, and with your tastes, it is impossible that  you can continue to stay upon the intimate footing in which you have  been in this family. You have wished to go to college, and I think 'tis  quite as well that you should be sent thither. I did not press the  matter, thinking you a child, as you are indeed in years--quite a child.  But now I shall beg my Lord to despatch you as quick as possible; and  will go on with Frank's learning as well as I can. And--and I wish you a  good night, Harry.\"    With this she dropped a stately curtsy, and, taking her candle, went  away through the tapestry door, which led to her apartments. Esmond  stood by the fireplace, blankly staring after her. Indeed, he scarce  seemed to see until she was gone, and then her image was impressed upon  him and remained forever fixed upon his memory. He saw her retreating,  the taper lighting up her marble face, her scarlet lip quivering, and  her shining golden hair. He went to his own room and to bed, but could  not get to sleep until daylight, and woke with a violent headache.    He had brought the contagion with him from the alehouse, sure enough,  and was presently laid up with the smallpox, which spared the hall no  more than it did the cottage.    When Harry Esmond had passed through the [v]crisis of the [v]malady and  returned to health again, he found that little Frank Esmond had also  suffered and rallied from the disease, and that his mother was down  with it. Nor could young Esmond agree in Doctor Tusher's [v]vehement  protestations to my Lady, when he visited her during her  [v]convalescence, that the malady had not in the least impaired her  charms; whereas, in spite of these fine speeches, Harry thought that her  Ladyship's beauty was very much injured by the smallpox. The delicacy of  her rosy complexion was gone; her eyes had lost their brilliancy, her  hair fell, and she looked older. When Tusher in his courtly way vowed  and protested that my Lady's face was none the worse, the lad broke out  and said, \"It is worse, and my mistress is not near so handsome as she  was.\" On this poor Lady Castlewood gave a [v]rueful smile and a look  into a little mirror she had, which showed her, I suppose, that what the  stupid boy said was only too true, for she turned away from the glass  and her eyes filled with tears.    The sight of these always created a sort of rage of pity in Esmond's  heart, and seeing them on the face of the lady whom he loved best, the  young blunderer sank down on his knees and besought her to pardon him,  saying that he was a fool and an idiot. Doctor Tusher told him that he  was a bear, and a bear he would remain, at which speech poor Harry was  so dumb-stricken that he did not even growl.    \"He is my bear, and I will not have him baited, doctor,\" said my Lady,  putting her hand kindly on the boy's head, as he was still kneeling at  her feet. \"How your hair has come off! And mine, too!\" she added with  another sigh.    \"It is not for myself that I care,\" my Lady said to Harry, when the  parson had taken his leave; \"but am I very much changed! Alas! I fear  'tis too true.\"    \"Madam, you have the dearest, and kindest, and sweetest face in the  world, I think,\" the lad said; and indeed he thought so.    For Harry Esmond his benefactress' sweet face had lost none of its  charms. It had always the kindest of looks and smiles for him--and  beauty of every sort. She would call him \"Mr. Tutor,\" and she herself,  as well as the two children, went to school to him. Of the pupils the  two young people were but lazy scholars, and my Lord's son only learned  what he liked, which was but little. Mistress Beatrix chattered French  prettily, and sang sweetly, but this from her mother's teaching, not  Harry Esmond's. But if the children were careless, 'twas a wonder how  eagerly the mother learned from her young tutor--and taught him, too.  She saw the [v]latent beauties and hidden graces in books; and the  happiest hours of young Esmond's life were those passed in the company  of this kind mistress and her children.    These happy days were to end soon, however; and it was by Lady  Castlewood's own decree that they were brought to a conclusion. It  happened about Christmas-tide, Harry Esmond being now past sixteen  years of age. A messenger came from Winchester one day, bearer of the  news that my Lady's aunt was dead and had left her fortune of L2,000  among her six nieces. Many a time afterward Harry Esmond recalled the  flushed face and eager look wherewith, after this intelligence, his kind  lady regarded him. When my Lord heard of the news, he did not make any  long face. \"The money will come very handy to furnish the music-room and  the [v]cellar,\" he said, \"which is getting low, and buy your Ladyship a  coach and a couple of horses. Beatrix, you shall have a [v]spinet; and  Frank, you shall have a little horse from Hexton fair; and Harry, you  shall have five pounds to buy some books.\" So spoke my Lord, who was  generous with his own, and indeed with other folks' money. \"I "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/19723"],[0,"The Cliff Ruins of Canyon de Chelly, Arizona (#16)"],[1," for modern Navaho burials, and  perhaps some of them were constructed for that purpose. If these rooms  were used as habitations, it must have been under very peculiar  circumstances; moreover, the site is hardly suited for such a purpose,  having the sunshine less than half of the day. In this respect it is  anomalous.    At the southern end of the ledge there is a large angular bowlder, one  edge of which rests against the cliff wall and is free from the ground.  Under this the walls of a small room can be seen. The cliff formed one  side of the room and the bowlder acted as a roof. On the extreme  northern end of the ledge, 200 feet distant from the nearest room, there  are remains of a structure standing alone. The masonry is much rougher  than that of the other rooms, and, although the walls are now about  6 feet high, there is no evidence of any doorway or opening into the  room.    On the surface of the sloping rock, at this point nearly flat, there are  traces of a circular kiva 18 or 20 feet in diameter. These traces occur  at a point about midway between the southern and northern ends of the  lower ledge and some 30 feet below it. The cliff walls, both of the  lower and upper ledges, are covered with pictographs in white, red, and  yellow.      [Illustration: Fig. 30--Ruin on an almost inaccessible site.]    The location and character of this site and the character of the remains  suggest that most if not all of the rooms which can now be traced were  used for storage only. For this purpose the site is well adapted. But  the remains of the circular kiva at the foot of the lower ledge show  plainly that there were at one time some habitations here. Doubtless  these were located on the smooth rock at the foot of the cliff, and the  disappearance of all traces of walls may be due to the subsequent use of  the material by the Navaho for the construction of burial cists, in  which the site abounds. There still remains on the ground a fair amount  of broken stone, suitable for building, but no lines of wall are now  traceable.    Figure 30 shows one of the most inaccessible sites in the canyon. It  occurs at the point marked 62 on the map, where there is a narrow ledge  nearly 400 feet above the stream. The approach is over bare rock,  sharply sloping, but passable at two points by an active man accustomed  to climbing. Both of these points are near the western or left-hand end  of the ruin; toward the right the rock becomes vertical. Immediately  below this ruin there are the remains of a large settlement on a low  spur near the stream, now much obliterated, and above and below it on  suitable sites there were a number of small settlements which may have  been connected with it.      [Illustration: Fig. 31--Ground plan of a large ruin in Canyon del    Muerto.]    There were a number of rooms scattered along the ledge which appear to  have been used as habitations. The overhanging cliff is so close that in  a number of cases it formed the roof of the room, and the whole site was  an inconvenient and dangerous one. The rooms on the east rest on a large  block which has split off from the wall since the walls were built, and  now hangs apparently ready to drop at any moment.    At the time this site was inhabited access was had over the smooth  rounded rock on the west. Here hand and foot holes have been pecked in  the steep places, but as the rock is much exposed to atmospheric erosion  these holes are now almost obliterated. After ascending the rock the  village was entered through a doorway in a wall of exceptional  thickness, shown on the left of the drawing. The room which was entered  through this doorway appears to have been placed at this point to  command the entrance to the village. The wall is exceptionally heavy and  was pierced with oblique loopholes commanding a narrow bench immediately  in front of it. This appears to have been a purely defensive expedient,  and as such is unique.    The site commands an extensive outlook over the canyon bottom, including  several areas of cultivable land, and while it may have been occupied as  a regular village, such occupancy could not have been long continued.  Altogether the site and the character of the house remains are anomalous  and doubtless resulted from anomalous conditions.      [Illustration: Fig. 32--Ground plan of a small ruin in Canyon del    Muerto.]    Figure 31 is a ground plan of a large ruin in Del Muerto. It occupied  almost the whole available area of the ledge on which it is situated,  and over 40 rooms can now be made out on the ground, in addition to 3  circular kivas. The settlement may have comprised between 80 and 100  rooms, which would accommodate 15 to 20 families. The size is very  unusual, and the presence of but 3 kivas would indicate that the  families were closely related. There are other examples of this  character in the canyons, but not so large as the one illustrated.      [Illustration: Fig. 33--Ground plan of a small ruin.]    Figure 32 illustrates a type which is more common. Here we have the  usual arrangement of rooms along the cliff, with a kiva in front of  them. There were altogether not over 10 or 12 rooms, and they were  probably occupied by one family. Figure 33 shows a kind rather more  abundant than the last, and consisting like it of one circular kiva with  rooms back of and between it and the cliff. Ruins of this type are  generally well protected by an overhanging cliff. Figure 34 is another  example, in which only three rectangular rooms can be made out. The site  here is almost covered with large bowlders. All these examples occur in  Del Muerto.      [Illustration: Fig. 34--Plan of a ruin of three rooms.]      [Illustration: Fig. 35--Ground plan of a small ruin, with two kivas.]    Figure 35 is a ground plan of a small ruin which occurs at the point  marked 36 on the map. It is situated in a shallow cove at the head of  the talus, 200 or 300 feet above the bottom, and is of comparatively  easy access. There is but a small amount of cultivable bottom land  immediately below it, but it commands extensive areas on the opposite  site of the canyon and in the lower part of a branch on that side. There  are but few remains of rooms other than parts of two kivas, but there is  no question that there was at one time a considerable number here. Both  kivas had interior benches, and were of small size, plastered in the  interior. The masonry is fair to good. On the highest point of the  bowlder shown on the right of the plan there is a fragment of compacted  sheep dung and soil, which is now 6 feet above the ground. It is all  that remains of a layer of some thickness which must have been deposited  when the surface was filled up to or nearly to the top of the rock.  Possibly there was a wall outside and only the intermediate space was  filled.      [Illustration: Fig. 36--Ground plan of a small ruin, No. 44.]      [Illustration: Fig. 37--Ground plan of a ruin on a rocky site.]    Figure 36 is the ground plan of a somewhat similar ruin which occurs at  the point marked 44 on the map. It is situated on the top of the talus,  against the cliff, and commands a fine outlook over the cultivable lands  in the cove below it and on the canyon bottom proper. There are but few  wall remains, but two kivas can still be made out. There is no ledge  here, and the walls were built on loose debris of rocks and talus. The  builders had some trouble in holding the walls in place, and only partly  succeeded in doing so. About one-half of the principal kiva is standing,  showing masonry composed of exceptionally large stones, roughly chinked.  The other, or western kiva, was similarly constructed, and both had  interior benches. The front of the western kiva fell out, the builders  being unable to tie it or to hold it in place on its loose foundation,  and other walls were constructed inside of it, as shown on the plan.  There were other walls outside the main kiva, apparently rectangular  inclosing walls. This example is interesting because the masonry was  constructed on a foundation of loose debris, not on bed rock, and the  knowledge possessed by the builders was not sufficient to enable them to  overcome the natural difficulties of the site. Although ultimately the  village had to be abandoned as a failure, it was certainly occupied for  some years, and this occupancy suggests that there was some strong  objection to the lower part of the canyon. It illustrates, moreover, the  importance which was attached to a command or outlook over extensive  cultivable areas, as to obtain such an outlook the builders were content  to occupy even such an unsuitable site as the one described.    Figure 37 shows a small ruin similar to those described, but located on  a site almost covered with large bowlders. The principal structure now  remaining is a circular kiva, which, contrary to the usual plan, was  placed close up against the cliff; possibly the cliff formed part of the  back wall. Large bowlders so closely hemmed in the structure that there  was neither space nor necessity for an inclosing wall. The kiva was  benched for about half of its circumference.    Under the large bowlder to the right of the kiva a complete room had  been built, with a doorway of the usual type through the front wall.  Scattered remnants of other walls may be seen here and there, but none  show well-defined rooms. Petroglyphs are quite numerous, and one small  bowlder to the left of and next to the kiva is covered with cups, dots,  and carvings. It is shown in figure 38.      [Illustration: Fig. 38--Rock with cups and petroglyphs]    Figure 39 shows a ruin where the site was not so restricted. One  well-defined room and two kivas still remain, and there are traces of  other chambers. The main kiva formed part of a compact little group of  rooms, of which it occupied the front, and appears to have been inclosed  by a curved wall of rough construction. A "]]]
