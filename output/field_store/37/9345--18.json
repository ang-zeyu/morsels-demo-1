De la Chapelle, the manufacturer, states that he has already sold  $150,000 worth of the chimneys. The toughened chimneys are about 60  per cent dearer than those of ordinary glass. The factory is in  Delavan street, Brooklyn, N.Y.           *       *       *       *       *          ALEXANDER BAIN, ELECTRICIAN.      This ingenious man, whose inventions in connection with the electric  telegraph entitle his name to be held in grateful remembrance, died in  January last at the new Home for Incurables at Broomhill,  Kirkintilloch, near Glasgow, Scotland, and on Saturday his remains  were interred in the burying ground in the neighborhood of that town  known as the Old Aisle Cemetery. Mr. Bain, who was about sixty-six  years of age, was a native of Thurso. He was the inventor of the  electro-chemical printing telegraph, the electro-magnetic clock, and  of perforated paper for automatic transmission of messages, and was  author of a number of books and pamphlets relating to these subjects.  Sir William Thomson, in his address to the Mathematical Section of the  British Association at its meeting in Glasgow last year, said: \"In the  United States Telegraphic Department of the Great Exhibition at  Philadelphia, I saw Edison's automatic telegraph delivering 1,015  words in 57 seconds. This was done by the long neglected  electro-chemical method of Bain, long ago condemned in England to the  helot work of recording from a relay, and turned adrift as needlessly  delicate for that.\" Mr. Bain was stricken by paralysis, and suffered  from complete loss of power in the lower limbs. For some time he had  received a pension from the government, obtained for him, we believe,  through the instrumentality of Sir William Thomson. Mr. Bain was a  widower, and has left a son and daughter, the former of whom is in  America, and the latter at present on the Continent. Photographs of  him by Mayall were recently presented to the Society of Telegraph  Engineers and the American Society of Telegraphers at Philadelphia.  --_The Engineer._           *       *       *       *       *          SELF-RELIANCE NECESSARY TO SUCCESS.      Self-reliance, conjoined with promptitude in the execution of our  undertakings, is indispensable to success. And yet multitudes live a  life of vacillation and consequent failure, because they remain  undetermined what to do, or, having decided that, have no confidence  in themselves. Such persons need to be assured; but this assurance can  be obtained in no other way than by their own successes in whatever  they may attempt for themselves. If they lean upon others, they not  only become dissatisfied with what they achieve, but the success of  one achievement, in which they are entitled to but partial credit, is  no guaranty to them that, unaided, they will not fail in their very  next experiment.    For want of self-reliance and decision of character, thousands are  submerged in their first essays to make the voyage of life.  Disappointed and chagrined at this, they underestimate their own  capacities, and thenceforward, relying on others, they take and keep a  subordinate position, from which they rise, when they rise at all,  with the utmost difficulty. When a young man attains his majority, it  is better for him, as a general rule, to take some independent  position of his own, even though the present remuneration be less than  he would obtain in the service of others. When at work for himself, in  a business which requires and demands foresight, economy, and  industry, he will naturally develop the strong points of his  character, and become self-reliant.    A glance at the business men of any community will show who have and  who have not improved the opportunities of their earlier years. The  former transact their business with ease, promptitude, and profit.  They rely upon themselves, and execute what they have to do with  energy and dispatch. But those who shirked everything in their youth  are compelled to rely on their clerks and salesmen for advice, and are  never ready to act when occasions of profit arise. Many parents commit  a lamentable error in this respect. They lead their children to  believe that they can do nothing without the constant assistance of  their superiors, and after awhile the child becomes impressed with  that idea. Fortunate will it be for him when he emerges from the  parental roof, if he can at once acquire the self-reliance which has  been kept down at home--otherwise he must necessarily fail in whatever  independent enterprise he undertakes; and in such a case, while the  misfortune is his own, the fault lies at the door of misjudging  parents rather than at his own.           *       *       *       *       *          SOMETHING TO DO.      It is an old trick of despots, and a good one, to employ their  subjects. Why? To keep them out of mischief, Employed men are most  contented. There is no conspiracy. Men do not sit down and coolly  proceed to concoct iniquity so long as there is plenty of pleasant and  profitable employment for body and mind. Work drives off discontent,  provided there is compensation in proportion to the amount of labor  performed. There must be a stimulant. God never intended a man should  sweat without eating of the fruits of his labor--reaping a  reward--more than he intended the idle man should revel in plenty and  grow gouty on luxuries. Industry is a great peacemaker--a  mind-your-own-business citizen. Something to do renders the despairing  good-natured and hopeful--stops the cry of the hungry, and promotes  all virtue. The best men are the most industrious; the most wealthy  work the hardest. They always find something to do. Do you ever wonder  that men of wealth do not \"retire\" and enjoy their substance? We know  some young men look forward with anticipation to the time of  \"retiring.\" It is doubtful if a man should ever retire from business  as long as he lives. We think we know men who, were they to abandon  business, would be ruined, not pecuniarily, but mentally--their lives  would be shortened. God never intended man's mind should become  dormant. It is governed by fixed laws. Those laws are imperative in  their exactions.    Something to do! \"Oh, if I had something to do!\" There are young men  who sigh for it, yet one thing they can do--that is, seek for a job.  Once found, provided it is an honest one, do not hesitate to perform  it, even if it does not pay as well as you expected.           *       *       *       *       *      MONEYED MEN.    The Cleveland _Herald_ said, twenty years ago, during a stringency of  the times, that moneyed men are the veriest cravens on earth: so  timid, that on the least alarm they pull their heads, turtle-like,  within their shells, and, snugly housed, hug their glittering treasure  until all fear is removed. The consequence is that a few days'  disturbance of the monetary atmosphere brings on a perfect dearth of  not only the precious metals, but even of paper money, their  representative. Moneyed men never adopt the tactics of mutual support;  hence, as soon as a shot is fired into the flock, they scatter, each  looking out for himself, each distrustful of the other, and each  recognizing only the great law of selfishness, which is to take care  of number one. Courage has saved many an army, even when ammunition  was low; and many a foe has been scattered by one yell of defiance  when there was not a cartridge left.           *       *       *       *       *          NEW BOOKS AND PUBLICATIONS.      ARCHOLOGY, OR THE SCIENCE OF GOVERNMENT. By S.V. Blakeslee. Price  $1.25. New York and San Francisco: A. Roman & Co.        This book is a very metaphysical treatise on theories of      government and the duties of citizens to the law, each other,      and themselves. Theoretical politics are little in favor with      thinking men of this day; and the social difficulties of our age      will have to be solved by practical wisdom founded on      experience. The people that knows that a certain course of      legislation has destroyed an empire, and that a contrary policy      has developed one, will care little as to whether or not \"the      will controls the feelings by mediate and indirect force.\" We      are unable to find in this book any attempt to apply the finely      worded theories stated to practical use and popular instruction      in political science.      GRAPHICAL ANALYSIS OF ROOF TRUSSES, FOR THE USE OF ENGINEERS,  ARCHITECTS, AND BUILDERS. By Charles E. Greene, A.M., Professor of  Civil Engineering in the University of Michigan. Chicago, Ill: George  H. Frost.        The author of this work truly says that any designer who fairly      tries the graphical method will be pleased with the simplicity      and directness of the analysis, even for apparently complex      forms. The hindrance to the general use of the method is the      want of knowledge of the higher mathematics, which are largely      used in most treatises on the subject. Professor Greene has      avoided this stumbling block, and given us a treatise which may      be understood and appreciated by any one of common school      education. We therefore give his work a hearty commendation, and      we hope that every carpenter and builder may be induced to      analyze the stresses which affect the different parts of      structures, which he can readily do by carefully reading this      volume.

It cannot be said that this mass of niches and arcading at the west end  is either ingenious or successful. Arcading is a very beautiful  decoration where it is employed, as in a triforium, in single storeys,  to cover a definite even space. But where it is used to fill up an  irregularly-shaped mass of wall which there is no need to decorate, it  looks incoherent and confused. Had the wall been left bare it would have  afforded an excellent contrast to the elaborate pattern of the central  window. As it is, this decoration seems to be conceived in a spirit, of  which there are further evidences in the decoration of the west front of  the east end--the spirit of a builder determined to display the  magnificence of his resources even at the expense of symmetry and  refinement. This is a weakness that might be expected in the designer of  a London hotel, but not in a great mediaeval architect.    The nave was fitted with benches, seats, and a very mean-looking organ,  in 1863. It is lit by gas jets round the capitals of the piers.    The tombs of the nave are described in a general account of the  monuments of the church.    The present pavement dates from 1731. It was laid down according to the  design of William Kent, under the direction of Lord Burlington, the  amateur architect of Burlington House. The stone was given by Sir Edward  Gascoigne from Huddlestone. Some of the gravestones were also used for  the work. The work cost L2500, which was collected by subscription. The  pavement, though inoffensive, is not in keeping with the rest of the  church.    #The Transepts.#--The minster is generally entered by the door at the  south end of the south transept, and this is perhaps an advantage, as it  introduces the visitor at once to the finest view of the interior and  one of the finest architectural views in the world.    Mr Fergusson has called the \"lantern\" the weak point in the system of  Gothic, or rather of English Gothic, architecture (for in French  churches there is usually no lantern), and there is something to be said  for his view.    The climax of a domical church is obviously the dome. That is the centre  and dominating feature of the whole design, and all the lines of the  building should lead up to it. But in a Gothic interior the climax is at  the east end. In the Middle Ages the high altar, blazing with jewels,  plate, and costly embroidery, naturally drew all eyes to it. From the  west end, therefore, the altar as a point of attraction was without a  rival. But, as the visitor drew near to the transepts, the lantern, if  it existed, suddenly discovered itself and distracted his attention from  the altar. And when seen directly from below it had not the overpowering  impressiveness of the dome. It was apt to be too narrow and dimly lit,  too much disconnected from the system of the whole building to produce  an overpowering and harmonious effect. But at York, when the minster is  entered by the south transept, the east end is not seen at all, and the  lantern, with all its height and vastness, is seen at once. Even as  viewed from the west end, the choir is shut off from the rest of the  church by a heavy screen, and the view eastward is broken and  ineffective. But those very qualities of the interior which lessen the  beauties of the nave increase the grandeur of the transept view. The  great width of the church has enabled the lantern to be so large as  almost to give it the effect of a dome. And the opening of the lantern  is so lofty, 180 feet indeed from the floor to the vault, as to lessen  the appearance of emptiness that might otherwise result from the great  width of the transepts. The dimensions of this part of the church are  all enormous, and only comparable to those of the dome and transepts of  St. Paul's. The length of the transepts, each of them four bays long, is  223 feet from north to south, in itself the length of a large church;  their width is 93 feet, the height to the summit of the roof, 99 feet,  and to the top of the lantern, 180 feet.    The transepts, therefore, are unusually prominent, even for an English  cathedral, and they have many other unusual features. Taken in  conjunction with the lantern, they produce an effect to be found in no  other Gothic church in the world. In England there are none so wide and  so lofty. In France there are interiors even loftier, but in France the  transepts are seldom a prominent feature of the design. Often they do  not project beyond the outer wall of the aisles of the nave, and oftener  still there is no central tower large enough to allow of a lantern at  all. It is a great piece of good fortune, also, that the five vast  lancets of the north transept end, known as the five sisters, still keep  their beautiful original glass. If we look at these windows and consider  how utterly ineffective they would be if they were glazed with plain  glass, we can understand how little remains of the original beauty of  the interior of Salisbury.    When these transepts were planned, the minster had a Norman nave and  choir, far narrower and smaller in every way than the present nave and  choir. There is no doubt that the transepts were begun with the  intention of rebuilding the whole church. At that time it was not among  the largest of English cathedrals, and the aspiring and ambitious  archbishops naturally desired to have a cathedral worthy of their  position in the church. They therefore planned their transepts without  any regard for the then existing proportions of the rest of the  building, but as it was impossible to rebuild the whole minster at once,  they found it necessary to fit their new transepts on to the older and  smaller nave and choir, and afterwards to fit their new and larger nave  and choir to these transepts. This necessity accounts for and explains  many of the peculiarities of the transepts.    There is one peculiarity in particular, the arrangement of the bays  nearest to the piers supporting the lantern, which must strike every  observant visitor at once, and the explanation of which was only  discovered by the patient and penetrating investigations of Professor  Willis.    For the purpose of explaining this peculiarity of arrangement, the two  bays of the west side of the south transept nearest the south-west pier  supporting the lantern may be taken as an example.    It will be seen that their arrangement is most irregular--in fact, they  can hardly be called bays at all. For instance, the main arch nearest to  the pier is much wider than the main arch next to it, and this latter is  filled with masonry. It will be noticed, also, that the pier between the  two arches is Decorated in style, and not Early English, like the rest  of the transept. Further, the triforium and clerestory do not accord in  their division with the main arches. There is no triforium, but merely a  blank space of wall with a small ornamental opening, next to the pier of  the lantern; and this blank wall only covers a small part of the space  over the arch below it. Near to the centre of that arch is a vaulting  shaft, and south of it a full-sized division of the triforium, with a  full-sized division of the clerestory above it, and the division fills  the space above both the remaining half of the first arch and the whole  of the smaller second arch. It is as if the _strata_ of the building had  been broken by a violent change, and this is exactly what happened. As  has been said, the old Norman nave and choir had much narrower aisles  than the present nave and choir; consequently, the bays of the transept  nearest to the piers of the lantern were narrower than the other bays,  so that their main arches might be exactly of the same size as the  arches of the Norman aisles which at that point joined on to them. But  when the far wider aisles of the present nave and choir were built these  narrower arches did not fit them, and their outside piers blocked up the  centre of the new aisles. The builders of the nave therefore determined  to remove these piers and to alter the whole scheme of the arches, so as  to make them fit the new aisles. By an extraordinary and daring feat of  engineering skill, they were able to do so without disturbing the  triforium and clerestory above them. This was effected in the following  manner:--The pier in the middle of the new aisle was removed, together  with the whole of the narrow arch which it supported on the one side and  the wider arch which it supported on the other. No doubt, in the  meantime the upper storeys of the two bays were kept from falling by  temporary props. A pier in the Decorated style was then placed so that  the arch above it fitted the arch of the new aisles, and the two  arches--the narrower one nearest the pier of the lantern, and the wider  one beyond it--were made to change places bodily, so that the same space  was occupied by the two together as before, and it did not become  necessary to disturb the rest of the piers. This narrower arch was then  walled up to give support to the lantern. Meanwhile, of course, with  this new arrangement, the upper storeys of the bays did not correspond  with the arches below them. The narrower upper division was now over the  wider lower arch, and _vice versa_. It should be said that the triforium  of the division next to the piers of the lantern was built blank,  because, being so much narrower than the other bays, it would have been  impossible to give it decoration of the same character, and also because  a solid space of blank wall would give better support to the tower. An  account has been given in the history of the building of the minster and  the manner in which the piers of the lantern gradually received their  casings. The daring shown in this alteration of the transepts and the  disregard for continuity of design are very characteristic of the  builders of the period. They"]]]
