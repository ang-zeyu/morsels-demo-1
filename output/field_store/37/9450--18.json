The finest actual portrait of this Queen which we saw  was, at the time of our visit, in the Old Schloss at Berlin, and  showed a mature and lovely woman, every inch a queen. The exquisite  reposing statue, by Rauch, in the Mausoleum at Charlottenburg, over  her grave, is well known by copies.    The life led by the aged Emperor was simple and methodical to the  last. Rising at half-past seven, he breakfasted, looked over his  letters and papers, and was ready by nine or half-past nine to begin  his reception of officials or other callers, which lasted till after  midday. After lunch, he usually drove for an hour or so in the  afternoon, often accompanied by a single aid, bowing right and left to  the populace, who thronged for a look and a smile. His plain military  cloak enveloped him in cold or rainy weather, and his was often one of  the plainest equipages on the brilliant street. \"I do not think,\" said  General Grant, after having visited the Emperor, \"that I ever saw a  more perfect type of a soldier and a man. His Majesty went off into  military affairs. I was anxious to change the subject, as I had no  interest in the technical matters of war. But the Emperor held me to  the one theme, and we spoke of nothing else. I fancied Bismarck  sympathized with me, and would have gladly gone off on other subjects,  but it was of no use. The manner of Bismarck toward the Emperor was  beautiful,--absolute devotion and respect. This was my one long talk  with the Emperor. I should call him the embodiment of courage, candor,  dignity, and simplicity; a strikingly handsome man.\"    Sometimes the Kaiser would hold up to the palace window his eldest  great-grandson, now Crown Prince, then a beautiful child of four or  five years; and the little fellow would go through his military salute  of the passing guard with great gravity and propriety, while the  huzzas of the crowd burst forth with renewed zeal. This child was the  favorite of the aged Emperor, and sometimes took liberties with his  great-grandsire which would hardly have been tolerated from any one  else. If it was touching to see the devotion of the people to their  Emperor, it was no less so to see how he trusted himself with them. He  could remember when, with the revolutionary spirit of 1848, the mob in  the streets of Berlin had so insulted him, a prince, that he had fled  for a time from his country. But that he had forgiven and they had  forgotten long ago. The times had \"changed all that.\" Now he lived  daily in sight of the people, with only a pane of glass for a shield.  He loved his people, and they worshipped him with no temporary  oblations. One of the last occasions in which we saw him in public was  that of the spring manoeuvres in the last May-time of his long life.    Some distance south of the Halle gate, the large and finely situated  \"Tempelhofer Feld\" extends to the suburban village of Tempelhof, which  was once the property of the Knights of Malta, and which still bears  their cross and inscription on its church bells. The intervening  ground has been devoted to the annual parades of the Berlin garrison  for more than a hundred years. It has ample room for evolutions of  infantry, artillery, and cavalry, but a comparatively small space is  devoted to the accommodation of spectators. Only about three hundred  carriages can be admitted, and these are distributed among royal  personages, officials, and a limited number of distinguished or  fortunate visitors. Our application for a carriage place was duly  filed with the chief of the Berlin police a month or six weeks in  advance of the parade, but, after long waiting, word came that there  was no room. By the courtesy and special thoughtfulness of Secretary  Crosby, of the United States Legation, a carriage ticket was placed at  our disposal, after all hope of obtaining the coveted privilege had  been abandoned.    The German Emperor can place, if need be, nearly three million trained  soldiers in the field. All able-bodied Germans are liable to service,  with few exceptions, from the age of twenty to that of thirty-two, and  can in exceptional circumstances be called out up to the age of  forty-two. But the German youth spends only the first three years, of  his twelve of liability, with the colors, the remaining nine being  spent in different branches of the reserve forces. The effective force  in time of peace is about half a million, which is distributed  through the Empire in seventeen army corps, of which the Third has its  headquarters at Berlin. The ordinary strength of an army corps is  about thirty thousand, including infantry, cavalry, and artillery; but  the garrison of Berlin and various extra and unattached troops bring  the number up to fifty thousand or more, stationed mostly in Berlin  and Potsdam. These have their spring manoeuvres at Berlin; and the  special parade, for which every day for two months beforehand seemed  parade-day in the streets of Berlin, was that for which we were so  fortunate as to receive tickets. Nearly every day for a week previous,  his Majesty was to be seen, in his low two-horse carriage, passing  through the Unter den Linden and south through Friedrich Strasse, to  the parade-ground. On this grand and final parade-day the three  hundred carriages of the privileged spectators were in good time on  the ground assigned them, prepared to welcome the Emperor and the  Imperial party as loyally as the soldiers themselves. A deafening  hurrah burst from the throats of all, as his Majesty appeared in a  carriage and drove to his post of observation. Many of his princely  retinue, both ladies and gentlemen, were on horseback; and it was  formerly his custom to review the troops, mounted on his black  war-horse. In spite of a piercing wind which swept over the wide  Brandenburg plains, we hugged our warm wraps, and stood in our  carriages, like all the rest, in eager watchfulness and admiration, as  the evolutions of the most perfectly drilled troops in the world went  forward. The infantry marched and countermarched; plumes of all colors  waved in the sunlight and kept time to the music; uniforms and men  seemed but part of one grand incomprehensible automatic movement;  battle-flags scarred with the history of all the wars fluttered their  tattered shreds in the wind, waking memories of irrepressible pathos  and joy; the artillery rumbled and thundered; the evolutions of the  cavalry were like systematic whirlwinds; and the scarlet Zouaves, the  blue Dragoons, the white-uniformed and gilt-helmeted Cuirassiers, and  the dark Uhlands with lances ten feet long poised in air above their  prancing horses, commingled the \"pomp and circumstance of war\" without  its pain. Now the infantry come on at double quick, in the step with  which they entered Paris; now the artillery is lumbered across a vast  stretch of the field with a rapidity and precision which almost take  away one's breath; and anon the cavalry seem to burst in orderly  confusion upon the scene, flying in competition, across, around,  athwart, until the cheers and huzzas burst forth anew with, \"Hail to  the Kaiser!\" \"Long live the Fatherland!\" It was with joy that the  soldiers received the commendations of their Imperial chieftain on  that field-day, and it was to us a fitting place and moment of  farewell to the great military Emperor.    \"King, the Saxon Konnig,\" says Carlyle,--\"the man who CAN.\" And  Emperor William I. was the man who _could_.           *       *       *       *       *    \"Fritz, dear Fritz,\" were the last words of the aged Emperor. \"Unser  Fritz\" was the well-beloved elder brother of the German people. If any  doubt as to the real feeling among the South-Germans toward the  Imperial house had existed in our minds, it was removed as we  journeyed through Saxony, Bavaria, Wuertemberg, Darmstadt, Thuringia.  Everywhere, in humble homes, in shops, hotels, and market-places, were  the likenesses of the handsome Kaiser and the open, sincere, manly  countenance of the Crown Prince to be seen. In Berlin the Crown Prince  occupied the palace directly east of that of the Kaiser, separated  from it only by the Operahaus Platz. We had heard him called \"the  handsomest man in Europe.\" Our study of his kindly face from  photographs had revealed manliness enough, but nothing more to justify  this epithet. But as one came to be familiar with his look, his  figure, his bearing, there was full assent to his being called, in  appearance, \"the finest gentleman in Europe.\" The titles and tokens of  honor that had been showered upon him, and which he wore so  gracefully, were his least claims to distinction. He was as great in  true nobility of soul as he was exalted in station, as symmetrical in  character as he was regal in bearing. When he mated with the Princess  Royal of England, he was not even Crown Prince of Prussia, and some of  the English papers asserted that the eldest daughter of Queen Victoria  had married beneath her. But this opinion was easily dissipated, as  the years brought, with increasing honors, development of manly  virtues and graces. A hero in the wars in which his country had  engaged before he reached middle life, and with all the courage of his  Hohenzollern blood, he yet delighted in peace, and was a most humane  and liberal statesman. That thirst for liberty which is quenchless in  the human breast, and which has had as yet small satisfaction in  Teutonic lands, seemed to find sympathy in this enlightened Prince. At  the age of thirty he became the heir apparent to the Prussian Crown,  when the new king, his father, had reached the age of sixty-four. When  he was forty, and his father was proclaimed Emperor of Germany at the  age of seventy-four, Frederick became heir to the Imperial throne. A  most careful and liberal education, grafted on a genial and "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/21656"],[0,"The Princess of the School (#16)"],[1,"jest between spasms of pain, and generally found something to laugh at  in the various episodes of their journey. There is a laughter, though,  that is more the expression of supreme courage than of genuine mirth,  and the drawn lines round the Major's mouth told of sleepless nights and  days of little ease, and of trouble that hurts worse even than physical  pain; for one son lay on a Belgian battle-field, another on the heights  near Salonika, with no cross to mark the grave, and a third deep under  the surging waters of the Atlantic.    Mrs. Rogers was Mr. Greville's sister, and for that reason, though she  was no real relation, Carmel called her Aunt Hilda. She had been a belle  in her youth, and she was still pretty with the pathetic beauty that  often shines in the faces of those who have suffered great loss. Her  once flaxen hair was almost entirely gray, but she had kept her delicate  complexion, and there was a gentle sweetness about her that was very  attractive.    Her daughter was an exact replica of what she herself must have been at  nineteen, though Sheila was going through an uncomfortable phase, and  affected to despise the country, to be nervous of motoring, and to long  to be back in town again. She was quite kind to Carmel, but treated her  with the distantly indulgent attitude of the lately-grown-up for the  mere schoolgirl. It was evident that she regarded the whole tour as more  or less of a nuisance, and just a means of killing time until she could  start off for Scotland to join a certain house-party to which she had  been invited, and where she would meet several of her most particular  friends.    \"I'm sorry we couldn't ask one of your cousins to come with you, dear,\"  said Mrs. Rogers to Carmel, \"but there isn't room in the car for any one  else. It's a good opportunity for you to see something of England. It's  all very different from Sicily, isn't it? You'll feel your first winter  trying, I'm afraid; we certainly lack sunshine in this climate.\"    \"Give me Egypt,\" said Major Rogers. \"It's this perpetual damp in the air  that makes things melancholy over here. Why, except in the height of  summer it's hardly ever fit to sit out-of-doors. I like a place where I  need a sun helmet.\"    \"You and Mother are salamanders, Daddy!\" declared Sheila. \"I believe  you'd enjoy living in a hot-house! Now, I like Scotland, with a good  sharp wind across the moors, and a touch of mist in it to cool your  face. I like either town or mountains. If I can't walk down Regent  Street, then I'd tramp over the heather, but I don't admire ordinary  English scenery. It's too tame.\"    \"You surely don't call this tame?\" replied her father, pointing at the  village through which they were motoring, \"it's one of the show bits of  the Midlands, and an absolute picture. Where are your eyes, child?\"    But Sheila was perverse, and refused to evince any enthusiasm, and ended  by pulling out a novel over which she chuckled, quite regardless of the  scenery, and only tore herself from the book to ask for the box of  chocolate marsh mallows that she had bought at the last town where there  was a good confectioner's.    Carmel would certainly have found Dulcie, or even Lilias, a more  congenial companion than Sheila, but she nevertheless managed to enjoy  herself. She loved the country, and was delighted with the variety of  the English landscape. Though less rich than the vineclad south, the  greenness of its fields and hedges never failed to amaze her, and she  was fascinated by the quaint villages, their thatched roofs, church  spires, and flowery gardens. They had been running through  Gloucestershire _en route_ for Somerset and Devon, and were to call a  halt at various show places on the way. Major Rogers, poring over map  and guide books, would plan out their daily route each morning at the  breakfast table in the hotel.    \"With good luck and no punctures we ought to reach Exeter to-night  easily,\" he remarked, looking through the window of an old-fashioned  country inn into the cobbled street where their luggage was being  strapped on to the car.    \"But, my dear!\" remonstrated his wife. \"Why in such a hurry to reach  Exeter? Let us stay the night at Wells, and look over the cathedral;  then we can spend a few hours in Bath too.\"    \"Daddy and Johnson always like to tear along at about a hundred miles an  hour,\" said Sheila. \"Except as a means of getting along the road, I hate  motoring! I always think Johnson is going to run into everybody. He  shaves his corners so narrowly, and doesn't give conveyances enough  room. I call him very reckless.\"    \"Nonsense! He's an excellent driver!\" declared her father. \"One of the  best chauffeurs we've ever had, though he's only a young chap. He's  wonderfully intelligent too. I'd trust him with repairs as well as any  man at a garage. A civil fellow, too.\"    \"Yes, his manners are really quite superior,\" agreed Mrs. Rogers,  stepping on to the balcony and watching the smart, good-looking figure  of the young chauffeur, who was opening the bonnet of the car for some  last inspection. \"Personally I feel perfectly safe when Johnson is  driving me. I'm never nervous in the least!\"    \"And I'm in such a perpetual panic that I often read so as not to look  at the road,\" confessed Sheila. \"I do wish you'd ask him to sound his  horn oftener in these narrow roads. The banks and hedges are so high,  you can't see anything that's coming till it's almost upon you.\"    \"Well, it certainly might be a wise precaution,\" said Major Rogers. \"In  motoring you have to guard against the stupidity of other people, and  that fellow in the gray two-seater nearly charged straight into us  yesterday. A regular road-hog he was!\"    If Johnson had hitherto been a little slack in respect of sounding his  horn, it was the only fault of which his employers could complain. He  kept the fittings of the car at the very zenith in the matter of polish,  he was punctuality personified, and most skilful at the tedious business  of repairing or changing tires; he rarely spoke addressed, but when  questioned he seemed to have a good acquaintance with the country, knew  which were the best roads, and what sights were worth visiting in the  various places through which they passed. All of which are highly  desirable qualities in a chauffeur, and a satisfaction to all  concerned.    It was the general plan of the holiday to start about ten or eleven  o'clock, take a picnic-basket with them, lunch somewhere in the woods,  arrive at their next halting-place about three or four, and spend the  remainder of the day in sight-seeing, or in Major Rogers' case resting,  if he were suffering from a severe attack of pain.    As they motored across Somerset in the direction of Wells, they chose  for their mid-day stop a lovely place on the top of a range of low  hills. A belt of fir trees edged the roadside, and through these a gate  led into a field. As the gate was open they felt licensed to enter, and  to encamp upon a sunny bank under a hedge. One of the motor rugs was  spread for Major Rogers, and Mrs. Rogers, Sheila, and Carmel sat  severally on an air cushion, a tree-stump, and on the grass. There was a  grand view over a slope of cornfields and pastures, and though the sun  was warm there was a delicious little breeze to temper the heat. Not  that it was too hot for any one except Sheila, who panted in the shade  while the others exulted in the sunshine. Carmel, outstretched upon the  grass, basked like a true daughter of the south, throwing aside her hat,  somewhat to Mrs. Rogers' consternation.    \"You'll spoil your complexion, child! I'm sure your mother never allows  you to go hatless in Sicily! Put your handkerchief over your face. Yes,  I like to feel the warmth myself, though not on my head. This is the  sort of holiday that does people good, just to sit in the open air.\"    \"It's a rabbit holiday here,\" murmured the Major lazily. \"Didn't you  read that supreme article in _Punch_ a while ago? Well, it was about a  doctor who invented a drug that could turn his patients into anything  they chose for the holidays. A worried mother of a family lived an  idyllic month at a farm as a hen, with six children as chickens, food  and lodging provided gratis; a portly dowager enjoyed a rest cure as a  Persian cat at a country mansion; some lively young people spent a  fortnight as sea-gulls, while the hero of the article was just about to  be changed into a rabbit when----\"    \"When what happened?\"    \"The usual thing in such stories; the maid broke the precious bottle of  medicine that was to have worked the charm, and when he hunted for the  doctor to buy another, the whole place had disappeared.\"    \"How disappointing!\"    \"Yes, but a field like this, with burrows in it, is a near substitute. I  feel I could live up here. Suppose I buy a shelter and get leave to  erect it?\"    \"Then it would promptly rain, Daddy, and you'd be in the depths of  misery and longing for a decent hotel!\" declared Sheila.    To suit Major Rogers' humor they stayed nearly two hours in the field.  The quiet was just what his doctor had ordered for him. He had spent a  restless night, and, though he could not sleep now, the air and the  sunshine calmed his nerves. He seemed better than he had been for days,  and enjoyed the run downhill into Wells.    As they were stepping out of the motor at the hotel, Carmel gave an  exclamation of concern.    \"I've lost my bracelet!\" she declared. \"What a nuisance! Wherever can it  have gone?\"    Johnson, the chauffeur, immediately searched on the floor and cushions  of the car, but without success. No bracelet was there.    \"When did you have it last?\" asked Mrs. Rogers.    \"In the rabbit field where we had lunch. I remember clasping and  unclasping it, and I suppose it must have slipped off my wrist without  my noticing. Never mind!\"    \"I'm sorry, but it certainly is too far to go back and look "]]]
