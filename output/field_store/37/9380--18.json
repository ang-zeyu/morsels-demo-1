In  case of illness suspicion falls on some one who is supposed to have  buried a charmed object with intent to injure the sufferer.[37] Of the  Melanesians who inhabit the coast of the Gazelle Peninsula in New  Britain it is said that all deaths by sickness or disease are attributed  by them to the witchcraft of a sorcerer, and a diviner is called in to  ascertain the culprit who by his evil magic has destroyed their  friends.[38] \"Amongst the Melanesians few, if any, are believed to die  from natural causes only; if they are not killed in war, they are  supposed to die from the effects of witchcraft or magic. Whenever any  one was sick, his friends made anxious inquiries as to the person who  had bewitched (_agara'd_) him. Some one would generally be found to  admit that he had buried some portion of food or something belonging to  the sick man, which had caused his illness. The friends would pay him to  dig it up, and after that the patient would generally get well. If,  however, he did not recover, it was assumed that some other person had  also _agara'd_ him.\"[39]    [Sidenote: The belief of the Malagasy in sorcery as a cause of death.]    Speaking of the Malagasy a Catholic missionary tells us that in  Madagascar nobody dies a natural death. With the possible exception of  centenarians everybody is supposed to die the victim of the sorcerer's  diabolic art. If a relation of yours dies, the people comfort you by  saying, \"Cursed be the sorcerer who caused his death!\" If your horse  falls down a precipice and breaks its back, the accident has been caused  by the malicious look of a sorcerer. If your dog dies of hydrophobia or  your horse of a carbuncle, the cause is still the same. If you catch a  fever in a district where malaria abounds, the malady is still ascribed  to the art of the sorcerer, who has insinuated some deadly substances  into your body.[40] Again, speaking of the Sakalava, a tribe in  Madagascar, an eminent French authority on the island observes: \"They  have such a faith in the power of talismans that they even ascribe to  them the power of killing their enemies. When they speak of poisoning,  they do not allude, as many Europeans wrongly suppose, to death by  vegetable or mineral poisons; the reference is to charms or spells. They  often throw under the bed of an enemy an _ahouli_ [talisman], praying it  to kill him, and they are persuaded that sooner or later their wish will  be accomplished. I have often been present at bloody vendettas which had  no other origin but this. The Sakalava think that a great part of the  population dies of poison in this way. In their opinion, only old people  who have attained the extreme limits of human longevity die a natural  death.\"[41]    [Sidenote: Belief of African tribes in sorcery as the cause of sickness  and death.]    In Africa similar beliefs are widely spread and lead, as elsewhere, to  fatal consequences. Thus the Kagoro of Northern Nigeria refuse to  believe in death from natural causes; all illnesses and deaths, in their  opinion, are brought about by black magic, however old and decrepit the  deceased may have been. They explain sickness by saying that a man's  soul wanders from his body in sleep and may then be caught, detained,  and even beaten with a stick by some evil-wisher; whenever that happens,  the man naturally falls ill. Sometimes an enemy will abstract the  patient's liver by magic and carry it away to a cave in a sacred grove,  where he will devour it in company with other wicked sorcerers. A  witch-doctor is called in to detect the culprit, and whomever he  denounces is shut up in a room, where a fire is kindled and pepper  thrown into it; and there he is kept in the fumes of the burning pepper  till he confesses his guilt and returns the stolen liver, upon which of  course the sick man recovers. But should the patient die, the miscreant  who did him to death by kidnapping his soul or his liver will be sold as  a slave or choked.[42] In like manner the Bakerewe, who inhabit the  largest island in the Victoria Nyanza lake, believe that all deaths and  all ailments, however trivial, are the effect of witchcraft; and the  person, generally an old woman, whom the witch-doctor accuses of having  cast the spell on the patient is tied up, severely beaten, or stabbed to  death on the spot.[43] Again, we are told that \"the peoples of the Congo  do not believe in a natural death, not even when it happens through  drowning or any other accident. Whoever dies is the victim of witchcraft  or of a spell. His soul has been eaten. He must be avenged by the  punishment of the person who has committed the crime.\" Accordingly when  a death has taken place, the medicine-man is sent for to discover the  criminal. He pretends to be possessed by a spirit and in this state he  names the wretch who has caused the death by sorcery. The accused has to  submit to the poison ordeal by drinking a decoction of the red bark of  the _Erythrophloeum guiniense_. If he vomits up the poison, he is  innocent; but if he fails to do so, the infuriated crowd rushes on him  and despatches him with knives and clubs. The family of the supposed  culprit has moreover to pay an indemnity to the family of the supposed  victim.[44] \"Death, in the opinion of the natives, is never due to a  natural cause. It is always the result either of a crime or of sorcery,  and is followed by the poison ordeal, which has to be undergone by an  innocent person whom the fetish-man accuses from selfish motives.\"[45]    [Sidenote: Effect of such beliefs in thinning the population by causing  multitudes to die for the imaginary crime of sorcery.]    Evidence of the same sort could be multiplied for West Africa, where the  fear of sorcery is rampant.[46] But without going into further details,  I wish to point out the disastrous effects which here, as elsewhere,  this theory of death has produced upon the population. For when a death  from natural causes takes place, the author of the death being of course  unknown, suspicion often falls on a number of people, all of whom are  obliged to submit to the poison ordeal in order to prove their  innocence, with the result that some or possibly all of them perish. A  very experienced American missionary in West Africa, the Rev. R. H.  Nassau, the friend of the late Miss Mary H. Kingsley, tells us that for  every person who dies a natural death at least one, and often ten or  more have been executed on an accusation of witchcraft.[47] Andrew  Battel, a native of Essex, who lived in Angola for many years at the end  of the sixteenth and beginning of the seventeenth century, informs us  that \"in this country none on any account dieth, but they kill another  for him: for they believe they die not their own natural death, but that  some other has bewitched them to death. And all those are brought in by  the friends of the dead whom they suspect; so that there many times come  five hundred men and women to take the drink, made of the foresaid root  _imbando_. They are brought all to the high-street or market-place, and  there the master of the _imbando_ sits with his water, and gives every  one a cup of water by one measure; and they are commanded to walk in a  certain place till they make water, and then they are free. But he that  cannot urine presently falls down, and all the people, great and small,  fall upon him with their knives, and beat and cut him into pieces. But I  think the witch that gives the water is partial, and gives to him whose  death is desired the strongest water, but no man of the bye-standers can  perceive it. This is done in the town of Longo, almost every week  throughout the year.\"[48] A French official tells us that among the  Neyaux of the Ivory Coast similar beliefs and practices were visibly  depopulating the country, every single natural death causing the death  of four or five persons by the poison ordeal, which consisted in  drinking the decoction of a red bark called by the natives _boduru_. At  the death of a chief fifteen men and women perished in this way. The  French Government had great difficulty in suppressing the ordeal; for  the deluded natives firmly believed in the justice of the test and  therefore submitted to it willingly in the full consciousness of their  innocence.[49] In the neighbourhood of Calabar the poison ordeal, which  here consists in drinking a decoction of a certain bean, the  _Physostigma venenosum_ of botanists, has had similar disastrous  results, as we learn from the testimony of a missionary, the Rev. Hugh  Goldie. He tells us that the people have firm faith in the ordeal and  therefore not only accept it readily but appeal to it, convinced that it  will demonstrate their innocence. A small tribe named Uwet in the  hill-country of Calabar almost swept itself off the face of the earth by  its constant use of the ordeal. On one occasion the whole population  drank the poison to prove themselves pure, as they said; about half  perished, \"and the remnant,\" says Mr. Goldie, \"still continuing their  superstitious practice, must soon become extinct\"[50] These words were  written a good many years ago, and it is probable that by this time  these poor fanatics have actually succeeded in exterminating themselves.  So fatal may be the practical consequences of a purely speculative  error; for it is to be remembered that these disasters flow directly  from a mistaken theory of death.    [Sidenote: General conclusion as to the belief in sorcery as the great  cause of death.]    Much more evidence of the same kind could be adduced, but without  pursuing the theme further I think we may lay it down as a general rule  that at a certain stage of social and intellectual evolution men have  believed themselves to be naturally immortal in this life "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/20153"],[0,"The American Journal of Archaeology, 1893-1 (#16)"],[1,"           VIa    Vb      IV   IV¹ V¹b VI¹b             and by their correspondence to VII: VII¹.             On the left side we have next a group, turned toward the right,           consisting of a young satyr with flowing panther-skin (Vb), who           places his left knee on the back of a prostrate pirate (Va)           whom he is about to strike with a club which he holds in his           uplifted right hand. The pirate (face now somewhat damaged) is,           like all of his fellows, youthful and nude. The corresponding           group on the right, faces the left, and represents a nude           bearded satyr (V¹,) with left knee on the hip of a fallen           pirate (V¹a), whose hands he is about to bind behind his           back. Thus the arrangement of the two groups corresponds, but           the action is somewhat different.             I now wish to point out an error which is interesting and           instructive as illustrating how mistakes creep into standard           archæological literature to the detriment of a proper           appreciation of the original monuments; and I may perhaps hope           not only to correct this error once for all, but also, in so           doing, to make clearer certain noteworthy artistic qualities of           this composition.             If we turn to the reproductions of the Lysikrates frieze in the           common manuals of Greek sculpture, we find that the group           (V¹) has exchanged places with the next group to the right           (VI¹) while the corresponding groups on the left side (V,           VI) retain their proper position. In order to detect the source           of this confusion, we have only to examine the drawings of           Stuart and Revett, from which nearly all the subsequent  Page 49  illustrations are more or less directly derived. In the first           volume of Stuart and Revett, the groups (V¹, IV¹) occupy           plates XIII and XIV, and it is evident that the drawings have           been in some way misplaced. These plates have been reproduced           on a reduced scale in Meyer's _Gesch. d. bildenden Künste[92]_           (1825); Müller-Wieseler[93] (1854); Overbeck,[94] _Plastik³_           (1882); W.C. Perry, _History of Greek Sculpture[95]_ (1882);           Mrs. L.M. Mitchell, _History of Ancient Sculpture;[96]_           Baumeister, _Denkmäler[97]_ (1887); Harrison and Verrall,           _Andent Athens[98]_ (1890), and in all with the same           misarrangement.             Nevertheless correct reproductions of the frieze, derived from           other sources, have not been wholly lacking. There is, for           example, a drawing of the whole monument by S. Pomardi in           Dodwell's _Tour through Greece[99]_ (1819), in which the           correct position of these groups is clearly indicated. In 1842           appeared volume IX of the _British Museum Marbles_ containing           engravings of a cast made by direction of Lord Elgin, about           1800.[100] Inasmuch as this cast or similar copies have always           been the chief sources for the study of the relief, owing to           the unsatisfactory preservation of the original, it is the more           strange that this mistake should have remained so long           uncorrected,[101] or that Müller-Wieseler should imply[102]           that their engraving was corrected from the British Museum           publication, when no trace of such correction is to be found. A           third drawing in which the true arrangement is shown, is the           engraving after Hansen's restoration of the whole monument,           published in Von Lützow's monograph[103] (1868). Although           Stuart's arrangement violates the symmetry maintained between           the other groups of the frieze, yet Overbeck[104] especially           commends the symmetry shown in the composition of these           portions of the relief.             [Footnote 92: _Tajel_ 25.]             [Footnote 96: I _Taf._ 37.]             [Footnote 94: II, p. 91.]             [Footnote 95: P. 474.]             [Footnote 96: P. 487.]             [Footnote 97: II, p. 841.]             [Footnote 98: P. 248.]             [Footnote 99: I, opposite p. 289.]             [Footnote 100: H. MEYER, _Gesch. der bildenden Künste_, II, p.           242. note 313.]             [Footnote 101: Since I first noticed the error from study of           the original monument, it gives me pleasure to observe that Mr.           Murray in his _History of Greek Sculpture_, II, p. 333, note,           has remarked that there is a difference between Stuart's           drawing and the cast, without, however, being able to determine           positively which is correct, owing to lack of means of           verification. He was inclined to agree with the cast.]             [Footnote 102: I, _Taf._, note 150: _Mit Berücksichtigung der           Abbildungen nach später genommenen Gypsabgüssen in Ancient           Marbles in the Brit, Mus._]             [Footnote 103: Between pp. 240 and 241.]             [Footnote 104: Plastik³, II, p. 94.]    Page 50  Now let us examine the symmetry as manifested in the corrected           arrangement. After the figures which we have found to have a           thoroughly symmetrical disposition, we have on the left side a           group consisting of a bearded satyr (face damaged), with           panther-skin (VI a), about to strike with his thyrsus a pirate           kneeling at the left (VI b), with his hands bound behind his           back. The face of this figure is also somewhat injured. The           corresponding group on the right (VI¹ instead of the erroneous           V¹), represents a youthful satyr with panther-skin thrown over           his arm (VI¹ a), about to strike with the club which he holds           in his uplifted right hand, a pirate (VI¹ b), who has been           thrown on his back, and raises his left arm, partly in           supplication and partly to ward off the blow. As in the groups           V: V¹, so in VI: VI¹, persons, action, and arrangement, are           closely symmetrical, while a graceful variety and harmony is           effected by so modifying each of these elements as to repeat           scarcely a detail in the several corresponding figures.             After these five fighters, we observe on the left a powerful           bearded satyr (face much injured), with flowing panther-skin,           facing the right, and wrenching away a branch from a tree           (VII). The corresponding figure on the right side (VII¹) is a           nude, bearded satyr, who is breaking down a branch of a tree.           At first the correspondence does not seem to be maintained, for           this satyr faces the right, whereas after the analogy of           figures VII and IV we might expect him to face the left. But a           closer examination shows that this lack of symmetry is apparent           only when figures VII: VII¹ are considered individually, and           apart from the scenes to which they belong. For while IV and           VII, the outside figures of the main scene on the left,           appropriately face each other, the figures IV¹ and VII¹,           which occupy the same position with regard to the chief scene           on the right, are placed so as to face in opposite directions.           By this subtle device, for which the relation between the           figures III¹ and IV¹ furnishes an evident motive, the           sculptor has contrived to indicate distinctly the limits of           these scenes, while the symmetry existing between them is           heightened and emphasized by the avoidance of rigid uniformity.             The trees serve also to mark the end of the preceding scenes,           and to contrast the land, upon which they stand, with the sea,           of which we behold a portion on either side, while a pair of  Page 51  corresponding, semi-human dolphins (VIII: VIII¹) are just           leaping into the element which is to form their home. These           dolphins are not quite accurately drawn in Stuart and Revett,           for what appears as an under jaw is, as Dodwell[105] rightly           pointed out, a fin, and their mouths are closed; the teeth,           which are seen in Stuart's drawing and all subsequent           reproductions of it, do not exist on the monument. The correct           form of the head may be seen in the British Museum publication.             [Footnote 105: I, p. 290.]             After these dolphins, we have on each side another piece of           land succeeded again by a stretch of sea. On these pieces of           land are seen on each side two groups of two figures each,           while a third incipient dolphin (0¹), which does not stand in           group-relation with any of the other figures, leaps into the           sea between them. In these groups there is a general           correspondence, but it does not extend to particular positions           or to accessories.             At the left we observe first a bearded satyr with torch and           flowing panther-skin (IX a), pursuing a pirate, who flees to           the left (IX b). The space between the satyr and his victim is           in part occupied by a hole, which was probably cut for a beam           at the time when the monument was built into the convent. In           the corresponding places on the right side, we have a bearded           satyr with panther-skin (IX¹ a), about to strike with the           forked club which he holds in his uplifted right hand, a seated           and bound pirate (IX¹ b), whose hair the satyr has clutched           with his left hand. The heads of both figures are considerably           damaged, and the lower part of the right leg of the pirate is           quite effaced. To return to the left side, the tree at the left           of the fleeing pirate (IX b), does"]]]
