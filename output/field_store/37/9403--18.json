These,\" continued she, pointing to  the dwarfs, \"will provide for our wants, for souls so mundane as ours  retain too strong a tincture of their earthly extraction; instead of  meats your food will be nothing but rice, and your bread shall be  moistened in the fogs that brood over the surface of the lake.\"    At this desolating prospect the poor children burst into tears, and  prostrated themselves before the dwarfs, who perfectly supported their  characters, and delivered an excellent discourse of a customary length  upon the sacred camel, which after a thousand years was to convey them to  the paradise of the faithful.    The sermon being ended, and ablutions performed, they praised Allah and  the Prophet, supped very indifferently, and retired to their withered  leaves.  Nouronihar and her little cousin consoled themselves on finding  that, though dead, they yet lay in one cabin.  Having slept well before,  the remainder of the night was spent in conversation on what had befallen  them, and both, from a dread of apparitions, betook themselves for  protection to one another's arms.    In the morning, which was lowering and rainy, the dwarfs mounted high  poles like minarets, and called them to prayers; the whole congregation,  which consisted of Sutlememe, Shaban, the four eunuchs, and some storks,  were already assembled.  The two children came forth from their cabin  with a slow and dejected pace; as their minds were in a tender and  melancholy mood, their devotions were performed with fervour.  No sooner  were they finished, than Gulchenrouz demanded of Sutlememe and the rest,  \"how they happened to die so opportunely for his cousin and himself.\"    \"We killed ourselves,\" returned Sutlememe, \"in despair at your death.\"    On this, said Nouronihar, who, notwithstanding what was past, had not yet  forgotten her vision: \"And the Caliph! is he also dead of his grief? and  will he likewise come hither?\"    The dwarfs, who were prepared with an answer, most demurely replied:  \"Vathek is damned beyond all redemption!\"    \"I readily believe so,\" said Gulchenrouz, \"and I am glad from my heart to  hear it; for I am convinced it was his horrible look that sent us hither  to listen to sermons and mess upon rice.\"    One week passed away on the side of the lake unmarked by any variety;  Nouronihar ruminating on the grandeur of which death had deprived her,  and Gulchenrouz applying to prayers and to panniers, along with the  dwarfs, who infinitely pleased him.    Whilst this scene of innocence was exhibiting in the mountains, the  Caliph presented himself to the Emir in a new light; the instant he  recovered the use of his senses, with a voice that made Bababalouk quake,  he thundered out: \"Perfidious Giaour!  I renounce thee for ever! it is  thou who hast slain my beloved Nouronihar! and I supplicate the pardon of  Mahomet, who would have preserved her to me had I been more wise; let  water be brought to perform my ablutions, and let the pious Fakreddin be  called to offer up his prayers with mine, and reconcile me to him;  afterwards we will go together and visit the sepulchre of the unfortunate  Nouronihar; I am resolved to become a hermit, and consume the residue of  my days on this mountain, in hope of expiating my crimes.\"    Nouronihar was not altogether so content, for though she felt a fondness  for Gulchenrouz, who, to augment the attachment, had been left at full  liberty with her, yet she still regarded him as but a bauble, that bore  no competition with the carbuncle of Giamschid.  At times she indulged  doubts on the mode of her being, and scarcely could believe that the dead  had all the wants and the whims of the living.  To gain satisfaction,  however, on so perplexing a topic, she arose one morning whilst all were  asleep, with a breathless caution, from the side of Gulchenrouz, and,  after having given him a soft kiss, began to follow the windings of the  lake till it terminated with a rock, whose top was accessible, though  lofty; this she clambered up with considerable toil, and having reached  the summit, set forward in a run, like a doe that unwittingly follows her  hunter; though she skipped along with the alertness of an antelope, yet  at intervals she was forced to desist, and rest beneath the tamarisks to  recover her breath.  Whilst she, thus reclined, was occupied with her  little reflections on the apprehension that she had some knowledge of the  place, Vathek, who, finding himself that morning but ill at ease, had  gone forth before the dawn, presented himself on a sudden to her view;  motionless with surprise, he durst not approach the figure before him,  which lay shrouded up in a simar, extended on the ground, trembling and  pale, but yet lovely to behold.  At length Nouronihar, with a mixture of  pleasure and affliction, raising her fine eyes to him, said: \"My lord,  are you come hither to eat rice and hear sermons with me?\"    \"Beloved phantom!\" cried Vathek; \"dost thou speak? hast thou the same  graceful form? the same radiant features? art thou palpable likewise?\"  and, eagerly embracing her, added: \"here are limbs and a bosom animated  with a gentle warmth! what can such a prodigy mean?\"    Nouronihar with diffidence answered: \"You know, my lord, that I died on  the night you honoured me with your visit; my cousin maintains it was  from one of your glances, but I cannot believe him; for to me they seem  not so dreadful.  Gulchenrouz died with me, and we were both brought into  a region of desolation, where we are fed with a wretched diet.  If you be  dead also, and are come hither to join us, I pity your lot; for you will  be stunned with the noise of the dwarfs and the storks; besides, it is  mortifying in the extreme that you, as well as myself, should have lost  the treasures of the subterranean palace.\"    At the mention of the subterranean palace the Caliph suspended his  caresses, to seek from Nouronihar an explanation of her meaning.  She  then recapitulated her vision, what immediately followed, and the history  of her pretended death, adding also a description of the place of  expiation from whence she had fled, and all in a manner that would have  extorted his laughter, had not the thoughts of Vathek been too deeply  engaged.  No sooner, however, had she ended, than he again clasped her to  his bosom, and said:    \"Light of my eyes! the mystery is unravelled; we both are alive! your  father is a cheat, who, for the sake of dividing, hath deluded us both;  and the Giaour, whose design, as far as I can discover, is that we shall  proceed together, seems scarce a whit better; it shall be some time at  least before he find us in his palace of fire.  Your lovely little person  in my estimation is far more precious than all the treasures of the  pre-adamite Sultans, and I wish to possess it at pleasure, and in open  day, for many a moon, before I go to burrow underground like a mole.  Forget this little trifler, Gulchenrouz, and--\"    \"Ah! my lord!\" interposed Nouronihar, \"let me entreat that you do him no  evil.\"    \"No, no!\" replied Vathek, \"I have already bid you forbear to alarm  yourself for him; he has been brought up too much on milk and sugar to  stimulate my jealousy; we will leave him with the dwarfs, who, by the  bye, are my old acquaintances; their company will suit him far better  than yours.  As to other matters, I will return no more to your father's;  I want not to have my ears dinned by him and his dotards with the  violation of the rites of hospitality; as if it were less an honour for  you to espouse the sovereign of the world than a girl dressed up like a  boy!\"    Nouronihar could find nothing to oppose in a discourse so eloquent; she  only wished the amorous monarch had discovered more ardour for the  carbuncle of Giamschid; but flattered herself it would gradually  increase, and therefore yielded to his will with the most bewitching  submission.    When the Caliph judged it proper, he called for Bababalouk, who was  asleep in the cave of Meimoune, and dreaming that the phantom of  Nouronihar, having mounted him once more on her swing, had just given him  such a jerk, that he one moment soared above the mountains, and the next  sunk into the abyss; starting from his sleep at the voice of his master,  he ran gasping for breath, and had nearly fallen backward at the sight,  as he believed, of the spectre by whom he had so lately been haunted in  his dream.    \"Ah, my lord!\" cried he, recoiling ten steps, and covering his eyes with  both hands: \"do you then perform the office of a Goul? 'tis true you have  dug up the dead, yet hope not to make her your prey; for after all she  hath caused me to suffer, she is even wicked enough to prey upon you.\"    \"Cease thy folly,\" said Vathek, \"and thou shalt soon be convinced that it  is Nouronihar herself, alive and well, whom I clasp to my breast; go only  and pitch my tents in the neighbouring valley; there will I fix my abode  with this beautiful tulip, whose colours I soon shall restore; there  exert thy best endeavours to procure whatever can augment the"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/20606"],[0,"The Magic City (#16)"],[1," never thought a thing like  this _could_ begin, did you?'    'I don't know,' she said, 'everything's very wonderful. I've always been  expecting things to be more wonderful than they ever have been. You get  sort of hints and nudges, you know. Fairy tales--yes, and dreams, you  can't help feeling they must mean _something_. And your sister and my  daddy; the two of them being such friends when they were little, and  then parted and then getting friends again;--_that's_ like a story in a  dream, isn't it? And your building the city and me helping. And my daddy  being such a dear darling and your sister being such a darling dear. It  did make me think beautiful things were sort of likely. Didn't it you?'    'No,' said Philip; 'I mean yes,' he said, and he was in that moment  nearer to liking Lucy than he had ever been before; 'everything's very  wonderful, isn't it?'    'Ahem!' said a respectful cough behind them.    They turned to meet the calm gaze of Double-six.    'If you've quite finished breakfast, Sir Philip,' he said, 'Mr. Noah  would be pleased to see you in his office.'    'Me too?' said Lucy, before Philip could say, 'Only me, I suppose?'    'You may come too, if you wish it, your Highness,' said Double-six,  bowing stiffly.    They found Mr. Noah very busy in a little room littered with papers; he  was sitting at a table writing.    'Good-morning, Princess,' he said, 'good-morning, Sir Philip. You see me  very busy. I am trying to arrange for your next labour.'    'Do you mean my next deed of valour?' Philip asked.    'We have decided that all your deeds need not be deeds of valour,' said  Mr. Noah, fiddling with a pen. 'The strange labours of Hercules, you  remember, were some of them dangerous and some merely difficult. I have  decided that difficult things shall count. There are several things that  really _need_ doing,' he went on half to himself. 'There's the fruit  supply, and the Dwellers by the sea, and---- But that must wait. We try  to give you as much variety as possible. Yesterday's was an out-door  adventure. To-day's shall be an indoor amusement. I say to-day's but I  confess that I think it not unlikely that the task I am now about to set  the candidate for the post of King-Deliverer, the task, I say, which I  am now about to set you, may, quite possibly, occupy some days, if not  weeks of your valuable time.'    'But our people at home,' said Philip. 'It isn't that I'm afraid, really  and truly it isn't, but they'll go out of their minds, not knowing  what's become of us. Oh, Mr. Noah! do let us go back.'    'It's all right,' said Mr. Noah. 'However long you stay here time won't  move with them. I thought I'd explained that to you.'    'But you said----'    'I said you'd set our clocks to the time of _your_ world when you  deserted your little friend. But when you had come back for her, and  rescued her from the dragon, the clocks went their own time again.  There's only just that time missing that happened between your coming  here the second time and your killing the dragon.'    'I see,' said Philip. But he didn't. I only hope _you_ do.    'You can take your time about this new job,' said Mr. Noah, 'and you may  get any help you like. I shan't consider you've failed till you've been  at it three months. After that the Pretenderette would be entitled to  _her_ chance.'    'If you're quite sure that the time here doesn't count at home,' said  Philip, 'what is it, please, that we've got to do?'    'The greatest intellects of our country have for many ages occupied  themselves with the problem which you are now asked to solve,' said Mr.  Noah. 'Your late gaoler, Mr. Bacon-Shakespeare, has written no less than  twenty-seven volumes, all in cypher, on this very subject. But as he has  forgotten what cypher he used, and no one else ever knew it, his volumes  are of but little use to us.'    'I see,' said Philip. And again he didn't.    Mr. Noah rose to his full height, and when he stood up the children  looked very small beside him.    'Now,' he said, 'I will tell you what it is that you must do. I should  like to decree that your second labour should be the tidying up of this  room--_all_ these papers are prophecies relating to the Deliverer--but  it is one of our laws that the judge must not use any public matter for  his own personal benefit. So I have decided that the next labour shall  be the disentangling of the Mazy Carpet. It is in the Pillared Hall of  Public Amusements. I will get my hat and we will go there at once. I  can tell you about it as we go.'    And as they went down streets and past houses and palaces all of which  Philip could now dimly remember to have built at some time or other, Mr.  Noah went on:    'It is a very beautiful hall, but we have never been able to use it for  public amusement or anything else. The giant who originally built this  city placed in this hall a carpet so thick that it rises to your knees,  and so intricately woven that none can disentangle it. It is far too  thick to pass through any of the doors. It is your task to remove it.'    'Why that's as easy as easy,' said Philip. 'I'll cut it in bits and  bring out a bit at a time.'    'That would be most unfortunate for you,' said Mr. Noah. 'I filed only  this morning a very ancient prophecy:              'He who shall the carpet sever,               By fire or flint or steel,             Shall be fed on orange pips for ever,               And dressed in orange peel.    You wouldn't like that, you know.'    'No,' said Philip grimly, 'I certainly shouldn't.'    'The carpet must be _unravelled_, unwoven, so that not a thread is  broken. Here is the hall.'    They went up steps--Philip sometimes wished he had not been so fond of  building steps--and through a dark vestibule to an arched door. Looking  through it they saw a great hall and at its end a raised space, more  steps, and two enormous pillars of bronze wrought in relief with figures  of flying birds.    'Father's Japanese vases,' Lucy whispered.    The floor of the room was covered by the carpet. It was loosely but  difficultly woven of very thick soft rope of a red colour. When I say  difficultly, I mean that it wasn't just straight-forward in the weaving,  but the threads went over and under and round about in such a determined  and bewildering way that Philip felt--and said--that he would rather  untie the string of a hundred of the most difficult parcels than tackle  this.    'Well,' said Mr. Noah, 'I leave you to it. Board and lodging will be  provided at the Provisional Palace where you slept last night. All  citizens are bound to assist when called upon. Dinner is at one.  _Good_-morning!'    Philip sat down in the dark archway and gazed helplessly at the twisted  strands of the carpet. After a moment of hesitation Lucy sat down too,  clasped her arms round her knees, and she also gazed at the carpet. They  had all the appearance of shipwrecked mariners looking out over a great  sea and longing for a sail.    'Ha ha--tee hee!' said a laugh close behind them. They turned. And it  was the motor-veiled lady, the hateful Pretenderette, who had crept up  close behind them, and was looking down at them through her veil.    'What do you want?' said Philip severely.    'I want to laugh,' said the motor lady. 'I want to laugh at _you_. And  I'm going to.'    'Well go and laugh somewhere else then,' Philip suggested.    'Ah! but this is where I want to laugh. You and your carpet! You'll  never do it. You don't know how. But _I_ do.'    'Come away,' whispered Lucy, and they went. The Pretenderette followed  slowly. Outside, a couple of Dutch dolls in check suits were passing,  arm in arm.    'Help!' cried Lucy suddenly, and the Dutch dolls paused and took their  hats off.    'What is it?' the taller doll asked, stroking his black painted  moustache.    'Mr. Noah said all citizens were bound to help us,' said Lucy a little  breathlessly.    'But of course,' said the shorter doll, bowing with stiff courtesy.    'Then,' said Lucy, 'will you _please_ take that motor person away and  put her somewhere where she can't bother till we've done the carpet?'    'Delighted,' exclaimed the agreeable Dutch strangers, darted up the  steps and next moment emerged with the form of the Pretenderette between  them, struggling indeed, but struggling vainly.    'You need not have the slightest further anxiety,' the taller Dutchman  said; 'dismiss the incident from your mind. We will take her to the hall  of justice. Her offence is bothering people in pursuit of their duty.  The sentence is imprisonment for as long as the botheree chooses.  Good-morning.'    'Oh, _thank you_!' said both the children together.    When they were alone, Philip said--and it was not easy to say it:    'That was jolly clever of you, Lucy. I should never have thought of it.'    'Oh, that's nothing,' said Lucy, looking down. 'I could do more than  that.'    'What?' he asked.    'I could unravel the carpet,' said Lucy, with deep solemnity.    'But it's me that's got to do it,' Philip urged.    'Every citizen is bound to help, if called in,' Lucy reminded him. 'And  I suppose a princess _is_ a citizen.'    'Perhaps I can do it by myself,' said Philip.    'Try,' said Lucy, and sat down on the steps, her fairy skirts spreading  out round her like a white double hollyhock.    He tried. He went back and looked at the great coarse cables of the  carpet. He could see no end to the cables, no beginning to his task. And  Lucy just went on sitting there like a white hollyhock. And time went  on, and presently became, rather urgently, dinner-time.    So he went back to Lucy and said:    'All right, you can show me how to do it, if you like.'    But Lucy replied:    'Not much! If you want me to help you with _this_, you'll have to  promise to let me help in all the other things. And you'll have to _ask_  me to help--ask me politely too.'    'I shan't then,' said Philip. But in the end he had to--polit"]]]
