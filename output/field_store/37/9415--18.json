It was blue--_No_, Bart thought, _that's just the  light, it's more like red--no, it can't be like_ both _of them at once,  and it isn't really like either. In this light--_    Ringg moaned, and Bart, glancing round, saw that he was struggling to  sit up. He ran back to him, dropping to his knees at Ringg's side. \"It's  all right, Ringg, lie still. We're under cover now.\"    \"Wha' happened?\" Ringg said blurrily. \"Head hurts--all sparks--all the  pretty lights--can't _see_ you!\" He fumbled with loose, uncoordinated  fingers at his head and Bart grabbed at him before he poked a claw in  his eye. \"Don't _do_ that,\" Ringg complained, \"can't _see_--\"    _He must have a bad concussion then. That's a nasty cut._ Gently, he  restrained the Lhari boy's hands.    \"Bartol, what happened?\"    Bart explained. Ringg tried to move, but fell limply back.    \"Weren't you hurt? I thought I heard you cry out.\"    \"A cut or two, but nothing serious,\" Bart said. \"I think the hail's  stopped. Lie still, I'd better go back to the ship and get help.\"    \"Give me a hand and I can walk,\" Ringg said, but when he tried to sit  up, he flinched, and Bart said, \"You'd better lie still.\" He knew that  head injuries should be kept very quiet; he was almost afraid to leave  Ringg for fear the Lhari boy would have another delirious fit and hurt  himself, but there was no help for it.    The hail had stopped, and the piled heaps were already melting, but it  was bitterly cold. Bart wrapped himself in the silvery cloak, glad of  its warmth, and struggled back across the slushy, ice-strewn meadow that  had been so pink and flowery in the sunshine. The _Swiftwing_, a  monstrous dark egg looming in the twilight, seemed like home. Bart felt  the heavenly warmth close around him with a sigh of pure relief, but the  Second Officer, coming up the hatchway, stopped in consternation:    \"You're covered with blood! The hailstorm--\"    \"I'm all right,\" Bart said, \"but Ringg's been hurt. You'll need a  stretcher.\" Quickly, he explained. \"I'll come with you and show you--\"    \"You'll do no such thing,\" the officer said. \"You look as if you'd been  caught out in a meteor shower, feathertop! We can find the place. You go  and have those cuts attended to, and--what's wrong with your wrist?  Broken?\"    Bart heard, like an echo, the frightening words: _Don't break any bones.  You won't pass an X-ray._    \"It's all right, sir. When I get washed up--\"    \"That's an _order_,\" snapped the officer, \"do you think, on this  pestilential unlucky planet, we can afford any _more_ bad luck? Metals  fatigue, Karol burned so badly the medic thinks he may never use his  hand again, and now you and Ringg getting yourselves laid up and out of  action? The medic will help me with Ringg; that Mentorian girl can look  after you. Get moving!\"    He hurried away, and Bart, his head beginning to hurt, walked slowly up  the ramp. His whole arm felt numb, and he supported it with his good  hand.    In the small infirmary, Karol lay groaning in a bunk, his arm bound in  bandages, his head moving from side to side. The Mentorian girl Meta  turned, charging a hypo. She looked pale and drawn. She went to Karol,  uncovering his other arm, and made the injection; almost immediately the  moaning stopped and Karol lay still. Meta sighed and drew a hand over  her brow, brushing away feathery wisps that escaped from the cap tied  over her hair.    \"Bartol? You're hurt? Not more burns, I hope?\"    _She looks just like a fluffy little kitten_, Bart thought  incongruously. Fatigue was beginning to blur his reactions.    \"Only a few cuts,\" he said, in Universal, though Meta had spoken Lhari.  In his weariness and pain he was homesick for the sound of a familiar  word. \"Ringg and I were both caught in the hailstorm. He's badly hurt.\"    \"Sit down here.\"    Bart sat. Meta's hands were skillful and cool as she sponged the blood  away from his forehead and sprayed it with some pleasantly cold,  mint-smelling antiseptic. Bart leaned back, tireder than he knew,  half-closing his eyes.    \"That hail must have been enormous; we heard it through the hull.  Whatever possessed you to go out into it?\"    \"It wasn't hailing when we left,\" Bart said wearily. \"The sun was as  nice and green as it could be.\" He bit the words off, realizing he had  made a slip, but the girl seemed not to hear, fastening a strip of  plastic over a cut. She picked up his wrist. Bart flinched in spite of  himself, and Meta nodded. \"I was afraid of that; it may be broken.  Better let me X-ray it.\"    \"No!\" Bart said harshly. \"It's all right, I just twisted it. Nothing's  broken. Just strap it up.\"    \"It's pretty badly swollen,\" the girl said, moving it gently. \"Does that  hurt? I thought so.\"    Bart set his teeth against a cry. \"It's all right, I tell you. Just  because it's black and blue--\"    He heard her breath jolt out, her fingers clenched painfully on his  wounded wrist. She did not hear his cry this time. \"And the sun was nice  and _green_,\" she whispered. _\"What are you?\"_    Bart felt himself slip sidewise; he thought for a moment that he would  faint where he sat. Terrified, he looked up at Meta. Their eyes met, and  she said, hardly moving her pale lips, \"Your eyes--they're like mine.  Your eyelashes--dark, not white. _You're not a Lhari!_\"    The pain in his wrist suddenly blurred everything else, but Meta  suddenly realized she was gripping it; she gave a little, gentle cry,  and cradled the abused wrist in her palm.    \"No wonder you didn't want it X-rayed,\" she whispered. Biting her lip,  she glanced, terrified, at Karol, unconscious in the bunk. \"No, he can't  hear us; I gave him a heavy shot of hypnin, poor fellow.\"    \"Go ahead,\" Bart said bitterly, \"yell for your keepers.\"    Her gray eyes blazed at him for a moment; then, gently, she laid his  wrist on the table, went to the infirmary door and locked it on the  inside. She turned around, her face white; even her lips had lost their  color. \"Who are you?\" she whispered.    \"Does it matter now?\"    Shocked comprehension swept over her face. \"You don't think I'd _tell_  them,\" she whispered. \"I heard talk, in the Procyon port, of a spy that  had managed to get through on a Lhari ship.\" Her face twisted. \"You--you  must know about the man on the _Multiphase_, you know they'll--make sure  I can't--hide anything dangerous to the Lhari at the end of the voyage.\"    \"Meta--\" concern for her swept over him--\"what will they do to you when  they find out that you know and--didn't tell?\"    Her gray eyes were wide as a kitten's. \"Why, nothing. The Lhari would  never _hurt_ anyone, would they?\"    Brainwashed? He set his mouth grimly. \"I hope you never find out  different.\"    \"Why would they need to?\" she asked, reasonably. \"They could just erase  the memory. I never heard of a Lhari actually hurting anyone. But  something like this--\" She wavered, looking at him. \"You look so _much_  like a Lhari! How was it done? How could they do it? Poor fellow, you  must be the--the loneliest man in the Universe!\"    Her voice was compassionate. Bart felt his throat tighten, and had the  awful feeling that he was going to cry. He reached with his good hand  for hers, seeking the comfort of a human touch, but she flinched  instinctively away.    _He was a monster to this pretty girl...._    \"It looks so real,\" she said helplessly. \"Yes, now I can see, you have  tiny moons at the base of the nail, and the Lhari don't.\" Her face  worked. \"It's--it's horrifying! How could you--\"    There was a noise in the corridor. Meta gasped and ran to unlock the  door, stood back as the medic and the Second Officer came in, staggering  under Ringg's weight. Carefully, they put him into a bunk. The medic  straightened, shaking his crest.    \"Did you get that wrist taken care of, Bartol?\"    Meta stepped between Bart and the officer, reaching for a roll of  bandage. \"I'm working on it now, _rieko mori_,\" she said. \"It only wants  strapping up.\" But her fingers trembled as she wound the gauze, pulling  each fold tight.    \"How's--Ringg?\"    \"Needs quiet,\" grunted the medic, \"and a few sutures. Lucky you got him  under cover when you did.\"    Ringg said weakly from his bunk, \"Bartol saved my life. I can think of  plenty who'd have run for cover, instead of staying out in that stuff  long enough to drag me inside. Thanks, shipmate.\"    Meta's hand, with a swift hard pressure, lingered on Bart's shoulder as  she cut the bandage and fastened the end. \"I don't think that will  bother you much now,\" she whispered, fleetingly. \"I didn't dare say it  was broken or they'd insist on X-rays. If it hurts I'll get you  something later for the pain. If you keep it strapped up tight--\"    \"It will do,\" Bart said aloud. The tight bandage made it feel a little  better, but he felt sick and dizzy, and when the medic turned and saw  him, the officer said brusquely \"Watch off for you, Bartol. I'll fix the  sign-out sheet, but you go to your cabin and get yourself at least four  hours of sleep. _That's an order._\"    Bart stumbled out of the cabin with relief. Safe in his own quarters, he  flung himself down on his bunk, shaking all over. He'd come safely  through one more nightmare, one more terror--for the moment! Had he put  Meta in danger, too? Was there no end to this ceaseless fear? Not only  for himself, but for others, the innocent bystanders who stumbled into  plots they did not understand?    _You're doing this for the stars. It's bigger than your fear. It's  bigger than you are, or any of the others...._    He was beginning to think it was a lot too big for him.

There should be in a well-regulated state  seven or eight writers, not more; and these under the inspection of  government. Authors are the plague of France; you will see whither they  will lead it.\"    The king spoke this with an animated air, and if at this moment M. de la  Vrilliere had come to ask for a _lettre de cachet_ against a writer, the  king would not have refused it.    \"Besides,\" added the king, in a tone of less anger, but no less  emphatically, \"I see with pain that the police do not do their duty with  regard to all these indignities.\"    \"Yet,\" said the duc de Duras, \"M. de Sartines does wonders.\"    \"Then why does he tolerate such insults? I will let him know my  discontent.\"    The duc de Duras was alarmed, and kept his mouth closed. The king then,  resuming his gaiety, joked the two gentlemen on their secret intrigues:  then changing the conversation suddenly, he talked of the expected  arrival of the king of Denmark.    \"Duc de Duras,\" said he, \"you and your son must do the office of master  of ceremonies to his _Polar_ majesty. I hope you will endeavor to amuse  him.\"    \"Yes, sire.\"    \"Mind, what you undertake is no joke. It is no easy matter to amuse a  king.\"    This was a truth which I perceived at every moment, and our monarch  was not the one to be amused with trifling exertion. Frequently when  he entered my apartment he threw himself on an ottoman, and yawned most  excessively, yes, yawned in my company. I had but one mode of rousing  him from this apathy, but it was a sure one. I spoke of the high  magistracy and its perpetual resistance to the throne. Then the king  aroused, instantly sprung from his seat, traversed the room with rapid  strides, and declaimed vigorously against the _black gowns_; thus he  styled the parliaments. I confess, however, that I only had recourse to  the \"black gowns\" at the last extremity. Little did I think that at a  later period I should league myself against them. On the one hand, the  duc d'Aiguillon hated them mortally, and on the other, the comte Jean,  like a real Toulousian, would have carried them in his slippers; so that  wavering between the admiration of the one and the hatred of the other,  I knew not which to listen to, or which party to side with. But to  return to present matters.    The king was always thinking of the \"_ Nouvelles a la Main,_\" and  determined to avenge me as openly as I had been attacked. Two or three  days afterwards he gave a supper, to which he invited the duchesse and  comtesse de Grammont, madame de Forcalquier, the princess de Marsan, the  marechale de Mirepoix, and the comtesses de Coigny and de Montbarrey.  They were seated at table laughing and amusing themselves; they talked  of the pleasure of being to _themselves_, of having no _strangers_; they  pierced me with a hundred thrusts; they triumphed! And yet the king was  laughing in his sleeve. At a premeditated signal the duc d'Aiguillon,  one of the guests, asked his majesty if he had seen the comtesse du  Barry that day. This terrible name, thrown suddenly into the midst of my  enemies, had the effect of a thunder-clap. All the ladies looked at each  other first and then at the king, and the duc d'Aiguillon, reserving  profound silence. His majesty then replied, that he had not had the  happiness of visiting me that day, not having had one moment's leisure;  then eulogized me at great length, and ended by saying to the duke, \"If  you see the comtesse before I do, be sure to say that I drank this glass  of wine to her health.\"    The ladies did not anticipate this. The duchesse de Grammont  particularly, in spite of long residence at court, turned pale to her  very ears, and I believe but for etiquette she would have fallen into  a swoon. I learnt afterwards from the marechale de Mirepoix, that the  duchesse, on going home, gave herself up to a fit of rage, which did  not terminate even on the following day. When the king related this  occurrence to me, he was as proud of it as if he had done a most  courageous deed.    But I have omitted a day which was of great importance to me in  its consequences. I mean the day which followed that on which I had  complained to the duc de Duras of M. the lieutenant of police. In the  morning early my sister-in-law came into my room.    \"Sister,\" said she, \"comte Jean is here with M. de Sartines, who begs to  pay his respects to you. Will you receive him?\"    \"M. de Sartines! Yes, let him come in; I will treat him as he deserves.\"    Comte Jean then came in, preceded by the lieutenant of police: he wore  a large peruke with white powder, and curled with the utmost care. Wigs  were his mania, and he had a room filled from floor to ceiling with  these ornaments. The duc d'Ayen said, that he never should be in trouble  about the council of state, for in case of need, it might be found and  replenished from the house of the lieutenant of police. Let us leave  wigs and revert to M. de Sartines.    He appeared before me with the air of Tartuffe, and, forgive the phrase,  _en vrai capon_.    \"Madame,\" said he to me, \"I have been informed that I am in disgrace  with you, and have come to inquire how I may extricate myself from this  misfortune.\"    \"You ought to know, sir. Twice in one month have I been shamefully  insulted; and yet the first intimation of such a thing ought to have put  you on your guard.\"    M. de Sartines, whom my tone had much surprised, endeavored to justify  himself, when comte Jean said to him,    \"My dear lieutenant of police, all you have said goes for nothing. One  thing is certain, and that is, that there is a deficiency of respect  towards my sister-in-law. You say that it is not your fault: what proof  do you give us of this? What inquiries have you made? What measures have  you taken? Any? Why do you come to us if you aid our enemies?\"    M. de Sartines would fain have ensconced himself in his own dignity.    \"M. du Barry,\" was his reply, \"I shall render an account of my conduct  to the king.\"    \"Very well, sir,\" I replied, \"but do not suppose that either you or the  Choiseuls can give me any cause of fear.\"    M. de Sartines was thunderstruck; my boldness astonished him. At length  he said,    \"Madame, you are angry with me causelessly; I am more negligent than  culpable. It is useless to say this to the king.\"    \"I will not conceal from you, sir, that he knows it all, and is greatly  discontented with you.\"    \"I am lost then,\" said M. de Sartines.    \"Lost! not precisely,\" replied comte Jean; \"but you must decide at once  and for ever what party you will join. If you are with us they will use  you harshly; if you take the opposite party look to yourself. Choose.\"    After some turnings and twistings, accompanied with compliments, M. de  Sartines declared that he would range himself under our banner. Then  I extended to him my hand in token of reconciliation; he took it with  respect, and kissed it with gallantry. Up to this time we had conversed  with feelings of restraint and standing; but now we seated ourselves,  and begun a conference in form, as to the manner of preventing a  recurrence of the offensive outrages against me. As a proof of good  intention M. de Sartines told me the author of the two articles of which  I complained. He was a wretch, named Ledoux, who for twelve hundred  livres per annum wrote down all those who displeased the duchesse de  Grammont. This lady had no fear of doing all that was necessary to  remove every obstacle to the publication of such infamies.    After M. de Sartines had given us all the details which we desired,  and after I had promised to reconcile him to his master, he went away  delighted with having seen me. Believe me, my friend, it is necessary to  be as handsome as I am, that is to say, as I was, to seduce a lieutenant  of police.        CHAPTER VIII      The sieur Ledoux--The _lettre de cachet_--The duc de la Vrilliere--  Madame de Langeac--M. de Maupeou--Louis XV--The comte Jean    On that very evening, the king having come to me, I said to him,    \"Sire, I have made acquaintance with M. de Sartines.\"    \"What! has he been to make friends with you?\"    \"Something like it: but he has appeared to me less culpable than I  thought. He had only yielded to the solicitation of my personal enemy.\"    \"You cannot have one at my court, madame; the lieutenant of police would  have done well not to have named her to you.\"    \"Thanks to him, however, I shall now know whom I ought to mistrust. I  know also who is the author of the two scurrilous paragraphs.\"    \"Some scamp, no doubt; some beggarly scoundrel.\"    \"A monsieur Ledoux.\"    \"Ah, I know the fellow. His bad reputation has reached me. It must be  stopped at last.\"    So saying, Louis XV went to the chimney, and pulled the bell-rope with  so much vehemence that ten persons answered it at once.    \"Send for the duc de la Vrilliere; if he be not suitably attired let him  come in his night-gown, no matter so that he appear quickly.\"    On hearing an order given in this manner a stranger might have supposed  the king crazy, and not intent on imprisoning a miserable libeller. I  interceded in his favor, but Louis XV, delighted at an opportunity  of playing the king at a small cost, told me that it was no person's  business, and he would be dictated to by no one. I was silent, reserving  myself until another opportunity when I could undertake the defence of  the poor devil.    The duc de la Vrilliere arrived, not in a dressing-gown, as the king  had authorized, but in magnificent costume. He piqued himself on his  expenditure, and always appeared superbly attired, altho' the splendor  of his apparel could not conceal the meanness of his look. He was the  oldest secretary of state, and certainly was the least skilful, least  esteemed, least considered. Some time after his death some one said of  him in the"]]]
