As the formidable power and turbulent  disposition of the earl of Glocester gave him apprehensions, he insisted  on carrying him along with him, in consequence of a vow which that  nobleman had made to undertake the same voyage: in the mean time, he  obliged him to resign some of his castles, and to enter into a new bond  not to disturb the peace of the kingdom.[**]         * M. Paris, p. 677         ** Chron. T. Wykes, p. 90.    He sailed from England with an army; and arrived in Lewis's camp before  Tunis in Africa, where he found that monarch already dead, from the  intemperance of the climate and the fatigues of his enterprise. The  great, if not only weakness of this prince, in his government, was  the imprudent passion for crusades; but it was this zeal chiefly that  procured him from the clergy the title of St. Lewis, by which he is  known in the French history and if that appellation had not been so  extremely prostituted as to become rather a term of reproach, he seems,  by his uniform probity and goodness, as well as his piety, to have fully  merited the title. He was succeeded by his son Philip, denominated  the Hardy; a prince of some merit, though much inferior to that of his  father.    {1271.} Prince Edward, not discouraged by this event, continued his  voyage to the Holy Land, where he signalized himself by acts of valor;  revived the glory of the English name in those parts; and struck such  terror into the Saracens, that they employed an assassin to murder him,  who wounded him in the arm, but perished in the attempt.[*] Meanwhile  his absence from England was attended with many of those pernicious  consequences which had been dreaded from it. The laws were not executed:  the barons oppressed the common people with impunity: they gave shelter  on their estates to bands of robbers, whom they employed in committing  ravages on the estates of their enemies: the populace of London returned  to their usual licentiousness: and the old king, unequal to the burden  of public affairs, called aloud for his gallant son to return,[**] and  to assist him in swaying that sceptre which was ready to drop from  his feeble and irresolute hands. At last, overcome by the cares of  government and the infirmities of age, he visibly declined, and he  expired at St. Edmondsbury in the sixty-fourth year of his age, and  fifty-sixth of his reign;[***] the longest reign that is to be met with  in the English annals.         * M. Paris, p. 678, 679. W. Heming, p. 520.         ** Chron. Dunst. vol. i. p. 404.         *** Kymer, vol. i. p. 869. M. Paris, p. 678.    {1272.} His brother, the king of the Romans, (for he never attained the  title of emperor,) died about seven months before him.    The most obvious circumstance of Henry's character is his incapacity for  government, which rendered him as much a prisoner in the hands of his  own ministers and favorites, and as little at his own disposal, as when  detained a captive in the hands of his enemies. From this source, rather  than from insincerity or treachery, arose his negligence in observing  his promises; and he was too easily induced, for the sake of present  convenience, to sacrifice the lasting advantages arising from the trust  and confidence of his people. Hence too were derived his profusion to  favorites, his attachment to strangers, the variableness of his  conduct, his hasty resentments, and his sudden forgiveness and return of  affection.    Instead of reducing the dangerous power of his nobles, by obliging  them to observe the laws towards their inferiors, and setting them the  salutary example in his own government, he was seduced to imitate  their conduct, and to make his arbitrary will, or rather that of his  ministers, the rule of his actions. Instead of accommodating himself,  by a strict frugality, to the embarrassed situation in which his  revenue had been left by the military expeditions of his uncle, the  dissipations of his father, and the usurpations of the barons, he was  tempted to levy money by irregular exactions, which, without enriching  himself, impoverished, at least disgusted, his people. Of all men,  nature seemed least to have fitted him for being a tyrant, yet are there  instances of oppression in his reign, which, though derived from the  precedents left him by his predecessors, had been carefully guarded  against by the Great Charter, and are inconsistent with all rules of  good government. And on the whole, we may say, that greater abilities,  with his good dispositions, would have prevented him from falling  into his faults, or with worse dispositions, would have enabled him to  maintain and defend them.    This prince was noted for his piety and devotion, and his regular  attendance on public worship; and a saying of his on that head is much  celebrated by ancient writers. He was engaged in a dispute with Lewis  IX. of France, concerning the preference between sermons and masses: he  maintained the superiority of the latter, and affirmed, that he would  rather have one hour's conversation with a friend, than hear twenty of  the most elaborate discourses pronounced in his praise.[*]         * Walsing. Edw. I. p. 43.    Henry left two sons, Edward, his successor, and Edmond earl of  Lancaster; and two daughters, Margaret, queen of Scotland, and Beatrix,  duchess of Brittany. He had five other children, who died in their  infancy.    The following are the most remarkable laws enacted during this reign.  There had been great disputes between the civil and ecclesiastical  courts concerning bastardy. The common law had deemed all those to  be bastards who were born before wedlock; by the canon law they were  legitimate: and when any dispute of inheritance arose, it had formerly  been usual for the civil courts to issue writs to the spiritual,  directing them to inquire into the legitimacy of the person. The bishop  always returned an answer agreeable to the canon law, though contrary to  the municipal law of the kingdom. For this reason, the civil courts had  changed the terms of their writ; and instead of requiring the spiritual  courts to make inquisition concerning the legitimacy of the person, they  only proposed the simple question of fact, whether he were born before  or after wedlock. The prelates complained of this practice to the  parliament assembled at Merton in the twentieth of this king, and  desired that the municipal law might be rendered conformable to the  canon; but received from all the nobility the memorable reply, \"Nolumus  leges Angliae mutare.\" We will not change the laws of England.[*]    After the civil wars, the parliament summoned at Marlebridge gave their  approbation to most of the ordinances which had been established by the  reforming barons, and which though advantageous to the security of the  people, had not received the sanction of a legal authority. Among other  laws, it was there enacted, that all appeals from the courts of inferior  lords should be carried directly to the king's courts, without passing  through the courts of the lords immediately superior.[**] It was  ordained, that money should bear no interest during the minority of  the debtor.[***] This law was reasonable, as the estates of minors  were always in the hands of their lords, and the debtors could not pay  interest where they had no revenue. The charter of King John had granted  this indulgence: it was omitted in that of Henry III., for what reason  is not known; but it was renewed by the statute of Marlebridge. Most  of the other articles of this statute are calculated to restrain the  oppressions of sheriffs, and the violence and iniquities committed  in distraining cattle and other goods. Cattle and the instruments of  husbandry formed at that time the chief riches of the people.    In the thirty-fifth year of this king, an assize was fixed of bread, the  price of which was settled according to the different prices of corn,  from one shilling a quarter to seven shillings and sixpence,[****]  money of that age. These great variations are alone a proof of bad  tillage:[*****] yet did the prices often rise much higher than any taken  notice of by the statute.         * Statute of Merton, chap. 9.         ** Statute of Marlb. chap. 20.         *** Ibid. chap. 16.         **** Statutes at large, p. 6.         ***** We learn from Cicero's orations against Verres, (lib.       iii. cap. 81, 92,) that the price of corn in Sicily was,       during the preetorship of Sacerdos five denarii amodius;       during that of Verres, which immediately succeeded, only two       sesterces; that is, ten times lower; a presumption, or       rather a proof, of the very bad state of tillage in ancient       times.    The Chronicle of Dunstable tells us, that in this reign wheat was once  sold for a mark, nay, for a pound a quarter; that is, three pounds of  our present money.[*] The same law affords us a proof of the little  communication between the parts of the kingdom, from the very different  prices which the same commodity bore at the same time. A brewer, says  the statute, may sell two gallons of ale for a penny in cities, and  three or four gallons for the same price in the country. At present,  such commodities, by the great consumption of the people, and the great  stocks of the brewers, are rather cheapest in cities. The Chronicle  above mentioned observes, that wheat one year was sold in many places  for eight shillings a quarter, but never rose in Dunstable above a  crown.         * So also Knyghton, p. 2444.

(#16)"],[1,"precepts to attach men, and summon them  before themselves and some others, at their private houses, in a court  of commission, where, in a summary manner, without trial or jury,  arbitrary decrees were issued, both in pleas of the crown and  controversies between private parties. Juries themselves, when summoned,  proved but small security to the subject; being browbeaten by these  oppressors; nay, fined, imprisoned, and punished, if they gave sentence  against the inclination of the ministers The whole system of the feudal  law, which still prevailed, was turned into a scheme of oppression. Even  the king's wards, after they came of age, were not suffered to enter  into possession of their lands without paying exorbitant fines. Men  were also harassed with informations of intrusion upon scarce colorable  titles. When an outlawry in a personal action was issued against any  man, he was not allowed to purchase his charter of pardon, except on the  payment of a great sum; and if he refused the composition required of  him, the strict law, which in such cases allows forfeiture of goods, was  rigorously insisted on. Nay, without any color of law, the half of men's  lands and rents were seized during two years, as a penalty in case of  outlawry. But the chief means of oppression employed by these ministers  were the penal statutes, which, without consideration of rank, quality,  or services, were rigidly put in execution against all men: spies,  informers, and inquisitors were rewarded and encouraged in every quarter  of the kingdom: and no difference was made, whether the statute were  beneficial or hurtful, recent or obsolete, possible or impossible to be  executed. The sole end of the king and his ministers was to amass money,  and bring every one under the lash of their authority.[*]    Through the prevalence of such an arbitrary and iniquitous  administration, the English, it may safely be affirmed, were  considerable losers by their ancient privileges, which secured them  from all taxations, except such as were imposed by their own consent  in parliament. Had the king been empowered to levy general taxes at  pleasure, he would naturally have abstained from these oppressive  expedients, which destroyed all security in private property, and begat  a universal diffidence throughout the nation. In vain did the people  look for protection from the parliament, which was pretty frequently  summoned during this reign.    {1504.} That assembly was so overawed, that at this very time, during  the greatest rage of Henry's oppressions, the commons chose Dudley their  speaker, the very man who was the chief instrument of his iniquities.  And though the king was known to be immensely opulent, and had no  pretence of wars or expensive enterprises of any kind, they granted him  the subsidy which he demanded. But so insatiable was his avarice, that  next year he levied a new benevolence, and renewed that arbitrary and  oppressive method of taxation.    {1505.} By all these arts of accumulation, joined to a rigid frugality  in his expense, he so filled his coffers, that he is said to have  possessed in ready money the sum of one million eight hundred thousand  pounds; a treasure almost incredible, if we consider the scarcity of  money in those times.[**]         * Bacon, p. 629, 630. Holingshed, p. 504. Polyd. Virg. p.       613, 615.         ** Silver was during this reign at thirty-seven shillings       and six pence a pound, which makes Henry's treasure near       three millions of our present money. Besides, many       commodities have become above thrice as dear by the increase       of gold and silver in Europe. And what is a circumstance of       still greater weight, all other states were then very poor,       in comparison of what they are at present. These       circumstances make Henry's treasure appear very great, and       may lead us to conceive the oppressions of his government.    But while Henry was enriching himself by the spoils of his oppressed  people, there happened an event abroad which engaged his attention,  and was even the object of his anxiety and concern: Isabella, queen of  Castile, died about this time and it was foreseen that by this incident  the fortunes of Ferdinand, her husband, would be much affected. The king  was not only attentive to the fate of his ally, and watchful lest the  general system of Europe should be affected by so important an event;  he also considered the similarity of his own situation with that of  Ferdinand, and regarded the issue of these transactions as a precedent  for himself. Joan, the daughter of Ferdinand by Isabella, was married to  the archduke Philip, and being, in right of her mother, heir of Castile,  seemed entitled to dispute with Ferdinand the present possession of that  kingdom. Henry knew that, notwithstanding his own pretensions by the  house of Lancaster, the greater part of the nation was convinced of  the superiority of his wife's title; and he dreaded lest the prince  of Wales, who was daily advancing towards manhood, might be tempted by  ambition to lay immediate claim to the crown. By his perpetual attention  to depress the partisans of the York family, he had more closely united  them into one party, and increased their desire of shaking off that  yoke under which they had so long labored, and of taking every advantage  which his oppressive government should give his enemies against him.  And as he possessed no independent force like Ferdinand, and governed  a kingdom more turbulent and unruly, which he himself by his narrow  politics had confirmed in factious prejudices, he apprehended that his  situation would prove in the issue still more precarious.    Nothing at first could turn out more contrary to the king's wishes than  the transactions in Spain. Ferdinand, as well as Henry, had become very  unpopular, and from a like cause, his former exactions and impositions;  and the states of Castile discovered an evident resolution of preferring  the title of Philip and Joan.    {1506.} In order, to take advantage of these favorable dispositions, the  archduke, now king of Castile, attended by his consort, embarked for  Spain during the winter season; but meeting with a violent tempest in  the Channel, was obliged to take shelter in the harbor of Weymouth. Sir  John Trenchard, a gentleman of authority in the county of Dorset,  hearing of a fleet upon the coast, had assembled some forces; and being  joined by Sir John Cary, who was also at the head of an armed body, he  came to that town. Finding that Philip, in order to relieve his sickness  and fatigue, was already come ashore, he invited him to his house; and  immediately despatched a messenger to inform the court of this important  incident. The king sent in all haste the earl of Arundel to compliment  Philip on his arrival in England, and to inform him that he intended to  pay him a visit in person, and to give him a suitable reception in his  dominions. Philip knew that he could not now depart without the king's  consent; and therefore, for the sake of despatch, he resolved to  anticipate his visit, and to have an interview with him at Windsor.  Henry received him with all the magnificence possible, and with all the  seeming cordiality; but he resolved, notwithstanding, to draw some  advantage from this involuntary visit paid him by his royal guest.    Edmond de la Pole, earl of Suffolk, nephew to Edward IV. and brother to  the earl of Lincoln, slain in the battle of Stoke, had some years before  killed a man in a sudden fit of passion, and had been obliged to apply  to the king for a remission of the crime. The king had granted his  request; but, being little indulgent to all persons connected with the  house of York, he obliged him to appear openly in court and plead his  pardon. Suffolk, more resenting the affront than grateful for the favor,  had fled into Flanders, and taken shelter with his aunt, the duchess  of Burgundy; but being promised forgiveness by the king, he returned to  England, and obtained a new pardon. Actuated, however, by the natural  inquietude of his temper and uneasy from debts which he had contracted  by his great expense at Prince Arthur's wedding, he again made an  elopement into Flanders. The king, well acquainted with the general  discontent which prevailed against his administration neglected not this  incident, which might become of importance, and he employed his usual  artifices to elude the efforts of his enemies. He directed Sir Robert  Curson, governor of the castle of Hammes, to desert his charge, and to  insinuate himself into the confidence of Suffolk, by making him a tender  of his services. Upon information secretly conveyed by Curson, the  king seized William Courtney, eldest son to the earl of Devonshire, and  married to the lady Catharine, sister of the queen; William de la Pole,  brother to the earl of Suffolk; Sir James Tyrrel, and Sir James Windham,  with some persons of inferior quality; and he committed them to custody.  Lord Abergavenny and Sir Thomas Green were also apprehended; but were  soon after released from their confinement. William de la Pole was long  detained in prison: Courtney was attainted, and, though not executed, he  recovered not his liberty during the king's lifetime. But Henry's chief  severity fell upon Sir James Windham and Sir James Tyrrel, who were  brought to their trial, condemned, and executed: the fate of the latter  gave general satisfaction, on account of his participation in the murder  of the young princes, sons of Edward IV. Notwithstanding these  discoveries and executions, Curson was still able to maintain his credit  with the earl of Suffolk: Henry, in order to remove all suspicion, had  ordered him to be excommunicated, together with Suffolk himself, for his  pretended rebellion. But after that traitor had performed all the  services expected from him, he suddenly deserted the earl, and came over  to"]]]
