And as has been shown, in the case of the  three chief so-called racial poisons, alcohol, syphilis and lead, the  evidence is not great. We are thus in a position to state that, from the  eugenists' point of view, the _origination_ of degeneracy, by some  direct action of the germ-plasm, is a contingency that hardly needs to  be reckoned with. Even in case the evidence were much stronger than it  is, the damage done may only be a physiological or chemical induction,  the effects of which will wear off in a few generations; rather than a  radical change in the hereditary constituents of the germ-plasm. The  germ-plasm is so carefully isolated and guarded that it is almost  impossible to injure it, except by treatment so severe as to kill it  altogether; and the degeneracy with which eugenists are called on to  deal is a degeneracy which is running along from generation to  generation and which, when once stopped by the cessation of  reproduction, is in little danger of being originated anew through some  racial poison.    Through these facts, the problem of race betterment is not only  immensely simplified, but it is clearly shown to be more a matter for  treatment by the biologist, acting through eugenics, than for the  optimistic improver of the environment.    There is another way in which it is widely believed that some such  result as a direct influence of the germ-plasm can be produced: that is  through the imaginary process known as maternal impression, prenatal  influence, etc. Belief in maternal impressions is no novelty. In the  book of Genesis[24] Jacob is described as making use of it to get the  better of his tricky father-in-law. Some animal breeders still profess  faith in it as a part of their methods of breeding: if they want a black  calf, for instance, they will keep a white cow in a black stall, and  express perfect confidence that her offspring will resemble midnight  darkness. It is easy to see that this method, if it \"works,\" would be a  potent instrument for eugenics. And it is being recommended for that  reason. Says a recent writer, who professes on the cover of her book to  give a \"complete and intelligent summary of all the principles of  eugenics\":    \"Too much emphasis can not be placed upon the necessity of young people  making the proper choice of mates in marriage; yet if the production of  superior children were dependent upon that one factor, the outlook would  be most discouraging to prospective fathers and mothers, for weak traits  of character are to be found in all. But when young people learn that by  a conscious endeavor to train themselves, they are thereby training  their unborn children, they can feel that there is some hope and joy in  parentage; that it is something to which they can look forward with  delight and even rapture; then they will be inspired to work hard to  attain the best and highest that there is in them, leading the lives  that will not only be a blessing to themselves, but to their succeeding  generation.\"    The author of this quotation has no difficulty in finding supporters.  Many physicians and surgeons, who are supposed to be trained in  scientific methods of thought, will indorse what she says. The author of  one of the most recent and in many respects admirable books on the care  of babies, is almost contemptuous in her disdain for those who think  otherwise:    \"Science wrangles over the rival importance of heredity and environment,  but we women know what effects prenatal influence works on children.\"  \"The woman who frets brings forth a nervous child. The woman who rebels  generally bears a morbid child.\" \"Self-control, cheerfulness and love  for the little life breathing in unison with your own will practically  insure you a child of normal physique and nerves.\"    Such statements, backed up by a great array of writers and speakers whom  the layman supposes to be scientific, and who think themselves  scientific, can not fail to influence strongly an immense number of  fathers and mothers. If they are truly scientific statements, their  general acceptance must be a great good.    But think of the misplaced effort if these widespread statements are  false!    Is there, or is there not, a short cut to race betterment? Everyone  interested in the welfare of the race must feel the necessity of getting  at the truth in the case; and the truth can be found only by rigorously  scientific thought.    Let us turn to the observed facts. This sample is taken from the health  department of a popular magazine, quite recently issued:    \"Since birth my body has been covered with scales strikingly resembling  the surface of a fish. My parents and I have expended considerable money  on remedies and specialists without deriving any permanent benefit. I  bathe my entire body with hot water daily, using the best quality of  soap. The scales fall off continually. My brother, who is younger than  myself, is afflicted with the same trouble, but in a lesser degree. My  sister, the third member of the family, has been troubled only on the  knees and abdomen. My mother has always been quite nervous and  susceptible to any unusual mental impression. She believes that she  marked me by craving fish, and preferring to clean them herself. During  the prenatal life of my brother, she worried much lest she might mark  him in the same way. In the case of my sister she tried to control her  mind.\"[25]    Another is taken from a little publication which is devoted to  eugenics.[26] As a \"horrible example\" the editor gives the case of Jesse  Pomeroy, a murderer whom older readers will remember. His father, it  appears, worked in a meat market. Before the birth of Jesse, his mother  went daily to the shop to carry a luncheon to her husband, and her eyes  naturally fell upon the bloody carcases hung about the walls.  Inevitably, the sight of such things would produce bloody thoughts in  the mind of the unborn child!    These are extreme cases; we quote from a medieval medical writer another  case that carries the principle to its logical conclusion: A woman saw a  Negro,--at that time a rarity in Europe. She immediately had a sickening  suspicion that her child would be born with a black skin. To obviate the  danger, she had a happy inspiration--she hastened home and washed her  body all over with warm water. When the child appeared, his skin was  found to be normally white--except between the fingers and toes, where  it was black. His mother had failed to wash herself thoroughly in those  places!    Of course, few of the cases now credited are as gross as this, but the  principle involved remains the same.    We will take a hypothetical case of a common sort for the sake of  clearness: the mother receives a wound on the arm; when her child is  born it is found to have a scar of some sort at about the same place on  the corresponding arm. Few mothers would fail to see the result of a  maternal impression here. But how could this mark have been transmitted?  This is not a question of the transmission of acquired characters  through the germ-plasm, or anything of that sort, for the child was  already formed when the mother was injured. One is obliged, therefore,  to believe that the injury was in some way transmitted through the  placenta, the only connection between the mother and the unborn child;  and that it was then reproduced in some way in the child.    Here is a situation which, examined in the cold light of reason, puts a  heavy enough strain on the credulity. Such an influence can reach the  embryo only through the blood of the mother. Is it conceivable to any  rational human being, that a scar, or what not, on the mother's body can  be dissolved in her blood, pass through the placenta into the child's  circulation, and then gather itself together into a definite scar on the  infant's arm?    There is just as much reason to expect the child to grow to resemble the  cow on whose milk it is fed after birth, as to expect it to grow to  resemble its mother, because of prenatal influence, as the term is  customarily used, for once development has begun, the child draws  nothing more than nourishment from its mother.    Of course we are accustomed to the pious rejoinder that man must not  expect to understand all the mysteries of life; and to hear vague talk  about the wonder of wireless telegraphy. But wireless telegraphy is  something very definite and tangible--there is little mystery about it.  Waves of a given frequency are sent off, and caught by an instrument  attuned to the same frequency. How any rational person can support a  belief in maternal impressions by such an analogy, if he knows anything  about anatomy and physiology, passes comprehension.    Now we are far from declaring that a reason can be found for everything  that happens. Science does not refuse belief in an observed fact merely  because it is unexplainable. But let us examine this case of maternal  impressions a little further. What can be learned of the time element?    Immediately arises the significant fact that most of the marks,  deformities and other effects which are credited to prenatal influence  must on this hypothesis take place at a comparatively late period in the  antenatal life of the child. The mother is frightened by a dog; the  child is born with a dog-face. If it be asked when her fright occurred,  it is usually found that it was not earlier than the third month, more  likely somewhere near the sixth.    But it ought to be well known that the development of all the main parts  of the body has been completed at the end of the second month. At that  time, the mother rarely does more than suspect the coming of the child,  and events which she believes to \"mark\" the child, usually occur after  the fourth or fifth month, when the child is substantially formed, and  it is"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/19562"],[0,"Napoleon and the Queen of Prussia (#16)"],[1,"tears. I am  weeping for the downfall of my house--the loss of that glory with which  your ancestors and their generals crowned the Hohenzollern dynasty, and  the splendor of which extended over the whole of Prussia--nay, over all  Germany. That glory has, I say, departed forever. Fate has destroyed in  a day a structure in the erection of which great men had been engaged  for two centuries. There is no longer a Prussian state, a Prussian army,  and Prussian honor! Ah! my sons, you are old enough to comprehend and  appreciate the events now befalling us; at a future time, when your  mother will be no more among the living, remember this unhappy hour.  Shed tears for me, as I do for the ruin of our country! But listen,\" she  added, and her eyes beamed with enthusiasm, \"do not content yourselves  with shedding tears! Act, develop your strength. Prussia's genius,  perhaps, will favor you. Then deliver your nation from the disgrace and  humiliation in which it is at present grovelling! Try to recover the now  eclipsed fame of your ancestors, as your great-grandfather, the great  elector, once avenged, at Fehrbellin, the defeats of his father against  the Swedes. Let not the degeneracy of the age carry you away, my sons;  become men and heroes. Should you lack this ambition, you would be  unworthy of the name of princes and grandsons of Frederick the Great.  But if, in spite of all efforts, you should fail in restoring the former  grandeur of the state, then seek death as Prince Louis Ferdinand sought  it!\"          CHAPTER VIII.    NAPOLEON IN POTSDAM.      The unheard-of and never-expected event had taken place; the son of the  Corsican lawyer, the general of the Revolution, had defeated the  Prussian army, compelled the royal family to flee to the eastern  provinces, and now made his triumphal entry into their capital! On the  afternoon of the 24th of October he arrived in Potsdam; the royal palace  had to open its doors to him; the royal servants had to receive him as  reverentially as though he had been their sovereign!    Napoleon was now master of Prussia as well as of all Germany. But his  classic face remained as cold and calm in these days of proud triumph as  it had been in the days of adversity. His successes seemed to surprise  him as little as his early misfortunes had discouraged him. When  ascending the broad carpeted staircase, he turned to Duroc, his grand  marshal and beckoned him to his side. \"Just notice, grand marshal,\" he  said, in so loud a voice that it resounded through the palace, \"just  notice the strange coincidence. If I remember rightly, it is just a year  to-day since the fine-looking Emperor Alexander of Russia arrived here  in Potsdam, and paid a visit to the queen. Please ask the steward who  received us at the foot of the stairs, whether it is not so.\"    Duroc went away, and soon returned with the answer that his majesty had  not been mistaken; it was just a year to-day since the Emperor of Russia  arrived in Potsdam.    A faint smile overspread Napoleon's face. \"I will occupy the same rooms  which Alexander then occupied,\" he said, passing on.    Duroc hastened back, to give the necessary orders. Napoleon walked down  the corridor with ringing, soldier-like footsteps, followed by his  marshals, and entered the large portrait-gallery of the Prussian  monarchs, who looked down on him with grave eyes.    The emperor paused in the middle of the hall and glanced over the  portraits with a gloomy air. \"All those men had a high opinion of  themselves,\" he said, in a sullen tone; \"they were proud of their high  birth and of their royal crown, and yet death has trampled them all in  the dust. I will now take upon myself the task of death: I will  annihilate this Prussia which dared to take up arms against me, and who  knows whether this gallery of Prussian kings will not close with  Frederick William III.? Nothing on earth is lasting, and sovereigns  now-a-days fall from their thrones as over-ripe apples from trees. The  crown of Prussia fell to the ground on the battle-fields of Jena and  Auerstadt!\"    The portraits of the Prussian rulers looked down silently on the  triumphant conqueror, and neither his scornful voice, nor the haughty  glances with which he contemplated them, disturbed their tranquillity.  Not a voice answered these arrogant and insulting words; the marshals  stood silent and respectful, and still seemed to listen to the voice of  the oracle which had just announced to the portraits of the royal  ancestors of the present king the downfall of their house. But  Napoleon's brow, which had momentarily beamed with proud thoughts, was  again clouded. Joining his hands on his back, he crossed the hall to the  large central window, from which there was a fine and extensive view of  the lawn, with its old trees and splendid statues, and beyond, of the  Havel and its hilly banks. He gazed gloomily at this landscape, then  turned and looked again at the pictures, but only for a moment, as  though he would threaten them once more, and make them feel again the  angry glance of him who had come to dethrone their descendant and  appropriate his crown. Then he fixed his eyes on the portrait of a  handsome woman whose large blue eyes seemed to gaze at him, and her  crimson lips to greet him with a winning smile. Quite involuntarily, and  as if attracted by the beauty of this likeness, he approached and  contemplated it long and admiringly.    \"Truly,\" he said, \"that is a charming creature. That lady must have been  wondrously lovely, and at the same time surpassingly graceful and  high-spirited.\"    \"Sire,\" said Duroc, who had followed him and overheard his words, \"sire,  she is still wondrously lovely, and, as your majesty says, surpassingly  graceful and high-spirited. It is the portrait of Queen Louisa of  Prussia.\"    A dark expression mantled Napoleon's face, and, bending an angry glance  on Duroc, he said, \"It is well known that you were always foolishly in  love with the Queen of Prussia, and, according to your statement, one  might believe there was no woman in the whole world so beautiful as she  is.\" He turned his back on the painting and stepped to the next one:  \"And this, then, doubtless, is Frederick William III.?\"    \"Yes, sire, it is the portrait of the reigning king.\"    \"Of the reigning king?\" repeated the emperor, with a scornful smile. \"It  is a very good-natured face,\" he added, looking at the full-sized  portrait; \"and as I behold his gentle, timid air, I comprehend that he  allows himself to be directed by advisers, and follows the will of  others rather than his own. But this little King of Prussia is taller  than I thought!\"    \"Sire, he is about as tall as the Grand-duke of Berg,\" said Duroc.    \"As Murat?\" asked Napoleon. \"It never seemed to me that he was as tall  as that. Is not Murat of my own height?\"    \"No, sire, he is higher than you!\"    \"You mean he is taller than I,\" said Napoleon, shrugging his shoulders.  \"Height of stature is of no consequence. Frederick II. was much smaller  than his grand-nephew, and yet he was the greatest of Prussia's kings.  We will afterward pay him a visit at Sans-souci. Until then, adieu,  gentlemen. Come, Duroc, conduct me to the rooms of the Emperor  Alexander!\"    He greeted the marshals with a quick nod, and then followed Duroc into  the long suite of halls and brilliant rooms which, only a year ago, had  been newly decorated and furnished with royal magnificence for the  reception of the czar.    \"These kings and princes 'by the grace of God' live here very  pleasantly,\" muttered Napoleon in an undertone; \"they know better how to  build and furnish their residences than to preserve them to their  children. Well, I am a good architect, and have come to reconstruct the  royal palace of Prussia. Do you think, Duroc, those ingrates will thank  me for it?\"    \"They will see that the lion must have his share,\" said Duroc, \"and they  will, doubtless, be thankful if any thing is left to them. Sire, here we  are in the czar's bedroom! The steward told me every thing was arranged  in it precisely the same as in the days when the Russian emperor was  here. Nobody has slept in this bed since.\"    \"I must sleep in it,\" said Napoleon, quickly, \"and I believe I shall  sleep in the royal Prussian palace, and in the bed of the Russian  emperor, as comfortably as I did in the Tuileries and in the bed of  Louis XVI.\"    He threw his small three-cornered hat with a contemptuous gesture on the  bed, which was surmounted by a velvet canopy, embroidered with gold, and  then, his arms crossed behind him, commenced slowly pacing the room.  Duroc dared not disturb him, and turned toward the paintings and  engravings hanging on the walls. The emperor walked a long while gravely  and musingly; his brow grew more clouded, and he pressed his lips more  firmly together. Suddenly he paused before Duroc, and, being alone,  spoke to him no longer in the tone of a master, but with the  unreservedness of a friend.    \"Legitimacy is a terrible power, Duroc,\" said he, hastily; \"it is what I  cannot vanquish with all my cannon. Sovereigns and princes know it full  well, and that is the reason of their obstinacy. They oppose their  ancestors to my victorious eagles, and when, by virtue of my right as  conqueror, I enter their palaces and take possession of them, I find  there the proud company of their forefathers, who seem to look  scornfully down on me, and tell me, 'You are after all but an intruder  and usurper, while we are and shall remain here the rightful owners.' I  am sick and tired of playing this part of usurper. I shall overthrow all  dynasties, expel all legitimate sovereigns--and there shall be no other  throne than mine. I shall be at least the first legitimate monarch of  the new era!\"    \"And expelled princes will sit in some nook of your immense empire,\"  said Duroc, laughing, \"and sing to the people the same song of  legitimacy;"]]]
