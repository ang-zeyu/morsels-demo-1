The fangs with which the spider seizes its prey are hollow,  and emit a venomous fluid into the body of the victim, which speedily  benumbs and kills it. In Palestine and other countries a kind of spider  is found which is entirely nocturnal in its habits, and never either  hunts or feeds in daylight, but makes itself a little home, where it  abides safely till sunset. It is called the trap-door spider, from the  curious way in which it protects the entrance to its nest. It bores a  hole in the dry earth of a bank a foot or more in depth, lines the hole  with silk, and forms a lid, or trap-door, which secures the spider from  all intruders. I have one of these nests in which the door is a  wonderful piece of mechanism, quite round and flat, about as large as a  threepenny piece, made of layers of fine earth moistened and worked  together with silk, so that it is tough and elastic and cannot crumble.  The hinge is made of very tough silk, and is so springy that when opened  it closes directly with a snap. The outside is disguised with bits of  moss, glued on so that no one can see where the door is. The only way of  opening it is with a pin, and even then the spider will hold on inside  with his claws, so that it is not easy to overcome his resistance.  Amongst some insects sent to me from Los Angelos is a huge \"Mygale,\" a  hairy monster of very uninviting aspect. When its legs are outspread it  measures nearly six inches across, and one can well believe the stories  one hears of its killing small birds if it finds them on their nests. A  gentleman living in Bermuda is said to have tamed a spider of the  species \"Mygale,\" and made it live upon his bed-curtain and rid him of  the flies and mosquitoes which disturbed his nightly rest. He thus  describes this remarkable pet: \"I fed him with flies for a few days,  until he began to find himself in very comfortable quarters, and thought  of spinning a nest and making his home. This he did by winding himself  round and round, combing out the silk from the spinnerets at the end of  his body till he had made a nest as large as a wine-glass, in which he  sat motionless until he saw a fly get inside our gauzy tent; then I  could fancy I saw his eyes twinkle as his victim buzzed about, till,  when it was within a yard or so of him, he took one spring and the fly  was in his forceps, and another leap took him back to his den, where he  soon finished the savoury morsel. Sometimes he would bound from side to  side of the bed and seize a mosquito at every spring, resting only a  moment on the net to swallow it. In another corner of the room was the  nest of a female Mygale of the same species. She spun some beautiful  little silk bags, larger than a thimble, of tough yellow silk, in each  of which she laid more than a dozen eggs. When these hatched the young  spiders used to live on her back until they were old enough to hunt for  themselves. I kept my useful friend on my bed for more than a year and a  half, when, unfortunately, a new housemaid spied his pretty brown house,  pulled it down, and crushed under her black feet my poor companion.\"  This kind of spider, or an allied species, captures large butterflies in  the tropical woods by hanging strong silken noozes from branches of  trees, and they have been seen to kill small birds by this method. One  of our British spiders lives under water in a dome-like cell of silk,  which is filled with air like a diving-bell by the spider carrying down  successive globules of air between its legs, which it liberates under  the dome until it is filled; and the young are hatched there.    The spider, on its way through the water, never gets wet. It is hairy,  and is enveloped in a bubble of air, in which it moves about protected  from wet and well supplied with air to breathe. As the spider's supply  of food is always precarious, they are able to live a long time without  eating. One is known to have lived eighteen months corked up in a  phial, where it could obtain no food; but though thus able to fast, the  spider is a voracious feeder, and will eat his own kith and kin when  hard pressed by hunger.    I believe it is now thought that the spider of the Scriptures was a kind  of spiny lizard called the Gecko. One of this species was sent to me  from California, and lived for a few weeks, but as nothing would induce  it to eat, to my great regret it pined and died. It was about as large  as an ordinary full-grown toad, of a speckled grey colour, with rich  brown markings, its head something like a lizard, with large thorny  projections which extended all along the spine. The feet were very  remarkable, each toe being furnished with a sucker which enabled the  Gecko to walk with perfect ease in any position on a wall or pane of  glass without losing its hold; and travellers say that it is a frequent  inmate of Eastern houses, and may be seen catching flies as it creeps  along walls and ceilings.    Many kinds of spiders run with ease upon the surface of ponds and  ditches, and one forms a kind of raft of a few dead leaves woven  together, on which it sits and is blown by the wind hither and thither,  and thus is enabled to prey upon various aquatic insects.    The surface of grass lawns may be seen on autumnal mornings covered with  tiny webs gemmed with dew. We may therefore estimate the immense number  of flies captured by these traps so thickly spread over the grass, and  see in them another proof of the adaptation of each created thing for  its special purpose, and how wonderfully the balance of nature is  maintained, so that one creature keeps another in check, and all work  harmoniously together, according to the will of our great Creator.    [Illustration]          [Illustration]    TAME BUTTERFLIES.      In _The Century_, for June, 1883, Mr. Gosse described a monument, in  which the sculptor had carved a child holding out her hand for  butterflies to perch on. He went on to say that this was criticised as  improbable, even by so exact an observer as the late Lord Tennyson. It  may therefore be of some interest to record the following facts from my  personal experience.    One summer I watched the larvae of the swallow-tailed butterfly through  their different stages, and reserved two chrysalides to develop into  the perfect insect. In due time one of these fairy-like creatures came  out. I placed it in a small Indian cage, made of fine threads of bamboo.  A carpet of soft moss and a vase of flowers in the centre made a  pleasant home for my tiny \"Psyche.\"    I found that she greatly enjoyed a repast of honey; when some was placed  on a leaf within her reach, she would uncoil her long proboscis and draw  up the sweet food with great apparent enjoyment.    She was so tame that it became my habit, once or twice a day, to take  her on my finger; and while I walked in the garden she would take short  flights hither and thither, but was always content to mount upon my hand  again. She would come on my finger of her own accord, and, if the day  was bright, would remain there as long as I had patience to carry her,  with her wings outspread, basking in the sunbeams, which appeared to  convey exquisite delight to the delicate little creature.    I never touched her beautiful wings. She never fluttered or showed any  wish to escape, but lived three weeks of tranquil life in her tiny  home; and then having, as I suppose, reached the limit of butterfly  existence, she quietly ceased to live.    On the day of her death the other butterfly emerged, and lived for the  same length of time. Both were equally tame, but the second showed more  intelligence, for she discovered that by folding her wings together she  could easily walk between the slender bars of the cage; and having done  so she would fly to a window, and remain there basking in the sun,  folding and unfolding her wings with evident enjoyment, until I  presented my finger, when she would immediately step upon it and be  carried back to her cage.    The tameness of these butterflies I ascribed in great measure to the  fact of their having been hatched from chrysalides, and having therefore  never known the sweets of liberty. I often wondered if really wild  specimens could be won by gentle kindness and made happy in confinement,  and one bright summer's day I resolved to try. A \"Painted Lady\" had been  seen in the garden the day before, and I soon caught sight of her making  rapid flights from one bed of flowers to another, and when resting for  a few minutes, folding and unfolding her wings on the gravel path, I  crept slowly up to her with a drop of honey on my finger to try and make  friends; but my \"lady\" was coy, \"she would and she wouldn't,\" and after  letting me come within a few inches with my tempting repast, she floated  away, out of sight, and I feared she would not be willing to give me  another chance; however, I waited quietly, and in a few minutes she  alighted at a little distance. I again drew near very slowly, and again  she sailed away, but the third time she gained confidence enough to  reach out her proboscis and taste the honey, and finally crept upon my  finger. I very gently placed the light bamboo cage over her and brought  her indoors; she, all the while, entranced with the sweet food, remained  quietly on my finger, and when satisfied, crept upon a flower in the  middle of the cage, and after a few flutterings round her cage seemed  content and folded her delicate wings to rest. Whilst engaged in her  capture I had observed a \"Red Admiral\" hovering over some dahlias, and  thinking \"Cynthia\"[2] might like a companion, I tried my blandishments  upon him. I had not much hope of success, for though a bold, fearless  fellow, he is very wary, and his powerful wings bear him away in swift  flight when alarmed. Many a circle did I make around that dahlia bed!  \"Admiral\" always preferred"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/21137"],[0,"Parkhurst Boys, and Other Stories of School Life (#16)"],[1,"to jump, whether he missed or no.  Jump  he did, and, to our unbounded delight, just cleared the bar--so narrowly  that it almost shook as he skimmed over it.  That was the end of the  high jump; for though both attempted the 5 foot 5 inches, neither  accomplished it, and the contest was declared to be a dead heat.    After this several unimportant races followed, which I need hardly  describe.  Number 12 on the list was getting near, and I was beginning  to feel a queer, hungry sort of sensation which I didn't exactly like.  However, the mile was to be run before our turn came, and that would  give me time to recover.    For this race we had many of us looked with a curious interest, on  account of the new boy, of whom I have spoken, being one of the  competitors in it.  He didn't look a likely sort of fellow to win a  race, certainly, for he was slightly bow-legged and thick-set, and what  seemed to us a much more ominous sign, was not even arrayed in flannels,  but in an ordinary white shirt and light cloth trousers.  However, he  took his place very confidently at the starting-post, together with  three rivals, wearing respectively black, red, and yellow for their  colours.    The start for a mile race is not such a headlong affair as for a hundred  yards, and consequently at the word \"Off!\" there was comparatively  little excitement among us spectators.    Yellow went to the front almost immediately, with red and black close  behind, while the new boy seemed to confirm our unfavourable impression  by keeping considerably in the rear.  The mile was divided into three  laps round the field, and at the end of the first the positions of the  four were the same as at starting.  But it was soon evident yellow was  not destined to continue his lead, for before the half distance was  accomplished, red and black, who all along had been neck and neck, were  up to him and past him, and by the end of the lap the new boy had also  overtaken him.    And now we became considerably more interested in the progress of this  new boy, who, it suddenly occurred to us, seemed to be going very  easily, which was more than could be said of red, who was dropping a  little to the rear of black.  A big boy near me said, \"That fellow's got  the wind of a balloon,\" and I immediately began to think he was not far  wrong.  For in this third lap, when two of the others were slacking  pace, and when the third was only holding his own, the new boy freshened  up remarkably.  We could watch him crawl up gradually nearer and nearer  to red, till a shout proclaimed him to be second in the running.  But  black was still well ahead, and in the short space left, as the big boy  near me said, \"He could hardly collar his man.\"    But see!  The fellow is positively beginning to tear along!  He seems  fresher than when he started.  \"Look out.  Black!\" shout twenty voices.  All very well to say, \"Look out!\"  Black is used up, and certainly  cannot respond to this tremendous spurt.  Thirty yards from home the new  boy is up to his man, and before the winning-post is reached he is a  clear ten yards ahead.    \"Bellows did it,\" said the big boy; \"look at his chest\"; and then for  the first time I noticed where the secret of this hero's triumph lay.    But, horrors! the next race is Number 12, and Slipshaw and I scuttle off  as hard as we can go, to get ready.    How miserable I felt then!  I hated athletic sports, and detested  \"three-legged races.\"  As we emerged from the tent, we and the other two  couples, ambling along on our respective three legs, a shout of laughter  greeted our appearance.  I, for one, didn't see anything to laugh at,  just then.    \"Adams,\" said Slipshaw, as we reached the starting-place, \"take it easy,  old man, and mind you don't go over.\"    \"All right,\" said I, feeling very much inclined to go over at that  instant.  Then that awful starter began his little speech.    \"Are you ready?\" he asked.    \"Not at all,\" inwardly ejaculated I.    \"Off!\" he cried; and almost before I knew where I was, Slipshaw and I  were hopping along on our three legs amid the cheers of the crowd.    \"Steady!\" said he, as I stepped out rather _too_ fast.    Alas! we were last.  The other two couples were pounding along ahead at  a wonderful pace.    \"Steady!\" growled Slipshaw again, as I began to try to run, and nearly  capsized him.    You may laugh, reader, but it was no joke, that three-legged race.  The  others ahead of us showed no signs of flagging; they were going hard,  one couple close at the heels of the other, and we a full five yards  behind.  I was giving one despairing thought to the pots and prizes in  the tent, when a great roar of laughter almost made me forget which foot  to put forward.    What could it be?--and Slipshaw was laughing too!    \"Steady, now,\" he said, \"and come along!\"    The laughter continued, and looking before me, I suddenly detected its  cause.  The leading couple in a moment of over-confidence had attempted  to go too fast, and had come on their noses on the path, and the second  couple, too close behind them, had not had time to avoid the obstacle,  but had plunged headlong on to the top of them!  It was all right now!  Slipshaw and I trotted triumphantly past the prostrate heap, and after  all won our prize!  You may fancy I was too excited to think of much  else after that, except indeed the hurdle race, which was most exciting,  and won most cleverly by Catherall, who, though he came to grief at the  last hurdle, was able to pick himself up in time to rush in and win the  race by a neck from the new boy, whom we found to be almost as good at  jumping as he was at running.    Then followed a two-mile race--rather dull to watch--and with that the  sports were at an end.    Need I say how proudly Slipshaw and I marched up arm-in-arm to receive  the prize for our race, which consisted of a bat for me and a telescope  for my companion?--or how the new boy was cheered?--or how Shute and  Catherall were applauded?    Before I left Parkhurst I was an old hand at athletic sports, but I  don't think I ever thought any of them so interesting as the day on  which Slipshaw and I, with our legs tied together, came in first in the  three-legged race!        CHAPTER EIGHT.    THE SNEAK.    Sneak!  It's an ugly name, but not ugly enough, believe me, for the  animal it describes.    Like his namesake, the snake, he may be a showy enough looking fellow at  first sight, he may have the knack of wriggling himself into your  acquaintance, and his rattle may amuse you for a time, but wait till he  turns and stings you!    I am at a loss how to describe in a few words what I--and, I expect,  most of us--mean when we talk of a sneak.  He is a mixture of so many  detestable qualities.  There is a large amount of cowardice in his  constitution, and a similar quantity of jealousy; and then there are  certain proportions of falsehood, ingratitude, malice, and officiousness  to complete his ugly anatomy, to say nothing of hypocrisy and self-  conceit.  When all these amiable ingredients are compounded together, we  have our model sneak.    How we detest the fellow! how our toes tingle when he comes our way! how  readily we go a mile round to avoid him! how we hope we may never be  like _him_!    Let me tell you of one we had at our school.  Any one who did not know  Jerry would have said to himself, \"That's a pleasant enough sort of  fellow.\"  For so he seemed.  With a knack of turning up everywhere, and  at all times, he would at first strike the stranger as only an extremely  sociable fellow, who occasionally failed to see he wasn't as welcome as  one would think he deserved to be.  But wait a little.  Presently he'd  make up to you, and become very friendly.  In your pleasure at finding  some one to talk to after coming away from home to a new and lonely  place, you will, in the innocence of your heart, grow confidential, and  tell him all your secrets.  You will perhaps tell him to whom your  sister is engaged; how much pocket-money your father allows you.  You'll  show him a likeness of the little cousin you are over head and ears in  love with, and tell him about the cake your old nurse has packed up  among the schoolbooks in your trunk.  He takes the greatest interest in  the narration; you feel quite happy to have had a good talk about the  dear home, and you go to bed to dream of your little sweetheart and your  new friend.    In the morning, when you wake, there is laughter going on in the beds  round you.  As you sit up and rub your eyes, and wonder where you are--  it's all so different from home--you hear one boy call out to another--    \"I say, Tom, don't you wish you had a nurse to make you cakes?\"    That somehow seems pointed at you, though addressed to another, for all  the other boys look round at you and grin.    \"Wouldn't I?\" replies the Tom appealed to.  \"Only when a chap's in love,  you know, he's no good at cakes.\"    \"Cakes!\" \"in love!\"  They must be making fun of you; but however do they  know so much about you?  Listen!  \"If _I_ had a sister, I'd take care  _she_ didn't go and marry a butter-man, Jack, wouldn't you?\"    It must be meant for you; for you had told Jerry the evening before that  your sister was going to marry a provision merchant!  Then all of a  sudden it flashes upon you.  You have been betrayed!  The secrets you  have whispered in private have become the property of the entire school;  and the friend you fancied so genial and sympathising has made your  open-hearted frankness the subject of a blackguard jest, and exposed you  to all the agony of schoolboy ridicule!    With quivering lips and flushed face, half shame, half anger, you dash  beneath the clothes, and wish the floor would open beneath you.  When  the getting-up bell sounds, you slink into your clothes amid the titters  of your companions.  It is weeks before you hear the end of your nurse,  your pocket money, your sister, and"]]]
