Gardner and the twenty men who had been left at  Lewis gun School at Bakaritza, and orders to proceed on to Seletskoe.    The Red Guards hearing of the American successes on the railway and  hearing of the approach of this force from the railroad in their rear  went back to Kodish, and on the morning of September 16th \"K\" Company  became a full-fledged member of \"D\" Force to be better known the world  over in the bitterest part of this campaign as the Kodish Force.    Here the doughboys got their baptism of fire when they took over under  fire the outposts of the village of Seletskoe. For the Bolos who had  retreated the week before had told the inhabitants they would be back  and they were making their threat, or promise, as you will have it,  good. For two days and nights the Americans beat off the attacks,  principally through the good work of Sgt. Michael Kinney, the gallant  soldier who fell at Kodish on New Year's Day. Aided by the accurate fire  of the French machine gun section, the \"K\" men inflicted such heavy  penalties that the Reds quit in panic, assassinated their commander and  skurried south thirty miles.  However, this victory was not exploited by  the Allied force. It seems that the commander of the force had sent out  a Russian patrol on the east bank of the Emtsa River which brought back  information that a heavy force of the enemy was operating in the rear of  \"D\" force.    Accordingly Captain Scott ordered a retreat from Seletskoe to Tiogra,  taking up a position on the north bank of the Emtsa River after burning  the bridge to prevent pursuit by the Reds who it was afterwards found  were fleeing in the opposite direction, after having burned another  bridge on the Emtsa further to the south to prevent the Americans from  pursuing them.    An interesting story was often repeated about this funny episode which  was due to the credence given by the British officer to the report of  the highly imaginative Russian patrol.    An English corporal on one of the outposts of Seletskoe was not informed  by Captain Scott of the retreat during the night. Next morning he went  forward and discovered that the Reds had burned their bridge. But when  he went to report that fact he found the village of Seletskoe evacuated  by his own forces, natives also having fled with everything of value  from the samovar to the cow. A few hours later the old corporal appeared  on the other bridgeless bank of the Emtsa across from the \"K\" men who  were digging in and said in a puzzled way, \"I saiy, old chap, wots the  bloody gaime?\"    Of course as soon as an improvised pontoon could be rigged up \"K\"  Company and the rest of the happily informed force were in pursuit again  of the Reds. The bridge was constructed by a detachment of the 310th  American Engineers, who had come up with Col. Henderson, of the famous  \"Black Watch,\" the new commander.    The French machine gunners by this time were badly needed on the  railroad force. In their place came a company of the Russian Officers'  Training Corps.    On September 23rd Seletskoe was again occupied and the Yanks began  improving its defenses, taking much satisfaction in the arrival from  Archangel of Lieut. Ballard's American machine gun platoon. Within two  days also their ranks were greatly strengthened by the arrival of Lieut.  Chappel from Issaka Gorka with the other two platoons of \"K\" company  closely followed by Captain Cherry with \"L\" Company from the Railroad  force.    General Finlayson, whose job it was to take Plesetskaya, now sought to  shove the Kodish force ahead rapidly so as to trap the Reds on the  railroad between the two forces. Accordingly the next morning, September  26th, \"K\" Company and two platoons of \"L\" and the machine gun section  moved south toward Kodish to achieve the mission that had been assigned  to Col. Hazelden. The Bolshevik was found the next morning strongly  entrenched on the other side of the river Emtsa near the burned bridge  and after severe losses suffered in the gaining of a foothold on the  north side of the river by crossing on a raft, the Americans had to dig  in. In fact they lay for over a week in the swamp hanging tenaciously to  their position but unable to advance. Men's feet swelled in their wet  boots till the shoes burst. But still they hung on under the example of  their game old captain, At this time Lieut. Chappel was victim of a Bolo  machine gun while trying to lead a raiding squad up to its capture. Six  others were killed and twenty-four were wounded. Droskies needed for  transportation of supplies and ammunition had to be used to take back  the wounded and sick from exposure to Seletskoe. No \"K\" or \"L\" or \"M.  G.\" man who was there will ever forget those days.    It was obvious that the Kodish force must be augmented. English marines  and a section of Canadian artillery came up. Headquarters was  established in the four-house village of Mejnovsky, eight miles back.  Steady sniping and patrol action was carried on actively by both forces.  Col. Henderson's further attempt to throw a force across the river by  means of a raft was frustrated by the Reds. October 7th Lieut.-Col.  Gavin came up to assume command.    This energetic and keen British officer soon worked out plans for  effecting an advance. Using the American engineers, he soon had a ferry  in use three versts--about two miles--below Mejnovsky.    And on October the 12th \"K\" and \"L\" Companies crossed on that ferry and  marched up the left bank of the Emtsa till within one thousand yards of  the flank of the strong Bolo position, and bivouacked in the swamp for  the night. In the morning Captain Cherry took his company and two  platoons of \"K\" and struck south to pass by the flank and fall upon  Kodish in rear of the enemy who was holding the position in great force  at the river.    The remainder of \"K\" Company moved upon the right of the enemy front  line at the river crossing. At the time Donoghue struck, a frontal  demonstration was made upon the Reds by the English marines and American  machine guns firing across the river and by the Canadian artillery  shelling the woods where the Red reserves were thought to be. The plan  failed because of the inability of Captain Cherry to reach his  objective, on account of the bottomless swamps that he encountered.  Captain Donoghue gained a foot-hold and then was forced to dig in and  during the afternoon repulsed two counter attacks of the Bolos, having  paid for the capture of the two Bolo machine guns by severe losses.    During the night under cover of these two platoons, \"L\" and the English  marines crossed the river, where the Reds had held them so many days.  And during the following day the right of the Bolo position was turned  by a movement through the woods.    But at four o'clock in the afternoon the enemy's second, position, a  mile north of the village, developed surprising strength. In fact, the  Reds counterattacked just at dark and once more the doughboys lay down,  on their arms, in the rain-flooded swamp, where the dark, frosty morning  would find them stiff and ugly customers for the Reds to tackle. In fact  they did rise up and smite the Bolshevik so swiftly that he fled from  his works and left Kodish in such a hurry that he gave no forwarding  address for his mail. Captain Donoghue set up his headquarters in Kodish  and sent detachments out to follow the Reds and to threaten the Red  Shred Makhrenga and Taresevo forces. During this fight, or rather after  it, the Canadians taught our boys their first lesson in looting the  persons of the dead.  Our men had been rather respectful and gentle with  the Bolo dead who were quite numerous on the Emtsa River battlefield.  Can you call a tangle of woods a field? But the Canadians, veterans of  four years fighting, immediately went through the pockets of the dead  for roubles and knives and so forth and even took the boots off the  dead, as they were pretty fair boots.    The officer who reports this says he has often heard of dead men's boots  but had to go to war to actually see them worn.    In passing let it be stated that many a footsore doughboy helped himself  to a dry pair of boots from a dead Red Guard or in winter to a pair of  valenkas, or warm felt boots. One of \"Captain Mike's\" nervy sergeants  protested against being sent back to Seletskoe to get him a new pair of  shoes, for he hated the ill-fitting British army shoe, as all Americans  did, and prevailed upon Donoghue to let him wait a few days till after a  battle when he sure enough helped himself to a fine pair of boots.    One thing the American never did take from the dead Bolo was his Russian  tobacco, for it was worse even than the British issue tobacco. A good  story is told on one of Donoghue's lieutenants. During the excitement of  burning the bridge over the Emtsa at Tiogra, time when the two forces  fled from one another, the officer, greatly fatigued, sat down on the  bridge during the preparations by the men. He was missed later on the  march and the man whom the captain sent back to find the lieutenant  arrived just in time to keep what little hair the popular bald-headed  little officer had from being singed off by the leaping flames. Lieut.  Ryan does not like to be kidded about it.    The morning of the seventeenth of October saw the American forces again  on the advance. Good news had come of the successes on the railroad.    The Kodish force was in the strategic position now to force the Reds to  give up Emtsa and Plesetskaya. But Trotsky's northern army commander  evidently well understood that situation, for he gave strict attention  to this Kodish force of Americans and at the fifteenth verst pole on the  main road his Red Guards held the Americans all day. Again the next day  he made Donoghue's Yanks strive all day. Just at night successful  flanking movements caused"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/22542"],[0,"Jesus the Christ (#16)"],[1,"to Judea, and to enter upon the work of rebuilding  the temple at Jerusalem.[154]    A great company of the exiled Hebrews availed themselves of this  opportunity to return to the lands of their fathers, though many elected  to remain in the country of their captivity, preferring Babylon to  Israel. The \"whole congregation\" of the Jews who returned from the  Babylonian exile were but \"forty and two thousand three hundred and  three score, beside their servants and their maids, of whom there were  seven thousand three hundred thirty and seven.\" The relatively small  size of the migrating nation is further shown by the register of their  beasts of burden.[155] While those who did return strove valiantly to  reestablish themselves as the house of David, and to regain some measure  of their former prestige and glory, the Jews were never again a truly  independent people. In turn they were preyed upon by Greece, Egypt, and  Syria; but about 164-163 B.C., the people threw off, in part at least,  the alien yoke, as a result of the patriotic revolt led by the  Maccabees, the most prominent of whom was Judas Maccabeus. The temple  service, which had been practically abolished through the proscription  of victorious foes, was reestablished.[156] In the year 163 B.C., the  sacred structure was rededicated, and the joyful occasion was thereafter  celebrated in annual festival as the Feast of Dedication.[157] During  the reign of the Maccabees, however, the temple fell into an almost  ruinous condition, more as a result of the inability of the reduced and  impoverished people to maintain it than through any further decline of  religious zeal. In the hope of insuring a greater measure of national  protection, the Jews entered into an unequal alliance with the Romans  and eventually became tributary to them, in which condition the Jewish  nation continued throughout the period of our Lord's ministry. In the  meridian of time Rome was virtually mistress of the world. When Christ  was born Augustus Caesar[158] was emperor of Rome, and the Idumean,  Herod,[159] surnamed the Great, was the vassal king of Judea.    Some semblance of national autonomy was maintained by the Jews under  Roman dominion, and their religious ceremonials were not seriously  interfered with. The established orders in the priesthood were  recognized, and the official acts of the national council, or  Sanhedrin,[160] were held to be binding by Roman law; though the  judicial powers of this body did not extend to the infliction of capital  punishment without the sanction of the imperial executive. It was the  established policy of Rome to allow to her tributary and vassal peoples  freedom in worship so long as the mythological deities, dear to the  Romans, were not maligned nor their altars desecrated.[161]    Needless to say, the Jews took not kindly to alien domination, though  for many generations they had been trained in that experience, their  reduced status having ranged from nominal vassalage to servile bondage.  They were already largely a dispersed people. All the Jews in Palestine  at the time of Christ's birth constituted but a small remnant of the  great Davidic nation. The Ten Tribes, distinctively the aforetime  kingdom of Israel, had then long been lost to history, and the people of  Judah had been widely scattered among the nations.    In their relations with other peoples the Jews generally endeavored to  maintain a haughty exclusiveness, which brought upon them Gentile  ridicule. Under Mosaic law Israel had been required to keep apart from  other nations; they attached supreme importance to their Abrahamic  lineage as children of the covenant, \"an holy people unto the Lord,\"  whom He had chosen \"to be a special people unto himself, above all  people that are upon the face of the earth\".[162] Judah had experienced  the woful effects of dalliance with pagan nations, and, at the time we  are now considering, a Jew who permitted himself unnecessary association  with a Gentile became an unclean being requiring ceremonial cleansing to  free him from defilement. Only in strict isolation did the leaders find  hope of insuring the perpetuity of the nation.    It is no exaggeration to say that the Jews hated all other peoples and  were reciprocally despized and contemned by all others. They manifested  especial dislike for the Samaritans, perhaps because this people  persisted in their efforts to establish some claim of racial  relationship. These Samaritans were a mixed people, and were looked upon  by the Jews as a mongrel lot, unworthy of decent respect. When the Ten  Tribes were led into captivity by the king of Assyria, foreigners were  sent to populate Samaria.[163] These intermarried with such Israelites  as had escaped the captivity; and some modification of the religion of  Israel, embodying at least the profession of Jehovah worship, survived  in Samaria. The Samaritan rituals were regarded by the Jews as  unorthodox, and the people as reprobate. At the time of Christ the  enmity between Jew and Samaritan was so intense that travelers between  Judea and Galilee would make long detours rather than pass through the  province of Samaria which lay between. The Jews would have no dealings  with the Samaritans.[164]    The proud feeling of self-sufficiency, the obsession for exclusiveness  and separation--so distinctively a Jewish trait at that time--was  inculcated at the maternal knee and emphasized in synagog and school.  The Talmud,[165] which in codified form post-dates the time of Christ's  ministry, enjoined all Jews against reading the books of alien nations,  declaring that none who so offended could consistently hope for  Jehovah's favor.[166] Josephus gives his endorsement to similar  injunction, and records that wisdom among the Jews meant only  familiarity with the law and ability to discourse thereon.[167] A  thorough acquaintanceship with the law was demanded as strongly as other  studies were discountenanced. Thus the lines between learned and  unlearned came to be rigidly drawn; and, as an inevitable consequence  those who were accounted learned, or so considered themselves, looked  down upon their unscholarly fellows as a class distinct and  inferior.[168]    Long before the birth of Christ, the Jews had ceased to be a united  people even in matters of the law, though the law was their chief  reliance as a means of maintaining national solidarity. As early as four  score years after the return from the Babylonian exile, and we know not  with accuracy how much earlier, there had come to be recognized, as men  having authority, certain scholars afterward known as scribes, and  honored as rabbis[169] or teachers. In the days of Ezra and Nehemiah  these specialists in the law constituted a titled class, to whom  deference and honor were paid. Ezra is designated \"the priest, the  scribe, even a scribe of the words of the commandments of the Lord, and  of his statutes to Israel\".[170] The scribes of those days did valuable  service under Ezra, and later under Nehemiah, in compiling the sacred  writings then extant; and in Jewish usage those appointed as guardians  and expounders of the law came to be known as members of the Great  Synagog, or Great Assembly, concerning which we have little information  through canonical channels. According to Talmudic record, the  organization consisted of one hundred and twenty eminent scholars. The  scope of their labors, according to the admonition traditionally  perpetuated by themselves, is thus expressed: _Be careful in judgment;  set up many scholars, and make a hedge about the law_. They followed  this behest by much study and careful consideration of all traditional  details in administration; by multiplying scribes and rabbis unto  themselves; and, as some of them interpreted the requirement of setting  up many scholars, by writing many books and tractates; moreover, they  made a fence or hedge about the law by adding numerous rules, which  prescribed with great exactness the officially established proprieties  for every occasion.    Scribes and rabbis were exalted to the highest rank in the estimation of  the people, higher than that of the Levitical or priestly orders; and  rabbinical sayings were given precedence over the utterances of the  prophets, since the latter were regarded as but messengers or spokesmen,  whereas the living scholars were of themselves sources of wisdom and  authority. Such secular powers as Roman suzerainty permitted the Jews to  retain were vested in the hierarchy, whose members were able thus to  gather unto themselves practically all official and professional honors.  As a natural result of this condition, there was practically no  distinction between Jewish civil and ecclesiastical law, either as to  the code or its administration. Rabbinism comprized as an essential  element the doctrine of the equal authority of oral rabbinical tradition  with the written word of the law. The aggrandizement implied in the  application of the title \"Rabbi\" and the self-pride manifest in  welcoming such adulation were especially forbidden by the Lord, who  proclaimed Himself the one Master; and, as touching the interpretation  of the title held by some as \"father\", Jesus proclaimed but one Father  and He in heaven: \"But be not ye called Rabbi: for one is your Master,  even Christ; and all ye are brethren. And call no man your father upon  the earth: for one is your Father, which is in heaven. Neither be ye  called masters: for one is your Master, even Christ.\"[171]    The scribes, whether so named or designated by the more distinguishing  appellation, rabbis, were repeatedly denounced by Jesus, because of the  dead literalism of their teachings, and the absence of the spirit of  righteousness and virile morality therefrom; and in such denunciations  the Pharisees are often coupled with the scribes. The judgment of the  Christ upon them is sufficiently expressed by His"]]]
