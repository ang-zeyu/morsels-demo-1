The favourite sites for nests in the  United Provinces seem to be babul trees that grow near borrow pits  alongside the railroad.    In the rainy season two other birds weave nests, which are nearly as  elegant as those woven by the baya. These birds, however, do not nest  in company. They usually build inside bushes, or in long grass.    For this reason they do not lend themselves to observation while at  work so readily as bayas do. The birds in question are the Indian and  the ashy wren-warbler.    The former species brings up two broods in the year. One, as has been  mentioned, in March and the other in the \"rains.\"    The nest of the Indian wren-warbler (_Prinia inornata_) is, except for  its shape and its smaller size, very like that of a weaver-bird. It is  an elongated purse or pocket, closely and compactly woven with fine  strips of grass from 1/40 to 1/20 inch in breadth. The nest is entered  by a hole near the top. Both birds work at the nest, clinging first to  the neighbouring stems of grass or twigs, and later to the nest itself  when this has attained sufficient dimensions to afford them foothold.  They push the ends of the grass in and out just as weaver-birds do.  Like the baya, the Indian wren-warbler does not line its nest. The  eggs are pale greenish-blue, richly marked by various shades of deep  chocolate and reddish-brown. As Hume remarks: \"nothing can exceed the  beauty or variety of markings, which are a combination of bold  blotches, clouds and spots, with delicate, intricately woven lines,  recalling somewhat ... those of our early favourite--the  yellow-hammer.\"    The ashy wren-warbler (_Prinia socialis_) builds two distinct kinds of  nest. One is just like that of the tailor-bird, being formed by sewing  or cobbling together two, three, four or five leaves, and lining the  cup thus formed with down, wool, cotton or other soft material. The  second kind of nest is a woven one. This is a hollow ball with a hole  in the side. The weaving is not so neat as that of the baya and the  Indian wren-warbler. Moreover, several kinds of material are usually  worked into the nest, which is invariably lined.    The building of two totally different types of nest is an interesting  phenomenon, and seems to indicate that under the name _Prinia  socialis_ are classed two different species, which anatomically are so  like one another that systematists are unable to separate them. Both  kinds of nests are found in the same locality and at the same time of  the year. Against the theory that there are two species of ashy  wren-warbler is the fact that there is no difference in appearance  between the eggs found in the two kinds of nest. All eggs are  brick-red or mahogany colour, without any spots or markings.    Many of the Indian cliff-swallows, of which the nests are described in  the calendar for March, bring up a second brood in the \"rains.\"    Needless to state that in the monsoon the tank and the _jhil_ are the  happy hunting grounds of the ornithologist.    In July and August not less than thirty species of waterfowl  nidificate. Floating nests are constructed by sarus cranes, purple  coots and the jacanas. The various species of egrets breed in colonies  in trees in some village not far from a tank; in company with them  spoonbills, cormorants, snake-birds, night-herons and other birds  often nest. The white-breasted waterhen constructs its nursery in a  thicket at the margin of some village pond. The resident ducks are  also busy with their nests. These are in branches of trees, in holes  in trees or old buildings, or on the ground.    When describing the nesting operations of waterfowl in Northern India  it is difficult to apportion these between July and August, for the  eggs of almost all such species are as likely to be found in the one  month as in the other. A few individuals begin to lay in June, the  majority commence in July, but a great many defer operations until  August. There is scarcely an aquatic species of which it can be said:  \"It never lays before August.\" Nor are there many of which it can be  asserted: \"Their eggs are never found after July.\"    Individuals differ in their habit. A retarded monsoon means that the  water-birds begin to nest later than usual. The first fall of the  monsoon rain seems to be the signal for the commencement of nesting  operations, but by no means every pair of birds obeys the signal  immediately.    The nearest approach to a generalisation which it is possible to make  is that the egrets and paddy-birds are usually the first of the  monsoon breeders to begin nest-building, while the spot-billed duck,  the whistling teal and the bronze-winged jacana are the last. In other  words, the eggs of the former are most likely to be found in July and  those of the latter in August.    As the calendar for this month has already attained considerable  dimensions, a description of the nests of all these water-birds is  given in the August calendar. It is, however, necessary to state that  the eggs of the following birds are likely to be found in July: purple  coot, common coot, bronze-winged and pheasant-tailed jacana, black  ibis, white-necked stork, cormorant, snake-bird, cotton teal, comb  duck, spot-billed duck, spoonbill, and the various herons and egrets.          AUGUST      See! the flushed horizon flames intense    With vivid red, in rich profusion streamed    O'er heaven's pure arch. At once the clouds assume    Their gayest liveries; these with silvery beams    Fringed lovely; splendid those in liquid gold,    And speak their sovereign's state. He comes, behold!                                               MALLET.      The transformation scene described in July continues throughout  August. Torrential rain alternates with fierce sunshine. The earth is  verdant with all shades of green. Most conspicuous of these are the  yellowish verdure of the newly-transplanted rice, the vivid emerald of  the young plants that have taken root, the deeper hue of the growing  sugar-cane, and the dark green of the mango topes.    Unless the monsoon has been unusually late in reaching Northern India  the autumn crops are all sown before the first week in August. The  sugar-cane is now over five feet in height. The cultivators are busily  transplanting the better kinds of rice, or running the plough through  fields in which the coarser varieties are growing.    The aloes are in flower. Their white spikes of drooping tulip-like  flowers are almost the only inflorescences to be seen outside gardens  at this season of the year. The mango crop is over, but that of the  pineapples takes its place.    At night-time many of the trees are illumined by hundreds of  fireflies. These do not burn their lamps continuously. Each insect  lets its light shine for a few seconds and then suddenly puts it out.  It sometimes happens that all the fireflies in a tree show their  lights and extinguish them simultaneously and thereby produce a  luminous display which is strikingly beautiful. Fireflies are to be  seen during the greater part of the year, but they are far more  abundant in the \"rains\" than at any other season.    As in July so in August the voices of the birds are rarely heard after  dark. The nocturnal music is now the product of the batrachian band,  ably seconded by the crickets.    During a prolonged break in the rains the frogs and toads are hushed,  except in _jhils_ and low-lying paddy fields. Cessation of the rain,  however, does not silence the crickets.    The first streak of dawn is the signal for the striking up of the  jungle and the spotted owlets. Hard upon them follow the koels and the  brain-fever birds. These call only for a short time, remaining silent  during the greater part of the day. Other birds that lift up their  voices at early dawn are the crow-pheasant, the black partridge and  the peacock. These also call towards dusk. As soon as the sun has  risen the green barbets, coppersmiths, white-breasted kingfishers and  king-crows utter their familiar notes; even these birds are heard but  rarely in the middle of the day, nor have their voices the vigour that  characterised them in the hot weather. Occasionally the brown  rock-chat emits a few notes, but he does so in a half-hearted manner.  In the early days of August the magpie-robins sing at times; their  song, however, is no longer the brilliant performance it was. By the  end of the month it has completely died away.    The Indian cuckoo no more raises its voice in the plains, but the pied  crested-cuckoo continues to call lustily and the pied starlings make a  joyful noise. The oriole's liquid _pee-ho_ is gradually replaced by  the loud _tew_, which is its usual cry at times when it is not  nesting.    The water-birds, being busy at their nests, are of course noisy, but,  with the exception of the loud trumpeting of the sarus cranes, their  vocal efforts are heard only at the _jhil_.    The did-he-do-its, the rollers, the bee-eaters, two or three species  of warblers and the perennial singers complete the avian chorus.    Numbers of rosy starlings are returning from Asia Minor, where they  have reared up their broods. The inrush of these birds begins in July  and continues till October. They are the forerunners of the autumn  immigrants. Towards the end of the month the garganey or blue-winged  teal (_Querquedula circia_), which are the earliest of the migratory  ducks to visit India, appear on the tanks. Along with them comes the  advance-guard of the snipe. The pintail snipe (_Gallinago stenura_)  are invariably the first to appear, but they visit only the eastern  parts of Northern India. Large numbers of them sojourn in Bengal and  Assam. Stragglers appear in the eastern portion of the United  Provinces; in the western districts and in the Punjab this snipe is a  _rara avis_. By the third week in August good bags of pintail snipe  are sometimes obtained"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/18253"],[0,"Discovery of Witches (#16)"],[1,"nces, wee shall neuer bring any thing to good  perfection: for from this Sincke of villanie and mischiefe, haue all  the rest proceeded; as you shall haue them in order.    She was a very old woman, about the age of Fourescore[B_b_] yeares,  and had been a Witch for fiftie yeares. Shee dwelt in the Forrest of  _Pendle_, a vaste place, fitte for her profession: What shee committed  in her time, no man knowes.    Thus liued shee securely for many yeares, brought vp her owne  Children, instructed her Graund-children, and tooke great care and  paines to bring them to be Witches. Shee was a generall agent for the  Deuill in all these partes: no man escaped her, or her Furies, that  euer gaue them any occasion of offence, or denyed them any thing they  stood need of: And certaine it is, no man neere them, was secure or  free from danger.    But God, who had in his diuine prouidence prouided to cut them off,  and roote them out of the Commonwealth, so disposed aboue, that the  Iustices of those partes, vnderstanding by a generall charme and  muttering, the great and vniuersall resort to _Maulking Tower_, the  common opinion, with the report of these suspected people, the  complaint of the Kinges subiectes for the losse of their Children,  Friendes, Goodes, and Cattle, (as there could not be so great Fire  without some Smoake,) sent for some of the Countrey, and tooke great  paynes to enquire after their proceedinges, and courses of life.

Decimo, et Scotiae, Quadragesimo quinto;_  Before _Roger Nowell_ of _Reade_ Esquire, one of his  Maiesties Iustices of the peace within  the sayd Countie, _Viz._    The said _Elizabeth Sowtherns_ confesseth, and sayth; That about  twentie yeares past, as she was comming homeward from begging, there  met her this Examinate neere vnto a Stonepit in _Gouldshey_,[B2_b_1]  in the sayd Forrest of _Pendle_, a Spirit or Deuill in the shape of a  Boy, the one halfe of his Coate blacke, and the other browne, who bade  this Examinate stay, saying to her, that if she would giue him her  Soule, she should haue any thing that she would request. Wherevpon  this Examinat demaunded his name? and the Spirit answered, his name  was _Tibb_:[B2_b_2] and so this Examinate in hope of such gaine as was  promised by the sayd Deuill or _Tibb_, was contented to giue her Soule  to the said Spirit: And for the space of fiue or sixe yeares next  after, the sayd Spirit or Deuill appeared at sundry times vnto her  this Examinate about _Day-light_ Gate,[B2_b_3] alwayes bidding her  stay, and asking her this Examinate what she would haue or doe? To  whom this Examinate replyed, Nay nothing: for she this Examinate said,  she wanted nothing yet. And so about the end of the said sixe yeares,  vpon a Sabboth day in the morning, this Examinate hauing a litle Child  vpon her knee, and she being in a slumber, the sayd Spirit appeared  vnto her in the likenes of a browne Dogg, forcing himselfe to her  knee, to get blood vnder her left Arme: and she being without any  apparrell sauing her Smocke, the said Deuill did get blood vnder her  left arme.[B3_a_1] And this Examinate awaking, sayd, _Iesus saue my  Child_; but had no power, nor could not say, _Iesus saue her selfe_:  wherevpon the Browne Dogge vanished out of this Examinats sight: after  which, this Examinate was almost starke madd for the space of eight  weekes.    And vpon her examination, she further confesseth, and saith. That a  little before Christmas last, this Examinates Daughter hauing been to  helpe _Richard Baldwyns_ Folkes at the Mill: This Examinates Daughter  did bid her this Examinate goe to the sayd _Baldwyns_ house, and aske  him some thing for her helping of his Folkes at the Mill, (as  aforesaid:) and in this Examinates going to the said _Baldwyns_ house,  and neere to the sayd house, she mette with the said _Richard  Baldwyn_; Which _Baldwyn_ sayd to this Examinate, and the said _Alizon  Deuice_[B3_a_3] (who at that time ledde this Examinate, being blinde)  get out of my ground Whores and Witches, I will burne the one of you,  and hang the other.[B3_a_2] To whom this Examinate answered: I care  not for thee, hang thy selfe: Presently wherevpon, at this Examinates  going ouer the next hedge, the said Spirit or Diuell called _Tibb_,  appeared vnto this Examinat, and sayd, _Reuenge thee of him_. To whom,  this Examinate sayd againe to the said Spirit. _Revenge thee eyther of  him, or his._ And so the said Spirit vanished out of her sight, and  she neuer saw him since.    And further this Examinate confesseth, and sayth, that the speediest  way to take a mans life away by Witchcraft, is to make a Picture of  Clay,[B3_b_] like vnto the shape of the person whom they meane to  kill, & dry it thorowly: and when they would haue them to be ill in  any one place more then an other; then take a Thorne or Pinne, and  pricke it in that part of the Picture you would so haue to be ill: and  when you would haue any part of the Body to consume away, then take  that part of the Picture, and burne it. And when they would haue the  whole body to consume away, then take the remnant of the sayd Picture,  and burne it: and so therevpon by that meanes, the body shall die.           *       *       *       *       *    The Confession and Examination  of Anne Whittle _alias_ Chattox, being  Prisoner at _Lancaster_; taken the 19 day of May,  _Annoq; Regni Regis Iacobi Angliae, Decimo:  ac Scotie Quadragesimo quinto_; Before  _William Sandes_ Maior of the Borrough  towne of _Lancaster._    _Iames Anderton_ of _Clayton_, one of his Maiesties Iustices  of Peace within the same County, and _Thomas  Cowell_ one of his Maiesties Coroners in  the sayd Countie of Lancaster,  _Viz._    First, the sayd _Anne Whittle_, alias _Chattox_, sayth, that about  foureteene yeares past she entered, through the wicked perswasions and  counsell of _Elizabeth Southerns_, alias _Demdike_, and was seduced to  condescend & agree to become subiect vnto that diuelish abhominable  profession of Witchcraft: Soone after which, the Deuill appeared vnto  her in the liknes of a Man, about midnight, at the house of the sayd  _Demdike_: and therevpon the sayd _Demdike_ and shee, went foorth of  the said house vnto him; wherevpon the said wicked Spirit mooued this  Examinate, that she would become his Subiect, and giue her Soule vnto  him: the which at first, she refused to assent vnto; but after, by the  great perswasions made by the sayd _Demdike_, shee yeelded to be at  his commaundement and appoyntment: wherevpon the sayd wicked Spirit  then sayd vnto her, that hee must haue one part of her body for him to  sucke vpon; the which shee denyed then to graunt vnto him; and withall  asked him, what part of her body hee would haue for that vse; who  said, hee would haue a place of her right side neere to her ribbes,  for him to sucke vpon: whereunto shee assented.    And she further sayth, that at the same time, there was a thing in the  likenes of a spotted Bitch, that came with the sayd Spirit vnto the  sayd _Demdike_, which then did speake vnto her in this Examinates  hearing, and sayd, that she should haue Gould, Siluer, and worldly  Wealth, at her will.[B4_b_1] And at the same time she saith, there was  victuals, _viz._ Flesh, Butter, Cheese, Bread, and Drinke, and bidde  them eate enough. And after their eating, the Deuill called _Fancie_,  and the other Spirit calling himselfe _Tibbe_, carried the remnant  away: And she sayeth, that although they did eate, they were neuer the  fuller, nor better for the same; and that at their said Banquet, the  said Spirits gaue them light to see what they did, although they  neyther had fire nor Candle light; and that they were both shee  Spirites, and Diuels.    And being further examined how many sundry Person haue been bewitched  to death, and by whom they were so bewitched: She sayth, that one  _Robert Nuter_, late of the _Greene-head_ in _Pendle_, was bewitched  by this Examinate, the said _Demdike_, and Widdow _Lomshawe_, (late of  _Burneley_) now deceased.    And she further sayth, that the said _Demdike_ shewed her, that she  had bewitched to death, _Richard Ashton_, Sonne of _Richard Ashton_ of  _Downeham_ Esquire.[B4_b_2]           *       *       *       *       *    The Examination of Alizon  Deuice, of the Forrest of Pendle, in the County  of _Lancaster_ Spinster, taken at _Reade_ in the said  Countie of _Lancaster_, the xiij. day of  March, _Anno Regni Jacobi Angliae, &c._  _Nono: et Scotiae xlv._    Before _Roger Nowell_ of _Reade_ aforesayd Esquire, one of  his Maiesties Iustices of the Peace within the sayd  Countie, against _Elizabeth Sowtherns_, alias  _Demdike_ her Graund-mother.  _Viz._    The sayd _Alizon Deuice_ sayth, that about two yeares agon, her  Graund-mother (called _Elizabeth Sowtherns_, alias old _Demdike_) did  sundry times in going or walking togeather as they went begging,  perswade and aduise this Examinate to let a Deuill or Familiar appeare  vnto her; and that shee this Examinate, would let him sucke at"]]]
