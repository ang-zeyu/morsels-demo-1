EXPLANATION.--The length of the string sounding the tone C is  represented by unity or 1. Now, as we have shown, the major third to  that C, which is E, is produced by 4/5 of its length.    In like manner, G[#], the major third to E, will be produced by 4/5 of  that segment of the string which sounds the tone E; that is, G[#] will  be produced by 4/5 of 4/5 (4/5 multiplied by 4/5) which equals 16/25  of the entire length of the string sounding the tone C.    We come, now, to the last third, G[#] (A[b]) to C, which completes the  interval of the octave, middle C to 3C. This last C, being the major  third from the A[b], will be produced as before, by 4/5 of that  segment of the string which sounds A[b]; that is, by 4/5 of 16/25,  which equals 64/125 of the entire length of the string. Keep this last  fraction, 64/125, in mind, and remember it as representing the segment  of the entire string, which produces the upper C by the succession of  three perfectly tuned major thirds.    Now, let us refer to the law which says that a perfect octave is  obtained from the exact half of the length of any string. Is 64/125 an  exact half? No; using the same numerator, an exact half would be  64/128.    Hence, it is clear that the octave obtained by the succession of  perfect major thirds will differ from the true octave by the ratio of  128 to 125. The fraction, 64/125, representing a longer segment of the  string than 64/128 (1/2), it would produce a flatter tone than the  exact half.    It is evident, therefore, that _all major thirds must be tuned  somewhat sharper than perfect_ in a system of equal temperament.    The ratio which expresses the value of the _diesis_ is that of 128 to  125. If, therefore, the octaves are to remain perfect, which they must  do, _each major third must be tuned sharper than perfect by one-third  part of the diesis_.    The foregoing demonstration may be made still clearer by the following  diagram which represents the length of string necessary to produce  these tones. (This diagram is exact in the various proportional  lengths, being about one twenty-fifth the actual length represented.)

LESSON XIII.    ~RATIONALE OF THE TEMPERAMENT.~ (Concluded from Lesson XII.)    PROPOSITION II.      That the student of scientific scale building may understand fully the  reasons why the tempered scale is at constant variance with exact  mathematical ratios, we continue this discussion through two more  propositions, No. II, following, demonstrating the result of dividing  the octave into four minor thirds, and Proposition III, demonstrating  the result of twelve perfect fifths. The matter in Lesson XII, if  properly mastered, has given a thorough insight into the principal  features of the subject in question; so the following demonstration  will be made as brief as possible, consistent with clearness.    Let us figure the result of dividing an octave into four minor thirds.  The ratio of the length of string sounding a fundamental, to the  length necessary to sound its minor third, is that of 6 to 5. In other  words, 5/6 of any string sounds a tone which is an exact minor third  above that of the whole string.    Now, suppose we select, as before, a string sounding middle C, as the  fundamental tone. We now ascend by minor thirds until we reach the C,  octave above middle C, which we call 3C, as follows:    Middle C-E[b]; E[b]-F[#]; F[#]-A; A-3C.    Demonstrate by figures as follows:--Let the whole length of string  sounding middle C be represented by unity or 1.        E[b] will be sounded by 5/6 of the string                5/6      F[#], by 5/6 of the E[b] segment; that is, by 5/6 of        5/6 of the entire string, which equals                25/36      A, by 5/6 of 25/36 of entire string, which equals      125/216      3C, by 5/6 of 125/216 of entire string, which equals   625/1296    Now bear in mind, this last fraction, 625/1296, represents the segment  of the entire string which should sound the tone 3C, an exact octave  above middle C. Remember, our law demands an exact half of a string by  which to sound its octave. How much does it vary? Divide the  denominator (1296) by 2 and place the result over it for a numerator,  and this gives 648/1296, which is an exact half. Notice the  comparison.        3C obtained from a succession of exact minor thirds,      625/1296      3C obtained from an exact half of the string              648/1296    Now, the former fraction is smaller than the latter; hence, the  segment of string which it represents will be shorter than the exact  half, and will consequently yield a sharper tone. The denominators  being the same, we have only to find the difference between the  numerators to tell how much too short the former segment is. This  proves the C obtained by the succession of minor thirds to be too  short by 23/1296 of the length of the whole string.    If, therefore, all octaves are to remain perfect, it is evident that  _all minor thirds must be tuned flatter than perfect_ in the system of  equal temperament.    The ratio, then, of 648 to 625 expresses the excess by which the true  octave exceeds four exact minor thirds; consequently, each minor third  must be flatter than perfect by one-fourth part of the difference  between these fractions. By this means the dissonance is evenly  distributed so that it is not noticeable in the various chords, in the  major and minor keys, where this interval is almost invariably  present. (We find no record of writers on the mathematics of sound  giving a name to the above ratio expressing variance, as they have to  others.)      PROPOSITION III.    Proposition III deals with the perfect fifth, showing the result from  a series of twelve perfect fifths employed within the space of an  octave.    METHOD.--Taking 1C as the fundamental, representing it by unity or 1,  the G, fifth above, is sounded by a 2/3 segment of the string sounding  C. The next fifth, G-D, takes us beyond the octave, and we find that  the D will be sounded by 4/9 (2/3 of 2/3 equals 4/9) of the entire  string, which fraction is less than half; so to keep within the bounds  of the octave, we must double this segment and make it sound the tone  D an octave lower, thus: 4/9 times 2 equals 8/9, the segment sounding  the D within the octave.    We may shorten the operation as follows: Instead of multiplying 2/3 by  2/3, giving us 4/9, and then multiplying this answer by 2, let us  double the fraction, 2/3, which equals 4/3, and use it as a multiplier  when it becomes necessary to double the segment to keep within the  octave.    We may proceed now with the twelve steps as follows:--    Steps--    1.  1C   to 1G                                  segment  2/3    for 1G  2.  1G    \" 1D Multiply  2/3      by 4/3, gives segment  8/9      \" 1D  3.  1D    \" 1A    \"      8/9      \"  2/3   \"     \"      16/27     \" 1A  4.  1A    \" 1E    \"     16/27     \"  4/3   \"     \"      64/81     "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/17575"],[0,"How to Camp Out (#16)"],[1,"weight of the body, and _ex_piration  takes place. When he is turned on the side, this pressure is removed,  and _in_spiration occurs.)    6th, When the prone position is resumed, make a uniform and efficient  pressure _along the spine_, removing the pressure immediately, before  rotation on the side. (The pressure augments the _ex_piration, the  rotation commences _in_spiration.) Continue these measures.    7th, Rub the limbs _upward_, with _firm pressure_ and with _energy_.

Avoid the immediate removal of the patient, as it involves a _dangerous  loss of time_; also the use of bellows or any _forcing_ instrument; also  the _warm bath_ and _all rough treatment_.      POISONS.    In all cases of poisoning, the first step is to evacuate the stomach.  This should be effected by an emetic which is _quickly_ obtained, and  most powerful and speedy in its operation. Such are, powdered mustard  (a large tablespoonful in a tumblerful of warm water), powdered alum  (in half-ounce doses), sulphate of zinc (ten to thirty grains), tartar  emetic (one to two grains) combined with powdered ipecacuanha (twenty  grains), and sulphate of copper (two to five grains). When vomiting has  already taken place, copious draughts of warm water or warm mucilaginous  drinks should be given, to keep up the effect till the poisoning  substance has been thoroughly evacuated.      PARTING ADVICE.    Be independent, but not impudent. See all you can, and make the most of  your time; \"time is money;\" and, when you grow older, you may find it  even more difficult to command time than money.
