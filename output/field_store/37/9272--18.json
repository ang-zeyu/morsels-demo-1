Lieder des Mirza Schaffy--Are Original Poems--Nachlass--Aus        Morgenland und Abendland--Sakuntala, a Narrative Poem.      The Hafid tendency was carried to the height of popularity by Friedrich  Martin Bodenstedt, whose _Lieder des Mirza Schaffy_ met with a  phenomenal success, running through one hundred and forty editions in  Germany alone during the lifetime of the author, besides being  translated into many foreign languages.[204] These songs have had a  remarkable career, which the author himself relates in an essay appended  to the _Nachlass_.[205]    According to the prevailing opinion, Mirza Schaffy was a great Persian  poet, a rival of Sa'di and Hafid, and Bodenstedt was the translator of  his songs. Great, therefore, was the astonishment of the European, and  particularly the German public, when it was discovered that the name of  this famous poet was utterly unknown in the East, even in his own native  land. As early as 1860, Professor Brugsch, when in Tiflis, had searched  for the singer's grave, but in vain; nobody could tell him where a  certain Mirza Schaffy lay buried. At last, in 1870, the Russian  counsellor Adolph Berge gave an authentic account of the real man and  his literary activity.[206] Two things were clearly established: first,  that such a person as Mirza Safi' had really existed; second, that this  person was no poet. On this second point the few scraps of verse which  Berge had been able to collect, and which he submitted in the essay  cited above, leave absolutely no doubt. So, in 1874, when Bodenstedt  published another poetic collection of Mirza Schaffy, he appended an  essay wherein he explained clearly the origin and the nature of the  original collection bearing that name.    According to his own statements, these poems are not translations. They  are entirely his own,[207] and were originally not an independent  collection, but part of the biographical romance _Tausend und ein Tag im  Orient_.[208] This should be kept in mind if we wish to estimate them at  their true value.    Nevertheless the poems are genuinely Oriental and owe their existence to  the author's stay in the East, particularly in Tiflis, during the winter  1843-44. But for this residence in the Orient, so Bodenstedt tells  us,[209] a large part of them would never have seen the light.    In form, however, they are Occidental--the _gazal_ being used only a few  times (e.g. ii. 135, or in the translations from Hafid in chap. 21: ii.  70=H. 8; ii. 72=H. 155, etc.) In spirit they are like Hafid. \"Mein  Lehrer ist Hafis, mein Bethaus ist die Schenke,\" so Mirza Schaffy  himself proclaims (i. p. 96), and images and ideas from Hafid, familiar  to us from preceding chapters, meet us everywhere. The stature like a  cypress, the nightingale and the rose, the verses like pearls on a  string, and others could be cited as instances. Other authors are also  laid under contribution; thus the comparison of Mirza Schaffy to a bee  seems to have been suggested by a maxim of Sa'di (_Gul._ viii. No. 77,  ed. Platts; K.S. p. 268), where a wise man without practice is called a  bee without honey, and the thought in the last verse of \"Die Rose auch\"  (vol. ii. p. 85), that the rose cannot do without dirt and the  nightingale feeds on worms, is a reminiscence of a story of Nidami which  we had occasion to cite in the chapter on Rueckert (see p. 43). In one  case a poem contains a Persian proverb. Mirza Schaffy criticises the  opinions of the Shah's viziers in the words: \"Ich hoere das Geklapper  einer Muehle, doch sehe ich kein Mehl\" (i, 85), a literal rendering of         [Arabic]    Of course the _mullas_ and hypocrites in general are roundly scored,  especially in chapter 27, where the sage, angered by the reproaches  which the _mustahid_ has made to him for his bad conduct and irreligious  poetry, gives vent to his sentiments of disgust in a number of poems  (vol. ii. p. 137 seq.). Bodenstedt undoubtedly had in mind the  persecutions to which Hafid was subject, culminating in the refusal of  the priests to give him regular burial and giving rise to the famous  story of the _fatva_.    The tavern and the praise of wine are, of course, bound to be prominent  features. In the same _credo_ where Mirza Schaffy proclaims Hafid as  his teacher he also proclaims the tavern as his house of prayer (i. p.  96), and so he celebrates the day when he quit the mosque for the  wine-house (i. p. 98; cf. H. 213. 4). The well known poem \"Aus dem  Feuerquell des Weines\" (i. p. 106) is in sentiment exactly like a  quatrain of 'Umar Xayyam (Bodl. ed. Heron-Allen, Boston, 1898, No. 78;  Whinfield, 195); the last verse is based on a couplet of Sa'di (_Gul._  i. 4, last _qit'ah_, Platts, p. 18) which is cited immediately after the  poem itself (i. p. 107).    A collection of Hafizian songs would scarcely be complete without a song  in praise of Shiraz. This we get in vol. ii. p. 48, where Shiraz is  compared to Tiflis; and just as the former was made famous through  Hafid, so the latter will become famous through Mirza Schaffy. Little  did the worthy sage of Ganja dream that this would come literally true.  Yet it did. The closing lines of the poem--        Beruehmt ist Tiflis durch dein Lied      Vom Kyros bis zum Rhein geworden--    are no empty boast; they simply express a fact.    None of Bodenstedt's later poetic publications ever attained the success  of the Mirza Schaffy songs, and, it may be added, none of them equalled  those songs in merit. In 1874 the author resolved once more to try the  magic of that name and so he launched forth a collection called _Aus dem  Nachlasse Mirza Schaffy's_, and to emphasize the Persian character of  these poems the Persian translation of the title, [Arabic], appeared  on the title-page. In spite of all this, however, the Orientalism in  these poems is more artificial than natural; it is not felt as something  essential without which the poems could not exist. The praise of wine,  which is the main theme of the second book,--for the collection  is divided into seven books,--is certainly not characteristically  Persian; European, and especially German poets have also been very  liberal and very proficient in bibulous verse. The maxims that make  up the third and a portion of the fourth book are for the most  part either plainly unoriental, or else so perfectly general, and, we  may add, so hopelessly commonplace, as to fit in anywhere. Some,  however, are drawn from Persian sources. Thus from the _Gulistan_ we  have in the third book, Nos. 8 (_Gul._ Pref. p. 7, last _qit'ah_), 9  (ibid. p. 6, first three couplets), 12 (ibid. iii. 27, _math_. p. 89) and  36 (saying of the king in _Gul._ i. 1, p. 13). No. 31 is from the  introduction to the _Hitopadesa_ (third couplet).[210] \"Die Cypresse,\"  p. 103, is suggested by _Gul._ viii. 111 (K.S. 81).    The Oriental stories which form the contents of the fifth book are of  small literary value. Some of them read like versified lessons in  Eastern religion, as, for instance, \"Der Sufi,\" p. 111, which is a  rhymed exposition of a Sufistic principle,[211] and \"Der  Wuestenheilige,\" which enunciates through the lips of Zoroaster himself  his doctrine that good actions are worth more than ascetic  practices.[212] On p. 121 Ibn Yamin is credited with the story of the  poet and the glow-worm, which is found in Sa'di's _Bustan_ (ed. Platts  and Rogers, Lond. 1891, p. 127; tr. Barbier de Meynard, Paris, 1880, p.  163). The famous story of Yusuf and Zalicha, as related by Jami and  Firdausi, is the subject of the longest poem in the book and is told in  a somewhat flippant manner, p. 135 seq. The stories told of Sa'di's  reception at court and his subsequent banishment through the calumny of  the courtiers, pp. 123-128, seem to be pure invention; at least there is  nothing, as far as we know, in the life or writings of the Persian poet  that could have furnished the material for these poems.[213]    In 1882, still another collection of Bodenstedt's poems, entitled _Aus  Morgenland und Abendland_, made its appearance. Like the _Nachlass_ it  also has seven divisions, of which only the second, fourth and sixth are  of interest for us as containing Oriental material.[214]    One poem, however, in the first book, \"An eine Kerze,\" p. 5, should be  mentioned as of genuinely Persian character. The "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/17959"],[0,"The Hand of Fu-Manchu (#16)"],[1,"tongue to utter them. Some  of the syllables were slurred; but nevertheless distinguishable. It  was a demonstration of sheer _Force_ unlike any I had witnessed, and  it impressed me unforgettably.    \"The removal of this injurious particle,\" he continued, \"would be an  operation which I myself could undertake to perform successfully upon  another. It is a matter of some delicacy as you, Sir Baldwin, and\"--  slowly, horribly, turning the half-dead and half-living head towards  me--\"you, Dr. Petrie, will appreciate. In the event of clumsy surgery,  death may supervene; failing this, permanent hemiplegia--or\"--the  film lifted from the green eyes, and for a moment they flickered with  transient horror--\"idiocy! Any one of three of my pupils whom I might  name could perform this operation with ease, but their services are  not available. Only one English surgeon occurred to me in this  connection, and you, Sir Baldwin\"--again he slowly turned his head--  \"were he. Dr. Petrie will act as anaesthetist, and, your duties  completed, you shall return to your home richer by the amount  stipulated. I have suitably prepared myself for the operation, and I  can assure you of the soundness of my heart. I may advise you, Dr.  Petrie\"--again turning to me--\"that my constitution is inured to the  use of opium. You will make due allowance for this. Mr. Li-King-Su,  a graduate of Canton, will act as dresser.\"    He turned laboriously to Zarmi. She clapped her hands and held the  curtain aside. A perfectly immobile Chinaman, whose age I was unable  to guess, and who wore a white overall, entered, bowed composedly to  Frazer and myself and began in a matter-of-fact way to prepare the  dressings.        CHAPTER XVIII    QUEEN OF HEARTS      \"Sir Baldwin Frazer,\" said Fu-Manchu, interrupting a wild outburst  from the former, \"your refusal is dictated by insufficient knowledge  of your surroundings. You find yourself in a place strange to you, a  place to which no clue can lead your friends; in the absolute power  of a man--myself--who knows no law other than his own and that of  those associated with him. Virtually, Sir Baldwin, you stand in  China; and in China we know how to _exact_ obedience. You will not  refuse, for Dr. Petrie will tell you something of my _wire-jackets_  and my _files_....\"    I saw Sir Baldwin Frazer blanch. He could not know what I knew of the  significance of those words--\"my wire-jackets, my files\"--but perhaps  something of my own horror communicated itself to him.    \"You will not _refuse_\" continued Fu-Manchu softly; \"my only fear for  you is that the operation my prove unsuccessful! In that event not  even my own great clemency could save you, for by virtue of your  failure I should be powerless to intervene.\" He paused for some  moments, staring directly at the surgeon. \"There are those within  sound of my voice,\" he added sibilantly, \"who would flay you alive in  the lamentable event of your failure, who would cast your flayed  body\"--he paused, waving one quivering fist above his head, \"to the  rats--to the rats!\"    Sir Baldwin's forehead was bathed in perspiration now. It was an  incredible and a gruesome situation, a nightmare become reality. But,  whatever my own case, I could see that Sir Baldwin Frazer was  convinced, I could see that his consent would no longer be withheld.    \"You, my dear friend,\" said Fu-Manchu, turning to me and resuming his  studied and painful composure of manner, \"will also consent....\"    Within my heart of hearts I could not doubt him; I knew that my  courage was not of a quality high enough to sustain the frightful  ordeals summoned up before my imagination by those words--\"my files,  my wire-jackets!\"    \"In the event, however, of any little obstinancy,\"  he added,  \"another will plead with you.\"    A chill like that of death descended upon me--as, for the second  time, Zarmi clapped her hands, pulled the curtain aside ... and  Karamaneh was thrust into the room!            *        *        *        *        *        *        *    There comes a blank in my recollections. Long after Karamaneh had  been plucked out again by the two muscular brown hands which clutched  her shoulders from the darkness beyond the doorway, I seemed to see  her standing there, in her close-fitting traveling dress. Her hair  was unbound, disheveled, her lovely face pale to the lips--and her  eyes, her glorious, terror-bright eyes, looked fully into mine....    Not a word did she utter, and I was stricken dumb as one who has  plucked the Flower of Silence. Only those wondrous eyes seemed to  look into my soul, searing, consuming me.    Fu-Manchu had been speaking for some time ere my brain began again  to record his words.    \"----and this magnanimity,\" came dully to my ears, \"extends to you,  Dr. Petrie, because of my esteem. I have little cause to love  Karamaneh\"--his voice quivered furiously--\"but she can yet be of  use to me, and I would not harm a hair of her beautiful head--except  in the event of your obstinacy. Shall we then determine your  immediate future upon the turn of a card, as the gamester within me,  within every one of my race, suggests?    \"Yes, yes!\" came hoarsely.    I fought mentally to restore myself to a full knowledge of what was  happening, and I realized that the last words had come from the lips  of Sir Baldwin Frazer.    \"Dr. Petrie,\" Frazer said, still in the same hoarse and unnatural  voice, \"what else can we do? At least take the chance of recovering  your freedom, for how otherwise can you hope to serve--your friend....\"    \"God knows!\" I said dully; \"do as you wish\"--and cared not to what I  had agreed.    Plunging his hand beneath his white overall, the Chinaman who had been  referred to as Li-King-Su calmly produced a pack of cards,  unemotionally shuffled them and extended the pack to me.    I shook my head grimly, for my hands were tied. Picking up a lancet  from the table, the Chinaman cut the cords which bound me, and again  extended the pack. I took a card and laid it on my knee without even  glancing at it. Fu-Manchu, with his left hand, in turn selected a  card, looked at it and then turned its face towards me.    \"It would seem, Dr. Petrie,\" he said calmly, \"that you are fated to  remain here as my guest. You will have the felicity of residing  beneath the same roof with Karamaneh.\"    The card was the Knave of Diamonds.    Conscious of a sudden excitement, I snatched up the card from my  knee. It was the Queen of Hearts! For a moment I tasted exultation,  then I tossed it upon the floor. I was not fool enough to suppose  that the Chinese Doctor would pay his debt of honor and release me.    \"Your star above mine,\" said Fu-Manchu, his calm unruffled. \"I place  myself in your hands, Sir Baldwin.\"    Assisted by his unemotional compatriot, Fu-Manchu discarded the  yellow robe, revealing himself in a white singlet in all his gaunt  ugliness, and extended his frame upon the operating-table.    Li-King-Su ignited the large lamp over the head of the table, and  from his case took out a trephine.            *        *        *        *        *        *        *    \"Other points for your guidance from my own considerable store of  experience\"--Fu-Manchu was speaking--\"are written out clearly in the  notebook which lies upon the table....\"    His voice, now, was toneless, emotionless, as though his part in the  critical operation about to be performed were that of a spectator. No  trace of nervousness, of fear, could I discern; his pulse was  practically normal.    How I shuddered as I touched his yellow skin! how my very soul rose  up in revolt! ...            *        *        *        *        *        *        *    \"There is the bullet!--quick! ... Steady, Petrie!\"    Sir Baldwin Frazer, keen, cool, deft, was metamorphosed, was the  enthusiastic, brilliant surgeon whom I knew and revered, and another  than the nerveless captive who, but a few minutes ago, had stared,  panic-stricken, at Dr. Fu-Manchu.    Although I had met him once or twice professionally, I had never  hitherto seen him operate; and his method was little short of  miraculous. It was stimulating, inspiring. With unerring touch he  whittled madness, death, from the very throne of reason, of life.    Now was the crucial moment of his task ... and, with its coming, every  light in the room suddenly failed--went out!    \"My God!\" whispered Frazer, in the darkness, \"quick! quick! lights!  a match!--a candle!--something, anything!\"    There came a faint click, and a beam of white light was directed,  steadily, upon the patient's skull. Li-King-Su--unmoved--held an  electric torch in his hand!    Frazer and I set to work, in a fierce battle to fend off Death, who  already outstretched his pinions over the insensible man--to fend off  Death from the arch-murderer, the enemy of the white races, who lay  there at our mercy! ...            *        *        *        *        *        *         *    \"It seems you want a pick-me-up!\" said Zarmi. Sir Baldwin Frazer  collapsed into the cane arm-chair. Only a matting curtain separated us  from the room wherein he had successfully performed perhaps the most  wonderful operation of his career.    \"I could not have lasted out another thirty seconds, Petrie!\" he  whispered. \"The events which led up to it had exhausted my nerves and  I had no reserve to call upon. If that last ...\"    He broke off, the sentence uncompleted, and eagerly seized the tumbler  containing brandy and soda, which the beautiful, wicked-eyed Eurasian  passed to him. She turned, and prepared a drink for me, with the  insolent _insouciance_ which had never deserted her.    I emptied the tumbler at a draught.    Even as I set the glass down I realized, too late, that it was the  first drink I had ever permitted to pass my lips within an abode of  Dr. Fu-Manchu....    I started to my feet.    \"Frazer!\" I muttered--\"we've been drugged! we ...\"    \"You sit down,\" came Zarmi'"]]]
