Mr. Smith at the time  expressed his dread of being arrested if he were seen on the road along  which the chaise would have to be driven.  Mr. Wainwright, however,  declined to get out; stating it was quite unnecessary to take so much  precaution; but at length, in consequence of Smith's earnest entreaty, he  consented.  They then proceeded across the fields on foot.  As it was  commencing to rain, Mr. Smith pressed on Mr. Wainwright the use of his  cloak; but this Mr. Wainwright declined.  Smith then led the way across  the fields, by a stile path, till they arrived at length at a small  thicket, through which they proceeded, when Smith stopped short, and said  he knew a nearer way.  Smith then led Mr. Wainwright into a meadow, and  standing before him drew out a pistol.  Mr. Wainwright immediately  concluded that his fellow-passenger intended to put an end to his own  life, and, after a sharp struggle, got the pistol from him, remonstrating  with him upon the wickedness of the act.  Smith, however, drew another  pistol, and fired it at Mr. Wainwright, fortunately without effect.  The  latter instantly sprang upon Mr. Smith and got him down, uttering loud  cries for assistance.  Smith begged hard for mercy, and on promising not  to repeat his murderous attack, was allowed to get up.  He was no sooner  released and on his legs than he drew a third pistol, fired, and hit Mr.  Wainwright in the body.  The men again closed, when Smith drew a knife  and made several attempts upon his companion's life by attempting to cut  his throat, which was fortunately well protected by the thick rolls of  cambric it was then the custom to tie round the neck, as well as by a  thick scarf, which was cut through in several places.  Mr. Wainwright,  however, never left hold of Smith until they reached his house when, the  door suddenly opening, he rushed in and quickly closed it.  He then came  to the window and ordered Mr. Wainwright away, refusing him shelter,  although it was growing dark and raining heavily.  Mr. Wainwright  contrived to crawl to a cottage, where he was laid up for some time, but  eventually recovered from the cuts and wounds inflicted upon him.  Smith  absconded, and a reward of 50 pounds was offered for his capture.  This  was effected after some time in Pall Mall, London, by two Bow-street  runners.  Smith was committed for trial at Stafford assizes, where he was  found guilty and sentenced to be hung.  He, however, escaped that  punishment by destroying both himself and his wife in his cell in  Stafford gaol, while awaiting his sentence.  What Smith's motive could be  for his conduct no one could conjecture.  He would give no explanation on  the subject though pressed to do so.  It was supposed that a sudden fit  of insanity had seized him, and that his violence was the result of it.  During the journey the two gentlemen were on the most friendly terms,  taking their meals together and acting as travellers thrown together  usually do.  Mr. Wainwright's presence was most essential to Smith to  allay the hostility of his creditors, and therefore, the attempts to make  away with him were still more incomprehensible.    As I sit by my fire-side with two or three old friends--friends, indeed,  for I have known them all for fifty, sixty, and seventy years--we talk  over old times, faces, scenes and places, in a way that calls up the  ghosts of the past to our dim eyes.  If my readers could listen to our  stories of the old town they would hear more about it in a night than my  little amanuensis could write down in a day.  Many curious anecdotes and  circumstances are called to remembrance by us, and I must say we talk of  old times with a regretful yet pleasant feeling.  I know I often startle  some of my young friends by telling them of scenes I have witnessed in  the last century, and I have often noticed them in their minds putting  one year and another together, or subtracting one from another so that  they might ascertain whether I was telling the truth or not.    I don't believe there is another man in Liverpool alive at this time who  saw the Town Hall on fire in 1795.  I saw it, I may say, almost break  out, for I was in Castle-street in ten minutes after the alarm had spread  through the town, and that was soon done, for Liverpool was not of the  extent it is now.  I believe half the inhabitants turned out into the  streets to witness that awful sight, although it was at five o'clock on a  frosty Sunday morning in January.  For my part, I was aroused by the  continuous springing of rattles by the watchmen, and the rushing sounds  of people running along the street.  I was soon out of bed and joined the  throng of people who were hurrying to the scene of disaster.  When I  arrived there, a crowd had already assembled.  Castle-street was then  very narrow.  It was quite choked up with people.  Dale-street was  beginning to be crowded while High-street and Water-street were quite  impassable.  From the windows of all the houses the terrified inmates  were to be observed _en dishabille_, and the large inn in Water-street,  the Talbot, which was nearly opposite the Town Hall, had people looking  out at every window.    The smoke first made its appearance at the lower windows of the Town  Hall.  The doors having been forced, a party of men got into the interior  of the building, and brought out for safety the books of the various  departments, and some of the town's officers having arrived, something  like system took the place of the dreadful confusion which prevailed.  The town records, the treasurer's accounts, and the muniments, etc., were  safely removed to a house at the end of High-street.  I helped to keep  order.  Assisted by many other volunteers for the work we formed a lane  so that there should be no impediment to a quick removal of anything that  was portable.  The fire was first discovered about five o'clock in the  morning by the watchman on duty in the street.  They were dull old  fellows, those watchmen, and of but little use, for in calling the hour  nine times out of ten they made a mistake.  The thieves laughed them to  scorn.  When the watchman saw smoke issuing from the windows he gave the  alarm without delay.  The fire soon showed itself, when it had once got  ahead.  When the new Exchange was erected, after the former one had been  taken down in 1748, somebody persuaded the authorities to have the  woodwork and timber of the new building steeped in a composition of rosin  and turpentine, so as to make the wood more durable.  It may therefore be  readily imagined how inflammable such a composition would make the wood,  and how fiercely it burned when once ignited.  There had been a  perceptible odour of some sort experienced in the Exchange building for  some days, and this was afterwards discovered to have arisen from the  woodwork under the council-chamber having taken fire through a flue  communicating from the Loan-office; and there is no doubt it had been  smouldering for days before it actually made its appearance.  It could  not have been ten minutes after I arrived on the spot before the flames  burst out in all their fury.  It was an awfully grand sight.  It was yet  dark.  What with the rushing and pushing of the anxious crowd, the  roaring of the fierce flames, and the calling of distracted people, it  was an event and scene never to be forgotten.  The building was soon all  in a blaze, and nothing on earth could have stopped that frightful  conflagration.  It was a mercy it was a calm frosty morning or the houses  in the four streets adjacent must have caught the flame.  From the age of  these houses, the quantity of timber in them, the narrowness of the  streets, and the absence of a copious supply of water, I am sure  Liverpool would have been half consumed if a wind had sprung up.  I  thought the building looked like a great funeral pile as the flames  roared out on all sides.  It was a grand, yet dreadful sight.  The whole  of Castle-street was occupied by people, although, from the position of  the Exchange, a full front view could not be obtained, it being almost  parallel with the west side of Castle-street.  The best view of it was  where I stood at the top of Dale-street, by Moss's bank.  The dome, being  constructed of wood, soon took fire, was burnt, and fell in.  We had not  then as now powerful engines, long reels of hose, and bands of active men  well trained to their arduous and dangerous duties, still, everybody did  his best and seemed desirous of doing something.  We did that something  with a will, but without much order, system, or discretion.  The engines  in use were not powerful, and the supply of water was not only tardy but  scanty, as you may believe when I tell you it had to be brought from the  town wells, the Dye-house Well in Greetham-street, the Old Fall Well in  Rose-street (where Alderman's Bennett's ironwork warehouse stands, near  the corner of Rose-street--by the way, Rose-street was called after Mr.  Rose, who lived in the house next the Stork Hotel), and the wells on  Shaw's-brow; indeed, every possible source where water could be obtained,  was put in requisition.  The inhabitants allowed the rain-water to be  taken from their water-butts in the vicinity to such liberal extent that  I verily believe there was not a drop of rain-water to be got for love or  money when that eventful day was out.  Staid housewives for many a day  after complained of the dirt the trampling of feet had made in their  lobbies and yards, and deplored the loss of their stores of soft-water.  At that time water was precious, every drop that could be obtained was  saved, garnered, and carefully kept.  Every drop of hard-water we  consumed had to be brought to our doors and paid for by the \"Hessian\" or  bucket.

It seems sometimes just by this patch of bushes, and  sometimes ever so far away.  Hark! there's another.\"    \"Yes, and another.\"    \"Or is it all made by one lion?\" said Dick.    \"I don't know,\" replied Jack, in an awe-stricken whisper.    \"Shall we call father, and tell him there are lions about?\"    \"No,\" said Dick sturdily.  \"He'd laugh at us for cowards.  We've got to  get used to lions, Jack; and it's our own doing--we wanted to come.\"    \"Yes, but I didn't know they'd come so close,\" replied Jack.  \"Hark at  that!\"    There was a deep-toned quivering roar, apparently from the other side of  the fire, and Dick felt his heart beat rapidly as he threw a handful of  small twigs upon the fire to make it blaze up.    \"Let's go and talk to the horses,\" he said.  \"Yes; that's right,\" for  Jack had also added an armful of dry wood to the fire, which now blazed  up merrily.    They went to the thorny hedge which protected the horses, and on making  their way through to where they were haltered to a pole, carried on the  waggon for the purpose, they found the poor creatures trembling, and  with dripping flanks, while when they spoke to them they rubbed their  noses against their masters' hands, and whinnied with pleasure, as if  comforted by the presence of the boys.    \"What's that, Dick?\" cried Jack excitedly, for there was a crashing  noise as if something had leaped at the hedge.    The answer came in the panic of the bullocks and the dread of the  horses; and, without hesitating, Jack lowered his piece in the direction  of the sound, to fire both barrels rapidly one after the other.    There was a savage roar for response, and a rush as of some creature  bounding through the bushes.  Then all was silent.    \"I wonder whether I hit him,\" said Jack, proceeding to throw out the  empty cartridges and reload.    \"Is anything wrong?  Shall I come?\" shouted Mr Rogers, from within the  waggon.    \"No, father,\" replied Dick steadily.  \"You needn't come.  We only fired  at a lion.\"    But as they reached the fire again, a tall dark figure crawled to their  side, and nodded to them gravely.    \"Plenty of lion here.  I stop and help you.\"    It was the General, and glad enough the boys were of his company.    Almost before they had seated themselves they heard a sound on the  right, and taking a burning stick from the fire the General whirled it  in the direction, the wood blazing up in its rapid passage through the  air, and falling amongst some dry grass, which it set on fire, to burn  for a few moments vividly, and then leave the surroundings apparently  darker than before.    As the burning brand fell in the forest there was an angry snarl, and  these snarls were repeated again and again as from time to time the  General skilfully threw the wood wherever his quick ears told him there  was one of the lurking beasts.    \"Is there more than one lion?\" said Dick, in a whisper at last.    \"Three, four, five,\" said the General.  \"They want horse or bullock.  Hist! look! see!\"    He pointed to a dark patch at the edge of the forest, where, upon Dick  directing his eyes, he could see nothing; but the next moment there was  the reflection of the fire to be seen in a couple of glaring orbs.    \"Can you shoot him?\" said the General.    \"Let me by, Dick.  My hand's steady,\" whispered Jack.  \"I think I could  hit him.\"    \"Go on,\" was the whispered reply.    To fire it was necessary for Jack to take aim across the Zulu, who  leaned forward so that the barrel of Jack's rifle rested upon his  shoulders; while, kneeling, the boy took along and careful aim, right  between the two glowing orbs, and drew trigger.  There was the sharp  report, a furious roar, a rush, the falling of some heavy body, and the  scattering of the fire-brands.  Then all was silent; and they rapidly  collected the scattered embers to make the fire blaze up again; for the  lions, far from being scared by the noise of the shot, renewed their  awe-inspiring \"Oomph! oomph!\" on all sides; and the fear of the cattle  was such that they threatened to break out of the kraal.    Again Mr Rogers roused himself, and asked if there was any need for him  to come.  But Dick replied steadily that there was not--feeling as he  did pretty confident, in spite of his dread, that they could keep the  lions at bay.    The fire blazed up so brightly, that the boys glanced anxiously at the  supply of wood, thinking of the hours they had yet to pass before  daylight, and what would be the consequences if the fire went out.    One thing was very certain, and that was that a large fire would be  necessary now every night.  And though the boys felt a strange kind of  tremor as they felt the risks they were incurring, there was so much  romantic excitement in the life they were leading, that they would not  have given it up on any consideration.    The lions roared and prowled about them during the remainder of the  night, sometimes coming very close, sometimes retreating, for the fire  was very bright.  And then came the two boys, Coffee and Chicory, with  Peter the driver, to relieve them, just as day was breaking, and the  young travellers gladly went back into the waggon for a sleep.        CHAPTER FOURTEEN.    TRACKED BY AN ENEMY.    They did not have a long sleep, for Mr Rogers soon roused them to say  that breakfast was ready; which meal being discussed, the oxen were  in-spanned, and the horses mounted, so as to have a good long trek  towards the Limpopo, or Crocodile River, before the heat of the day.    Before leaving their camp the boys had a good look round with the  General, in the expectation and hope of seeing the lion at which Jack  had shot, lying dead.  But though he felt certain that he had hit the  monster, and though footprints were about in all directions, there was  no dead lion, and they had to hope for better luck the next time.    \"I don't care,\" said Jack discontentedly; \"I'm as sure as can be that  this gun don't shoot straight.\"    \"Try again, Jack,\" said his father, laughing.    And on they walked, over what was now a plain covered with great coarse,  reedy grass, such as would afford plenty of cover for game.    This, however, was scarce, and beyond the boys knocking down three or  four large birds of the partridge kind, there was very little done.    The General, for some reason which he did not explain, had taken his  great Zulu shield from where it hung behind one of the waggon-wheels,  and, armed with a couple of assegais, kept making expeditions to right  and left--and quite as often hung back, watchfully keeping an eye to the  rear.    It was a case of man's cunning against that of a beast; and after being  away some hours, he came up with the not very pleasant information that  a huge lion, one of the ferocious maneless kind, was tracking the  waggon, and would no doubt hang upon their trail until it had pounced  upon one of the horses, and carried it off.    \"Oh, that would be horrible,\" cried Jack.  \"I'd almost sooner that he  would take me than my horse.\"    \"Have you seen it, General?\" said Dick; \"or do you think it is following  us, from its footprints?\"    \"I have seen it,\" said the General gravely.  \"I felt sure from some  footmarks I had seen that some great beast was following us--one of  those that scented the horses last night.  Once or twice I thought the  steps might be those of some lion that had passed this way; but, after  watching, I found them so often that at last I lay down amongst the long  grass, covered myself with my shield, and waited.  It was very, very  long, and nothing came, and I thought again that I was mistaken; but I  knew that if it was a lion, tracking down the horses and bullocks, he  would come close between the wheel marks of the waggon, and there slay.\"    \"And did you mean to kill him, General?\" said Dick eagerly.    \"One man cannot kill a lion with an assegai, Boss Dick,\" said the Zulu,  \"and live afterwards and hunt with his friends.  It takes the little  bullet from a gun to kill a lion well, for you can stand and shoot  farther off than a lion can spring.  No, I only wanted to know and be  sure; and if I was sure I said, Boss Dick or Boss Jack will shoot him.  So I waited till I thought he would not come, and then I was going to  follow the waggon, when I heard something come steal--steal--steal  along; and when at last I looked from under my shield, there he stood  amongst the grass, close to me, watching the waggon.  If I had stood up  I could have speared him; but I was lying down, and if I had tried to  get up he would have sprung upon me, the great thing; so I held the  shield more over me, like an animal with a shell, and crept a little way  on to meet him, and then made a jump at him, and he roared and dashed  away.\"    \"But why didn't he seize you?\" said Jack.    \"He did not see I was a man, and he did not understand what the long  thing with black legs was that jumped at him; and a lion is big and  strong, but he is a coward about what he does not understand.\"    \"And have you frightened him right away?\" asked Dick.  \"Fancy  frightening away a lion!\"    \"No,\" said the Zulu; \"only a little way.  He is following the waggon  now, crawling softly through the grass; and I am sure it is the one Boss  Jack has shot last night, for there was a mark and blood upon his  forehead.  It is a great lion, with no mane; and he is savage and wild,  and will follow the waggon always till he is killed.  We must kill that  lion soon.\"    \"An' is he"]]]
