It is the triple alliance of which I speak; a measure  which gave entire satisfaction to the public.    The glory of France, which had long been eclipsed, either by domestic  factions, or by the superior force of the Spanish monarchy, began now  to break out with great lustre, and to engage the attention of the  neighboring nations. The independent power and mutinous spirit of  the nobility were subdued; the popular pretensions of the parliament  restrained; the Hugonot party reduced to subjection: that extensive and  fertile country, enjoying every advantage both of climate and situation,  was fully peopled with ingenious and industrious inhabitants: and while  the spirit of the nation discovered all the vigor and bravery requisite  for great enterprises, it was tamed to an entire submission under the  will of the sovereign.    The sovereign who now filled the throne was well adapted, by his  personal character, both to increase and to avail himself of these  advantages. Lewis XIV., endowed with every quality which could enchant  the people, possessed many which merit the approbation of the wise. The  masculine beauty of his person was embellished with a noble air: the  dignity of his behavior was tempered with affability and politeness:  elegant without effeminacy, addicted to pleasure without neglecting  business, decent in his very vices, and beloved in the midst of  arbitrary power, he surpassed all contemporary monarchs, as in grandeur,  so likewise in fame and glory.    His ambition, regulated by prudence, not by justice, had carefully  provided every means of conquest; and before he put himself in motion,  he seemed to have absolutely insured success. His finances were brought  into order; a naval power created; his armies increased and disciplined;  magazines and military stores provided; and though the magnificence of  his court was supported beyond all former example; so regular was the  economy observed, and so willingly did the people, now enriched by arts  and commerce, submit to multiplied taxes, that his military force  much exceeded what in any preceding age had ever been employed by any  European monarch.    The sudden decline, and almost total fall of the Spanish monarchy,  opened an inviting field to so enterprising a prince, and seemed to  promise him easy and extensive conquests*[**missing period] The other  nations of Europe, feeble or ill governed, were astonished at the  greatness of his rising empire; and all of them cast their eyes towards  England, as the only power which could save them from that subjection  with which they seemed to be so nearly threatened.    The animosity which had anciently subsisted between the English and  French nations, and which had been suspended for above a century by the  jealousy of Spanish greatness, began to revive and to exert itself. The  glory of preserving the balance of Europe, a glory so much founded on  justice and humanity, flattered the ambition of England; and the people  were eager to provide for their own future security, by opposing the  progress of so hated a rival. The prospect of embracing such measures  had contributed, among other reasons, to render the peace of Breda so  universally acceptable to the nation. By the death of Philip IV., king  of Spain, an inviting opportunity, and some very slender pretences, had  been afforded to call forth the ambition of Lewis.    At the treaty of the Pyrenees, when Lewis espoused the Spanish princess,  he had renounced every title of succession to every part of the Spanish  monarchy; and this renunciation had been couched in the most accurate  and most precise terms that language could afford. But on the death of  his father-in-law, he retracted his renunciation, and pretended  that natural rights, depending on blood and succession, could not be  annihilated by any extorted deed or contract. Philip had left a son,  Charles II. of Spain; but as the queen of France was of a former  marriage, she laid claim to a considerable province of the Spanish  monarchy, even to the exclusion of her brother. By the customs of some  parts of Brabant, a female of a first marriage was preferred to a male  of a second, in the succession to private inheritances; and Lewis thence  inferred, that his queen had acquired a right to the dominion of that  important duchy.    A claim of this nature was more properly supported by military force  than by argument and reasoning. Lewis appeared on the frontiers of the  Netherlands with an army of forty thousand men, commanded by the best  generals of the age, and provided with every thing necessary for action.  The Spaniards, though they might have foreseen this measure, were  totally unprepared. Their towns, without magazines, fortifications  or garrisons, fell into the hands of the French king, as soon as he  presented himself before them. Athe, Lisle, Tournay, Oudenarde,  Courtray, Charleroi, Binche, were immediately taken: and it was visible,  that no force in the Low Countries was able to stop or retard the  progress of the French arms.    This measure, executed with such celerity and success, gave great alarm  to almost every court in Europe. It had been observed with what dignity,  or even haughtiness, Lewis, from the time he began to govern, had  ever supported all his rights and pretensions. D'Estrades, the French  ambassador, and Watteville, the Spanish, having quarrelled in London,  on Account of their claims for precedency, the French monarch was not  satisfied, till Spain sent to Paris a solemn embassy, and promised never  more to revive such contests. Crequi, his ambassador at Rome, had met  with an affront from the pope's guards: the pope, Alexander VII., had  been constrained to break his guards, to send his nephew to ask pardon,  and to allow a pillar to be erected in Rome itself, as a monument of his  own humiliation. The king of England too had experienced the high spirit  and unsubmitting temper of Lewis. A pretension to superiority in the  English flag having been advanced, the French monarch remonstrated  with such vigor, and prepared himself to resist with such courage, that  Charles found it more prudent to desist from his vain and antiquated  claims. \"The king of England,\" said Lewis to his ambassador D'Estrades,  \"may know my force, but he knows not the sentiments of my heart: every  thing appears to me contemptible in comparison of glory.\"[*] These  measures of conduct had given strong indications of his character: but  the invasion of Flanders discovered an ambition, which, being supported  by such overgrown power, menaced the general liberties of Europe.         * January 25, 1662    As no state lay nearer the danger, none was seized with more terror than  the United Provinces. They were still engaged, together with France, in  a war against England; and Lewis had promised them, that he would take  no step against Spain without previously informing them: but, contrary  to this assurance, he kept a total silence, till on the very point of  entering upon action. If the renunciation made at the treaty of the  Pyrenees was not valid, it was foreseen, that upon the death of the king  of Spain, a sickly infant, the whole monarchy would be claimed by  Lewis; after which it would be vainly expected to set bounds to his  pretensions. Charles acquainted with these well-grounded apprehensions  of the Dutch, had been the more obstinate in insisting on his own  conditions at Breda; and by delaying to sign the treaty, had imprudently  exposed himself to the signal disgrace which he received at Chatham. De  Wit, sensible that a few weeks' delay would be of no consequence in the  Low Countries, took this opportunity of striking an important blow, and  of finishing the war with honor to himself and to his country.    Negotiations meanwhile commenced for the saving of Flanders; but no  resistance was made to the French arms. The Spanish ministers exclaimed  every where against the flagrant injustice of Lewis's pretensions, and  represented it to be the interest of every power in Europe, even more  than of Spain itself, to prevent his conquest of the Low Countries.  The emperor and the German princes discovered evident symptoms of  discontent; but their motions were slow and backward. The states,  though terrified at the prospect of having their frontier exposed to so  formidable a foe, saw no resource, no means of safety. England indeed  seemed disposed to make opposition to the French; but the variable and  impolitic conduct of Charles kept that republic from making him any  open advances, by which she might lose the friendship of France, without  acquiring any new ally. And though Lewis, dreading a combination of all  Europe, had offered terms of accommodation, the Dutch apprehended lest  these, either from the obstinacy of the Spaniards, or the ambition of  the French, would never be carried into execution.    Charles resolved with great prudence to take the first step towards  a confederacy. Sir William Temple, his resident at Brussels, received  orders to go secretly to the Hague, and to concert with the states the  means of saving the Netherlands. This man, whom philosophy had taught to  despise the world, without rendering him unfit for it, was frank,  open, sincere, superior to the little tricks of vulgar politicians;  and meeting in De Wit with a man of the same generous and enlarged  sentiments, he immediately opened his master's intentions, and pressed a  speedy conclusion. A treaty was from the first negotiated between  these two statesmen with the same cordiality as if it were a private  transaction between intimate companions. Deeming the interests of their  country the same, they gave full scope to that sympathy of character,  which disposed them to an entire reliance on each other's professions  and engagements. And though jealousy against the house of Orange might"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/19217"],[0,"The History of England in Three Volumes, Vol.II. (#16)"],[1,"this session, the commons,  in an address to the king, desired that a revenue of fifty thousand  pounds might be settled upon the prince and princess of Denmark, out of  the civil list; and his majesty gratified them in this particular: yet  the warmth and industry with which the friends of the princess  exerted themselves in promoting the settlement, produced a coldness and  misunderstanding between the two sisters; and the subsequent disgrace of  the earl of Marlborough was imputed to the part which his wife acted on  the occasion. She was lady of the bed-chamber, and chief confidant to  the princess, whom she strenuously advised to insist upon the settlement  rather than depend upon the generosity of the king and queen.          LUDLOW ARRIVES IN ENGLAND, BUT IS OBLIGED TO WITHDRAW.    About this period general Ludlow, who at the restoration had been  excepted from the act of indemnity, as one of those who sat in judgment  upon Charles I. arrived in England, and offered his service in reducing  Ireland, where he had formerly commanded. Though a rigid republican,  he was reputed a conscientious man, and a good officer. He had received  some encouragement to come over, and probably would have been employed  had not the commons interposed. Sir Edward Seymour, who enjoyed by grant  an estate in Wiltshire which had formerly belonged to Ludlow, began to  be in pain for his possession. He observed in the house, that the nation  would be disgraced should one of the J parricides be suffered to live in  the kingdom. An address was immediately presented to the king, desiring  a proclamation might be issued promising a reward for apprehending  general Ludlow. This was accordingly published; but not before he had  landed in Holland, from whence he returned to Vevay in Switzerland,  where he wrote the memoirs of his life, and died after an exile of  thirty years.          EFFORTS OF THE JACOBITES IN SCOTLAND.    While king William fluctuated between two parties in England, his  interest in Scotland had well nigh given way to a coalition between the  original Jacobites and Montgomery's party of discontented presbyterians.  Colonel Cannon, who succeeded the viscount Dundee in command, after  having made several unsuccessful efforts in favour of the late king's  interest, retired into Ireland; and the highlanders chose sir Hugh  Cameron for their leader. Under him they renewed their incursions with  the better prospect of success, as several regiments of the regular  troops had been sent to reinforce the army of Schomberg. James assisted  them with clothes, arms, and ammunition, together with some officers,  amongst whom was colonel Bucan, appointed to act as their chief  commander. This officer, at the head of fifteen hundred men, advanced  into the shire of Murray, in hopes of being joined by other malcontents;  but he was surprised and routed by sir Thomas Livingstone, while major  Ferguson destroyed the places they possessed in the Isle of Mull; so  that the highlanders were obliged to retire and conceal themselves among  their hills and fastnesses. The friends of James, despairing of doing  any thing effectual for his service in the field, converted all their  attention to the proceedings in parliament; where they imagined their  interest was much stronger than it appeared to be upon trial. They took  the oaths without hesitation, and hoped, by the assistance of their new  allies, to embroil the government in such a manner that the majority of  the people would declare for a restoration. But the views of these new  cemented parties were altogether incompatible, and their principles  diametrically opposite. Notwithstanding their concurrence in parliament,  the earl of Melvil procured a small majority. The opposition was  immediately discouraged: some individuals retracted, rather than fall  with a sinking cause; and mutual jealousies began to prevail. The  leaders of the coalition treated separately with king James; made  inconsistent demands; reciprocally concealed their negotiations; in a  word, they distrusted and hated one another with the most implacable  resentment.          THE COURT INTEREST PREVAILS.    The earls of Argyle, Annandale, and Breadalbane, withdrew from their  councils and repaired to England. Montgomery, terrified at their  defection, went privately to London, after he had hinted something  of the plot to Melvil, and solicited a pass from the queen, which was  refused. Annandale, having received information that Montgomery had  disclosed all the particulars of the negotiation, threw himself upon the  queen's mercy, and discovered all he knew of the conspiracy. As lie had  not treated with any of the malcontents in England, they remained secure  from his evidence; but he informed against Nevil Payne, who had been  sent down as their agent to Scotland, where he now resided. He was  immediately apprehended by the council of that kingdom, in consequence  of a letter from the earl of Nottingham; and twice put to the torture,  which he resolutely bore, without discovering his employers. Montgomery  still absconded in London, soliciting a pardon; but finding he could not  obtain it, except on condition of making a full discovery, he  abandoned his country, and chose to die in exile rather than betray his  confederates. This disunion of the conspirators, and discovery of the  plot, left the earl of Melvil in possession of a greater majority;  though even this he was fain to secure by overstraining his instructions  in the articles of patronage, and the supremacy of the crown, which he  yielded up to the fury of the fanatic presbyterians, contrary to the  intention of king William. In lieu of these, however, they indulged him  with the tax of chimney or hearth-money; as well as with a test to be  imposed upon all persons in office or parliament, declaring William and  Mary their lawful sovereigns, and renouncing the pretended title of king  James. All the laws in favour of episcopacy were repealed. Threescore  of the presbyterian ministers, who had been ejected at the restoration,  were still alive; and these the parliament declared the only sound part  of the church. The government of it was lodged in their hands; and  they were empowered to admit such as they should think proper to their  assistance. A few furious fanatics being thus associated, proceeded with  ungovernable violence to persecute the episcopal party, exercising the  very same tyranny against which they themselves had so loudly exclaimed.          THE TORY INTEREST PREVAILS IN THE NEW PARLIAMENT.    While the presbyterian interest thus triumphed in Scotland, the  two parties that divided England employed their whole influence and  attention in managing the elections for a new parliament; and the tories  obtained the victory. The king seemed gradually falling into the arms of  this party. They complained of their having been totally excluded from  the lieutenancy of London at the king's accession to the crown; and  now a considerable number of the most violent tories in the city were  admitted into the commission by the interest and address of the bishop  of London, the marquis of Carmarthen, and the earl of Nottingham. To  gratify that party, the earls of Monmouth and Warrington were dismissed  from their employments; nay, when the parliament met on the twentieth  day of March, the commons chose for their speaker sir John Trevor, a  violent partisan of that faction, who had been created master of the  rolls by the late king. He was a bold artful man, and undertook to  procure a majority to be at the devotion of the court, provided  he should be supplied with the necessary sums for the purposes of  corruption. William, finding there was no other way of maintaining his  administration in peace, thought proper to countenance the practice of  purchasing votes, and appointed Trevor first commissioner of the great  seal. In his speech to the new parliament, he gave them to understand  that he still persisted in his resolution of going in person to Ireland.  He desired they would make a settlement of the revenue, or establish it  for the present as a fund of credit, upon which the necessary sums for  the service of government might be immediately advanced; he signified  his intention of sending to them an act of grace, with a few exceptions,  that he might manifest his readiness to extend his protection to all his  subjects, and leave no colour of excuse for raising disturbances in  his absence, as he knew how busy some ill-affected men were in their  endeavours to alter the established government; he recommended an union  with Scotland, the parliament of which had appointed commissioners for  that purpose; he told them he should leave the administration in the  hands of the queen, and desired they would prepare an act to confirm her  authority; he exhorted them to dispatch the business for which they were  assembled, to avoid debates, and expressed his hope that they should  soon meet again to finish what might be now left imperfect.          BILL FOR RECOGNISING THEIR MAJESTIES.    The commons, in compliance with his request, voted a supply of twelve  hundred thousand pounds, one million of that sum to be raised by a  clause of credit in the revenue bills; but he could not prevail  upon them to settle the revenue for life. They granted, however, the  hereditary excise for that term, but the customs for four years only.  They considered this short term as the best security the kingdom could  have for frequent parliaments; though this precaution was not at all  agreeable to their sovereign. A poll-bill was likewise passed, other  supplies were granted, and both parties seemed to court his majesty  by advancing money on those funds of credit. The whigs, however, had  another battery in reserve. They produced, in the upper house, a bill  for recognising their majesties as the rightful and lawful sovereign of  these realms, and for declaring all"]]]
