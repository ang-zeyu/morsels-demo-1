After repeating this operation, they       finally succeeded in obtaining from the atmospheric nitrogen a       small volume of gas which would not combine with magnesium and       hence could not be nitrogen. This proved to be a new element,       to which they gave the name _argon_. As predicted, this new       element was found to be heavier than nitrogen, its density as       compared with hydrogen as a standard being approximately 20,       that of nitrogen being only 14. About 1% of the atmospheric       nitrogen proved to be argon. The new element is characterized       by having no affinity for other elements. Even under the most       favorable conditions it has not been made to combine with any       other element. On this account it was given the name argon,       signifying lazy or idle. Like nitrogen, it is colorless,       odorless, and tasteless. It has been liquefied and solidified.       Its boiling point is -187 deg..         Helium was first found in the gases expelled from certain       minerals by heating. Through the agency of the spectroscope it       had been known to exist in the sun long before its presence on       the earth had been demonstrated,--a fact suggested by the name       helium, signifying the sun. Its existence in traces in the       atmosphere has also been proven. It was first liquefied by       Onnes in July, 1908. Its boiling point, namely -269 deg., is the       lowest temperature yet reached.         The remaining elements of this group--neon, krypton, and       xenon--have been obtained from liquid air. When liquid air is       allowed to boil, the constituents which are the most difficult       to liquefy, and which therefore have the lowest boiling points,       vaporize first, followed by the others in the order of their       boiling points. It is possible in this way to make at least a       partial separation of the air into its constituents, and Ramsay       thus succeeded in obtaining from liquid air not only the known       constituents, including argon and helium, but also the new       elements, neon, krypton, and xenon. These elements, as well as       helium, all proved to be similar to argon in that they are       without chemical activity, apparently forming no compounds       whatever. The percentages present in the air are very small.       The names, neon, krypton, xenon, signify respectively, new,       hidden, stranger.      EXERCISES    1.

The term _air_ is generally applied to a  limited portion of this envelope, although the two words are often used  interchangeably. Many references have already been made to the  composition and properties of the atmosphere. These statements must now  be collected and discussed somewhat more in detail.    ~Air formerly regarded as an element.~ Like water, air was at first  regarded as elementary in character. Near the close of the eighteenth  century Scheele, Priestley, and Lavoisier showed by their experiments  that it is a mixture of at least two gases,--those which we now call  oxygen and nitrogen. By burning substances in an inclosed volume of air  and noting the contraction in volume due to the removal of the oxygen,  they were able to determine with some accuracy the relative volumes of  oxygen and nitrogen present in the air.    ~The constituents of the atmosphere.~ The constituents of the atmosphere  may be divided into two general groups: those which are essential to  life and those which are not essential.    1. _Constituents essential to life._ In addition to oxygen and nitrogen  at least two other substances, namely, carbon dioxide and water vapor,  must be present in the atmosphere in order that life may exist. The  former of these is a gaseous compound of carbon and oxygen having the  formula CO_{2}. Its properties will be discussed in detail in the  chapter on the compounds of carbon. Its presence in the air may be shown  by causing the air to bubble through a solution of calcium hydroxide  (Ca(OH)_{2}), commonly called lime water. The carbon dioxide combines  with the calcium hydroxide in accordance with the following equation:        Ca(OH)_{2} + CO_{2} = CaCO_{3} + H_{2}O.    The resulting calcium carbonate (CaCO_{3}) is insoluble in water and  separates in the form of a white powder, which causes the solution to  appear milky.    The presence of water vapor is readily shown by its condensation on cold  objects as well as by the fact that a bit of calcium chloride when  exposed to the air becomes moist, and may even dissolve in the water  absorbed from the air.    2. _Constituents not essential to life._ In addition to the essential  constituents, the air contains small percentages of various other gases,  the presence of which so far as is known is not essential to life. This  list includes the rare elements, argon, helium, neon, krypton, and  xenon; also hydrogen, ammonia, hydrogen dioxide, and probably ozone.  Certain minute forms of life (germs) are also present, the decay of  organic matter being due to their presence.         ~Function of each of the essential constituents.~ (1) The oxygen       directly supports life through respiration. (2) The nitrogen,       on account of its inactivity, serves to dilute the oxygen, and       while contrary to the older views, it is possible that life       might continue to exist in the absence of the atmospheric       nitrogen, yet the conditions of life would be entirely changed.       Moreover, nitrogen is an essential constituent of all animal       and plant life. It was formerly supposed that neither animals       nor plants could assimilate the free nitrogen, but it has been       shown recently that the plants of at least one natural order,       the Leguminosae, to which belong the beans, peas, and clover,       have the power of directly assimilating the free nitrogen from       the atmosphere. This is accomplished through the agency of       groups of bacteria, which form colonies in little tubercles on       the roots of the plants. These bacteria probably assist in the       absorption of nitrogen by changing the free nitrogen into       compounds which can be assimilated by the plant. Fig. 27 shows       the tubercles on the roots of a variety of bean. (3) The       presence of water vapor in the air is necessary to prevent       excessive evaporation from both plants and animals. (4) Carbon       dioxide is an essential plant food.    [Illustration: Fig. 27]    ~The quantitative analysis of air.~ A number of different methods have  been devised for the determination of the percentages of the  constituents present in the atmosphere. Among these are the following.    1. _Determination of oxygen._ (1) The oxygen is withdrawn from a  measured volume of air inclosed in a tube, by means of phosphorus.         To make the determination, a graduated tube is filled with       water and inverted in a vessel of water. Air is introduced into       the tube until it is partially filled with the gas. The volume       of the inclosed air is carefully noted and reduced to standard       conditions. A small piece of phosphorus is attached to a wire       and brought within the tube as shown in Fig. 28. After a few       hours the oxygen in the inclosed air will have combined with       the phosphorus, the water rising to take its place. The       phosphorus is removed and the volume is again noted and reduced       to standard conditions. The contraction in the volume of the       air is equal to the volume of oxygen absorbed.    [Illustration: Fig. 28]    (2) The oxygen may also be estimated by passing a measured volume of air  through a tube containing copper heated to a high temperature. The  oxygen in the air combines with the copper to form copper oxide (CuO).  Hence the increase in the weight of the copper equals the weight of the  oxygen in the volume of air taken.    (3) A more accurate method is the following. A eudiometer tube is filled  with mercury and inverted in a vessel of the same liquid. A convenient  amount of air is then introduced into the tube and its volume accurately  noted. There is then introduced more than sufficient hydrogen to combine  with the oxygen present in the inclosed air, and the volume is again  accurately noted. The mixture is then exploded by an electric spark, and  the volume is once more taken. By subtracting this volume from the total  volume of the air and hydrogen there is obtained the contraction in  volume due to the union of the oxygen and"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/20851"],[0,"Character Sketches of Romance, Fiction and the Drama, Vol. 3 (#16)"],[1,"Antonio, the usurping duke.

Over the river was a bridge of a  thousand arches, but only three score and ten were unbroken. By these,  men were crossing, the arches representing the number of years the  traveller lived before he tumbled into the river. Lastly, he saw the  happy valley, but when he asked to see the secrets hidden under the dark  clouds on the other side, the vision was ended, and he only beheld the  valley of Bagdad, with its oxen, sheep, and camels grazing on its  sides.--Addison, _Vision of Mirza_ (_Spectator_, 159).      =Misbegot= (_Malcolm_), natural son of Sybil Knockwinnock, and an ancestor  of Sir Arthur Wardour.--Sir W.

Next, a sun-fish was  persuaded to try the bait, with the same result. Then the sturgeon, in  anger, swallowed Hiawatha and canoe also; but Hiawatha smote the heart  of the sturgeon with his fist, and the king of fishes swam to the shore  and died. Then the sea-gulls opened a rift in the dead body, out of  which Hiawatha made his escape.        \"I have slain the Mish[^e]-Nahma,      Slain the king of fishes\" said he.
