The world is up--for freedom moving,    The thunders' distant roar we hear--  From land to land the free are calling,    And slaves with joy and rapture hear.      Vote on! vote on, &c.          March on! March on!    TUNE:--\"_The Pirate's Glee_.\"      March on! march on, ye friends of freedom for all,    For truth and right contend;  Be ever ready at humanity's call,    Till tyrant's power shall end.  The proud slave-holders rule the nation,    The people's groans are loud and long;  Arouse, ye men, in every station,    And join to crush the power of wrong.--March on, etc.    Fight on! fight on, ye brave till victory's won,    And justice shall prevail;  Till all shall feel the rays of liberty's sun,    Streaming o'er hill and dale.  The tyrants know their guilt and tremble,    The glowing light of truth they fear;  Then let them all their hosts assemble,    And Slavery's dreadful sentence hear.      Fight on! fight on, &c.    Roll on! roll on, ye brave, the liberty car,    Our country's name to save;  Soon shall our land be known to nations afar,    As the home of the free and brave.  The voice of freemen loud hath spoken,    A brighter day we soon shall see;  When Slavery's chains shall all be broken,    And all the captive millions free.      Roll on, roll on, &c.

She had been  engaged to me, and she would have married me, I believe, if I had taken  over another profession; but she would have nothing to do with anything  on the cross. It was only after her marriage to this Englishman that I  was able to find out where she was. I wrote to her, but got no answer.  After that I came over, and, as letters were no use, I put my messages  where she could read them.    \"Well, I have been here a month now. I lived in that farm, where I had  a room down below, and could get in and out every night, and no one the  wiser. I tried all I could to coax Elsie away. I knew that she read the  messages, for once she wrote an answer under one of them. Then my temper  got the better of me, and I began to threaten her. She sent me a letter  then, imploring me to go away and saying that it would break her heart  if any scandal should come upon her husband. She said that she would  come down when her husband was asleep at three in the morning, and speak  with me through the end window, if I would go away afterwards and leave  her in peace. She came down and brought money with her, trying to bribe  me to go. This made me mad, and I caught her arm and tried to pull  her through the window. At that moment in rushed the husband with his  revolver in his hand. Elsie had sunk down upon the floor, and we were  face to face. I was heeled also, and I held up my gun to scare him off  and let me get away. He fired and missed me. I pulled off almost at the  same instant, and down he dropped. I made away across the garden, and as  I went I heard the window shut behind me. That's God's truth, gentlemen,  every word of it, and I heard no more about it until that lad came  riding up with a note which made me walk in here, like a jay, and give  myself into your hands.\"    A cab had driven up whilst the American had been talking. Two uniformed  policemen sat inside. Inspector Martin rose and touched his prisoner on  the shoulder.    \"It is time for us to go.\"    \"Can I see her first?\"    \"No, she is not conscious. Mr. Sherlock Holmes, I only hope that if ever  again I have an important case I shall have the good fortune to have you  by my side.\"    We stood at the window and watched the cab drive away. As I turned back  my eye caught the pellet of paper which the prisoner had tossed upon the  table. It was the note with which Holmes had decoyed him.    \"See if you can read it, Watson,\" said he, with a smile.    It contained no word, but this little line of dancing men:--    GRAPHIC    \"If you use the code which I have explained,\" said Holmes, \"you will  find that it simply means 'Come here at once.' I was convinced that  it was an invitation which he would not refuse, since he could never  imagine that it could come from anyone but the lady. And so, my dear  Watson, we have ended by turning the dancing men to good when they have  so often been the agents of evil, and I think that I have fulfilled my  promise of giving you something unusual for your note-book. Three-forty  is our train, and I fancy we should be back in Baker Street for dinner.\"      Only one word of epilogue. The American, Abe Slaney, was condemned to  death at the winter assizes at Norwich; but his penalty was changed to  penal servitude in consideration of mitigating circumstances, and the  certainty that Hilton Cubitt had fired the first shot. Of Mrs. Hilton  Cubitt I only know that I have heard she recovered entirely, and that  she still remains a widow, devoting her whole life to the care of the  poor and to the administration of her husband's estate.    *****                           THE STRAND MAGAZINE                      Vol. 27  JANUARY, 1904                  THE RETURN OF SHERLOCK HOLMES.                      By ARTHUR CONAN DOYLE.          IV.--The Adventure of the Solitary Cyclist.      FROM the years 1894 to 1901 inclusive Mr. Sherlock Holmes was a very  busy man. It is safe to say that there was no public case of any  difficulty in which he was not consulted during those eight years, and  there were hundreds of private cases, some of them of the most intricate  and extraordinary character, in which he played a prominent part. Many  startling successes and a few unavoidable failures were the outcome of  this long period of continuous work. As I have preserved very full notes  of all these cases, and was myself personally engaged in many of them,  it may be imagined that it is no easy task to know which I should select  to lay before the public. I shall, however, preserve my former rule, and  give the preference to those cases which derive their interest not so  much from the brutality of the crime as from the ingenuity and dramatic  quality of the solution. For this reason I will now lay before the  reader the facts connected with Miss Violet Smith, the solitary cyclist  of Charlington, and the curious sequel of our investigation, which  culminated in unexpected tragedy. It is true that the circumstances  did not admit of any striking illustration of those powers for which my  friend was famous, but there were some points about the case which made  it stand out in those long records of crime from which I gather the  material for these little narratives.    On referring to my note-book for the year 1895 I find that it was upon  Saturday, the 23rd of April, that we first heard of Miss Violet Smith.  Her visit was, I remember, extremely unwelcome to Holmes, for he was  immersed at the moment in a very abstruse and complicated problem  concerning the peculiar persecution to which John Vincent Harden, the  well-known tobacco millionaire, had been subjected. My friend, who  loved above all things precision and concentration of thought, resented  anything which distracted his attention from the matter in hand. And yet  without a harshness which was foreign to his nature it was impossible  to refuse to listen to the story of the young and beautiful woman, tall,  graceful, and queenly, who presented herself at Baker Street late in the  evening and implored his assistance and advice. It was vain to urge that  his time was already fully occupied, for the young lady had come with  the determination to tell her story, and it was evident that nothing  short of force could get her out of the room until she had done so. With  a resigned air and a somewhat weary smile, Holmes begged the beautiful  intruder to take a seat and to inform us what it was that was troubling  her.    \"At least it cannot be your health,\" said he, as his keen eyes darted  over her; \"so ardent a bicyclist must be full of energy.\"    She glanced down in surprise at her own feet, and I observed the slight  roughening of the side of the sole caused by the friction of the edge of  the pedal.    \"Yes, I bicycle a good deal, Mr. Holmes, and that has something to do  with my visit to you to-day.\"    My friend took the lady's ungloved hand and examined it with as close  an attention and as little sentiment as a scientist would show to a  specimen.    \"You will excuse me, I am sure. It is my business,\" said he, as he  dropped it. \"I nearly fell into the error of supposing that you were  typewriting. Of course, it is obvious that it is music. You observe the  spatulate finger-end, Watson, which is common to both professions? There  is a spirituality about the face, however\"--he gently turned it towards  the light--\"which the typewriter does not generate. This lady is a  musician.\"    \"Yes, Mr. Holmes, I teach music.\"    \"In the country, I presume, from your complexion.\"    \"Yes, sir; near Farnham, on the borders of Surrey.\"    \"A beautiful neighbourhood and full of the most interesting  associations. You remember, Watson, that it was near there that we took  Archie Stamford, the forger. Now, Miss Violet, what has happened to you  near Farnham, on the borders of Surrey?\"    The young lady, with great clearness and composure, made the following  curious statement:--    \"My father is dead, Mr. Holmes. He was James Smith, who conducted the  orchestra at the old Imperial Theatre. My mother and I were left without  a relation in the world except one uncle, Ralph Smith, who went to  Africa twenty-five years ago, and we have never had a word from him  since. When father died we were left very poor, but one day we were  told that there was an advertisement in the TIMES inquiring for our  whereabouts. You can imagine how excited we were, for we thought that  someone had left us a fortune. We went at once to the lawyer whose name  was given in the paper. There we met two gentlemen, Mr. Carruthers and  Mr. Woodley, who were home on a visit from South Africa. They said that  my uncle was a friend of theirs, that he died some months before in  great poverty in Johannesburg, and that he had asked them with his last  breath to hunt up his relations and see that they were in no want. It  seemed strange to us that Uncle Ralph, who took no notice of us when he  was alive, should be so careful to look after us when he was dead; but  Mr. Carruthers explained that the reason was that my uncle had just  heard of the death of his brother, and so felt responsible for our  fate.\"    \"Excuse me,\" said Holmes; \"when was this interview?\"    \"Last December--four months ago.\"    \"Pray proceed.\"    \"Mr. Woodley seemed to me to be a most odious person. He was for ever  making eyes at me--a coarse, puffy-faced, red-moustached young man, with  his hair plastered down on each side of his forehead. I thought that he  was perfectly hateful--and I was sure that Cyril would not wish me to  know such a person.\"    \"Oh, Cyril is his name!\" said Holmes, smiling.    The young lady blushed and laughed.    \"Yes, Mr. Holmes; Cyril Morton, an electrical engineer, and we hope  to be married at the end of the summer. Dear me, how DID I get talking  about him? What I wished to say was that Mr. Woodley was perfectly  odious,"]]]
