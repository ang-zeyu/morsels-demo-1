The articles were no  sooner signed, than Lord Clinton, the admiral, who had been detained by  contrary winds, appeared off the harbor with a reenforcement of three  thousand men; and found the place surrendered to the enemy. To increase  the misfortune, the infected army brought the plague with them into  England, where it swept off great multitudes, particularly in the  city of London. Above twenty thousand persons there died of it in one  year.[****] [6]         * Forbes, vol. ii. p. 377, 498.         ** Forbes, vol. ii. p. 450, 458.         *** Forbes, vol. ii. p. 498.         **** See note F, at the end of the volume.    Elizabeth, whose usual vigor and foresight had not appeared in this  transaction, was now glad to compound matters; and as the queen  regent desired to obtain leisure, in order to prepare measures for the  extermination of the Hugonots, she readily hearkened to any reasonable  terms of accommodation with England.[*]         * Davila, lib. iii.    {1564.} It was agreed, that the hostages which the French had given for  the restitution of Calais, should be restored for two hundred and twenty  thousand crowns; and that both sides should retain all their claims and  pretensions.    The peace still continued with Scotland and even a cordial friendship  seemed to have been cemented between Elizabeth and Mary. These  princesses made profession of the most entire affection; wrote amicable  letters every week to each other; and had adopted, in all appearance,  the sentiments as well as style of sisters. Elizabeth punished one  Hales, who had published a book against Mary's title;[*] and as the lord  keeper Bacon was thought to have encouraged Hales in this undertaking,  he fell under her displeasure, and it was with some difficulty he was  able to give her satisfaction, and recover her favor.[**] The two queens  had agreed in the foregoing summer to an interview at York,[***] in  order to remove all difficulties with regard to Mary's ratification  of the treaty of Edinburgh, and to consider of the proper method for  settling the succession of England; but as Elizabeth carefully avoided  touching on this delicate subject, she employed a pretence of the wars  in France, which, she said, would detain her in London; and she delayed  till next year the intended interview. It is also probable, that being  well acquainted with the beauty, and address, and accomplishments of  Mary, she did not choose to stand the comparison with regard to those  exterior qualities, in which she was eclipsed by her rival; and was  unwilling that a princess, who had already made great progress in the  esteem and affections of the English, should have a further opportunity  of increasing the number of her partisans.         * Keith, p. 252.         ** Keith, p. 253.         *** Haynes, p. 388.    Mary's close connections with the house of Guise, and her devoted  attachment to her uncles, by whom she had been early educated and  constantly protected, was the ground of just and insurmountable jealousy  to Elizabeth, who regarded them as her mortal and declared enemies,  and was well acquainted with their dangerous character and ambitious  projects. They had made offer of their niece to Don Carlos, Philip's  son; to the king of Sweden, the king of Navarre, the archduke Charles,  the duke of Ferrara, the cardinal of Bourbon, who had only taken  deacon's orders, from which he might easily be freed by a dispensation;  and they were ready to marry her to any one who could strengthen their  interests, or give inquietude and disturbance to Elizabeth.[*]         * Forbes, vol. ii. p. 287. Strype, vol. i. p. 400.    Elizabeth, on her part, was equally vigilant to prevent the execution  of their schemes, and was particularly anxious lest Mary should form  any powerful foreign alliance, which might tempt her to revive her  pretensions to the crown, and to invade the kingdom on the side where it  was weakest and lay most exposed.[*] As she believed that the marriage  with the archduke Charles was the one most likely to have place, she  used every expedient to prevent it; and besides remonstrating against  it to Mary herself, she endeavored to draw off the archduke from that  pursuit, by giving him some hopes of success in his pretensions to  herself, and by inviting him to a renewal of the former treaty of  marriage.[**] She always told the queen of Scots, that nothing would  satisfy her but her espousing some English nobleman, who would remove  all grounds of jealousy, and cement the union between the kingdoms; and  she offered on this condition to have her title examined, and to declare  her successor to the crown.[***] After keeping the matter in these  general terms during a twelvemonth, she at last named Lord Robert  Dudley, now created earl of Leicester, as the person on whom she desired  that Mary's choice should fall.    [Illustration: 1-453-mary_stuart.jpg MARY STUART]    The earl of Leicester, the great and powerful favorite of Elizabeth,  possessed all those exterior qualities which are naturally alluring  to the fair sex; a handsome person, a polite address, an insinuating  behavior; and by means of these accomplishments he had been able to  blind even the penetration of Elizabeth, and conceal from her the great  defects, or rather odious vices, which attended his character. He  was proud, insolent, interested, ambitious; without honor, without  generosity, without humanity; and atoned not for these bad qualities  by such abilities or courage as could fit him for that high trust and  confidence with which she always honored him. Her constant and declared  attachment to him had naturally emboldened him to aspire to her bed; and  in order to make way for these nuptials, he was universally believed  to have murdered, in a barbarous manner, his wife, the heiress of one  Robesart. The proposal of espousing Mary was by no means agreeable to  him; and he always ascribed it to the contrivance of Cecil, his  enemy; who, he thought, intended by that artifice to make him lose the  friendship of Mary from the temerity of his pretensions, and that of  Elizabeth from jealousy of his attachments to another woman.[****]         * Keith, p 247, 284.         ** Melvil, p. 41.         *** Keith, p. 213, 249, 259. 265.         **** Camden, p. 396    The queen herself had not any serious intention of effecting this  marriage, but as she was desirous that the queen of Scots should never  have any husband, she named a man who, she believed, was not likely to  be accepted of; and she hoped by that means to gain time, and elude the  project of any other alliance. The earl of Leicester was too great a  favorite to be parted with; and when Mary, allured by the prospect of  being declared successor to the crown, seemed at last to hearken  to Elizabeth's proposal, this princess receded from her offers, and  withdrew the bait which she had thrown out to her rival.[*] This  duplicity of conduct, joined to some appearance of an imperious  superiority assumed by her, had drawn a peevish letter from Mary; and  the seemingly amicable correspondence between the two queens was, during  some time, interrupted. In order to make up the breach, the queen of  Scots despatched Sir James Melvil to London; who has given us in his  memoirs a particular account of his negotiation.    Melvil was an agreeable courtier, a man of address and conversation;  and it was recommended to him by his mistress, that, besides grave  reasonings concerning politics and state affairs, he should introduce  more entertaining topics of conversation, suitable to the sprightly  character of Elizabeth, and should endeavor by that means to insinuate  himself into her confidence. He succeeded so well, that he threw that  artful princess entirely off her guard,[**] and made her discover the  bottom of her heart, full of all those levities, and follies, and ideas  of rivalship which possess the youngest and most frivolous of her sex.         * Keith, p. 269, 270. Appendix, p, 158. Strype, vol. i. p.       414.         ** Haynes, p. 447.    He talked to her of his travels, and forgot not to mention the different  dresses of the ladies in different countries, and the particular  advantages of each in setting off the beauties of the shape and person.  The queen said, that she had dresses of all countries; and she took care  thenceforth to meet the ambassador every day apparelled in a different  habit: sometimes she was dressed in the English garb, sometimes in the  French, sometimes in the Italian; and she asked him which of them  became her most. He answered, the Italian; a reply that he knew would  be agreeable to her, because that mode showed to advantage her flowing  locks, which, he remarked, though they were more red than yellow, she  fancied to be the finest in the world. She desired to know of him what  was reputed the best color of hair: she asked whether his queen or she  had the finest hair: she even inquired which of them he esteemed the  fairest person; a very delicate question, and which he prudently eluded,  by saying that her majesty was the fairest person in England and his  mistress in Scotland. She next demanded which of them was tallest:  he replied, his queen. \"Then is she too tall,\" said Elizabeth; \"for I  myself am of a just stature.\" Having learned from him that his mistress  sometimes recreated herself by playing on the harpsichord, an instrument  on which she herself excelled, she gave orders to Lord Hunsdon, that he  should lead the ambassador, as it were casually, into an apartment where  he might"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/19215"],[0,"The History of England in Three Volumes, Vol. I., Part E. (#16)"],[1,"to embrace a  measure which ought to have been the result of reason and sound policy:  he made peace with the two crowns against which he had hitherto waged  a war, entered into without necessity, and conducted without glory.  Notwithstanding the distracted and helpless condition of England, no  attempt was made either by France or Spain to invade their enemy nor did  they entertain any further project than to defend themselves against the  feeble and ill-concerted expeditions of that kingdom. Pleased that the  jealousies and quarrels, between king and parliament had disarmed so  formidable a power, they carefully avoided any enterprise which might  rouse either the terror or anger of the English, and dispose them to  domestic union and submission. The endeavors to regain the good will of  the nation were carried so far by the king of Spain, that he generously  released and sent home all the English prisoners taken in the expedition  against Cadiz. The example was imitated by France after the retreat of  the English from the Isle of Rhe. When princes were in such  dispositions, and had so few pretensions on each other, it could not be  difficult to conclude a peace. The treaty was first signed with  France.[*] The situation of the king's affairs did not entitle him to  demand any conditions for the Hugonots, and they were abandoned to the  will of their sovereign.    {1630.} Peace was afterwards  concluded with Spain, where no conditions were made in favor of the  palatine, except that Spain promised in general to use their good  offices for his restoration.[**] The influence of these two wars on  domestic affairs, and on the dispositions of king and people, was of the  utmost consequence; but no alteration was made by them on the foreign  interests of the kingdom.         * Rushworth, vol. ii. p. 23, 24.         ** Rushworth, vol. ii. p. 75. Whitlocke, p. 14.    Nothing more happy can be imagined than the situation in which England  then stood with regard to foreign affairs. Europe was divided between  the rival families of Bourbon and Austria, whose opposite interests, and  still more, their mutual jealousies, secured the tranquillity of this  island. Their forces were so nearly counterpoised, that no apprehensions  were entertained of any event which could suddenly disturb the balance  of power between them. The Spanish monarch, deemed the most powerful,  lay at greatest distance; and the English, by that means, possessed the  advantage of being engaged by political motives into a more intimate  union and confederacy with the neighboring potentate. The dispersed  situation of the Spanish dominions rendered the naval power of England  formidable to them, and kept that empire in continual dependence. France,  more vigorous and more compact, was every day rising in policy and  discipline; and reached at last an equality of power with the house of  Austria; but her progress, slow and gradual, left it still in the power  of England, by a timely interposition, to check her superiority.  And thus Charles, could he have avoided all dissensions with his own  subjects, was in a situation to make himself be courted and respected by  every power in Europe; and, what has scarcely ever since been attained  by the princes of this island, he could either be active with dignity,  or neutral with security.    A neutrality was embraced by the king; and during the rest of his reign,  he seems to have little regarded foreign affairs, except so far as he  was engaged by honor and by friendship for his sister and the palatine,  to endeavor the procuring of some relief for that unhappy family. He  joined his good offices to those of France, and mediated a peace between  the kings of Sweden and Poland, in hopes of engaging the former to  embrace the protection of the oppressed Protestants in the empire. This  was the famed Gustavus, whose heroic genius, seconded by the wisest  policy, made him in a little time the most distinguished monarch of the  age, and rendered his country, formerly unknown and neglected, of great  weight in the balance of Europe. To encourage and assist him in his  projected invasion of Germany, Charles agreed to furnish him with six  thousand men; but, that he might preserve the appearance of neutrality,  he made use of the marquis of Hamilton's name.[*]         * Rushworth, vol. i. p. 46, 53, 62. 83.    That nobleman entered into an engagement with Gustavus; and enlisting  these troops in England and Scotland, at Charles's expense, he landed  them in the Elbe. The decisive battle of Leipsic was fought soon after,  where the conduct of Tilly and the valor of the imperialists were  overcome by the superior conduct of Gustavus and the superior valor of  the Swedes. What remained of this hero's life was one continued series  of victory, for which he was less beholden to fortune than to those  personal endowments which he derived from nature and from industry. That  rapid progress of conquest which we so much admire in ancient history,  was here renewed in modern annals; and without that cause to which,  in former ages, it had ever been owing. Military nations were not now  engaged against an undisciplined and unwarlike people; nor heroes set in  opposition to cowards. The veteran troops of Ferdinand, conducted by the  most celebrated generals of the age, were foiled in every encounter; and  all Germany was overrun in an instant by the victorious Swede. But by  this extraordinary and unexpected success of his ally, Charles failed  of the purpose for which he framed the alliance. Gustavus, elated by  prosperity, began to form more extensive plans of ambition; and in  freeing Germany from the yoke of Ferdinand, he intended to reduce it  to subjection under his own. He refused to restore the palatine to his  principality, except on conditions which would have kept him in total  dependence.[*] And thus the negotiation was protracted, till the battle  of Lutzen, where the Swedish monarch perished in the midst of a complete  victory which he obtained over his enemies.    We have carried on these transactions a few years beyond the present  period, that we might not be obliged to return to them, nor be  henceforth interrupted in our account of Charles's court and kingdoms.         * Franklyn, vol. i. p. 415.    When we consider Charles as presiding in his court, as associating  with his family, it is difficult to imagine a character at once more  respectable and more amiable. A kind husband, an indulgent father, a  gentle master, a steadfast friend; to all these eulogies his conduct  in private life fully entitled him. As a monarch too, in the exterior  qualities, he excelled; in the essential, he was not defective.  His address and manner, though perhaps inclining a little towards  stateliness and formality, in the main corresponded to his high rank,  and gave grace to that reserve and gravity which were natural to him.  The moderation and equity which shone forth in his temper seemed to  secure him against rash and dangerous enterprises: the good sense which  he displayed in his discourse and conversation, seemed to warrant his  success in every reasonable undertaking. Other endowments likewise he  had attained, which, in a private gentleman, would have been highly  ornamental, and which, in a great monarch, might have proved extremely  useful to his people. He was possessed of an excellent taste in all  the fine arts; and the love of painting was in some degree his favorite  passion. Learned beyond what is common in princes, he was a good judge  of writing in others, and enjoyed himself no mean talent in composition.  In any other age or nation, this monarch had been secure of a prosperous  and a happy reign. But the high idea of his own authority which he had  imbibed, made him incapable of giving way to the spirit of liberty which  began to prevail among his subjects. His politics were not supported  by such vigor and foresight as might enable him to subdue their  pretensions, and maintain his prerogative at the high pitch to which  it had been raised by his predecessors. And, above all, the spirit of  enthusiasm, being universally diffused, disappointed all the views  of human prudence, and disturbed the operation of every motive which  usually influences society.     But the misfortunes arising from these  causes were yet remote. Charles now enjoyed himself in the full  exercise of his authority, in a social intercourse with his friends  and courtiers, and in a moderate use of those pleasures which he most  affected.    After the death of Buckingham, who had somewhat alienated Charles from  the queen, she is to be considered as his chief friend and favorite.  That rustic contempt of the fair sex which James affected, and which,  banishing them from his court, made it resemble more a fair or  an exchange than the seat of a great prince, was very wide of the  disposition of this monarch. But though full of complaisance to the  whole sex, Charles reserved all his passion for his consort, to whom he  attached himself with unshaken fidelity and confidence. By her sense  and spirit, as well as by her beauty, she justified the fondness of  her husband; though it is allowed that, being somewhat of a passionate  temper, she precipitated him into hasty and imprudent measures. Her  religion likewise, to which she was much addicted, must be regarded as  a great misfortune; since it augmented the jealousy which prevailed  against the court, and engaged her to procure for the Catholics some  indulgences which were generally distasteful to the nation.[*]    In the former situation of the English government, when the sovereign  was in a great measure independent of his subjects, the king chose  his ministers either from personal favor, or from an opinion of their  abilities, without any regard to their parliamentary interest or  talents. It has since been the maxim of princes, wherever popular  leaders encroach too"]]]
