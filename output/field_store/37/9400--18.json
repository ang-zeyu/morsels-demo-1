It is in the elevation  and depression (_abaissement_) of the moon above and below the celestial  equator that we should seek for the most constant of these causes.    With his usual facility in such matters, he was not long in advancing a  theory, according to which the atmosphere is regarded as resembling the  sea, having a surface, waves, and storms; it ought likewise to have a  flux and reflux, for the moon ought to exercise the same influence upon  it that it does on the ocean. In the temperate and frigid zones,  therefore, the wind, which is only the tide of the atmosphere, must  depend greatly on the declination of the moon; it ought to blow toward  the pole that is nearest to it, and advancing in that direction only, in  order to reach every place, traversing dry countries or extensive seas,  it ought then to render the sky serene or stormy. If the influence of  the moon on the weather is denied, it is only that it may be referred to  its phases, but its position in the ecliptic is regarded as affording  probabilities much nearer the truth.[58]    In each of these annuals Lamarck took great care to avoid making any  positive predictions. \"No one,\" he says, \"could make these predictions  without deceiving himself and abusing the confidence of persons who  might place reliance on them.\" He only intended to propose simple  probabilities.    After the publication of the first of these annuals, at the request of  Lamarck, who had made it the subject of a memoir read to the Institute  in 1800 (9 ventose, l'an IX.), Chaptal, Minister of the Interior,  thought it well to establish in France a regular correspondence of  meteorological observations made daily at different points remote from  each other, and he conferred the direction of it on Lamarck. This system  of meteorological reports lasted but a short time, and was not  maintained by Chaptal's successor. After three of these annual reports  had appeared, Lamarck rather suddenly stopped publishing them, and an  incident occurred in connection with their cessation which led to the  story that he had suffered ill treatment and neglect from Napoleon I.    It has been supposed that Lamarck, who was frank and at times brusque in  character, had made some enemies, and that he had been represented to  the Emperor as a maker of almanacs and of weather predictions, and that  Napoleon, during a reception, showing to Lamarck his great  dissatisfaction with the annuals, had ordered him to stop their  publication.    But according to Bourguin's statement this is not the correct version.  He tells us:      \"According to traditions preserved in the family of Lamarck things    did not happen so at all. During a reception given to the Institute    at the Tuileries, Napoleon, who really liked Lamarck, spoke to him    in a jocular way about his weather probabilities, and Lamarck, very    much provoked (_tres contrarie_) at being thus chaffed in the    presence of his colleagues, resolved to stop the publication of his    observations on the weather. What proves that this version is the    true one is that Lamarck published another annual which he had in    preparation for the year 1810. In the preface he announced that his    age, ill health, and his circumstances placed him in the unfortunate    necessity of ceasing to busy himself with this periodical work. He    ended by inviting those who had the taste for meteorological    observations, and the means of devoting their time to it, to take up    with confidence an enterprise good in itself, based on a genuine    foundation, and from which the public would derive advantageous    results.\"    These opuscles, such as they were, in which Lamarck treated different  subjects bearing on the winds, great droughts, rainy seasons, tides,  etc., became the precursors of the _Annuaires du Bureau des  Longitudes_.    An observation of Lamarck's on a rare and curious form of cloud has  quite recently been referred to by a French meteorologist. It is  probable, says M. E. Durand-Greville in _La Nature_, November 24, 1900,  that Lamarck was the first to observe the so-called pocky or festoon  cloud, or mammato-cirrus cloud, which at rare intervals has been  observed since his time.[59]    Full of over confidence in the correctness of his views formed without  reference to experiments, although Lavoisier, by his discovery of oxygen  in the years 1772-85, and other researches, had laid the foundations of  the antiphlogistic or modern chemistry, Lamarck quixotically attempted  to substitute his own speculative views for those of the discoverers of  oxygen--Priestley (1774) and the great French chemist Lavoisier.  Lamarck, in his _Hydrogeologie_ (1802), went so far as to declare:      \"It is not true, and it seems to me even absurd to believe that pure    air, which has been justly called _vital air_, and which chemists    now call _oxygen gas_, can be the radical of saline matters--namely,    can be the principle of acidity, of causticity, or any salinity    whatever. There are a thousand ways of refuting this error without    the possibility of a reply.... This hypothesis, the best of all    those which had been imagined when Lavoisier conceived it, cannot    now be longer held, since I have discovered what is really    _caloric_\" (p. 161).    After paying his respects to Priestley, he asks: \"What, then, can be the  reason why the views of chemists and mine are so opposed?\" and complains  that the former have avoided all written discussion on this subject. And  this after his three physico-chemical works, the _Refutation_, the  _Recherches_, and the _Memoires_ had appeared, and seemed to chemists to  be unworthy of a reply.    It must be admitted that Lamarck was on this occasion unduly  self-opinionated and stubborn in adhering to such views at a time when  the physical sciences were being placed on a firm and lasting basis by  experimental philosophers. The two great lessons of science--to suspend  one's judgment and to wait for more light in theoretical matters on  which scientific men were so divided--and the necessity of adhering to  his own line of biological study, where he had facts of his own  observing on which to rest his opinions, Lamarck did not seem ever to  have learned.    The excuse for his rash and quixotic course in respect to his  physico-chemical vagaries is that he had great mental activity. Lamarck  was a synthetic philosopher. He had been brought up in the encyclopaedic  period of learning. He had from his early manhood been deeply interested  in physical subjects. In middle age he probably lived a very retired  life, did not mingle with his compeers or discuss his views with them.  So that when he came to publish them, he found not a single supporter.  His speculations were received in silence and not deemed worthy of  discussion.    A very just and discriminating judge of Lamarck's work, Professor  Cleland, thus refers to his writings on physics and chemistry:      \"The most prominent defect in Lamarck must be admitted, quite apart    from all consideration of the famous hypothesis which bears his    name, to have been want of control in speculation. Doubtless the    speculative tendency furnished a powerful incentive to work, but it    outran the legitimate deductions from observation, and led him into    the production of volumes of worthless chemistry without    experimental basis, as well as into spending much time in fruitless    meteorological predictions.\" (_Encyc. Brit._, Art. LAMARCK.)    How a modern physicist regards Lamarck's views on physics may be seen by  the following statement kindly written for this book by Professor Carl  Barus of Brown University, Providence:      \"Lamarck's physical and chemical speculations, made throughout on    the basis of the alchemistic philosophy of the time, will have    little further interest to-day than as evidence showing the broadly    philosophic tendencies of Lamarck's mind. Made without experiment    and without mathematics, the contents of the three volumes will    hardly repay perusal, except by the historian interested in certain    aspects of pre-Lavoisierian science. The temerity with which    physical phenomena are referred to occult static molecules,    permeated by subtle fluids, the whole mechanism left without dynamic    quality, since the mass of the molecule is to be non-essential, is    markedly in contrast with the discredit into which such hypotheses    have now fallen. It is true that an explanation of natural phenomena    in terms \"le feu ethere, le feu calorique, et le feu fixe\" might be    interpreted with reference to the modern doctrine of energy; but it    is certain that Lamarck, antedating Fresnel, Carnot, Ampere, not to    mention their great followers, had not the faintest inkling of the    possibility of such an interpretation. Indeed, one may readily    account for the resemblance to modern views, seeing that all    speculative systems of science must to some extent run in parallel,    inasmuch as they begin with the facts of common experience. Nor were    his speculations in any degree stimulating to theoretical science.    Many of his mechanisms in which the ether operates on a plane of    equality with the air can only be regarded with amusement. The whole    of his elaborate schemes of color classification may be instanced as    forerunners of the methods commercially in vogue to-day; they are    not the harbingers of methods scientifically in vogue. One looks in    vain for research adequate to carry the load of so much speculative    text.      \"Even if we realize that the beginnings of science could but be made    amid such groping in the dark, it is a pity that a man of Lamarck's    genius, which seems to have been destitute of the instincts of an    experimentalist, should have lavished so much serious thought in    evolving a system of chemical physics out of himself.\"    The chemical status of Lamarck's writings"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/2057"],[0,"The Last of the Plainsmen (#16)"],[1,"d, in some inexplicable manner, cut  the White Mustang and two of his blacks out of the band. He had turned  them back again and was pursuing them. The bay he rode had never before  appeared to much advantage, and now, with his long, lean, powerful body  in splendid action, imbued with the relentless will of his rider, what  a picture he presented! How he did run! With all that, the White  Mustang made him look dingy and slow. Nevertheless, it was a critical  time in the wild career of that king of horses. He had been penned in a  space two hundred by five hundred yards, half of which was separated  from him by a wide ditch, a yawning chasm that he had refused, and  behind him, always keeping on the inside, wheeled the yelling hunter,  who savagely spurred his bay and whirled a deadly lasso. He had been  cut off and surrounded; the very nature of the rocks and trails of the  canyon threatened to end his freedom or his life. Certain it was he  preferred to end the latter, for he risked death from the rocks as he  went over them in long leaps.    Jones could have roped either of the two blacks, but he hardly noticed  them. Covered with dust and splotches of foam, they took their  advantage, turned on the circle toward the passage way and galloped by  me out of sight. Again Wallace, Frank and Jim let out strings of yells  and volleys. The chase was narrowing down. Trapped, the White Mustang  King had no chance. What a grand spirit he showed! Frenzied as I was  with excitement, the thought occurred to me that this was an unfair  battle, that I ought to stand aside and let him pass. But the blood and  lust of primitive instinct held me fast. Jones, keeping back, met his  every turn. Yet always with lithe and beautiful stride the stallion  kept out of reach of the whirling lariat.    \"Close in!\" yelled Jones, and his voice, powerful with a note of  triumph, bespoke the knell of the king's freedom.    The trap closed in. Back and forth at the upper end the White Mustang  worked; then rendered desperate by the closing in, he circled round  nearer to me. Fire shone in his wild eyes. The wily Jones was not to be  outwitted; he kept in the middle, always on the move, and he yelled to  me to open up.    I lost my voice again, and fired my last shot. Then the White Mustang  burst into a dash of daring, despairing speed. It was his last  magnificent effort. Straight for the wash at the upper end he pointed  his racy, spirited head, and his white legs stretched far apart,  twinkled and stretched again. Jones galloped to cut him off, and the  yells he emitted were demoniacal. It was a long, straight race for the  mustang, a short curve for the bay.    That the white stallion gained was as sure as his resolve to elude  capture, and he never swerved a foot from his course. Jones might have  headed him, but manifestly he wanted to ride with him, as well as to  meet him, so in case the lasso went true, a terrible shock might be  averted.    Up went Jones's arm as the space shortened, and the lasso ringed his  head. Out it shot, lengthened like a yellow, striking snake, and fell  just short of the flying white tail.    The White Mustang, fulfilling his purpose in a last heroic display of  power, sailed into the air, up and up, and over the wide wash like a  white streak. Free! the dust rolled in a cloud from under his hoofs,  and he vanished.    Jones's superb horse, crashing down on his haunches, just escaped  sliding into the hole.    I awoke to the realization that Satan had carried me, in pursuit of the  thrilling chase, all the way across the circle without my knowing it.    Jones calmly wiped the sweat from his face, calmly coiled his lasso,  and calmly remarked:    \"In trying to capture wild animals a man must never be too sure. Now  what I thought my strong point was my weak point--the wash. I made sure  no horse could ever jump that hole.\"        CHAPTER 8.    SNAKE GULCH    Not far from the scene of our adventure with the White Streak as we  facetious and appreciatively named the mustang, deep, flat cave  indented the canyon wall. By reason of its sandy floor and close  proximity to Frank's trickling spring, we decided to camp in it. About  dawn Lawson and Stewart straggled in on spent horse and found awaiting  them a bright fire, a hot supper and cheery comrades.    \"Did yu fellars git to see him?\" was the ranger's first question.    \"Did we get to see him?\" echoed five lusty voice as one. \"We did!\"    It was after Frank, in his plain, blunt speech had told of our  experience, that the long Arizonian gazed fixedly at Jones.    \"Did yu acktully tech the hair of thet mustang with a rope?\"    In all his days Jones never had a greater complement. By way of reply,  he moved his big hand to button of his coat, and, fumbling over it,  unwound a string of long, white hairs, then said: \"I pulled these out  of his tail with my lasso; it missed his left hind hoof about six  inches.\"    There were six of the hairs, pure, glistening white, and over three  feet long. Stewart examined then in expressive silence, then passed  them along; and when they reached me, they stayed.    The cave, lighted up by a blazing fire, appeared to me a forbidding,  uncanny place. Small, peculiar round holes, and dark cracks, suggestive  of hidden vermin, gave me a creepy feeling; and although not  over-sensitive on the subject of crawling, creeping things, I voiced my  disgust.    \"Say, I don't like the idea of sleeping in this hole. I'll bet it's  full of spiders, snakes and centipedes and other poisonous things.\"    Whatever there was in my inoffensive declaration to rouse the usually  slumbering humor of the Arizonians, and the thinly veiled ridicule of  Colonel Jones, and a mixture of both in my once loyal California  friend, I am not prepared to state. Maybe it was the dry, sweet, cool  air of Nail Canyon; maybe my suggestion awoke ticklish associations  that worked themselves off thus; maybe it was the first instance of my  committing myself to a breach of camp etiquette. Be that as it may, my  innocently expressed sentiment gave rise to bewildering dissertations  on entomology, and most remarkable and startling tales from first-hand  experience.    \"Like as not,\" began Frank in matter-of-fact tone. \"Them's tarantuler  holes all right. An' scorpions, centipedes an' rattlers always rustle  with tarantulers. But we never mind them--not us fellers! We're used to  sleepin' with them. Why, I often wake up in the night to see a big  tarantuler on my chest, an' see him wink. Ain't thet so, Jim?\"    \"Shore as hell,\" drawled faithful, slow Jim.    \"Reminds me how fatal the bite of a centipede is,\" took up Colonel  Jones, complacently. \"Once I was sitting in camp with a hunter, who  suddenly hissed out: 'Jones, for God's sake don't budge! There's a  centipede on your arm!' He pulled his Colt, and shot the blamed  centipede off as clean as a whistle. But the bullet hit a steer in the  leg; and would you believe it, the bullet carried so much poison that  in less than two hours the steer died of blood poisoning. Centipedes  are so poisonous they leave a blue trail on flesh just by crawling over  it. Look there!\"    He bared his arm, and there on the brown-corded flesh was a blue trail  of something, that was certain. It might have been made by a centipede.    \"This is a likely place for them,\" put in Wallace, emitting a volume of  smoke and gazing round the cave walls with the eye of a connoisseur.  \"My archaeological pursuits have given me great experience with  centipedes, as you may imagine, considering how many old tombs, caves  and cliff-dwellings I have explored. This Algonkian rock is about the  right stratum for centipedes to dig in. They dig somewhat after the  manner of the fluviatile long-tailed decapod crustaceans, of the genera  Thoracostraca, the common crawfish, you know. From that, of course, you  can imagine, if a centipede can bite rock, what a biter he is.\"    I began to grow weak, and did not wonder to see Jim's long pipe fall  from his lips. Frank looked queer around the gills, so to speak, but  the gaunt Stewart never batted an eye.    \"I camped here two years ago,\" he said, \"An' the cave was alive with  rock-rats, mice, snakes, horned-toads, lizards an' a big Gila monster,  besides bugs, scorpions' rattlers, an' as fer tarantulers an'  centipedes--say! I couldn't sleep fer the noise they made fightin'.\"    \"I seen the same,\" concluded Lawson, as nonchalant as a wild-horse  wrangler well could be. \"An' as fer me, now I allus lays perfickly  still when the centipedes an' tarantulers begin to drop from their  holes in the roof, same as them holes up there. An' when they light on  me, I never move, nor even breathe fer about five minutes. Then they  take a notion I'm dead an' crawl off. But sure, if I'd breathed I'd  been a goner!\"    All of this was playfully intended for the extinction of an unoffending  and impressionable tenderfoot.    With an admiring glance at my tormentors, I rolled out my sleeping-bag  and crawled into it, vowing I would remain there even if devil-fish,  armed with pikes, invaded our cave.    Late in the night I awoke. The bottom of the canyon and the outer floor  of our cave lay bathed in white, clear moonlight. A dense, gloomy black  shadow veiled the opposite canyon wall. High up the pinnacles and  turrets pointed toward a resplendent moon. It was a weird, wonderful  scene of beauty entrancing, of breathless, dreaming silence that seemed  not of life. Then a hoot-owl lamented dismally, his call fitting the  scene and the dead stillness; the echoes resounded from cliff to cliff,  strangely mocking and hollow, at last reverberating low and mournful in  the distance.    How long I lay there enraptured with the beauty of light and mystery of  shade, thrilling at the lonesome lament of the owl, I have no means to  tell; but I was awakened from my trance by the touch of something  crawling over me. Promptly I raised"]]]
