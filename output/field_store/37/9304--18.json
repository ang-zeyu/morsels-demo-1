Nam ut commutato consilio iter in provinciam  converteret, id ne metu quidem necessario faciendum existimabat; cum  infamia atque indignitas rei et oppositus mons Cevenna viarumque  difficultas impediebat, tum maxime quod abiuncto Labieno atque eis  legionibus quas una miserat vehementer timebat. Itaque admodum magnis  diurnis nocturnisque itineribus confectis contra omnium opinionem ad  Ligerem venit vadoque per equites invento pro rei necessitate opportuno,  ut brachia modo atque humeri ad sustinenda arma liberi ab aqua esse  possent, disposito equitatu qui vim fluminis refringeret, atque hostibus  primo aspectu perturbatis, incolumem exercitum traduxit frumentumque in  agris et pecoris copiam nactus repleto his rebus exercitu iter in  Senones facere instituit.      57    Dum haec apud Caesarem geruntur, Labienus eo supplemento, quod nuper ex  Italia venerat, relicto Agedinci, ut esset impedimentis praesidio, cum  quattuor legionibus Lutetiam proficiscitur. Id est oppidum Parisiorum,  quod positum est in insula fluminis Sequanae. Cuius adventu ab hostibus  cognito magnae ex finitimis civitatibus copiae convenerunt. Summa imperi  traditur Camulogeno Aulerco, qui prope confectus aetate tamen propter  singularem scientiam rei militaris ad eum est honorem evocatus. Is cum  animadvertisset perpetuam esse paludem, quae influeret in Sequanam atque  illum omnem locum magnopere impediret, hic consedit nostrosque transitu  prohibere instituit.      58    Labienus primo vineas agere, cratibus atque aggere paludem explere atque  iter munire conabatur. Postquam id difficilius confieri animadvertit,  silentio e castris tertia vigilia egressus eodem quo venerat itinere  Metiosedum pervenit. Id est oppidum Senonum in insula Sequanae positum,  ut paulo ante de Lutetia diximus. Deprensis navibus circiter  quinquaginta celeriterque coniunctis atque eo militibus iniectis et rei  novitate perterritis oppidanis, quorum magna pars erat ad bellum  evocata, sine contentione oppido potitur. Refecto ponte, quem  superioribus diebus hostes resciderant, exercitum traducit et secundo  flumine ad Lutetiam iter facere coepit. Hostes re cogmta ab eis, qui  Metiosedo fugerant, Lutetiam incendi pontesque eius oppidi rescindi  iubent; ipsi profecti a palude ad ripas Sequanae e regione Lutetiae  contra Labieni castra considunt.      59    Iam Caesar a Gergovia discessisse audiebatur, iam de Aeduorum defectione  et secundo Galliae motu rumores adferebantur, Gallique in colloquiis  interclusum itinere et Ligeri Caesarem inopia frumenti coactum in  provinciam contendisse confirmabant. Bellovaci autem defectione Aeduorum  cognita, qui ante erant per se infideles, manus cogere atque aperte  bellum parare coeperunt. Tum Labienus tanta rerum commutatione longe  aliud sibi capiendum consilium adque antea senserat intellegebat, neque  iam, ut aliquid adquireret proelioque hostes lacesseret, sed ut  incolumem exercitum Agedincum reduceret, cogitabat. Namque altera ex  parte Bellovaci, quae civitas in Gallia maximam habet opinionem  virtutis, instabant, alteram Camulogenus parato atque instructo exercitu  tenebat; tum legiones a praesidio atque impedimentis interclusas maximum  flumen distinebat. Tantis subito difficultatibus obiectis ab animi  virtute auxilium petendum videbat.      60    Sub vesperum consilio convocato cohortatus ut ea quae imperasset  diligenter industrieque administrarent, naves, quas Metiosedo deduxerat,  singulas equitibus Romanis attribuit, et prima confecta vigilia quattuor  milia passuum secundo flumine silentio progredi ibique se exspectari  iubet. Quinque cohortes, quas minime firmas ad dimicandum esse  existimabat, castris praesidio relinquit; quinque eiusdem legionis  reliquas de media nocte cum omnibus impedimentis adverso flumine magno  tumultu proficisci imperat. Conquirit etiam lintres: has magno sonitu  remorum incitatus in eandem partem mittit. Ipse post paulo silentio  egressus cum tribus legionibus eum locum petit quo naves appelli  iusserat.      61    Eo cum esset ventum, exploratores hostium, ut omni fluminis parte erant  dispositi, inopinantes, quod magna subito erat coorta tempestas, ab  nostris opprimumtur; exercitus equitatusque equitibus Romanis  administrantibus, quos ei negotio praefecerat, celeriter transmittitur.  Vno fere tempore sub lucem hostibus nuntiatur in castris Romanorum  praeter consuetudinem tumultuari et magnum ire agmen adverso flumine  sonitumque remorum in eadem parte exaudiri et paulo infra milites  navibus transportari. Quibus rebus auditis, quod existimabant tribus  locis transire legiones atque omnes perturbatos defectione Aeduorum  fugam parare, suas quoque copias in tres partes distribuerunt. Nam  praesidio e regione castrorum relicto et parva manu Metiosedum versus  missa, quae tantum progrediatur, quantum naves processissent, reliquas  copias contra Labienum duxerunt.      62    Prima luce et nostri omnes erant transportati, et hostium acies  cernebatur. Labienus milites cohortatus ut suae pristinae virtutis et  secundissimorum proeliorum retinerent memoriam atque ipsum Caesarem,  cuius ductu saepe numero hostes superassent, praesentem adesse  existimarent, dat signum proeli. Primo concursu ab dextro cornu, ubi  septima legio constiterat, hostes pelluntur atque in fugam coniciuntur;  ab sinistro, quem locum duodecima legio tenebat, cum primi ordines  hostium transfixi telis concidissent, tamen acerrime reliqui  resistebant, nec dabat suspicionem fugae quisquam. Ipse dux hostium  Camulogenus suis aderat atque eos cohortabatur. Incerto nunc etiam exitu  victoriae, cum septimae legionis tribunis esset nuntiatum quae in  sinistro cornu gererentur, post tergum hostium legionem ostenderunt  signaque intulerunt. Ne eo quidem tempore quisquam loco cessit, sed  circumventi omnes interfectique sunt. Eandem fortunam tulit Camulogenus.  At ei qui praesidio contra castra Labieni erant relicti, cum proelium  commissum audissent, subsidio suis ierunt collemque ceperunt, neque  nostrorum militum victorum impetum sustinere potuerunt. Sic cum suis  fugientibus permixti, quos non silvae montesque texerunt, ab equitatu  sunt interfecti. Hoc negotio confecto Labienus revertitur Agedincum, ubi  impedimenta totius exercitus relicta erant: inde cum omnibus copiis ad  Caesarem pervenit.      63    Defectione Aeduorum cognita bellum augetur. Legationes in omnes partes  circummittuntur: quantum gratia, auctoritate, pecunia valent, ad  sollicitandas civitates nituntur; nacti obsides, quos Caesar apud eos  deposuerat, horum supplicio dubitantes territant. Petunt a  Vercingetorige Aedui ut ad se veniat rationesque belli gerendi  communicet. Re impetrata contendunt ut ipsis summa imperi tradatur, et  re in controversiam deducta totius Galliae concilium Bibracte indicitur.  Eodem conveniunt undique frequentes. Multitudinis suffragiis res  permittitur: ad unum omnes Vercingetorigem probant imperatorem. Ab hoc  concilio Remi, Lingones, Treveri afuerunt: illi, quod amicitiam  Romanorum sequebantur; Treveri, quod aberant longius et ab Germanis  premebantur, quae fuit causa quare toto abessent bello et neutris  auxilia mitterent. Magno dolore Aedui ferunt se deiectos principatu,  queruntur fortunae commutationem et Caesaris indulgentiam in se  requirunt, neque tamen suscepto bello suum consilium ab reliquis  separare audent. Inviti summae spei adulescentes Eporedorix et  Viridomarus Vercingetorigi parent.      64    Ipse imperat reliquis civitatibus obsides diemque ei rei constituit.  Omnes equites, quindecim milia numero, celeriter convenire iubet;  peditatu quem antea habuerit se fore contentum dicit, neque fortunam  temptaturum aut in acie dimicaturum, sed, quoniam abundet equitatu,  perfacile esse factu frumentationibus pabulationibusque Romanos  prohibere, aequo modo animo sua ipsi frumenta corrumpant aedificiaque  incendant, qua rei familiaris iactura perpetuum imperium libertatemque  se consequi videant. His constitutis rebus Aeduis Segusiavisque, qui  sunt finitimi provinciae, decem milia peditum imperat; huc addit equites  octingentos. His praeficit fratrem Eporedorigis bellumque inferri  Allobrogibus iubet. Altera ex parte Gabalos proximosque pagos Arvernorum  in Helvios, item Rutenos Cadurcosque ad fines Volcarum Arecomicorum  depopulandos mittit. Nihilo minus clandestinis nuntiis legationibusque  Allobrogas sollicitat, quorum mentes nondum ab superiore bello resedisse  sperabat. Horum principibus pecunias, civitati autem imperium totius  provinciae pollicetur.      65    Ad hos omnes casus provisa erant praesidia cohortium duarum et viginti,  quae ex ipsa provincia ab Lucio Caesare legato ad omnes partes  opponebantur. Helvii sua sponte cum finitimis proelio congressi  pelluntur et Gaio Valerio Donnotauro, Caburi filio, principe civitatis,  compluribusque aliis interfectis intra oppida ac muros compelluntur.  Allobroges crebris ad Rhodanum dispositis praesidiis magna cum cura et  diligentia suos fines tuentur. Caesar, quod hostes equitatu superiores  esse intellegebat et interclusis omnibus itineribus nulla re ex  provincia atque Italia sublevari poterat, trans Rhenum in Germaniam  mittit ad eas civitates quas superioribus annis pacaverat, equitesque ab  his arcessit et levis armaturae pedites, qui inter eos proeliari  consuerant. Eorum adventu, quod minus idoneis equis utebantur, a  tribunis militum reliquisque equitibus Romanis atque evocatis equos  sumit Germanisque distribuit.      66    Interea, dum haec geruntur, hostium copiae ex Arvernis equitesque qui  toti Galliae erant imperati conveniunt. Magno horum coacto numero, cum  Caesar in Sequanos per extremos Lingonum fines iter faceret, quo  facilius subsidium provinciae ferri posset, circiter milia passuum decem  ab Romanis trinis castris Vercingetorix consedit convocatisque ad  concilium praefectis equitum venisse tempus victoriae"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/18843"],[0,"Applied Psychology for Nurses (#16)"],[1,"-and now he cannot. If the pessimistic,  morbid one had looked away from the shadow to the sun it hid he, too, in  the end might have seen with sane eyes and lived so wholesomely as to  find all the good there was in life. Willed attention, rather than  spineless feeling distractibility, might have saved him.    When thinking can be forced to follow where trained reason directs, and  can be kept in that direction, the greatest problem of physical and  nervous well being is solved. To the nurse there is no other principle  of psychology so important. But no child ever had his attention  diverted by reasoning alone. The object at which you wish him to look  must be made more impelling than the one he already sees, or he must  want much to please you, else he only with his eyes will follow your  command while his mind returns to his real interest; and the second you  cease to command that eye service, he looks back to the thing that was  holding him before. The beginning of all education is in arousing a  _want to know_; in turning desire in the direction of knowledge.    I am an undisciplined child and I want only candy for my lunch. It is  not good for me. Milk is what I should have. I don't want it. You may  deprive me of the candy and force me to drink the milk, and I can do  nothing but submit. But I rebel within, and I am only more convinced  that I \"hate\" it and want candy, and that you are my natural enemy  because you force the one upon me and deprive me of the other. If I were  insane and so, of course, could not be reasoned with, this might be  inevitable. But it would be unfortunate. In that case, if possible, do  not let me see the candy; let only the food it is best for me to have be  put before me, and perhaps eventually I shall come to want the more  wholesome thing--for it is better than the hunger.    But as it happens I am a perfectly normal person, only I am sick. I am  tired of bed, and want to sit up--and it does seem that I should have my  desire. The nurse, wise in her knowledge of sick \"grown-ups,\" who are,  after all, very like children, will find a way to divert my mind from  the immediate \"I want\" to something which I also can be led to want. I  may agree that I want more the better feeling an hour from now. Perhaps  her humorous picture of the effects of too early freedom on my  condition, or of my body's urgent demand for rest, regardless of my  mind's wish; perhaps only a joke which diverts me; perchance the  \"take-for-granted you want to help us out\" air; mayhap the story to be  read or told; or simply the poise and quiet assurance of the nurse who  never questions my reasonableness and acquiescence; perhaps her  confidence that this will serve as a means to the end I covet--will  result in my gladly taking her advice, and my perfect willingness to  wait for new orders, while I indulge in beautiful plans I shall carry  out when they finally arrive.    In other words, with the sick as with children, attention naturally  follows interest. And the good nurse realizes that it is not wise to  force co-operation when she can secure it by diverting her patient's  thoughts to another interest than the one now holding him. Very often,  merely by chatting quietly about something she has learned has an  appeal, she can make the patient forget his weariness and boredom, or  his resistance to details of treatment. The very milk he is refusing to  drink may be down before he realizes it. But right here lies a hidden  reef which may cause wreckage in the future. It is good therapy to  divert attention by appealing to another interest when the patient is  too sick or too stubborn or not clear enough mentally to be reasoned  with. But if this becomes a principle, and his reason and active  co-operation are never secured to make him choose the way of health for  himself, the hour he is out of the nurse's hands he reverts to the  things that now happen to appeal to him. Then unless some wise friend is  near to continue her method of making the reasonable interesting, the  advice of reason can \"go to smash.\"    There has been a very constant illustration throughout the past of the  unwisdom of relying upon diverted attention alone as an effective  therapeutic agent. We hope this will not illustrate our point so clearly  in the future. The drunkard, who is just recovering from a big spree,  and feels sick and disgusted with himself, and sore and ashamed, is  appealed to in glowing terms of the wellness and strength and buoyancy  of the man who never drinks. He has no \"mornings after.\" The Lord is  just waiting to save this dejected victim of alcohol from his hateful  enemy who has made him what he is at this hour, and will forgive all his  sottishness, his sins. He will be respected; he can command the love of  his family again. He will no longer be a slave, but a free man. Right  now, respect of the world and love of family and friends, and cleanness,  and the forgiveness of a good God are infinitely more interesting than  this splitting headache, this horrible sick feeling. And attention may  be very readily diverted. This promised new life is more attractive than  the present. It is easy to keep attention there. And he reforms. He  swears off \"for keeps.\" He is a happy man, a free man. For a few days or  weeks, perhaps even longer, he glories in his new self-respect. It is a  strange and enticing sensation. Then one day something goes wrong. He  loses some money, or he is awfully tired, or the wife and children bore  him, and all of a sudden the one greatest interest in the world is a  drink. And because his thinking can always be led by his feeling;  because he has never learned to force it to go elsewhere, he has his  drink. Appealing to his emotions did not and cannot save him unless that  appeal is followed at the right moment by awakened reason, which will  look at the whole proposition when the mind is at its normal best, and  choose to follow where rational feeling directs. Nor will reason save  unless volition comes to its support and strongly backs it up and  enforces what it advises.      THE ATTENTION OF REASON AND WILL    So the good nurse will not consider her work done when she has diverted  mental processes into channels of co-operation. When the patient, who is  capable of reasoning, knows the why of his treatment, and realizes that  he can only keep well as he himself takes over the job and puts his mind  on things outside of his feelings, and carries out the doctor's  instructions for the sake of securing a certain end--then he has been  under a good nurse. This wise helper never \"preaches,\" but makes the  healthy goal very desirable, stirs up an ambition to attain it, and  prods the will to keep on after it despite anything feeling may say.    This attitude on the part of the nurse presupposes that her own  attention, while with her patient, is upon him and upon securing his  health, and not upon her tiredness, or boredom, or headache, or the  party tonight, or the man who has asked her to go to the theater with  him tomorrow. She, surely, must learn to direct her thoughts where  reason suggests, and to gain new interests through willed attention, or  as a nurse she is less than second rate. Nor can she get the best  results until she can turn with a single mind to the patient at hand as  the immediate problem to be solved. And probably neither nurse nor  doctor does any better service, except in saving life itself, than in  keeping the patient from thinking constantly of himself and his ills.  For it seems of little use to have made some people physically well, if  they are to carry through prolonged years the curse of constant  self-attention, self-centeredness, an ingrowing ego.    There are a few simple laws of the mind hinging upon attention which are  today being impressed upon teachers in every department, in  kindergarten, public school, college, and university. And they are as  necessary to the nurse as to the teacher. Three of them we have already  discussed:    1. Attention naturally follows interest.    2. Attention may be held by will where reason directs.    3. New interests grow out of willed attention.    A fourth we shall stress before considering the use the nurse can make  of them:    4. The thing to which our chief attention is given becomes the most  important thing.    Do not contradict this too quickly. Don't say that nursing gets your  chief consideration because it is, of necessity, your profession; but  that you love your music infinitely more, and look forward to that  through all your hours on duty. If this merely proves that music is  distracting your attention, you are doing your nursing as a means, and  not as an end; you give it probably all the attention necessary for good  work, but your real desire is music. Your chief attention is directed  toward that goal. Hence music is to you the most important thing. If  your will is sufficiently trained to keep you from consciously thinking  of it, still you are dreaming of it and working for it. You may make a  very good nurse, but you will never be as excellent a one as the woman  from whom nursing demands first and chief attention.    We sometimes speak of one woman as a born nurse, and say of another,  \"She's a good nurse, thoroughly conscientious, but not a natural one  like Miss X.\" It only means that Miss X's main purpose in life has  always been caring for the sick, while Miss Y's secondary concern is  that. There is a third, however, who may be sidetracked into nursing,  but whose chiefest interest and attention in life has not been so much a  certain profession or accomplishment, but a passion for people, with an  ability to enter into their lives understandingly. She may not care for  nursing in itself. It is only accidental that her thoughts were turned  to it. But her liking for people makes it easier for her to concentrate  attention on the details of nursing, as thereby she is fulfilling"]]]
