[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/17594"],[0,"Lectures on Language, as Particularly Connected with English Grammar. (#16)"],[1,"    It may not be improper here to notice the adjectives derived from  pronouns, which retain so much of their character as relates to the  persons who employ them. These are _my_, _thy_, _his_, _her_, _its_,  _our_, _your_, _their_, _whose_. This is _my_ book, that is _your_ pen,  this is _his_ knife, and that is _her_ letter. Some of these, like other  words, vary their ending when standing alone; as, two apples are  your_s_, three her_s_, six their_s_, five our_s_, and the rest mine.  _His_ does not alter in popular use. Hence the reason why you hear it so  often, in common conversation, when standing without the noun expressed,  pronounced as if written _hisen_. The word _other_, and some others,  come under the same remark. When the nouns specified are expressed, they  take the regular termination; as, give me these Baldwin apples, and a  few others--a few other apples.           *       *       *       *       *    There is a class of small words which from the frequency of their use  have, like pronouns, lost their primitive character, and are now  preserved only as adjectives. Let us examine a few of them by  endeavoring to ferret out their true meaning and application in the  expression of ideas. We will begin with the old articles, _a_, _an_, and  _the_, by testing the truth and propriety of the duty commonly assigned  to them in our grammars.    The standard grammar asserts that \"an article is a word prefixed to  substantives, to point them out, and to show how far their signification  extends; as, \"a garden, an eagle, the woman.\" Skepticism in grammar is  no crime, so we will not hesitate to call in question the correctness of  this \"best of all grammars beyond all comparison.\" Let us consider the  very examples given. They were doubtless the best that could be found.  Does _a_ \"point out\" the garden, or \"show how far its signification  extends?\" It does neither of these things. It may name \"_any_\" garden,  and it certainly does not define whether it is a _great_ or a _small_  one. It simply determines that _one_ garden is the subject of remark.  All else is to be determined by the word _garden_.    We are told there are two articles, the one _in_definite, the other  definite--_a_ is the former, and _the_ the latter. I shall leave it with  you to reconcile the apparent contradiction of an _indefinite_ article  which \"is used in a _vague sense, to point out the signification_ of  another word.\" But I challenge teachers to make their pupils comprehend  such a jargon, if they can do it themselves. But it is as good sense as  we find in many of the popular grammars of the day.    Again, Murray says \"_a_ becomes _an_ before a vowel or silent _h_;\" and  so say all his _simplifying_ satellites after him. Is such the fact? Is  he right? He is, I most unqualifiedly admit, with this little  correction, the addition of a single word--he is right _wrong_! Instead  of _a_ becoming _an_, the reverse is the fact. The word is derived  directly from the same word which still stands as our first numeral. It  was a short time since written _ane_, as any one may see by consulting  all old books. By and by it dropped the _e_, and afterwards, for the  sake of euphony, in certain cases, the _n_, so that now it stands a  single letter. You all have lived long enough to have noticed the  changes in the word. Formerly we said _an_ union, _an_ holiday, _an_  universalist, _an_ unitarian, &c., expressions which are now rarely  heard. We now say _a_ union, &c. This single instance proves that  arbitrary rules of grammar have little to do in the regulation of  language. Its barriers are of sand, soon removed. It will not be said  that this is an unimportant mistake, for, if an error, it is pernicious,  and if a grammarian knows enough to say that _a_ becomes _an_, he ought  to know that he tells a falsehood, and that _an_ becomes _a_ under  certain circumstances. Mr. Murray gives the following example to  illustrate the use of _a_. \"Give me _a_ book; that is, _any_ book.\" How  can the learner understand such a rule? How will it apply? Let us try  it. \"A man has _a_ wife;\" that is, _any_ man has _any_ wife. I have a  hat; that is, _any_ hat. A farmer has a farm--_any_ farmer has _any_  farm. A merchant in Boston has a beautiful piece of broadcloth--_any_  merchant in Boston has any beautiful piece of broadcloth. A certain king  of Europe decreed a protestant to be burned--_any_ king of Europe  decreed _any_ protestant to be burned. How ridiculous are the rules we  have learned and taught to others, to enable them to \"speak and write  with propriety.\" No wonder we never understood grammar, if so at  variance with truth and every day's experience. The rules of grammar as  usually taught can never be observed in practice. Hence it is called a  _dry study_. In every thing else we learn something that we can  understand, which will answer some good purpose in the affairs of life.  But this branch of science is among the things which have been tediously  learned to no purpose. No good account can be given of its advantages.    _The_, we are told, \"is called the definite article, because it  ascertains what _particular_ thing or things are meant.\" A most  unfortunate definition, and quite as erroneous as the former. Let us try  it. _The_ stars shine, _the_ lion roars, _the_ camel is a beast of  burden, _the_ deer is good for food, _the_ wind blows, _the_ clouds  appear, _the_ Indians are abused. What is there in these examples, which  \"ascertain what _particular_ thing or things are meant?\" They are  expressions as _in_definite as we can imagine.    On the other hand, should I say _a_ star shines, _a_ lion roars, _an_  Indian is abused, _a_ wind blows, _a_ cloud appears, you would  understand me to allude very _definitely_ to _one_ \"particular\" object,  as separate and distinguished from others of its kind.    But what is the wonderful peculiarity in the meaning and use of these  two little words that makes them so unlike every thing else, as to  demand a separate \"part of speech?\" You may be surprised when I tell you  that there are other words in our language derived from the same source  and possessed of the same meaning; but such is the fact, as will soon  appear. Let us ask for the etymology of these important words. _A_  signifies _one_, never more, never less. In this respect it is always  _definite_. It is sometimes applied to a single thing, sometimes to a  whole class of things, to a [one] man, or to a [one] hundred men. It may  be traced thro other languages, ancient and modern, with little  modification in spelling; Greek _eis_, ein; Latin _unus_; Armoric  _unan_; Spanish and Italian _uno_; Portuguese _hum_; French _un_; German  _ein_; Danish _een_, _en_; Dutch _een_; Swedish _en_; Saxon, _an_,  _aen_, _one_--from which ours is directly derived--old English _ane_;  and more modernly _one_, _an_, _a_. In all languages it defines a thing  to be _one_, a united or congregated whole, and the word _one_ may  always be substituted without affecting the sense. From it is derived  our word _once_, which signifies _oned_, _united_, _joined_, as we shall  see when we come to speak of \"contractions.\" In some languages _a_ is  styled an article, in others it is not. The Latin, for instance, has no  article, and the Greek has no _indefinite_. But all languages have words  which are like ours, pure adjectives, employed to specify certain  things. The argument drawn from the fact that some other languages have  _articles_, and therefore ours should, is fallacious. The Latin, which  was surpassed for beauty of style or power in deliverance by few, if any  others, never suffered from the lack of articles. Nor is there any  reason why we should honor two small adjectives with that high rank to  the exclusion of others quite as worthy.    _The_ is always used as a definitive word, tho it is the least definite  of the defining adjectives. In fact when we desire to \"_ascertain  particularly_ what thing is meant,\" we select some more definite word.  \"Give me _the_ books.\" Which? \"Those with red covers, that in calf, and  this in Russia binding.\" _The_ nations are at peace. What nations?  _Those_ which were at war. You perceive how we employ words which are  more definite, that is, better understood, to \"_point out_\" the object  of conversation, especially when there is any doubt in the case. What  occasion, then, is there to give these [the?] words a separate \"part of  speech,\" since in character they do not differ from others in the  language?    We will notice another frivolous distinction made by Mr. Murray, merely  to show how learned men may be mistaken, and the folly of trusting to  special rules in the general application of words. He says, \"Thou art  _a_ man,\" is a very general and _harmless_ expression; but, thou art  _the_ man, (as Nathan said to David,) is an assertion capable of  striking terror and remorse into the heart.\" The distinction in meaning  here, on which he insists, attaches to the articles _a_ and _the_. It is  a sufficient refutation of this definition to make a counter statement.  Suppose we say, \"Murray is _the_ best grammarian in the world; or, he is  _a_ fool, _a_ knave, and _a_ liar.\" Which, think you, would be  considered the most _harmless_ expression? Suppose it had been said to  Aaron Burr, thou art _a_ traitor, or to General William Hull, thou art  _a_ coward, would they regard the phrase as \"_harmless!_\" On the other  hand, suppose a beautiful, accomplished, and talented young lady, should  observe to one of her suitors, \"I have received offers of marriage from  several gentlemen besides yourself, but thou art =the= man of my  choice;\" would it, think you, _strike_ terror and remorse into his  heart? I should pity the young student of Murray whose feelings had  become so stoical from the false teaching of his author as to be filled  with \"terror and remorse\" under such favorable circumstances, while fair"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/17607"],[0,"Superstition In All Ages (1732) (#16)"],[1,"acted upon with  difficulty, whose brain is hard to move, whose blood circulates slowly;  a man of mind is he whose organs are supple, who feels very quickly,  whose brain moves promptly; a learned man is one whose organs and whose  brain have been exercised a long while upon objects which occupy him.    The man without culture, experience, or reason, is he not more  despicable and more abominable than the vilest insects, or the most  ferocious beasts? Is there a more detestable being in nature than a  Tiberius, a Nero, a Caligula? These destroyers of the human race, known  by the name of conquerors, have they better souls than those of bears,  lions, and panthers? Are there more detestable animals in this world  than tyrants?          XCVII.--REFUTATION OF MAN'S EXCELLENCE.    Human extravagances soon dispel, in the eyes of reason, the superiority  which man arrogantly claims over other animals. Do we not see many  animals show more gentleness, more reflection and reason than the animal  which calls itself reasonable par excellence? Are there amongst men, who  are so often enslaved and oppressed, societies as well organized as  those of ants, bees, or beavers? Do we ever see ferocious beasts of the  same kind meet upon the plains to devour each other without profit? Do  we see among them religious wars? The cruelty of beasts against other  species is caused by hunger, the need of nourishment; the cruelty of man  against man has no other motive than the vanity of his masters and the  folly of his impertinent prejudices. Theorists who try to make us  believe that everything in the universe was made for man, are very much  embarrassed when we ask them in what way can so many mischievous animals  which continually infest our life here, contribute to the welfare of  men. What known advantage results for God's friend to be bitten by a  viper, stung by a gnat, devoured by vermin, torn into pieces by a tiger?  Would not all these animals reason as wisely as our theologians, if they  should pretend that man was made for them?          XCVIII.--AN ORIENTAL LEGEND.    At a short distance from Bagdad a dervis, celebrated for his holiness,  passed his days tranquilly in agreeable solitude. The surrounding  inhabitants, in order to have an interest in his prayers, eagerly  brought to him every day provisions and presents. The holy man thanked  God incessantly for the blessings Providence heaped upon him. \"O Allah,\"  said he, \"how ineffable is Thy tenderness toward Thy servants. What have  I done to deserve the benefactions which Thy liberality loads me with!  Oh, Monarch of the skies! oh, Father of nature! what praises could be  worthy to celebrate Thy munificence and Thy paternal cares! O Allah, how  great are Thy gifts to the children of men!\" Filled with gratitude, our  hermit made a vow to undertake for the seventh time the pilgrimage to  Mecca. The war, which then existed between the Persians and the Turks,  could not make him defer the execution of his pious enterprise. Full of  confidence in God, he began his journey; under the inviolable safeguard  of a respected garb, he passed through without obstacle the enemies'  detachments; far from being molested, he receives at every step marks of  veneration from the soldiers of both sides. At last, overcome by  fatigue, he finds himself obliged to seek a shelter from the rays of the  burning sun; he finds it beneath a fresh group of palm-trees, whose  roots were watered by a limpid rivulet. In this solitary place, where  the silence was broken only by the murmuring of the waters and the  singing of the birds, the man of God found not only an enchanting  retreat, but also a delicious repast; he had but to extend the hand to  gather dates and other agreeable fruits; the rivulet can appease his  thirst; very soon a green plot invites him to take sweet repose. As he  awakens he performs the holy cleansing; and in a transport of ecstasy,  he exclaimed: \"O Allah! HOW GREAT IS THY GOODNESS TO THE CHILDREN OF  MEN!\" Well rested, refreshed, full of life and gayety, our holy man  continues on his road; it conducts him for some time through a  delightful country, which offers to his sight but blooming shores and  trees filled with fruit. Softened by this spectacle, he worships  incessantly the rich and liberal hand of Providence, which is everywhere  seen occupied with the welfare of the human race. Going a little  farther, he comes across a few mountains, which were quite hard to  ascend; but having arrived at their summit, a hideous sight suddenly  meets his eyes; his soul is all consternation. He discovers a vast plain  entirely devastated by the sword and fire; he looks at it and finds it  covered with more than a hundred thousand corpses, deplorable remains of  a bloody battle which had taken place a few days previous. Eagles,  vultures, ravens, and wolves were devouring the dead bodies with which  the earth was covered. This sight plunges our pilgrim into a sad  reverie. Heaven, by a special favor, had made him understand the  language of beasts. He heard a wolf, gorged with human flesh, exclaim in  his excessive joy: \"O Allah! how great is Thy kindness for the children  of wolves! Thy foreseeing wisdom takes care to send infatuation upon  these detestable men who are so dangerous to us. Through an effect of  Thy Providence which watches over Thy creatures, these, our destroyers,  murder each other, and thus furnish us with sumptuous repasts. O Allah!  HOW GREAT IS THY GOODNESS TO THE CHILDREN OF WOLVES!\"          XCIX.--IT IS FOOLISH TO SEE IN THE UNIVERSE ONLY THE BENEFACTIONS OF  HEAVEN, AND TO BELIEVE THAT THIS UNIVERSE WAS MADE BUT FOR MAN.    An exalted imagination sees in the universe but the benefactions of  Heaven; a calm mind finds good and evil in it. I exist, you will say;  but is this existence always a benefit? You will say, look at this sun,  which shines for you; this earth, which is covered with fruits and  verdure; these flowers, which bloom for our sight and smell; these  trees, which bend beneath the weight of fruits; these pure streams,  which flow but to quench your thirst; these seas, which embrace the  universe to facilitate your commerce; these animals, which a foreseeing  nature produces for your use! Yes, I see all these things, and I enjoy  them when I can. But in some climates this beautiful sun is most always  obscured from me; in others, its excessive heat torments me, produces  storm, gives rise to dreadful diseases, dries up the fields; the meadows  have no grass, the trees are fruitless, the harvests are scorched, the  springs are dried up; I can scarcely exist, and I sigh under the cruelty  of a nature which you find so benevolent. If these seas bring me spices,  riches, and useless things, do they not destroy a multitude of mortals  who are dupes enough to go after them?    Man's vanity persuades him that he is the sole center of the universe;  he creates for himself a world and a God; he thinks himself of  sufficient consequence to derange nature at his will, but he reasons as  an atheist when the question of other animals is involved. Does he not  imagine that the individuals different from his species are automatons  unworthy of the cares of universal Providence, and that the beasts can  not be the objects of its justice and kindness? Mortals consider  fortunate or unfortunate events, health or sickness, life and death,  abundance or famine, as rewards or punishments for the use or misuse of  the liberty which they arrogate to themselves. Do they reason on this  principle when animals are taken into consideration? No; although they  see them under a just God enjoy and suffer, be healthy and sick, live  and die, like themselves, it does not enter their mind to ask what  crimes these beasts have committed in order to cause the displeasure of  the Arbiter of nature. Philosophers, blinded by their theological  prejudices, in order to disembarrass themselves, have gone so far as to  pretend that beasts have no feelings!    Will men never renounce their foolish pretensions? Will they not  recognize that nature was not made for them? Will they not see that this  nature has placed on equal footing all the beings which she produced?  Will they not see that all organized beings are equally made to be born  and to die, to enjoy and to suffer? Finally, instead of priding  themselves preposterously on their mental faculties, are they not  compelled to admit that they often render them more unhappy than the  beasts, in which we find neither opinions, prejudices, vanities, nor the  weaknesses which decide at every moment the well-being of men?          C.--WHAT IS THE SOUL? WE KNOW NOTHING ABOUT IT. IF THIS PRETENDED SOUL  WAS OF ANOTHER ESSENCE FROM THAT OF THE BODY, THEIR UNION WOULD BE  IMPOSSIBLE.    The superiority which men arrogate to themselves over other animals, is  principally founded upon the opinion of possessing exclusively an  immortal soul. But as soon as we ask what this soul is, they begin to  stammer. It is an unknown substance; it is a secret force distinguished  from their bodies; it is a spirit of which they can form no idea. Ask  them how this spirit, which they suppose like their God, totally  deprived of a physical substance, could combine itself with their  material bodies? They will tell you that they know nothing about it;  that it is a mystery to them; that this combination is the effect of the  Almighty power. These are the clear ideas which men form of the hidden,  or, rather, imaginary substance which they consider the motor of all  their actions! If the soul is a substance essentially different from the  body, and which can have no affinity with it, their union would be, not  a mystery, but a thing impossible. Besides, this soul, being of an  essence different from that of the body, ought to act necessarily in a  different way from it. However, we see that the movements of the body  are felt by this pretended soul,"]]]
