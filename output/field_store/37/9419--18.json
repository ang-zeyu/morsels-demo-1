Far, far in the darkest part of the deep wood she  found Mr. Owl.  When she saw how very thin and how very, very miserable  he was her heart was moved to pity, for old Mother Nature loves all her  subjects, even the worst of them.  All the fierceness was gone from Mr.  Owl.  He was so weak that he just sat huddled in the thickest part of  the great pine.  You see he had been able to catch very little to eat.    \"'Mr. Owl,' said old Mother Nature gently, 'you now know something of  the misery and the suffering which you have caused others, and I think  you have been punished enough.  No more may you fly abroad over the  Green Meadows while the day is bright, for still is the fear of you in  the hearts of all my little meadow people, but hereafter you shall not  find it so difficult to get enough to eat.  Your eyes shall grow big,  bigger than the eyes of any other bird, so that you shall be able to  see in the dusk and even in the dark.  Your ears shall grow large,  larger than the ears of any of the little forest or meadow people, so  that you can hear the very least sound.  Your feathers shall become as  soft as down, so that when you fly none shall hear you.'    \"And from that day it was even so.  Mr. Owl's eyes grew big and bigger  until he could see as well in the dusk as he used to see in the full  light of day.  His ears grew large and larger until his hearing became  so keen that he could hear the least rustle, even at a long distance.  And when he flew he made no sound, but floated like a great shadow.    \"The little meadow people no longer feared him by day, but when the  shadows began to creep out from the Purple Hills each night and they  heard his voice 'Whoo-too-whoo-hoo-hoo' they felt all the old fear of  him.  If they were wise they did not stir, but if they were foolish and  so much as shivered Mr. Owl was sure to hear them and silently pounce  upon them.    \"So once more Mr. Owl grew strong and fierce.  But only at night had  anyone cause to fear him, and then only the foolish and timid.    \"And now you know,\" concluded Grandfather Frog, \"why it is that Hooty  the Owl never comes out to play with you on the Green Meadows, and why  his eyes are so big and his ears so large.\"    \"Thank you, thank you, Grandfather Frog!\" cried the Merry Little  Breezes, springing up from the white water lilies and stretching  themselves.  \"We'll bring you the first foolish green fly we can find.\"    Then away they rushed to hunt for it.          XV    DANNY MEADOW MOUSE LEARNS TO LAUGH    Danny Meadow Mouse sat on his doorstep and sulked.  The Merry Little  Breezes of Old Mother West Wind ran past, one after another, and  pointing their fingers at him cried:      \"Fie, Danny Meadow Mouse!    Better go inside the house!    Babies cry--oh my! oh my!    You're a baby--go and cry!\"      Pretty soon along the Lone Little Path came Peter Rabbit.  Peter Rabbit  looked at Danny Meadow Mouse.  Then he pointed a finger at him and said:      \"Cry, Danny, cry!    Mammy'll whip you by and by!    Then we'll all come 'round to see    How big a baby you can be.    Cry, Danny, cry!\"      Danny Meadow Mouse began to snivel.  He cried softly to himself as  Peter Rabbit hopped off down the Lone Little Path.  Soon along came  Reddy Fox.  He saw Danny Meadow Mouse sitting on his doorstep crying  all by himself.  Reddy Fox crept up behind a tall bunch of grass.  Then  suddenly he jumped out right in front of Danny Meadow Mouse.    \"Boo!\" cried Reddy Fox.    It frightened Danny Meadow Mouse.  He jumped almost out of his skin,  and ran into the house crying at the top of his voice.    \"Ha, ha, ha,\" laughed Reddy Fox      \"Danny, Danny, crying Dan    Boo-hoo-hooed and off he ran!\"      Then Reddy Fox chased his tail all the way down the Lone Little Path  onto the Green Meadows.    By and by Danny Meadow Mouse came out again and sat on his doorstep.  He had stopped crying, but he looked very unhappy and cross and sulky.  Hopping and skipping down the Lone Little Path came Striped Chipmunk.    \"Come play with me,\" called Danny Meadow Mouse.    Striped Chipmunk kept right on hopping and skipping down the Lone  Little Path.    \"Don't want to,\" said Striped Chipmunk, sticking his tongue in his  cheek.      \"Cry-baby Danny    Never'll be a manny!    Run to mamma, Danny, dear,    And she will wipe away your tear!\"      Striped Chipmunk hopped and skipped out of sight, and Danny Meadow  Mouse began to cry again because Striped Chipmunk would not play with  him.    It was true, dreadfully true!  Danny Meadow Mouse _was_ a cry-baby and  no one wanted to play with him.  If he stubbed his toe he cried.  If  Striped Chipmunk beat him in a race he cried.  If the Merry Little  Breezes pulled his whiskers just in fun he cried.  It had come to such  a pass that all the little meadow people delighted to tease him just to  make him cry.  Nowhere on all the Green Meadows was there such a  cry-baby as Danny Meadow Mouse.    So Danny sat on his doorstep and cried because no one would play with  him and he was lonely.  The more he thought how lonely he was, the more  he cried.    Presently along came old Mr. Toad.  Now Mr. Toad looks very grumpy and  out of sorts, but that is because you do not know old Mr. Toad.  When  he reached the house of Danny Meadow Mouse he stopped right in front of  Danny.  He put his right hand behind his right ear and listened.  Then  he put his left hand behind his left ear and listened some more.  Finally he put both hands on his hips and began to laugh.    Now Mr. Toad's mouth is very big indeed, and when he opens it to laugh  he opens it very wide indeed.    \"Ha, ha, ha!  Ha, ha, ha!\" laughed Mr. Toad.    Danny Meadow Mouse cried harder than ever, and the harder he cried the  harder old Mr. Toad laughed.  By and by Danny Meadow Mouse stopped  crying long enough to say to Mr. Toad:    \"What are you laughing for, Mr. Toad?\"    Mr. Toad stopped laughing long enough to reply:    \"I'm laughing, Danny Meadow Mouse, because you are crying at me.  What  are you crying for?\"    \"I'm crying,\" said Danny Meadow Mouse, \"because you are laughing at  me.\"  Then Danny began to cry again, and Mr. Toad began to laugh again.    \"What's all this about?\" demanded some one right behind them.    It was Jimmy Skunk.    \"It's a new kind of game,\" said old Mr. Toad.  \"Danny Meadow Mouse is  trying to see if he can cry longer than I can laugh.\"    Then old Mr. Toad once more opened his big mouth and began to laugh  harder than ever.  Jimmy Skunk looked at him for just a minute and he  looked so funny that Jimmy Skunk began to laugh too.    Now a good honest laugh is like whooping cough--it is catching.  The  first thing Danny Meadow Mouse knew his tears would not come.  It's a  fact, Danny Meadow Mouse had run short of tears.  The next thing he  knew he wasn't crying at all--he was laughing.  Yes, Sir, he actually  was laughing.  He tried to cry, but it was of no use at all; he just  _had_ to laugh.    The more he laughed the harder old Mr. Toad laughed.  And the harder  Mr. Toad laughed the funnier he looked.  Pretty soon all three of them,  Danny Meadow Mouse, old Mr. Toad and Jimmy Skunk, were holding their  sides and rolling over and over in the grass, they were laughing so  hard.    By and by Mr. Toad stopped laughing.    \"Dear me, dear me, this will never do!\" said Mr. Toad.  \"I must get  busy in my garden.      \"The little slugs, they creep and crawl    And eat and eat from spring to fall    They never stop to laugh nor cry,    And really couldn't if they'd try.    So if you'll excuse me I'll hurry along to get them out of my garden.\"    Mr. Toad started down the Lone Little Path.  After a few hops he paused  and turned around.    \"Danny Meadow Mouse,\" said old Mr. Toad, \"an honest laugh is like  sunshine; it brightens the whole world.  Don't forget it.\"    Jimmy Skunk remembered that he had started out to find some beetles, so  still chuckling he started for the Crooked Little Path up the hill.  Danny Meadow Mouse, once more alone, sat down on his doorstep.  His  sides were sore, he had laughed so hard, and somehow the whole world  had changed.  The grass seemed greener than he had ever seen it before.  The sunshine was brighter and the songs of the birds were sweeter.  Altogether it was a very nice world, a very nice world indeed to live  in.  Somehow he felt as if he never wanted to cry again.    Pretty soon along came the Merry Little Breezes again, chasing  butterflies.  When they saw Danny Meadow Mouse sitting on his doorstep  they pointed their fingers at him, just as before, and shouted:      \"Fie, Danny Meadow Mouse!    Better go inside the house!    Babies cry--oh my! oh my!    You're a baby--go and cry!\"      For just a little minute Danny Meadow Mouse wanted to cry.  Then he  remembered old Mr. Toad and instead began to laugh.    The Merry Little Breezes didn't know just what to make of it.  They  stopped chasing butterflies and crowded around Danny Meadow Mouse.  They began to tease him.  They pulled his whiskers and rumpled his  hair.  The more they teased the more Danny Meadow Mouse laughed.    When they found that Danny Meadow Mouse really wasn't going to cry,  they stopped teasing and invited him to come play with them in the long  meadow grass.  Such a good frolic as they did have!  When it was over  Danny Meadow Mouse once more sat down on his doorstep to rest.    Hopping and skipping back up the Lone Little Path came Striped  Chipmunk.  When he saw Danny Meadow Mouse he stuck his tongue in his  cheek and cried:      \"Cry-baby Danny    Never'll be a manny!    Run to mamma, Danny dear,    And she will wipe away your tear!\"      Instead of crying Danny Meadow Mouse began to laugh.  Striped Chipmunk  stopped and took his tongue out of his cheek.  Then he began to laugh"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/20885"],[0,"The Promised Land (#16)"],[1,"on the top of which was a promenade, and which was said  to be the burying-ground of Napoleonic soldiers. This historic rumor  meant very little to me, for I never knew what Napoleon was.    It was not my way to accept unchallenged every superstition that came  to my ears. Among the wild flowers that grew on the grassy slopes of  the Vall, there was a small daisy, popularly called \"blind flower,\"  because it was supposed to cause blindness in rash children who picked  it. I was rash, if I was awake; and I picked \"blind flowers\" behind  the house, handfuls of them, and enjoyed my eyesight unimpaired. If my  faith in nursery lore was shaken by this experience, I kept my  discovery to myself, and did not undertake to enlighten my playmates.  I find other instances, later on, of the curious fact that I was  content with _finding out_ for myself. It is curious to me because I  am not so reticent now. When I discover anything, if only a new tint  in the red sunset, I must publish the fact to all my friends. Is it  possible that in my childish reflections I recognized the fact that  ours was a secretive atmosphere, where knowledge was for the few, and  wisdom was sometimes a capital offence?    In the summer-time I lived outdoors considerably. I found many  occasions to visit my mother in the store, which gave me a long walk.  If my errand was not pressing--or perhaps even if it was--I made a  long stop on the Platz, especially if I had a companion with me. The  Platz was a rectangular space in the centre of a roomy square, with a  shady promenade around its level lawn. The Korpus faced on the Platz,  which was its drill ground. Around the square were grouped the fine  residences of the officers of the Korpus, with a great white church  occupying one side. These buildings had a fearful interest for me,  especially the church, as the dwellings and sanctuary of the enemy;  but on the Platz I was not afraid to play and seek adventures. I loved  to watch the cadets drill and play ball, or pass them close as they  promenaded, two and two, looking so perfect in white trousers and  jackets and visored caps. I loved to run with my playmates and lay out  all sorts of geometric figures on the four straight sides of the  promenade; patterns of infinite variety, traceable only by a pair of  tireless feet. If one got so wild with play as to forget all fear, one  could swing, until chased away by the guard, on the heavy chain  festoons that encircled the monument at one side of the square. This  was the only monument in Polotzk, dedicated I never knew to whom or  what. It was the monument, as the sky was the sky, and the earth,  earth: the only phenomenon of its kind, mysterious, unquestionable.    It was not far from the limits of Polotzk to the fields and woods. My  father was fond of taking us children for a long walk on a Sabbath  afternoon. I have little pictures in my mind of places where we went,  though I doubt if they could be found from my descriptions. I try in  vain to conjure up a panoramic view of the neighborhood. Even when I  stood on the apex of the Vall, and saw the level country spread in all  directions, my inexperienced eyes failed to give me the picture of the  whole. I saw the houses in the streets below, all going to market. The  highroads wandered out into the country, and disappeared in the sunny  distance, where the edge of the earth and the edge of the sky fitted  together, like a jewel box with the lid ajar. In these things I saw  what a child always sees: the unrelated fragments of a vast,  mysterious world. But although my geography may be vague, and the  scenes I remember as the pieces of a paper puzzle, still my breath  catches as I replace this bit or that, and coax the edges to fit  together. I am obstinately positive of some points, and for the rest,  you may amend the puzzle if you can. You may make a survey of Polotzk  ever so accurate, and show me where I was wrong; still I am the better  guide. You may show that my adventureful road led nowhere, but I can  prove, by the quickening of my pulse and the throbbing of my rapid  recollections, that _things happened to me_ there or here; and I shall  be believed, not you. And so over the vague canvas of scenes half  remembered, half imagined, I draw the brush of recollection, and pick  out here a landmark, there a figure, and set my own feet back in the  old ways, and live over the old events. It is real enough, as by my  beating heart you might know.    Sometimes my father took us out by the Long Road. There is no road in  the neighborhood of Polotzk by that name, but I know very well that  the way was long to my little feet; and long are the backward thoughts  that creep along it, like a sunbeam travelling with the day.    The first landmark on the sunny, dusty road is the house of a peasant  acquaintance where we stopped for rest and a drink. I remember a cool  gray interior, a woman with her bosom uncovered pattering barefoot to  hand us the hospitable dipper, and a baby smothered in a deep cradle  which hung by ropes from the ceiling. Farther on, the empty road gave  us shadows of trees and rustlings of long grass. This, at least, is  what I imagine over the spaces where no certain object is. Then, I  know, we ran and played, and it was father himself who hid in the  corn, and we made havoc following after. Laughing, we ramble on, till  we hear the long, far whistle of a locomotive. The railroad track is  just visible over the field on the _left_ of the road; the cornfield,  I say, is on the _right_. We stand on tiptoe and wave our hands and  shout as the long train rushes by at a terrific speed, leaving its  pennon of smoke behind.    The passing of the train thrilled me wonderfully. Where did it come  from, and whither did it fly, and how did it feel to be one of the  faces at the windows? If ever I dreamed of a world beyond Polotzk, it  must have been at those times, though I do not honestly remember.    Somewhere out on that same Long Road is the place where we once  attended a wedding. I do not know who were married, or whether they  lived happily ever after; but I remember that when the dancers were  wearied, and we were all sated with goodies, day was dawning, and  several of the young people went out for a stroll in a grove near by.  They took me with them--who were they?--and they lost me. At any rate,  when they saw me again, I was a stranger. For I had sojourned, for an  immeasurable moment, in a world apart from theirs. I had witnessed my  first sunrise; I had watched the rosy morning tiptoe in among the  silver birches. And that grove stands on the _left_ side of the road.    We had another stopping-place out in that direction. It was the place  where my mother sent her hundred and more house plants to be cared for  one season, because for some reason they could not fare well at home.  We children went to visit them once; and the memory of that is red and  white and purple.    The Long Road went ever on and on; I remember no turns. But we turned  at last, when the sun was set and the breeze of evening blew; and  sometimes the first star came in and the Sabbath went out before we  reached home and supper.    Another way out of town was by the bridge across the Polota. I recall  more than one excursion in that direction. Sometimes we made a large  party, annexing a few cousins and aunts for the day. At this moment I  feel a movement of affection for these relations who shared our  country adventures. I had forgotten what virtue there was in our  family; I do like people who can walk. In those days, it is likely  enough, I did not always walk on my own legs, for I was very little,  and not strong. I do not remember being carried, but if any of my big  uncles gave me a lift, I am sure I like them all the more for it.    The Dvina River swallowed the Polota many times a day, yet the lesser  stream flooded the universe on one occasion. On the hither bank of  that stream, as you go from Polotzk, I should plant a flowering bush,  a lilac or a rose, in memory of the life that bloomed in me one day  that I was there.    Leisurely we had strolled out of the peaceful town. It was early  spring, and the sky and the earth were two warm palms in which all  live things nestled. Little green leaves trembled on the trees, and  the green, green grass sparkled. We sat us down to rest a little above  the bridge; and life flowed in and out of us fully, freely, as the  river flowed and parted about the bridge piles.    A market garden lay on the opposite slope, yellow-green with first  growth. In the long black furrows yet unsown a peasant pushed his  plow. I watched him go up and down, leaving a new black line on the  bank for every turn. Suddenly he began to sing, a rude plowman's song.  Only the melody reached me, but the meaning sprang up in my heart to  fit it--a song of the earth and the hopes of the earth. I sat a long  time listening, looking, tense with attention. I felt myself  discovering things. Something in me gasped for life, and lay still. I  was but a little body, and Life Universal had suddenly burst upon me.  For a moment I had my little hand on the Great Pulse, but my fingers  slipped, empty. For the space of a wild heartbeat I _knew_, and then I  was again a simple child, looking to my earthly senses for life. But  the sky had stretched for me, the earth had expanded; a greater life  had dawned in me.    We are not born all at once, but by bits. The body first and the  spirit later; and the birth and growth of the spirit, in those who are  attentive to their own inner life, are slow and exceedingly painful.  Our mothers are racked with the pains of our physical birth; we  ourselves suffer the longer pains of our spiritual growth. Our souls  are scarred with the struggles of successive births, and the process  is recorded also by the wrinkles in our brains, by the lines in our  faces. Look at me and you will see that I have"]]]
