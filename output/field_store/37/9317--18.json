She told them all her need, and they promised her  their help, and said,    \"Then will you invite us to your wedding, and not be ashamed of us, and  call us your cousins, and let us sit at your table; if you will promise  this, we will finish off your flax-spinning in a very short time.\"    \"With all my heart,\" answered the girl; \"only come in now, and begin at  once.\"    Then these same women came in, and she cleared a space in the first room  for them to sit and carry on their spinning. The first one drew out the  thread and moved the treddle that turned the wheel, the second moistened  the thread, the third twisted it, and rapped with her finger on the  table, and as often as she rapped a heap of yarn fell to the ground, and  it was most beautifully spun. But the girl hid the three spinsters out  of the Queen's sight, and only showed her, as often as she came, the  heaps of well-spun yarn; and there was no end to the praises she  received. When the first room was empty they went on to the second, and  then to the third, so that at last all was finished. Then the three  women took their leave, saying to the girl,    \"Do not forget what you have promised, and it will be all the better for  you.\"    So when the girl took the Queen and showed her the empty rooms, and the  great heaps of yarn, the wedding was at once arranged, and the  bridegroom rejoiced that he should have so clever and diligent a wife,  and praised her exceedingly.    \"I have three cousins,\" said the girl, \"and as they have shown me a  great deal of kindness, I would not wish to forget them in my good  fortune; may I be allowed to invite them to the wedding, and to ask them  to sit at the table with us?\"    The Queen and the bridegroom said at once,    \"There is no reason against it.\"    So when the feast began in came the three spinsters in strange guise,  and the bride said,    \"Dear cousins, you are welcome.\"    \"Oh,\" said the bridegroom, \"how come you to have such dreadfully ugly  relations?\"    And then he went up to the first spinster and said,    \"How is it that you have such a broad flat foot?\"    \"With treading,\" answered she, \"with treading.\"    Then he went up to the second and said,    \"How is it that you have such a great hanging lip?\"    \"With licking,\" answered she, \"with licking.\"    Then he asked the third,    \"How is it that you have such a broad thumb?\"    \"With twisting thread,\" answered she, \"with twisting thread.\"    Then the bridegroom said that from that time forward his beautiful bride  should never touch a spinning-wheel.    And so she escaped that tiresome flax-spinning.          HANSEL AND GRETHEL      NEAR a great forest there lived a poor woodcutter and his wife, and his  two children; the boy's name was Hansel and the girl's Grethel. They had  very little to bite or to sup, and once, when there was great dearth in  the land, the man could not even gain the daily bread. As he lay in bed  one night thinking of this, and turning and tossing, he sighed heavily,  and said to his wife,    \"What will become of us? we cannot even feed our children; there is  nothing left for ourselves.\"    \"I will tell you what, husband,\" answered the wife; \"we will take the  children early in the morning into the forest, where it is thickest; we  will make them a fire, and we will give each of them a piece of bread,  then we will go to our work and leave them alone; they will never find  the way home again, and we shall be quit of them.\"    \"No, wife,\" said the man, \"I cannot do that; I cannot find in my heart  to take my children into the forest and to leave them there alone; the  wild animals would soon come and devour them.\"    \"O you fool,\" said she, \"then we will all four starve; you had better  get the coffins ready,\"--and she left him no peace until he consented.    \"But I really pity the poor children,\" said the man.    The two children had not been able to sleep for hunger, and had heard  what their step-mother had said to their father. Grethel wept bitterly,  and said to Hansel,    \"It is all over with us.\"    \"Do be quiet, Grethel,\" said Hansel, \"and do not fret; I will manage  something.\" And when the parents had gone to sleep he got up, put on his  little coat, opened the back door, and slipped out. The moon was shining  brightly, and the white flints that lay in front of the house glistened  like pieces of silver. Hansel stooped and filled the little pocket of  his coat as full as it would hold. Then he went back again, and said to  Grethel,    \"Be easy, dear little sister, and go to sleep quietly; God will not  forsake us,\" and laid himself down again in his bed.    When the day was breaking, and before the sun had risen, the wife came  and awakened the two children, saying,    \"Get up, you lazy bones; we are going into the forest to cut wood.\"    Then she gave each of them a piece of bread, and said,    \"That is for dinner, and you must not eat it before then, for you will  get no more.\"    Grethel carried the bread under her apron, for Hansel had his pockets  full of the flints. Then they set off all together on their way to the  forest. When they had gone a little way Hansel stood still and looked  back towards the house, and this he did again and again, till his father  said to him,    \"Hansel, what are you looking at? take care not to forget your legs.\"    \"O father,\" said Hansel, \"I am looking at my little white kitten, who is  sitting up on the roof to bid me good-bye.\"    \"You young fool,\" said the woman, \"that is not your kitten, but the  sunshine on the chimney-pot.\"    Of course Hansel had not been looking at his kitten, but had been taking  every now and then a flint from his pocket and dropping it on the road.    When they reached the middle of the forest the father told the children  to collect wood to make a fire to keep them warm; and Hansel and Grethel  gathered brushwood enough for a little mountain; and it was set on fire,  and when the flame was burning quite high the wife said,    \"Now lie down by the fire and rest yourselves, you children, and we will  go and cut wood; and when we are ready we will come and fetch you.\"    So Hansel and Grethel sat by the fire, and at noon they each ate their  pieces of bread. They thought their father was in the wood all the time,  as they seemed to hear the strokes of the axe: but really it was only a  dry branch hanging to a withered tree that the wind moved to and fro. So  when they had stayed there a long time their eyelids closed with  weariness, and they fell fast asleep. When at last they woke it was  night, and Grethel began to cry, and said,    \"How shall we ever get out of this wood?\" But Hansel comforted her,  saying,    \"Wait a little while longer, until the moon rises, and then we can  easily find the way home.\"    And when the full moon got up Hansel took his little sister by the hand,  and followed the way where the flint stones shone like silver, and  showed them the road. They walked on the whole night through, and at the  break of day they came to their father's house. They knocked at the  door, and when the wife opened it and saw that it was Hansel and Grethel  she said,    \"You naughty children, why did you sleep so long in the wood? we thought  you were never coming home again!\"    But the father was glad, for it had gone to his heart to leave them both  in the woods alone.    Not very long after that there was again great scarcity in those parts,  and the children heard their mother say at night in bed to their father,    \"Everything is finished up; we have only half a loaf, and after that the  tale comes to an end. The children must be off; we will take them  farther into the wood this time, so that they shall not be able to find  the way back again; there is no other way to manage.\"    The man felt sad at heart, and he thought,    \"It would better to share one's last morsel with one's children.\"    But the wife would listen to nothing that he said, but scolded and  reproached him. He who says A must say B too, and when a man has given  in once he has to do it a second time.    But the children were not asleep, and had heard all the talk. When the  parents had gone to sleep Hansel got up to go out and get more flint  stones, as he did before, but the wife had locked the door, and Hansel  could not get out; but he comforted his little sister, and said,    \"Don't cry, Grethel, and go to sleep quietly, and God will help us.\"    Early the next morning the wife came and pulled the children out of bed.  She gave them each a little piece of bread--less than before; and on the  way to the wood Hansel crumbled the bread in his pocket, and often  stopped to throw a crumb on the ground.    \"Hansel, what are you stopping behind and staring for?\" said the father.    \"I am looking at my little pigeon sitting on the roof, to say good-bye  to me,\" answered Hansel.    \"You fool,\" said the wife, \"that is no pigeon, but the morning sun  shining on the chimney pots.\"    Hansel went on as before, and strewed bread crumbs all along the road.    The woman led the children far into the wood, where they had never been  before in all their lives. And again there was a large fire made, and  the mother said,    \"Sit still there, you children, and when you are tired you can go to  sleep; we are going into the forest to cut wood, and in the evening,  when we are ready to go home we will come and fetch you.\"    So when noon came Grethel shared her bread with Hansel, who had strewed  his along the road. Then they went to sleep, and the evening passed, and  no one came for the poor children. When they awoke it was dark night,  and Hansel comforted his little sister, and said,    \"Wait a little, Grethel, until the moon gets up, then we shall be able  to see the way home by the crumbs of bread that I have scattered along  it.\"    So when the moon rose they got up, but they could find no crumbs of  bread, for the birds of the woods and of the"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/19090"],[0,"Star Hunter (#16)"],[1," our brains while we were out of our  heads. Or--\" Hume paused suddenly, looked directly at Vye. \"I have a  vague feeling that you were able to keep going a lot better than I  was. That so?\"    \"Some of the time,\" Vye admitted.    \"That checks. Part of me knew what was going on, but was helpless  while that other thing,\" his smile of moments earlier was wiped away,  there was a chill edge in his voice, \"picked over my brains, sorted  out what it wanted.\"    Vye shook his head. \"I didn't feel that way. Just thick-headed--as if  I were sleep walking and yet awake.\"    \"So it took me over, but didn't go all the way with you. Why? Another  question for our list.\"    \"Maybe--maybe Wass' techs fixed it so I couldn't be brain-picked, as  you call it,\" Vye offered.    Hume nodded. \"Could be--would well be. Come on.\" He pressed the pace  now.    Vye turned to look down the slope suspiciously. Had Hume another  warning of menace out of the wood? He could sight no movement there.  And from this distance the lake was a topaz sheet of calm which could  hide anything. Hume was already several paces ahead, scrambling as if  the valley monsters were again on their track.    \"What's the matter?\" Vye demanded, as he caught up.    \"Night coming.\" Which was true. Then Hume added, \"If we can reach the  flitter before sunset, we'll have a chance to fly over the lake down  there, to make a taping of it before we go.\"    The energy of the tablets strengthened them so that by the time they  reached the crevice door they were moving with their former agility.  For a single second Hume hesitated before that slit, almost as if he  feared the test he must make. Then he stepped forward and this time  into freedom.    They reached the ledge where the flitter perched just as they had seen  it last. How long ago that had been they could not have told, but they  suspected that days of haze hung in between. Vye searched the sky. No  globes winking there--just the flyer alone.    He took his old seat behind the pilot, watched Hume test the relays  and responses in the quick run down of a man who has done this chore  many times before. But the other gave a little sigh of relief when he  finished.    \"She's all right, we can lift.\"    Again they both looked aloft, half fearing to see those malignant  herders wink into being to forbid flight. But the sky was as serenely  clear of even a drifting cloud as they could hope. Hume pressed a  button and they arose vertically with an even progress totally unlike  the leap which had taken them out of Wass' camp.    Well above the cliff wall they hovered, and were able to see below the  round bowl of the valley prison. Hume touched controls, the flitter  descended slowly just above the center of the lake. And from this  position they were able to sight the other peculiarity of that body of  water, that it was perfectly oval in shape, far too perfect to be an  undeveloped product of nature. Hume took a round disk from his  equipment belt, fitted it carefully into a slot on the control board  and pressed the button below. Then he sent the flitter in a weaving  zigzag course well above the surface of the water, so that eventually  the flyer passed over every foot of its surface.    And from above, in spite of the turgid quality of the liquid, they  could see what did rest on the bottom of that oval. The wall with its  sharp corner which Vye had noted from shore level was only part of a  water covered erection. It made a design when seen from overhead, a  six-pointed star surrounding an oval and in the midst of that oval a  black blot which they could not identify.    Hume brought the flitter over in one last sweep. \"That's it. We have a  full taping.\"    \"What do you think it is?\"    \"A device set there by an intelligent being, and set a long time ago.  This valley wasn't arranged over night, six months ago--or even a year  ago. We'll have to let the experts tell us when and for what reason.  Now, let's head for home!\"    He brought the flitter up and over the valley wall, flying southwest  so that they passed over the gap which was the main entrance to the  trap. And now he tried the com unit, endeavoring to pick up a signal  on which they could beam in for a safe ride.    \"That's odd.\" Under Hume's control the direction finder passed back  and forth without bringing any answering code click from the mike. \"We  may be too far in the mountains to pick up the beam. I wonder....\" He  swept the needle in another direction, slightly to the left.    A crackle spat from the mike. Vye could not read code but the very  fury and intensity of that sound suggested panic--even terror.    \"What's that?\"    Hume spoke without looking away from the control board. \"Alarm.\"    \"From the safari?\"    \"No. Wass.\" For a long second Hume sat very still, his fingers quiet.  The flitter was on the automatic course, taking them out of the  mountains, and Vye thought that their air speed was such they were  already well removed from that sinister valley.    Hume made a slight adjustment to a dial, and the flitter banked,  coming around on another course. Once more he spun the finder of the  com. This time he was answered with a series of well-spaced clicks  which lacked the urgency of that other call. Hume listened until the  code rattled into silence again.    \"They're all right at the safari camp.\"    \"But Wass is in trouble. So what does that matter?\" Vye wanted to  know.    \"It matters this much.\" Hume spoke slowly as if he must convince  himself as well as Vye. \"I'm the Guild man on Jumala, and the Guild  man is responsible for all civs.\"    \"You can't call him your client!\"    Hume shook his head. \"No, he's no client. But he's human.\"    It narrowed down to that when a man was on the frontier worlds--humans  stood together. Vye wanted to deny it, but his own emotions, as well  as the centuries of age-old tradition, argued him down. Wass was a  Veep, one of the criminal parasites dabbling in human misery along  more than one solar lane. But he was also human and, as one of their  own species, had his claim on them.    Vye watched Hume take over the controls, felt the flitter answer  another change of course, then heard the frantic yammer of the  distress call as they leveled off to ride its beam in to the hidden  camp.    \"Automatic.\" Hume had turned down the volume of the receiver so that  the clicks in the mike no longer were so strident. \"Set on maximum and  left that way.\"    \"They had a force barrier around the camp and they knew about the  globes and the watchers.\" Vye tried to imagine what had happened in  that woods clearing.    \"The barrier might have shorted. And without the flitter they would  have been pinned.\"    \"Could have taken off in the spacer.\"    \"Wass doesn't have the reputation of letting any project get out of  his hands.\"    Vye remembered. \"Oh--your billion credit deal.\"    To his surprise Hume laughed. \"Seems all very far and out of orbit  now, doesn't it, Lansor? Yes, our billion credit deal--but that was  thought out before we knew there were more players around the table  than we counted. I wonder....\"    But what he wondered he did not put into words and a moment later he  added over his shoulder, \"Better try to get some rest, boy. We've some  time to a set-down.\"    Vye did sleep, deeply, dreamlessly. And he roused after a gentle  shaking to see a beam of light in the sky ahead, though around them  was the solid darkness of night.    \"That's a warning,\" Hume explained. \"And I can't raise any reply from  the camp except a repeat of the distress call. If there is anyone  there now, he can't or won't answer.\"    Against that column of light they could make out the sky-pointed taper  of the spacer and the auto-pilot landed them beside that ship in the  middle of an area well lighted by the steady shaft of light from the  tripod standing where the atom lamp had been on the night they had  made their escape from camp.    Climbing stiffly from the small flyer they advanced with caution. A  very few minutes later Hume slid his ray tube back into its belt loop.    \"Unless they've holed up in the spacer--and I can't see why they'd do  that--this camp's deserted. And they haven't taken any equipment with  them except maybe a few items they could back-pack.\"    The ship proved as empty of life as the campsite. A wall seat pulled  out too hastily so that it was jammed awry, the com cabin suggested  that the leave-taking, when and for what reason, had been a matter of  some emergency. Hume did not touch the tape set to keep on  broadcasting the call for assistance.    \"What now?\" Vye wanted to know as they completed the search.    \"The safari camp first--and a call for the Patrol.\"    \"Look here,\" Vye set down the ration container he had found, was  emptying it with vast satisfaction of one who had been too long on  tablets, \"if you beam the Patrol you'll have to talk, won't you?\"    Hume went on fitting new charges into his ray tube. \"The Patrol has to  have a full report. There's no way of bypassing that. Yes, we'll have  to give all the story. You needn't worry.\" He snapped closed the load  chamber. \"I can clear you all the way. You're the victim, remember.\"    \"I wasn't thinking about that.\"    \"Boy.\" Hume tossed the tube up in the air, caught it in his  plasta-hand. \"I went into this deal with my eyes wide open--why  doesn't matter very much now. In fact,\" he stared beyond Vye out into  the empty, lighted camp, \"I've begun to wonder about a lot of  things--maybe too late. No--we'll call the Patrol and we'll do it not  because it is Wass and his men out there, but because we're human and  they're human, and there's a nasty set-up here which has already  sucked in other humans for its own purposes.\"    The skeleton in the valley! And how very close they had been  themselves to joining that unknown in his permanent residence.    \"So now we make time--back to the safari camp. Get our message off to  the Patrol"]]]
