His method was empirical, and the laws  which he established were generally the result of repeated experiment. To  the ultimate explanation of the phenomena with which he dealt he  contributed nothing, and it is noteworthy in this connexion that if he did  not maintain to the end of his life the corpuscular theory he never  explicitly adopted the undulatory theory of light. Few will be inclined to  dispute the verdict of Forbes:--\"His scientific glory is different in kind  from that of Young and Fresnel; but the discoverer of the law of  polarization of biaxial crystals, of optical mineralogy, and of double  refraction by compression, will always occupy a foremost rank in the  intellectual history of the age.\" In addition to the various works of  Brewster already noticed, the following may be mentioned:--Notes and  Introduction to Carlyle's translation of Legendre's _Elements of Geometry_  (1824); _Treatise on Optics_ (1831); _Letters on Natural Magic,_ addressed  to Sir Walter Scott (1831); _The Martyrs of Science, or the Lives of  Galileo, Tycho Brahe, and Kepler_ (1841); _More Worlds than One_ (1854).    See _The Home Life of Sir David Brewster,_ by his daughter Mrs Gordon.    BREWSTER, WILLIAM (c. 1566-1644), American colonist, one of the leaders of  the \"Pilgrims,\" was born at Scrooby, in Nottinghamshire, England, about  1566. After studying for a short time at Cambridge, he was from 1584 to  1587 in the service of William Davison (? 1541-1608), who in 1585 went to  the Low Countries to negotiate an alliance with the states-general and in  1586 became assistant to Walsingham, Queen Elizabeth's secretary of state.  Upon the disgrace of Davison, Brewster removed to Scrooby, where from 1590  until September 1607 he held the position of \"Post,\" or postmaster  responsible for the relays of horses on the post road, having previously,  for a short time, assisted his father in that office. About 1602 his  neighbours began to assemble for worship at his home, the Scrooby manor  house, and in 1606 he joined them in organizing the Separatist church of  Scrooby. After an unsuccessful attempt in 1607 (for which he was imprisoned  for a short time), he, with other Separatists, removed to Holland in 1608  to obtain greater freedom of worship. At Leiden in 1609 he was chosen  ruling elder of the Congregation. In Holland he supported himself first by  teaching English and afterwards in 1616-1619, as the partner of one Thomas  Brewer, by secretly printing, for sale in England, books proscribed by the  English government, thus, says Bradford, having \"imploymente inough.\" In  1619 their types were seized and Brewer was arrested by the authorities of  the university of Leiden, acting on the instance of the British ambassador,  Sir Dudley Carleton. Brewster, however, escaped, and in the same year, with  Robert Cushman (c. 1580-1625), obtained in London, on behalf of his  associates, a land patent from the Virginia Company. In 1620 he emigrated  to America on the \"Mayflower,\" and was one of the founders of the Plymouth  Colony. Here besides continuing until his death to act as ruling elder, he  was also--regularly until the arrival of the first pastor, Ralph Smith (d.  1661), in 1629 and irregularly afterward--a \"teacher,\" preaching \"both  powerfully and profitably to ye great contentment of ye hearers and their  comfortable edification.\" By many he is regarded as pre-eminently the  leader of the \"Pilgrims.\" He died, probably on the 10th of April 1644.    See Ashbel Steele's _Chief of the Pilgrims; or the Life and Time of William  Brewster_ (Philadelphia, 1857); and a sketch in William Bradford's _History  of the Plimouth Plantation_ (new ed., Boston, 1898).    BREZE the name of a noble Angevin family, the most famous member of which  was PIERRE DE BREZE (c. 1410-1465), one of the trusted soldiers and  statesmen of Charles VII. He had made his name as a soldier in the English  wars when in 1433 he joined with Yolande, queen of Sicily, the constable  Richmond and others, in chasing from power Charles VII.'s minister La  Tremoille. He was knighted by Charles of Anjou in 1434, and presently  entered the royal council. In 1437 he became seneschal of Anjou, and in  1440 of Poitou. During the Praguerie he rendered great service to the royal  cause against the dauphin Louis and the revolted nobles, a service which  was remembered against him after Louis's accession to the throne. He fought  against the English in Normandy in 1440-1441, and in Guienne in 1442. In  the next year he became chamberlain to Charles VII., and gained the chief  power in the state through the influence of Agnes Sorel, superseding his  early allies Richmond and Charles of Anjou. The six years (1444-1450) of  his ascendancy were the most prosperous period of the reign of Charles VII.  His most dangerous opponent was the dauphin Louis, who in 1448 brought  against him accusations which led to a formal trial resulting in a complete  exoneration of Breze and his restoration to favour. He fought in Normandy  in 1450-1451, and became seneschal of the province after the death of Agnes  Sorel and the consequent decline of his influence at court. He made an  ineffective descent on the English coast at Sandwich in 1457, and was  preparing an expedition in favour of Margaret of Anjou when the accession  of Louis XI. brought him disgrace and a short imprisonment. In 1462,  however, his son Jacques married Louis's half-sister, Charlotte de Valois,  daughter of Agnes Sorel. In 1462 he accompanied Margaret to Scotland with a  force of 2000 men, and after the battle of Hexham he brought her back to  Flanders. On his return he was reappointed seneschal of Normandy, and fell  in the battle of Montlhery on the 16th of July 1465. He was succeeded as  seneschal of Normandy by his eldest son Jacques de Breze (c. 1440-1490),  count of Maulevrier; and by his grandson, husband of the famous Diane de  Poitiers, Louis de Breze (d. 1531), whose tomb in Rouen cathedral,  attributed to Jean Goujon and Jean Cousin, is a splendid example of French  Renaissance work.    The lordship of Breze passed eventually to Claire Clemence de Maille,  princess of Conde, by whom it was sold to Thomas Dreux, who took the name  of Dreux Breze, when it was erected into a marquisate. HENRI EVRARD,  marquis de Dreux-Breze (1762-1829), succeeded his father as master of the  ceremonies to Louis XVI. in 1781. On the meeting of the states-general in  1789 it fell to him to regulate the questions of etiquette and precedence  between the three estates. That as the immediate representative of the  crown he should wound the susceptibilities of the deputies was perhaps  inevitable, but little attempt was made to adapt traditional etiquette to  changed circumstances. Breze did not formally intimate to President Bailly  the proclamation of the royal seance until the 20th of June, when the  carpenters were about to enter the hall to prepare for the event, thus  provoking the session in the tennis court. After the royal seance Breze was  sent to reiterate Louis's orders that the estates should meet separately,  when Mirabeau replied that the hall could not be cleared except by force.  After the fall of the Tuileries Breze emigrated for a short time, but  though he returned to France he was spared during the Terror. At the  Restoration he was made a peer of France, and resumed his functions as  guardian of an antiquated ceremonial. He died on the 27th of January 1829,  when he was succeeded in the peerage and at court by his son Scipion  (1793-1845).    The best contemporary account of Pierre de Breze is given in the  _Chroniques_ of the Burgundian chronicler, Georges Chastellain, who had  been his secretary. Chastellain addressed a _Deprecation_ to Louis XI. on  his behalf at the time of his disgrace.    [v.04 p.0515] BRIALMONT, HENRI ALEXIS (1821-1903), Belgian general and  military engineer, son of General Laurent Mathieu Brialmont (d. 1885), was  born at Venlo in Limburg on the 25th of May 1821. Educated at the Brussels  military school, he entered the army as sub-lieutenant of engineers in  1843, and became lieutenant in 1847. From 1847 to 1850 he was private  secretary to the war minister, General Baron Chazal. In 1855 he entered the  staff corps, became major in 1861, lieutenant-colonel 1864, colonel in 1868  and major-general 1874. In this rank he held at first the position of  director of fortifications in the Antwerp district (December 1874), and  nine months later he became inspector-general of fortifications and of the  corps of engineers. In 1877 he became lieutenant-general. His far-reaching  schemes for the fortification of the Belgian places met with no little  opposition, and Brialmont seems to have felt much disappointment in this;  at any rate he went in 1883 to Rumania to advise as to the fortification  works required for the defence of the country, and presided over the  elaboration of the scheme by which Bucharest was to be made a first-class  fortress. He was thereupon placed _en disponibilite_ in his own service, as  having undertaken the Bucharest works without the authorization of his  sovereign. This was due in part to the suggestion of Austria, which power  regarded the Bucharest works as a menace to herself. His services were,  however, too valuable to be lost, and on his return to Belgium in 1884 he  resumed his command of the Antwerp military district. He had, further,  while in eastern Europe, prepared at the request of the Hellenic  government, a scheme for the defence of Greece. He retired in 1886, but  continued to supervise the Rumanian defences. He died on the 21st of  September 1903.    In the first stage of his career as an engineer Brialmont's plans followed  with but slight modification the ideas of Vauban; and his original scheme  for fortifying"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/19706"],[0,"Brood of the Witch-Queen (#16)"],[1,"egarious;  safety seemed to be with the crowd, amid the gaiety, where music and  laughter were, rather than in the sand-swept streets.    \"Guess we've outstayed our welcome!\" confided an American lady to  Sime. \"Egypt wants to drive us all home now.\"    \"Possibly,\" he replied with a smile. \"The season has run very late,  this year, and so this sort of thing is more or less to be expected.\"    The orchestra struck up a lively one-step, and a few of the more  enthusiastic dancers accepted the invitation, but the bulk of the  company thronged around the edge of the floor, acting as spectators.    Cairn and Sime wedged a way through the heterogeneous crowd to the  American Bar.    \"I prescribe a 'tango,'\" said Sime.    \"A 'tango' is--?\"    \"A 'tango,'\" explained Sime, \"is a new kind of cocktail sacred to this  buffet. Try it. It will either kill you or cure you.\"    Cairn smiled rather wanly.    \"I must confess that I need bucking up a bit,\" he said: \"that  confounded sand seems to have got me by the throat.\"    Sime briskly gave his orders to the bar attendant.    \"You know,\" pursued Cairn, \"I cannot get out of my head the idea that  there was someone wearing a crocodile mask in the garden a while ago.\"    \"Look here,\" growled Sime, studying the operations of the cocktail  manufacturer, \"suppose there were--what about it?\"    \"Well, it's odd that nobody else saw him.\"    \"I suppose it hasn't occurred to you that the fellow might have  removed his mask?\"    Cairn shook his head slowly.    \"I don't think so,\" he declared; \"I haven't seen him anywhere in the  hotel.\"    \"Seen him?\" Sime turned his dull gaze upon the speaker. \"How should  you know him?\"    Cairn raised his hand to his forehead in an oddly helpless way.    \"No, of course not--it's very extraordinary.\"    They took their seats at a small table, and in mutual silence loaded  and lighted their pipes. Sime, in common with many young and  enthusiastic medical men, had theories--theories of that revolutionary  sort which only harsh experience can shatter. Secretly he was disposed  to ascribe all the ills to which flesh is heir primarily to a  disordered nervous system. It was evident that Cairn's mind  persistently ran along a particular groove; something lay back of all  this erratic talk; he had clearly invested the Mask of Set with a  curious individuality.    \"I gather that you had a stiff bout of it in London?\" Sime said  suddenly.    Cairn nodded.    \"Beastly stiff. There is a lot of sound reason in your nervous theory,  Sime. It was touch and go with me for days, I am told; yet,  pathologically, I was a hale man. That would seem to show how nerves  can kill. Just a series of shocks--horrors--one piled upon another,  did as much for me as influenza, pneumonia, and two or three other  ailments together could have done.\"    Sime shook his head wisely; this was in accordance with his ideas.    \"You know Antony Ferrara?\" continued Cairn. \"Well, he has done this  for me. His damnable practices are worse than any disease. Sime, the  man is a pestilence! Although the law cannot touch him, although no  jury can convict him--he is a murderer. He controls--forces--\"    Sime was watching him intently.    \"It will give you some idea, Sime, of the pitch to which things had  come, when I tell you that my father drove to Ferrara's rooms one  night, with a loaded revolver in his pocket--\"    \"For\"--Sime hesitated--\"for protection?\"    \"No.\" Cairn leant forward across the table--\"to shoot him, Sime, shoot  him on sight, as one shoots a mad dog!\"    \"Are you serious?\"    \"As God is my witness, if Antony Ferrara had been in his rooms that  night, my father would have killed him!\"    \"It would have been a shocking scandal.\"    \"It would have been a martyrdom. The man who removes Antony Ferrara  from the earth will be doing mankind a service worthy of the highest  reward. He is unfit to live. Sometimes I cannot believe that he does  live; I expect to wake up and find that he was a figure of a  particularly evil dream.\"    \"This incident--the call at his rooms--occurred just before your  illness?\"    \"The thing which he had attempted that night was the last straw, Sime;  it broke me down. From the time that he left Oxford, Antony Ferrara  has pursued a deliberate course of crime, of crime so cunning, so  unusual, and based upon such amazing and unholy knowledge that no  breath of suspicion has touched him. Sime, you remember a girl I told  you about at Oxford one evening, a girl who came to visit him?\"    Sime nodded slowly.    \"Well--he killed her! Oh! there is no doubt about it; I saw her body  in the hospital.\"    \"_How_ had he killed her, then?\"    \"How? Only he and the God who permits him to exist can answer that,  Sime. He killed her without coming anywhere near her--and he killed  his adoptive father, Sir Michael Ferrara, by the same unholy means!\"    Sime watched him, but offered no comment.    \"It was hushed up, of course; there is no existing law which could be  used against him.\"    \"_Existing_ law?\"    \"They are ruled out, Sime, the laws that _could_ have reached him; but  he would have been burnt at the stake in the Middle Ages!\"    \"I see.\" Sime drummed his fingers upon the table. \"You had those ideas  about him at Oxford; and does Dr. Cairn seriously believe the same?\"    \"He does. So would you--you could not doubt it, Sime, not for a  moment, if you had seen what we have seen!\" His eyes blazed into a  sudden fury, suggestive of his old, robust self. \"He tried night after  night, by means of the same accursed sorcery, which everyone thought  buried in the ruins of Thebes, to kill _me_! He projected--things--\"    \"Suggested these--things, to your mind?\"    \"Something like that. I saw, or thought I saw, and smelt--pah!--I seem  to smell them now!--beetles, mummy-beetles, you know, from the skull  of a mummy! My rooms were thick with them. It brought me very near to  Bedlam, Sime. Oh! it was not merely imaginary. My father and I caught  him red-handed.\" He glanced across at the other. \"You read of the  death of Lord Lashmore? It was just after you came out.\"    \"Yes--heart.\"    \"It was his heart, yes--but Ferrara was responsible! That was the  business which led my father to drive to Ferrara's rooms with a loaded  revolver in his pocket.\"    The wind was shaking the windows, and whistling about the building  with demoniacal fury as if seeking admission; the band played a  popular waltz; and in and out of the open doors came and went groups  representative of many ages and many nationalities.    \"Ferrara,\" began Sime slowly, \"was always a detestable man, with his  sleek black hair, and ivory face. Those long eyes of his had an  expression which always tempted me to hit him. Sir Michael, if what  you say is true--and after all, Cairn, it only goes to show how little  we know of the nervous system--literally took a viper to his bosom.\"    \"He did. Antony Ferrara was his adopted son, of course; God knows to  what evil brood he really belongs.\"    Both were silent for a while. Then:    \"Gracious heavens!\"    Cairn started to his feet so wildly as almost to upset the table.    \"Look, Sime! look!\" he cried.    Sime was not the only man in the bar to hear, and to heed his words.  Sime, looking in the direction indicated by Cairn's extended finger,  received a vague impression that a grotesque, long-headed figure had  appeared momentarily in the doorway opening upon the room where the  dancers were; then it was gone again, if it had ever been there, and  he was supporting Cairn, who swayed dizzily, and had become ghastly  pale. Sime imagined that the heated air had grown suddenly even more  heated. Curious eyes were turned upon, his companion, who now sank  back into his chair, muttering:    \"The Mask, the Mask!\"    \"I think I saw the chap who seems to worry you so much,\" said Sime  soothingly. \"Wait here; I will tell the waiter to bring you a dose of  brandy; and whatever you do, don't get excited.\"    He made for the door, pausing and giving an order to a waiter on his  way, and pushed into the crowd outside. It was long past midnight, and  the gaiety, which had been resumed, seemed of a forced and feverish  sort. Some of the visitors were leaving, and a breath of hot wind  swept in from the open doors.    A pretty girl wearing a _yashmak_, who, with two similarly attired  companions, was making her way to the entrance, attracted his  attention; she seemed to be on the point of swooning. He recognised  the trio for the same that had pelted Cairn and himself with confetti  earlier in the evening.    \"The sudden heat has affected your friend,\" he said, stepping up to  them. \"My name is Dr. Sime; may I offer you my assistance?\"    The offer was accepted, and with the three he passed out on to the  terrace, where the dust grated beneath the tread, and helped the  fainting girl into an _arabiyeh_. The night was thunderously black,  the heat almost insufferable, and the tall palms in front of the hotel  bowed before the might of the scorching wind.    As the vehicle drove off, Sime stood for a moment looking after it.  His face was very grave, for there was a look in the bright eyes of  the girl in the _yashmak_ which, professionally, he did not like.  Turning up the steps, he learnt from the manager that several visitors  had succumbed to the heat. There was something furtive in the manner  of his informant's glance, and Sime looked at him significantly.    \"_Khamsin_ brings clouds of septic dust with it,\" he said. \"Let us  hope that these attacks are due to nothing more than the unexpected  rise in the temperature.\"    An air of uneasiness prevailed now throughout the hotel. The wind had  considerably abated, and crowds were leaving, pouring from the steps  into the deserted street, a dreamlike company.    Colonel Royland took Sime aside, as the latter was making his way back  to the buffet. The Colonel, whose regiment was stationed at the  Citadel, had known Sime"]]]
