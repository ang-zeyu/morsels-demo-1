There is a great lesson as well as a lofty  example in such a career, and in the service which such a man rendered  by his life and work to literature and to his country. On the tomb of  the conqueror of Quebec it is written: \"Here lies Wolfe victorious.\"  The same epitaph might with entire justice be carved above the grave of  Wolfe's historian.          \"REMEMBER THE ALAMO\"         The muffled drum's sad roll has beat        The soldier's last tattoo;       No more on life's parade shall meet        That brave and fallen few.       On fame's eternal camping-ground        Their silent tents are spread,       And glory guards with solemn round        The bivouac of the dead.                      *  *  *         The neighing troop, the flashing blade,        The bugle's stirring blast,       The charge, the dreadful cannonade,        The din and shout are past;       Nor war's wild note, nor glory's peal        Shall thrill with fierce delight       Those breasts that never more may feel        The rapture of the fight.                         --Theodore O'Hara.      \"Thermopylae had its messengers of death, but the Alamo had none.\" These  were the words with which a United States senator referred to one of  the most resolute and effective fights ever waged by brave men against  overwhelming odds in the face of certain death.    Soon after the close of the second war with Great Britain, parties of  American settlers began to press forward into the rich, sparsely settled  territory of Texas, then a portion of Mexico. At first these immigrants  were well received, but the Mexicans speedily grew jealous of them, and  oppressed them in various ways. In consequence, when the settlers  felt themselves strong enough, they revolted against Mexican rule, and  declared Texas to be an independent republic. Immediately Santa Anna,  the Dictator of Mexico, gathered a large army, and invaded Texas. The  slender forces of the settlers were unable to meet his hosts. They were  pressed back by the Mexicans, and dreadful atrocities were committed  by Santa Anna and his lieutenants. In the United States there was great  enthusiasm for the struggling Texans, and many bold backwoodsmen and  Indian-fighters swarmed to their help. Among them the two most famous  were Sam Houston and David Crockett. Houston was the younger man, and  had already led an extraordinary and varied career. When a mere lad he  had run away from home and joined the Cherokees, living among them for  some years; then he returned home. He had fought under Andrew Jackson in  his campaigns against the Creeks, and had been severely wounded at the  battle of the Horse-shoe Bend. He had risen to the highest political  honors in his State, becoming governor of Tennessee; and then suddenly,  in a fit of moody longing for the life of the wilderness, he gave up his  governorship, left the State, and crossed the Mississippi, going to join  his old comrades, the Cherokees, in their new home along the waters  of the Arkansas. Here he dressed, lived, fought, hunted, and drank  precisely like any Indian, becoming one of the chiefs.    David Crockett was born soon after the Revolutionary War. He, too, had  taken part under Jackson in the campaigns against the Creeks, and had  afterward become a man of mark in Tennessee, and gone to Congress as a  Whig; but he had quarreled with Jackson, and been beaten for Congress,  and in his disgust he left the State and decided to join the Texans. He  was the most famous rifle-shot in all the United States, and the most  successful hunter, so that his skill was a proverb all along the border.    David Crockett journeyed south, by boat and horse, making his way  steadily toward the distant plains where the Texans were waging their  life-and-death fight. Texas was a wild place in those days, and the old  hunter had more than one hairbreadth escape from Indians, desperadoes,  and savage beasts, ere he got to the neighborhood of San Antonio, and  joined another adventurer, a bee-hunter, bent on the same errand as  himself. The two had been in ignorance of exactly what the situation in  Texas was; but they soon found that the Mexican army was marching toward  San Antonio, whither they were going. Near the town was an old Spanish  fort, the Alamo, in which the hundred and fifty American defenders of  the place had gathered. Santa Anna had four thousand troops with  him. The Alamo was a mere shell, utterly unable to withstand either a  bombardment or a regular assault. It was evident, therefore, that those  within it would be in the utmost jeopardy if the place were seriously  assaulted, but old Crockett and his companion never wavered. They were  fearless and resolute, and masters of woodcraft, and they managed to  slip through the Mexican lines and join the defenders within the walls.  The bravest, the hardiest, the most reckless men of the border were  there; among them were Colonel Travis, the commander of the fort, and  Bowie, the inventor of the famous bowie-knife. They were a wild and  ill-disciplined band, little used to restraint or control, but they were  men of iron courage and great bodily powers, skilled in the use of their  weapons, and ready to meet with stern and uncomplaining indifference  whatever doom fate might have in store for them.    Soon Santa Anna approached with his army, took possession of the town,  and besieged the fort. The defenders knew there was scarcely a chance  of rescue, and that it was hopeless to expect that one hundred and  fifty men, behind defenses so weak, could beat off four thousand trained  soldiers, well armed and provided with heavy artillery; but they had no  idea of flinching, and made a desperate defense. The days went by, and  no help came, while Santa Anna got ready his lines, and began a furious  cannonade. His gunners were unskilled, however, and he had to serve the  guns from a distance; for when they were pushed nearer, the American  riflemen crept forward under cover, and picked off the artillerymen.  Old Crockett thus killed five men at one gun. But, by degrees, the  bombardment told. The walls of the Alamo were battered and riddled; and  when they had been breached so as to afford no obstacle to the rush of  his soldiers, Santa Anna commanded that they be stormed.    The storm took place on March 6, 1836. The Mexican troops came on well  and steadily, breaking through the outer defenses at every point,  for the lines were too long to be manned by the few Americans. The  frontiersmen then retreated to the inner building, and a desperate  hand-to-hand conflict followed, the Mexicans thronging in, shooting  the Americans with their muskets, and thrusting at them with lance and  bayonet, while the Americans, after firing their long rifles, clubbed  them, and fought desperately, one against many; and they also used their  bowie-knives and revolvers with deadly effect. The fight reeled to and  fro between the shattered walls, each American the center of a group of  foes; but, for all their strength and their wild fighting courage, the  defenders were too few, and the struggle could have but one end. One by  one the tall riflemen succumbed, after repeated thrusts with bayonet and  lance, until but three or four were left. Colonel Travis, the commander,  was among them; and so was Bowie, who was sick and weak from a wasting  disease, but who rallied all his strength to die fighting, and who, in  the final struggle, slew several Mexicans with his revolver, and with  his big knife of the kind to which he had given his name. Then these  fell too, and the last man stood at bay. It was old Davy Crockett.  Wounded in a dozen places, he faced his foes with his back to the wall,  ringed around by the bodies of the men he had slain. So desperate was  the fight he waged, that the Mexicans who thronged round about him  were beaten back for the moment, and no one dared to run in upon him.  Accordingly, while the lancers held him where he was, for, weakened  by wounds and loss of blood, he could not break through them, the  musketeers loaded their carbines and shot him down. Santa Anna declined  to give him mercy. Some say that when Crockett fell from his wounds, he  was taken alive, and was then shot by Santa Anna's order; but his fate  cannot be told with certainty, for not a single American was left alive.  At any rate, after Crockett fell the fight was over. Every one of the  hardy men who had held the Alamo lay still in death. Yet they died well  avenged, for four times their number fell at their hands in the battle.    Santa Anna had but a short while in which to exult over his bloody and  hard-won victory. Already a rider from the rolling Texas plains, going  north through the Indian Territory, had told Houston that the Texans  were up and were striving for their liberty. At once in Houston's mind  there kindled a longing to return to the men of his race at the time of  their need. Mounting his horse, he rode south by night and day, and was  hailed by the Texans as a heaven-sent leader. He took command of their  forces, eleven hundred stark riflemen, and at the battle of San Jacinto,  he and his men charged the Mexican hosts with the cry of \"Remember the  Alamo.\" Almost immediately, the Mexicans were overthrown with terrible  slaughter; Santa Anna himself was captured, and the freedom of Texas was  won at a blow.          HAMPTON ROADS         Then far away to the south uprose        A little feather of snow-white smoke,       And we knew that the iron ship of our foes        Was steadily steering its course        To try the force       Of our ribs of oak.

He was  my only boy. Who will take care of me in my old age? Why have the gods  treated me in this cruel way?\"    She wept, tore her hair, and beat her chest, until people said she had  gone mad. The longer she mourned, the more violent she became.    The next day, however, much to the surprise of her neighbours, she set  out for the city, making her way along slowly by means of her crutch. It  was a pitiful sight to see her, so old, so feeble, and so lonely. Every  one was sorry for her and pointed her out, saying, \"See! the poor old  soul has no one to help her!\"    In the city she asked her way to the public hall. When she found the  place she knelt at the front gate, calling out loudly and telling of her  ill-fortune. Just at this moment the mandarin, or city judge, walked  into the court room to try any cases which might be brought before him.  He heard the old woman weeping and wailing outside, and bade one of the  servants let her enter and tell him of her wrongs.    Now this was just what the Widow T'ang had come for. Calming herself,  she hobbled into the great hall of trial.    \"What is the matter, old woman? Why do you raise such an uproar in front  of my yamen? Speak up quickly and tell me of your trouble.\"    \"I am old and feeble,\" she began; \"lame and almost blind. I have no  money and no way of earning money. I have not one relative now in all  the empire. I depended on my only son for a living. Every day he climbed  the mountain, for he was a woodcutter, and every evening he came back  home, bringing enough money for our food. But yesterday he went and did  not return. A mountain tiger carried him off and ate him, and now, alas!  there seems to be no help for it--I must die of hunger. My bleeding  heart cries out for justice. I have come into this hall to-day, to beg  your worship to see that the slayer of my son is punished. Surely the  law says that none may shed blood without giving his own blood in  payment.\"    \"But, woman, are you mad?\" cried the mandarin, laughing loudly. \"Did you  not say it was a tiger that killed your son? How can a tiger be brought  to justice? Of a truth, you must have lost your senses.\"    The judge's questions were of no avail. The Widow T'ang kept up her  clamour. She would not be turned away until she had gained her purpose.  The hall echoed with the noise of her howling. The mandarin could stand  it no longer. \"Hold! woman,\" he cried, \"stop your shrieking. I will do  what you ask. Only go home and wait until I summon you to court. The  slayer of your son shall be caught and punished.\"    The judge was, of course, only trying to get rid of the demented mother,  thinking that if she were only once out of his sight, he could give  orders not to let her into the hall again. The old woman, however, was  too sharp for him. She saw through his plan and became more stubborn  than ever.    \"No, I cannot go,\" she answered, \"until I have seen you sign the order  for that tiger to be caught and brought into this judgment hall.\"    Now, as the judge was not really a bad man, he decided to humour the old  woman in her strange plea. Turning to the assistants in the court room  he asked which of them would be willing to go in search of the tiger.  One of these men, named Li-neng, had been leaning against the wall, half  asleep. He had been drinking heavily and so had not heard what had been  going on in the room. One of his friends gave him a poke in the ribs  just as the judge asked for volunteers.    Thinking the judge had called him by name, he stepped forward, knelt on  the floor, saying, \"I, Li-neng, can go and do the will of your worship.\"    \"Very well, you will do,\" answered the judge. \"Here is your order. Go  forth and do your duty.\" So saying, he handed the warrant to Li-neng.  \"Now, old woman, are you satisfied?\" he continued.    \"Quite satisfied, your worship,\" she replied.    \"Then go home and wait there until I send for you.\"    Mumbling a few words of thanks, the unhappy mother left the building.    When Li-neng went outside the court room, his friends crowded round him.  \"Drunken sot!\" they laughed; \"do you know what you have done?\"    Li-neng shook his head. \"Just a little business for the mandarin, isn't  it? Quite easy.\"    \"Call it easy, if you like. What! man, arrest a tiger, a man-eating  tiger and bring him to the city! Better go and say good-bye to your  father and mother. They will never see you again.\"    Li-neng slept off his drunkenness, and then saw that his friends were  right. He had been very foolish. But surely the judge had meant the  whole thing only as a joke! No such order had ever been written before!  It was plain that the judge had hit on this plan simply to get rid of  the wailing old woman. Li-neng took the warrant back to the judgment  hall and told the mandarin that the tiger could not be found.    But the judge was in no mood for joking. \"Can't be found? And why not?  You agreed to arrest this tiger. Why is it that to-day you try to get  out of your promise? I can by no means permit this, for I have given my  word to satisfy the old woman in her cry for justice.\"    Li-neng knelt and knocked his head on the floor. \"I was drunk,\" he  cried, \"when I gave my promise. I knew not what you were asking. I can  catch a man, but not a tiger. I know nothing of such matters. Still, if  you wish it, I can go into the hills and hire hunters to help me.\"    \"Very well, it makes no difference how you catch him, as long as you  bring him into court. If you fail in your duty, there is nothing left  but to beat you until you succeed. I give you five days.\"    During the next few days Li-neng left no stone unturned in trying to  find the guilty tiger. The best hunters in the country were employed.  Night and day they searched the hills, hiding in mountain caves,  watching and waiting, but finding nothing. It was all very trying for  Li-neng, since he now feared the heavy hands of the judge more than the  claws of the tiger. On the fifth day he had to report his failure. He  received a thorough beating, fifty blows on the back. But that was not  the worst of it. During the next six weeks, try as he would, he could  find no traces of the missing animal. At the end of each five days, he  got another beating for his pains. The poor fellow was in despair.  Another month of such treatment would lay him on his deathbed. This he  knew very well, and yet he had little hope. His friends shook their  heads when they saw him. \"He is drawing near the wood,\" they said to  each other, meaning that he would soon be in his coffin. \"Why don't you  flee the country?\" they asked him. \"Follow the tiger's example. You see  he has escaped completely. The judge would make no effort to catch you  if you should go across the border into the next province.\"    Li-neng shook his head on hearing this advice. He had no desire to leave  his family for ever, and he felt sure of being caught and put to death  if he should try to run away.    One day after all the hunters had given up the search in disgust and  gone back to their homes in the valley, Li-neng entered a mountain  temple to pray. The tears rained down his cheeks as he knelt before the  great fierce-looking idol. \"Alas! I am a dead man!\" he moaned between  his prayers; \"a dead man, for now there is no hope. Would that I had  never touched a drop of wine!\"    Just then he heard a slight rustling near by. Looking up, he saw a huge  tiger standing at the temple gate. But Li-neng was no longer afraid of  tigers. He knew there was only one way to save himself. \"Ah,\" he said,  looking the great cat straight in the eye, \"you have come to eat me,  have you? Well, I fear you would find my flesh a trifle tough, since I  have been beaten with four hundred blows during these six weeks. You are  the same fellow that carried off the woodman last month, aren't you?  This woodman was an only son, the sole support of an old mother. Now  this poor woman has reported you to the mandarin, who, in turn, has had  a warrant drawn up for your arrest. I have been sent out to find you and  lead you to trial. For some reason or other you have acted the coward,  and remained in hiding. This has been the cause of my beating. Now I  don't want to suffer any longer as a result of your murder. You must  come with me to the city and answer the charge of killing the woodman.\"    All the time Li-neng was speaking, the tiger listened closely. When  the man was silent, the animal made no effort to escape, but, on the  contrary, seemed willing and ready to be captured. He bent his head  forward and let Li-neng slip a strong chain over it. Then he followed  the man quietly down the mountain, through the crowded streets of the  city, into the court room. All along the way there was great excitement.  \"The man-slaying tiger has been caught,\" shouted the people. \"He is  being led to trial.\"    The crowd followed Li-neng into the hall of justice. When the judge  walked in, every one became as quiet as the grave. All were filled with  wonder at the strange sight of a tiger being called before a judge.    The great animal did not seem to be afraid of those who were watching so  curiously. He sat down in front of the mandarin, for all the world like  a huge cat. The judge rapped on the table as a signal that all was ready  for the trial.    \"Tiger,\" said he, turning toward the prisoner, \"did you eat the woodman  whom you are charged with killing?\"    The tiger gravely nodded his head.    \"Yes, he killed my boy!\" screamed the aged mother. \"Kill him! Give him  the death that he deserves!\"    \"A life for a life is the law of the land,\" continued the judge, paying  no attention to the forlorn mother, but looking the accused directly  in the eye. \"Did you not know it? You have robbed a helpless old woman  of her only son. There are no relatives to support her. She is crying  for vengeance. You must be punished for your crime. The law must"]]]
