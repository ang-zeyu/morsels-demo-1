If any one wishes to  be impressed with a sense of the soul-killing power of slavery, let him  go to Col. Lloyd's plantation, and, on allowance day, place himself  in the deep, pine woods, and there let him, in silence, thoughtfully  analyze the sounds that shall pass through the chambers of his soul, and  if he is not thus impressed, it will only be because \"there is no flesh  in his obdurate heart.\"      The remark is not unfrequently made, that slaves are the most contended  and happy laborers in the world. They dance and sing, and make all  manner of joyful noises--so they do; but it is a great mistake to  suppose them happy because they sing. The songs of the slave represent  the sorrows, rather than the joys, of his heart; and he is relieved  by them, only as an aching heart is relieved by its tears. Such is the  constitution of the human mind, that, when pressed to extremes, it often  avails itself of the most opposite methods. Extremes meet in mind as  in matter. When the slaves on board of the \"Pearl\" were overtaken,  arrested, and carried to prison--their hopes for freedom blasted--as  they marched in chains they sang, and found (as Emily Edmunson tells  us) a melancholy relief in singing. The singing of a man cast away on a  desolate island, might be as appropriately considered an evidence of  his contentment and happiness, as the singing of a slave. Sorrow and  desolation have their songs, as well as joy and peace. Slaves sing more  to _make_ themselves happy, than to express their happiness.    It is the boast of slaveholders, that their slaves enjoy more of the  physical comforts of life than the peasantry of any country in the  world. My experience contradicts this. The men and the women slaves on  Col. Lloyd's farm, received, as their monthly{78} allowance of food,  eight pounds of pickled pork, or their equivalent in fish. The pork was  often tainted, and the fish was of the poorest quality--herrings, which  would bring very little if offered for sale in any northern market. With  their pork or fish, they had one bushel of Indian meal--unbolted--of  which quite fifteen per cent was fit only to feed pigs. With this, one  pint of salt was given; and this was the entire monthly allowance of  a full grown slave, working constantly in the open field, from morning  until night, every day in the month except Sunday, and living on a  fraction more than a quarter of a pound of meat per day, and less than  a peck of corn-meal per week. There is no kind of work that a man can do  which requires a better supply of food to prevent physical exhaustion,  than the field-work of a slave. So much for the slave's allowance of  food; now for his raiment. The yearly allowance of clothing for the  slaves on this plantation, consisted of two tow-linen shirts--such linen  as the coarsest crash towels are made of; one pair of trowsers of  the same material, for summer, and a pair of trowsers and a jacket  of woolen, most slazily put together, for winter; one pair of yarn  stockings, and one pair of shoes of the coarsest description. The  slave's entire apparel could not have cost more than eight dollars per  year. The allowance of food and clothing for the little children, was  committed to their mothers, or to the older slavewomen having the care  of them. Children who were unable to work in the field, had neither  shoes, stockings, jackets nor trowsers given them. Their clothing  consisted of two coarse tow-linen shirts--already described--per year;  and when these failed them, as they often did, they went naked until  the next allowance day. Flocks of little children from five to ten years  old, might be seen on Col. Lloyd's plantation, as destitute of clothing  as any little heathen on the west coast of Africa; and this, not merely  during the summer months, but during the frosty weather of March. The  little girls were no better off than the boys; all were nearly in a  state of nudity.{79}    As to beds to sleep on, they were known to none of the field hands;  nothing but a coarse blanket--not so good as those used in the north to  cover horses--was given them, and this only to the men and women. The  children stuck themselves in holes and corners, about the quarters;  often in the corner of the huge chimneys, with their feet in the ashes  to keep them warm. The want of beds, however, was not considered a very  great privation. Time to sleep was of far greater importance, for, when  the day's work is done, most of the slaves have their washing, mending  and cooking to do; and, having few or none of the ordinary facilities  for doing such things, very many of their sleeping hours are consumed in  necessary preparations for the duties of the coming day.    The sleeping apartments--if they may be called such--have little regard  to comfort or decency. Old and young, male and female, married and  single, drop down upon the common clay floor, each covering up with his  or her blanket,--the only protection they have from cold or exposure.  The night, however, is shortened at both ends. The slaves work often as  long as they can see, and are late in cooking and mending for the coming  day; and, at the first gray streak of morning, they are summoned to the  field by the driver's horn.    More slaves are whipped for oversleeping than for any other fault.  Neither age nor sex finds any favor. The overseer stands at the quarter  door, armed with stick and cowskin, ready to whip any who may be a few  minutes behind time. When the horn is blown, there is a rush for the  door, and the hindermost one is sure to get a blow from the overseer.  Young mothers who worked in the field, were allowed an hour, about ten  o'clock in the morning, to go home to nurse their children. Sometimes  they were compelled to take their children with them, and to leave them  in the corner of the fences, to prevent loss of time in nursing them.  The overseer generally rides about the field on horseback. A cowskin and  a hickory stick are his constant companions. The{80} cowskin is a  kind of whip seldom seen in the northern states. It is made entirely  of untanned, but dried, ox hide, and is about as hard as a piece of  well-seasoned live oak. It is made of various sizes, but the usual  length is about three feet. The part held in the hand is nearly an  inch in thickness; and, from the extreme end of the butt or handle, the  cowskin tapers its whole length to a point. This makes it quite elastic  and springy. A blow with it, on the hardest back, will gash the flesh,  and make the blood start. Cowskins are painted red, blue and green,  and are the favorite slave whip. I think this whip worse than the  \"cat-o'nine-tails.\" It condenses the whole strength of the arm to a  single point, and comes with a spring that makes the air whistle. It  is a terrible instrument, and is so handy, that the overseer can always  have it on his person, and ready for use. The temptation to use it is  ever strong; and an overseer can, if disposed, always have cause for  using it. With him, it is literally a word and a blow, and, in most  cases, the blow comes first.    As a general rule, slaves do not come to the quarters for either  breakfast or dinner, but take their \"ash cake\" with them, and eat it  in the field. This was so on the home plantation; probably, because  the distance from the quarter to the field, was sometimes two, and even  three miles.    The dinner of the slaves consisted of a huge piece of ash cake, and a  small piece of pork, or two salt herrings. Not having ovens, nor any  suitable cooking utensils, the slaves mixed their meal with a little  water, to such thickness that a spoon would stand erect in it; and,  after the wood had burned away to coals and ashes, they would place the  dough between oak leaves and lay it carefully in the ashes, completely  covering it; hence, the bread is called ash cake. The surface of this  peculiar bread is covered with ashes, to the depth of a sixteenth part  of an inch, and the ashes, certainly, do not make it very grateful to  the teeth, nor render it very palatable. The bran, or coarse part of  the meal, is baked with the fine, and bright scales run through the  bread.{81} This bread, with its ashes and bran, would disgust and choke  a northern man, but it is quite liked by the slaves. They eat it with  avidity, and are more concerned about the quantity than about the  quality. They are far too scantily provided for, and are worked too  steadily, to be much concerned for the quality of their food. The few  minutes allowed them at dinner time, after partaking of their coarse  repast, are variously spent. Some lie down on the \"turning row,\" and go  to sleep; others draw together, and talk; and others are at work with  needle and thread, mending their tattered garments. Sometimes you may  hear a wild, hoarse laugh arise from a circle, and often a song. Soon,  however, the overseer comes dashing through the field. _\"Tumble up!  Tumble up_, and to _work, work,\"_ is the cry; and, now, from twelve  o'clock (mid-day) till dark, the human cattle are in motion, wielding  their clumsy hoes; hurried on by no hope of reward, no sense of  gratitude, no love of children, no prospect of bettering their  condition; nothing, save the dread and terror of the slave-driver's  lash. So goes one day, and so comes and goes another.    But, let us now leave the rough usage of the field, where vulgar  coarseness and brutal cruelty spread themselves and flourish, rank as  weeds in the tropics; where a vile wretch, in the shape of a man,  rides, walks, or struts about, dealing blows, and leaving gashes on  broken-spirited men and helpless women, for thirty dollars per month--a  business so horrible, hardening and disgraceful, that, rather, than  engage in it, a decent man would blow his own brains out--and let the  reader view with me the equally wicked, but less repulsive aspects of "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/2020"],[0,"Tarzan the Terrible (#16)"],[1,"came slowly  toward him. A whack on the median horn brought it to a stop. Then the  Tor-o-don walked around behind it, clambered up its tail and seated  himself astraddle of the huge back.  \"Whee-oo!\" he shouted and prodded  the beast with a sharp point of his stick. The GRYF commenced to move  off.    So rapt had Tarzan been in the scene below him that he had given no  thought to escape, for he realized that for him and Pan-at-lee time had  in these brief moments turned back countless ages to spread before  their eyes a page of the dim and distant past. They two had looked upon  the first man and his primitive beasts of burden.    And now the ridden GRYF halted and looked up at them, bellowing. It was  sufficient. The creature had warned its master of their presence.  Instantly the Tor-o-don urged the beast close beneath the tree which  held them, at the same time leaping to his feet upon the horny back.  Tarzan saw the bestial face, the great fangs, the mighty muscles. From  the loins of such had sprung the human race--and only from such could  it have sprung, for only such as this might have survived the horrid  dangers of the age that was theirs.    The Tor-o-don beat upon his breast and growled horribly--hideous,  uncouth, beastly. Tarzan rose to his full height upon a swaying  branch--straight and beautiful as a demigod--unspoiled by the taint of  civilization--a perfect specimen of what the human race might have been  had the laws of man not interfered with the laws of nature.    The Present fitted an arrow to his bow and drew the shaft far back. The  Past basing its claims upon brute strength sought to reach the other  and drag him down; but the loosed arrow sank deep into the savage heart  and the Past sank back into the oblivion that had claimed his kind.    \"Tarzan-jad-guru!\" murmured Pan-at-lee, unknowingly giving him out of  the fullness of her admiration the same title that the warriors of her  tribe had bestowed upon him.    The ape-man turned to her. \"Pan-at-lee,\" he said, \"these beasts may  keep us treed here indefinitely. I doubt if we can escape together, but  I have a plan. You remain here, hiding yourself in the foliage, while I  start back across the gorge in sight of them and yelling to attract  their attention. Unless they have more brains than I suspect they will  follow me. When they are gone you make for the cliff. Wait for me in  the cave not longer than today. If I do not come by tomorrow's sun you  will have to start back for Kor-ul-JA alone. Here is a joint of deer  meat for you.\" He had severed one of the deer's hind legs and this he  passed up to her.    \"I cannot desert you,\" she said simply; \"it is not the way of my people  to desert a friend and ally. Om-at would never forgive me.\"    \"Tell Om-at that I commanded you to go,\" replied Tarzan.    \"It is a command?\" she asked.    \"It is! Good-bye, Pan-at-lee. Hasten back to Om-at--you are a fitting  mate for the chief of Kor-ul-JA.\" He moved off slowly through the trees.    \"Good-bye, Tarzan-jad-guru!\" she called after him. \"Fortunate are my  Om-at and his Pan-at-lee in owning such a friend.\"    Tarzan, shouting aloud, continued upon his way and the great gryfs,  lured by his voice, followed beneath. His ruse was evidently proving  successful and he was filled with elation as he led the bellowing  beasts farther and farther from Pan-at-lee. He hoped that she would  take advantage of the opportunity afforded her for escape, yet at the  same time he was filled with concern as to her ability to survive the  dangers which lay between Kor-ul-GRYF and Kor-ul-JA. There were lions  and Tor-o-dons and the unfriendly tribe of Kor-ul-lul to hinder her  progress, though the distance in itself to the cliffs of her people was  not great.    He realized her bravery and understood the resourcefulness that she  must share in common with all primitive people who, day by day, must  contend face to face with nature's law of the survival of the fittest,  unaided by any of the numerous artificial protections that civilization  has thrown around its brood of weaklings.    Several times during this crossing of the gorge Tarzan endeavored to  outwit his keen pursuers, but all to no avail. Double as he would he  could not throw them off his track and ever as he changed his course  they changed theirs to conform. Along the verge of the forest upon the  southeastern side of the gorge he sought some point at which the trees  touched some negotiable portion of the cliff, but though he traveled  far both up and down the gorge he discovered no such easy avenue of  escape. The ape-man finally commenced to entertain an idea of the  hopelessness of his case and to realize to the full why the Kor-ul-GRYF  had been religiously abjured by the races of Pal-ul-don for all these  many ages.    Night was falling and though since early morning he had sought  diligently a way out of this cul-de-sac he was no nearer to liberty  than at the moment the first bellowing GRYF had charged him as he  stooped over the carcass of his kill: but with the falling of night  came renewed hope for, in common with the great cats, Tarzan was, to a  greater or lesser extent, a nocturnal beast. It is true he could not  see by night as well as they, but that lack was largely recompensed for  by the keenness of his scent and the highly developed sensitiveness of  his other organs of perception. As the blind follow and interpret their  Braille characters with deft fingers, so Tarzan reads the book of the  jungle with feet and hands and eyes and ears and nose; each  contributing its share to the quick and accurate translation of the  text.    But again he was doomed to be thwarted by one vital weakness--he did  not know the GRYF, and before the night was over he wondered if the  things never slept, for wheresoever he moved they moved also, and  always they barred his road to liberty. Finally, just before dawn, he  relinquished his immediate effort and sought rest in a friendly tree  crotch in the safety of the middle terrace.    Once again was the sun high when Tarzan awoke, rested and refreshed.  Keen to the necessities of the moment he made no effort to locate his  jailers lest in the act he might apprise them of his movements. Instead  he sought cautiously and silently to melt away among the foliage of the  trees. His first move, however, was heralded by a deep bellow from  below.    Among the numerous refinements of civilization that Tarzan had failed  to acquire was that of profanity, and possibly it is to be regretted  since there are circumstances under which it is at least a relief to  pent emotion. And it may be that in effect Tarzan resorted to profanity  if there can be physical as well as vocal swearing, since immediately  the bellow announced that his hopes had been again frustrated, he  turned quickly and seeing the hideous face of the GRYF below him seized  a large fruit from a nearby branch and hurled it viciously at the  horned snout. The missile struck full between the creature's eyes,  resulting in a reaction that surprised the ape-man; it did not arouse  the beast to a show of revengeful rage as Tarzan had expected and  hoped; instead the creature gave a single vicious side snap at the  fruit as it bounded from his skull and then turned sulkily away,  walking off a few steps.    There was that in the act that recalled immediately to Tarzan's mind  similar action on the preceding day when the Tor-o-don had struck one  of the creatures across the face with his staff, and instantly there  sprung to the cunning and courageous brain a plan of escape from his  predicament that might have blanched the cheek of the most heroic.    The gambling instinct is not strong among creatures of the wild; the  chances of their daily life are sufficient stimuli for the beneficial  excitement of their nerve centers. It has remained for civilized man,  protected in a measure from the natural dangers of existence, to invent  artificial stimulants in the form of cards and dice and roulette  wheels. Yet when necessity bids there are no greater gamblers than the  savage denizens of the jungle, the forest, and the hills, for as  lightly as you roll the ivory cubes upon the green cloth they will  gamble with death--their own lives the stake.    And so Tarzan would gamble now, pitting the seemingly wild deductions  of his shrewd brain against all the proofs of the bestial ferocity of  his antagonists that his experience of them had adduced--against all  the age-old folklore and legend that had been handed down for countless  generations and passed on to him through the lips of Pan-at-lee.    Yet as he worked in preparation for the greatest play that man can make  in the game of life, he smiled; nor was there any indication of haste  or excitement or nervousness in his demeanor.    First he selected a long, straight branch about two inches in diameter  at its base. This he cut from the tree with his knife, removed the  smaller branches and twigs until he had fashioned a pole about ten feet  in length. This he sharpened at the smaller end. The staff finished to  his satisfaction he looked down upon the triceratops.    \"Whee-oo!\" he cried.    Instantly the beasts raised their heads and looked at him. From the  throat of one of them came faintly a low rumbling sound.    \"Whee-oo!\" repeated Tarzan and hurled the balance of the carcass of the  deer to them.    Instantly the gryfs fell upon it with much bellowing, one of them  attempting to seize it and keep it from the other: but finally the  second obtained a hold and an instant later it had been torn asunder  and greedily devoured. Once again they looked up at the ape-man and  this time they saw him descending to the ground.    One of them started toward him. Again Tarzan repeated the weird cry of  the Tor-o-don. The GRYF halted in his track, apparently puzzled, while  Tarzan slipped lightly to the earth and advanced toward the nearer  beast, his staff "]]]
