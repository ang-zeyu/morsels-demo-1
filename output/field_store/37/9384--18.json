They all continued their regard for me as long as  they lived.    Before I enter upon my public appearance in business, it may be well  to let you know the then state of my mind with regard to my principles  and morals, that you may see how far those influenc'd the future  events of my life. My parents had early given me religious  impressions, and brought me through my childhood piously in the  Dissenting way. But I was scarce fifteen, when, after doubting by  turns of several points, as I found them disputed in the different  books I read, I began to doubt of Revelation itself. Some books  against Deism[52] fell into my hands; they were said to be the  substance of sermons preached at Boyle's Lectures. It happened that  they wrought an effect on me quite contrary to what was intended by  them; for the arguments of the Deists, which were quoted to be  refuted, appeared to me much stronger than the refutations; in short,  I soon became a thorough Deist. My arguments perverted some others,  particularly Collins and Ralph; but, each of them having afterwards  wrong'd me greatly without the least compunction, and recollecting  Keith's conduct towards me (who was another free-thinker), and my own  towards Vernon and Miss Read, which at times gave me great trouble, I  began to suspect that this doctrine, tho' it might be true, was not  very useful. My London pamphlet, which had for its motto these lines  of Dryden:[53]      \"Whatever is, is right. Though purblind man     Sees but a part o' the chain, the nearest link:     His eyes not carrying to the equal beam,     That poises all above;\"    and from the attributes of God, his infinite wisdom, goodness and  power, concluded that nothing could possibly be wrong in the world,  and that vice and virtue were empty distinctions, no such things  existing, appear'd now not so clever a performance as I once thought  it; and I doubted whether some error had not insinuated itself  unperceiv'd into my argument, so as to infect all that follow'd, as is  common in metaphysical reasonings.        [52] The creed of an eighteenth century theological sect      which, while believing in God, refused to credit the      possibility of miracles and to acknowledge the validity      of revelation.        [53] A great English poet, dramatist, and critic      (1631-1700). The lines are inaccurately quoted from      Dryden's OEdipus, Act III, Scene I, line 293.    I grew convinc'd that _truth_, _sincerity_ and _integrity_ in dealings  between man and man were of the utmost importance to the felicity of  life; and I form'd written resolutions, which still remain in my  journal book, to practice them ever while I lived. Revelation had  indeed no weight with me, as such; but I entertain'd an opinion that,  though certain actions might not be bad _because_ they were forbidden  by it, or good _because_ it commanded them, yet probably these actions  might be forbidden _because_ they were bad for us, or commanded  _because_ they were beneficial to us, in their own natures, all the  circumstances of things considered. And this persuasion, with the kind  hand of Providence, or some guardian angel, or accidental favourable  circumstances and situations, or all together, preserved me, thro'  this dangerous time of youth, and the hazardous situations I was  sometimes in among strangers, remote from the eye and advice of my  father, without any willful gross immorality or injustice, that might  have been expected from my want of religion. I say willful, because  the instances I have mentioned had something of _necessity_ in them,  from my youth, inexperience, and the knavery of others. I had  therefore a tolerable character to begin the world with; I valued it  properly, and determin'd to preserve it.    We had not been long return'd to Philadelphia before the new types  arriv'd from London. We settled with Keimer, and left him by his  consent before he heard of it. We found a house to hire near the  market, and took it. To lessen the rent, which was then but  twenty-four pounds a year, tho' I have since known it to let for  seventy, we took in Thomas Godfrey, a glazier, and his family, who  were to pay a considerable part of it to us, and we to board with  them. We had scarce opened our letters and put our press in order,  before George House, an acquaintance of mine, brought a countryman to  us, whom he had met in the street inquiring for a printer. All our  cash was now expended in the variety of particulars we had been  obliged to procure, and this countryman's five shillings, being our  first-fruits, and coming so seasonably, gave me more pleasure than any  crown I have since earned; and the gratitude I felt toward House has  made me often more ready than perhaps I should otherwise have been to  assist young beginners.    There are croakers in every country, always boding its ruin. Such a  one then lived in Philadelphia; a person of note, an elderly man, with  a wise look and a very grave manner of speaking; his name was Samuel  Mickle. This gentleman, a stranger to me, stopt one day at my door,  and asked me if I was the young man who had lately opened a new  printing-house. Being answered in the affirmative, he said he was  sorry for me, because it was an expensive undertaking, and the expense  would be lost; for Philadelphia was a sinking place, the people  already half-bankrupts, or near being so; all appearances to the  contrary, such as new buildings and the rise of rents, being to his  certain knowledge fallacious; for they were, in fact, among the things  that would soon ruin us. And he gave me such a detail of misfortunes  now existing, or that were soon to exist, that he left me half  melancholy. Had I known him before I engaged in this business,  probably I never should have done it. This man continued to live in  this decaying place, and to declaim in the same strain, refusing for  many years to buy a house there, because all was going to  destruction; and at last I had the pleasure of seeing him give five  times as much for one as he might have bought it for when he first  began his croaking.    I should have mentioned before, that, in the autumn of the preceding  year, I had form'd most of my ingenious acquaintance into a club of  mutual improvement, which was called the Junto;[54] we met on Friday  evenings. The rules that I drew up required that every member, in his  turn, should produce one or more queries on any point of Morals,  Politics, or Natural Philosophy, to be discuss'd by the company; and  once in three months produce and read an essay of his own writing, on  any subject he pleased. Our debates were to be under the direction of  a president, and to be conducted in the sincere spirit of inquiry  after truth, without fondness for dispute, or desire of victory; and,  to prevent warmth, all expressions of positiveness in opinions, or  direct contradiction, were after some time made contraband, and  prohibited under small pecuniary penalties.        [54] A Spanish term meaning a combination for political      intrigue; here a club or society.    The first members were Joseph Breintnal, a copyer of deeds for the  scriveners, a good-natur'd, friendly middle-ag'd man, a great lover  of poetry, reading all he could meet with, and writing some that was  tolerable; very ingenious in many little Nicknackeries, and of  sensible conversation.    Thomas Godfrey, a self-taught mathematician, great in his way, and  afterward inventor of what is now called Hadley's Quadrant. But he  knew little out of his way, and was not a pleasing companion; as, like  most great mathematicians I have met with, he expected universal  precision in everything said, or was forever denying or distinguishing  upon trifles, to the disturbance of all conversation. He soon left us.    Nicholas Scull, a surveyor, afterwards surveyor-general, who lov'd  books, and sometimes made a few verses.    William Parsons, bred a shoemaker, but, loving reading, had acquir'd a  considerable share of mathematics, which he first studied with a view  to astrology, that he afterwards laught at it. He also became  surveyor-general.    William Maugridge, a joiner, a most exquisite mechanic, and a solid,  sensible man.    Hugh Meredith, Stephen Potts, and George Webb I have characteriz'd  before.    Robert Grace, a young gentleman of some fortune, generous, lively, and  witty; a lover of punning and of his friends.    And William Coleman, then a merchant's clerk, about my age, who had  the coolest, clearest head, the best heart, and the exactest morals of  almost any man I ever met with. He became afterwards a merchant of  great note, and one of our provincial judges. Our friendship continued  without interruption to his death, upwards of forty years; and the  club continued almost as long, and was the best school of philosophy,  morality, and politics that then existed in the province; for our  queries, which were read the week preceding their discussion, put us  upon reading with attention upon the several subjects, that we might  speak more to the purpose; and here, too, we acquired better habits of  conversation, everything being studied in our rules which might  prevent our disgusting each other. From hence the long continuance of  the club, which I shall have frequent occasion to speak further of  hereafter.    But my giving this account of it here is to show something of the  interest I had, everyone of these exerting themselves in recommending  business to us. Breintnal particularly procur'd us from the Quakers  the printing forty sheets of their history, the rest being to be done  by Keimer; and upon this we work'd exceedingly hard, for the price was  low. It was a folio, pro patria size, in pica, with long primer  notes.[55] I compos'd of it a sheet a day, and Meredith worked it off  at press; it was often eleven at night, and sometimes later, "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/20220"],[0,"The Mind and Its Education (#16)"],[1," seem in a sense to belong to and require each other. For what  would be the meaning or use of the physical world with no mind to know  or use it; and what would be the use of a mind with nothing to be known  or thought about?      1. HOW WE COME TO KNOW THE EXTERNAL WORLD    There is a marvel about our coming to know the external world which we  shall never be able fully to understand. We have come by this knowledge  so gradually and unconsciously that it now appears to us as commonplace,  and we take for granted many things that it would puzzle us to explain.    KNOWLEDGE THROUGH THE SENSES.--For example, we say, \"Of course I see  yonder green tree: it is about ten rods distant.\" But why \"of course\"?  Why should objects at a distance from us and with no evident connection  between us and them be known to us at all merely by turning our eyes in  their direction when there is light? Why not rather say with the blind  son of Professor Puiseaux of Paris, who, when asked if he would like to  be restored to sight, answered: \"If it were not for curiosity I would  rather have long arms. It seems to me that my hands would teach me  better what is passing in the moon than your eyes or telescopes.\"    We listen and then say, \"Yes, that is a certain bell ringing in the  neighboring village,\" as if this were the most simple thing in the  world. But why should one piece of metal striking against another a mile  or two away make us aware that there is a bell there at all, let alone  that it is a certain bell whose tone we recognize? Or we pass our  fingers over a piece of cloth and decide, \"That is silk.\" But why,  merely by placing our skin in contact with a bit of material, should we  be able to know its quality, much less that it is cloth and that its  threads were originally spun by an insect? Or we take a sip of liquid  and say, \"This milk is sour.\" But why should we be able by taking the  liquid into the mouth and bringing it into contact with the mucous  membrane to tell that it is milk, and that it possesses the quality  which we call _sour_? Or, once more, we get a whiff of air through the  open window in the springtime and say, \"There is a lilac bush in bloom  on the lawn.\" Yet why, from inhaling air containing particles of lilac,  should we be able to know that there is anything outside, much less that  it is a flower and of a particular variety which we call lilac? Or,  finally, we hold a heated flatiron up near the cheek and say, \"This is  too hot! it will burn the cloth.\" But why by holding this object a foot  away from the face do we know that it is there, let alone knowing its  temperature?    THE UNITY OF SENSORY EXPERIENCE.--Further, our senses come through  experience to have the power of fusing, or combining their knowledge, so  to speak, by which each expresses its knowledge in terms of the others.  Thus we take a glance out of the window and say that the day looks cold,  although we well know that we cannot see _cold_. Or we say that the  melon sounds green, or the bell sounds cracked, although a _crack_ or  _greenness_ cannot be heard. Or we say that the box feels empty,  although _emptiness_ cannot be felt. We have come to associate cold,  originally experienced with days which look like the one we now see,  with this particular appearance, and so we say we see the cold; sounds  like the one coming from the bell we have come to associate with cracked  bells, and that coming from the melon with green melons, until we say  unhesitatingly that the bell sounds cracked and the melon sounds green.  And so with the various senses. Each gleans from the world its own  particular bit of knowledge, but all are finally in a partnership and  what is each one's knowledge belongs to every other one in so far as the  other can use it.    THE SENSORY PROCESSES TO BE EXPLAINED.--The explanation of the ultimate  nature of knowledge, and how we reach it through contact with our  material environment, we will leave to the philosophers. And battles  enough they have over the question, and still others they will have  before the matter is settled. The easier and more important problem for  us is to describe the _processes_ by which the mind comes to know its  environment, and to see how it uses this knowledge in thinking. This  much we shall be able to do, for it is often possible to describe a  process and discover its laws even when we cannot fully explain its  nature and origin. We know the process of digestion and assimilation,  and the laws which govern them, although we do not understand the  ultimate nature and origin of _life_ which makes these possible.    THE QUALITIES OF OBJECTS EXIST IN THE MIND.--Yet even in the relatively  simple description which we have proposed many puzzles confront us, and  one of them appears at the very outset. This is that the qualities which  we usually ascribe to objects really exist in our own minds and not in  the objects at all. Take, for instance, the common qualities of light  and color. The physicist tells us that what we see as light is  occasioned by an incredibly rapid beating of ether waves on the retina  of the eye. All space is filled with this ether; and when it is  light--that is, when some object like the sun or other light-giving body  is present--the ether is set in motion by the vibrating molecules of the  body which is the source of light, its waves strike the retina, a  current is produced and carried to the brain, and we see light. This  means, then, that space, the medium in which we see objects, is not  filled with light (the sensation), but with very rapid waves of ether,  and that the light which we see really occurs in our own minds as the  mental response to the physical stimulus of ether waves. Likewise with  color. Color is produced by ether waves of different lengths and degrees  of rapidity.    Thus ether waves at the rate of 450 billions a second give us the  sensation of red; of 472 billions a second, orange; of 526 billions a  second, yellow; of 589 billions a second, green; of 640 billions a  second, blue; of 722 billions a second, indigo; of 790 billions a  second, violet. What exists outside of us, then, is these ether waves of  different rates, and not the colors (as sensations) themselves. The  beautiful yellow and crimson of a sunset, the variegated colors of a  landscape, the delicate pink in the cheek of a child, the blush of a  rose, the shimmering green of the lake--these reside not in the objects  themselves, but in the consciousness of the one who sees them. The  objects possess but the quality of reflecting back to the eye ether  waves of the particular rate corresponding to the color which we ascribe  to them. Thus \"red\" objects, and no others, reflect back ether waves of  a rate of 450 billions a second: \"white\" objects reflect all rates;  \"black\" objects reflect none.    The case is no different with regard to sound. When we speak of a sound  coming from a bell, what we really mean is that the vibrations of the  bell have set up waves in the air between it and our ear, which have  produced corresponding vibrations in the ear; that a nerve current was  thereby produced; and that a sound was heard. But the sound (i.e.,  sensation) is a mental thing, and exists only in our own consciousness.  What passed between the sounding object and ourselves was waves in the  intervening air, ready to be translated through the machinery of nerves  and brain into the beautiful tones and melodies and harmonies of the  mind. And so with all other sensations.    THE THREE SETS OF FACTORS.--What exists outside of us therefore is a  _stimulus_, some form of physical energy, of a kind suitable to excite  to activity a certain end-organ of taste, or touch, or smell, or sight,  or hearing; what exists within us is the _nervous machinery_ capable of  converting this stimulus into a nerve current which shall produce an  activity in the cortex of the brain; what results is the _mental object_  which we call a _sensation_ of taste, smell, touch, sight, or hearing.      2. THE NATURE OF SENSATION    SENSATION GIVES US OUR WORLD OF QUALITIES.--In actual experience  sensations are never known apart from the objects to which they belong.  This is to say that when we see _yellow_ or _red_ it is always in  connection with some surface, or object; when we taste _sour_, this  quality belongs to some substance, and so on with all the senses. Yet by  sensation we mean only _the simple qualities of objects known in  consciousness as the result of appropriate stimuli applied to  end-organs_. We shall later see how by perception these qualities fuse  or combine to form objects, but in the present chapter we shall be  concerned with the qualities only. Sensations are, then, the simplest  and most elementary knowledge we may get from the physical world,--the  red, the blue, the bitter, the cold, the fragrant, and whatever other  qualities may belong to the external world. We shall not for the present  be concerned with the objects or sources from which the qualities may  come.    To quote James on the meaning of sensation: \"All we can say on this  point is that _what we mean by sensations are first things in the way of  consciousness_. They are the _immediate_ results upon consciousness of  nerve currents as they enter the brain, and before they have awakened  any suggestions or associations with past experience. But it is obvious  that _such immediate sensations can be realized only in the earliest  days of life_.\"    THE ATTRIBUTES OF SENSATION.--Sensations differ from each other in at  least four respects; namely, _quality_, _intensity_, _extensity_, and  _duration_.    It is a difference in _quality_ that makes us say, \"This paper is red,  and that, blue; this liquid is sweet, and that, sour.\" Differences in  quality are therefore fundamental differences in _kind_. Besides the  quality-differences that exist within the same general field, as of  taste or vision, it is"]]]
