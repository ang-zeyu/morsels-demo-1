Here was evidently work for the British Cabinet during the next  session of parliament, and we proceed to show how they acted.          EMBARRASSMENT OF MINISTERS AND MEETING OF PARLIAMENT.    During the recess, ministers, who were divided in opinion and thwarted  by the king, could do nothing. It would not appear, indeed, that the  subject was considered of such vital importance as to demand instant  attention and extraordinary exertions. Parliament met on the 17th of  December, but it was only to be prorogued for the Christmas holidays,  and the king merely mentioned in his speech, that something had occurred  in America which would demand the attention of the legislature. In the  meantime a meeting was held at Rockingham-house, for the purpose of  arranging measures against the opening of the session, and particularly  with respect to America. Yet no vigorous measures were resolved on, and  all which they did decide upon was merely the terms in which the king's  speech should be comprised when parliament reassembled.    {A.D. 1766}    Parliament reassembled on the 14th of January, when his majesty spoke  more at length on the subject of the American colonies, and said that  the papers were ordered to be laid before them. The subject was pointed  out to the members as the principal object of their deliberation, and it  was left to their wisdom, in full confidence the judgment and moderation  of the two houses would conciliate the colonists without compromising  the rights of the British legislature. Everything had been done, his  majesty said, by the governors, and the commanders of the forces in  America, for the suppression of riot and tumult, and the effectual  support of lawful authority--they had failed, and the rest was left to  them.    His majesty's speech was followed by the presentation of the petitions  from America, and of numerous petitions from the great manufacturing  towns of the kingdom, which set forth the present ruin of all classes,  with the prospective derangement of the national finances; all which  seemed to declare that the time was arrived when effectual measures  should be taken for their redemption. Then succeeded the debate. It was  opened in the commons by Mr. Nugent, who condemned the opposition made  by the colonists, to what he deemed a reasonable and easy tax, yet  expressed his willingness to abandon it, provided they would solicit its  repeal as a boon, and acknowledge the right of the British legislature  to impose it: with him \"a peppercorn as an acknowledgment of a right was  of more value than millions without such a concession.\" Burke followed;  but nothing more is known of his first speech in parliament than that he  astonished the house by the force and fancy of his eloquence, and that  he gained by it the golden opinion of Pitt. That more experienced  orator next spoke, and his sentiments were more to the purpose. After  condemning the daring measures adopted by the late administration, and  blaming the indecision and tardy efforts of their successors, against  whom, as men, he had nothing to allege, as they were men of fair  characters, and such as he rejoiced to see in his majesty's service,  bowing with grace and dignity to them, he observed--\"Pardon me,  gentlemen, but confidence is a plant of slow growth in an aged bosom;  youth is the season of credulity. By comparing events with each other,  and reasoning from effects to causes, methinks I plainly discover an  overruling influence. I have had the honour to serve the crown, and if I  could have submitted to influence, I might have continued to serve, but  I would not be responsible for others. I have no local attachments:  it is indifferent to me whether a man was rocked in his cradle on this  side, or the other side of the Tweed. I sought for merit wherever it was  to be found. It is my boast that I was the first minister who looked for  it, and found it in the mountains of the north. I called it forth, and  drew into your service a hardy and intrepid race of men!--men who, when  left to your jealousy, became a prey to the artifices of your enemies,  and had gone nigh to overturn the state in the war before the last.  These men, in the last war, were brought to combat on your side; they  served with fidelity as they fought with valour, and conquered for you  in every part of the world. Detested be the national reflections against  them!--they are unjust, groundless, illiberal, unmanly. When I ceased  to serve his majesty as a minister, it was not the country of the man by  which I was moved; but the man of that country wanted wisdom, and held  principles incompatible with freedom.\"    The great orator proceeded to observe, that when the resolution of  taxing America was first taken he was ill in bed, and if he could have  been brought to the floor of that house, he would have given his firm  testimony against the measure. He then expressed a hope that the members  of the British legislature would not consider it a point of honour, or  themselves bound to persevere in carrying out what they had begun.  His opinion was, that Great Britain had no right to lay a tax on the  American colonies; but at the same time he uttered this seemingly  contradictory opinion--that her authority over them was sovereign in  all cases of legislation. He said--\"The colonists are subjects of this  kingdom, equally entitled with yourselves to all the natural advantages  of mankind, and the peculiar privileges of Englishmen: equally bound by  its laws, and equally participating in its free constitution. Taxation  is no part of the legislative power. Taxes are the voluntary gift and  grant of the commons alone. In legislation, the three estates of the  realm are alike concerned; but the concurrence of the peers and the  crown to a tax is only necessary to clothe it with the form of a law.  The gift and grant is of the commons alone.\" Having shown in what way  the great bulk of the land had passed into the hands of the commons, he  remarked--\"When, therefore, in this house, we give and grant, we give  and grant what is our own. But in an American tax what do we do?  We, your majesty's commons of Great Britain, give and grant to your  majesty--what? our own property?--No; we give and grant the property  of your majesty's commons of America! It is an absurdity in terms. The  distinction between legislation and taxation is essentially necessary to  liberty. The crown, the peers, are equally legislative powers with the  commons. If taxation be a part of simple legislation, the crown and the  peers have rights to taxation as well as yourselves--rights which they  will claim, which they will exercise, whenever the principle can be  supported by power.\" Pitt then proceeded to combat the arguments  of those who asserted that America was represented in the British  parliament. \"I would fain know,\" said he, \"by whom an American is  represented here. Is he represented by any knight of the shire, in any  county in this kingdom? Or will you tell him that he is represented  by any representative of a borough--a borough which perhaps its own  representatives never saw? This is what is called the rotten part of the  constitution. It cannot last a century: if it does not drop, it must be  amputated.\" Pitt concluded by reasserting, that the commons of America,  represented in their assemblies, had ever been in possession of the  constitutional right of granting their own money; and this kingdom had  ever been in the possession of the rights of binding the colonies by her  laws, and by her regulations and restrictions in trade, navigation,  and manufactures, and in fact in everything, except taking money out of  their pockets without their free and full consent.    The house was awed by Pitt's oratory, and, for some time, no one rose to  reply. General Conway at length broke the silence by frankly declaring  that his sentiments were generally conformable to those of Pitt; and by  excusing ministers for their tardy notice of the subject, on the grounds  that the first news of the troubles were vague and imperfect. In denying  the continued ascendency of Bute, however, the general spoke with great  warmth, utterly disclaiming it for himself, and, as far as he could  discern, for all the members of the cabinet. Grenville, who followed,  did not treat Pitt with such urbanity. He defended himself and his  measures with great warmth and ability, and boldly declared that the  seditious spirit of the colonies owed its birth to the factions in the  house of commons, and that gentlemen were careless of the consequences  of what they uttered, provided it answered the purposes of opposition.  As he ceased speaking, several members rose together; but Pitt was among  them, and a loud cry was made for him, so that the rest gave way, and  left him to answer the attack. Taking no notice of the denial which  Conway gave to his charge concerning Bute's holding paramount influence  in the cabinet, which denial he could not with justice gainsay, he  confined his remarks to Grenville's arguments and grave charge. Since,  he said, that member had gone into the justice, policy, and expediency  of the Stamp Act, he would follow him through the whole field, and  combat all his arguments. He bitterly complained that Grenville should  have designated the liberty of speech in that house as a crime; but  declared that the imputation should not prevent him from uttering his  sentiments upon the subject. He then proceeded thus:--\"The gentleman  tells us America is obstinate--America is almost in open rebellion. I  rejoice that America has resisted. Three millions of people, so dead to  all the feelings of liberty as voluntary to submit to be slaves, would  have been fit instruments to make slaves"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/19237"],[0,"The Secret of Divine Civilization (#16)"],[1,"gain important benefits from it, then he should certainly pursue it  with all his heart. If not, if it consists in empty, profitless debates  and in a vain concatenation of imaginings that lead to no result except  acrimony, why devote one's life to such useless hairsplittings and  disputes.    Because this matter requires further elucidation and a thorough hearing,  so that it can be fully established that some of the subjects which today  are neglected are extremely valuable, while the nation has no need  whatever of various other, superfluous studies, the point will, God  willing, be developed in a second volume. Our hope is that a reading of  this first volume will produce fundamental changes in the thinking and the  behavior of society, for We have undertaken the work with a sincere intent  and purely for the sake of God. Although in this world individuals who are  able to distinguish between sincere intentions and false words are as rare  as the philosopher's stone, yet We fix Our hopes on the measureless  bounties of the Lord.    To resume: As for that group who maintains that in effecting these  necessary reforms we must proceed with deliberation, exercise patience and  gain the objectives one at a time, just what do they mean by this? If by  deliberation they are referring to that circumspection which the science  of government requires, their thought is timely and appropriate. It is  certain that momentous undertakings cannot be brought to a successful  conclusion in haste; that in such cases haste would only make waste.    The world of politics is like the world of man; he is seed at first, and  then passes by degrees to the condition of embryo and foetus, acquiring a  bone structure, being clothed with flesh, taking on his own special form,  until at last he reaches the plane where he can befittingly fulfill the  words: \"the most excellent of Makers.\"(71) Just as this is a requirement  of creation and is based on the universal Wisdom, the political world in  the same way cannot instantaneously evolve from the nadir of defectiveness  to the zenith of rightness and perfection. Rather, qualified individuals  must strive by day and by night, using all those means which will conduce  to progress, until the government and the people develop along every line  from day to day and even from moment to moment.    When, through the Divine bestowals, three things appear on earth, this  world of dust will come alive, and stand forth wondrously adorned and full  of grace. These are first, the fruitful winds of spring; second, the  welling plenty of spring clouds; and third, the heat of the bright sun.  When, out of the endless bounty of God, these three have been vouchsafed,  then slowly, by His leave, dry trees and branches turn fresh and green  again, and array themselves with many kinds of blossoms and fruits. It is  the same when the pure intentions and the justice of the ruler, the wisdom  and consummate skill and statecraft of the governing authorities, and the  determination and unstinted efforts of the people, are all combined; then  day by day the effects of the advancement, of the far-reaching reforms, of  the pride and prosperity of government and people alike, will become  clearly manifest.    If, however, by delay and postponement they mean this, that in each  generation only one minute section of the necessary reforms should be  attended to, this is nothing but lethargy and inertia, and no results  would be forthcoming from such a procedure, except the endless repetition  of idle words. If haste is harmful, inertness and indolence are a thousand  times worse. A middle course is best, as it is written: \"It is incumbent  upon you to do good between the two evils,\" this referring to the mean  between the two extremes. \"And let not thy hand be tied up to thy neck;  nor yet open it with all openness ... but between these follow a middle  way.\"(72)    The primary, the most urgent requirement is the promotion of education. It  is inconceivable that any nation should achieve prosperity and success  unless this paramount, this fundamental concern is carried forward. The  principal reason for the decline and fall of peoples is ignorance. Today  the mass of the people are uninformed even as to ordinary affairs, how  much less do they grasp the core of the important problems and complex  needs of the time.    It is therefore urgent that beneficial articles and books be written,  clearly and definitely establishing what the present-day requirements of  the people are, and what will conduce to the happiness and advancement of  society. These should be published and spread throughout the nation, so  that at least the leaders among the people should become, to some degree,  awakened, and arise to exert themselves along those lines which will lead  to their abiding honor. The publication of high thoughts is the dynamic  power in the arteries of life; it is the very soul of the world. Thoughts  are a boundless sea, and the effects and varying conditions of existence  are as the separate forms and individual limits of the waves; not until  the sea boils up will the waves rise and scatter their pearls of knowledge  on the shore of life.    Thou, Brother, art thy thought alone,  The rest is only thew and bone.(73)    Public opinion must be directed toward whatever is worthy of this day, and  this is impossible except through the use of adequate arguments and the  adducing of clear, comprehensive and conclusive proofs. For the helpless  masses know nothing of the world, and while there is no doubt that they  seek and long for their own happiness, yet ignorance like a heavy veil  shuts them away from it.    Observe to what a degree the lack of education will weaken and degrade a  people. Today [1875] from the standpoint of population the greatest nation  in the world is China, which has something over four hundred million  inhabitants. On this account, its government should be the most  distinguished on earth, its people the most acclaimed. And yet on the  contrary, because of its lack of education in cultural and material  civilization, it is the feeblest and the most helpless of all weak  nations. Not long ago, a small contingent of English and French troops  went to war with China and defeated that country so decisively that they  took over its capital Peking. Had the Chinese government and people been  abreast of the advanced sciences of the day, had they been skilled in the  arts of civilization, then if all the nations on earth had marched against  them the attack would still have failed, and the attackers would have  returned defeated whence they had come.    Stranger even than this episode is the fact that the government of Japan  was in the beginning subject to and under the protection of China, and  that now for some years, Japan has opened its eyes and adopted the  techniques of contemporary progress and civilization, promoting sciences  and industries of use to the public, and striving to the utmost of their  power and competence until public opinion was focused on reform. This  government has currently advanced to such a point that, although its  population is only one-sixth, or even one-tenth, that of China, it has  recently challenged the latter government, and China has finally been  forced to come to terms. Observe carefully how education and the arts of  civilization bring honor, prosperity, independence and freedom to a  government and its people.    It is, furthermore, a vital necessity to establish schools throughout  Persia, even in the smallest country towns and villages, and to encourage  the people in every possible way to have their children learn to read and  write. If necessary, education should even be made compulsory. Until the  nerves and arteries of the nation stir into life, every measure that is  attempted will prove vain; for the people are as the human body, and  determination and the will to struggle are as the soul, and a soulless  body does not move. This dynamic power is present to a superlative degree  in the very nature of the Persian people, and the spread of education will  release it.    As to that element who believe that it is neither necessary nor  appropriate to borrow the principles of civilization, the fundamentals of  progress toward high levels of social happiness in the material world, the  laws which effect thorough reforms, the methods which extend the scope of  culture--and that it is far more suitable that Persia and the Persians  reflect over the situation and then create their own techniques of  progress.    It is certain that if the vigorous intelligence and superior skill of the  nation's great, and the energy and resolve of the most eminent men at the  imperial court, and the determined efforts of those who have knowledge and  capacity, and are well versed in the great laws of political life, should  all be combined, and all should exert every effort and examine and reflect  over every detail as well as on the main currents of affairs, there is  every likelihood that because of the effective plans they would evolve,  some situations would be thoroughly reformed. In the majority of cases,  however, they would still be obliged to borrow; because, throughout the  many-centuried past, hundreds of thousands of persons have devoted their  entire lives to putting these things to the test until they were able to  bring about these substantial developments. If all that is to be ignored  and an effort is made to re-create those agencies in our own country and  in our own way, and thus effect the hoped-for advancement, many  generations would pass by and still the goal would not be reached. Observe  for instance that in other countries they persevered over a long period  until finally they discovered the power of steam and by means of it were  enabled easily to perform the heavy tasks which were once beyond human  strength. How many centuries it would take if we were "]]]
