I teach all my pupils thus. But since most of them consider it  something unheard of to be forced to pronounce in this way, they very  rarely bring it to the artistic perfection which alone can make it  effective. Except from Betz, I have never heard it from any one. After  me no one will teach it any more. I shall probably be the last one. A  pity!          SECTION XXXI    PRACTICAL EXERCISES      The practical study of singing is best begun with single sustained  tones, and with preparation on the sound of _ah_ alone, mingled with  _o_ and _oo_. A position as if one were about to yawn helps the tongue  to lie in the right place.    In order not to weary young voices too much, it is best to begin in  the middle range, going upward first, by semitones, and then, starting  again with the same tone, going downward. All other exercises begin in  the lower range and go upward.    The pupil must first be able to make a single tone good, and judge it  correctly, before he should be allowed to proceed to a second. Later,  single syllables or words can be used as exercises for this.    The position of the mouth and tongue must be watched in the mirror.  The vowel _ah_ must be mingled with _o_ and _oo_, and care must be  taken that the breath is forced strongly against the chest, and felt  attacking here and on the palate at the same time. Begin _piano_, make  a long _crescendo_, and gradually return and end on a well-controlled  _piano_. My feeling at the attack is as shown in the plate.    At the same instant that I force the breath against the chest, I place  the tone _under_ its highest point on the palate, and let the  overtones soar above the palate--the two united in one thought. Only  in the lowest range can the overtones, and in the highest range the  undertones (resonance of the head cavities and of the palate), be  dispensed with.    With me the throat never comes into consideration; I feel absolutely  nothing of it, at most only the breath gently streaming through it. A  tone should never be forced; _never press_ the breath against the  resonating chambers, but only against the chest; and NEVER hold it  back. The organs should not be cramped, but should be allowed to  perform their functions elastically.    The contraction of the muscles should never exceed their power to  relax. A tone must always be sung, whether strong or soft, with an  easy, conscious power. Further, before all things, sing always with  due regard to the pitch.    In this way the control of the ear is exercised over the pitch,  strength, and duration of the tone, and over the singer's strength and  weakness, of which we are often forced to make a virtue. In short, one  learns to recognize and to produce a perfect tone.    [Illustration:    Attack.    Red lines denote that with the inspiration of breath: I, the diaphragm  is sensibly stretched backward; II, enlarges the capacity of the chest  by the drawing down of its floor; III, and so forms the supply chamber  for the breath; IV, indicates the pressure of the breath against the  chest tension muscles; V, the attack.]    In all exercises go as low and as high as the voice will allow without  straining, and always make little pauses to rest between them, even if  you are not tired, in order to be all the fresher for the next one.  With a certain amount of skill and steady purpose the voice increases  its compass, and takes the proper range, easiest to it by nature.  The pupil can see then how greatly the compass of a voice can be  extended. For amateurs it is not necessary; but it is for every one  who practises the profession of a singer in public.    For a second exercise, sing connectedly two half-tones, slowly, on one  or two vowels, bridging them with the auxiliary vowels and the _y_ as  the support of the tongue, etc.    Every tone must seek its best results from all the organs concerned in  its production; must possess power, brilliancy, and mellowness in  order to be able to produce, before leaving each tone, the propagation  form for the next tone, ascending as well as descending, and make it  certain.    No exercise should be dropped till every vibration of every tone has  clearly approved itself to the ear, not only of the teacher, but also  of the pupil, as _perfect_.    It takes a long time to reach the full consciousness of a tone. After  it has passed the lips it must be diffused outside, before it can  come to the consciousness of the listener as well as to that of the  singer himself. So practise _singing_ slowly and _hearing_ slowly.          SECTION XXXII    THE GREAT SCALE      This is the most necessary exercise for all kinds of voices. It was  taught to my mother; she taught it to all her pupils and to us. But  _I_ am probably the only one of them all who practises it faithfully!  I do not trust the others. As a pupil one must practise it twice a  day, as a professional singer at least once.    [Music illustration]    The breath must be well prepared, the expiration still better, for the  duration of these five and four long tones is greater than would be  supposed. The first tone must be attacked not too _piano_, and sung  only so strongly as is necessary to reach the next one easily without  further crescendo, while the propagation form for the next tone is  produced, and the breath wisely husbanded till the end of the phrase.    The first of each of the phrases ends nasally in the middle range, the  second toward the forehead and the cavities of the head. The lowest  tone must already be prepared to favor the resonance of the head  cavities, by thinking of _[=a]_, consequently placing the larynx high  and maintaining the resonating organs in a _very_ supple and elastic  state. In the middle range, _ah_ is mingled particularly with _oo_,  that the nose may be reached; further, the auxiliary vowel _e_ is  added to it, which guides the tone to the head cavities. In descending  the attack must be more concentrated, as the tone is slowly directed  toward the nose on _oo_ or _o_, to the end of the figure.    When _oo_, _a_, and _e_ are auxiliary vowels, they need not be plainly  pronounced. (They form an exception in the diphthongs, \"Trauuum,\"  \"Leiiid,\" \"Lauuune,\" \"Feuyer,\" etc.) As auxiliary vowels they are only  means to an end, a bridge, a connection from one thing to another.  They can be taken anywhere with any other sound; and thence it may be  seen how elastic the organs can be when they are skilfully managed.    The chief object of the great scale is to secure the pliant, sustained  use of the breath, precision in the preparation of the propagation  form, the proper mixture of the vowels which aid in placing the organs  in the right position for the tone, to be changed for every different  tone, although imperceptibly; further, the intelligent use of the  resonance of the palate and head cavities, especially the latter,  whose tones, soaring above everything else, form the connection with  the nasal quality for the whole scale.    The scale must be practised without too strenuous exertion, but not  without power, gradually extending over the entire compass of the  voice; and that is, if it is to be perfect, over a compass of two  octaves. These two octaves will have been covered, when, advancing the  starting-point by semitones, the scale has been carried up through an  entire octave. So much every voice can finally accomplish, even if the  high notes must be very feeble.    The great scale, properly elaborated in practice, accomplishes  wonders: it equalizes the voice, makes it flexible and noble, gives  strength to all weak places, operates to repair all faults and breaks  that exist, and controls the voice to the very heart. Nothing escapes  it.    By it ability as well as inability is brought to light--something that  is extremely unpleasant to those without ability. In my opinion it is  the ideal exercise, but the most difficult one I know. By devoting  forty minutes to it every day, a consciousness of certainty and  strength will be gained that ten hours a day of any other exercise  cannot give.    This should be the chief test in all conservatories. If I were at the  head of one, the pupils should be allowed for the first three years to  sing at the examinations only _difficult_ exercises, like this great  scale, before they should be allowed to think of singing a song or an  aria, which I regard only as cloaks for incompetency.    For teaching me this scale--this guardian angel of the voice--I cannot  be thankful enough to my mother. In earlier years I used to like to  express myself freely about it. There was a time when I imagined that  it strained me. My mother often ended her warnings at my neglect of it  with the words, \"You will be very sorry for it!\" And I was very sorry  for it. At one time, when I was about to be subjected to great  exertions, and did not practise it every day, but thought it was  enough to sing coloratura fireworks, I soon became aware that my  transition tones would no longer endure the strain, began easily to  waver, or threatened even to become too flat. The realization of it  was terrible! It cost me many, many years of the hardest and most  careful study; and it finally brought me to realize the necessity of  exercising the vocal organs continually, and in the proper way, if I  wished always to be able to rely on them.    Practice, and especially the practice of the great, slow scale, is the  only cure for all injuries, and at the same time the most excellent  means of fortification against all over-exertion. I sing it every day,  often twice, even if I have to sing one of the greatest roles in the  evening. I can rely absolutely on its assistance.    If I had imparted nothing else to my pupils but the ability to sing  this one great exercise well, they would possess a capital fund of  knowledge which must"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/19138"],[0,"Resonance in Singing and Speaking (#16)"],[1,", 29.
