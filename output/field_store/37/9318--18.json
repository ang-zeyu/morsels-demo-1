[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/19098"],[0,"Christmas in Ritual and Tradition, Christian and Pagan (#16)"],[1," is represented not by living actors but in plastic art, often most simple  and homely.    The use of the \"crib\" (French _creche_, Italian _presepio_, German  _krippe_) at Christmas is now universally diffused in the Roman Church.  Most readers of this book must have seen one of these structures  representing the stable at Bethlehem, with the Child in the manger, His  mother and St. Joseph, the ox and the ass, and perhaps the shepherds, the  three kings, or worshipping angels. They are the delight of children, who  through the season of Christmas and Epiphany wander into the open  churches at all times of day to gaze wide-eyed on the life-like scene and  offer a prayer to their Little Brother. No one with anything of the  child-spirit can fail to be touched by the charm of the Christmas crib.  Faults of artistic taste there may often be, but these are wont to be  softened down by the flicker of tapers, the glow of ruby lights, amidst  the shades of some dim aisle or chapel, and the scene of tender humanity,  gently, mysteriously radiant, as though with \"bright shoots of  everlastingness,\" is full of religious and poetic suggestions.    The institution of the _presepio_ is often ascribed to St. Francis of  Assisi, who in the year 1224 celebrated Christmas at Greccio |106| with  a Bethlehem scene with a real ox and ass. About fifteen days before the  Nativity, according to Thomas of Celano, the blessed Francis sent for a  certain nobleman, John by name, and said to him: \"If thou wilt that we  celebrate the present festival of the Lord at Greccio, make haste to go  before and diligently prepare what I tell thee. For I would fain make  memorial of that Child who was born in Bethlehem, and in some sort behold  with bodily eyes His infant hardships; how He lay in a manger on the hay,  with the ox and the ass standing by.\" The good man prepared all that the  Saint had commanded, and at last the day of gladness drew nigh. The  brethren were called from many convents; the men and women of the town  prepared tapers and torches to illuminate the night. Finding all things  ready, Francis beheld and rejoiced: the manger had been prepared, the hay  was brought, and the ox and ass were led in. \"Thus Simplicity was  honoured, Poverty exalted, Humility commended, and of Greccio there was  made as it were a new Bethlehem. The night was lit up as the day, and was  delightsome to men and beasts.... The woodland rang with voices, the  rocks made answer to the jubilant throng.\" Francis stood before the  manger, \"overcome with tenderness and filled with wondrous joy\"; Mass was  celebrated, and he, in deacon's vestments, chanted the Holy Gospel in an  \"earnest, sweet, and loud-sounding voice.\" Then he preached to the people  of \"the birth of the poor King and the little town of Bethlehem.\"  \"Uttering the word 'Bethlehem' in the manner of a sheep bleating, he  filled his mouth with the sound,\" and in naming the Child Jesus \"he  would, as it were, lick his lips, relishing with happy palate and  swallowing the sweetness of that word.\" At length, the solemn vigil  ended, each one returned with joy to his own place.{38}    It has been suggested by Countess Martinengo{39} that this beautiful  ceremony was \"the crystallization of haunting memories carried away by  St. Francis from the real Bethlehem\"; for he visited the east in 1219-20,  and the Greccio celebration took place in 1224. St. Francis and his  followers may well have helped greatly to popularize the use of the  _presepio_, but it can be |107| traced back far earlier than their  time. In the liturgical drama known as the \"Officium Pastorum,\" which  probably took shape in the eleventh century, we find a _praesepe_ behind  the altar as the centre of the action{40}; but long before this  something of the kind seems to have been in existence in the church of  Santa Maria Maggiore in Rome--at one time called \"Beata Maria ad  praesepe.\" Here Pope Gregory III. (731-41) placed \"a golden image of the  Mother of God embracing God our Saviour, in various gems.\"{41} According  to Usener's views this church was founded by Pope Liberius (352-66), and  was intended to provide a special home for the new festival of Christmas  introduced by him, while an important part of the early Christmas ritual  there was the celebration of Mass over a \"manger\" in which the  consecrated Host was laid, as once the body of the Holy Child in the crib  at Bethlehem.{42} Further, an eastern homily of the late fourth century  suggests that the preacher had before his eyes a representation of the  Nativity. Such material representations, Usener conjectures, may have  arisen from the devotions of the faithful at the supposed actual  birthplace at Bethlehem, which would naturally be adorned with the sacred  figures of the Holy Night.{43}    In the fourteenth and fifteenth centuries the crib can be traced at  Milan, Parma, and Modena, and an Italian example carved in 1478 still  exists.{44} The Bavarian National Museum at Munich has a fine collection  of cribs of various periods and from various lands--Germany, Tyrol,  Italy, and Sicily--showing what elaborate care has been bestowed upon the  preparation of these models. Among them is a great erection made at  Botzen in the first half of the nineteenth century, and large enough to  fill a fair-sized room. It represents the central square of a town, with  imposing buildings, including a great cathedral not unlike our St.  Paul's. Figures of various sizes were provided to suit the perspective,  and the crib itself was probably set up in the porch of the church, while  processions of puppets were arranged on the wide open square. Another,  made in Munich, shows the adoration of the shepherds in a sort of ruined  castle, while others, from Naples, lay the scene among remains of  classical temples. One Tyrolese crib has a wide landscape background with  a |108| village and mountains typical of the country. The figures are  often numerous, and, as their makers generally dressed them in the  costume of their contemporaries, are sometimes exceedingly quaint. An  angel with a wasp-waist, in a powdered wig, a hat trimmed with big  feathers, and a red velvet dress with heavy gold embroidery, seems comic  to us moderns, yet this is how the Ursuline nuns of Innsbruck conceived  the heavenly messenger. Many of the cribs and figures, however, are of  fine artistic quality, especially those from Naples and Sicily, and to  the student of costume the various types of dress are of great  interest.{45}    The use of the Christmas crib is by no means confined to churches; it is  common in the home in many Catholic regions, and in at least one  Protestant district, the Saxon Erzgebirge.{46} In Germany the _krippe_  is often combined with the Christmas-tree; at Treves, for instance, the  present writer saw a magnificent tree covered with glittering lights and  ornaments, and underneath it the cave of the Nativity with little figures  of the holy persons. Thus have pagan and Christian symbols met together.           *       *       *       *       *    There grew up in Germany, about the fourteenth century, the extremely  popular Christmas custom of \"cradle-rocking,\" a response to the people's  need of a life-like and homely presentation of Christianity. By the  _Kindelwiegen_ the lay-folk were brought into most intimate touch with  the Christ Child; the crib became a cradle (_wiege_) that could be  rocked, and the worshippers were thus able to express in physical action  their devotion to the new-born Babe. The cradle-rocking seems to have  been done at first by priests, who impersonated the Virgin and St.  Joseph, and sang over the Child a duet:--       \"Joseph, lieber neve min,      Hilf mir wiegen daz kindelin.        Gerne, liebe muome min,      Hilf ich dir wiegen din kindelin.\"[37]    [Illustration:    A NEAPOLITAN \"PRESEPIO.\"    _Photo_] [_Meisenbach, Riffarth & Co., Munich_.]    |109| The choir and people took their part in the singing; and dancing,  to the old Germans a natural accompaniment of festive song, became common  around the cradle, which in time the people were allowed to rock with  their own hands.{47} \"In dulci jubilo\" has the character of a dance, and  the same is true of another delightful old carol, \"Lasst uns das Kindlein  wiegen,\" still used, in a form modified by later editors, in the churches  of the Rhineland. The present writer has heard it sung, very slowly, in  unison, by vast congregations, and very beautiful is its mingling of  solemnity, festive joy, and tender sentiment:--    [Illustration: Music]       \"Lasst uns das Kindlein wiegen,      Das Herz zum Krippelein biegen!      Lasst uns den Geist erfreuen,      Das Kindlein benedeien:      O Jesulein suess! O Jesulein suess!           *       *       *       *       *        Lasst uns sein Haendel und Fuesse,      Sein feuriges Herzlein gruessen!      Und ihn demuetiglich eren      Als unsern Gott und Herren!      O Jesulein suess! O Jesulein suess!\"[38]{48}    Two Latin hymns, \"Resonet in laudibus\" and \"Quem pastores  laudavere,\"{49} were also sung at the _Kindelwiegen_, and |110| a  charming and quite untranslatable German lullaby has come down to us:--       \"Sausa ninne, gottes minne,      Nu sweig und ru!      Wen du wilt, so wellen wir deinen willen tun,      Hochgelobter edler furst, nu schweig und wein auch nicht,      Tuste das, so wiss wir, dass uns wol geschicht.\"{50}    It was by appeals like this _Kindelwiegen_ to the natural, homely  instincts of the folk that the Church gained a real hold over the masses,  making Christianity during the fifteenth, sixteenth, and seventeenth  centuries a genuinely popular religion in Germany. Dr. Alexander Tille,  the best historian of the German Christmas, has an interesting passage on  the subject: \"In the dancing and jubilation around the cradle,\" he  writes, \"the religion of the Cross, however much it might in its inmost  character be opposed to the"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/19103"],[0,"The Discovery of a World in the Moone (#16)"],[1,"that move round about him.    But it may seeme a very difficult thing to conceive, how so grosse and  darke a body as our earth, should yeeld such cleare light as proceedes  from the Moone, and therefore the Cardinall _de Cusa_[1] (who thinkes  every Starre to be a severall world) is of opinion that the light of the  Sunne is not able to make them appeare so bright, but the reason of  their shining is, because wee behold them at a great distance through  their regions of fire which doe set a shining lustre upon those bodies  that of themselves are darke.      _Vnde si quis esset extra regionem ignis, terra ista in    circumferentia suae regionis per medium ignis lucida stella    appareret._      \"So that if man were beyond the region of fire, this earth would    appear through that as a bright Starre.\"    But if this were the onely reason then would the Moone bee freed from  such increases and decreases as shee is now lyable unto.      [Sidenote 1: _De doct. ig. l. 2. c. 12._]    _Keplar_ thinkes that our earth receives that light whereby it shines  from the Sunne, but this (saith he) is not such an intended cleare  brightnesse as the Moone is capable of, and therefore hee guesses, that  the earth there is of a more chokie soyle like the Ile of _Creete_, and  so is better able to reflect a stronger light, whereas our earth must  supply this intention with the quantity of its body, but this I conceive  to be a needlesse conjecture, since our earth if all things were well  considered, will be found able enough to reflect as great a light. For    1. Consider its opacity, if you marke these sublunary things, you shall  perceive that amongst them, those that are most perspicuous, are not so  well able to reverberate the Sunne beames as the thicker bodies. The  rayes passe singly through a diaphanous matter, but in an opacous  substance they are doubled in their returne and multiplyed by reflexion.  Now if the moone and the other Planets can shine so clearely by beating  backe the Sunne beames, why may not the earth also shine as well, which  agrees with them in the cause of this brightnesse their opacity?    2. Consider what a cleare light wee may discerne reflected from the  earth in the middest of Summer, and withall conceive how much greater  that must bee which is under the line, where the rayes are more directly  and strongly reverberated.    3. Consider the great distance at which wee behold the Planets, for this  must needs adde much to their shining and therefore _Cusanus_ (in the  above cited place) thinkes that if a man were in the Sunne, that Planet  would not appeare so bright to him, as now it doth to us, because then  his eye could discerne but little, whereas here wee may comprehend the  beames as they are contracted in a narrow body. _Keplar_ beholding the  earth from a high mountaine when it was enlightned by the Sunne  confesses that it appeared unto him of an incredible brightnesse,  whereas then the reflected rayes entered into his sight obliquely; but  how much brighter would it have appeared if hee might in a direct line  behold the whole globe of earth and these rayes gathered together? So  that if wee consider that great light which the earth receives from the  Sunne in the Summer, and then suppose wee were in the Moone, where wee  might see the whole earth hanging in those vast spaces where there is  nothing to terminate the sight, but those beames which are there  contracted into a little compasse; I say, if wee doe well consider this,  wee may easily conceive, that our earth appeares as bright to those  other inhabitants in the Moone, as theirs doth to us.          Proposition 12.    _That tis probable there may bee such Meteors belonging to that world    in the Moone, as there are with us._      _Plutarch_ discussing this point affirmes that it is not necessary there  should be the same meanes of growth and fructifying in both these  worlds, since nature might in her policy finde out more waies then one  how to bring about the same effect. But however he thinks its probable  that the Moone her selfe sendeth forth warme winds, and by the  swiftnesse of her motion there should breathe out a sweet and  comfortable ayer, pleasant dewes and gentle moysture, which might serve  for the refreshing and nourishment of the inhabitants and plants in that  other world.    But since they have all things alike with us, as sea and land, and  vaporous ayer encompassing both, I should rather therefore thinke that  nature there should use the same way of producing meteors as she doth  with us (and not by a motion as _Plutarch_ supposes) because shee doth  not love to vary from her usuall operations without some extraordinary  impediment, but still keepes her beaten path unlesse she be driven  thence.    One argument whereby I shall manifest this truth, may be taken from  those new Starres which have appeared in divers ages of the world, and  by their parallax have beene discerned to have been above the _M_oone,  such as was that in _Cassiopeia_, that in _Sagittarius_, with many  others betwixt the Planets. _Hipparchus_ in his time tooke especiall  notice of such as these,[1] and therefore fancied out such  constellations in which to place the Starres, shewing how many there  were in every asterisme, that so afterwards posterity might know,  whether there were any new Starre produced or any old one missing. Now  the nature of these Comets may probably manifest, that in this other  world there are other meteors also; for these in all likelihood are  nothing else but such evaporations caused by the Sunne, from the bodies  of the Planets. I shall prove this by shewing the improbabilities and  inconveniences of any other opinion.      [Sidenote 1: _Plin. nat. hist. l. 2. c. 26._]    For the better pursuite of this 'tis in the first place requisite that I  deale with our chiefe adversary, _Caesar la Galla_, who doth most  directly oppose that truth which is here to bee proved. Hee endeavouring  to confirme the incorruptibility of the Heavens, and being there to  satisfie the argument which is taken from these comets, He answers it  thus:      _Aut argumentum desumptum ex paralaxi non est efficax, aut si est    efficax, eorum instrumentorum usum decipere, vel ratione astri vel    medii, vel distantiae, aut ergo erat in suprema parte aeris, aut si    in coelo, tum forsan factum erat ex reflectione radiorum Saturni &    Jovis, qui tunc in conjunctione fuerant._      \"Either the argument from the paralax is not efficacious, or if it    be, yet the use of the instruments might deceive either in regard of    the starre or the _medium_, or the distance, and so this comet might    be in the upper regions of the aire, or if it were in the heavens,    there it might be produced by the reflexion of the rayes from    _Saturne_ and _Jupiter_, who were then in conjunction.\"    You see what shifts hee is driven to, how he runnes up and downe to many  starting holes, that hee may find some shelter, and in stead of the  strength of reason, he answers with a multitude of words, thinking (as  the Proverbe is) that hee may use haile, when hee hath no thunder,  _Nihil turpius_ (saith [1]*_Seneca_)      _dubio est incerto, pedem modo referente, modo producente._      \"What can there bee more unseemely in one that should be a faire    disputant, then to be now here, now there, and so uncertaine, that    one cannot tell where to find him.\"    He thinkes that there are not Comets in the heavens, because there may  be many other reasons of such appearances, but what he knowes not,  perhaps (he saies) that argument from the parallax is not sufficient, or  if it be, then there may be some deceit in the observation. To this I  may safely say, that hee may justly be accounted a weake Mathematician  who mistrusts the strength of this argument, nor can hee know much in  Astronomy, who understands not the parallax, which is the foundation of  that Science, and I am sure that hee is a timorous man, who dares not  believe the frequent experience of his senses, or trust to a  demonstration.      [Sidenote 1*: _Epist. 95._]    True indeed, I grant tis possible, that the eye, the _medium_, and the  distance may al deceive the beholder, but I would have him shew which of  all these was likely to cause an error in this observation? Meerely to  say they might be deceived is no sufficient answer, for by this I might  confute the positions of all Astronomers, and affirme the starres are  hard by us, because 'tis possible they may be deceived in their  observing that distance. But I forbeare any further reply; my opinion is  of that Treatise, that either it was set forth purposely to tempt a  confutation, that hee might see the opinion of _Galilaeus_ confirmed by  others, or else it was invented with as much haste and negligence as it  was printed, there being in it almost as many faults as lines.    Others thinke that these are not any new Comets, but some ancient  starres that were there before, which now shine with that unusuall  brightnesse, by reason of the interposition of such vapors which doe  multiply their light, and so the alteration will be here onely, and not  in the heavens. Thus _Aristotle_ thought the appearance of the milkie  way was produced, for he held that there were many little starres, which  by their influence did constantly attract such a vapour towards that  place of heaven, so that it alwaies appeared white. Now by the same  reason may a brighter vapor be the cause of these appearances.    But how probable soever this opinion may seeme, yet if well considered,  you shall finde it to be altogether absurd and impossible: for,    1. These starres were never seene there before, and tis not likely that  a vapour being hard by us can so multiply that light which could not  before be at all discerned.    2. This supposed vapour cannot be either contracted into a narrow  compasse or dilated into a broad: 1. it could not be within a "]]]
