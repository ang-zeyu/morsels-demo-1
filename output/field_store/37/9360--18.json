[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/19713"],[0,"The Laughing Prince: Jugoslav Folk and Fairy Tales (#16)"],[1,"    The next day the Tsar sent two of his trusted servants to the lake to  see what was happening there. They hid themselves behind some bushes on  a little hill that commanded the lake. They were there when the shepherd  arrived and they watched him as he waded out into the water and  challenged the dragon as on the day before.    They heard the shepherd call out in a loud voice:    \"Ho, dragon, come out and we'll try a wrestling match! That is, if  you're not afraid!\"    And from the water they heard an awful voice bellow back:    \"Afraid? Who's afraid?\"    Then they saw the water of the lake churn this way and that and a  horrible scaly monster come to the surface. They saw him crawl out on  shore and clutch the shepherd around the waist. And they saw the  shepherd clutch him in a grip just as strong. And they watched the two  as they swayed back and forth and rolled over and wrestled together  without either getting the better of the other. By midafternoon when the  sun grew hot they saw the dragon grow faint and they heard him cry out:    \"Oh, if I could only dip my burning head in the cool water, then I could  toss you as high as the sky!\"    And they heard the shepherd reply:    \"Don't talk nonsense! If the Tsar's daughter would kiss my forehead,  then I could toss you twice as high!\"    Then they saw the dragon slip out of the shepherd's grasp, plunge into  the water, and disappear. They waited but he didn't show his scaly head  again that day.    So the Tsar's servants hurried home before the shepherd and told the  Tsar all they had seen and heard. The Tsar was mightily impressed with  the bravery of the shepherd and he declared that if he killed that  horrid dragon he should have the Princess herself for wife!    He sent for his daughter and told her all that his servants had reported  and he said to her:    \"My daughter, you, too, can help rid your country of this monster if you  go out with the shepherd to-morrow and when the time comes kiss him on  the forehead. You will do this, will you not, for your country's sake?\"    The Princess blushed and trembled and the Tsar, looking at her in  surprise, said:    \"What! Shall a humble shepherd face a dragon unafraid and the daughter  of the Tsar tremble!\"    \"Father,\" the Princess cried, \"it isn't the dragon that I'm afraid of!\"    \"What then?\" the Tsar asked.    But what it was she was afraid of the Princess would not confess.  Instead she said:    \"If the welfare of my country require that I kiss the shepherd on the  forehead, I shall do so.\"    So the next morning when the shepherd started out with his sheep, the  falcon on his shoulder, the dogs at his heels, the bagpipes under his  arm, the Princess walked beside him.    Her eyes were downcast and he saw that she was trembling.    \"Do not be afraid, dear Princess,\" he said to her. \"Nothing shall harm  you--I promise that!\"    \"I'm not afraid,\" the Princess murmured. But she continued to blush and  tremble and, although the shepherd tried to look into her eyes to  reassure her, she kept her head averted.    This time the Tsar himself and many of his courtiers had gone on before  and taken their stand on the hill that overlooked the lake to see the  final combat of the shepherd and the dragon.    When the shepherd and the Princess reached the lake, the shepherd put  his falcon on the log as before and tied the dogs beside it and laid his  bagpipes on the ground. Then he threw off his smock, rolled up his hose,  and wading boldly into the lake called out in a loud voice:    \"Ho, dragon, come out and we'll try a wrestling match! That is, if  you're not afraid!\"    \"Afraid?\" bellowed an awful voice. \"Who's afraid?\"    [Illustration: _Next Morning the Princess Peeped Out and Saw the  Shepherd_]    The water of the lake churned this way and that and the horrible scaly  monster came to the surface. He crawled to shore and clutched the  shepherd around the waist. The shepherd clutched him in a grip just  as strong and there they swayed back and forth and rolled over and  wrestled together on the shore of the lake without either getting the  better of the other. The Princess without the least show of fear stood  nearby calling out encouragement to the shepherd and waiting for the  moment when the shepherd should need her help.    By midafternoon when the sun was hot, the dragon grew faint and cried  out:    \"Oh, if I could but dip my burning head in the cool water, then I could  toss you as high as the sky!\"    \"Don't talk nonsense!\" the shepherd said. \"If the Tsar's daughter would  kiss my forehead then I could toss you twice as high!\"    Instantly the Princess ran forward and kissed the shepherd three times.  The first kiss fell on his forehead, the second on his nose, the third  on his mouth. With each kiss his strength increased an hundredfold and  taking the dragon in a mighty grip he tossed him up so high that for a  moment the Tsar and all the courtiers lost sight of him in the sky. Then  he fell to earth with such a thud that he burst.    Out of his body sprang a wild boar. The shepherd was ready for this and  on the moment he unleashed the two hounds and they fell on the boar and  tore him to pieces.    Out of the boar jumped a rabbit. It went leaping across the meadow but  the dogs caught it and killed it.    Out of the rabbit flew a pigeon. Instantly the shepherd unloosed the  falcon. It rose high in the air, then swooped down upon the pigeon,  clutched it in its talons, and delivered it into the shepherd's hands.    He cut open the pigeon and found the sparrow.    \"Spare me! Spare me!\" squawked the sparrow.    \"Tell me where my brothers are,\" the shepherd demanded with his fingers  about the sparrow's throat.    \"Your brothers? They are alive and in the deep dungeon that lies below  the Old Mill. Behind the mill there are three willow saplings growing  from one old root. Cut the saplings and strike the root. A heavy iron  door leading down into the dungeon will open. In the dungeon you will  find many captives old and young, your brothers among them. Now that I  have told you this are you going to spare my life?\"    But the shepherd wrung the sparrow's neck for he knew that only in that  way could the monster who had captured his brothers be killed.    Well, now that the dragon was dead the Tsar and all his courtiers came  down from the hill and embraced the shepherd and told him what a brave  youth he was.    \"You have delivered us all from a horrid monster,\" the Tsar said, \"and  to show you my gratitude and the country's gratitude I offer you my  daughter for wife.\"    \"Thank you,\" said the shepherd, \"but I couldn't think of marrying the  Princess unless she is willing to marry me.\"    The Princess blushed and trembled just as she had blushed and trembled  the night before and that morning, too, on the way to the lake. She  tried to speak but could not at first. Then in a very little voice she  said:    \"As a Princess I think it is my duty to marry this brave shepherd who  has delivered my country from this terrible dragon, and--and I think I  should want to marry him anyway.\"    She said the last part of her speech in such a very low voice that only  the shepherd himself heard it. But that was right enough because after  all it was intended only for him.    So then and there beside the lake before even the shepherd had time to  wash his face and hands and put on his smock the Tsar put the Princess's  hand in his hand and pronounced them betrothed.    After that the shepherd bathed in the lake and then refreshed and clean  he sounded his bagpipes and he and the Princess and the Tsar and all the  courtiers returned to the city driving the sheep before them.    All the townspeople came out to meet them and they danced to the music  of the bagpipes and there was great rejoicing both over the death of the  dragon and over the betrothal of the Princess and the brave shepherd.    The wedding took place at once and the wedding festivities lasted a  week. Such feasting as the townspeople had! Such music and dancing!    When the wedding festivities were ended, the shepherd told the Tsar who  he really was.    \"You say you're a Prince!\" the Tsar cried, perfectly delighted at this  news. Then he declared he wasn't in the least surprised. In fact, he  said, he had suspected as much from the first!    \"Do you think it likely,\" he asked somewhat pompously, \"that any  daughter of mine would fall in love with a man who wasn't a prince?\"    \"I think I'd have fallen in love with you whatever you were!\" whispered  the Princess to her young husband. But she didn't let her father hear  her!    The Prince told the Tsar about his brothers' captivity and how he must  go home to release them, and the Tsar at once said that he and his  bride might go provided they returned as soon as possible.    They agreed to this and the Tsar fitted out a splendid escort for them  and sent them away with his blessing.    So the Prince now traveled back through the towns and villages of three  kingdoms, across rivers and over mountains, no longer a humble shepherd  on foot, but a rich and mighty personage riding in a manner that  befitted his rank.    When he reached the deserted mill, his friend the old woman was waiting  for him.    \"I know, my Prince, you have succeeded for the monster has disappeared.\"    \"Yes, granny, you are right: I have succeeded. I found the dragon in the  lake, and the boar in the dragon, and the rabbit in the boar, and the  pigeon in the rabbit, and the sparrow in the pigeon. I took the sparrow  and killed it. So you are free now, granny, to return to your home. And  soon all those other poor captives will be free.\"    He went behind the mill and found the three willow saplings. He cut them  off and struck the old root. Sure enough a heavy iron door opened. This  led down into a deep dungeon which was crowded with unfortunate  prisoners. The Prince led them all out and sent them their various ways.  He"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/19714"],[0,"With Frederick the Great: A Story of the Seven Years' War (#16)"],[1," on fire, and they were therefore called back. The Austrian  centre moved to its right, and occupied the ground behind Lobositz  as soon as the defenders of the village had fallen back, and then  Marshal Browne formed up his whole force afresh.    His position was now as strong as it had been when the battle first  began, for the Prussians could not advance except between the  swampy ground and the river; and would have been exposed, while  doing so, to the fire of batteries both in front and in flank. The  Austrians were still greatly superior in numbers, and all the  advantages that had been gained might have been lost by a renewal  of the action. The total loss in killed, wounded, and prisoners on  the part of the Austrians was 3308. That of the Prussians was about  the same.    Although indecisive--and indeed, claimed as a victory by both  parties--the consequences showed that the advantage lay with the  Prussians. Marshal Browne's object had been to relieve the Saxons,  Frederick's to prevent this; and for the moment he had wholly  succeeded.    On the other hand was the fact that Marshal Browne had drawn off  his army practically intact, and that it was impossible for the  king to winter in Bohemia, as he would have done had the Austrian  army been defeated and dispersed; and the latter were still in a  position to make a fresh attempt to rescue the Saxons.    To prevent this, the king despatched the Duke of Bevern with a  large force, as if to get between the Austrians and the river Eger.  This movement had the desired effect. Marshal Browne at once fell  back, recrossed the river, and took up his position at his former  camp at Budin. From there he opened communications with the Saxons,  and it was arranged that these should pass the Elbe; and that he,  with 8000 men, should also do so, and march to meet them.    The Saxons, however, were detained, owing to the terrible weather  and the enormous difficulty of the defiles, and only crossed on the  13th. In the meantime the Prussians had taken up positions to cut  off the Saxon retreat, and after crossing they found themselves  hemmed in, and the roads so commanded by newly-erected batteries  that, being utterly exhausted by fatigue and hardships, they had no  resource but to surrender.    The terms enforced were hard. The officers were allowed to depart,  on giving their parole not to serve again, but the whole of the  rank and file were incorporated in the Prussian army.    Fergus Drummond and Lindsay stood by their horses, with the other  members of the staff, some short distance behind the king and  Marshal Keith, as they anxiously endeavoured to discover the  whereabouts and intentions of the Austrian army; while the crack of  musketry, between the Croats and the troops who were gradually  pressing them down the hill, continued unabated.    \"This is slow work, Drummond,\" Lindsay said, as hour after hour  passed. \"I should not like to have anything to do with the king,  just at present. It is easy to see how fidgety he is, and no  wonder. For aught we know there may be only three or four thousand  men facing us and, while we are waiting here, the whole Austrian  army may have crossed over again, and be marching up the river bank  to form a junction with the Saxons; or they may have gone by the  defiles we traversed the last two days, and may come down into  Saxony and fall on the rear of our camp watching Pirna, while the  Saxons are attacking in front. No wonder his majesty paces  backwards and forwards like a wild beast in a cage.\"    From time to time an aide-de-camp was sent off, with some order  involving the movement of a battalion farther to the right or left,  and the addition of a few guns to the battery on Homolka Hill.  Fergus had taken his turn in carrying the orders. He had, two days  before, abandoned his sling; and scarcely felt any inconvenience  from the wound, which indeed would have been of slight consequence,  had it not been for the excessive loss of blood.    \"These movements mean nothing,\" Lindsay said, as he returned from  one of these rides. \"The marshal makes the changes simply for the  sake of doing something--partly, perhaps, to take the king's  attention off this confounded delay; partly to interest the troops,  who must be just as restless and impatient as we are.\"    The messages were taken, alternately, by the king's aides-de-camp  and the marshal's.    At length, as the fog began to lift, the interest in the scene  heightened. The king and Keith talked long and earnestly together,  as they watched the village of Lobositz.    \"They have got some strong batteries there,\" Lindsay said; \"but as  far as one can see, there does not appear to be any large body of  troops. I suppose it is meant that the troops on the slopes shall  retire there, and make a strong stand. I am bound to say that it  looks very much as if Browne had only left a strong guard here, to  keep us from issuing from this defile; and that his whole army  moved away last night, and may now be some thirty miles away, on  their march towards Saxony.\"    As the fog lifted still more they could see the stream running  right across the plain, and the little village of Sulowitz on its  bank, apparently still and deserted. Presently Keith wrote an order  on a tablet, and Lindsay was sent off with it, to the general  commanding the cavalry.    \"Something is going to be done at last, Drummond,\" he said, as he  mounted. \"It is an order to the cavalry.\"    An order was then despatched to the battery on Homolka Hill, and to  the batteries on the left. Two more battalions of infantry then  moved up, to press the Croats more quickly down the hill.    Fergus watched Lindsay, and saw him ride up to the general. Several  officers at once galloped off. There was a movement among the  cavalry, and then twenty squadrons passed out through the intervals  between the brigades of infantry, and trotted out through the mouth  of the valley. They went on without interruption, until abreast of  Lobositz; and then a great number of men ran suddenly up, from the  houses of the village, to the batteries.    A minute later some thirty guns poured their fire into the Prussian  cavalry; while at the same moment the guns of a heavy battery,  hitherto unseen, poured in their fire from Sulowitz on their left  flank; while from rising ground, not visible behind it, came the  roar of thirty more pieces.    So rapidly had the aides-de-camp been sent off, that Fergus was the  only one remaining available. The king spoke a few words to the  marshal, and then said to Fergus:    \"Ride, sir, with my orders to the officer commanding the cavalry  out there, and tell him to retire at once.\"    Fergus ran back to where Karl was holding his horse.    \"Follow me, Karl,\" he said, as he sprang into the saddle; and then  rode rapidly down the steep hill and, as soon as he reached the  valley, dashed off at a headlong gallop.    \"I have orders, Karl, to recall the cavalry, who will be destroyed  unless they return. Should I fall, carry the order to their  commander.\"    The din was now prodigious. The whole of the Prussian batteries had  opened on Lobositz and Sulowitz, and between the thunder of the  guns came the incessant crackling of musketry on the hill to his  right.    Passing through the infantry, Fergus dashed across the plain. He  was mounted on the horse the marshal had given him, as the other  was not yet accustomed to stand fire. The noble animal, as if  delighted to be on level ground again, and excited by the roar of  battle, carried him along at the top of its speed without any need  of urging. Fergus knew that on the heights behind the king and  Keith would be anxiously watching him, for the peril of the cavalry  was great; and the concussion of the guns was now causing the fog  to lift rapidly and, as he rode, he could dimly make out dark  masses of men all along the rising ground behind Sulowitz, and knew  that the Austrian cavalry might, at any moment, sweep down on the  Prussians.    He was drawing abreast of Lobositz, when suddenly a squadron of  cavalry dashed out from the village. Their object was evidently to  cut him off, and prevent any message that he might bear reaching  the Prussian cavalry, which were now halted half a mile ahead.  Their officers were endeavouring to reform them from the confusion  into which they had fallen, from the speed at which they had ridden  and the heavy losses they had sustained.    He saw, at once, that the Austrians would cross his line, and  reined in his horse to allow Karl to come up to him. Had not the  trooper been exceptionally well mounted, he would have been left  far behind. As it was, while pressing his charger to the utmost, he  was still some fifty yards in rear of Fergus.    As soon as he came up, the latter said:    \"We must cut our way through the Austrians. Ride close to me. We  will ease our horses a little, until we are within fifty yards, and  then go at them at full speed. If I fall and you get through, carry  the orders to retire to the general commanding the cavalry.\"    The Austrian cavalry had formed up in two troops, one twenty yards  behind the other, and each in line two deep, extending across the  road by which Fergus was riding. Seeing, by the speed at which he  was travelling, that the Prussian staff officer had no intention of  surrendering, the Austrian in command gave the order to charge,  when they were some fifty yards away.    \"Now, Karl, boot to boot. Go right at them!\"    And with pistols in their left hands, and their swords in their  right, they sent their horses at full speed against the enemy.  These had scarcely got into motion when, like a thunderbolt, Fergus  and his orderly burst down upon them.      [Illusgtration: Not a blow was struck, horse and rider went  down before them]      The shock was irresistible. Their horses were much heavier and more  powerful than those of the Austrians, and their"]]]
