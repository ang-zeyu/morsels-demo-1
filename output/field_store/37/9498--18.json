Venizelos's own showing, the King was no party to the Allies' step, it  is not very easy to see how he could have spoken to him as if the King  had a secret understanding with them.  The episode is one on which more  light could be shed with advantage.  The same may be said of an  allegation that King Constantine secretly informed Bulgaria that, even  in the event of an attack on Servia, she would meet with no opposition  from Greece.  This allegation is supported chiefly by a telegraphic  dispatch from the Bulgarian Minister at Athens to Sofia (_White Book_,  No. 43), which somehow (it is not stated how) fell into the hands of M.  Venizelos's friends and was produced by them in the Skouloudis Inquiry.  The authenticity of this document was publicly denied by its alleged  author, and its portentous length (three large pages of close print),  as well as its unusual style render it very suspicious: it begins:  \"To-day, 9th instant,\" and it is dated \"23\"--as if the author did not  know that the difference between the Old and New Calendar was 13 days.  In face of these difficulties, strong evidence would be required to  establish its genuineness: the more because that Inquiry witnessed a  number of similar curiosities--among them an alleged dispatch from the  Turkish Minister at Athens to the Grand Vizier, regarding the  conclusion of a secret Graeco-Turkish treaty.  When challenged, M.  Skouloudis declared that such treaty never was even thought of and  denounced the dispatch as \"from beginning to end a forgery,\" whereupon  nothing more was said.  (See Skouloudis's _Apologia_, pp. 85-8).  These  matters are of interest as illustrating the atmosphere of mistrust that  poisoned Greek politics at this period, and particularly the relations  between the King of Greece and her leading politician.    [11] In pursuance of a decision taken by the War Council on 16 Feb., a  British force was sent to Lemnos to support the naval attack on the  Dardanelles, landing at Moudros on 6 March.  Greece told the British  Government that she considered the action irreconcilable with her  position as a neutral.  The British Government justified it by saying  that, as Turkey had not accepted the verdict of the Powers whereby  Lemnos and the other islands conquered in 1912 were assigned to Greece,  England had the right to treat them as Turkish territory: at the same  time declaring that this did not entail any diminution of Greek  sovereignty.  Thus, whilst Turkey was a friend, the British Government  had decided that these islands did not belong to her; it recognized her  claim to them when she became an enemy; but not altogether--only for  the duration of the War: it was merely a temporary expedient to meet a  temporary exigency.  By the same line of reasoning, England in the  following July justified the occupation of Mytilene.  The Greek answer  was that \"without consenting to the occupation of part of her territory  or admitting the arguments put forward by the British Government to  justify its action from the standpoint of International Law, Greece had  to bow before an accomplished fact.\"--Elliot to Greek Premier, Athens,  9 March, 25 July; Minister for Foreign Affairs to Greek Legations,  London and Paris, 16/29 July, 1915.

Zaimis formed a Government pledged to the policy which Greece had  pursued since the beginning of the European War: her future course  would be guided by the course of events: meanwhile, she would seek to  safeguard her vital interests by remaining armed.[1]    As regards Servia, the new Premier had an opportunity of expressing his  views at length soon after his accession to office.  The Servian  Government, judging that the imminent attack from Bulgaria realized the  _casus faederis_, asked him if, in conformity with her alliance, Greece  would be ready to take the field.  M. Zaimis answered that the Hellenic  Government was very sorry not to be able to comply with the Servian  demand so formulated.  It did not judge that in the present conjuncture  the _casus faederis_ came into play.  The Alliance, concluded in 1913,  for the purpose of establishing an equilibrium of forces between the  Balkan States, had a purely Balkan character and nowise applied to a  general conflagration.  Both the Treaty and the Military Convention  accompanying it showed that the contracting parties had in view only  the case of an isolated attack by Bulgaria against one of them.  Nowhere was there any allusion to a concerted attack by two or more  Powers.  Nor could it be otherwise: it would have been an act of mad  presumption for either of the contracting parties to offer the other  the manifestly powerless and ridiculous assistance of its armed forces  in the case of a war with several States at once.  And such was the  present case.  If the Bulgarian attack apprehended by the Servian  Government took place, it would be in concert with Germany, Austria,  and Turkey: it would be combined with the attack already carried on by  the two Central Empires: it would be an episode of the European War.  {66} The Servian Government itself had recognized this in advance by  breaking off diplomatic relations with Bulgaria in imitation of the  Entente Powers, her European Allies, without a previous understanding  with Greece, her Balkan ally.  In these circumstances, the Hellenic  Government was convinced that no obligation weighed upon it.    Further, Greece was persuaded that her armed assistance freely offered  at such a moment would ill serve the common interest of the two  countries.  Greece had remained neutral in the European War, judging  that the best service she could render Servia was to hold in check  Bulgaria by keeping her forces intact and her communications open.  The  common interest demanded that the Greek forces should continue in  reserve for better use later on: that Greece should remain neutral and  armed, watching the course of events carefully with the resolution to  guard in the best possible way, not only her own vital interests, but  also those which she had in common with Servia.    The Hellenic Government, while deeply and sincerely regretting that it  was materially impossible for it to do at present more for Servia,  wished to assure her that, faithful to their friendship, it would  continue to accord her every assistance and facility consistent with  its international position.[2]    The Entente Powers took no exception to this attitude; which is not to  be wondered at, seeing that they had hitherto uniformly ignored the  Graeco-Servian Treaty, and, by their project of territorial concessions  to Bulgaria, had laboured, as much as in them lay, to annul a pact made  for the defence of the territorial _status quo_ against Bulgaria: not  until Bulgaria had been at open war with Servia for some days (14  Oct.), could they bring themselves to declare that the promises of  Servian and Greek territory which they had made to her no longer held.  Unable, therefore, to tell Greece that she was under any obligation to  enter the War on Servia's behalf, Sir Edward Grey attempted to induce  her to do so for her own benefit by offering her the island of Cyprus.  This offer, made on 17 October, Greece felt compelled to decline: what  would it have profited her to gain Cyprus and lose Athens?  And what  could an acceptance have profited Servia either?  As {67} M. Zaimis  said, by intervening at that moment Greece would perish without saving  Servia.    Servia could have been saved had an Anglo-French expedition on an  adequate scale taken place at any of the times which the Greek General  Staff proposed for Graeco-Servian co-operation--indeed, at any time  except only the particular time chosen by the Entente.  When their  troops arrived at Salonica, the Servian army--what had been left of it  after fourteen months' fighting and typhus--was already falling back  before the Austro-Germans, who swarmed across the Drina, the Save, and  the Danube, occupied Belgrade and pushed south (6-10 Oct.), while the  Bulgars pressed towards Nish (11-12 Oct.).  On the day on which the  English offer was made (17 Oct.), the Austro-Germans were fifteen miles  south of Belgrade, and by "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/22690"],[0,"Rembrandt and His Works (#16)"],[1,"touches of transparent colour, whereas the tints of Hals seem  to have been mixed in the first instance on his palette; hence that  undisturbed dexterity of handling which gives so much the appearance  of life in his best works. The distinctive characteristics between a  portrait painter and a historical painter, is \"that the one paints man  in general, the other a particular man;\" hence, to ennoble the work, it  is necessary to make it conform, as much as can be done with safety to  the likeness, to the great principles that guide the highest branches  of the art--that is, by softening down those features that overstep the  boundary of general nature, and assisting those parts that fall short,  or are defective. Therefore, when Lawrence painted Mrs. Siddons, the  Duke of Wellington, or Lord Brougham, he chose a front view of the face,  that their peculiarities might not be too apparent. Now Sir Joshua  carried these generalizing principles to so great an extent at times  that his sitters did not recognise the striking likeness that some  people look for as paramount to all other considerations, which made his  pupil, Northcote, remark that there was a class of sitters who would not  be content \"unless the house-dog barked at it as a sign of recognition.\"  Rembrandt, on the contrary, did not generalize enough; therefore, many  portraits were left on his hands, as it is said they were left on  Reynolds's. But see the result, those very pictures from the easel  of both painters bring higher prices than the more favoured of their  likenesses, from being intrinsically fine works of art. The number  of portraits Rembrandt painted of himself is a proof of the little  encouragement he received in painting the portraits of others. From Sir  Joshua's hand we have but two or three, while from Rembrandt's we have  nearly fifty. Yet, with all the deficiencies in the art of making up  a beautiful face, Rembrandt frequently produced portraits of great  feminine beauty: witness \"The Lady with the Fan,\" in the collection of  the Marquis of Westminster, and \"The Lady,\" in the Royal Collection. Had  he got the same models of female beauty that Titian and Reynolds had, he  would, in all probability, have transferred them to the canvas with the  same truth and intenseness of feeling that guided his pencil in other  matters. Rembrandt's style was that which would have suited Oliver  Cromwell, who, when he sat for his portrait, made it a _sine qua non_  that the painter should leave out neither warts nor wrinkles. The same  truth and verisimilitude that regulated his forms, guided his eye with  respect to colour. In his earlier pictures, such as \"The Ship Builder,\"  in the Royal Collection, there is a greater degree of hardness and  solidity of pigment than in his later works, which possess more the  suppleness of flesh. This is also to be observed in the later works of  Titian, Velasquez, and Reynolds, and in the later works of our Scottish  Velasquez--Raeburn. The portraits of Gainsborough possess this in a  high degree. What has been said with regard to Rembrandt laying on his  colours with the palette-knife, is very much exaggerated. Many of his  heads are as smooth as Reynolds's, and finished with great delicacy and  precision; in fact, the versatility of his genius, and the wonderful  command over his materials, from indefatigable practice, have given both  his pictures and prints that character of having been done in the best  style suited to accomplish his object. I have mentioned that Titian  keeps his backgrounds often dark, for the purpose of giving a delicacy  to his strong shadows in the face; both Vandyke and Rembrandt do this  by making the colour of the background amalgamate with the colour of  the hair, or dark shades of the head. Rubens, Reynolds, and Lawrence  often used a red curtain in contact with their flesh, to produce the  same result. The luminous character of the head is certainly better  preserved by its giving out rays or similarity of tone to the  surrounding background. It has been remarked that the luminous and  transparent character of the flesh is enhanced, as in several of  Vandyke's portraits, by bringing it in contact with an earthy, dull  tint. Vandyke, indeed, when his ground would not permit him, introduced  over the shoulders of his females a scarf of this colour. Rembrandt  often plunges from the dark shadows of his head into his ground, and  thus gives both a breadth and unity. This practice, where the shadows of  the face are produced by the same colour as the contiguous background,  is certainly the foundation of simplicity.    I think the money value of Rembrandt's portraits may be taken as a  criterion of their intrinsic worth as works of art; other masters'  decline in producing high prices, Rembrandt's increase--witness  the portrait sold the other day at the Duke of Buckingham's, at  Stowe;--though the half-length of a burgomaster whom few people ever  heard of, it realized seven hundred guineas and upwards. No nameless  portrait by Reynolds, under the same disadvantages, would produce an  equivalent sum. Sir Joshua's portraits are either branches of our  aristocracy, or celebrated public characters. As a knowledge of art  advances, works fall naturally into their proper stations. When  Reynolds's sister asked Sir Joshua the reason that we never see any of  the portraits by Jervas now, he replied, \"Because, my dear, they are all  up in the garret.\" Yet this man drove his chariot and four, and received  the praises of Pope in verse. Sir Godfrey Kneller would sometimes  receive a sum of money and a couple of portraits by Vandyke as payment;  but now, a single portrait of the great founder of the Dutch school  would outweigh in true value a large number of Kneller's collected  talent: yet Rembrandt died insolvent, and Sir Godfrey accumulated  a large fortune. And such will be the fate of those who paint for  posterity, \"and look beyond the ignorant present.\" The true statement  of this change, which of necessity takes place, is, that the man of  genius paints according to the high impulse that has been given him, as  paramount to every other consideration; the other panders to the caprice  and ignorance of those who employ him. This it was that made Reynolds's  master, Hudson, exclaim, after Sir Joshua's return from Italy, \"Why,  Joshua, you don't paint so well as you did before you went abroad!\" When  men of genius and high talent fall upon favourable times, the result  is the reverse, and the fine arts are esteemed, and their professors  rewarded according to their excellence. The age in which Titian lived  was famous for literary men, who had made the republic of Venice known  and honoured through the whole of Italy. The praises of Michael Angelo  bestowed on the works of the great Venetian, had adorned the name of  Titian with a halo of supernatural brightness; so much so, that whilst  painting the portrait of the Emperor Charles the Fifth, happening to  drop one of his pencils, Charles stooped and picked it up, observing,  \"that a genius like Titian deserved to be waited on by emperors.\" Of  Reynolds we know that all the beauty and talent of the land flocked to  his painting-room, conscious of being handed down to posterity with  all the advantages that pictorial science could achieve. The grace  of Coreggio was grafted by this great master on the strong stem of  Rembrandt's colouring. In opposition to those advantages, we have to  remark that the people with whom Rembrandt came in contact were not  only of an inferior character, when measured by the standard of grace  and dignity, but the troubles of the times militated in a high degree  against that encouragement so necessary to the perfection of the art.  In spite of these inauspicious circumstances, the genius of Rembrandt  has produced works fraught with the highest principles of colour and  pictorial effect, and to his want of encouragement in the department  of mere common portraiture, we are indebted for many of the most  pictorial and splendid specimens of strong individual character in  familiar life.    Of all the works by Rembrandt, perhaps no picture has attracted so much  attention and observation as his \"Night Watch,\" now in the Museum of  Amsterdam. As its dimensions are thirteen feet by fourteen, it secures  attention by its size; its effect, also, is striking in a high degree,  though Reynolds, in his \"Tour to Holland and Flanders,\" says it  disappointed him, having heard so much respecting it. He remarks that  it had more of the appearance of Ferdinand Bol, from a prevalence of a  yellow, sickly colour. On the other hand, Wilkie says, \"Had it been a  subject such as 'The Christ before Pilate,' which he has etched, it  would have been his finest and grandest work.\" Though painted in 1642,  it possesses all the force and high principles of colour to be found in  his later works. Nothing can exceed the firmness and truth of the two  figures advancing to the spectator--especially the officer in the light  dress--it is modelled with all the force of nature, and the background  figures being steeped in the deepest hues of subdued colour, give a  strength and richness which nothing can surpass. Of course, there is  a want of interest in the story, which is merely an assemblage of the  Militia of Amsterdam, on occasion of the expected visit of the Prince of  Orange and the daughter of Charles the First, whom he had espoused. The  principal pictures by other great masters receive a greater notoriety  from the interest of the subject--such as \"The Transfiguration,\" by  Raffaelle; \"The Peter Martyr,\" by Titian; \"The Miracle of St. Mark,\" by  Tintoret; \"The Martyrdom of St. George,\" by Paul Veronese; and \"The St.  Jerome,\" by Coreggio. Nevertheless, \"The Night Watch,\" by Rembrandt, may  safely be classed with the choicest productions of the great painters of  Italy and Venice. When we consider that his pictures extend"]]]
