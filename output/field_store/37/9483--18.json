Price and induced him to go with them, as he was the only one there  experienced in mining. Price was on his way to Kodiak over the ice by  dog-team en route to California, as the representative of C. D. Lane,  the San Francisco mining man and millionaire.    The most of Anvil Creek was staked by this party before they returned to  the mines at Council City, fifty miles up Fish River from Golovin Bay.    \"On July second, 1899, a second cleanup was made on number one above  Discovery Claim, Anvil Creek, the property of J. Linderberg. The result  of four men shovelling out of the creek bed from a cut five feet to  bedrock for twenty hours amounted to fourteen thousand dollars in gold  dust. The men shovelled all the gravel from the moss down to bedrock  into the sluice box as it was all pay gravel. The owner refused five  hundred thousand dollars for the property without considering the  offer.\"    Tierney is authority for the statement that this claim produced four  hundred thousand dollars that season.    From this time the discoverers were known by the sobriquet of the \"Lucky  Swedes,\" for Anvil Creek was all good, there being no really \"poor dirt\"  in it, and number nine, above Discovery Claim, proved itself, the first  summer, also a banner winner.    It was here that we expected to work, as soon as supplies could be  hauled to the claim, the monotony of bread making and dish washing to be  varied by the new and strange sights on an enormously rich gold claim  not far from the Arctic Circle.    Everywhere around us were carpenter's hammers in operation, and tents  were rapidly going up. We found great difficulty in reserving ground  space enough for another tent, as others found the Sandspit as desirable  for tenting as we did, and elbowed us closely. Along the river's edge  and the beach near by many were digging and panning in the sands  searching for \"colors.\" Dog-teams were hauling freight and baggage, with  their swearing and perspiring drivers at their heels, and while the big  black-snake whips flourished in air above the dogs or upon their  straining backs, the tongues of the faithful brutes hung from their  mouths, and their wide open eyes looked appealingly at bystanders. My  heart ached for the animals, but there were no humane societies in  Alaska.    About five o'clock on Sunday afternoon it began to snow. This was the  first June snowstorm I had ever seen. Our little tent leaked badly, as  it had been hastily pitched, and the snow melted as it fell. Small  rivers of water were soon dropping upon our heads. Rain coats, oil  cloth, and opened umbrellas were utilized to protect the clothing and  the bedding.    An hour of this experience would have been enough for one time, but  troubles seldom come singly, and so the wind began to blow. Donning her  rain coat and rubbers the English girl did her best to tighten ropes and  make the tent taut, for madam's son had not returned from town.  Presently, to our great joy, we saw him coming with a loaded dog-team of  freight, and best of all, with a man friend to assist him, whose strong  arms and broad shoulders were well fitted to tent pitching. Hastily the  cart was unloaded and the large canvas tent unrolled and laid upon the  sand. Stakes were driven, poles adjusted, ropes stretched with much  straining, as the wind whistled more vigorously, and snow still fell;  and the two men, both wet and cold, huddled into the little tent for a  cup of hot tea which was waiting.    Then strong hands opened more boxes and a large oil stove, carpets, rugs  and many other necessary things were hustled into the new tent, as well  as trunks, bedding, and the contents of the small tent, with the  exception of canned goods and such things as water would not injure. The  sands were clean but wet, and if we were thankful for a stout canvas  cover over our heads we would have also been glad of a dry place under  foot. However, carpets and rugs were spread down, stoves lighted, and  the tent door flap fastened as securely as possible.    As well as we could we arranged all for the night, but we expected to  sleep little, for the storm was now fearful. Rain, snow and hail, each  came down by turns, accompanied by a high wind which drove the surf in  roaring rage upon the beach. How thankful we were that we had chosen  this spot instead of one directly in reach of the great rollers with  their mist and spray; though we had the roar and boom of the surf in our  ears continually. Sometimes it seemed that the wind had lulled, and then  with increased violence it again screamed above our heads, threatening  us each moment with disaster.    At midnight a supper of hot macaroni, cocoa, bread, butter and cheese,  with canned meat and jam, was heartily eaten by all, including the  visiting friend from Sitka who had assisted. A low box was used for a  table and we all sat upon the mats, eating from tin cups and plates with  the keenest appetites.    The weather was now awful. The storm had increased until it seemed each  moment that the tent would be torn from its fastenings, and we be left  without any protection whatever. The ropes and stakes had frequently to  be looked after and made stronger. The snow had turned to rain, which  beat heavily upon the stout canvas resisting well the water without  leaking.    By one o'clock the wind showed signs of abating, and we were so much in  need of sleep, that, all dressed as we were, we rolled ourselves in our  blankets and dozed on the rugs close to the oil stoves. For an hour I  lay uneasily dreaming, or listening to the royal cannonading of the  heavy surf upon the beach. From my diary I quote the following extract:    \"Monday, four in the morning, June eighteenth, 1900.--It is four in the  morning and we are sitting around the oil stoves in the middle of the  tent. We have just had hot cocoa and crackers. The surf still booms, but  it does not rain, and the wind has died down. We are better off than  many people. Tomorrow we will put up the other tent and get more  settled. We are thankful not to be on the sea beach, where so many are  camped. A. wishes herself home again. People around our tent all night  were talking, moving, afraid of the storm, but the big ships are still  here and they would put out to sea if it were necessary for their  safety. They say we have smallpox in town from the steamer 'Ohio,' and  yesterday Mrs. H., who came up on the 'St. Paul,' was reported to be  dying from pneumonia. The nurse, Mrs. Judge R.'s friend, is caring for  her. Judge R. and wife are still in Mrs. M.'s shack near the barracks.  It has been daylight all night. I hope to hear from father soon, and get  my freight. My friends here have all theirs. The two men are smoking and  talking while I write, and the Eskimo dogs not far away are howling in  their usual interesting nightly manner. I will now try to get a little  more sleep.\"    We had heard much of beach mining at Nome, but saw little of it. Stories  were told of men who, in the summer of 1899, had taken hundreds of  dollars in gold dust from the beach sands by the crudest methods, and  thousands of men were now flocking into the camp for the purpose of  doing beach mining. They were sadly disappointed. Not, however, because  there was no gold in the beach sands, but because it was so  infinitesimally tiny that they had no means of securing it. No hand  rocker, copper plate, nor amalgam had been used with success, neither  did any of the myriads of prospective miners bring anything with them  which promised better results. Great heaps of machinery called by  hopeful promoters \"gold dredgers\" were being daily dumped upon the beach  from the ships, signboards were covered with pictures of things similar,  while the papers continually bloomed with advertisements of machines,  which, if speedily secured by the miners, would, according to the  imaginative advertiser, soon cause all to literally roll in riches.    One flaming dodger ran in large letters thus: \"Calling millions from the  vasty deep. A fortune in one hundred days. Our dredger will work three  thousand yards of sand in heavy surf at Cape Nome. It will take out  twenty-four thousand dollars in a day. You can make more money with us  than by taking flyers in wild-cat oil schemes, etc.\" The poster was  illustrated by a huge machine gotten up on the centipede plan; at least,  it resembled that hated insect from having attached to its frame two  sets of wheels of different sizes along the sides like the legs of a  centipede, but with a steam boiler for a head, and a big pipe for a  throat from which the salt water was disgorged to wash out this immense  amount of sand and give the gold to the miner. It did not save the gold.    Thousands of dollars of good, hard-earned money were dumped upon the  beach in the shape of heavy machines of different kinds, which were  worse than useless, and only brought bitter disappointment to their  owners. Men had stripped the beach the summer before of all coarse gold  which had, perhaps, been ages in washing up from the ocean's bed, or  down the creeks from the hills, and only the fine, or \"flour gold,\" as  it was called, remained.    By the newcomers men were cursed for spreading abroad tales of beach  mining of the year before, but this was unjust, for conditions were not  the same. The waters bringing the gold to the beach could not, in one  season, replenish and leave the sands as rich as they had been after  long years, perhaps ages of action, and blame could not rightly be  attached to any one. Almost without exception, the men who did the  cursing were the men who had never been hard workers, and did not intend  to be, and so, after becoming satisfied that the nuggets were not there  to be simply picked up and pocketed, they turned, looked backward, and  went home. It was well for the new camp "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/22420"],[0,"The Book of Nature Myths (#16)"],[1,"gloomy. The old man cared nothing for the shadows or the darkness,  for he was thinking of all the mighty deeds that he had done. \"There is  no one else in the world,\" he muttered, \"who has done such deeds as I,\"  and he counted them over aloud. A sound outside of the house interrupted  him. \"What can it be?\" he said to himself. \"How dares anything interrupt  me? I have told all things to be still. It sounds like the rippling of  waters, and I have told the waters to be quiet in their beds. There it  is again. It is like the singing of birds, and I have sent the birds far  away to the south.\"    Some one opened the door and came in. It was a youth with sunny curls  and rosy face.    \"Who said you might come in?\" muttered the old man.    \"Did not you?\" asked the youth, with a merry little laugh. \"I am really  afraid that I came without asking. You see, every one is glad to see me  and\"--    \"I am not,\" interrupted the old man.    \"I have heard rumors of your great deeds,\" said the youth, \"and I came  to see whether the tales are true.\"    \"The deeds are more true than the tales,\" muttered the old man, \"for the  tales are never great enough. No one can count the wonderful things I  have done.\"    \"And what are they?\" asked the young man gravely, but with a merry  little twinkle in his eyes that would have made one think of the waves  sparkling in the sunlight. \"Let us see whether you or I can tell the  greatest tale.\"    \"I can breathe upon a river and turn it to ice,\" said the old man.    \"I can breathe upon the ice and turn it to a river,\" said the youth.    \"I can say to water, 'Stand still,' and it will not dare to stir.\"    \"I can say, 'Stand no longer,' and it will go running and chattering  down the mountain side.\"    \"I shake my white head,\" said the old man, \"and snow covers the earth.\"    \"I shake my curls,\" said the young man, \"and the air sparkles with  sunshine. In a moment the snow is gone.\"    \"I say to the birds, 'Sing no more. Leave me,' and they spread their  wings and fly far away.\"    \"I say, 'Little birds, come back,' and in a moment they are back again  and singing their sweetest songs to me.\"    \"No one can count the leaves,\" said the old man, \"but whether I shake  the trees with my icy touch, or whether I turn my cold breath upon them,  they fall to the ground with fear and trembling. Are there any rumors of  my deeds as great as that?\"    The young man answered gravely, but with a laugh in his voice, \"I never  saw any leaves falling to the ground, for when I appear, they are all  fair and green and trembling with the gladness of my coming.\"    So the two talked all night long. As morning came near, the old man  appeared weary, but the youth grew merrier. The sunlight brightened, and  the youth turned to the open door. The trees were full of birds, and  when they saw him, they sang, \"O beautiful spring! glad are we to look  again upon your face.\"    \"My own dear birds!\" cried spring. He turned to say good-by, but the old  man was gone, and where he had stood were only snowflakes. But were they  snowflakes? He looked again. They were little white snowdrops, the first  flowers of spring, the only flowers that can remember the winter.          WHY THE FACE OF THE MOON IS WHITE.      An Indian chief had a fair young daughter. One day the wind came to him  and said, \"Great chief, I love your daughter, and she loves me. Will you  give her to me to be my wife?\"    \"No,\" answered the chief.    The next day the maiden herself went to the chief and said, \"Father, I  love the wind. Will you let me go with him to his lodge and be his  wife?\"    \"No,\" declared the chief, \"I will not. When the wind was a child, he  often came into my wigwam through some tiny hole, and try as I would to  make my fire, he always put it out. He knows neither how to fight nor  how to hunt, and you shall not be his wife.\"    Then the chief hid his daughter in a thick grove of dark spruces. \"The  wind might see her in a pine,\" he thought, \"but he will never catch  sight of her in a grove of spruces.\"    Now the wind could make himself invisible if he chose, and all the time  that the chief was talking, the wind was close beside him listening to  every word. When the next night came, the wind ran round and round the  grove of spruces until he discovered a tiny place where he could get in.  When he came out, the maiden was with him. He did not dare to go near  the Indians to live, for he was afraid that the chief would come and  take her away from him; so he built a new lodge far to the north-ward.  To that lodge he carried the maiden, and she became his wife.    Neither the wind nor his young wife had thought that the chief could  ever find them, but he searched and searched, and at last he came to  their lodge. The wind hid his wife and made himself invisible, but the  father struck all about with his great war-club, and a hard blow fell  upon the head of the wind. He knew no more of what the chief was doing.    When he came to himself, he discovered that his wife was gone, and he  set out in search of her. He roamed about wildly in the forest, and at  last he saw her in a canoe with her father on the Big-Sea-Water. \"Come  with me,\" he called. She became as white as snow, but she could not see  the wind, because after the blow upon his head he had forgotten how to  make himself visible.    He was so angry with the chief that he blew with all his might upon the  tiny canoe. \"Let it tip over,\" he thought. \"I can carry my wife safely  to land.\" The canoe did tip over, and both the chief and his daughter  fell into the water. \"Come, dear wife,\" cried the wind. \"Here is my  hand.\" He did not remember that he was invisible, and that she could not  see his hand. That is why she fell down, down, through the deep water to  the bottom of the lake. The chief, too, lost his life, for the wind did  not try to help him.    When the wind discovered that his wife was gone from him, he became  almost wild with sorrow. \"The wind never blew so sadly before,\" said the  people in the wigwams.    [Illustration: \"HERE IS MY HAND\"]    The Great Spirit was sorry that the chief's daughter had fallen into the  water and lost her life, and the next night he bore her up to the stars  and gave her a home in the moon. There she lives again, but her face is  white, as it was when she fell from the canoe. On moonlight nights she  always looks down upon the earth, searching for the wind, for she does  not know that he is invisible. The wind does not know that far away in  the moon is the white face of his lost wife, and so he roams through the  forest and wanders about the rocks and the mountains, but never thinks  of looking up to the moon.          WHY ALL MEN LOVE THE MOON.      Thunder and Lightning were going to give a feast. It was to be a most  delightful banquet, for all the good things that could be imagined were  to be brought from every corner of the world.    For many days before the feast these good things were coming. The birds  flew up with what they could find in the cold air of the north and the  warm air of the south. The fishes came from the east and from the west  with what they could find in the cold water or in the warm water. As for  what grew on the earth, there was no end to the luxuries that came every  morning and every evening. Squirrels brought nuts, crows brought corn,  the ants brought sweet things of many kinds. Food that was rich and rare  came from India and Japan. The butterflies and the humming-birds were to  arrange the flowers, the peacocks and the orioles promised to help make  the place beautiful, and the waves and the brooks agreed to make their  most charming music.    Thunder and Lightning were talking about whom to invite, and they  questioned whether to ask the sun, the moon, and the wind. These three  were children of the star mother.    \"The star mother has been so kind to us that I suppose we ought to  invite her children,\" said Thunder.    \"The moon is charming, but the sun and the wind are rough and wild. If I  were the star mother, I would keep them in a corner all day, and they  should stay there all night, too, if they did not promise to be gentle,\"  said Lightning.    \"We must invite them,\" replied Thunder, with what sounded much like a  little growl, \"but it would be delightful if they would agree to stay  away, all but the moon.\"    That is why the sun and wind were invited as well as the moon. When the  invitation came, the two brothers said to their little sister, \"You are  too small to go to a feast, but perhaps they asked you because they were  going to ask us.\"    \"Star mother, I think I will stay at home,\" said the moon tearfully.    \"No, little moon,\" replied the star mother; \"go to the feast with the  other children.\"    So the three children went to the feast, and the star mother waited for  them to come home.    When they came, she asked, \"What did you bring for me?\" The hands of the  sun were full of good things, but he said, \"I brought only what I am  going to eat myself,\" and he sat down in a corner with his back to the  others, and went on eating.    \"Did you bring anything for me?\" she asked the wind.    \"I brought some good things halfway home, and then I was weary of  carrying them,\" answered the wind, \"so I have eaten them.\"    \"I should never have imagined that you would be so selfish,\" said the  star mother sadly, and she asked the little moon, \"My daughter, did you  bring anything for me?\"    \"Yes, star mother,\" answered the little moon, and she gave her mother  more good things than any one had ever seen in their home before. There  were rare luxuries that the fishes and the birds had brought. There were  rich colors that the peacocks and orioles had promised, and there was  even some of the charming music that the waves and brooks had agreed to  make.    The star mother praised the little maiden. Then she looked at her two  boys. She was sad, for she knew that they must be"]]]
