Gabriel Naude, in his apology for those great men who have been accused  of magic, has recorded a melancholy number of the most eminent scholars,  who have found, that to have been successful in their studies, was a  success which harassed them with continual persecution--a prison or a  grave!    Cornelius Agrippa was compelled to fly his country, and the enjoyment of  a large income, merely for having displayed a few philosophical  experiments, which now every school-boy can perform; but more  particularly having attacked the then prevailing opinion, that St. Anne  had three husbands, he was obliged to fly from place to place. The  people beheld him as an object of horror; and when he walked, he found  the streets empty at his approach.    In those times, it was a common opinion to suspect every great man of an  intercourse with some familiar spirit. The favourite black dog of  Agrippa was supposed to be a demon. When Urban Grandier, another victim  to the age, was led to the stake, a large fly settled on his head: a  monk, who had heard that Beelzebub signifies in Hebrew the God of Flies,  reported that he saw this spirit come to take possession of him. M. de  Langier, a French minister, who employed many spies, was frequently  accused of diabolical communication. Sixtus the Fifth, Marechal Faber,  Roger Bacon, Caesar Borgia, his son Alexander VI., and others, like  Socrates, had their diabolical attendant.    Cardan was believed to be a magician. An able naturalist, who happened  to know something of the arcana of nature, was immediately suspected of  magic. Even the learned themselves, who had not applied to natural  philosophy, seem to have acted with the same feelings as the most  ignorant; for when Albert, usually called the Great, an epithet it has  been said that he derived from his name _De Groot_, constructed a  curious piece of mechanism, which sent forth distinct vocal sounds,  Thomas Aquinas was so much terrified at it, that he struck it with his  staff, and, to the mortification of Albert, annihilated the curious  labour of thirty years!    Petrarch was less desirous of the laurel for the honour, than for the  hope of being sheltered by it from the thunder of the priests, by whom  both he and his brother poets were continually threatened. They could  not imagine a poet, without supposing him to hold an intercourse with  some demon. This was, as Abbe Resnel observes, having a most exalted  idea of poetry, though a very bad one of poets. An anti-poetic Dominican  was notorious for persecuting all verse-makers; whose power he  attributed to the effects of _heresy_ and _magic_. The lights of  philosophy have dispersed all these accusations of magic, and have shown  a dreadful chain of perjuries and conspiracies.    Descartes was horribly persecuted in Holland, when he first published  his opinions. Voetius, a bigot of great influence at Utrecht, accused  him of atheism, and had even projected in his mind to have this  philosopher burnt at Utrecht in an extraordinary fire, which, kindled on  an eminence, might be observed by the seven provinces. Mr. Hallam has  observed, that \"the ordeal of fire was the great purifier of books and  men.\" This persecution of science and genius lasted till the close of  the seventeenth century.    \"If the metaphysician stood a chance of being burnt as a heretic, the  natural philosopher was not in less jeopardy as a magician,\" is an  observation of the same writer, which sums up the whole.          POVERTY OF THE LEARNED.      Fortune has rarely condescended to be the companion of genius: others  find a hundred by-roads to her palace; there is but one open, and that a  very indifferent one, for men of letters. Were we to erect an asylum for  venerable genius, as we do for the brave and the helpless part of our  citizens, it might be inscribed, \"An Hospital for Incurables!\" When even  Fame will not protect the man of genius from Famine, Charity ought. Nor  should such an act be considered as a debt incurred by the helpless  member, but a just tribute we pay in his person to Genius itself. Even  in these enlightened times, many have lived in obscurity, while their  reputation was widely spread, and have perished in poverty, while their  works were enriching the booksellers.    Of the heroes of modern literature the accounts are as copious as they  are sorrowful.    Xylander sold his notes on Dion Cassius for a dinner. He tells us that  at the age of eighteen he studied to acquire glory, but at twenty-five  he studied to get bread.    Cervantes, the immortal genius of Spain, is supposed to have wanted  food; Camoeens, the solitary pride of Portugal, deprived of the  necessaries of life, perished in an hospital at Lisbon. This fact has  been accidentally preserved in an entry in a copy of the first edition  of the Lusiad, in the possession of Lord Holland. It is a note, written  by a friar who must have been a witness of the dying scene of the poet,  and probably received the volume which now preserves the sad memorial,  and which recalled it to his mind, from the hands of the unhappy  poet:--\"What a lamentable thing to see so great a genius so ill  rewarded! I saw him die in an hospital in Lisbon, without having a sheet  or shroud, _una sauana_, to cover him, after having triumphed in the  East Indies, and sailed 5500 leagues! What good advice for those who  weary themselves night and day in study without profit!\" Camoeens, when  some fidalgo complained that he had not performed his promise in writing  some verses for him, replied, \"When I wrote verses I was young, had  sufficient food, was a lover, and beloved by many friends and by the  ladies; then I felt poetical ardour: now I have no spirits, no peace of  mind. See there my Javanese, who asks me for two pieces to purchase  firing, and I have them not to give him.\" The Portuguese, after his  death, bestowed on the man of genius they had starved, the appellation  of Great![18] Vondel, the Dutch Shakspeare, after composing a number of  popular tragedies, lived in great poverty, and died at ninety years of  age; then he had his coffin carried by fourteen poets, who without his  genius probably partook of his wretchedness.    The great Tasso was reduced to such a dilemma that he was obliged to  borrow a crown for a week's subsistence. He alludes to his distress  when, entreating his cat to assist him, during the night, with the  lustre of her eyes--\"_Non avendo candele per iscrivere i suoi versi_!\"  having no candle to see to write his verses.    When the liberality of Alphonso enabled Ariosto to build a small house,  it seems that it was but ill furnished. When told that such a building  was not fit for one who had raised so many fine palaces in his writings,  he answered, that the structure of _words_ and that of _stones_ was not  the same thing. _\"Che pervi le pietre, e porvi le parole, non e il  medesimo!\"_ At Ferrari this house is still shown, \"Parva sed apta\" he  calls it, but exults that it was paid for with his own money. This was  in a moment of good humour, which he did not always enjoy; for in his  Satires he bitterly complains of the bondage of dependence and poverty.  Little thought the poet that the _commune_ would order this small house  to be purchased with their own funds, that it might be dedicated to his  immortal memory.    Cardinal Bentivoglio, the ornament of Italy and of literature,  languished, in his old age, in the most distressful poverty; and having  sold his palace to satisfy his creditors, left nothing behind him but  his reputation. The learned Pomponius Laetus lived in such a state of  poverty, that his friend Platina, who wrote the lives of the popes, and  also a book of cookery, introduces him into the cookery book by a  facetious observation, that \"If Pomponius Laetus should be robbed of a  couple of eggs, he would not have wherewithal to purchase two other  eggs.\" The history of Aldrovandus is noble and pathetic; having expended  a large fortune in forming his collections of natural history, and  employing the first artists in Europe, he was suffered to die in the  hospital of that city, to whose fame he had eminently contributed.    Du Ryer, a celebrated French poet, was constrained to write with  rapidity, and to live in the cottage of an obscure village. His  bookseller bought his heroic verses for one hundred sols the hundred  lines, and the smaller ones for fifty sols. What an interesting picture  has a contemporary given of a visit to this poor and ingenious author!  \"On a fine summer day we went to him, at some distance from town. He  received us with joy, talked to us of his numerous projects, and showed  us several of his works. But what more interested us was, that, though  dreading to expose to us his poverty, he contrived to offer some  refreshments. We seated ourselves under a wide oak, the table-cloth was  spread on the grass, his wife brought us some milk, with fresh water and  brown bread, and he picked a basket of cherries. He welcomed us with  gaiety, but we could not take leave of this amiable man, now grown old,  without tears, to see him so ill treated by fortune, and to have nothing  left but literary honour!\"    Vaugelas, the most polished writer of the French language, who devoted  thirty years to his translation of Quintus Curtius, (a circumstance  which modern translators can have no conception of), died possessed of  nothing valuable but his precious manuscripts. This ingenious scholar  left his corpse to the surgeons, for the benefit of his creditors!    Louis the Fourteenth honoured Racine and Boileau with a private monthly  audience. One day the king asked what there was new in the literary  world. Racine answered, that he had seen a melancholy spectacle in the  house of Corneille, whom he found dying, deprived even of a little  broth! The king preserved a profound"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/2162"],[0,"Anarchism and Other Essays (#16)"],[1,"by pellagra--a disease that, in my country,  attacks, as the physicians say, those who are badly fed and lead a  life of toil and privation.    \"I have observed that there are a great many people who are hungry,  and many children who suffer, whilst bread and clothes abound in the  towns.  I saw many and large shops full of clothing and woolen  stuffs, and I also saw warehouses full of wheat and Indian corn,  suitable for those who are in want.  And, on the other hand, I saw  thousands of people who do not work, who produce nothing and live on  the labor of others; who spend every day thousands of francs for  their amusement; who debauch the daughters of the workers; who own  dwellings of forty or fifty rooms; twenty or thirty horses, many  servants; in a word, all the pleasures of life.    \"I believed in God; but when I saw so great an inequality between  men, I acknowledged that it was not God who created man, but man who  created God.  And I discovered that those who want their property to  be respected, have an interest in preaching the existence of paradise  and hell, and in keeping the people in ignorance.    \"Not long ago, Vaillant threw a bomb in the Chamber of Deputies, to  protest against the present system of society.  He killed no one,  only wounded some persons; yet bourgeois justice sentenced him to  death.  And not satisfied with the condemnation of the guilty man,  they began to pursue the Anarchists, and arrest not only those who  had known Vaillant, but even those who had merely been present at any  Anarchist lecture.    \"The government did not think of their wives and children.  It did  not consider that the men kept in prison were not the only ones who  suffered, and that their little ones cried for bread.  Bourgeois  justice did not trouble itself about these innocent ones, who do not  yet know what society is.  It is no fault of theirs that their  fathers are in prison; they only want to eat.    \"The government went on searching private houses, opening private  letters, forbidding lectures and meetings, and practicing the most  infamous oppressions against us.  Even now, hundreds of Anarchists  are arrested for having written an article in a newspaper, or for  having expressed an opinion in public.    \"Gentlemen of the Jury, you are representatives of bourgeois society.  If you want my head, take it; but do not believe that in so doing you  will stop the Anarchist propaganda.  Take care, for men reap what  they have sown.\"    During a religious procession in 1896, at Barcelona, a bomb was  thrown.  Immediately three hundred men and women were arrested.  Some were Anarchists, but the majority were trade unionists and  Socialists.  They were thrown into that terrible bastille, Montjuich,  and subjected to most horrible tortures.  After a number had been  killed, or had gone insane, their cases were taken up by the liberal  press of Europe, resulting in the release of a few survivors.    The man primarily responsible for this revival of the Inquisition was  Canovas del Castillo, Prime Minister of Spain.  It was he who ordered  the torturing of the victims, their flesh burned, their bones  crushed, their tongues cut out.  Practiced in the art of brutality  during his regime in Cuba, Canovas remained absolutely deaf to the  appeals and protests of the awakened civilized conscience.    In 1897 Canovas del Castillo was shot to death by a young Italian,  Angiolillo.  The latter was an editor in his native land, and his  bold utterances soon attracted the attention of the authorities.  Persecution began, and Angiolillo fled from Italy to Spain, thence to  France and Belgium, finally settling in England.  While there he  found employment as a compositor, and immediately became the friend  of all his colleagues.  One of the latter thus described Angiolillo:  \"His appearance suggested the journalist rather than the disciple of  Guttenberg.  His delicate hands, moreover, betrayed the fact that he  had not grown up at the 'case.' With his handsome frank face, his  soft dark hair, his alert expression, he looked the very type of the  vivacious Southerner.  Angiolillo spoke Italian, Spanish, and French,  but no English; the little French I knew was not sufficient to carry  on a prolonged conversation.  However, Angiolillo soon began to  acquire the English idiom; he learned rapidly, playfully, and it was  not long until he became very popular with his fellow compositors.  His distinguished and yet modest manner, and his consideration  towards his colleagues, won him the hearts of all the boys.\"    Angiolillo soon became familiar with the detailed accounts in the  press.  He read of the great wave of human sympathy with the helpless  victims at Montjuich.  On Trafalgar Square he saw with his own eyes  the results of those atrocities, when the few Spaniards, who escaped  Castillo's clutches, came to seek asylum in England.  There, at the  great meeting, these men opened their shirts and showed the horrible  scars of burned flesh.  Angiolillo saw, and the effect surpassed a  thousand theories; the impetus was beyond words, beyond arguments,  beyond himself even.    Senor Antonio Canovas del Castillo, Prime Minister of Spain,  sojourned at Santa Agueda.  As usual in such cases, all strangers  were kept away from his exalted presence.  One exception was made,  however, in the case of a distinguished looking, elegantly dressed  Italian--the representative, it was understood, of an important  journal.  The distinguished gentleman was--Angiolillo.    Senor Canovas, about to leave his house, stepped on the veranda.  Suddenly Angiolillo confronted him.  A shot rang out, and Canovas was  a corpse.    The wife of the Prime Minister rushed upon the scene.  \"Murderer!  Murderer!\" she cried, pointing at Angiolillo.  The latter bowed.  \"Pardon, Madame,\" he said, \"I respect you as a lady, but I regret  that you were the wife of that man.\"    Calmly Angiolillo faced death.  Death in its most terrible form--for  the man whose soul was as a child's.    He was garroted.  His body lay, sun-kissed, till the day hid in  twilight.  And the people came, and pointing the finger of terror and  fear, they said: \"There--the criminal--the cruel murderer.\"    How stupid, how cruel is ignorance!  It misunderstands always,  condemns always.    A remarkable parallel to the case of Angiolillo is to be found in the  act of Gaetano Bresci, whose ATTENTAT upon King Umberto made an  American city famous.    Bresci came to this country, this land of opportunity, where one has  but to try to meet with golden success.  Yes, he too would try to  succeed.  He would work hard and faithfully.  Work had no terrors  for him, if it would only help him to independence, manhood,  self-respect.    Thus full of hope and enthusiasm he settled in Paterson, New Jersey,  and there found a lucrative job at six dollars per week in one of the  weaving mills of the town.  Six whole dollars per week was, no doubt,  a fortune for Italy, but not enough to breathe on in the new country.  He loved his little home.  He was a good husband and devoted father  to his BAMBINA, Bianca, whom he adored.  He worked and worked for a  number of years.  He actually managed to save one hundred dollars out  of his six dollars per week.    Bresci had an ideal.  Foolish, I know, for a workingman to have an  ideal,--the Anarchist paper published in Paterson, LA QUESTIONE  SOCIALE.    Every week, though tired from work, he would help to set up the  paper.  Until later hours he would assist, and when the little  pioneer had exhausted all resources and his comrades were in despair,  Bresci brought cheer and hope, one hundred dollars, the entire  savings of years.  That would keep the paper afloat.    In his native land people were starving.  The crops had been poor,  and the peasants saw themselves face to face with famine.  They  appealed to their good King Umberto; he would help.  And he did.  The wives of the peasants who had gone to the palace of the King,  held up in mute silence their emaciated infants.  Surely that would  move him.  And then the soldiers fired and killed those poor fools.    Bresci, at work in the weaving mill at Paterson, read of the horrible  massacre.  His mental eye beheld the defenceless women and innocent  infants of his native land, slaughtered right before the good King.  His soul recoiled in horror.  At night he heard the groans of the  wounded.  Some may have been his comrades, his own flesh.  Why, why  these foul murders?    The little meeting of the Italian Anarchist group in Paterson ended  almost in a fight.  Bresci had demanded his hundred dollars.  His  comrades begged, implored him to give them a respite.  The paper  would go down if they were to return him his loan.  But Bresci  insisted on its return.    How cruel and stupid is ignorance.  Bresci got the money, but lost  the good will, the confidence of his comrades.  They would have  nothing more to do with one whose greed was greater than his ideals.    On the twenty-ninth of July, 1900, King Umberto was shot at Monzo.  The young Italian weaver of Paterson, Gaetano Bresci, had taken the  life of the good King.    Paterson was placed under police surveillance, everyone known as an  Anarchist hounded and persecuted, and the act of Bresci ascribed to  the teachings of Anarchism.  As if the teachings of Anarchism in its  extremest form could equal the force of those slain women and  infants, who had pilgrimed to the King for aid.  As if any spoken  word, ever so eloquent, could burn into a human soul with such white  heat as the life blood trickling drop by drop from those dying forms.  The ordinary man is rarely moved either by word or deed; and those  whose social kinship is the greatest living force need no appeal to  respond--even as does steel to the magnet--to the wrongs and horrors  of society.    If a social theory is a strong factor inducing acts of political  violence, how are we to"]]]
