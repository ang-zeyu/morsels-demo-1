Bow Road Station East! It's too far. What?\"    I glanced back. The bearded man was holding up a note--a pound note  apparently. I saw the cabman nod. Without an instant's delay I rushed  up to another cabman who had just discharged a passenger.    \"To Bow Road Station East!\" I said to the man. \"Double fare if you  are quick!\"    It would be a close race. But I counted on the aid of that Fate which  dogs the steps of wrong-doers! My cab was off first and the driver had  every reason for hurrying. From the moment that we turned out into the  Strand until we arrived at our destination I saw no more of  \"Le Balafre.\" My extensive baggage I must hope to recover later.    At Bow Road Station I discovered a telephone box in a dark corner  which commanded a view of the street. I entered this box and waited.  It was important that I should remain invisible. Unless my bearded  friend had been unusually fortunate he could not well have arrived  before me.    As it chanced I had nearly six minutes to wait. Then, not ten yards  away, I saw \"Le Balafre\" arrive and dismiss the cabman outside the  station.    There was nothing furtive in his manner; he was evidently satisfied  that no one pursued him; and he stood in the station entrance almost  outside my box and lighted a cigar!    Placing his bag upon the floor, he lingered, looking to left and right,  when suddenly a big closed car painted dull yellow drew up beside the  pavement. It was driven by a brown-faced chauffeur whose nationality  I found difficulty in placing, for he wore large goggles. But before  I could determine upon my plan of action, \"Le Balafre\" crossed the  pavement and entered the car--and the car glided smoothly away, going  East. A passing lorry obstructed my view and I even failed to obtain  a glimpse of the number on the plate.    But I had seen something which had repaid me for my trouble. As the  man of the scar had walked up to the car, had exhibited to the  brown-skinned chauffeur some object which he held in the palm of his  hand ... an object which glittered like gold!        II. \"LE BALAFRE\"      CHAPTER I    I BECOME CHARLES MALET      Behold me established in rooms in Battersea and living retired during  the day while I permitted my beard to grow. I had recognized that my  mystery of \"The Scorpion\" was the biggest case which had ever engaged  the attention of the Service de Surete, and I was prepared, if  necessary, to devote my whole time for twelve months to its solution.  I had placed myself in touch with Paris, and had had certain papers  and licenses forwarded to me. A daily bulletin reached me, and one of  these bulletins was sensational.    The body of Jean Sach had been recovered from the Seine. The man had  been stabbed to the heart. Surveillance of Miguel and his associates  continued unceasingly, but I had directed that no raids or arrests  were to be made without direct orders from me.    I was now possessed of a French motor license and also that of a Paris  taxi-driver, together with all the other documents necessary to  establish the identity of one Charles Malet. Everything was in order.  I presented myself--now handsomely bearded--at New Scotland Yard and  applied for a license. The \"knowledge of London\" and other tests I  passed successfully and emerged a fully-fledged cabman!    Already I had opened negotiations for the purchase of a dilapidated  but seviceable cab which belonged to a small proprietor who had  obtained a car of more up-to-date pattern to replace this obsolete  one. I completed these negotiations by paying down a certain sum and  arranged to garage my cab in the disused stable of a house near my  rooms in Battersea.    Thus I now found myself in a position to appear anywhere at any time  without exciting suspicion, enabled swiftly to proceed from point to  point and to pursue anyone either walking or driving whom it might  please me to pursue. It was a _modus operandi_ which had served me well  in Paris and which had led to one of my biggest successes (the capture  of the French desperado known as \"Mr. Q.\") in New York.    I had obtained, _via_ Paris, particulars of the recent death of Sir  Frank Narcombe, and the circumstances attendant upon his end were so  similar to those which had characterized the fate of the Grand Duke,  of Van Rembold and the others, that I could not for a moment believe  them to be due to mere coincidence. Acting upon my advice Paris  advised Scotland Yard to press for a _post mortem_ examination of the  body, but the influence of Sir Frank's family was exercised to prevent  this being carried out--and exercised successfully.    Meanwhile, I hovered around the houses, flats, clubs and offices of  everyone who had been associated with the late surgeon, noting to what  addresses they directed me to drive and who lived at those address. In  this way I obtained evidence sufficient to secure three judicial  separations, but not a single clue leading to \"The Scorpion\"! No  matter.    At every available opportunity I haunted the East-End streets, hoping  for a glimpse of the big car and the brown-skinned chauffeur or of my  scarred man from Paris. I frequented all sorts of public bars and  eating-houses used by foreign and Asiatics. By day and by night I  roamed about the dismal thoroughfares of that depressing district,  usually with my flag down to imply that I was engaged.    Such diligence never goes long unrewarded. One evening, having  discharged a passenger, a mercantile officer, at the East India Docks,  as I was drifting, watchfully, back through Limehouse, I saw a large  car pull up just ahead of me in the dark. A man got out and the car  was driven off.    Two courses presented themselves. I was not sure that this was the  car for which I sought, but it strangely resembled it. Should I follow  the car or the man? A rapid decision was called for. I followed the man.    That I had not been mistaken in the identity of the car shortly  appeared. The man took out a cigar and standing on the corner opposite  the Town Hall, lighted it. I was close to him at the time, and by the  light of the match, which he sheltered with his hands, I saw the  scarred and bearded face! _Triomphe!_ it was he!    Having lighted his cigar, he crossed the road and entered the saloon  of a neighbourhood public-house. Locking my cab I, also, entered that  saloon. I ordered a glass of bitter beer and glanced around at the  object of my interest. He had obtained a glass of brandy and was  contorting his hideous face as he sipped the beverage. I laughed.    \"Have they tried to poison you, mister!\" I said.    \"Ah,_pardieu!_ poison--yes!\" he replied.    \"You want to have it out of a bottle,\" I continued confidentially--  \"Martell's Three Stars.\"    He stared at me uncomprehendingly.    \"I don't know,\" he said haltingly. \"I have very little English.\"    \"Oh, that's it!\" I cried, speaking French with a barbarous accent.  \"You only speak French?\"    \"Yes, yes,\" he replied eagerly. \"It is so difficult to make oneself  understood. This spirit is not cognac, it is some kind of petrol!\"    Finishing my bitter, I ordered two glasses of good brandy and placed  one before \"Le Balafre.\"    \"Try that,\" I said, continuing to speak in French, \"You will find it  is better.\"    He sipped from his glass and agreed that I was right. We chatted  together for ten minutes and had another drink, after which my  dangerous-looking acquaintance wished me good-night and went out. The  car had come from the West, and I strongly suspected that my man either  lived in the neighbourhood or had come there to keep an appointment.  Leaving my cab outside the public-house, I followed him on foot, down  Three Colt Street to Ropemaker Street, where he turned into a narrow  alley leading to the riverside. It was straight and deserted, and I  dared not follow further until he had reached the corner. I heard his  footsteps pass right to the end. Then the sound died away. I ran to  the corner. The back of a wharf building--a high blank wall--faced a  row of ramshackle tenements, some of them built of wood; but not a  soul was in sight.    I reluctantly returned to the spot at which I had left the cab--and  found a constable there who wanted to know what I meant by leaving a  vehicle in the street unattended. I managed to enlist his sympathy by  telling him that I had been in pursuit of a \"fare\" who had swindled me  with a bad half-crown. The ruse succeeded.    \"Which street did he go down, mate?\" asked the constable.    I described the street and described the scarred man. The constable  shook his head.    \"Sounds like one o' them foreign sailormen,\" he said. \"But I don't  know what he can have gone down there for. It's nearly all Chinese,  that part.\"    His words came as a revelation; they changed the whole complexion of  the case. It dawned upon me even as he spoke the word \"Chinese\" that  the golden scorpion which I had seen in the Paris cafe was of Chinese  workmanship! I started my engine and drove slowly to that street in  which I had lost the track of \"Le Balafre.\" I turned the cab so that  I should be ready to drive off at a moment's notice, and sat there  wondering what my next move should be. How long I had been there I  cannot say, when suddenly it began to rain in torrents.    What I might have done or what I had hoped to do is of no importance;  for as I sat there staring out at the dismal rain-swept street, a man  came along, saw the head-lamps of the cab and stopped, peering in my  direction. Evidently perceiving that I drove a cab and not a private  car, he came towards me.    \"Are you disengaged?\" he asked.    Whether it was that I sympathized with him--he had no topcoat or  umbrella--or whether I was guided by Fate I know not, but as he spoke  I determined to give up my dreary vigil for that night. _Pardieu!_ but  "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/18637"],[0,"The Constitution of the United States of America: Analysis and Interpretation (#16)"],[1,"searched, and the persons or things to be seized.
