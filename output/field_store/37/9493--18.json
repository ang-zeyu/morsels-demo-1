[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/22606"],[0,"The Booklover and His Books (#16)"],[1," cover is reached  again, but from the other side. Incredible as it may seem, there is a  book of India which is almost identical in structure with the ancient  Mexican book. It has the shape of the palm-leaf book, but it is made of  heavy paper, blackened to be written on with a chalk pencil, and it  opens like a fan exactly in the Mexican fashion. Each cover is formed by  a double fold of paper, and the writing runs lengthwise of the page as  in the palm-leaf volume. As the writing can be erased, the book serves  the purpose of a slate.    The variety of objects that men have used to write upon almost surpasses  imagination, ranging from mountain walls to the ivory shoulders of Rider  Haggard's heroine in his \"Mr. Meeson's Will.\" Such unusual, if actual,  writing materials belong, perhaps, rather to the penumbra than to the  background of the book; but, as a final survey of our subject, running  back to the time when there were no books and men must rely upon their  memories, we may quote what Lane says of the sources from which the  Kuran was derived after the death of Mohammed: \"So Zeyd gathered the  Kuran from palm-leaves, skins, shoulder-blades (of beasts), stones, and  the hearts of men.\"          THE CHINESE BOOK      The naturalist, Lloyd Morgan, in one of his lectures threw together on  the screen pictures of a humming bird and an insect of the same size,  the two looking so much alike as to seem to the casual observer to  belong to the same order. Yet they are anatomically far more different  than the man and the fish. In much the same way we may be led to suppose  that a Chinese book and an occidental paper-bound book are much the same  thing in origin as they are to the eye. But here too the likeness is  only apparent. One book form has descended from a block of wood and the  other from a fold of silk.    The Chinese book is such a triumph of simplicity, cheapness, lightness,  and durability that it deserves a more careful study at the hands of our  book producers than it has yet received. In fact we do not see why books  made on nearly these lines should not be an attractive and popular  innovation in our book trade. Approaches, to be sure, have been made to  this peculiar book form, but they have been partial imitations, not  consistent reproductions. In an illustrated edition of Longfellow's  \"Michael Angelo,\" published in 1885, Houghton, Mifflin and Company  produced a small folio, the binding of which is obviously patterned  after that of a Chinese book. But the printing is on every page, and the  paper is so stiff that the book will not lie open. In the holiday  edition which the same publishers issued in 1896 of Aldrich's poem,  entitled \"Friar Jerome's Beautiful Book,\" they produced a volume in  which the front folds were not intended to be cut open; but they outdid  the Chinese by printing on only one of the pages exposed at each opening  of the book, instead of on both, as the Chinese do, thus utilizing only  one-fourth of the possible printing surface of the volume. In this case  again the paper was stiff and the binding was full leather with heavy  tapes for tying. A much closer approach to the Chinese book form was  afforded by \"The Periodical,\" issued by Henry Frowde, in the form which  it bore at first. Here we have what may fairly be called a  naturalization of the Chinese book idea in the occident. But let us see  exactly what that Chinese book form is.    The standard book is printed from engraved wood blocks, each of which is  engraved on the side of the board, not on the end like our wood blocks,  and for economy is engraved on both its sides. Each of these surfaces  prints one sheet of paper, making two pages. The paper, being unsized,  is printed on only one side, and the fold is not at the back, as in our  books, but at the front. The running headline, as we should call it,  with the page number, is printed in a central column, which is folded  through when the book is bound, coming half on one page and half on the  other. There is always printed in this column a fan-shaped device,  called the fish's tail, whose notch indicates where the fold is to come.  It may be remarked in passing that the Chinese book begins on what to us  is the last page, and that the lines read from top to bottom and follow  one another from right to left. Each page has a double ruled line at top  and bottom and on the inner edge. The top and bottom lines and the  fish's tail, being printed across the front fold, show as black lines  banding the front edge when the book is bound. The bottom line is taken  by the binder as his guide in arranging the sheets, this line always  appearing true on the front edge and the others blurred. The top margin  has more than twice the breadth of the lower. After the sheets are  gathered, holes are punched at proper distances from the back edge--four  seems to be the regulation number whether the book be large or small,  but large books have an extra hole at top and bottom towards the corner  from the last hole. These holes are then plugged with rolls of paper to  keep the sheets in position, and the top, bottom, and back edges are  shaved with a sharp, heavy knife, fifty or more volumes being trimmed at  the same stroke. A piece of silk is pasted over the upper and lower  corners of the back. Covers, consisting of two sheets of colored paper  folded in front like the pages, are placed at front and back, but not  covering the back edge, or there is an outer sheet of colored paper with  inside lining paper and a leaf of heavy paper between for stiffening.  Silk cord is sewn through the holes and neatly tied, and the book is  done--light in the hand and lying open well, inexpensive and capable  with proper treatment of lasting for centuries.    What are the chief defects of the Chinese book from an occidental point  of view? The most obvious is that it will not stand alone. Another is  that its covers, being soft, are easily crumpled and dog's-eared. A  third is that it is printed on only one side of the paper and therefore  wastes space. All these objections must be admitted, but it may be urged  with truth that our books, in spite of their relatively costly binding,  do not stand alone any too well, and in fact this is a function seldom  asked of books anyway. Its covers are soft, but this means at least that  they are not so hard and foreign to the material of the book as to tear  themselves off after a dozen readings, as is the case with so many of  our bindings. There is no danger of breaking the back of a Chinese book  on first opening it, for it has no lining of hard glue. As to the  utilization of only one side of the paper, it must be remembered that  the Chinese paper is very thin, and that this practice makes it possible  to secure the advantage of opacity without loading the paper with a  foreign and heavy material. Moreover, the thickness of the pasteboard  cover is saved on the shelves, and even if a substitute for it is  adopted, it is in the form of a light pasteboard case that holds several  volumes at once. Such a cover is capable of being lettered on the back,  though the Chinese seem not to think this necessary, but put their title  labels on the side. Really, the back of the Chinese book is to us its  most foreign feature. It is a raw edge, not protected by the cover, and  differs from the front only in consisting of the edges of single leaves  instead of folds. It is in fact a survival from the days before the  invention of paper, when books were printed on silk, the raw edge of  which would fray and was therefore consigned to the position where it  would have the least wear and would do the least harm if worn.    But there is no reason why, in Europeanizing the Chinese book, the  corner guard should not be extended the whole length of the back and  bear the ordinary lettering. With this slight difference the Chinese  book would be equipped to enter the lists on fairly even terms against  the prevailing occidental type of book, which has come down to us from  the ancient Roman codex through the parchment book, of which ours is  only a paper imitation. In \"The Periodical,\" referred to, four pages  instead of two were printed at once, or, at least, four constitute a  fold. The sheets are stitched through with thread--they might, of  course, have been wire-stitched--and then a paper cover is pasted on, as  in the case of any magazine or paper-bound book. But in this process the  beauty of the Chinese binding disappears, though the Chinese do the  same with their cheapest pamphlets. In these days, when lightness and  easy handling are such popular features in books, what publisher will  take up the book form that for two thousand years has enshrined the  wisdom of the Flowery Kingdom, and by trifling adaptations here and  there make it his own and ours?          THICK PAPER AND THIN      Sir Hiram Maxim, the knight from Maine, prophesies that we shall change  our religion twenty times in the next twenty thousand years. In the last  two thousand years we have changed our book material twice, from papyrus  to parchment and from parchment to paper, with a consequent change of  the book form from the roll to the codex. Shall we therefore change our  book material twenty times in the next twenty thousand years? Only time  itself can tell; but for five hundred years the book has never been in  such unstable equilibrium as at present; the proverb \"A book's a book\"  has never possessed so little definite meaning. This condition applies  chiefly to the paper, but as this changes, the binding will also change  from its present costly and impermanent character to something at once  cheaper and more durable.    The changes in modern paper have worked in two opposite directions,  represented on the one hand by Oxford India paper, with its miraculous  thinness, opacity, and lightness, and on the other hand by papers that,  while also remarkably light, offer, as a "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/22607"],[0,"The Book-Hunter in London (#16)"],[1,"t, and, being told that Mr.  Topham Beauclerk (who is said to have but once departed from his  inflexible rule of never lending a book) was a proper person to offer it  to, she waited on him for that purpose. He asked what she required for  it, and, being answered L4 4s., took it without hesitation, though  unacquainted with the real value of the book. Being desirous, however,  of information with respect to the nature of the purchase he had made,  he went to an eminent bookseller's, and inquired what he would give for  such a book. The bookseller replied L17 17s. Mr. Beauclerk went  immediately to the person who sold him the book, and, telling her that  she had been mistaken in its value, not only gave her the additional 13  guineas, but also generously bestowed a further gratuity on her. Few  bargain-hunters would have felt called upon to act as Beauclerk[55:A]  did. Here is another anecdote of a contemporary book-hunter:    Nichols states that Mr. David Papillon (who died in 1762), a gentleman  of fortune and literary taste, as well as a good antiquary, contracted  with Osborne to furnish him with L100 worth of books, at 3d. apiece. The  only conditions were, that they should be perfect, and that there  should be no duplicate. Osborne was highly pleased with his bargain,  and the first great purchase he made, he sent Mr. Papillon a large  quantity; but in the next purchase he found he could send but few, and  the next still fewer. Not willing, however, to give up, he sent books  worth 5s. apiece, and at last was forced to go and beg to be let off the  contract. Eight thousand books would have been wanted!    An interesting collector, at once the type of a country gentleman and of  a true bibliophile, was Sir John Englis Dolben (1750-1837), of Finedon  Hall, Northamptonshire. He was educated at Westminster School,  proceeding thence to Christ Church in 1768. Previously to his final  retirement into the country, he lingered with much affection about the  haunts of his youthful studies. He carried so many volumes about with  him in his numerous and capacious pockets that he appeared like a  walking library, and his memory, particularly in classical quotations,  was equally richly stored. This is one side of the picture. This is the  other side, in which we get a view of the man-about-town collector in  the person of Alexander Dalrymple (1737-1808), the hydrographer to the  Admiralty and to the East India Company: 'His yellow antiquarian chariot  seemed to be immovably fixed in the street, just opposite the  entrance-door of the long passage leading to the sale-room of Messrs.  King and Lochee, in King Street, Covent Garden; and towards the bottom  of the table, in the sale-room, Mr. Dalrymple used to sit, a cane in his  hand, his hat always upon his head, a thin, slightly-twisted queue, and  silver hairs that hardly shaded his temple. . . . His biddings were  usually silent, accompanied by the elevation and fall of his cane, or by  an abrupt nod of the head.'    [Illustration: _Michael Wodhull, Book-collector._]    The Osterley Park Library, sold by order of the seventh Earl of Jersey  at Sotheby's in 1885, was commenced in the last century, the original  founder being Bryan Fairfax, who died in 1747. His books came into the  hands of Alderman Child, who was not only a book-collector, but  inherited Lord Mavor Child's books. The fifth Earl of Jersey married  Mr. Child's grand-daughter in 1804. Two mighty hunters of the old  school may be here briefly mentioned--John Towneley and Michael Wodhull,  the poet, both of whose collections were dispersed in several portions,  partly at the beginning of the present century, and partly within quite  recent times. The founder of the 'Bibliotheca Towneleiana' was for a  long period of years an ardent collector, his favourite studies being  English history, topography, and portraits. The great gem of his  collection was the splendid 'Vita Christi,' gorgeously ornamented with  full-page paintings, and with miniatures superbly executed in colours,  heightened with gold, by Giulio Clovio, in the finest style of Italian  art. This MS. was executed for Alexander, Cardinal Farnese, and  presented to Pope Paul III. It was purchased abroad by a Mr. Champernoun  for an inconsiderable sum, and cost Mr. Towneley 400 guineas. At its  sale in 1883 it realized L2,050. Two portions of the Towneley Library  were dispersed by Evans in 1814-15 (seventeen days), and realized over  L8,597, and other portions were sold in 1816 and 1817. Towneley himself  died in May, 1813, aged eighty-two. The remainder of his extensive  collection was sold at Sotheby's in 1883 (ten days). Wodhull, who died  November 10, 1816, aged seventy-six, had two sales during his lifetime,  first in 1801 (chiefly duplicates), and secondly in 1803 (chiefly Greek  and Roman classics). He, however, reserved for himself a library of  about 4,000, which, passing into the possession of Mr. F. E. Severne,  M.P., was sold at Sotheby's in January, 1886, and realized a total of  L11,973 4s. 6d. He is the Orlando of Dibdin's 'Bibliomania.' The Greek  and Roman classics formed the chief attraction of this _post-mortem_  sale, which is generally regarded as one of the most important of its  kind held during recent years. Most of the prizes were picked up in  France after 1803, and it was during one of his book-hunting expeditions  in Paris that Wodhull was detained by Napoleon.    Two other 'fashionable' or titled collectors may be here grouped  together. The fine library formed by William, Marquis of Lansdowne was  dispersed by Leigh and Sotheby in thirty-one days, beginning with  January 6, 1806, the 6,530 lots realizing L6,701 2s. 6d. The highest  amount paid for a single lot was for a very rare collection of tracts,  documents, and pamphlets, in over 280 volumes, illustrating the history  of the French Revolution, together with forty-nine volumes relative to  the transactions in the Low Countries between the years 1787 and 1792,  and their separation from the House of Austria. Wynkyn de Worde's  'Rycharde Cure de Lyon,' 1528, sold for L47 5s.; and a curious  collection of 'Masks' and 'Triumphs,' of the early seventeenth century,  mostly by Ben Jonson, realized L40. As a book-collector Sir Mark  Masterman Sykes is a much better remembered figure in the annals of  book-hunting than that of the Marquis of Lansdowne. The Sykes library  contained a number of the _editiones principes_ of the classics, some on  vellum, and also a number of Aldines in the most perfect condition.  There were also many highly curious and very rare pieces of early  English poetry. The collection was sold at Evans's in 1824, and the gems  of the collection were a copy of the Mazarin Bible, and the Latin  Psalter, 1459, to which full reference is made in a subsequent chapter.      II.    The history of literature, it is said, teaches us to consider its  decline only as the development of a great principle of succession by  which the treasures of the mind are circulated and equalized; as shoots  by which the stream of improvement is forcibly directed into new  channels, to fertilize new soils and awaken new capabilities. The  history of book-collecting teaches us a similar lesson. The love which  so often amounted to a positive passion for the exquisite productions of  the Age of Illuminated Manuscripts, all but died with the introduction  of the printing-press, which in reality was but a continuation of the  old art in a new form. And so on, down through the successive decades  and generations of the past four centuries, the decline--but not the  death, for such a term cannot be applied to any phase of  book-collecting--of one particular aspect of the hobby has synchronized  with the birth of several others, sometimes more worthy, and at others  less. An exhaustive inquiry into the various and manifold changes  through which the human mind passed alone might account for these  various developments, which it is not the intention of the present  writer on this occasion to analyze.    The rise and progress of what Sir Egerton Brydges calls 'the  black-letter mania' gave the death-blow to the long-cherished school of  poetry of which Pope may be taken as the most distinguished exponent.  'Men of loftier taste and bolder fancy early remonstrated against this  chilling confinement of the noblest, the most aspiring, and most  expansive of all the Arts. . . . It was not till the commotion of Europe  broke the chain of indolence and insipid effeminacy that the stronger  passions of readers required again to be stimulated and exercised and  soothed, and that the minor charms of correctness were sacrificed to the  ardent efforts of uncontrolled and unfearing genius. The authors of this  class began to look back for their materials to an age of hazardous  freedom, and copious and untutored eloquence: an age in which the world  of words and free and native ideas was not contracted and blighted by  technical critics and cold and fastidious scholars.' To abandon the  abstract for the more matter-of-fact details of sober history, the mania  to which Brydges alludes may be said to date itself from the spring of  1773. The occasion was the sale in London of the library of James West,  President of the Royal Society. George Nicol, the bookseller, was an  extensive purchaser at this sale for the King, for whom, indeed, he  acted in a similar capacity up to the last. Nicol told Dibdin 'with his  usual pleasantry and point, that he got abused in the public papers, by  Almon and others, for having purchased nearly the whole of the Caxtonian  volumes in this collection for his Majesty's library. It was said abroad  that a Scotchman had lavished away the King's money in buying old  black-letter books.' The absurdity of this report was soon proved at  subsequent sales. Dibdin adds, as a circumstance highly honourable to  the King, that 'his Majesty, in his directions to Mr. Nicol,"]]]
