This is a unity divine, heavenly,  radiant, merciful; the one reality appearing in its successive  manifestations. For instance, the sun is one and the same but its points  of dawning are various. During the summer season it rises from the  northern point of the ecliptic; in winter it appears from the southern  point of rising. Each month between it appears from a certain zodiacal  position. Although these dawning-points are different, the sun is the same  sun which has appeared from them all. The significance is the reality of  prophethood which is symbolized by the sun, and the holy Manifestations  are the dawning-places or zodiacal points.    There is also the divine unity or entity which is sanctified above all  concept of humanity. It cannot be comprehended nor conceived because it is  infinite reality and cannot become finite. Human minds are incapable of  surrounding that reality because all thoughts and conceptions of it are  finite, intellectual creations and not the reality of divine being which  alone knows itself. For example, if we form a conception of divinity as a  living, almighty, self-subsisting, eternal being, this is only a concept  apprehended by a human intellectual reality. It would not be the outward,  visible reality which is beyond the power of human mind to conceive or  encompass. We ourselves have an external, visible entity but even our  concept of it is the product of our own brain and limited comprehension.  The reality of divinity is sanctified above this degree of knowing and  realization. It has ever been hidden and secluded in its own holiness and  sanctity above our comprehending. Although it transcends our realization,  its lights, bestowals, traces and virtues have become manifest in the  realities of the prophets, even as the sun becomes resplendent in various  mirrors. These holy realities are as reflectors, and the reality of  divinity is as the sun which although it is reflected from the mirrors,  and its virtues and perfections become resplendent therein, does not stoop  from its own station of majesty and glory and seek abode in the mirrors;  it remains in its heaven of sanctity. At most it is this, that its lights  become manifest and evident in its mirrors or manifestations. Therefore  its bounty proceeding from them is one bounty but the recipients of that  bounty are many. This is the unity of God; this is oneness;--unity of  divinity, holy above ascent or descent, embodiment, comprehension or  idealization;--divine unity--the prophets are its mirrors; its lights are  revealed through them; its virtues become resplendent in them, but the Sun  of Reality never descends from its own highest point and station. This is  unity, oneness, sanctity; this is glorification whereby we praise and  adore God.            THE DARKENED LIGHTS      From the time of the creation of Adam to this day there have been two  pathways in the world of humanity; one the natural or materialistic, the  other the religious or spiritual. The pathway of nature is the pathway of  the animal realm. The animal acts in accordance with the requirements of  nature, follows its own instincts and desires. Whatever its impulses and  proclivities may be it has the liberty to gratify them; yet it is a  captive of nature. It cannot deviate in the least degree from the road  nature has established. It is utterly minus spiritual susceptibilities,  ignorant of divine religion and without knowledge of the Kingdom of God.  The animal possesses no power of ideation or conscious intelligence; it is  a captive of the senses and deprived of that which lies beyond them. It is  subject to what the eye sees, the ear hears, the nostrils sense, the taste  detects and touch reveals. These sensations are acceptable and sufficient  for the animal. But that which is beyond the range of the senses, that  realm of phenomena through which the conscious pathway to the Kingdom of  God leads, the world of spiritual susceptibilities and divine religion,--of  these the animal is completely unaware, for in its highest station it is a  captive of nature.    One of the strangest things witnessed is that the materialists of today  are proud of their natural instincts and bondage. They state that nothing  is entitled to belief and acceptance except that which is sensible or  tangible. By their own statements they are captives of nature, unconscious  of the spiritual world, uninformed of the divine kingdom and unaware of  heavenly bestowals. If this be a virtue the animal has attained it to a  superlative degree, for the animal is absolutely ignorant of the realm of  spirit and out of touch with the inner world of conscious realization. The  animal would agree with the materialist in denying the existence of that  which transcends the senses. If we admit that being limited to the plane  of the senses is a virtue the animal is indeed more virtuous than man, for  it is entirely bereft of that which lies beyond, absolutely oblivious of  the Kingdom of God and its traces whereas God has deposited within the  human creature an illimitable power by which he can rule the world of  nature.    Consider how all other phenomenal existence and beings are captives of  nature. The sun, that colossal center of our solar system, the giant stars  and planets, the towering mountains, the earth itself and its kingdoms of  life lower than the human,--all are captives of nature except man. No other  created thing can deviate in the slightest degree from obedience to  natural law. The sun in its glory and greatness millions of miles away is  held prisoner in its orbit of universal revolution, captive of universal  natural control. Man is the ruler of nature. According to natural law and  limitation he should remain upon the earth, but behold how he violates  this command and soars above the mountains in aeroplanes. He sails in  ships upon the surface of the ocean and dives into its depths in  submarines. Man makes nature his servant; harnesses the mighty energy of  electricity for instance and imprisons it in a small lamp for his uses and  conveniences. He speaks from the East to the West through a wire. He is  able to store and preserve his voice in a phonograph. Though he is a  dweller upon earth he penetrates the mysteries of starry worlds  inconceivably distant. He discovers latent realities within the bosom of  the earth, uncovers treasures, penetrates secrets and mysteries of the  phenomenal world and brings to light that which according to nature's  jealous laws should remain hidden, unknown and unfathomable. Through an  ideal inner power man brings these realities forth from the invisible  plane to the visible. This is contrary to nature's law.    It is evident therefore that man is ruler over nature's sphere and  province. Nature is inert, man is progressive. Nature has no  consciousness, man is endowed with it. Nature is without volition and acts  perforce whereas man possesses a mighty will. Nature is incapable of  discovering mysteries or realities whereas man is especially fitted to do  so. Nature is not in touch with the realm of God, man is attuned to its  evidences. Nature is uninformed of God, man is conscious of Him. Man  acquires divine virtues, nature is denied them. Man can voluntarily  discontinue vices, nature has no power to modify the influence of its  instincts. Altogether it is evident that man is more noble and superior;  that in him there is an ideal power surpassing nature. He has  consciousness, volition, memory, intelligent power, divine attributes and  virtues of which nature is completely deprived, bereft and minus;  therefore man is higher and nobler by reason of the ideal and heavenly  force latent and manifest in him.    How strange then it seems that man, notwithstanding his endowment with  this ideal power, will descend to a level beneath him and declare himself  no greater than that which is manifestly inferior to his real station. God  has created such a conscious spirit within him that he is the most  wonderful of all contingent beings. In ignoring these virtues he descends  to the material plane, considers matter the ruler of existence and denies  that which lies beyond. Is this virtue? In its fullest sense this is  animalistic, for the animal realizes nothing more. In fact from this  standpoint the animal is the greater philosopher because it is completely  ignorant of the Kingdom of God, possesses no spiritual susceptibilities  and is uninformed of the heavenly world. In brief, this is a view of the  pathway of nature.    The second pathway is that of religion, the road of the divine Kingdom. It  involves the acquisition of praiseworthy attributes, heavenly illumination  and righteous actions in the world of humanity. This pathway is conducive  to the progress and uplift of the world. It is the source of human  enlightenment, training and ethical improvement; the magnet which attracts  the love of God because of the knowledge of God it bestows. This is the  road of the holy Manifestations of God for they are in reality the  foundation of the divine religion of oneness. There is no change or  transformation in this pathway. It is the cause of human betterment, the  acquisition of heavenly virtues and the illumination of mankind.    Alas! that humanity is completely submerged in imitations and unrealities  notwithstanding the truth of divine religion has ever remained the same.  Superstitions have obscured the fundamental reality, the world is darkened  and the light of religion is not apparent. This darkness is conducive to  differences and dissensions; rites and dogmas are many and various;  therefore discord has arisen among the religious systems whereas religion  is for the unification of mankind. True religion is the source of love and  agreement amongst men, the cause of the development of praiseworthy  qualities; but the people are holding to the counterfeit and imitation,"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/19239"],[0,"Bahá'í World Faith (#16)"],[1," composite civilization. This wonderful power  and extraordinary efficacy of the Word prove conclusively the validity of  His Holiness Christ. Consider how His heavenly sovereignty is still  permanent and lasting. Verily this is conclusive proof and manifest  evidence.    From another horizon we see Muhammad the prophet of Arabia appearing. You  may not know that the first address of Muhammad to His tribe was the  statement, \"Verily, Moses was a prophet of God and the Torah is a book of  God. Verily, O ye people, ye must believe in the Torah, in Moses and the  prophets. Ye must accept all the prophets of Israel as valid.\" In the  Qur'an, the Muhammadan Bible, there are seven statements or repetitions of  the Mosaic narrative, and in all the historic accounts Moses is praised.  Muhammad announces that His Holiness Moses was the greatest prophet of  God, that God guided Him in the wilderness of Sinai, that through the  light of guidance Moses hearkened to the summons of God, that He was the  interlocutor of God and the bearer of the tablet of the ten commandments,  that all the contemporary nations of the world arose against Him and that  eventually Moses conquered them, for falsehood and error are ever overcome  by truth. There are many other instances of Muhammad's confirmation of  Moses. I am mentioning but a few. Consider that His Holiness Muhammad was  born among the savage and barbarous tribes of Arabia, lived among them and  was outwardly illiterate and uninformed of the holy books of God. The  Arabian people were in the utmost ignorance and barbarism. They buried  their infant daughters alive, considering this to be an evidence of a  valorous and lofty nature. They lived in bondage and serfdom under the  Iranian and Roman governments and were scattered throughout the desert  engaged in continual strife and bloodshed. When the light of Muhammad  dawned, the darkness of ignorance was dispelled from the deserts of  Arabia. In a short period of time those barbarous peoples attained a  superlative degree of civilization which with Ba_gh_dad as its center  extended as far westward as Spain and afterward influenced the greater  part of Europe. What proof of prophethood could be greater than this,  unless we close our eyes to justice and remain obstinately opposed to  reason.    Today the Christians are believers in Moses, accept Him as a prophet of  God and praise Him most highly. The Muhammadans are likewise believers in  Moses, accept the validity of His prophethood, at the same time believing  in Christ. Could it be said that the acceptance of Moses by the Christians  and Muhammadans has been harmful and detrimental to those people? On the  contrary, it has been beneficial to them, proving that they have been  fair-minded and just. What harm could result to the Jewish people then if  they in return should accept His Holiness Christ and acknowledge the  validity of the prophethood of His Holiness Muhammad? By this acceptance  and praiseworthy attitude the enmity and hatred which have afflicted  mankind so many centuries would be dispelled, fanaticism and bloodshed  pass away and the world be blessed by unity and agreement. Christians and  Muhammadans believe and admit that Moses was the interlocutor of God. Why  do you not say that Christ was the Word of God? Why do you not speak these  few words that will do away with all this difficulty? Then there will be  no more hatred and fanaticism, no more warfare and bloodshed in the Land  of Promise. Then there will be peace among you forever.    Verily, I now declare to you that Moses was the interlocutor of God and a  most noteworthy prophet; that Moses revealed the fundamental law of God  and founded the real ethical basis of the civilization and progress of  humanity. What harm is there in this? Have I lost anything by saying this  to you and believing it as a Baha'i? On the contrary it benefits me, and  His Holiness Baha'u'llah, the founder of the Baha'i Cause, confirms me,  saying: \"You have been fair and just in your judgment; you have  impartially investigated the truth and arrived at a true conclusion; you  have announced your belief in Moses a prophet of God and accepted the  Torah the book of God.\" Inasmuch as it is possible for me to sweep away  all evidences of prejudice by such a liberal and universal statement of  belief why is it not possible for you to do likewise? Why not put an end  to this religious strife and establish a bond of connection between the  hearts of men? Why should not the followers of one religion praise the  founder or teacher of another? The other religionists extol the greatness  of His Holiness Moses and admit that He was the founder of Judaism. Why do  the Hebrews refuse to praise and accept the other great messengers who  have appeared in the world? What harm could there be in this? What  rightful objection? None whatever. You would lose nothing by such action  and statement. On the contrary you would contribute to the welfare of  mankind. You would be instrumental in establishing the happiness of the  world of humanity. The eternal honor of man depends upon the liberalism of  this modern age. Inasmuch as our God is one God and the creator of all  mankind, He provides for and protects all. We acknowledge him as a God of  kindness, justice and mercy. Why then should we, His children and  followers, war and fight, bringing sorrow and grief into the hearts of  each other? God is loving and merciful. His intention in religion has ever  been the bond of unity and affinity between humankind.    Praise be to God! the mediaeval ages of darkness have passed away and this  century of radiance has dawned,--this century wherein the reality of things  is becoming evident,--wherein science is penetrating the mysteries of the  universe, the oneness of the world of humanity is being established and  service to mankind is the paramount motive of all existence. Shall we  remain steeped in our fanaticisms and cling to our prejudices? Is it  fitting that we should still be bound and restricted by ancient fables and  superstitions of the past; be handicapped by superannuated beliefs and the  ignorances of dark ages, waging religious wars, fighting and shedding  blood, shunning and anathematizing each other? Is this becoming? Is it not  better for us to be loving and considerate toward each other? Is it not  preferable to enjoy fellowship and unity; join in anthems of praise to the  most high God and extol all His prophets in the spirit of acceptance and  true vision? Then indeed this world will become a paradise and the  promised Day of God will dawn. Then according to the prophecy of Isaiah  the wolf and the lamb will drink from the same stream, the owl and the  vulture will nest together in the same branches and the lion and the calf  pasture in the same meadow. What does this mean? It means that fierce and  contending religions, hostile creeds and divergent beliefs will reconcile  and associate, notwithstanding their former hatreds and antagonism.  Through the liberalism of human attitude demanded in this radiant century  they will blend together in perfect fellowship and love. This is the  spirit and meaning of Isaiah's words. There will never be a day when this  prophecy will come to pass literally, for these animals by their natures  cannot mingle and associate in kindness and love. Therefore this prophecy  symbolizes the unity and agreement of races, nations and peoples who will  come together in attitudes of intelligence, illumination and spirituality.    The age has dawned when human fellowship will become a reality.    The century has come when all religions shall be unified....          INDUSTRIAL JUSTICE      You have questioned me about strikes. This question is and will be for a  long time the subject of great difficulties. Strikes are due to two  causes. One is the extreme sharpness and rapacity of the capitalists and  manufacturers; the other, the excesses, the avidity and ill-will of the  workmen and artisans. It is therefore necessary to remedy these two  causes.    But the principal cause of these difficulties lies in the laws of the  present civilization; for they lead to a small number of individuals  accumulating incomparable fortunes, beyond their needs, whilst the greater  number remains destitute, stripped and in the greatest misery. This is  contrary to justice, to humanity, to equity; it is the height of iniquity,  the opposite to what causes divine satisfaction.    This contrast is peculiar to the world of man: with other creatures, that  is to say with nearly all animals, there is a kind of justice and  equality. Thus in a shepherd's flock of sheep, in a troop of deer in the  country, among the birds of the prairie, of the plain, of the hill or of  the orchard, almost every animal receives a just share based on equality.  With them such a difference in the means of existence is not to be found:  so they live in the most complete peace and joy.    It is quite otherwise with the human species, which persists in the  greatest error, and in absolute iniquity. Consider an individual who has  amassed treasures by colonizing a country for his profit: he has obtained  an incomparable fortune, and has secured profits and incomes which flow  like a river, whilst a hundred thousand unfortunate people, weak and  powerless, are in need of a mouthful of bread. There is neither equality  nor brotherhood. So you see that general peace and joy are destroyed, the  welfare of humanity is partially annihilated, and that collective life is  fruitless. Indeed, fortune, honors, commerce, industry are in the hands of  some industrials, whilst other people are submitted to quite a series of  difficulties and to limitless troubles: they have neither advantages nor  profits, nor comforts, nor peace.    Then rules and laws should be established to regulate the excessive  fortunes of certain private individuals, and limit the misery of millions "]]]
