Some of those generals at the Front are  old women! They ought to send them home, and set them some knitting to  do. If I'd the ordering of affairs I'd give the command to fellows under  twenty-five! New wine should be in new bottles.\"    The younger children listened with admiration to Percy's views on war  topics, much regretting that the Government had not yet obtained the  benefit of his advice. Godfrey even hoped that the war would not be over  before there was a chance for precept to be put into practice, and  already, in imagination, saw his brother in the uniform of a Field  Marshal. Winona smiled tolerantly. She took Percy's opinions for what  they were worth. If his school report was anything to go by, he had  certainly not won laurels at Longworth this term, in the direction of  brainwork, and the headmaster's comment: \"Lacking in steady  application,\" had probably been amply justified.    Winona was not altogether happy about Percy, these holidays. Jack  Cassidy was spending Christmas at the Vicarage, and claimed much of his  time, and the influence was not altogether for good. Young Cassidy had  already given the Vicar, his guardian and former tutor, considerable  trouble. At twenty-two he had run through a large proportion of the  money which had come to him at his majority, though fortunately he could  not touch the bulk of his property till he should be twenty-five. At  present he was waiting for a commission, and amusing himself as best he  could in the village until the welcome missive should arrive. For lack  of other congenial companions he sought Percy's society. Neither Mr.  James, the Vicar, nor Mrs. Woodward realized how much the two young  fellows were together, or they certainly would not have encouraged the  intimacy. Winona, who was just old enough to recognize certain  undesirable features, tackled Percy in private.    \"Mother wouldn't like your going into 'The Blue Harp,' and playing  billiards with Jack!\" she remonstrated. \"You were there hours yesterday.  Doesn't it cost a lot?\"    \"Oh, Jack pays for it! At least he settles with old Chubbs. I have a bit  on the score, of course, but he says that can wait a while. I'm  improving, and I'll beat him yet, and win my own back.\"    \"You promised mother you wouldn't bet again, after what happened last  Easter.\"    \"Now don't you go jaw-wagging!\"    \"Well, I must say something! If Mr. Joynson--\"    \"Old Joynson may go and boil his head! I'm seventeen now. Look here,  Win, if you're going to turn sneak--\"    \"Sneak, indeed! Do I ever tell your secrets? Think what you did at Aunt  Harriet's!\"    Percy changed color.    \"You've not breathed a word about that?\"    \"Of course I haven't, but I'm always terrified that she'll find out.\"    \"It was a rocky little business. I say, Win, I was looking up wills in  'Every Man his Own Lawyer.' If Aunt Harriet died intestate all her  estate would go to her next-of-kin, and that's Uncle Herbert Beach out  in China. The mater wouldn't have a look-in, because her mother was only  Aunt Harriet's half-sister. Uncle Herbert would just get the lot. She  ought to make another will at once.\"    \"Had you better tell, then?\" faltered Winona.    \"Tell? Certainly not! But you might very well suggest it to her. You've  plenty of opportunities, as you're living there. Bring the conversation  round to wills, and ask casually if she's made hers.\"    \"Oh, I couldn't!\"    \"Yes, you could. You ought to do it, Winona. The mater stands to lose  everything as it is. It would probably make Aunt Harriet look inside the  drawer, and then she'd see her paper was gone.\"    \"And suspect us!\"    \"Why should she know we'd had anything to do with it? The servants might  have been rummaging. I certainly think it's your duty, Win, to take some  steps.\"    It was rather fine to hear Percy preaching duty on a subject in which he  was so plainly a defaulter. Winona at first indignantly repudiated the  task he wished to impose upon her. Nevertheless, the idea kept returning  and troubling her. She was sure Aunt Harriet ought to know that the will  had been destroyed, and if it was impossible to tell her outright, this  would certainly be a means of putting her on the track. Winona's whole  soul revolted from the notion of speculating upon possible advantages to  be gained from a relative's death. She would rather let Uncle Herbert  inherit everything than interfere for herself. But for her mother it was  a different matter. Aunt Harriet might wish her goddaughter to receive  part of her fortune, and to conceal the destruction of the will might  mean depriving Mrs. Woodward of a handsome legacy. How to make Miss  Beach realize the loss of the paper without getting Percy into trouble  was a problem that might have perplexed older and wiser heads.    Meanwhile it was holiday time, and there were many more pleasant  subjects to think about. Winona's Christmas present had been a small  hand camera, the very thing for which she had longed during the whole of  the past term. She contemplated it with the utmost satisfaction. Now she  would be able to join the Photographic Club at school, to go out on some  of the Saturday afternoon expeditions, and to have a few of her prints  in the Exhibition. She could take snap-shots of the girls and the  classroom, and make them into picture postcards to send to her mother,  and she could make a series of home photos to hang up in her bedroom at  Abbey Close. There seemed no limit indeed to the possibilities of her  new camera. She guarded it jealously from the prying fingers of the  younger members of the family.    \"Paws off!\" she commanded. \"Anybody who interferes with this Kodak will  quarrel with me, so I give you full and fair warning! Oh, yes, Dorrie!  I dare say you'd just like to press the button! I'd guarantee your fairy  fingers to smash anything! It's 'mustn't touch, only look' where this is  concerned. No personal familiarities, please!\"    December and January were scarcely propitious months for the taking of  snap-shots, but Winona attempted some time exposures, with varying  results. It was difficult to make the children realize the necessity of  keeping absolutely still, and they spoilt several of her plates by  grinning or moving. She secured quite a nice photo of the house,  however, and several of the village, and promised herself better luck  with family portraits when the summer came round again. She turned a  large cupboard in the attic into her dark-room, and spent many hours  dabbling among chemicals. She had urgent offers of help, but rejected  them steadfastly, greatly to the disappointment of her would-be  assistants. Her sanctum became a veritable Bluebeard's chamber, for to  prevent possible accidents she locked the door, and kept the key  perpetually in her pocket during the day time, sleeping with it under  her pillow at night. In the summer she meant to try all kinds of  experiments. She had visions of rigging up a shelter made of leaves and  branches, and taking a series of magnificent snap-shots of wild birds  and animals, like those in the books by Cherry Kearton, and she  certainly intended to secure records of the sports at school. In the  meantime she must content herself with landscape and still life. \"I'll  have one of the de Claremont tomb, at any rate,\" she resolved.    The de Claremont tomb was the glory of Ashbourne Church. It was of white  marble, and beautifully sculptured. Sir Guy de Claremont lay represented  in full armor, with his lady in ruff and coif by his side. Six sons and  four daughters, all kneeling, were carved in has relief round the side  of the monument. Long, long ago, in the Middle Ages, the de Claremonts  had been the great people of the neighborhood. They had fought in the  Crusades, had taken their part in the wars of the Barons, had declared  for the White Rose in the struggle with the House of Lancaster, and cast  in their lot for the King against Oliver Cromwell. The family was  extinct now, and their lands had passed to others, but a few tattered  banners and an old helmet still hung on the wall of the side chapel,  above the tomb, testifying to their former achievements. From her seat  in church Winona had a good view of the monument. She admired it  immensely, and had often woven romances about the good knights of old  who had carried those banners to the battle-field. She felt that she  would like to secure a satisfactory photo. She started off one morning  at about half-past eleven, when the light was likely to be best.    It was a sunny day, and wonderfully bright for January. She had meant to  go alone, but the children were on the look-out, and tracked her, so she  arrived at the church door closely followed by Letty, Mamie, Godfrey,  Ernie and Dorrie. She hesitated for a moment whether to send them  straight home or not, but the church was a mile from Highfield, and the  mill weir, a place of fascination to Ernie, lay on the way, so she  decided that it would be safest to let well alone.    \"They're imps, but they'll have to behave themselves decently in  church,\" she said to herself.    At present the conduct of the family was exemplary. They walked in on  tip-toe, and talked in whispers. Mamie, indeed, cast an envious eye  towards the forbidden ground of the pulpit, into which it was her  ambition some day to climb, and wave her arms about in imitation of the  Vicar, but she valiantly restrained her longings, and kept from the  neighborhood of the chancel. Letty took a surreptitious peep at the  organ, and was disappointed to find it locked, as was also the little  oak door that led up the winding staircase to the bell tower. She  decided that the parish clerk was much too attentive to his duties.    \"Come along over here, can't you?\" said Winona suspiciously. \"Leave  those hymn-books alone, and tell Dorrie she's not to touch the font, or  I'll stick her inside and pop the lid on her.
