On the day  before, winter reigned with all his severity; the day after exhibited  spring with all her charms. This pleasing transition beguiled my  impatience; and the agitations which had become habitual to my soul  were succeeded by that happy tranquillity, which is inspired by the  contemplation of the beauties and the gifts of nature.    A few leagues beyond Pontremoli the road is interrupted by a deep and  rapid stream. There is a ford across this torrent. It had scarcely  been indicated to me by my guides, beyond whom I had advanced, when I  dashed into the water; but instead of guiding my horse to the right  (as I ought to have done), I took the opposite direction. My guides,  who saw my mistake, screamed out in Italian, \"fermate, fermate!\" which  means, \"stop, stop!\" I thought it meant \"firm, firm!\" so I whipped and  spurred my horse with all my might; he lost his footing, and I  narrowly escaped drowning. When I reached the opposite shore my  guides treated me with a sermon, which I dare say was very energetic,  and in which the \"Devil and the Frenchman\" appeared to be the leading  actors.    I arrived on the **** at Lerici. I rejoiced when I saw the sea before  me, when I saw the last obstacle which was interposed between the  fulfilment of my hopes and the termination of my labours. But  unhappily my joy was of short duration; in the course of the night I  was attacked by an oppression on my chest, accompanied by a burning  fever: this was the result of the cold bath which I had taken in the  river. My mental sufferings were severe: I thought to myself, if I  should be so unlucky as to get an inflammation on my lungs, what will  become of me here without help, without friends, and in a strange  land? Ah, my beloved country! ah, my dear mother! have I left you  both, in order to perish in the arms of hirelings and of strangers!  Have I only reached the long wished-for shores of Spezzia but to  experience the grief of not being able to sail from them! Ah, if I  could but have reached the Emperor, if I could but have spoken to him,  if I could but have expired at his feet, then I should not have  regretted life! My devoted attachment would have been known; my memory  honoured; my name, linked to the destiny of the Emperor, would,  perhaps, have descended with his unto posterity.... I sent for a  doctor: by singular good fortune, the medical man who came to attend  me was a retired army surgeon, a worthy man, and a great admirer of  the French. When I was quite out of danger, he expressed a wish to  know the motives which had induced me to cross the mountains to  Lerici: and he gave me to understand that he guessed my views. A man  who speaks is always liable to less suspicion than a man who says  nothing; I therefore thought it right to allay the doctor's curiosity.  After exhorting him to secrecy, and making a great mystery of the  matter, I confessed that I was a Colonel in the French army, and that  an officer who held a high rank in the service of Napoleon had married  my sister. My sister, I proceeded to state, was so afflicted and  broken down by the expatriation of her husband, that her medical  attendants had declared her life to be in the greatest danger. My  sister's illness, and the care of her four small children, prevented  her from rejoining her husband; and therefore, in order to restore  health and happiness to my poor dear sister, I had determined to go to  Elba, for the purpose of reminding my brother-in-law of the duty which  he owed to his wife and children, and that I hoped to be able to  induce him to return to France, at least for a short time.    I took care to diversify my romance with sighs and sentimental  reflections, and it appeared to affect him exceedingly. He condoled  with me, he tried to console me; he gave me the most flattering hopes,  and he promised to serve me to the utmost of his power, and with all  his heart and soul.    As soon as I was in a state of convalescence, I became more ardent  than before, in search of an immediate opportunity of embarking. My  complaisant doctor introduced me to the captain of a running felucca,  and I hired his vessel for a fortnight.    The captain asked me for my passport, in order that he might receive  his \"_feuille de bord_\" and his \"_boletta_\" from the port officer.  This was in consequence of regulations of which I was wholly ignorant.  The fact is, that no vessel can clear out of one port, or enter  another, without a \"_feuille de bord_,\" stating the complement of the  crew, and the number of passengers; and a \"_boletta_,\" or certificate,  delivered by the health officers to each of the passengers and crew  individually, stating that the bearer has not been attacked by any  infectious disorder. These papers are only delivered on the  production of the passports, to which they must correspond exactly. I  did not expect this proceeding; my plans were all disorganized: my  passport did not authorize me to embark; and I was afraid if I  produced it, (for in such situations we are afraid of every thing),  that difficulties might arise, and that they would refer to the Consul  or his agents.    The Captain guessed the cause of my uneasiness, and he offered to  procure a passport and a _boletta_ under a feigned name. I refused: I  thought it more advisable to run the risk of being punished as a  Bonapartist than as an impostor. \"Since you will not do so,\" said the  captain, \"there is but one course which you can pursue: you must get  on board a boat, and pass for a common sailor. I will manage the  business for you.\"--Some hours afterwards the captain came to me with  a Gallo-Genoese sailor, who offered to take me, without any papers,  wherever I wished to go. He added, that he had a relation who was a  gunner on board the Inconstant, a brig belonging to Napoleon, and that  he should be very glad to see him again. I judged that my design of  going to Elba had got wind: I therefore determined, if possible, to  depart that very night. It was therefore agreed that Salviti, so the  sailor was called, should fetch me, and that we should put out to sea,  however bad the weather might prove.    Whilst these arrangements were going on my doctor paid me a visit. The  doctor told me that the commandant of the town, whom he attended, was  going to send a file of his carabineers to bring me before him in  order to ascertain the reason of my arrival, and of my residence on  the shores of the gulf. \"I told him,\" continued the doctor, \"that you  are unwell, and that you are going to your family in Corsica, and that  you intend to begin your voyage as soon as you are able to support the  fatigue. I think I have made him easier, yet don't trust him: be off  as quick as you can.\"--\"I shall be off to-night; but as your  commandant or his gensdarmes might take a fancy to lay hold of me  between this and then, I therefore think it will be more prudent for  me to go to him of my own accord, and to confirm the story which you  have had the goodness to tell him.\" Accordingly I went immediately to  the Commandant; and as the doctor had let me into the character of the  man, I easily succeeded in pleasing and tranquillizing him. However,  he made me promise that I would bring my passport to him to-morrow. I  gave as many promises as he could wish. At midnight we set sail; and  by break of day we had already lost sight of the gulf of Spezzia, and  of the majestic scenery which surrounds it. The bark which carried me  and all my fortunes was only a common boat with four oars and a lateen  sail. The crew consisted of six men; Salviti could speak French, and  he was a good-looking fellow: the countenances of the others displayed  want and utter profligacy. They examined me with great curiosity, and  they were constantly talking about me. Salviti interpreted their  discourse. I gave them civil language. We even seek to please sailors  when we are in need of their help[31]. I was sea-sick without  intermission; and to complete my misfortunes I had omitted to furnish  myself with provisions. I was therefore obliged to mess with my  companions; and their food consisted of stinking salt fish, and  chiefly of _bacalao_, or salt cod, which is eaten quite raw.                       [Footnote 31: On cherche a plaire meme a des                     matelots quand on a besoin d'eux.]    The wind was against us, therefore we did not come in sight of the  lighthouse of Leghorn until the morning of the second day. How can I  express my surprise and anger when I saw that our vessel was making  the mouth of the harbour! \"Salviti, where are you taking me?\"--\"To  Leghorn.\"--\"I won't go to Leghorn,\" I exclaimed with a great oath. \"It  is not to Leghorn that you promised to take me.\"--Salviti answered,  with confusion, that he was not the owner of the vessel, but that he  hired it in partnership with the rest of the crew, that they were all  smugglers, and that they were going to Leghorn for the purpose of  arranging an expedition of consequence with other smugglers there.  Their business would be soon settled, and then they would take me to  Porto Ferrajo; and he declared that he gave his word of honour that he  would do so, and that I might trust him.--\"I will not agree to all  this,\" I exclaimed, presenting my pistols to his breast: \"Let us go  straight on to Elba, or I will shoot you.\"--\"Shoot away, if you like,  but you will not do yourself much good: my companions will heave you  into the sea, or else you will be guillotined at Leghorn.\" The  coolness of the fellow completely disarmed me. \"Well, then,\" said I,  \"swear that you will take me to-morrow to the isle of Elba.\"--\"I have  told you already that I am a scoundrel if I break my word.\" The  sailors did not understand a word of our dialogue, nor could they  make out what was the cause of my fury. One of them, who had deserted  from the English navy, seized a big knife in the shape of a stiletto."]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/22352"],[0,"American Boy's Life of Theodore Roosevelt (#16)"],[1," some Spanish war-ships were  hovering around, ready to sink the transports as soon as they should  show themselves, and for five days the vessels remained in Port Tampa  Harbor, until it was ascertained that the report was untrue.    Those five days were important to Theodore Roosevelt and to the men  under him. Every day the young officer spent a certain portion of his  time in studying military tactics and in drilling his soldiers. Much had  still to be learned, and the officers had their school of instructions  as well as did those under them.    The weather was broiling hot, and some were already suffering from fever  or its symptoms. Fortunately bathing was good, and many went in once or  twice a day. Bathing in the ocean was great sport to some of the  plainsmen who had never seen anything larger than a river or creek, and  they frolicked around like children, and got up races, with prizes for  the best swimmers.    At last came the orders for the transports to set sail for Cuba. They  numbered thirty-two in all, including a schooner which was towed along  filled with drinking water, for water must be had, and that was the only  place where it could be stowed. To protect the transports from a  possible attack by the enemy, they were accompanied by five war-ships at  first, and later on by fourteen. All told, there were on the transports  eight hundred officers and sixteen thousand enlisted men. Of the  commands, the most were from the regular army, the volunteers numbering  but three--the Rough Riders, the Seventy-first New York Infantry, and  the Second Massachusetts Infantry.          CHAPTER XIV    LIFE ON THE TRANSPORT--THE LANDING AT DAIQUIRI--THE MARCH TO  SIBONEY--THE TRAIL THROUGH THE JUNGLE--THE SKIRMISH AT LA GUASIMA      While the army was preparing to invade Cuba, matters so far as they  concerned the navy had been moving along rapidly. Commodore Dewey had  sunk the Spanish fleet in Manila Bay; Havana and the adjacent coasts  were being blockaded, so no ships could pass in or out without running  the risk of capture; and a large fleet of war-ships under Admiral  Cervera, of the enemy's navy, had been \"bottled up\" in Santiago Harbor.    It had been decided that the United States troops should be landed on  the southeast coast of Cuba, not far from the entrance to Santiago Bay,  and from that point should make an advance on Santiago, which is the  second city of importance in the island.    Day after day the flotilla of transports kept on its way, spread out in  a broad column during the time it was light, and coming in close  together during the night. The war-ships hovered near, and at night  swept the ocean with their powerful search-lights, rendering a surprise  by the enemy impossible.    The trip to the southeast coast of Cuba lasted seven days. It was very  hot, even for this time of the year, and those who could, slept on deck  during the voyage. There was but little to do, and when not drilling,  the men took it easy in the shade,--sleeping, chatting, or playing  games. Sometimes they would talk of the future and wonder how much of  real fighting lay before them.    \"We didn't know even then where we were going,\" said one, in speaking of  the trip. \"I don't believe Wood or Roosevelt knew either. First we  thought it might be Havana, then we imagined it might be Porto Rico, but  when we turned southward and ran around the eastern end of the island,  we all knew we were bound for Santiago.\"    As the transports swept up toward the mouth of Santiago Bay, they came  within sight of the American war-ships that were keeping Admiral  Cervera's fleet \"bottled up\" in the harbor. A shout of recognition went  up, and one of the bands struck up a patriotic air that was truly  inspiring.    The landing of the Rough Riders and many other commands was made at  Daiquiri, a small settlement on the coast east of Santiago Harbor. The  _Yucatan_ got closer to the shore than most of the other transports, and  the men lost no time in disembarking, taking with them two Colt's  automatic guns and a dynamite gun of which they had become possessed. As  there had not been transports enough, only the officers' horses had been  brought along. These were thrown into the water and made to swim ashore.  Theodore Roosevelt had two horses, but one was drowned.    It was important that the landing should be guarded, and the war-ships  sent in some shot and shell to dislodge any Spaniards who might be in  the vicinity. But none showed themselves, and soon nearly all of the  soldiers were ashore, either at Daiquiri or at a landing a short  distance farther westward. No enemy was in sight, and the only persons  who appeared were some Cubans, soldiers and civilians, who wanted but  one thing, food.    The Rough Riders had been put into a brigade commanded by General S.B.M.  Young. There were two of these brigades, and it is worth noting that  they formed a division under the command of Major-General Joseph  Wheeler, who had in years gone by fought so gallantly on the side of the  Confederacy. Now, as brave as of old, he was fighting for Old Glory, the  one banner of the North and the South alike.    As the Rough Riders landed, they were marched up the beach, and here  they went into temporary camp,--an easy matter, since each soldier  carried his outfit with him, or, at least, as much as he could get of  what belonged to him. Theodore Roosevelt had his weapons and ammunition,  a mackintosh and a toothbrush, certainly much less than he had carried  even when roughing it in the Bad Lands of the West.    As soon as the larger portion of the army was landed, General Lawton--he  who was afterward to give his life for his flag in the Philippines--threw  out a strong detachment on the Santiago road to the westward, and also  detachments on the roads to the north and east.    \"On to Santiago!\" was the cry. And many were for pushing forward without  delay. But the transports had still to unload their baggage, and word  did not reach the Rough Riders to move on until the afternoon of the day  after landing.    It was a rocky, uneven country, with much brushwood and jungles of trees  and vines. It had rained, but now the sun came out fiercely, and the  Rough Riders (riders in name only, for only the officers were on  horseback) suffered greatly through being clad in winter uniform.    \"It was a tough and tiresome march,\" said one who was there. \"The air  just quivered with heat, and many of the boys felt like throwing half of  their clothing away. Whenever we reached a drinking place, the crowd  would swarm around for water like a lot of bees.    \"General Lawton had his outposts pretty well advanced. Our commander,  old General Wheeler, was just as anxious to make a showing, and he  ordered General Young to push on with the Rough Riders and some other  troops. So away we went, with Colonel Wood at our head, and  Lieutenant-Colonel Roosevelt in command of one squadron and Major Brodie  in command of the other. In some spots the road was frightful, full of  mud-holes, with big land crabs crawling around in all directions, and  with the trailing vines full of poisonous spiders. We didn't know but  that the woods might be full of Spaniards, and we were on the alert to  give the Dons as good as they sent, should they show themselves.\"    By nightfall the Rough Riders reached the little village of Siboney  without having met the enemy. Here they went into camp in the midst of a  heavy thunder-storm in which every soldier and officer was drenched to  the skin. Fires could scarcely be lighted, and it was not until the  storm had partly cleared away that the cooks could prepare anything to  eat. Surely being a soldier was not all glory after all.    It had been learned that a portion of the Spanish army was less than  four miles away, and General Young was ordered by General Wheeler to  move forward at daybreak and engage the enemy. Colonel Wood received  orders to move the Rough Riders by a trail over a hill, beyond which the  country sloped toward the bay and the city of Santiago.    The first encounter with the enemy occurred at a place called La Guasima  (or Las Guasimas), so called on account of trees of that name growing in  the vicinity. Here the Spaniards had rifle-pits and mounds of earth to  shelter them and had likewise the sugar-house of a plantation. They had  been watching for the coming of the _Americanos_ eagerly, and were  determined to give our soldiers a lesson not to be forgotten. They knew  that our army had not been in active warfare for years, and felt certain  that they would soon be able to make the \"paper\" soldiers retreat.    The Rough Riders found the way led up a steep hill, and the pace was so  fast that before the firing line was reached some men fell out from  exhaustion. Theodore Roosevelt was at the head of the first squadron and  did his best to urge those under him forward. There was an advance  guard, led by some men under Sergeant Hamilton Fish, and Captain  Capron's troop, and soon a crash of firearms notified all that a fight  was on.    Orders were at once issued to fill the magazines of the guns, and this  was done. Then, while some troops moved to the left of the trail,  Lieutenant-Colonel Roosevelt was ordered to take three troops to the  right. Here the jungle was heavy, and no sooner had the Rough Riders  advanced than the Spaniards opened fire upon them. In speaking of the  opening of this fight, Mr. Roosevelt himself writes:--    \"The effect of the smokeless powder (used by the enemy) was remarkable.  The air seemed full of the rustling sound of the Mauser bullets, for the  Spaniards knew the trails by which we were advancing, and opened heavily  on our position. But they themselves were entirely invisible. The jungle  covered everything, and not the faintest trace of smoke was to be seen  in any direction, to indicate from whence the bullets came.\"    It was certainly a trying time--to stand"]]]
