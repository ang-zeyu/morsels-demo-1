But it was also, as we have seen, a very localized  thing, especially in the Middle Ages. And that very lively localism the  Christian faith and affections encouraged led at last to an excessive  and exclusive parochialism. There were rival shrines of the same saint,  and a sort of duel between two statues of the same divinity. By a  process it is now our difficult duty to follow, a real estrangement  between European peoples began. Men began to feel that foreigners did  not eat or drink like Christians, and even, when the philosophic schism  came, to doubt if they were Christians.    There was, indeed, much more than this involved. While the internal  structure of mediaevalism was thus parochial and largely popular, in the  greater affairs, and especially the external affairs, such as peace and  war, most (though by no means all) of what was mediaeval was monarchical.  To see what the kings came to mean we must glance back at the great  background, as of darkness and daybreak, against which the first figures  of our history have already appeared. That background was the war with  the barbarians. While it lasted Christendom was not only one nation but  more like one city--and a besieged city. Wessex was but one wall or  Paris one tower of it; and in one tongue and spirit Bede might have  chronicled the siege of Paris or Abbo sung the song of Alfred. What  followed was a conquest and a conversion; all the end of the Dark Ages  and the dawn of mediaevalism is full of the evangelizing of barbarism.  And it is the paradox of the Crusades that though the Saracen was  superficially more civilized than the Christian, it was a sound instinct  which saw him also to be in spirit a destroyer. In the simpler case of  northern heathenry the civilization spread with a simplier progress. But  it was not till the end of the Middle Ages, and close on the  Reformation, that the people of Prussia, the wild land lying beyond  Germany, were baptized at all. A flippant person, if he permitted  himself a profane confusion with vaccination, might almost be inclined  to suggest that for some reason it didn't \"take\" even then.    The barbarian peril was thus brought under bit by bit, and even in the  case of Islam the alien power which could not be crushed was evidently  curbed. The Crusades became hopeless, but they also became needless. As  these fears faded the princes of Europe, who had come together to face  them, were left facing each other. They had more leisure to find that  their own captaincies clashed; but this would easily have been  overruled, or would have produced a petty riot, had not the true  creative spontaneity, of which we have spoken in the local life, tended  to real variety. Royalties found they were representatives almost  without knowing it; and many a king insisting on a genealogical tree or  a title-deed found he spoke for the forests and the songs of a whole  country-side. In England especially the transition is typified in the  accident which raised to the throne one of the noblest men of the Middle  Ages.    Edward I. came clad in all the splendours of his epoch. He had taken the  Cross and fought the Saracens; he had been the only worthy foe of Simon  de Montfort in those baronial wars which, as we have seen, were the  first sign (however faint) of a serious theory that England should be  ruled by its barons rather than its kings. He proceeded, like Simon de  Montfort, and more solidly, to develop the great mediaeval institution of  a parliament. As has been said, it was superimposed on the existing  parish democracies, and was first merely the summoning of local  representatives to advise on local taxation. Indeed its rise was one  with the rise of what we now call taxation; and there is thus a thread  of theory leading to its latter claims to have the sole right of taxing.  But in the beginning it was an instrument of the most equitable kings,  and notably an instrument of Edward I. He often quarrelled with his  parliaments and may sometimes have displeased his people (which has  never been at all the same thing), but on the whole he was supremely the  representative sovereign. In this connection one curious and difficult  question may be considered here, though it marks the end of a story  that began with the Norman Conquest. It is pretty certain that he was  never more truly a representative king, one might say a republican king,  than in the fact that he expelled the Jews. The problem is so much  misunderstood and mixed with notions of a stupid spite against a gifted  and historic race as such, that we must pause for a paragraph upon it.    The Jews in the Middle Ages were as powerful as they were unpopular.  They were the capitalists of the age, the men with wealth banked ready  for use. It is very tenable that in this way they were useful; it is  certain that in this way they were used. It is also quite fair to say  that in this way they were ill-used. The ill-usage was not indeed that  suggested at random in romances, which mostly revolve on the one idea  that their teeth were pulled out. Those who know this as a story about  King John generally do not know the rather important fact that it was a  story against King John. It is probably doubtful; it was only insisted  on as exceptional; and it was, by that very insistence, obviously  regarded as disreputable. But the real unfairness of the Jews' position  was deeper and more distressing to a sensitive and highly civilized  people. They might reasonably say that Christian kings and nobles, and  even Christian popes and bishops, used for Christian purposes (such as  the Crusades and the cathedrals) the money that could only be  accumulated in such mountains by a usury they inconsistently denounced  as unchristian; and then, when worse times came, gave up the Jew to the  fury of the poor, whom that useful usury had ruined. That was the real  case for the Jew; and no doubt he really felt himself oppressed.  Unfortunately it was the case for the Christians that they, with at  least equal reason, felt him as the oppressor; and that _mutual_ charge  of tyranny is the Semitic trouble in all times. It is certain that in  popular sentiment, this Anti-Semitism was not excused as  uncharitableness, but simply regarded as charity. Chaucer puts his curse  on Hebrew cruelty into the mouth of the soft-hearted prioress, who wept  when she saw a mouse in a trap; and it was when Edward, breaking the  rule by which the rulers had hitherto fostered their bankers' wealth,  flung the alien financiers out of the land, that his people probably saw  him most plainly at once as a knight errant and a tender father of his  people.    Whatever the merits of this question, such a portrait of Edward was far  from false. He was the most just and conscientious type of mediaeval  monarch; and it is exactly this fact that brings into relief the new  force which was to cross his path and in strife with which he died.  While he was just, he was also eminently legal. And it must be  remembered, if we would not merely read back ourselves into the past,  that much of the dispute of the time was legal; the adjustment of  dynastic and feudal differences not yet felt to be anything else. In  this spirit Edward was asked to arbitrate by the rival claimants to the  Scottish crown; and in this sense he seems to have arbitrated quite  honestly. But his legal, or, as some would say, pedantic mind made the  proviso that the Scottish king as such was already under his suzerainty,  and he probably never understood the spirit he called up against him;  for that spirit had as yet no name. We call it to-day Nationalism.  Scotland resisted; and the adventures of an outlawed knight named  Wallace soon furnished it with one of those legends which are more  important than history. In a way that was then at least equally  practical, the Catholic priests of Scotland became especially the  patriotic and Anti-English party; as indeed they remained even  throughout the Reformation. Wallace was defeated and executed; but the  heather was already on fire; and the espousal of the new national cause  by one of Edward's own knights named Bruce, seemed to the old king a  mere betrayal of feudal equity. He died in a final fury at the head of a  new invasion upon the very border of Scotland. With his last words the  great king commanded that his bones should be borne in front of the  battle; and the bones, which were of gigantic size, were eventually  buried with the epitaph, \"Here lies Edward the Tall, who was the hammer  of the Scots.\" It was a true epitaph, but in a sense exactly opposite to  its intention. He was their hammer, but he did not break but make them;  for he smote them on an anvil and he forged them into a sword.    That coincidence or course of events, which must often be remarked in  this story, by which (for whatever reason) our most powerful kings did  not somehow leave their power secure, showed itself in the next reign,  when the baronial quarrels were resumed and the northern kingdom, under  Bruce, cut itself finally free by the stroke of Bannockburn. Otherwise  the reign is a mere interlude, and it is with the succeeding one that we  find the new national tendency yet further developed. The great French  wars, in which England won so much glory, were opened by Edward III.,  and grew more and more nationalist. But even to feel the transition of  the time we must first realize that the third Edward made as strictly  legal and dynastic a claim to France as the first Edward had made to  Scotland; the claim was far weaker in substance, but it was equally  conventional in form. He thought, or said, he had a claim on a kingdom  as a squire might say he "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/209"],[0,"The Turn of the Screw (#16)"],[1,"ng, tablelike tomb.    \"Yes, if you didn't--?\"    He looked, while I waited, at the graves. \"Well, you know what!\" But  he didn't move, and he presently produced something that made me drop  straight down on the stone slab, as if suddenly to rest. \"Does my uncle  think what YOU think?\"    I markedly rested. \"How do you know what I think?\"    \"Ah, well, of course I don't; for it strikes me you never tell me. But I  mean does HE know?\"    \"Know what, Miles?\"    \"Why, the way I'm going on.\"    I perceived quickly enough that I could make, to this inquiry, no answer  that would not involve something of a sacrifice of my employer. Yet it  appeared to me that we were all, at Bly, sufficiently sacrificed to make  that venial. \"I don't think your uncle much cares.\"    Miles, on this, stood looking at me. \"Then don't you think he can be  made to?\"    \"In what way?\"    \"Why, by his coming down.\"    \"But who'll get him to come down?\"    \"_I_ will!\" the boy said with extraordinary brightness and emphasis. He  gave me another look charged with that expression and then marched off  alone into church.          XV      The business was practically settled from the moment I never followed  him. It was a pitiful surrender to agitation, but my being aware of this  had somehow no power to restore me. I only sat there on my tomb and read  into what my little friend had said to me the fullness of its meaning;  by the time I had grasped the whole of which I had also embraced, for  absence, the pretext that I was ashamed to offer my pupils and the rest  of the congregation such an example of delay. What I said to myself  above all was that Miles had got something out of me and that the proof  of it, for him, would be just this awkward collapse. He had got out  of me that there was something I was much afraid of and that he should  probably be able to make use of my fear to gain, for his own purpose,  more freedom. My fear was of having to deal with the intolerable  question of the grounds of his dismissal from school, for that was  really but the question of the horrors gathered behind. That his uncle  should arrive to treat with me of these things was a solution that,  strictly speaking, I ought now to have desired to bring on; but I  could so little face the ugliness and the pain of it that I simply  procrastinated and lived from hand to mouth. The boy, to my deep  discomposure, was immensely in the right, was in a position to say  to me: \"Either you clear up with my guardian the mystery of this  interruption of my studies, or you cease to expect me to lead with you  a life that's so unnatural for a boy.\" What was so unnatural for the  particular boy I was concerned with was this sudden revelation of a  consciousness and a plan.    That was what really overcame me, what prevented my going in. I walked  round the church, hesitating, hovering; I reflected that I had already,  with him, hurt myself beyond repair. Therefore I could patch up nothing,  and it was too extreme an effort to squeeze beside him into the pew: he  would be so much more sure than ever to pass his arm into mine and make  me sit there for an hour in close, silent contact with his commentary  on our talk. For the first minute since his arrival I wanted to get away  from him. As I paused beneath the high east window and listened to the  sounds of worship, I was taken with an impulse that might master me,  I felt, completely should I give it the least encouragement. I might  easily put an end to my predicament by getting away altogether. Here  was my chance; there was no one to stop me; I could give the whole thing  up--turn my back and retreat. It was only a question of hurrying again,  for a few preparations, to the house which the attendance at church of  so many of the servants would practically have left unoccupied. No one,  in short, could blame me if I should just drive desperately off. What  was it to get away if I got away only till dinner? That would be in  a couple of hours, at the end of which--I had the acute prevision--my  little pupils would play at innocent wonder about my nonappearance in  their train.    \"What DID you do, you naughty, bad thing? Why in the world, to worry us  so--and take our thoughts off, too, don't you know?--did you desert us  at the very door?\" I couldn't meet such questions nor, as they asked  them, their false little lovely eyes; yet it was all so exactly what I  should have to meet that, as the prospect grew sharp to me, I at last  let myself go.    I got, so far as the immediate moment was concerned, away; I came  straight out of the churchyard and, thinking hard, retraced my steps  through the park. It seemed to me that by the time I reached the house  I had made up my mind I would fly. The Sunday stillness both of the  approaches and of the interior, in which I met no one, fairly excited  me with a sense of opportunity. Were I to get off quickly, this way, I  should get off without a scene, without a word. My quickness would have  to be remarkable, however, and the question of a conveyance was the  great one to settle. Tormented, in the hall, with difficulties  and obstacles, I remember sinking down at the foot of the  staircase--suddenly collapsing there on the lowest step and then, with a  revulsion, recalling that it was exactly where more than a month before,  in the darkness of night and just so bowed with evil things, I had  seen the specter of the most horrible of women. At this I was able  to straighten myself; I went the rest of the way up; I made, in my  bewilderment, for the schoolroom, where there were objects belonging to  me that I should have to take. But I opened the door to find again, in a  flash, my eyes unsealed. In the presence of what I saw I reeled straight  back upon my resistance.    Seated at my own table in clear noonday light I saw a person whom,  without my previous experience, I should have taken at the first blush  for some housemaid who might have stayed at home to look after the place  and who, availing herself of rare relief from observation and of the  schoolroom table and my pens, ink, and paper, had applied herself to the  considerable effort of a letter to her sweetheart. There was an effort  in the way that, while her arms rested on the table, her hands with  evident weariness supported her head; but at the moment I took this in  I had already become aware that, in spite of my entrance, her attitude  strangely persisted. Then it was--with the very act of its announcing  itself--that her identity flared up in a change of posture. She rose,  not as if she had heard me, but with an indescribable grand melancholy  of indifference and detachment, and, within a dozen feet of me, stood  there as my vile predecessor. Dishonored and tragic, she was all before  me; but even as I fixed and, for memory, secured it, the awful image  passed away. Dark as midnight in her black dress, her haggard beauty and  her unutterable woe, she had looked at me long enough to appear to say  that her right to sit at my table was as good as mine to sit at hers.  While these instants lasted, indeed, I had the extraordinary chill of  feeling that it was I who was the intruder. It was as a wild protest  against it that, actually addressing her--\"You terrible, miserable  woman!\"--I heard myself break into a sound that, by the open door, rang  through the long passage and the empty house. She looked at me as if  she heard me, but I had recovered myself and cleared the air. There was  nothing in the room the next minute but the sunshine and a sense that I  must stay.          XVI      I had so perfectly expected that the return of my pupils would be marked  by a demonstration that I was freshly upset at having to take into  account that they were dumb about my absence. Instead of gaily  denouncing and caressing me, they made no allusion to my having failed  them, and I was left, for the time, on perceiving that she too said  nothing, to study Mrs. Grose's odd face. I did this to such purpose that  I made sure they had in some way bribed her to silence; a silence that,  however, I would engage to break down on the first private opportunity.  This opportunity came before tea: I secured five minutes with her in the  housekeeper's room, where, in the twilight, amid a smell of lately baked  bread, but with the place all swept and garnished, I found her sitting  in pained placidity before the fire. So I see her still, so I see her  best: facing the flame from her straight chair in the dusky, shining  room, a large clean image of the \"put away\"--of drawers closed and  locked and rest without a remedy.    \"Oh, yes, they asked me to say nothing; and to please them--so long as  they were there--of course I promised. But what had happened to you?\"    \"I only went with you for the walk,\" I said. \"I had then to come back to  meet a friend.\"    She showed her surprise. \"A friend--YOU?\"    \"Oh, yes, I have a couple!\" I laughed. \"But did the children give you a  reason?\"    \"For not alluding to your leaving us? Yes; they said you would like it  better. Do you like it better?\"    My face had made her rueful. \"No, I like it worse!\" But after an instant  I added: \"Did they say why I should like it better?\"    \"No; Master Miles only said, 'We must do nothing but what she likes!'\"    \"I wish indeed he would. And what did Flora say?\"    \"Miss Flora was too sweet. She said, 'Oh, of course, of course!'--and I  said the same.\"    I thought a moment. \"You were too sweet, too--I can hear you all. But  nonetheless, between Miles and me, it's now all out.\"    \"All out?\" My companion stared. \"But what, miss?\"    \"Everything. It doesn't matter. I've made up my mind. I came home, my  dear,\" I went on, \"for a talk with Miss Jessel.\"    I had by this time formed the habit of having Mrs. Grose literally well  in hand in advance of my sounding that note; so that even now, as  she bravely blinked under the signal of my word, I could keep her"]]]
