(#16)"],[1,"true of  his work, _The Theory of Evolution_.      _Principal Dawson._    Dr. Dawson, as we are informed, is regarded as the first palaeontologist,  and among the first geologists, in America. In his \"Story of Earth and  Man,\"[39] he passes in review the several geological periods  recognized by geologists; describes as far as knowable the distribution  of land and water during each period, and the vegetable and animal  productions by which they were distinguished. His book from beginning to  end is anti-Darwinian. In common with other naturalists, his attention  is directed principally to the doctrine of evolution, which he endeavors  to prove is utterly untenable. That Mr. Darwin's theory excludes  teleology is everywhere assumed as an uncontroverted and  uncontrovertible fact. \"The evolutionist doctrine,\" he says, \"is itself  one of the strangest phenomena of humanity. It existed, and most  naturally, in the oldest philosophy and poetry, in connection with the  crudest and most uncritical attempts of the human mind to grasp the  system of nature; but that in our day a system destitute of any shadow  of proof, and supported merely by vague analogies and figures of speech,  and by the arbitrary and artificial coherence of its own parts, should  be accepted as philosophy, and should find able adherents to string on  its thread of hypotheses our vast and weighty stores of knowledge, is  surpassingly strange.... In many respects these speculations are  important, and worthy the attention of thinking men. They seek to  revolutionize the religious belief of the world, and if accepted would  destroy most of the existing theology and philosophy. They indicate  tendencies among scientific thinkers, which, though probably temporary,  must, before they disappear, descend to lower strata, and reproduce  themselves in grosser forms, and with most serious effects on the whole  structure of society. With one class of minds they constitute a sort of  religion, which so far satisfies the craving for truth higher than those  which relate to immediate wants and pleasures. With another and perhaps  larger class, they are accepted as affording a welcome deliverance from  all scruples of conscience and fears of a hereafter. In the domain of  science evolutionism has like tendencies. It reduces the position of  man, who becomes a descendant of inferior animals, and a mere term in a  series whose end is unknown. It removes from the study of nature the  ideas of final cause and purpose; and the evolutionist, instead of  regarding the world as a work of consummate plan, skill, and adjustment,  approaches nature as he would a chaos of fallen rocks, which may present  forms of castles, and grotesque profiles of men and animals, but they  are all fortuitous and without significance.\" (pp. 317, 318)    \"Taking, then, this broad view of the subject, two great leading  alternatives are presented to us. Either man is an independent product  of the will of a Higher Intelligence, acting directly or through the  laws and materials of his own institution and production, or he has been  produced by an unconscious evolution from lower things. It is true that  many evolutionists, either unwilling to offend, or not perceiving the  logical consequences of their own hypothesis, endeavor to steer a middle  course, and to maintain that the Creator has proceeded by way of  evolution. But the bare, hard logic of Spencer, the greatest English  authority on evolution, leaves no place for this compromise, and shows  that the theory, carried out to its legitimate consequences, excludes  the knowledge of a Creator and the possibility of his work. We have,  therefore, to choose between evolution and creation, bearing in mind,  however, that there may be a place in nature for evolution, properly  limited, as well as for other things, and that the idea of creation by  no means excludes law and second causes.\" (p. 321)    \"It may be said, that evolution may be held as a scientific doctrine in  connection with a modified belief in creation. The work of actual  creation may have been limited to a few elementary types, and evolution  may have done the rest. Evolutionists may still be theists. We have  already seen that the doctrine, as carried out to its logical  consequences, excludes creation and theism. It may, however, be shown  that even in its more modified form, and when held by men who maintain  that they are not atheists, it is practically atheistic, because  excluding the idea of plan and design, and resolving all things into the  action of unintelligent forces. It is necessary to observe this, because  it is the half-way-evolutionism, which professes to have a creator  somewhere behind it, that is most popular; though it is, if possible,  more unphilosophical than that which professes to set out with absolute  and determined nonentity, or from self-existing stardust containing all  the possibilities of the universe.\"    In reference to the objection of evolutionists, that the origin of every  new species, on the theistic doctrine, supposes \"a miracle,\" an  intervention of the divine efficiency without the agency of second  causes, Principal Dawson asks, \"What is the actual statement of the  theory of creation as it may be held by a modern man of science? Simply  this: that all things have been produced by the Supreme Creative will,  acting either directly, or through the agency of the forces and material  of his own production.\" (p. 340)    He thus sums up his argument against the doctrine of evolution,  specially in its application to man: \"Finally, the evolutionist picture  wants some of the fairest lineaments of humanity, and cheats us with the  semblance of man without the reality. Shave and paint your ape as you  may, clothe him and set him up upon his feet, still he fails greatly of  the 'human form divine;' and so it is with him morally and spiritually  as well. We have seen that he wants the instinct of immortality, the  love of God, the mental and spiritual power of exercising dominion over  the earth. The very agency by which he is evolved is of itself  subversive of all these higher properties; the struggle for existence is  essentially selfish, and, therefore, degrading. Even in the lower  animals, it is a false assumption that its tendency is to elevate; for  animals, when driven to the utmost verge of the struggle for life,  become depauperated and degraded. The dog which spends its life in  snarling contention with its fellow curs for insufficient food, will not  be a noble specimen of its race. God does not so treat his creatures.  There is far more truth to nature in the doctrine which represents Him  as listening to the young ravens when they cry for food. But as applied  to man, the theory of the struggle for existence, and survival of the  fittest, though the most popular phase of evolutionism at present, is  nothing less than the basest and most horrible of superstitions. It  makes man not merely carnal but devilish. It takes his lowest appetites  and propensities, and makes them his God and Creator. His higher  sentiments and aspirations, his self-denying philanthropy, his  enthusiasm for the good and true, all the struggles and sufferings of  heroes and martyrs, not to speak of that self-sacrifice which is the  foundation of Christianity, are, in the view of the evolutionist, mere  loss and waste, failure in the struggle of life. What does he give us in  exchange? An endless pedigree of bestial ancestors, without one gleam of  high and holy tradition to enliven the procession; and for the future,  the prospect that the poor mass of protoplasm, which constitutes the sum  of our being, and which is the sole gain of an indefinite struggle in  the past, must soon be resolved again into inferior animals or dead  matter. That men of thought and culture should advocate such a  philosophy, argues either a strange mental hallucination, or that the  higher spiritual nature has been wholly quenched within them. It is one  of the saddest of many sad spectacles which our age presents.\" (p. 395)    FOOTNOTE:    [39] _The Story of Earth and Man_. By J. W. Dawson, LL. D., F. R. S., F.  G.

London, 1873,  pp. 397.      _Relation of Darwinism to Religion._    The consideration of that subject would lead into the wide field of the  relation between science and religion. Into that field we lack  competency and time to enter; a few remarks, however, on the subject  may not be out of place. Those remarks, we would fain make in a humble  way irenical. There is need of an Irenicum, for the fact is painfully  notorious that there is an antagonism between scientific men as a class,  and religious men as a class. Of course this opposition is neither felt  nor expressed by all on either side. Nevertheless, whatever may be the  cause of this antagonism, or whoever are to be blamed for it, there can  be no doubt that it exists and that it is an evil.    The first cause of the alienation in question is, that the two parties,  so to speak, adopt different rules of evidence, and thus can hardly  avoid arriving at different conclusions. To understand this we must  determine what is meant by science, and by scientific evidence. Science,  according to its etymology, is simply knowledge. But usage has limited  its meaning, in the first place, not to the knowledge of facts or  phenomena, merely, but to their causes and relations. It was said of  old, \"[Greek: hoti] scientiae fundamentum, [Greek: dioti] fastigium.\" No  amount of materials would constitute a building. They must be duly  arranged so as to make a symmetrical whole. No amount of disconnected  data can constitute a science. Those data must be systematized in their  relation to each other and to other things.

But suddenly, after the armistice, a new edition of the Nilus book  containing the \"protocols,\" dated 1917, made its appearance as suitable  to the chaotic conditions that prevailed in Russia and during the past  two years, as has been shown, it was reproduced in various countries.  This time the antisemitic propagandists are trying to connect the  \"protocols\" directly with Theodore Herzl and the Zionist movement. The  war, the peace treaty and bolshevism are characterized as the  fulfillment of these \"protocols\" which they say had been devised no less  than 929 years before the birth of Christ, by Solomon and other Sages.  The present \"protocols\" have been elaborated from the  \"Retcliffe-Goedsche\" versions by the Russian secret police department  and the Black Hundreds who ascribed all the evils in the world to the  Jews.    The Black Hundred writer, G. Butmi, whose book \"Enemies of the Human  Race,\" containing the fabricated speech by a \"famous Rabbi\" side by side  with the \"protocols,\" gives several characteristic passages in his  introduction that will convey to the reader a clear conception of the  type of men who have stood behind the movement to discredit the Jews  through the so-called \"protocols.\"    On page 36 of this volume, Butmi wrote:         \"The French Revolution, which ended in the execution of Louis XVI       in 1793, was engineered by England with the aid of the Jews and the       Judaized Masons. Only the Jews profited by the French Revolution,       even as they profited by the English Revolution, attaining in the       general turmoil equal rights with the native population of France.\"    Discussing the traits of the English people and finding a similarity  between them and the Jews, Butmi said on page 38:         \"The British traits are well known all over the world--their       exceptional selfishness, their inhuman cruelty to foreigners, their       inherent instinct of exploitation, their theoretical stupidity are       mingled with practical shrewdness and utter brazenness.\"    On page 39 he said:         \"Meanwhile the Britons have not distinguished themselves in       anything, if we are not to take into consideration the fact that       being thoroughly incapable of creating their own language, they       have by their talent to distort languages given to the present       English people a repulsive Judeo-Carthaginian imprint through their       shameless self-satisfaction, arrogance and treacherous       inclinations.\"    On page 41 he said:         \"In 1843 the first lodge of the new Jewish union 'Bnai Brith' was       organized in New York. Gradually this Jewish 'Bnai Brith'       concentrates in its hands the direction of all Masonic lodges in       America, and through them it directs American politics.\"    [Illustration: Cyrillic    FACSIMILE OF A NILUS PROTOCOL PUBLISHED IN 1905.

For this reason we must destroy all other  religions. If thereby should emerge contemporary atheists, then, as a  transition step, this will not interfere with our aims. It will serve as  an example to coming generations who will listen to the teachings of the  Mosaic religion. By its sound and reasonable system, we have achieved  the subjugation of all nations.

The shortcomings of the Gentile administrations will be  pictured by us in the darkest colors. We will sow such antipathy toward  their governments that the masses will prefer peace in a condition of  servitude to the rights of the so-called liberty which so tormented them  and destroyed the very springs of human existence and which were  exploited by a host of adventures, not realizing what they were doing.  The masses will become so satiated with the endless changes of  administration, which we instigated among the Gentiles when we were  undermining their governmental institutions, that they will tolerate  anything from us rather than risk undergoing again such struggle and  hardships. We will especially emphasize the historical mistakes of the  Gentile administrations which caused mankind to suffer for many  centuries through lack of real understanding in all that concerned its  true welfare, pursuing fantastic projects of social welfare and not  noticing that these projects made worse instead of better the state of  general relationships which are the basis of human existences.    \"The chief strength of our principles and measures will lie in that they  are put forward and interpreted by us as a sharp contrast to the old and  decayed order of society.    \"Our philosophers will discuss all the shortcomings of the Gentile  religions, but no one will be allowed to discuss our religion from the  true point of view except our own people.
