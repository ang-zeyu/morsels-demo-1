Then she begins to dig a  tunnel, humming away to herself all the time. After the hole is ready  she very carefully backs out of it and puts a circular door on.    \"Then she flies away to find food to store up for her children. These  babies like tender, green inch-worms, so Mrs. Digger-Wasp hunts around  until she finds a fat one, and then proceeds to paralyze it, so that it  will stay quietly in the house until the babies are ready to eat it, for  baby digger-wasps are little cannibals, preferring living caterpillars  to any pre-digested spiders or flies. It is very wonderful that Mrs.  Digger-Wasp knows where to sting a caterpillar in order to paralyze it  and yet not kill it. But she does. Perhaps you remember that insects  have knots of nerve cells, connected by nerve threads, extending from  one end of the body to the other? Jimmie remembers that I pinched him to  illustrate this point. The knot on the top of the food-tubes is the  brain, then underneath there are usually three in the thorax and several  in the abdomen. Well, Mrs. Digger-Wasp stings one or more of these  little knots, which we call ganglia. That paralyzes the young inch-worm,  so that it becomes limp and helpless, but still lives. Then Mrs. Wasp  picks it up and carries it to her house, and packs it in the bottom of  the tunnel.    \"After putting in five or ten she lays an egg, fastening it on the body  of one of the worms. She backs out of the tunnel, and flies off to  collect balls of dirt. With these she fills up the tunnel completely.  Carefully she puts the little round door on. One day some one saw her do  a curious thing. She wished to be very sure that the door was fast shut.  Perhaps it did not fit well. So she found a tiny pebble, held it in her  jaws, and hammered the door down with it. Wasn't that a clever thing for  a wasp to do? The door closed, this is all the attention she gives to  baby digger-wasps. She has put in plenty of food, even for the hungriest  larva. Now it must look out for itself, eat, grow fat and strong, and  then dig its way out into the salt-marsh.    \"Mrs. Eumenes is a good-looking little wasp dressed in black and yellow.  She is a mason, making a pretty mud vase for a home. The clay, or mud,  she moistens, then moulds it, little by little, into the vase, which she  fastens on to a twig. Some mud-daubers make small cylinders placed side  by side. Into these they put stung spiders, after tearing off their legs  to make sure they will not recover and run away before the eggs hatch.  Sometimes the mud-daubers plaster up the keyholes in a house, and so  have snug homes.    \"One day last summer, as I was sitting outside my cabin, I noticed a  wasp carrying something green in its mouth. It came close to my head,  then finally crawled up under the shingles on the side wall. All the  afternoon it came and went, each time bringing something green. The next  afternoon I was loading my guns, and had put a hollow gun-barrel on a  table at my side. Soon I heard a whir of insect wings, and there, on the  table, was my wasp friend. It walked up and down, examining very  carefully the hollow barrel, then cautiously it crawled in. In about  five minutes it crawled out again and flew away. Soon it was back with a  piece of green in its mouth. It crawled into the barrel and left the  green. Six times the wasp did this; then my curiosity became so great I  could wait no longer. When she flew away I tapped the barrel on the  table and emptied out six little green worms, all limp and still. But  Mrs. Wasp was back again, and I guiltily withdrew. She had brought the  seventh worm, and when she saw the six lying on the table she was much  puzzled. She went around and poked each one to see whether it was limp,  fearing, perhaps, that she had not stung them hard enough; but, finding  them helpless, she picked them up one by one and patiently carried them  back into the gun-barrel. Three times I emptied them out, and three  times she put them back, then flew away, never to return. I suppose the  last time she went in she laid the egg among the little worms, and then,  her duty done, was off to find another good place to start a family.    \"Have you ever seen a big cicada which makes the long, rasping sound in  the trees? Some wasps like these very much for food. So, when cicada  sings, Mrs. Wasp swoops down on it, stings it, and then, big and clumsy  as it is, carries it to her home for her children to feast upon.\"    \"A cicada is three or four times as large as a wasp, isn't it?\" asked  Mrs. Reece.    \"Yes; but there is nothing the wasps can't do,\" replied Ben Gile.    \"I should think not!\" exclaimed Peter, who by this time was able to  smile again.    \"The trout are ready, Ben,\" said Adam, \"and everything else, too, I  guess.\"    With running and laughter the children were soon about the fire, eating  their last delicious out-of-door dinner.          XVI    EYES AND NO EYES      The evening party at Ben Gile's cabin was to be the last of all the  beautiful summer, for the next day Betty and Jimmie were to leave with  their mother for the city, and this was the evening which was to decide  who was to receive the prize.    Betty had been working very hard for it, and wanted it. But Jimmie  couldn't see any use in lying with your nose on an ant-hill. As for  Peter, he giggled whenever ants were mentioned to him, and seemed not to  care much one way or another. Hope, however, was often with Betty, and  the two girls, flat on the grass, tried to discover as many mysteries as  they could about the busy little fellows. As for Jack, he was as busy as  the ants, following them about, lying quietly for hours, and borrowing  any book he could find that would tell about them. It seemed to him that  if he could have that magnifying-glass, that book of colored plates,  and the five-dollar gold piece, he would be the richest boy in all the  world! He thought about it by night and by day, and he was certain that  with the insect book and the glass, he should discover things nobody  else in the world had ever seen.    The poor boy was trembling with eagerness on this evening of the party  at the guide's cabin. The children took their turn in telling what they  knew. Peter giggled, and said they seemed to lug a good deal of food.  Jimmie said they ran in and out of their ant hills very fast, and knew  how to build big hills. Hope was so frightened that, when it came her  turn, the child could not tell even the little she knew.    But Betty, who loved everything in the out-of-door world, forgot herself  and her fright in the true love which she had for natural history. She  said she had spent hours in a neighborhood of ants, near the doorways  they had in the ground. Some of the doorways were large, and some were  small, and the little ants who went in and out of the doors carried off  the pieces of cake she fed to them. Sometimes the crumbs were three or  four times as big as the ants. She had seen two little ants attack a  large piece of cake, but it proved too much for them, so one mounted  guard over it while the other scurried off. In a few moments it came  back with a whole squad of ants, who surrounded the cake and pushed and  pulled with all their might. They actually got it to the door, Betty  said, and after that she could see it no more. Then Betty spoke a little  wistfully: \"If only I had been an ant I could have gone down after it. I  could have seen what they did with it, sir.\"    \"Well, my dear,\" said Ben Gile, \"if you want to see what they do, start  a colony of them some day in a glass case. That will solve a good many  of your problems. And now, what else?\"    \"I saw them doing a good deal that was interesting, sir, but I couldn't  understand it.\"    \"It's your turn, Jack. We will come back to Betty by-and-by.\"    \"I found out, sir, that in every ant colony there are always three kinds  of ants--the queens, the males, and the workers. It's much like what you  told us of the bees. And it seemed to me, sir, every time I looked at  them, that they were happy together, busy with their work and never  quarrelling with one another. I suppose they were happy because each one  had some special work to do. I looked it all up in the books, and I  found that some are born queens, to be waited on, while others are born  workers, to do the serving. But they are all contented.    \"The queen ant is not a real queen ruling a little kingdom; she is the  mother ant, and lays all the eggs. She is well cared for and protected  by the workers. These are the active little ants who do the work. They  are happy, too, running about, digging new passageways, clearing the  paths to their front doors, and bringing in food, which they store in  their granaries. Some ants, sir, build their tunnels very deep  underground. A doorway opens into a wide gallery, from which others  branch and wind their way down into the dark ground. Sometimes they  build a high mound around the entrance, and often a large colony will  have many such mounds.\"    [Illustration:  _A._ Honey ant.  _B._ Ants exchanging greetings.]    \"Some ants,\" added Ben Gile, \"dig out their homes in dead logs or hollow  stems. I know of one little fellow who is clever enough to build a shed.  It hunts around to find decayed wood. This it chews into a fine pulp,  then spreads it out into a roof; sometimes it is a good-sized roof. This  same ant dearly loves the honeydew which aphids secrete. So in order to  protect these helpless little green bugs, and make them as comfortable  and contented as possible, they build a neat shed over them. When the  ants wish a dainty luncheon of honeydew they crawl up under the little  shed and get a drink of this sweet juice. Although a"]]]
